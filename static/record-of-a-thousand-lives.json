Every time. As if it was the first time we met.\u201dA man said this with an emotionless tone while standing at the last cliff of the world.The Demon Emperor\u2019s seven long, thin eyes came down upon the man.As this happened, the Demon Emperor\u2019s lips that resembled saws parted open.[Human.]\u201cWhat is it.\u201d[Why do you not run from me.]\u201cBecause I know it is useless.\u201d[Come back stronger. So that you may destroy me next time.]The man\u2019s heart ripped apart along with the world itself....In a blacksmith\u2019s workshop.In a place so dirty and old that no one even dared to access.A single man was sitting on an oak container.Thump\u2026. Thump\u2026.What made him realize that he came back to the past was, as always, the sound of his heart beating.Kang Yoonsoo slowly opened his eyes.On his right hand was a shiny, well-made sword.He took a look at the terminal he had on his wrist.It displayed the date, as well as the information of the weapon on his hand.TODAY:468-P-3(REORKAN)[Longsword of Light]Rank-NormalSlicing Strength: 8There is a small chance of having the sword spew out light when attacking.The 468th year of the Reorkan empire, at the 3rd day of the month of the pheonix.The day the people of earth were transferred into an unknown land.He had traveled 20 years back into the past.Again.Kang Yoonsoo looked at the blade of the sword on his hand. He swung the sword lightly. A sound of something slicing through the air could be heard.Vuun\u2013He could remember his first life.In his 1st life, he was a blacksmith.He always managed to survive one way or the other. As a person with a production class, he was always looked down on by others. He always regretted his decision to become a blacksmith. When the war with Pandemonium began, he worked as a repairman in the army. Then, he came in contact with the Demon Emperor.The tyrannical being who was trying to destroy the world.He was targeted by the Demon Emperor, and died.He could remember his 2nd life as well.When he opened his eyes, he was in the old workshop. He realized that he went back in time. After that point, his life changed dramatically compared to his first one. He acquired many rare equipments, gathered comrades, and created a mercenary\u2019s guild. The mercenary class required the person to be in battle frequently, but it was much better than living as a blacksmith. After 20 years, the war with Pandemonium began, and his mercenary corp fought valiantly in the front lines.He then got targeted by the Demon Emperor, and died.He could now remember his 3rd life.After going back in time, Kang Yoon Soo pondered upon his mistakes carefully. He destroyed anything that could potentially hinder him as soon as he could, and by using the memories he had from his previous lives, he levelled up tremendously fast. After carefully thinking over what class he would become, he chose to become the Enhancer. He enhanced his weapons and armor to their fullest, and he had no enemies who could face him.Except for the Demon Emperor.4th life. He only looked towards the sword.When he got killed three times by the Demon Emperor, he became full of murderous intent. He took a single sword, and put himself through hellish training. He explored various dangerous hunting areas and ruins by himself.After much time, his skill with the sword reached its peak, and he had already killed up to thirty giant-class monsters by himself. In the end, he chose to take the class \u201clegendary swordsman\u201d. The emperor designated him to be the leader of the First Knight Platoon. As a leader of a knight platoon, he successfully led the army against Pandemonium.But the Demon Emperor exceeded his skill in both strategy and militaristic force. He got killed by the Demon Emperor.His 5th life was harsh.He was used to going back in time at this point. He decided to think differently this time. He decided to not care about whether this world got destroyed or not. He lived as quietly as he could. In order to not be noticed by others, he decided to earn just enough to live a normal life. He chose to be a Runner. It was a common class. When the war against Pandemonium began, he ran away to an uninhabited island.But the Demon Emperor found him. And killed him.At his 6th life, he began to feel fear.Right after returning, he began to gather mana. He memorized spells, and felt the flow of mana. After much effort, he became a sorcerer. He then invested the rest of his time in stealth.When the war began, he used everything he could in order to hide himself at the edge of the world. But the Demon Emperor managed to find him. Like this, he got killed by the Demon Emperor.7th life. Fighting wasn\u2019t everything.He trained himself in the art of talking as much as he could. He trained himself to talk more philosophically, and smoothly. After ten years of training under a famous poet, he became a diplomat.He convinced the emperor to surrender to Pandemonium. The citizens were slaughtered, and the continent was drenched in blood. The palace, however, was safe.But the Demon Emperor did not accept his surrender. In the end, the Demon Emperor killed him.After this, he couldn\u2019t remember much. This was because his 8th and his 9th life were filled with too much dread.10th life.At this point, he was getting crazy. As soon as he went back, he began to kill. He let out his stress with murder. It wasn\u2019t hard to become a slaughterer, especially with all his skills.Sooner or later, he became the most infamous slaughterer in the entire continent. After killing his three thousandth victim, he got a chance to acquire a hidden class known as life eater. There was no one who could defeat him in the entire continent.The war began, and the Demon Emperor appeared. He curled up on the ground, and began trembling. He asked over and over again to not destroy the world, and to not let him keep going back in time. The Demon Emperor refused.Like always, he got killed by the Demon Emperor.After that point, he kept asking the same question whenever he met the Demon Emperor. Why did you have to keep putting me back in time? The Demon Emperor responded to his question at the ninety-eighth life.[Keep reviving. Become a worthy enemy for me.]The Demon Emperor was looking for an enemy. But he, who was simply far too powerful, was unable to find an opponent even in hell. So he chose a single person, and made that person repeat his life over and over again.That person was Kang Yoonsoo.[Repeating one\u2019s life makes a person stronger, after all.]Kang Yoonsoo realized. He was only a toy. The only way to break out of this cycle was to kill the Demon Emperor. But doing that would be harder than destroying the entire world itself.After finishing explaining, the Demon Emperor killed him.214th life.After much time, he became a grandmaster puppeteer. He performed the greatest forbidden technique as a puppeteer. He turned his own body into the strongest doll there was. In his cold heart was an undying soul, and even the softest parts of his body contained weapons in it. It was possible to heal himself even from a life-threatening wound.But he was soon turned to dust by the Demon Emperor.273rd life.In order to reach the halls of the hidden rogue masters, he passed through various traps, and became a grandmaster thief. He mastered all sorts of techniques, starting from picking locks all the way to poisoning a man. He stole the goblet of infinity, the demon sword of blood, and the stamp of destruction from the nest of the dragon of the apocalypse. The only thing he couldn\u2019t steal was the sky, the sun, and the moon.But he was unable to steal the soul of the Demon Emperor.347th life.He created a relation with the monsters. Their languages were all different, and they all possessed violent personalities. But he, who managed to master all sorts of languages, tactics, and fighting techniques, became a successful leader of the monsters. He became the lord of all monsters, and conquered the continent.Then he got conquered by the Demon King.454th life.He started off as the Last Necromancer, and then became the Undead Lich. His flesh had rotted off, and only bones remained. He was a being that was able to tempt all living things, and was something that could not die even if he wanted to. He was able to handle high-class undead like the Neverdead Dragon and the Death General. He created an undying army, and fought against Pandemonium.The Demon Emperor appeared, and he began to drain the Emperor\u2019s life immediately. But even as a lich, the Demon Emperor\u2019s life energy simply was too much. His body, unable to contain all the energy, exploded.522h life.He memorized how to create all kinds of potions. He became the leader of the Alchemist Association, and became the Great Alchemist. He used various potions to strengthen his body to the fullest, and by using a lava golem, as well as custom bombs, he changed the course of the entire war.But that all soon changed when the Demon Emperor appeared. He took a stone of invulnerability, in order to stay alive, but the Demon Emperor shattered his body to pieces.592nd life.He admitted that he couldn\u2019t win against the Demon Emperor. There was no way to defeat Pandemonium, no matter what he did. He decided to research ways in order to go back to his real world. When he became a scholar, the amount of information he could store multiplied.The war began, and the Demon Emperor killed him.689th life.After a thousand years of work, he finally found a way to get back to the real world. Thanks to this achievement, his class advanced to become \u201cThe Sage Who Forgot The World\u201d. He traveled through dimensions, and returned to Seoul. The Demon Emperor found him, however, and killed him.719th life.As the general of the imperial navy, he created a giant ship, and sailed out of the Igiris Strait. After a long time of sailing, he reached the eastern continent. It was filled with people who ate rice, and focused on martial arts. His class as an explorer advanced to become the \u201cExplorer of the Unknown\u201d. He wanted to stay on the continent, but there was only four days left till the war began.A friendly martial artist hid him, but the Demon Emperor flew all the way to the Eastern Continent and killed him.742nd life.He realized that he couldn\u2019t provoke the Demon Emperor just by raising his middle finger. The Demon Emperor ripped him apart along with the world with an emotionless face.834th life.The king of corrupt things, Sirian. He shared a drink with the one known as this. Strangely enough, they seemed to have many similarities. He was even able to get the answer to the question he was thinking of. At the same time, he became despondent. His last drink was filled with the king\u2019s blood.The Demon Emperor killed him.872nd life.His emotions dried up. He stopped talking, and his personality became cold and dry. Looking at a smiling child didn\u2019t make him feel happy, and he no longer felt anything when killing something. He didn\u2019t really feel much when the Demon Emperor killed him as well.915th life.He lived for 18,000 years. He was tired of getting hidden classes or acquiring new skills. Everything was just getting repetitive. Even getting killed by the Demon Emperor was repetitive at this point.Crack\u2014!The window smashed when the sword tip he swung came in contact with it.Kang Yoonsoo stood up with a pair of dry eyes.He softly put the blade of his sword against the walls of the cold furnace.Scrape\u2026. Scrape\u2026. Scrape\u2026.A small \u6b63 symbol was drawn 199 times. The last \u6b63 ended at its fourth stroke.Today marked the day Kang Yoonsoo died 999 times.His 1000th life began.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I am thankful that you all decided to follow me. I\u2019d like to know everyone\u2019s names, but I believe it would be better for us to come to terms with what just happened to us.\u201dHwang Yongho was a man with a physique that resembled a bear. He had a rough, unkempt beard on him, and he was the oldest person in the group.\u201cThis all happened this afternoon. As soon as we came here, I gathered teammates, and scouted the area. There was a giant forest filled with plants I had never seen before. When I saw this, I immediately knew that we weren\u2019t in Korea.\u201dThe ones who were with Hwang Yongho at the time all nodded.Hwang Yongho slowly continued talking.\u201cWe kept climbing up. We were trying to find some food, and we wanted to reach the peak to survey our surroundings. But while we were doing this, we encountered something unbelievable.\u201dPeople were beginning to pay attention to Hwang Yongho\u2019s words.Hwang Yongho spoke with a low voice, as if he was telling a secret to everyone.\u201cIt seemed to be a person who was in the same situation as us. A lone man was climbing the mountain. Perhaps he was trying to find some food. We were about to ask him to work with us, then\u2026\u2026. A giant orc came out of the bush next to him.\u201d\u201cOrc? Orc as in green-skinned creatures with large canines?\u201dA man with glasses spoke with a surprised expression.The others made a similar face.Hwang Yongho nodded with a serious face.\u201cYes. It was that orc. It was big enough to make us believe that just 5 of us wouldn\u2019t be able to take it out. It was holding a big club, and it used its club to beat the man. The man\u2019s body ripped in two, and fell down. The orc beat the man into a mush of meat, and ate it.\u201dA bead of cold sweat ran down everyone\u2019s backs.To think there would be such a monster in the forest.This really was a violent, lawless place.And to think there was an orc.This place might actually be a medieval fantasy world that only existed in books.\u201cThat wasn\u2019t all.\u201dThere was more?The people looked at Hwang Yongho with a face filled with curiosity and concern.Hwang Yongho, at this moment, had more attention than any storyteller.Hwang Yongho tapped on the terminal strapped to his wrist.\u201cYou must all know that there is a special system in this device.\u201dEveryone nodded.When they got transported to this world, they were all given a unique tool.Tools such as a small poisonous knife, or some spiked leggings.When they equipped, or held the item on their hand, the terminal displayed the information of the tool.When they tapped on a certain switch, a display of experience points, and level appeared.No one knew who gave it to them, but the terminal was something essential for those who were in a foreign world.\u201cAs you know, we can earn experience and advance as we kill things. It is also possible to take on a certain class, although we don\u2019t know how this works yet. The problem is, this privilege also applies to \u2018monsters\u2019 like orcs.\u201dAt that moment, a few people paled. Someone quickly asked a question.\u201cWhat do you mean? What do you mean that this applies to monsters as well? This wasn\u2019t something given exclusively to us?\u201d\u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s not. When the orc killed someone, the terminal displayed a clear message. [Wandering Orc Ashrem has levelled up.] Anyone could see that the orc had levelled up.\u201dThe people made a face of despair when they heard Hwang Yongho\u2019s calm voice.Even monsters could level up?This was different from normal games.This meant that the players would become the hunted.One woman, unable to take this all in, sobbed, and asked a question.\u201cThen\u2026\u2026 what shall we do?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s simple. We just have to level up. We just have to get strong enough to let no one kill us.\u201d\u201cBut how? We\u2019re weak. We\u2019ll get hunted down before we even manage to do anything.\u201dWhen a man said this with a worn out voice, Hwang Yongho smirked.Everyone envied how Hwang Yongho was able to smile in this situation.But his smile seemed to be strangely twisted in some way.\u201cWe just have to hunt the weak, in that case.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIf the monsters are too strong, we just have to get the humans.\u201dAt that moment, everyone became silent.Someone asked a question.\u201cWe\u2019re going to commit murder?\u201d\u201cThis is the best way to survive here.\u201dEveryone looked at each other, but didn\u2019t say anything.Strangely enough, no one talked about morals in this situation. They all saw people die in the hands of monsters. They did not wish to end up the same way.Hwang Yongho expected this, and brought seemingly weak people with him.Seeing how no one really tried to refute him, it was easy to see how skilled Hwang Yongho was when it came to choosing the right people.A man swallowed a wad of spit, and asked a question.\u201cThen\u2026\u2026. How shall we kill?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll act at dawn, and we\u2019ll have to aim someone who is acting alone. In order to find out how we gain experience with multiple people acting out against a single being, we\u2019ll tie up the person, and attack him all at once. The one who did best in the battle shall be the one to get the prey\u2019s items.\u201dHwang Yongho gave them a set of rules, and as simple as it may be, it still made the people feel a little safer. They managed to get an objective for once. A woman, who seemed to have become a little excited, spoke.\u201cWho shall we target?\u201d\u201cI already had someone in mind, actually.\u201dHwang Yongho pointed to a small wooden building in the distance.It was an old workshop.A small light could be seen from the inside, indicating that someone was inside.\u201cI peeked in, since I heard something break, and I managed to find a lone man inside. He didn\u2019t seem that cautious, and he seemed like someone who gave up on his life. How about we kill that man first?\u201dThe survivors nodded in agreement.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Let\u2019s end this quickly.\u201dThe men nodded with faces full of tension.The tension came only from the fact that this was their first time committing murder, not from questioning whether they could win or not.They had eight people on their side.It was impossible for a single man to fight eight people.Hwang Yongho carefully opened the door of the workshop.At the same time, he rushed into the place.The others quickly followed.The moonlight seeped through the windows, and lit up the workshop.The ashes in the furnace mixed with the moonlight to emit a strange light.The blacksmith tools in the room indicated that it hadn\u2019t been used for a long time.Hwang Yongho pressed the green button on his terminal.The flashlight was turned on, and a faint light began to flow from it.The people in the group used the flashlight to search the place.They looked through every object in the room, and searched all the closets as well.But the man was nowhere to be found.\u201cDid he run?\u201dA man asked this quietly.But Hwang Yongho shook his head in response.\u201cLet\u2019s search a bit longer. The lights were still on just a moment ago. It\u2019s unlikely that he left the building.\u201d\u201cAhh-!\u201dAll of the sudden, a scream resounded near the anvil.Everyone shined their flashlight near that direction.A man, who was alive just a moment ago, was found with his head cut off.\u201cW, what the hell?\u201dOne of the men stepped back with a surprise.That moment, the man felt something hit his foot, and something cold passed through his neck.A few seconds later, the man realized that his neck had a large hole in it.Pssh\u2013!\u201cKuh\u2026. keho!\u201dBlood exploded out of the hole in the man\u2019s throat.Another person fell.Everyone gripped onto their weapon tightly with confused faces.\u201cWhat the hell\u2019s going on, fuck!\u201d\u201cT, two people died in an instant!\u201dEveryone searched frantically with their flashlights, but they could only see blood.They couldn\u2019t even find the shadow of the murderer, or even sense him at all.Right then.Bang\u2013!The door of the workshop closed.Almost as if telling everyone inside that they would be unable to get out alive.The men became panicked.There were a few who swung their sword around everywhere, and there were a few who tried to hide.\u201cCalm down! There\u2019s no use in getting panicked!\u201dHwang Yongho shouted this out loudly, but even he was getting panicked.The murderer killed two men without a sound.The murderer wasn\u2019t hesitant when it came to killing people.\u201cArgh\u2013!\u201dAnother scream resounded in the darkness.The flashlight revealed a man stabbed in the heart.Those who were still alive turned pale.One of the men screamed in fear.\u201cW, we gotta run! We gotta run!\u201dThe man\u2019s footsteps, which could be heard running towards the doorway, disappeared.They were all too afraid to use the flashlight now.Hwang Yongho suppressed his fear, and used his flashlight.He could see a corpse with a hole in its head.\u201cAhh-!\u201d\u201cHurgh\u2013!\u201d\u201cKuuh\u2013!\u201dThe speed at which people died sped up.Three men screamed in the dark.Seven men were dead at this point in time.Only Hwang Yongho was left alive.The fear that he might die here, and the fact that he was alone made him even more afraid.Hwang Yongho struck the table next to him with his spear, and ground his teeth.\u201cWho is it? Reveal yourself!\u201dAt that moment, he could feel something cold at his back.Hwang Yongho decided to rely on his instincts, and immediately turned back and stabbed out with his spear.His spear came in contact with something solid.Cheng\u2013!With that strike, light shined out.The enemy\u2019s sword had let out a blinding light.Hwang Yongho had to squint due to the light, but he managed to clearly see the person in front of him.Short hair.Pale skin.An emotionless face that resembled a mask.Early twenties.It was the man who had been alone in the workshop.That was the only thing he could think at that time.He could see or think no more.The man\u2019s sword shot out towards Hwang Yongho\u2019s face.\u201cHup\u2013!\u201dHis cheek was sliced.His flesh was torn off, and his white teeth was revealed.Hwang Yongho was overwhelmed by the pain, and fell backwards, letting go of his spear in the process.He touched his cheek, now wet with blood, with trembling hands.His whole body was trembling.It was almost as if he was fighting a war machine.No wasted movement.Unhesitant strikes.The man didn\u2019t seem like a human.\u201cWhat\u2026\u2026.!\u201dIt was at the moment when Hwang Yongho opened his mouth.He could hear a dry voice from the darkness.\u201cWhat the hell are you.\u201dHwang Yongho was surprised.Those words were the exact words he was trying to say.Was it just a coincidence?Hwang Yongho stepped backwards in surprise.He could hear footsteps coming closer to him.The man was walking towards him.\u201cDon\u2019t\u2026\u2026.!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t kill me. I haven\u2019t done anything wrong. Killing me is murder. Do you not have any regret.\u201d\u201cHow\u2026\u2026.!\u201d\u201cHow do you know what I\u2019m going to say. Fuck, what the hell are you.\u201dHwang Yongho felt a shiver run down his spine.The man was saying everything he was about to say.What the hell was this?Could that man read his mind?Before Hwang Yongho could think any further, he could hear a bone-chilling voice in his ear.\u201cEven your words, I\u2019m absolutely sick of it.\u201dThe man\u2019s sword struck down.Slice\u2013!Hwang Yongho died, with his body spewing out blood.Kang Yoonsoo put back his sword.He took out a mop that was laid out on the table, and cleaned the blood.Then, he took items that he needed from the corpses.There was no need to turn on the lamp.He knew, even if he didn\u2019t see.When he took away the items from the dead corpses, the terminal displayed new words.[Spear of Heat]Rank-NormalPiercing Strength: 9The spear heats up when it gets in contact with flammable material.[Power Gauntlet]Rank-NormalStrength: 10Strength rises when equipped.[Throwing Knives(x20)]Rank-NormalThrowing Strength: 4Has a slight chance of blinding the enemy.[Your crime point rose due to killing eight men.As this was done in self-defense, the points will reduce significantly.Current Crime Points-3When this rises, you may suffer when being investigated.][Experience rises tremendously due to synergy between murder and slaughter.This is your first murder. Experience rises as a bonus.You levelled up 12 times.][Strength][Sight][Endurance][Sensitivity]You were able to raise one stat per level.Kang Yoonsoo chose to invest all his points into strength.He stuck the Spear of Heat into the furnace.When the spear touched the pile of ashes, it began to emit heat.The cold furnace immediately heated up.A red light could be seen inside.When the furnace heated up, Kang Yoonsoo took out the spear.When he walked out of the workshop, the ones inside flinched, and looked at him.\u201cWhat the? What happened to the guys inside?\u201d\u201cWhy did this guy come out? Urk, isn\u2019t this a smell of blood?\u201d\u201cTh, they\u2019re dead. The guys who went in all died!\u201dThe survivors all looked at him with a surprised face.Kang Yoonsoo kept walking with an emotionless face.A man with a threatening face blocked his path with a knife.\u201cThose items seem to be the possessions of the ones who went inside the workshop. You killed them, didn\u2019t you?\u201dThe man swallowed his spit when he saw the items Kang Yoonsoo stole.He was an evil man who cared more for items rather than other humans.\u201cGive it here. Those are the items our comrades had originally. Are you really trying to steal them? If you don\u2019t give it, I\u2019ll kill you.\u201dKang Yoonsoo looked at them with lifeless eyes.They were people who gave up on humanity for survival.In the future, they\u2019d form a giant clan of criminals.Hwang Yongho would kill many people as the leader of that clan.Kang Yoonsoo almost died multiple times in their hands.Kang Yoonsoo looked at all of the survivors, and opened his mouth.\u201cIn 20 seconds, you will all die.\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\u201cThese will be your last words.\u201dKang Yoonsoo kept walking after saying this.When all the survivors in the scene made confused faces, a giant sound could be heard from the back.\u201cKrobit\u2013! Absaloon\u2013!\u201dCrack\u2013!The person at the very back became crushed into a bloody mush.The monster with a giant warhammer in hand looked down on all of them with a growl.The monster with a muscular body, and a cow\u2019s head, the minotaur.The monster who killed many on the first day smelled blood, and came here.There wasn\u2019t even time to scream.The minotaur swung its hammer like a storm.All the survivors broke apart into pieces.Kang Yoonsoo, who was outside the range of the hammer, was safe.He held a sword on his right hand, and a spear on the other.The weapons were something that both required different skills and rhythm.It was impossible for someone to use a spear and sword all at once.But that logic didn\u2019t apply to Kang Yoonsoo.The spec differences between the two was immense.The minotaur\u2019s level was 33.Kang Yoonsoo was only level 13. It seemed like an impossible battle.Right then, the minotaur let out a snort, and put down his hammer.\u201cKrunta\u2013! Margot\u2013! Kiris\u2013!\u201dIf one were to translate it, it would mean this.Since I have all the food I need for today, I\u2019ll let you run.Kang Yoonsoo stared up at the minotaur silently.Then, he spoke in the language of the minotaurs.\u201cAmak. Okonoll. Karu.\u201dHis words meant this.You die by my hands.\u201cKuoooooo\u2013!\u201dThe maddened minotaur lifted its warhammer into the sky.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Koom.The ground shook slightly when the minotaur walked.Kang Yoonsoo ran around the workshop to the crafting section.During this time, the space between them shortened quite a bit.It would only take a few seconds till the minotaur catched up.When the minotaur took a final step that would let it catch up to Kang Yoonsoo.Krrack\u2013!The ground it was standing on fell apart.It was a trap filled with small, sharp pieces of iron.The minotaur fell forward into the trap clumsily.\u201cKarka\u2013! Konoll\u2013!\u201dIt didn\u2019t end with the minotaur just falling, however.The minotaur broke a part of the workshop as it fell.When its sturdy body destroyed the old, frail walls of the workshop, a red-hot furnace was revealed.The minotaur\u2019s head smashed into the furnace.Chii\u2013!\u201cKuruaaaaaa\u2013!\u201dA sound of flesh burning began to spread.The minotaur quickly lifted its head, but the furnace\u2019s heat was much too strong.It had already gotten an injury that burrowed deep inside its head.At that moment, Kang Yoonsoo jumped up, and landed on the minotaur\u2019s neck.Due to Kang Yoonsoo\u2019s weight, the minotaur was unable to lift its head.Kang Yoonsoo used his sword and spear at the same time to slash at the back of the minotaur\u2019s head.The minotaur\u2019s bones and skin were thick and strong.It was hard to injure them with swords and spears.But Kang Yoonsoo had aimed for a weak part in the minotaur\u2019s muscles.He was able to wield two weapons that even veteran mercenaries had trouble with with ease.\u201cKimalk\u2013! Marugot\u2013!\u201dEvery time the minotaur lifted its head, Kang Yoonsoo struck a powerful blow to it.When the minotaur\u2019s head touched the furnace, it got burned while emitting steam.The flesh burned away, and the creature\u2019s bones were revealed.The minotaur resisted with much force as it could muster.But due to having its body stuck in the trap, it was unable to even swing it\u2019s hammer.Kang Yoonsoo\u2019s eyes were calm and uncaring, even when he was watching such a thing.He stabbed the minotaur\u2019s half-burnt head with his spear.Crack\u2013!The skull broke away, and blood was splattered everywhere.Soon after this, the minotaur\u2019s resistance got weaker.[You have killed the Cruel Minotaur (Level 33).Due to having killed a strong monster alone, your experience rises significantly.If you visit the noble who requested the death of this minotaur, you may be able to get a special reward.Your level rose 8 times.]Again, Kang Yoonsoo raised his strength. The weight of his sword and spear got lighter.Normally, one would collect the minotaur\u2019s hide or skin, or melt its warhammer to attain good steel, Kang Yoonsoo did not do this.Kang Yoonsoo put his sword in its hilt, put the spear on his back, and walked.He didn\u2019t even look at the map displayed on his terminal.Behind him, the moonlight and a stream of blood flowed together....The Koreans of the real world became transferred into a new world.The name of this place was \u2018Sylphia Continent\u2019, but it was normally called \u2018Continent\u2019 instead.The size of this continent far surpassed that of Asia.But since its naval technology did not advance much, it was unable to travel far beyond the continent.Like Kang Yoonsoo\u2019s world, the Sylphia Continent had people who lived there from the very beginning.They called themselves the \u2018People of the Continent\u2019, and called those like Kang Yoonsoo \u2018Travelers\u2019.The way to distinguish between the two was the terminal strapped onto the wrists of the Traveler.Unlike the People of the Continent, who possessed an ability to raise their abilities from birth, the Travelers needed the terminal on their wrists in order to level up.In this world, there was a peculiar system.One may level up, and advance into a certain class.It would be easy to see it as a world where reality fused with a video game.But the world did have some things that differed from games.Level up wasn\u2019t possible just for humans.Most monsters were unable to level up, but named ones could always do so.And the biggest difference of this world and games was the fact that one could not revive even after death.Not even a great wizard could revive a corpse fully.Even the Last Necromancer, Nacron, could only revive someone as an undead.There occasionally appeared puppeteers who turned corpses to puppets, but that was completely outlawed.Because of this, life was extremely important.Both in real life and here.\u201cDo you get it? If we die, it\u2019s over. We warned you.\u201dChoi Changsuk said this to the man carefully.However, Kang Yoonsoo did not respond.Choi Changsuk and his company looked at Kang Yoonsoo with a displeased face.\u201cKyarak! Kyaruru!\u201dThe cries of goblins could be heard from behind the rocks.The small cave that was partially sealed was a habitat for goblins.They had come all the way out here to go on a goblin hunt.The times when people got transferred into this world was all different.There was a case where a group of them got transferred at once, or there was a case where a single individual got transferred to a strange place.There was even a high schooler who got transferred to a dragon\u2019s nest to attain a powerful skill right from the get-go.Choi Chang Suk had arrived here two months ago, as the 70th Traveler.He had arrived at the outskirts of a town with his college friends.They were lucky, compared to those who fell in the middle of nowhere, or a sealed dungeon.And since they were all sports enthusiasts, they were used to harsh physical work.Choi Changsuk\u2019s class was a mercenary.When one invests time into this class, he can wield weapons easily, and be able to get missions easily.Once one gets power and money, he could create his own mercenary company.Also, while Choi Changsuk himself might not know, the class\u2019 second class advancement quest turned out to be the hardest of them all.Choi Changsuk, who had been a student representative in reality, got a mission as a leader of his group.The name of the mission was \u2018Goblin Extermination\u2019.He had to get rid of 100 goblins, regardless of the type.The killed goblin would be recorded in the terminal, and going back to the person who gave the mission would allow them to get rewards.Like any other fantasy games or books, goblins were the weakest monster of the bunch. Their levels were 20 at best, and their intelligence was weak, as well.There was a case where they grew rapidly, but that only happened occasionally.But since their poisoned daggers and arrows were actually quite dangerous, it was critical for one to stay alert.There were actually quite a lot of people who died due to underestimating goblins.\u201cAs we have agreed earlier, Kang Yoonsoo will go first.\u201dKang Yoonsoo got into the group quite later than everyone.To be more specific, he got in just when Choi Changsuk arrived at the goblin habitat.There were four people in Choi Changsuk\u2019s group, and since their levels were quite high, there was no need to have a new member in the group.But goblins love using traps and tricks.No matter how high-leveled you were, spike traps and poisonous snakes were always dangerous.Therefore, Kang Yoonsoo got the job of scouting out the area for the group beforehand.Choi Changsuk\u2019s group would follow Kang Yoonsoo from the back.Kang Yoonsoo went into the habitat alone, and the group watched him from the back quietly.Soon, Kang Yoonsoo\u2019s figure faded into the darkness.Lee Yuri, a first year underclassman, was about to follow him in.Choi Changsuk grabbed her hand.\u201cYuri, wait.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s just leave him be.\u201dLee Yuri made a confused face, and Choi Changsuk shrugged.Her two other upperclassmen had a similar face as Choi Changsuk.Lee Yuri thought for a bit, then sat back down, as she understood what they were talking about.Kang Yoonsoo joined the group late.To put it simply, they weren\u2019t even familiar with each other.There was no need to share the reward with him.And adding onto that fact, Kang Yoonsoo was wielding a spear with his sword.Unless he was an unparalleled expert, there was no way he could use two different weapons at once.Even his equipment showed how much of a newbie he was.A newbie would only cause trouble to the group.That was why they were letting Kang Yoonsoo die in the cave.While this world was similar to a game, it was still all real.There was no reason to fight with trouble in their midst.Lee Minsoo the swordsman let out a suggestion.\u201cHey, about that sword that bitch was using. It didn\u2019t look bad. Mind if I use it when he dies?\u201d\u201cSure, I\u2019m getting the spear, though.\u201dWhen Choi Changsuk said this, Hong Garam, who had the same class as him, frowned.\u201cWhat? I was thinking of using it already, though.\u201d\u201cAt least you have a decent axe. Look at my sword, it\u2019s chipped all over the place. I need to make a mercenary company later, do you think I\u2019d even look good with a sword like this?\u201dWhile they were talking, Lee Yuri tilted her head in confusion, and opened her mouth.\u201cIsn\u2019t it too quiet?\u201dIndeed. It was too quiet.It\u2019s been twenty minutes since Kang Yoonsoo went in.Hong Garam, who had the most amount of defensive equipment on him out of everyone in the group, stood up.\u201cI\u2019ll go inside.\u201dA moment after he stomped into the cave, his surprised shout soon came from the inside.\u201cHey! Guys! Come here! Take a look at this!\u201dChoi Chang Suk became a little confused, and went in.All kinds of traps could be seen sprawled out in the cave, clearly showing how they missed their target.On the floor of the dimly lit cave were corpses of tens of goblins.Strangely enough, their skin was red.Past the pile of corpses was Kang Yoonsoo, who could be seen sitting down with a bloody sword and spear in his hand.He had no injuries whatsoever.Choi Changsuk began to talk with a stutter.\u201cY, you took out all of them in 20 minutes\u2026\u2026.?\u201dKang Yoonsoo nodded slowly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Kyararak-! Kyarorok-!\u201dChoi Chang Suk took out his sword.\u201cShit, so there were remnants. It\u2019s a hobgoblin mob! Everyone get ready for battle!\u201d\u201cKyaruru-!\u201d\u201cHaa-!\u201dThe red goblins charged with their daggers pointing forwards.Choi Chang Suk, who was standing at the very front, swung his sword.Ching-!The opponent\u2019s dagger was broken, and the hobgoblin\u2019s chin was sliced deeply.He then stabbed the hobgoblin deeply in the heart as it screamed.\u201cHah\u2026\u2026 Hah\u2026\u2026 Damn it!\u201dThere was no time to even breath.Another goblin swung its sword at him.When Choi Chang Suk closed his eyes due to being exposed to such an attack, Hong Garam struck downwards with his axe.The hobgoblin fell, spilling out its guts in the process.But there were still many hobgoblins around them.Lee Yuri shouted from the back with a voice that contained a tinge of fear in it.\u201cI got the wrong place! This is a hobgoblin den, not a goblin cave!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s too late to run! Stop crying like that and start shooting!\u201dHobgoblin.They were a subspecies of a goblin that possessed red skin.They armed themselves with weapons that they took care of, and they were much bigger than a typical goblin.There were many skilled warriors in their midst, and each of them were at least level 30.Choi Chang Suk\u2019s level was 36.The levels of the other three were about 30.He could fight on his own, but he was outnumbered far too much.There were about a hundred hobgoblins surrounding them.The hobgoblins had sealed off the exit and surrounded them.Each and every one of the hobgoblins were nimble, and skilled.\u2018Shit. Just how does he manage to hunt these things?\u2019Choi Chang Suk looked over at Kang Yoonsoo as he swung his sword.Kang Yoonsoo was fighting by constantly alternating between the sword and the spear.His skill in being able to lightly dodge the attacks from the hobgoblins, and being able to kill them in a single strike made him resemble a demon.It looked like he had killed up to thirty hobgoblins by himself already.\u2018Is he actually really high leveled?\u2019Kang Yoonsoo\u2019s equipments were quite strange, but this was the only conclusion Choi Chang Suk could reach.After all, it was impossible to fight like this in the first place without a lot of experience.While levels raise someone\u2019s physical power, the user was the one who had to have the skill to be able to make use of it.But Choi Chang Suk\u2019s prediction was wrong.Kang Yoonsoo\u2019s level was only in its 20s.It was the lowest in the group.But it was hard for anyone to believe that the movements of his were from a low leveled person.\u201cUrk\u2013!\u201dA hobgoblin\u2019s sword passed by, and blood shot out of Kim Minsoo\u2019s shoulder.His defense was quite weaker than others in the first place.He pressed down on his injury with his hand due to the pain that came from it, and a gap appeared within the group.In an instant, three hobgoblins came towards Kim Minsoo.\u201cMercenary\u2019s Fighting Spirit!\u201dHong Garam quickly activated his class-specific skill.Class-specific skills.Once someone chose his class, he was able to attain a class-specific skill.The amount of these skills would rise as one kept advancing.Skills could be earned by learning from an expert, reading special texts, or buying it with money.Hong Garam\u2019s eyes began emitting a red light.His muscles bulged, and he immediately swung his axe with force.Crack\u2013!The three hobgoblins were immediately killed, and the fragments of their corpses were flown all the way to the other side of the cave.\u201cT, thanks, Garam!\u201d\u201cHah, hah!\u201dHong Garam knelt down on the ground without even being able to respond.The skill \u2018Mercenary\u2019s Fighting Spirit\u2019 raised one\u2019s physical strength immensely in a short period of time, but it also brought a lot of stress on the user.And a two-handed axe used up a lot of strength in the first place.This wasn\u2019t a technique that could be used much, unless one was a veteran who was able to endure immense muscle pain.Once two of the people in the group became unable to fight, things quickly became worse.And Lee Yuri was only shooting a few arrows from the back, without even being able to hit her targets.Actually, her arrows usually managed to fly towards Kang Yoonsoo and Choi Chang Suk, which effectively managed to hinder them in combat.Then, Kim Minsoo, who was on the ground due to his injury, stood up.\u201cShit. Spirit of The Sword!\u201dThe class-specific skill of the swordsman, Spirit of The Sword.It raised the strength of its user much less than the skill \u2018Mercenary\u2019s Fighting Spirit\u2019, but it allowed the user to forget his pain for a moment.It also raised the sword\u2019s attack, and lessened the energy consumption of the sword.Kim Minsoo swung his sword with vigor, even with a wound on his right arm.Hong Garam, too, overcame his pain and began to fight once more.After a few hours, the hobgoblins were all killed by the four.The last one had been killed by Kang Yoonsoo\u2019s spear.The group sighed in relief after the last hobgoblin died.\u201cWow, to think we killed this many hobgoblins. I can\u2019t believe it.\u201dHong Garam said this as he massaged his arms.Kim Minsoo asked a question as he applied bandages on his injured arm.\u201cChang Suk, how many did we kill?\u201dChoi Chang Suk answered after taking a look at the terminal.\u201c99. That\u2019s too bad. We would\u2019ve completed the request if we killed one more. Wait, before that.\u201dChoi Chang Suk turned around, and glared at Lee Yuri. She flinched, and looked down.\u201cHey, Lee Yuri. What the hell is this? You were supposed to find a goblin habitat with your skill. So how the hell did we end up with hobgoblins? We almost died, you know.\u201d\u201cSorry, but I found out that there was something \u2018amazing\u2019 in the cave with my skill.\u201d\u201cDear god. You should\u2019ve at least checked the levels of the monsters in the cave. I know there\u2019s only a small chance of your skill succeeding, but we\u2019re risking our lives here, you know. Honestly, you know you\u2019re the only one in the group that\u2019s not doing your job properly?\u201d\u201cWhat? Aren\u2019t you being too harsh on me here? It\u2019s not my fault that the skill gave me false results.\u201d\u201cAh, fuck. You really are getting bold, just because I\u2019m being kind to you because you\u2019re a girl, aren\u2019t you?\u201dThe two began to argue with more vigor as time passed.Lee Yuri began crying, and Choi Chang Suk made a cruel, annoyed face.Kim Minsoo and Hong Garam became delighted at seeing the annoying Lee Yuri being scolded, and ignored her.Kang Yoonsoo, on the other hand, was quietly sitting down on a stone at the other side of the cave.His level rose by ten in the battle.Once again, he invested all his stat points in strength. His level was now 31.Kang Yoonsoo looked at Choi Chang Suk\u2019s group for a moment.He could see a man and a woman fighting each other, and two men watching the fight from the side.\u201cI killed you many times in the past.\u201dWhen Kang Yoonsoo spoke, the area suddenly became quiet.Choi Chang Suk frowned deeply.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI had almost died here in the past thanks to you. And I killed you for the first time in my tenth life.\u201dThe group\u2019s eyes became hostile as they looked at Kang Yoonsoo.Kang Yoonsoo ignored this, and kept talking.\u201cI decided to try something new once. I tried traveling with each of you. Kim Minsoo betrayed me during a werewolf hunt and ran away. Hong Garam stole my weapon and ran while I was sleeping. Choi Chang Suk stole away my achievements to become a leader of a mercenary group. Lee Yuri did all kinds of evil acts under the guise of a young girl. I was betrayed by you many, many times.\u201dKang Yoonsoo\u2019s indifferent tone was extremely cold.Choi Chang Suk walked towards Kang Yoonsoo with a hostile face.\u201cWhat is it that you want to say?\u201d\u201cI never regretted killing you people. This fact never changed in any of my lives, it seemed.\u201dChoi Chang Suk grabbed onto Kang Yoonsoo\u2019s collars violently.Kang Yoonsoo just looked at him with an indifferent face.Choi Chang Suk made an angry face while chewing his lips.\u201cHa! Look at this bastard saying whatever he wants because he fought a little well just a moment ago. You think you can say anything just because you have an open mouth?\u201dRight then, the insides of the cave began to tremble.Koom! Koom! Koom!A giant creature could be seen moving towards them from the other side.The creature clearly looked like a hobgoblin, but it was many times larger than a normal one.Choi Chang Suk let go of Kang Yoonsoo\u2019s collars, and immediately put his hands on his sword hilt.A giant, red hobgoblin revealed itself soon after.Its giant machete on its hand glinted in ferocious light.\u201cKurororok-!\u201d[Giant Hobgoblin (Boss, Level 48) has appeared.]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Hey, Kang Yoonsoo! Come over and help!\u201dChoi Chang Suk shouted out urgently.But Kang Yoonsoo simply stood up slowly, and walked deeper into the cave.\u201cUseless bastard!\u201dWith a swear, Kim Minsoo took out his sword.He charged out and made a low swing with his sword.He was trying to run out by moving through the Giant Hobgoblin\u2019s ankle.But once the Giant Hobgoblin slammed its machete down, his body was pierced just like that.\u201cKyaaa\u2013!\u201dLee Yuri screamed at the violence in front of her.At the same time, she felt a shock coming from her back.Choi Chang Suk had kicked her away.She hit the ankle of the Giant Hobgoblin, and was killed by its machete.While the monster was occupied with Lee Yuri, Choi Chang Suk quickly ran.When he was about to reach the exit, the machete grazed his back.He grit his teeth, and activated his skill.\u201cMercenary\u2019s Fighting Spirit!\u201dHis eyes took on a crimson hue.He put all his strength into his sword, and swung it.Clang\u2013!The machete hit the sword, and let out sparks in midair.Choi Chang Suk was pushed away by the shock, and was shot out of the cave.He hit the dirt floor, and rolled.His sword broke, and his sword hand was burning with pain.\u201cU\u2026urk\u2026\u2026\u201dChoi Chang Suk stood up with much pain.His comrades were all dead.He had to live alone in the continent now.His eyes shined with a hateful light.The face of the one who ran away while he and his comrades were in danger was nailed in his mind.\u201cKang Yoonsoo\u2026\u2026. That bastard, I\u2019ll kill him.\u201dChoi Chang Suk began to hobble away from the cave.Right then, he could feel a weak shock from his back.Stab\u2013A giant machete pierced through his stomach.\u201cKuh\u2013!\u201dChoi Chang Suk knelt down as he spat out blood.The Giant Hobgoblin took out its machete from the body.The Boss Monster would not allow a single survivor.The Giant Hobgoblin walked back into the cave....Kang Yoonsoo arrived at the end of the cave.There was an altar created out of oxidized bones.On top of the altar, there was a rusted box.The thing that Lee Yuri detected as \u2018something amazing\u2019 was actually something in this box.Kang Yoonsoo touched the box gently.The box, which didn\u2019t even have a keyhole, seemed to be made so that one couldn\u2019t even open it.But when a person\u2019s hand touched it, the box began to tremble.Soon, a dark fog streamed out of the box, and flew upwards.Paa\u2013!The black fog took on a human-like shape.A voice filled with evil resounded through the cave.[Weak\u2026\u2026 foolish\u2026.

You think a weak little being like you would be able to take away my secret records I left for my future disciple?!]A long, long time ago, there used to be five legendary heroes who managed to fend off an attack from Pandemonium.Out of the five, there was Nakron, who was the darkest, and the evillest of the lot, but at the same time was the one who fought for the sake of the world.Kang Yoonsoo had awakened the corrupt soul of Nakron.[If you wish to open this box, you must destroy the child of the fire dragon from the moonless desert, and defeat the emperor of ice in the world of snow\u2026\u2026..]\u201cThe one who killed you was the King of All Creation.\u201d[W\u2026.hat?]The ancient hero, Nakron, said this with a confused voice.On the other hand, Kang Yoonsoo was very calm.He taught the ancient hero the ancient history that was hidden away from everyone.\u201cYou did not die due to the curse from the Great Demon of Pandemonium.

Occasionally, it is possible to use the soul as a reinforcement, or even insert it into a puppet.A rank of an item was divided into Normal-Rare-Unique-Legendary.A normal item was exceedingly common, rare items could be exchanged for a high price, unique items were extremely precious, and legendary items were able to change the entire map of the continent by itself.This item wasn\u2019t actually something one could attain so easily.One had to do things like kill the hatchling of Dragon Ignus in the desert of ruin, steal the heart of the Ice Emperor in the Aician Mountains, and more, in order to undo the seal on the box.As Kang Yoonsoo was someone who lived a thousand lives, he was able to unseal the box by forcefully tearing Nakron\u2019s soul away from the box.Kang Yoonsoo put on the Ring of Life Suppression on his hand.As his Power Gauntlet didn\u2019t cover his fingers, it was possible for him to put on the ring.He then opened the leather book.A bright light came from the book.[Would you like to advance into becoming the Last Necromancer?]The class \u201cLast Necromancer\u201d was truly excellent.His experience grew the more corpses he revived, and it was possible to revive as an undead after death.It was possible to easily subdue a high class undead, and his mana would multiply several times.Of course, there were side effects.Every time he revived corpses, his skin would rot, and turn into an undead.But if he turned into an undead with the price of turning his back to humanity, it was possible to make use of extremely powerful, corrupt mana.Kang Yoonsoo could remember becoming a lich and reviving a whole battlefield in his past life.But Kang Yoonsoo said this:\u201cI refuse.\u201dA long time ago, he created an undying army as a lich.But he was still killed by the Demon Emperor.The terminal\u2019s voice recognition system took in his voice.[You have refused to advance.

Slice-!The Giant Hobgoblin, who was struck at its temple, stumbled.Kang Yoonsoo bent down, and stabbed the Giant Hobgoblin\u2019s left breast with his spear.Stab-!A sharp blade slid through the Giant Hobgoblin, then a sound of the heart exploding came out.The Giant Hobgoblin fell.The ground shook lightly.[You have defeated the Giant Hobgoblin (Boss, Level 48).The experience gained by the undead will not be transferred to you.Your level rose 3 times.]Kang Yoonsoo took the machete that was in the hands of the dead Giant Hobgoblin.The giant monster used the machete with one hand, but to a human, the machete was a huge sword.[Steel Machete]Rank-NormalKilling Strength: 14A giant machete made out of good steel.Kang Yoonsoo threw away his sword and spear, and equipped the machete.He could feel the sword\u2019s weight when he wore it on his back.Then, he waited for the mana gained from the Life Suppression Ring to fill back up.During this time, Kang Yoonsoo distributed his stat points.He raised Strength by two, and Revival by one.The stat \u201cRevival\u201d allowed his undead to possess more strength, and resistance to various elements.His level was now 34.He could feel that his mana had completely filled up.Kang Yoonsoo stretched his hand out to the Giant Hobgoblin.\u201cMass Revival.\u201dAll the mana in his body was spent.The Giant Hobgoblin, which had been rampaging moments ago, rose with a pale, blue complexion.It had revived as a zombie.While its intelligence was still low, its power helped due to its massive size.Kang Yoonsoo raised his hand, and moved the 90 undead in front of him.Normally, one required a huge amount of concentration in order to control the undead, but Kang Yoonsoo accommplished this feat easily.His leadership was great enough to be able to control the skeletons while fighting, as seen before.The skeletons moved to the end of the cave.\u201cCorpse Explosion.\u201dOne of the skeletons at the cave wall exploded.Bang-!A shock that threatened to collapse the cave resounded, and the wall crumbled away to reveal what lay beyond.It was a cavern filled with various ores.\u201cMine it.\u201dKang Yoonsoo commanded this to the skeletons as he put on Kim Minsoo\u2019s bag....After storing the undead away into the Summoning Dimension, Kang Yoonsoo walked out of the cave.By the time the sun began to set, he arrived at a town.Kellin, a rural fief.It was a place that boasted desolate lands that were somehow cultivated by the humans.The farmers finished working, and went home, and the travelers laughed amongst themselves as they walked into the taverns,The golden wheat in the fields and the sweet smell of beer tickled one\u2019s nose as they walked.The dirt road was created very skillfully. It seemed that it could even hold itself even when the king came with his carriage.It was different from the cruel reality.There were no one who were stressed about life.The people in the fiefdom smile even after working as much as they could.Truly, it was a place that seemed calm and comforting, even to those who never visited before.But Kang Yoonsoo\u2019s face did not change at all.The beautiful scenery, the laughters of the people, and the bright sun.None of it could stir his emotionless heart.Kang Yoonsoo kept walking.\u201cWait!\u201dA man in beggar-like clothing stopped him.The man, even with his giant body, seemed to be quite handsome.\u201cAre you a Traveler, as well?\u201dThe man asked this with nervousness.Kang Yoonsoo quietly pointed to his terminal.The only way to distinguish Travelers from natives of this world was to see if one had a terminal or not.\u201cThat\u2019s good. I just arrived here a few days ago. Since there were not many Travelers in this area, I\u2019ve been staying here alone.\u201dThe man hesitated a bit, then opened his mouth.\u201cWould you like to travel together with me? After all, two is better than one, right? I don\u2019t have money or anything, but I am quite strong.\u201dKang Yoonsoo looked over the man with emotionless eyes.He then opened his mouth.\u201cListen to me carefully, Icion.\u201d\u201cEh?\u201dIcion made a surprised face.He didn\u2019t even inctroduce himself. How did the man in front of him even know his name?\u201cWork in the butchering company without changing your class. No one does it because it\u2019s dirty and disgusting, but you must do it. Do not fear touching the guts of hen and the spines of pigs. Treat a bloody knife even better than your women. Once you butcher about a hundred creatures, a man-eating beast will come for you. Do not be afraid, and strike the crown of its head. That is its only weakness, and the source of nutrients for the butcher.\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201dKang Yoonsoo continued on without answering Icion\u2019s question.\u201cRun from Kellin as soon as you kill the beast. The beasts will come find you, in order to kill you. On the first night, 1. On the third night, 3. You should be able to take care of them, as long as you are not sleeping. Be careful of your left eye. In the past, there was a case where you lost your left eye due to sleeping. Once you killed up to 5 beasts, you will be given a chance to become the Barbarian King.\u201d\u201cB, Barbarian King?\u201d\u201cThe class \u2018Barbarian King\u2019 was the class you liked the most in your life. Your strength and stamina increases whenever you drink blood, and you may earn much from butchering animals. Become the Barbarian King, and head North. You will be able to meet me again, at that point.\u201dBefore Icion could even say anything, Kang Yoonsoo walked away after saying this:\u201cBecome a part of my force when we meet again.\u201dIcion looked at the man\u2019s back for a bit, then turned around.He was a bit hesitant.This was an advice from a man he never saw.But he knew too little about this world, and had nothing to do anyway.Icion headed for the butchering company.Kang Yoonsoo was walking silently, but in his head, he was thinking of the man from a while ago.Icion.The man who trusted him at any of his lives.Kang Yoonsoo gave Icion this advice, because he trusted the man.But he wouldn\u2019t work with Icion at this point.Icion was a very talented man.It was better for him to work alone.He was going to be a part of Kang Yoonsoo\u2019s group in the future anyway.Only she could be a part of his group in the start.When he walked up the hill, he was able to find a small mansion.A soldier, who had his helmet pressed down on his head a bit too much, stopped Kang Yoonsoo.\u201cWho are you? Do you have business with lord Hermia?\u201dThe guard looked at Kang Yoonsoo with a curious gaze.Unlike the people of the fief, the soldiers of the fief had to fight off landworms and the likes in the desolate lands, so they were quite alert, and powerful.Because Kang Yoonsoo didn\u2019t want to talk, he simply showed the contents of his bag to the soldier.The bag was filled with unrefined ores.Every single one of the ores, however, were exceedingly rare and expensive.As long as one handled these right, it was possible for him to buy several fiefs.While ores were quite rough compared to the refined jewels itself, some of the rarer ones allowed people to see that it was of high grade.The soldier\u2019s expression couldn\u2019t be seen because of his helmet, but the soldier\u2019s tone had gotten a little more careful.\u201cWhat do you need in our fief? It would be better to look for a bigger trading post elsewhere if you\u2019re looking to trade those off.\u201d\u201cI have business with your lord.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dBusiness with the lord?Even though the lord of Kellin was quite peculiar, there was no way the lord of a rural fief had money enough to trade for these ores.Kang Yoonsoo spoke in a low, calm tone.\u201cTell your lord that the one who can use the Pearl of The Covenant has come.\u201dThe Pearl of The Covenant.It was a treasure from an ancient era.It was a hidden piece that would help him in his journey.Kang Yoonsoo looked up at the windows of the mansion.\u201cShe should\u2019ve heard my voice already, though.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I am the lord of Kellin. Please forgive the guard here for being rude. I took the child in at a young age, and this person prefers to hide their face because of some burn marks. What is your name?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m Kang Yoonsoo. As you said, I am a traveler.\u201d\u201cAs elves have very good ears, I was able to overhear what you were talking about outside.

Oh my. Oh my. Oh my. Oh, oh. My, my.\u201dThe guard bowed down a bit, and looked at Hermia.The guard definitely had a worried face under the helmet.\u201cDo you want me to get some tea?\u201d\u201cY, yes. Put in a lot of tea leaves. In his cup. Be careful of the fire.\u201dThe guard exited the guest room.Hermia put her hands on her forehead, then moaned as if she was in anguish.She then proceeded to slowly take off her gown.Her white skin and voluptuous chest mixed with the sunlight and glowed lightly.\u201cCan you check if my heart is still fine?\u201dKang Yoonsoo put his hand on the lord\u2019s breasts.\u201cIt\u2019s still beating.\u201d\u201cReally? That\u2019s good. I was so surprised a while ago, I thought my heart had stopped.\u201dHermia put her robes back on.Normally, such an event would\u2019ve made a normal man and woman blush, but this was not the case for the two people here.Hermia stroked her red cheeks, as if she was trying to calm her excitement.\u201cI was really\u2026. Really surprised. To think that I\u2019d hear the words of the scripture that the Lefei Clan was guarding for four hundred years not from an elf nor human, but a traveler from a different world.\u201dThe scriptures from the Ignus Dragon.There was a prophecy in the elven race that the person who would take the shard of strength from the Pearl of The Covenant would come. It was stated that that person would come whilst uttering the words of the scriptures.\u201cHow did you find out about the Pearl of The Covenant? And the scriptures of the Ignus Dragon?\u201dKang Yoonsoo silently shook his head.His story wasn\u2019t something that was very believable.Since he uttered the words of the scripture, if he explained things properly, Hermia would believe him. However, there was no need for him to do this.\u201cAlright. I won\u2019t try and pry into your business. After all, the Lefei Clan is only acting as a witness, anyway.\u201dHermia took a deep breath, and began to talk.\u201cThe ancestor of the Lefei Cla\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThe ancestor of the Lefei Clan, the glorious archer Nillion was a great warrior who served beside King Siryan. It is said that the desolate desert formed when Nillion, who was the leader of the elves at the time, lost in a battle against the Ignus Dragon, and had his forest and its surroundings burned to ashes. But this was a lie. In reality, Nillion and the Ignus Dragon had hidden the Pearl of The Covenant in order to prepare for the lord of darkness who will appear in the future. It is the duty of the Lefei Clan to find the person who is destined to inherit the shard of strength from the Ignus Dragon.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dHermia\u2019s eyes widened.Kang Yoonsoo had just summarized everything she was about to say.Unlike her, who had an expression of immense surprise on her face, Kang Yoonsoo had a very bored one.\u201cI didn\u2019t want to hear the long version.\u201dKang Yoonsoo said this, and stood up.It was when Hermia was unable to recover from her shock.\u201cI brought tea. Ah.\u201dThe guard who brought the tray of teacups stumbled, and fell forward.Kang Yoonsoo extended a hand, and supported the guard\u2019s chest.With the other hand, he grabbed the tray.Tak.It was all done in one, smooth movement. It was almost as if he had expected all this to happen.Not a single drop of tea had been spilled.Kang Yoonsoo put to tray on the table.He then took a teacup, and put it on his dry lips.He slowly took a sip, and spoke.\u201cDisgusting. As always.\u201dBoth Hermia, and the guard in his hands looked at Kang Yoonsoo dumbly.Kang Yoonsoo spoke.\u201cI need something before seeing the Pearl of The Covenant.\u201d...The thing that Kang Yoonsoo had asked for was alcohol.He said that out of all the expensive drinks stored in the mansion, he needed the strongest one.Hermia told the guard to give him the drink.\u201cIt\u2019s good that you came here.\u201dThe guard said this whilst looking through the storage room.Kang Yoonsoo had followed the guard, and was leaning against an old stone wall.The guard threw a bag of empty bottles to the side, and kept talking.\u201cIt is truly a pity that lord Hermia is stuck at a rural area like this. She had taken in an orphan like me at a young age, and she is quite a beautiful person. She had told me several times about the task of the Lefei Clan. Now, lord Hermia will be able to escape from the stressful wheel of responsibility.\u201d\u201cDo you think Hermia is beautiful.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that what you\u2019d usually think?\u201dThe guard asked this in response.Kang Yoonsoo grabbed a random hand mirror off a floor.He spoke in a low tone.\u201cI know someone more beautiful than her.\u201d\u201cI\u2019d like to see someone like that. You see, I lived in Kellin since I was young, so I\u2019ve never been anywhere else in my life.\u201d\u201cYou can see her too.\u201d\u201cHow surprising. How would I be able to meet her?\u201d\u201cTake off your helmet, and look at the mirror.\u201dThe guard\u2019s gloves, which were searching through a pile of objects, suddenly stopped.It was only possible to see her from the back, but it was easy to tell that she was angered.The guard\u2019s voice became cold.\u201c\u2026\u2026.You\u2019re calling a person filled with burn marks, who has hairs falling out in patches beautiful? What a bad joke.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t like jokes.\u201d\u201cYou talk like an old man who\u2019s sick of the world.\u201d\u201cBecause I\u2019m tired.\u201dSoon enough, the guard found the bottle of alcohol.It was a very strong bottle of whisky.She stood up, and walked towards the door.Right then, a single mouse ran across the dusty floor of the room.The guard grabbed the mouse\u2019s tail, and began to tickle its stomach.A small laughter sounded out from the helmet.\u201cHahaha\u2026\u2026. Mm.\u201dThe guard became conscious of Kang Yoonsoo watching her, and tried to put the mouse back on the floor.\u201cSqueak!\u201d\u201cAhh!\u201dRight that moment, the mouse jumped up, and climbed into the helmet.The mouse moved around everywhere inside the helmet as it squeaked.The guard dropped the helmet on the floor out of confusion.The guard\u2019s eyes met with Kang Yoonsoo\u2019s.She truly looked wretched.Her hair was falling out in random patches, and her dead scalp was all shriveled up.Her face, and everywhere below it was full of burn marks, and it was hard to see anywhere that was untouched by fire.The guard, who had dropped the mouse, quickly covered her face with her hands.\u201cDon\u2019t look at me!\u201dShe shouted out sharply.She would rather die than show herself to others.Especially to an attractive young man like this.She had covered her face, but she still felt an immense amount of shame.Kang Yoonsoo tapped her shoulders lightly.When she opened her eyes slowly, Kang Yoonsoo handed her the helmet with an emotionless face.She quickly put on her helmet, and bit her lips.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cWhy.\u201d\u201cYou saw my face. I\u2019m sorry\u2026\u2026 for making you see something so disgusting.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not disgusting.\u201dIt was an unexpected answer.The guard stayed silent for a bit, then carefully asked a question.\u201cAren\u2019t I scary?\u201d\u201cNot at all.\u201dThe guard was confused.Normally, a man who saw her face would either be extremely shocked, or be angered.But Kang Yoonsoo was different.He didn\u2019t seem affected by her appearance. On the contrary, he was completely indifferent to it.But it wasn\u2019t like he was very polite, either.He didn\u2019t seem like a bad person, even though he seemed completely indifferent to the world.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dKang Yoonsoo spoke....\u201cThis should be good.\u201dIt was a big wasteland.It was a place that almost seemed too empty.On this land where not even a single blade of grass grew, were three people.Hermia took out a red marble.It was the Pearl of The Covenant.The marble was a little too big to grab with one hand, and was crimson red, as if it was imbued with fire.She carefully put down the Peal of The Covenant on the wasteland.\u201cAccording to the stories that were passed down by my ancestors, it is said that the Pearl of The Covenant contains a shard of strength from the Ignus Dragon. But it is also said that one has to go through a terrifying challenge in order to take the shard of strength. A challenge that is dangerous enough to make you risk your life.\u201dIt was possible to get support from the soldiers for safety, but Kang Yoonsoo refused the help.Kang Yoonsoo took a look at the guard.The guard, slightly nervous, handed him the bottle of whisky with a stagger.She asked him a question.\u201cExcuse me for asking this, but what are you going to use this for?\u201d\u201cRight, I\u2019m curious as well.\u201dHermia asked as well.Kang Yoonsoo did not respond, and put the bottle of whisky on his waist.He walked forward slowly, and put his finger on the Pearl.He then opened his mouth.\u201cThe one who has walked in the desolate desert without end, will finally return to the eternal illusion at the edge of the burning flame.\u201dThey were scriptures of the Ignus Dragon that had been modified a little.At that moment, the Pearl of The Covenant began to break apart.The pearl began to emit a red glow.Hermia and the guard quickly moved away.A blinding light covered the area, then a big shadow appeared from the Pearl.\u201cI sense a person who is to inherit the shard of strength nearby.\u201dIt was a Spartoi.Rough scales were covering its entire body.It was about four meters tall, with well-proportioned muscles.It seemed to be a mix between a human male, and a red dragon.There was a thick spear in its big hands.[A Spartoi(clone) of the Ignus Dragon has appeared.Passing its test would allow the chosen one to get a reward.Being unable to pass the test would make you have to face the Spartoi\u2019s wrath.]\u201cAre you the one who is trying to inherit the power of the great one.\u201dKang Yoonsoo did not respond.The Spartoi held up its spear.\u201cI, the Spartoi of the Ignus Dragon, shall test you. Only by passing my test will you be able to attain the shard of strength.\u201dThe Spartoi lightly swung its spear.Vuun\u2013.It just moved its spear a bit, but the sound of the spear cutting through the air was extremely fierce.Hermia and the guard, who were watching from the sidelines, swallowed in nervousness.Flap.A red cloth floated down from the air.The cloth landed on Kang Yoonsoo\u2019s eyes, and covered it completely.The Spartoi pointed its spear at Kang Yoonsoo, and spoke.\u201cFight me blindfolded. It\u2019s fine whether you use magic or dolls. If you take me down, I will accept your strength. I will, of course, give you time to practice.\u201dThe two people that were watching were astounded.Fight the Spartoi blindfolded?Surely this was a feat that was impossible for any sword master.This truly was a test meant for those who were masters of battle.\u201cWait.\u201dKang Yoonsoo put up his right hand.The Spartoi, who had been raising its spear for battle, stopped.Kang Yoonsoo took off the cap from the bottle of whisky.The eyes of Hermia and the guard were filled with curiosity.If it was that man, he would definitely do something ingenious with the whisky.Just what would he do?Glug. Glug,Kang Yoonsoo drank the whisky unreservedly.He emptied the bottle in an instant.He threw away the bottle, and took out his machete.\u201cI don\u2019t need any practice. Let\u2019s start.\u201dHermia and the guard made a shocked face, and looked at each other.\u201cDid he ask me to bring the whisky just because he wanted to drink it?\u201d\u201cIs he fighting blindfolded and drunk?\u201dIt was so surprising, it made them feel annoyed.To them, it seemed that Kang Yoonsoo was determined to kill himself.The Spartoi frowned.\u201cI will fight with my full strength. You might even lose your life. Are you that confident of winning against me?\u201d\u201cUhuh.\u201d\u201cYou, you are an arrogant man!\u201dThe Spartoi\u2019s sharp spear struck forward towards Kang Yoonsoo.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Even so, seeing a man who\u2019s not even blind make those movements are quite amazing.\u201dHermia watched the fight without even remembering to cover her open mouth.A red tornado appeared whenever the Spartoi swung its spear.Kang Yoonsoo dodged all its attacks, as if he had expected all its moves.The Spartoi wasn\u2019t fazed one bit, and kept swinging and stabbing with its spear.After the spear grazed his shoulder lightly, Kang Yoonsoo immediately struck upwards with his machete for the first time.Clang!The Spartoi\u2019s spear and the giant machete struck each other.The Spartoi, who was in a light defending stance, was unable to hide its amazement.\u201cAmazing! So you weren\u2019t just arrogant, but confident. Being able to execute such intricate moves blindfolded\u2026 it would not be a stretch to call you the strongest swordsman in the entire continent.\u201dIt was the best compliment that could come out of a swordsman\u2019s mouth.Kang Yoonsoo did not respond, and kept swinging his machete.Whenever he swung it, the strength that was wrapped around his hands exploded outwards.The Spartoi repeatedly blocked Kang Yoonsoo\u2019s attacks with a sharp gaze.Clang-! Clang-! Clang-!The giant sword struck blows with the spear multiple times.Every time they met, sparks flew out.\u201cYour skills are flawless. But it looks like I am above you in strength!\u201dThe Spartoi changed its grip on the spear, and suddenly struck downwards.It was a move that was unforeseen by everyone.But Kang Yoonsoo, instead of being cut in two pieces, lightly parried away the spear with his giant sword.It was a move that completely predicted the opponent\u2019s moves.After the exchange, Kang Yoonsoo and the Spartoi moved back.The Spartoi let out a pompous laugh.\u201cInteresting! Truly, this is fascinating! I probably would not be able to meet a fearsome swordsman like you for the rest of my lifetime. I look forward to see what you would accomplish in the future!\u201dHermia and the guard swallowed.A swordsman that the Spartoi complimented to that degree\u2026.Kang Yoonsoo was a greater person than any of them ever thought.But Kang Yoonsoo, in reality, felt no danger at all from the battle.Although he could not see, he could see.The trajectory of the attack, the movements of the Spartoi, even the breathing around him.Kang Yoonsoo put back his sword. The Spartoi\u2019s eyes twitched.\u201cYou. Are you giving up on the test?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dAfter a short reply, Kang Yoonsoo stretched out his right hand.\u201cSummon 92 skeletons. Summon Giant Hobgoblin Zombie.\u201dA black darkness flowered out, and an undead army was summoned from it.The visage of the undead army at broad daylight was extremely frightening.\u201cKyaa! U, undead!\u201dHermia screamed, then fainted. The guard quickly supported her.Even the Spartoi made a surprised face.\u201cYou were a necromancer?\u201dKang Yoonsoo ignored the question, and pointed at the Spartoi.\u201cKill.\u201d\u201cKaah!\u201dThe Skeleton army took up its weapons, and ran at the Spartoi.The Spartoi widely swung its spear.The Skeletons near it broke to pieces.The Giant Hobgoblin Zombie charged forward, and bit the Spartoi\u2019s shoulders.Fresh blood exploded out.Kang Yoonsoo watched from afar.Even though he was unable to see, his eyes were pointed straight at the Spartoi.He took out some throwing knives from his pocket.They were something he picked up from someone he killed a while back.Kang Yoonsoo stepped forward once, and threw two knives at once.The knives flew through the ribs of the skeletons, grazed past the shoulder of the Giant Hobgoblin Zombie, cut through the air, and reached the Spartoi.Blood sprayed out of both its eyes.It was an accuracy that was seemingly impossible to have come from a blind man.Even though it must\u2019ve been suffering from immense pain, the Spartoi simply clenched its teeth and suppressed its scream.But there was no doubt that its eyesight had suffered.Kang Yoonsoo spoke.\u201cNow we\u2019re fighting with the same handicap.\u201d\u201cWhat a wicked method\u2026. But well done!\u201dThe Spartoi pointed forward with its spear, and charged forward with a scream.In an instant, twelve skeletons broke apart.But that was it.Due to its loss of sight, the Spartoi became unaware of its surroundings.The attacks from the skeletons behind him gave him many wounds.\u201cAway!\u201dThe Spartoi swung its spear violently.But the only thing the spear hit was empty air.The loss of its sight alone made the Spartoi lose all its fighting strength.There was only darkness around the Spartoi.But under the same condition, Kang Yoonsoo was able to perform magnificently with his sword.It was a moment where the difference in skill between the two became extremely clear.Due to the attacks of the undead army, the wounds of the Spartoi kept increasing.Kang Yoonsoo ran forward with his machete.Even though he could not see, the course of his path was straight.Kang Yoonsoo stabbed out at the chest of the blind Spartoi.Crack-! (TL: Sound is actually a mix of flesh being stabbed+bones cracking, but I didn\u2019t have the proper sfx for it.)The giant sword pierced the heart.[You have taken down the Spartoi(clone) of the Ignus Dragon.You have passed the Spartoi\u2019s test.The chosen one may inherit the shard of strength.]The actual Spartoi of the Ignus Dragon was much, much stronger than this.The enemy had been weakened considerably due to the difficulty of the test.Since it was a clone, it was unable to collect its soul using the ring.When he passed the test, the corpse of the Spartoi crumbled away.The piece of cloth that covered Kang Yoonsoo\u2019s eyes also disappeared.Only the spear and a lump of red light remained.Due to the immense amount of energy that seemed to have condensed into the light, a fierce aura emanated out of the lump.[Shard of Strength]Rank-??The remnant of the giant power the Ignus Dragon left behind. Only the chosen one can inherit it.\u201cSo this is the shard of strength that\u2026\u2026. The Ignus Dragon left behind.\u201dHermia, who had recovered some time ago, made an amazed face.She looked like she could cry at any given moment.The mission given to her clan had finally ended at her generation.Hermia nodded as she looked at Kang Yoonsoo.\u201cNow, please inherit the power of the shard of strength. It finally looks like the shard of strength has found its owner.\u201d\u201cI do not have the qualifications.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.What?\u201dKang Yoonsoo looked at the shard of strength.It raised your strength, and gave to an invulnerability to fire and heat.It is possible to control flames.As you grew, even more strength was released from it.He spoke again.\u201cI am not the one who is supposed to take the shard of strength.\u201dHermia made a confused face.This was an answer she did not expect.She spoke with a stutter.\u201cW, what do you mean? Even the Spartoi said that there was a person with the qualifications here.\u201dKang Yoonsoo brought his finger to the lump of light.Crackle!Even though the finger touched the light for a second, a violent spark came out.The shard was rejecting Kang Yoonsoo.Hermia looked as if she was about to cry.\u201cI, if it\u2019s not you, then who is it?\u201d\u201cThat person.\u201dKang Yoonsoo pointed somewhere.Hermia turned her head.She became extremely surprised.The guard, surprised, pointed at herself.\u201cM\u2026\u2026me?\u201d\u201cThe one chosen by the Ignus dragon forms a predatory relationship with fire from birth.\u201dKang Yoonsoo put the lump of light on one hand.The moment flames burst out of the shard, he threw it towards the guard.When the ball of fire flew towards her, the guard became afraid, and tried to run.But the lump of light followed her, as if it was pulled by a magnetic power, and struck her chest.Crackle-!The guard\u2019s entire body burst up in flames.Hermia paled at the image.The fire that surrounded the guard became even stronger.But the guard did not shout one bit.The fire was not hot.It was just warm.Crack-.The helmet of the guard broke away.Her long hair flowed down to her back.\u201cOh my!\u201dHermia spoke surprisedly.Her face was beautiful.The woman who took in fire seemed to be pretty like a doll, prettier than anything else in the world.Her armor broke apart.The cloth covering her burned away.She was like a butterfly that was breaking out of its cocoon, frail and beautiful.Hermia shook her head, and asked a question.\u201cS, Shanette, are you alright?\u201d\u201cI, it\u2019s not hot. I\u2019m fine. Please don\u2019t look at me. I don\u2019t want to show anyone my face.\u201dThe guard, no, Shanette tried best to stay calm.The fire that enveloped her disappeared.But a part of her heart was still hot.Rather than being embarrassed by showing her naked body, she was more ashamed of showing her face to others.Shanette quickly covered her face.She didn\u2019t want to show her filthy face.The moment she covered her face with her hands,She realized that she could not feel the burns on her face.\u201cEh\u2026\u2026?\u201dShanette widened her eyes, then looked at her own body.Her clothes had all burned away, and her naked body was shown.There wasn\u2019t even time to be ashamed.The burns on her body had disappeared completely.When she touched her cheeks with a trembling hand, a frighteningly smooth skin could be felt.When Shanette was still trying to recover from her shock, Kang Yoonsoo approached her.He took out a mirror, and gave it to her.Shanette looked inside the mirror.The woman at the other side seemed equally confused.It was a face that she hadn\u2019t seen for a long time.It was her face, the face she had forgotten for a long time.It was amazing.Her burn marks were erased, and she recovered the body she possessed prior to the accident.She was happy, but confused at the same time.It was just half a day.In just half a day, Kang Yoonsoo had healed someone with irrecoverable wounds.Shanette spoke with a trembling voice.\u201cWhat\u2026\u2026 what happened to my body?\u201dKang Yoonsoo responded emotionlessly.\u201cWhy are you so surprised. Nothing changed.\u201dIt was a strange response.Shanette was unable to shake her curiosity.\u201c\u2026\u2026.Why are you being so kind so a person you saw for the first time\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t do anything that would negatively affect me.\u201dKang Yoonsoo spoke.His eyes didn\u2019t change at all from before.\u201cYou, come with me.\u201dAfter processing those words for a bit, Shanette realized a single change.After her burns disappeared, Kang Yoonsoo began to speak more unreservedly to her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Striking the tip would improve its piercing power.But if one failed the control the strength and speed in which he struck the sword, the strengthening would fail.Tools that failed in getting strengthened would get their attack strength and durability damaged greatly.Not even a blacksmith with about 20 years of experience could strengthen something in one try.It was possible to strengthen something without the stone, with the skill \u2018Tool Strengthening\u2019, which was a skill unique to Upgraders.It was possible for users of that class to use the strengthening stone to modify tools, even.Kang Yoonsoo struck the machete with his sword.Kangkang-!

Whoop.\u201dShe breathed deeply.She spun her hand in a narrow motion.She focused intensely.Then an amazing phenomenon took place.The flames which had been the subject of her fear and trauma felt very close and familiar.She was the fire, and the fire was her.Red flames were added, around her, making the fire stronger.Whirl-!Thrrk! Thrk!Not able to withstand the rising heat, the melting pot began to shake.Kang Yoonsoo fiddled with the life suppressing ring.There existed 4 types of spirits in the continent of Sylphia.Salamander, the fire spirit.Icicle, the ice spirit.Bright, the light spirit.Sharpness, the sword spirit.It was the Salamander spirit that Kang Yoonsoo was trying to create.The first step in the process of creating the spirit was to prepare a raw flesh that would make up the spirit\u2019s boy.The raw material was the most important element in the creation of the spirit.It was because the strength of the spirit was determined by the quality of the raw material.The raw material needed to create the Salamander was the dragon\u2019s breath.Dragon mercenary\u2019s spear has been added to the melting pot, but compared to the real dragon breath it wasn\u2019t worth the fire on the tip of a candle.Thus, Shanette walked into the melting pot in order to make the fire even much hotter.It was to enhance the ingredients foundation.Shanette moaned inside the melting pot.\u201cIs this enough heat?\u201d\u201cMore.\u201dWhen Shanette focused more intensely, the fire became even more powerful.The melting pot shook as if it was about to explode.\u201cStill not enough?\u201d\u201cMore.\u201d\u201cYeeeaaaahh!\u201dThe overpowering heat escaped the melting pot.It caused Kang Yoonsoo to feel the heat on his face.However, he was not satisfied.He waited patiently.Soon, one of the internal equipment of the melting pot quietly exploded unable to withstand the heat.Kwaaang!\u201cYikeee!\u201d\u201cAre you OK.\u201dThe nonchalant words of Kang Yoonsoo did not console Shanette, at all.The temperature rose up to the maximum.Now, even the actual part of the melting pot began to melt.Shanette was shaken.Even she felt the heat at this level of temperature.It was hot enough that even she felt like she couldn\u2019t endure it.Unable to tolerate much longer, she extended her hand out towards the iron door of the melting pot.Thruck.The iron door did not open.The lock has been melted down due to the heat.There was not even enough energy to even try hitting the iron door.Thrrrruk!A small sound came from the iron door.Pazzz-!Kang Yoonsoo\u2019s great sword crushed the half melted iron door.Extending out his arm, he grabbed her shoulder and pulled her out.Even though his gloves were on fire and his hand burned, Kang Yoonsoo did not show much reaction.\u201cCough! Cough!\u201dShanette coughed suddenly.Even the closed up space felt cold.Kang Yoonsoo pulled her to him and hugged her quickly.With that, he felt slightly warm.Taking off his clothes, Kang Yoonsoo used them to cover up Shanette.\u201cIs, is this sufficient now?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dAt that moment, strong light was being emitted out.Not able to withstand the heat, the melting pot was about to explode.When the iron shrapnel was about to shoot out everywhere, Kang Yoonsoo extended his right hand which had the ring on.\u201cSpirit creation, Salamander.\u201dKwaaang-!In the end, the melting pot has exploded.The red hot iron pieces of the melting pot splashed out in to all directions.However, not even a single piece of the shrapnel came towards Kang Yoonsoo.Black smoke filled the area.\u201cAh!\u201dAppearing to be surprised, Shanette was amazed.The flames, which were inside the melting pot, converged into a single body of fire.The heat was mild.Soothing flame that engulfed the violently pitching flames congregated in a spherical shape and floated in the air.The external appearance was like an embryo.[Please indicate the gender of the salamander, the fire spirit.

Mom. I don\u2019t have them?\u201d\u201cRight, you have no parents.\u201dKang Yoonsoo said without much meaning.\u201cYou\u2019re a life form that I have created.

Why are you asking me to\u2026..?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know how to soothe a crying child.\u201dShanette leered at Kang Yoonsoo.\u201cNeither do I?\u201d\u201cThen just watch the area burn.\u201d\u201c\u2026..Mean person, you are.\u201dUp to this point, Shanette has never had the experience of having consoled a child.It was because whenever she would approach the children in the village, they would either pick on her, or cry when they saw her hideous face.In the mean time, the fire got bigger and spread to the surrounding area.Shanette, who had received the sculpture of power, was OK, but the fire could grow to, and even burn, the territory.Sensing the urgency, Shanette shouted what she was thinking.\u201c\u2026.Child! Don\u2019t cry. I, I\u2019ll be your mommy!\u201dThe girl suddenly stopped crying.The fire that was engulfing the room also became smaller.Crying, the girl asked.\u201c\u2026..Mommy?\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m still too young to have a child\u2026..\u201d\u201cAaaaang!\u201dAs the spirit cried again, the fire spread to the area.Surprised, Shanette said.\u201cAh, Alright. Then I\u2019ll be your mommy. For a while, at least.\u201d\u201c\u2026..Sniffle! Really?\u201d\u201cYah\u2026 Really.\u201d\u201cWhoaaa!\u201dOnly then the girl stopped crying, and grinningly smiled.It was a pure and beautiful smile.Looking at this pure girl smile like this, she couldn\u2019t unsay what she has just said.\u201cMommy, put, put me down.\u201d\u201cOK.\u201dThe girl stood on her two feet and tightly hugged Shanette\u2019s waist.It was a simple hug, but Shanette was surprised.When was the last time that she had hugged like this with another person, besides Hermione?Taking her face off of Shanette, the girl smiled brightly as she took a big breath.\u201cI like mommy! Love you!\u201dSmiling naively, the girl gave a dainty kiss on Shanette\u2019s cheek.As she was such an adorable child, Shanette was amazed for some reason.The salamander pulled Shanette\u2019s overcoat.\u201cMommy, give me a name.\u201d\u201cA name?\u201dShanette didn\u2019t know what to do.How could someone ask for a name that will be attached to herself, from someone like her?As she attempted to think for a while, a good name did not come to her mind.Then Kang Yoonsoo quietly spoke.\u201cSally.\u201dIt was certain that the name came from the sounds of salamander.Even though she thought it was an extremely simple name, the girl nodded with a big motion.\u201cI like that name!\u201dWhen the name was given to the spirit, a message came on to the terminal.[Sally]Level: 42Race: SalamanderAge: Child agePower: 4Magic power: 17Fire power: 21Skills possessed: Wrath of flame (Lv1), Fire armor (Lv1)The spirit that was just been born. She has tender and pure character. She is limitlessly na\u00efve, and likes to be protected.Kang Yoonsoo looked at the girl who was like a doll.Sally.Even Kang Yoonsoo was really surprised when the fire spirit was created for the first time in his life.So the first thing that had come to his mind, Sally, had been given to her as her name.Although he could have given her a better name, the name Sally has ultimately continued to the present life time.Up to this time, the fire spirit has never been created by using raw materials that weren\u2019t the spears of the dragon mercenaries.If that had been so then, instead of Sally that he remembered, another form of salamander would be born.As only one kind of spirit could be created, other spirits would become entities that could not be seen forever.\u201cA fight against the destroyer dragon must be avoided this time, too.\u2019How despondent was he when Sally\u2019s head was torn up by the jaws of the destroyer dragon.In his past lives, he has recreated Sally many times, and witnessed Sally\u2019s death many times, also.\u2018I couldn\u2019t see this child\u2019s death in this life time.\u2019Sally was one of the many reasons to why Kang Yoonsoo had to kill the demon king.Kang Yoonsoo gestured to Sally.The tiny girl quickly ran towards Kang Yoonsoo.It was a short moment.The approaching girl was being overlapped with the many appearances of Sally\u2019s past lives.As if he lost the track of the time, his vision became blurred.\u2018\u2026..I need wine.\u2019Rubbing off his forehead, Kang Yoonsoo chased away the illusionUnlike his inner mind, this was the reason why he would become void of feelings.Due to the visions of the past lives\u2019 memories that he couldn\u2019t forget, his mind could not be in a perfect condition.\u201cSally.\u201d\u201cUm!\u201dWhen she heard her name called, Sally\u2019s orange eyes sparkled.Kang Yoonsoo said in all seriousness.\u201cGo to the summoning world, tired.\u201d\u201c\u2026..Then, are you going to be Sally\u2019s daddy?\u201dKang Yoonsoo did not like to be called that.That was because as the relationship became more emotionally attaching, it would be difficult to overcome the emotions rising from her death.However, it was even too much trouble for him to say otherwise.\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWhoa! Sally loves daddy, too!\u201dJumping joyously, Sally kissed Kang Yoonsoo\u2019s cheek, too.Then she disappeared without even a trace.Without much response, Kang Yoonsoo lied down in the room that had been burned.As Shanette looked at him with an expression of disbelief, Kang Yoonsoo replied, lying down.\u201cWhat are you looking at.\u201d* * *The next morning, at the front of the residence.Hermione, with a sad look, hugged Shanette\u201cO, Shanette, what is to happen. How did I not know, when I am so close, that your fate is much harsher than mine.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s alright. I can manage it.\u201dShanette replied confidently.Taking the proposal of Kang Yoonsoo, she has decided to go on a journey with him.The sculpture of power was a treasure left by the Ignus Dragon for the future descendants.As long as she was in possession of it, she couldn\u2019t just remain in the Kellyine Territory.Shanette was nervous, but also excited in another way.It was because she has been thinking about achieving independence, and go beyond the territory of Kellyine.\u201cI have not gone outside of Kellyine ever since I got here. I want to put my eyes on a new place and see more new things.\u201d\u201cI want to give you a chariot if it was up to me, but\u2026.. Unfortunately, the conditions in the territory do not allow me to do that. I should have left at least two ponies before the trade merchants left here, last time.\u201d\u201cThis is sufficient.\u201dShanette smiled and she showed the backpack which she got used to.Inside it was filled with money for the travel, and necessary supplies that Hermione personally prepared for her.After a long time of blubbering, Hermione let go of Shanette.She looked at Kang Yoonsoo who was standing next to her.\u201cPlease take care of Shanette.\u201dKang Yoonsoo nodded subtly.After asking that, Hermione took a peek at Shanette.She was wearing tight pants and short shirt which were good active wears.\u201cYour shirt collar is all wrinkled up. Can you come over here for a moment?\u201dHermione brought Shanette to the left side of the residence.Turning her head, she put on a serious expression.It was certainly different than the blubbering expression that she had on just recently.\u201cShanette, what do you think about that man?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think he is a bad person.\u201d\u201cI feel that too. But, something about him bothers me.\u201dShanette gave a curious look.\u201cAs you know, elf lives a long time. Even though the external appearance does not get old, that is. Sometimes, it occurs that the youngest looking elf, among all the elves, turns out to be the oldest one. So, our perspectives in looking at people are different than humans.\u201dHermione gave Kang Yoonsoo, who was at yonder, a strange look.\u201cThat man, Kang Yoonsoo, I feel that he is very similar to an elf. He looks young like us, but he seems much older inside.\u201d\u201cAre you saying that Kang Yoonsoo has been living for hundreds of years?\u201d\u201cCertainly, it couldn\u2019t be since he is a human\u2026.But it is true that I feel a strange incompatibility. He seems to have been living for a very long time. Something\u2026. Different from us.\u201dShanette could not understand Hermione, but she nodded anyway.As she has lived for hundreds of years, she would be much wiser than her.\u201cJust in case if you feel that he is strange or you believe your life is in danger, don\u2019t hesitate to run away and come back, anytime.\u201d\u201cWill do.\u201dHaving been a soldier, Shanette was much stronger than ordinary women.Although she believed that that couldn\u2019t happen, she always had enough reserve power to fight back should Kang Yoonsoo was to do something weird.Hermione stroked Shanette\u2019s cheek which still had some burned marks.\u201cGo see the world and come back. You\u2019ll do well no matter where you are.\u201d\u201cThank you\u2026.truly. Hermione.\u201dShanette suppressed the overwhelming sadness.It would be difficult to meet another good person like Hermione.\u201cGood bye. Let there be light and peace in your remaining journey together.\u201dAfter saying good bye, the two people walked towards the north.Beyond the barley fields, came the wasteland.Shanette asked when they were about to go beyond the territory\u2019s borders.\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d\u201cHillerdan.\u201dHillerdan was a small city, quite distant from the Kellyine Territory.It was famous for having potion manufacturing facility as there were established branch of an alchemist clan.And Shanette asked what has been the most curious question of them all.\u201cWhat is the purpose of our journey?\u201d\u201cTo stop the coming destruction of the world. And\u2026.\u201dKang Yoonsoo slowly raised his left hand.The burning sun emitted bright light.Right.This time for sure.\u201cI\u2019ll stop the repetition of life.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Based on the map, there is a rather good spring nearby from here.\u201d\u201cThat place has been contaminated.\u201dShanette could not believe Kang Yoonsoo\u2019s response.How did he know without even having been there?Stubbornly, she led the way to go to the spring.The spring water which was clean not too long ago has already been turned muddy.Fluttered by it, Shanette apologized.\u201c\u2026.I, I\u2019m sorry. Had I known this, the time would have been better spent by searching for food.\u201dThen Kang Yoonsoo folded up the sleeves and extended out his right arm.Shrrreeek!He caught and picked up a coiling snake out of the muddy water.On that day, they prepared the snake and ate meat for the first time in a long while.That\u2019s how it has been.Whenever Shanette was about to say something, Kang Yoonsoo replied from several steps ahead of her.In normal situations, something like that couldn\u2019t possibly happen.That wasn\u2019t everything.Unlike his appearance, Kang Yoonsoo drank wine as if he was infatuated with drinking.The whisky that Hermione had prepared for them has run out within half a day.It was because Kang Yoonsoo\u2019s lips never separated from the wine bottle for almost the whole day.\u201cYou don\u2019t even get drunk after having drunk all that much wine? I can\u2019t feel any difference in you, before and after drinking.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cThen why do you like wine so much? For the taste?\u201d\u201cBecause my head hurts.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI like the pain in my head when I drink.\u201d\u2026..He was certainly a strange person.It was the 5th day after they have left Kellyine Territory.Kang Yoonsoo who was walking suddenly stopped.It was when Shanette put on a curious expression.There came a small tremor from the land as they were walking through the wasteland.\u201cKurrrrieg-!\u201dFrom the cracked land jumped out a thick worm.It looked like a worm, but its mouth was filled with sharp teeth.The land worm made a shrill crying sound.\u201cShrrrrrrrreeek-!\u201dThere wasn\u2019t just one worm.\u201cKurrrrieg!\u201d\u201cKurieg! Kurrrrieg!\u201dExtending their heads upwards out of the wasteland, the groups of 10 land worms shrilled in search of food.The land worms were the pack hunters that hunted in the wasteland.The two were seen as the land worm\u2019s preys.\u2018Land worm.\u2019Kang Yoonsoo did not like the land worms.They were the first monsters that he was facing right after returning.It was because it seemed that everything must be restarted from the very beginning.\u2018\u2026.Although such feelings don\u2019t even remain anymore.\u2019He took out a machete and held it.The strengthened blade of the large sword had bluish light flowing down on it.Kang Yoonsoo\u2019s present level was 34.The land worm\u2019s level was approximately 50.Although he was outnumbered in terms of the levels and in numbers, he wasn\u2019t too worried.\u2018Hunt lightly with the mindset of doing warm up exercises.\u2019Kang Yoonsoo immediately charged.The land worms\u2019 teeth burst out of the ground.Slightly bending low, Kang Yoonsoo swung the machete in an angle.The powerful long sword precisely destroyed the pressure point between the teeth.\u201cKurrrrrieg!\u201dHe then jumped up real high and walked on the head of the land worm as a platform.Although the land worm inexhaustibly moved underground and cried out in wrath, Kang Yoonsoo responded calmly.Whenever the large sword grazed by, at least one land worm either fell, or took on serious injury.\u201cLife drain.\u201dBluish white colored energy extended out of his arm and absorbed the life of the land worm.[Your life drain skill has been raised.The quantity of life force that can be absorbed is increasing.]He completely filled in the gap created by the differences in the levels with his skill.As Kang Yoonsoo was not an easy target, the land worms went after Shanette.The land worms dug in to the ground and tried to tear up the weak woman\u2019s body.Shanette took out her weapon from her waist hoist.\u201cKurrrieg!\u201dOne of the land worms came after her by targeting the back of her head.Immediately turning around, Shanette swung her scythe.Puuck-!The attacking land worm\u2019s head was split and severed in half.A scythe was a sickle with a long handle.It was the weapon that she could handle the best when she was a soldier of the territory\u2019s lord.Shanette swung the scythe and killed the land worm by slicing it.There was no hesitation in her maneuvers.The reason behind Shanette having served under the lord of the territory wasn\u2019t just because she had a relationship with Hermione.From the birth, she had great physical strength that was different from others.She even trained several times more intensely than other soldiers.On top of that, as a soldier of the lord of the territory, she had the experience of fighting it on several occasions.Was it because she had attained the sculpture of power?She felt several times lighter than ordinary times.No matter how long or how hard she wielded the scythe, she could not feel any pain in her hand.Although Shanette was easily victorious, land worms kept coming up out of the ground with no end.Taking out his secret iron dagger from his bosom, Kang Yoonsoo threw it.The land worm that was about to bite down on Shanette\u2019s shoulder was hit in the gum and fell down.\u201cThank you!\u201dThere was no sign that the number of land worms was going to decrease, no matter how much time has passed.Kang Yoonsoo immediately extended out his right arm.\u201cSummoning 78 skeletons. Summoning giant hobgoblin and zombies.\u201dThe undead has been summoned.Kang Yoonsoo continuously executed body explosion magic by twirling his hand as well.A lot of the land worms were immediately killed.Kang Yoonsoo\u2019s level also rose by one.However, the skeletons, the lowest level undead, were all killed.Shanette let out a sigh of relief as she removed the sticky by-product from her hair.Kang Yoonsoo\u2019s action was highly appreciated, but she had one question.\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be simple if we just let the undead fight?\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t engage in the fight yourself, the experience level that can be gained decreases.\u201dHad the undead weren\u2019t summoned and just finished off the land worms, he could have increased the levels by even more.Kang Yoonsoo sent the hobgoblin zombie back to the summoning world.Observing how he fought, in a close range, Shanette began to have a peculiar question.\u2018No\u2026 That probably was not true\u2026.\u2019She asked feeling what if.\u201cKang Yoonsoo, could you please hold my hand for a moment?\u201dWithout saying anything, Kang Yoonsoo put out his hand.Holding his hand, Shanette put a small pressure in her grip.Then he cringed.\u201cIt hurts.\u201d\u201c\u2026..By any chance, have you exerted pressure?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dShanette was wildly bewildered inside.\u2018It\u2019s weak!\u2019During the time of fighting the dragon mercenaries, it couldn\u2019t be felt as the battle had been fierce.However, now that she was able to experience the battle together, she could know for sure.Kang Yoonsoo was much weaker than her.Of course, his ability to target the pressure points, and movements in dodging opponent\u2019s attacks were much better than Shanette.However, in terms of physical capacity, Kang Yoonsoo was extremely weak.\u201cWhat is your level?\u201d\u201c35.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dPresently, Shanette\u2019s level was 72.It all depended on the capability distribution, but it meant that she was over 2 times stronger than Kang Yoonsoo.\u201cThen, then your occupation?\u201d\u201cNone.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dShanette could not help, but be surprised again.Choosing a class was much more prudent when it was done at lower levels.Even for production occupations, if one inherited the occupational characteristics, one can obtain many benefits, and that one could also learn one or more high level skills.Since Shanette was a troop of the territory\u2019s lord, her present class was a \u2018soldier\u2019.A troop could attain advantages with respect to battles, and could also earn the society\u2019s trust when the soldier served the territory\u2019s lord or an emperor.However, in the case of no occupation, no benefits could be reaped.\u201cKang Yoonsoo, I\u2019m sorry, but how long has it been since you\u2019ve moved over to this world?\u201d\u201c7 days ago.\u201d\u201cNo way!\u201dShanette finally exclaimed.Has he achieved level 35 within just 7 days of moving over?The ordinary travelers would have tough time just to stay alive, let alone experience growth since they would be too busy getting used to the new and unfamiliar world.On top of that, his battle skill was beyond ordinary.On the other hand, without any expression, Kang Yoonsoo was thinking about other things.\u2018In order to kill the demon king, it is imperative to take the necessary steps of preparation.\u2019He was confident that he could come out on top in the recent battle, even without having summoned the undead.However, much time would have been lost, and that Shanette could have been either hurt or even killed.There were still 20 years of time before the demon king would appear.It was much better to keep the safety of his comrade than choosing acute growth at this time.\u2018And growing alone is not good enough.\u2019Kang Yoonsoo approached Shanette.He moved close enough to have his breath touch her face.Shanette was fluttered, but he pressed on her forehead with his finger as if it was nothing.[Shanette Elogran]798 hours until the 1st opening of the sculpture of power.Waiting time would decrease as the growth took place.\u201cLong way to go.\u201d\u201cWhat happens to me if the sculpture of power is opened?\u201d\u201cYou get stronger.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dKang Yoonsoo grabbed machete then cut off the land worm\u2019s feelers, and placed them in to the front pouch of his knapsack.He gathered the feelers from the tens of the dead land worms.\u201cWhy are you taking the feelers?\u201d\u201cThey are potion ingredients.\u201d\u201c\u2026. You also know how to make potions?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dShanette\u2019s eyes opened wide.Making potions or secret medicine were the sole proprietorships of alchemist.The alchemists made potions by mixing materials gathered from the tree roots, herbs, or monsters\u2019 corpses.Since potion concoction was difficult, it was even hard to try it unless one was an expert or had great hand skills.Shanette\u2019s curiosity as to who Kang Yoonsoo was has grown.Seeing him wield the large sword, he appeared to be a swordsman or a mercenary, but thinking about his ability to wake up the dead bodies, he was also a necromancer.On top of that, he could make potions?She could not believe that he was a traveler who had no occupation, and that it has only been 7 days since he has come into this world.Kang Yoonsoo extended out his right arm after gathering all the feelers.\u201cResurrection of the corpses in mass scale.\u201dThe corpses of land worms began to rise up one, and two at a time.They were risen up as undead with their flesh decayed and blackened.Then after sending the dark land worms to the summoning world, he said.[You kept 54 dark land worms in the summoning world.The total number that could be summoned in the summon world \u2013 54 dark land worms, salamander Sally.The possible number that could be kept \u2013 445]\u201cLet\u2019s stop by the Ultica ruins before going to Hillerdan.\u201dShanette raised both her eye brows.\u201cThe ruins?\u201dThe ruins.The place where there lived hundreds of monsters, and precious treasures were kept in the heart of it.As ordinary clans knew the dangers of the ruin, they wouldn\u2019t go there without having formed a group of at least 200.To such a dangerous place, this man was audaciously saying that we ought to go as if it was a picnic.Kang Yoonsoo has already begun walking.Shanette quickly caught up with him.\u201cIf it\u2019s a ruin then there would also be strong monsters?\u201d\u201cA lot.\u201d\u201cCould, could just the two of us be victorious in such a ruin? Ordinarily, before a raid on any ruins, the landscape and the entrance path must first have to be analyzed by the runners!

If there is a ruin in the wasteland, then there must have been a lot of people here at one point.\u201dIt was always difficult to discover an existence of ruin\u2019s significance in any history.Traditionally, there were two characteristics of ruins which have been found in the ancient continent.First, there were a massive number of monsters.There minimally live many hundreds of monsters at a single ruin.Due to the effects of the ruin\u2019s magical power, the monsters would not able to come out of the buildings.Monsters do not eat or drink, and live in the ruin, but as they were confined for a very long time, their rage is at the point of exploding.No matter who the intruders are, they would shred them up.Second, a precious reward.The ruin would be conquered should the treasure that is in the heart of the ruin was to be stolen.The treasures of the ruin have ordinarily been rare items that weren\u2019t easily found.On top of that, the treasure at the heart of the ruin was guarded by the boss monster.Even today, there were many more than one or two clans that were exploring the ruin quicker than anyone else, in order to obtain the treasure.\u201cRuin is not depended on territories.\u201dNot even surveying the area, Kang Yoonsoo walked without any hesitation.\u201cIt\u2019s just difficult to locate.\u201dAt the end of the long walk, what welcomed the two was a field with overgrown thorny brushes.This enigmatic field of thorns was one of the factors that contributed to having turned this land into a wasteland.\u201cThere was such a place like this in the wasteland.\u201dThere was a large field of thorny brushes that stubbornly survived on the grounds of the wasteland.The thick thorny bushes were such that if one was just to get close to them, they would tear one\u2019s flesh.Shanette asked with an apprehensive look on her face.\u201cYou want to go through them?\u201dThe machete that Kang Yoonsoo has prepared was for use in the jungles.It worked fine in battles, but it was a specialized knife for cutting brushes or tree branches.However, Kang Yoonsoo shook his head.He extended out his right arm.\u201cSummoning Salamander Sally.\u201dA small flame of fire appeared in the air.After a small twister of flame, a pretty girl showed herself.\u201cDaddy-!Sally ran over to Kang Yoonsoo, and stood right beside him.\u201cDaddy, daddy, why did you call me?\u201dKang Yoonsoo pointed to the field of the thorny brushes.\u201cBurn it.\u201d\u201cThen what are you going to give me?\u201d\u201cWhat would you like.\u201d\u201cHm\u2026. A hug?\u201dWhirl.\u201cAaak!\u201dAs Kang Yoonsoo hugged her, Sally rubbed her reddish cheek on his.Shanette thought that it was unexpected.She thought that he was a man who didn\u2019t know how to express his emotions. Perhaps, he wasn\u2019t just a callous man, after all?Sally raised both her hands high. And she shouted at the field of thorny brushes.\u201cFlame of wrath!\u201dA flame twister originated from her hand and began to pan out.It was a blaze of brilliance and hot spirit.The flame\u2019s effectiveness was even more powerful as the wasteland was dry and lacked moisture.The flame burned up the entire field of the thorny brushes at once.The girl looked up at Kang Yoonsoo, and rushed toward him as if she was asking him to praise her.\u201cDaddy, daddy, did Sally do well?\u201d\u201cYou did. Go back.\u201d\u201cA-ing. Praise me more.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t feel like it.\u201dSally pouted.Sally walked over the Shanette and clutched around her waist.\u201cSally likes mommy, too. I\u2019m going, mommy!\u201d\u201cOK, good bye, Sally.\u201dAfter sending Sally back to the summoning world, Kang Yoonsoo moved quickly.It was when Shanette blankly stared at the surrounding land where the heat of the flame was still lingered.Turning his head, Kang Yoonsoo said quietly.\u201cCome quickly.\u201dThe burned up thorny bushes began to slowly grow again.The regeneration ability of the thorny bushes was incredible.Scarily, the surrounding area once again began filling with thorny bushes.Alarmed, Shanette followed Kang Yoonsoo.Shrreek! Shreek!The thorny bushes quickly grew and were overcrowding the area.They couldn\u2019t be seen as ordinary plants.With any delays, it was possible for them to be trapped in the field of thorns.\u201cAt this rate, we will be trapped and won\u2019t be able to get out!\u201d\u201cSo, hurry up.\u201dKang Yoonsoo said nonchalantly.The two ran to the point of being unable to breathe.It was hard to tell how he found it, but Kang Yoonsoo ran into an underground tunnel.\u201cThis way.\u201dThe thorny brushes carpeted the ground as if it was trapping them.Shanette ran fast and jumped up high.As soon as she made her entrance into the underground tunnel, the thorny brushes have entirely closed up the opening of the tunnel.Shreeek!\u201cAh, that was close.\u201dShanette said swallowing her dry mouth.However, Kang Yoonsoo was already walking into the underground tunnel.Letting out a breather, she followed him.He was a man with zero trace of emotions like back in time as he was during the period of the dragon mercenary ordeal.Hermione\u2019s advice came to her mind.\u2018He seemed to have been living for a very long time. Something\u2026was different from us.\u2019What was that man\u2019s true identity?* * *A ray of bright light shone down on them after having walked for a long time, inside the underground tunnel.It was a way out.When they exited the tunnel, an expansive space opened up before them.It was a space that was quite different than the wasteland.The ground was covered with grass that was still moist with dew.The large trees shook the leaves.\u201cThis place\u2026 Where is this?\u201d\u201cA space made with magic.\u201dKang Yoonsoo picked up a stone from the ground and threw it.Tup!As if the stone has hit an invisible wall in the air in the trajectory of its flight, it fell down to the ground.Unable to believe what she has witnessed, she walked over to it to see it personally.A hard wall was felt although there was nothing in the air.\u201cThere is a limitation to space creating magic. It returns if a specific area is broken.\u201dExternally, it might be a forest of large trees, but it was, in fact, an illusion of magic.Kang Yoonsoo took out the secret dagger from his bosom and held it.After surveying the area, he threw the secret dagger to the largest tree that he saw.Puck-!The secret dagger precisely pierced the trunk of s tree.At that moment, the big tree and its surrounding broke apart and the view changed immediately.The surrounding area has returned back to a wasteland.There stood a huge building at the other side.There was a high carved stone wall with odd patterns etched on it.It was the ruin.The Ultica Ruin.It was rated as being the lowest attackable ruin which currently existed in the continent.Even the reward was comparable to that.However, as there lived hundreds of monsters, they couldn\u2019t take the ruin as an easy target.The constructions of the ruin boasted remarkable feats.The stone columns were lined up in the tens, and the internal space appeared to be limitless.\u201cThis ruin has been hidden by ma, magic?\u201d\u201cIt could be easily looked over as a forest due to the illusion.\u201d\u201cBut would there be anyone else who would come here through the thorny field, besides us?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dKang Yoonsoo responded nonchalantly.Shanette has now become used to such attitude of his. So, she didn\u2019t necessarily correct or ask him again.However, the feats of the ruin were incredible.This was the first time in her life that Shanette has seen a building as big as this one.Although nothing was felt from outside, it was highly possible that the inside was overcrowded with monsters, for sure.\u201cWhat are you going to do, now?\u201d\u201cGo inside.\u201dKang Yoonsoo moved.Shanette was concerned, but she held the scythe tightly.Although he was cold and talked little, Kang Yoonsoo was talented in many ways.He had no occupation and his level was low, but he must surely have a plan of his own.The two people entered the ruin.As every column had luminous stones on it, the area was not dark.It was as when they were walking carefully in there.As they were marveling with the expansive space, a sound of something crying came from somewhere.\u201cWoooooo-!\u201dShe had goose bumps all over.It was a crying sound of a beast.Soon, a shape of a wolf appeared from the other side.Its entire body was covered with silver mane and its eyes were red.Just by looking at the huge size and its long and sharp canines caused chills to go down her back.A werewolf.It was a veracious, stubborn monster which was hard to deal with.Unlike ordinary wolves, they were living beings that talked with each other and lived in a group.The werewolf monster\u2019s level was about 70There was a clear difference in the risk level between the land worms and werewolves.Shanette gritted her teeth as she pulled out the scythe.However, the crying sound that came next put her in despair.\u201cAwoooooo-!\u201d\u201cAwoooooo-!\u201d\u201cAwoooooo-!\u201dAs expected, there was more than one werewolf.Several hundreds of werewolves showed themselves as they came out of the hiding from inside the ruin.The area, crowded with werewolves, flashed with silvery radiance.Instantly, the two were surrounded by about 700 werewolves.\u201cKrrung! Krrung!\u201d\u201cKrrrrr\u2026..!\u201dThe werewolves howled veraciously.\u201cNow, what do we do?\u201dShanette asked urgently.However, Kang Yoonsoo was not shaken at all.He audaciously stepped forward.Shanette felt overwhelmed by the posture of the man who wasn\u2019t any different than other times.It was when the werewolves were exposing their canines as if they were about to devour them.Kang Yoonsoo raised both his arms wide and high.It was a moment of desperation.Kang Yoonsoo yelled loudly.\u201cKrung. Krrrung. Krrrr\u2026 Krung. Krung. Krrrung. Krung. Krrung.\u201d\u2026.It was the sound of a dog.Then the werewolves raised their fur on their bodies and responded loudly with the like sounds.\u201cKrung? Krung-krung! Krrung!\u201d\u201cKrrrr\u2026..? Krung! Krrung? Krung!\u201d\u201cKeeung\u2026 Keeeeewwwonng!\u201dThe werewolves opened up a path.The werewolves closed their jaws, turned and lowered their heads as gentle puppies.Moreover, a few of them even shed tears as they moaned.The monsters are opening a path in this way!Having witnessed an incredible turn of events, Shanette approached him.\u201cDid you, perhaps, have a conversation with the monster, just now?\u201d\u201cYah.\u201dAt that moment, Shanette did not know how to react.\u201cWhat did you say to them that they lowered their guards like that?\u201dKang Yoonsoo said.\u201cTold them I\u2019ll free them from the ruin.\u201d\u201cAre you really going to do that?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dThe two headed towards the heart of the ruin.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The location, too\u2026 I mean, I think I know, now that\u2026 You won\u2019t even answer to such questions, right?\u201d\u201cYup.\u201dShanette inflated her cheeks slightly.\u201cI knew that that was what you would do.\u201dWhen they reached the end of the Ruin, they saw a white shining gate.The gate emitted white light as if it has been carved out of ivory.Beyond the gate, there was a room where the Ruin\u2019s treasure was placed.However, a reliable monster was guarding the gate.\u201cKarrrreung\u2026.! Roork!\u201dThe head of the wolves.The monster that desired the moon light.It was a werewolf.An ordinary werewolf had the gripping power to crush the head of a bull in only one hand.However, the monster that was guarding the gate appeared to be much more vicious on the outside than the ordinary werewolves.White light appeared to flow all over its body, and its claws were as sharp as the saw teeth.[The white wild beast (boss, level 104) has appeared.]A monster with over the 100 level.It was a monster which was on a different plain than the ones he has faced so far.Although it was almost as big and tall as 3 meters all around, its evenly distributed muscles made it very agile.\u201cRityek. Urenokra-!\u201dThe white beast knelt down and moved on its fours.It happened only in a blink of an eye.The long and sharp claws whipped Kang Yoonsoo\u2019s fa\u00e7ade.Chichang-!In no time, taking out the long sword, Kang Yoonsoo pushed away the claws.However, there was no way he could be a match.Kang Yoonsoo\u2019s hand appeared to be twisting, and the long sword bounced out of his hand and to the back of him.The difference in their powers was one sided.\u201cDangerous!\u201dShanette hurriedly approached as she raised her scythe.However, waving his hand, Kang Yoonsoo refused her help.\u201cKarrrreung\u2026.! Urenokra!\u201dRoaring loudly, the white beast wielded its long claws on its both front paws.Sheeweek-!The sound of the sharp bluish lethal weapon cutting though the air was scary.The claws brought with it the destruction of the whirlwind as the beast wielded them in crisscross fashion.However, Kang Yoonsoo was able to dodge all those attacks.\u201cUrenokra!\u201dThe white beast roared, and in its frenzy, it whipped around his claws and powerfully crashed its teeth together.There came a series of rapid attacks, but none of them was able to land clearly on Kang Yoonsoo.Kang Yoonsoo\u2019s movements weren\u2019t fast and simple.He already knew the paths of the oncoming offensive maneuvers.Boowoong-! Boowoon-!He dodged all of the white beast\u2019s attacks with minimal efforts.The claws of the white beast were only able to graze the ends of his collar, pants, and hair.He did not even make any mistakes such as getting tripped or pushed to a wall.That display even made Shanette to doubt as to what she was seeing.The difference in the physical powers was so great.Yet, as if he had already estimated the paths of the attacks, Kang Yoonsoo was able to dodge the deadly attacks with a few seconds in between.The white beast was not able to overcome those few seconds.\u201cLakildrag-!\u201dAfter roaring loudly, the white beast leered down at Kang Yoonsoo.There was nothing else to do, but accept it.No attacks were working on this bastard!Turning his head, the white beast fixed its attention to Shanette.\u201cKarrrrreung\u2026.!\u201dIf nothing was working on Kang Yoonsoo, then it\u2019s only natural to change the target.Panicking, Shanette raised the scythe.It was the moment when the white beast was immediately rushing to tear her up.\u201cLokr.\u201dStartled, the white beast came to a stop.Lokr meant \u2018look here\u2019 in werewolf language.The white beast\u2019s attention was again turned to Kang Yoonsoo, and he took out a bright shiny stone from the backpack.It was the moonstone that has been refined at the workshop in the Kellyine territory.\u201cWerewolves are infatuated with moonlight.\u201dThe moonstone emitted soft moonlight.The enshrining of the vicinity with its delicate moonlight was causing werewolf\u2019s instinct to awake fiercely.The boss monster, the white wild beast, rushed.\u201cCaricradi! Urenokra!\u201dThe white beast attacked Kang Yoonsoo.Kang Yoonsoo dodged the monster\u2019s fierce attacks with small movements.Lowering his upper body, he dodged the claws path, and he took out the rock steel daggers from his bosom.He threw all of the remaining daggers at the white beast.The shallowly piercing the beast, the daggers were buried between the white beast\u2019s muscles.Kang Yoonsoo spoke quietly.\u201cShanette.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m hungry, make me some soup.\u201d\u201c\u2026..\u201dWas it something that anyone could say while fighting a boss monster.* * *It has never dawned on Shanette that she would live a day in which she would have such a thought, in her life.It has never come to her mind that she would be leisurely making potato soup at a Ruin where monsters could appear, let alone with a ferocious boss monster before her, at that.Shanette said from the camp fire.\u201cKang Yoonsoo, the soup is ready.\u201d\u201cWine too.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re out of wine.\u201d\u201cThe front pouch of the backpack.\u201d\u201cThis is honey wine. Did you always have it?\u201d\u201cStole it.\u201d\u201c\u2026..From where?\u201dKang Yoonsoo did not reply.\u201dHolding a bowl of soup and wine bottle tightly in her hands, Shanette asked.\u201cYou stole it from Hermione lord\u2019s warehouse, right? I can tell from its packaging.\u201dKang Yoonsoo nodded his head without a word.Only then Shanette gave the bowl of soup and the honey wine to Kang Yoonsoo.\u201cDon\u2019t do that from next time.\u201dFor some time now, Shanette was getting used to Kang Yoonsoo.She also filled her bowl with soup, too.Shanette looked over yonder as she sighed.\u201cShould I give him some soup, too?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cKareeeung\u2026.\u201dThe white wild beast breathed heavily, unable to control its own body.With the after effects from having rapidly attacked for many hours, the beast was not able to command its body.On the other hand, Kang Yoonsoo did not even shed a drop of sweat, and even breathed evenly.Unlike him who moved minimally while dodging the attacks, the white beast ran out of stamina due to having quickly moved to its limit.On top of that, the daggers, which were thrown by Kang Yoonsoo, were strategically piercing the beast such that they were causing enormous pain.\u201cUrenokra-!\u201dThe white beast could only cry out, unable to even stand up.The moonstone was lodged at the top of the tall column of the Ruin.The white beast could only stare at the moonlight that was emitting from that moonstone which has been placed there, personally, by Kang Yoonsoo.The white beast cried out loud with wrath.\u201cUrenokra-!\u201dShaking her head, Shanette asked.\u201cWhat does Urenokra mean?\u201d\u201cYour father\u2019s d***, bastard.\u201d\u201c\u2026..\u201dShanette\u2019s expression was one of unbelieving one.\u201cI thought that it meant \u2018I\u2019ll tear you up.\u2019 Since the beast kept repeating it.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not the beast\u2019s nature.\u201dFor some reason, Kang Yoonsoo spoke as if he has known the white beast very well.After finishing the soup and cleaning up, they got up from there.Kang Yoonsoo moved towards the white gate.\u201cCaricradi! Urenokra-!\u201dGnashing his teeth, the white beast wailed loudly.Not paying any attention to it, Kang Yoonsoo opened the gate.Kirreeek\u2026..The gate opened easily even without putting much of an effort.The difficulty level was not this low at the ruins in the first place.The boss monsters normally brought its underlings, and the gates would usually be tightly closed.The closed gates would normally open once the boss monsters have been killed, in normal situations.However, the Ultica Ruin, which was one of the easiest ruins in the continent, only had one boss monster, and the gate also opened without even killing the monster.That\u2019s because that was how easy the Ultica Ruin was as far as the difficulty level was concerned.As soon as the gate opened, the bright light shone.Shanette was impressed.\u201cThat must be the treasure of the Ruin!\u201dIt was a tall and expansive room.From the large altar came the gloriously bright light.Although it was blinding, Kang Yoonsoo slowly walked up the altar.On the top of the altar, an item was visible on top of it as if it has been placed there as a sacrifice.Kang Yoonsoo took the possession of the Ultica Ruin\u2019s treasure.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The Ruin is filled with werewolves. Won\u2019t it be difficult to convince them this time around, now that they are angry?\u201dShanette cringed a little.She did not want to imagine being mauled to death by over 700 werewolves.However, Kang Yoonsoo spoke.\u201cIt\u2019s alright.\u201dHe extended his hand, showing her the noose of submission.The two walked down from the altar and left the room.The white beast was still exhausted, complaining about its aching muscles.Running swiftly, Kang Yoonsoo placed the noose of submission around the beast\u2019s neck.\u201cKareeeeung\u2026.!\u201dThe white beast resisted roughly, but it wasn\u2019t able to overcome Kang Yoonsoo.It tried to use its claws to break the noose that was tightening around its neck, but the white beast fell forward before it was able to attempt it.[You have successfully captured the wild white beast.Do you want to tame this monster?]\u201cI\u2019ll tame.\u201d[The white beast is successfully tamed.The white beast has been freed from the Ultica Ruin.Please give a name to the tamed monster.]Kang Yoonsoo looked upon the white mane of the white beast.\u201cWhite.\u201d[White]Level: 104Type: White beast (Werewolf mutant)Power: 71Adaptation speed: 27Wildness: 6Skill: Wind Claw (Lv3).A werewolf mutant.

After, it became a boss monster able to use the whirlwind magic effect of the ruin. Its character is destructive and it trusts nothing.The white beast had become a named monster.Unlike ordinary monsters, it was possible for named monsters to accumulate new levels through their own efforts.From this moment on, White, the white beast, had become a boss monster and would be able to increase its level.Kang Yoonsoo removed the rock-steel daggers from White\u2019s body.He took out the land worms\u2019 feelers and a wooden bowl from the knapsack.He poured the remaining honey wine into the bowl and added the feelers after grinding them down.He stirred the yellowish liquid in the bowl.\u201cDrink.\u201d\u201cUreuno\u2026. Kaaang!\u201dKang Yoonsoo kicked White\u2019s jaw.Puck-!Being smacked right in the area where a new tooth was growing out, White opened its mouth wide in pain.Not losing that moment, Kang Yoonsoo poured the liquid mixture down the beast\u2019s throat.Gulp.White opened its eyes wide as the liquid went down its throat.Surprisingly, its muscle pains slowly dissipated.The liquid mixture which Kang Yoonsoo made had the effect of temporarily healing muscle aches.Wrapping White\u2019s noose around his hand, he got on the back of the beast.White immediately tried to stand on his hind legs with a roar, but had no choice but to submit to the magic of the noose.White\u2019s eyes were filled with sharp anger, but it wasn\u2019t able to drop Kang Yoonsoo.Kang Yoonsoo, on White\u2019s back, extended his arm out to Shanette.\u201cGet on.\u201d\u201cIs, is it really OK to get on?\u201d she asked with a fear in her eyes.She has heard that some outstanding tamers roamed around while riding on wild wolves.However, to ride on that ferocious werewolf?She had never imagined such a thing, let alone heard of it.\u201cIt\u2019s OK.\u201dShanette hesitated.Was it OK to trust this man?However, her hesitation did not last long.Having decided, she grabbed Kang Yoonsoo\u2019s hand.Alright.I suppose it\u2019s OK to trust him a little.Cautiously, Shanette sat behind Kang Yoonsoo.Fearing that she might fall, she hugged him tightly from behind.Kang Yoonsoo ordered.\u201cRun.\u201d\u201cKareeeeung-!\u201d\u201cKrrrraaaah-!\u201dWhite dashed like a wind storm.Although she knew how to ride a horse, her vision still became blurred due to the incredible speed.Her hair blew backwards messily, and she could not hold her head still.Kang Yoonsoo pulled the noose hard as he roughly changed White\u2019s direction.Every time that happened, Shanette crossed over the line between life and death and returned.\u201cKaaaaaahk-!\u201d\u201cKrung! Krung!\u201d\u201cKreeeuuuung!\u201dAs they came out of the center of the Ruin, werewolves rushed at them with their fangs showing.However, even they could not catch up with the speed at which White was running, and gave up as they got tired.[1]Some of the wolves blocked their path, but even with White\u2019s violent temper, it didn\u2019t seem to want to kill its own kind. Therefore, it avoided them and only roared.The ride, which would cause one to bite one\u2019s tongue, and the turbulence that was similar to that of riding a cart, caused Shanette to clench her teeth.\u201cWhat do you mean that it\u2019s alright\u2026 what\u2019s alrrrrright-!\u201d\u201cRight, it was a lie.\u201dShanette truly felt death.And she was able to share White\u2019s anger a little, too.The white beast, with two people riding on its back, roared loudly as it dashed out of the Ruin.\u201cUrenokra-!\u201d***************Hiledan.A city known for its alchemy.Established beyond the wasteland, Hiledan was a busy city which the Kellyine territory could not compare to.The buildings were constructed on top of one another, and there was a countless number of pedestrians.There were merchants who were negotiating with stubborn men, and other merchants who were singing after getting paid.There were a few travelers who wore devices on their wrists like Kang Yoonsoo.The travelers moved rather busily, talking about their adventures or going in and out of bars.The city\u2019s atmosphere was one of peace and positivity.Shanette closed her eyes and then slowly opened them.The scenery that she was seeing with fresh eyes[2] .The familiar aroma and strong wind.The busy crowd.Her heart pounded with anticipation.\u201cThis city\u2026 is truly a wonderful place.\u201d\u201cHiledan is a small city.\u201d\u201cIs that right? There are bigger places than this?\u201d\u201cYah.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re\u2026thinking about going there, too?\u201d\u201cYup.\u201dShanette smiled like a child who was waiting to go on a picnic the next day.On the other hand, Kang Yoonsoo was expressionless.\u2018You can only kill the demon king by becoming stronger as you wander around the continent.\u2019Unlike Shanette, Kang Yoonsoo could not feel any inspiration from anywhere on the continent.It was because he had already been everywhere, from the hiding places of a neighborhood child to the nest of a destroyer dragon.If he was asked to choose places that excited him, they would be like the demon tower, and the forbidden places of the continent.Those places were the prohibited places where he could easily die, even though he had knowledge from his previous lives.Although he had been to those places in his past lives, he had still faced deadly situations even when he went there after having grown as much as he could.\u2018I\u2019m not going there, anyway.\u2019It was possible for him to experience acute growth there, but the weight of danger was too much.No matter what, Kang Yoonsoo did not plan on dying until he killed the demon king.\u2018Things to do in Hiledan are\u2026..\u2019He went through every sort of hardship when he came to Hiledan in his first life.At that time, he could not even imagine all the dangers that lurked in this small, peaceful city.However, it was different this time.Kang Yoonsoo had reincarnated to the point of exhaustion.Going forwards, he knew exactly what he had to do in order to maximize his benefits.\u2018First, I must kill that bastard.\u2019Ironically, the very first thing Kang Yoonsoo had to do in this harmonious small city was to commit a murder.This sentence is almost an exact duplicate of the previous two sentences. I added the one bit that was missing.This is an expression that means she\u2019s an outsider observing something, which seemed to match well with \u201cnewness\u201d.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 17": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Record of a Thousand Liveschapter 17Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe two returned to Hiledan\u2019s entrance.Of course, they sent the dangerous-looking White back to the summoning world before they arrived.As expected of a city well known for its alchemy, it was easy to come across books on alchemy, as well as vapors from potion distillation.There weren\u2019t that many stores, since potions were relatively rare, but the cost at corpse dissection and reassembly facilities was cheaper here compared to other cities.Especially since the corpse dissection facilities had dismantling devices, which were used on a monster\u2019s corpse to separate its flesh from its bones. Of course, such devices could be on the expensive side, unless the facility was deserted.And in the middle of the city stood the grand building of an alchemy clan.The two first stopped by a trading post.The trading post was quite noisy due to many merchants and guides bickering.Kang Yoonsoo took out 12 gold bars and placed them on the table.\u201cI\u2019d like to exchange them.\u201dLooking a bit surprised, the guide looked at Kang Yoonsoo.Had it been a merchant, pulling a wagon filled with tradable goods, dropping off the gold bars, the guide wouldn\u2019t have been too surprised. But seeing an ordinarily dressed man taking them out from his knapsack, the guide couldn\u2019t help but be a bit shocked.Using both hands, the guide gathered up the gold bars.\u201cI\u2019ll weigh them. Please wait a minute.\u201dAs Kang Yoonsoo waited, he could hear a conversation from behind him.Two merchants that brought precious kerosene were talking to each other.\u201cHave you read the news? I\u2019ve heard that Yang Jojang\u2019s Mariel was killed last week.\u201d\u201cMariel? Why, that child?\u201d\u201cGosh. Mano, you\u2019re way behind on the news since you\u2019ve been away from Hiledan for a while. There have recently been numerous beautiful girls being raped and murdered in the city. This is already the 4th one.\u201dUnconsciously, Shannette was fully engrossed in listening to their conversation.\u201cSerial murder? Huh, in such a peaceful city as this?\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t there always some crazy bastards that are egging to break the peace, no matter where you go?\u201d\u201cThup-thup. She was such a kindhearted girl, how did\u2026.\u201d\u201cBut, you know. There\u2019s a strange rumor going around about this incident .\u201dAs if he was telling a secret, the merchant lowered his voice.\u201cThe women, you know. They said that they all died with big smiles.\u201d\u201cDied with smiles?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. They said the dead women were severely beaten. The torture wounds, caused by whips and knives, were so deep that it was sickening. Yet the corners of their mouths were touching their ears, as if they were smiling widely. Isn\u2019t that truly a hair-raising occurrence?\u201d\u201cThat is chilling. Had the women been drugged?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why the investigators are having such a hard time with this case. If illicit drugs were involved, it would surely make this case more complicated. Many cities have already had illicit drugs smuggled in, I can\u2019t believe that Hiledan is now added to that list.\u201dThen the guide returned, placing a number of leather pouches onto the table.\u201cAll together, there are 1,200 cold coins.\u201dNonchalantly, Kang Yoonsoo put the coin pouches into his bosom pocket.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dAlthough Shannette was curious about the merchants\u2019 conversation, she followed Kang Yoonsoo out of the trading post.Having heard about the serial murders, she began to see what once looked like a peaceful city in a somewhat different light.It wasn\u2019t that she was feeling fearful, but it created an ominous feeling, for sure.\u201cHow can there be serial murders in a city like this? It\u2019s so unexpected, it sounds like a story I\u2019ve heard somewhere. Just like a mystery novel.\u201d\u201cThe culprit\u2019s name is Lee Minchan.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dShannette came to a stop.\u201cWhat did you just say?\u201dTurning his head, Kang Yoonsoo looked at her.\u201cSpoilers.\u201d******Kang Yoonsoo and Shannette went towards an inn.The two both had messy appearances.As they arrived by passing through the wasteland, many parts of their clothes had dry sand and dust on them.Having wanted to take a bath for a while, Shannette smiled.When the sun was about to set, they entered a wooden building.The sign which read \u2018Golden Alchemy Inn\u2019 swayed in the wind.\u201cIt costs 50 bronze coins per room per night. Are you going to take baths as well?\u201dThe inn\u2019s owner, an elderly gentleman, asked.Mixed groups of travelers and people from the continent were sitting at the tables.Kang Yoonsoo took out 1 silver coin, and threw it to the owner.\u201cOne room and wine.\u201dShannette blinked her big eyes.Did he just say one room?The inn keeper found an old key in the cabinet and handed it to Kang Yoonsoo.\u201cThe left most room on the 2nd floor. What kind of wine do you want?\u201d\u201cThe most potent one.\u201d\u201cKa-Kang Yoonsoo? One room only? There are two of us.\u201d Shannette asked sheepishly.The attention of everyone in the inn was now fixed on the two.Kang Yoonsoo looked at her without showing much interest.\u201cWe have to use one room.\u201dHe said in a quiet voice.\u201cI have to stay with you tonight.\u201d********The bathroom was filled with thick steam.Shannette submerged herself inside a wooden bathtub filled with warm water.The warm water engulfed her nude body.She fell into a thought as the water helped her relax from her exhaustion.She was thinking about the strange companion that she was traveling with.\u2018He is truly a strange man.\u2019At the beginning, she thought that he was an explorer with a lot of experience.His swordsmanship was excellent, and he even had blacksmithing skills, not to mention he did outlandish things like creating spirits right before her eyes.However, the truth was different.His level was low, and it appeared that it had been less than a month since he had come to this world.Moreover, even his grip strength was weaker than hers.\u2018But then how come he knows so much?\u2019He was even rather nonchalant when he found the Ultica Ruin.It was as if he had been going in and out of that place for a long time.On top of that, earlier in the day, he even stated the identity of the culprit that was responsible for the serial murders.She felt as if she was traveling with a wise man who knew everything about the world, rather than with an ordinary traveler.\u2018He\u2019s more like a cold doll than a wise man, though.\u2019A cold doll.She thought it was a rather appropriate expression to describe him.Then her thoughts came back to his most recent comment.\u2018I have to stay with you tonight.\u2019Splash!Shannette slapped the surface of the bath water with the palm of her hand like a child.Covering her face with her hands, she shuddered.She felt as if steam was going to burst out of her now warmed up head.\u2018Gosh, for crying out loud, that man\u2026! Does he have any common sense or not? How could he say such a thing so calmly in front of all those people?\u2019She could not figure out what the man was on about.He was very nonchalant in ordinary times, but then all of a sudden he could say such a thing.Like everyone else would, Shannette did not see his behavior under a pleasant light.\u2018How is it possible for me to share the bed with a man that I just met? We don\u2019t particularly like each other. Besides, he didn\u2019t even ask for my consent.\u2019She didn\u2019t pay much attention to it at first, since she\u2019d been exhausted, until after she\u2019d unpacked and entered the bathroom.However, as she thought about it again, it just did not make any sense.\u2018Alright, I\u2019ll quietly leave the inn after my bath. I\u2019ll go separate ways from that man here. Even if we get two rooms next time, the same thing could happen again. It will be hard to travel solo on my very first journey, but that\u2019s better than being with a man I know nothing about.\u2019Having decided, Shannette rose from the bathtub.While drying off, she found a hand mirror which was on the floor.She looked at her ivory-skinned body in the hand mirror.On her left cheek, there was still a small burn mark, but her skin was smooth and firm.She felt like crying, thinking about the past when she had been bullied and called a cripple due to her many burn marks.\u2018Come to think of it\u2026. Even before I recovered my original skin, he treated me like an ordinary woman.\u2019When she was searching for a bottle of wine, Kang Yoonsoo said that he knew a woman who was more beautiful than Hermiah.\u2018Take off your helmet, and look at the mirror. \u2018Although it was rather faint, Shannette smiled.\u2018He was the first person to ever told me such thing.\u2019After her appearance had been restored, the way that people looked at her changed as well.Their attitude of acting sick, despising or pitying her, had all changed to feeling envious, and admiring.However, Kang Yoonsoo.As far as that man was concerned, the way he looked at her did not change, at all.Shannette released the hand mirror.She felt as if her complicated heart has been somewhat organized.\u2018It is true that there are many strange aspects about that man. However, he has opened new doors for me. He saved me. Even though that should not be a reason for me to like him\u2026..\u2019To be truthful, the time that she has spent with him had been fun.It had been brief, but she truly felt that.Would it be possible for her to experience the creation of a spirit, to go in and out of hidden ruins, when she was on her own?\u2018That probably won\u2019t be possible.\u2019It was strange that he did not reveal who he was.It also wasn\u2019t possible for her to understand why he said they would share one room all of a sudden.However, Kang Yoonsoo was an interesting person.Only then did Shannette understand.She was slowly becoming attracted to him.She wanted to travel with him.\u2018I\u2019ve decided.\u2019Putting on a thin bath gown, Shannette exited the inn\u2019s bathroom.She walked towards her room without any hesitation.\u201cWow. Elder sis, you\u2019re quite pretty?\u201dShannette stopped and stood there.A boy stood in her way to stopp her.He was perhaps in the latter half in his teens.Judging bythe device on his wrist, he appeared to be a traveler.As Shannette looked at him curiously, the boy smiled.\u201cI\u2019m also a guest of the inn, and you look so pretty. So, I gathered the nerves to talk to you once. Do you have a boyfriend?\u201d\u201cNo, so can you move away?\u201dAs she has been thinking about the different ways people viewed her, she ended up speaking in a rather cold manner.Despite that, the boy laughed.\u201cHm. Liar. Elder sis, aren\u2019t you the girlfriend of that man that came in earlier? If you\u2019re sharing one room, it seems pretty obvious, even at a glance.\u201dFeeling upset, she stared at the boy.The boy\u2019s attitude was quite obnoxious.Going beyond acting confident, he was talking and behaving as if he could do anything.Shannette was courteous to others to begin with, but she did not particularly like people who had no manners.\u201cWhy are you staring at me like that. Others may think that I\u2019ve done something wrong.\u201dLaughing loudly, the boy moved aside.Feeling unpleasant for some reason, Shannette went towards her room.The boy yelled from behind her.\u201cMy name is Lee Minchan. What is your name?\u201dImmediately, the startled Shannette came to a stop.She didn\u2019t need to think about it twice.Lee Minchan.It was the same name that Kang Yoonsoo said belonged to the serial killer.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 18": "Chapter 18Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayShannette stood still, as if she was frozen.Cold sweat traveled down her back.\u201cWhat are you doing standing there like a dummy? Aren\u2019t you going to answer me?\u201dLee Minchan approached close behind her.Even before she could respond in any way, the door to her room suddenly opened.\u201cWhy are you not coming in?\u201dKang Yoonsoo poked his head out through the door\u2019s opening.He was lightly dressed, and he snatched her wrist in a nonchalant manner.After Shannette followed him into the room in her moment of confusion, he closed the door.\u201cThe- the boy in the hall, his name is Lee Minchan. Is he really the serial killer?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dThe room was very dark since the lamp was turned off.Shannette moved her hands about in order to locate the lamp, but all she could find was empty air.\u201cIs that kid really the serial killer? He did not appear to be a good person, but he looked too carefree to be someone who could rape and kill women.\u201d\u201cHe was always like that.\u201dFor some reason, Kang Yoonsoo spoke as if he had already encountered this situation in the past.It was hard to assume that Kang Yoonsoo was telling her a lie.Although he seemed as if he could not be fully trusted sometimes, everything he spat out had always been true.Continuing to wave her hands through the empty air, Shannette felt something at the tips of her fingers.It was the lamp.She lit the wick, then turned up the flame and the room brightened.Kang Yoonsoo already had his great sword on his back, and was sitting at the end of the bed.\u201cYou have to be ready for tonight, if you want to survive until dawn.\u201d\u201cIn order to survive\u2026. What do you mean?\u201dKang Yoonsoo spoke as if the answer was obvious.\u201cIf there is a serial killer who only goes after beautiful women, who do you think his next target will be?\u201d************The world exists only for me!That was none other than Lee Minchan\u2019s motto.Merely a few months ago, Lee Minchan was a timid 18 year old high school student.It was normal for him to be bullied at the back of the classroom by the popular kids. Watching anime in the corner of his room and laughing had been the only happy escape in his life.There was nothing he wanted to do.Nor did he have any friends.While others were diligently working towards their dreams or on their studies, Lee Minchan used to sleep at his desk and read fantasy novels.Lee Minchan liked fantasy novels.When he read novels where the protagonist destroyed countless kinds of trash and scum, he felt unmatched satisfaction in his heart.His absolute favorite was the high school bully genre, when \u2018a bullied high school student would be transports to another world and become the bully himself\u2019.It was a time when his parents frequently sighed worriedly, concerned about his future.Lee Minchan, for no reason at all, was transported to an unfamiliar world.The place that he was transported to was none other than the lair of a dragon.\u201cO, you who came from another world, I\u2019ll soon enter my long hibernation. Inherit my magic, and be prepared for the imminent dangers which will strike this world in the near future.\u201dThe tough-scaled dragon taught Lee Minchan magic, then entered a period of hibernation.Lee Minchan became the holder of a level 1 skill which was very difficult for anyone to master.And he achieved that without putting in any effort.\u201cPhenomenal! This is a true high school bully!\u201dLee Minchan was elated.In the real world he was always shunned by others, and he did not have a single friend with whom he could earnestly talk.His reality was boring, and he had nothing he wanted to do.He was sick of his parents who were always nagging him, and his teachers who always went crazy telling him to study.When he was transported to the other world, a phrase that said that he would be able to return to reality if he killed the demon king popped up on his device.\u201cWhat, go back to the real world?\u201dHis world had changed.Lee Minchan liked this world.Like the high school bully protagonist in his fantasy novels, he could now earnestly become the bully!\u201cGood thing I did not study. If I was destined to come here anyway, there\u2019s no reason to study. I would have just regretted it terribly had I listened to the adults. Nothing good will come from listening to nagging teachers.\u201dThe magic the dragon taught him was brainwashing.As long as certain limitations were avoided, it was possible to completely fool people\u2019s minds, and therefore control them.\u201cNice. I\u2019ll use it any way I see fit!\u201dFight against the evil of the world?Why would he use this great magic to do that?He was always beyond frustrated whenever he read about novels\u2019 protagonists, who touted honorable behavior and wasted their capabilities because of that.As soon as he left the dragon\u2019s lair, Lee Minchan hung around various nearby villages.By using his brainwashing magic, Lee Minchan absolutely brainwashed some of the beautiful women.[Do you want to brainwash Lee Rina, the flower girl?][When you activate the spell implanted in the target\u2019s mind, the magic will be initiated. Lee Rina\u2019s activation spell is \u2018is it true that her former fianc\u00e9 has run off with the engagement ring?\u2019][The effect of brainwashing magic becomes greater on people who have agitated emotions, and those with weak minds. On the other hand, the effect is minuscule on people who have lived for a long time, or have strong willpower.]Lee Minchan, who was neither good looking or of great stature, made himself appear as a handsome man to the women whom he brainwashed.However, the brainwashing magic had one strict limitation.He could only brainwash one person at a time.\u201cThis is frustrating. What dumb magic has so many limitations? Can\u2019t even make a harem with it.\u201dSo, whenever he encountered a pretty woman when he went to a new village, he would swap out his female companion.Of course, those women who were brainwashed would lose their memory, becoming lost and without a home, but Lee Minchan did not care about that at all.\u201cWho cares. I\u2019m now the high school bully. I\u2019ll do anything I want to. I\u2019ll always be with a pretty woman. Looks are everything to a woman.\u201dLee Minchan wanted to be a munchkin.The one who feared nothing, the most powerful bully in the world.So he tried monster hunting, while taking a beautiful female companion with him.However, brainwashing was the only magic Lee Minchan had.Brainwashing was a powerful magic, but it did not work on monsters.He almost died the first few times, but Lee Minchan survived by not hesitating to use his female companion as a shield.\u201cAaaaack! Help me! Don\u2019t abandon me!\u201d\u201cNo way. Fool. I\u2019m the protagonist, and you are an extra character. So I have to live, you know!\u201dLee Minchan thought that way without shame.He was the main character.Had there ever been a novel where the protagonist died at the beginning of the story?Even if it meant sacrificing others, he had to survive no matter what.Women, well they were a dime a dozen.Well, did they not say that, too?Throw it away if it was no use!As hunting wasn\u2019t as easy as he thought, Lee Minchan changed his plan.Instead of beautiful female companions, he thought about combining forces with other travelers that came from the same world as him.When he first participated in the joint hunting, they had acted in an ill-mannered way.\u201cHey, Minchan. You have to swing your sword at that time. Standing there like a dummy will get you killed!\u201d\u201cYou, bastard! Do you really want to get killed? If your level is low, you should just hide behind us, what the heck are you doing, stepping forward to try and kill the monster?\u201d\u201cWhat? This woman doesn\u2019t even know how to use a dagger, let alone a spear? Well, I don\u2019t like to say this, but her only good trait is being beautiful. This is a hunting ground. You have to bring along a person who can fight, not a pretty woman!\u201dLee Minchan was feeling disrespected.He was the high school bully.How could they treat a protagonist like this?If someone was a protagonist in a novel, shouldn\u2019t he, at a minimum, have a loyal friend that he could consult with?Lee Minchan was grunting with anger for the entire day, unable to even eat comfortably, after hearing the demeaning comments from those travelers.He needed an appropriate method to release his stress.Lee Minchan snapped his fingers after thinking about it.\u201cRight, where are you?\u201dLee Minchan found a horse whip.The boy would whip his woman all night.Initially he was hesitant, and only whipped her lightly. But, later on, her painful moans and screams began to excite him for some reason, and he began to whip her harder.The feeling of superiority satisfied him, reminding him that he was definitely on top.\u201cIt\u2019s alright. Because I\u2019m the high school bully.\u201dThe protagonist was always justified in his actions.On top of that, people enjoyed selfish and out of control protagonists more than ones who were kind and valued life.Therefore, he too could do anything, by any means necessary.Cheeeeck-!\u201cAaaaack! Help me!\u201d\u201cWhy? Why did the mighty dragon only leave me with a single brainwashing skill? If he was going to teach me in the first place, isn\u2019t it appropriate for him to go the whole nine yards and leave me with legendary level artifacts, like in the fantasy novels?!\u201dEach time he returned from hunting, Lee Minchan released all his stress on the women by striking her.Although he went hunting often, Lee Minchan\u2019s level did not rise easily.He had always lacked physical capabilities, and did not have good motor skills on top of that.It would have been better for him had he tried to increase his activity level now, but even that was too much work for Lee Minchan.At the end of each hunt, he would discretely talk bad about other people. Therefore, people\u2019s opinions of him began to deteriorate, especially among the travelers.Finally, after several months had passed, no traveler groups would welcome him.\u201cWhy, why won\u2019t you let me in your group?\u201d\u201cYour character is detestable, that\u2019s why.\u201dGrasping his head with both hands, he grit his teeth.You dumb idiots. I\u2019m the protagonist!On that day, overtaken by anger, he struck the woman with something other than the whip.It was a large bat.As he was in the middle of getting into it to release his stress, Lee Minchan realized that the woman was not breathing.She was dead.Dropping the blood-soaked bat to the ground, Lee Minchan shuddered with guilt.At that moment, a new message popped up on his device.[Experience gain has multiplied due to the synergistic effect of massacring a life from the same race. It is your first murder. Additional experience will be given.][When there is a witness, crime level will rise. If the crime level rises, you could be negatively affected when questioned by an investigator. Level has risen twice.]Level up!Only then did Lee Minchan understand.That was, his experience would rise even if he was killing a person.In fact, the experience he gained was greater than when he killed a monster!From that moment on, Lee Minchan looked for those travelers who humiliated him during the hunt.He brainwashed them, one at a time, and killed them all.Ironically, the skill that the dragon left him to use in fighting the world\u2019s evil was perfectly suited for criminal activities.The brainwashing skill\u2019s level has also grown by a lot.He was only able to brainwash weak people at the beginning, but soon he was even able to brainwash strong, mature people.Although it was still limited to brainwasing only one person at a time.As his crime level rose, he could no longer stay in the same place.Lee Minchan arrived at the small city of Hiledan to hide.Even after coming here, he brainwashed women and killed them.He thought that there was no reason for him to feel guilty.That was because he was the protagonist, the high school bully.People enjoyed it more, saying it was refreshing and interesting to watch the protagonist cheat, or do bad things.So, what was there to prevent the protagonist from doing whatever will benefit him?The only problem was he found it boring and simple to always kill in the same manner.So, Lee Minchan brainwashed them and commanded.\u201cSmile. Very happily.\u201dWhen he said that, the women would smile like crazy until the moment of their deaths.No matter how painful it was.Killing them therefore became more enjoyable.Lee Minchan thought that his actions were a form of consideration.At least they weren\u2019t killed while showing pain filled expressions.*******Almost a month had passed since Lee Minchan came to Hiledan.He was around level 30.He wanted to kill more in order to become stronger quickly, but he could not do that since he had to avoid the investigation dragnet.Every time he reached a checkpoint he had to use the brainwashing skill to pass, otherwise he would not have been able to evade capture for so long.It was when Lee Minchan was resting at an inn.A strange couple entered the inn by kicking through the inn\u2019s door.As they have not washed for a while, they did not look that attractive.However, the girl with the reddish brown hair was beautiful under the grime.Although the burn mark on her left cheek was regrettable, she was still quite wonderful.He even thought that she was the most beautiful woman he\u2019d ever seen, even when compared to all the women that he had killed so far.\u2018Tonight, it\u2019s that bitch\u2019s turn.\u2019Evening came.Lee Minchan ran into a woman after he was returning from the bathroom. As she walked towards him, he was greatly impressed.It was the same girl who came to the inn earlier that day.There was a pleasant scent around her. Perhaps she had just taken a bath.Her beautiful figure and ivory toned skin immediately attracted Lee Minchan\u2019s attention.He almost did not see the burn mark on her face.Although they exchanged a few words, she went into her room without even telling him her name.Lee Minchan was disappointed, but he did not care.\u2018Well, she will become mine anyway.\u2019Lee Minchan went into his room and inspected his tools.She was a beautiful girl, the kind he was seeing for the first time in a long while.He thought about not only playing with her, but also using her as his main torture subject for a while.He was having trouble finding sufficient methods to release his stress these days, anyway.Lee Minchan placed the whip, club, dagger, and other items into his chest pocket.\u201cI will play with her for a while and when I get tired of her, I\u2019ll kill her.\u2019Lee Minchan saw other people as nothing but play toys.They were lowly things, which he played with and then threw out when he got tired of them.All the extras were supposed to be used and then thrown away by the protagonist.I can do anything.I\u2019m the high school bully.Dawn came.Lee Minchan walked towards the room where she was sleeping.The door was already ajar.Having prepared to use his brainwashing magic, Lee Minchan grabbed the door by its handle and pulled it open.At that moment, a hand reached out from inside the room.The hand grabbed and roughly twisted Lee Minchan\u2019s hair.\u201cUh\u2026..?\u201dRight before he could scream, Kang Yoonsoo pulled Lee Minchan\u2019s head, and threw him against the glass window.Chang-!\u201cAaaack-!\u201dBlood poured down.The shards of glass tore up Lee Minchan\u2019s face as they violently penetrated his skin.\u201cMy, my face\u2026.!\u201d\u201cNothing happened.\u201dKang Yoonsoo reduced the gravity of the moment with a single comment.With his bare knuckles, he delivered a strong punch to Lee Minchan\u2019s face.Puuck-!Lee Minchan\u2019s nose broke, and more blood spewed out.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 19": "Chapter 19Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cAaahk!\u201dJust as Lee Minchan began to scream, Kang Yoonsoo repeatedly punched him on the mouth.His lips ripped open and blood poured out, and his front tooth shattered.Kang Yoonsoo\u2019s punching was so efficient that Lee Minchan was only able to let out whimpering moans, but the pain he felt was extreme.\u201cUh, Uuuuhhk\u2026.!\u201dKang Yoonsoo did not stop punching.His intense beating did not stem from a desire to deliver justice to a serial killer.\u2018If I didn\u2019t do this, Shannette would have died.\u2019The very first time he ran across Lee Minchan, Shannette was murdered at the inn.From that moment on, Kang Yoonsoo killed Lee Minchan every life he met him.This time would be no different.\u201cSpare, spare me!\u201dLee Minchan begged desperately, his face covered in blood.However, Kang Yoonsoo did not show even a tiny bit of mercy. Instead, he drew his greatsword and held it tightly.The boy\u2019s face turned pale white.\u201cAre, are you really going to kill me?\u201d\u201cYup.\u201dIt was then.He wasn\u2019t sure how long she had been standing there, but Shannette spoke from near the door.\u201cSomeone\u2019s coming up.\u201dKang Yoonsoo lowered the sword.The person that came up was none other than the innkeeper.\u201cWell, I didn\u2019t want to have to say this, but please quiet down. I don\u2019t care how much fun you\u2019re having, but we can hear the noise all the way downstairs.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I was trying to kill a bug. I guess it got too loud.\u201dPoking her head out through the opening in the door, Shannette smiled nonchalantly and stuck her tongue out.The innkeeper wore an unpleasant look as he returned to the 1st floor.It was at that moment.\u201cKraaaaht!\u201dLee Minchan wiggled, stood up, and then took off towards the door.When Shannette moved in to stop him, he took out a dagger from his bosom and swung.As she dodged the path of the dagger, it opened a small window of opportunity for him.Not letting that chance escape, Lee Minchan sped up.He took off out the door.As Shannette tried to chase after him, Kang Yoonsoo grabbed her shoulder.\u201cI\u2019ll go, alone.\u201dLooking worried, Shannette asked.\u201cReally\u2026. You don\u2019t mean to kill him, do you? You\u2019re just going to capture him and turn him over to the investigators, right?\u201d\u201cYup.\u201dOf course, it was a lie.*****************\u201cDamn bastard. Bastard. Bastard! I\u2019m going to cut his head off.\u201dLee Minchan muttered while touching his bloodied face.The broken pieces of glass pierced into his face stung painfully.The thought of removing them with his bare hands made him tremble in fear of how much this might hurt.The boy shivered as he removed pieces of glass one at a time, all the while spewing vulgarity.\u201cThat f**** a****. I\u2019ll crush him to death. F****, I\u2019ll crush him!\u201dHe had never been beaten up, even his parents had never hit him once.In fact, Kang Yoonsoo was the first person to ever openly beat the teenaged Lee Minsoo.\u201cThat son of a bitch!\u201dLee Minchan walked loudly while releasing his frustration by talking to himself.The passersby looked at him strangely, but his rage meant he did not pay them any attention.The boy then turned towards the passersby.\u2018F***. I\u2019ll go all out in releasing my stress today. I\u2019m going to brainwash and kill someone.\u2019He even decided to ignore the investigators\u2019 radar.Lee Minchan looked around for a target, and soon found good prey.A girl was walking somewhere with a basket full of apples.She wasn\u2019t all that pretty, but her looks were tolerable.\u2018That bitch is it, for today.\u2019Even though it was the first time he set eyes on her, Lee Minchan ground his teeth as if he had just run into his mortal enemy.Walking toward her quickly, he tapped the girl\u2019s shoulder.\u201cHey.\u201d\u201cWho are you?\u201d\u201cNo need to know. Come here for a sec.\u201d\u201cAhh! What are you doing!\u201dRoughly grabbing the girl\u2019s shoulder, Lee Minchan dragged her towards an alley.The girl looked at him in horror, but he did not care.As soon as they entered the dark alley, Lee Minchan extended out his right arm.[Do you want to brainwash Irina, the girl selling apples?][When you activate the spell implanted in the target\u2019s mind, the magic will be initiated. Irina\u2019s activation spell is \u2018is it true that you\u2019re selling apples everyday cuz your parents have deserted you?\u2019][The effect of brainwashing magic becomes greater on people who have agitated emotions, and those with weak minds. On the other hand, the effect is minuscule on people who have lived for a long time, or have strong willpower.]\u201cIs it true that you\u2019re selling apples everyday\u2026Uuuk!\u201dAs he was reciting the spell, he felt a strong pain on the back of his head.The pain made it feel as if his eyes were popping out of their sockets.He glanced behind him, glaring.It was Kang Yoonsoo.\u201cWhat, what the heck. F***! How did you get here?\u201dLee Minchan retreated, highly surprised.On the other hand, the expressionless man looked at the boy while holding a sharp greatsword.Lee Minchan was horrified at that dry and cold stare, like that of a doll\u2019s.Since they were in a gloomy alley, his fear doubled.He did not notice anyone else around him, so when did this man catch up with him?And his objective?\u201cTo kill you.\u201dKang Yoonsoo spoke as if he had read Lee Minchan\u2019s mind.Cold sweat traveled down Lee Minchan\u2019s back.Kang Yoonsoo lightly swung his sword.A thin line of blood flowed down from Lee Minchan\u2019s neck.\u201cUh, Uuhk-!\u201dTrembling all over, Lee Minchan lowered his outstretched hand.Halting the process of brainwashing the girl, Lee Minchan quickly ran away.\u201cGet lost! Get lost! Get out of my sight!\u201dLee Minchan ran in fear.His face still hurt, and the memory of getting beaten up by Kang Yoonsoo clouded his mind with terror.His shirt was damp with sweat.He ran until he was gasping for breath.\u201cHu\u2026! Hu\u2026.!\u201dPlacing his hands on the top of his knees to try and catch his breath, Lee Minchan raised his head.A man came into his view in the distance.It was Kang Yoonsoo.\u201cAaaahk!\u201dPeople that were passing by looked at Lee Minchan strangely.Turning back, Lee Minchan ran off.The expressionless man holding the greatsword appeared more horrifying and chilling than anything else in the world.\u201cNo, don\u2019t. Don\u2019t come near me!\u201dLee Minchan ran as fear engulfed him.He ran towards a narrow alley with almost no people.However, as if he had been expecting it, Kang Yoonsoo was waiting at the end of the alley.Holding the great sword like a divine being, Kang Yoonsoo spoke.\u201cYou\u2019re late. As usual.\u201d\u201cAaaaaahk! I\u2019ll brainwash you!\u201dWith burning eyes, Lee Minchan extended his right arm.Gathering as much magic power as he could, he began to execute his brainwashing magic with more intensity than ever before.At that moment, an unbelievable message popped up on his device.[The target\u2019s brain possesses 20,004 years worth of memory. He can never be brainwashed, even if the skill is mastered.]\u201cWhat, what the heck?\u201dOverwhelmed with fear, Lee Minchan plopped down on the spot.His brain is 20,004 years old?For crying out loud, how long had he been living?Is, is that\u2026 really a person\u2026.?!\u201cYou, what, what are you? Are you even human?\u201dKang Yoonsoo approached without a reply.It was when Lee Minchan was trying to turn and run away.He smacked the back of the boy\u2019s head with the hilt of his sword.Puck-!\u201cAaaahk!\u201dLee Minchan\u2019s vision turned dark.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 20": "Chapter 20Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWhen Lee Minchan came around, he smelled the stench of blood.When his eyes opened slightly, he realized he was in a meat processing room.This was the place where beast and monster bodies were processed into meat and hides.\u201cWhat, what?\u201dHe wanted to get up, but he wasn\u2019t able to.Lee Minchan realized that he had been tightly bound with ropes.Shivering in terror, the boy screamed.\u201cWhat is this? What is this?! Let me go!\u201dHowever, there was no reply.There was just a single swaying ceiling lamp that dimly lit the room.The room was so quiet that it almost seemed like there was no one else in the entire processing facility.\u201cUh\u2026..Euuuhk.\u201dA man was walking towards him from the dark side of the room.It was Kang Yoonsoo.Lee Minchan shouted in fear.\u201cLet, let me go! Please, let me go!\u201d\u201cSilence.\u201dThe reply was cold and dry.Lee Minchan quieted for a moment and swallowed dryly, then began begging like a dog as he wiggled his bound body.\u201cLet, let me go! Please! I won\u2019t do it again! I will not kill or brainwash anyone else! I\u2019ll live a quiet life! I\u2019m a young boy who doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s right or wrong! So, please forgive me!\u201dBut he heard no reply.There was only silence.Kang Yoonsoo stood up as if he had heard what he was waiting for.He held a whip in his right hand.A chill went down Lee Minchan\u2019s back.It was the same whip which he had been using until now.Shivering all over, Lee Minchan begged.\u201cLet, let me go! Please, don\u2019t hit me!\u201d\u201cI have no intention of killing you myself.\u201dInstantly, Lee Minchan\u2019s countenance brightened.He was sure that, even though the man had no expression on his face, he wasn\u2019t someone who enjoyed killing.Just when the boy began feeling safe, Kang Yoonsoo slowly raised the whip.\u201cYou will die by your own hands.\u201dLee Minchan felt every hair on his body standing up.What was he talking about?At that moment, Kang Yoonsoo\u2019s whip fiercely struck the boy\u2019s cheek.\u201cAaaaahk-!\u201dKang Yoonsoo\u2019s whipping was much more accurate and painful than what Lee Minchan could achieve.The whip landed perfectly on Lee Minchan\u2019s pressure point, tearing up his skin.Although it wouldn\u2019t kill him, it was so painful that he wanted to die.\u201cIt hurts! It hurts! Damn it!\u201dBiting down on his bloody lips, Lee Minchan yelled.The boy\u2019s cheeks were wet with blood and tears.However, Kang Yoonsoo\u2019s whipping did not stop.\u201cWhy, why do you want to kill me?! You damn bastard! You could turn me in to an investigator, or put me in jail! I know I\u2019ve done wrong, but you don\u2019t have the right to kill me! Damn it\u2026..!\u201dKang Yoonsoo continued his whipping.When Lee Minchan had almost lost consciousness, he finally heard a reply, spoken in a low tone of voice.\u201cIt is a man\u2019s right to exact revenge on a boy who raped and killed his wife.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026.What?\u201d\u201cA truly angry man will repeatedly kill that boy. Sometimes, he\u2019ll kill the boy instantly. Sometimes, through torture. Even if his sense of wrath dwindled with every kill, he\u2019ll still continue to kill the boy every time they meet. He\u2019ll keep killing the boy over the course of hundreds of years.\u201dThe end of the whip harshly struck Lee Minchan\u2019s cheek.Lee Minchan breathed roughly due to the burning pain.Kang Yoonsoo continued to speak in a low voice.\u201cYou ask why I\u2019ll kill you?\u201dKang Yoonsoo leaned in towards Lee Minchan\u2019s face.They were close enough for Lee Minchan to feel Kang Yoonsoo\u2019s breath on his skin.A cold and static voice penetrated his ear.\u201cWhen you killed Shannette, she was my wife. That\u2019s the only reason you are being killed right now.\u201dLee Minchan shivered, but still replied out of spite.\u201cWhat nonsense! You crazy bastard! Are you really going to kill me? Then you\u2019re a murderer, too!\u201d\u201cI know.\u201dDistancing himself, Kang Yoonsoo moved the whip again.The sharp, stinging whip hit the boy\u2019s chin.Lee Minchan shivered and cried out in pain.\u201cSon of a bitch. Son of a bitch. You damn son of a bitch!\u201dIgnoring the boy\u2019s swearing, Kang Yoonsoo pointed to a group of things on the ground.Lee Minchan\u2019s face went pale.A horse whip. A bat. A dagger.These were the tools that Lee Minchan has been using to torture girls.Kang Yoonsoo pierced the dagger into Lee Minchan\u2019s wrist, and swung the bat against his face.Puuck-!Lee Minchan\u2019s mind went blank due to the pain.The boy could no longer endure it.Lee Minchan winced and shut his mouth, then immediately shivered in fear.Blood was spilling out from between his lips.He had bitten off his own tongue.Lee Minchan\u2019s pupils shook, his eyes filled with tears.\u201cDamn, damn\u2026.it, hurts too much\u2026I\u2019d rather die than continue being tortured\u2026Aaah!\u201dLee Minchan breathing halted, as if his bitten tongue had blocked the back of his throat.The boy shook wildly, then collapsed.He had killed himself.Without any expression on his face, Kang Yoonsoo nonchalantly looked down at the boy\u2019s body.\u201cThe world does not move as you wish it too.\u201dKang Yoonsoo extended his right hand.The Ring of Life Suppression on his finger shone with black light.\u201cSoul collection.\u201d[Krrrraaaaaahk-!]Screaming shrilly, Lee Minchan\u2019s soul was sucked out of his body and into the black ring.[The lost boy\u2019s soul has been collected.Degree of degradation \u2013 MidRemaining Uses \u2013 3]Kang Yoonsoo brought the ring towards his ear.It felt cold.A highly degraded soul could be used to create a Soul Weapon, or be blown into a doll to create a curse.\u2018I have to get rid of any evidence. The investigators could start chasing me if there\u2019s a body.\u2019The tools he used to murder the boy were placed into his pocket.Kang Yoonsoo then lifted Lee Minchan\u2019s soulless body, and placed it into the sharp-toothed corpse grinder.He showed no trace of hesitation.Soon, the sound of the bones and flesh being shredded filled the room.*****\u201c\u2026..So, you have to tell me about things. Especially on occasions like last night. There is a limit to how reserved and casual you can be about things. We\u2019re traveling together, after all. So, don\u2019t try to handle everything by yourself, but let me help\u2026 You are listening to me, right?\u201dKang Yoonsoo slowly opened his eyes.The sweet aroma of coffee reached his nose, and the morning sun blinded him.Shannette was sitting before him, wearing an unhappy expression.He spoke.\u201cNo.\u201d\u201c\u2026..\u201dShe pouted a little before speaking.\u201cI don\u2019t like it when you\u2019re too honest.\u201dIt was a warm and peaceful morning in the inn.The room service breakfast was filling, and the aroma of apple juice was sweet.Kang Yoonsoo just drank wine, not touching the food at all.\u201cAre you just going to drink this morning?\u201d\u201cI usually skip breakfast.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not healthy.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d\u201c\u2026..\u201dKang Yoonsoo poured another glass of wine.Lee Minchan was young and bad-natured, but his brainwashing technique was a real threat.If Kang Yoonsoo had ignored him, he would have become a formidable foe at a later date.\u2018Now that Lee Minchan is dead, it\u2019s time to begin hunting in earnest.\u2019Monster hunting.It was the most fundamental method for someone to raise their level.Usually, travelers sought out monsters\u2019 habitats, or got recommendations from the native people, in order to hunt.However, it was meaningless for Kang Yoonsoo to hunt in ordinary places.\u2018The start of a legendary quest is in one of Hiledan\u2019s hunting grounds.\u2019Unlike ordinary quests, this legendary quest was one that could only be carried out by the most skilled travelers.After all, it was devilishly difficult.However, it was also the easiest and fastest way for Kang Yoonsoo to grow stronger than anybody else.Shannette finished eating her breakfast and stared at him.\u201cSo, what are you doing today?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to hunt.\u201d\u201cWhere?\u201d\u201cAt the alchemist clan\u2019s building.\u201dClan.It referred to an organization that was formed by many people who shared the same objective.Travelers had formed many different clans on the Sylphia Continent.However, he would be hunting at a clan\u2019s building?\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201dShannette\u2019s eyes widened as she tilted her head.Kang Yoonsoo stared at her without replying, his thoughts elsewhere.He has seen Shanette die hundreds of times as he repeatedly lived this life.It was the same in his previous life as well.The world crumbled due to the demon king, and Shannette was also crushed to death.However, even though she had disappeared alongside the entire world, she had now reappeared before him.She was exactly the same as she had been in his previous life.Kang Yoonsoo spoke.\u201cThanks.\u201d\u201cFor what?\u201dHe gave a truly obvious answer.\u201cFor being alive.\u201d*****The two came out of the inn and began walking outside.It was easy to locate the alchemist clan\u2019s building, since it was right in the middle of the city.Shannette tilted her head.\u201cCan you hunt at a clan\u2019s building? It\u2019s not even a monster habitat. I\u2019ve never heard of such a thing.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s possible.\u201dAfter replying briefly, Kang Yoonsoo entered the building.A blonde woman who looked like an employee gave them a friendly smile.\u201cWelcome to the Hiledan Branch Office of the alchemist clan. How can I help you?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve come to hunt chimera.\u201dThe blonde woman looked surprised, but continued to speak.\u201cAh\u2026Are you referring to the Chimera Dimension?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cSo you want to carry out the alchemist\u2019s secret quest. And the password?\u201dIt was Kang Yoonsoo\u2019s first time entering the alchemist clan\u2019s building, or starting the secret quest.However, Kang Yoonsoo spoke the password as if he had done it countless times.\u201cIt is more difficult to make a world than to crush it.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve obtained entrance into the Chimera Dimension, which is a sealed, A-level area.\u201dThe blonde woman said in a business like tone.\u201cThe Chimera Dimension is a very dangerous space, where ferocious chimera live. However, as such, it is possible to grow tremendously and obtain rare rewards. Of course, we, the alchemist clan, do not guarantee or take responsibility for your safety or rights.\u201dKang Yoonsoo nodded.They were conditions he would know even if she hadn\u2019t said anything.The Chimera Dimension was truly a dangerous space.When he first learned of the existence of the Chimera Dimension, it was after hundreds of travelers had already been killed there.\u201cChallengers start from the 1st floor. The Chimera Dimension has a total of 5 floors, and the boss monster lives on the top floor. Please keep in mind that the Chimera Dimension will close automatically when the boss monster dies.\u201d\u2019The issue is with the other way the dimension can close.\u2019The Chimera Dimension could be freely accessed and exited by anyone who had permission to enter.They could leave if they felt their lives were in danger, or if their condition deteriorated after hunting the monsters.However, an incident occurred where, even without the boss monster dying, the dimension had closed.In the end, everyone who was in the dimension had been killed, en masse, unable to escape.The alchemists played dumb about it at the time, but it was something they had caused.It was for the purpose of secretly using the hunters in the Chimera Dimension as research materials.Branches other than the one in Hiledan also operated the Chimera Dimension in this manner.The reason was because certain alchemists wanted to use people\u2019s corpses to create a stronger human life form.\u2019Rumier Chisan, the genius alchemist of the imperial family.\u2019Kang Yoonsoo looked at the blonde woman.She was just a lowly employee, the real bad guys were those important alchemists.In the past, burning with righteousness, he had brought their evil deeds to a halt many times.However, at this moment, he had to do no such thing.Kang Yoonsoo brought up another matter.\u201cI have someone I want to meet.\u201d\u201cWho would that be? If it\u2019s an important matter, we can attempt to forward your request for a small fee.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s someone currently attempting the quest. His name is Han Saehyun. He wears ash colored armor, and has a cape with a white tiger on it.\u201dKang Yoonsoo handed over 1 gold coin.After looking through some documents, the blonde woman nodded.\u201cWe do have some information on him. We\u2019ll send him a message as quickly as possible, and it should reach him by this evening.\u201dKang Yoonsoo left the blonde woman, and walked down a corridor.Shannette followed him and asked.\u201cWho is the person you\u2019re looking for?\u201d\u201cSomeone who will be of help to us later.\u201dKang Yoonsoo uncharacteristically frowned as he thought about Han Saehyun.He was someone who Kang Yoonsoo met every life, but that didn\u2019t make him any less of an annoying person.\u2018He wasn\u2019t someone I originally would have wanted to make contact with, if it weren\u2019t for his strength and level, but things worked out rather smoothly with him previously.\u2019Shannette looked curious.\u201cAnyway, what is the Chimera Dimension?\u201d\u201cThe alchemist\u2019s trash can.\u201d\u201cWhat? What does that mean?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t feel like giving a long explanation.\u201dShannette took out a bottle of wine and shook it wildly.She was implying that she would shatter the bottle if he didn\u2019t answer.Only then did Kang Yoonsoo open his mouth.\u201cMany alchemical projects fail, and, eventually, it comes time to throw out those failed projects. However, it is dangerous to throw them out just anywhere. As a result, one of the alchemists created a dimension where that waste can be thrown away. After a long time, all those failed projects combined, and it caused the space to become the Chimera Dimension.\u201d\u201cAnd people volunteer to go to such a dangerous place?\u201d\u201cBecause it is a hidden hunting ground.\u201dOf course, the Chimera Dimension was also a place to gather the sacrifices required for the alchemists to create their superior life form, but Kang Yoonsoo didn\u2019t need to explain that.\u2018Still, the rewards are OK. Especially the sword that the boss monster on the top floor drops. I can use it for a very long time.\u2019Kang Yoonsoo stood in front of a fireplace covered in black ash.It was an old and unsightly fireplace.When Shannette tilted her head, Kang Yoonsoo suddenly grabbed her wrist.\u201cDon\u2019t vomit.\u201d\u201cSorry?\u201dKang Yoonsoo took a step forward toward the fireplace.Then, as if he was being swallowed whole, Kang Yoonsoo was sucked into the fireplace.Shocked, Shannette opened her mouth wide, but she, too, was sucked in to the firelplace.\u201cKyaaaaa!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Let\u2019s finish it!\u201dA tall man stabbed a sword into the head of a grotesque looking Chimera.The chimera fell to the ground with a horrible shriek.The chimeras looked grotesque, as if they were formed by combining multiple creatures.It wasn\u2019t too difficult find chimeras with 6 legs, or even 3 heads.They weren\u2019t the only two people inside the Chimera dimension.All around, there were tens of people ferociously hunting those chimeras.Kang Yoonsoo held Shannette\u2019s hand and helped her stand up.He probably felt dizzy too, but he only had his usual blank expression.\u201cKrrrrr-!\u201dA herd of chimeras rushed toward them while howling.The level of chimeras on the 1st floor was in the 40\u2019s.They weren\u2019t particularly strong.Shannette quickly took out her scythe and held it.Kang Yoonsoo extended his right arm.\u201cSummoning the White Beast.\u201d\u201cKaimaxiron-!\u201dCrying fiercely, the White Beast appeared.The boss monster\u2019s mere presence was sufficient to attract the attention of everyone nearby.Alarmed, the travelers hunting in the distance screamed.\u201cWhat, what is that? Why is there another monster all of a sudden?\u201d\u201cAaaahk! It\u2019s a werewolf! Why is there a non chimera inside the Chimera Dimension?\u201dThere were even some people who were pointing their weapons in this direction.Kang Yoonsoo pointed at the chimeras.\u201cKill them.\u201d\u201cUreno\u2026 Keukeung!\u201dThe silver shackle around White\u2019s neck vibrated.The noose of submission.As White had already been tamed, it would feel pain if it didn\u2019t obey orders.White bit down, grinding its fangs, and rushed at the chimeras.\u201cUrenokra!\u201d\u201cKrrrrrrreuhk-!\u201dThe chimera used its 3 legs and 5 heads to indiscriminately attack.However, White used its sharp claws to tear the chimera\u2019s flesh into rags.After taking care of one chimera in no time, the white beast turned its attention to another chimera and attacked it.Having tasted fresh blood, the beast\u2019s wild nature exploded out.White slaughtered the chimeras with awesome speed.\u201cYeeyat!\u201dShannette, too, took care of any chimeras that came in range.The path the large scythe traveled was always accompanied by blood.Drawing his big sword, Kang Yoonsoo went after the largest chimera.\u201cKrrrreuk-!\u201dHe easily dodged the chimera\u2019s foot attack, and swung his sword.Puuck-!Blue blood spewed out.Kang Yoonsoo fiercely cut up the chimeras without mercy.The destructiveness of the greatsword, which had been strengthened quite a bit, was much more horrifying than ordinary big swords.Each time the sword swung, the chimeras\u2019 bones were crushed with precipitous sounds.His swordsmanship, which only attacked weak points, combined with the destructive power of his greatsword, allowed him to transcended the level difference between them.\u201cAll finished! Good job everyone.\u201d\u201cGood work everyone.\u201dThe travelers that were hunting in the distance plopped down to the ground, wiping the sweat off their brows.In the Chimera Dimension, it was only possible to advance to the next floor after killing 100 chimeras on the 1st floor.They waited to be summoned to the next floor while watching Kang Yoonsoo\u2019s team fight.One of the men tilted his head as he watched White.\u201cLook, that werewolf. Now that I look at it, doesn\u2019t it look like it\u2019s been tamed?\u201d\u201cTamed? What are you saying. This continent\u2019s tamers having a hard time even taming a deer.\u201d\u201cBut, look at that. How can it fight with them unless it\u2019s been tamed?\u201d\u201cHm. But, I\u2019ve never heard of anyone ever taming a werewolf, not even from the natives\u2026. Do they have a special training technique? The shackle around that wolf\u2019s neck does look quite sturdy\u2026.\u201dThey disappeared in the middle of that conversation.They had been summoned to the next floor.Soon, Kang Yoonsoo\u2019s team also finished fighting.Their vicinity was littered with the chimeras\u2019 body parts, and the ground was wet with blue blood.Kang Yoonsoo\u2019s level rose to 37, increasing by 2.[You have destroyed 100 alchemical chimeras. Do you wish to move up to the next floor?]Kang Yoonsoo delayed his reply.\u201cKareeeeeung\u2026.!\u201dIn the meantime, White had opened its mouth wide as it looked down on the chimeras\u2019 corpses.That was because it has worked up an appetite after the fierce fight.Kang Yoonsoo pulled its leash hard and ordered.\u201cDo not eat.\u201d\u201cKareeeeeung\u2026..!\u201dAfter fiercely staring at Kang Yoonsoo, White soon withdrew.A tamed monster would come under the command of their tamer, but if the monster\u2019s trust gets broken beyond repair it was possible that the taming itself could be undone.One couldn\u2019t handle a tamed beast as if it was a slave just because the beast has been tamed.After searching the body parts of the chimeras, Kang Yoonsoo picked up a small, pink stone.Shannette tilted her head in curiosity as she brushed her blood soaked hair off her face.\u201cWhat is that?\u201d\u201cLook for more.\u201dThe two people went through the chimeras\u2019 inner part for a long while.[Heart stone of a low level chimera]It was the cause of chimeras getting created from failed alchemy experiments, sinceit contained a glimmer of life force. Because no one knew how to use it, the heart stones were not considered valuable.Kang Yoonsoo put all the heart stones into his knapsack.\u201cRaise corpses.\u201dThe 100 chimeras in the vicinity were reborn as decaying undead.Monsters that were killed by other people usually couldn\u2019t be revived as undead, because their corpses were completely destroyed.As the grotesque chimeras were transformed into undead, their appearance became even more hideous.It wasn\u2019t a bad idea to summon an army of undead to fight a war, but doing so would decrease the amount of experience they recieved.\u2018I will summon undead in order to fight the boss on the top floor.\u2019Kang Yoonsoo would supplement their lacking fighting force with the undead.This was the advantage of being a necromancer.[Stored 100 evil chimeras in the summoning space.Available summons \u2013 100 evil chimeras, 54 dark land worms, Sally the salamander.Total storage spaces \u2013 345]Kang Yoonsoo\u2019s team went up to the next floor.Inside the Chimera Dimension, stronger chimeras appeared on the 2nd floor than the 1st.They could rarely be killed with a single sword strike, and they would attack until the end, even if they were critically wounded.An even more fierce battle than previous ensued.Extending his right arm, Kang Yoonsoo summoned a new being.\u201cSummon Salamander Sally.\u201dA young girl appeared from a swirl of flame.After being summoned, Sally looked around the area.Upon seeing White, the girl laughed happily.\u201cWow! It\u2019s a doggie!\u201dWhen Sally quickly ran towards it, White fiercely swung its claws.\u201cKorunok! Machiron!\u201d\u201cWaaah!\u201dIn response to White\u2019s violent reaction, Sally broke into tears.This was the problem with bringing out multiple summons.If the different summons were not able to get along, it was possible the entire fight could be disrupted.The stronger a summon was, the more distinct their personality would be.It would test the capabilities of their summoner.\u201cSally, coat our weapons with fire.\u201d\u201cWheeing. Arm with flame!\u201dThick flames coated Kang Yoonsoo\u2019s greatsword, Shannette\u2019s scythe, and White\u2019s claws.Weapons coated with spirit fire become much more powerful.When Kang Yoonsoo swung his sword, it created a small, fiery tornado.Combining his swordsmanship with the power of the flame created an awesome destructive force.The chimeras were overpowered, falling to the ground, a powerful flame growing from feeding on their corpses.\u201cKareeeeuk!\u201dThe chimeras shrieked in pain as they were killed.The other travelers, who were watching Kang Yoonsoo and his team fight, couldn\u2019t help but be astonished once again.\u201cA werewolf wasn\u2019t good enough, now he summoned a spirit too?\u201d\u201cSpirits normally don\u2019t show their true form, do they?\u201d\u201cGosh, what the heck is that guy\u2019s class?\u201dThey couldn\u2019t understand it at all.A traveler, a native of the continent, a monster, and spirit.What the heck was this combination that had never been seen or heard of before?[You have destroyed 100 alchemical chimeras.Do you wish to move up to the next floor?]Kang Yoonsoo, once again, delayed his response.He gained 6 levels during the fight, raising his level to 43.Kang Yoonsoo and Shannette went through the chimeras\u2019 corpses, searching for the heart stones.After most of his mana had recovered, Kang Yoonsoo turned the chimera corpses into undead.The observers were shocked.\u201cWhat? He even has a necromancer skill?\u201d\u201cWhat the heck is his identity?\u201dKang Yoonsoo sent the evil chimeras into the summoning space.One of the men, who had finished his fight with the chimera, approached Kang Yoonsoo.\u201cI\u2019m Lee Kanghyun. Pardon me, but may I ask your name?\u201d\u201cKang Yoonsoo.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been watching you for a while. Your swordsmanship is extraordinary. Any chance you would like to join us? We have four level 70 swordsmen and one sorcerer in our party.\u201dLee Kanghyun gave an incredible proposal.However, Kang Yoonsoo\u2019s level was just over 40, much lower than theirs.Considering the silver wrist guard he acquired in the Ultica ruin, which raised his physical strength, and his excellent swordmanship, it was understandable that they misjudged his level.Before Kang Yoonsoo could shake his head, a tall, skinny man came up and placed his hand on Lee Kanghyun\u2019s shoulder.Judging by his robe and the wand that he had in his waistband, he was definitely a sorcerer.\u201cKanghyun, leave him.\u201d\u201cWhat? But\u2026..\u201d\u201cThat man, his level is much lower than ours. His skill transcends ours, though.\u201d\u201cWhat? Hanyul, what are you talking about?\u201dWhen Lee Kanghyun paused in confusion, Kang Yoonsoo slowly nodded his head.\u201cHe\u2019s right.\u201dEveryone around him was surprised.Based on his swordsmanship, they all thought that Kang Yoonsoo was incredibly high leveled,.The one called Hanyul approached Kang Yoonsoo and observed him.\u201cI\u2019m Shin Hanyul. Good to meet you. You certainly seemed different from those who are aimlessly traveling.\u201dKang Yoonsoo did not respond.Ignoring his silence, Shin Hanyul continued.\u201cWe\u2019re targeting the Chimera Dimension\u2019s boss monster. I assume you are, too?\u201dKang Yoonsoo slowly nodded.The Chimera Dimension was a hidden hunting ground, and only a few travelers knew about it.Even if someone had a clue that pointed to this place, they still had to learn the password by resolving the secret quest of the alchemist clan.There were some travelers who remained on one floor to continue hunting, but most of them were after the boss monster.The rumor that the boss monster was in possession of a strange sword had spread widely.However, many people succumbed to the chimeras, which grew more powerful with each floor, long before they reached the 5th floor.No one had yet managed to make an attempt on the boss monster that resided on the highest floor.\u201cLet\u2019s meet on the 5th floor. Although I\u2019m not sure who will reach the top floor first.\u201dHaving said that, Shin Hanyul turned, leaving along with his group.As he turned, a white lion pattern was revealed on the back of his blue robe.One of the watching travelers was surprised at the sight of it.\u201cWhite Lion Clan! That man, he\u2019s a member of the White Lion Clan!\u201dWhite Lion Clan.It was one of the most respected traveler clans.Most of the high level travelers were members of the White Lion Clan, and their fame was well known.The leader of the White Lion Clan was especially capable, such that his fame was well established even among the continent\u2019s aristocrats.Since the White Lion Clan was made up of most of the high leveled travelers, it was the largest of all the traveler clans.There was a widespread rumor that each clan member would receive a powerful item at each fixed level.Shannette, who was standing beside Kang Yoonsoo, asked.\u201cIs his clan that great of an organization?\u201d\u201cIt is.\u201dKang Yoonsoo stared at Shin Hanyul\u2019s back.The white lion on the waving robe was roaring in the direction of the king\u2019s throne.The eyes of the white lion were white.\u201cI\u2019ll destroy them, though.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 22": "Chapter 22Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter completing the 2nd floor of the Chimera Dimension, the two came out from the alchemy clan\u2019s building.It was already twilight, the sun had begun to set.Kang Yoonsoo checked the time and date displayed on his terminal device.\u2018The entrance to the Chimera Dimension will close soon. I should hurry.\u2019He had been headed towards the inn, but suddenly changed direction.\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d\u201cTo an alchemist\u2019s laboratory.\u201dShannette quickly caught up with him.\u201cI\u2019ll go with you.\u201d\u201cTake a rest at the inn.\u201d\u201cUh\u2026. I get bored all by myself. Besides, won\u2019t you be lonely too?\u201dKang Yoonsoo looked at her without saying anything, then began to walk again.Shannette was tired, but she giggled as she followed him.He was quiet and did not express himself, but she wanted to stay with him.Shannette\u2019s cheeks turned red.Although it was late in the day, the lab was full of people.Most of them were alchemists, who made base potions or special reagents.Warm steam filled the room, and it was very noisy.By paying a usage fee, anyone could use the available tools to make potions or reagents.Also, they could pay extra to make use of special herbs or medicinal plants.\u201cAh, finally, a success!\u201dAn alchemist shouted delightfully, almost jumping into the air.The glass bottle she was holding was filled with purple liquid.The higher quality a potion was, the more vivid and pure its color.It was a pretty good quality at that level.The people around her applauded in a customary manner.The road to making a complete potion was long and difficult.Even if one knew the general theory of how to make a potion, even a slight error would immediately cause its quality to degrade to a level that was no better than plain water.A highly skilled alchemist would reach a point where they were capable of creating a small dimension, but to grow to that level was no easy task.Without dexterous hands, an alchemist could easily go broke from having to pay for ruined ingredients.Unless one was born with talent, alchemists were a class of people who needed a great deal of initial capital.\u201cOur laboratory is open until midnight. Thank you very much for your patronage.\u201dAfter paying the usage fee to a lab employee, Kang Yoonsoo and Shannette took their place.Kang Yoonsoo took out the land worm feelers from his knapsack.The feelers were thin and dry, since they had been preserved at high temperature.Shannette recalled the time when he used honey wine and the land worm\u2019s feelers to treat White\u2019s muscle aches.\u201cAre you going to use those feelers?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dKang Yoonsoo stood up and walked towards where the ingredients for reagents were stored.Many dried herbs and medicinal plants were tied together.Since unique plants had powerful effects, they were used as ingredients for potions.Without even taking a second look, he chose and placed a bunch of medicinal plants into his basket.\u201cA unit of gerbera. Vampire plant. Moon flower. Blue herb. Alcohol water plant. Insectivorous lotus flower. And\u2026. Exploding cactus. The exploding cactus is expensive, and contains highly flammable materials, are you sure you\u2019re ok handling it?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dKang Yoonsoo took out gold coins and placed them down.The laboratory employee smiled wearily and said.\u201cHey, I\u2019m just saying this because you\u2019re a fresh face in the lab. Don\u2019t feel offended, but listen to me. It seems like a great feat for alchemists to make explosives or golems, but, in fact, it\u2019s not worth it if you look at it closely. Many people get chased out of this place because they either fail to make good products, or cause explosions. How about using ingredients that you can easily handle?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m good.\u201dKang Yoonsoo calmly took the ingredients.When the laboratory employee let out a sigh, Shannette quietly approached him and apologized.\u201cSorry. He is a bit inconsiderate, but he is a very good person.\u201dKang Yoonsoo returned to his spot, laid down the ingredients, and earnestly began preparing them.Using the grinder, he powdered the land worm feelers, then added color by including dried up gerbera flower petals.The moon flower, blue herb, and alcohol water plant were dumped into a pot, covered, and boiled, but he left an opening so that steam could naturally escape out of the pot.Kang Yoonsoo\u2019s hand movements were neither fast, nor slow.His movements were relaxed and restrained, as though he had been making medicine all his life.Shannette was impressed by the fact that he did not create any waste, unlike the other people who hurried and ended up wasting some of their ingredients.\u201cIs there anything I can help you with?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dKang Yoonsoo glanced subtly at Shannette as he said.\u201cYou\u2019re tired.\u201dShannette smiled lightly.In fact, she was tired, since she has been in combat all day.She appreciated his concern, especially since he appeared to be completely uncaring.Affectionately, she came near him.\u201cIt\u2019s OK. I can still help.\u201dAfter looking at her without saying anything, he pushed forward the insectivorous lotus.\u201cCut them into 4 even pieces.\u201dShannette diligently helped Kang Yoonsoo as she moved the short knife.She was a great helper, since she was good with her hands to begin with.Kang Yoonsoo measured out and mixed in the remaining ingredients.The liquid in the pot immediately transformed into slime and turned dark crimson.The potion making was a complete failure.In the distance, the laboratory employee put on an \u2018I told you so\u2019 expression.Then, Kang Yoonsoo took out several brightly colored stones.It was a chimera\u2019s core.Kang Yoonsoo put all the cores into the pot.The hard stones were mixed in with the slimy liquid in the pot, and began melting.After boiling it for several hours, to everyone\u2019s amazement, bright red liquid flowed out.\u201cIt\u2019s a success!\u201dAs Shannette exclaimed in delight, other people applauded in response.They, too, had an expression that said it was hard to believe.Normally, people who were visiting the alchemy lab for the first time would blow all their money on ingredients, and then leave discouraged.Kang Yoonsoo poured the liquid into small, glass bottles.As he had created so much of the potion, there was still some left over after he had filled 20 glass bottles.[Secret adrenaline medicineNo matter how exhausted the consumer is, it will bring them back to full energy. The consumer\u2019s movements will become faster and their senses sharper.

Ah, no, a chimera?\u201d\u201cWhat? He\u2019s a necromancer?\u201dNecromancers wielded black magic.Since they dealt with corpses and cadavers, they were a very rare class.Furthermore, it was even more difficult to find a standard necromancer that was also skilled in potion making.Not paying any attention to the people staring at him, Kang Yoonsoo spoke.\u201cEvil chimera.\u201d\u201cKrreeeeeeuhk\u2026.?\u201d\u201cKill yourself.\u201d\u201cKrreeeeeuhk!\u201dPuuuck-!The evil chimera banged its head against the floor and crushed its skull.As the undead\u2019s second life came to an end, its decayed form immediately vanished like blowing sand, leaving behind a mixture of bones from many monsters.Kang Yoonsoo picked up those various bones and began to grind them into powder.He ground all kinds of different bones, including ones that looked like a goblin\u2019s ribs, an orc\u2019s skull, and a giant\u2019s huge toe bone.Shannette, too, stood next to him and helped.Shweek\u2026.Shweek\u2026..!Kang Yoonsoo added all of the bone powder to the exploding cactus.When he lightly wrapped the hardened mixture with cloth, it resulted in a rather sphere-like ball.It was definitely the shape of a bomb.[A powerful small bombLevel \u2013 OrdinaryExplosive power: 43An easy to carry small bomb.

I want to go to sleep at the inn, ASAP.\u201dHowever, Kang Yoonsoo was not walking towards the inn.Tilting her head, Shannette asked.\u201cKang Yoonsoo, that\u2019s not the way to the inn, but to the alchemist clan.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d\u201cThen why are you going that way?\u201d\u201cTo hunt.\u201dShannette opened her eyes wide.\u201cWhat? Right\u2026 right now?\u201d\u201cYup.\u201dKang Yoonsoo took out an adrenaline potion, and handed it to Shannette.\u201cDrink it.\u201dShannette asked in a pitiful manner after receiving the potion.\u201cDo we have to, right at this minute?\u201d\u201cI told you to rest earlier.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dShe had nothing to say.After all, she was the one who had insisted on following him.Shannette gulped down the adrenaline potion.[You have drunk an adrenaline potion.You may not sleep for the next 24 hours.You can maintain extreme physical movement during that time.Most injuries will not cause pain.Your muscle and mind power is increased greatly.But, the side effects will be tremendous.]The potion which Kang Yoonsoo had made was amazing.Just by drinking it, she was no longer exhausted.Instead, she was full of energy.Although she knew it was impossible, Shanette felt like she would be able to fly just by flapping her arms, if she wanted to.Shannette shouted as she clenched her fists.\u201cThat potion\u2019s effect is truly amazing! I feel so energetic!\u201d\u201cBut the side effect is great, too.\u201d\u201cWhat side effects?\u201d\u201cThe exhaustion, pain, and muscle aches rush in all at once.\u201d\u201c\u2026..From now on, tell me those things before I drink the potion.\u201d\u201cThen you won\u2019t drink it.\u201d\u201c\u2026..I want to kill you.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d\u201cDo you really want to die?\u201dThe two once again entered the Chimera Dimension while engaging in a strange quarrel.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Urenokra!\u201d\u201cRimakruel.\u201dWhen Kang Yoonsoo spoke, White shivered.Then White grabbed the glass bottle Kang Yoonsoo offered, gulping down its contents.Shannette asked with a curious look on her face.\u201cWhat did you tell him?\u201d\u201cI told him it was good for mating.\u201d\u201c\u2026..\u201dThey began their hunt.\u201cKrreeeeeuk-!\u201dThe chimeras grew more annoying since they could spew out tree vines.They began to use binding skills from the 3rd floor on.Kang Yoonsoo quickly dodged the tree vines, and swung his great sword.Puuck-!His sword split open a chimera\u2019s head.The huge chimera shuddered and fell to the ground, throwing up blue blood.\u201cWhooo-!\u201dSally fought by spewing out spirit fire.The salamander was no longer in the form of a girl, and had transformed into a fire lizard.[Sally, the salamander, transformed into a lizard.Her fire breath grows stronger.Her movements become faster on flat surfaces.Her flame energy grows stronger in the desert.However, she is unable to use fire magic.]After transforming into a lizard, her spirit fire grew much stronger.Shannette also wielded her scythe lightly as she blocked the chimeras\u2019 path of retreat.White, on the other hand, was fighting as if there was no tomorrow.As appropriate for the boss monster of the Ultica Ruins, White ferociously slaughtered the chimeras.The group hunted the chimeras at an unusually quick pace, even though there were other hunters around.\u201cWho are they?\u201dShin Hanyul and his team members, who were fighting nearby, were impressed.At that moment, an extraordinary event took place.Buzzz-!Suddenly, everyone\u2019s terminal vibrated.When they looked at their terminals, they found a terrifying message written in red.[A mysterious flow of magic changes the attributes of the space.The sealed, A-level area, the Chimera Dimension, has been locked down.Your access in and out of the space is now limited.]Everyone looked flustered.One of the men quickly moved towards the exit.Up until now, it was possible to exit from the Chimera Dimension by walking on a shining, Milky Way like path.However, the shining light vanished into the darkness, causing the exit to disappear.The man shouted in fear.\u201cWhat, what\u2019s going on! We were just about to leave!\u201dEveryone panicked.The chimeras did not miss this opportunity.\u201cKreeeeuk-!\u201d\u201cAaahk-!\u201dTwo men were immediately clawed to death.Kang Yoonsoo calmly observed the scene.\u2018It has begun.\u2019Everyone began to fight differently, impacted by the despair that no one could get out of the space.However, that wasn\u2019t something which applied to Kang Yoonsoo.He knew the way to escape from the Chimera Dimension.Kang Yoonsoo shouted in a loud voice.\u201cEveryone, calm down. You can get out of here by killing the boss monster on the top floor.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cHow do you know that?\u201dUnexpectedly, everyone replied angrily.However, Kang Yoonsoo did not go out of his way to convince them.\u201cIt\u2019s up to you whether to believe it or not. However, remember, that is the only way out of here. You have to fight if you want to live.\u201dThat was the extent of his explanation.After all, these people would normally have been killed here, unaware of how to escape this place.Kang Yoonsoo had given them more than enough information to allow them to escape from the Chimera Dimension.Showing them any additional goodwill would not benefit him.\u201cI trust you. We just have to fight with all we\u2019ve got, right?\u201dKang Yoonsoo nodded in response to Shannette\u2019s voice.In the mean time, Shin Hanyul\u2019s team was as flustered as all the other travelers.\u201cWhat, what should we do? Hanyul!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not sure, but right now, our best bet is to trust him.\u201dShin Hanyul calmly began reciting spells.\u201cIce bringer! Fire strike!\u201dAs soon as he cast the spell, powerful magic pummeled the chimeras.Sharp pieces of ice dropped down on the chimeras, and powerful flames burned their flesh.When the chimeras were on the verge of death, four swordsmen rushed towards them and swung their swords.Lee Kanghyun was surprised to see that Shin Hanyul could remain focused under these circumstances.\u2018Indeed, he\u2019s worthy of being a White Lion Clan member.\u2019Lee Kanghyun looked at Shin Hanyul\u2019s cape.The cape, emblazoned with a white lion, was only given to members of the White Lion Clan.Made out of wyvern hide, which would not lose its durability even if it was burnt, the cape looked powerful and majestic.Shin Hanyul was the only White Lion Clan member among his team members.The four swordsmen wanted to get on Shin Hanyul\u2019s good side, in hopes of joining the White Lion Clan.As time passed, more and more people began to die.The travelers, who had been fighting against the chimeras by maintaining a defensive line, began to fall faster as the people around them died.\u201cAh, Aaaahk!\u201d\u201cHelp, help me!\u201dHowever, Shin Hanyul\u2019s team fought with all they had and survived.[You have destroyed 100 alchemical chimeras.Do you wish to move up to the next floor?]In no time, they had cleared the 3rd floor.His team members looked exhausted, but Shin Hanyul shook his head with determination.\u201cI understand that the situation has changed. But, acting leisurely now will only allow that man to take possession of the sword.\u201dThat sword was the reason Shin Hanyul\u2019s team wanted to reach the top floor of the Chimera Dimension.Shin Hanyul had gained a piece of information as he was completing the alchemist clan\u2019s secret mission.The boss monster on the 5th floor of the Chimera Dimension possessed a very rare sword.A sword that was rated rare or above was valuable just for its grade, and that meant it could be sold at a very high price.That price would jump by many folds if the sword had either strong offensive power, or some special capability.Shin Hanyul calmly said.\u201cStanding around dumbfounded will only result in our death, anyway. We\u2019ll stick to our original plan and go after the boss monster on the top floor. Before they do.\u201dIn the mean time, Kang Yoonsoo used his necromancer skill after finishing his hunt.\u201cMass resurrection.\u201d100 chimeras were reborn as undead, causing his mass resurrection skill level to grow.[Mass Resurrection skill level has risen.You can now store up to 700 undead in your summoning space.]Despite the fact that they had started later, Kang Yoonsoo\u2019s team went up to the 4th floor faster than the other travelers.There was no time for them to delay.Shin Hanyul\u2019s team also went up to the 4th floor of the Chimera Dimension.****Only those two groups had made it to the 4th floor so far.All the others were either still struggling on the floor below, or had already been killed.The chimeras on the 4th floor were big and powerful.They tied people up with tree vines, then pierced them with long spines that grew out of their bodies.Their usual short, dagger-length claws were also longer and sharper, more like swords.With White and Kang Yoonsoo taking the lead, the group fought fiercely against the chimeras.When the tree vines approached, Sally spewed out flames to burn them.Shannette, too, wielded her scythe bravely.\u201cKerrreeeeuhk-!\u201dSeveral tens of chimeras had gathered at once.It was not easy to kill monsters when they were in a large group.In fact, that situation was something that could cause a hunter to become the hunted.Kang Yoonsoo took out the small bombs from his knapsack.The bombs exploded powerfully after colliding with a chimera\u2019s pressure point or mouth.Kwaaang-!\u201cKrrreeeeuk-!\u201dThe chimeras shrieked painfully due to the explosion.When a chimera faltered due to an explosion, Sally and Shannette took away their lives with flames or scythe.With the help of the adrenaline potion, Kang Yoonsoo and his team members destroyed the chimeras without exhaustion, and made their way forward.However, Shin Hanyul\u2019s team struggled.\u201cAaaahk! Help me!\u201dOne of the swordsmen on the front line screamed.Unable to dodge or break the tree vines, he became completely entangled.As Shin Hanyul was in the middle of a large scale ice magic, he could not simultaneously cast fire magic.The others were also too busy fighting and had no time to look after someone else.Ultimately, that swordsman was bitten by the chimera that entangled him.\u201cAaaahk!\u201d\u201cI, I\u2019ll help you!\u201dWhen Lee Kanghyun was about to rush to his aid, Shin Hanyul shouted in a sharp tone of voice.\u201cLee Kanghyun! You fool! Maintain your position! Leaving the line will make the situation worse!\u201d\u201cBut, but\u2026..!\u201d\u201cYou cannot sacrifice the many for the one. That is the foundation of battle! If you want to join the White Lion Clan, just maintain your position!\u201dClenching his teeth, Lee Kanghyun held his position.The swordsman succumbed to death after getting bitten by the chimera.After many hours, the battle finally ended.[You have destroyed 100 alchemical chimeras.Do you wish to move up to the next floor?]After the battle, only Kang Yoonsoo and Shin Hanyul\u2019s teams remained.The battle was just that fierce.Kang Yoonsoo\u2019s level had risen to 57.Once again, he resurrected the slaughtered chimeras.There were now over 400 undead chimeras in the summoning space.Everyone was exhausted after having gone through the battle, and they were all injured.\u201cLet\u2019s treat ourselves before we move up to the next floor.\u201dShin Hanyul took out a healing potion from his backpack.The potion was a high quality item, costing 10 gold coins per bottle.It was also a part of the supplies provided by the Clan.Shin Hanyul cautiously treated his team\u2019s wounds by conservatively applying the potion.The bloody wounds began to slowly heal.At the same time, Shin Hanyul looked over in Kang Yoonsoo\u2019s direction.Although they weren\u2019t as badly injured as Shin Hanyul\u2019s team, Kang Yoonsoo\u2019s team had also suffered quite a bit of damage.Shin Hanyul had been saving the healing potion up until this point due to the fight against the boss monster.Even a small injury could impact them greatly in the next battle.Recuperation and healing were as important as the fight itself.\u2018Everyone is injured and exhausted. However, we are healing and recovering quicker. After only 30 minutes of rest, we should be able to go up to the next floor.\u2019So long as they went up first, it would be possible for them to overpower the boss monster before Kang Yoonsoo even arrived.However, Shin Hanyul\u2019s estimation was completely off.Kang Yoonsoo nonchalantly took out a healing potion from his bag.He applied it to Shannette and Sally\u2019s wounds.White roared as if he didn\u2019t like it, but he ultimately gave in at Kang Yoonsoo\u2019s insistence.Kang Yoonsoo liberally applied the precious healing potion as though it was water.If he saw that the wounds weren\u2019t healing fast enough, he simply took out another potion and poured it on them.Sally, having returned to the form of a girl, played in the puddle of liquid formed by the potions.\u201cWhoa! Sally does not like water, but this feels great!\u201dShin Hanyul\u2019s team, who were applying a single potion in a very conservative manner, looked at them dumbfounded.On top of that, Kang Yoonsoo\u2019s healing potion was much more effective than Shin Hanyul\u2019s.The wounds his team had suffered healed instantly.\u2018What, what is that, anyway?\u2019Shin Hanyul doubted what he had seen.Unless it was concocted by a great alchemist, the a healing potion wouldn\u2019t take effect that fast.What was more astounding to Shin Hanyul was the fact that Kang Yoonsoo did not have to use a single drop of the potion on himself.He was not injured at all during that fierce battle?Shin Hanyul wanted to look closer, but Kang Yoonsoo\u2019s team had already vanished.They have gone up to the 5th floor, long before Shin Hanyul\u2019s team.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 24": "Chapter 24Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe 5th floor was the most remarkable space in the Chimera Dimension.The sun, moon, and stars were all visible in the sky.At the same time, a bluish, Milk Way like river flowed on the ground.Smiling widely, Sally gathered star dust in her hands.She quickly ran to Kang Yoonsoo.\u201cDaddy, daddy, look at this. So pretty!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fake.\u201d\u201cAwwwww! Mommy!\u201dShannette had to console Sally, whose childish heart had been shattered.White displayed his fangs, looking around the area in search of prey.\u201cKareeeeung\u2026! Rarumarcro?\u201dThe space beyond the river wavered as a blurry shape suddenly appeared.The shape appeared to be similar to a human, but it was clearly unnatural.It had no hair, and every part of its body appeared pitch black.But the most attention-grabbing part was the sword that was held in its hand.A sharp long sword was attached to its right palm.Then came a cracking voice.\u201cYou foolish\u2026\u2026 Alchemists\u2026.\u201d[Alchemical life form Homunculus Lavian (Boss, level 132) has appeared!]The boss monster of the Chimera Dimension.Homunculus Lavian nodded his head slowly, causing the expansive space to twist.[Lavian is the being that rules the Chimera Dimension.If you defeat Lavian, you can escape from the locked Chimera Dimension.]The only way to survive was to kill the boss monster.At this time, they had to put everything into the fight.\u2018Lavian is not a monster that can be killed with a single swing of the sword.\u2019This fight must be fought for the long haul.Kang Yoonsoo extended his right arm.\u201cSummon 54 dark land worms. Summon 400 evil chimeras.\u201dGnashing their teeth, the dark land worms and evil chimeras appeared.It was a force made up of over 400 undead.Kang Yoonsoo pointed at Homunculus Lavian.\u201cKill him.\u201dA fierce battle broke out.Sally shouted as she twirled flame around her hands.\u201cArm with flame!\u201dIt was a Salamander\u2019s magic, which coated a weapon with fire.Remarkably, every member of the undead troop was now covered in flames.As the undead did not feel any pain, engulfing them in fire did not harm them at all.In fact, as soon as the flames engulfed them, the rate of their attacks became faster.The fire-coated land worms and chimeras fiercely attacked Homunculus Lavian.\u201cAnnoying\u2026 you petty beings\u2026.\u201dHomunculus Lavian swung his left arm downwards through the air.As a part of the dimension split open, ferocious chimeras spilled out of the tear.The chimeras collided with the flame engulfed undead army, causing flesh and sparks to fly.The chimeras summoned by Lavian used restraining or confusion skills to wreak havoc on the battlefield.The undead army collectively pushed forward, overrunning any lone individuals.Kang Yoonsoo swung his great sword and cut off a chimera\u2019s head.Shannette, who was beginning to harness the power of the shard of strength, focused her enormous strength towards cutting up the chimeras.With a hurricane-like pace, White dashed toward Lavian, the strongest being in the field.His beastly thirst for blood would not be satisfied by attacking the other weaklings.\u201cUrenokra~!\u201dWhite\u2019s claws swung towards the Homunculus\u2019 neck.Lavian quickly swung the sword on his right arm.Chaang-!As the sword clashed against its claws, White growled in anger and pulled back.Lavian wasn\u2019t an adversary that could be defeated in a one on one battle.Besides, Lavian\u2019s sword was beyond extraordinary.Had it been an ordinary steel sword, it would have been shattered by now, but Lavian was able to use it to push back White\u2019s claw attacks.\u201cLaughable\u2026.\u201dPutting on a small smile, Lavian moved his left arm.After making a small sign, the homunculus shouted.\u201cAlchemists, look\u2026! The fearsome power of the remnants which you\u2019ve thrown out\u2026!\u201dBlue magic flowed around Lavian, before it soon dispersed throughout the space.In a moment, the chimeras\u2019 corpses began to wiggle.Everything, including the heads, legs, and arms which had all been dismembered, wiggled.The pieces of the corpses attached to the undead and attempted to dig into them.Then, Kang Yoonsoo shouted.\u201cCorpse explosion.\u201dKwaang-!\u201cUuuuk\u2026!\u201dThe chimera corpses, which were gathered around Lavian, all exploded.The force of the explosion was powerful, and the wiggling pieces of the dead chimeras vanished into powder.Corpse explosion was a powerful skill, but each attack used a lot of magic power.However, Kang Yoonsoo used it repeatedly without any hesitation.\u201cCorpse explosion. Corpse explosion. Corpse explosion.\u201dKwang-! Kwaang-! Kwaaang-!A series of corpses exploded with each shout.Although the remaining body parts still wiggled about, they could not cause much damage.With murderous look in his eyes, Lavian stared at Kang Yoonsoo.\u201cYou\u2026 You are trying to sabotage my revenge\u2026!\u201dLavian, who had maintained his position at the back of the chimeras, finally took a step forward.The long sword on Lavian\u2019s right arm was pointed at Kang Yoonsoo, as if it was seeking his blood.However, Kang Yoonsoo did not engage in a one to one battle.\u201cLife drain.\u201dGreenish white energy flowed out from the tip of Kang Yoonsoo\u2019s sword, and it began to absorb Lavian\u2019s longevity and life force.Feeling even more agitated, Lavian swung his sword fiercely.However, Kang Yoonsoo dodged every time Lavian drew close.It was as if he already knew which direction Lavian was going to come at him from.Kang Yoonsoo caused an explosion by throwing a small bomb.Kwaang-!The heat from the explosion engulfed Lavian.Every time a bomb exploded, part of Lavian\u2019s body took damage, causing him to continue to lose health.\u201cYou, rat, bastard\u2026!\u201dLavian stabbed the sword on his right arm into one of his chimeras.The stabbed chimera shrieked in pain as it dried up.Lavian\u2019s life force was recovered after his attack, and his sword became even more destructive and powerful.\u201cYou\u2019ll\u2026 All die\u2026!\u201dIndiscriminately, Lavian sliced up the undead army.This was the terror of Homunculus Lavian.Even if his life force was depleted, he could immediately recover stamina and magic power through the sword.He was certainly a difficult adversary, worthy of being the boss monster of the Chimera Dimension.The countless undead were pulverized into powder by Lavian\u2019s strikes, and many chimeras fell as well.However, with the collaborative efforts of Kang Yoonsoo, who was continuously throwing bombs and using life drain, and his allies\u2019 attacks, Lavian\u2019s health was quickly depleting.It was when the fight was about to end.Four people appeared in a flash of light on the far side of the battlefield.\u201cPhew, we\u2019re finally up here\u2026 What! What\u2019s going on?\u201dShocked, Lee Kanghyun could not close his mouth.His companions were in the same boat.The fight against the boss monster was much fiercer than they had anticipated.The area was messy, filled with so many chimeras\u2019 corpses it seemed more like a war than a boss battle.\u201cWe should join them. I\u2019ll take care of the rear, you take the front.\u201dShin Hanyul said calmly.His companions nodded in response, calming down.\u201cSword\u2019s spirit!\u201dThe swordsmen all used high level skills before joining the battle.While the swordsmen worried about Kang Yoonsoo\u2019s safety, Shin Hanyul was thinking about something completely different.\u2018The boss\u2019 stamina has reduced quite a bit.\u2019Lavian was still fighting hard, but he also looked exhausted.His attempts to absorb life force from the surrounding chimeras was often thwarted by Kang Yoonsoo throwing a bomb.At this rate, Shin Hanyul would lose the accomplishment of hunting the boss monster, and therefore lose the sword, to Kang Yoonsoo.\u2018That cannot happen.\u2019Biting his lips, Shin Hanyul took out a rolled piece of lamb skin.It was a mid-level magic scroll.Since it could cast magic simply by being torn, the scroll was sold at a very high price.After promising that he would shortly reach level 100, Shin Hanyul had received it from the Clan.If he used it poorly, Shin Hanyul would be scolded by the clan, let alone feeling it was a waste himself.\u2018But I don\u2019t have time to think about it right now.\u2019Shin Hanyul ripped the scroll without hesitation.A strange magic power flowed out of the scroll and coagulated in the air.Finally, an electric spear appeared in the air.It was the mid-level magic lighting javelin, a spell useful for nimble, quick attacks.Blue electricity could easily be seen flowing through the spear.Shin Hanyul didn\u2019t stop there, shouting.\u201cMana flow!\u201dIt was one of the high level skills of a sorcerer.By channeling his mana for a period of time, Shin Hanyul could greatly strengthen a spell.The lightning javelin grew in size, big enough to strike across the battle field.\u2018I can get him with this!\u2019Shin Hanyul looked at Lavian in the distance.Although he was quite far away, Shin Hanyul was sure that he could hit Lavian.\u201cEveryone disperse!\u201dWhen Shin Hanyul shouted, the people in the battle field split to either side.He threw the lightning javelin with all his might.The electric spear left behind a trail of blue electricity as it flew.His magic accurately landed on Lavian\u2019s chest.Pazzzz-!Powerful lightning engulfed the area, causing a stream of black smoke to rise.Lavian had been about to die, and the area fell silent as if he was now dead.Shin Hanyul smiled with relief.\u2018It\u2019s done. I\u2019m sure.\u2019At that moment.A large hand waved away the black smoke.Homunculus Lavian stood up, not having suffered a single injury.That wasn\u2019t everything.Having absorbed the electricity, Lavian grew bigger and stronger.A powerful electric current also flashed around the edge of his sword.\u201cYou, foolish ones\u2026! You are asking for death\u2026!\u201d[Homunclus Lavian has absorbed the mid level magic lightning javelin.The potential of the sword has awakened, and Lavian\u2019s lost life force has recovered.]Everyone, including Shin Hanyul, looked shocked.He absorbed the magic?The information they had gathered didn\u2019t include the Homunculus having such a trait.Shin Hanyul\u2019s secret magic had, in fact, helped the boss monster recover to his original strength, even though he had been almost dead moments before.Instantly, everyone appeared to have lost their fighting spirit.However, there was one exception.When everyone hesitated, unsure what to do, one man moved forward.Without saying anything, Kang Yoonsoo pointed his great sword at Lavian.Lavian snickered.\u201cYou want to face me, after I\u2019ve become this powerful\u2026? You\u2019re a fool\u2026.\u201d\u201cThe reward is better if I kill you after you absorb magic.\u201dLavian\u2019s face crumpled.\u201cYou must not\u2026 Value your life\u2026!\u201dLavian fiercely swung his lightning-cloaked sword.Lowering his stance, Kang Yoonsoo dodged.At the same moment, a brilliant light flowed out of his silver mane wrist guard.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

An appropriate ancient wolf spirit will manifest.]It was the silver mane wrist guard, which Kang Yoonsoo obtained in the Ultica Ruins.Kang Yoonsoo has just triggered the item\u2019s special ability.The strange light which flowed out of the wrist guard formed a blurry shape.It was a red wolf, whose size was even larger than Lavian.[Krrrrrr!]Everyone was in awe.White was especially shocked, and looked as if the world had suddenly come to an end.\u201cKaruk? Lironomoke!\u201dThe red wolf howled fiercely.[Awoooooooo-!]The spirit of the wolf rushed over and flowed into Kang Yoonsoo\u2019s body.The red energy completely engulfed Kang Yoonsoo.[The powerful wolf Auron has entered the wearer.Physical strength greatly increased.Muscle mass greatly enhanced.Damage resistance strengthened.Resistance to fire and ice increased.You can now handle a two handed weapon with one hand.You can now move as fast as a tornado.After a fixed amount of time, you will suffer pain which will make you wish you were dead.]A change took place in Kang Yoonsoo\u2019s physique.Although he was already tall, balanced muscles grew on his rather skinny build.Kang Yoonsoo has become a rather big giant.He was full of energy.However, Kang Yoonsoo sighed internally.\u2018The ancient wolf\u2019s possession is quite effective, but side effects are intense. I must finish this quickly.\u2019\u201cYou bastard\u2026 I\u2019ll kill you\u2026!\u201dLavian swung his sword.Tens of lightning bolts struck towards Kang Yoonsoo.Pazzzzz-!However, Kang Yoonsoo did not dodge them.In fact, he intentionally let the lightning hit him.Incredible pain washed over him, but his expression did not change at all.Since Kang Yoonsoo bore the brunt of the attack, everyone behind him remained safe.\u201cKang Yoonsoo!\u201dShannete screamed desperately.She has seen Kang Yoonsoo do many strange thing so far, but she had never seen him get injured.That same Kang Yoonsoo was now fighting the monster even though he was being attacked.Her hands clenched around her scythe.Kang Yoonsoo was able to endure the lightning bolts.Black smoke rose up from his body, but he firmly held his big sword.The veins in his arm bulged.Dashing forward, Kang Yoonsoo swung his sword with all his might.Puuck-!Lavian, who was able to stand strong against White, was pushed back.The homunculus screamed as his chest was sliced open.\u201cKrrrrreuck\u2026!\u201dKang Yoonsoo\u2019s swing was not only powerful, but so fast it was almost impossible to dodge.Great swords normally had incredible power, but they moved quite slowly.However, Kang Yoonsoo\u2019s great sword followed an agile and smooth curve when he swung it.The injury from the sword caused Lavian to be pushed backwards.However, even though he was pushed back, Lavian also swung his long sword, swinging downward with all his strength.\u201cTurn into\u2026 a pile of ash\u2026!\u201dPazzz-!Many lightning bolts struck alongside the sword attack.Without missing a beat, Kang Yoonsoo blocked every single attack.He performed a series of defensive moves that made it hard to believe he was using a great sword.Although he felt a stinging shock every time the electricity made contact with his palm, he continued to swing his sword without any reaction.However, as Lavian\u2019s sword continued to attack nonstop, Kang Yoonsoo\u2019s sword was cracking, little by little.\u201cShannette, Sally, and White. Support me.\u201dThe three of them, who had lost their focus at the sudden turn of events, quickly came back to their senses.Sally infused flames into every weapon, turned into a lizard once more, and used the wrath of flame skill.White growled, engaging in the battle with a different attitude than before.If it had previously been fighting because it was enraged, now it was only fighting in order to help Kang Yoonsoo.Although Shannette did not have any particular technique, she dashed to join the battle, determined to assist however she could.Although it was small, Lavian began to accumulate damage once more.\u201cShould, should we also help?\u201dTurning to Shin Hanyul, Lee Kanghyun asked.However, seeing that his magic had only strengthened Lavian, Shin Hanyul felt despair and was unable to make a decision.Lee Kanghyun hesitated and bit his lips, before yelling at the other members.\u201cLet\u2019s go! We, too, will help Kang Yoonsoo!\u201d\u201cWhoaaaa!\u201dThe swordsmen swung their swords with all their might.Although lightning bolts fell with every swing that Lavian made, Kang Yoonsoo stepped forward and absorbed all the attacks.No matter how capable he was of absorbing damage, he could not have continued for so long without having superhuman willpower.Each time Kang Yoonsoo struck Lavian with his great sword, the homunculus was pushed back, gritting his teeth.Although Kang Yoonsoo\u2019s strength overpowered Lavian, the cracks had reached the tip of his sword.As the tip of the sword broke, the power of its attack became noticeably weaker.\u201cShannette.\u201dKang Yoonsoo spoke calmly and quietly.Having understood the situation, Shannette immediately threw her scythe with all her might.Kang Yoonsoo picked up the scythe with his left hand, and, holding the great sword in his right hand, swung the two flame engulfed weapons downwards in a criss-cross pattern.Sheeek-!The homunclus\u2019 chest was split open.Lavian died in the end.\u201cMinerva\u2026 A blood revenge on all the alchemists\u2026!\u201dLavian\u2019 body turned into powder and vanished.All that remained was a red heart and the longsword.After picking up the items that Homunculus Lavian had dropped, Kang Yoonsoo plopped down to the ground.His body, which had gained bulging muscles, quickly returned to normal.He threw away the shattered great sword.[You\u2019ve defeated the alchemical life form Homunculus Lavian (boss, level 132).Your level has increased by 16.]\u201cWe, we won!\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re good! We\u2019re going to live!\u201dLee Kanghyun\u2019s teammates hugged each other.At that moment.Zzzzzz\u2026!\u201cThe space, the space is falling apart!\u201d\u201cThe Chimera Dimension is falling apart because the boss is dead!\u201d\u201cWe have to leave, now!\u201dThere, far in the distance, they saw a crack opening.White and Sally quickly returned to the summoning space, and all of the people dashed toward the exit as quickly as they could.Shannette hurriedly turned back and looked at Kang Yoonsoo.\u201cKang Yoonsoo, let\u2019s go out quickly. It\u2019s dangerous!\u201dHowever, Kang Yoonsoo did not stand up.Instead, he fell down completely.Shannette\u2019s eyes widened.Kang Yoonsoo\u2019s body was shivering all over.As his bulging muscles returned to normal, they began to hurt terribly.On top of that, he has also taken a lot of damage during the fierce battle.\u2018Feel like dying.\u2019He could not move on his own.Kang Yoonsoo said quietly to the panicking Shannette.\u201cShannette.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dKang Yoonsoo said earnestly.\u201cCarry me on your back.\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201dShannette put Kang Yoonsoo on her back.With all her might, she ran towards the crumbling exit of the Chimera Dimension.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Thank you very much!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll never forget your help!\u201dThe men, including Lee Kanghyun, bowed their heads multiple times as they thanked Kang Yoonsoo.Kang Yoonsoo took the blunt of the lightning with his body, and eventually killed Lavian.If it wasn\u2019t for him, they were as good as dead, already.However, Kang Yoonsoo was just busy untying his own wrists and ankles.\u201cHe must be very tired.\u201dShannette, who was massaging Kang Yoonsoo\u2019s thighs, quickly spoke.As Kang Yoonsoo did not even have a bit of social skill, she thought to speak on behalf of him.Although Kang Yoonsoo did not respond, Lee Kanghyun and his team members thanked him several times.Lee Kanghyun was about to give something out of his leather pouch as a thank you gesture, but Kang Yoonsoo shook his head.\u201cNo need.\u201d\u201cReally? You don\u2019t need to turn it down.\u201dLee Kanghyun turned his head.He stared at Shin Hanyul who was standing without saying much.\u201cHanyul, shouldn\u2019t you be saying something to thank him, also?\u201dThe other swordsmen looked at him in not such a favorable way, either.It was because Shin Hanyul has already lost the team\u2019s trust.Their respect for him began to shake off from the moment that he had ordered to desert one of their own comrades.To add to that, they were nearly killed by the side effects of his magic that had gone awry.Even under the circumstances in which unexpected results were produced, it was Shin Hanyul\u2019s role to issue timely and appropriate orders.Having kept silent for a long while, Shin Hanyul spoke.However, it was very far from saying a thank you.\u201cYou, you already knew that Lavian was going to absorb the magic?\u201dKang Yoonsoo remained silent.Shin Hanyul was no fool.He said without any hesitation.\u201cYou said it before. That the reward was greater when he was killed after absorbing the magic. Kang Yoonsoo, you already knew that the boss monster was going to absorb the magic. Then why did you not tell me, a sorcerer class, that fact?\u201d\u201cLook, Hanyul. Still, we suffered no casualties because Kang Yoonsoo personally fought for everyone.\u201dLee Kanghyun spoke in defense of him, but Shin Hanyul just put on more vicious expression on his face.\u201cQuiet. Had this person given me that information, that precious magic scroll would not have been wasted like that.\u201dIn fact, he got angry.\u201cCome to think of it, that was strange. How did you also know that the only way out of the Chimera Dimension was to kill Lavian? What are you, anyway?\u201dThen Kang Yoonsoo spoke.\u201cI already knew it.\u201dShin Hanyul made sarcastic remarks in a scathing fashion.\u201cHa! I knew it. Did you push others to the brink of death in order to claim all the rewards by yourself? Others could have died. You must have really wanted to act like a hero?\u201dKang Yoonsoo slowly got up.He walked towards Shin Hanyul.Kang Yoonsoo extended out his right arm, and Shin Hanyul took a cautionary posture.Soon, Kang Yoonsoo grasped the clamp on the white lion cape.Everyone who was close to them opened their eyes wide.In a very brief moment of time, Kang Yoonsoo stole Shin Hanyul\u2019s cape without much effort.Kang Yoonsoo\u2019s hand movements were natural, and no one could even visually catch the actual act of stealing the cape.Everyone even felt that no one, including a thief who stole for many, many years, would have such a talent.Fluttered, Shin Hanyul spoke.\u201cWhat, what is this? Now, you want to take someone else\u2019s cape, too?\u201dKang Yoonsoo shook his head.\u201cI told you. That I knew already.\u201dKang Yoonsoo threw the white lion cape towards the fireplace.The cape slowly burned away inside the crackling fireplace.Shannette had a curious look in her.Why is Kang Yoonsoo acting in such a meaningless way?He wasn\u2019t someone who would ever act driven by impulsive emotions.However, Shannette and other people\u2019s responses were completely different.\u201cWhat, what is that?\u201d\u201cThat cape burns so quickly like that?\u201d\u201cThe white lion cape, given by the clan, is made out of wyvern hide. It would never lose its strength in fire?\u201dLee Kanghyun\u2019s team was made up of people who desperately wanted to join the White Lion Clan.As such, they were well studied in the white lion cape, the symbol of the clan.Kang Yoonsoo took out a part of the burned cape from the fireplace.It was the part of the drawing on the cape in which the white eyes of the white lion were roaring towards the king\u2019s throne.\u201cIn the first place, the white lion\u2019s eyes on the cape provided by the White Lion Clan are blue. This lion\u2019s eyes are white. With time, the color has faded. This cape is a fake.\u201dEveryone now looked at Shin Hanyul with different attitude.Lee Kanghunn\u2019s team members\u2019 hands were even noticeably shaking.We travelled with you for the sole purpose of joining the White Clan, but, he was a con artist?However, Shin Hanyul was visibly upset.\u201cDo not kid me! Do you have a proof?\u201dShin Hanyul was certainly thick faced.However, there was not a very clear proof, anywhere.This remote place in the south did not even have any member of the White Lion Clan for the purpose of comparing the cape against his/hers.\u201cGosh, this is ridiculous. How could you accuse a White Lion Clan member as being a fake, like this, without even any proofs. You just simply ruined a precious cape. For crying out loud.\u201dHowever, unlike his insistent defense, he tried to quickly leave the building.At that moment, a loud voice was heard.The voice was accompanied by some laughter, but it certainly was one with an aura of confidence.\u201cDo not worry! A proof has just walked in here, like this.\u201dAn impressive looking man walked into the alchemist clan\u2019s building.Seeing the grayish white armor suit and bright, glittering cape which he was wearing pointed to the fact that he was someone of a high statured.Lee Kanghyun and other men could not close their opened mouths as they looked at the ingrained symbol on the man\u2019s cape.\u201cIt\u2019s white\u2026, a meshed symbol of a white lion and fire!\u201d\u201cThe unique class cape made out of white lion\u2019s hide by the emperor\u2019s tailor!\u201dAfter looking at one another, they gulped their dry mouths.They could not believe it.Lee Kanghyun asked with a shaky voice.\u201cIs, is. Ha, Han Saehyun! Are you Han Saehyun, the captain of the White Lion Clan?\u201dThe man scratched his cheek and appeared embarrassed.\u201cThere is no one who recognizes me in a glance, like that\u2026 You must be quite an observant?\u201d\u201cWhoaaa! Can I please have your autograph!\u201dLee Kanghyun and other men all looked as if they could take their hearts out for him.Han Saehyun smiled and kindly declined.On the other hand, Shin Hanyul shouted in a harsh tone.\u201cHan Saehyun? The captain of the White Lion Clan? Don\u2019t kid me! Why would a man of that great stature even walk in to a remote place like this?\u201d\u201cHmm. Certainly, the captain of the White Lion Clan does not like petty and annoying things.\u201dHan Saehyun put on smiled briefly.He was certainly smiling on the outside, but his inside felt much colder than anything.\u201cThe captain of the White Lion Clan does not leave the capitol over small things. I\u2019ll tell you the two reasons why I came here in person then.\u201dHan Saehyun showed his pointer.\u201cFirst, I heard the rumor that there, in this Chimera Dimension, exists an evidence for the quest which I have been desperately searching for. That reason was sufficient already for me to come to this remote location from the head-quarter in the capitol. However, unfortunately, someone had already attacked the Chimera Dimension.\u201dWhile saying that, he subtly looked in to Kang Yoonsoo\u2019s direction.However, he soon turned his attention and continued.Han Saehyun\u2019s voice was cold.\u201cSecond, someone named Kang Yoonsoo had sent a message via the alchemist clan. That some idiotic person was daring enough to con people by claiming to be a member of my clan. As a result, I quickly flew to this place by hurrying the itinerary.\u201dKang Yoonsoo was the person who sent the pigeon-gram when he had first visited the alchemist clan.That man was no other than the captain of the White Lion Clan Han Saehyun.\u201cNo, no way! You, you called the captain of the White Lion Clan, just to catch me, me?\u201dShin Hanyul exaggeratingly shouted as if he wanted to deny the truth.He shook with unimaginable fear.As Han Saehyun approached, Shin Hanyul gritted his teeth and pulled down his shirt.A cringed, devilish looking black tiger tattoo was visible on the collarbone.\u201cDon\u2019t, don\u2019t come any closer! If you are the captain of the White Lion Clan, you must know what this tattoo means? If you harm me, it is a declaration of war on our clan!\u201d\u201cHmm. I have no interest in looking at a tattoo on another man\u2019s collarbone.\u201dHan Saehyun smiled once, and lightly placed his finger at the tattoo.Paddddeuck-!Shin Hanyul\u2019s clavicle got immediately crushed.\u201cAaaahk-!\u201dShin Hanyul shrieked with the acute, unbearable pain.Han Saehyun, using only one hand, grasped his shirt around his neck.Then an incomparably coarse voice came out of his vocal cord.\u201cDeclaration of war? Don\u2019t be silly. Have you seen a lion that fears a kitten?\u201d\u201cEcough! E-Aaack-!\u201dShin Hanyul painfully coughed.However, Han Saehyun spoke in a merciless tone.\u201cAs expected, you are a black tiger clan bastard. You have foolishly decided to show off after you\u2019ve gotten some fame in the back alleys, ha! Is your captain still enjoying the spoils from dealing drugs?\u201d\u201cAaaack\u2026 Aaack! I\u2019m, I\u2019m sorry. Please, please spare me! Please!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll just put a stain on my hand by killing a low life like you. Tell your captain. His life will not be spared if he keeps up this imitation cape business, but then by the way, are you even in the position to talk to your captain directly?\u201d\u201cI, I\u2019ll relay the message\u2026! For sure, I will\u2026!\u201dAs if it was a bother, Han Saehyun threw Shin Hanyul.Rolling to the ground, Shin Hanyul fell to the floor.Swaying severely, he ran out of the alchemist building.Lee Kanghyun and other men all cheered.\u201cThat, that was truly great!\u201d\u201cMy name is Kim Sangchul! I pray you will remember!\u201d\u201cI, I\u2019m Ahn Hyungsoo! Please, remember me, too!\u201dHan Saehyun was neither, hearing or not hearing them.Han Saehyun, passing by them, walked towards Kang Yoonsoo.After smiling, he spoke.\u201cWhat is your name?\u201d\u201cKang Yoonsoo.\u201d\u201cYou are the person that sent me the message. I\u2019m getting hungry having travelled from far. I want to take some food, would you like to join me?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201dHan Saehyun was embarrassed as if to say that he didn\u2019t expect his invitation to be turned down.Shannette, who was sitting next to him, said quickly.\u201cPlease forgive the rudeness. Such a way of speaking does not work on Kang Yoonsoo.\u201dHan Saehyun sheepishly smiled when he heard her.\u201cThen you, my pretty lady, know of any way to share a dinner with that man? Ah, and if it\u2019s OK with you, your name, also.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m Shannette Elogran. And, um\u2026 To do that.\u201dShannette whispered something into his ear.Looking very curious, Han Saehyun walked towards Kang Yoonsoo.And he said lightly.\u201cLet\u2019s have a drink.\u201d\u201cSure.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 27": "Chapter 27Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayHan Saehyun brought Kang Yoonsoo to a rundown bar.Tired, Shannette said that she will go directly to the inn to get rested.Although Lee Kanghyun and other men insisted on coming along, Han Saehyun refused them by telling them that he wanted to have a private conversation with Kang Yoonsoo.Sitting at a corner table, they placed an order.\u201cTwo glasses of lime wine. And one order of non greasy side dish.\u201d\u201cAh, yes, yes, right away.\u201dAs Han Saehyun gave her a smile, the lady server turned red and ran towards the kitchen as if she was running away from someone.Now, it was certain that the women, who were in the kitchen, would be fully engaged in gossips over handsome, strange men.The lime wine was served in big glasses.The order of barbeque chicken wings, as a side dish, came out looking rather moist over its grilled skin.Untying the belt on his armor suit, Han Saehyun sat comfortably.\u201cDo you enjoy doing things in roundabout ways?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cNeither do I. So, I\u2019ll get right to it.\u201dAfter taking a drink of the lime wine, Han Saehyun spoke.\u201cI\u2019ve heard, at the alchemist clan, that you killed Lavian, the boss monster of the top floor of the Chimera Dimension.\u201dWithout taking his lips off of the wine glass, Kang Yoonsoo nodded slowly.It was a very intricate movement, but Han Saehyun did not pay much attention to it.Taking a piece of the chicken wing, Han Saehyun took a bite and swallowed it whole.\u201cYou probably took the possession of the non-decaying heart(core) after you killed that Homunclus. I\u2019d like to buy that core from you.\u201d\u201cNot for sale.\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019d like, I can compensate you enough so that you can live out your life in comfort, so that you no longer need to be obsessed with the level.\u201d\u201cNot selling it.\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019ll have to kill you.\u201dKang Yoonsoo looked at Han Saehyun in nonchalant way.Han Saehyun smiled.His lips were still smiling, but his eyes were cold.\u201cYou\u2019re not selling. Then I have to kill you and take it away from you. No other way, right.\u201dHan Saehyun spoke informally in a natural way.It was because Kang Yoonsoo was speaking in an informal way, first anyway.Then bending forward, Han Saehyun approached closer to Kang Yoonsoo.He pointed his pointer finger to Kang Yoonsoo\u2019s neck in a natural way.Then there formed a ball of blood on Kang Yoonsoo\u2019s neck.It happened as if the area has been cut by something very sharp.The finger was sharp beyond one\u2019s imagination.\u2018Sword stream skill.\u2019It is the unique skill of Han Saehyun.It makes even a finger to be as sharp as a sword\u2019s edge.It was not an over statement to say that Han Saehyun was one of the most powerful men among all the explorers in the continent.In his past lives, there had been a number of occasions in which he was almost killed, several times, after carrying out the assassination assignment on Han Saehyun.However, that was in the old days.He had no intention of killing Han Saehyun in his thousand life times.Yet, smiling lightly, Han Saehyun was still wielding his finger in a soft fashion.\u201cI wish you weren\u2019t a dimwit. Not everyone in the world avoids killing.\u201dKang Yoonsoo nonchalantly stared at Han Saehyun.\u201cI know.\u201d\u201cThen give me the Lavian\u2019s core.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t want to.\u201dHan Saehyun had an expression of not able to believe what he has just heard.\u201cThen are you choosing to die?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t kill me.\u201d\u201cHmm. How can you be so sure of that?\u201d\u201cCuz you want to be an emperor.\u201dHan Saehyun raised his finger in a side way as if he was holding a sword.He looked curious.\u201cI want to be an emperor?\u201d\u201cYup.\u201d\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d\u201cThe white lion roars towards the king\u2019s throne.\u201dIt was the relevant description of what was on the cape supplied by the White Lion Clan.Kang Yoonsoo said with firmness.\u201cA beast does not kill for no reason. It just roars at its prey.\u201dAt that moment, the sharpness of the finger, which was touching the neck, has disappeared.There was only the sense of a normal finger.Han Saehyun lowered his finger.He remained silent for a while.\u201cHahaha!\u201dSuddenly, Han Saehyun broke out into laughter.On the other hand, Kang Yoonsoo remained expressionless.However, unimpressed, Han Saehyun kept laughing as if it was his greatest day of his life.\u201cThis is a first! I\u2019ve never met anyone, so, interesting as you since I\u2019ve come over to this place. Really, I like you. I\u2019ve never seen anyone who spoke so calmly even with a knife pointed at his neck. You know, I want to chat some more?\u201d\u201cNot what I wanted to hear.\u201dKang Yoonsoo\u2019s response was cold.Still, Han Saehyun was full of smiles.It was certainly different than the smiles he just had on earlier.Kang Yoonsoo said in a quiet voice.\u201cStop the quest that you are pursuing at the moment. You won\u2019t complete it anyway.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re telling me to forego Lavian\u2019s core? Then what are you going to give me in return?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll make you an emperor.\u201dHan Saehyun\u2019s eyes sparkled.\u201cYou\u2026 You\u2019ll be my emperor maker?\u201d\u201cYup.\u201dKang Yoonsoo nodded.It was because with that short response, he knew that his plan and itinerary were going to be facilitated much easier.\u201cHow?\u201d\u201cI have a way.\u201dThe two men talked for a long while.As Han Saehyun listened more to Kang Yoonsoo, his expression grew more serious.What began as a blurry objective began to take on a firm shape.The adversary clan\u2019s head-quarter. The plan to place a mole. A way to infiltrate himself!The highly classified intelligence information flew out of Kang Yoonsoo\u2019s mouth.The way that Han Saehyun looked at Kang Yoonsoo has changed.*****By the time their conversation came to an end, it was already twilight.After exiting the bar, Han Saehyun extended his hand out.\u201cFrom now on, I\u2019ve decided to trust you. I\u2019ll mobilize my members at your appointed time, and launch an attack against that clan. Of course, I\u2019ll be there, too.\u201dHis voice was filled with absolute confidence.\u201cFrom now on, we are silent partners. I\u2019ll support you whatever you do from now on, and you, too, will help me.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t want to shake hands.\u201d\u201cOh? You must be a germophobe.\u201dHan Saehyun awkwardly withdrew his hand.In fact, he hasn\u2019t withdrawn his sword stream skill, yet.Although he said they were in a silent partnership, he was cautiously testing Kang Yoonsoo\u2019s foresight.He made a proposal.\u201cBy the way, do you have an intention of joining the White Lion Clan? For someone like you, I can immediately promote you to a lieutenant level. I\u2019ll support you with the highest quality items at each level, too. It is a special treatment which no one else gets the benefit of.\u201d\u201cNot at all.\u201dHan Saehyun simpered.\u201cCan\u2019t believe you declined such an offer so quickly. You must really be senseless even more than a wooden statue?\u201d\u201cAnd you are an annoying bastard.\u201dAfter laughing hawkishly, he tapped on Kang Yoonsoo\u2019s chest with his fist.It was a way to telling Kang Yoonsoo that he has withdrawn the sword stream skill.Han Saehyun said in a friendly tone of voice.\u201cLook for me first when you come to the capitol. I\u2019ll treat you to a much better drinking establishment, unlike this old place. Ah, and bring the pretty girl, too.\u201dKang Yoonsoo nodded slowly.After putting on a smile, he extended out his right arm.\u201cSummoning Gryphon Armyan.\u201dA gold winged gryphon appeared with a flash of light.The people\u2019s attention was immediately drawn to it.Before attracting too much attention, Han Saehyun quickly got on top of the gryphon.He spoke, looking at Kang Yoonsoo.\u201cLike I said earlier, I\u2019ll wait for you to come to me. I\u2019ll not forget the conversation we had. The promise we\u2019ve made, hope you never forget.\u201d\u201cRight.\u201dKang Yoonsoo gave a terse reply.Flapping its wings, the gryphon rose up high into the sky.Han Saehyun soon disappeared.Kang Yoonsoo went directly to his room as soon as he got back to the inn.With unorganized hair, Shannette was drooling over her pillow as she slept.It was because her stamina has run out due to the adrenaline potion\u2019s side effect.When Kang Yoonsoo came into the room, she raised her head, half asleep.\u201cSlurp\u2026 You\u2019re back? How was the talk?\u201d\u201cToo long.\u201dAs if he was falling down, Kang Yoonsoo fell forward onto the bed which Shannette was sleeping on.Shannette, being too exhausted, did not even realize that he was lying next to her, either.\u2018Tired.\u2019Kang Yoonsoo fell asleep right away as if he had lost his consciousness.*****The morning sun ray came in through the window.Shannette woke up.And she was in shock.Just next to her was Kang Yoonsoo who was sleeping with his face so close to hers.The sound of his breathing was tickling her ear.That wasn\u2019t everything.From Kang Yoonsoo\u2019s knapsack, a wet chunk of meat was coming out of it.As if it was a snail, the chunk of meat was crawling around the floor as it colored the floor with blood.Chrrr\u2026 Churrrr\u2026.The core was moving as if it was alive.It was a strange scene.\u201cEaaaahk!\u201dShannette began the day by screaming in the morning.\u201cKang Yoonsoo! Kang Yoonsoo!\u201d\u201cWhat.\u201dAlthough he might have just woken up, he spoke with the same usual tone of his voice.Startled, Shannette pointed to the knapsack.\u201cLook, look at that! That heart, that heart jumped out by itself!\u201dWith a messy hair, Kang Yoonsoo slowly got up.When he stood up, the slurping heart quickly hardened.The blood vessels on the heart changed into pointy needles, and flew towards Kang Yoonsoo.Tup-!Kang Yoonsoo caught the heart of the needles with one hand.And he immediately tore it up.Blood splashed all over the place and Shannette was covered with blood.[You\u2019ve destroyed Homunclus Lavian\u2019s Heart/Core, its life force.You\u2019ve discovered the clue left by the great alchemist Minerva.As you\u2019ve been given the secret writings of Necron, the last necromancer, you have been verified as a qualified executor.Do you want to carry out the legendary quest associated with the ancient hero?]\u201cYes.\u201d[The executor must plow through countless, deathly dangers in the process of executing the legendary quest. Your choice will determine the life of death of the future continent. Also, you cannot stop executing once it is started. The choice to this quest must be made after careful consideration. Do you really want to pursue?]\u201cSaid, I will.\u201dWithout even wiping off the blood, he fell back onto the bed.He immediately fell back asleep.After looking at Kang Yoonsoo who just fell asleep, Shannette played with her blood soaked hair.Shannette murmured disturbingly.\u201cWhat a disaster, at this early in the morning\u2026.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 28": "Chapter 28Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayShannette was in horror having learned that she had slept in the same bed with Kang Yoonsoo.\u2018Gosh, I slept with a man in the same bed\u2026 I mean I was exhausted\u2026. Gosh, I must have gone crazy.\u2019She felt like her face was burning as it turned red.After washing herself, she massaged her abdomen for no reason.\u2018Did I properly cover myself with the blanket when I went to bed? What if I had exposed my abdomen while sleeping\u2026 I don\u2019t even want to imagine it.\u2019It was in the afternoon when Kang Yoonsoo woke up.He said after finishing the late lunch which Shannette had brought him.\u201cLet\u2019s stop by the workshop before leaving Hiledan.\u201d\u201cWork shop? What do you want to buy?\u201d\u201cWant to make a weapon for you.\u201dShannette\u2019s eyes opened wide.\u201cA weapon for me?\u201dThe sharpness of her scythe has certainly gotten quite dull after the battle with Lavian.It was expected since the weapon has been in use since she was in Kellyine Territory, and she used it quite liberally, too.\u2018The Chimera Dimension is destroyed, and also obtained the legendary quest. Everything seems to be going well, so far. Want to make the weapon first then proceed with the legendary quest.\u2019Perhaps, it was because he wasn\u2019t fully awake that Kang Yoonsoo felt dizzy.Shannette looked a little bit concerned.Looking down on her abdomen, she gently rubbed it.\u201cMy abdomen, by any chance did you feel it?\u201dIt was then.Kang Yoonsoo\u2019s nonchalant eyes noticeably shivered.\u201cAh.\u201dIt was for a very brief moment.Slowly, his past life came to his mind.The surrounding area crumbled as the world changed.Shannette was mature than now, and even the inside space was transformed, so it looked more humble and comfortable.Even the clothes which they were wearing were changed.Unlike her former glamorous fa\u00e7ade, Shannette had a deep unsightly, burned mark.However, she was prettier than anyone.Kang Yoonsoo surveyed the surrounding area.It was still the time when he did not get sick of the world from exhaustion.Hugging her own bloated abdomen, Shannette smiled.\u2018What should we name our baby?\u2019He, in his past life, put on an earnest smile, and gently rubbed her abdomen.\u2018Our baby\u2019s name is\u2026\u2019Suddenly, Kang Yoonsoo wanted to vomit.No.Don\u2019t.Kang Yoonsoo repeated.Don\u2019t make me remember.I did love you, but.I did love the baby, but.Now, there is no one.It is because the present you could not be the same you of that time.\u2026..But then what was love.\u201cKang Yoonsoo?\u201dThe world has returned to normal.He found Shannette\u2019s eyes opened wide as he saw her looking at him.Shannette was truly surprised.For really a brief moment.It was truly for a very brief moment.An expression passed through Kang Yoonsoo\u2019s usual nonchalant face.But it was very short and blur.Shannette did not know what that expression really meant.\u201c\u2026..Kang Yoonsoo? Are you angry?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dKang Yoonsoo shook his head wildly.However, his thoughts remained in his heart for a long while.******After leaving the inn, they purchased some food and essential items from the street vendors.Then they went to the ironsmith workshop.The sound of the hammering was loud, and the heat from the workshop made their eyes sting.\u201cHow can I help you?\u201dAn old man with long white beard asked.Although he was an old man, he was the owner of the shop, and looked to have a strong physique.Kang Yoonsoo showed Lavian\u2019s long sword.\u201cI want to purchase a fitting housing for this sword.\u201dThe ironsmith raised his eyebrows as he looked down on the long, black sword.[Lavian\u2019s long sword]Level \u2013 RareAttack power: 52The sword which was personally created by Homunclus Lavian. Great power is exerted when Homunclus used it. The true power of the sword has become accessible after mid-level magic was absorbed.* Able to use absorption of life form skill.* Each time the opponent is killed with it, the attack power grows stronger by absorbing the life organisms.* Delivers injuries that weaken the opponent\u2019s fighting ability.* The sword\u2019s properties will change when an alchemist is killed.The performance of Lavian\u2019s long sword was excellent.Not only was the sword blade incredibly sharp, it was also lighter than the ordinary long swords as it was made out of special material, rather than steel.It was sharp and easy to use, and the sword\u2019s performance increased at every time the opponent was killed.It wasn\u2019t as good as the spirit sword which gets enhanced along with its owner, but many swordsmen would covet it, should it be put out on an auction market.\u201cIt\u2019s not an ordinary item. Wait here. I\u2019ll give you a fairly good one for you.\u201dThe old man brought out a black sword housing just like the color of the sword.The size of the housing was just perfect for the long sword.After paying the old man, Kang Yoonsoo placed the Lavian\u2019s long sword on his waist belt.\u201cI\u2019d like to use the workshop.\u201d\u201cIt will be 1 silver coin for every 3 hours. The price of the workshop usage in Hiledan is more expensive than other cities. However, since you\u2019ve shown me a rather good sword, I\u2019ll cut the price down to 80 bronze coins. You can use the space over there.\u201dAfter paying for the use of the workshop, Kang Yoonsoo entered the shop.There, in the workshop, some enforcers of the continent and ironsmith level explorers were either making or fixing various weapons.Shannette was surprised to see the scene of muscular women, busily hammering away, while wearing only a thin garment.Unexpectedly, there were more than a few women who worked as ironsmiths at the workshop.\u201cGive me the scythe.\u201dShannette quietly handed the cracked scythe.Taking the scythe, Kang Yoonsoo placed it inside a mold and melted it inside the melting pot.As the steel turned into liquid, Kang Yoonsoo took out a light green ingot from his knapsack.Immediately, every ironsmith\u2019s attention was drawn to him.\u201cHey, is that mithril?\u201d\u201cNo, dummy! What ironsmith would bring a mithril to a remote, country city like this. He probably colored it to make it look like one.\u201d\u201cBut, what sort of fame and fortune will someone seek by coloring an ingot?\u201dTwo middle aged people were talking to themselves as they looked over at Kang Yoonsoo.What Kang Yoonsoo took out from the knapsack was real mithril.It was the mithril metal which was smelted in Kellyine Region.Mithril was said to be a blessed metal.Even if only a short dagger was made out of it, not only would the destructive power be great, but the aesthetical effect would be amazing, as well.If an armor suit was to be made out of it, strong defensive ability and endurance will be obtained, and ordinary steel spears would not be able to penetrate it.Sometimes, by outpouring the divine power, it was used in making an armor suit or sword of a religious sect.Kang Yoonsoo placed one of the two mithril ingots he had into the mold, containing the melted scythe.When the mithril was added to the hardening steel, mysterious green light whirled around the area.Finally recognizing it to be the real thing, the ironsmiths screamed in excitement.\u201cMithril! That\u2019s real mithril!\u201d\u201cDoes he even know how to handle it properly? That\u2019s such a precious metal!\u201dThere were even some who stopped what they were doing and hurriedly gathered around Kang Yoonsoo.One female ironsmith approached Shannette and said.\u201cHey, miss. That young man, does he know how to use a mithril properly? Mithril is something that even a master cannot touch lightly. How about letting me make the weapon for you? Even with a single, small mistake, the effects of mithril will be lost. There is nothing more sickening, to an ironsmith, than seeing that happen.\u201d\u201cWell, I don\u2019t think that will happen?\u201dShannette replied smiling.Kang Yoonsoo poured the melted metal mixture into a mold.As the mixed metal took up a specific form, he grabbed the hammer.Each time Kang Yoonsoo hammered at the anvil, the ironsmiths all sighed out loud as they were all worried about him breaking the mithril by mistake.\u201cAre you not hammering it too hard? If they don\u2019t get evenly distributed, the weapon could get messed up.\u201d\u201cThup-thup. Look at him. The young one doesn\u2019t know the value of that precious material. He will regret it for trying to use it.\u201dEven with the concerns, coming from every direction, Kang Yoonsoo did not hesitate.The sound of the hammer reverberated at a fixed interval, and there was not a single mistake.Even the highly experienced ironsmiths were impressed by what they were seeing.\u201cThe young one does not even get nervous. He is doing better than expected?\u201d\u201cAnyone would get nervous when handling material like that\u2026. He\u2019s quite good.\u201dThe hot mixed metal began to harden and was turning into a good weapon.Kang Yoonsoo\u2019s skill was excellent, and the weapon was coming to its final form.Then suddenly, Kang Yoonsoo stopped hammering.The hardening mixed metal quickly cooled.All the ironsmiths were in horror as if it was their own business.\u201cHey, why are you stopping all of a sudden?\u201d\u201cHammer it a bit more! It\u2019s not done, yet!\u201dThere were even a few ironsmiths who approached with their own hammers, wanting to complete the job for him.Using his right hand which had on the life suppression ring, Kang Yoonsoo slightly rubbed the handle of the hammer.\u201cSoul freedom.\u201d[Krrrrrrraaaahk!]The soul of Lee Minchan which has been sealed inside the life suppression ring.Kang Yoonsoo has just freed that soul.The white, dim soul wildly flew around the air in painful shriek.Shannette and the ironsmiths were all shocked.\u201cWhat, what is that?\u201d\u201cThe fallen spirit.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dShannette looked incredulous.\u201cWhy are you releasing such a thing all of a sudden?\u201d\u201cTo use it as an ingredient.\u201dKang Yoonsoo raised the hammer.Then the spirit encapsulated the hammer.Kang Yoonsoo forcefully swung down the hammer with the soul encapsulating it.Kwaang-!The soul which had encapsulated the hammer smeared into the mixed metal.After submerging it into cold water, the weapon making was completed.It was a big scythe with the ambience of eerie green, blue color.[Death Scythe]Level \u2013 RareAttack power: 47A death spirit weapon with the fallen soul. It causes enormous pain to the opponent\u2019s spirit as well as the body. Mixed with small quantity of mithril, a masterful ironsmith has perfected the weapon.* Causes fatal injury to a spirit type monster.* The opponent\u2019s wounds do not heal well with ordinary treatment methods.* Randomly drops one of the seven curses to the fatally injured opponent.[You\u2019ve created an incredible object with your skill.Equipment creation, a new skill, is created.][Equipment creation]Skill level \u2013 Lv1 (00.00%)Makes either a weapon or a defensive equipment.[Death scythe, a deathly spirit weapon, has been created.A product of an excellent ironsmith.The equipment creation skill level is rising explosively.][Equipment creation skill level has gone up.The attack power will increase when weapon is created.][Equipment creation skill level has gone up.The created defensive equipment\u2019s durability will be substantial.][Equipment creation skill level has gone up.Hammering skill becomes more masterful. The created equipment\u2019s fit will be enhanced.][Equipment creation skill level has gone up.The chance of failure in the equipment creation process will be reduced.][Equipment creation skill level has gone up.A rather good product could be created even when low quality tools are to be used.][Equipment creation skill level has gone up.The durability of every created item will go up by one level.][Equipment creation skill level has gone up.With the increased understanding in the technique of ironsmiths, it becomes easier to destroy opponent\u2019s equipment.]As soon as he ascertained the equipment creation skill, Kang Yoonsoo earned 7 levels.It was the result which could only be achieved for an ordinary ironsmith to work at least 3~4 tireless months.The ironsmiths couldn\u2019t help, but be awed.\u201cWhat the heck is that, anyway?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve never seen anyone use a soul to make a weapon, until now!\u201dKang Yoonsoo handed the death scythe to Shannette.She took the weapon in confusion, and placed it on her waist belt.The big scythe\u2019s blade was sharper, and the weight was lighter than the earlier one.Shannette\u2019s cheeks turned red.Although it was a weapon for battles, she was appreciative of his efforts in making that weapon for her.She thought that it was fitting of Kang Yoonsoo for making her a weapon, rather than giving her a flower or a doll.Then suddenly, she couldn\u2019t help, but smile.Kang Yoonsoo looked at her as he thought it was strange.\u201cWhy are you smiling.\u201d\u201cOh, it\u2019s nothing.\u201dShannette smiled as if nothing bothered her.Kang Yoonsoo said.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cOK.\u201dThe ironsmiths did not even have the chance to ask for their names.The two left the workshop.Shannette smiled brightly.\u201cI think you\u2019re really great. You can even make a wonderful weapon like this, so easily, too.\u201dKang Yoonsoo suddenly turned his head in a leisurely way.He looked at Shannette who was following him from behind.He will travel with her even in his thousandth life.However, he couldn\u2019t always be with her.It was because she would always dissipate like the candle in the wind, in the end.That was because he couldn\u2019t protect her.A blurry expression passed over his eyes.Kang Yoonsoo repeated what he has always wanted.\u2018Pray that I can only protect you in this life time.\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It may take about 10 days by walking.\u201dShannette said as she pointed to a corner of the map.It was the city of Riyadh which was located in the north of Hiledan.Kang Yoonsoo recalled his memory.\u2018Have to find that puppeteer, first, when we get to Riyadh.\u2019The puppeteer with a high level of craftsmanship.He was a person who needed to accompany them in order to easily complete the legendary quest.However, there was one place which he had to stop by beforehand.Kang Yoonsoo spoke.\u201cThere is a place we have to stop by before going to Riyadh.\u201d\u201cIs it another ruin by any chance?\u201dShannette felt worried as she thought about the Ultica Ruins.Kang Yoonsoo shook his head again.\u201cA hunting ground.\u201d\u201cA hunting ground?

Mommy and daddy can make me one.\u201dSally\u2019s tear filled eyes glistened as she looked at Shannette.There was an anticipation that Shannette\u2019s heart would mellow out when she looked into the innocent eyes, but she sternly refused it by shaking her head.\u201cNo. That cannot happen, Sally.\u201d\u201cUhhhhhhh\u2026..\u201dCovering her face, Sally sniffled.Putting on the motherly smile on her face, Shannette embraced the girl.\u201cSally.

Waaaa!\u201dSally persisted as she cried.Shannette scratched her burned cheek.It wasn\u2019t that she did not understand Sally, but what wasn\u2019t allowed wasn\u2019t allowed.\u201cSorry Sally. Unfortunately, not everything you want is possible in the world.

You\u2019re the best daddy!\u201dSally ran over to Kang Yoonsoo, and kissed his cheek.Unlike Sally who looked dumbfounded, Kang Yoonsoo stood up.\u201cSally, there is something you have to do.\u201d*****Following behind Kang Yoonsoo, they arrived at a dreary swamp.Unknown plants filled the area, and bugs were crawling on the ground.Underneath a deep puddle of water, they saw a muddy swamp.\u201cSally.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe fire spirit brightened up the dark area.Sally changed into the lizard form.The salamander spewed out flames into the air.The power of the flame, which was coming out of her mouth, was incomparable to the power of the flames which used to be spewed out of her when she was a little girl.Shannette looked curious.\u201cWhat are you going to do with Sally\u2019s fire?\u201d\u201cHush.\u201dKang Yoonsoo spoke quietly.Soon, they heard quiet sound of another person.With the slushing sound of the mud, they heard something crawl out of the swamp.\u201cKaskuramb\u2026..\u201dThe sound of slushing cry.Covered with mud, one by one, there walked out some kind of life forms from the area.Mudjam.Mudjams were life forms that usually lived underneath the swamps, and they desired light.Seeing the bright light, the huge mudjams slowly walked towards it.It was when one of the mudjams extended out his slushing hand toward Sally.Pluck-!The mudjam\u2019s right arm severed as the mud fell to the ground.\u201cMakerlnooradi\u2026.!\u201dThe mudjam screamed out loud in pain.On the other hand, Kang Yoonsoo raised the blood soaked sword.It was the long sword of Lavian.It was the time to use the new sword which he had ascertained.As he yelled out grotesque cry, the mudjams indiscreetly began attacking by wildly swinging their arms.Lowering his posture, Kang Yoonsoo dashed forward.He wielded his right arm like a tornado while holding the sword.Pupupuuuuk-!Instantly, three mudjams fell to their knees with serious wounds.Kang Yoonsoo\u2019s sword wielding skill couldn\u2019t be easily dodged, either.Unlike the machete, which he used before, Lavian\u2019s sword was thin, so he could quickly slash through the opponents.Without sustaining any injuries, He easily cut through the mudjams.Each time the sword slashed mudjam\u2019s flesh, his attack power grew little bit stronger.Shannette, too, pointedly raised her death scythe.As she wielded her big, blue white scythe, the mudjam\u2019s heart burst without much resistance.Shannette was subtly surprised.The performance of her scythe was overwhelming compared to her older scythe.\u2018Truly great.\u2019It was a refreshing surprise.The swordsmanship, item creation, alchemy, and even undead resurrection ability.Was there anything Kang Yoonsoo could not do.She was even more curious as to who he really was.Shannette showed a worrisome face after she penetrated through the heart of a mudjam.\u201cIs Sally going to be OK?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll send her back to the summoning space if she encounters danger.\u201dThe mudjams that were approaching Sally were all killed by Kang Yoonsoo and Shannette.Trusting them, Sally kept spewing out flames.As the spirit fire became brighter, more mudjams gathered.As the hunt continued, the number of the mudjams quickly decreased.The last mudjam sprang out of the swamp.Unlike the other mudjams, it was a little bit bigger than the others, and a unique jewel was embedded in the center of its heart.\u201cKahimunoah-!\u201dMagic mudjam.Unlike the other ordinary mudjams, it was a special type that was able to wield magic.When he pounded the ground with his large hands, the mud, in the swamp, splashed up into the air.\u201cYeahaaaak-!\u201dIt was the mud controlling magic.The mud not only made it difficult to see, but it attached to the body, so that it became hard to move as well.As Shannette was covered with the mud, the mudjam immediately attacked her, so that he would not lose the chance.However, Kang Yoonsoo was already standing in front of her.As he swung his sword upwards, the mudjam\u2019s chin was slashed off.Slash-!The mudjam could not keep his consciousness with that single deadly strike.At that moment, Kang Yoonsoo swung down his sword.And swinging the sword to his left at the same time, he swung the sword horizontally.When his motion stopped, the mudjam was cut up in to unsightly pieces.Kang Yoonsoo grabbed the large, shining stone from the mudjam\u2019s dead body.[The jewel of the mudjam]Level-OrdinaryIt shines like a jewel, but there is not much value. It contains a small quantity of mana.Extending his right arm out, Kang Yoonsoo spoke.\u201cGroup resurrection.\u201dThe fallen mudjams rose up as they shed mud.The mud which turned yellowish green had foul odor.[Saved 76 rotten mudjams inside the summoning space.Presently, in the summoning space \u2013 76 rotten mudjams, White, the white beast.The possible storable number \u2013 623]Then Sally, who turned into a small girl, approached with twinkling eyes.\u201cDaddy, what about my little sibling?\u201d\u201cLater.\u201d\u201cUhhh. Daddy, then make a promise with Sally. Really, you\u2019re going to make me a little sibling?\u201dSally extended out her little finger.Kang Yoonsoo made a promise by twisting his little finger with hers.\u201cOK.\u201d\u201cThank you! I love you daddy, and mommy, too!\u201dKang Yoonsoo sent Sally back into the summoning space, too.As only the two remained, Shannette said in a quiet voice.\u201cSorry. I\u2019ve just become a baggage, this time around.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s alright.\u201dHowever, Shannette could not help, but feel frustrated.After all, she had been one of the five most revered warriors when she was a soldier under the territory leader Hermia.However, when she observed the way Kang Yoonsoo fought, she couldn\u2019t help, but feel inadequate.No matter what type of opponent they encountered, he was able to so easily defeat them.In no time, his level which was lower than hers was increasing to narrow the gap.\u2018But then why do I want to be helpful to that man?\u2019Shannette felt curious.Then she suddenly thought about the sculpture of power.As there has been tremendous growth until now, some changes must have taken place, for sure.Moving her hand above her head, she examined her condition.[Shannette Elogran]148 hours to opening the first level of the sculpture of power.The waiting time has been reduced as the growth occurred.Not much time remained before the sculpture of power could be opened.Kang Yoonsoo who was watching her without saying anything spoke.\u201cHave to develop you faster.\u201dFor some reason, Shannette felt like she has become one of his pets.It was then.A quiet voice was heard in Kang Yoonsoo\u2019s ear.-A change is coming in short order. You have to be ready for that.Kang Yoonsoo looked at Shannette.\u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d\u201cWhat? I didn\u2019t say anything.\u201dHe looked around with sharpened curiosity.However, there was no one else around, other than Shannette and himself.All he could hear was the meaningless sound of the blowing wind.\u2018Did I really get so bad to even hear voices.\u2019As he knew that he wasn\u2019t completely sane, it wasn\u2019t that surprising to him.He often encountered hallucinations from his previous lives.Kang Yoonsoo felt anxious and curious, but he didn\u2019t worry too much over it.At least, until now.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Riel was not a city of trade or commerce, but it was a city famous for heavily investing in exploration and excavation.The pair passed through the checkpoint and entered the city. Kang Yoon-Soo touched the wrist device and checked the legendary quest they were currently doing. Shaneth, who was a Continental, could see the information window from the wrist device, and she was reading the contents of the quest too.Shaneth was actually filled with excitement and expectation. They had a quest.Multiple kinds of quests were available all over the continent. These quests could range from petty requests such as delivery work to more prestigious and rewarding quests such as monster subjugation. The quests were only given by Continentals, as the Travelers from another world had not been bestowed the right to give out quests.Additionally, one could receive a predetermined reward upon successful completion of a quest. A Continental who had not decided what to give as a reward could not give out quests to others. A quest was an absolute promise between people.A quest usually involved looking for specific items, but there were also rare kinds of quests that asked one to find the traces of a ruin or a hidden treasure chest. The quest Kang Yoon-Soo was doing was related to a legend\u2014in other words, a legendary quest.Not much was known about legendary quests. However, most such quests carried extreme risks and hazards, and the time period for carrying out such quests could be very long. Of course, one would be handsomely rewarded by such quests.Numerous adventurers were scouring the continent trying to find rewarding rare quests, and the fact that one was doing a legendary quest was itself a reason to be proud of.Shaneth was already shaking with excitement just from the thought of having one. She remembered Kang Yoon-Soo saying that the purpose of their journey was to prevent a disaster that would fall upon the world in the near future, and she instinctively knew that the legendary quest was related to that goal.What could be the start of such an amazing quest? Would it be hunting an extremely difficult monster? Perhaps a territorial war? Shaneth was confident in doing her best to successfully complete the quest.[Legendary Quest: Missing History]Look for clues regarding the missing portion of history from Henrick the drunk, who sleeps in the dumpster behind Riel\u2019s military training center.*Henrick is usually active in the afternoon.\u201c\u2026\u201d Shaneth could not hide her disappointment.\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.\u201cOkay\u2026\u201d Shaneth replied.Kang Yoon-Soo easily found his way around the city as if he had been there before. Numerous sweaty, muscular men were training their swordsmanship at the military training center, and the smithy across from it contained numerous female blacksmiths just like the one at Hiledan.He went past the military training center and headed toward the back alley.\u201cZzzzz\u2026 Zz\u2026 Zzz\u2026 Zz\u2026\u201dA middle-aged man was snoring heavily in a pile of trash, fast asleep. His coat was ragged, and his beard showed signs of not being shaved for weeks at the least. He was quite tall and well built, but he reeked of the smell of alcohol as if he had not taken a bath for days. His coat pocket bulged with some unknown item.Shaneth looked disgruntled and disappointed\u2014this was just a homeless person! Could the legendary quest really start with this guy? She asked, \u201cThere must be something wrong with the quest window, right?\u201d\u201cNot at all,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said. He added quietly, \u201cWe need him for the legendary quest.\u201d He grabbed Henrick\u2019s shoulder and shook him awake.Henrick grimaced as he slowly opened his saliva-covered mouth. He asked, \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d\u201cI came to get information on the missing portion of history,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.\u201cHuh? From me? What are you talking about? Go ask somewhere else.\u201d Henrick scratched his neck a few times before getting up from the pile of trash, then turned around and started walking.Kang Yoon-Soo took out a silver coin from his pocket as Henrick was about to leave, and flicked the coin toward him. Henrick instantly turned around and caught the coin, remarking, \u201cYou guys must be pretty bored, huh? I\u2019m already telling you, I don\u2019t know much about anything. The only things I know are things I\u2019ve heard from people as I hopped from one pub to another. If you\u2019re so intent on listening to that at least, I need you to bring something for me.\u201dA new quest popped up.[I Need Booze Money!]Henrick is interested in the treasure of the mudgems that live in the swamp south of Riel. The shiny stone would fetch a hefty sum for him, although he would spend it all on booze.*The quest will be gone after four days.Rewards: Some information, Henrick\u2019s empty praise.\u201cHere you go.\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo passed the Mudgem\u2019s Treasure to Henrick. He had passed through the home of the mudgems for that very reason.Henrick was confused for a moment before his eyes sparkled. \u201cOooh! Thanks! I never imagined you would give it to me this quickly. You\u2019re amazing!\u201d He quickly hid the Mudgem\u2019s Treasure in his ragged coat, and he cleared his throat a few times before saying, \u201cThe information you\u2019re looking for is probably with Ramax from the Red Rock Excavators.\u201d\u201cWhat? Didn\u2019t you say you would give us the information if we brought you the treasure of the mudgem?\u201d Shaneth protested.\u201cI told you I heard a few things from the pubs, right? I heard Ramax, that old man, talk about it once when he was drunk. Don\u2019t you think it would be better to hear it directly than from someone who just overheard it?\u201d Henrick skillfully made excuses. He added, \u201cCome to think of it, that old man\u2019s organization seems to have found a few strange things while excavating. Anyway, I told you I didn\u2019t know much from the start. Wish you all the best!\u201d He began to stagger away.\u201cArtisanship isn\u2019t art,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said as Henrick was about to leave.Henrick stopped in his tracks. He turned around and asked, \u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d\u201cArtisanship isn\u2019t art,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo repeated.\u201cWhy do you think so?\u201d Henrick asked.\u201cBecause it\u2019s useless. There\u2019s no money in it, and it\u2019s a pitiful profession. The word \u2018art\u2019 is wasted on something like that,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.\u201cWhat did you say?!\u201d Henrick shouted as he approached Kang Yoon-Soo.Shaneth was perplexed by the scene. She had never seen Kang Yoon-Soo provoke someone so openly. However, she decided to observe the situation a bit more.Henrick glared at Kang Yoon-Soo before asking threateningly, \u201cAre you telling me artisanship is a lowly profession?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.\u201cAre you certain?\u201d Henrick asked.\u201cYes,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo repeated.\u201cYou punk, are you trying to kill me by making me laugh myself to death?\u201d Henrick scoffed as he took out a sculpting knife from underneath his sleeve.Shaneth grabbed the handle of her scythe as she stared at him. However, it was just a normal sculpting knife. The sculpting knife looked quite old, but the sunlight easily reflected off its sharp edges.Henrick took out the Mudgem\u2019s Treasure from his coat pocket and spun his sculpting knife before starting to work on it. The simple, shiny stone suddenly became a jewel that boasted extreme brilliance.\u201cThat\u2019s amazing!\u201d Shaneth exclaimed.Even skilled sculptors could not hold a candle to Henrick\u2019s craftsmanship. Henrick tossed the jewel up and down as he confidently smirked. \u201cWhat do you think? Do you still think artisanship is a lowly profession?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a mess,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said coldly.\u201cWhat did you say, you punk?\u201d Henrick glared at him as if he were about to stab him with the sculpting knife.\u201cThe material was too lacking to match your skills. You\u2019re at too high a level to sculpt such lowly material as a Mudgem\u2019s Treasure, Henrick Elrickersson,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.The anger in Henrick\u2019s eyes disappeared. He asked, \u201cYou\u2026 You know who I am?\u201d\u201cYou were the artisan for the royal princess despite being a commoner\u2014although you\u2019re retired now,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.\u201cAre you serious?\u201d Shaneth asked in surprise as her eyes grew large and round.One had to possess an overwhelming amount of skill and talent to be able to enter the royal palace as a lowly commoner. Not to mention, if he had been the artisan for the royal princess, he would have to be the best of the best; that meant he must have reached the pinnacle of the Artisan class. A skilled artisan like him was rolling around and sleeping in a pile of trash, wasting away as a drunk?Henrick let out a bitter laugh as he said, \u201cWell, my specialty was puppet-making, but I worked as an artisan too.\u201dShaneth was even more shocked. The fact that he had worked at the royal palace was surprising by itself, but he was even a skilled puppet maker? Although Henrick was a normal middle-aged man, his skills were not something to look down on.Henrick continued with a sigh, \u201cHowever, my hands are stiff now. I used to be called the best on the continent, but that\u2019s all in the past\u2026 It\u2019s already been fifteen years since I stopped, and there are many others who are better than me.\u201dThe moment Shaneth listened to the man\u2019s rant, she realized Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s intentions. \u2018So that\u2019s it!\u2019Come to think of it, it was a very familiar scene. The skills of a retired royal artisan were definitely going to be needed to complete the legendary quest. That was why Kang Yoon-Soo had provoked Henrick by saying stuff like \u2018artisanship isn\u2019t art\u2019 or that his work was a mess. It was to provoke him into picking up crafting again.\u2018Amazing. He really is an amazing guy.\u2019 Shaneth was certain that this was the moment Kang Yoon-Soo had prepared in his mind. He was going to encourage the depressed Henrick to pick up crafting again.However, Kang Yoon-Soo said, \u201cYou\u2019re right; your skills have declined. There are better artisans than you.\u201d\u2018What\u2026?\u2019 Shaneth was perplexed and confused. Now was the time to comfort and encourage him, and convince the retired artisan to pick up his craft again!Henrick stared at Kang Yoon-Soo and asked, \u201cWhat are you trying to say?\u201dKang Yoon-Soo slowly answered, \u201cThe heirloom of the Elrickersson family that you keep in the capital. The one that can only be passed on to the most skilled artisan. Give that heirloom to me.\u201d\u201cWhy should I?\u201d Henrick protested.In response, Kang Yoon-Soo simply declared, \u201cBecause I\u2019m a better artisan than you.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 31": "Chapter 31Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayHenrick let out a chuckle and asked, \u201cYou think you\u2019re better than me?\u201dKang Yoon-Soo nodded and said, \u201cThat is, if you don\u2019t use your left hand, and use your right hand as you did just now.\u201dHenrick suddenly glared at Kang Yoon-Soo with sharp eyes. However, he composed himself after a moment. He had a perplexed expression, but then he rubbed his rough chin, seemingly deep in thought. Finally, he said, \u201cIndeed, our family heirloom belongs only to the best artisan, and it\u2019s tradition to pass it on to someone better. However, how do you plan to prove your skills? You look young no matter how I look at you.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll sculpt an Ancient Stone,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.Henrick\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cAncient Stones are top-grade materials that aren\u2019t only difficult to find, but difficult for even the best artisans to deal with. And yet you\u2019re telling me you\u2019ll sculpt that?\u201dKang Yoon-Soo said, \u201cI\u2019ll get the material if you give me some time, and I\u2019ll sculpt it in front of you.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t make me laugh.\u201d Henrick glared at Kang Yoon-Soo with eyes filled with animosity, but he soon sighed in resignation. \u201cAlright, damn it. You did bring me the mudgem\u2019s treasure, and you gave me a silver coin as well, so I might as well give you a chance. However, I\u2019ll treat you as just another arrogant greenhorn the moment I feel that your skills aren\u2019t up to par.\u201d[The Best Artisan]The real identity of Henrick the drunk was the personal artisan of the royal princess. He inherited the blood of the Elrickersson family, and the Elrickersson family, famous for its craftsmanship, produced a master artisan. Sculpt an Ancient Stone before Henrick\u2019s eyes.*Henrick has very high standards. It will not be easy to satisfy him.*The quest will be a failure if not completed within fourteen days.*You will lose Henrick\u2019s trust if you fail the quest.Reward: Heirloom of the Elrickersson familyA hidden quest appeared. It was a quest that would never have appeared if they had only thought of Henrick as a useless drunk.Kang Yoon-Soo nodded slightly and walked away.\u201cThank you,\u201d Shaneth told Henrick as she ran after Kang Yoon-Soo.Henrick was left there scratching his cheek as he stared at Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s back with a strange expression. His observant gaze led him to raise a question about the young man. \u201cThat guy\u2026 Is he really a youngster?\u201dIt was strange. Kang Yoon-Soo looked young on the outside, but he gave off the feeling of being older than the elves who lived for hundreds of years.Henrick scratched his cheeks as he tried to remember. He could swear that he had seen those eyes somewhere, and it was not a pleasant memory. He closed his left hand into a fist and gripped it hard, but for some reason, the way he moved his hand seemed unnatural.\u2018I hope he didn\u2019t notice the secret behind my left hand\u2026\u2019 he thought, before shaking his head and muttering, \u201cSo what if he did? There\u2019s no way he can bring an Ancient Stone anyway.\u201dAncient Stones were extremely rare and precious minerals that even dwarves found difficult to mine. Ancient Stones had nine properties; each property was mysterious on its own, and immense powers were hidden in them.It was impossible for a greenhorn artisan to be able to carve a perfect jewel out of one no matter how many days and nights they spent working on it, and yet that youngster was confident that he could craft that difficult mineral himself? It was impossible.Henrick the drunk staggered sideways as he left the back alleys, heading toward the pub to grab a drink.***The Red Rock Excavators were located in the rocky terrain north of Riel. Tens of tents were set up in the large and wide wilderness as hundreds of archeologists, adventurers, and explorers scoured the area with brushes and pickaxes looking for clues. Although it was much more usual for their efforts to betray them and reward them with nothing, there were a few of them who managed to get lucky and found rusted swords or mysterious ornamental headgear.\u2018This brings me back to the time I took the Excavator class.\u2019 Kang Yoon-Soo had set up the largest excavation association in a previous life and searched every single excavation site on the continent, leaving no stone unturned. The scale of his work had not ended at simply looking for historical artifacts; he had gone a step further to excavate the geological strata of the land looking for buried ruins.\u2018There were no artifacts I didn\u2019t manage to find back then. The armor of the Old God was the best find, since it managed to block the Dragon of Destruction\u2019s breath attack and even Sirian\u2019s magic spear.\u2019 Of course, that was all in the past. Kang Yoon-Soo shook his head before he got lost in nostalgia..The two passed all the regular tents and went straight to the tents of the largest excavation association. The tents were filled with scholars going over stacks of old records, and an old man seated at the largest desk was intently observing an Ancient Stone with a magnifying glass.The old man wore slightly tilted silver eyeglasses, and his gray hair showed the years he had lived. He kept looking into the magnifying glass as he asked, \u201cWho are you? What do you want?\u201d\u201cWe wish to apply for excavation work,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.\u201cAh, what are your names?\u201d the old man asked.\u201cKang Yoon-Soo.\u201d\u201cShaneth.\u201dThe old man adjusted his silver glasses and said, \u201cMy name is Ramax. I\u2019m the leader of the Red Rock Excavators, and also an archeologist. People say I moonlight as a historian too. Anyway, the joining fee is ten silver coins.\u201dKang Yoon-Soo paid the fee.[You have become a temporary member of the Red Rock Excavators.][Current Contributions: 0]Ramax stood up with his hands behind his back, saying, \u201cThe fact that there are more youngsters showing interest and joining the excavation gladdens me, but why is it that instead of searching for things with historical value, they seem to be here to hunt for treasures? It isn\u2019t a good thing\u2026\u201d\u201cTreasure hunting?\u201d Shaneth asked.Ramax nodded and continued, \u201cThe association will provide you with contribution points of equal value to the artifacts you excavate and bring. The contribution points you earn can be exchanged for rare items or useful tools. It seems the youngsters these days are only after the contribution points.\u201dHe looked toward the Travelers that were digging outside, as if he could not stand the sight of them. He continued, \u201cExcavation isn\u2019t treasure hunting. It\u2019s working to unravel the mysteries of the past and preserve history. I hope you two will understand this point.\u201dHe then pointed toward a spot in the distance; in that spot was a large rock, surrounded by red dust. He said, \u201cYou may purchase any tools you require for excavation here, whether it\u2019s a pickaxe, shovel, or magnifying glass. That rock is our current excavation spot. Be careful, as aggressive monsters show up from time to time to rampage; a few of our members were injured because of that.\u201dHe continued, \u201cIf you\u2019re afraid of monsters, then you can aim for low-value artifacts here in the outskirts. Of course, you\u2019ll most likely end up turning in stones and get nothing in return.\u201dKang Yoon-Soo suddenly spoke up, saying, \u201cI wish to know more about the missing portion of history.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Ramax\u2019s expression suddenly turned serious as he said, \u201cYou must have heard that from the drunken fool Henrick. Damn it\u2026\u201d\u201cYes, I did,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.\u201cThat loudmouth\u2026 Why is he making me itch to expose his secrets as well\u2026\u201d the old man muttered. He looked up and down at the pair before giving them a stern warning. \u201cNormally, I would\u2019ve instantly chased you away, but I\u2019ll look over it once, since you joined our association after all. Don\u2019t ask about it and just go back.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll bring the \u2018Tablet of Records\u2019,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.\u201cWhat?\u201d Ramax exclaimed.\u201cTablet of Records. You need that to chase the trail of the missing history, right?\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo asked.Ramax glared at him for a minute before shaking his head, saying, \u201cThe Tablet of Records is something that even I failed to find, but you\u2019re telling me you\u2019ll bring it? That\u2019s impossible.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll bring it,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo repeated.Ramax could only sigh in resignation as he saw Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s confidence. He said, \u201cI\u2019ll give you a quest then. However, if you fail to bring it, don\u2019t expect me to have anything to say to you anymore.\u201d[Legendary Quest\u2014Missing History]The Tablet of Records is required to look for the missing portion of history. Find the Tablet of Records and bring it to Ramax.*You will not be able to participate in the activities of the Red Rock Excavators if you fail.Kang Yoon-Soo went to an association staff member to purchase tools for excavation. He bought a pickaxe, a shovel, a magnifying glass, and a brush and placed them in his backpack.Shaneth asked with a confused expression, \u201cDo you plan to use all of that?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.The two walked toward the large rock, finding a small opening beneath it. A long corridor stretched out past the opening, forming a passage that led underground.\u2018This place was always quite wide, no matter how many times I came here,\u2019 Kang Yoon-Soo thought.The excavation site was very wide, and the interior network of passages was quite complex like a maze. That was why there were still a lot of artifacts and treasures left undiscovered, and there were still monster lairs that had not been subjugated.\u2018I have to excavate everything of value before that monster appears.\u2019It was around the time that the boss of the Red Rock excavation site, that held immense power, had awakened from its slumber.The sound of wings fluttering filled the air at the end of the tunnel, where several large creatures were hanging upside down from the ceiling. They were large beast-type monsters, the Big Bats\u2014bat monsters that had long fangs and large bodies with black wings.The moment Kang Yoon-Soo and Shaneth readied their weapons, the bats on the ceiling charged toward them in midair. They had lower defense than normal monsters, but their agility and attack speed were not to be underestimated.Kang Yoon-Soo cut down all of the charging bats approaching him with Ravian\u2019s Longsword. Shaneth, although not as good as he was, could hold her ground; she too managed to cut down the bats approaching her with one big swing of her Death Scythe.The two easily managed to take care of the Big Bats, and Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s level rose after the hunt. He was now Level 74.\u201cMass Raise Dead.\u201d Numerous bat corpses started to squirm as Kang Yoon-Soo spoke, and the gray undead slowly rose from the ground as their fur changed to red.[The level of \u2018Mass Raise Dead\u2019 has risen.][Certain undead raised will gain a special attribute.][The Big Bats have gained the lifesteal attribute.]The Big Bats rose from the ground as Blood Bats. Blood Bats were undead that were aggressive and had a strong lust for blood.\u201cKwiiik! Kwiiik!\u201dThe Blood Bats thirsted for blood\u2014it was their instinct as undead.Undead with a certain amount of intellect would prioritize their instincts more than the commands of their master. There were certain cases of unskilled necromancers being killed by their own undead because of their lack of talent and control. The most important stat for any necromancer was leadership. A necromancer who dreamed of commanding a whole army needed to have a high amount of leadership.Kang Yoon-Soo raised his hand as he sent the Blood Bats to the summon dimension.[317 Blood Bats have been sent to the summon dimension.][Summons currently stored in the dimension: 316 Blood Bats, 76 Rotten Mudgems, White, and Sally.][Remaining space for additional summons: 306]The Blood Bats let out shrieks as they obeyed their master.\u201cBeing a necromancer sure is tough\u2026\u201d Shaneth said.The pair entered the excavation site. Numerous forks in the road appeared, but Kang Yoon-Soo never stopped once\u2014as if he already knew the way.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Multiple old and rusted artifacts started to appear one by one as they dug.[Old Bone]Value: 3The bone of an ancient creature. Its age makes it difficult to tell what creature it comes from.[Rusty Sword]Value: 14It is a sword that was used a long time ago. The edges have dulled, so restoring it will be difficult.[Belt of a Noble Child]Value: 42A belt that looks to have been worn by a noble child. It is well preserved.Most of the artifacts could not be used if they were not preserved properly, but the higher their value rating was, the more contribution points one could receive. There were some excavators who had come across highly valuable artifacts and become rich overnight, but those were extremely rare cases.Kang Yoon-Soo stuffed the artifacts that were in good condition into his bag.As Shaneth was diligently shoveling dirt, she felt something at the tip of the shovel. As she dug further, she found something that looked like an amulet.[Moonlight Amulet]Value: 177An amulet that has not lost its luster through the ages. It is an artifact that holds value both historically and artistically.\u201cLook! Look at this!\u201d Shaneth shouted in surprise, but she froze on the spot when Kang Yoon-Soo turned around. He was in the process of pulling out a large artifact from the wall.[Golden Horn Goblet]Value: 557A goblet that was used by a Viking leader in the past. It is so well preserved that it could be used right now. It holds tremendous archeological value.Kang Yoon-Soo tied the goblet to his waist while Shaneth was looking at him with a stupefied expression. The backpack had been filled to the brim, and there was no more space for more artifacts.The pair left the excavation site and went to the main tent that served as the headquarters of the Red Rock Excavators. The gazes of those in the area were fixed on the two who had brought back a backpack full of artifacts.\u201cWhat the? The two of them dug all that up?\u201d\u201cThe artifacts look quite valuable too.\u201d\u201cIt seems they excavated all night without resting.\u201dIt was actually not easy to find anything of value even if one stayed up digging all night, and all they usually got after working all night were several rusted spears or torn leather boots. Excavating artifacts was a very laborious and difficult job without the help of any high-level detection skills.The people around the pair looked at them with envy-filled gazes.\u201cWe came to submit the artifacts we\u2019ve excavated,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo told the attendant. He passed on all of the artifacts they had excavated, including the Golden Horn Goblet and the Moonlight Amulet.Ramax\u2019s eyes were wide, as if he could not believe what he was seeing. \u201cAre you telling me you excavated all these artifacts in less than a day?\u201d he asked in disbelief.\u201cYes,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied dryly.Ramax sat in disbelief, but then he took out a magnifying glass to inspect the artifacts. \u201cHmm\u2026 These are quite well preserved\u2026 and they hold historical significance too. You could gain a handsome sum of contribution points with these.\u201d[You have submitted valuable artifacts to the Red Rock Excavators.][Your contribution points have increased by 1,328.][Current Contribution Points: 1,328]\u201cYou can exchange your contribution points for items or money over there,\u201d Ramax explained. The way he looked at Kang Yoon-Soo and Shaneth had changed. He looked at the two with a gentle gaze, and his tone was soft-spoken.He gazed at the two before he suddenly proposed something. \u201cAre you two by any chance interested in becoming official members of the Red Rock Excavators? I think it would be a waste to leave you two as temporary members. If you become official members of our association, we\u2019ll reward you even more for the artifacts you bring.\u201d[Ramax of the Red Rock Excavators has made a proposal.][The contribution points you gain will increase if you become an official member. However, you will have to remain with the association at all times.][Do you want to advance to the class of Excavator?]Once, in a past life, Kang Yoon-Soo had become an Excavator. He had not just been an ordinary Excavator; rather, he had established the largest excavator association on the continent and led it as its leader. However, he had no plans to become an Excavator in his 1,000th life.\u201cI refuse,\u201d he said.\u201cIt\u2019s a nice offer, but I have no plans to be an excavator either,\u201d Shaneth said politely.Ramax looked a little disappointed and replied, \u201cOh, that\u2019s a shame\u2026 Let me know just in case you guys change your mind.\u201dA cabinet that seemed to be made out of steel came into view. Kang Yoon-Soo pressed the middle button on the cabinet, and a list of items that could be exchanged for contribution points suddenly popped up in front of him.[Which item do you wish to exchange for using your contribution points?][Staff of Lightning: 100,000 CP][Magic-Amplifying Bracelet: 50,000 CP][Expert\u2019s Pickaxe: 45,000][Precise Appraisal Magnifying Glass: 40,000 CP]It was a list of rare items that could not be purchased at a normal shop, especially the \u2018Staff of Lightning\u2019 that cost an astounding 100,000 contribution points.\u2018The \u2018Staff of Lightning\u2019 is a very good item at the moment,\u2019 Kang Yoon-Soo thought.A magic staff not only increased the magic power of the user, but also greatly increased the power of any spells cast. It was actually very difficult to find decent magic equipment on the continent, and that was why even normal-rated equipment related to magic fetched a hefty price.However, 100,000 contribution points was a huge amount that would still not be enough even if one combined the contribution points of numerous excavators. There were numerous excavators who had been digging for years, but no one had managed to get the \u2018Staff of Lightning\u2019.Kang Yoon-Soo scrolled down to the bottom of the list.[Phoenix Feather Candle: 1,800 CP][Dimension Bag: 1,200 CP][Alloyed Shovel: 700 CP]Kang Yoon-Soo used his contribution points to exchange for a \u2018Dimension Bag\u2019. The backpack was too small to fit all of the artifacts, but the \u2018Dimension Bag\u2019 had almost an endless amount of space and could store a lot of items in it.Kang Yoon-Soo stored the tools he had bought in the dimension bag and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cOkay,\u201d Shaneth answered.The pair went back to the excavation site and diligently started to excavate more artifacts. Their speed and efficiency in digging artifacts was somewhat slow compared to other people that had the Excavator class, because of the class\u2019 unique skill that allowed them to easily locate artifacts. However, they were still able to find valuable artifact after artifact with relative ease.[Brooch of a Child Prodigy]Value: 155A brooch used by a prodigy from a noble family. There are traces of dried blood on it.[Pearl Belt]Value: 279A belt adorned with large pearls. The pearls are in excellent condition, and you might be able to remove the pearls and sell them separately.[Mysterious Pumpkin]Value: 417A multi-colored pumpkin. A mysterious creature is preserved in it. A skilled scholar would be able to identify the pumpkin and the creature inside.[Exquisitely Adorned Sword]Value: 247A sword used by an ancient noble. It is used as a ceremonial sword, rather than for actual combat. A skilled blacksmith would be able to repair it.Their results were because they were digging only in places Kang Yoon-Soo indicated. Shaneth forgot about her fatigue and kept digging happily as the dimension bag started to fill up as well.\u2018I want to dig more, but these are the only artifacts left in good condition. The rest would require repairs or repair magic to be of any value. I should stop being greedy,\u2019 Kang Yoon-Soo thought to himself.Just when they started walking toward the surface\u2026\u201cKirigryaaaaah\u2026!\u201dA loud vibration reverberated from the lowest floor of the cave, and a deafening sound akin to a monster\u2019s roar filled the air. At that moment, the situation felt ominous.Shaneth looked back upon hearing the ominous sound, but she did not dare to stop moving as she followed behind Kang Yoon-Soo.Ramax exclaimed once again as they submitted the artifacts they had excavated, \u201cYou did it again! Do you guys really have no plan to join our association? It\u2019d be a shame to lose such skilled people.\u201dThey rejected Ramax\u2019s offer this time as well, and the old man looked quite disappointed by their refusal.[You have submitted valuable artifacts to the Red Rock Excavators.][Your contribution points have increased by 1,917.][Current Contribution Points: 1,917]Kang Yoon-Soo purchased another dimension bag, and he gave it to Shaneth.Right at the moment they were about to head to the excavation site again, a loud scream emerged from the excavation site. \u201cAaaahk!\u201dPeople were scrambling out of the entrance to the excavation site with pale, horror-stricken faces. There were some who were covered in blood, and some had grave injuries as they huffed and puffed on the way out of the excavation site.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?!\u201d\u201cWhat happened?!\u201dThe people in the area started to gather one by one. It seemed something big had happened in the excavation site.A disheveled and haggard-looking woman who had been crying screamed at the top of her lungs, \u201cDon\u2019t come in here! No one should come to this excavation site from now on!\u201dThe onlookers started to look at each other with puzzled expressions. One man in the crowd asked, \u201cWhy?\u201dThe woman explained, \u201cA boss monster appeared from the basement of the excavation site. It was a large flying monster, and it started attacking people left and right. That\u2019s why the people at the bottom of the excavation site who was excavating for artifacts got trapped\u2026 sniff!\u201dThe people looked at each other with puzzled expressions.A boss monster? At the excavation site?The horror-stricken faces of the survivors told the others that they did not seem to have been lying, and the bloodstains and severe injuries they had sustained gave credibility to the story. A few people started to shout out orders to the others.\u201cCall the leader!\u201d\u201cIs there anyone who has healing skills? There are injured people here!\u201dA man hurriedly approached the survivor and asked, \u201cWhat happened to the people who were excavating inside? Are they all dead?\u201d\u201cNobody has died yet, but the boss is circling around the excavation site. No one should enter; otherwise, they\u2019ll undoubtedly die!\u201d the survivor cried out fearfully.The members of the association, including Ramax, ran out of their tents. Ramax had a serious expression as he pondered the situation after hearing the woman\u2019s story. Eventually, he decided, \u201cCease all operations at the excavation site right now! The excavation site is off limits from now on! All outsiders, including the temporary members, are requested to leave this place at once.\u201dRamax then looked toward the members of the Red Rock Excavators and said, \u201cWe\u2019ll now organize a search party. A boss monster is rampaging in the excavation site, but there are still survivors trapped inside. The fault of not properly investigating the excavation site lies heavily with us, and we won\u2019t be able to receive any support from the city if any victims die at the site. We have to rescue the survivors at all costs.\u201dSuddenly, a member awkwardly raised an opinion. \u201cBut boss, as you said, we haven\u2019t investigated that excavation site and we don\u2019t know the interior that well. How do you propose we find and rescue the people trapped inside? In the worst case scenario, we might also be trapped inside\u2026\u201d\u201cHmmm\u2026\u201d Ramax had encountered a dilemma. It was a cold and heartless opinion, but it made perfect sense. Rushing into the excavation site while a boss monster was rampaging in it could actually put more people in danger.He sighed as he said regretfully, \u201cIf only there were someone who knew the interior of that excavation site well enough\u2026\u201d\u201cI know it,\u201d someone suddenly said.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 33": "Chapter 33Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAll eyes were on one man. It was Kang Yoon-Soo.\u201cI know the interior of the excavation site,\u201d he reiterated.\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Ramax asked.\u201cI\u2019ll guide you.\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo brazenly proposed something unbelievable. \u201cBut, reward me with contribution points for every person we rescue,\u201d he added.The association members openly expressed their disgust for his brazen proposal.\u201cAre you kidding us?! You want to strike a deal with people\u2019s lives?!\u201d\u201cHow can we believe that you know the way around the excavation site?\u201dHowever, Ramax shook his head and interceded on behalf of Kang Yoon-Soo. \u201cHold on. We can believe this youngster. I\u2019ll personally guarantee it.\u201dIt was all because the valuable artifacts Kang Yoon-Soo had brought back had earned him Ramax\u2019s trust, and his proposal had thus piqued Ramax\u2019s interest.Ramax asked, \u201cYou know the interior of the excavation site very well?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo answered.\u201cWe have no choice but to go with you then, if what you\u2019re claiming is true. How many contribution points do you want per person rescued?\u201d Ramax asked.\u201c1,000,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.One would need to submit at least three or four well-preserved artifacts to earn 1,000 contribution points, but he wanted 1,000 contribution points per person rescued? It was not that the people\u2019s lives were worthless, but his proposal was a very brazen one.Ramax could not help but frown at Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s words no matter how much trust he had built up. He said, \u201cThat\u2019s too much. I can\u2019t accept that proposal.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll receive the contribution points only after hunting down the boss,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo added.Ramax and the association members were stunned by his words. Ramax asked, \u201cWhat? Do you mean you\u2019ll kill the boss that showed up at the excavation site?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo nodded. There was no way he would pass up the opportunity to hunt the highly rewarding monsters right before his eyes. \u201cI won\u2019t receive the contribution points if I fail to kill the boss monster in the excavation site,\u201d he continued.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d Ramax was left with a dilemma.A boss monster appearing in the excavation site was definitely something they had not predicted. Leaving the situation as it was would not only delay the excavation schedule, but also cut off all the funding they were receiving.Ramax pondered the matter for a while, then finally said, \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll accept your offer.\u201dKang Yoon-Soo, Shaneth, and the members of the Red Rock Excavators all went to the excavation site underneath the large rock. The basement of the excavation site was as large and wide as it had always been, and the eerie silence gave even more suspense to the situation.Kang Yoon-Soo stood at the forefront, and Shaneth, as well as the other members, followed right behind him. However, some of the association members hesitated to follow him.\u201cYou can trust him. You would be more at ease if you did,\u201d Shaneth said to alleviate their unease as she hurriedly caught up behind Kang Yoon-Soo. The members of the Red Rock Excavators deliberated for a while before following suit.Kang Yoon-Soo easily navigated around the maze-like place; rather, it would be more suitable to say that it seemed as if he knew exactly where he was going. Even the most competent pathfinder would be unable to walk through such a labyrinthine area so quickly.They were almost at the far end of the excavation site when they suddenly heard voices.\u201cAh! Look! It\u2019s a person!\u201d\u201cThank goodness! We\u2019re saved!\u201dIt was the survivors who had been excavating artifacts. They had been busy running away from the boss before ending up where they were, and they were exhausted and covered in all sorts of injuries. The association members wrapped up their injuries with bandages and passed some water they had brought along for the survivors to drink.Their group increased in number when the survivors joined, but Kang Yoon-Soo still led the group at the forefront. Whenever he turned on a forked road or passed by unfamiliar terrain, he found another group of survivors. The scene that unfolded right before their eyes seemed like magic to the association members, and they could not believe it at all.An association member who was astounded by Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s navigation skills could not hide his curiosity and asked Shaneth, \u201cHow does he know the excavation site like the back of his hand? Is that youngster a seasoned explorer at his age?\u201d\u201cWell, you might be right\u2026 but if it\u2019s Kang Yoon-Soo, you would have to include swordsman, necromancer, alchemist, and clairvoyant as well,\u201d Shaneth said in response, shocking every one of the association members.Kang Yoon-Soo kept finding survivor after survivor, and the last of them to be found was a boy hiding by himself. The boy gulped down the water he was given and said, \u201cI was the last one who was chased by the boss monster.\u201dThe survivors confirmed that everyone they knew had been rescued, and only then could Ramax breathe a sigh of relief. He said, \u201cIt\u2019s really fortunate that nobody died. The only thing left for us to do is to escape from this excavation site.\u201dAt that moment, a loud sound reverberated from across the tunnel. It was not the voice of a human, but rather a cry that resembled the screeching sound of tearing metal.\u201cKirigryaaaah!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the boss monster! It\u2019s that monster that tried to kill us all!\u201d a survivor whispered while trembling in fear. All of the survivors gulped as they waited nervously, and even the members of the Red Rock Excavators could not help but be filled with unease.Just when the large shadowy figure was about to emerge from the far end of the tunnel, Kang Yoon-Soo raised his right arm and said, \u201cSummon White.\u201dA large white werewolf suddenly appeared out of nowhere, still bearing the Chain of Obedience on its neck. Those present suddenly froze in fear. Shaneth was surprised as well by White\u2019s appearance.If White were to roar here, it was obvious that they would be easily found by the boss monster. However, White was behaving unlike its usual self. It just quietly stared down at Kang Yoon-Soo without making a sound, then growled quietly in the werewolf language. \u201cGrrrrr\u2026 Orkan, arukiran, ramikurunra, ramir, urnokra.\u201dIt might have sounded like meaningless growls and grunts to others, but Kang Yoon-Soo fully understood what the beast was saying. It meant, \u201cGrrrrr\u2026 Human, I do not trust you. You are weaker than me and your temper is bad. What I mean to say is, you look like your father\u2019s dick.\u201cBut I changed my mind when I saw the ancient wolf that came out of your wrist device. Auron, the wolf of strength, is revered and worshiped by all wolves! If Auron has helped you, there must be a reason why. I have decided to serve you as my master.\u201dThen, the chains around its neck slowly cracked and fell to the ground\u2014the \u2018Chain of Obedience\u2019 had come off. White had decided to serve Kang Yoon-Soo as its master.White was not aggressive or wild at all, even though it had been released from forced obedience, and it looked at Kang Yoon-Soo the same way a dog would look loyally at its owner.Kang Yoon-Soo said, \u201cWhite.\u201d\u201cCharnoroki?\u201d White replied.\u201cBe the bait and lure the boss monster away,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo ordered.\u201cKarukur\u2026\u201d It was a command that White would have usually disobeyed, but it nodded and ran toward the other side of the tunnel instead.\u201cOh my god\u2026\u201d someone said. The onlookers could not believe their eyes.Werewolves were usually well known to be wild and aggressive monsters; a fully grown adult bull would be ripped to shreds if a werewolf swiped it with its razor-sharp claws once. And yet, that werewolf was listening to the commands of a human?All eyes were on Kang Yoon-Soo after White listened to his commands and left, and the way people looked at him suddenly changed. It was now difficult to believe he was merely a simple pathfinder.It was then that White\u2019s loud roar, followed by the sounds of battle, rang out from the far end of the tunnel.\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.The survivors and the excavators hurriedly left toward the surface. However, a strong vibration suddenly approached them from behind just as they were about to reach the exit of the excavation site. It was the same kind of vibration Shaneth had initially felt when they were excavating artifacts.\u201cKirigruriyaaaaah!\u201dThe boss monster was a dragon made out of bones. It has two large wings with not a single patch of leather covering them, and its skull contained two glowing red eyes. It was a gigantic and grotesque monster.[Bone Dragon, Skeltrodon (Boss, Level 174) has appeared!]Bone Dragons were ancient creatures believed to have been lost in history. They usually roamed alone unlike other boss monsters, but the dragon was still intimidating nonetheless.It had been trapped underground for a long period of time, so it appeared to be smaller than a normal dragon and its teeth were dull, but the core embedded deep within its bones still shone brighter than anything else that existed in the underground.The Bone Dragon beat its skeletal wings as it quickly charged toward the group in midair.\u201cKyarrng! Rokra! Urnokra!\u201d White roared as it suddenly charged and jumped up toward the Bone Dragon, slamming into its wings and disrupting its flight. The survivors screamed as they ran out of the excavation site, but one person was pushed down by the wave of bodies and fell down.\u201cHuk!\u201d Someone fell with a groan.\u201cLeader!\u201d someone cried. The one who had fallen was Ramax.The Bone Dragon did not fail to notice the old man, and it breathed out immensely hot and destructive black fire from its bony mouth. White jumped back to avoid the black fire, and the Bone Dragon quickly took the opportunity to fly and charge toward Ramax.\u201cHing!\u201dRamax closed his eyes as he curled up, awaiting his fate of being ripped to shreds by the Bone Dragon.Clang!Kang Yoon-Soo blocked the Bone Dragon\u2019s attack in a split second, however, and Ramax took the chance to escape out of the excavation site.The Bone Dragon did not pursue the group after they had left the excavation site. It was as if it treated the excavation site as the boundary of its territory.\u201cThank you!\u201d\u201cWe survived thanks to you!\u201dThe survivors started to gather around Kang Yoon-Soo as they thanked him one by one.Ramax, who had survived by a hair\u2019s breadth, said in a trembling voice, \u201cThank you so much! I would\u2019ve been dead if it weren\u2019t for you!\u201dHowever, Kang Yoon-Soo ignored their gratitude as if he could not hear them at all. He readied Ravian\u2019s Longsword as he quietly said, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cAlright!\u201d Shaneth replied enthusiastically as she readied her Death Scythe, and the pair entered the excavation site once again.White growled with its claws out as the Bone Dragon looked at its enemy through its glowing red eyes. The dragon suddenly reared up and let out a deafening roar.\u201cKirgriyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Summon 316 Blood Bats.\u201d He pointed toward the flying Bone Dragon and said, \u201cKill it.\u201dShriek!The Blood Bats let out an ear-splitting shriek before spreading their wings and charging toward the Bone Dragon. They attacked the Bone Dragon and an aerial battle began.The Bone Dragon was relentlessly attacked by the bats\u2019 sharp fangs, and the Rotten Mudgems gathered mud from the excavation site and flung it toward the Bone Dragon. However, the attacks of the undead were ineffective against the Bone Dragon.\u201cKirikiryaaaaah!\u201d The Bone Dragon let out a gout of dark flame from its mouth\u2014it was Black Dragon\u2019s Breath. Black Dragon\u2019s Breath was even stronger than the flames of a fire spirit. The Bone Dragon was a monster that had high resistance against fire, which was why Kang Yoon-Soo had not summoned Sally for the fight.Multiple Blood Bats were burned to a crisp and fell to the ground. Kang Yoon-Soo waved his hand around as he gave more orders. \u201cRotten Mudgems, throw the corpses of the Blood Bats into the sky.\u201dThe Rotten Mudgems picked up the corpses of the Blood Bats that had been killed by the Bone Dragon, and flung them toward the dragon.Kang Yoon-Soo quickly used a skill once the corpses were about to hit the Bone Dragon\u2019s wings. \u201cCorpse Explosion.\u201dThe corpses of the Blood Bats simultaneously exploded and inflicted damage on the Bone Dragon. Kang Yoon-Soo used \u2018Corpse Explosion\u2019 over and over again until the skill gained a level.[The skill level of Corpse Explosion has increased.][Explosions will now trigger chain explosions.]The Bone Dragon could no longer focus on flight because of the continuous barrage of explosions, and it decided to land on the ground. The moment it landed, however, Shaneth swung her Death Scythe down at its tailbone.\u201cKarigriyaaaaah!\u201d The Bone Dragon let out another gout of black flames as it roared in pain.\u201cKyaaaah!\u201d Shaneth screamed as the black flame engulfed her. She had believed in her resistance and tried to take the black flame head-on, but she soon realized that the black flame was hotter than what she could handle. The Bone Dragon\u2019s breath was something even she could not withstand.\u201cKyaaaarigaaaah!\u201d The Bone Dragon roared as White lunged at it and dug its claws deep into the dragon\u2019s ribcage, trying to tear them apart. The Bone Dragon thrashed for a while before managing to bite White\u2019s neck.As White was roaring in pain, however, Kang Yoon-Soo smashed the Bone Dragon\u2019s skull with Ravian\u2019s Longsword. The Bone Dragon wildly swung its claws as it tried to catch the human that was causing damage to its skull, but Kang Yoon-Soo lowered his stance as he evaded every claw swipe before stabbing his sword toward the core located between the Bone Dragon\u2019s ribs.The Bone Dragon thrashed and squirmed in pain as its core was stabbed, and Kang Yoon-Soo used the new opening to use the ability attached to Ravian\u2019s Longsword\u2014Vitality Absorption. Vitality Absorption was an ability that drained the life force of any creature the sword came into contact with.\u201cVitality Absorption.\u201d[You have drained a fraction of the Bone Dragon, Skeltrodon\u2019s life force.][You have absorbed one of Skeltrodon\u2019s characteristics.][The chance of sustaining bone injuries has decreased.]That was not all, however. Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s mana regenerated quickly due to the \u2018Ring of Life Suppression\u2019, and he cast another spell. \u201cLife Drain.\u201dIt was the Necromancer\u2019s signature skill, Life Drain. It was also a skill that absorbed the life force of another. Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s use of both skills that drained the Bone Dragon\u2019s life force made it sustain continuous damage, while he on the other hand could keep fighting without getting tired at all.\u201cKirigriyaaaaah!\u201d The Bone Dragon charged toward Kang Yoon-Soo, finding the human annoying.Clang!Kang Yoon-Soo continuously attacked the Bone Dragon with his longsword, but the dragon\u2019s bones were quite sturdy. The longsword could not cause them to crack.\u201cKirikriyaaah!\u201d Black flames poured out of the Bone Dragon\u2019s mouth, and the attackers suddenly spread out to either side to avoid the devastating fire.The Bone Dragon\u2019s black flames heated up the area; in fact, the heat was so intense that some parts of the floor started to melt. It made the combatants all the more cautious, as the slightest graze from the flames would inflict significant damage.\u2018This guy has always been annoying to deal with,\u2019 Kang Yoon-Soo thought.The Bone Dragon was a powerful boss monster. Its bones were so sturdy that it was not easy to inflict any damage on it with swords, and it was relatively agile too despite its huge size. It was capable of flying quickly, and the black flame it breathed could melt almost anything.The Blood Bats had all been destroyed, and there were only a handful of Rotten Mudgems left. The situation was significantly stacked against them.Kang Yoon-Soo suddenly said, \u201cRetreat.\u201dThe Bone Dragon charged toward them as it smashed stalactite after stalactite. Kang Yoon-Soo grabbed Shaneth and leaped atop White, and White fled at incredible speed. They barely managed to escape from the excavation site.\u201cOh! Are you guys alright?\u201d Ramax asked worriedly, and the other excavation group members as well as the survivors looked toward the party with great concern.\u201cWe\u2019re alright, but we weren\u2019t able to kill the Bone Dragon. It\u2019s a shame.\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo answered with empty words as he put on an act, appearing exhausted.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d Ramax mused, deep in thought. Then, he spoke up and said, \u201cYou aren\u2019t only my savior, but also everyone else\u2019s. There\u2019s no way we can just sit back and watch as our savior is going through all of this. Also, if that Bone Dragon is left as is, we won\u2019t be able to continue excavating. I\u2019ll give you the contribution points in advance.\u201d[Your achievement in rescuing 150 civilians and members of the Red Rock Excavators has been acknowledged.][Your contribution points have increased by 150,000.][Current Contribution Points: 151,245]It was an astounding amount of contribution points. It was an amount that even a seasoned excavator would be unable to earn even if they worked day and night without rest for months.Kang Yoon-Soo exchanged his newly earned contribution points for the \u2018Staff of Lightning\u2019 and the \u2018Magic Amplifying Bracelet\u2019.[Staff of Lightning]Rating: RareMana Increase: 125A staff that can call forth powerful lightning. The user may be electrocuted as well if it is used carelessly. The ability \u2018Release Lightning\u2019 may be used four times a day.[Magic-Amplifying Bracelet]Rating: RareMana Increase: 445Mana Regeneration: +25A bracelet that significantly increases the magic power of the user, as well as mana regeneration.Accessories such as necklaces, rings, and trinkets were usually sold at an expensive price. They were much more complex to manufacture than weapons and armor, and even if they could only give small boosts alone, they had an advantage in that one could equip numerous accessories at the same time. Besides that, a bracelet that increased the user\u2019s magic power would be an extremely expensive item.Shaneth looked at Kang Yoon-Soo skeptically as she asked, \u201cDo you know how to use magic staves as well?\u201dMagic staves required their users to have an understanding of magic for them to be used properly, which was one of the reasons why it was difficult to change into the Sorcerer class. Magic could not be cast just by wildly swinging a staff; rather, it required a calculated movement, or sometimes even tens of calculated movements, for a spell to manifest. There was a distinct difference between offensive magic and magic like raising undead or summoning spirits.However, Kang Yoon-Soo nodded and answered as if stating the obvious, \u201cYes.\u201dHe had once reached the pinnacle of mana as a Magician in one of his previous lives. Kang Yoon-Soo had a perfect understanding of being both a Magician and a Swordsman after reaching the pinnacle of both classes. \u2018A magician is effective in a brawl, and a warrior is better in a duel.\u2019He held the \u2018Staff of Lightning\u2019 in his left hand, and equipped the \u2018Magic Amplifying Bracelet\u2019 on his right wrist. With a black longsword in his right hand, and a staff bearing various exquisite engravings on it in his left hand, seeing him wield a staff and a sword simultaneously made it difficult to tell whether he was a Magician or a Swordsman. He looked like a Magic Swordsman, a class usually only heard of in folktales; even the survivors who trusted him could not help but express their skepticism.\u201cWhat? Why is he using a sword and a staff at the same time?\u201d\u201cMaybe he plans to use the sword and magic at the same time?\u201d\u201cNo way! Don\u2019t you know that\u2019s like doing needlework with your left hand and hammering with your right?\u201d\u201cDo you think that man is a dual-class? You know, that rare phenomenon where two classes are merged into one!\u201dKang Yoon-Soo ignored the onlookers\u2019 murmurs and quietly walked toward the excavation site. White followed after him, even as it licked its wounds.Shaneth walked beside him and asked, \u201cIs there anything you can\u2019t do?\u201dKang Yoon-Soo seriously pondered for a minute before answering, \u201cAbstaining from alcohol.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Shaneth was speechless.***They entered the excavation site once again, and the Bone Dragon spread its wings as it roared. \u201cKrigriyaaaah!\u201dThe Bone Dragon flew toward them at a low altitude, but Kang Yoon-Soo raised his staff and slammed it against the ground.Bzzt!Blue lightning started to rain down; it was so intense that just being grazed by it would definitely electrocute anyone. The intense lightning struck down on the Bone Dragon and inflicted heavy damage on it.Kang Yoon-Soo continued his magic attack on the Bone Dragon. \u201cRelease Lightning.\u201dThe ability \u2018Release Lightning\u2019 unleashed the mana stored within the magic staff to summon even stronger lightning against the target. Fierce lightning struck down on the Bone Dragon.White did not miss the chance to charge toward the Bone Dragon. \u201cGrrrrr! Urnokra!\u201dWhite attacked the Bone Dragon\u2019s tailbone, but the Bone Dragon retaliated by slamming White\u2019s waist. White sustained critical damage, but it managed to hold on and lunge toward the Bone Dragon\u2019s tailbone. The beast bit down on the Bone Dragon\u2019s tailbone as it clung on.Shaneth took the opportunity to strike the Bone Dragon\u2019s skull with her Death Scythe. The Bone Dragon tried to resist, but Shaneth stubbornly refused to back down and rained down a barrage of attacks on it.Bam! Bam![The Bone Dragon, Skeltrodon has been inflicted with the Curse of Sloth.][The target\u2019s movement and defense have been significantly reduced.]The Death Scythe had the ability to inflict curses upon damaging enemies, and the Curse of Sloth was one of the seven curses it could inflict. The Bone Dragon\u2019s movement slowed down, and its bones seemed to have softened somewhat.Kang Yoon-Soo relentlessly swung both his sword and his staff at the Bone Dragon. A lightning bolt struck whenever he swung his staff, and he thrust his sword at the Bone Dragon\u2019s core to inflict critical damage. He did not forget to use both \u2018Vitality Absorption\u2019 and \u2018Life Drain\u2019 continuously against the Bone Dragon, either.As the Bone Dragon was being abused by Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s continuous barrage of attacks, it suddenly opened its mouth wide.\u201cAvoid it,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo told his team.Shaneth and White instantly obeyed his orders as they disengaged from the Bone Dragon, and the black flames it breathed out melted the floor at the spot they had been standing in just moments before. The dragon breath used by most dragons had limited uses and long casting times, but its destructiveness was not something to underestimate.The Bone Dragon continued breathing out black flames as it tried to keep the attackers at bay. They had lost their chance to capitalize on their momentum, and if the Bone Dragon kept using dragon breath, their chance of winning against it would be zero.At that moment, something that would change the tides of the battle happened.Shaneth suddenly grasped her chest as she fell to one knee. She gasped for air as her breathing became rough and ragged. \u201cSomething hot is swelling up in my chest\u2026!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 35": "Chapter 35Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe Bone Dragon did not miss the opportunity to unleash its dragon breath towards Shaneth.Fwaaa!The black flame engulfed Shaneth as it tried to consume her, but Shaneth was not being burned by it. A bright red luster surrounded her body as if it were protecting her from the black flame; it was the bright light of the power fragment.[The Chosen One has completed all conditions.][The first stage of the power fragment has been released.][The Soldier class has evolved into the Ignus Warrior class.][The skills and characteristics of the Soldier class have disappeared.][You have obtained the unique skills of the Ignus Warrior class.][Your class evolution has opened new characteristics.][Your fire resistance has increased by one level.][Your equipment will not be burned by fire.][Your strength and vitality have increased.][Your mana has increased.][Your affinity with fire spirits has increased.][Your affinity with ice spirits has decreased.][Your combat skills have all increased by one level.][You may hear the Ignus Dragon\u2019s whispers from now on.][You have learned the unique skill \u2018Pyrokinesis\u2019.][You have learned the unique skill \u2018Fire Strike\u2019.]A Class Evolution had been unlocked. It was normal for someone to get the option to change their class, but having one\u2019s class forcefully changed was a very rare occurrence.The benefits of the Soldier class might have disappeared, but it was not a loss at all for her. The Ignus Warrior class was not only superior to the Soldier class in terms of base stats, but also greatly superior to it in all other aspects. She now had higher stamina with which to fight continuously, and her fire resistance was now stronger as well. Additionally, she could handle more kinds of weapons compared to other basic combat classes.\u201cHaa\u2026 Ha\u2026\u201d Shaneth gasped for air.The way she moved had changed greatly from just moments before. Her desire to not be a hindrance to Kang Yoon-Soo and help him instead had caused her to evolve. Now, she was no longer afraid of the Bone Dragon\u2019s black flames.Kang Yoon-Soo called out to the newly evolved Shaneth. \u201cShaneth.\u201d\u201cYes! I\u2019m overflowing with power!\u201d Shaneth exclaimed.\u201cBe my shield,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.\u201c\u2026Alright,\u201d Shaneth replied.Thus, Shaneth began to stand at the forefront and block the Bone Dragon\u2019s flames head-on whenever it breathed them out. The destructive black flames could no longer inflict any damage on her. The Bone Dragon was soon cornered after its breath attack was rendered ineffective, and they rained down a barrage of attacks on it.\u201cRelease Lightning. Release Lightning. Release Lightning.\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo swung his Staff of Lightning and struck the Bone Dragon with lightning strike after lightning strike, and he even used up all of the staff\u2019s charges to call forth devastating lightning and inflict massive amounts of damage to the Bone Dragon.The magic attacks were very effective against the Bone Dragon, which lacked any sort of magical barrier. In time, cracks began to form on the dragon\u2019s sturdy bones.\u201cKirigriyaaah!\u201d The Bone Dragon spread out its wings as it attempted to escape, but Shaneth leaped up and slashed both wings with her Death Scythe.The boss monster fell to the ground, and Kang Yoon-Soo stabbed his longsword into the dead center of its skull. Kang Yoon-Soo shattered the Bone Dragon\u2019s skull and stabbed its core, destroying both.[You have defeated the Bone Dragon, Skeltrodon (Boss, Level 174).][Your level has increased by 12.]Kang Yoon-Soo was now Level 86. He skillfully dismembered the Bone Dragon and stored it in his dimension bag.[Ancient Dragon Bone]A piece of the Bone Dragon. Its value lies in being researched or used as crafting material. It is an ancient bone that has not eroded over time and still maintains its durability.[Skeltrodon\u2019s Eyes]Color: RedThe eyes of an ancient dragon. Time has crystallized them, but the magic power of an ancient dragon can be felt in them.Dragon eyes held different magic based on their color, and in the case of Skeltrodon\u2019s red eyes, they stored fire attribute magic. It was possible to refine such eyes into dragon eye jewels with special magic or crafting skills.\u2018I have no use for Skeltrodon\u2019s eyes, but I\u2019ll keep them just in case,\u2019 Kang Yoon-Soo thought.There were some shiny items underneath the remains of the Bone Dragon, and upon closer inspection, they were a stone tablet with mysterious characters engraved on it and a brightly glowing piece of stone.[Tablet of Records]A tablet that holds records of missing history. It has been severely damaged and it is difficult to read the characters engraved on it, but a seasoned archeologist might be able to restore it.[Ancient Stone of Requiem]An extremely rare piece of stone. It looks simple but holds a brilliant luster, and it contains a forgotten power. The details of the stone will be forever lost if it is not crafted properly. It is one of the highest-grade crafting materials.Kang Yoon-Soo stored both items in the dimension bag before leaving the excavation site. He notified the excavators that the Bone Dragon was dead.Ramax could not hide his joy upon hearing the good news and grabbed Kang Yoon-Soo and Shaneth\u2019s hands, exclaiming, \u201cThank you! Our association would have been in ruins if it weren\u2019t for you!\u201dKang Yoon-Soo took out the Tablet of Records from his dimension bag and handed it to Ramax. Ramax and the other members could not hide their surprise; their mouths were left hanging open in astonishment.\u201cThis\u2026 It\u2019s an ancient tablet, right?\u201d\u201cWasn\u2019t this believed to be lost forever?\u201d\u201cI knew it. You aren\u2019t an ordinary man.\u201d Ramax inspected the tablet before shaking his head in disappointment. \u201cPhew\u2026 It\u2019s unfortunate but its condition isn\u2019t good. It\u2019s impossible to read the characters describing the missing history. This will take at least a month to restore; come drop by then to collect it. I promise to restore it by then.\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019ll do it myself,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.\u201cWhat? What did you say you would do?\u201d Ramax doubted his ears.Kang Yoon-Soo took the tablet back from Ramax and headed inside the tent. Just as he brought out a set of repair tools, the association members suddenly rushed at him and exclaimed, \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?!\u201d\u201cRestoring it,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo answered.\u201cAre you crazy?! Restoring artifacts isn\u2019t an easy job just anyone can do! You could damage the tablet and turn it into a useless piece of stone!\u201d Ramax exclaimed as he ran toward Kang Yoon-Soo.However, Shaneth stood in his way and blocked him. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. If it is that man, he will be able to do it,\u201d she said, trying to calm down the old man.\u201cBut! It\u2019s impossible for a beginner like him to restore that valuable artifact!\u201d Ramax pleaded.However, perhaps because Shaneth had spent too much time with Kang Yoon-Soo, she had started to sound pretty brazen. She said, \u201cWe were the ones who found it first. So doesn\u2019t it belong to us, and thus we can do whatever we want with it?\u201d\u201cStill! Do you have any idea how much historical value that tablet holds?!\u201d Ramax would not back down and protested heavily.However, the Red Rock Excavators could do nothing but watch from the sidelines, filled with suspense and unease, as the man worked on the tablet.Kang Yoon-Soo suddenly raised a hammer and struck the tablet hard.Crack!The Tablet of Records was split into two pieces, and the faces of the onlookers in the tent turned ghostly pale. What had happened right in front of their eyes was so unbelievable that an eerie silence filled the tent, as no one could muster up their voice to speak.A bluish light started to escape from the broken tablet.[The seal holding the records within the ancient tablet has been broken.][The records have begun flowing out of the ancient tablet.][A magician sacrificed his own soul to preserve the records.][Only some of the records remain, but you may access the missing portion of history.]\u201cOh!\u201d It was only then that the excavators were relieved.The characters written on the ancient tablet were nothing more than a trap; they were merely scribbled gibberish made to look like ancient characters. Multiple scholars had tried to decipher the tablet in the past, but the way to access the records was actually quite simple. They only had to break it.\u2018It was so simple that no one imagined it to be this easy,\u2019 Kang Yoon-Soo thought.A lot of research would actually be required to finally figure out how to access the tablet, but that would only apply if it were done the normal way\u2014and normal did not apply to Kang Yoon-Soo.The blue light that flowed out of the tablet started to change the surroundings, and the dusty tent suddenly turned into a war zone. The missing portion of history was being played like a video right before their eyes; those present in the tent held their breaths as they focused on the miracle unfolding.Thousands of vile demons roamed across the landscape. Most of them had black wings on their backs, taking the form most people commonly recognized; however, some of them looked quite vile and grotesque. Some, for instance, had thousands of eyes embedded across their bodies.Numerous demons of all shapes and sizes charged toward a horde of monsters and feasted on them; even gigantic monsters that would be hard to hunt even by a party of hundreds were mercilessly slaughtered, and the stench of blood filled the air.However, the strangest scene of all was the sky. The gloomy sky looked like a doorway flung wide open as the clouds parted right down the middle; the demons were descending to the earth from the heavens.Five humans stood at the edge of a cliff as they witnessed the grotesque sight from above; their appearances and outfits looked quite familiar. They were the Five Ancient Heroes who had stopped the invasion of Pandemonium in the past, and they looked exactly the way they had been described to future generations.\u201cThe doors of Pandemonium will be fully open in a matter of hours,\u201d an elf wielding a large wooden longbow muttered. He was the one who would be known in the future as the Noble Archer, Nahilen.\u201cIt\u2019s already hell down there. I can\u2019t imagine how bad it will be after the doors fully open,\u201d Sephia, the Infinite Dimension Wizard, said as she stroked her golden hair.\u201cThe war with the demons will start once the door fully opens, and the strongest being from Pandemonium will cross over to this side. We have to stop that at all costs\u2026 But something\u2019s fishy\u2026\u201d Minerva, the Grand Alchemist, said in a tone that seemed calm and calculating.\u201cI welcome the world being covered in darkness and blood, but it has to be done by my hands. I cannot let them do that before me,\u201d Nakron, the Ultimate Necromancer, said as he tapped on his blade made of bones.\u201cYou guys are too talkative. Let me summarize it for you. Just as our parents always said, life\u2019s unfair. The armies of the continents have been wiped out, the demons of Pandemonium are crossing over to our continent, and all of the plans we made have all been for naught. I wouldn\u2019t mind eating that disgusting food Nakron cooked for us if it would help us out,\u201d said a man, the final member of the party.Nahilen and Sephia both burst out into laughter as Nakron swung his sword angrily at the man. However, the man easily avoided the sword as if it were a joke to him. He said lightly, \u201cIt was just a joke.\u201dThe man suddenly turned serious as he said gravely, \u201cWe just have to remember one thing.\u201dAll of the Ancient Heroes nodded.The man grasped his spear as he shouted, \u201cWe will protect our family, our friends, and our continent!\u201dThe demons charged at the Ancient Heroes as soon as they ran down the cliff; the five fought alone against thousands of demons. However, they pushed through the demons with immense destructive power, shredding their foes to pieces.Kang Yoon-Soo stared at the man at the forefront. Whenever the man swung his spear, the ground was shattered and several demons were ripped apart. He thought, \u2018Your past is always awkward no matter how many times I see it, Sirian.\u2019He was the authority above all creatures.The King of All Things.The only living hero.Sirian Lanchecaster.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He exclaimed, \u201cWhat?! You think an Artisan can\u2019t fight?\u201d\u201cNo, that\u2019s not what I meant\u2026\u201d Shaneth began.\u201cAlright, come outside,\u201d Henrick said firmly.The trio left the pub. The bill, of course, was paid by Kang Yoon-Soo.Henrick, who was obviously drunk, guided the two to the military training center. The place was still crowded with people training their combat skills amid the sound of clashing weapons. Henrick looked at Kang Yoon-Soo and said, \u201cHey, you. You have a sword, so I\u2019m guessing you know how to use it?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said simply.\u201cGood. I thought it was just for show, since you have a staff together with it,\u201d Henrick remarked.The military training center had weapons lined up, ranging from practice wooden swords to real steel swords. Henrick picked out two real swords with dull edges. \u201cShall we spar lightly? You can use your sword.\u201d\u201cOkay,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said as he pulled out Ravian\u2019s Longsword.The gazes of those training in the military training center focused on the two, who were about to spar with real swords. It was easy to wound one another when real swords were involved, which was why only experts sparred with real swords; doing so while trying not to wound one\u2019s opponent required a significant amount of skill and control.Most of the onlookers watching were worried for the two, but there were some who sighed as if they had seen numerous such fools, who had sparred with real swords only to end up getting hurt. Some of the people who prided themselves on \u201cliving by the sword\u201d frowned at the pair for insulting the sword.A man approached Shaneth and remarked, \u201cDoes it make sense that a pair of drunks will be sparring? Why don\u2019t you stop them, miss?\u201d\u201cUnfortunately, they aren\u2019t the kind of people who can be convinced to stop,\u201d Shaneth replied as she looked worriedly at the pair.Henrick wielded both swords as he got into an offensive stance. Suddenly, however, he put his hand into his coat and pulled out a small square box. He slowly opened the box, and a large wooden doll that was several meters tall emerged from it.The onlookers shouted in surprise.\u201cOh!\u201d\u201cHe was a Puppeteer!\u201dThe Puppeteer class made combat dolls and used them in battle. It was Shaneth\u2019s first time seeing a Puppeteer, because they were not a common class. To be frank, she had had no idea that a Puppeteer was even a combat class.\u201cI made this guy myself. You can go all out on him if you want,\u201d Henrick declared proudly.The combat doll tightly gripped swords in both hands. A thin thread extended out of Henrick\u2019s right hand, infused with his mana; the mana thread could not be cut easily, and it allowed him to manipulate the combat doll according to his will. However, manipulating and controlling a combat doll was not an easy task. The combat prowess of a Puppeteer heavily depended on their control.\u2018Henrick Elrickerson\u2026\u2019 Kang Yoon-Soo thought as he looked at the Puppeteer. He had been as intertwined with Henrick as he was with Shaneth in his previous lives, and Shaneth was someone he had been deeply involved with to begin with.He suddenly recalled the past, when Henrick had first died. He had cried in agony as he clutched the man\u2019s corpse back then. In that lifetime, Henrick had been his teacher and his sworn brother. Of course, those were just distant memories of a nonexistent past in this lifetime. However, that did not mean it was completely gone from his memories.Just as he was getting lost in melancholy; he heard Henrick\u2019s voice calling out, \u201cLet\u2019s start. Should I go first?\u201dKang Yoon-Soo snapped back to his senses. He nodded at the man who had been dead in his memories just a moment before, answering, \u201cYes.\u201dThe wooden combat doll creaked into motion. However, just when the onlookers thought it was having difficulty moving; its attack suddenly appeared in front of Kang Yoon-Soo. It struck down rapidly with its dual swords.Clang!Kwachik!Instantly, the wooden combat doll\u2019s waist was shattered.Henrick\u2019s sudden strike was so effective that nobody in the training center saw what had happened. The movements and swordsmanship displayed by the wooden combat doll had been so unique and effective that it was hard to believe a doll made of wood had performed them.However, the wooden combat doll\u2019s attack was neutralized in one exchange, and it was destroyed in a single blow.Nobody saw what kind of attack Kang Yoon-Soo had used, and nobody could explain how he had counterattacked. Those who had been laughing at the two drunks were immediately silenced; they stood frozen on the spot in disbelief, and some of them rubbed their eyes as if they could not believe what had just happened.Henrick laughed as he stared at the destroyed combat doll. He asked, \u201cHey, what was your name again?\u201d\u201cKang Yoon-Soo,\u201d came the reply.\u201cRight, Kang Yoon-Soo\u2026 What the hell are you?\u201d Henrick asked.\u201cWhy do you care?\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo asked back.\u201cYou\u2019re quite the jerk, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Henrick replied.Those were the words Henrick would end up repeating over and over again.***Henrick\u2019s luggage was quite simple and modest. It consisted of a crafting kit, a doll summoning box, a pouch of dried food, and all sorts of alcohol.He was loitering around the other two when Shaneth said, annoyed, \u201cPlease go wash up.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s bothersome,\u201d Henrick complained.\u201cThen don\u2019t come with us,\u201d Shaneth snapped.Henrick grumbled for a bit before he went and washed up, but he returned looking neat and tidy. He had changed his clothes for ones that were not ragged, and he now looked quite decent; he had handsome features to begin with.The trio purchased some cooking tools and ingredients, and left Riel to head north.Henrick asked curiously, \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be faster to ride a horse if we plan to go all the way to the capital?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo flatly rejected the notion.The legendary quest had been updated after they found the missing piece of history.[Legendary Quest: Loyal Subject]You have found the missing portion of history and facts that nobody has ever heard of. A creature related to the Ancient Heroes inhabits the roads to Riel. Meet up with the creature and continue your travels.\u201cA legendary quest?\u201d Henrick asked as he scratched his beard. It was news to him, as he had just joined the party.Shaneth put both arms on her waist, puffed out her chest, and proudly asked Kang Yoon-Soo, \u201cI guess we can tell him, right?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.Shaneth said, \u201cYes, we\u2019re currently doing a legendary quest.\u201d\u201cIs that so? Hmm\u2026 It must be a legendary quest related to the Ancient Heroes,\u201d Henrick replied, rubbing his chin.Night came as they walked, and Kang Yoon-Soo methodically checked the surroundings before choosing a campsite. He set up the campfire as Shaneth started cooking. Henrick laid out a blanket and prepared to sleep, only to get up and collect firewood after receiving an earful of nagging from Shaneth.Their food situation was not bad, as it had only been a day since they left the city. They enjoyed a scrumptious meal of pancakes, smoked ham, bread, cheese, and soup.Henrick could not hide his admiration at the sight of the food Shaneth had prepared. He remarked, \u201cI thought you looked like a miss who wouldn\u2019t even know how to use a kettle, but I guess your cooking skills aren\u2019t bad at all.\u201d\u201cYou praise me too much,\u201d Shaneth replied.\u201cNo no, your skills are comparable to the chefs at the royal palace. Especially the soup; it\u2019s really tasty.\u201d Henrick gulped down several bowls of the soup before going over to his luggage looking for something. He brought out a glass bottle with hard liquor sloshing in it.Kang Yoon-Soo held out his cup as if it were something they had previously agreed upon, saying, \u201cGive me a cup.\u201dHenrick remarked, \u201cOho, this guy knows his stuff. Drinking alone doesn\u2019t taste good, after all.\u201d\u201cDrink moderately; it\u2019s not good for your health,\u201d Shaneth nagged worriedly as the two men clinked their cups. She let out a sigh before tending to the campfire. Suddenly, though, she asked Kang Yoon-Soo, \u201cDon\u2019t you think we have to introduce Mister Henrick to our other companions?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.\u201c\u2018Mister\u2019? Why \u2018mister\u2019?! Call me oppa!\u201d Henrick protested.[1]Henrick was already blabbering in a drunken stupor. He was a \u201cnormal\u201d human, unlike Kang Yoon-Soo, so it was natural that he would be drunk after drinking that much.Kang Yoon-Soo raised his right hand as he said in his usual dry, mundane tone, \u201cSummon Sally.\u201dFlames started to gather in midair, manifesting into the form of a beautiful young girl. Henrick, after seeing Sally\u2019s clothes made from fire, asked Kang Yoon-Soo in confusion, \u201cYou were a Spirit Summoner?\u201dKang Yoon-Soo did not bother to reply. However, Sally ran toward him and looked at him with teary eyes, asking, \u201cPapa, where\u2019s my sibling?\u201d\u201cLater,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.\u201cHing\u2026! Then play with Sally!\u201d Sally started to cry, but Shaneth hugged her and calmed her down.Henrick was stunned by the scene unfolding in front of him. He remarked, \u201cI\u2019ve seen countless people who had contracts with spirits, but it\u2019s my first time seeing someone appease a crying spirit.\u201dHowever, it was too early to be surprised, as Kang Yoon-Soo called forth another summon. \u201cSummon White.\u201d\u201cGrrrrr\u2026!\u201d White growled.Henrick sobered up instantly. It was natural for him to become alert when a silver-white werewolf suddenly appeared before his eyes out of nowhere. He tensed up as he reached for the summoning box in his coat pocket.However, White had already pledged its loyalty to Kang Yoon-Soo. The werewolf sat beside Kang Yoon-Soo like a docile puppy, and the man began stroking its fur as if it were a house pet.\u201cGrrrr\u2026\u201d The werewolf let out a low growl. It was not a growl of rebelliousness; rather, it simply felt good from having its fur stroked. Kang Yoon-Soo took out a piece of meat from his backpack, throwing it toward White. White jumped to catch the meat and swallowed the whole piece, including the bones.Henrick could not help but stare at the strange party composition before saying, \u201cThat\u2019s an amazing group you have. A Continental, a Traveler, a spirit, and a monster. Hmm\u2026 Should I feel sorry that I\u2019m so normal\u2026?\u201d\u201cNo, Mister Henrick is quite the oddball too,\u201d Shaneth replied.\u201cWhy? Aren\u2019t I considered normal? No, wait\u2026 Maybe I\u2018m too handsome\u2026?\u201d Henrick mused.\u201c\u2026\u201d Shaneth said nothing.\u201cWhat\u2019s with that disgusted look? This fragile middle-aged man will get hurt\u2026\u201d Henrick complained. In any event, he had sobered up thanks to the appearance of the werewolf.Suddenly, his eyes narrowed and he shouted, \u201cGet down!\u201dShaneth, Sally, and White instinctively dropped low to the ground; the moment they ducked, numerous objects whistled past their heads\u2014it was a rain of arrows. Several archers aimed at them from afar before letting more arrows loose.\u201cGrrrr\u2026!\u201d White growled from behind the bushes, having taken cover behind them due to its large frame.Sally instantly extinguished her flames, as the fire would give away their position and make it easier for their enemies to target them in the dark.Henrick whispered as he crouched, \u201cDo you know what surprised me the most just now?\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Shaneth asked.\u201cKang Yoon-Soo, that guy\u2026 He already ducked even before we took cover,\u201d Henrick replied.The two glared at Kang Yoon-Soo, who nonchalantly replied, \u201cWell, you didn\u2019t get hurt.\u201d\u201cWhat a jerk,\u201d Henrick muttered.The arrows flew over their heads several more times. There was no guarantee that they were hitting anything, but the arrows kept coming. Kang Yoon-Soo sent the two summons back to the summon dimension. White was too big, and Sally\u2019s flames made her an easy target for the arrows.Henrick cursed under his breath before taking out his summoning box and saying, \u201cSummon three runner dolls.\u201dThree wooden dolls popped out of the box. These dolls had slender figures, as opposed to the combat doll he had summoned at the military training center in Riel. Henrick imbued his mana into the threads connected to the three wooden dolls as he crouched, and the three wooden dolls all sprinted in different directions.When their prey spread out in three different directions, the ambushers shouted in surprise.\u201cKironuko!\u201d\u201cOsikiradurin!\u201d1. \u201dOppa\u201d is what a girl would call an older brother in Korean. It\u2019s also widely used as a cute way for girls to address guys older than them, and in some cases, it\u2019s used similarly to \u2018daddy\u2019 or \u2018uncle\u2019 in Western culture. \u261cPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Kang Yoon-Soo was the first to stand up and draw his black longsword, and Shaneth and Henrick followed afterward. Seeing some movement through the tall, dense foliage, Kang Yoon-Soo nimbly ran toward the rustling and swung his longsword.\u201cGraaaaahk!\u201d The ambusher screamed in pain as he collapsed, blood spurting everywhere.Henrick went over to examine the corpse, and his eyes widened as he exclaimed, \u201cWhat? Isn\u2019t this an orc?\u201dThe green-skinned corpse holding a longbow belonged to an orc, and judging by the leather armor it wore, it seemed to have come with the intention to fight.It was at that moment\u2026\u201cKaruk!\u201dAn arrow flew, let loose by another orc who had come over after hearing the sound of battle. The arrow came from quite a short distance and easily avoiding it was out of the question. Just as the arrow was about to lodge itself deep within Shaneth\u2019s shoulder, Kang Yoon-Soo quickly swung his longsword in a lightning-fast movement.Clang!Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s longsword parried the arrow.The orc who fired the arrow crouched down as it maintained a low position hidden within the bush, and it continued to rapidly fire arrows at the group. However, Kang Yoon-Soo easily blocked all of the arrows with his longsword as he slowly walked toward the orc\u2014not even one arrow managed to hit him.The orc was stricken with fear as it roared, \u201cGuriyaaak!\u201dThe bloody longsword sliced the green-skinned monster in half. Kang Yoon-Soo flicked his longsword to rid it of blood as he walked back toward the group, not even having received a scratch.Henrick stared at him with a look of wonder on his face. \u201cThat guy, is he even human?\u201d he asked.\u201cYou\u2019ll get used to it soon enough\u2026\u201d Shaneth answered.The rest of the orcs gathered after two of them were killed by Kang Yoon-Soo, and tens of them encircled the group, exclaiming, \u201cGuri! Guriiik!\u201dThe orcs surrounded the group and aimed their bows, letting loose several arrows at the same time. There were no gaps for the party to avoid the arrows even if they wanted to, and all that awaited them was to become a pincushion of orc arrows.At that critical moment, Henrick suddenly put his hand in his summoning box and exclaimed, \u201cSummon twelve shield dolls!\u201dTwelve large wooden dolls that held large, rectangular shields that resembled Roman scuta[1] surrounded the trio. Henrick imbued his mana into the threads connected to the shield dolls and they immediately went into a defensive stance; the arrows bounced off the large shields.A normal Puppeteer who controlled two dolls was treated as an above-average Puppeteer. However, Henrick\u2019s skill at easily controlling twelve dolls at the same time was unheard of.\u201cI want to ask you the same thing; are you even human, Mister Henrick?\u201d Shaneth asked.\u201cIsn\u2019t it laughable compared to that guy?\u201d Henrick replied.Kang Yoon-Soo jumped over the shield dolls and charged toward the orcs as they were speaking. None of the arrows shot by the orcs managed to even graze his clothing, and three or four orcs were beheaded in an instant when he swung Ravian\u2019s Longsword.\u201cGuriiiik!\u201d The orcs\u2019 battle formation was broken, and they threw their weapons down as they ran away without even looking back.Shaneth and Henrick finally joined the fray. Shaneth swung her Death Scythe in a crescent arc toward the back of one of the orcs who was running away; the scythe slashed the orc apart as if it were a bloodthirsty beast in a frenzy.Henrick sent the wooden shield dolls back and summoned a different set of dolls. They were armed with shortbows\u2014archer dolls.\u201cCrossbows for a bunch of orcs? Not bad; I\u2019ll make good use of them,\u201d Henrick said as he moved his hands that were connected to threads imbued with mana. The archer dolls picked up the dropped bows and quivers and used them against the orcs. Whenever an archer doll let an arrow loose, it found itself buried in the back of an orc\u2019s head, and the orcs fell down one by one.Henrick\u2019s control skills were nothing short of extraordinary. The fact that he was able to calculate the trajectory of the arrows from the perspective of his dolls was a nearly impossible feat by itself.All of the orcs soon died one by one, leaving behind only a trail of blood. The loot the party obtained from the orcs consisted of a steel whip, several pieces of steel, and a large hexagonal crystal.\u201cWhere do you think these orcs came from?\u201d Shaneth asked.\u201cI\u2019m guessing they lived in the nearby woods, and by the looks of them being equipped with crossbows and leather armor, I\u2019m guessing they were hell-bent on hunting for humans. Something\u2019s not right though; orcs usually never leave their burrows\u2026\u201d Henrick answered.Kang Yoon-Soo silently raised his right arm and said, \u201cMass Raise Dead.\u201dThe dead orcs rose from the ground as undead.[14 zombie orcs have been sent to the summon dimension.][Summons currently stored in the dimension: 14 zombie orcs, White, and Sally.][Remaining space for additional summons: 684]Henrick looked on in horror as he tapped Shaneth\u2019s shoulder and remarked, \u201cHey, little miss nag, I think it\u2019ll take quite a while to get used to that guy\u2026?\u201d\u201cI was initially the same, but it\u2019s not that bad once you get used to it,\u201d Shaneth replied.\u201cHmm\u2026 Is that so?\u201d Henrick mused.Shaneth and Henrick felt a strange sense of companionship.Kang Yoon-Soo stared at the hexagonal crystal dropped by the orcs; it had the same color as the \u2018Ring of Life Suppression\u2019 he had.[Mysterious Crystal]A mysterious mineral. It seems to be composed of a different material from other crystals.A message suddenly appeared on the wrist device the moment Kang Yoon-Soo picked up the crystal.[You have discovered the real value of the crystal due to your commencement of the legendary quest.][Crystal of Darkness]A crystal made by the Death General Kalriven. The power to dominate life forms is stored within it. You will find the path to the Castle of the Dead if you break it. However, the Death General will be hostile to you.The Death General was an undead general that boasted great leadership, and it was also considered to be a top-class monster among the violent and vicious undead. It was also infamous for its deadly swordsmanship, as well as its ability to command a large legion of undead.\u2018I need to meet up with this guy to strengthen my Necromancer abilities,\u2019 Kang Yoon-Soo thought to himself.The Death General was not a monster that could be faced in their current state, but Kang Yoon-Soo did not hesitate to think twice before breaking the \u2018Crystal of Darkness\u2019.Crack!Kwachik![Gyaaaaaaah!]An ear-splitting, hair-raising scream flowed out of the crystal after it was broken by Kang Yoon-Soo, and numerous translucent souls flowed out of the crystal, forming a fog\u2014they were lost souls. The lost souls gathered together to form an eerie-looking white road.Kang Yoon-Soo confidently followed the road. Shaneth and Henrick, on the other hand, were shocked out of their wits.\u201cH-hey, Mister Kang Yoon-Soo?\u201d Shaneth called out.\u201cHey, you punk! Where are you going?! Are you trying to get yourself killed?!\u201d Henrick screamed at him.However, Kang Yoon-Soo nonchalantly replied, \u201cWe have business here; follow me.\u201dThe two looked at each other before sighing and following behind Kang Yoon-Soo.Henrick ground his teeth as he grumbled, \u201cIt hasn\u2019t even been a day since I traveled with you guys, but I\u2019ve decided. If I die, it\u2019s that punk\u2019s fault.\u201d\u201cI agree,\u201d Shaneth grumbled next to him.Kang Yoon-Soo quietly followed the road; it was unknown whether he was aware of the killing intent(?) his companions were emitting behind him.The sound of the lost souls wailing in agony echoed with every step they took on the road, and it felt as if the scenery was getting more dark and sinister the further they went down it. They walked quite a distance along the eerie road, passing into a secluded forest; eventually, a vast transparent lake greeted them. The lake was so vast and wide that they could not see the other side of it.\u201cHow will we cross this lake?\u201d Shaneth asked.Kang Yoon-Soo pointed somewhere with his chin as if he had been waiting for her to ask that question. Just as he gestured, the eerie road made by the lost souls continued over the lake, and its clear waters froze over to form a road made of ice.\u201cThis is getting very creepy\u2026\u201d Henrick muttered under his breath.The trio walked across the vast lake on the icy road paved for them by the lost souls. The top of the lake was deathly silent, and neither the cries of beasts nor insects could be heard in the entire vast place. Even after they traveled across the surface for quite some distance, there seemed to be no end in sight.Henrick suddenly raised a suspicion that had been bugging him. \u201cIsn\u2019t it supposed to be morning by now?\u201d\u201cI agree, but this place is still dark, and there\u2019s no trace of life anywhere,\u201d Shaneth added. The place was not only creepy; it also made one feel fear creeping up their body.At that moment, Shaneth suddenly exclaimed, \u201cIt\u2019s a castle!\u201dAn enormous black castle stood in front of them in the middle of the lake. The castle was quite luxurious, except for the fact that the whole place was uniformly a single color, and that color was black. The castle was also surrounded by a dark fog that resembled storm clouds.Henrick could not help but grimace at the sight of the castle as he muttered, \u201cA castle in the midst of a frozen lake. I don\u2019t know who the lord of this castle is, but they must be quite romantic.\u201dThe castle was not visible from a distance, and it was certain that only those who walked along the road paved by the lost souls would be given the privilege to enter it. It was definitely a grand and majestic castle, but it also gave off an eerie atmosphere.\u201cDon\u2019t you think the castle will be filled with corpses?\u201d Henrick asked.\u201cDon\u2019t say that. It\u2019ll actually happen if you say that kind of stuff\u2026\u201d Shaneth grumbled.Then, Kang Yoon-Soo, who had been quiet for quite some time, suddenly said in his usual emotionless voice, \u201cIt\u2019s a castle the dead reside in.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d***As they walked toward the black castle, they could see that the water surrounding it was frozen solid. At the very moment they reached the castle gates, however, a group of knights wearing rusted armor suddenly fell down from the castle walls.\u201cHalt\u2026! Who\u2026 goes\u2026 there\u2026?!\u201d A voice that definitely did not belong to a human resounded. The knight beneath the armor was none other than a skeleton, and it was one of the high-tier skeleton variants\u2014a Skull Knight.\u201cClack! Clack\u2026!\u201d\u201cFilthy\u2026 intruders\u2026!\u201d\u201cStop\u2026 the\u2026 intruders\u2026! Foolish\u2026 humans\u2026!\u201dThe other skeletons also spoke.\u201cGet lost,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo demanded.\u201cWe\u2026 re\u2026 fuse\u2026!\u201d the skeletons responded.\u201cThen die,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said coldly.The party prepared for combat as Shaneth readied her Death Scythe and Henrick summoned his combat dolls from his summoning box.The Skull Knights, that numbered around twenty, also drew their swords as they exuded an immense amount of killing intent; the way they wielded their swords proved that they would not be easy opponents. They were around Level 90, and charged toward the party in a single group.Kang Yoon-Soo stood on the vanguard and blew away the Skull Knight at the forefront. He stabbed the collarbone of the Skull Knight and subsequently swung his Staff of Lightning, and a flash of blue lightning struck from above.Bzzzt! Boom!Five skull knights received a significant amount of damage as they retreated, and Henrick did not miss this opportunity as he controlled his combat dolls to smash the skull knight\u2019s bones.Shaneth, on the other hand, used her most recently acquired skill, calling out, \u201cPyrokinesis!\u201dFlames suddenly appeared and wrapped themselves around the Death Scythe. She swung her scythe in a large motion, and sparks of fire flew across the entire area as it passed by. The flame surrounding the Death Scythe was hotter and much more powerful than average fire magic.Five Skull Knights were set ablaze by the attack, and they staggered around while covered in fire. \u201cFire\u2026 hot\u2026!\u201d they exclaimed as they hurriedly retreated to the rear.Suddenly, a catastrophe occurred. Cracks began to form across the thin portions of the ice.Cr\u2026 Crack\u2026!The whole ice sheet started to wobble as one portion of it broke apart, and Henrick could not help but jump up furiously, exclaiming, \u201cYou stupid miss! Where the hell did you get the idea to use fire on top of ice?! Ack!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry! It was my first time using this skill\u2026 Kyaahhh!\u201d Shaneth exclaimed.The ice tilted heavily to one side as it lost its balance.Cr\u2026 Crack\u2026!The Skull Knights fell into the hole that formed from the cracks in the ice as they fell into the water, struggling to stay afloat. Shaneth and Henrick were no exception, as they too struggled to keep their balance and stay atop the ice.However, only one person was exempt from that struggle. Kang Yoon-Soo leisurely walked across the ice as if he were taking a stroll around his neighborhood.\u201cCome here,\u201d he said.1. The scutum is a rectangular, iron-rimmed shield, usually made of wood or wicker covered in leather, used historically by the Roman army. \u261cPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The ice stabilized after they reached the center, and thankfully, the cracks did not spread throughout the entire platform.Kang Yoon-Soo pulled Shaneth up, looking at her before saying, \u201cStupid.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Shaneth said nothing.\u201cI\u2019ve never heard such emotionless cursing in my life\u2026\u201d Henrick grumbled.Kang Yoon-Soo, on the other hand, was deep in thought. \u2018This wouldn\u2019t have happened if I had an ice spirit.\u2019The legendary quest would eventually give them an objective to raid a ruin; the material to create the ice spirit, Icicle, could be found in the center of that ruin. He thought, \u2018I have to meet the lord of this castle to do that.\u2019Kang Yoon-Soo stretched out his right hand and said, \u201cSummon 14 zombie orcs.\u201dAt the same moment that a group of blue orc zombies appeared, a loud voice reverberated from the castle. \u201cWho dares to raise corpses in the Castle of the Dead?!\u201dAn invisible and mysterious power filled the area as the fog surrounding the castle dissipated, and a gigantic black knight jumped down from the castle wall.Kwachik!The black knight stood upright after landing from its jump. It looked quite sinister, clad in full black armor; its skin was ghostly pale, and its eyes were a tainted black. In addition, the knight\u2019s gigantic frame had an imposing aura as it stood upright, towering above the group. The sword on its waist looked quite expensive and luxurious.[Death General Kalriven (Boss, Level N/A) has appeared!]Death General Kalriven, a high-ranking undead creature, had appeared; this high-leveled monster had the power to turn them into dust with one fell swoop of its sword.\u201cThe dead will rip you apart and swallow you, you Necromancer who treats life as a joke,\u201d Kalriven spoke with a deep and sinister voice that made the party\u2019s backs break out in cold sweat. Kalriven possessed an absurdly high amount of charisma, and the fact that they were face to face with the black knight was enough to make them go numb with fear.\u201cHeed my call, legions of the dead!\u201d Kalriven said in a booming voice as it stabbed its sword into the frozen lake. The ice covering the lake shattered into pieces.Kwachik!Suddenly, a legion of undead surfaced from the lake, pushing through the shattered ice. The undead legion numbered in the thousands; it was composed of various creatures, including low tier undead, mid-tier undead, zombies, ghouls, dullahans, and even banshees; even the Skull Knights that had fallen into the water surfaced and joined the legion.The trio was helplessly surrounded in an instant by the undead legion, and there was no room for them to escape.\u201cWe\u2019re screwed,\u201d Henrick grumbled as he bit his lips.\u201cYeah,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said nonchalantly.\u201cThis little punk!\u201d Henrick screamed and grabbed Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s collar as if the other man were his mortal nemesis from a previous life. \u201cYou little punk! You\u2019re more emotionless than a wooden doll! We\u2019re about to die because of you!\u201d\u201cLet go,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.\u201cYou have a solution, right? It really looks like we\u2019re going to die at this rate!\u201d Shaneth screamed in horror.The undead legion that was encircling them had an extremely commanding and threatening presence, and the presence of the boss monster, Death General Kalriven, made the situation seem all the more grave. The killing intent spilling out of its pitch-black eyes was enough to numb their senses from fear.\u201cI\u2019ll fix it, so let go,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.Henrick released him from his grip. It was not because he trusted Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s words; rather, that was just how desperate their current predicament was.Kang Yoon-Soo walked confidently toward the undead legion. The undead growled at him as if they were about to rip him to shreds at any moment. However, he walked calmly without changing expressions once, as if he had been through the exact same predicament numerous times.\u201cKalriven!\u201d he shouted.\u201cI have no desire to speak with an insignificant intruder. All forces, attack!\u201d Kalriven commanded. The undead started their fierce charge, and Shaneth and Henrick\u2019s faces turned blue from fear.It was at that moment that Kang Yoon-Soo, still unfazed by the situation, shouted loudly, \u201cLook at this!\u201d He raised his right arm, and the Ring of Life Suppression on his finger glistened.Kalriven opened its eyes wide as it said, \u201cWhat?! That ring is\u2026?\u201d It was flustered and commanded hurriedly, \u201cStop! All forces, stop the attack!\u201dThe undead obeyed Kalriven\u2019s command as they came to a halt. Kalriven ground its teeth as it screamed, \u201cThat ring is the Ring of Life Suppression that was handmade by Lord Nakron, the Ultimate Necromancer! How dare an insignificant human possess it?! Reveal your identity!\u201dKang Yoon-Soo crossed his arms as he confidently declared, \u201cI\u2019m the successor of Nakron.\u201d\u201cWhat did you say?!\u201d Kalriven exclaimed.\u201cYou stupid musclehead! Do I have to repeat myself? I\u2019m the successor of Nakron, the Ultimate Necromancer, and his only disciple!\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo shouted, furrowing his brow as he rebuked the black knight.\u201cStop lying! Are you telling me Lord Nakron had a disciple while he was alive? He was not someone who would easily pass on his teachings to just anyone!\u201d Kalriven retorted. The initial charismatic dominance it projected could no longer be found, as it evidently seemed to be surprised by the human\u2019s words.Kang Yoon-Soo raised the ring on his right hand once again as he asked, \u201cThen how would you explain this Ring of Life Suppression? Are you saying I tricked Nakron and stole it from him?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026!\u201d Kalriven was beyond flustered, as it could not think of any response.Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s voice suddenly changed, taking on a commanding tone filled with confidence and authority. \u201cThe way you welcome an important guest is a mess, Kalriven. Is this your way of repaying Nakron, who resurrected you from the dead?\u201dThose words were the final nail in the coffin. The Death General seemed to have made up its resolve, as it got down on one knee and stabbed its sword into the ice. The other undead followed suit, all bowing down along with it. Thousands of undead were now on their knees, bowing down and worshiping Kang Yoon-Soo.\u201cAlmighty successor! Please punish these insolent corpses!\u201d Kalriven screamed at the top of its lungs.Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s expression did not change one bit at the sight of the thousands of undead at his feet as he replied in a cold, authoritative voice, \u201cThe punishment will be postponed to a later date, insignificant fools.\u201d\u201cYou were the successor to Nakron, the ancient hero?\u201d Shaneth whispered, unable to hide her surprise.\u201cNo,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.\u201cYou\u2019re such a jerk\u2026\u201d Shaneth said as furrowed her brows.***The party entered the black castle with Kalriven escorting them. The interior of the castle was as sinister and eerie as its exterior. Its large hall was covered in cobwebs, and a bitterly cold draft flowed through it as well. The corridors were filled with numerous misshapen shadows lurking within, and a strange mist filled the air; the sounds of crying echoed in the distance.\u201cI hope you may forgive my insolence for failing to recognize you. I welcome you, the successor of Lord Nakron, to the Castle of the Dead,\u201d Kalriven said in a greatly humbled and respectful tone.The name of the black castle, in other words, was the Castle of the Dead.The trio was escorted to the VIP room. Although it was also sinister and eerie, as if to live up to its undead title, it was clean at the very least. A long dining table was present inside; it seemed that the castle\u2019s inhabitants were planning to serve dinner for the guests.\u201cServe the delicacies,\u201d Kalriven commanded. Numerous banshees and skeletons appeared to prepare a feast for the guests.A scrumptious(?) feast of bat wings, frog blood jellies, live squirming worms, and spider pie was laid out on the dining table. Shaneth and Henrick could not help but frown at the sight of the hideous things that had been served.\u201cShouldn\u2019t they at least differentiate whether their guests are humans or undead?\u201d Henrick complained.\u201cShh! They might hear you!\u201d Shaneth hushed him in a hurry.Being treated as a VIP by the undead was a rare experience one might only get once in a lifetime, but the experience itself could not be described as a good one.Suddenly, Kang Yoon-Soo stabbed a lamb\u2019s eyeball with his fork, putting it into his mouth with perfect dining etiquette and posture. The other two could not help but be stunned at the sight.\u201cIt\u2019s not bad,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.\u201cAs expected of the successor of Lord Nakron. Lord Nakron was also fond of these delicacies when he was alive,\u201d Kalriven said, seemingly moved by the sight of Kang Yoon-Soo eating.Kang Yoon-Soo continued eating the hideous things they called \u2018delicacies\u2019 without batting an eye.\u201cAre\u2026 you alright\u2026? Why are you eating that\u2026?\u201d Shaneth asked, trembling at the sight of him eating.\u201cBecause I\u2019m hungry,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.\u201cWhat\u2026?\u201d Shaneth asked, dumbfounded.Kang Yoon-Soo wolfed down plate after plate of the undead delicacies. At times, he would even grab a plate full of squirming bugs and eat them all, down to the last piece. It was necessary to enjoy the feast to increase his intimacy with Kalriven; just as he expected, Kalriven was looking at him with satisfaction.However, Henrick sighed at the sight of Kang Yoon-Soo eating and said in resignation, \u201cThat guy\u2019s more like an undead than an undead.\u201dThankfully, the undead laid out foods fit for human consumption soon enough. However, they were just an assortment of stiff, hard jellies and cold, bland soups, and the cold alcohol the undead served could chill the drinker down to the bones.Shaneth strictly stuck with food that looked edible by humans, while Kang Yoon-Soo and Henrick gulped down all of the alcohol served by the undead.Having chugged all of the alcohol served down to the last drop, Henrick licked his lips in satisfaction and exclaimed, \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit too cold, but the alcohol tastes fantastic!\u201dClack! Clack! Clack!The skeletons clacked their jaws as if to express their delight after hearing Henrick praise the alcohol they served; it seemed they had brewed the alcohol themselves.The undead cleared the plates once the feast was over, and Kalriven sat opposite from the trio. It exuded insurmountable pressure, even though it was just sitting there. A top-tier undead creature possessed significant intelligence and combat prowess, such that a Necromancer could not lightly deal with them as they wished; the Death General was not one to obey a Necromancer who was unworthy of its loyalty. The sight of an undead creature of Kalriven\u2019s caliber serving Kang Yoon-Soo with utmost respect was a testament to how amazing a Necromancer Nakron had been.\u201cYou may stay as long as you wish if you so desire,\u201d Kalriven said politely.However, Kang Yoon-Soo shook his head and said, \u201cI have business in this place, Kalriven.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Kalriven asked.\u201cI wish to undo the holy seal in the castle\u2019s basement,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.\u201c\u2026!\u201d Kalriven suddenly looked conflicted; its expression was a mix of surprise, admiration, and sadness. It spoke in a low voice after it silently contemplated what Kang Yoon-Soo had just said. \u201cThe holy seal\u2026 Are you aware of what it means to undo it?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.\u201cYou might end up dying,\u201d Kalriven warned him.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied. He added, \u201cI have to release the seal for you lot to be free.\u201dKalriven had a surprised expression, as if it had been struck in the back of its head with a hammer. The Death General got down on one knee, bowing its head while facing Kang Yoon-Soo; it was a knight\u2019s way of showing their loyalty to their master. It declared, \u201cTo be honest, I did not believe that you were the successor of Lord Nakron, because you looked very weak. However, I am certain of it now. I am certain that your soul is stronger than your physical form and you are the successor to Lord Nakron, and that you are the one I should devote my entire existence to.\u201dKalriven prostrated in front of Kang Yoon-Soo, and the rest of the undead followed suit as they bowed down one by one in front of him once more.However, Kang Yoon-Soo looked at the sight with emotionless eyes, and he did not feel a single thing in front of such a grand sight.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Please enlighten us insignificant beings as to your most noble name!\u201d Kalriven exclaimed while prostrating in front of Kang Yoon-Soo.\u201cKang Yoon-Soo,\u201d he replied in a low voice. Kang Yoon-Soo then slowly got up from his seat and began to speak in a tone befitting a ruler. \u201cI command you not as Nakron\u2019s successor, but as myself.\u201d\u201cWhat is it, my liege?\u201d Kalriven asked.\u201cDo not liken yourselves to mere corpses. Nobody shall refer to any being that moves and gives respect as a corpse,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.Kalriven was astonished, but it quickly snapped out of its daze and suddenly exclaimed, \u201cKang Yoon-Soo! I salute our new liege!\u201dKang Yoon-Soo\u2019s title suddenly changed from that of Nakron\u2019s successor to the monarch of the undead; it was the proof of the undead acknowledging him as their master.The undead expressed their joy upon the emergence of their new master. The skeletons clacked their jaws, the banshees danced and sang with their hideous voices, the ghosts flew around close to the ceiling, and the dullahans passed their heads around.\u201cIt might not be the right time to say this, but\u2026 Don\u2019t you think that guy is more sinister than the undead\u2026?\u201d Henrick grumbled as he looked at Kang Yoon-Soo.\u201cShh! I told you they might hear you!\u201d Shaneth rebuked him once again.Kalriven stood up and said, \u201cI will guide you to the basement; please follow me.\u201d***The basement of the Castle of the Dead was warm, which was very welcomed by the two who could not adjust to the cold castle above. However, the undead hastily retreated from the warmth as if they had met their natural predator.A bright, neat, and white corridor greeted them. Kalriven stood at the forefront as it said, \u201cThe basement of the castle is always flowing with holy energy because of the holy seal. That is why the undead are avoiding this place.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 but why are you alright?\u201d Shaneth asked.\u201cMadame, lover of my liege, I am an undead being raised by Lord Nakron with his heart and soul; that is why I can ignore the holy energy to some extent,\u201d Kalriven explained.\u201cWhat do you mean by\u2026 \u2018lover\u2019\u2026?\u201d Shaneth asked in confusion.Kalriven suddenly had a fierce expression and its eyes flashed. \u201cIf you are not his liege\u2019s lover, then are you nothing but a stranger? A mere human without any ties to his liege has no business being in the Castle of the Dead.\u201dShaneth had forgotten for a moment that the undead were always hostile toward the living, and this was the moment she realized that she was no exception.Henrick suddenly butted into the conversation as he wrapped his arms around Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s shoulder and said, \u201cYou\u2019re right! That miss is this guy\u2019s lover; they\u2019re just shy about it. Ah! I\u2019m this guy\u2019s older brother, by the way. I\u2019ll leave my brother in your care.\u201d\u201cI will devote my life to serving his liege,\u201d Kalriven replied.Shaneth whispered from behind Kalriven and asked, \u201cWhy are you his older brother, mister?\u201d\u201cThen am I his daddy?! Look closely; don\u2019t we look alike?\u201d Henrick retorted shamelessly.\u201cHe\u2019s much more handsome, in my opinion\u2026\u201d Shaneth murmured.\u201cTsk tsk\u2026 He\u2019s already covered this beautiful little miss\u2019 eyes\u2026 Lucky bastard\u2026\u201d Henrick teased her, even as his arm was still wrapped around Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s neck.Then, Kang Yoon-Soo suddenly said, \u201cBro.\u201d\u201c\u2026!?\u201d Henrick exclaimed.It was not only Henrick; even Shaneth was stunned at what Kang Yoon-Soo had just said. It was logical to play the family in front of Kalriven, but to think that the emotionless Kang Yoon-Soo would say such a thing!However, Kang Yoon-Soo said in his usual dry, emotionless voice, \u201cBro. Let go.\u201d\u201cY-yeah, my lovely little brother\u2026 I guess you got choked by my arm\u2026 Ha\u2026 Haha!\u201d Even the quick and witty Henrick was flustered by Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s sudden change in demeanor.A small room was at the end of the corridor, and the bright light and warmth gradually got stronger and stronger as they approached it.\u201cThat is the room where the holy seal was placed\u2026 A shameful act by Argon the priest\u2026 I will explain the specifics here, as even I cannot approach that room. Firstly, there are multiple steps to release the holy seal\u2026\u201d Kalriven began.\u201cStop. I hate long explanations.\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo cut the Death General off. He approached the room, and the moment he opened the door, light started to flood out of it.Kalriven shouted, panicking, \u201cMy lord! That room is dangerous even to humans!\u201dHowever, Kang Yoon-Soo marched on without a single hint of hesitation. The interior of the room was pure white, and there was a sword shining brightly in its center. He took a step into the room, and suddenly, a magic circle activated underneath his feet; several lights shot out from the magic circle.Ziiing!The room was instantly filled with numerous rays of light that resembled lasers. The moment a ray of light grazed the edge of Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s shoulder, the part of his clothing struck by it disintegrated.The magic circle was a defensive mechanism designed to disintegrate all intruders, and the chance of an undead being, much less a human, surviving it was very low. However, Kang Yoon-Soo nimbly twisted his body and avoided all of the incoming rays with relative ease. He then continued to dodge the rays, slashing the part of the ground where the magic circle was located with his longsword.The magic circle was damaged by his attacks, causing the rays of light to slow down with each strike. In time, when the magic circle was left severely damaged and unrecognizable, the rays of light finally stopped.However, that was not the end.Ziiing!A second magic circle appeared on the left wall this time, and more than ten rays of light chased after Kang Yoon-Soo. However, Kang Yoon-Soo repeated the same thing he had done the previous time. He avoided the rays of light and lodged his sword into the wall to damage the magic circle.Then, more magic circles showed up one by one on the right wall, the front wall, and the back wall in sequence. Even after Kang Yoon-Soo destroyed the magic circle on the back wall, yet another showed up on the ceiling. It would be impossible to avoid the rays of light from the ceiling, even for Kang Yoon-Soo.Kang Yoon-Soo looked back through the door and said, \u201cBro.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s get rid of that nickname when we get out of here\u2026\u201d Henrick muttered as he summoned small wooden dolls from his summoning box. The wooden dolls he summoned this time were colored, and smaller than the ones he had previously used. He imbued mana into the threads connected to the wooden dolls and threw them at the ceiling.\u201cAh! Won\u2019t the thread be cut?\u201d Shaneth asked.\u201cThe mana thread can\u2019t be cut by an external force,\u201d Henrick replied as he controlled the wooden dolls.The small wooden dolls clung to the ceiling like spiders, taking out daggers from their sleeves and starting to cut apart the magic circle above the room. The dolls Henrick had summoned this time were none other than assassin dolls. Henrick\u2019s hand movements were nothing short of magnificent, and the magic circle on the ceiling was destroyed in an instant.\u201cHow many dolls do you even have?\u201d Shaneth asked, her eyes wide with surprise.\u201cHmm\u2026 I\u2019m not sure\u2026 I think I put around 500 dolls in this summoning box alone?\u201d Henrick replied, rubbing his chin.\u201c\u2026\u201d Shaneth was speechless.\u201cLook at this little miss. Do you think I played around and did nothing while I aged?\u201d Henrick remarked.All of the magic circles were destroyed, and Kang Yoon-Soo pulled out the sword that had been shining brightly at the center of the room.[Sword of the Holy Cross]Rating: UniqueAttack Power: 3A sword made by a great holy man to seal evil undead. It has no value as a weapon, but an astronomical amount of holy power is stored within it.*You may deal fatal damage to a member of the demon race.*Stabbing the sword into the ground will have a high chance of alleviating the status ailments of allies.*You may receive a special quest related to the holy artifact of the goddess if you give this sword to a certain church.*The effectiveness of healing spells will multiply by three if used by a holy person.It was a unique-rated sword, but it lacked the power to be used as a weapon.\u2018However, this sword is an absolute necessity to complete the ruin raid quest that will come later.\u2019 Kang Yoon-Soo stored the Sword of the Holy Cross in his backpack, and the light in the room dissipated after he took the sword. The warmth receded, and the cold darkness from aboveground instantly spread and filled the basement.\u201cClack! Clack! Clack!\u201d\u201cGru-oooooooh!\u201dThe eerie cheering of the undead filled the air from afar. Kalriven also had a wide smile that did not suit the black knight; he remarked, \u201cI am surprised, to be honest. I never imagined that you would dispose of the holy energy this easily! You are truly fit to be the lord! The Castle of the Dead will be an even more sinister and accursed place from now on! Hehehe!\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s still a long way to go,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.\u201cYou are right; the other seal still has not been released yet.\u201d Kalriven nodded in agreement.\u201cYou mean the seal is still there?\u201d Shaneth asked.Kalriven nodded in response and explained with a serious expression, \u201cThere are two seals in the Castle of the Dead: The holy seal and the seal of the blue frost. The chill that envelops the castle was not created by us undead. That seal was made by Shahren to seal us within the castle. We cannot set a single foot out of this castle unless both seals have been released.\u201dHe then added, \u201cOh, my liege, we still have to carry out the will left behind by Lord Nakron, and that is to turn the corpse of the strongest dragon in the continent into an undead being. We need to conquer a ruin somewhere on this continent for us to fulfill Lord Nakron\u2019s will.\u201dKalriven then prostrated in front of Kang Yoon-Soo and cried out, \u201cOh, my liege, the lord of the undead! I humbly plea for your benevolence; conquer the ruins of ice and spirit to grant us our freedom!\u201d[Legendary Quest\u2014Castle of the Dead]The Death General Kalriven and the undead are sealed in the Castle of the Dead due to the work of Shahren. The undead wish to leave the castle to lend their strength to their new master. Conquer the ruins of ice and spirit located somewhere on the continent to release the undead.*You will obtain the special swordsmanship skills of the Death General Kalriven if you accept the quest.*The quest will fail if someone else conquers the ruin before you.*There is no way of knowing how the released undead will affect the continent.Reward: 7,827 undead freed. Kalriven\u2019s absolute trust. Nakron\u2019s crafting book.It was a request from Kalriven, and it was the highest-tier quest one could receive from the undead, which could not be obtained through ordinary means. In addition, this was the first time a legendary quest\u2019s rewards had actually been written.The rewards for the legendary quest were more than 7,000 undead and the absolute trust of a top-tier undead being. It was an amazing reward, but the difficulty of the legendary quest was definitely going to be high.\u201cOkay.\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo nodded and accepted the quest from Kalriven.The Death General could not hide its joy as Kang Yoon-Soo accepted the legendary quest. Kalriven exclaimed, now speaking in a docile and soft voice, \u201cI will never forget your benevolence! You are our new lord and master!\u201dThe Death General had now pledged absolute loyalty to Kang Yoon-Soo, after he had removed the holy energy from the Castle of the Dead and accepted the legendary quest. Kalriven scanned Kang Yoon-Soo from head to toe before taking out its sword. Shaneth and Henrick jumped up in surprise, but Kang Yoon-Soo was not fazed at all.Kalriven raised its sword and said, \u201cOh, my liege, you are a great being without a doubt, but your strength is still lacking. That is why I wish to provide you with my own swordsmanship. I am certain it will be of help to you in your future travels.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s do that,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied without an ounce of excitement for such a rare opportunity.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Kalriven moved extremely slowly at first, but the Death General changed its mind after seeing Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s swordsmanship. Kalriven increased its speed, and soon all of Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s attacks were being parried by the Death General.However, the only gap that existed between them was one of physical ability, and Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s swordsmanship did not lag behind that of Kalriven. Kalriven, who had been planning to go easy on Kang Yoon-Soo, suddenly began taking the match seriously.Clang!Sparks flew whenever their swords clashed.The only reason they were able to exchange blows despite the overwhelming difference in their levels was obviously because Kalriven was holding back and controlling his strength. However, Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s movements were sharp and precise. Sometimes, he attacked from an unexpected angle and Kalriven had difficulty blocking the attack; at times, he almost landed an attack on the Death General.Kalriven was the first one to lay down its sword after hours of sparring. The Death Knight praised Kang Yoon-Soo with a wide smile that showed its satisfaction at the results of the match. \u201cYou really are worthy of being the lord. You have amazing skills despite your lack of experience. Do not misunderstand, my lord; these are not empty praises.\u201dA purple light flowed out from Kalriven\u2019s sword toward Kang Yoon-Soo, and he absorbed the light.[You have received the Abyssal Sword skills of the Death General Kalriven.][You are the first to receive an undead being\u2019s swordsmanship on the continent.][Your commanding authority over the undead has risen.][Abyssal Sword]Skill Level: Lvl1 (00.00%)Energy Consumption: 20%A sword skill that is one with darkness, unique to the undead. The skill effect will differ based on the undead that gave the skill.*Death General\u2014Apply a critical strike to significantly reduce enemy HP. The critical success rate increases the stronger the enemy is relative to you.Just as magic consumed mana, the use of physical skills like swordsmanship used energy. The Abyssal Sword consumed 20% of the user\u2019s energy, and the user would enter into a state of exhaustion after using it five times. In addition, the sword skill was rather precarious to use due to the fact that the critical success rate increased when the enemy was stronger than the user, which meant it also decreased when the enemy was weaker. Above all, the fact that the skill had been given by a monster stood out; there had been no cases of anyone receiving a skill from monsters, since they were hostile to humans.Kalriven took out a black crystal and gave it to Kang Yoon-Soo, saying, \u201cYou may communicate with us through this black crystal once you release the final seal on the castle.\u201d It continued in a voice filled with expectation and sincerity, \u201cMy lord, we have decided to place our trust in you. We shall wait for the day you release us and allow us to serve you.\u201dThe undead legion prostrated in front of Kang Yoon-Soo and worshiped him upon hearing Kalriven\u2019s words. Kang Yoon-Soo did not bother to give a reply, and merely silently nodded.It was around the time that they crossed the castle drawbridge that Kang Yoon-Soo heard a whisper.\u2018The calamity is fast approaching, and you need to prepare to fight against it.\u2019Kang Yoon-Soo stopped in his tracks as he looked around; it was definitely the same voice that had whispered to him back at the mudgem swamp. It sounded feminine, and its tone was calm and elegant.\u201cAre you alright?\u201d Shaneth asked.\u201cYeah, it\u2019s nothing,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied. He had a bad feeling, but he shook his head and ignored it.***The trio left the Castle of the Dead and returned to the forest after crossing the lake. They turned around to take one last look at the black castle, but it was gone without a trace. The castle had disappeared from their view, just like a mirage.Henrick scratched his cheek and said, \u201cMy, that was a strange experience. It\u2019s as if it were all a dream.\u201d\u201cI thought my heart was going to burst from anxiety. It feels as if it\u2019s been a hundred years since I last saw the sun,\u201d Shaneth said, raising both of her arms to take in the sunlight.Kang Yoon-Soo suddenly stopped in his tracks, extending his hand toward Henrick.\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Henrick asked.\u201cAlcohol,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo answered.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Henrick grumbled as he opened his backpack. His backpack was filled to the brim with the chilling alcohol from the Castle of the Dead, which did not lose its cold even under the hot midday sun.\u201cYou stole it\u2026?\u201d Shaneth asked, her words trailing off.\u201cHey! Who do you think I am? The skeletons gave it to me,\u201d Henrick retorted.\u201cThe undead gave gifts\u2026?\u201d Shaneth exclaimed, her eyes wide.\u201cWhy? There are no boundaries in love, so why would there be any in friendship? A bond made by booze transcends race and age. Well, except for some jerk who steals it in daylight\u2026\u201d Henrick said, glaring at Kang Yoon-Soo.\u201c\u2026\u201d Shaneth stared at him as well.\u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo asked.\u201cDon\u2019t drink too much, it\u2019s not good for your health,\u201d Shaneth said worriedly.\u201cAlcohol is meant to be drunk that way; stop nagging, little miss,\u201d Henrick teased her.The two alcoholics clinked their mugs filled with the chilling alcohol of the undead and merrily walked ahead while drinking. The nagging little miss let out a sigh before following behind them.***Several exhausted-looking men mounted on horses passed through a mountainous area; they were the Third Order of the Imperial Knights. However, they looked so haggard at that moment that nobody would believe they were Imperial Knights.The captain of the knights, Lenox, tied his tired horse to a tree and said, \u201cI know that you are all tired, but I am absolutely certain that our objective lies somewhere here in the Hatar Mountains. We must find that at all costs and fulfill the imperial order.\u201dHe reminded them once again of their mission. The knights nodded in response, but they could not keep their exhaustion from showing on their faces. After all, they were knights and not mountaineers, and there was a limit to turning over every stone in such a vast mountain range with only sixty people.They had been tipped off about a blonde girl going up into the mountains from the village at the foot of the mountain, and they had even found traces of her hiking up the trail. However, even though they searched the mountains for nearly twenty days, they were unable to find any signs of her.A search of this scale would usually be carried out by the imperial army, along with experienced hunters and mountaineers. Unfortunately, they were not able to do so this time around, because they were on a top secret, classified mission for the royal family.The search party was composed of knights, but they had abandoned their armor for this mission and were in plain clothes instead. It was odd for the imperial knights to go to such an extent just to find one girl; they were certain to be a laughingstock for the Republicans if they were seen in their current state.\u201cUmm\u2026 I have a question, though\u2026\u201d A new member, Eric, scratched his cheek as he raised his hand. His seniors glared at him, but he could not hide his curiosity and asked, \u201cWhy were we, the Third Order of the Imperial Knights, mobilized just to find one girl? Not to mention the need for us to be so clandestine. I would like to know the reason why we imperial knights have to go through this just to find a girl.\u201dEric\u2019s seniors glared at him, but they could not hide their curiosity as well. It was difficult for even the imperial knights to be motivated in carrying out their mission if they were not aware of what was going on.Contrary to everyone\u2019s expectations, Lenox hesitantly explained, \u201cFrom what I have heard\u2026 This mission is related to the assassination attempt on the imperial princess.\u201dThe knights were more surprised by the fact that their captain, who was known to be uptight when it came to the rules, had spilled confidential information regarding their mission than the fact that there had been an assassination attempt on the imperial princess.Lenox was from a fallen noble family, and he had managed to climb up the ranks to become the captain of a knight\u2019s order purely by his swordsmanship and intellect. He was a knight who was respected by not only the knights in his order, but other knights as well. The knights would surely have protested by now if it were not for his leadership.However, even Lenox could not feel uneasy about their mission this time. He looked at the road underneath them and thought, \u2018Is this mission really so important as to even divert the trading routes?\u2019The midday sun stared down at the trio.Henrick was the first to speak up, asking, \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d\u201cAbout what?\u201d Shaneth asked.\u201cOur current situation,\u201d Henrick replied.\u201cHmm\u2026 I don\u2019t know\u2026 It is a difficult one, that\u2019s for sure\u2026\u201d Shaneth replied after contemplating for a bit.\u201cIn short, we\u2019re fucked,\u201d Henrick cursed.\u201cPlease watch your language,\u201d Shaneth cautioned him.Sinirant Trade Route was a major route that connected the imperial capital to several other cities. Its stone-paved roads were wide and sturdy enough to sustain the weight of the endless lines of travelers and carriages that passed through. In addition, the roads of Sinirant were famous for being well maintained, to the point that one would not see a single stone sticking out of the pavement.It took the trio ten days to reach the trade route. Their food rations had run out and they were fatigued from their travels. However, the sight before their eyes once they reached their destination was something they never could have imagined\u2014the trade route was completely destroyed.The stones that should have neatly paved the roads were scattered all over the place, and countless shattered fragments littered the area. The roads had so many crevices they were impossible to walk on, and there were no carriages or even any pedestrians in sight.\u201cWhat in the world happened here\u2026?\u201d Shaneth asked, her eyes wide with surprise.\u201cThe strangest thing is that the largest trade route in the continent is in ruins, but there\u2019s not a single soul in sight,\u201d Henrick remarked.Even as the two were completely dumbfounded, Kang Yoon-Soo raised his right hand and pointed toward something. A tiny dot appeared on the horizon, slowly moving toward them. The dot grew larger and larger as it neared them, but it was still tiny nonetheless.When the dot finally reached the party, they saw that it was actually a dwarf with a black beard. He slowly opened his bag and started to pick up the stones one by one.\u201cExcuse me, sir!\u201d Shaneth called out to the middle-aged dwarf.\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d the dwarf replied.\u201cWhat happened here? Where is everybody?\u201d Shaneth asked.\u201cAren\u2019t you guys behind on the news?\u201d the dwarf remarked, stroking his beard. He added, \u201cThis trade route has been closed.\u201d\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d Shaneth asked in disbelief.\u201cBecause of the bandits; they\u2019ve been rampaging in this area these days,\u201d the dwarf replied.\u201cWas it so bad that they had to close the trade route?\u201d Shaneth asked.\u201cHow would I know? Well, to be honest, people have been talking because of this closure. They say the nobles are fighting among themselves, or the empire has the ulterior motive of curbing the powers of the merchant companies. Well, one thing\u2019s for certain; the bandits are just an excuse to close the trade route,\u201d the dwarf explained as he picked up the scattered stones.\u201cMost people have diverted to another route, and the lack of people encouraged the monsters and animals to come out all the way to the road; as you can see, they made a mess out of it. Well, I\u2019m not complaining, because I get to come and get good quality stones for free,\u201d the dwarf explained. He picked up a few more stones before leaving.\u201cWhat should we do now?\u201d Shaneth asked.\u201cDo we even have a choice? We need to return to where we came from and buy a horse, or use another trade route,\u201d Henrick said with a sigh.\u201cWe just wasted our time, then\u2026\u201d Shaneth replied, sighing as well.Kang Yoon-Soo suddenly spoke up. \u201cWe\u2019re not going back.\u201d\u201cEh?\u201d the other two exclaimed.\u201cWe\u2019ll cross the Hatar Mountains,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said, pointing toward the nearby mountain range.The mountain trail was not usually used by people because of the well-developed trade route; thus, the mountain did not even have a proper path to walk on.\u201cYou plan to cross the mountain without a pathfinder? Do you plan to get lost and starve for days?\u201d Henrick asked, looking perplexed.\u201cThis is a shortcut,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo answered.\u201cBut who\u2019ll guide us through it\u2026?\u201d Henrick asked.\u201cI will,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo answered, beginning to walk toward the mountain.Shaneth and Henrick hesitated for a while, looked at each other, and let out sighs at the same time.\u201cWe can trust that guy, right?\u201d Henrick asked.\u201cDidn\u2019t you see what happened at the Castle of the Dead? He\u2019s unpredictable,\u201d Shaneth replied.\u201cIn other words, he\u2019s a madman\u2026\u201d Henrick sighed in resignation.Henrick took out a flame-spitting doll from his summoning box and placed it on the ground. The flame from the doll emitted smoke, which he planned to use as a guide to finding his way back if they ever got lost. He then ran to catch up with Kang Yoon-Soo, grumbling as he trailed behind. \u201cIf only he weren\u2019t doing a legendary quest\u2026\u201d***The Hatar Mountain Range consisted of numerous mountains connected together. While some of the mountain peaks in the range pierced through the clouds, some were low enough to be closer to tall hills. However, the landscape of the mountain range was quite complex, and the fact that it was extremely vast and overgrown did not help with navigating it. In fact, the range had still not been completely mapped out, and there was no map of it available.\u201cKyaah!\u201d Shaneth screamed as she tripped over a tree, but Kang Yoon-Soo easily caught her with one hand. She was in the middle of thanking him when all of a sudden, Henrick screamed from behind them.\u201cGah!\u201d Henrick fell down and was almost buried in a thick thorn bush, but Kang Yoon-Soo caught him as well with the other hand.Shaneth sighed and said, \u201cTrekking across a mountain at night is a very dangerous thing to do.\u201d\u201cI agree; it\u2019s so dark we can\u2019t see what\u2019s right in front of us,\u201d Henrick added, waving his hands in front of him.However, Kang Yoon-Soo did not hesitate even for a moment and confidently walked into the darkness. Oddly enough, he did not even graze a tree branch while walking in the dark.Henrick\u2019s face distorted into a grimace as he grumbled, \u201cWhat the hell is that guy?\u201d\u201cHe isn\u2019t a normal person, that\u2019s for sure\u2026\u201d Shaneth replied.\u201cThen am I traveling with a ghost and not a human? Come to think of it, he doesn\u2019t even get drunk and he has the same expression day and night. He\u2019s definitely closer to a ghost than a human\u2026\u201d Henrick remarked.Kang Yoon-Soo suddenly pointed into the distance, at a crevice on the mountain wall\u2014it was a small cave. \u201cWe\u2019ll make camp here,\u201d he said.\u201cThere aren\u2019t any beasts inside, right?\u201d Henrick asked before picking up a stone and throwing it into the cave.Clack!Luckily, there was no movement or sound from within the cave. The trio entered the cave through its tight entrance, and found that its interior was quite spacious. The interior of the cave was quite warm, and was suitable for them to spend the night.Kang Yoon-Soo scavenged some firewood and lit a fire. Shaneth took out some dried food, and Henrick lay down and started to carve pieces of wood with his sculpting knife. Henrick appeared to just be messing around at first, but he carved three wooden utensils in an instant with only a few movements of his hands.\u201cYour crafting speed is really fast!\u201d Shaneth exclaimed in surprise.\u201cWhat\u2019s the point? It\u2019s nothing compared to that guy,\u201d Henrick grumbled.\u201cNo,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo suddenly said.Henrick\u2019s hands stopped moving when he heard Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s words, and he just looked at the other man. Kang Yoon-Soo silently stared at Henrick, but the way he looked at him was a bit different this time.\u201cI learned how to craft and control puppets from you at one point in time. However, I couldn\u2019t hold a candle to your skills\u2014no matter how much I practiced.\u201dKang Yoon-Soo said several words that made no sense. Henrick had taught him how to craft and control puppets? It had not even been a month since they began traveling together, and Henrick did not recall teaching Kang Yoon-Soo how to do anything in that time.Henrick looked at him with a perplexed expression and replied, \u201cYou mentioned that at the pub last time, but what do you mean by that, exactly? It hasn\u2019t been a month since we first met, but you\u2019re saying that you learned such skills from me? You sound as if you knew me from before\u2026\u201dKang Yoon-Soo fell silent and did not reply further. An awkward silence filled the cave.Shaneth spoke up to change the mood. \u201cCome to think of it, our rations are running out quite quickly. We have no choice but to eat them soon because they might spoil in the backpack. We should\u2019ve bought more dried rations if we knew this was going to happen\u2026\u201dKang Yoon-Soo suddenly stood up after Shaneth voiced her concern, and Shaneth looked at him curiously. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d she asked.\u201cTo get food,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo answered.\u201cCan you find your way back without getting lost?\u201d Shaneth asked just in case, even though she felt the answer would be obvious.\u201cYeah,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.He then exited the cave. It was dark outside, but visibility had never been an issue with him in the first place, to the point that he closed his eyes as he walked. He could find his way just by the sounds of leaves crunching under his steps, the dirt shifting beneath his feet, and the grass dancing in the wind.He walked for quite a distance before thinking to himself, \u2018I have to be careful.\u2019 He had subconsciously blurted out the story regarding Henrick. He had tried to suppress his emotions, but the memories of his previous life had somehow found their way out of his mouth.In fact, Kang Yoon-Soo was well aware of it. He was aware that he could not cope with the changes he had experienced in his regressions, and that he was falling apart. \u2018I shouldn\u2019t think negatively. I have to hold it in\u2026 the same way I did for so long.\u2019He massaged his temple as he walked behind a large boulder. Funnily enough, he came across a wild tusk boar that had its snout in the ground, feasting on a bunch of wild mushrooms it had found. The wild tusk boar was a beast that lived up to its name due to its long, sharp tusks; in fact, its tusks were so sharp that there would be no need to refine them before using them as weapons.Kang Yoon-Soo drew his longsword, stabbing it into the neck of the wild tusk boar. The beast let out an ear-splitting shriek before whimpering in pain. However, Kang Yoon-Soo could, unfortunately, understand the cries of the beast.\u2018Spare me! I have five kids in my burrow! They\u2019ll all die if I don\u2019t return tonight.\u2019Kang Yoon-Soo stabbed the boar with his longsword several times more. The fact that he could understand the beast tormented him, because killing a shrieking beast and killing a talking beast were different issues altogether. For him, there was only a thin line between a human and a monster. He had conversed and hunted alongside monsters in a previous life, and he had formed a bond with them.He bit his lips and told himself, \u2018Don\u2019t think about the past. Focus on this life.\u2019The wild tusk boar stopped breathing, and Kang Yoon-Soo lifted its carcass onto his back before walking back toward the cave.It was only after Kang Yoon-Soo had walked quite some distance that an arrow sharply flew toward him and grazed his cheek; a thin red line of blood formed in its wake.Kang Yoon-Soo looked toward the place the arrow had flown from, and a chilling voice called out from the darkness.\u201cKang Yoon-Soo, how is your thousandth life going?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He was certain that he had not mentioned his regression to anyone in this life. \u2018It doesn\u2019t feel like another hallucination\u2026\u2019 He dropped the wild tusk boar\u2019s carcass and walked toward where the voice had come from.Whiing!A couple more arrows flew past him, but he did not stop moving and easily avoided every one of them. He asked coldly, \u201cWho are you?\u201dHe knew that the assailant was hidden behind a boulder, and he nimbly dashed toward the back of the boulder as he drew his longsword. However, his sword stopped in midair the moment he came face to face with the assailant.\u201cWhy\u2026\u201d he murmured, his voice trembling. He found it hard to hide his surprise as he asked, \u201cWhy are you here?\u201dThe assailant responded, \u201cWhy? Am I not allowed to be here?\u201dSirian smirked at Kang Yoon-Soo.***It was Sirian Lanchecaster, the Corrupted King of All Things, and the strongest human on the continent. However, Kang Yoon-Soo was supposed to meet Sirian at the later stages of the legendary quest; why was he here in the mountain ranges now?Kang Yoon-Soo bit his lips as he tightly gripped his longsword. He said, \u201cYou\u2026 It\u2019s not possible for you to be here right now. You should be guarding the doors of Pandemonium right now\u2026 just as you always did.\u201dSirian slung his longbow onto his shoulder and smirked. \u201cLook here, my emotionless friend. Have you forgotten how you killed me in the \u2018previous world\u2019?\u201d he asked.Kang Yoon-Soo could not help but frown at those words. In the previous world, his 999th life, he was the one who had killed Sirian. However, that had not stopped the war with Pandemonium from breaking out.His thoughts were conflicted as he tried to suppress something welling up from his chest when he suddenly noticed something peculiar. \u201cWhere is Riberion\u2019s Magic Spear? Why are you using something like a bow?\u201d he asked.\u201cWho knows? Maybe you\u2019ll get to know once you get hit by it,\u201d Sirian answered as he drew his bowstring.Kang Yoon-Soo immediately ducked and avoided the arrow, but he figured out the identity of the assailant at the same time. He sighed and said, \u201cI knew it. You aren\u2019t Sirian.\u201dHe charged toward Sirian and swung his longsword. Sirian jumped to the left to avoid the longsword, but Kang Yoon-Soo was a step faster. The longsword swung down in a crescent arc, slicing through Sirian\u2019s body.\u201cKuh!\u201d Sirian\u2019s body was cut in half and turned black. His corpse was no longer recognizable; it looked closer to a pile of charcoal than a human corpse.A doppelganger was a monster that read another\u2019s mind and transformed into something from their thoughts. The Sirian that had appeared in front of Kang Yoon-Soo was just a doppelganger who had read his mind.If the doppelganger truly wanted to shake Kang Yoon-Soo up, it should have transformed into the Demon Lord. However, the Demon Lord was not a being that a lowly creature like itself could dare imitate, which was why it settled for Sirian instead.\u2018Something is strange\u2026\u2019 Kang Yoon-Soo thought. Based on his experience from his hundreds of lives, doppelgangers never left their habitats, and they didn\u2019t live in the Hatar Mountains. \u2018I should be meeting a doppelganger in a few days, but that was a variant and an exception. Why did a doppelganger that shouldn\u2019t be here suddenly appear?\u2019At the very moment he was lost in thought, a whisper teased his ears.\u2018The calamity is almost here. You have to prepare for it.\u2019Who was the one who kept whispering to him? What was the approaching calamity?It had been a very long time since Kang Yoon-Soo had been full of questions he did not know the answer to.***Pitter-patter\u2026 Pitter-patter\u2026The vast mountain range was covered by rain.\u201cHe\u2019s late\u2026\u201d Shaneth muttered, sticking her hand outside the cave. A trail of rainwater fell from between her fingers.\u201cMaybe he\u2019s planning to catch a tiger or something,\u201d Henrick said as he fiddled with his sculpting knife.\u201cHmm\u2026 I\u2019m still getting worried,\u201d Shaneth replied.\u201cDo you really think he\u2019s someone who would get lost?\u201d Henrick grumbled.\u201cIt\u2019s raining\u2026 What if he catches a cold?\u201d Shaneth asked as she looked out of the cave.\u201cWho knows? He seems to be the kind of guy who would be fine even after getting hit by a hailstorm,\u201d Henrick said as he tossed a piece of wood he had been sculpting behind him.\u201cWhat are you so carefully making?\u201d Shaneth asked, tilting her head.\u201cThis and that,\u201d Henrick answered as he took another piece of wood and started to sculpt it. He continued, \u201cBut do you know?\u201d\u201cKnow what?\u201d Shaneth asked.\u201cWhat do you mean \u2018what\u2019? That guy, Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s identity,\u201d Henrick replied as he skillfully and accurately sculpted the piece of wood with only his right hand. He continued, \u201cA youngster like him has knowledge that even an adventurer with decades of experience would never have, and he\u2019s eerily emotionless. I\u2019ve met different kinds of people, but it\u2019s my first time meeting someone as emotionless as that guy. Are all Travelers like that? What the hell is he anyway?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not so sure either\u2026\u201d Shaneth replied. She took a moment to think deeply, before slowly answering, \u201c\u2026but I believe he\u2019ll tell us when the right time comes. He doesn\u2019t answer anything he doesn\u2019t want to answer, but\u2026\u201d She hesitated for a minute before saying adamantly, \u201cHe\u2019s a good person. He\u2019s someone I can trust and depend on.\u201d\u201cOh really? Hmm\u2026 I\u2019ve been wondering for a while now,\u201d Henrick said.\u201cAbout what?\u201d Shaneth asked.\u201cWhy do you trust someone as dense and emotionless as him?\u201d Henrick asked.Shaneth burst out into laughter, but after it subsided, she showed her burn mark and replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know, maybe because he made me pretty?\u201d\u201cHuh? Did he put makeup on you or something?\u201d Henrick asked.\u201cTsk\u2026 I don\u2019t want to talk to you, mister.\u201d Shaneth pouted while sulking. Henrick just let out a small laugh as he went back to his sculpting. Silence filled the cave for a while.Suddenly, Shaneth stood up and shouted, \u201cMister Kang Yoon-Soo!\u201dKang Yoon-Soo was walking toward the cave from afar. He was under the rain without an umbrella, and Shaneth hurriedly ran toward him with a cloth to shelter him from the rain.Then, Kang Yoon-Soo unslung the longbow from his back\u2026Whoosh!Henrick ran toward Shaneth and pushed her down. An arrow narrowly missed her, barely grazing her head. She would have died on the spot if he had been late by a fraction of a second.\u201cHuh\u2026? What\u2019s going on\u2026?\u201d Shaneth asked in confusion. However, Kang Yoon-Soo drew his bowstring once again with his usual cold expression, and another arrow flew toward her.Henrick pulled out his summoning box, but Kang Yoon-Soo suddenly began to speak. \u201cHenrick, you are destined to turn yourself into a puppet by your own hands.\u201dHenrick stiffened for a second. Kang Yoon-Soo quickly drew his bowstring and shot an arrow toward Henrick. However, the rain from the heavens was on Henrick\u2019s side; the droplets of water altered the trajectory of the arrow, and it narrowly flew past his eyes.\u201cWhat are you doing?!\u201d Shaneth screamed at him.Kang Yoon-Soo turned around to face her and said, \u201cShaneth, I will be killing myself.\u201dShaneth\u2019s expression filled with fear, and she started to tremble. Kang Yoon-Soo drew his bowstring once again and let loose another arrow toward her.Whiiing!Pshhk!A sword swung down from above, blocking the arrow and splitting Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s head open. His corpse lay dead on the ground and turned into dust. The man who had swung the sword appeared in front of the two.It was Kang Yoon-Soo.\u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d Henrick exclaimed as he came back to his senses.\u201cA doppelganger imitates one\u2019s worst nightmare,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo answered quietly. He was about to enter the cave when Shaneth suddenly grabbed onto the hem of his shirt.\u201cPlease\u2026 Don\u2019t die\u2026\u201d Shaneth pleaded shakily, trembling beneath the rain. Her breathing was rough, and it was unclear whether the streak of water flowing down her face came from tears or rainwater. She repeated, \u201cPlease don\u2019t die\u2026 Please don\u2019t die in front of me\u2026\u201dKang Yoon-Soo turned around and faced her before hugging her tightly. He said softly, \u201cI won\u2019t die. No matter what happens.\u201d***\u201cSo that was a doppelganger that transformed into you?\u201d Henrick asked.Kang Yoon-Soo silently nodded before adding, \u201cAlthough I\u2019m not sure why such a monster appeared in the mountain.\u201d\u201cHoo, there\u2019s something even you don\u2019t know?\u201d Henrick asked in surprise.\u201cSo, everything was just an illusion from that monster?\u201d Shaneth asked in relief. However, she hugged her chest with trembling hands, seemingly suppressing a fear that would not subside.\u201cI hope to never meet such a monster ever again\u2026\u201d Henrick said with a grimace. Henrick tapped his temple before asking, \u201cBut why are you so calm? It doesn\u2019t sound as if you met that doppelganger.\u201dKang Yoon-Soo was busy butchering the wild tusk boar he had carried back. He sprinkled just the right amount of salt on the meat he got from the carcass. The cave was humid thanks to the rain, so it would be difficult to smoke the meat into jerky, but that would help them preserve the meat for a bit longer. As he silently prepared their rations, Henrick chose to give up on hearing a response from him.\u201cAh, never mind. There\u2019s no way someone like you would even get played by a monster like that. You conned the Death General, after all\u2026\u201d Henrick muttered.However, contrary to Henrick\u2019s assumptions, Kang Yoon-Soo was actually deep in thought. \u2018Something is weird\u2026 Why does it feel as if something is off\u2026?\u2019Kang Yoon-Soo pulled the heart of the wild tusk boar from its carcass with bloody hands.***The trio took turns standing watch as they rested. The sky was still gloomy even after morning came, and they had to trek across the mountain range while getting rained on.Henrick looked up at the sky that was covered with rain clouds and grumbled, \u201cWhen will this damned rain ever end?\u201d\u201cIn four days,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.\u201cI think you would make a killing if you opened a fortune-telling shop\u2026\u201d Shaneth commented.Their dry rations had all run out after they trekked across the mountains for a few days. However, they did not starve to death thanks to the wild tusk boar Kang Yoon-Soo had hunted.On a night they spent camping out in the thickly overgrown forest after four days of exhausting travel, the rain miraculously stopped just as Kang Yoon-Soo had said four days before. Everything in the vicinity was wet, but Kang Yoon-Soo managed to find some dry wood from somewhere.Shaneth was stirring the pot with a ladle, as it was her routine to prepare the food whenever they camped. However, her hands stopped moving and she suddenly asked, \u201cDon\u2019t you hear something?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 42": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Record of a Thousand LivesChapter 43Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayHenrick had just finished carving a wooden bracelet, and he gripped his sculpting knife tightly. Meanwhile, Kang Yoon-Soo relaxed, sipping on the chilling alcohol from the Castle of the Dead.Rustle\u2026Sounds came from within a nearby bush. Shaneth gripped her scythe, expecting something to pop up out of the bush at any moment.Rustle\u2026A long shadow suddenly emerged from the bush. It was a woman with flowing golden hair, who asked, \u201cDo you mind if I join you?\u201dShe was wearing luxurious clothes that could only belong to a noble, and the way she spoke exuded a sense of elegance and authority; in addition, her smooth white skin looked as if it had never been under the midday sun. Her beauty made it difficult not to look at her, and even made the surrounding damp forest look like beautiful scenery.However, Shaneth asked cautiously, \u201cWho might you be?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a thief,\u201d the woman replied.Shaneth furrowed her brow at the woman\u2019s response. \u201cWhat do you mean, a thief?\u201d she asked again.\u201cI\u2019m a thief, since I stole something from someone else,\u201d the woman responded.It was at that moment that Henrick suddenly moved forward and pushed Shaneth\u2019s head down.Shaneth felt as if her neck would snap from the sudden force. \u201cKyah! What are you doing?\u201d she shouted as she looked at him. However, she was surprised to see that the usually carefree and quick-witted Henrick seemed to be more shocked than her.Henrick\u2019s eyes trembled as if he were about to break out in cold sweat at any moment; he knelt down and bowed his head. \u201cI apologize for showing you my shameful self. To think that I would greet the royal princess of the Reorkan Empire, your highness Kisifran, in this lowly place,\u201d he said respectfully in an overly formal tone.Shaneth doubted her ears for a moment. \u2018The royal princess\u2026?\u2019 Did Henrick mean that this blonde woman in front of her was the princess of the empire, the daughter of the emperor?However, Henrick had been the personal artisan of the royal princess at one point in time. It did not seem like a lie, considering how he was behaving so differently from his usual carefree self.Henrick suddenly pushed Shaneth\u2019s head down as she was lost in thought, before hissing, \u201cYou idiot! It\u2019s a sin for a commoner to look at a royal without permission!\u201d\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry!\u201d Shaneth said, immediately lowering her head. However, she was not looking at the royal princess; rather, her gaze went straight to Kang Yoon-Soo.Kang Yoon-Soo did not disappoint, as he did not even bother to bow his head; in fact, he was sitting there nonchalantly while sipping on his chilling alcohol.Princess Kisifran was taken aback by the man. \u201cWhy are you not bowing down to me?\u201d she asked.\u201cI don\u2019t want to,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied with a shrug. The other two\u2019s faces turned blue when they heard his words.Shaneth thought at that moment that she had to steer the conversation in another direction. She exclaimed, \u201cYour royal highness! I am curious as to why a person of your stature is in these lowly mountains?\u201d\u201cI got lost,\u201d the princess replied.\u201cWhat\u2026?\u201d Shaneth was taken aback by the simple reply.Suddenly, Henrick, who had been looking carefully at the royal princess, spoke up. \u201cAre you really her highness?\u201d he asked.\u201cI am, but I am also not,\u201d the princess replied.It was a strange answer, and Henrick\u2019s eyes flashed with suspicion. \u201cForgive my insolence, but may I rise?\u201d he asked.\u201cYou may if you wish,\u201d the princess replied.Henrick slowly stood up as he, the former artisan of the royal princess, carefully examined the princess\u2019 face. He slowly offered the wooden bracelet in his hand toward the princess. \u201cMay you wear this?\u201d he requested.\u201cOf course,\u201d the princess replied, taking the bracelet and putting it on her left wrist.Afterward, Henrick let out a sigh as he said\u2026\u201cIt\u2019s a doppelganger.\u201d***The princess was not surprised, nor did she get angry. The only reaction she showed was a look of curiosity as to why these people were so surprised after seeing her.\u201cWhat do you mean, a doppelganger?\u201d Shaneth asked in surprise.The situation had not made sense in the first place. Why would the royal princess of the empire be wandering around these mountains at this hour?Henrick stared at the princess before saying, \u201cI was surprised at first too, but I\u2019m certain now. I saw her often up close. She had an allergy to elf wood, and she hated seeing any elf wood around her. There was a time when she had an outbreak because of the bracelet made of elf wood I gifted her, and I almost got kicked out of the palace for that.\u201d He pointed at her wrist before adding, \u201cBut look, that bracelet is also made out of elf wood, and she\u2019s fine.\u201dHe now spoke with certainty. \u201cAbove all else, the emperor cherishes the royal princess, and he wouldn\u2019t let Princess Kisifran wander around a place like this.\u201d\u201cB-but\u2026\u201d Shaneth stuttered as she looked intently at the princess.There were no other words to describe the princess\u2019 long eyelashes and exquisite features other than the words \u2018perfect beauty\u2019, but to think that a beauty like her was a monster?Shaneth was confused, asking, \u201cAre you really a doppelganger?\u201d\u201cWell, that is the case from your perspective,\u201d the princess admitted.However, she was different from a normal doppelganger. A doppelganger was a monster that enjoyed attacking its victim both mentally and physically, but the princess in front of them was just standing still. There was also no attempt whatsoever from her to hypnotize or attack them.The princess pointed at the boar heart roasting over the fire and asked, \u201cMay I eat that?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo answered.The princess placed the roasted meat on a wooden plate, and looked around before asking, \u201cWhere are the forks and knives?\u201d\u201cThere are none,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo answered.\u201cThen how am I supposed to eat this?\u201d the doppelganger asked.\u201cWith your hands,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.\u201cI see\u2026\u201d The princess stared at Kang Yoon-Soo for a moment before using her hands to eat the wild tusk boar\u2019s heart. She did not hesitate for a moment, grabbing the food with her bare hand and placing it in her mouth. She definitely looked like royalty on the outside, but the way she smudged soot all over her mouth seemed unnatural for someone of her stature.Shaneth quietly whispered to Henrick, \u201cIf that\u2019s a doppelganger, then why hasn\u2019t she attacked us yet?\u201d\u201cHow would I know?\u201d Henrick replied.\u201cI am a variant,\u201d the princess interjected.The other two jumped in surprise. The princess had heard them even though they were whispering quietly.The princess took another bite out of the heart before explaining, \u201cA normal doppelganger shifts its appearance quite frequently. It also harbors immense animosity toward other creatures, but I am different. I am a mutated doppelganger,\u201d she explained.\u201cI am stuck in the form of Princess Kisifran, and I cannot shift into the forms of other creatures. I cannot read other people\u2019s minds either, but I have a higher intellect than other doppelgangers. Well, there are a lot of other differences between them and me,\u201d she added.\u201cWhy is she speaking as if she were a test subject\u2026?\u201d Shaneth quietly asked.\u201cOh, you figured it out. I am a test subject,\u201d the princess replied.\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Henrick exclaimed, frowning in anger.It was at that moment that some noises emerged from the other side of the forest.Tadak! Tadak! Tadak!It was the sound of hooves, and it sounded as if there were at least twenty horses on the way. The rough voice of a man suddenly filled the air as he shouted, \u201cShe must be around here somewhere! We have to find her and catch her by today!\u201d\u201cI am sorry. If they find you with me, they will kill you all,\u201d the princess suddenly said.\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d Henrick asked with an angry expression.\u201cMy existence is confidential. They will kill anyone who comes across me on this mountain,\u201d the princess explained.\u201cWho are they?\u201d Henrick asked.\u201cThe imperial knights,\u201d the princess replied.\u201cWhich order?\u201d Henrick continued asking.\u201cThe third order, if I recall correctly,\u201d the princess replied.\u201cThe third order? Then Lenox must be their leader, then,\u201d Henrick said, looking surprised.\u201cDo you know him?\u201d Shaneth asked.\u201cI know him, but\u2026 He isn\u2019t someone to be swayed by personal feelings and disobey the empire. He\u2019ll kill me regardless if that\u2019s his mission,\u201d Henrick explained. He glared at the doppelganger before asking, \u201cCan\u2019t we just hand you over?\u201d\u201cI am a confidential secret of the royal family. They will definitely kill anyone who sees me on this mountain; they are loyal to the empire, after all,\u201d the princess responded.\u201cWe\u2019re all dead\u2026\u201d Henrick grumbled. He then started to pack his stuff as he said, \u201cWe have to quickly get away from this doppelganger. The only way we can survive is if we pretend not to have met her.\u201d\u201cBut is it alright if we leave her alone like this\u2026?\u201d Shaneth asked.\u201cDamn it, no matter what the circumstances are, aren\u2019t our lives the most important thing? She\u2019s just a monster anyway; there\u2019s no reason for us to put ourselves in danger just to help her out. Am I right?\u201d Henrick asked as he looked toward Kang Yoon-Soo.Kang Yoon-Soo slowly nodded and answered, \u201cYes.\u201dThe princess\u2019 doppelganger had been one of his companions in his previous life, and her being a variant doppelganger would be a big help in their travels. However, there was no need for them to travel alongside her. She would survive and get stronger one day, and there were just too many things to teach her, because she was still a monster in the end.He stood up and pointed toward the horizon, as he felt that he could at least teach her a way out of her predicament for old times\u2019 sake. He said, \u201cIf you go over this mountain and turn left at the fork in the road\u2026\u201d\u201cYou look exhausted, as expected of someone who has lived for 20,000 years,\u201d the princess said, cutting him off.\u201cWhat? You mean him?\u201d Shaneth asked in surprise.Kang Yoon-Soo, on the other hand, doubted his ears. \u201cWhat?\u201d he asked.However, perhaps because he was far away, Henrick urgently shouted at them, \u201cDon\u2019t you have to run if you want to live? Hurry up!\u201d The group subsequently descended the mountain in a hurry.Afterward, Kang Yoon-Soo went to the princess and whispered, \u201cWhat did you say just now\u2026?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t this your thousandth life? After losing to the Demon Lord hundreds of times, that is,\u201d the princess replied with an innocent look on her face.However, Kang Yoon-Soo was different. His usually expressionless face changed, as a reaction formed on it for the first time. \u201cHow do you know about that\u2026?\u201d he asked.For the thousands of years he had regressed, the doppelganger had never noticed the fact that he had regressed once. In fact, she did not even have the ability to read other people\u2019s minds like a normal doppelganger. How did she know about that?\u201cAnswer me,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said, biting his lips.His tone turned aggressive as he repeated, \u201cI told you to answer me.\u201dThe princess smiled for a moment, but as she was about to answer\u2026The sound of hooves drew closer toward them.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Riding on horseback in wet mountain terrain was not something most would consider a good idea, as most inexperienced riders would end up biting their own tongues or falling from their horses. However, the steeds bred from the imperial stable easily evaded any obstacles, and the riding skills of the imperial knights were astounding.At the forefront, Lenox shouted, \u201cAre you sure you saw that woman?\u201d\u201cYes, sir! She was definitely foraging for wild berries under the rain\u2026 Keheok!\u201d Eric shouted in excitement, but he ended up biting his own tongue.Lenox rubbed the hilt of his sword, then gave a command to the knights. \u201cThat woman is somewhere around here! We will find her today and catch her!\u201dLenox tried his best to encourage the knights that were already exhausted beyond their limits; in addition, their food rations were now dwindling and they could not delay the mission any longer. He chose the best route to take on horseback, and the rest of the knights followed behind him toward the bright campfire light in the distance.Lenox dismounted from his mount and quietly approached the smoldering embers left behind by the campfire. \u201cThere was someone here until just a while ago,\u201d he said as the rest of the knights dismounted and searched the area.One of the knights pointed to the ground and shouted, \u201cThere are footsteps over here!\u201dThe muddy road was still wet and soggy from the rain, and there were clear footprints in the mud.\u201cIt seems the woman we are chasing after has grouped up with other people. They could not have gone far, since they are on foot; should we give chase?\u201dAt the very moment Lenox was about to speak, the darkness surrounding the knights disappeared. Brightness enveloped them and a draft of hot air blew past their cheeks. Their vision became hazy from the heat, and one of them suddenly shouted, \u201cFire!\u201d\u201cDamn it! How could this be?!\u201dThey were caught up in a wildfire that was severely out of place. The forest had still been damp from the rain that had stopped not long before, and it should have been nearly impossible to set the forest ablaze even if one intentionally tried to by pouring oil all over the damp forest.However, the wildfire blazed like a hungry beast that was set on devouring the whole mountain, and it grew stronger as it consumed and felled the trees one by one.\u201cCaptain! What are your orders?!\u201d a knight shouted in a panic.\u201cThere must be a spirit summoner in their group,\u201d Lenox muttered.\u201cHuh?\u201d the knight replied.\u201cNothing. You guys retreat,\u201d Lenox commanded.The knights\u2019 eyes widened in surprise as they asked, \u201cWhat do you plan to do, captain?\u201d\u201cIt is risky for a large group to continue the search in a wildfire like this. I can go through the fire alone. We will rendezvous at the foot of the mountain tomorrow morning,\u201d Lenox said.The knights cried out, refusing to follow his orders.\u201cHow can we leave you alone? We cannot follow that order! I will go with you!\u201d\u201cRight! I will go with you as well!\u201d\u201cAs long as I live by the sword, I will risk my life to carry out the orders of the empire!\u201dHowever, Lenox shook his head as he looked at the knights and said, \u201cI am well aware of your loyalty to the empire, but do not say you will die for the empire.\u201d\u201cHuh? What do you mean by that, captain?\u201d the knights asked in surprise.\u201cYou will understand later,\u201d Lenox responded.The knights clenched their fists tightly, and some of them even teared up. However, all of the knights except for Lenox ended up retreating from the wildfire.Lenox mounted his horse and stroked its mane. It was a horse that had been bred in the royal stable, and was fit for a captain of the imperial knights, but Lenox was not interested in horses and he did not know what breed his mount was. However, everything depended on the horse he was riding on.\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d he said to his horse, spurring it onward.The horse neighed, shooting out like an arrow and charging through the flames, but there were numerous obstacles in the form of fallen trees and burning bushes that blocked their path.It was at that moment that Lenox drew his sword and used a skill. \u201cWind, Bless My Sword.\u201dIt was a high-tier sword skill. Wind gathered on Lenox\u2019s sword, and he instantly destroyed all of the obstacles. The wind that gathered at the edge of his sword not only extinguished the flames, but also blew away all of the burned-down, fallen trees.The flames almost burned Lenox by a hair\u2019s breadth, but he managed to break through the fire without sustaining any injury.\u201cCough! Cough!\u201d Lenox coughed as he looked around at his surroundings.He saw a group of people walking in the distance, and he roughly observed their composition. The group consisted of a woman with a small burn mark, an expressionless young man, a middle-aged man who seemed to be familiar, a girl covered in fire, and a blonde woman.\u2018That guy\u2026 Is that Henrick\u2026?\u2019 Lenox shook his head at the sudden thought; there was no way the personal artisan of the princess, who had retired because of a rare disease that made his body numb, would be in a place like this. Instead, he focused on the girl covered in fire and the blonde woman. \u2018That girl covered in fire must be the spirit that burned the mountain, and that blonde woman must be\u2026\u2019It was quite a distance, but he was able to make out the flowing blonde hair that was characteristic of the imperial royal family\u2014it was the doppelganger of Kisifran, the Royal Princess. The objective of their mission was now in front of him.Lenox was about to steer his mount toward them when a young man started to walk toward him. The young man must have seen him charge through the flames, but he nevertheless approached without showing any hesitation or fear. Oddly enough, the young man had both a sword and a staff in his hands.Lenox drew his sword at the young man and shouted, \u201cStand back! I am the captain of the Third Order of the Imperial Knights, Lenox Hermagen! I am here on imperial orders to transport that woman back to\u2026\u201d\u201cShut up,\u201d the young man said, interrupting him.\u201cIf you don\u2019t step aside\u2026\u201d Lenox warned him nevertheless.\u201cI said shut up.\u201d The young man\u2019s voice sounded cold and angry. Lenox\u2019s expression crumbled when he heard the young man\u2019s words.\u201cI don\u2019t know who you are, but I\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said as he steered his mount toward the young man and drew his sword. As long as the order was given, he was supposed to kill anyone who had witnessed the doppelganger of the royal princess. He charged with his mount at full speed and swung his sword.Shhiik!\u201cHiiiiiing!\u201dThe front leg of Lenox\u2019s mount was chopped off,and he fell to the ground. However, he calmly rolled across the ground and avoided sustaining any damage. Lenox stood up from the muddy ground and glared at the young man with killing intent.His strike just then had been supposed to chop the young man\u2019s head off in one stroke. However, the young man had not even received a scratch, and it seemed like a stroke of luck that the young man had managed to avoid his sword.Lenox was actually greatly surprised by the turn of events, but he remained calm on the outside as he said, \u201cYour luck won\u2019t save you twice.\u201dHowever, he could not help but question the turn of events. Was it really a stroke of luck? A creeping sense of caution caused him to change his approach. He gripped his sword tightly and said, \u201cWind, Bless My Sword.\u201dAn intense wind gathered around the knight captain\u2019s blade. His sword swing sent a blast of wind flying toward the enemy like a typhoon. However, the young man easily avoided his sword.The young man\u2019s movement was not fast, but rather precise. He read the trajectory of Lenox\u2019s sword, lightly stepped aside, and avoided it. It did not matter how hard Lenox swung his sword; he only managed to slash through the air without hitting anything. The young man did not shed a drop of blood as Lenox stood there staring at him, speechless.\u201cWhat the hell are you\u2026?\u201d Lenox muttered.\u201cYou\u2019re making me waste my time,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said. He drew his sword, although his mind was preoccupied with something else.Meanwhile, Lenox was surprised at the sight of the young man\u2019s sword reflecting the moonlight. He tried to follow the trajectory of the young man\u2019s sword swings, but eventually failed, becoming mesmerized by the sword\u2019s arc. The young man\u2019s swordsmanship was sharp and accurate, and could even be called beautiful; it was at a level that only those who had reached an expert level in the sword could recognize.\u201cAh!\u201d Lenox exclaimed as he felt a blunt impact strike his head. His vision darkened in an instant as he collapsed.***Kang Yoon-Soo knocked the captain of the imperial knights out with the hilt of his sword. There was a large difference in their levels, but he had managed to subdue Lenox with only his swordsmanship. He did not show any emotions even after achieving such an amazing feat.He walked back toward his companions, then approached the doppelganger of the royal princess and said, \u201cWe need to talk.\u201d He took her to a secluded place away from the ears of Shaneth and Henrick, then asked, \u201cHow did you know I regressed?\u201d\u201cSomeone inside of me told me,\u201d the doppelganger answered.\u201cWho is that?\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo asked again.\u201cI am not exactly sure, but there is an existence that is sealed within me, and it cannot come out of me. I call that existence the \u2018White Shadow\u2019. The White Shadow is telling me to convey these words to you,\u201d the doppelganger explained. She continued, \u201cYour 1,000th life is the final one. There will be no more regressions.\u201dIt was at that moment that a change that had never existed in Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s past 999 lives occurred.***\u201cCaptain! Are you alright?\u201dLenox heard a voice and felt someone shaking his shoulder. He opened his eyes to find one of his knights looking at him worriedly. He was lying in the exact same spot he had collapsed on the previous night. \u201cI am ashamed,\u201d he said as he stood up, then drank from a water canteen one of his knights passed him.The knights stared at their captain, who had been knocked out cold, but none of them dared to ask what had happened\u2014until Eric asked, \u201cDid you lose the target?\u201dAll of the knights glared at Eric. They were all curious as to what had happened, but they had been feigning ignorance for the sake of their captain.However, Lenox shook his head and said, \u201cIt is not Eric\u2019s fault. It was my mistake; I lost the target.\u201d\u201cTo think that the captain would lose them. The wildfire yesterday must have been really bad,\u201d one knight remarked.\u201cNo, something more terrifying than the wildfire was there,\u201d Lenox replied.\u201cHuh?\u201d the knight exclaimed.Lenox stared at the sword in his trembling hand. What he had seen the previous night was something so unrealistic, he had suspected it to have been a dream. However, his memory was surprisingly clear; he clearly remembered the swordsmanship of that young man.His heart started to beat faster. He was physically stronger than the young man, and he would not have lost so one-sidedly if he had not been mesmerized by his opponent\u2019s swordsmanship. However, the young man\u2019s technique was definitely impressive, and all of his knowledge regarding the sword had changed overnight. He thought, \u2018It was the first time I saw such swordsmanship from anyone other than the 1st Order\u2019s captain.\u2019Lenox stood up from his spot, then pointed at Eric and asked, \u201cCan I borrow your horse?\u201dEric looked touched by his words and answered with a salute, \u201cYes, sir!\u201d\u201cI apologize, but you will have to ride behind another knight,\u201d Lenox added. He mounted the horse and gripped the reins, and the knights followed suit as they mounted their horses.Lenox then shouted, commanding the knights, \u201cThey must not have gone far! We will chase after the target once again! The target has joined with other people! Be especially careful of the expressionless Traveler!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 44": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Record of a Thousand LivesChapter 45Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayKang Yoon-Soo walked at the forefront, jumping lightly over fallen trees and bushes. However, his head was filled with other thoughts.\u2018Your 1,000th life is the final one. There will be no more regressions.\u2019He contemplated whether those words were telling the truth, but he decided there was no reason to be suspicious of them. Several doppelgangers had suddenly appeared in the mountains when they were not supposed to, and the doppelganger of the princess knew about his regression as well. However, what was the \u2019calamity\u2019 the whisper had kept bringing up?In any case, only one thing was certain now: Something new had happened in his endlessly repeating life.A storm of complicated thoughts brewed in his head. He had given it his all across his hundreds of regressions. He had fought until the point when he could no longer feel the pain in his hands, he had turned himself into a combat doll to not feel pain at all, and he had even learned the strange languages of the beasts. That was how he had become a supernatural being who had lived for more than 20,000 years.He had reached the pinnacle of every class, and tried his best to kill the Demon Lord to stop the endlessly repetitive cycle\u2014to save his loved ones and the world. But, he could not deny that he had been complacent from time to time, thinking that there would still be another life if he failed in this one.\u2018The Demon Lord got weaker as I regressed, and that made me complacent.\u2019However, there were no more regressions, and his only sanctuary was gone.\u2018This is really my last life\u2026\u2019\u201cExcuse me? Are you alright?\u201d Shaneth asked from behind him.That was when Kang Yoon-Soo realized that they were miles off course; they had passed the intended destinations hours ago while he was lost in thought.The place they had entered was filled with freshly-bloomed purple flowers, and he looked around before saying, \u201cLet\u2019s rest.\u201d\u201cYou should\u2019ve said so earlier,\u201d Henrick complained, collapsing onto the ground. It was natural for him to be exhausted, as they had been walking nonstop since the previous night. Even Shaneth was sitting on the ground massaging her tired legs.Kang Yoon-Soo walked toward the doppelganger and said, \u201cLet\u2019s talk.\u201dThe doppelganger of the princess slowly nodded and followed him. Shaneth looked at the two with suspicion, but she did not say anything and simply watched silently.Once they walked far enough away that the others would not be able to hear them, Kang Yoon-Soo asked, \u201cThe thing inside you, the White Shadow, was it? For how long has it been inside you?\u201d\u201cThe White Shadow entered my body after I was born,\u201d the doppelganger answered.\u201cDo you know what it is?\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo asked.\u201cI am unsure; the White Shadow is relatively silent\u2026\u201d the doppelganger replied.Kang Yoon-Soo continued asking, \u201cThe White Shadow inside of you, when and how often does it whisper?\u201d\u201cIt is usually quiet. It sits alone in a corner of my mind by itself, and it does not respond to anything I say,\u201d the doppelganger answered.\u201cWhy do you call that thing the \u2018White Shadow\u2019?\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo inquired.\u201cBecause it felt like something that should not exist in this world,\u201d the doppelganger replied. Kang Yoon-Soo could not understand her words.The doppelganger looked at Kang Yoon-Soo inquisitively as she said, \u201cBut it was different when it saw you. It spoke to me of its own volition for the first time, even though I did not talk to it. The White Shadow seems to be very interested in you.\u201d\u201cHow about now?\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo asked.\u201cIt is quiet,\u201d the doppelganger replied.\u201cHow can I believe that I can no longer regress?\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo pushed on with his questions.\u201cThe White Shadow said that it knows you very well. It knew the lives you lived as a mass murderer that murdered thousands, your life as a Grand Alchemist, your life as the King of the Monsters, and your other lives as well,\u201d the doppelganger answered.A being Kang Yoon-Soo had never met during his repetitive regression knew about him very well, and that gave credibility to its warning that he would not regress anymore.He had not planned to get involved with the doppelganger in this life, but it was the White Shadow that resided within the doppelganger that had brought about a change in his repetitive life; that was one absolute reason she needed to travel with him.Kang Yoon-Soo made his decision. \u201cYou will be traveling with me from now on. However, you must tell me immediately if the White Shadow tells you anything,\u201d he told the doppelganger.\u201cWhat is the reason?\u201d the doppelganger asked.\u201cWhat reason?\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.\u201cThe reason that I have to travel with you,\u201d the doppelganger clarified.Kang Yoon-Soo recalled receiving the same question from the doppelganger in the past, and he remembered answering her a certain way. As such, he said, \u201cIf you travel with me, I will give you a name.\u201dThe doppelganger tilted her head in confusion and answered, \u201cA name? I am a doppelganger; I do not need one.\u201d\u201cYou will have your own identity. You will no longer be just a doppelganger of the princess,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.The doppelganger stared at Kang Yoon-Soo in confusion and said, \u201cI am a nameless monster. Are you saying that you will give me a name?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo answered with a nod.The doppelganger asked, \u201cIf you were to give me a name, what would it be?\u201dKang Yoon-Soo looked around before pointing at a purple flower and saying, \u201cIris.\u201dIris was the English name of that purple flower, and it symbolized\u2026\u2018Good news,\u2019 Kang Yoon-Soo thought to himself.But was it really\u2026?***\u201cWhat a sight, giving names to doppelgangers and all. Did you say you wanted to take her along? Do you plan to get killed by the imperial knights?\u201d Henrick asked, frowning.However, Kang Yoon-Soo shook his head and answered, \u201cWe\u2019ll definitely need her help to complete the legendary quest.\u201dIn truth, they would be able to complete the legendary quest even without her help. It was a quest he had finished countless times until he got sick of it, after all. However, he needed an excuse to travel with Iris.Shaneth suddenly glared at him inquisitively and asked, \u201cAren\u2019t you just making this up to have an excuse to travel with her?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.Shaneth was surprisingly agitated today. She asked, \u201cWhy is the doppelganger of the princess even in a place like this?\u201d\u201cThe purpose of my existence is the assassination of the princess,\u201d Iris answered.The words that came out of her mouth were shocking. Henrick and Shaneth were stunned into silence; it was unbelievable to think that someone would attempt to assassinate the princess of the Reorkan Empire.Iris plucked a flower out of the muddy ground and licked its stamen. Henrick looked dazedly at her strangely seductive-looking action before he came back to his senses and asked, \u201cAssassination of the princess? What do you mean by that?\u201dIris explained, \u201cThere are people in the royal palace that are plotting to assassinate the princess, and they captured doppelgangers to carry out experiments. Hundreds of doppelgangers were sacrificed in their experiments, but one variant was born. A variant that was similar to the princess in every way possible, and a doppelganger who could not morph into anything other than the princess\u2014I am that variant.\u201dHenrick\u2019s expression was filled with disbelief. Shaneth could not help but ask in surprise, \u201cWhy did they go to that extent just to make a doppelganger of the princess?\u201d\u201cIt was to kill the princess and replace her with another one. So that no one would notice the death of the princess,\u201d Iris replied, swallowing the petals of the flower she was licking.Henrick was filled with disbelief at the shocking news and could not maintain his composure. Shaneth was the one who asked in his stead, \u201cThen how did that doppelganger, who was so important to their plans, end up here?\u201d\u201cI learned many things. The movements and mannerisms of the princess were things I had to be aware of in order to not get caught, but I was frustrated. I wanted to know more about myself. That was why I escaped from the place I was locked up in. I used my powers, which even they were not aware of,\u201d Iris explained while she plucked more flowers out of the muddy ground. She threw away the petals this time, licking the flower stamen like a lollipop. She then added, \u201cI escaped, but they gave chase with men wielding swords, and they even destroyed the large road.\u201d\u201cLarge road? You mean the Sinirant Trade Route?\u201d Shaneth asked.Iris nodded in response. \u201cThe people who were after me did not wish for me to mingle with other people,\u201d she explained.Shaneth and Henrick looked at each other, their eyes wide with shock. The reason the trade route was in shambles was that the soldiers had wanted to catch one doppelganger?Henrick scratched his head angrily and said, \u201cThis is driving me nuts. This\u2026 We got involved in a secret of the royal family. This is really dangerous\u2026 I\u2019m definitely sure that there are greater powers involved in this, if they were able to secretly capture doppelgangers to run tests on them\u2026\u201d He hesitated for a moment, then asked Iris, \u201cDo you know who did that to you?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t. They always covered my eyes when they ran those tests,\u201d Iris answered.\u201cHow did we get caught up in a secret of the royal family that turned this into such a dangerous journey\u2026\u201d Shaneth grumbled with a gloomy expression.Henrick suddenly complained angrily, shouting, \u201cDamn it! First it was an undead castle, and now it\u2019s the secret of the royal family. I don\u2019t think anything else can surprise me at this point!\u201d\u201cBears will ambush us,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said as he drew his sword.\u201cWhat did you say, punk?\u201d Henrick growled at him.The location had changed, but Kang Yoon-Soo was sure that a bear was going to charge at them around this time based on his previous experience. He reiterated, \u201cI said, bears will ambush us.\u201dShaneth and Henrick followed Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s gaze toward a certain location, and they saw the shadows of several beasts fall over the bushes.The black bears of Hatar Mountains had front paws more vicious-looking than those of other wild beasts, and their thick hides made them quite intimidating. To think that the place they were standing in just then was inhabited by those same black bears.The black bears looked toward them and growled viciously. \u201cGruuuuuuo!\u201dThe largest black bear violently charged toward them, but Kang Yoon-Soo simultaneously charged toward it as he swung his sword. His head was filled with other thoughts even as he entered combat. If this life was the last one\u2026 If it really was the last one\u2026\u201cAbyssal Sword,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo muttered. The tip of his blade was enveloped in a bluish glow as the skill activated. He swung his blade at the black bear with great strength.Sukeok!\u201cGruuuuo!\u201dThe terrifying swordsmanship of the undead devoured the black bear\u2019s life force. A fountain of blood spurted out whenever a critical strike hit it, and the overflowing blood gushed toward Kang Yoon-Soo as if it were going to swallow him.\u2018I have to change everything. I have to use every single scrap of knowledge I have to change things,\u2019 he thought to himself.\u2018I have to throw away my complacency. I have to grow stronger even if it means getting hurt or risking my life.\u2019 His conviction in this life changed, and his indifference toward life started to crack bit by bit.Thick blood vessels bulged out of his hand as he swung his sword toward another black bear.\u2018Intensely, more intensely than ever before, I have to kill the Demon Lord this time around.\u2019Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s lifeless and expressionless eyes slowly started to fill with some sort of will to live.Their plans were going to change from now on.Starting from tonight.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 45": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Record of a Thousand LivesChapter 46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe moment Kang Yoon-Soo gained his newfound resolve, a black bear charged toward him. He leaned on his back foot for a second before sprinting toward the charging black bear and swinging his sword. His blade cleanly severed the bear\u2019s neck; the attack was completely different from his usual movements.\u201cGrrrruuuoo!\u201dSeveral bears roared as they emerged from the bushes. The black bears of the Hatar Mountains were infamous not only for their viciousness, but also for the thick hides that managed to protect them from most attacks.The other members of the party prepared to enter combat. Shaneth tightly gripped her Death Scythe, while Henrick pulled out five wooden swordsman dolls from his summoning box. However, Iris remained calmly seated in place.Henrick screamed angrily at the doppelganger\u2019s nonchalant display, \u201cYou idiot! The black bears are approaching us; what are you doing sitting there?!\u201dIris, on the other hand, tilted her head in confusion as if she could not understand why he was getting so worked up. She said, \u201cA princess does not participate in combat. It is quite rare for a royal to join a battle.\u201d\u201cThen run far away or something!\u201d Henrick shouted. He was about to swear at the doppelganger when a black bear suddenly charged toward him.Kwachik!A wooden swordsman doll in front clashed with one of the black bears. Half of the doll\u2019s upper body was blown away by the black bear, but Henrick immediately reacted by moving his mana threads. Then, the remaining four wooden swordsman dolls immediately surrounded the black bear and simultaneously stabbed it.However, the dolls\u2019 swords were not able to penetrate deep enough, and their shallow thrusts were not enough to stop it from rampaging. They had to target vital points such as the neck or the heart to quickly end the battle.Sukeok!Shaneth swung her Death Scythe with all her might toward a black bear, and the black bear responded by swinging its paw at the scythe.Clang!An immense impact shook her hands when her scythe clashed with the bear\u2019s paws, and the impact felt as if she had struck a large boulder. She swung her scythe downward to create distance between herself and the black bear she was facing, then took the opportunity to use her skill. \u201cFire Strike!\u201dIt was the skill she had received after she changed into the Ignus Warrior class. Five fire orbs appeared around her Death Scythe. She swung her scythe in a wide sweep, and the fire orbs flew toward the black bear. As they came into contact with the bear, the orbs detonated into a massive explosion.Boom!\u201cKuuuek!\u201dSome of the black bears standing several meters away from the main target of the fire orbs were caught in the explosion as well, and they roared in agony as their bodies were set ablaze.Shaneth\u2019s combat prowess had gone up several times over after changing her class into the Ignus Warrior. The increase in her combat capabilities was not the only change that had happened, however. In addition, the mistakes she had made in past battles were no longer present, and her scythe did not tremble one bit even after prolonged combat. It was all thanks to the special trait of the Ignus Warrior class that increased her muscle strength, vitality, and weapon mastery.\u201cThe flowers here are pretty,\u201d Iris said calmly.She was strolling leisurely around the flower field while the others were engaged in an intense battle, and her expression looked quite peaceful despite the ongoing battle, as if it were being fought in another dimension separate from hers.Kang Yoon-Soo walked toward her after striking down a black bear. The bears\u2019 blood, dripping down the tip of his longsword, painted the flowers red. He went over his memories. He needed to increase Iris\u2019 combat capabilities if she were to travel with them.\u201cDon\u2019t sit around. You\u2019re not the princess,\u201d he said.Iris replied with an innocent expression, \u201cIf I am not the princess, then what am I?\u201d\u201cYou are you,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo answered.\u201cA doppelganger does not have its own identity,\u201d Iris explained as she lightly held a flower she had picked off the ground. Despite her loose grip, the flower crumbled into dust, and she picked another flower before continuing, \u201cIf I do not imitate, what else can I do?\u201d\u201cMake a new you,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo answered.At the very moment that Iris stood up from her spot, Shaneth screamed hurriedly, \u201cWatch out!\u201dThree black bears charged together at Kang Yoon-Soo and Iris, but Kang Yoon-Soo was just standing there without even unsheathing his sword. At the moment that one bear\u2019s front paw was about to strike Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s face, Iris stood up and swung her right arm.Kwachik!The three black bears were swept off the ground and away from them as if a sudden wave had swept them away; \u2018swept away\u2019 was the only way to describe what had happened just then.Shaneth and Henrick could not believe what just happened; a pair of long, thick tusks had grown out of Iris\u2019 right arm.\u201c\u2026!\u201d they exclaimed. The tusks looked like something they had seen before. They had an eerie resemblance to the tusks of the wild tusk boar they had eaten last night.[The doppelganger has opened herself up to another for the first time.][She is the first doppelganger that has made a resolve to find her true self.][The hidden ability of the doppelganger race, \u2018Predation\u2019, has been unlocked.][The doppelganger will absorb the stats and physical abilities of an enemy whenever she consumes their heart.][The previous ability will disappear if a new ability is absorbed.][Consuming the heart of an identical creature will not enhance the absorbed ability.][Consuming different species will help the doppelganger grow faster.][The doppelganger\u2019s ability absorption efficiency will increase the more hearts she consumes.][*This message is only visible to the one the doppelganger opened herself up to.]Iris\u2019 new skill, Predation, allowed her to absorb the ability of the wild tusk boar after eating its heart the previous night. She could not morph her entire body, but she had gained the ability to change a portion of her body in the absorbed ability.She was now much stronger than a normal doppelganger. She did not have the ability to completely shapeshift, but her ability to absorb the abilities of another creature through her \u2018Predation\u2019 ability was an ability that could not be found in any other monster.Iris gently touched the boar tusk that had grown out of her right arm. \u201cThis thing called battle is such a mysterious thing\u2026\u201d she murmured.\u201cAs if!\u201d Henrick retorted with a haggard look.The strength of a doppelganger was far greater than that of an average human. It was her first battle, but Iris efficiently disposed of her enemies by swinging her tusk-covered right arm, killing one black bear after another.All of the black bears were now taken care of. The ground was dyed red with their blood, and the surroundings were littered with their corpses.Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s level went up by two, and he was now Level 90. He dug his longsword into the corpse of a black bear and took its heart out. He threw the raw heart to Iris, saying, \u201cEat it.\u201d\u201cWhy do I have to eat this?\u201d Iris asked.\u201cSo you will be useful in combat,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied coldly.Iris did not bat an eye as she consumed the raw heart, which gave off a severe fishy stench.[Iris has consumed the heart of a vicious black bear.][Iris\u2019 strength has increased.]Iris smiled in satisfaction. \u201cIt is really delicious; much better than eating it cooked,\u201d she said as she devoured the raw heart like a baby suckling on their mother\u2019s teat.She stopped eating for a moment as she stared at Kang Yoon-Soo, asking, \u201cCan I have a taste of your heart too?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.\u201cAh\u2026 That\u2019s a shame\u2026\u201d Iris muttered, as she really regretted it.Shaneth did not even have the energy to speak, staring dazedly at Iris because of the unbelievable words she had just heard.Afterward, Kang Yoon-Soo raised the black bears as undead, muttering, \u201cMass Raise Dead.\u201dThe dead black bears were resurrected as undead at Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s command, becoming Zombie Black Bears. The Zombie Black Bears had pitch-black eyes, and they drooled constantly as if they could devour the living at any moment.Kang Yoon-Soo sent the undead to the summon dimension.[52 Zombie Black Bears have been sent to the summon dimension.][Summons currently stored in the dimension: 52 Zombie Black Bears, White, Sally.][Remaining space for additional summons: 646.]***Kang Yoon-Soo and his party entered an old abandoned cabin in the mountains that seemed to have been used by the mountain keeper. It was quite cramped inside, but it worked as an overnight shelter, and they decided to spend the night inside.The exhausted Shaneth fell asleep immediately, and Henrick started to snore not long after he closed his eyes. However, Iris just continued staring at the night sky.\u201cThe night is quite pretty. I hope I can reach the sky one day,\u201d Iris said as she stretched her hand toward the sky.Kang Yoon-Soo looked at Iris for a moment before extending his right hand and saying, \u201cSummon Sally.\u201dFlames spun in midair and a beautiful young girl emerged from them. Sally stared at Iris for a moment before skipping toward her. This was not their first meeting, as they had previously met when Sally set fire to the mountain, but they had not had the luxury to get acquainted at that time.\u201cWow! A pretty unni[1]!\u201d Sally exclaimed, looking at Iris with sparkling eyes.\u201cYou are a beautiful child too,\u201d Iris responded.\u201cReally? Do you mean it?\u201d Sally asked excitedly, and her sparkling eyes grew even larger.Iris nodded, smiling as she answered, \u201cReally.\u201d\u201cWow! I love you!\u201d Sally exclaimed as she jumped and hugged Iris.Iris stared curiously at the child before grasping her cheeks and pinching them. \u201cOuch!\u201d Sally screamed.Iris immediately let go when she heard Sally scream in pain, then tilted her head sideways and licked Sally\u2019s cheek.Sally looked innocently at Iris before putting her lips on Iris\u2019 cheeks as well. \u201cMy name is Sally! What\u2019s your name, unni?\u201d she asked with an innocent look.\u201cMy name is Iris,\u201d Iris replied as she stroked Sally\u2019s fiery orange hair. She looked at Sally with warm, gentle eyes before reiterating, \u201cYou really are a beautiful child.\u201d\u201cUnni is pretty too! Do you want to play with me?\u201d Sally asked.\u201cIf you wish to, let us play,\u201d Iris answered, nodding.Sally smiled widely before hugging Iris again. She exclaimed excitedly, \u201cHurray! Sally was really bored! What does Iris unni want to play with Sally?\u201d\u201cMay I taste your heart?\u201d Iris asked with a smile on her face.\u201cWaaa! Papa!\u201d Sally cried out as she clung to Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s waist. She sniffled and said, \u201cPapa! Papa! That unni is scary!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s play,\u201d Iris said, approaching Sally with a smile.\u201cWaaaah!\u201d Sally cried out.\u201cI won\u2019t make you a sibling if you cry,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo coldly threatened Sally.\u201cWaa\u2026 sniff!\u201d Sally sobbed.Sally was left alone with Iris in the abandoned cabin\u2026It was when everyone fell asleep that Kang Yoon-Soo left the cabin alone. He trekked along the mountain trail as he closed his eyes and reminisced about the past. \u2018This mountain was my world, and I was its owner, when I lived as a ranger and a mountaineer back then.\u2019He recalled everything about the Hatar Mountains. The lost sword of the previous emperor was stuck in the ground beneath the river flowing through the mountain gorge, the gold mine of the dwarves was tucked away beneath the foot of the mountain, and the Herb of Eternal Youth grew on the second mountain peak from the west.Kang Yoon-Soo jogged his memories a bit more. The lost sword of the previous emperor had very good attributes, but it was too damaged and would require a great amount of mithril just to repair; the gold mine of the dwarves would make one the richest person on the continent, but one would incur the wrath of the gold dragon; and the Herb of Eternal Youth would significantly increase one\u2019s life force, but reduce one\u2019s lifespan by a proportional amount.Of course, if he took the time to collect all of them one by one, they would be great assets. However, it was just a waste of time. There were plenty of hidden treasures and secrets that he was well aware of.\u2018There\u2019s no need to waste time in these mountains just to get those,\u2019 Kang Yoon-Soo thought to himself.Kang Yoon-Soo stopped walking and looked at a wooden palisade in front of him. The laughter of mountain bandits rang out from the other side of the wooden palisade. A bandit who was standing watch drew his sword, pointing it toward Kang Yoon-Soo as he exclaimed, \u201cHalt! Who goes there?\u201dKang Yoon-Soo slowly walked toward the bandit on watch, then pierced the bandit\u2019s neck. The bandit died with his eyes wide open, unable to believe that Kang Yoon-Soo could kill him so easily without a word.[You have killed the vicious bandit Greenwell.][Your notoriety will not increase, as you have killed a criminal.][You may receive a bounty as a reward if you go to the investigators.][You have obtained additional experience points for killing a member of the same race.][Your level has increased by 1.]This was the method he had chosen to grow stronger in the shortest time possible. The Crossed Swords Bandits were an infamous and vicious criminal gang that used the Hatar Mountains as their headquarters. He would be able to obtain a significant amount of experience points if he wiped them out, and the bandit leader had a rare magic sword on him.However, it was impossible for even Kang Yoon-Soo to face that many bandits alone. It had not been in his plan to get rid of the bandits originally, but he did not have a choice now, as he needed to get stronger faster.Kang Yoon-Soo slowly closed his eyes to jog his memories, pondering which Kang Yoon-Soo of which life he needed to be that day. He slowly opened his eyes after a short while, having chosen which one of his previous lives he had decided to imitate\u2014his tenth life.He had been a ruthless predator in his tenth life, murdering countless people and committing countless atrocities.Now, that version of Kang Yoon-Soo was walking into the bandits\u2019 base within the wooden palisade, having turned into the most vicious murderer on the continent.1.

    "Chapter 46": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Record of a Thousand LivesChapter 47Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe Crossed Swords Bandits were no different from any other bandits. The main activities of most mountain bandits were stealing, killing, looting, and raping; they would commit countless atrocities before retreating back into the safety provided by the mountains. However, the Crossed Swords Bandits were the most vicious and atrocious bandit band among all of the mountain bandits in the Hatar Mountains.As their base was tucked away in a secluded part of the mountain, most of their members were hardened criminals who had committed at least one or two murders, and some of them had even killed their families because of inheritance disputes.A large bandit entered a tent made of buffalo leather. \u201cBoss, I bring good news,\u201d he said as he greeted his boss.The boss of the Crossed Swords Bandits was a bandit called Arkan; he was the largest and most vicious bandit in the Hatar Mountains. Arkan looked at the bandit with a gaze full of interest, setting down the expensive wine he had been about to drink on the table. He asked, \u201cWhat is it, Akon?\u201d\u201cOur scouts have spotted two women in the mountains,\u201d Akon reported.\u201cWomen? In these secluded parts of the mountain?\u201d Arkan asked suspiciously.\u201cAh, boss\u2026 Don\u2019t you remember? They said something about closing the Sinirant Trade Route because of bandits or something, and because of that a few mindless fools have been found trying to cross through the mountains,\u201d Akon said with a grin on his face.\u201cWhere were they spotted?\u201d Arkan asked, tapping his finger on the table.\u201cDown there in the abandoned cabin. Although that place is the habitat of the black bears; maybe the bears went to hibernate or something, but the women seemed to be fine,\u201d Akon explained.\u201cSo, were the women pretty?\u201d Arkan asked.\u201cThe scouts couldn\u2019t see because they were too far away,\u201d Akon answered.\u201cWell, it doesn\u2019t matter as long as they\u2019re women,\u201d Arkan said with a shrug.\u201cOf course,\u201d Akon responded.\u201cThat\u2019s great news; my nether region has been itching these days,\u201d Arkan said as he corked the wine bottle and tied his swords to his waist.The two bandits left the tent; the area around it was filled with bandits that were either getting drunk or gambling. Akon walked beside Arkan with a large, sleazy grin on his face and said, \u201cI\u2019ve been surrounded by smelly men for quite a while now. Our \u2018harvest\u2019 was reduced when they blocked the trade route, right? Hehe\u2026 I can\u2019t wait to have a taste of those women.\u201dThe Crossed Swords Bandits were a large organization, and they were miles apart from the other bandits, who committed crimes because of poverty. While average bandits targeted passing carriages or merchant convoys, the Crossed Swords Bandits targeted villages or the merchant companies themselves.The Crossed Swords Bandits boasted a massive 300 members, and they could be considered as a small army composed of murderers, thieves, and rapists. Committing crimes was as easy as breathing for them; the bandits would find it easier to use a sword than a fork. Some of them were well equipped with rare items they had stolen from others, and there were even magicians mixed into their group. The minimum notoriety among them was 30, and even the investigators would not dare face them alone.Their base was located on the highest hill among the mountain ranges, and a dike blocked the waters of the nearby river to create an artificial lake.\u201cDid you remember to check the dike today as well?\u201d Arkan asked.\u201cAh, boss! What are you so worried about? I\u2019ve asked the boys to reinforce it and I\u2019ve stationed a guard to watch over it as well. Don\u2019t worry!\u201d Akon answered.\u201cThe dike can be our weapon or our poison,\u201d Arkan remarked.\u201cWho doesn\u2019t know that?\u201d Akon responded, annoyed.The dike was something they had prepared in the event that the investigators or the imperial army came after them; it could trigger a massive landslide that would sweep away everything in its way if the dike were released.\u201cIt\u2019s been quite a while since we moved here, come to think of it\u2026\u201d Arkan said, feeling nostalgic.\u201cYes, boss; isn\u2019t it about time we moved our base? Our income from the trade route has dwindled as well\u2026\u201d Akon added.Arkan started to rub his long beard and asked, \u201cShall we go to the capital next?\u201d\u201cHuh? The capital? Can we even hold off the investigators there?\u201d Akon replied, tilting his head.Arkan shook his head and remarked, \u201cThe Black Tiger Clan is there, right?\u201dAkon exclaimed, \u201cAh! That clan that\u2019s been getting famous these days?\u201d\u201cI heard they\u2019ve been growing in size after collaborating with a merchant company to smuggle drugs,\u201d Arkan said, still rubbing his long beard.Akon scratched his head, which he had not washed in a while, and said, \u201cI don\u2019t like it there. I agree that they\u2019re big, have a lot of connections, and are resourceful, but their boss is a Traveler, right?\u201d\u201cSo what if it\u2019s a Traveler?\u201d Arkan asked.\u201cThere\u2019s no problem with it, but I just don\u2019t feel good about it\u2026\u201d Akon explained as he blew off some dust that had accumulated on the tip of his sword. He added, \u201cI don\u2019t like those Travelers. They showed up here from another world and started ordering us around as if we were their slaves. Some of them even chase after monsters all day as if they\u2019ve gone nuts. They seem like a bunch of lunatics who can\u2019t sit still.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026 I agree with that,\u201d Arkan said, nodding.Arkan was a cruel and violent leader, but he was level-headed and calculating as well. It was thanks to his leadership that the Crossed Swords Bandits had been able to stay under the radar of the investigators all this time.Akon added, \u201cWell, it\u2019s not as if I have something against the Black Tiger Clan. Our food and alcohol supplies are dwindling. Although the mountains are safe, it\u2019s difficult to kill people and find women here.\u201d\u201cI agree. We can strike it big if we go to the capital,\u201d Arkan said as he stopped rubbing his long beard. He reached the center of the bandit base and shouted in a loud, booming voice, \u201cEveryone, gather!\u201dAll of the bandits that had been leisurely hanging around suddenly stood up and gathered in front of Arkan. All of them had cross-shaped scars on their cheeks. The cross-shaped scar was the symbol of the Crossed Swords Bandits; they were not scars they had received from battle, but rather ones they had obtained by cutting themselves with daggers.Arkan put his hand behind his back and exclaimed, \u201cWe\u2019re going to hunt for some women! Let me see the hands of those who want to go.\u201dAlmost all of the bandits raised their hands, but Arkan chose ten bandits from among the hundreds of volunteers. There were some bandits who had the sick fetish of killing the women before they even managed to bring them back to their camp, and Arkan had to exclude those from the get-go. The ones that were not chosen by Arkan sulked in disappointment.It was at the moment that Arkan was about to descend the mountain with the chosen volunteers\u2026\u201cGuoh!\u201d A small scream rang out in the distance, and it seemed to have come from the bandit base.Arkan, Akon, and the other bandits looked at each other in confusion as a river of blood started to flow down the mountain.Akon shrieked in surprise, exclaiming, \u201cDamn! Was there a red river around here?!\u201d\u201cNone that I know of,\u201d a bandit replied.Akon said, \u201cThen that means some bastard ambushed our base.\u201dStrangely, they were not that surprised at the thought of their colleagues getting killed. These people were not the type to feel any compassion or camaraderie in the first place.Arkan gripped his large sword and said, \u201cI guess we need to go and give him a cross-shaped scar on his cheek.\u201d***Kang Yoon-Soo went into the base of the Crossed Swords Bandits and saw a group of bandits gambling around the campfire with some dice. He crushed the head of the bandit nearest to him, and the bandit did not even have the time to scream as he fell forward, dead. The other bandits did not even drop their cards as they stared, dumbfounded. Kang Yoon-Soo swung his Staff of Lightning even before any of the bandits could pick their weapons up, saying, \u201cRelease Lightning.\u201dBzzt! Bzzzt!The mana that gathered around the staff exploded into a flash of intense lightning as it spread around the area, and the twenty bandits near Kang Yoon-Soo were roasted in an instant.Several other bandits showed up with their weapons after hearing the sound of the explosion, exclaiming, \u201cWho the hell are you?!\u201d However, Kang Yoon-Soo did not bother to answer them.The bandits numbered around 300, and it was a number that was nearly impossible for Kang Yoon-Soo to fight against alone. Additionally, he had never had the experience of facing these bandits alone, and therefore, he was not aware of their attack patterns.He had the option of calling his undead army, but he decided against it, as it would reduce the experience points he would get. Instead, he recalled his tenth life, the life he had lived as a mass murderer. In that life, there was even a time when he had assassinated a whole army by himself.The bandits encircled him and drew their weapons. However, due to the terrain of their base, all three hundred of them could not pounce on Kang Yoon-Soo at once. Still, tens of bandits charged toward him simultaneously.Kang Yoon-Soo avoided the blade of the bandit in front and cut down the one immediately behind; his longsword easily split open the bandit\u2019s skull. He then immediately swung his staff toward his left side to block an incoming sword. Then, as five blades targeted his back at the same time, he called out, \u201cRelease Lightning.\u201dBzzt! Bzzzt!Lightning roared across the terrain like a dragon and burned the bandits up. However, a few of the quick-witted bandits immediately retreated just in time to avoid the attack. Release Lightning was a skill Kang Yoon-Soo could only use four times a day, and he had already used up two of the charges.A bandit started to laugh, exclaiming, \u201cI don\u2019t know who the hell you are, but did you think you were the only one who could use magic?!\u201d That bandit was holding a long staff, and he pointed toward Kang Yoon-Soo as he shouted, \u201cFire Vortex!\u201dA stream of fire shot toward Kang Yoon-Soo, and he ducked to avoid the fire. However, he did not stop swinging his sword even while avoiding the fire attack; he stabbed one bandit in the neck and another through the mouth.An arrow fired by a bandit grazed past Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s ear. He felt a sharp pain as if he had sustained a burn, and a small amount of blood flowed down his ear. However, Kang Yoon-Soo did not even grimace in pain as he continuously swung his sword, and five bandits instantly died by his hand.[You have killed 44 vicious criminals in a short amount of time.][It is an achievement that even a veteran assassin would be proud of.][The new skill, \u2018Dance of Death\u2019, has been created.][Dance of Death]Skill Level: Lvl1 (00.00%)A skill developed for the sole purpose of murder. Its effectiveness will greatly increase if you are facing multiple enemies alone, but will decrease if you are fighting with a party.Kang Yoon-Soo had killed so many people just then that he gained a hidden skill. Dance of Death was a skill he had frequently used during his time as a mass murderer, and it was the most suitable skill to use in his current predicament. As such, he immediately called out, \u201cDance of Death.\u201dThe speed of Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s sword greatly increased; it seemed to be all over the place at first, but if one looked closely, one would be able to see that its movements were very efficient. He cut down seven bandits in one fell swoop.[The skill level of \u2018Dance of Death\u2019 has increased.][Your critical rate will increase if you swing your weapon with killing intent.][The skill level of \u2018Dance of Death\u2019 has increased.][The speed of your blade will increase if you are facing more than one enemy.]\u201cGuok!\u201d\u201cDamn it!\u201d120 bandits died by Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s hand in an instant, but no matter how many he killed, they kept coming wave after wave. Kang Yoon-Soo swung his sword and staff to spread lightning bolts in multiple directions, but they still charged toward him unceasingly.At the moment when Kang Yoon-Soo stabbed a bandit in the eye, a spear pierced through that bandit and stabbed him in the stomach.Puuuk!Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s stomach turned red and blood flowed out from it. The bandit who had stabbed him was laughing despite the fact that he had attacked through the corpse of his comrade. However, Kang Yoon-Soo stabbed his sword into the laughing bandit\u2019s mouth and ripped it apart.\u201cUwaak!\u201dKang Yoon-Soo said, \u201cLife Drain.\u201d[You have absorbed the life force of the bandit Rikewir.][You have absorbed the special trait of the Bandit class.][Your chance of getting caught while stealing will be reduced for 2 hours.]Kang Yoon-Soo had restored a bit of his life force by using Life Drain, but the pain still persisted. The skill had only managed to patch up the injury and stop the bleeding. His forehead was covered in cold sweat as he thought to himself, \u2018More. I have to do more.\u2019***Arkan and the bandits stopped their descent down the mountain and climbed back up. It did not take them long to reach the top, as they were well-versed in the mountain\u2019s topography. Even so, the bandits\u2019 screams did not stop while they were ascending the mountain.\u201cUwaaak!\u201d\u201cHelp me!\u201dThat was when they realized that something had gone seriously wrong. There were far more screams coming from their base than they had initially expected, and even though they were just criminals, they were seasoned and hardened through their own experience. They were not people who would easily be done in.Akon bit his lips and exclaimed, \u201cDamn it, what the hell is this?! Did the imperial army come or something?!\u201cI don\u2019t know. We just have to hurry and find out,\u201d Arkan replied, quickening his pace. The other bandits followed suit and moved faster.By the time they finally reached their base, the air was filled with the stench of blood, and the ground was littered with corpses that seemed to have been burned by lightning, and other corpses with some of their body parts missing.The three-hundred-man strong bandit base had been annihilated, and a man covered in blood was standing alone in the center. His black hair was dyed red with blood, and his expression was as cold and hard as a stone statue.The bandits were suddenly filled with fear. Even if one were used to killing other people, how could he remain so expressionless? The man was so void of any expression, it was as if he did not even consider his victims human beings.A single person was the source of so much terror, and that single person was the one who had annihilated the Crossed Swords Bandits\u2014alone.Akon asked in a trembling voice, \u201cWhat the hell are you?\u201d\u201cAlcohol,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.\u201cWhat?\u201d Akon exclaimed.Kang Yoon-Soo pointed at Arkan\u2019s waist. Tied around it was a luxurious wine that Arkan had not even taken a single sip of. He said in a cold voice void of any emotions, \u201cGive me alcohol.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If the man had given a plausible reason for the slaughter, he would have felt fear at the least and not anger, but he could not help but grind his teeth upon hearing the man\u2019s words. He asked angrily, \u201cYou ambushed us just for booze?!\u201dKang Yoon-Soo was silent and did not reply to Akon. Instead, he slowly got up and started to rummage through the bandit corpses. He found rare swords, magic staves, and accessories with special effects among them; it was actually surprising to see such rare items on mountain bandits. He stored the higher-quality items in his dimensional bag.The fact that Kang Yoon-Soo did not bother to respond and was only rummaging through the corpses as if he were a grave robber pissed Akon off. He ground his teeth and yelled angrily, \u201cYou must have a death wish, you punk!\u201d He charged toward Kang Yoon-Soo, swinging his sword toward the man\u2019s back.Kang Yoon-Soo instantly turned his body around\u2014it was an amazingly fast movement. He instantaneously drew his sword and slashed at Akon\u2019s neck.\u201cKuheok!\u201dAkon was surprised by the sudden wound appearing on his neck and immediately tried to retreat. However, Kang Yoon-Soo showed no hesitation in his subsequent actions. He was not surprised by the sudden ambush from Akon at all; instead, he swung his sword numerous times and cut Akon up.\u201cAck!\u201d Akon let out a scream after receiving several critical hits and died on the spot.Kang Yoon-Soo did not even look at the dead body as he looked toward Arkan. He said once again in a cold, emotionless tone, \u201cGive me alcohol.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll give it to you if you want it, but you\u2019ll have to get it over my dead body,\u201d Arkan responded, his voice full of malice.The leader of the Crossed Swords Bandits pulled out a dazzling sword. Arkan\u2019s sword was a magic item enveloped in a red aura that had a special ability. The other bandits followed suit and readied their weapons as well.Kang Yoon-Soo looked at them with eyes void of any interest. He could easily take care of the other bandits, but Arkan was a different story. Arkan was not someone he could easily handle at this point in time.He had met Arkan a few times in the past. Arkan was not only quite high-leveled, but his modest-looking equipment was also actually high-quality equipment. Not to mention the fact that the sword Arkan was using was a magic sword; any sword bearing an enchantment was a precious item with astronomical value.On the other hand, while Kang Yoon-Soo did his best not to show it, he was in a severely exhausted state, and the wound he had suffered previously had caused him immense pain. To be frank, he was in no state to duel with someone.Perhaps Arkan was able to gauge Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s current state, as he looked toward Kang Yoon-Soo before saying, \u201cYou might be strong, but you don\u2019t seem to be that high-leveled. I\u2019m certain you\u2019re exhausted after facing three hundred men.\u201dThe boss of the Crossed Swords Bandits started to walk toward Kang Yoon-Soo with eyes filled with anger. He growled, \u201cYou\u2019ll pay a heavy price for making a mess out of my organization.\u201dKang Yoon-Soo started trying to think of a strategy. Arkan was not a knight, so he could not use the tactic of confusing his opponent by using imperial swordsmanship. He could not use the corpses of the bandits and turn them into undead because the skill \u2018Mass Raise Dead\u2019 required 100% of his maximum mana, and the Staff of Lightning had consumed most of his mana.He only had fifty-two Zombie Black Bears in his summoned dimension, and he considered summoning them to fight against Arkan. \u2018Should I summon White?\u2019 he thought to himself.While Kang Yoon-Soo was deep in thought, Arkan\u2019s sword suddenly appeared in front of his nose. Arkan was about to stab Kang Yoon-Soo in the face with a fierce strike when suddenly\u2026Clang!A sword appeared in front of Kang Yoon-Soo and easily parried Arkan\u2019s attack. It was a movement that most swordsmen could not dream of performing unless they were experts.A man on horseback glared down at Arkan. \u201cIt has been a while, Arkan,\u201d he said.Arkan furrowed his brow when he saw the man and called out, \u201cLenox!\u201d***Kang Yoon-Soo looked alternately between the bandit, Arkan, and the knight, Lenox. He had been aware that the two were acquainted based on memories from his past life, and that bought him time to think of a strategy.Lenox withdrew his sword as he glared at Arkan and said, \u201cI heard the rumors that you escaped from prison after raping Lady Kirnell when we were apprentice knights. I never imagined we would be meeting again in a place like this, Arkan.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s for me to say,\u201d Arkan growled.The sound of numerous hooves closed in on them as the knights who followed Lenox showed up as well. Lenox and his knights had found their way to the bandit base after hearing the numerous screams coming from it.Meanwhile, a violent ripple started to form in the lake closed off by the dike.\u201cWhat on earth\u2026?!\u201d\u201cWhat happened here?\u201dThe knights could not hide their shock as they looked at the corpses littering the area, and the newbie Eric threw up at the sight of the dead bodies strewn across the ground.Lenox looked at the blood-covered Kang Yoon-Soo and asked, \u201cDid you kill these bandits?\u201d\u201cYeah,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.\u201cIt is not for me to say this, but I am impressed,\u201d Lenox said.\u201cThey\u2019re all violent criminals. My notoriety didn\u2019t increase,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo muttered.Lenox let out a sigh in response before turning to Arkan and said, \u201cI have something to ask this man; I suggest you turn back.\u201d\u201cYour haughty, authoritative attitude hasn\u2019t changed one bit. Do you remember me as someone who followed every single one of your orders?\u201d Arkan growled.The knight and the bandit started to exude an immense amount of killing intent toward each other.Knight and Bandit were polar opposite classes; they were usually considered to be each other\u2019s mortal nemesis. Knights received a penalty for dishonorable actions that went against their oaths to their masters; they placed importance on honor not just because of their conscience, but because it directly affected their combat ability. Meanwhile, Bandits received more buffs the more they lied, stole, and killed. However, they could not live stable lives like Knights, and had to live under the radar of investigators. It was obvious that there would be an intense animosity between the two classes due to their differences.Lenox pointed his sword toward Arkan and said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to shed meaningless blood and waste my time. What do you think of settling this in a duel?\u201dThe bandits started laughing at the noble yet ignorant suggestion made by the knight, and Arkan could not help but laugh at Lenox\u2019s words. If there was anyone who would suggest an honorable duel with a bandit, that person would definitely be Lenox.However, Arkan nodded in agreement and said, \u201cAlright. It\u2019s been quite a while since I last saw your swordsmanship anyway. No one could win against you when we were training back then.\u201dLenox dismounted and slowly walked toward Arkan, and Arkan drew his sword and did the same. The bandits and the knights encircled the two as if making a makeshift arena. Kang Yoon-Soo was the only one who did not seem to be interested in their duel. Instead, he was staring at the dike that was holding back the lake water.There was no judge to decide the victor and no referee to signal the start of the duel, but Lenox and Arkan looked at each other before instinctively charging at each other simultaneously. Sparks flew all over as their swords clashed.Clang!It was just the first blow they had exchanged, but they both felt intense recoil from their attacks. They both jumped back the moment they felt the recoil in their hands. One exchange was enough to show them how they had grown over the years.The two activated their skills at the same time.\u201cWind, Bless My Sword.\u201d\u201cBloodlust Sword!\u201dThey both charged at one another with their skills the second time, and Lenox\u2019s dazzling swordsmanship clashed against Arkan\u2019s violent swordsmanship while Arkan\u2019s magic sword continuously spewed out explosions.The sound of their swords clashing began to resemble a requiem foreshadowing one of their deaths, and their battle started to escalate to another level that most of the spectators found difficult to follow with their eyes. The bandits were especially not used to such a level of combat, and they only stood there stupefied at what was unfolding before their eyes.However, the situation seemed to be in Lenox\u2019s favor. The knight was not equipped with luxurious or outstanding equipment, but he was one-sidedly dominating the bandit. Arkan fell backward after one final strike. Lenox put his sword on the bandit\u2019s neck and said, \u201cYou seem to have grown lazy, Arkan. Your sword and your body are slow.\u201d\u201cDo you really think so?\u201d Arkan retorted with a smirk.One of the bandits standing in the encirclement suddenly threw a dagger toward Lenox, and Lenox swung his sword to block it. Arkan did not miss the opportunity, as he dashed forward and stabbed Lenox in the abdomen. Lenox managed to twist his body at the last second, however, which saved him from receiving a fatal blow.\u201cCaptain!\u201d the knights called out.Lenox staggered back as his face turned pale. Arkan licked the blood off his sword as he cackled and exclaimed, \u201cThe coward always wins in the end!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201dThe one who spoke was none other than Kang Yoon-Soo. He slowly stood up, having come up with a plan to kill the bandits. He stretched out his right hand and said, \u201cSummon White.\u201d\u201cGrrrrruo!\u201d A werewolf with snow-white fur appeared. The onlookers were surprised by the beast\u2019s sudden appearance, but Kang Yoon-Soo did not pay any heed to them as he climbed on top of White.White bolted forward at an incredible speed with Kang Yoon-Soo riding atop him; they almost rammed into Arkan, but narrowly avoided him and instead climbed up the mountain. They moved at a frighteningly fast speed that neither the bandits nor the knights could react to. Of course, there was no way even a horse could catch up to a werewolf even if they tried.\u201cStop,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo ordered, and White came to a sudden halt.A bandit suddenly shouted, his eyes wide open in shock, \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 That\u2019s the dike keeping the lake water in!\u201dKang Yoon-Soo was standing in front of the dike on top of the mountain that held back the lake water. It was the trump card the bandits had prepared against enemies who climbed up the mountain. The dike was held together by sturdy ropes; Kang Yoon-Soo swung his longsword, cutting those ropes apart.Pukeok!The dike started to fall apart, and a stream of water began to flow out of it. Not only the bandits, but also the knights, watched in horror at the sight of the water slowly flowing through the dike.Arkan screamed, his face red with anger, \u201cWhat are you doing?! A massive landslide will be triggered if that dike breaks!\u201d\u201cI know,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied as he swung his longsword once again. It was only a swing of his sword, but the dike started to tremble even more, and even more water started to push its way out of the dike.The people below Kang Yoon-Soo finally realized the gravity of the situation as they started to shout and scramble.\u201cDamn it! What happened to the ones guarding the dike?!\u201d\u201cThey all died to that guy!\u201d\u201cRun! Run if you want to live!\u201d\u201cEscort the captain! We will leave this place at once!\u201dThe knights quickly mounted their horses and quickly rode away. However, the bandits did not have any horses to escape on. The bandits ran with all their might, but it was nowhere near enough to escape from the torrent of water about to come crashing down the mountain.\u201cGrrrruuuo!\u201d White roared.Kang Yoon-Soo slashed at the last rope keeping the dike together. The dike shattered and a torrent of water roared out from the lake like a waterfall. The water swept away everything in its path, and the bandits were no exception.\u201cAck! He\u2026 l\u2026 p\u2026 m\u2026\u201dThe bandits could not even properly let out screams as the water swept them up. Even Arkan, who had managed to flee the farthest among the bandits, was swept up by the torrent of water.Arkan glared at Kang Yoon-Soo while he was being swept up. Suddenly, he noticed that the expensive wine on his waist was no longer there. However, he was already buried beneath the water and mud by the time he realized that.The dike had been designed to let the water sweep away only the area beneath the bandit base, but since Kang Yoon-Soo had abruptly destroyed it, the water swallowed everything in its path\u2014including the bandit base.Kang Yoon-Soo calmly watched the sight while sitting on top of White, and a message popped up on his wrist device.[You have triggered a massive landslide in the Hatar Mountains.][The only victims were violent criminals; therefore, your notoriety will not increase.][Today\u2019s event, where a huge amount of criminals were swept away by a landslide, will be recorded in history.]The area beneath Kang Yoon-Soo had suddenly turned into a vast lake. The landslide had managed to fully annihilate the bandits and prevent any more pursuit from the knights.Kang Yoon-Soo opened the expensive wine bottle and drank while enjoying the scene of destruction beneath him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He had been Level 90 just a few days before, but he had gained an absurd 47 levels in less than a day.One could truly call it \u2018powerleveling\u2019. However, leveling ridiculously fast like that was only possible at such a low-level stage, as it became significantly difficult to increase one\u2019s level after one reached Level 200\u2014unless one managed to kill a strong monster that gave an even more massive amount of experience points.\u2018I should distribute my stat points first,\u2019 he thought. He pondered for a moment which stats he should increase; as he had invested all of his points into strength and regeneration, his other stats were significantly weaker.He had not planned to increase any of the other stats, thinking he would not be running into any dangerous situations as he only had to avoid them using the experience from his previous life. However, it was different in this life.He had resolved to choose the most difficult path that required him to risk his life this time, and thus concluded that even if he displayed amazing martial skills and summoned absurdly strong undead, it was no use if his body was weak and could not take any hits. Therefore, Kang Yoon-Soo evenly distributed the remaining points into strength, tenacity, and regeneration.\u2018Leveling isn\u2019t the only important thing. I have to obtain all the secrets, weapons, and treasure hidden on this continent,\u201d he thought.\u201cGrrrrrr\u2026\u201d White growled as he approached and licked Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s bloodied cheek.If someone were to witness that sight, they would think a pet was licking its owner as a sign of affection. However, a werewolf licking the blood off one\u2019s cheek was a sign of unwavering loyalty. The bloodsoaked Kang Yoon-Soo looked like an honorable warrior in White\u2019s eyes, and White growled in the werewolf language, \u201cRakuronin. Okan.\u201dKang Yoon-Soo understood what it meant: \u201cI respect you, human.\u201d It was actually ironic that a werewolf respected him after he had killed humans.He was about to send White back to the summon dimension when he suddenly stopped. \u2018This is the last time\u2026\u2019 he thought.He was deep in thought for a moment, but eventually decided to do something different this time. He took out a wooden mug from his bag, saying, \u201cTake it.\u201d\u201cIkironid?\u201d White growled in surprise as it took the wooden mug. It was awkward for White, who was used to crawling on the ground on all fours, to suddenly receive and hold a mug in its paw.Kang Yoon-Soo generously poured the expensive wine into White\u2019s mug and said, \u201cDrink it.\u201dWhite dipped its large tongue into the wooden mug before scrunching its face up and growling, \u201cKarugradin?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the taste of alcohol,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied, He then added, \u201cThanks for tonight.\u201dAll of White\u2019s fur suddenly stood on end.***Kang Yoon-Soo sent White back to the summon dimension, then trekked down the mountain trail that was now a wet, muddy mess thanks to the landslide he had triggered. The bandits\u2019 corpses floated on the surface of water that was tinted with a hint of red due to the sheer amount of blood mixed into it. He scooped some of the water up with his hand and proceeded to wash the blood off his body.Suddenly, however, he noticed a familiar face on a corpse\u2014it was Arkan. Arkan\u2019s body had been severely disfigured after it was hit by the landslide, and his cold, lifeless body was floating downstream. Kang Yoon-Soo jumped into the muddy water and fished out the corpse. Arkan\u2019s armor was in bad shape because of the landslide, but his other items were still in relatively good shape.[Slaughterer\u2019s Bloodsword]Rating: RareAttack Power: 74A sword imbued with evil magic. It is said that a vampire dipped this sword in its own blood. This sword will suck the life force out of any living thing it penetrates like a parasite.* The sword will suck the blood out of any living thing you cut.* The sword\u2019s attack power will increase the more blood it consumes.[Stolen Ruby Ring]Rating: NormalA ring that belonged to a young noble, which has a large, tempting ruby embedded in it. The crest of the Okanic Family is engraved on the back of it.[Bandit Leader\u2019s Belt]Rating: NormalThe belt of Arkan, the leader of the Crossed Swords Bandits. It has six slots that carry different kinds of items.* The chances of successfully looting a village or a merchant company will increase.Kang Yoon-Soo equipped Arkan\u2019s items, except for the Slaughterer\u2019s Bloodsword. The Slaughterer\u2019s Bloodsword was an excellent magic sword, but Ravian\u2019s Longsword was an equally excellent item as well. Regardless, he stored the Slaughterer\u2019s Bloodsword into his backpack for future use.He even took the armor that had been severely damaged by the landslide. It was a brigandine[1] made from sturdy leather, and he planned to repair it or break it down at a smithy eventually.There were other items that belonged to the other dead bandits, but he decided to only equip the good ones and store the rest in the backpack. He continued his descent down the mountain.***The dark clouds that covered the sky retreated, and sunlight shone down on the mountain ranges.Yawn!Shaneth stretched after waking up. She had been unable to sleep properly because of the noisy landslide that had been triggered the previous night. Unlike her, however, Iris was fast asleep while hugging Sally. Sally\u2019s expression showed her discontent with being hugged by Iris, but Iris was smiling while fast asleep, as if she were a baby holding on to a teddy bear doll.Shaneth seemed to have completely misunderstood the situation; she laughed and said, \u201cIt seems these two have gotten pretty close with each other.\u201dIt had not been long since she first met Iris, but it was strange that despite knowing the fact that Iris was a doppelganger, Shaneth did not feel any hostility toward her, nor did she find it uncomfortable to travel alongside Iris. She actually thought of Iris as innocent, like a baby who did not know the ways of this world, and that made her feel sympathy and a sense of similarity to the doppelganger.\u2018But still\u2026 I don\u2019t like it when I see Iris with that guy\u2026\u2019 Shaneth was shocked by her own thoughts, and ran out of the run-down cabin to clear her mind. However, what greeted her outside was a middle-aged man, who looked as if he had rolled around in the mud all night and was fast asleep on the muddy floor.ZzZzz\u2026 Snore!She lightly jumped over Henrick and went over to take a look at the surrounding scenery. The areas had massively changed overnight, and the only thing in front of her was absolute destruction. \u2018If we were a bit closer, we would have been swept up as well\u2026\u2019 she thought.The mountain across theirs had been destroyed by a landslide. They were safe because they were quite a distance away from that mountain, but the sheer thought of it sent chills down her spine as she thought, \u2018If we decided to stay the night over there\u2026 We would have been swept up.\u2019However, something more shocking happened next.\u201cBut why are you coming down from there\u2026?\u201d Shaneth muttered, her eyes wide with surprise as she saw Kang Yoon-Soo slowly walk toward the run-down cabin, walking across the devastation caused by the landslide.Kang Yoon-Soo did not give her any reply, but Shaneth noticed that his attire was different. She also noticed the fact that his movements were duller than usual. She asked worriedly, \u201cAre you alright? Did you get hurt anywhere?\u201dShaneth was surprisingly sharp; Kang Yoon-Soo tried not to reply, but he abruptly stopped walking as he suddenly remembered, \u2018Right, this is the last time\u2026\u2019 He turned around and looked at Shaneth before answering, \u201cI tripped.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re lying, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Shaneth replied.\u201cYes\u2026\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo muttered.Shaneth let out a sigh before bringing her backpack over. She took out a healing potion from her bag and said, \u201cI figured we would need these later, so I saved some. Show me your wound.\u201d\u201cI can do it alone,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.\u201cWill you keep being stubborn?\u201d Shaneth rebuked him.Kang Yoon-Soo eventually submitted to her and took his shirt off; the penetrating trauma[2] on his abdomen was still present. The bleeding had already stopped, but it was still a dangerous wound that cut to the muscle.Shaneth bit her lips and asked, \u201cWhen did you get hurt?\u201dKang Yoon-Soo would not have answered her normally, but surprisingly, he replied, \u201cI fought with the mountain bandits.\u201d\u201cAlone?\u201d Shaneth asked.\u201cYes,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied. Shaneth\u2019s expression instantly turned cold, and she remained silent for a while. Even Kang Yoon-Soo stayed silent as an awkward silence filled the air, leaving only the sound of flowing water.At last, Shaneth opened her mouth and asked, \u201cWhy did you go alone?\u201dKang Yoon-Soo could not provide an answer. Seeing his silence, Shaneth raised her voice and exclaimed, \u201cWhy won\u2019t you give me an explanation?!\u201d Anger filling her voice, she continued, \u201cI can help too! There\u2019s no reason for you to bear all the burden alone. Aren\u2019t we traveling together? I even inherited the power fragment, didn\u2019t I? I don\u2019t mind it being dangerous as long as I can be with you!\u201dShaneth\u2019s voice started to grow louder, as if all of her pent-up emotions had finally exploded, and there was a hint of resentment mixed in with her anger as she continued, \u201cYou aren\u2019t a doll, are you? Let\u2019s laugh together when we laugh, and let\u2019s cry together when we cry. Let\u2019s go through things together if things get tough. We\u2019re companions, right? We\u2019re traveling together. If things get too much for you, feel free to ask for help. I\u2019ll do anything as long as I can be with you. There\u2019s no reason for you to sacrifice yourself and bear it all.\u201dTears started welling up in Shaneth\u2019s eyes, but Kang Yoon-Soo only watched her cry. Then, he saw his reflection in her eyes\u2014his own emotionless, doll-like self. Could he still consider himself a human?Kang Yoon-Soo slowly, hesitantly said, \u201cI was scared.\u201d He was not aware of the words he had just said. It had been far too long since he had last been able to speak the words stuck deep in his chest.\u201cI was scared you would die,\u201d he repeated. He resented the fact that this would be the last time. If he failed again this time, he would no longer be able to see his companions, and above all else, he would not be able to see Shaneth again.\u201cI won\u2019t die,\u201d Shaneth said with firm resolve. She dipped her finger in the healing potion, her eyes still filled with tears, and she traced her finger across Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s wound. \u201cI won\u2019t die, so don\u2019t you die either,\u201d she muttered.The grievous wound started to slowly close up, and the pain slowly subsided. Kang Yoon-Soo stared at Shaneth, but before he knew it, his cold lips suddenly warmed up.The woman who manipulated fire had stolen the lips of the man colder than anyone else.Shaneth trembled lightly as she kept her eyes closed; Kang Yoon-Soo could feel her trembling through her lips. However, Kang Yoon-Soo gently wrapped his hand around the back of her head, and Shaneth opened her eyes in surprise.Kang Yoon-Soo then saw his reflection in Shaneth\u2019s eyes. Would he be able to finally find the life he had been longing for?He could no longer be indifferent toward life. Not in this thousandth life\u2026\u2026Because this would be the last one.***Having woken up quite a while later, Henrick remarked as he looked over the mountain that was devastated by the landslide, \u201cI guess all sorts of things happened overnight. Well, at least those knights won\u2019t be able to chase after us anymore.\u201d He then looked at Shaneth, whose face was cherry red, and asked while raising an eyebrow, \u201cDid something happen? Why is your face so red?\u201dShaneth hurriedly looked away, and Iris, who was looking at her, giggled as she played with the wings of a beetle. \u201cI guess there\u2019s one more person I have to take care of,\u201d she said.\u201cHuh? Why are you speaking as if you ever took care of me?\u201d Henrick protested.\u201cThen stop drinking,\u201d Shaneth retorted. She then walked behind Iris, and Iris looked at her curiously. Shaneth gently smiled at her and said, \u201cLet me tie your hair up.\u201dIris had a beautiful face, but it was her long blonde hair that would attract more attention. She was the doppelganger of the princess, after all, and nothing good would come from standing out in a crowd.Shaneth tied up Iris\u2019 blonde hair with a light-colored cloth, then took the doppelganger into the woods and helped her change into a clean set of clothes.Afterward, Iris looked like a country girl. She looked so natural that she would fit right into a crowd. However, her innate beauty could not be hidden by the cloth holding back her hair and the new set of clothes she was wearing.\u201cThank you,\u201d Iris said, kissing Shaneth\u2019s cheek with her pink lips. Shaneth jumped in surprise at the sudden show of affection; Iris stared at her in confusion, saying as she tilted her head, \u201cI saw that the child called Sally greeted you like this.\u201dHenrick could not hide his disbelief toward the sight in front of him and exclaimed, \u201cWhat the\u2026 Is she a child mimicking her parents? I guess I have to mind my words and actions from now on\u2026\u201dShaneth grasped Iris\u2019 hands and firmly told her, \u201cDon\u2019t kiss someone\u2019s cheek unless you\u2019re very close to and intimate with that person. Ah, don\u2019t do this especially to Mr. Kang Yoon-Soo, do you understand?\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026 This is complicated,\u201d Iris said, falling deep into thought as she furrowed her brow. Even that expression could also be called beautiful.\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said from ahead of the others as he lifted his backpack.The group started their descent down the Hatar Mountains.1. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigandine \u261c2.

    "Chapter 49": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Record of a Thousand LivesChapter 50Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe long and winding mountain range was coming to an end; the overgrown trees towering above them soon ended as well. A large city was visible from the end of the mountain trail the party had walked on.The city was huge; none of the other cities they had visited on their journey could come close to the grand size of the one in front of them. The towering walls had numerous spires guarding them, and the city itself was filled with multiple rows of buildings.They had reached Deferon, the capital of the Reorkan Empire. Deferon was the largest city on the continent, and the towering spires guarding the heart of the Empire from above the city walls greatly elevated its majesty.Shaneth was stunned by Deferon\u2019s grandeur and stared at it with wide eyes. She exclaimed excitedly with a sparkle in her eyes, \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing place! We arrived much earlier than planned, didn\u2019t we?\u201d\u201cWell, I doubt anyone would be reckless enough to traverse the mountain like us,\u201d Henrick grumbled.Shaneth glared at Henrick and retorted, \u201cAnyway, since we\u2019ve reached the capital, you\u2019ll be handing over your family heirloom as agreed, right?\u201d\u201cRight,\u201d Henrick answered.\u201cBut I\u2019m curious; what is that heirloom?\u201d Shaneth asked curiously.\u201cIt might be easier for you to understand if you see it yourself, rather than just hearing me explain it,\u201d Henrick answered with a slightly mysterious expression.Iris was looking at the capital, her eyes filled with curiosity; she said, \u201cSomeone exactly like me lives in that place.\u201d She was the doppelganger of the princess, and just a change of clothes did not mean that no one would recognize her in the capital.Henrick rummaged through his backpack and took out a vial of dye. He said, \u201cChanging her clothing was a good idea, but that hair stands out too much.\u201dIndeed, the flowing golden blonde hair that was a symbol of royalty on the continent stood out too much; it was a cause for concern that the headscarf she was wearing might suddenly become undone, or her hair might stick out from the collar of her shirt.Iris asked tearfully, \u201cDo we really have to?\u201d\u201cOf course; you might drag us to hell with you if you get caught!\u201d Henrick reprimanded her as he skillfully moved his hands and colored her hair brown.Whether it was intentional or not, Iris\u2019 new brown hair looked somewhat like Shaneth\u2019s hair color, and one might mistake them as sisters from afar. Shaneth snapped her fingers and suddenly exclaimed, \u201cNow you can be my big sister! Our hair colors look alike, so anyone would mistake us for sisters.\u201d\u201cYou want to be my little sister?\u201d Iris asked, wide-eyed with surprise. She then added, \u201cI have no family. I never had one.\u201d\u201cThe same goes for me.\u201d Shaneth awkwardly smiled as she remembered a bitter memory from her past. She recalled when she had lost her family in a fire when she was young; that was when she had gotten her burns as well.Kang Yoon-Soo looked at the capital. He had initially needed to do three things in Deferon; those were to raid the Ruins of Ice and Spirit, contact the White Lion Clan, and create a new spirit. The Ruins of Ice and Spirit that he needed to conquer to clear the legendary quest were located north of the capital.He had initially planned to come in contact with the White Lion Clan and easily conquer the ruin. However, he changed his plans. He needed to grow extremely fast in this life, even if it meant that he had to push himself to the limit.He might be able to conquer the ruins with relative ease if he cooperated with the White Lion Clan, but he would lose the opportunity to grow stronger as well. He needed to think differently this time around to monopolize all of the experience points and items.It was not only that. Kang Yoon-Soo looked at Iris and asked, \u201cWhat about the White Shadow?\u201d\u201cIt has been silent,\u201d Iris answered.The White Shadow was the existence within the doppelganger that had mentioned the fact that Kang Yoon-Soo could no longer regress after this life. Kang Yoon-Soo planned to meet Iris\u2019 creator to solve the mystery behind that existence. Thankfully, he knew who Iris\u2019 creator was based on his memories from his previous life.\u2018Rumier Kazan, the Royal Alchemist who had a hand in the Chimera Dimension incident.\u2019 He recalled the name. He had to meet that alchemist to find the true identity behind the White Shadow that resided within Iris. The White Shadow was the only variable that had changed amid his hundreds of regressions, and it could be the key to ending the cycle once and for all.Kang Yoon-Soo then thought, \u2018That Alchemist resides in the royal palace. If I have to infiltrate the royal palace, I might as well assassinate that person.\u2019***The party entered Deferon, and Henrick, who was familiar with the city, led the way. The sky turned orange, signaling the sunset.\u201cHenrick ahjussi[1], can we delay the passing on of the heirloom to tomorrow? I\u2019m exhausted from crossing the mountain,\u201d Shaneth said; she looked obviously tired.\u201cHmm\u2026 Is that so? Well, it doesn\u2019t matter to me either way,\u201d Henrick responded.All eyes fell on Kang Yoon-Soo. He nodded and said, \u201cLet\u2019s rest for today.\u201dThe party entered a small inn on the street and paid for their rooms. They looked quite haggard and exhausted from traversing the mountain.Kang Yoon-Soo and Henrick went to wash up first; Shaneth and Iris then went together to bathe. The two beauties\u2019 conversation reached all the way outside the bathroom.\u201cIris unni! That\u2019s soap! You can\u2019t eat that!\u201d Shaneth shouted.It seemed their bath time was not all that peaceful.Henrick roughly dried his damp hair as he went down to the first floor, finding Kang Yoon-Soo sitting expressionlessly in a position that was neither comfortable nor uncomfortable. Henrick smirked as he sat opposite Kang Yoon-Soo and said, \u201cOur journey together will end tomorrow.\u201d\u201cYeah,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.The barmaid came over with a tray full of black lager, and Kang Yoon-Soo nonchalantly downed a large mug in an instant. Henrick could not sit back and watch, and he downed a large mug himself.Burp!Henrick wiped the beer foam off his lips as he put down his mug. He tapped the large mug a few times before beginning, \u201cDo you know why I love drinking so much?\u201d\u201cTo forget the painful memories,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.\u201cLook at you. You knew about it,\u201d Henrick replied. He emptied another large mug of beer and added, \u201cAlcohol is quite a companion. It tastes bitter, but it lets you forget about the painful memories, whether by making your head hurt or by other means. It moves the bitterness from your head to your tongue.\u201d\u201cMe too,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied, taking a sip from his mug.\u201cWhat?\u201d Henrick asked in surprise.Kang Yoon-Soo downed his own mug before saying, \u201cThat\u2019s why I like it too.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026 I always thought that we wouldn\u2019t get along, but surprisingly, we have a lot of things in common,\u201d Henrick said. He laughed and pushed his mug toward Kang Yoon-Soo. Kang Yoon-Soo replied by extending his own mug; they shared a toast with a clink, causing the foamy beer to sway like a wave.The number of empty mugs increased, and the barmaid started to complain of leg pains. Henrick\u2019s face started to turn red as he began to get drunk. Kang Yoon-Soo stared at the drunken Henrick as he started to reminisce.Henrick Elrickerson was a good man, based on Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s memories from his previous lives. Once, Kang Yoon-Soo had seriously learned how to be a Puppeteer under him, and there were times when they had drunk themselves till sunrise. Henrick\u2019s laid-back but quick-witted personality had helped Kang Yoon-Soo multiple times in the past as well.Once, they had become sworn brothers, and Henrick was a good older brother\u2014to the point that he had died for Kang Yoon-Soo.After seeing Henrick\u2019s sacrifice, Kang Yoon-Soo had refused to be sworn brothers with Henrick in any of his other lives. He had been scared of being emotionally attached to Henrick once again, as the ending had always been tragic.\u2018However\u2026 Now\u2026\u2019 Kang Yoon-Soo thought. It was not only Shaneth; this was also his last time meeting Henrick. He suddenly muttered in a low voice, \u201cCome with us.\u201d\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Henrick asked, looking surprised.Kang Yoon-Soo was shocked at his own words too. He could not remember how long it had been since he said those words to another. However, saying those words did not feel bad at all.He said once more, \u201cCome join us; let\u2019s travel together.\u201dHenrick, whose face was now red from drunkenness, looked at Kang Yoon-Soo skeptically before he let out a smirk. He said, \u201cI never imagined I would hear those words from you.\u201d\u201cWell, the one who wants it should be the one to propose it. Kang Yoon-Soo shrugged.\u201cI would have asked first even if you didn\u2019t,\u201d Henrick replied with a snicker. He added, \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe a jerk like you existed when I first met you. I\u2019ve gone through all sorts of weird experiences after traveling with you. But despite all that\u2026 It was fun.\u201d He was smiling, but his gaze was serious.\u201cI\u2019ve felt the thrill of living once again at this age after traveling with you. To think I have the chance to do a legendary quest on top of that? Having a huge event like this happen at this stage of my life makes me feel like a real artist,\u201d he added.Henrick flicked his finger at Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s forehead. It was something an older brother would usually do to his younger brother as a joke. Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s eyes trembled slightly, but Henrick was too drunk to notice that small movement.Henrick smirked as he extended his mug once again, saying, \u201cToday is the first time you\u2019ve looked like a human being, you punk.\u201d\u201cThank you\u2026\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo slowly replied as he extended his own mug. The two men clinked their mugs and downed their beer once more.The sound of footsteps coming down the stairs rang out, and a sweet voice entered their ears, calling out, \u201cKang Yoon-Soo.\u201dAll of the patrons and even the barmaids looked toward the source of that voice; a beautiful, barely-clothed woman was coming down the stairs with only a towel covering her body. The woman\u2019s bountiful chest and well-endowed thighs stole the eyes of the men in the room.Iris came down the stairs, staring at the people intently looking at her. Henrick on the other hand rubbed his eyes a few times in disbelief and exclaimed, \u201cThis\u2026 Am I too drunk right now? It feels as if I\u2019ve seen something I shouldn\u2019t have.\u201dIris softly asked, \u201cWhere is my room?\u201d\u201cThat way,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied nonchalantly, pointing toward a room.Shaneth hurriedly ran out with her hair still wet; however, unlike Iris, she was lightly dressed. She exclaimed, \u201cIris unni! I told you that was the first-floor hall!\u201d\u201cAh, right.\u201d Iris calmly nodded and slowly walked up the stairs.Henrick was left in disbelief. However, he broke out into a laugh and said, \u201cThat\u2019s right, I wouldn\u2019t have this kind of fun if I traveled alone, would I?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied, downing the remaining beer in his mug.The beer today tasted quite sweet for some reason.1. \u2019Ahjussi\u2019 refers to an uncle or a middle-aged man in Korean. \u261cPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 50": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Record of a Thousand LivesChapter 51Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayMorning came, and the four left the inn with Henrick guiding the way. They walked for quite a distance before arriving at a cemetery. Shaneth looked around before asking, \u201cYou put your family\u2019s heirloom in a place like this\u2026?\u201d\u201cWhat? It\u2019s much better than a castle filled with undead, right?\u201d Henrick retorted as he rubbed his chin and walked toward a grave. It was an old and shabby grave that did not seem to be special in any way.Henrick got down on his knees, starting to dig through the soil covering the grave. He dug through the ground for quite a while before turning around to look at Iris and remarking, \u201cCome to think of it, you\u2019re stronger than me, right?\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026 I suppose you are right,\u201d Iris said. She grabbed the tombstone with one hand and easily pulled it out of the ground. It was an amazing display of strength; Henrick was shocked, despite having seen it multiple times before.\u201cI just can\u2019t get used to it, since she\u2019s doing that while in the form of the princess,\u201d Henrick said with an awkward expression.An old, worn-out box was in the ground; Henrick opened the box after pulling it out. It contained a set of crafting tools, a few brown patches of leather, and a strange-looking thing; one could not possibly imagine what the last item was used for. Although it looked quite old and shabby, the box and its contents strangely resembled a first aid kit.Shaneth frowned as she asked, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me\u2026 This is your family\u2019s heirloom\u2026?\u201d\u201cHuh? How did you know?\u201d Henrick replied.\u201c\u2026\u201d Shaneth felt a sense of meaninglessness. She had not expected anything grand, but to think that all they had received in return for completing Henrick\u2019s quest was some worn-out box containing useless miscellaneous items\u2026 Her reaction was justified, as anyone who put in the effort to complete his quest would feel a sense of loss upon seeing the rewards.Henrick clicked his tongue a few times before exclaiming, \u201cHey, you punk! Aren\u2019t you looking down on it too openly? I guess I have to show you how it\u2019s used.\u201dHe grumbled a few times before grabbing the worn-out box that resembled a first aid kit. He took something that looked like a sharp awl[1] and gently slashed his left wrist with it.It was not that strong of an action, but Henrick\u2019s left hand suddenly detached from his arm.Thud.His left hand helplessly fell to the ground; the area around his wrist was severed cleanly.\u201c\u2026!\u201d Shaneth was so shocked that she could not close her mouth. Kang Yoon-Soo, on the other hand, seemed uninterested.Iris looked at Henrick\u2019s left hand on the ground and asked, \u201cCan I eat it?\u201d\u201cI know our little miss is an epicure, but my conscience will be guilty if I let you eat junk food like that,\u201d Henrick answered dramatically as he picked up his left hand without a fuss. He then pointed toward the first-aid kit and said, \u201cThis is my family\u2019s heirloom. It lets you attach doll body parts to yourself and use them as your own.\u201dA message suddenly appeared on the wrist device.[The owner of the heirloom has taught you how to use it.][You may check the new information made available to you.]New information and details on the worn-out tools in the box popped up.[Body Crafting Kit]The heirloom of the Elrickerson family. It is a magic tool that allows the user to attach doll body parts to their own body. It is said that an insane Puppeteer once used this to convert numerous children into puppets. It is highly dangerous to attempt to attach or convert a body party to a doll if the user does not have good crafting skills.*If someone else\u2019s body part is attached to the user, it should be fresh and well preserved before being attached.*A poor attempt to attach parts may cause the user to lose sensation in their nerves.\u201cHow is this possible?\u201d Shaneth asked in utter disbelief as she stared at Henrick waving his left hand\u2014on his right hand.Henrick scratched his cheek with his right hand and said, \u201cI don\u2019t like to be dramatic, so I\u2019ll keep the explanation brief. The Royal Artisan suddenly caught an incurable disease on his left hand that slowly made it stiffen, and knew it would soon spread to his whole body. He decided to retire and wander around before finding out about the heirloom, and he decided to chop his left hand off and replace it with a doll\u2019s hand. Then, that guy felt immense guilt about performing one of the forbidden acts for a Puppeteer and resigned from his position as the Royal Artisan, and spent his days drunk and wasting away.\u201dShaneth was still in shock, her mouth hanging wide open. Kang Yoon-Soo, on the other hand, was still indifferent to the whole story, calmly putting the Body Crafting Kit into his backpack.Henrick watched Kang Yoon-Soo take the Body Crafting Kit and gave him an ominous warning. \u201cListen, I\u2019m giving that to you because it was a promise, but I want you to remember this. The fact that you can replace a lost body party with a doll\u2019s isn\u2019t that great, and there\u2019s a high chance of failure.\u201d\u201cI know,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo nonchalantly replied as he started walking toward the streets.He now had two more things to do. The first was to conquer the Ruins of Ice and Spirit to continue with the legendary quest, and the second was to meet the alchemist who had created Iris and ask about the identity of the White Shadow who knew about his regression.\u2018Which one should I do first?\u2019 Kang Yoon-Soo soon made his decision.***The Martial Blood Clan was an organization that used their intense bloodlust to fight to the death. It boasted a massive 1,000 members, but it was only considered a middle-sized clan in the capital.The condition to register as a member of the Martial Blood Clan was simple. Anyone with a powerful desire to grow stronger and was able to prove their thirst for battle, whether they used the sword, the bow, or magic, was allowed to be a part of the clan.\u201cThe Ahinkuls have recently been rampaging in the swamps northeast of the capital. The Ahinkuls are animal-type monsters that feast on animal fat and convert it into explosive oil in their bodies. You will make it easier for the traders and merchants to travel outside the city walls if you manage to dispose of at least 2,000 of those monsters.\u201dAs expected of a middle-sized clan, the quests they carried out were quite a bit larger than what an average party would receive. Most clans that exceeded a certain size could also receive massive quests, such as manufacturing goods to be supplied to the royal palace.The Martial Blood Clan were usually in charge of carrying out quests for bandit or monster subjugation. The leader of the Martial Blood Clan, Jiang Ren-Wei, took two hundred of his clan members to the swamp to subjugate the Ahinkuls.The Ahinkuls lived in herds, but their individual intelligence was quite high for monsters. They were around Level 200, and each of them could hunt prey alone.Jiang Ren-Wei struck the last surviving Ahinkul on the head with his blunt weapon, and it died on the spot. He returned his weapon to his waist and began walking slowly, lightly swinging his thick, muscular left arm.\u201cGood job, everybody. I\u2019m glad no one died this time; go get some rest,\u201d Jiang Ren-Wei said to his clan members. The clan members of the Martial Blood Clan lowered their weapons and started to rest.Jiang Ren-Wei was a sophisticated man who had an intense thirst for battles. His main weapon was a destructive but hard to control blunt weapon, and his combat sense was far higher than that of most average Travelers.However, there was one thing about him that stood out\u2014he only had one arm. After he had been abruptly summoned to the Sylphia Continent, he had been attacked by a vicious monster. That monster had bitten his right arm off and feasted on it in front of him.Most people would have despaired at that sight, but it was different for Jiang Ren-Wei. He did not give up. He had originally been a right-handed person, but that did not deter him as he had rigorously trained his left-hand day after day. He had managed to become the leader of a middle-sized clan despite his disability of having only one arm.Jiang Ren-Wei had obtained the class Indomitable Warrior after countless battles; it had been made possible by his intense grit that transcended that of a normal person. Unfortunately, people often assumed that the reason the Martial Blood Clan only remained a middle-sized clan was because he only had one arm, thinking that if he had both of his arms, it would have been very easy for him to dominate the leaders of other clans.However, the clan members of the Martial Blood Clan respected Jiang Ren-Wei. His attitude of passionately fighting on the front line and treating his clan members well without any prejudice was something his clan members highly admired about him.It was around the time the clan members sat down on the ground and took out their rations that one Continental quickly approached Jiang Ren-Wei, reporting, \u201cBoss! I found something strange over there!\u201dThe Martial Blood Clan, unlike other clans, did not differentiate between Travelers and Continentals when accepting members. That was one of the reasons why most of the other clans made fun of the Martial Blood Clan, calling it a half-breed mongrel clan.Jiang Ren-Wei slowly stood up and asked the Continental, \u201cWhat did you find?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 Well, I couldn\u2019t believe my eyes either when I saw it\u2026 If you put it in fishing terms, it\u2019s a big catch, and if you put it in bed terms, it\u2019s a giant cock!\u201d the Continental named Durman, who was the breadwinner of his family, exclaimed.Durman had been an alcoholic, and he had caused a commotion one day that forced him to become a mercenary at his age. However, he had turned his life around after meeting Jiang Ren-Wei, and he now focused on working hard to provide for his family.Jiang Ren-Wei scratched his cheek with his left hand and asked, \u201cBig catch? Giant cock? Have you found a treasure or something?\u201d\u201cAhhh, come take a look for yourself,\u201d Durman replied.Jiang Ren-Wei and the other clan members started to think that Durman might have actually found something big because he was pushing for Jiang Ren-Wei to go take a look. Jiang Ren-Wei followed behind Durman as he led them to the deepest part of the swamp, and an eerie draft of wind below toward them. Autumn was around the corner, but it was still technically late summer. However, the atmosphere in the area was strangely chilly.Jiang Ren-Wei tilted his head in confusion and asked, \u201cWas there always a place like this in the swamp?\u201dThe ground that would normally turn mushier as one went deeper into the swamp started to harden as if it had been frozen solid, and the trees that normally boasted a lush crown of leaves on their branches were replaced with rows of dried and withered ones.It was around that time that the group reached the rows of withered trees that the sight in front of them made them exclaim in surprise, \u201cWow!\u201dIt was a sight that did not suit the swamp at all. The scenery in front of them was covered in thin frost and layers of snow, and the glare that reflected off the ice made the group\u2019s eyes hurt. The scenery was beautiful yet eerie, and standing in it made the hairs on the backs of their necks stand.A large, majestic structure was in the middle of the area. Jiang Ren-Wei could only doubt his eyes as he stared at the structure with his mouth agape.The structure\u2019s majesty was carved in the transparent ice it was made out of. The carvings had been made so magnificently that the clan believed even the best sculptor in the world would not be able to replicate such a grand structure. In addition, the structure was so large that it was impossible to see the entirety of it at once. There was no way a structure so impressively awe-inspiring could be man-made.\u201cIt\u2019s a ruin\u2026\u201d Jiang Ren-Wei muttered under his breath.\u201cIt\u2019s as I thought, right? I was really surprised when I saw it,\u201d Durman responded; his mouth hung wide open in awe as well.Ruins were dangerous places that hundreds or even thousands of monsters inhabited. In the world the Travelers came from, they were also called dungeons. They were places crawling with monsters that gnashed their teeth at the sight of any intruders, and extremely rare treasures were guaranteed to be at the heart of each ruin. That was not all; the top contributor to the conquest of the ruin would even receive special powers.It was the first time for even Jiang Ren-Wei to see a ruin in person; ruins were usually located far away from cities, and they were usually found in the wilderness, such as in canyon gorges or the desert.However, no one could ever have imagined that a ruin would be located so close to, if not right beside, the capital of the empire.The air suddenly turning cold was definitely the influence of the ruin. Durman felt the eerie chill; he gulped nervously and asked, \u201cWhat should we do? It\u2019s a ruin, so we might strike it big if we manage to reach the center of it. I don\u2019t think any other clan has noticed it, so why don\u2019t we take it ourselves?\u201dJiang Ren-Wei looked at the icy ruin before falling into a dilemma. However, he raised his head after a short while and said, \u201cNo, it\u2019s impossible for us to conquer the ruin alone.\u201dThe ruin in front of him possessed an immense amount of magic power that could change the climate of the entire area, and there were bound to be unbelievably strong monsters in it. Around two hundred people were usually required to conquer a ruin, and the clan members Jiang Ren-Wei had brought with him for the subjugation quest made up approximately that figure. However, Jiang Ren-Wei instinctively knew that the icy ruin was going to be much more difficult than that.The Martial Blood Clan was composed mostly of all kinds of classes that focused on combat, and they did not possess even one healer among them. Jiang Ren-Wei knew that only death awaited them if they decided to recklessly challenge the icy ruin. It was impossible for a careful person like him to be greedy and risk his entire clan just for the treasures of the ruin.Durman sighed, feeling that a good opportunity had been lost, and said, \u201cIt\u2019s a shame that we can only take a look at the ruin and not get its treasures\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s alright; we can come back after we\u2019ve grown stronger or if we recruit more people,\u201d Jiang Ren-Wei said, patting Durman with his arm.However, Durman walked toward the ruin, as if he could not let go of his regret. There, he saw a small plate that had words written on it. Unfortunately, he could not read the words because of the frost that had settled atop it.Durman was certain that the name of the ruin was written on it, and he wiped the frost away with both of his hands. The name of the ruin became fully visible.[Winterkill]\u201cWinterkill, eh? Haha, what a frightening name\u2026\u201d Durman, who had been laughing just moments before, suddenly trailed off into silence.1.

Jiang Ren-Wei felt that something was off, and he walked toward Durman. Durman was standing still as if he had been hypnotized, with his eyes out of focus.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? What happened?\u201d Jiang Ren-Wei asked, shaking Durman\u2019s shoulder, but Durman just remained in the same state.Suddenly, a bright light shone out of the plate the name of the ruin was written on. Jiang Ren-Wei covered his eyes with his left hand, nearly blinded by the light; suddenly, Durman ran toward the ruin, huffing and puffing.\u201cHey! Where are you going?!\u201d Jiang Ren-Wei shouted, trying to pursue Durman. However, Durman easily pushed open the gigantic door of the icy ruin, then ran into it.Jiang Ren-Wei hesitated for a moment, thinking, \u2018Do I go in\u2026?\u2019 He could not shake off the uneasy feeling creeping up on him, but he shook his head and made a decision. He entered the Winterkill Ruin, as he could not abandon his clan member.The interior of the ruin was white all over; it was filled with frost and transparent blocks of ice, and the air within was bitterly cold. Jiang Ren-Wei found Durman standing dazedly inside; he ran toward Durman and kicked him.Thankfully, Durman seemed to come back to his senses. He protested, \u201cAh! Boss! Why are you suddenly kicking me? Did you feed your remaining arm to a monster or something?\u201d\u201cFeed, my ass! Don\u2019t you remember what happened?\u201d Jiang Ren-Wei asked.\u201cWhat are you talking about? Huh? Where are we?\u201d Durman looked around in surprise. Jiang Ren-Wei sighed in resignation, then turned around and walked toward the door of the ruin.Creak\u2026The door suddenly shut. Jiang Ren-Wei banged on it with all his might. However, even though it had easily opened when Durman pushed it, the door did not budge an inch this time. As the light that had entered through the door disappeared, the ruin was cast into such darkness that the two had a hard time identifying what was immediately in front of them.Durman, who had good night vision, suddenly pointed at something and said, \u201cBoss! Look at that!\u201dNumerous pale white skeletons slowly rose up from the frozen floor. Unlike normal skeletons made of bone, they were made of ice. The Ice Skeletons were much stronger monsters compared to normal undead, and at least 400 of them had risen from the ice-cold floor.Durman trembled, screaming in horror, \u201cBoss! What should we do?!\u201d\u201cWhat else can we do? Raise your weapon!\u201d Jiang Ren-Wei gritted his teeth as he tightly gripped his blunt weapon in his left arm.***Iris looked at the object in her hand with eyes full of curiosity. It was a clear crystal, but it was too cold to hold. She thought, \u2018What could it be?\u2019 She fiddled with the object briefly before licking it.\u201cAh\u2026\u201d Iris\u2019 tongue stuck to the ice. She was suddenly flustered and did not know what to do. She tried pulling it away, but decided against it as each attempt to detach the ice made her tongue hurt..Shaneth pulled her sleeves back just as Iris\u2019 eyes were about to fill with tears. Shaneth let out an exhausted smile as she took a water canteen and poured some over Iris\u2019 tongue; afterward, Iris was able to safely remove her tongue from the ice.Iris glared at the ice in her hand and said, \u201cYou are a naughty child. I do not feel like tasting you anymore.\u201d\u201cOh! What good news to hear, that you know how to be picky with your food as well,\u201d Henrick said, cackling.Shaneth looked at the icy ruin in front of her eyes and exclaimed in amazement, \u201cIt\u2019s amazing! This is the ruin the Death General Kalriven mentioned! What\u2019s this ruin\u2019s name? Ah, it\u2019s written over there.\u201d She was about to approach the plate in front of the ruin, but Kang Yoon-Soo suddenly blocked her path.\u201cDon\u2019t go near that plate,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.\u201cWhy?\u201d Shaneth asked.\u201cIt\u2019s enchanted with hallucination magic,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.Suddenly, various noises emerged from the ruin; it seemed someone was battling inside it. A man shouted from within, \u201cHaaap!\u201dThe voice was familiar. Kang Yoon-Soo bit his lips as he thought, \u2018It happened faster than I expected\u2026\u2019It was his first time going down this route, and he had no prior experience whatsoever; however, his plans were going to go awry if Jiang Ren-Wei died. Jiang Ren-Wei was an absolute necessity to conquer the Winterkill Ruin. His plans to get stronger quickly and complete the legendary quest would be delayed if Jiang Ren-Wei died just then.\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said, hurriedly guiding his party members into the Winterkill Ruin.***The Ice Skeletons were tricky opponents to deal with. Their bones made of ice did not easily break even if they were hit with strong attacks, and they would breathe out chilling air to slow down their opponents if one got too close to them.Jiang Ren-Wei tightly flexed his left arm, swinging his blunt weapon.Kwachik!An Ice Skeleton\u2019s head was crushed by his attack, but a near-endless amount of Ice Skeletons was still charging at the pair.While busily swinging his sword, Durman gritted his teeth and exclaimed, \u201cBoss, I think this is as far as we go! Thank you for everything!\u201d\u201cSwing your weapon one more time if you have time to spew bullshit like that!\u201d Jiang Ren-Wei retorted.Even if they wanted to escape, the door of the ruin was closed. The two men fought with all their strength as they tried to secure a path to retreat through; however, they were almost immediately surrounded by the Ice Skeletons. The skeletons clacked their jaws as if they were hungry for blood.Clack! Clack! Clack!Jiang Ren-Wei glared at the skeletons. No hint of despair could be found in his eyes even though he was now cornered; rather, his gaze was now filled with grit and determination.\u201cRelentless Survival!\u201d Jiang Ren-Wei used his unique class skill.His class was Indomitable Warrior. It was a rare class he had obtained by training with one arm and never giving up. As he got fully worked up, bulging veins emerged all over his body; the frost that covered him broke apart in an instant. Relentless Survival was a skill that consumed his life force to maximize his combat power.Jiang Ren-Wei lifted his blunt weapon and let out a deafening shout. \u201cHaaaaaa!\u201dHe had never given up even after his right arm was eaten by a monster. He was definitely going to survive this!Just as he was about to charge into the skeletons after letting out a battle cry\u2026Creak\u2026The previously locked door suddenly opened, and a man charged into the dungeon even before the sunlight could fully enter it. The man quickly swung his sword.Clang!The sword landed a critical strike through a skeleton\u2019s eye socket, causing it to retreat at the sudden damage it took. The attack was meant to deter the skeleton rather than outright kill it.The Ice Skeletons charged at the new intruder, but the man was surprisingly calm as he used a skill, \u201cDance of Death.\u201d He started to fiercely swing the black longsword in his hand; his swordsmanship was both reckless and dazzling.Four of the Ice Skeletons that surrounded the man were instantly blown away; however, he seemed to be focusing on blowing away the skeletons rather than outright killing them.\u2018What?\u2019 Jiang Ren-Wei was surprised at the calm demeanor of the man, who acted as if he were used to facing multiple enemies at once. However, what surprised Jiang Ren-Wei more was the man\u2019s cold, expressionless face that resembled that of a doll.The man looked toward the door of the ruin and said, \u201cShaneth.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d a brunette beauty answered, suddenly running toward Jiang Ren-Wei and Durman. Numerous Ice Skeletons aimed their weapons toward her neck with the sole intention to crush it. However, the beauty unslung the large scythe on her back and shouted, \u201cPyrokinesis!\u201dThe scythe was suddenly enveloped in flames that spread around the surrounding area; a wall of flames that seemed out of place in an icy ruin rose. The Ice Skeletons hesitated, as the intensely burning fire wall separated them from the adventurers.Fire and ice were polar opposites; as such, ice attribute monsters like the Ice Skeleton absolutely loathed fire.A middle-aged man suddenly shouted from the entrance of the ruin, \u201cHey! What are you doing! Come over here if you want to live!\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re saved!\u201d Durman exclaimed, shedding tears of joy. Jiang Ren-Wei holstered his blunt weapon on his waist and ran toward the exit of the ruin; the expressionless man followed behind them.The door of the Winterkill Ruin was designed to be easy to open from the outside, but impossible to open from the inside.\u201cClose it,\u201d the man said as they exited.Iris pushed the ruin door shut. Jiang Ren-Wei was impressed that a girl so young possessed such an immense amount of strength. It seemed the girl had invested quite a bit of her stat points into strength.In any event, they had survived. The recoil from Jiang Ren-Wei\u2019s skill was still there, but he bowed his head as he showed his gratitude to the strangers, saying, \u201cThank you. We survived because of you. I am the leader of the Martial Blood Clan, Jiang Ren-Wei.\u201d\u201cAigooo! I\u2019m a mercenary under the Martial Blood Clan. My name is Durman Barra. Thank you so much for saving us. If I may ask you, what are your names, oh saviors?\u201d Durman asked.The man who had saved them answered in a dry emotionless voice, \u201cKang Yoon-Soo.\u201d\u201cI see you are from a different country. I am from Tianjin, China. You must be Korean, I presume?\u201d Jiang Ren-Wei asked. Kang Yoon-Soo nodded.More than just Koreans had been transported to this world; people of many other nationalities had been transported. They were able to communicate with each other thanks to the wrist devices they wore.The others introduced themselves one by one.However, Henrick looked at Jiang Ren-Wei and exclaimed in surprise, \u201cYou\u2019re a clan leader, but you only have one arm? Wow, that\u2019s amazing!\u201d\u201cHenrick ahjussi!\u201d Shaneth hit him in the chest with her elbow.Henrick\u2019s face suddenly turned pale as he choked for a moment. He exclaimed, \u201cYou punk! What the hell?!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He said with a laugh, reassuring Shaneth, \u201cThis is fine; most people are surprised to hear that. I got used to it.\u201dHe stretched out his hand toward Kang Yoon-Soo, offering a handshake as he said, \u201cAnyway, I will never forget this debt. I will be sure to handsomely reward you if you come to find us at our clan later. It will also be fine if you come along with us back to the city.\u201dKang Yoon-Soo just stared at Jiang Ren-Wei and did not take the offered hand. Instead, he turned around and pointed toward the Winterkill Ruin, saying, \u201cI plan to conquer the Winterkill Ruin. To do that, I need you, Jiang Ren-Wei, and your clan\u2019s help.\u201dJiang Ren-Wei let out a laugh, but he shook his head and said, \u201cI understand your enthusiasm to conquer an unexplored ruin, but we have no plans to take on the risk and raid a ruin anytime soon. The monsters in the ruin are too strong for a mid-sized clan like ours, and we plan to report the location of the new ruin to a bigger clan and get rewards for it.\u201dKang Yoon-Soo extended his right hand, but Jiang Ren-Wei, who did not have a right arm, could not respond to his handshake. Jiang Ren-Wei was flustered at the strange gesture, but Kang Yoon-Soo suddenly said, \u201cIf you help us with the raid, I\u2019ll give you a right arm.\u201dJiang Ren-Wei was stunned, seemingly not understanding what the man in front of him was saying. He asked, \u201cAre you saying you will give me a prosthetic arm if my clan helps you with the raid?\u201dIt was not that Jiang Ren-Wei was against using a prosthetic arm, but it would be mainly for show, and a prosthetic arm often got in his way during a battle; that was why he preferred to only use his left arm.However, Kang Yoon-Soo shook his head and replied, \u201cIt\u2019s not a prosthetic arm.\u201d He lightly tapped Henrick\u2019s shoulder and proceeded to take out the Body Crafting Kit from his backpack before handing it over.Henrick glared at him before letting out a sigh, saying, \u201cAs soon as I gave you this heirloom, you planned to use it up to the last piece\u2026 Jerk\u2026\u201dHe pulled on his sleeve while opening and closing his left hand. He then took out the awl from the Body Crafting Kit and slashed it across his left wrist. Of course, his hand quickly separated from his arm.\u201cAck! What the hell is that?!\u201d Durman screamed in surprise at the clean yet grotesque sight. Jiang Ren-Wei could not hide his surprise as well.Kang Yoon-Soo started to explain to Jiang Ren-Wei, \u201cIt\u2019s a magic tool that allows one to replace a body part with that of a doll. I\u2019ll give you a right arm if you decide to help me raid the ruin. However, I\u2019ll be in charge of leading the raid.\u201dJiang Ren-Wei pondered the offer for a moment before asking, \u201cThat left hand, may I touch it?\u201d\u201cIt feels weird hearing that from a guy\u2026\u201d Henrick grumbled as he passed his left hand over.Jiang Ren-Wei inspected the left hand, surprised to find that the texture and muscles of the hand felt very similar to the real thing. He then asked Henrick, \u201cWhat is this left hand made of?\u201d\u201cI stole the bones from the graveyard, and stitched together pig muscles to recreate the muscles,\u201d Henrick replied.\u201c\u2026\u201d Jiang Ren-Wei was speechless.\u201cHey, isn\u2019t it better than living with only one hand?\u201d Henrick remarked, scratching his cheek.\u201cWell, I suppose you are right. Were there any side effects after you replaced your missing hand with the doll part?\u201d Jiang Ren-Wei asked intently.\u201cIt feels awkward at first, since it\u2019s not your real hand, after all. Still, it does the job once you get used to it. The nerves are connected so you can move it as you wish, although you won\u2019t be able to feel any pain,\u201d Henrick replied.Jiang Ren-Wei was now facing a huge dilemma after seeing Henrick\u2019s left hand. He hesitantly asked, \u201cHow can I trust you people?\u201d He was quite the cautious type. There was no way he was just going to hand over the commanding rights to the raid just like that.\u201cA raid does not happen just like that. We need to form a proper party with various classes, and we also need to have a leader who has excellent leadership skills. A ruin, unlike a normal monster lair, can cause numerous fatalities. If you wish to receive our support, you will have to prove your qualifications,\u201d he added.Jiang Ren-Wei was perfectly aware of Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s incredible swordsmanship, since he had seen it with his own eyes. However, a ruin raid was a completely different matter. The Winterkill Ruin was certainly going to be full of all sorts of traps, just like the hallucination magic on the nameplate and the door that could not be opened from the inside. There was definitely going to be a high risk of the whole clan being annihilated if they did not conduct a thorough investigation prior to the raid.\u201cI\u2019m currently doing a legendary quest,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.\u201cDid you just say a legendary quest?!\u201d Durman exclaimed, surprised.Kang Yoon-Soo nodded and pushed a button on his wrist device. The details of the quest he was currently carrying out appeared.[Legendary Quest\u2014Castle of the Dead]The screen on the wrist device was not something that someone can tamper with. The man in front of them was really doing a legendary quest. A legendary quest not only gave significant rewards, but also had the potential to shift the power balance of the continent. However, in this case, it was all the proof needed to prove that Kang Yoon-Soo was an outstanding adventurer.Jiang Ren-Wei let out a sigh and said, \u201cAlright. I believe that you are more than qualified. However, this is not something I can decide alone. First, I need to discuss this with my clan members.\u201d\u201cC\u2019mon, boss! Was there ever a time we turned down a good fight? Our boys are always eager to jump into battle. Besides, we get to find you a right arm as well, so isn\u2019t it obvious? I know you\u2019re cautious, but sometimes you\u2019re too cautious,\u201d Durman said, snickering.\u201cYour words are always so elegant, Durman,\u201d Jiang Ren-Wei said with a sigh. He guided Kang Yoon-Soo and the others to where the Martial Blood Clan members were, then revealed the fact that they had found the Winterkill Ruin.\u201cAre you saying you found a ruin?\u201d\u201cThen we have to go conquer it right now before others catch wind of it!\u201d\u201cAre you saying we can get the boss a right arm? This is finally my chance to repay him!\u201dThe members of the Martial Blood Clan were all fired up, and they sounded like they were ready to draw their weapons and charge into the ruin at any minute, just as Durman had said.Jiang Ren-Wei waved his left arm and tried to calm them down, saying, \u201cWe\u2019ll be doing the raid, but I won\u2019t be commanding it.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s not the boss, who will be commanding?\u201dJiang Ren-Wei pointed at Kang Yoon-Soo and said, \u201cHe\u2019ll be commanding the raid, and he\u2019s currently doing a legendary quest.\u201d\u201cA legendary quest?\u201d The Martial Blood Clan members looked at Kang Yoon-Soo in surprise. It was obvious for them to be surprised by the fact that a stranger would be commanding the dangerous ruin raid, and also that he was currently doing a legendary quest.A woman raised her hand and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s his name?\u201d\u201cKang Yoon-Soo,\u201d the man answered in his usual emotionless tone.The Martial Blood Clan did not seem to have any qualms about Kang Yoon-Soo commanding the raid. However, it was not because they trusted Kang Yoon-Soo, whom they had just met that day; it was because they trusted the decisions of their boss, Jiang Ren-Wei. They firmly believed their boss would have a good reason for handing over the commanding rights to that man.Jiang Ren-Wei guided them to a shabby shack. He said, \u201cFirst, we will distribute the rewards individually, since the contribution ranking will be shown at the end of the raid. The highest contributor will get the treasures of the ruin. Most raids conduct their reward distribution in this way; do you agree?\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo nodded in agreement.Jiang Ren-Wei rubbed his right shoulder with his left hand and added, \u201cI would prefer to receive the right arm after the raid, since I might have a hard time adjusting to a new body part, and I am more used to fighting with only my left arm.\u201d His words were filled with his pride as a one-armed warrior.\u201cWe have a lot of things to prepare to get ready for the raid,\u201d Jiang Ren-Wei said. He continued, \u201cThe top two hundred members of our clan are all here, and their levels are within a range of Level 150 to Level 200. Our clan is mostly comprised of Swordsmen, Spearmen, and Archers. We lack support classes like Healers or Blacksmiths, so we will need to recruit them for the raid. We can exclude Sorcerers since they would cost too much.\u201d\u201cWe will need a massive amount of healing potions on top of that, not to mention the Blacksmiths to repair our equipment, a Thief to disarm the traps, and Runners to scout ahead. If we calculate all of that, we will need an astounding amount of money and time. We might need more people and resources depending on your commanding style too,\u201d Jiang Ren-Wei went on.A ruin raid promised immense riches, but the time and resources required to conquer one were immense as well. The monsters inhabiting ruins were much more dangerous than the monsters outside.\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, what level are you?\u201d Jiang Ren-Wei asked.\u201cI can\u2019t reveal that.\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo refused.Jiang Ren-Wei nodded, showing that he would no longer push the issue, since there were numerous Travelers who were reluctant to reveal their levels. \u201cForgive my rudeness. I am sure you must be high-leveled, since you are currently doing a legendary quest. I just asked out of curiosity,\u201d Jiang Ren-Wei said apologetically.Kang Yoon-Soo would normally have no qualms about revealing that he was Level 131, but it was now different this time around. He had to give it his all even for any minor choices he made, and Jiang Ren-Wei\u2019s confidence in him would drop if he revealed the fact that he was lower-leveled than the members of the Martial Blood Clan. There was no need to reveal the truth and cause confusion in the group.He suddenly said, \u201cThere\u2019s no reason for us to bring a Blacksmith, Thief, or Runner.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d Jiang Ren-Wei asked, surprised.\u201cI can fill those roles instead,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.Jiang Ren-Wei was speechless, looking confused. He asked, \u201cAre you saying you will repair equipment, disarm traps, and even scout the area?\u201d\u201cWe don\u2019t need a Healer either. I\u2019ll prepare an adequate amount of potions to substitute for one,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo added.Jiang Ren-Wei now had a look of utter disbelief in what Kang Yoon-Soo was saying. However, Henrick suddenly chimed in, \u201cI know it\u2019s not easy to believe it, but he really can do everything by himself.\u201d\u201cStill, it doesn\u2019t make sense. How can someone do the work of all those classes alone?\u201d Jiang Ren-Wei replied. It was a normal reaction for anyone to have.\u201cI\u2019ll prove it later, but rather than that, we need to increase our manpower,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.\u201cI agree that we are lacking people right now. Should we hire some mercenaries?\u201d Jiang Ren-Wei asked.It was normal to hire mercenaries whenever there was a need for more manpower during battles or hunts. Mercenaries were divided into copper, silver, or gold tiers based on their capability. The higher the mercenary\u2019s rank was, the more expensive they were. That was why, when most people hired a lot of mercenaries at once, they usually went for copper-tiered ones.However, Kang Yoon-Soo shook his head and said, \u201cIt would take a lot of time and money to hire mercenaries.\u201d\u201cThen how do you suggest supplementing our lack of manpower?\u201d Jiang Ren-Wei asked.Kang Yoon-Soo replied, \u201cWith undead.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 53": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Record of a Thousand LivesChapter 54Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayJiang Ren-Wei was not a fool; he was a rather cautious type. Although he was filled with intense longing for his missing right arm, he did not plan to risk clan members\u2019 safety only to see them get annihilated under a foolish man. That made him observe Kang Yoon-Soo all the more closely.He even planned to forcefully take back Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s commanding rights if he felt even for a second that Kang Yoon-Soo was not qualified, even though he was currently doing a legendary quest. However, all of his worries were for naught.Kang Yoon-Soo stood atop a hill and commanded the group, \u201cSoutheast, approximately 320 meters. Left of the thick bush. Seventeen Ahinkuls. 1st group, go subjugate them.\u201dThe 1st group was composed of Mercenaries and Swordsmen. They charged toward the southeast, and just as Kang Yoon-Soo had said, there was a group of Ahinkuls hiding behind the bush. The Ahinkuls swiped their claws as they tried to resist, but they could not stand against the humans\u2019 sudden ambush.Kang Yoon-Soo continued to give out commands. \u201cNorthwest, approximately 340 meters. Across the waterfall. There are thirty-two sleeping Ahinkuls. They have their leader with them, so the 3rd group and the 6th group will coordinate a joint attack.\u201dKang Yoon-Soo\u2019s tactics were quite unique. The basic strategy for monster hunting was to create one huge group and go around searching for monsters, but he went against that and divided the Martial Blood Clan into groups instead; interestingly, the groups were a mishmash of Mercenaries and Swordsmen, with both high levels and low levels.He continued to command the army from atop the hill. An army of merely 200 being divided up to such an extent would usually become exhausted looking for monsters before ending up as prey and being annihilated. However, his tactics were very effective and efficient, as if to make Jiang Ren-Wei\u2019s worries look ridiculous. Whenever Kang Yoon-Soo gave out a command and pointed to one location, the Martial Blood Clan would find monsters there.The hill was quite tall; it was quite a bit too far for anyone to actually see anything happening on the ground. Even if one had excellent vision, it was impossible for anyone to see all of the monsters from that high up\u2014unless they had memorized the monsters\u2019 locations.Additionally, Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s commands did not end at just giving out orders to kill the monsters. He instructed them, \u201cStab the nostrils of the sleeping Ahinkul Leader behind the waterfall. It\u2019s much easier than attacking its thick hide. Thrust your spear deep into its nostrils and penetrate its brain.\u201dJiang Ren-Wei was astounded and amazed. He thought, \u2018He really is amazing.\u2019 He had initially accepted the man\u2019s offer because of the temptation of receiving a right arm. However, he now started to fully trust Kang Yoon-Soo, thinking the man\u2019s commanding ability was beyond amazing.Jiang Ren-Wei gulped and thought, \u2018He must be extremely high-leveled. A low-level person like me can never measure up to him.\u2019 He was Level 227, and he was considered to be in the upper-mid tier among Travelers when it came to their levels. However, he was certain that he was nothing compared to that man.Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s appearance was so shabby and simple that anyone would doubt he was a high-leveled Traveler, but Jiang Ren-Wei was certain his outer appearance did not do justice to his level. In fact, there were some high-leveled people who chose to dress simply rather than going around in heavy plate armor. That was how confident those high levels were when it came to their combat ability, as they preferred to move lightly and avoid every attack rather than being weighed down by the heavy armor.Kang Yoon-Soo, on the other hand, thought, \u2018This is irritating.\u2019He had initially planned to immediately start the Winterkill raid with the help of the White Lion Clan that was headquartered in Deferon. The White Lion Clan was the top-ranked clan among Travelers.A place like the Winterkill Ruin would have been an insignificant raid if he received the assistance of a clan like the White Lion Clan, which was filled with high-leveled people. In fact, he was confident that they would be able to reach the heart of the ruin without any difficulty if he just brought Han Se-Hyun, who was the leader of the White Lion Clan, along.However, it would be difficult to grow exponentially if he depended on high-leveled people. That was why he decided to bear the risk and cooperate with the Martial Blood Clan, and why he had chosen to stay behind and command instead of fighting himself.Kang Yoon-Soo had to hide his level from Jiang Ren-Wei, at least until they entered the ruin, because there was no way anyone would listen to someone lower-leveled than them no matter how superb their commanding skills were. Jiang Ren-Wei would instantly notice the fact that he was lower-leveled than the Martial Blood Clan if he were to join the battles immediately. However, his smokescreen plan was highly effective. Jiang Ren-Wei, who was the highly cautious type, could never have imagined that he was a measly Level 131, and that he was lower leveled than any of the Martial Blood Clan\u2019s members.The corpses of the Ahinkuls piled up like a mountain under the hill. It would have normally taken them around four days to hunt so many, but it only took them half a day this time.Durman, who had been busily swinging his sword, licked his lips and said, \u201cThe fact that he said he was currently doing a legendary quest was already amazing, but this is beyond amazing. Not only did the monsters pop up whenever he gave us the location, he even told us the monsters\u2019 weaknesses! I\u2019ve never hunted so easily in my life before.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right! This is the first time I\u2019ve ever felt regret about not being able to hunt more.\u201d\u201cMy experience points rose faster than usual!\u201dThe clan members of the Martial Blood Clan did not spare any praise for Kang Yoon-Soo.Jiang Ren-Wei went down from the hill and scratched his cheek, saying jokingly, \u201cPhew, it seems as if I\u2019ll be replaced as the clan leader.\u201d\u201cHahaha! Boss! There\u2019s no way we\u2019d leave you and jump ship, y\u2019know! You\u2019re still our boss, after all!\u201d Durman exclaimed, cackling and wrapping his arm around Jiang Ren-Wei\u2019s neck.Kang Yoon-Soo went down from the hill as well. A ball of fire fluttered and landed beside him, then Sally appeared beside him with her cheeks puffed up. The beautiful young girl seemed to be upset about something.\u201cPapa, Sally is angry,\u201d Sally said.\u201cWhy?\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied tonelessly.Sally had taken on the role of messenger in the hunt just then. She had gone back and forth between Kang Yoon-Soo and the groups of clan members relaying his instructions, because spirits had the ability to freely fly around as long as they did not go too far.Sally did not hold back and exclaimed, \u201cHmph! Don\u2019t act dumb! You told me you would give me a sibling way back, waaaay back, but I don\u2019t see any sibling! Papa is a liar!\u201d She seemed upset by the fact that Kang Yoon-Soo had not kept his promise to make a sibling for her.\u201cI\u2019ll make you one after we conquer the ruin,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.However, Sally was all teary-eyed, pulling on the hems of Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s pants and throwing a tantrum. \u201cLiar! Liar! Papa is always like this! You don\u2019t play with Sally! You think I\u2019m just a bother! I hate you, papa! Waaaah!\u201d\u201cOh my, what troubles you have to go through, all because you have such a dense, emotionless father,\u201d Henrick said as he retracted his mana threads, laughing awkwardly as he walked toward them.Shaneth also approached them with her Death Scythe covered in blood. The last to join them was Iris; it seemed she had feasted on monster hearts, as her mouth was covered in blood. They had also joined in the hunt for Ahinkuls, just like the clan members of the Martial Blood Clan.Iris smiled with her bloody lips, saying with eyes wide, \u201cYour crying must mean you are upset. Do you think you would feel better if you ate some hearts?\u201d\u201cWaaaah! Mama!\u201d Sally cried loudly as she ran toward Shaneth.Shaneth smiled as she hugged Sally to calm her down, saying, \u201cThere, there. It\u2019s alright.\u201d\u201cWaaaah!\u201d Sally wailed.Kang Yoon-Soo shifted his gaze away after looking at Sally and Shaneth. The clan members had gathered all of the Ahinkul corpses in one place; a huge amount of Ahinkuls had been hunted by the 200-strong party.\u2018The first step is to do a large-scale hunt,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo thought as he stretched out his right hand toward the pile of corpses and said, \u201cMass Raise Dead.\u201d[You are trying to raise too many corpses at once.][The types of undead summoned will be uneven.]A group of bestial-looking Ahinkuls slowly rose up, havingturned into undead. Some of them turned into skeletons, and some of them turned into zombies with dark blue eyes. The vicious and aggressive Ahinkul Leaders rose up and turned a dark black, having gained the attribute to spread diseases around them. Although they were undead that could not make quick decisions, they were still a much stronger force than the mercenaries they would have hired otherwise.[612 Undead Ahinkuls have been sent to the summon dimension.][Summons currently stored in the dimension: 612 Undead Ahinkuls, 52 Zombie Black Bears, White.][Remaining space for additional summons: 34]Jiang Ren-Wei approached Kang Yoon-Soo after he sent the undead to the summon dimension. He asked, \u201cNow that we\u2019ve supplemented our lacking manpower with the undead, I guess it\u2019s time to procure the items we\u2019ll need. I\u2019m guessing we have to procure a significant amount of potions. Are you sure you can prepare that many potions alone?\u201d\u201cYeah,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied curtly.Jiang Ren-Wei acknowledged Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s capabilities, and he was thus willing to overlook that much. He continued, \u201cAlright, we\u2019ll head to Deferon first and complete the quest we were doing just now. When should we set our meeting date?\u201d\u201cTomorrow noon, here,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied curtly once again.\u201cAlright. I\u2019ll see you here, then,\u201d Jiang Ren-Wei replied. Afterward, the Martial Blood Clan went on their way toward the capital.Kang Yoon-Soo looked around and found Shaneth hugging Sally. He stared at the two, seemingly deep in thought, before going to Sally and taking her hand.The spirit who had just bawled her eyes out sniffled and asked, \u201cSniff! What do you want?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll play with you,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.\u201cWow! Really?\u201d Sally asked, excited once again.Henrick looked up at the sky and said while staring upward, \u201cThat\u2019s strange\u2026 The sun didn\u2019t rise from the west today.\u201d***There was no special reason why Kang Yoon-Soo had told Sally he would play with her. It was a given that he should, since this life was going to be the last time he could.The streets of Deferon were bustling with activity. The streets were littered with numerous vendors selling all sorts of odd and mysterious things; it was as if there were as many vendors as stars in the night sky. Kang Yoon-Soo bought a lollipop made out of sweetened barley from a street vendor and gave it to Sally.\u201cWow! It\u2019s so sweet!\u201d Sally exclaimed excitedly as she sucked on the candy. Her bright flames would have made it obvious that she was a spirit, but they were covered up by a robe.Henrick could not hide his surprise as he looked at Kang Yoon-Soo and asked, \u201cHey\u2026 did you eat something wrong? Why are you acting strange all of a sudden? Did you perhaps open your eyes to fatherly love or something?\u201d\u201cWhy do you care?\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied coldly.Shaneth could not hide her surprise as well, saying, \u201cI think you\u2019ve changed quite a lot in these past few days.\u201dThose words were quite strange to Kang Yoon-Soo. He tried to think of a reply, but he failed, and chose to stay silent instead.However, Shaneth smiled and said, \u201cIt makes me happy.\u201dKang Yoon-Soo had the sudden urge to look elsewhere the moment he saw Shaneth\u2019s warm, sparkling eyes. The one he decided to look at was Iris. He had wanted to conquer the Winterkill Ruin not only because of the legendary quest, but also because he wanted to meet the alchemist who had made Iris. He felt the need to find out more about the White Shadow that resided in Iris.Perhaps Iris caught him looking at her, as she looked back at him intently and licked her lips before saying, \u201cI want to eat that too.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dKang Yoon-Soo ended up buying four sweetened barley lollipops and shared them with everyone in his party.They soon reached a large wooden building not long after. The building\u2019s signboard read \u2018Sunset Glass\u2019 and had a drawing of a glass bottle with purple liquid inside it. It was a merchant company that manufactured and dealt with all sorts of potions, as well as flammable liquids and highly explosive liquids. They were one of the merchant companies with a long history in the capital, although there were some bad rumors about them being involved with the back-alley thugs.Kang Yoon-Soo stopped, turned around, and said, \u201cListen to me, all of you.\u201d He then explained his plans to the others.Henrick bit his lips and asked, \u201cDamn it, how do you plan to survive after doing something like that?\u201d He looked troubled for a moment before taking out a bottle of colored dye from his pocket and giving it to Kang Yoon-Soo, asking, \u201cYou are confident, right?\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo nodded and took the dye.Shaneth looked quite worried and said, \u201cThat\u2019s too dangerous; it won\u2019t end with just you getting jailed if things don\u2019t go well.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll never be caught if you just follow my instructions,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said confidently.Sally asked with innocent, sparkling eyes, \u201cCan I play as much as I want?\u201d\u201cAs much as you want,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.\u201cYaaay!\u201d Sally exclaimed.Shaneth, Henrick, Sally, and Iris went in through the back door. Meanwhile, Kang Yoon-Soo approached one remote corner of the alley and took out the Body Crafting Kit. \u2018Black Tiger Clan\u2026 I was planning on destroying you early on, but my plans have changed.\u2019He used Henrick\u2019s colored dye to draw a tattoo on the back of his hand. His light strokes quickly formed into a tattoo of a black tiger. \u2018I\u2019ll suck your bones dry down to the marrow in this life.\u2019Kang Yoon-Soo looked toward a merchant company\u2019s building as the sun began setting. He would need at least a month to create enough potions to be used by more than 1,000 people, including the undead, even with his potion-making skills.He did not plan to waste his time like that; neither did he have the funds to procure such a massive amount of potions. However, if this was the last time, he needed to take the dangerous road even if it meant risking it all to climb to the top.He went into the merchant company\u2019s building. The interior was crowded with alchemists, merchants, and adventurers, all trading potions. He went up to the receptionist and told himself, \u2018Be brazen, just like how you tricked Jiang Ren-Wei about your level. Just as you hid your physical weakness with mental fortitude, it\u2019s time to deceive another to reap the rewards.\u2019\u201cHow may I help you?\u201d the skinny female receptionist asked.Kang Yoon-Soo motioned for the woman to come closer. Right as her face drew close enough, however, he suddenly pulled her hair down.\u201cKyaaah!\u201d The woman screamed in surprise.Kang Yoon-Soo whispered in her ear with an icy voice, \u201cA bomb has been set up in this building.\u201dIt was now time to pull off the scam.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 54": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Record of a Thousand LivesChapter 55Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe leader of the Sunset Glass merchant company, Lefman, was a quick-witted individual. He had managed to grow a back-alley potion shop into a large merchant company by selling even the waste produced from potion-making.Lefman was sharp, and he could read the turn of events in the outside world. He was always the first one to kowtow if it was time to bow his head, but he was also the first to step on another person if it was time to arrogantly raise his head.There were rumors that he was a money-crazed person who did not know any limits if it meant he would earn money. Lefman actually agreed with that rumor. He did not differentiate between good and evil when it came to profit, and he even engaged in all sorts of dirty tricks just for the sake of profit. The bribes he had given to the royal palace were so significant that a common family would be able to live off them for decades without working. His dirty tactics had enabled Sunset Glass to survive various troubles and grow into what it was today.Suddenly, one day, a group of people from another world started to appear on the continent. They were called Travelers. Travelers had devices on their left arms, and they seemed to be obsessed with quests; they managed to survive on the continent by doing quests for the Continentals.Lefman had instinctively known that the Travelers who toiled day and night, even forgoing their own happiness just to survive, would one day overtake the laid-back Continentals and grow into a powerful force on the continent.Ultimately, his instincts had proven to be correct. The Travelers had grouped up into clans and taken over the back alleys with their resourcefulness. Lefman had thus decided to cooperate with the largest criminal clan in the back alleys.That criminal clan was the Black Tiger Clan. They had erased all traces of bribery and tax evasion by the Sunset Glass merchant company. Lefman was unsure how they had been able to do that, but he was certain that they had either destroyed all the related files or planted a spy in the royal palace.Sunset Glass paid the Black Tiger Clan in potions and a small fee for every job they did. It was not a losing business, as that was something that Lefman would never engage in; rather, it was a win-win situation for them. Sunset Glass thus provided the Black Tiger Clan with the resources they needed to hunt and grow for some time.Once Lefman felt reassured that the Black Tiger Clan was not a bad business partner, he had decided to meet the leader of the Black Tiger Clan, Yu Si-Do, himself. It turned out that the Traveler called Yu Si-Do was a strange individual. During Lefman\u2019s first time meeting Yu Si-Do, he felt strangely uncomfortable around the man. Maybe it was because he had created the first criminal clan on the continent, but Lefman could feel the madness embedded deep within Yu Si-Do\u2019s mind.Yu Si-Do had given an interesting proposal to Lefman that day; after giving it some thought, Lefman decided to accept it. That was how Sunset Glass had entered into a long-term partnership with the Black Tiger Clan.They had decided to grow exponentially larger by taking advantage of the back alleys, partnering together to enter the illegal drugs market. Yu Si-Do had insisted that drug dealing was a very big opportunity for Sunset Glass to grow larger. Sunset Glass was already in the potion-making business, and it was very easy for them to make drugs by utilizing their supply chain, from the alchemists who manufactured the potions all the way to the herbalists who foraged for medicinal herbs in the wild. Additionally, it was not difficult for them to find recipes for drugs.The Black Tiger Clan took care of distributing the drugs, while Sunset Glass secretly manufactured the drugs at night. The profits generated were so unimaginably huge that Lefman felt his time and youth dabbling in the potion making business were wasted, insignificant in the face of the immense wealth the drug trade brought.They had gotten a variety of customers in the back alleys too; from homeless beggars who had nowhere to go to noblemen\u2019s wives who were addicted to gambling, their customer base did not differentiate between old or young, male or female. It was to the point that Lefman thought their customer base had more potential customers than candies and snacks would.It was impossible for their drug trade not to be profitable because of the people who took the drugs out of curiosity and ended up begging for a mere drop. As such, Lefman had decided to aggressively expand the business after getting a sweet taste of the profits. Sunset Glass had started to explosively increase its production capacity for illegal drugs, and the Black Tiger Clan had expanded its distribution network from the capital to even the most remote countryside villages.The immense profits had been enough to bribe the investigators to look the other way. Although it had cost Sunset Glass quite the sum to bribe them, it was still well worth it to have the investigators in their pockets. Once the treasury of Sunset Glass started to amass quite the fortune, Lefman used his newfound wealth to buy out shares in the other merchant companies.Lefman had bought out a few small merchant companies and absorbed them into Sunset Glass. After he absorbed the small ones, he went ahead and absorbed the mid-sized companies. Sunset Glass eventually became a large merchant company and proudly established a spot in the capital of the continent, and nobody dared to spread any rumors that Lefman was a greedy man who would sell his soul for profits. Lefman had become a mogul people would pay respects to even in private, and there was nobody who could treat him the way they had before.That was why Lefman could not believe a man had just kicked his door down and entered his office so brazenly. His office in the merchant company was not a place that anyone could just enter without prior appointment, and even his secretary dared not open the door even after knocking unless he gave his permission. However, this man had just kicked his door down and welcomed himself into his office; not only that, he also sat down comfortably on Lefman\u2019s leather sofa and arrogantly crossed his legs as if it were his own room.Lefman put down the documents he had been checking and asked, \u201cWho the hell are you?\u201dKang Yoon-Soo nonchalantly replied, \u201cA soon-to-be murderer.\u201dLefman was left in a dilemma. He wondered whether he should call the guards immediately to drag this crazy man out of his office, or if he should fire his secretary and the receptionist who had let the man waltz into his office.Lefman tapped his finger on his desk and said, \u201cI\u2019m sure you have seen my secretary and receptionist on the way here. Tell me, did they seem so incompetent as to let a madman like you waltz in here?\u201dHowever, Kang Yoon-Soo replied with an answer completely unrelated to the question Lefman just asked. He said, \u201cThere\u2019s a bomb in this building.\u201dLefman was not taken aback at all. He had seen worse kinds of bluffs from all sorts of people, compared to the madman sitting in front of him. The kind and benevolent mask he wore around people fell away, and he unhesitatingly showed his true face filled with greed and anger. Most people would be intimidated at the sight of his face and back off, but Kang Yoon-Soo was not fazed at all. In fact, Kang Yoon-Soo did not flinch even a bit as he stared right back at Lefman.\u2018Look at this punk,\u2019 Lefman growled inwardly as he pulled his beard. \u201cYou seem pretty tough for a youngster. I\u2019ll overlook this, so why don\u2019t you stop this nonsense and go home at once,\u201d he said before going back to his documents.Kang Yoon-Soo suddenly pointed outside the window. Lefman looked outside out of curiosity, and saw a brunette woman walking while holding a child\u2019s hand. It was a very common sight, which made him all the more confused.Kang Yoon-Soo suddenly snapped his fingers.Tak!Booooom!\u201cKyaaaaah!\u201dFlames shot up from the ground out of nowhere, and the woman and the child were instantly engulfed by them.***The commotion outside turned into chaos, as several carriages bumped into each other and people began screaming in horror.\u201cW-What the hell is going on?!\u201d Lefman shouted.The woman and the child were on the floor twisting and squirming in agony, but nobody dared to approach and help them because of the flames that had shot up from the ground and appeared out of nowhere.\u201cDamn it! Move!\u201d shouted a middle-aged man who suddenly appeared from the crowd and jumped into the wall of fire. The man bravely went into the flames and rescued the two victims, then took off his coat and tried to use it to extinguish the fire on the victims\u2019 bodies.Lefman could not hide his shock at the sudden turn of events. Meanwhile, Kang Yoon-Soo slowly prepared to finish the theatrics. As the room darkened, Lefman hesitantly asked, \u201cThat must have been done by you, am I right?\u201dKang Yoon-Soo nodded and replied, \u201cThere are explosives installed in the basement of this building, and a single flick of my finger will trigger a huge explosion.\u201d\u201cYou liar! Do you think I would believe you managed to do all of this alone?!\u201d Lefman raged.\u201cWell, my comrades and I, to be exact,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said. He showed off the back of his hand, revealing a familiar tattoo painted on it\u2014it was a vicious black tiger.The experienced merchant Lefman was left shaken, muttering, \u201cThe Black Tiger Clan?\u201d\u201cWho else would be capable of doing such a thing within a day, if not us?\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied as he sat back down on the leather sofa. It was hard to believe how composed he was after burning two people alive in broad daylight.Lefman carefully examined the man in front of him. He had met many of the Black Tiger Clan members during his dealings with them, and his sharp eyes were telling him that the tattoo engraved on the man\u2019s hand was the real tattoo of the Black Tiger Clan. It was almost impossible for anyone to create a forgery that was so similar to the real black lines of the tattoo used by the Black Tiger Clan, and the fact that he was a Traveler was proven by the device on his wrist.However, why would the Black Tiger Clan do such a thing?If there really were explosives installed in the basement of the building as the man said, this was indeed a grave situation, and it meant that everyone in the building as well as himself was now being held hostage. To make matters worse, there were a ton of rare, luxurious items in the building that even Lefman had not had the chance to use yet.Lefman shouted aggressively, \u201cWhy are you suddenly doing this?! I remember the Black Tiger Clan being in a strong alliance with us!\u201d\u201cA strong alliance, you say?\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo smirked as he repeated Lefman\u2019s words, retorting, \u201cI wish our boss, Yu Si-Do, could be here to hear you say those words. If he had been here, your head would have immediately fallen off your shoulders.\u201d\u201cDamn it, what the hell are you talking about?!\u201d Lefman exclaimed.\u201cLefman, you\u2019ve made our boss very angry,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said as he rubbed the tattoo on the back of his hand. The tattoo should have smudged off by his constant rubbing if it were made of colored dye or paint, but it did not smudge one bit. He continued without even batting an eye, \u201cDo you know the White Lion Clan?\u201d\u201cWhite Lion Clan? You mean that clan founded by the Travelers?\u201d Lefman replied.Kang Yoon-Soo nodded and continued, \u201cIt\u2019s currently the largest clan among the Travelers, and they\u2019re the only ones who have the power to fight against us, the Black Tiger Clan. But, it seems someone leaked information regarding boss Yu Si-Do to the White Lion Clan.\u201d\u201cWho are you talking about?\u201d Lefman asked nervously.\u201cWho do you think would stand to profit greatly from betraying us right now?\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo asked in a menacing tone.\u201cAre you suspecting me?!\u201d Lefman shouted, sounding as if he were about to have a seizure at any minute.Kang Yoon-Soo pointed at Lefman\u2019s chest and said, \u201cI speak on behalf of our whole clan. You\u2019re the most suspicious one.\u201dLefman gritted his teeth, his face red with rage as he retorted, \u201cNonsense! That\u2019s utter nonsense! How can you doubt the trust we\u2019ve built for so long?! You held my company and my people hostage, and now you\u2019re suspecting me? I\u2019ll no longer deal with the Black Tiger Clan if you keep this u\u2014\u201d\u201cShut up.\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo cut Lefman off and lightly snapped his fingers. Suddenly, another explosion rang out from the other side of the building.Booooom!Lefman huffed and puffed toward the window; he saw another woman unconscious on the pavement, engulfed by flames. He hurriedly turned around and looked at Kang Yoon-Soo.Kang Yoon-Soo sat arrogantly on the sofa and ordered Lefman, \u201cSit. Unless you want to see your whole company burned down to the ground.\u201dLefman gulped upon realizing he had met a man far more evil and sinister than himself.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 55": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Record of a Thousand LivesChapter 56Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWhat was the most important thing to remember when trying to pull off a scam?Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s voice was emotionless, and he was a man of few words. In fact, he could not remember the last time he had actually gotten angry at someone. However, he had to kick his stiff tongue into motion and spit out words smoothly to pull this off. He racked his brains for memories related to Lefman as soon as he entered the Sunset Glass building.\u2018Lefman Ackeron. He\u2019s a middle-aged man with plenty of kids. He has four women whom he calls his wives, and he rarely goes home. His teenage kids are all addicted to the drugs he distributes, but he isn\u2019t aware of that fact. He\u2019s quick-witted and is very calculating when it comes to anything profitable, and his greed knows no bounds. He isn\u2019t capable of planning things, nor is he a good orator; rather, he survives by kowtowing in front of the strong,\u2019 Kang Yoon-Soo recalled.The rest was easy from there on out. Kang Yoon-Soo just needed to act as an even worse villain than Lefman. He purposely sat arrogantly on the sofa and glared at Lefman, and he intentionally lowered his voice to make it sound more sinister and menacing. He also remembered to tilt the back of his hand to make sure the tattoo of the Black Tiger Clan would be visible at all times. It was as if he were wearing another person\u2019s skin.\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Lefman asked with a trembling voice he tried his best to hide.Kang Yoon-Soo was satisfied with Lefman\u2019s response, but he did not forget to maintain his arrogant posture before saying, \u201cGive me five times the normal tribute you used to pay to our clan.\u201d\u201cAre you kidding me?!\u201d Lefman screamed, slamming his fist on the table.Baaam!Lefman\u2019s face was red, and his fist was trembling in anger as he exclaimed, \u201cI can\u2019t accept that word! First and foremost, \u2018tribute\u2019? Are you trying to say the Sunset Glass company is something the Black Tiger Clan can sway according to their will?\u201d He gritted his teeth as he added, \u201cAnd five times the usual rate on top of that? Don\u2019t make me laugh! You wouldn\u2019t have asked that if you were a merchant yourself! What is this nonsense?!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a shame. You would have offered up the tribute yourself if you knew our boss a little bit better than that,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said as he crossed his legs and raised his right hand. He held his index finger and thumb together, as if to show that he was capable of triggering an explosion with the snap of his finger at any moment.\u201cDo you think you\u2019ll be safe after doing this?\u201d Lefman growled threateningly.However, Kang Yoon-Soo calmly replied, \u201cYou\u2019re free to try and pay us, the Black Tiger Clan, anytime, as much as you want. Our boss, Yu Si-Do, is confident he can step on someone as insignificant as you any time.\u201dThis was no different from a declaration of war. The Black Tiger Clan actually needed to maintain their relationship with Sunset Glass, as it was currently undergoing a rapid expansion. Of course, the Black Tiger Clan did not wish to cut their ties with Sunset Glass, and neither would they demand five times the rate they were usually paid. The Black Tiger Clan actually had a very amicable relationship with Sunset Glass, and both of them greatly benefited from their cooperation.All of this was just a ruse and a scam drawn up by Kang Yoon-Soo, and Kang Yoon-Soo alone. However, events had turned out to be quite beneficial to him. Lefman believed that Kang Yoon-Soo was a member of the Black Tiger Clan; as such, it was the Black Tiger Clan that was going to be on the receiving end of Lefman\u2019s vengeance, not Kang Yoon-Soo.The most important part when pulling off a scam was to maximize one\u2019s own profit while passing the risk and responsibility off to someone else.Lefman moaned, tearing his hair out. It was difficult for him to give a rebuttal when Kang Yoon-Soo could blow his building away with a snap of his fingers. Kang Yoon-Soo completely held the upper hand in the discussion.\u201cWe don\u2019t have enough cash as of now to pay five times the usual rate. I\u2019ll pay it as soon as the drug deal with Ark City has been completed,\u201d Lefman said weakly.\u201cIs that the best you can come up with, Lefman? The deal with Ark City is scheduled to take place two months from now. Do you expect me to believe that a large merchant company like this doesn\u2019t have enough cash?\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo spat. Every single word he said was an irrefutable fact, making Lefman all the more disoriented. Lefman was now sweating like the countless drug addicts he had helped create.\u201cPlease, believe me! We really don\u2019t have enough cash right now. Isn\u2019t the Black Tiger Clan aware that we spent most of our cash to produce the drugs when such a big deal is right in front of us? I could manage if it were twice the usual rate, but five times is just too difficult,\u201d Lefman pleaded. Still, he had said everything he wanted to say despite being cornered, as expected from a true merchant.However, Kang Yoon-Soo had no plans to go easy on him. He said, \u201cThen pay up with goods.\u201d\u201cGoods?\u201d Lefman asked, dumbfounded.\u201cEven if you don\u2019t have cash, you should have some goods, right?\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.Lefman thought deeply for a moment before asking, \u201cYou mean drugs?\u201d\u201cNo, potions,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.\u201cWhat kind of potions do you want?\u201d Lefman stuttered.\u201cHealing potions, holy water, and frost antidotes. All three of them should be in good condition and not expired. Prepare enough to be used by at least 1,000 people, as well as enhancing elixirs to be used by six people,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo demanded.Lefman closed his mouth and started to think. He did have the items in stock, and Sunset Glass was more focused on the drug trade rather than the potion trade. Additionally, it seemed more sensible for him and for the company\u2019s future to pay using the potions\u2019 value rather than paying in cash. The potion trade was just a front for the company anyway, and the real profit was being generated by the drug trade.There was no reason for him to be unable to prepare the potions as long as he was given the time to prepare them, and on top of that, he had to agree to the deal since the company and his life were being held hostage. As such, he asked, \u201cWhen should I deliver the goods?\u201d\u201cRight now,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo nonchalantly replied.Lefman\u2019s face became as pale as a sheet as Kang Yoon-Soo asked him to prepare that many potions in an instant. Even though it was just a front for the company, supplying so many potions on the spot would require him to cancel most of his existing contracts.Kang Yoon-Soo thought for a moment before adding, \u201cAlcohol too.\u201d***\u201cThat guy won\u2019t be able to sleep tonight if he doesn\u2019t drink at least a bottle of liquor because of what happened today,\u201d Henrick cackled as he leaned against a wall in the back alley.Shaneth smiled while dusting off Sally\u2019s clothes and chimed in, \u201cYou were quite the actor! Anyone would think you were a righteous man, burning with a sense of justice.\u201d\u201cBurning with justice, my ass! I was almost burned to a crisp moving you two while you were on fire,\u201d Henrick retorted.\u201cLiar! Sally didn\u2019t use a hot fire!\u201d Sally yelled at Henrick.However, Henrick just laughed at Sally, pushing her forehead away and saying, \u201cHey, little miss! I didn\u2019t mean your flames, but my face was burning!\u201d\u201cHuh? Why is Sally little?\u201d Sally asked, confused.\u201cHmm\u2026 Maybe because you\u2019re noisy and a crybaby?\u201d Henrick cackled once again.\u201cSally is not a crybaby!\u201d Sally stomped her feet.Henrick laughed off Sally\u2019s tantrum, then turned around and looked at Iris. Iris was quietly standing in place, listening in on the conversation in the building.\u201cThat punk Kang Yoon-Soo, is he doing alright?\u201d Henrick asked.\u201cI\u2019m not sure, but based on the voice of his opponent getting louder, it seems he is making the other person angry and gloomy at the same time,\u201d Iris reported.\u201cI guess he\u2019s driving someone nuts right now. I know the feeling, since I was his victim too,\u201d Henrick said, letting out a sigh of pity for Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s latest victim.The doppelganger had excellent hearing ability; Iris had been able to hear even the whispers of others in the Hatar Mountains. She had the ability to hear even the faintest of sounds through a window if she focused, which was how they had been able to hear the signal to start their act whenever Kang Yoon-Soo snapped his fingers.The women and the girl who had been on fire in the street were Shaneth, Iris, and Sally. The flames that shot up from the ground had been made by Sally. They had looked like raging fires on the outside, but had not been hot enough to burn anyone who actually touched the flames. That was how Henrick had been able to act the part of a man burning with a sense of justice, diving through the flames and dragging the women out to the back alley. He had avoided the gazes of bystanders by giving them the excuse that he was bringing them to the hospital.Henrick stared at Shaneth and Sally before muttering, \u201cTo think he would draw up a ruse like this using the two least likely women to burn to death\u2026 That guy is really starting to scare me.\u201d\u201cI always thought I had a rough past, but I reconsider whenever I see Kang Yoon-Soo. I wonder what kind of life he\u2019s lived?\u201d Shaneth chimed in.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you ask him if you\u2019re that curious?\u201d Henrick added.\u201cHe doesn\u2019t tell me even if I ask him. Perhaps he\u2019ll tell me one day when the time is right,\u201d Shaneth said hopefully.\u201cWhat a thing to look forward to,\u201d Henrick said mockingly.Suddenly, a large carriage stopped in front of the merchant building. Laborers started to move large crates and chests, loading them onto the carriage. Some of the chests were excessively heavy; they were magical chests with the capacity to store massive quantities of items.It seemed as if the carriage was about to depart on a large trade expedition, filled to the brim with crates and chests. The coachman whipped two large horses, and the carriage slowly departed; however, it stopped in front of the back alley Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s party was in. Of course, the back alley was not wide enough for it to enter.The coachman looked at the four people inside before saying, \u201cGet on.\u201d\u201c\u2026Are all of those potions?\u201d Shaneth asked.\u201cYes,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied from the coachman\u2019s seat with a nod.Shaneth was surprised, Henrick was laughing, Sally was amazed at the carriage, and Iris was just tilting her head in confusion.\u201cWhat is in that carriage?\u201d Iris asked.\u201cSomething you can\u2019t eat,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.\u201cThat\u2019s too bad,\u201d Iris said with a disappointed smile.The party boarded the carriage, and Kang Yoon-Soo whipped the horses into motion again. Sally insisted on sitting on the roof of the carriage; her voice reached all the way into the carriage as she exclaimed, \u201cWow! It\u2019s so fast!\u201dAs Kang Yoon-Soo was driving the carriage, he suddenly said in a low voice, \u201cOpen the chest in the left corner.\u201dHenrick was surprisingly quick when it came to such things, as he ran to the corner and quickly opened the chest. The contents of the chest made him laugh as he exclaimed, \u201cThis is why I can\u2019t help but like you!\u201dThe contents of the chest were none other than alcohol; every single bottle was expensive and luxurious, and the glasses were just the right sizes. Henrick snatched up one of the glasses and poured a drink for Shaneth. It was his attempt to preemptively stop her from nagging.Shaneth glared at Henrick before receiving the glass and saying, \u201cDon\u2019t drink too much.\u201d\u201cNo need to worry,\u201d Henrick said as he laughed and kept pouring out drinks. This time, the glass was meant for Iris.\u201cWhat is this?\u201d Iris asked.\u201cTo some, it might be referred to as a panacea; to others, it might be their reason to continue living,\u201d Henrick replied poetically.Iris accepted the glass with eyes full of curiosity. Kang Yoon-Soo and Henrick did not have glasses; rather, they each had a whole bottle of alcohol with them.Sally climbed down from the roof of the carriage and peeked through the window, asking, \u201cPapa! What about Sally?\u201d\u201cJust have a taste,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo answered.Kang Yoon-Soo was busy driving the carriage, so Henrick instead poured a sip of alcohol into a glass for Sally. Sally curiously sniffed the alcohol, taking in its aroma.The sky turned orange as the sun started to set. The party shared a toast, watching the sunset from the rolling carriage.***They left the capital and camped outside once night fell. The night passed rather quickly, and the sun rose over them once again. The Winterkill Ruin was still as cold and as eerie as ever; the carriage stopped in front of the ruin, and they unloaded the crates and chests containing the potions.Kang Yoon-Soo opened a strange, small chest as soon as he got off the carriage. It contained vials filled with a variety of different-colored potions.\u201cDrink,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.\u201cWhat are these?\u201d Shaneth asked nervously.\u201cEnhancing Elixirs,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.Shaneth gave Kang Yoon-Soo a skeptical look and asked, \u201c\u2026These aren\u2019t going to have any strange side-effects like that Adrenaline Potion, are they?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.The Enhancing Elixirs Kang Yoon-Soo had gotten from Sunset Glass could be considered the highest quality potions there were in that category. They had almost no side effects, and they raised the user\u2019s stats to the limit almost immediately after taking them. They were one of the solutions he had prepared to close the level gap with the Martial Blood Clan.\u201cSummon White,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo muttered.\u201cGrrrowl!\u201d White growled loudly as it was summoned.Kang Yoon-Soo extended a bottle to it and commanded, \u201cDrink.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dAs precious as the elixirs were, their availability was quite scarce, and Kang Yoon-Soo planned to have his party members drink them all up before the Martial Blood Clan arrived.[You have consumed a Potion of Vitality.][Your movement speed will increase for half a day.][Your endurance has increased.][You have consumed a Potion of Strength.][Your attack power will increase for half a day.][Your muscle mass has increased.][You have consumed a Potion of Mana.][Your maximum mana will increase for half a day.][You have taken three kinds of potions at once.][The potion effects have been enhanced.]The Martial Blood Clan soon arrived at the Winterkill Ruin; it seemed they had thoroughly prepared themselves for the raid, as they were heavily armed.Jiang Ren-Wei exclaimed in surprise, \u201cYou really did prepare all the potions!\u201dDurman and the other clan members raised their weapons in fright as they saw White growl at them. However, they soon breathed a sigh of relief after realizing it was one of Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s summons.\u201cTo think you managed to tame that aggressive and vicious beast. I really can\u2019t seem to guess what kind of person you really are\u2026\u201d Durman muttered.The Martial Blood Clan members took a potion each, storing the vials in their belts. They did not have a separate healer in this raid, so they were provided an ample amount of potions.Kang Yoon-Soo raised his right hand and said, \u201cSummon 612 Undead Ahinkuls.\u201d An undead legion emerged at his command.Kang Yoon-Soo checked his backpack once more and pulled out the Sword of the Holy Cross he had obtained from the Castle of the Dead, strapping it to his waist alongside Ravian\u2019s Longsword. He had kept it in his backpack because he had previously had no use for it.Jiang Ren-Wei approached him and asked, \u201cAre you done with your preparations?\u201dKang Yoon-Soo nodded and moved to the front of the group before saying, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dThe doors of the cold ruin slowly opened.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Sally started to shiver, stuttering, \u201cI-It\u2019s c-cold\u2026!\u201d A spirit was greatly affected by the environment they were in, and a ruin filled with freezing cold air was not an ideal place for a Salamander to be in.\u201cStay close to Shaneth,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.Sally wobbled toward Shaneth\u2019s legs and clung to them. After ranking up into an Ignus Warrior, Shaneth would lose no body heat even if she stood still and did nothing. She smiled and said, \u201cIt\u2019s cold, so stay close to me. Okay, Sally?\u201d\u201cOkay! Mama is warm, so I like mama. If I\u2019m near mama, I can use fire too!\u201d Sally said enthusiastically as she charged herself up using Shaneth\u2019s warmth.They soon arrived at the depths of the ruin. A group of Ice Skeletons started to rise up from the ground that had been frozen by the cold air, and they numbered around 800.\u2018The normal way to fight them would be to shoot fire arrows and fire magic from the back, but I guess we have to use a different method this time,\u2019 Kang Yoon-Soo thought to himself. He shouted a command, \u201cSally and Shaneth, prevent the Ice Skeletons from approaching.\u201dShaneth immediately dug her scythe into the ground and called out, \u201cPyrokinesis!\u201d Several walls of flame shot up from the frozen ground.Sally, who was behind Shaneth, stretched out both of her hands and cried, \u201cWrath of the Flames!\u201dThe walls of flame now had multiple layers, and as the intensely burning fire met with the frozen ice, steam rushed out all over the place. The Ice Skeletons seemed to be left at a loss by the sudden event that they had never before experienced.Once the charge of the Ice Skeletons had been stopped, Kang Yoon-Soo raised his sword high into the air and said, \u201cWe\u2019ll take this opportunity and ambush them while they\u2019re confused. It\u2019s more effective to target and shatter the spot in between their scapulae[1] rather than aim to pierce their skull.\u201dAs soon as Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s command was given, the Martial Blood Clan and Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s undead legion charged at a frightening speed toward the Ice Skeletons.\u201cUwaaah!\u201d\u201cClack! Clack!\u201dKang Yoon-Soo was, of course, standing on the forefront and leading the charge. He was able to surpass everyone and everything on the battlefield thanks to the elixirs he had consumed beforehand. The bones of the Ice Skeletons shattered whenever he swung his sword. He smashed an Ice Skeleton with the Staff of Lightning in his other hand and muttered, \u201cRelease Lightning.\u201dNumerous Ice Skeletons exploded as soon as the staff in Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s hand fired off a lightning bolt, and the Martial Blood Clan members capitalized on the opportunity to charge fiercely at the skeletons. Whenever a war cry rang out across the battlefield, the sound of weapons and icy bones clashing reverberated across it too.Clang! Clang!However, the Ice Skeletons refused to go down without a fight, and the monsters took a last stand as they bit down on the humans\u2019 arms.\u201cOuch! M-my arm!\u201d A clan member who had been bitten by an Ice Skeleton on the arm shouted, his face turning pale. The part bitten by the Ice Skeleton started to turn blue as frostbite set into it.Kang Yoon-Soo calmly gave out another command. \u201cUse the frost antidote potions you were provided as soon as you\u2019re bitten by an Ice Skeleton. The same applies if you see one of your comrades get bitten by them. Spray the frost antidote on the wound as soon as you can.\u201dMost of the Martial Blood Clan members had no issues fighting. However, they found it difficult to adjust to the slippery frozen floor, and slipped and fell from time to time. \u201cDamn it! The floor is too slippery!\u201d they exclaimed. Meanwhile, the Ice Skeletons did not miss their chance to charge at the humans who slipped and fell to the ground.However, a laid-back voice suddenly boomed from the back lines, \u201cYou mannerless bones! How can you go after those kids who barely know how to walk?\u201d A group of wooden dolls charged toward the Ice Skeletons and blocked them from attacking the fallen clan members.Henrick did not fight at the front, but rather, he stayed in the backlines and commanded twenty-four wooden dolls through his mana threads.After a while, the last Ice Skeleton was struck down by a member of the Martial Blood Clan.\u201cWe won!\u201d the Martial Blood Clan members shouted joyfully. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have any fatalities at all!\u201dKang Yoon-Soo\u2019s level had increased by six, but he had a look of dissatisfaction on his face. \u2018It\u2019s still not enough. I have to grow faster,\u201d he thought to himself.He had memorized the raid strategy for the Winterkill Ruin through his repeated regressions. He was confident that he could reach the heart of the ruin even though he had brought along a lower-leveled team this time around.The adventurers took a break, recovering from the wounds they had received from the battle with the healing potions they had been provided.\u201cWe\u2019ll now proceed to the next floor. No one should get ahead of me,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo warned them as he took point. The group walked for quite a bit before they found a staircase that led to the lower level.\u201cIt seems the ruin goes underground. The heart of the ruin that contains the treasure must be on the lowest floor,\u201d Jiang Ren-Wei explained.As soon as they began climbing down to the lower floor, they saw some barely-visible writing on a large frozen boulder.Shaneth furrowed her brow and said, \u201cThere\u2019s something written on it\u2026 but I can\u2019t see it at all. It seems to have been written quite some time ago.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026 Move over for a second,\u201d Henrick said as he took out his sculpting knife and gently carved out the frozen surface of the boulder. As the ice on the boulder started to break down, the words written on its surface became visible.[I am the adventurer Rekimond; there is not a place on the continent I have not been to. I have wandered around the continent since I was young, immersed in wanderlust. I have been to the magic tower where the colossus resides, and also to the lair of the crazed dragon.But to think that I, the great adventurer, would end my life trapped in this ruin! I greatly regret touching that nameplate enchanted with hallucination magic! I am overcome by regret that I cannot die peacefully.I started my last adventure by exploring this ruin, my body slowly becoming frozen. I found the secrets of this ruin just before the ember of my life died out. Who knew the secret to immortality was hidden away in this ruin?!]The writing on the boulder ended there, leaving the group with looks of surprise.\u201cThe secret to immortality? What does that mean?\u201d\u201cDo you think it\u2019s related to the treasure at the heart of this ruin?\u201dIt was at that moment that the wrist devices on the Travelers rang, displaying a message.[Hidden Quest of the Adventurer Rekimond]The Travelers of the Martial Blood Clan had their eyes wide open in shock as they checked their wrist devices; the Continentals could also see the quest message in front of their eyes through their innate ability to read system messages.[Ancient Adventurer]Explore the ruin by following Rekimond\u2019s Mana Golem. Look for the five boulders where Rekimond left behind the records of his exploration. You may enter the secret chamber once you have collected all of his records.Reward: A meeting with Rekimond the Immortal\u201cIt\u2019s a hidden quest!\u201dIt was only possible for a veteran adventurer to hide quests somewhere, and such hidden quests usually had a chance to give out rare and precious rewards. However, it was not guaranteed that such hidden quests would guide adventurers onto the right path.Jiang Ren-Wei looked around the basement of the ruin inquisitively and asked, \u201cRekimond\u2019s Mana Golem? Where is that thing?\u201dThe large boulder the writing had been inscribed on started to move as soon as Jiang Ren-Wei was finished speaking. The frost covering the boulder fell off as arms and legs made out of stone appeared from it. Suddenly, a large blue boulder covered in mana had revealed itself.\u201cIt\u2019s a golem!\u201d Shaneth exclaimed, surprised.It was a golem powered by a mana stone. The Mana Golem stared down at the humans with its single eyeball, located quite a distance above them. It said in a rough and deep voice, \u201cI shall follow the commands of the Great Adventurer, Rekimond Aurel, and guide you.\u201dThe Mana Golem did not attack them and just stood in place. The clan members were scared to approach it at first, but they soon gathered the courage to go closer after sensing that it was not hostile toward them.\u201cOh!\u201d\u201cTo think such a large golem is going to be our ally!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s amazing. It seems to be larger and much stronger than the golems made by the alchemists.\u201dSally excitedly jumped up and sat on the golem\u2019s shoulder, exclaiming, \u201cWow! This rock is really big!\u201dThe Mana Golem remained silent before slowly taking steps forward. Kang Yoon-Soo overtook the golem, walking ahead of it.The golem said, sounding upset, \u201cYou. Do not walk in front of me.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.\u201cYou, why do you refuse to walk behind me?\u201d the Mana Golem asked.\u201cYou\u2019re slow,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo responded.\u201cYou, I do not like you,\u201d the golem said.While still sitting on the shoulder of the Mana Golem, Sally suddenly said in a consoling tone, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, rocky! Papa is always like that!\u201d\u201cYou, why are you on my shoulder? Get down,\u201d the golem ordered Sally.\u201cHing. Sally likes it here! The view is nice too!\u201d Sally exclaimed, refusing to move.\u201cYou too, I do not like you,\u201d the golem said.Henrick could not help but snicker at the sight, remarking, \u201cWhat a fun bunch.\u201dThe first basement level of the Winterkill Ruin was vast. The group encountered new kinds of monsters wherever Kang Yoon-Soo and the Mana Golem guided them.Hundreds of Ice Landworms pierced through the frozen ground, charging toward the group in an attempt to swallow them. The adventurers raised their weapons as they prepared for battle, except one. Iris just smiled at the scene and said, \u201cThose appear to have hearts, unlike the skeletons. I think they will be tasty.\u201d\u201c\u2026Please tell us about your appetite later on!\u201d Shaneth shouted as she swung her Death Scythe mightily.The Ice Landworms attacked with their teeth just like the normal Landworms, but they also had the tendency to dive down into the ground and suddenly pop up again at random intervals. The Mana Golem stomped through the battlefield and pulled out Ice Landworms with its gigantic hands; they exploded whenever it squeezed them tightly in its hand.Kwachik!\u201cEnemy. I will kill,\u201d the Mana Golem declared in a commanding voice. It exuded an immense presence on the battlefield. It was larger and stronger than a normal golem, as its body had originally been a large boulder imbued with mana.\u201cIt\u2019s a relief that a strong golem like that is an ally,\u201d Jiang Ren-Wei sighed with relief.\u201cIt will turn into an enemy later on, so be careful,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.\u201cWhat?\u201d Jiang Ren-Wei said in surprise, staring at Kang Yoon-Soo, but Kang Yoon-Soo had already walked away from him.The exploration of the ruin proceeded smoothly thanks to the Mana Golem massacring all of the monsters that showed up, and they also found all of the records left behind by Rekimond. A strange story formed as they collected all of the records and read them as one.[I found out after a long investigation that the secret to immortality lay at the heart of the ruin. An Ice Giant lives on the lowest floor of the ruin; I shone a torch in its eyes and snuck into the heart of the ruin. There I found the secret to immortality, which was the biggest treasure this ruin held! The excitement in my body still has not subsided; I kept that treasure in the heart of the ruin. I shall become an immortal after I leave this record.]The floor vibrated intensely as what the adventurers had originally thought was a wall suddenly cracked open. The Mana Golem stomped its way toward the opening, and the rest of the party followed behind it. The place they entered was a gigantic room, containing an altar made of ice. No one knew what the altar was for, but it was tall and majestic. The clan members commented among themselves.\u201cWhat is this place?\u201d\u201cLook! Someone\u2019s at the top of the altar!\u201dA middle-aged man in shabby clothes was standing atop the altar; he looked like someone who had traveled for quite a while, as his back was burdened by a huge backpack. The man said in a high-pitched voice, \u201cAmazing! You are the first adventurers to make it to this point.\u201d\u201cWho are you?\u201d a clan member asked.\u201cMy name is Rekimond Aurel. I lost my way in this ruin just like you guys around 300 years ago,\u201d Rekimond said. The clan members looked shocked, as Rekimond looked unbelievably young for someone who had lived for more than 300 years.Rekimond, on the other hand, spoke with a gentle look on his face. \u201cI am certain that you, who managed to find my records and make it to this place, are certainly capable adventurers. I am glad to have capable juniors like you. I am sure that all of you found the hidden quest I left behind? Come up here, those of you who wish to receive their reward.\u201dThe first one to climb atop the altar was Kang Yoon-Soo. He was the representative of the raid, and no one had any qualms about him being the first one to receive the rewards for clearing the quest. He slowly climbed up the altar and stood in front of Rekimond.Rekimond smiled as he extended his hand toward Kang Yoon-Soo and said, \u201cAn exciting tale will be spread to the world thanks to brave adventurers like you! Shall we shake hands?\u201dKang Yoon-Soo stared at Rekimond, but he did not extend his hand in response. Instead, his hand moved to the sword on his waist.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Rekimond asked.\u201cI was quite surprised when I first met you. Who would have guessed that the reward for clearing your quest was to be a sacrifice on this altar?\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo remarked.\u201cI do not understand. What are you talking about?\u201d Rekimond asked once again, furrowing his brow.Kang Yoon-Soo gripped the Sword of the Holy Cross on his waist and said, \u201cI\u2019ve tried countless different ways to deal with you, and I found you were the easiest to deal with if I attacked you while you were pretending to be a human.\u201dIt was at the moment that Rekimond was about to say something that\u2026Sukeok!Kang Yoon-Soo stabbed him in the heart with the Sword of the Holy Cross.1. The scapula is more commonly known as the shoulder blade, but in this instance, Kang Yoon-Soo is telling them to aim for the skeletons\u2019 clavicles instead. \u261cPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I managed to escape death, but I am now under a curse. Now, I need blood to stay alive\u2026\u201d Rekimond said coldly as his eyes slowly turned red. He continued with a deafening shout that shook the large altar, \u201cAs long as you are inside this place! Your blood is all mine!\u201dRekimond\u2019s flesh started to tear apart; dense, thick bone grew over his once feeble-looking body and his skin turned ghastly pale. A pair of wings unfolded from his back as he slowly turned darker and darker. The newly transformed Rekimond let out an ear-splitting howl. \u201cGruwwaaaah!\u201d[A Lesser Devil\u2014Frost Demon (Level 261) has appeared!]The Martial Blood Clan members at the foot of the altar panicked. One of them shouted, \u201cM-monster! It\u2019s a monster!\u201d\u201cWhat?! He wasn\u2019t going to reward us for the quest?\u201dThey all fell into a panic, as the one who should have given them a reward for the quest had turned out to be a monster.It was Kang Yoon-Soo who reacted first while the others were still in shock. He ran down the altar and shouted, \u201cGet away from the Mana Golem!\u201dThe clan members hurriedly moved some distance away from the Mana Golem; Sally immediately jumped down from the golem as well. Suddenly, while standing at the entrance of the room, the Mana Golem suddenly smashed its arms down into the ground.Booom!A large boom reverberated through the room, and the frozen ground was split in two.\u201cI, follow the commands of the Great Adventurer Rekimond Aurel, kill you all,\u201d the immensely strong Mana Golem declared. The golem that had been a dependable ally to the adventurers until then had suddenly turned into an enemy.The Frost Demon took the chance to spread its wings and shout in a commanding voice, \u201cStorm of ice, heed my call! Attack these fools who will serve as my food and blood!\u201d It cast its wide-area magic, and hundreds of sharp ice shards flew toward the party.Kang Yoon-Soo immediately shouted a command, \u201cShaneth, Sally, raise a wall of fire!\u201d\u201cPyrokinesis!\u201d\u201cWrath of the Flames!\u201dThe two layers of flame pillars merged into one, blocking the sharp icicles that rained down from above. However, they could not fully melt all of the icicles; some of the ice shards managed to pass through.The Mana Golem attacked at ferocious speeds with its two large arms as soon as the icicles rained down from above, repeating, \u201cI, follow the commands of the Great Adventurer Rekimond Aurel, kill you all.\u201dBoooom!\u201cAaack!\u201dThree clan members of the Martial Blood Clan were immediately crushed under the golem\u2019s fists; they were the first casualties of the raid. However, Kang Yoon-Soo seemed calm and unfazed, thinking, \u2018I didn\u2019t expect to conquer the ruin without any casualties in the first place.\u2019They were now stuck between the Frost Demon casting wide-area ice magic and the gigantic Mana Golem that was blocking the exit. Kang Yoon-Soo had to raid both boss monsters at the same time.\u201cStorm of ice, heed my call! Freeze these sacrifices meant for me!\u201d The Frost Demon on top of the altar called out, casting another wide-area spell.Kang Yoon-Soo urgently shouted, \u201cAll of you, cover your weapons in holy water!\u201dHoly water looked just like normal water, but it would imbue a weapon coated in it with the holy property, causing the weapon\u2019s surface to glow. Just as Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s party had experienced at the Castle of the Dead, holy-attribute attacks inflicted heavy damage on undead and devils.\u201cSwordsmen and spearmen, form a line in front; archers, stand back and shoot at the Frost Demon,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo commanded.The Martial Blood Clan members immediately got into formation. However, the Mana Golem behind them suddenly raised its arms up again. Their formation did not matter, as they did not have a way to block the Mana Golem\u2019s attack; what awaited them was certain death.\u201cHenrick, stretch out your mana threads,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo commanded.\u201cI understand what you mean!\u201d the quick-witted Henrick said, nodding.Henrick stored all of his dolls into his summoning box and stretched out his mana threads; they extended to fifty meters in length. He called out, \u201cThread Tying.\u201dHenrick had used one of the most basic skills of a Puppeteer. \u2018Thread Tying\u2019 was a skill that could tie monsters up in exchange for giving up control of the caster\u2019s dolls. The mana threads that shot out of Henrick\u2019s hands wrapped around the arms of the Mana Golem.\u201cI can\u2019t tie this guy up for long! Hurry up and do something!\u201d Henrick shouted, struggling to keep the Mana Golem under control.Kang Yoon-Soo looked at Iris and called out, \u201cIris.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Iris asked.\u201cDig,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo ordered.Iris had feasted on the hearts of the Ice Landworms before they entered the room. Ice Landworms were monsters that had the ability to dig through the thick frozen ground, and Iris had absorbed that ability from their hearts.Large teeth that resembled those of the Ice Landworms emerged from Iris\u2019 arms and she asked, \u201cWhere should I dig?\u201d\u201cBeneath the feet of the Mana Golem,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.Iris started to dig diligently underneath the feet of the tied-up Mana Golem. She was able to dig at a frightening speed thanks to the Ice Landworm\u2019s ability she had absorbed, as well as the innate monstrous strength of the doppelganger species. The Mana Golem leaned toward one side and collapsed to the ground.Boooom!\u201cGo, subdue the golem so it can\u2019t get up,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo ordered the undead legion.The 600 Undead Ahinkuls acknowledged the command and charged at the Mana Golem. Meanwhile, the archers aimed their bows and shot arrows dipped in holy water toward their target.\u201cAirborne Shot!\u201d\u201cTriple Arrow!\u201d\u201cPrecision Sniping!\u201dNumerous arrows from various skills flew toward the Frost Demon, but the monster was still able to finish casting its spell.Whooosh!A raging blizzard started to build up around the Frost Demon, seemingly threatening to rip anyone who dared come close to it to pieces. The arrows shot by the archers were all swept away by the blizzard and fell helplessly to the ground. The blizzard started to grow larger and larger, inching closer toward the clan members that were near the foot of the altar.\u201cAck! My body!\u201d\u201cA graze can freeze you! Be careful!\u201dIt was a bitterly cold blizzard that threatened to freeze anything in its path; the rough winds blew snow all over the place, hampering the clan members\u2019 vision. They could not properly wield their weapons, as their hands were slowly freezing from the blizzard.\u201cSally,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo called out.\u201cFlame Equip!\u201d Sally raised both of her arms and used her skill. A dazzling flame covered the clan members\u2019 weapons, and their now burning weapons thawed their frozen hands.\u201cForest of Curses,\u201d the Frost Demon called out.A creeping black fog covered the ground and turned it dark. The clan members felt their strength fade away; their grips on their weapons loosened and they no longer had the courage to fight. Some of them coughed as if they had caught a deadly disease.\u201cIt\u2019s a curse!\u201d\u201cBe careful not to breathe it in!\u201d\u2018I have to make the Frost Demon come down from the altar first.\u2019 Kang Yoon-Soo thought. The Frost Demon was a powerful enemy that used powerful wide-area offensive spells and debuff curses. It was bound to keep raining its magic down on them as long as it stayed on top of the altar.\u201cWhite, come here,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo ordered the beast.\u201cMarknok!\u201d The beast who had fully pledged its loyalty roared, immediately running toward Kang Yoon-Soo.Kang Yoon-Soo got on top of White and commanded, \u201cRun toward the demon.\u201d\u201cRamirukra?\u201d White asked.\u201cUse your claws and run along the walls,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo commanded.White ran at a frightening speed and did not stop even though the blizzard was freezing its eyes and cheeks. However, it did not run toward the altar directly; instead, it chose to run and jump toward a wall instead. It extended its claws, clinging to the wall and running along its surface.It was at that moment that Kang Yoon-Soo suddenly heard an eerie, chilling sound from behind.\u201cI shall feast on your blood first!\u201d the Frost Demon exclaimed as it spread out its wings and flew toward Kang Yoon-Soo. \u201cIce Touch,\u201d the demon called out as it swung its black arm, sending out a wave of cold air.Kang Yoon-Soo instinctively jumped off White\u2019s back, but there was nothing nearby to land on as he quickly fell from the sky. The Frost Demon was already below him, glaring hungrily at him. \u2018A few seconds will decide life and death,\u2019 he told himself, stabilizing his breath.In the next moment, as Kang Yoon-Soo was halfway to crashing into the ground, a strong blizzard crashed into him. The icy winds blew so intensely he could not open his eyes. However, he gripped his sword with his eyes shut and muttered, \u201cAbyssal Sword.\u201dIt was the sword skill he had learned from the Death General Kalriven. \u2018Abyssal Sword\u2019 enabled him to deal a significant amount more damage the stronger his opponent was. Kang Yoon-Soo swung his sword imbued with both the fire and holy properties; his attack resembled a flash of lightning.Kwachik!Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s strike cut across the Frost Demon\u2019s chest that still had the Sword of the Holy Cross embedded in it, dealing a critical blow. He then stabbed his sword into one of the demon\u2019s thick black wings to keep himself from falling to the ground.\u201cGet off me!\u201d the Frost Demon screamed, flapping its wings fiercely in an effort to shake off the human clinging onto it.However, Kang Yoon-Soo had no plans to let the demon go that easily. He stabbed the demon in the chest three consecutive times, desperately muttering, \u201cAbyssal Sword. Abyssal Sword. Abyssal Sword.\u201dThe sword skill he had learned from the Death General consumed a huge 20% stamina each time it was used, and was quite risky to use consecutively as he had just done. However, the three strikes would deal massive damage to the demon if they successfully landed.The damage Kang Yoon-Soo inflicted on the Frost Demon was amplified thanks to the Sword of the Holy Cross he had stabbed early on into the demon\u2019s chest. He was able to disturb the Frost Demon\u2019s flight pattern as a result.\u201cKeheuk!\u201dThe Frost Demon decided that it was suicidal to try and stabilize its flight when the enemy was on its back; it slammed itself into a nearby wall in an attempt to shake the human off it. Its body and wings trembled from the impact, but Kang Yoon-Soo maintained a firm grip on the sword embedded in the demon\u2019s wing, holding on like a stubborn parasite.\u201cDamn human!\u201d the Frost Demon growled, before suddenly diving down toward the ground.Kang Yoon-Soo suddenly jumped off the demon at that moment and commanded, \u201cAll units, focus down the demon.\u201d\u201cUwaaah!\u201dMore than two hundred clan members charged at the demon that was now on the ground. They swung their weapons imbued with holy power, and the archers rained down arrows imbued with the holy property toward the demon.The Frost Demon snarled angrily at the humans before swiping its claws and shouting, \u201cCold Armor!\u201d It used a high-tier defensive spell that covered its entire body with armor made of ice. All of the weapons and arrows used by the clan members froze upon coming into contact with the armor.\u201cYour blood and flesh shall give me strength! Give it to me!\u201d the Frost Demon howled, skewering five clan members at once. It then crushed the corpses and began to consume them. As it did so, its wounds healed and it grew larger, now looking more formidable.[The Frost Demon had feasted on human corpses.][The demon will grow stronger the more it consumes human flesh and blood.]The Frost Demon slammed its fist into the ground.Baaam!Crack!A crater formed at the epicenter of the demon\u2019s punch. The demon was now much stronger after it had consumed the flesh and blood of several humans, and the clan members\u2019 faces paled at the sight of its new form.Right as the clan members were stunned by the demon\u2019s sudden power-up, however, a brunette woman ran toward the front and shouted, \u201cFire Strike!\u201dShaneth\u2019s Death Scythe was enveloped in flames as she slashed downward at the Frost Demon\u2019s chest. As an Ignus Warrior, Shaneth\u2019s flames were vastly more powerful than the flames that enveloped the others\u2019 weapons. The Frost Demon grimaced in pain and wildly swung its arm toward Shaneth, but Shaneth quickly avoided its strike and retreated before shouting, \u201cSally!\u201d\u201cWrath of the Flames!\u201d Sally shouted, and a vortex of flame shot out from both of her arms. However, the flames hit Shaneth instead of the Frost Demon.The Frost Demon smirked and cackled before shouting at Sally in delight, \u201cStupid fool! You can\u2019t even aim properly, and you hit your own ally!\u201d\u201cOh, do you really think so?\u201d Shaneth retorted, walking out of the flames with a confident smile on her face.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He was worried about Shaneth, but they had no other choice if they wished to hunt both of the powerful monsters at once.\u2018I\u2019ll take care of the Mana Golem quickly and go help Shaneth out,\u2019 he thought.\u201cI, move,\u201d the Mana Golem said, starting to rock its body as if it were about to disregard the six hundred undead clinging on to it and immediately stand up.Kang Yoon-Soo raised his right hand and muttered, \u201cCorpse Explosion.\u201dA large Undead Ahinkul exploded, and the explosion was much stronger than when he used common undead for the skill. It was because the Ahinkuls stored flammable oils in their bodies.\u201cI, feel pain,\u201d the Mana Golem said as some fragments fell off its body because of the explosion. Such mana stone fragments were rare materials used by Alchemists and Enchanters.Kang Yoon-Soo grasped the mana stone fragments in his hands and crushed them into powder. The powder soon turned into blue mist, and his body absorbed it. He thought, \u2018Mana stones can quickly replenish mana like potions.\u2019The current level of the skill \u2018Corpse Explosion\u2019 was Level 3, and it consumed 120 mana every time it was cast, while Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s maximum mana was 1,170. He would normally only be able to use Corpse Explosion ten times, but thanks to the Magic Amplifying Bracelet, the Ring of Life Suppression, and the mana stone fragment he had just used, his mana regenerated at a frightening speed.He unsparingly used the skill. \u201cCorpse Explosion. Corpse Explosion. Corpse Explosion.\u201dBooom! Boom! Boo-booom! Boooooom!The explosions that covered the Mana Golem were so intense that they shook the whole ruin. The Mana Golem\u2019s body was severely damaged, tearing a hole through a section of its chest. The hole exposed a large blue internal organ\u2014the golem\u2019s mana heart. A golem\u2019s mana heart, also known as a core, was what gave it free will and the power to move around.\u201cI, feel my body is light,\u201d the Mana Golem said, suddenly moving with great agility. Its sudden increase in speed was because it had lost significant portions of the heavy, burdensome stone guarding its mana heart.Kang Yoon-Soo stopped using \u2018Corpse Explosion\u2019 and gave another command. \u201cFocus your attacks on the Mana Golem\u2019s heart.\u201dThe Undead Ahinkuls crawled up the arms of the Mana Golem, attacking its mana heart at Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s command.\u201cDamn it! Let\u2019s die today!\u201d Henrick shouted, taking out wooden archer dolls and wooden thief dolls. He commanded the dolls through his mana threads to rain arrows and daggers down toward the golem\u2019s mana heart.\u201cI, am angry,\u201d the Mana Golem said, rampaging because of the damage it had received.Boom! Boom!The Mana Golem punched the ground numerous times. Every punch that hit the ground shook the entire room, and numerous undead fell to the ground like flies whenever it swung its arms in a rampage.Kang Yoon-Soo approached Iris and suddenly hugged her from behind. Iris turned to look at him with eyes filled with curiosity.\u201cI heard this act is done by lovers. Kang Yoon-Soo, do you love me?\u201d Iris asked.\u201cNo,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied as he lifted Iris up, and he then called for White.White immediately dashed toward Kang Yoon-Soo at his call, and he and Iris both mounted the beast. White ran at a frightening speed toward the rampaging Mana Golem, and Kang Yoon-Soo whispered in Iris\u2019 ears while still hugging her, \u201cBon appetit.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Iris asked with an innocent expression.The Mana Golem\u2019s fist landed where they had been moments ago.Boom!The ground broke apart into ice fragments because of the tremendous impact of the Mana Golem\u2019s fist, scattering all over the place.Kang Yoon-Soo stood up while atop White, throwing Iris toward the Mana Golem. As Iris flew toward the Mana Golem, she thought seriously, \u2018Flying through the air feels so good.\u2019Bam!Kang Yoon-Soo had thrown Iris so accurately that she landed directly inside the now-open area on the golem\u2019s chest, where its mana heart was exposed. Iris stared at the mana heart, which was giving off a blue glow. She then asked the golem, \u201cCan I eat this?\u201d\u201cNo, never!\u201d the Mana Golem shouted, slamming its large hand into its chest to chase the intruder away.However, Iris ducked and avoided the golem\u2019s attempts. She said as if she were facing a severe dilemma, \u201cKang Yoon-Soo, this child is telling me it does not want me to eat its heart.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t listen to bad kids,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.\u201cI see,\u201d Iris said. She bit down on the Mana Golem\u2019s heart as soon as Kang Yoon-Soo finished speaking, like an obedient child following the orders of a parent.The Mana Golem thrashed around and attempted to drag the intruder out of its core, but all of its attempts to remove the intruder were futile. It did not take long for Iris to devour the golem\u2019s mana heart with her innate \u2018Predator\u2019 skill.\u201cI, have completed my calling!\u201d the Mana Golem shouted, before exploding from the removal of its heart.Kaboom![You have defeated the Mana Golem (Boss, Level 224).][Your level has increased by 7.]The giant golem turned into a pile of rock as its fragments scattered all over the place. Iris, who was in the epicenter of the explosion, was thrown back and seemed about to fall dangerously to the ground. However, Henrick, who was near the area she had been about to land in, caught her just in time.\u201cUmph! Is it because you eat too many weird things? Why are you so heavy?!\u201d Henrick complained.\u201cYour words just now made me feel bad for some reason. Can I eat your heart, Henrick?\u201d Iris asked with an innocent look on her face.\u201cDo you want to die?\u201d Henrick responded.Kang Yoon-Soo immediately rushed toward the Frost Demon and Shaneth while Henrick and Iris were busy bickering. His steps were much more hurried than usual. He thought, \u2018It took more time than I thought it would.\u2019The Frost Demon was not a monster that could be faced alone for a long period of time\u2014at least in the current situation. There was no guarantee that Shaneth would be able to hold on even if the other clan members joined the battle and helped her out.***The Frost Demon took in a deep breath, before letting out a deafening shout that rang throughout the room and even shook the walls. \u201cAbsolute Zero!\u201dA blue stream of magic spread around the Frost Demon. The temperature suddenly dropped sharply; even the air around the demon started to freeze, and the Salamander\u2019s flames that enveloped the weapons of the clan members slowly started to die.Sally, who had been providing the flames to the clan members from behind their lines, suddenly turned pale and shivered. She stuttered, \u201cI-It\u2019s too\u2026 c-cold\u2026! I-It hurts\u2026 P-papa\u2026 Mam-a\u2026!\u201dHer body started to slowly fade before she completely disappeared\u2014she had been forcefully returned to the summon dimension. The Frost Demon\u2019s magic that had dragged the temperature down to freezing levels by force had caused significant damage to the Salamander.\u201cM-my body!\u201d\u201cMy feet are stuck to the ground!\u201dThe clan members could not move their legs and were frozen on the spot. Of course, the flames that surrounded Shaneth had long since disappeared.\u201cKyaaah!\u201dA desperate scene greeted Kang Yoon-Soo when he reached the place where Shaneth and the Frost Demon had been fighting. The Frost Demon held Shaneth by the hair, while Shaneth, who looked pale and haggard, tried to resist the demon.\u201cBe my flesh and blood,\u201d the Frost Demon began, preparing to stab Shaneth in her stomach with its claw. Suddenly, however, a bolt of lightning struck the demon in the back of its head.Bzzzt!The lightning numbed the back of the demon\u2019s head, but it was not able to inflict any significant damage. The Frost Demon turned around before throwing Shaneth to the side angrily, looking for the perpetrator who had dared to hit it. Its eyes opened in surprise as it saw the mana fragments that covered Kang Yoon-Soo.\u201cT-those are\u2026 fragments of the Mana Golem!\u201d the Frost Demon exclaimed in surprise.\u201cI killed it,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said, slowly walking toward Shaneth as she lay collapsed on the ground and staring at her bloodied abdomen. Thankfully, the wound was not that deep, and Kang Yoon-Soo took out a vial of healing potion and applied it to her.\u201cK-kang Yoon-Soo\u2026?\u201d Shaneth moaned weakly.\u201cIt\u2019s alright,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo reassured her before drawing his sword and walking toward the Frost Demon. He said in a bitterly cold voice, \u201cYou will die by my hands.\u201d\u201cHa! What a joke!\u201d The Frost Demon snickered, charging toward Kang Yoon-Soo.Kang Yoon-Soo lowered his stance and avoided the Frost Demon\u2019s charge, immediately counterattacking by stabbing his sword into the demon\u2019s chest and using his skill. \u201cAbyssal Sword.\u201dHe focused on the demon\u2019s weak spots and unleashed a barrage of strikes against them, and simultaneously stabbed his staff into the ground. \u201cRelease Lightning.\u201dBzzzzzzt!A ferocious electrical current crawled across the ground, shattering the ice that was tying the clan members down.Durman rubbed his hands that had gone numb because of the current and complained, \u201cAigoo! That stung!\u201d\u201cEveryone! Charge at the Frost Demon!\u201d a clan member shouted, and the Martial Blood Clan\u2019s attack resumed. They once again coated their weapons in holy water and reentered their formation to keep the Frost Demon at bay. Meanwhile, Henrick, Iris, and even the undead joined the Frost Demon raid.\u201cThread Tying!\u201d Henrick\u2019s mana thread shot out toward the Frost Demon, binding its body.\u201cInsolent fools!\u201d the Frost Demon roared. It started dragging Henrick around in its attempts to resist being bound by the mana thread.Henrick was taken aback by the immense power of the Frost Demon, but Iris tightly grabbed his shoulder and started to pull him back. \u201cO-ouch!\u201d Henrick cried out in pain.Iris and the Frost Demon were now playing tug-of-war with Henrick in the middle, but the doppelganger was not giving an inch to the demon. In fact, Iris even had the luxury of smiling at Kang Yoon-Soo.\u201cThe golem\u2019s heart tasted good,\u201d Iris said with a satisfied look on her face. She had used her innate ability, \u2018Predator\u2019, to absorb the immense strength of the Mana Golem.\u201cO-ouch! You stupid punk! My arms are going to tear off!\u201d Henrick cursed and cried out, and tears started welling up in his eyes.Kang Yoon-Soo dashed toward the bound-up Frost Demon before pointing his staff at it and calling out, \u201cRelease Lightning.\u201dThe powerful bolt of lightning struck the Frost Demon dead center in its chest. The Frost Demon writhed in agony, and the pain it felt was clearly visible on its face.\u201cYou! You insolent\u2026!\u201d the Frost Demon cried out, attempting to bite Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s left arm. However, Kang Yoon-Soo was a step faster, withdrawing his arm just before the demon was able to sink its fangs in. Still, the demon managed to bite the tip of the Staff of Lightning.It was an unexpected turn of events, but Kang Yoon-Soo calmly muttered, \u201cRelease Lightning.\u201dThe lightning rushed into the Frost Demon, doing massive damage to its insides. However, after using its final charge, the staff shattered under the demon\u2019s fangs.Cr-rack!\u201cDie!\u201d the Frost Demon screamed, biting off a chunk of Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s arm.The demon tore off Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s flesh and blood started to flow down his arm, but Kang Yoon-Soo was unfazed, immediately leaping back and taking the Slaughterer\u2019s Bloodsword out of his backpack. He charged toward the Frost Demon, wielding Ravian\u2019s Longsword and the Slaughterer\u2019s Bloodsword in each hand.The two swords stabbed down into the Frost Demon\u2019s chest, where the Sword of the Holy Cross was embedded.\u201cG-gwuaaak!\u201d the Frost Demon screamed as its chest was ripped apart. Finally, the demon fell to the ground and breathed its last.The entire party was overjoyed, shouting in triumph and relishing their victory over the mighty demon.\u201cWe won!\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re the first on the continent to raid a demon!\u201dIt was at that moment, when the group was drunk on their victory, that the cold, lifeless corpse of the demon started to squirm violently. The dark, black figure of a corrupted soul flowed out of it. The soul laughed arrogantly and said,[Tsk tsk\u2026 Did you think it would be that easy to win against me? I apologize if I got your hopes up.]A chilling wind incomparable to the cold the group had experienced until now blew around the corrupted soul.[The real fight starts now!]The words spoken by the demonic spirit made the group tense up. The vicious demon that hungered for human flesh and blood had turned into a spirit after dying, continuing to thirst for life. They all despaired at the sight unfolding before their eyes.It was impossible to deal any damage to spirit-type monsters with their current weapons. It would be a different case if they had holy magic or black magic, but they had reached the point of exhausting their supply of holy water. There was no way for them to face the demonic spirit.The spirit arrogantly smirked as if to show that the end was near for them before shouting proudly,[This is immortality! I will still fight after death, and I will forever keep the great treasures of Pandemonium!]Kang Yoon-Soo suddenly walked up to the demonic spirit and said in a low voice, \u201cI won\u2019t fight you anymore.\u201d[Ha! Have you finally decided to obediently offer up your flesh and blood to me?]Kang Yoon-Soo shook his head and answered, \u201cNo.\u201d He extended his right hand toward the demonic spirit, and the Ring of Life Suppression on his finger glowed as he muttered, \u201cSoul Extraction.\u201d[Gwuaaaaak!]The demonic spirit was instantly sucked into the ring.[You have defeated the Frost Demon (Boss, Level 261).][Your level has increased by 27.]The party stared at Kang Yoon-Soo in disbelief.The man who had just ended the battle in the strangest fashion stared back at them before asking, \u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

That was the result of the raid under Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s leadership.\u201cYour clan can take the Mana Golem\u2019s body,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.\u201cWhat? Can we really do that?\u201d Jiang Ren-Wei asked in surprise.The body of the Mana Golem consisted of mana stones; those magical stones not only aided in mana regeneration, but were also traded at premium prices for their other uses.\u2018There are thousands of other ways to earn gold anyway. What\u2019s more important now is to obtain more precious items.\u2019 Kang Yoon-Soo nodded and replied, \u201cBut in return, the corpse of the Frost Demon belongs to me.\u201d\u201cI understand. We would have no idea what to do with the corpse of a demon even if we took it anyway,\u201d Jiang Ren-Wei responded.The Martial Blood Clan members gathered around the shattered body of the Mana Golem. They used their weapons like pickaxes, starting to diligently mine mana stones from the golem.Jiang Ren-Wei looked at his clan members before carefully saying, \u201cIt seems as if it\u2019ll be difficult to raid the ruin\u2019s boss monster at this rate.\u201dHe sounded as if he had put a lot of thought into it before saying those words, adding, \u201cNot only has our supply of holy water run out, our supply of frost antidotes and healing potions are exhausted as well. Not to mention that a few of our clan members died in this raid. Of course, they were all prepared for it, but everyone is exhausted now after the battle. I believe it\u2019s foolish for us to charge toward the ruin\u2019s boss in this state. I\u2019m sorry, but our clan plans to end the raid here.\u201d\u201cSure,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo nonchalantly replied.Jiang Ren-Wei was slightly taken aback at Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s reply, saying, \u201cI was 90% certain that you would rebuke me for being too timid or say I lacked credentials as a leader\u2026 but you seem to be pretty cool about it?\u201d\u201cAn unprepared raid only brings casualties,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.\u201cThank you for your understanding.\u201d Jiang Ren-Wei bowed with a bright expression of relief on his face before adding, \u201cWe\u2019ll head out first then. We still need to take care of our comrades\u2019 bodies, and we\u2019ll leave the ruin door open, so feel free to follow us out.\u201d The Martial Blood Clan members gathered up the deceased and the mana stones before exiting the ruin.\u201cI\u2019ll come to you later for your right arm,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said. He walked toward Shaneth and asked in his usual cold, indifferent tone, \u201cHow\u2019s your wound?\u201d\u201cThankfully it wasn\u2019t that deep,\u201d Shaneth replied, looking ghastly pale.Henrick, who had been playing with the fragments of ice lying around, suddenly spoke up. \u201cIt\u2019s a relief that\u2019s all that happened after getting caught by a demon, and you didn\u2019t spill your guts out or anything\u2026\u201dIris, who was standing beside Henrick, looked up to him and asked, \u201cGuts? Are those edible?\u201d\u201c\u2026is that all you think about?\u201d Henrick asked with a sigh.Kang Yoon-Soo took the healing potions meant for him from his waist and told Shaneth, \u201cRemove your shirt.\u201d\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Shaneth asked, just in case she had heard him wrong.\u201cI\u2019ll apply the potion,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said indifferently.\u201cN-no\u2026 I can do it alone\u2026\u201d Shaneth replied.\u201cYou did it for me before,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.Shaneth hesitated for a moment before entrusting her body to Kang Yoon-Soo. Meanwhile, Kang Yoon-Soo was deep in thought as he rubbed the potion on her wounds. \u2018I can\u2019t turn time back if Shaneth dies this time around.\u2019That was not only the case for Shaneth, but also for everyone else. If someone died this time, that was the end for them. There was no way for Kang Yoon-Soo to go back in time and prevent their deaths anymore. The same was also true for Kang Yoon-Soo. \u2018I need to take risks, but I have to be careful at the same time.\u2019Kang Yoon-Soo was hesitant about visiting the dangerous places he had encountered in his previous lives. That was the case for the lair of the Dragon of Destruction and the Magic Tower of the Giants. However, he needed to visit those places for their rewards if this life was going to be his last chance. \u2018It seems I\u2019ll have to go to all of the dangerous places on the continent.\u2019It was while Kang Yoon-Soo was deep in thought that Iris tilted her head while looking at what they were doing. She asked, \u201cI believe that is what lovers do. Kang Yoon-Soo, do you love Shaneth?\u201d\u201cYeah,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied nonchalantly.\u201c\u2026\u201dKang Yoon-Soo stood up while the party was still shocked at his response, and slowly walked toward the Frost Demon\u2019s corpse. The Sword of the Holy Cross easily slipped out of the demon\u2019s corpse once he pulled it out. \u2018We wouldn\u2019t have been able to fight against the Frost Demon if I hadn\u2019t stabbed this sword into its chest in advance,\u2019 he thought.That was how powerful the demon race was, and the fact that the Sword of the Holy Cross had lost its luster and its edges were now dull was proof. The sword had sealed the demon\u2019s powers, but it had lost its holy powers as well. \u2018It was a waste to use this item like this, but there\u2019s nothing I can do about it. It did its job, at least.\u2019Kang Yoon-Soo threw the Sword of the Holy Cross aside and ripped open the demon\u2019s chest. Unfortunately, the demon\u2019s heart had disintegrated because of the holy powers of the sword. \u2018What a shame. It would have been nice to feed it to Iris. She would have been able to use powerful ice magics then.\u2019Kang Yoon-Soo found a couple of items after he skinned the demon\u2019s hide.[Frost Demon\u2019s Leather]Leather that is stronger than that of any other creature in this world. It does not contain any magic, as it belonged to a lesser demon. It is a top-quality crafting material.[Frost Demon\u2019s Winter Fragment]A jewel fragment that contains cold and corrupted power. Its use is unknown.Demon leather was a top-quality crafting material. It did not only increase defensive power, but also increased the magic resistance of the armor it was crafted into.Kang Yoon-Soo stored all of the items into his backpack and turned around toward his party members before saying, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe party was silently staring at him, and Shaneth\u2019s face was a ripe red as she kept stealing glances at Kang Yoon-Soo. Kang Yoon-Soo asked curiously, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cI know it might sound old now, but it really is hard to find someone as weird as you on this continent,\u201d Henrick said with a sigh.They left the hidden room, and Kang Yoon-Soo, who was standing at the forefront, walked in a different direction than when they had come in.\u201cHey, that\u2019s the way down to the basement and not the way out,\u201d Henrick called out.\u201cI know,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said, adding, \u201cWe\u2019re going straight to the heart of the ruin.\u201d***There were no other monsters on the lower floor of the ruin, but the entire floor was filled with a cold that chilled the party down to their bones.\u2018I want to raid the boss of the Winterkill Ruin, but that\u2019s a stretch right now,\u2019 Kang Yoon-Soo thought. The boss of the Winterkill Ruin was an eight meter tall Ice Giant, and it was far too risky for them to face the tough and tenacious giant in their current state, just as Jiang Ren-Wei had said.They soon reached a large door they believed was the entrance to the heart of the ruin, and a pale white giant was sitting in front of it.Shaneth carefully asked in a whisper, so as to not get caught by the giant, \u201cDo you plan to fight that boss monster head on?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo shook his head and added, \u201cWe\u2019ll just pass by it.\u201dIt had been written in Rekimond\u2019s journal that he had shone a torch at the giant before passing by it to enter the heart of the ruin; that was how weak the Ice Giant was against fire.\u201cSummon Sally,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.Sally, who had forcefully been sent back to the summoned dimension, appeared. She sniffled as she hugged Kang Yoon-Soo and cried, \u201cPapa\u2026! Sniff! I was so cold and scared!\u201d\u201cI know,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.Sally started to cry and throw a tantrum. \u201cHing! Sally wants to rest. It was really cold a while ago!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll make you a sibling now,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.\u201cReally?\u201d Sally\u2019s eyes brightened and she looked at him with sparkling eyes.Kang Yoon-Soo nodded and said, \u201cYes.\u201d\u201cHooray! I love you, papa!\u201d Sally said gleefully as she clung to Kang Yoon-Soo.Iris looked confused, asking, \u201cDoes Sally love Kang Yoon-Soo too?\u201d\u201cYes! Sally loves papa!\u201d Sally replied.\u201cHmm\u2026 Love is quite a mysterious thing,\u201d Iris said, falling deep into thought.Sally raised both of her arms and spewed fire out, and the Ice Giant slowly rose from its spot.\u201cI, kill intruder,\u201d the giant said, charging toward the pillar of fire.Kang Yoon-Soo and the others took the chance to sneak into the heart of the ruin. It was a cold place that housed a hexagon-shaped crystal. The bitter chill of the Winterkill Ruin flowed out of that crystal.\u201cC-cold!\u201d Sally said, shivering as the temperature dropped the closer they went to the crystal.An altar that seemed similar to the one they had encountered previously towered above them. Atop it was a cold, shining crown.Kang Yoon-Soo obtained the treasure of the Winterkill Ruin.[Frozen Crown]Rating: RareMagic Power (Ice Attribute): 52A crown made up of souls frozen by the cold. It is presumed to have been used by a king from a cold country. It is an item liked by an arrogant spirit.[The Winterkill Ruin has been conquered.][Conqueror: Kang Yoon-Soo][Rank 1 Achievement: Shaneth Elogran][Rank 2 Achievement: Henrick Elrickerson][You have conquered the Winterkill Ruin.][You have absorbed the ruin\u2019s magic power.][Your resistance against illnesses caused by the cold has increased.][Your resistance to frostbite has increased.][You have obtained the title \u2018Explorer of Cold\u2019.][Conquered Ruins: 2][The boss monster of the ruin still survives.][The Ice Giant will return if you do not escape soon.]Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s wrist device vibrated as soon as he conquered the Winterkill Ruin.[You have completed the Legendary Quest\u2014Castle of the Dead.][7,287 undead have been freed.][The undead that will march through the continent at night will produce numerous tales.][Their new objective is to raise the strongest dragon in the continent as an undead being.][You have obtained Nakron\u2019s codex.][The Legendary Quest\u2014Desert Palace has started.]Kang Yoon-Soo took out a black crystal from his backpack. It was the mode of communication provided by the Death General Kalriven.-Lord, can you hear me?Kalriven\u2019s voice rang out from the crystal.\u201cYeah,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied dryly.-Rejoice, my lord! The seal on the Castle of the Dead has finally been released!\u201cYeah,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo repeated.-We shall depart on a journey to fulfill master Nakron\u2019s wish of raising the Deathless Dragon. It will take us to the most dangerous places on the continent, but if my lord requires our assistance, we will always be at your service!\u201cOkay,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.-Please take special care of master Nakron\u2019s codex. There is nothing more precious to a Necromancer than that.***Kang Yoon-Soo climbed down from the altar, but he did not head for the exit immediately. Instead, he stared at the hexagonal crystal that was emitting the intense cold of the Winterkill Ruin.\u201cHuh? Now that I\u2019m looking closely, isn\u2019t this Ice of Eternity?\u201d Henrick asked as he examined the crystal.Shaneth could not help but be curious, asking, \u201cWhat\u2019s Ice of Eternity?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a block of ice that lets out cold year-round. It\u2019s a very rare crafting material, and quite expensive too. It\u2019s a bit small, but it\u2019s still in good condition. Should we take some?\u201d Henrick asked, taking out his sculpting knife.Kang Yoon-Soo suddenly blocked his path and said, \u201cNo.\u201d\u201cWhy not?\u201d Henrick asked with a frown.\u201cBecause I\u2019m going to use it to create a spirit,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied. The Ice of Eternity was required to create the spirit of ice, Icicle.\u2018I have to make the ice even colder.\u2019 Kang Yoon-Soo took out his water canteen, spraying the water around the Ice of Eternity. The Ice of Eternity grew colder as the water froze up.\u201cYou have to do something,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo told Iris.Iris used her newly found immense strength to crush a block of ice and brought it to Kang Yoon-Soo. Shaneth used her scythe to cut the ice, while Henrick used his sculpting knife to trim it down. Then, they spread the pieces of ice around the Ice of Eternity, and a chill that automatically made them shiver flowed out from it.\u201cAh! Mama! Sally is too cold!\u201d Sally complained.\u201cCome here. I\u2019ll hug you,\u201d Shaneth said, consoling the poor little girl.Kang Yoon-Soo extended his right hand that had the Ring of Life Suppression on it and muttered, \u201cSpirit Creation.\u201dA dazzling, blinding light circled around the Ice of Eternity, and the silhouette of an infant was visible within it..[Please choose the gender of the Ice Spirit, Icicle. A male Icicle will have the power to bring forth a chilling disaster, but it will be cold and arrogant. On the other hand, a female Icicle will be cold and indifferent, but will be well versed in cold magic.]As opposed to Sally, whose gender had forcefully been decided, Kang Yoon-Soo had the choice to choose the gender of the spirit this time.\u201cMale,\u201d he muttered.The blinding light shot out from the Ice of Eternity as it circled.[The Ice of Eternity is a bit small.][The age of the spirit has decreased.][The charisma of the spirit has decreased. Charisma -31][The intense cold has strengthened the spirit\u2019s soul. Magic +17][The harmony between both the master and the spirit\u2019s cold personality has increased the power of the spirit. Chill +2][You can only create one spirit from each element. The chance to create an Icicle has been used.]The chill from the Ice of Eternity slowly subsided as the blinding light filled the entire room. That was the moment Icicle, the Spirit of Ice, was born.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He had platinum white hair that was neatly arranged, and his frosted clothes complemented his handsome face well. The boy seemed to be around fifteen years old, and his first words were, \u201cI am a great spirit.\u201d[You have created Icicle, the Spirit of Ice.][You may summon the spirit from the summon dimension anytime you want.][The spirit will be angry if you summon him in a hot environment.][Icicle has the ability to create special structures made out of ice.]It was Henrick and Iris\u2019 first time seeing the creation of a spirit, and they stared at him in amazement.\u201cOooh, so this is a Spirit of Ice?\u201d Henrick asked, rubbing his chin.\u201cDon\u2019t address me with those filthy lips of yours. You foolish human,\u201d Icicle arrogantly retorted.\u201cWhat did you say, you punk?\u201d Henrick shot back, furrowing his brow at the arrogant little boy\u2019s words.Icicle had a nonchalant expression that basically said, \u2018What will you do about it?\u2019 He asked haughtily, \u201cDo I have to repeat myself?\u201d\u201cThis punk\u2026 He doesn\u2019t have any manners, does he?\u201d Henrick remarked as he looked at Kang Yoon-Soo and let out a forced laugh.Then Sally, who was in Shaneth\u2019s arms, skipped toward Icicle and said with a big bright smile, \u201cHi! Nice to meet you, dongsaeng![1] I\u2019m Sally, and I\u2019m your sister!\u201dIcicle stared at Sally for a minute before frowning angrily and retorting, \u201cAre you saying someone weak and insignificant like you is my elder sister?\u201dTruthfully, if people compared how the two spirits looked, they would likely agree that Sally looked younger than the newly-born spirit.Sally balled her fists as she puffed up her cheeks and angrily exclaimed, \u201cSally isn\u2019t weak! I\u2019m not insignificant either!\u201d\u201cWhat a joke. I can\u2019t acknowledge this,\u201d Icicle remarked.\u201cW-what?\u201d Sally was taken aback by Icicle\u2019s attitude.\u201cI\u2019d have no reason to call someone weaker than me noona[2] in the first place,\u201d Icicle said with a sigh.Tears started to form in Sally\u2019s eyes as she sniffled and said, \u201cSally\u2026 Sally is older\u2026! You\u2026 heuk\u2026 are my dongsaeng\u2026! Sally\u2026 wanted to play\u2026 heuk\u2026! and get along\u2026 with my dongsaeng\u2026 heuk!\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no reason for me to be under a spirit who\u2019s weaker than me,\u201d Icicle said coldly.\u201cUwaaaah! You\u2019re mean!\u201d Sally cried, running back into the summon dimension.Icicle was not fazed at all by Sally\u2019s tears. He turned to look at Kang Yoon-Soo and said, \u201cIt seems you\u2019re the one who created me.\u201d\u201cYeah,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.\u201cWhy do you look weak? I can\u2019t believe someone like you managed to create me,\u201d Icicle remarked disdainfully.\u201cI\u2019m stronger than you,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied emotionlessly.\u201cHa! I don\u2019t buy it!\u201d Icicle said, scoffing.Kang Yoon-Soo suddenly drew both of his swords and pushed them against Icicle\u2019s neck before the spirit even finished speaking.Icicle was surprised by the sudden movement, as even though he was a spirit, the blades would still cut him. He stuttered, \u201c\u2026I-I see that you know the basics.\u201d Despite everything, he still remembered to maintain his air of arrogance.\u201cYou\u2019re a spirit I created. I\u2019ll now give you a name,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said coldly.\u201cA-alright! Just put these swords away!\u201d Icicle exclaimed.Kang Yoon-Soo withdrew his swords, and Icicle immediately returned to his haughty, arrogant self, crossing his arms over his chest and saying, \u201cI hope it\u2019s going to be a noble name that befits a great spirit like me.\u201d\u201cAcle,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.\u201cAcle? Are you kidding me? What kind of a name is that?\u201d Icicle complained with a frown.Kang Yoon-Soo did not bother speaking as he slowly reached for his sword. Acle forcefully turned up his lips and said, \u201cIt\u2019s not a name I like, but I guess I have no choice.\u201dKang Yoon-Soo placed his finger on Acle\u2019s forehead, and Acle frowned as if to show that he felt Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s touch was unpleasant.[Acle]Level: 152Race: IcicleAge: Growing StageCharisma: 20Magic Power: 50Chill: 62Skills: Frost Shaping (Lvl3), Ice Storm (Lvl5)A spirit that is haughty and arrogant. He will never follow the instructions of someone weaker than him.\u2018Acle\u2019. Kang Yoon-Soo reminisced about the past while looking at Acle\u2019s status window. Acle was a difficult spirit to manage, but he was definitely going to be a big help in the future. However\u2026\u201cAcle,\u201d he called out to the spirit.\u201cWhat?\u201d Acle asked, sounding annoyed.\u201cDon\u2019t die in this life,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.Acle looked at Kang Yoon-Soo with a confused expression and asked, \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no need for you to sacrifice yourself for me, nor do you have to sacrifice yourself for the other spirits. You just have to do your part. That\u2019s all,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.\u201cYou\u2019re a strange human,\u201d Acle said. He continued to watch Kang Yoon-Soo with the same confused expression and added, \u201cWhy are you looking at me, someone who was just born, as if you knew me before?\u201dKang Yoon-Soo just silently looked at Acle. He had seen the boy numerous times\u2014and the sight of him dying numerous times.\u201cAcle, go to the summon dimension,\u201d he commanded.\u201cHmpf!\u201d Acle scoffed before leaving for the summon dimension.Kang Yoon-Soo had to put in the effort to shake off the nostalgic feeling he experienced.***Somewhere in a dark basement, a single light shone from a lamp, and the sound of something feasting on something filled the air.Munch\u2026 Munch\u2026Lefman, the leader of the Sunset Glass Merchant Company, slammed his fist on a table.Baaam!\u201cAre you telling me that man wasn\u2019t one of your clan members?!\u201d Lefman exclaimed angrily.\u201cDo you think we\u2019re crazy enough to cut off our cash cow? On top of that, you said he only showed you the tattoo and there was no other evidence? Also, the explosives under the building were all a lie too, right? Why would we go through such trouble just to face losses? You got scammed,\u201d a man replied.\u201cBut he knew everything about your clan, as if he were one of your members!\u201d Lefman retorted.\u201cDoesn\u2019t that mean he did a very good job scamming you?\u201d the man said, his face shrouded in darkness. The only visible thing next to him was the long leg of lamb on the dining table.Munch\u2026 Munch\u2026Lefman\u2019s temper flared even more due to the man\u2019s carefree attitude. He raged on, \u201cYou don\u2019t seem to understand the gravity of the situation!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m very well aware. Didn\u2019t you, someone who brags about having been through all sorts of things in life, get scammed by someone, and yet you\u2019re now taking it out on me?\u201d the man in the darkness said. The clan members around him all snickered.Thanks to that, Lefman\u2019s mood soured even more as he raged further, \u201cIt was an impostor who posed as one of you guys! I just lost a few hundred potions and an old carriage, but do you think this won\u2019t happen again?\u201d\u201cI want to keep teasing you, but I guess we have to stop here. Alright, we just have to catch that guy and take revenge for you, right?\u201d the man replied, raising his arms in a mocking gesture of surrender.Munch\u2026 Munch\u2026\u201cTell me, what did that guy who scammed you look like?\u201d the man asked.\u201cI\u2019m sure he was a Traveler by the looks of his wrist device. He was tall but skinny, and he had a black sword with him. He had a silver bracer and a black ring, and also a bluish bracelet with him. Also, he was expressionless,\u201d Lefman said, describing the impostor.\u201cExpressionless? How the hell is that even going to help find him?\u201d the man asked in confusion.\u201cIt\u2019s the truth. That scammer didn\u2019t change his expression once even while he was dealing with me. It was hard to believe he was a human,\u201d Lefman replied with a serious expression.However, the man appeared to be done with the conversation and said, \u201cHmm\u2026 Why don\u2019t you just tell me a ghost fucked you?\u201d His clan members all broke out into the laughter they had been holding back.Munch\u2026 Munch\u2026Lefman seemed to be tired of getting angry, as he said in a dejected tone, \u201cAnyway, you need to take care of him. This isn\u2019t about my personal vendetta. If you let this guy be, he\u2019s going to cause a big problem in the future.\u201d\u201cNow that you mention it, I\u2019m curious as to what that guy looks like. Should I try meeting him?\u201d the man remarked.\u201cCan you find him as soon as possible?\u201d Lefman asked.\u201cIf he\u2019s still in the capital, I can find him in half a day,\u201d the man replied.Munch\u2026 Munch\u2026Lefman looked exhausted, but he suddenly asked, \u201cThat\u2019s that, but what are you eating this whole time?\u201d\u201cWho knows? What do you think I\u2019m eating?\u201d the man asked playfully.\u201cYou\u2019ve been grinding your teeth against something long for a while now. Is that a carrot or a cucumber?\u201d Lefman asked.\u201cPuhahahaha!\u201d The man laughed hysterically at Lefman\u2019s words.Lefman felt a headache starting after the man\u2019s sudden outburst of laughter. No one was normal in that clan, and he never would have gotten involved with the Black Tiger Clan if not for the profits from the drug trade.Munch\u2026 Munch\u2026Lefman hurriedly rose up from his seat, extending his hand and saying, \u201cAnyway, I look forward to your cooperation, Yu Si-Do.\u201dThe man in the darkness was the leader of the Black Tiger Clan, Yu Si-Do. His hand slowly approached, before he grabbed Lefman\u2019s hand and shook it.At that moment, Lefman felt sick and he wanted to throw up, but he used all of his willpower to keep the nauseated feeling down. The hand that had shaken his was missing a middle finger, as if someone or something had munched on it.***The smithy was usually a crowded place that was always hustling and bustling with people going around and doing their own work, but today, everyone in it was fixated on one spot.Kang Yoon-Soo was carefully sewing an arm onto someone with the Body Crafting Kit.\u201cTry and see how it feels,\u201d he said.Jiang Ren-Wei opened and closed his right hand. He swung his shoulder in a large motion, and he even poked his arm to test how it felt. He said, sounding fascinated, \u201cThis is amazing. I don\u2019t feel like a one-armed man at all. It seems I can also move my fingers according to my will. I don\u2019t feel any pain, but it still feels as if this has been my arm all this time.\u201d\u201cOf course, who made that arm in the first place?\u201d Henrick remarked, snickering. The one who had procured the arm from the morgue and patched it up again was none other than he.Jiang Ren-Wei looked on in surprise at the right arm he was able to move according to his will. Durman, who was watching his boss get so excited over his new arm, felt a tingling sensation in his nostrils as he remarked, \u201cAigoo. How will we ever repay this favor? Our boss can now live normally like other people, and he doesn\u2019t have to be called a disabled person anymore!\u201d\u201cHey, Durman, a disability is nothing to be ashamed of,\u201d Jiang Ren-Wei rebuked him.\u201cYou know I didn\u2019t mean it like that\u2026\u201d Durman said, pouting.Jiang Ren-Wei stood up and bowed from the waist down toward Kang Yoon-Soo and Henrick. He said, \u201cThank you so much. I don\u2019t know how I can ever repay you. Please tell me, whether it\u2019s money, items, or anything I can do.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t need anything now,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said nonchalantly.\u201cUhm\u2026 But\u2026\u201d Jiang Ren-Wei looked troubled by Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s words.However, Kang Yoon-Soo soon added, \u201cBut help me whenever I ask for it.\u201d\u201cAre you sure that will suffice?\u201d Jiang Ren-Wei asked.\u201cYeah,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.Jiang Ren-Wei and Durman thanked them multiple times. Kang Yoon-Soo and Henrick hurriedly left the smithy, as the two men from the Martial Blood Clan seemed to be on the verge of giving them all of their items. They exited into the busy streets.\u201cTo think you would refuse to accept a reward,\u201d Henrick said with a smirk.\u201cIt\u2019s better to keep it for later,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo responded.The two men entered the inn, and a brunette woman ran toward them huffing and puffing. Shaneth exclaimed urgently, \u201cCome quick! Something happened!\u201d\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Henrick asked.The next words out of Shaneth\u2019s mouth were unbelievable. \u201cIris unni collapsed after eating a bar of soap!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d***\u201cI should detest soap from now on,\u201d Iris grumbled angrily as she sat down. The inn was not so busy at this hour, so the only ones sitting at the table were Iris and Henrick.\u201cI wonder\u2026 In which universe does a bar of soap look appetizing?\u201d Henrick asked in a teasing, mocking tone.\u201cHenrick, I am really upset, and teasing me right now does not make me feel any better,\u201d Iris replied.\u201cWhen did our little miss grow up so fast? You now know how to get mad?\u201d Henrick teased her once again.Shaneth came over with a cup of water and asked, \u201cSo, did you manage to fix Mr. Jiang Ren-Wei\u2019s new arm at the smithy?\u201d\u201cOf course. I made that arm, after all,\u201d Henrick said. proudly\u201cWow, that\u2019s amazing. So you can restore any damaged body part with the Body Crafting Kit then? In theory, you could fix all the illnesses in this world, right?\u201d Shaneth asked.\u201cNo. I need to reiterate, there\u2019s a huge side-effect if you fail to do it properly. There\u2019s a chance that if you fail to properly affix the body part, that specific part will feel excruciating pain for the rest of that person\u2019s life. There have also been some instances where a monster body part was affixed instead of a doll part, but the success rate of that is extremely low,\u201d Henrick explained.\u201cThe Body Crafting Kit is really an amazing heirloom,\u201d Shaneth said in amazement.\u201cOf course, but I\u2019ve always wondered\u2026 Why do you have so many questions?\u201d Henrick asked with a frown.\u201c\u2026Is it a crime to be curious?\u201d Shaneth replied while pouting.\u201cIt\u2019s a crime to bother me,\u201d Henrick shot back.The barmaid brought the food they had ordered, spreading steaming veal stew, freshly baked hot bread, and fresh fruits out on the table.Kang Yoon-Soo suddenly said to the barmaid, \u201cThe alcohol.\u201d\u201cAh! I\u2019m sorry, I forgot. I\u2019ll bring it right away,\u201d the barmaid said with a bright smile. She went back to the bar and brought out mugs of ale. Kang Yoon-Soo took a swig out of the mug before starting to eat, taking a big spoonful of the veal stew as Henrick watched on with a shocked expression.\u201cIt\u2019s strange to see you eating so well. Were you that hungry today?\u201d Henrick asked, continuing to stare at Kang Yoon-Soo.\u201cThe food in front of us is laced with strong sleeping pills, and that barmaid is a member of the Black Tiger Clan. There are assassins in the kitchen right now planning to kidnap us,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said calmly.The party immediately stopped eating. Henrick and Shaneth almost spat out their food in surprise.\u201cWhat do you mean by that?!\u201d Shaneth exclaimed, panicking.\u201cIt\u2019s alright. You won\u2019t die,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said calmly.\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say anything if you knew it was laced with sleeping pills?!\u201d Henrick panicked as well.\u201cBecause we\u2019ll get kidnapped on purpose,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied calmly once again.Severe drowsiness engulfed them as soon as they finished speaking. They did not even have the time to stick their fingers in their mouth to try and make themselves throw up the food they had eaten. Kang Yoon-Soo peacefully closed his eyes, but the others glared at him with eyes full of resentment.\u201cPlease\u2026 tell us\u2026 things\u2026 like this\u2026 in\u2026 advance\u2026!\u201d Shaneth complained.\u201cYou fucking\u2026 punk\u2026!\u201d Henrick cursed.\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 sleepy\u2026\u201d Iris\u2026 was Iris.They all collapsed face-first onto the table.1. \u2019Dongsaeng\u2019 is what one would call a younger sibling in Korean. It\u2019s a gender neutral term. \u261c2. \u2019Noona\u2019 is what a boy would call an elder sister. It\u2019s specifically used by boys to refer to older girls. \u261cPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It had met its demise at the hands of the Demon Lord, and Kang Yoon-Soo looked around at the scene that was so familiar to him.\u2018This world met its demise as well. Now it\u2019s time for me to die at the hands of the Demon Lord and regress.\u2019It was an undeniable truth that was more certain than anything else. Kang Yoon-Soo was standing alone atop a cliff high above the ground when a voice suddenly whispered in his ears.[Child, this will be your final life.]When he heard the voice, Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s shoulders shook as he suddenly came to realize something.\u2018That\u2019s right. This is my final chance. Why did I forget about that?\u2019\u2018I have to prepare for this one.\u2019The voice that spoke to him was familiar. It was the same voice that had spoken to him in the swamp where the Mudgems dwelled, and the same one that had spoken to him in the Hatar Mountains. It was that feminine voice that had warned him of an impending disaster.[Save the world, and then save me. It\u2019s time to bring an end to your long and arduous journey.]\u201cWho\u2026 are you\u2026?\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo asked, but the voice no longer replied. The blinding light enveloped him before completely engulfing him.***Kang Yoon-Soo opened his eyes, thinking, \u2018Was it a dream?\u2019He looked around the dark surroundings and noticed that he was in a cage, with his body bound up in chains. \u2018This must be the basement prison in the headquarters of the Black Tiger Clan.\u2019A huge warden stood in front of Kang Yoon-Soo from outside the cage, letting out a sinister laugh. He asked, \u201cAre you up? You won\u2019t believe how much I was looking forward to interrogating you. Heh.\u201d\u201cWe finally meet, Antoine,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.\u201cHuh? What did you say?\u201d the warden asked in surprise.\u201cDon\u2019t you remember me? Well, I guess I look different now. It\u2019s me, Kilton. Your older brother, whom you got separated from in the slums of Rimahill,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said in a soft, gentle voice.\u201cWhat are you talking about?! My brother was sold off as a slave when I was nine years old!\u201d the warden shouted in a trembling voice.\u201cI\u2019m alive. I changed how I looked and put on a fake wrist device to look like a Traveler so I could escape from my owner,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo continued in his fake tone.\u201cDon\u2019t bullshit me! Why should I believe that\u2019s even possible?!\u201d Antoine shouted.\u201cUncle Carlton was the only one in our family who had magician blood in him. I asked for his help to change how I look. You might have forgotten about me, but I haven\u2019t forgotten you even for a moment. Antoine, I\u2019m talking about the warm memories we had of ripping the guts out of cats and torturing that little bitch by ripping out her hair,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.\u201cN-no\u2026 It can\u2019t be\u2026 Hyung[1]? Is it really you, hyung?\u201d Antoine\u2019s voice trembled. Kang Yoon-Soo nodded.Antoine shook his head in shock and disbelief, but he urgently asked, \u201cThen tell me our password! The password we shared when we were younger!\u201d\u201cOur lifelong goal is to torture the Saintess, the Goddess, and the Princess at once,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.\u201cI-it\u2019s real! You are my hyung!\u201d Antoine exclaimed, hurriedly opening the prison doors. The huge warden bawled his eyes out as he ran toward Kang Yoon-Soo and screamed, \u201cHyung!\u201dKwachik!Kang Yoon-Soo hurriedly got up and headbutted Antoine, who collapsed on the floor with his eyes rolled back. He used his foot to take the key hanging on Antoine\u2019s waist, then released himself from the chain wrapped around him.\u201cYour brother raped and tortured his master\u2019s daughter as soon as he was bought, and he eventually died after getting stabbed,\u201d he said.He left the prison, finding his dimension bag and two swords hanging on the wall. He collected his things as he slowly walked through the corridor, thinking, \u2018This is building C. The Black Tiger Clan locked me and Iris up in the same building, while Shaneth was in building A and Henrick was in building B.\u201dHe planned to rescue Iris first on the way to rescue the others. Suddenly, he heard footsteps from the other side of the corridor. He quickly hid behind a wall as he drew the tattoo of the Black Tiger Clan on the back of his hand with the Body Crafting Kit, then quickly ran toward the incoming clan member and said, \u201cOne of the guys escaped.\u201d\u201cWhat? Damn it! Is that true?\u201d the vicious-looking clan member asked as he passed by Kang Yoon-Soo and headed for the prison.\u201cNo,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said, quickly slamming the hilt of his sword in the back of the man\u2019s neck. The clan member collapsed to the ground after getting hit in a vital spot.Heok!Thud!Kang Yoon-Soo met with four Black Tiger Clan members and knocked them all out using the same method. When he entered the prison where Iris was being held, he saw Iris standing in the middle surrounded by nine Black Tiger Clan members collapsed on the floor. She calmly said, \u201cOh, Kang Yoon-Soo.\u201d\u2018Was Iris this strong at this point in time?\u2019 Kang Yoon-Soo thought. He asked in surprise, \u201cWhat happened here?\u201d\u201cI woke up to find them wanting to peek under my skirt. So I pulled the chains to resist and they ended up getting knocked out on the floor,\u201d Iris said calmly.The Black Tiger Clan members were at least Level 200, but to think that she had easily subdued these people? Kang Yoon-Soo was deep in thought for a moment before asking, \u201cDo you still have the characteristics of the Mana Golem you absorbed?\u201d\u201cIndeed. Everything is so light,\u201d Iris said as she easily swung a heavy chain.\u201cDon\u2019t eat any other hearts for now. That strength will come in very handy,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.It was inevitable for Iris to possess monstrous strength, because the golem\u2019s explosive power had been added to the doppelganger\u2019s innate strength.Iris looked sad to hear Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s words and complained, \u201cDo not eat any more hearts? How could Kang Yoon-Soo say something so cruel as if it were nothing?\u201d\u201cYou can eat other things,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.\u201cHmm\u2026 Then in return, could Kang Yoon-Soo prepare delicious foods for me?\u201d Iris asked, greatly expectant.\u201cI don\u2019t cook,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied coldly.\u201cYou are really, really mean,\u201d Iris said with a pout.\u201c\u2026I\u2019ll ask Shaneth to bake you an apple pie later,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said, barely managing to calm down Iris whose eyes were welling up with tears.The two left the prison cell and went out into the corridor. The Black Tiger Clan had renovated an abandoned prison and turned it into their headquarters, which was why the basement of their headquarters was wide and the way around it was complicated like a maze.\u2018I can proceed with the plan faster if Iris\u2019 absorbed trait is her monstrous strength,\u2019 Kang Yoon-Soo thought. He kicked down the door in front of him, and inside, three vicious-looking clan members were smoking cigars while playing cards.\u201cWho the hell are you guys?\u201d one of the clan members asked.\u201cNone of your business,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.One of the clan members scoffed, but the hilt of a sword flew toward him and smacked him dead center in the forehead. The two remaining clan members pulled out their weapons, but they were easily subdued by Iris\u2019 monstrous strength. After the pair easily subdued the three clan members, Kang Yoon-Soo pointed toward the ventilation fan and said, \u201cIris, pull it out.\u201dIris easily pulled out the ventilation fan along with its metal frame using one hand. There was now enough space for one adult to crawl into it. She said with a nod, \u201cI see that you plan to secretly infiltrate where they are holding Shaneth and Henrick through this vent.\u201dHowever, contrary to her expectations, Kang Yoon-Soo replied, \u201cNo.\u201d He shouted loudly into the vent, \u201cCome! Over here!\u201dSoon after, a loud thump reverberated from within the vent, and a man suddenly popped up covered in black oil sludge\u2014it was Henrick.\u201cAigoo. My back is killing me!\u201d Henrick complained.Iris stared at Henrick, her eyes filled with curiosity as she asked, \u201cWhy did you come out from there, Henrick?\u201d\u201cI followed the usual scenario when the protagonist escapes from prison. After all, aren\u2019t these vents made to be used by escapees during a prison break?\u201d Henrick remarked with a smirk on his smudged-up face.\u201cYou would have been bound up in chains. How did you escape with the guard watching over you?\u201d Iris asked, tilting her head.\u201cI removed my hand and wiggled it out of the chains, then secretly controlled my dolls to knock the guard out cold. But how the hell are you two together? Where\u2019s Shaneth?\u201d Henrick asked.\u201cShe\u2019ll soon join us,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied. He extended his right hand and said, \u201cSummon Sally.\u201dA beautiful young girl appeared as a flame vortex spun in mid-air. However, the girl seemed upset, as her cheeks were puffed up for some reason.\u201cPapa! Sally is mad!\u201d Sally complained.\u201cWhy?\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo asked in an uninterested tone.\u201cAcle is looking down on me!\u201d Sally protested, expressing how angry she was. She continued, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t play with Sally, and he always ignores me too! He looks down on me, and refuses to call me noona! Acle is a really bad dongsaeng! I hate him!\u201d\u201cTake a look at this. Even spirits don\u2019t get along well if they\u2019re siblings,\u201d Henrick said with a snicker.Kang Yoon-Soo looked at Sally and said, \u201cWe don\u2019t have time right now. Blow fire into the vent, as much as you possibly can.\u201dSally pouted to express her discontent at Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s indifference, but she did as he commanded nevertheless without complaining. She transformed into her Salamander form and breathed her flames out.Fwoooooo!The flame rode the vent networks and spread all over the basement, and the sound of explosions followed soon after.Booom! Booom!\u201cW-what? What are these explosions?\u201d Henrick asked in surprise.\u201cA few of the rooms here are used as gas torture chambers,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.\u201cWhat? Then aren\u2019t we in danger as well?\u201d Henrick asked nervously.\u201cThe basement will be engulfed in flames in a bit,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said nonchalantly. Sure enough, the basement of the Black Tiger Clan\u2019s headquarters was soon filled with smoke and flames.\u201cThe gas chamber exploded! Head up right now if you want to live!\u201dThe clan members were in disarray as they all rushed up the stairs. Suddenly, one of the pillars supporting the ceiling melted and collapsed.Booom!Their only escape route was now blocked by the collapsed pillar, and the Black Tiger Clan cursed in despair as their only escape route was now gone.\u201cSomebody do something!\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll all burn to death at this rate! Damn it!\u201dKang Yoon-Soo walked through the panicking crowd, and a woman\u2019s hand suddenly shot out from one of the doors.\u201cPhew!\u201d Shaneth exclaimed.\u201c\u2026Don\u2019t you feel hot?\u201d Henrick asked.\u201cWhy are you asking that as if we\u2019ve just met?\u201d Shaneth replied with a grin, dusting off the ashes on her body.Kang Yoon-Soo looked at his now complete party and said, \u201cYou all have a task to do.\u201dIt was unusual for Kang Yoon-Soo to reveal his plans beforehand. The party looked at him with all seriousness, waiting for him to speak.\u201cThe reason why we intentionally got kidnapped was to make contact with the leader of this clan, the Black Tiger Clan,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo explained.\u201cBlack Tiger Clan? Aren\u2019t those the guys we pretended to be when we pulled one off at Sunset Glass? I wondered why there were so many thugs in this place with the Black Tiger tattoo,\u201d Henrick said seriously.Shaneth looked expectantly at Kang Yoon-Soo and asked, \u201cSo what do we have to do?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll pull off a scam,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said nonchalantly.\u201c\u2026\u201dThey were now used to Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s antics.Shaneth let out a sigh as she asked, \u201cStill, our goal is to get rid of this criminal clan, right?\u201d\u201cNo, we\u2019ll cooperate with them,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.\u201c\u2026!\u201d Henrick\u2019s face crumpled as he said angrily, \u201cYou crazy bastard. You caused such a ruckus and now you want to cooperate with them?\u201d\u201cThe leader of the Black Tiger Clan is a madman, so it\u2019s alright,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied calmly.\u201cHa! Then he must be the same kind as you?\u201d Henrick retorted mockingly.Kang Yoon-Soo pulled out several handkerchiefs from his backpack, and his party used them like masks to cover their faces. He then used the Body Crafting Kit to draw the tattoo of the Black Tiger Clan on the backs of their hands.The flames raged on, but the Black Tiger Clan members still had not escaped from the basement.\u201cSince it\u2019s come to this, let\u2019s use corpses to make a way through!\u201d\u201cDo you think blood can extinguish fire\u2026?\u201dAs expected of criminals, their way of thinking was too simple and ignorant.Kang Yoon-Soo suddenly appeared and said, \u201cGet out of the way.\u201d He stretched out his right hand and muttered, \u201cSummon Acle.\u201dA cold breeze blew as Acle suddenly appeared, and he grimaced as he openly showed his discontent. He complained, \u201cAre you crazy? How can you think of summoning me in such a hot place like this?!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll give you the Frozen Crown if you help me out,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.\u201cW-what did you say?\u201d Acle said, unable to hide his surprise. The treasure of the Winterkill Ruin, the Frozen Crown, was definitely a treasure an Ice Spirit would desire. He repeated, \u201cY-you\u2019ll give that crown to me\u2026?\u201d\u201cIf you help me out,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.\u201cHmph! I don\u2019t like it, but I guess you do need my help!\u201d Acle said haughtily as he crossed his arms. He then extended both of his hands and shouted, \u201cIce Storm!\u201dCold air started to form around both of his hands as he whirled them around. The intense cold spread out and instantaneously extinguished the flames. Now, the trapped people could escape from the basement as soon as they jumped over the fallen pillar.\u201cHaha! The flames are gone!\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re saved! You! I don\u2019t know who you are, but thank you!\u201dThe Black Tiger Clan members let out disgusting-looking smiles as they took turns one by one to thank Kang Yoon-Soo.The arsonist who had started the fire suddenly turned into the savior who had extinguished the fire\u20261. \u2019Hyung\u2019 is what a boy would call his elder brother or a guy older than him. \u261cPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Some of the Black Tiger Clan members had brought fire retardant shields as they fought off the remaining fire; staff-wielding Magicians had also arrived, spreading ice magic to quell the fire. They were quite orderly for a criminal organization.Henrick clicked his tongue and said, \u201cIt seems like we didn\u2019t inflict much damage to these guys.\u201dThe headquarters of the Black Tiger Clan was vast and wide, but there was nothing else special about it.A sweet and addictive fragrance flowed out from somewhere, tickling their noses. Iris asked as she sniffed it, \u201cWhat is this smell? It doesn\u2019t seem like a normal cigar.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re drugs,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.A few of the clan members were doing drugs at the scene of the fire. A man who was rolling up some kind of dried leaves approached them and asked, \u201cHey, you guys! You just came out of the basement, right?\u201dKang Yoon-Soo and his party stopped upon hearing those words, but it seemed the man hadn\u2019t noticed them, as their faces were covered with the makeshift masks and they had the tattoo of the Black Tiger Clan on the backs of their hands.\u201cI can tell you guys are newbies. What happened in the basement? What caused the fire?\u201d the man asked.\u201cI was near the gas chamber. Some guy was smoking, and it seems an ember flew from his cigar,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.The man shrugged and asked, \u201cReally? Well, it\u2019s not my responsibility anyway. It seems they\u2019ll kill a few of the guys and get over it. More importantly, it seems something interesting is happening; let\u2019s go to the main hall.\u201d\u201cSure,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied. He and his party followed the man.The main hall was decorated with luxurious chandeliers, but the place was filled with the smoke from drugs. It was a relief that the party members were wearing masks, as it would have been difficult for them to even breathe otherwise.\u201cIt\u2019s a request to assassinate the family of Earl Amorkan! It\u2019s thirty gold coins per head this time, and even a baby is included! It\u2019s an easy job!\u201d\u201cAny fleet-footed guys? We\u2019re planning to steal the necklace of the Orkanic Family! Who knows? Maybe you\u2019ll get to lick the ass of their widow! Kek! Keke!\u201dThe clan members were all gathered in the main hall, planning all sorts of crimes. The windows were covered in shutters, such that it was difficult for even a ray of light to enter the place, but the wilderness outside was barely visible through small gaps. It seemed this place was definitely far away from populated areas.\u201cSit here. Do you want a smoke?\u201d the man asked, extending the cigar he had been rolling previously.\u2018It\u2019s been a while,\u2019 Kang Yoon-Soo thought as he looked at the drug-filled cigar, before taking it and placing it in his mouth.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Shaneth asked in surprise, snatching the cigar from his mouth.Kang Yoon-Soo stared at her indifferently and asked, \u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t even smoke, but now you\u2019re suddenly trying to smoke drugs?\u201d Shaneth argued, her brow creasing.\u201cIt\u2019s to empty my head,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo answered.\u201cYou\u2019ll end up addicted! What will you do if you turn into an addict who can\u2019t live without drugs?\u201d Shaneth exclaimed, glaring at Kang Yoon-Soo.\u201cI was able to stop taking it without issues,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said indifferently.\u201cSays the bastard who drinks every chance he gets?\u201d Henrick chimed.The man cackled at Henrick\u2019s words and said, \u201cYou can\u2019t quit drinking, but you\u2019re telling me that you quit taking drugs? You\u2019re crazy.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s harder to quit drinking,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.\u201cHow so?\u201d the man asked. Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s words had piqued his curiosity.\u201cYour head will hurt because of withdrawal symptoms if you quit drugs, but drinking will give you a headache immediately. That\u2019s why it\u2019s harder to quit drinking,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo explained.\u201cHmm\u2026 that\u2019s a deep answer someone normally wouldn\u2019t provide,\u201d the man said, looking at Kang Yoon-Soo with interest.Suddenly, cheers came from the center of the main hall, and the man clapped his hands as if he had been waiting for that very thing. He exclaimed, \u201cIt\u2019s starting!\u201dA masked man pulled a tall, shackled woman onto the stage. The woman\u2019s neck was in chains, but her eyes were filled with rebelliousness.\u201cThey say she\u2019s a member of the White Lion Clan. She joined our clan to spy and collect information on us, and five of our guys died to that bitch,\u201d the man explained.\u201cWhat do they plan to do on stage?\u201d Shaneth asked.\u201cYou will see soon enough,\u201d the man replied.The crowd sent unimaginable insults and curses toward the woman on the stage, throwing food waste and booze bottles. However, the woman remained steadfast despite the insults hurled at her.\u201cListen! A show you would never be able to see in the outside world will soon start!\u201d the masked man said in a high-pitched, squeaky voice that resembled a clown\u2019s.\u201cOur lives are difficult, and everyone has it bad. Both our minds and our bodies suffer whenever we kill and steal. But do you guys know? Do we have a body part that never feels pain?\u201d the masked man asked. He rolled up his sleeve and pinched his elbow, adding, \u201cLook! Even if you pinch the flesh on your elbow, all you feel is a little sting and that\u2019s it! Hmm\u2026 Maybe it would if you cut it with a knife though\u2026 Ah! Here\u2019s a better example. You don\u2019t feel any pain when you cut your nails, right?\u201d He was quite talented at getting the crowd\u2019s attention.\u201cBut! What if we could make someone feel pain even from those body parts? They would feel their flesh being torn apart whenever we cut their nails one by one! Doesn\u2019t it excite you just hearing about it?\u201d the masked man exclaimed, taking out a small jewel from his pocket. The jewel had a bright orange glow, just like a lamppost. He gleefully announced, \u201cThis is a magic stone that can manipulate the pain people feel! It\u2019s a very rare and expensive item, and we\u2019ll focus all of the pain points of this bitch into one place!\u201d\u201cPain point? What the hell are you talking about?\u201d one clan member shouted.The masked man smiled as he explained, \u201cIt means we can make one part of her body very sensitive and feel immense pain!\u201dThe crowd became excited upon hearing about the new style of torture, and their murmurs filled the entire hall.\u201cWhere should we make this bitch feel pain from? Shall we focus all her pain points into her feet so she can\u2019t walk ever again? Or should we focus it all in her eyelids so she\u2019ll get a taste of hell whenever she blinks? Which part do you guys want?!\u201d The masked man fired up the crowd.The crowd was now hyped up, and various shouts suggesting different body parts filled the hall with all sorts of shameful and vile suggestions that were sure to affect the woman.\u201cEveryone here is\u2026 crazy\u2026\u201d Shaneth said, looking at Kang Yoon-Soo with pleading eyes. Her eyes conveyed her desire to immediately run over to the stage and rescue the woman. However, Kang Yoon-Soo just stared at the stage indifferently.\u201cThere, there, calm down! There are plenty of good suggestions, but don\u2019t you think the breasts or the ass are far too common? Will you be excited and satisfied if we use this rare magic stone on something as obvious as that?\u201d the masked man asked. He clicked his tongue and let out a laugh as he took out a steel pair of scissors from his pocket.A quick-witted clan member cheered loudly. All of the veins on his neck stood up as he shouted, \u201cThe hair! The place to focus all her pain into is her hair!\u201dThe masked man gently brushed the woman\u2019s hair and said, \u201cExactly! What do you think would happen if she felt pain whenever her hair was cut? It would hurt as if she were on the verge of death if I cut her hair strand by strand. Hmm\u2026 If we were to make a comparison\u2026 Maybe it would hurt like having a finger chopped off? But did you know? Hundreds of strands of hair would be cut every time the scissors are used. That means she would feel pain equivalent to having hundreds of her fingers getting chopped off! Oh my! It\u2019s gonna hurt!\u201dThe masked man gripped the magic stone and crushed it with his hand. A red hue flowed out of the stone and sank into the woman\u2019s hair. For the first time, the woman\u2019s face turned pale.\u201cNow, welcome to our salon! You\u2019re now going to get your hair cut in front of hundreds of audience members. Can you tell us how you feel?\u201d the masked man asked the woman as he grabbed a handful of her hair.The woman closed her eyes and trembled, saying, \u201cI will definitely\u2026 pay you back for this shame\u2026\u201d\u201cHahaha! Look at that bitch trembling! She\u2019s already tamed and it makes me want to torture her more!\u201d\u201cJust shave her already! Kehehehe!\u201dShaneth could not bear to watch the horrific show anymore and stood up from her seat, but the man suddenly asked, \u201cMiss, why don\u2019t you take a seat?\u201d\u201cAre you telling me to keep watching this and stay still?\u201d Shaneth retorted sharply.\u201cThen why did you burn down someone else\u2019s clan\u2019s basement? You should\u2019ve just quietly stayed asleep,\u201d the man replied.Shaneth flinched as she looked at her surroundings. That was when she realized that they were surrounded by people glaring at them with murderous intent. A few of the other clan members started to slowly look toward the party, and the man leisurely crossed his legs as he took a puff of his cigar.\u201cHa, I was surprised too. The ones we kidnapped actually ended up blowing up the gas chamber and came all the way up here. You were bound up in chains if I remember correctly. Well, aren\u2019t you guys masters of escape?\u201d the man remarked as he took another puff.Henrick observed the man with his keen sight, as the man lightly dusted off the ashes from his cigar and said in a chilling voice, \u201cThe name is Yu Si-Do, and I\u2019m the leader of the Black Tiger Clan, but you don\u2019t have to remember that. You\u2019ll die by my hands anyway.\u201dThe man\u2019s words gave the party chills and goosebumps. They had finally managed to escape, but to think that they had met up with the boss of the enemy instead. The shouts of the crowd grew louder, and the chilling atmosphere engulfed the table.\u201cWhy did you decide to impersonate us? I had no choice but to take care of you because you made the leader of Sunset Glass come all the way here. Especially that expressionless guy\u2026 It sounds like we would\u2019ve gotten along quite well. It\u2019s a shame,\u201d the man said calmly as he took another puff.\u201c\u2026Why didn\u2019t you capture us immediately, instead choosing to casually approach us first?\u201d Shaneth asked with a grimace.\u201cNo reason. It\u2019s just more fun this way. It feels awesome to see the faces of other people when you hide your identity and reveal that you\u2019re the clan leader later, you know?\u201d Yu Si-Do playfully remarked as he hummed and threw away the cigar he was smoking. He resumed his habit of biting down on his finger\u2014literally consuming his own flesh. The sight of Yu Si-Do munching his own finger despite the blood dripping from it made him look like a madman.\u201cYou\u2026 You\u2019re mad,\u201d Shaneth said, watching Yu Si-Do eat his own finger with disgust.\u201cMunch\u2026 Me? Why? There are a lot of mad people in the world, so don\u2019t you think someone like me can be considered normal? Ah, this finger? You don\u2019t have to worry about it. My body regenerates even if I munch on it,\u201d Yu Si-Do said casually.\u201cHmm\u2026 then is it the same for your heart?\u201d Iris asked as she stretched her hands out, staring at Yu Si-Do.Yu Si-Do kept eating his middle finger as he stared at Iris and asked, \u201cHave we met somewhere before?\u201d\u201cYu Si-Do,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo interrupted him. He said, \u201cThe reason why I let myself get kidnapped was to cooperate with you.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re the mad one. It wasn\u2019t enough that you impersonated us and burned down our clan\u2019s basement, but now you want to cooperate?\u201d Yu Si-Do replied, staring at Kang Yoon-Soo.\u201cWe had no choice but to burn the place down, or else you would\u2019ve killed all of us,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.\u201cI plan to kill all of you anyway, so why should I agree to that?\u201d Yu Si-Do asked.\u201cBecause you can\u2019t overcome this crisis without my help,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.Yu Si-Do stared at Kang Yoon-Soo with a confused expression and asked, \u201cCrisis?\u201dThe crowd\u2019s boos grew louder and some of them shouted, \u201cWhen is the torture going to start?!\u201d\u201cAre you planning to start after we all die from waiting? Damn it!\u201dHowever, the masked man did not use his scissors; rather, he threw them away from the stage and shouted, \u201cLadies and gentlemen! The real show begins now! I want you all to pay attention to your surroundings!\u201dThe clan members confusedly looked around them. Suddenly, some other clan members drew their weapons and stabbed their comrades.\u201cKuheok!\u201d\u201cWhy? Why are you attacking us?!\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s not one of us! It\u2019s a spy!\u201dHowever, it was too late. The clan members could not differentiate between friend or foe, but the spies could. The Black Tiger Clan members started to be one-sidedly massacred as the situation spiraled down into chaos.It was at the very moment that everything was descending down to madness that the masked man took off his mask. The face that revealed itself was impossible for anyone who was a member of the Black Tiger Clan to not recognize.\u201cH-han Se-Hyun?!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the leader of the White Lion clan?! Why the hell did that guy appear on the stage?!\u201dHan Se-Hyun smirked as he looked at Kang Yoon-Soo. \u2018Everything went according to your plan,\u2019 he thought to himself.\u201cThere\u2019s no special reason,\u201d Han Se-Hyun replied to the crowd as his eyes met Yu Si-Do\u2019s, while the latter\u2019s face crumpled with anger. He continued, \u201cNo reason. It\u2019s just more fun this way. It feels awesome to see the faces of other people when you hide your identity and reveal that you\u2019re the clan leader later, you know?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 63": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Record of a Thousand LivesChapter 64Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cHan Se-Hyun!\u201d Yu Si-Do screamed his lungs out toward the man.Han Se-Hyun crossed his arms over his chest and coldly said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to remind me what my name is.\u201dYu Si-Do gritted his teeth as he charged toward the stage, and the moment he swung his hand, four daggers flew from between his fingers toward Han Se-Hyun. However, Han Se-Hyun did not move an inch from his spot as he continued, \u201cDid you really think I wouldn\u2019t make any preparations before charging into your headquarters?\u201dThe ragged woman who was beside Han Se-Hyun suddenly moved. She muttered a spell, and the shackle around her neck fell down. \u201cMay the shackles of the Goddess bind this insignificant creature,\u201d the woman muttered. Her shackles glowed brightly before binding up Yu Si-Do\u2019s arms and legs. The brightly shining shackles completely bound up Yu Si-Do, but the man just laughed out loud as if he had gone crazy.\u201cHahaha! Is this what you have prepared?\u201d Yu Si-Do exclaimed, beginning to use his strength. The shackles helplessly split in half, tearing through his clothes in the places where they had bound him up, and blood flowed from his open wounds. However, Yu Si-Do did not seem to be fazed at all.\u201cThank you for coming to me! I\u2019ll grant you a peaceful death, since you so desperately wish to die!\u201d Yu Si-Do exclaimed as he charged toward Han Se-Hyun. He threw four daggers toward Han Se-Hyun as soon as he drew close to the other man. Han Se-Hyun ducked to avoid the daggers, but Yu Si-Do suddenly drew his sword and aimed for Han Se-Hyun\u2019s now wide open flank.Clang!Han Se-Hyun blocked the sword with his bare hand, but no blood flowed from it. Rather, sparks flew when his hand met the blade, as if two swords had collided against each other.It felt as if a strong pressure were weighing down on the atmosphere as the two formidable forces clashed against each other. The two who were staring at each other could be said to be the two strongest Travelers at present.\u201cShall we see who gets to drink whose blood?\u201d Han Se-Hyun taunted.\u201cI\u2019m sure you know how foolish it is to talk about sucking blood in front of me, my friend,\u201d Yu Si-Do replied, rolling up his sleeves and biting down on a red jewel embedded in his arm. Foul-tasting blood filled his mouth; his eyes turned red, his skin and hair turned white, and his fangs grew longer and thicker.Afterward, the two laughed as they looked at each other, as if they were good friends casually sharing a conversation.\u201cFinally, you\u2019ve turned into a vampire. Then were you a homunculus just then? You won\u2019t be able to regenerate your body now; is that alright?\u201d Han Se-Hyun casually remarked.\u201cHahaha! Why don\u2019t you worry about your neck when you have the time to worry about me?\u201d Yu Si-Do replied with a grin.The two men clashed with each other as soon as they finished talking, and an immense pressure descended on the area once again. Yu Si-Do charged viciously toward Han Se-Hyun; his speed was visibly faster than it had been, and he had more destructive power.Kwachik!The stage split in half because of Yu Si-Do\u2019s destructive force, and multiple blades flew toward Han Se-Hyun in a matter of seconds. However, Han Se-Hyun blocked all of the incoming blades with his bare hand and jumped back.\u201cI admire your crazy combat style, but you always fail to think ahead, Yu Si-Do,\u201d Han Se-Hyun said. He ducked after avoiding Yu Si-Do\u2019s sword and threw a fork he had picked up from the floor.Yu Si-Do easily avoided the fork by moving his head to one side and replied, \u201cYou\u2019re the crazy one. You changed into a class that can\u2019t even use a weapon.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s because I can win against someone like you even without a weapon,\u201d Han Se-Hyun mockingly replied.Suddenly, the fork Yu Si-Do had avoided hit a window behind him, having continued flying through the air.Crack! Kwachik!The window broke and bright sunlight shone down on Yu Si-Do\u2019s body. He screamed out in pain. \u201cAahk!\u201d\u201cMaria!\u201d Han Se-Hyun shouted.The woman called Maria started to mutter another spell. \u201cMay the shackles of the Goddess bind this insignificant creature.\u201dThe shackles that had been split in half suddenly reformed, once more binding up Yu Si-Do\u2019s arms and legs. With the sunlight shining down on him, Yu Si-Do could not resist the way he had a few moments before. The shackles imbued with intense holy power completely restricted his movements.\u201cK\u2026 Heok\u2026!\u201d Vampires were weak to sunlight and holy power. Yu Si-Do felt dizzy and collapsed soon after.\u201cWe finally caught him this time,\u201d Han Se-Hyun said, staring at the unconscious Yu Si-Do. It was around that time that the fighting around him subsided as well.\u201cCaptain Han Se-Hyun! We have completely annihilated all of the Black Tiger Clan members in this place!\u201d\u201cOur notoriety did not go up at all, which means all of them were wanted notorious criminals.\u201d\u201cWe did it!\u201dThe hall was filled with cries of victory. Han Se-Hyun smiled and walked down the stage that had been split in half, but suddenly\u2026Maria suddenly approached him and said, \u201cForgive me just this once.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Han Se-Hyun exclaimed in surprise.Pak!Maria slapped Han Se-Hyun\u2019s face.Han Se-Hyun and the rest of the White Lion Clan were frozen in shock. Maria said coldly, \u201cI told you I would definitely pay you back for the shame you gave me.\u201d\u201cI really like that our vice-captain is so tough. You even volunteered to be the bait since your face hadn\u2019t been exposed yet, but did you really have to slap me in front of our subordinates?\u201d Han Se-Hyun complained.However, Maria just glared at Han Se-Hyun before swiping a hand imbued with healing power against his cheek.\u201cCaptain\u2019s acting had personal feelings in it. Touching my hair wasn\u2019t in the script, was it? Also, you know I hate it when others touch my hair,\u201d Maria grumbled.\u201cBut I didn\u2019t cut your hair, right? I would\u2019ve shaved it all off if we went according to the script,\u201d Han Se-Hyun said with a smirk.\u201cI\u2019m very thankful for that,\u201d Maria replied.Han Se-Hyun shook his shoulders before coming down from the stage. He walked toward Kang Yoon-Soo with a huge smile on his face and exclaimed, \u201cYo! Long time no see. Have you been well?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.Kang Yoon-Soo had gone through multiple strange events after meeting Han Se-Hyun at Hiledan. He had encountered the mysterious whispers and Iris, and the White Shadow had claimed this was his final life, which was why he could not answer that he was doing well.\u201cIt\u2019s an answer I\u2019d expect from you. Oh, and it\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve seen a woman as lovely as our vice-captain,\u201d Han Se-Hyun remarked, looking at Shaneth.It was not Shaneth\u2019s first time meeting Han Se-Hyun, but she could not react to anything he said, as she was shocked by the monstrous power he had just displayed. She stuttered out, \u201cY-you were really someone amazing?\u201d\u201cWell, people tell me that quite often,\u201d Han Se-Hyun replied. He then turned around and gave his greetings to Henrick and Iris, whom he had just met for the first time.\u201cMy name is Henrick. I\u2019m just an insignificant Artisan and Puppeteer.\u201d\u201cI am Iris. I am learning about the world from them.\u201dHan Se-Hyun extended his hand toward Henrick, offering a handshake, but Henrick stared at his hands and asked with a hint of suspicion in his voice, \u201cWill your hand turn sharp like it did just a while ago?\u201d\u201cHaha! Of course it won\u2019t right now. Although, I do tend to do that to people I dislike,\u201d Han Se-Hyun answered with a laugh. It was difficult to discern from his words whether he was joking or not.Suddenly, the door opened from the outside. Someone entered and called out, \u201cThe convoy support team has arrived!\u201dFour large carriages were outside, along with seventy horses. The White Lion Clan members brought up stacks and stacks of documents from who knew where in the Black Tiger Clan\u2019s headquarters, placing them in the carriages.Han Se-Hyun looked at Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s party and asked, \u201cShall we move to our headquarters?\u201d***Kang Yoon-Soo and his party sat in the second carriage from the front; it was the second-best carriage after the one Han Se-Hyun and Maria were riding in. The other White Lion Clan members who were in the same carriage as Kang Yoon-Soo and his party all looked at Kang Yoon-Soo with amazement.\u201cExcuse me, but which country did you come from?\u201d one of the clan members asked.\u201cKorea,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.\u201cKorea? That\u2019s where our captain is from. It must be nice to meet your fellow countryman,\u201d the clan member said with a hint of jealousy in his voice. His name was Chris, and he was a tall, well-built African man from the country of Gabon. He covered his face with his hand, exclaiming, \u201cAh! Damn it! Africa is so wide and vast, but why is it so hard to meet someone from where I came from?\u201d\u201cHey Chris, if we nitpick about the details, aren\u2019t you from the United States?\u201d a freckle-faced ginger woman said with a laugh. Her name was Amanda, and she was from Australia.Chris retorted, \u201cI was born in the USA, but my motherland is Africa! I was just born in Kansas because my mother worked for a trading company and she was there when she gave birth to me! I was raised in Gabon, Africa!\u201d\u201cStop! We\u2019ve heard that story a hundred times now,\u201d the coachman, an Indian man named Pashu, said while holding onto the reins.Chris seemed to be discontent, but he kept his mouth shut. Amanda snickered at the upset Chris before turning to look at Kang Yoon-Soo. She said, \u201cEveryone is paying attention to you. Our captain is always cold to everyone, and it is quite rare to see him open up like that.\u201d\u201cAre you saying the captain warmed up to him? I think he was just being polite since he met a fellow countryman,\u201d Pashu said mockingly.Amanda laughed out loud before whispering to Kang Yoon-Soo, \u201cPashu is just jealous because the captain treated you warmly.\u201dKang Yoon-Soo did not say anything and just stared out the window.\u2018Korea\u2026\u2019His memories about his homeland were hazy, as he had lived for over 20,000 years in this world.\u2018It\u2019s not as if I haven\u2019t been there\u2026\u2019He had experienced going back to his own world after researching for a thousand years in his previous lives, and he had been able to break down the dimensional walls with a treasure called the \u2018Dimensional Mirror\u2019.\u2018Although I never tried to go back after I was murdered by the Demon Lord at Gwanghwamun Square.\u2019The Dimensional Mirror was a mysterious artifact that allowed the user to cross between dimensions to wherever the user wanted to go. However, it had taken him twenty years just to collect the materials and create that artifact.Shaneth carefully asked, \u201cAre all of you Travelers?\u201d\u201cYes. It is not only us; everyone in the carriages is a Traveler. Our White Lion Clan is only made up of Travelers,\u201d Amanda kindly explained.Henrick stuck his head out of the carriage, looked around, and asked, \u201cWhere is that guy, the leader of the Black Tiger Clan, Yu Si-Do?\u201d\u201cHe is currently being transported in the last carriage, but you can relax since he is bound by shackles imbued with holy power. I heard he was still unconscious even now,\u201d Amanda explained.\u201cI\u2019m still feeling nervous though,\u201d Chris said with an uneasy expression. He added, \u201cIt\u2019s the first time our ambush has been such a great success, but we haven\u2019t annihilated all of the Black Tiger Clan yet, right? We don\u2019t know how many there are left, and Yu Si-Do is also a scary man who can stand toe to toe against our captain.\u201d\u201cI know. That\u2019s why we waited for him to turn into a vampire, right?\u201d Amanda replied.\u201cStill\u2026 Something\u2019s not right. Don\u2019t you think things worked out too smoothly? We caught that guy too easily\u2026\u201d Chris said, unable to get rid of his unease.\u201cHey, look here, Chris. Stop worrying so much. Something always happens whenever somebody says something like that,\u201d Amanda complained.\u201cWell, you\u2019re right. It\u2019s not as if we can kill him either, because of the quest from the royal palace\u2026\u201d Chris said with a grimace.Shaneth blinked a few times and asked, \u201cA quest from the royal palace?\u201dAmanda elbowed Chris in the chest. Chris rubbed his chest with a sad expression unbefitting of his size. Shaneth could not help but find their reactions strange, but she did not pay much attention to them.\u201cThere seems to be bad blood between the White Lion Clan and the Black Tiger Clan, right?\u201d Shaneth asked.\u201cOf course. You can tell just by the names, right? A white lion and a black tiger! How could even the clan names match so well?\u201d Amanda exclaimed.Time passed quickly as they talked about various things. Pashu finally stopped the carriage and said, \u201cWe\u2019ve arrived at our headquarters.\u201dAs soon as they disembarked from the carriage, in front of them was a large building with the sun setting behind it. The White Lion painted on the building\u2019s large gates left quite the impression.Henrick raised his brow and rubbed his chin, remarking, \u201cThe design seems out of place for the capital. Was this designed by a greenhorn?\u201d\u201cHo. You have a good eye. Actually, Pashu was the one who designed our headquarters. He graduated at the top of his architectural class from an Indian Ivy League university\u2014even though he looks like that,\u201d Amanda explained.\u201cIvy League university?\u201d Henrick asked, tilting his head at the unfamiliar word.Chris\u2019 shoulders shook as he suppressed his laughter. It was an obvious act of looking down on Henrick. Henrick just furrowed his brow, but decided against confronting Chris, as he did not want to cause any unnecessary trouble.\u201cIris unni?\u201d Shaneth called, noticing that Iris had not gotten off the carriage. Iris was leaning on the corner of the carriage, fast asleep.Han Se-Hyun laughed at the sight of Iris sleeping; he patted Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s shoulder and said, \u201cIt\u2019s getting dark. Why don\u2019t you sleep at our headquarters for today?\u201d He added, \u201cI was thinking of hosting a party to refresh us from the long, tiring day we had.\u201dKang Yoon-Soo stared at Han Se-Hyun without saying anything. Han Se-Hyun furrowed his brow and added in dissatisfaction, \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of booze.\u201dKang Yoon-Soo replied, \u201cGood.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Yu Si-Do, whose body was bound up by the brightly shining shackles, was dragged toward an unknown location in the mansion.Some of the White Lion Clan members gossiped.\u201cThey say that\u2019s an artifact our vice-captain personally brought from the temple.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right; they say she gave up on numerous divine blessings just to get that.\u201dKang Yoon-Soo and his party entered the mansion, and Amanda kindly showed them the rooms they would be staying in.\u201cThe party will start later at 11pm. Come to the 5th floor if you want to have a drink,\u201d Amanda said before she left.The party members all went into their own rooms, changing into comfortable clothes and resting.***They then left their rooms at 11pm.\u201cWhere\u2019s Iris?\u201d Henrick asked.\u201cShe\u2019s fast asleep so I didn\u2019t wake her up,\u201d Shaneth replied. As she walked down the corridor, however, she asked with a worried expression, \u201cIsn\u2019t it normal etiquette to dress up if you\u2019re going to a party?\u201d\u201cWhat does it matter? It\u2019s not like we have debonair suits to change into or something.\u201d Henrick grimaced.However, what greeted them on the 5th floor was something entirely unexpected.\u201c\u2026?\u201dThere were no flashy lights or chandeliers, nor were there any musicians or bands playing any music. All of the White Lion Clan members wore casual clothes, sitting on sofas and tables. Some were even lying on sofas, and all of the booze they drank was beer, without any extravagant appetizers. They either laughed and joked or played cards with each other as they drank.\u201c\u2026was I mistaken about what a party actually was?\u201d Shaneth asked, stunned by the sight.\u201cAren\u2019t parties where stuck-up nobles act all elegant and dance around while sipping expensive wines?\u201d Henrick added, just as surprised as Shaneth.Kang Yoon-Soo nonchalantly answered, \u201cIt\u2019s because they\u2019re all Travelers.\u201dCome to think of it, all of them had devices on their wrists. Shaneth and Henrick could not help but feel culture shocked and left out, as the elegant socializing atmosphere they had expected was not there at all.Chris waved his hands excitedly from afar, exclaiming, \u201cOh! Kang Yoon-Soo! Over here!\u201dKang Yoon-Soo turned around and looked at the dumbfounded Shaneth and Henrick, saying, \u201cThis party has no etiquette or any mandatory manners. Just roam around comfortably and drink.\u201d He went on and joined Chris\u2019 table after advising the two.Henrick looked around the room before grabbing a mug of black beer and sat down in the first free spot he could find. Shaneth, having been left alone, awkwardly looked around before walking to a different location.\u201cIs this the man our captain praised so highly?\u201d a Western woman asked, her eyes filled with curiosity as she stared at Kang Yoon-Soo. She had flowing blonde hair, blue eyes, and a beautiful figure, and her cleavage was slightly visible due to her light outfit.\u201cAh, this is Margarita. She\u2019s from Vladivostok, Russia,\u201d Chris introduced the blonde woman.\u201cNice to meet you,\u201d Margarita said, extending her hand and looking at Kang Yoon-Soo with a seductive gaze.Kang Yoon-Soo lightly shook her hand and replied, \u201cKang Yoon-Soo.\u201dApart from Chris and Margarita, Amanda and Pashu were present as well.Kang Yoon-Soo grabbed a bottle of beer and skillfully opened the bottle cap. They all bumped their bottles and drank the cold, refreshing beer.\u201cFwah! How long has it been since we had beer?\u201d Chris exclaimed as he licked the beer foam off his lips.Pashu thought for a moment before answering, \u201cExactly twenty and a half days.\u201d\u201cEw\u2026 Are you trying to show off that you were a model student?\u201d Chris retorted mockingly with a grimace.\u201cOr maybe you\u2019re just stupid,\u201d Pashu countered with his own insult.\u201cDo you want to die?\u201d Chris responded threateningly.Chris and Pashu ended up bickering with each other, but the scene oddly made it look as if they were actual siblings. The warm evening air entered the room through the terrace.\u201cBut when did you get the chance to meet with the captain?\u201d Chris asked.Amanda seemed interested and joined in on the conversation. saying, \u201cRight, our captain does not maintain personal relationships for a long period of time if there\u2019s no benefit in it, even though he is a nice person. This is the first time I\u2019ve seen our captain acting so friendly and warm to someone else.\u201d\u201cWe met at Hiledan,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.\u201cHmm? You met at quite the remote place,\u201d Amanda said, showing more interest.\u201cJust talk casually. That\u2019s more comfortable for both of us,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.\u201cAh! Can I do that?\u201d Amanda replied, clapping and smiling.Pashu seemed to be upset about something and asked, \u201cWhy are you acting all cute?\u201d\u201cWhen did I?!\u201d Amanda protested, her face turning bright red.It seemed they were starting to get drunk from the beer.Chris let out a sigh and said, \u201cDamn it\u2026 I\u2019d give anything just to have a video call with my youngest\u2026 I wonder if that kid\u2019s skipping school?\u201d\u201cVideo call? That\u2019s a stretch. I wouldn\u2019t wish for anything more than to just be able to video call with my family,\u201d Amanda said, visibly seeming depressed.Contrary to the other two, Margarita smirked and said, \u201cIf you turn on a laptop, you must play World of Rockcraft!\u201d\u201cAh! World of Rockcraft! I couldn\u2019t ask for anything more than to run a raid while eating a slice of pepperoni pizza!\u201d Chris despaired at the thought.Amanda suddenly asked, \u201cWhy? Reality has turned into a game. You can also run a raid over here.\u201d\u201cHey! This and that are two entirely different things! This place is just hell!\u201d Chris retorted, gulping down his beer in frustration.Margarita playfully ate a cherry as she stared at Kang Yoon-Soo, asking, \u201cWhat about you, Mr. Kang Yoon-Soo? What were you like back in our world?\u201dKang Yoon-Soo, who had been quietly drinking his beer, replied, \u201cI was a member of society.\u201d\u201cHuh? What does that mean?\u201d Margarita asked.\u201cI don\u2019t remember,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.\u201cWhat\u2026?\u201d Margarita tilted her head in confusion.Kang Yoon-Soo added in a low voice, \u201cI don\u2019t remember much about the real world\u2026\u201dThe only things Kang Yoon-Soo remembered about the real world was that he had parents, he was an only child, and he had not gone to college. A long time had passed since, and he had forgotten if he had friends or what his dreams for the future had been. Those things were no longer important to him.\u2018If it were really important, it would\u2019ve stayed in my memories.\u2019\u201cWhat do you mean you don\u2019t remember?\u201d Margarita\u2019s brows creased.Chris stopped her from asking any further, saying, \u201cDon\u2019t be nosy. Whatever he did back, in reality, is none of our business. You\u2019re being rude.\u201dSuddenly, the catchy sounds of a harmonica rang throughout the room. Han Se-Hyun was playing the harmonica while relaxing on a sofa.\u201cThis song is Happy Day!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been a while since I heard this!\u201dHappy Day was a hit song by the singer Quirell. It was a song that had ranked 1st on the Billboard charts, and it had over two billion views on Youtube. It was a song that people from all over the world could enjoy together. However, the only two Continentals at the party did not have a clue what was going on, and they could not enjoy the party at all.Henrick came over and sat beside Shaneth, asking, \u201cWhat are they talking about right now?\u201dShaneth glared at Margarita and Amanda who were sitting together with Kang Yoon-Soo, then asked gloomily, \u201cWhy are you asking me that?\u201d\u201cYeah, why am I asking you that?\u201d Henrick replied.\u201cAhjussi, you\u2019re drunk, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Shaneth said.\u201cMe? No, I\u2019m not. By the way, why won\u2019t you call me oppa?!\u201d Henrick protested.Shaneth sighed. \u2018Notebook\u2019, \u2018World of Rockcraft\u2019, those were words she would never get to understand; she felt severely alienated. She felt there was a great distance between her and Kang Yoon-Soo, who was seated around the other Travelers.\u2018Why am I being like this? I\u2019m acting like a child,\u2019 she suddenly thought.Margarita, on the other hand, looked at Shaneth and asked Kang Yoon-Soo, \u201cUsually, Travelers hang out among themselves. Why do you hang out with the Continentals?\u201d\u201cYeah, I was curious about that too,\u201d Amanda chimed in. She added, \u201cThe Continentals are just NPCs if you think about it. Why don\u2019t you just join our clan? We would have more things in common, and we would grow stronger faster as we all try to return home.\u201dNPCs. They were people who lived in another world, often considered to be nothing more than extras. That was how most Travelers thought of the Continentals, and the members of the White Tiger Clan were no exception.Kang Yoon-Soo put down his bottle for the first time and seemed about to say something to the two when suddenly\u2026\u201cNow, listen up, everyone!\u201d Han Se-Hyun stood up and called for people\u2019s attention. He continued, \u201cOur ambush was successful today. The key members of the Black Tiger Clan were all killed by our hands, but you might have noticed. Things went too smoothly. That\u2019s right; there\u2019s no way someone like Yu Si-Do would be done in so easily.\u201dAll of the clan members were confused by their captain\u2019s sudden statement, but Han Se-Hyun continued, \u201cThe success of our raid against the Black Tiger Clan today wasn\u2019t my work alone, and the credit doesn\u2019t belong to me. That credit goes to Kang Yoon-Soo. It was all thanks to the information this man gave us.\u201dAll eyes in the room focused on Kang Yoon-Soo as Han Se-Hyun pointed him out and continued, \u201cThe location of their headquarters, the route to sneak in, and the best time to raid them. All of that information was provided by him, and without Kang Yoon-Soo, this operation isn\u2019t something we would even have been able to attempt at all.\u201dA round of applause rang out through the room. Han Se-Hyun smiled as he looked at Kang Yoon-Soo and continued, \u201cIn recognition of his contributions today, I plan to recruit Kang Yoon-Soo as an executive of our White Lion Clan. I hope he\u2019ll work and live together with us from now on.\u201dShaneth flinched, trembling and looking at Kang Yoon-Soo with a nervous gaze. She was worried that he might accept Han Se-Hyun\u2019s offer.\u201cHe\u2019ll start as an executive from the get-go?\u201d a clan member asked, surprised.Han Se-Hyun calmly nodded and said, \u201cFrom my point of view, he\u2019s someone worth that much, and he has the contributions to back it up. Is there anyone who\u2019s against this?\u201dThere were a few who seemed to be displeased about it, but none of them dared to raise their hand. It was the decision of the leader of their clan; who would dare go against it?However, there was one person. A man quietly raised his hand and nonchalantly said, \u201cI refuse.\u201dSilence filled the room.Chris urgently whispered to Kang Yoon-Soo, \u201cHey, Kang Yoon-Soo. You might not be aware of it, but this is a really amazing offer. If you want to make it to the executive level, the amount of contribution you have to raise is equivalent to completing forty raids. Plus, there are a lot of benefits to being an executive of the White Lion Clan. This is an amazing privilege!\u201d\u201cI said I refuse,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo reiterated.Han Se-Hyun smiled bitterly and said, \u201cAlright, there\u2019s no way we can force someone to become a part of our clan. However, I want to ask the reason for your refusal. Why do you dislike the idea of working with me? If we Travelers work together, your knowledge will definitely become a big help for all of us.\u201dKang Yoon-Soo glanced at Henrick and Shaneth before answering in a low voice, \u201cIt\u2019s because I already have my own companions.\u201dShaneth balled her hands into fists and gripped them tightly. Henrick raised a glass of wine to his lips, but his eyes were very much focused.\u201cWhy do I hang out with them?\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo began. He then poured a drink into his glass and said, \u201cThey\u2019re my reason for being alive.\u201d***Dusk fell, and Kang Yoon-Soo noticed that the clan members\u2019 gazes toward him were unwelcoming. However, he did not care what they thought of him at all.Some of the clan members were sprawled out on the floor, while others had made it to their own rooms and gone to sleep. Henrick was wasted on the floor; Shaneth seemed to have had a bit too much to drink herself, as she could not even prop herself up.Kang Yoon-Soo walked toward Shaneth, whose face was red from the alcohol. The drunk woman brought her lips close to his ears and whispered, \u201cKang Yoon-Soo\u2026 Kang Yoon-Soo\u2026 I\u2019m really relieved\u2026 Please stay with us\u2026 Don\u2019t leave me\u2026 Stay with me, and let\u2019s stay together just like this.\u201dKang Yoon-Soo picked up both of them and brought them to their respective rooms. He gently placed Shaneth on her bed, laying her to sleep, but casually threw Henrick onto the floor.He then went out into the corridor, quietly walking toward a set of stairs that led to the basement and heading downstairs.\u201cWhat business do you have here?\u201d a clan member who was standing guard asked, with hostility in his gaze.\u201cPass out,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.\u201cWhat?\u201d the guard asked, confused.\u201cThat\u2019s what you have to do now,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said as he pulled out his sword and smacked the guard in the head with its hilt. The guard perfectly carried out his job of collapsing and passing out.A steel door secured with multiple locks was at the end of the basement corridor. Kang Yoon-Soo pulled out a pin set from his pocket and started to pick the locks.Creak\u2026 Creak\u2026 Tadadadak\u2026 Click!The locks opened with a few skillful movements of his hands; Kang Yoon-Soo managed to open the last lock within minutes and pushed open the door.Creak\u2026A man was present on the other side of a thick window, still bound up by bright shackles. His exposed back revealed a tattoo of a large black tiger that seemed to squirm and move.\u201cYu Si-Do,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo called out.\u201c\u2026I\u2019m sleeping. Why are you calling me?\u201d Yu Si-Do replied with a voice that seemed to prove that he had just woken up from his sleep.\u201cI\u2019ll release you now,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.\u201cCrazy bastard,\u201d Yu Si-Do replied curtly.\u201cIn return, you have to follow me to the royal palace,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo continued.\u201cWhy would you go there on this hot night?\u201d Yu Si-Do complained.Kang Yoon-Soo had two objectives. The first was to meet the alchemist who had created Iris and find out the secret behind the White Shadow. And the second was\u2026\u201cTonight, we\u2019ll assassinate the emperor.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 65": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Record of a Thousand LivesChapter 66Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayYu Si-Do was a complete lunatic; he was a man common sense did not apply to. He asked seriously, \u201cYou\u2026 Have you fallen for me\u2026?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied emotionlessly.\u201cWhat? That\u2019s disappointing. Then why are you so intent on working together with me?\u201d Yu Si-Do asked.Yu Si-Do was the type who enjoyed killing as a sport. If he were given a choice between receiving a ton of gold or killing somebody, he was the type of person who would choose the latter; he could not resist the ecstasy he felt from taking someone\u2019s life away.\u201cI told you. I intentionally got kidnapped to join hands with you,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.\u201cWhy do you want to work with me?\u201d Yu Si-Do asked again.\u201cYou\u2019re the best of the best if we\u2019re talking about assassination, murder, and infiltration. Although your personality is crooked, you\u2019re the best to bring along if I can only bring one person with me,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo explained.\u201cWhat if I refuse?\u201d Yu Si-Do asked.\u201cI won\u2019t set you free,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.Kang Yoon-Soo seemed to have piqued Yu Si-Do\u2019s interest, as the man just stared at him with an intrigued gaze. Yu Si-Do snickered and replied, \u201cI felt it the first time we met. You and I are the same, aren\u2019t we?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo nonchalantly replied.\u201cWhat do you mean, what? I\u2019m saying you\u2019re a sociopath just like me, you crazy bastard,\u201d Yu Si-Do replied.Yu Si-Do stared at a ray of moonlight that entered through a gap in the window and collected on the floor, muttering, \u201cPeople call me crazy, but all I want is to be loved! Why does nobody understand me? Boohoo\u2026\u201d He faked a cry as he continued, \u201cSniff\u2026 It\u2019s hard to be like us, right? Only a few people understand people like us. This is all because of people like Han Se-Hyun who think they\u2019re the normal ones, and they\u2019re just making our lives difficult.\u201dKang Yoon-Soo quietly stared at Yu Si-Do, and Yu Si-Do turned and stared back at Kang Yoon-Soo.\u201cIf you admit you\u2019re a crazy bastard, I\u2019ll gladly help you. Because you\u2019re interesting, and you\u2019re the same kind of person as I am,\u201d Yu Si-Do said with a smirk.\u201cA truly crazy person wouldn\u2019t admit that they were crazy,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.\u201cWow!\u201d Yu Si-Do exclaimed in admiration, trying to clap, but the shackles restrained him from doing so. He exclaimed excitedly, \u201cYou! I\u2019m starting to like you now! Ah, what was your name again?\u201d\u201cKang Yoon-Soo,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.\u201cAlright, Kang Yoon-Soo, why aren\u2019t you a woman? I would\u2019ve instantly fallen in love with you if you were one,\u201d Yu Si-Do said excitedly.Kang Yoon-Soo ignored the man\u2019s ramblings as he inserted his pin set into the shackles that were binding Yu Si-Do. Yu Si-Do seemed to have taken a liking toward Kang Yoon-Soo, as he was giggling the whole time while Kang Yoon-Soo was working on his restraints.\u2018I feel this whenever I regress, but this guy is always a pain to deal with,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo thought. He could not openly express how annoying the madman was; this was going to be a long night.***Yu Si-Do had been stripped down when he was caught, with only a loincloth covering his privates, and all of his possessions had been taken from him. However, he did not seem to mind being naked at all and said, \u201cI\u2019ll just take it back on the way, I guess.\u201dThe two went up from the basement. Yu Si-Do, who was usually quite rowdy and noisy, walked quietly through the hallway, since he was aware that if they were spotted by anyone, things would get very messy.\u201cWait,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said, stopping in front of Iris\u2019 room. \u2018The White Shadow who knew about my regression was inside Iris. It might be a good idea to bring her along to the royal palace,\u2019 he thought, quickly deciding to open the door. Inside, a beautiful woman lay on the bed; her breath made her voluptuous chest move up and down.\u201cIris,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo called out.\u201cMmmmh\u2026? Kang Yoon-Soo\u2026?\u201d Iris exclaimed as she rubbed her eyes and got up from the bed. She asked, \u201cYawn\u2026 What\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cWake up. We\u2019re going to the royal palace,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.\u201cAlright; let us go,\u201d Iris obediently replied, starting to get.However, Yu Si-Do, who was watching from behind them, grumbled in discontent, \u201cWhat is this? Wasn\u2019t it going to be a date just between the two of us?\u201d\u201cWe need her for this plan to work,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.\u201cTsk\u2026 if she\u2019s just going to get in between us, I might as well as kill her here on the\u2026\u201d Yu Si-Do suddenly trailed off as his eyes shot wide open. He said more seriously, \u201cWait a minute, this woman. I didn\u2019t notice because her mouth was covered, but isn\u2019t she the royal princess?\u201d\u201cHave you ever met the princess?\u201d Iris asked.\u201cYeah, I failed to assassinate her in her bedchambers once, but why are you here?\u201d Yu Si-Do stared at Iris with sparkling, innocent eyes.However, Kang Yoon-Soo knew that Yu Si-Do was currently contemplating which angle he should twist Iris\u2019 neck from to maximize his pleasure. He interrupted Yu Si-Do\u2019s daydream and said, \u201cShe\u2019s the doppelganger of the princess.\u201d\u201cReally? No wonder she felt different from the princess,\u201d Yu Si-Do said. It was surprising how quickly he accepted that fact.Kang Yoon-Soo continued, \u201cThe royal palace has secretly placed an order to have you captured, Yu Si-Do.\u201d\u201cMe? Why?\u201d Yu Si-Do asked with an innocent expression.\u201cTo torture you and find out the perpetrator who requested the assassination of the princess,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.\u201cAha\u2026 No wonder that Han Se-Hyun bastard kept me alive. He planned to hand me over to the royal palace and secure a spot for himself,\u201d Yu Si-Do said angrily. His voice turned rough at the mention of Han Se-Hyun as he continued, \u201cI really don\u2019t like that bastard. I hate him! I want to rip him apart from head to toe! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!\u201dYu Si-Do had severe mood swings. He was usually laid back and relaxed, but he could immediately turn and kill anyone in front of him if he felt agitated. Kang Yoon-Soo was well aware of Yu Si-Do\u2019s temperament and quickly changed the subject.\u201cWe\u2019ll go straight to the royal palace, but we have to cover our faces,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.\u201cAck! You aren\u2019t telling me to wear a mask, are you? That\u2019s not my style at all. It makes me look like a criminal\u2026\u201d Yu Si-Do said in a playful tone. Kang Yoon-Soo did not feel the need to point out to Yu Si-Do that he was a criminal.Iris suddenly pointed at some things hanging on the wall and asked, \u201cWhat if we use those?\u201dThe objects were party masks. Yu Si-Do carefully checked the masks before choosing one of a brightly smiling angel, saying, \u201cI\u2019ll use this.\u201d\u201cIris, don\u2019t wear a mask,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said. He pulled out the Body Crafting Kit and reverted Iris\u2019 hair color back to blonde. Then, he chose a mask that allowed him to move freely.Iris gently smiled and said, \u201cThat mask suits Kang Yoon-Soo well.\u201dIt was a mask of a cute bunny. Kang Yoon-Soo looked at Iris with the mask on and asked in a low, emotionless voice, \u201cWhich part of it suits me well?\u201d***\u201cI\u2019m now hesitant to hold my sword\u2026\u201d\u201cI know the mission\u2019s failure wasn\u2019t your fault. Don\u2019t blame yourself.\u201d\u201cThat isn\u2019t the problem right now.\u201dLenox, the captain of the Third Order of the Imperial Knights, sighed. He and his knights had returned from the Hatar Mountains four days ago in a pitiful and haggard state. Of course, they were ridiculed and blamed, and there were some who had wanted to revoke his knighthood.\u201cEven a dame[1] captain such as myself has had to fight through various prejudices thrown at me, and I did so by the sword. I noticed this since we were doing our apprenticeship, but your uptight attitude is the problem. You should take a walk and get some air once in a while, you know?\u201d the captain of the Second Order of the Imperial Knights, Seyra, said while yawning.The dame, who was famous for her flashy, fiery swordsmanship, slowly sipped on her red tea. She asked in a playful tone, \u201cSo, was the reason you called me out this late at night to receive life advice, sir knight?\u201d\u201cAh, no.\u201d Lenox hesitated for a moment before saying, \u201cSeyra, something dangerous is brewing within the royal palace.\u201d\u201cLower your voice,\u201d Seyra warned, stirring her tea with a spoon. Lenox felt a chill run down his spine as Seyra warned him sternly, \u201cEveryone knows there\u2019s something going on in the royal palace that we aren\u2019t aware of, but never, ever mention that anywhere.\u201d\u201cWhy is that?\u201d Lenox asked.\u201cWe might be killed, but nobody will even notice our deaths,\u201d Seyra replied.Lenox quickly understood what she meant. That meant there were high ranking officials involved in the secret of the royal palace. A warm breeze blew through the terrace they were sitting in, but that breeze felt ice cold to Lenox.He sighed and changed the subject. \u201cThat isn\u2019t the only reason it\u2019s been difficult to pick up my sword these days. I met someone who reached the pinnacle of the sword while I was carrying out my mission.\u201d\u201cThat someone\u2019s right in front of you right now,\u201d Seyra said with a smirk.\u201cHey, I\u2019m not joking. He really reached the pinnacle of the sword. Even Sir Helkin might lose if they both clashed,\u201d Lenox said with all seriousness.\u201cHmm? What was his name?\u201d Seyra asked.\u201cI don\u2019t know. All I know is that he is a Traveler,\u201d Lenox replied.\u201cA Traveler?\u201d Seyra exclaimed in surprise. She stopped stirring her tea and continued, \u201cLies. How can the baseless swordsmanship of those Travelers win against a knight captain of the continent?\u201d\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it as well, but I\u2019m certain. It might seem like a baseless assumption, but I could never catch up to that guy\u2019s skills even if I trained my sword for a thousand years,\u201d Lenox replied seriously.Suddenly, the sound of quick, hurried footsteps approached them. Eric, the newbie, ran into the terrace Lenox and Seyra were sitting in and exclaimed urgently, \u201cCaptain! T-there\u2019s a problem!\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Lenox asked.\u201cI\u2019m here to relay a message from the scouts. The Centaurs are invading the royal palace! They\u2019re currently invading through the back of the garden as we speak!\u201d\u201cThe back of the garden?\u201d Lenox repeated. The two knight captains looked at each other before both breaking out into laughter.Seyra looked at the anxious Eric before asking Lenox, \u201cCan\u2019t you educate your recruits properly, Lenox?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry about this,\u201d Lenox replied.\u201cW-what\u2019s going on?\u201d Eric asked, as he had no idea what was going on.Lenox lowered his teacup onto the table and got up. He said leisurely, \u201cThe captain of the First Order of the Imperial Knights, Sir Helkin, takes a walk every night in the garden at this hour. I hope some of them are at least alive by the time we reach them.\u201d***The reason why Kang Yoon-Soo wanted to assassinate the emperor of the Reorkan Empire, Ranford Reorkan, was simple. \u2018It\u2019s better to kill that senile old man as early as possible,\u2019 he thought to himself.It was normal to suggest retirement to a senile elder, but it was a different story if that senile elder held the most authority on the entire continent.\u2018The emperor is the master of misjudgments,\u2019 Kang Yoon-Soo thought to himself.Emperor Ranford\u2019s political finesse had been truly great in his younger years, and he had been able to protect his power and authority from the nobles who had challenged him. However, the once astounding emperor could not stand the test of time and his judgment and discernment started to fail him, which would throw the continent into chaos later on.\u2018He\u2019s still sane at the moment, but he\u2019ll definitely be a hindrance to me in a few years\u2019 time.\u2019A huge choice such as assassinating the emperor had originally not been in his plans, but Kang Yoon-Soo had to make the most out of his choices as this would be his last life. That was why he planned to assassinate the emperor tonight.\u2018Looking at it another way, it might be better for the emperor to die now.\u2019However, Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s opposition this time was the highest authority on the continent, the emperor. Was it possible for just three of them to go through the security of the royal palace and assassinate the emperor? Anyone else would consider it entirely impossible. But he was confident, because he had successfully done it before.\u2018They\u2019ll slowly start appearing around this time.\u2019Kang Yoon-Soo watched the surroundings of the royal palace from the darkness. After some time passed, space suddenly distorted and a group composed of hundreds of black-robed figures suddenly teleported into the place he had been watching.\u201cWho are they?\u201d Iris asked.\u201cShhh.\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo signaled his companions to be quiet.The largest among the hooded figures said in a low, eerie voice, \u201cFinally! Today is the seventh time the ring of the moon has set! It\u2019s time to put our long awaited plan into motion!\u201dA low cry rose from the group as they took off their black robes and readied their weapons.Clop! Clop! Clop!The sound of hooves rang throughout the place; the hooded figures were none other than the Centaurs. However, these ones looked different from normal Centaurs, as they had dark black eyes and bluish skin.Yu Si-Do remarked, \u201cIt\u2019s the Centaurs from the Raukel Forest, but what are those guys who are more obsessed with black magic than cocaine doing here?\u201dThe Centaurs of Raukel Forest were a race that boasted monstrous strength and fast agility. The leader of the Centaurs roared excitedly, \u201cThe humans are destroying our forest and taking our lands! Today, we\u2019ll show them the anger of the ones who have lost their homes by destroying the royal palace!\u201dThe Centaurs prepared their dark black spears and bows, preparing to charge in. Meanwhile, Kang Yoon-Soo slowly nodded and thought, \u2018Yes, keep attracting attention just like you\u2019re doing right now.\u2019Even a lowly guard standing watch over the royal palace possessed very high combat power, and Kang Yoon-Soo needed to take advantage of the invasion of the Centaurs to slip through the heavily guarded palace.\u2018However, only death awaits if we end up getting caught up in the battle.\u2019They needed a secret weapon to successfully assassinate the emperor and leave this place alive.Kang Yoon-Soo pulled out an old, worn-out book from his backpack.\u2018The codex personally written by the Ultimate Necromancer, Nakron.\u2019It was the item he had received for completing a legendary quest. The recipe to create a high-ranking undead being was written in it, and a normal necromancer would never even be able to dream of possessing it.Kang Yoon-Soo quickly turned the pages\u2026Recipes to create undead beings such as the Big Skeleton, Twin-Headed Zombie, Necro Wyvern, and other vicious creatures were written in the codex.Kang Yoon-Soo opened the last two pages of the codex.[Recipe: Skeleton Lich]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 66": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Record of a Thousand LivesChapter 67Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayA Lich was an immortal being that was evil down to its core. It was a top-tier undead that was incomparable to common undead like skeletons or zombies. It was also a powerful boss monster that would be difficult to find even in high ranked ruins.Kang Yoon-Soo was thinking of creating a Lich by using Nakron\u2019s codex.\u2018I was a Lich myself when I lived as the Ultimate Necromancer, but I can\u2019t do that this time so I have to do this instead.\u2019He thus studied the things related to creating the Lich.[The following hereunder is a warning to you, who arrogantly dares to read my codex.][The fastest way to create an excellent Lich is to use the corpse of an Archmage. If you don\u2019t, the intellect of the Lich you create will be greatly reduced. I mean, a Lich that won\u2019t even be able to remember its own name will be created.][Damn it, a stupid Lich? Just thinking about it is horrible.][Remember, creating a Lich is an act of committing suicide. The Lich you create will charge at you with the intention to kill you. That\u2019s why I suggest you consider being a Lich yourself instead of creating a Lich\u2014or go somewhere else and choose a simpler way to die.]\u2018There\u2019s no way for me to obtain the corpse of an Archmage. I\u2019ll skip that part.\u2019He briefly considered whether he should join forces with Yu Si-Do to murder the royal court magician, but the assassination of the emperor alone would probably take most of the day. Also, there was a chance of the Lich he created rebelling against him.Next, he studied the materials he needed to create the Lich.[A high-grade mana stone.][200 mementos infused with the anguish of the dead.][300 bones of a superior race.][A magic circle drawn with the blood of the contractor.]Kang Yoon-Soo had knowledge from his previous lives about which ingredients he needed to create a Lich, but he had never attempted to make a Lich even once in his previous 999 lives.\u2018It\u2019s not a bad idea to summon a large and powerful undead like the Bone Dragon, but this is the front of the royal palace. Causing any large-scale conflict here will result in me becoming wanted by the empire.\u2019It was not necessarily a bad idea to destroy the whole royal palace, but that would only be a waste of time. Kang Yoon-Soo had to remove every unnecessary thing from his plan and focus on growing as fast as he could, because this was going to be his last life.He stabbed the back of his hand and blood flowed out of it. He then started to draw a large magic circle with his own blood.\u201cWhat are you doing? Did you suddenly get into occultism or something?\u201d Yu Si-Do asked with a yawn, sounding bored.Kang Yoon-Soo completed the magic circle and placed the required ingredients in it.\u2018It\u2019s good that we hunted the Bone Dragon, Skeltrodon, before coming here.\u2019Kang Yoon-Soo piled up the bones of the ancient dragon; the mementos filled with the anguish of the dead were also an absolute requirement.\u2018These are the items the Crossed Swords Bandits stole from their victims.\u2019Kang Yoon-Soo unsparingly placed various pieces of equipment on top of the bones. Lastly, he took out a jewel that had a purple glow.\u2018The Supreme Gem of Requiem.\u2019It was the magic stone Kang Yoon-Soo had carved out of the Ancient Stone back when he was with the Red Rock Excavators. The magic circle started to tremble as soon as he placed the Supreme Gem of Requiem inside it.\u201cO great sage who is deep inside the abyss, heed my call and receive your new life.\u201dThe ingredients on top of the magic circle started to shake and tremble as soon as Kang Yoon-Soo chanted the spell, and his surroundings were engulfed in evil darkness, unlike the bright light that had appeared when he created the spirits.[The Supreme Gem of Requiem is becoming the core of the Lich.][The Lich\u2019s life vessel is being molded.][The bones are badly preserved.][The Lich\u2019s body size will be reduced.][The mementos filled with anguish have been used as one of the components.][The black magic of the Lich has become stronger.][The intelligence of the Lich has greatly decreased because the skull of an Archmage is missing.][You have gained a great Necromancer achievement.][The skill level of Mass Raise Dead has increased.]An undead being was born in the midst of the quiet darkness, and it was a short, chubby skeleton.\u201c\u2026\u201dIt had a small frame, almost the size of a goblin or a dwarf, and it would have been impossible to tell what it was if it did not have the red robe and bony staff which were the signature symbols of a Lich. Otherwise, it would have been mistaken for an ordinary skeleton.The miniature Lich clacked its jaws and exclaimed, \u201cI\u2019m very evil!\u201dThe Lich held a brightly shining vessel where it kept its life force. A Lich was technically immortal, but it would immediately die if the vessel where it stored its life force was destroyed.Kang Yoon-Soo took the life vessel from the Lich like taking candy from a baby.\u201cDon\u2019t take it. That\u2019s mine,\u201d the Mini-Lich complained.\u201cNo,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.\u201cYou\u2019re very evil,\u201d the Mini-Lich protested.\u201cI made you, so of course I\u2019m more evil than you,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.\u201cIs that so?\u201d the Mini-Lich innocently asked.\u201cThat is so,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.\u201cYou\u2019re a genius,\u201d the Mini-Lich said, astounded.Just as the codex said, the lack of an Archmage\u2019s corpse greatly reduced the Lich\u2019s intelligence, but thanks to that, Kang Yoon-Soo did not have to worry about it plotting any rebellion.\u201cI\u2019m your master, the one who created you. Show me what you can do,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.The Mini-Lich walked toward a tree in the forest and gently touched it. The tree that had been full of vitality just moments before suddenly withered all the way down to its roots.\u2018This is more than enough,\u2019 Kang Yoon-Soo thought, and he nodded.The Mini-Lich was definitely much weaker than an average Lich, but if Kang Yoon-Soo nurtured it well, it would grow into a very powerful undead capable of leading an entire undead legion.\u201cYou are really cute. I have taken a liking to you,\u201d Iris said, seeming to have unexpectedly taken an interest in the Mini-Lich. She patted the Mini-Lich\u2019s skull, and the tiny lich naturally offered its head to Iris.\u201cI like you too. You seem nice, unlike my master,\u201d the Mini-Lich said.\u201cWhat the hell is wrong with that Lich\u2026? It should definitely enjoy killing if it\u2019s an undead. Do you want me to teach it?\u201d Yu Si-Do said, feeling restless due to his desire to taint and corrupt the young lich.Kang Yoon-Soo ignored Yu Si-Do\u2019s squirming and shook the life vessel of the Mini-Lich, saying, \u201cI\u2019ll be keeping your life vessel. If you don\u2019t follow my commands, I\u2019ll kill you.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll follow your commands even if you don\u2019t take it that far. Return my life vessel,\u201d the Mini-Lich protested.\u201cNo,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.\u201cWhy not?\u201d the Mini-Lich asked.\u201cI\u2019m evil, remember?\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.\u201cMaster is smart\u2026\u201d the Mini-Lich exclaimed.Kang Yoon-Soo pointed toward the Centaur army and said, \u201cGo join them when they\u2019re about to die. Draw their attention to you and drag out the battle.\u201d\u201cOkay,\u201d the Mini-Lich responded, and it disappeared into the darkness.Kang Yoon-Soo could not help but feel anxious.\u2018The captain of the First Order of the Imperial Knights, Helkin, isn\u2019t someone I can face at this time,\u2019 he thought as he put on his bunny mask.***The old knight did not sleep because he did not feel the need to rest. He had been like that since the day he was born.One day, an apprentice knight had asked him, \u201cHow can I become a knight like Sir Helkin? I plan to live by the sword and be a true knight just like you, sir.\u201d\u201cIf you really plan to live by the sword, then cut your penis off first,\u201d the old knight replied as he checked his sword\u2019s sharpness. He continued, \u201cYou\u2019ll be able to focus solely on the sword if you lose such a weakness, and your mind will be free from distractions. If you want to, I can do it for you right now.\u201dThat day, the apprentice knight cried as he ran away from the old knight.From that day onward, the biggest topic in the royal palace was, \u2018Is the captain of the First Order of the Imperial Knights actually a eunuch[1]?\u2019. Of course, the old knight did not comment on the rumor, and it was only dispelled when the other knights who went to the public baths with the old knight discredited it.That incident perfectly showcased the old knight\u2019s upright and stubborn personality.\u201cGrandpa,\u201d a boy called out.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d the old knight asked.\u201cA horse is running toward us,\u201d the boy said.Helkin hesitated for a moment. He pondered whether telling his seven-year-old grandson that the horse running toward them was not a horse was the right thing to do.\u201cThat\u2019s not a horse. That\u2019s a Centaur,\u201d he finally said.\u201cIs a Centaur not a horse?\u201d his grandson asked.\u201cIsn\u2019t the upper half that of a human?\u201d Helkin replied.\u201cWhy is a Centaur a mix of humans and horses?\u201d his grandson asked.\u201cIt\u2019s because a horse and a man had sex,\u201d Helkin replied.Helkin\u2019s young grandson was shocked for a moment before starting to cry. It was only then that Helkin realized he had made a mistake.\u201cI\u2019m sure the horse didn\u2019t consent to it. It would be easier to call it rape,\u201d Helkin said, hurriedly trying to fix the situation.The young child\u2019s face turned ghastly pale when he heard his grandfather\u2019s words. Helkin regretted his words and felt as if he wanted to cut off his tongue.\u201cI bring a message!\u201d a Centaur ran forward and shouted. He stared at Helkin with murderous intent and asked, \u201cAre you the strongest knight among the humans, the one they call Helkin?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s something they decided on their own,\u201d Helkin replied.\u201cSo you are indeed Helkin. Then your swordsmanship must be good enough to strike down a whole army by yourself?\u201d the Centaur asked.\u201cWell, I do have the skill to instantly kill creatures like you who were born out of bestiality,\u201d Helkin replied, grabbing the hilt of his sword.Calling them creatures born from bestiality was the worst insult anyone could say to a Centaur. However, the Centaur unexpectedly just laughed off the insult hurled by Helkin and said, \u201cYour nonchalant manner proves that you are indeed Helkin. I would love nothing more than to test your strength right now, but I will have to hold back on that. Our forces will occupy the royal palace shortly, and I do not want to shed any unnecessary blood until then. Now, why not go and alert your fellow humans about this?\u201d\u201cHoo\u2026 You seem to be quite confident,\u201d Helkin said, sounding amused.\u201cYou are just weak humans in the first place, and we have carefully prepared for this very moment for decades. All that awaits you humans is death,\u201d the Centaur said.Helkin saw an opening and aimed for the precise spot where the Centaur was split between man and horse, then cut the Centaur in half.\u201cHuh\u2026?\u201d The Centaur was confused, as he had not even been able to see Helkin draw his sword. He was split in half and died, his blood spurting all over the place.\u201cI-I\u2019m going to the library!\u201d Helkin\u2019s grandson screamed, running away away from the scene.Helkin scratched his head covered with gray hair and sighed, thinking, \u2018It\u2019s much easier to cut down hundreds of enemies than to see my grandkid smile once\u2026\u2019Clop! Clop! Clop!Hundreds of Centaurs carrying spears and bows charged from a distance toward Helkin, and their numbers were great enough to make the earth shake.Helkin slowly walked toward them as hundreds of enemy weapons flew at him. However, as soon as the old knight attacked, tens of arrows and three spears were instantly cut down, and several Centaurs died instantly\u2014all with one swing of his sword.***Kang Yoon-Soo, Yu Si-Do, and Iris unexpectedly had very good team chemistry, as the trio successfully infiltrated the royal palace while all of the attention was focused on the army of Centaurs that had charged in. However, a guard standing watch spotted them and was about to call out. Yu Si-Do suddenly dashed forward and subdued the guard bare-handed, wrapping his arm around the guard\u2019s neck.Yu Si-Do drew close to the guard\u2019s ear and asked in a whisper, \u201cHere\u2019s a question. What\u2019s tastier? Cookies or biscuits?\u201d[2]\u201cW-what?\u201d the flustered guard asked.\u201cAnswer me properly. Your answer will decide whether you live or die,\u201d Yu Si-Do threatened the guard.\u201cC-cookies\u2026?\u201d the guard answered.\u201cDamn it! You\u2019re putting unnecessary blood on my hands! Isn\u2019t the answer sugar no matter who you ask?!\u201d Yu Si-Do cried out before twisting the guard\u2019s neck.Iris said innocently, \u201cYu Si-Do is crazy.\u201dKang Yoon-Soo twisted the neck of the barely breathing guard back into place and fed him a healing potion. However, Yu Si-Do seemed disgruntled about the fact that Kang Yoon-Soo had done that, as he asked, \u201cWhy are you saving him?\u201d\u201cOur trail will be long if we leave behind corpses,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.\u201cWhat a greenhorn thing to say. Then we can just crush the corpse or grind it down! You won\u2019t be able to achieve much in life if you worry about small things like this!\u201d Yu Si-Do retorted.Kang Yoon-Soo ignored the madman\u2019s ramblings and walked away. Meanwhile, Yu Si-Do grumbled as he took the clothes and sword off the guard and finally clothed himself.\u201cLet\u2019s go up here,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.The trio started to scale the walls of the royal palace. Surprisingly, nobody asked for any help as they climbed. Kang Yoon-Soo was already quite adept at scaling walls, Yu Si-Do even had the leisure to do all sorts of dangerous tricks while climbing, and Iris climbed by stabbing her fingers into the wall with her monstrous strength.\u201cHmm\u2026 our chemistry is actually really good. Don\u2019t you guys have any plans to join my clan?\u201d Yu Si-Do asked.\u201cDo you have a lot of delicious food there?\u201d Iris asked.\u201cThere are some who enjoy human meat from time to time,\u201d Yu Si-Do replied.\u201c\u2026then I don\u2019t want to,\u201d Iris responded.The trio broke a window and infiltrated the royal palace. The sound of the glass window breaking was quite loud, but thankfully, nobody was in the corridor at that time. Kang Yoon-Soo took the lead and started to walk through the corridor.\u201cInfiltrating and assassinating the emperor is quite a fun thing to do, but how do you plan to enter his bedchambers? This place has been designed to make it difficult for anyone to pass without anybody noticing it,\u201d Yu Si-Do remarked.In response, Kang Yoon-Soo suddenly leaned forward against a wall. He kicked the wall twice and tapped it five times with his palm. Then, the stone wall suddenly split open to reveal a secret passage.Yu Si-Do let out a hideous smile and exclaimed, \u201cAhhhh! I will really fall for you at this rate!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 67": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Record of a Thousand LivesChapter 68Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe secret passage in the royal palace was dark and eerie. Several places that were only accessible to certain individuals were visible through the small openings in the wall. The trio passed by numerous openings that showed a high-ranking official\u2019s office, the restricted library, a storehouse sealed with magic, and even the royal bathhouse.\u201cIt\u2019s connected to every single important place in the royal palace. Spies and traitors would love this place. Who made this place?\u201d Yu Si-Do asked.\u201cSomeone who\u2019s both a traitor and a spy,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.\u201cReally?\u201d Yu Si-Do asked with interest.\u201cThere are revolutionaries within the royal palace too,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.He walked without any hesitation whenever they were met with a fork in the secret passage. That did not change even when the passage divided up into multiple branches.Yu Si-Do asked as they were passing by a torture chamber that reeked with the stench of blood, \u201cBut how do you know that?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s none of your business,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.\u201cWow! You\u2019re the second person to treat me so coldly! The first was Han Se-Hyun,\u201d Yu Si-Do exclaimed, giggling as if he had thought of something fun.Kang Yoon-Soo continued walking and thought, \u2018First, we have to assassinate the emperor. Then, we\u2019ll go and find the alchemist who created Iris.\u2019He asked, \u201cIt has been quite a while. Has the White Shadow said anything?\u201d\u201cThe White Shadow is quiet. The only time it spoke so much was when I first met you,\u201d Iris replied.What was the identity of the White Shadow? That question would be answered very soon.The trio walked through the inclined passage for quite a while. Eventually, a large square tile appeared in front of them. Once they moved the tile away, it revealed a large, grand, and majestic room.\u201cSo this is the emperor\u2019s residence,\u201d Yu Si-Do said excitedly, repeatedly licking his lips.Kang Yoon-Soo looked around the room decorated with various exquisite art pieces, and saw a large-framed man sleeping on the bed.Iris looked at the man curiously and said, \u201cSo that man is the emperor. The father of the princess I was created to look like.\u201dYu Si-Do whispered excitedly, \u201cHow do you plan to kill him? Stab him while he\u2019s asleep? Or wake him up and make him go through all sorts of humiliation first? Hoo\u2026 Fuck! I can\u2019t stop trembling from excitement thinking I\u2019m going to kill the man with the highest authority in the continent!\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll poison him,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.\u201cWhat?\u201d Yu Si-Do exclaimed with a disappointed expression. He added, \u201cYou came all the way here to end it that easily?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the most silent form of assassination that leaves no trace,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.The emperor\u2019s bedchamber had security magic installed in it; that magic would sound the alarm if someone did not enter from the main entrance.Yu Si-Do squinted and said, \u201cI didn\u2019t follow you all this way just to commit such a boring murder.\u201dKang Yoon-Soo stared at Yu Si-Do for a moment. Yu Si-Do was a skilled assassin, but his madness had made him betray Kang Yoon-Soo multiple times in previous lives; he had to be kept entertained to prevent the madness from coming out.\u201cI\u2019ll use a poison that will make him laugh until he dies,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.\u201cA poison that can make someone laugh until they die?\u201d Yu Si-Do asked. His interest seemed to have suddenly been piqued as he asked, \u201cYou brought such a poison with you?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.\u201cThen how do you plan to poison the emperor?\u201d Yu Si-Do asked.\u201cI\u2019ll get it from here,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said. He walked for a bit and entered a door to reach the royal greenhouse. The bright moonlight shone down on the greenhouse covered in transparent vinyl panels.\u201cThere are a lot of flowers here. This place makes me feel good. I like this place,\u201d Iris said. She sniffed the flowers and smiled.Various plants that had been difficult for even Kang Yoon-Soo to find in his previous lives were present inside.Yu Si-Do looked around the greenhouse and plucked out a red flower. He exclaimed excitedly, \u201cAh! This is a bloodsucking flower! There\u2019s no better material than its roots when making narcotics!\u201dKang Yoon-Soo passed by numerous plants as he headed for the center of the greenhouse. He ignored all of the plant species that were valuable for alchemy or potion-making along the way. At the center of the greenhouse was a large purple flower.\u2018Flower of the Lunatic.\u2019 he thought as he skillfully plucked the flower\u2019s petals.Suddenly, beyond the plants, a woman\u2019s voice called out, \u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201dShe then emerged from between the flowers. The moonlight shone down on her, and her long, flowing blonde hair shone bright under the moonlight. She was a noble and elegant beauty.\u201cAh\u2026\u201d Iris let out a small voice as she stared at the woman, and the woman stared back at Iris. The two women, who had not even the smallest difference between them, looked at each other.\u201cYou\u2026 You look exactly like me,\u201d the woman said.\u201cYou\u2019re right. We do seem alike,\u201d Iris said, with a strange glimmer in her eyes.Yu Si-Do placed his hand on Iris\u2019 shoulder and pointed at the woman before asking, \u201cWhat is this sudden turn of events? Is that the real princess?\u201d\u201cI do not think there is any reason to doubt my identity,\u201d the woman said proudly.They were certain. The woman in front of them was the imperial princess\u2014Kisifran Reorkan.\u201cWho are you people, to be entering my greenhouse? And with someone that looks exactly like me on top of that?\u201d Princess Kisifran asked.Kang Yoon-Soo and Yu Si-Do were still wearing their masks, and Princess Kisifran could immediately tell that these people had not entered the royal palace with good intentions.\u201cThere\u2019s no way they would have granted access to the royal palace to people like you. With what intention did you enter the royal palace?\u201d Princess Kisifran asked once again.\u201cTo kill your father,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.Princess Kisifran was silent for a moment before saying, \u201cGood. Do you need any help?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.\u201cI pray for your success then,\u201d Princess Kisifran responded.Yu Si-Do could not hold his laughter back. He asked, \u201cWhat a fun response. Is the princess crazy like us?\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m not. I\u2019m just well aware of how I should be acting in front of assassins,\u201d Princess Kisifran responded with a smile as her lips trembled.Kang Yoon-Soo placed his blade on her neck and said threateningly, \u201cTake it off.\u201d***Tens of Centaurs died to Helkin\u2019s blade, but they immediately came back to life to fight once again.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Lenox asked, staring dumbfounded at the sight unfolding in front of him.Seyra coated her blade with oil and replied, \u201cCan\u2019t you see? They\u2019re coming back to life as undead.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not just that they\u2019re coming back to life. They\u2019re coming back stronger than before. There must be a black magician hiding somewhere behind all this,\u201d Lenox said. He drew his blade and shouted, \u201cAll units! Go immediately to assist Sir Helkin!\u201dThe knights and soldiers immediately charged into the fray at Lenox\u2019s command.Seyra struck her blade against the stone pavement and dragged it in a crescent shape. Sparks flew all over, and the swordmaster\u2019s blade emitted brightly shining flames. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like cremating anything today, but I guess I have no choice,\u201d she muttered.\u201cBe careful not to burn any of the plants his majesty the emperor adores!\u201d Lenox shouted.\u201cAh, please! I hope you\u2019re joking, Mr. Upright sir knight!\u201d Seyra retorted.The Centaurs were quickly cut down one by one when the imperial knights joined the battle, but their morale did not falter at all.\u201cThe Lord Lich, who has reached the pinnacle of black magic, stands with us!\u201d\u201cLet us borrow this evil energy and completely destroy the royal palace!\u201dThe Mini-Lich left at the back of the line was now stuck in a difficult position. It thought, \u2018I want to cry.\u2019It did not possess any immense powers like an average Lich, and to be honest, it had already had its hands full just dealing with Helkin alone. But now, with the joint attack of the imperial knights, the undead it had raised would be completely annihilated.\u2018This is a difficult task for someone like me who was just born,\u2019 the Mini-Lich thought. It inwardly cursed its master for leaving it with such a daunting task.However, it shook its head, as expected of the na\u00efve(?) Mini-Lich.\u2018This is all because I\u2019m not strong enough. Let\u2019s not blame master,\u2019 it thought.The Centaurs\u2019 front line was now completely annihilated, and the Mini-Lich at the back swung its staff at the Centaur army\u2019s second line. The Centaurs suddenly went berserk and charged madly toward their enemies.\u2018I want to cry, but why can\u2019t a skeleton cry?\u2019 the Mini-Lich thought as it sniffled.Helkin struck down four Centaurs in one fell swoop, then jumped high into the air. The old knight found the Mini-Lich hiding in the back lines in an instant and shouted, \u201cThat guy is the perpetrator behind this!\u201d\u201cAck!\u201d the Mini-Lich screamed as it was cut down by Helkin\u2019s ferocious sword. The force that hit it was strong enough to turn its bones into dust. However, it just sustained minor cracks in its bones and did not die.\u2018I-it\u2019s a good thing master took my life vessel with him\u2026\u2019 it thought. Of course, it would not be able to come back to life if its bones were ground into dust, and the Mini-Lich was aware of that fact.\u201cWall of Fog!\u201d the Mini-Lich shouted, and a thick black fog enveloped the area around it. Helkin immediately swung his sword toward the escaping Lich, but he did not manage to cut it down and the Lich managed to escape.\u201cThat rat-like bastard\u2026\u201d Helkin bit his lips before turning around and shouting, \u201cDame Seyra! Sir Lenox! I\u2019ll leave this place to you guys!\u201d\u201cSir Helkin! What do you mean by that?\u201d Seyra asked.Helkin replied in a cold, ferocious voice, \u201cDidn\u2019t you notice it? That sorry excuse of a lich was just here to stall for time. It was intentionally dragging the battle out, and I\u2019m sure the real perpetrator is here somewhere.\u201d\u201cDo you have somewhere in mind?\u201d Seyra asked.\u201cThere are a few\u2026 I\u2019ll go take a look,\u201d Helkin responded.Lenox suddenly shouted, \u201cSir Helkin! I\u2019ll go with you!\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no need for you to come along as well,\u201d Helkin replied.Seyra suddenly shook her head and said, \u201cNo, it\u2019s better to take him. Lenox will be a big help to you. I\u2019m more than enough to take care of this place.\u201d\u201cAlright,\u201d Helkin replied.The two imperial knight captains left the scene of the battle and headed toward the royal palace.Helkin looked around for a moment at places Lenox could not see, then suddenly said, \u201cOver there. There\u2019s a broken window.\u201d***There were two guardsmen guarding the entrance to the emperor\u2019s bedchamber. The usual clich\u00e9 was for guards standing watch to be hit from behind in the head and collapse, but that was not the case for these two. Only the best of the best of the imperial guardsmen were stationed to watch over the emperor\u2019s residence.\u201cWhat is the matter, Your Highness?\u201d one of the guardsmen asked.\u201cI have something urgent that I must relay to father,\u201d Princess Kisifran said in a warm, elegant voice.The guardsmen looked perplexed for a moment and asked, \u201cWho are those two men behind you, Your Highness?\u201d\u201cThey are my personal bodyguards,\u201d Princess Kisifran replied.The two guardsmen looked at each other and furrowed their brows before saying, \u201cWe cannot allow you to enter his Majesty\u2019s bedchamber at this hour even if it is Your Highness. It is all the more difficult with your bodyguards on top of that.\u201d\u201cIs there really no way around it?\u201d Princess Kisifran asked with a sad expression.The guardsmen were taken aback by the face the princess made. The princess had never made such a face at anyone before.\u201cYou guys are being too much the more I listen to this\u2026\u201d the man behind the princess said as he stepped forward. He seemed to possess the haughty arrogance usually carried by nobles. He said proudly, \u201cTo think that you would dare use the law and rules of the land against the bloodline of the royal family that established this empire. Do you think that makes any sense at all?\u201d\u201cThis is the bedchamber of his majesty the emperor. I am sure that you are well aware of the strict rules that were implemented by his majesty to prevent his assassination and kidnapping,\u201d the guardsman replied.\u201cThen you should stand aside all the more. His majesty might be in grave danger as we speak,\u201d the man insisted.\u201cHuh? What are you talking about, sir?\u201d the guardsman asked, shocked by the man\u2019s words.The haughty man lowered his voice and whispered, \u201cThis is something highly confidential related to the royal family. As such, do not go around telling this to anybody else. Actually, a letter arrived at the royal palace this afternoon from someone threatening to assassinate his majesty the emperor. Of course, the sender was not written, but we are currently assuming it was those pesky Traveler bastards.\u201d\u201cI-I see,\u201d the guardsman replied, still in shock.\u201cIf you get it, then stand aside! Every second counts!\u201d the man urged the guardsmen on.The guardsmen contemplated for a moment before standing aside and making way for the princess. \u2018Her highness the princess is with them; what could go wrong?\u2019 they thought.The trio entered the bedchambers of the emperor.\u201cThat expressionless man, who do you think he is? I\u2019ve never seen him before,\u201d one of the guardsmen asked.\u201cI don\u2019t know, but I\u2019m sure he\u2019s a high ranking man. It\u2019s been a while since I saw someone who spoke and moved so elegantly like a true noble that way,\u201d the other guardsman replied.\u201cHe seemed to be quite young, but he\u2019s already the personal bodyguard of her highness. He\u2019s really amazing. He must at least be the son of a marquis,\u201d the first guardsman remarked.\u201cHe lives in a world different from ours,\u201d the other guardsman added.The guardsmen let out a sigh and went back to standing watch over the emperor\u2019s bedchamber.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The room where the emperor slept was just through the door in front of them. The trio dropped their act as soon as the coast was clear, however.\u201cMy wrist hurts. It was so hard hiding my wrist device like that,\u201d Yu Si-Do complained as he took out the wrist device from his sleeve. A Traveler could not take their wrist device off, which was why they had to forcefully hide theirs under their sleeves.\u201cI feel sorry for Kisifran,\u201d Iris said, gripping the ends of her clothes. The princess\u2019 outfit was simple but luxurious.\u201cWe gave her your clothes in exchange, so don\u2019t worry about keeping those,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.\u201cCan I really?\u201d Iris asked in response.\u201cOf course! Although we did gag her and tie her up,\u201d Yu Si-Do said, snickering.They had bound Princess Kisifran and hidden her somewhere in the corner of the greenhouse, as they would immediately be executed if they were ever found by the royal guards.\u201cWe just have to not get caught. It\u2019s a relief the princess didn\u2019t see our faces,\u201d Yu Si-Do said as he took off the angel mask.Kang Yoon-Soo quietly kept his mask on as he moved slowly toward the room in front of him. He saw the emperor fast asleep on the bed in front of him once he entered the room. The emperor had a bed befitting his title as the highest authority on the continent.\u201cThe emperor is fast asleep. How do you plan to feed him the poison?\u201d Yu Si-Do asked in a whisper.Kang Yoon-Soo shook his head in response and said, \u201cThis man isn\u2019t the emperor.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Yu Si-Do exclaimed in surprise.\u201cHe\u2019s just a body double,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.Yu Si-Do stared intently at the old man with gray hair. Although the man appeared to be breathing while fast asleep, he seemed awkward for some reason. The sleeping emperor did not have a shadow.\u201cIsn\u2019t this an illusion?\u201d Yu Si-Do exclaimed in surprise.\u201cIt\u2019s a security spell that will activate if it\u2019s touched,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.Yu Si-Do seemed disgruntled by the fact that he had been fooled by it. He grumbled and chewed on his middle finger.\u201cTo think that he would set up a body double in his bedchambers. What kind of an emperor is he?\u201d Yu Si-Do complained.\u201cIt\u2019s because we\u2019re not the only assassins after the emperor\u2019s life,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.Yu Si-Do seemed surprised for a moment before he asked, \u201cThen where is the real emperor?\u201d\u201cHere,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said, pointing at a fancy closet.The other two tilted their heads in confusion as Kang Yoon-Soo walked toward the fancy closet and opened it. It was filled with various debonair suits and official outfits.\u201cThat\u2019s a lot of clothes. Don\u2019t tell me there\u2019s a hidden compartment behind this closet or something\u2026?\u201d Yu Si-Do asked with a grimace.\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo nonchalantly replied.\u201cDamn it\u2026 This is so corny. What is this? The Chronicles of Narnia?\u201d Yu Si-Do grumbled once again, sounding annoyed.Kang Yoon-Soo found a small indentation between the piles of clothes\u2014it was a keyhole.\u201cIf it\u2019s lock picking, I\u2019m the best! Hehe!\u201d Yu Si-Do excitedly pulled his sleeves and walked toward the keyhole.However, Kang Yoon-Soo shook his head and said, \u201cWe need the blood of a royal to open this.\u201d\u201cWhat? Then we can\u2019t open it?\u201d Yu Si-Do asked, sounding disappointed. Kang Yoon-Soo pointed at Iris with his chin. Yu Si-Do snapped his fingers as he came to a realization and exclaimed, \u201cSo that was it!\u201dYu Si-Do pulled up his sleeve and bit the blood-red jewel embedded in his arm. His hair suddenly turned white and his teeth turned into fangs. He grabbed Iris\u2019 wrist and sank his fangs into it, muttering, \u201cMmm\u2026 You taste good.\u201dIris looked at Yu Si-Do, her eyes wide with surprise, and said, \u201cI see Yu Si-Do can change races at will.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s my class specialty. I can embed special jewels into my body and copy the traits of the races in the jewels. Ah, the blood of a beauty is really delicious!\u201d Yu Si-Do explained, although he lost his train of thought toward the end.\u201cHow long are you planning to drink my blood?\u201d Iris asked.\u201cHngaah\u2026 Until my erection subsides?\u201d Yu Si-do replied with a moan.\u201cWhat is that?\u201d Iris asked innocently.\u201cAh you don\u2019t know? An erection is\u2026\u201d Yu Si-Do began.Suddenly\u2026Kwachik!Yu Si-do was smacked in the face, and he felt his fangs were in danger of being broken in half.Iris covered her face, which was bright red with embarrassment and said, \u201c\u2026oh my, that is really, really embarrassing. My face is getting so hot that I cannot raise my head anymore.\u201d\u201cHehe, just because of that much?\u201d Yu Si-Do said.\u201cStop it,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo interrupted..Iris extended her wrist that had blood flowing out of it and asked, \u201cKang Yoon-Soo, what should I do now?\u201d\u201cPut your finger covered in blood into the keyhole,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.Iris placed her bloody index finger into the keyhole. Cogs began audibly turning even though her finger did not fit the keyhole, and the back of the fancy closet opened up to reveal a new, wider space.\u201cIt smells like old books,\u201d Iris said.That new space was a study. Various kinds of codices and books lay along the narrow passage. Yu Si-Do picked up one of the old books on the floor and asked, \u201cIsn\u2019t this a book related to the Rogue Master\u2019s temple?\u201d[You have obtained clues related to the Temple of the First Rogue Master.][You may start the trials of the Rogue Master if you collect all of the 77 map pieces spread across the continent.][Your notoriety has exceeded 500 and you have satisfied the hidden condition to obtain additional rewards.]\u201cThe books in this place aren\u2019t ordinary. All of these contain rare and valuable information. There\u2019s no better place to shake the entire foundation of the continent than here. Alright! Let\u2019s burn it down!\u201d Yu Si-Do cackled like a maniac.The other two remained silent as they watched the maniacal theatrics put on by Yu Si-Do alone.Kang Yoon-Soo went deep into the study where a dim light from a lamp was shining. However, someone asked tiredly, \u201cThere\u2019s still time before the assembly; can\u2019t you let me rest for even a bit?\u201dThe light from the lamp brightened as Kang Yoon-Soo got closer. He saw an old man sitting at the desk going over some paperwork. The man looked exactly like the emperor\u2019s body double that had been lying on the bed a while before. However, the dark circles that had formed under his eyes and his skinny cheeks made him look even more pitiful.The old man glanced at Iris before returning to his paperwork. He remarked, \u201cKisifran, didn\u2019t I ask you not to tire your old father any more? As I said, I cannot grant you what you want. Also, why did you bring along a servant wearing that funny mask?\u201d\u201cAre you the emperor?\u201d Yu Si-Do asked, his voice filled with curiosity.The old man frowned and exclaimed, \u201cWhat is with your way of speech? Show some respect.\u201d\u201cRanford Reorkan,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said in a low voice and continued, \u201cI\u2019m not your subject.\u201d He showed the old man his wrist device. The emperor glanced at the wrist device, and his hands stopped busily handling the paperwork.\u201cWhat business does a Traveler from another world have with me?\u201d Emperor Ranford asked.\u201cI\u2019ve come to kill you,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.***Helkin and Lenox thoroughly inspected the area around the broken window. The two knight captains found a set of footprints and followed it until it stopped in front of a stone wall. They opened all of the doors in the vicinity, but they found no trace of the intruder anywhere.\u201cI checked the royal storage and even the vault, but I couldn\u2019t find any traces. I don\u2019t think they were after money or information,\u201d Lenox said.\u201cDamn it, did these people dig a tunnel or something? Even a ghost would be impressed by them\u2026\u201d Helkin grumbled.Unfortunately, the two knight captains fell short, and it was obvious that they would lose the intruder even if the other party passed by right in front of their eyes.\u201cSir Helkin.\u201d A long-haired man suddenly appeared beside Helkin and spoke.\u201cRumier, what brings you here?\u201d Helkin asked in a hostile tone. Every second counted in this situation, and Helkin did not wish to waste any time talking to the gloomy alchemist.\u201cI was on my way to my research facility, but you seemed to be quite busy. Are you looking for the ones who intruded into the royal palace?\u201d Rumier asked.\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Helkin replied.\u201cActually, I saw them,\u201d Rumier said.\u201cIs that true?\u201d Helkin asked in surprise.Rumier nodded and said, \u201cFollow me. It\u2019s something even I couldn\u2019t believe after seeing it with my own eyes.\u201dRumier led the two knight captains to the wall where the footsteps had been cut off. He stood in front of the wall and kicked it twice with his feet, then tapped it five times with his palm. The secret passage suddenly opened up. He said, \u201cThey went in here.\u201d\u201cDid you really just stand and watch all this happening?\u201d Helkin asked with a grimace.\u201cWhat good would it be if lowly researchers like me got involved with intruders?\u201d Rumier nonchalantly replied.Helkin glared at Rumier, but Lenox suddenly spoke up, \u201cLet\u2019s hurry. We can now trace them again.\u201d\u201cAlright,\u201d Helkin replied.Rumier stared at the backs of the two knight captains who had disappeared into the secret passage and muttered quietly, \u201cI hope things go well\u2026 Really\u2026\u201d***Yu Si-Do could not hide his ecstasy as his eyes started spinning. He had never imagined that someone would threaten to kill the highest authority on the continent personally to his face! Kang Yoon-Soo was much crazier than he had imagined.The emperor, Ranford Reorkan, bit his lips and asked, \u201c\u2026Is my daughter your hostage?\u201d\u201cThis woman isn\u2019t your daughter. She\u2019s a doppelganger,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.The emperor sighed and scratched his temple with his pen, asking, \u201cWhat is your reason for killing me? I doubt you are involved in the succession issues of the royal family.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll turn senile once you turn sixty, and you\u2019ll interfere with my plans. That\u2019s why I have to kill you now,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo explained.\u201cWhat is the cause of death?\u201d Ranford Reorkan asked.\u201cPoison,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied, taking out a vial with a purple flower in it.The emperor let out a bitter smile and said, \u201cWhat a sick hobby you have. To think that it would be the flower of madness, of all things.\u201dKang Yoon-Soo suddenly said something unexpected. \u201cDon\u2019t take it if you don\u2019t want to.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Ranford Reorkan asked in response.\u201cAs I said, don\u2019t take it if you don\u2019t want to die. The choice is yours,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.Yu Si-Do\u2019s eyes opened wide in surprise and he asked, \u201cWhat are you talking about? You have to force-feed him if necessary, if you plan to kill him. Don\u2019t tell me you feel sorry for this old man after coming all the way here?\u201dHowever, Kang Yoon-Soo just stared silently at the emperor. The emperor took the vial with the purple flower and looked alternately between the vial and Kang Yoon-Soo. He let out a sigh and asked, \u201cWhat do you think the life of an emperor is like? I mean a life where you can sit above everyone from the start.\u201dYu Si-Do mockingly answered, \u201cWell, no matter how much they complain, I\u2019ve never seen a person born with a golden spoon in their mouth go hungry.\u201d\u201cIs it because you are a Traveler? Your words are difficult to understand. Of course, my laments would sound like the troubles of the rich to you,\u201d Emperor Ranford said as he wiped his face with both of his hands. He continued with a trembling voice filled with an emperor\u2019s lamentation, \u201cI had a dream of wonderfully leading the empire, but do you know how much mental fortitude it took just to protect the throne from those nobles\u2019 lies and deceit? However, the result I obtained for protecting the throne was a disaster. All of my efforts have been for naught, and I am now tired.\u201dThe emperor\u2019s voice trembled, and his eyes shook as if he were afraid of someone who was not visible. \u201cI am not the one who controls the royal palace anymore. All of the authority within the royal palace is now in someone else\u2019s hands. I know not since when, but I was just a puppet doing his bidding; and now, it is too late to turn things around.\u201d He carefully opened the vial, and took out the purple flower from it.\u201cA person\u2019s death needs a reason behind it. Who knows? Perhaps I have been waiting for this justification for quite a long time. No, I am no longer sure\u2026 I am unsure whether I have to be thankful to you, or if I have to hate you for this\u2026\u201d Ranford Reorkan said as he ate the purple flower from the vial.The emperor\u2019s body spasmed for a moment, before he started laughing like a maniac.The emperor laughed.He kept laughing.And he continued laughing.Was he laughing because of the flower?Or did he want to laugh at his reality?It was a laughter that was difficult to understand.The emperor who laughed until the end finally collapsed on the spot.***\u201cWhat the hell happened just now\u2026?\u201d Yu Si-Do asked. He could not believe what had just happened in front of his eyes.The highest authority on the continent had just committed suicide.\u201cWhat the? What kind of an emperor commits suicide? He should\u2019ve at least resisted or something. Does it make sense that he died so anticlimactically?\u201d Yu Si-Do complained.\u201cThe emperor felt an intense urge to commit suicide in the first place,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.Kang Yoon-Soo was aware of that fact because of his hundreds of regressions. Ranford Reorkan had weighed himself down with a heavy burden, and he had pushed himself into a corner because of his self-inflicted expectations. He had carried that hysteria with him all the way till he was old and he became senile.All Kang Yoon-Soo had done was to give the emperor\u2019s piled up frustrations a slight push.\u201cIs he really dead?\u201d Yu Si-Do asked. He could not believe what just happened, so he checked the emperor\u2019s pulse, but the emperor was really dead.Yu Si-Do looked at Kang Yoon-Soo as if he were already fed up with him and asked, \u201cHmm\u2026 So are telling me you coaxed the emperor to commit suicide?\u201d\u201cI just suggested it to him,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.\u201cAnd the emperor fell for your suggestion?\u201d Yu Si-Do asked.\u201cYeah,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo nonchalantly replied.Yu Si-Do exclaimed as if this were his first time hearing something so unbelievable, \u201cIt\u2019s my first time seeing an assassination like this! Where the hell in the world would you find an assassin who used such a method that\u2019s so unheard of?!\u201d\u201cHere,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo confidently said as he raised his hand. The emperor was dead as he had planned, and it was now time to find the alchemist who had created Iris. He walked out of the study.It was at that moment that Kang Yoon-Soo walked out of the study that a ferocious blade struck toward him.Slash!The blade narrowly missed Kang Yoon-Soo by a hair and sliced the air in front of him. He would have been split in half if he had not moved backward just in time.Kang Yoon-Soo placed his hand on his blade, thinking inwardly, \u2018What was that?\u2019The one who had appeared from the darkness was an old knight. He frowned like a demon when he saw the emperor lying on the ground as he shouted ferociously, \u201cYou! Are you out of your mind?!\u201dHelkin glared with murderous intent as he swung his sword, and Kang Yoon-Soo instinctively drew his sword.The swords of the two men clashed.Clang!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Numerous bookshelves were destroyed when he collided with them as he rolled on the ground from the immense pressure created by that one strike. He hurriedly tried to get up, but found that the blade of Ravian\u2019s Longsword was severely broken.\u2018My right wrist is broken, and so is my sword.\u2019He threw his sword away and hid behind a bookshelf as the sound of Helkin\u2019s footsteps got closer.\u2018Why did Helkin show up at this time?\u2019Helkin was an enemy who was impossible for Kang Yoon-Soo to face at the moment. He was the strongest swordsman on the continent, who had reached the pinnacle of swordsmanship, wisdom, and combat experience.\u2018I even created a lich just to avoid fighting against Helkin, so what\u2019s going on?\u2019Kang Yoon-Soo pulled out the Slaughterer\u2019s Bloodsword with his left hand. He knew very well that even if his swordsmanship surpassed Helkin\u2019s, the gap between their basic stats was just too wide, and that he had no chance if he faced Helkin head on.\u201cHey, Kang Yoon-Soo, what\u2019s going on?\u201d Yu Si-Do asked as he came out of the study.Suddenly, another knight ran toward Yu Si-Do and shouted, \u201cWind, Bless My Sword!\u201dLenox pulled his sword out and slashed multiple times in a split second, but Yu Si-Do nimbly dodged the attack.\u201cHmm? What are you doing?\u201d Yu Si-Do asked.\u201cYou\u2019re faster than you look,\u201d Lenox replied.Yu Si-Do and Lenox were left in standoff.\u2018How the hell is he so fast?\u2019 Yu Si-Do thought.Suddenly, Kang Yoon-Soo shouted, \u201cDon\u2019t fight them! Let\u2019s escape this place.\u201dHelkin walked toward the study where the voice had come from. He readied his sword and ran toward the back of the study.\u201cYou dare point your sword at me?\u201dHelkin immediately stopped when he saw a blonde beauty glaring at him angrily. He lowered his sword and asked, \u201cYour Highness! Are you alright?\u201d\u201cDo I look alright to you?!\u201d Princess Kisifran shouted angrily.After lowering his sword, Helkin went to her side and said, \u201cYour Highness, this place is dangerous. His majesty is no longer with us, so at least you will have to preserve your\u2026\u201dHe suddenly felt a chilling killing intent near the back of his neck. He instinctively ducked, and a sword sliced past his neck. The sword, thrown by Kang Yoon-Soo, flew over his head and destroyed a bookshelf in the study.Kwachik!\u201cYou son of a\u2026!\u201d Helkin raised his sword and\u2026Pukeok!A strong force struck Helkin in the back of his head, and blood started flowing down. He sustained a minor wound, but did not collapse. He turned around and glared at Iris ferociously, saying, \u201cYou are not the princess.\u201d\u201cThat was strong enough to break your skull. How are you still standing?\u201d Iris asked.Kang Yoon-Soo immediately ran toward Iris and grabbed her. The sword aimed for her neck passed right above her head; she would have been decapitated by Helkin\u2019s sword if Kang Yoon-Soo had not pushed her down.Kwachik!A bookshelf had been cut in half. Iris would have been too if it were not for Kang Yoon-Soo.\u201cHey, old man! She looks like the princess, right? Can\u2019t you hesitate for a bit before you swing your sword like that?!\u201d Yu Si-Do protested toward the old knight.The captain of the First Order of the Imperial Knights replied with grandeur and authority, \u201cEven the princess would die by my sword if she tried to break my skull.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a wise answer to my silly question. I acknowledge it,\u201d Yu Si-Do said. He immediately bent his waist to avoid a strike from Lenox. He then stuck out his tongue at Lenox and asked, \u201cCan\u2019t you just let us escape?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll pass on answering that,\u201d Lenox replied.\u201cHa, you\u2019re no fun at all\u2026\u201d Yu Si-Do complained.Kang Yoon-Soo put Iris behind him and stood in front of Helkin. Helkin, on the other hand, had already finished preparing to swing his sword. Kang Yoon-Soo stared at Helkin with a sincere and serious gaze and said, \u201cHelkin, I know what your future will be.\u201d\u2018If it\u2019s not possible to face him head on, I have to roll the dice at least.\u2019Helkin nodded and replied, \u201cI know it too, rabbit mask. I will be killing you in a moment from now.\u201dHelkin swung his sword once, but Kang Yoon-Soo was able to avoid it since he had preemptively expected the sword\u2019s trajectory.\u2018I have to think of a way out.\u2019Kang Yoon-Soo glanced around the study. Lenox was blocking the only exit, and the only other exit in the study was a small window. He and Iris were starting to be cornered by Helkin. He asked, \u201cAren\u2019t you curious as to how you\u2019ll die later on?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not curious at all,\u201d Helkin replied as he swung his sword again.Kang Yoon-Soo narrowly avoided Helkin\u2019s attack again; it was all thanks to memorizing Helkin\u2019s attack pattern from his previous lives. However, no matter how well he knew Helkin\u2019s pattern, it did not make avoiding it any easier. The walls in the study started to crumble from the weight of Helkin\u2019s attacks.\u2018A simple foretelling won\u2019t do\u2026 I need something to draw his attention.\u2019Kang Yoon-Soo felt his back break out into a cold sweat as he tried to come up with various solutions in his head.\u2018Should I summon the undead? No, they\u2019ll only get butchered by Helkin.\u2019\u201cI know the secret surrounding the royal palace. Aren\u2019t you curious about the person in the shadows of the royal palace, whom even the emperor feared so much he killed himself?\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo asked.Helkin did not bother replying anymore. He just walked toward Kang Yoon-Soo while wielding his sword with murderous intent.However, the one who reacted was Lenox, who asked, \u201cShadows of the royal palace?\u201dKang Yoon-Soo did not miss his chance to reply, \u201cYeah, the shadows of the royal palace. The person who will swallow the whole continent is in this palace.\u201d\u201cWho in the\u2026\u201d Lenox trailed off and furrowed his brow. Suddenly, Yu Si-Do took out a dagger from his sleeve and threw it toward him. Lenox immediately blocked the dagger with his sword.Clang!The dagger that had been deflected by the knight\u2019s sword flew toward Helkin, and Helkin immediately turned around to block the dagger flying toward him.Kang Yoon-Soo did not miss that small opening. He charged at Helkin and muttered, \u201cAbyssal Sword.\u201d It was the strongest skill he possessed at the moment.Helkin prepared to receive Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s attack, but Kang Yoon-Soo was not aiming for Helkin at all.Kwachik! Rumble\u2026! Rumble\u2026!A bookshelf was destroyed by Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s attack. All sorts of codices and books fell from it, and the rest of the bookshelves started falling like a line of dominos. A wave of books crashed down on Helkin.\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said as he and Iris stepped over the mountain of books.Lenox used his sword skill to charge at the trio. \u201cWind, Bless My Sword!\u201dThe sword enveloped with a ferocious wind charged toward them, but Kang Yoon-Soo ducked and easily parried it. Lenox suddenly asked in surprise, \u201cThis swordsmanship\u2026 You\u2026 Are you the one from the Hatar Mountains\u2026?\u201d\u201cGet out of the way, Lenox!\u201d Helkin shouted as he got up from the mountain of books piled atop him and charged toward the trio. The old knight swung his sword angrily with all his might.Slaaash!It was not an attack he could avoid, so Kang Yoon-Soo chose to stand in a defensive posture, readying his sword.Clang!He felt his arm breaking upon receiving Helkin\u2019s attack, and he flew backward.\u201cKang Yoon-Soo! Are you alright?\u201d Iris asked.Kang Yoon-Soo stumbled a bit before standing up by himself. He said, \u201cWe\u2019ll get caught if we run into the corridor. Let\u2019s escape through the window.\u201d\u201cThe window? Are you suggesting we fly or something?\u201d Yu Si-Do exclaimed as he looked out of the window.The Royal Library, which was directly opposite from them, was some distance away. It was not a distance a normal human being could jump across.\u2018I planned to jump over it by summoning White, but I guess we have no time,\u2019 Kang Yoon-Soo thought. As Helkin walked toward them with murderous intent, he whispered to the other two, \u201cHold on to me.\u201dHelkin ferociously swung his sword, and the trio was instantly blown away by the old knight\u2019s immense strength.Baaam!\u201cGaaah!\u201dKang Yoon-Soo, Iris, and Yu Si-Do were launched into the air. The old knight\u2019s monstrous strength blew them out of the window and they fell onto the royal palace roof.Baam!\u201cPhew! We made it out alive!\u201d Yu Si-Do was the first to speak as he got up and dusted his clothes off.Iris did not seem to have sustained any serious injuries, but Kang Yoon-Soo, who had taken the brute force of Helkin\u2019s sword head-on, had not come out of it unscathed. His last remaining sword was shattered to pieces, and his abdomen felt as if it were about to crumble inside him. \u2018I think I broke four or five ribs\u2026\u2019 he thought.Yu Si-Do helped Kang Yoon-Soo stand up and said, \u201cWell, we managed to get away. I\u2019m sure they can\u2019t just follow us all the way here.\u201dHowever, Kang Yoon-Soo shook his head and said, \u201cIf it\u2019s Helkin, he\u2019ll definitely follow us. Let\u2019s go down to the library before he catches up to us.\u201d\u201cHow will he follow us here?\u201d Yu Si-Do asked as he stared at the other side where Helkin was.Helkin moved a few steps back before starting to run at full speed. Yu Si-Do exclaimed in surprise, \u201dIs he thinking of jumping all the way here?\u201dTak!Helkin jumped off a broken section of the wall and landed lightly atop the library\u2019s roof. He said, \u201cI swung my sword quite seriously a while ago, but you received it quite well. You seem to have used the sword quite a bit.\u201d\u201cIs this old man even human? What is he, a human bulldozer?\u201d Yu Si-Do asked.Helkin walked toward them. Kang Yoon-Soo looked at Helkin while lightly tapping his foot on the roof\u2014there was only one way now.\u201cIris,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Iris replied.\u201cBreak the roof,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo commanded.Iris smashed her fist into the roof once.Baaam!Helkin tried to attack immediately, but his movements were hampered by the shaking roof.A second time.Baaam!Yu Si-Do bit Helkin\u2019s leg with his fangs.A third time.Baaam!The old knight and the regressor stared at each other.A fourth time.Baaam!C\u2014crack\u2026 Crack\u2026 Kwachik\u2026!The roof collapsed.***The royal library was the place that housed the biggest collection of books on the continent, and a young boy named Tommy inside reading storybooks.\u2018I\u2019ll become a scholar when I grow up!\u2019Tommy did not particularly like books, but he also did not like the fact that his grandfather had to fight all the time, which was why he had decided to be a scholar.\u2018I really don\u2019t like seeing blood. That\u2019s why I have to stay up all night and read books from now on. Then I can become a scholar.\u2019People always said the sky would fall if one did something new all of a sudden, but would it really fall?[1]However, the sky really did fall.Kwachik!The ceiling collapsed and its rubble scattered all over the library. There was nobody else in the library so early in the morning, so fortunately, nobody was trapped underneath the rubble, but Tommy was scared out of his wits.\u2018Ack! The ceiling must have collapsed because I decided to start reading books!\u2019Tommy hurriedly closed his storybook and vowed never to touch another book ever again, but when he was about to return the book to where it belonged, he heard an unfamiliar voice call out to him, \u201cHelp me.\u201dIt was a voice that sounded as hostile as the evil lizard\u2019s voice in the story he had just read.Tommy gulped as he slowly approached the pile of rubble, and he saw a man wearing the mask of a bunny underneath it.\u201cA-are you alright, hyunga?[1]\u201d Tommy asked.\u201cNo,\u201d the bunny said.\u201cH-how can I help?\u201d Tommy asked.\u201cHelp me get free from this rubble,\u201d the bunny requested.\u201cHow? The rubble is too heavy,\u201d Tommy asked.\u201cPull my arm. I can\u2019t stand up,\u201d the bunny said.Tommy was reluctant to help the stranger, and he even thought that the man could actually be an evil person. However, the man had a bunny mask on, and Tommy came to a conclusion that the man must be a good person.\u2018Grandpa told me not to help anyone and everyone, but it should be fine because he\u2019s a bunny.\u2019Tommy grabbed the man\u2019s arm and pulled it with all his might, and the man broke free from the rubble far more easily than he thought.The man got up, and Tommy asked him, \u201cHyunga, what do you do?\u201dThe man showed Tommy his wrist device. Tommy exclaimed, \u201cWow! You must be a Traveler. I\u2019m Tommy.\u201d\u201cI know,\u201d the man replied.Kang Yoon-Soo looked around the 6th floor of the royal library. Fortunately, it seemed he had accurately pinpointed its location.Suddenly, he gripped Tommy\u2019s neck tightly.\u201cAck! Cough! H-hyunga!\u201d Tommy struggled.\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo whispered.A ferocious voice akin to a hostile beast rang out from the top of the pile of rubble. \u201cTake your hands off of him this instant!\u201d Helkin looked at Kang Yoon-Soo, his eyes trembling with anger.Kang Yoon-Soo choked Tommy more tightly and said, \u201cHelkin, let us go if you want to save your grandson.\u201d\u201cCoward!\u201d Helkin roared, glaring at Kang Yoon-Soo with eyes full of hate and murderous intent. He said, \u201cTo think you would try to preserve your own life by taking another\u2019s family as a hostage. Do you have a family? Are you not ashamed of yourself?\u201dKang Yoon-Soo stopped for a moment, and the hand that was choking Tommy loosened. However, he said, \u201cI can do worse things than this if it means I can kill the Demon Lord.\u201dHelkin grit his teeth and sheathed his sword. \u201cI\u2019ll let you go, so let go of Tommy outside the royal palace. If you kill my grandson, I will hunt you down to the ends of the word,\u201d he said threateningly.Kang Yoon-Soo pondered for a moment whether he should ask Helkin to hand over his sword, but he remembered that the sword Helkin was using required the user to have the class \u2018Knight Captain\u2019.\u201cHa! I\u2019m alive!\u201d Yu Si-Do exclaimed with a sigh of relief.\u201cIt was really dangerous this time,\u201d Iris said.Kang Yoon-Soo found Iris and Yu Si-Do, and the trio left the royal library. Kang Yoon-Soo let go of the kid and said, \u201cGo to your grandfather.\u201dTommy gasped for air and asked while sniffling, \u201cI-is hyunga a bad person?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.Tommy looked at Kang Yoon-Soo for a moment before running away as quickly as he could. Kang Yoon-Soo looked down at his hand, and saw that his palm was wet with sweat.\u201cKang Yoon-Soo is a good person,\u201d Iris said.Then Kang Yoon-Soo asked, \u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cNobody asked you to, but you are trying to save the world all by yourself,\u201d Iris replied. Kang Yoon-Soo just quietly stared at Iris. The blonde beauty covered in dust smiled and said, \u201cThat is how I think of it, at least.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Group 7, head to the west of the palace!\u201dHowever, contrary to what the royal guards thought, the trio had already managed to escape the royal palace.Kang Yoon-Soo was severely injured, and he could not even run properly anymore. He called out, \u201cIris.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Iris asked.\u201cCarry me on your back,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.Suddenly, Yu Si-Do quickly ran up to Kang Yoon-Soo and picked him up. Kang Yoon-Soo stared at Yu Si-Do, and Yu Si-Do remarked, \u201cIs there anything I can\u2019t do for my unwell lover?\u201dIris tilted her head and asked, \u201cHmm\u2026 Yu Si-Do, do you love Kang Yoon-Soo?\u201d\u201cActually\u2026 I\u2019m currently contemplating whether I should cross over to the gay side of the fence or not\u2026\u201d Yu Si-Do answered.\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.They reached a residential area after escaping the royal guards\u2019 encirclement. Kang Yoon-Soo took off his bunny mask, then took out his last remaining healing potion and drank it. The healing potion was actually for exterior application, but it could also be ingested to treat internal and skeletal injuries.\u2018It\u2019s going to take a while for my bones to mend,\u2019 he thought. He pushed Yu Si-Do\u2019s hand away and stood up. His body complained by making all sorts of cracking sounds, but he ignored it and continued to walk.\u201cAre you leaving my embrace already?\u201d Yu Si-Do asked as he took off his mask; he looked quite sad about Kang Yoon-Soo leaving his embrace. He had already reverted from a vampire to a homunculus, and his eyes were glowing brown.Kang Yoon-Soo pointed at an alley and said, \u201cYour comrades are here.\u201dThe silhouettes of several people started to appear one by one from the dark alley, and a man with a massive halberd on his back came forward. The man\u2019s cheek had a large tattoo of a black tiger on it.\u201cYou made it out alive, boss! You sent us a message to kill everyone, right?\u201d the man with the black tiger tattoo on his face said.\u201cNo, Mason! I changed my mind. Don\u2019t kill these guys. They turned out to be quite interesting,\u201d Yu Si-Do said.The man called Mason scratched his beard a few times and said, \u201cYou\u2019re so indecisive. Let\u2019s go! We\u2019re all itching to start the revenge match against the White Lion Clan. We can\u2019t start getting revenge without the boss, right?\u201d He then walked away.Contrary to the expectations of the White Lion Clan, most of the Black Tiger Clan members were still alive.Yu Si-Do snickered and waved his hand before saying, \u201cI hope I\u2019ll get to enjoy another intense night with you again, just like last night. See you again, Kang Yoon-Soo.\u201d He walked into the alley and disappeared into the darkness.Iris squinted and blocked the sunlight from the now-rising sun and said, \u201cA day has passed.\u201d\u201cYeah,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.It had been a long night. The two went to a nearby fountain and washed off the dust and muck on their faces.Kang Yoon-Soo glanced at Iris\u2019 long flowing golden hair and took out the Body Crafting Kit from his backpack, saying, \u201cLet\u2019s change your hair back to brown.\u201d\u201cBut I like this blonde color better,\u201d Iris said.\u201cNo,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied. Tears welled up in Iris\u2019 eyes, showing her refusal to change her hair color.Then, Kang Yoon-Soo whispered in a small voice, \u201cI\u2019ll make you some tasty food later.\u201d***Shaneth pressed down on her temples while lying down on the bed, just as anyone suffering from a hangover would. She muttered, \u201cI\u2019m going to die\u2026\u201d\u201cTsk tsk\u2026 See? I told you to casually drink up every chance you got. You\u2019re suffering because you didn\u2019t build up your tolerance,\u201d Henrick said, clicking his tongue.Shaneth was about to retort against the preposterous words the middle-aged man had said, but her insides were taken over by intense nausea and she could not retort at all. Henrick clicked his tongue again and passed a glass of cold water to her.\u201cThank you, ahjussi,\u201d Shaneth said.\u201cDon\u2019t mind it. Anyway, did someone throw me onto the floor last night? Why does my back hurt so much?\u201d Henrick asked as he rubbed his back.\u201cI don\u2019t remember much about last night, but why is it so rowdy outside?\u201d Shaneth asked as she opened the door and looked outside.The members of the White Lion Clan were busily moving up and down the corridor while shouting at each other.\u201cThe guy locked up in the basement prison. You know, the boss of the Black Tiger Clan? Yu Si-Do? He escaped,\u201d Henrick said.\u201cReally?\u201d Shaneth asked. She suddenly felt anxious for some reason. She looked around and whispered, \u201cBut where is Kang Yoon-Soo?\u201d\u201cNo idea; I couldn\u2019t find him this morning,\u201d Henrick said.Shaneth gulped dryly and said, \u201c\u2026No way. It\u2019s not what I think it is\u2026 right?\u201d\u201cHey, you punk! Be careful what you wish for! I know he does all sorts of crazy things from time to time, but do you think he would do something that crazy?\u201d Henrick exclaimed, reprimanding Shaneth like an adult scolding a child.Then, the room door suddenly opened. A man entered and screamed, \u201cKang Yoon-Soo, where is that bastard?!\u201d\u201cPlease calm down, Pashu!\u201d Chris exclaimed.Pashu entered the room in a fit of rage wielding his chakram[1], and Chris barely managed to calm him down.Henrick was surprised by the scene caused by the two White Lion Clan members, and he asked in confusion, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u201cWhat happened? The guard watching over Yu Si-Do last night gave his statement. That bastard Kang Yoon-Soo knocked him out and entered the basement prison!\u201d Pashu shouted angrily.Henrick closed his eyes upon hearing Pashu\u2019s words, then suddenly stood up while closing his fists. He shouted, \u201cThat damn punk!\u201d\u201cAhjussi, calm down!\u201d Shaneth exclaimed, trying to stop him.Pashu and Henrick entered into an argument while shouting.\u201cI asked you where that bastard Kang Yoon-Soo is! Don\u2019t try to hide him!\u201d Pashu screamed.\u201cI don\u2019t know! You know what? I want to know where that punk is as well! I\u2019ll cut him up with my sculpting knife if I find him!\u201d Henrick screamed as well.It seemed as if the situation would devolve into utter chaos. Chris dragged Pashu out of the room, however. Amanda entered and apologized afterward. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Things happened so suddenly that everyone\u2019s too tense. I\u2019ll call you to the hall on the first floor later, so let\u2019s talk when things quiet down a bit.\u201dAll of the White Lion Clan members left the room. Henrick let out a big sigh, looking completely exhausted as he remarked, \u201cThere\u2019s never a quiet day with that guy.\u201d\u201cShouldn\u2019t you be used to it by now? By the way, where\u2019s Iris unni?\u201d Shaneth said.\u201cNo idea. That kid was missing all morning too,\u201d Henrick said.Suddenly, noises came from outside the window.Knock knock\u2026!Someone was knocking on the window\u2014it was Kang Yoon-Soo.\u201c\u2026isn\u2019t this the 4th floor?\u201d Henrick asked, dumbfounded.Kang Yoon-Soo was holding onto the window, and his lips quietly moved as he mouthed, \u2018Come out.\u2019\u201cHow? Do you want us to jump down from the 4th floor?\u201d Henrick asked.Kang Yoon-Soo pointed at the curtain. Henrick grumbled as he ripped the curtain up and tied it into a makeshift rope.\u201cJust when you think you\u2019ve experienced everything with this guy, now we\u2019re doing a \u2018mansion break\u2019. Why does it feel as if we\u2019ve only done criminal activities in the capital?\u201d Henrick grumbled.\u201cI thought you would get mad and refuse to do it, but you seem to be doing it quite well despite your grumblings,\u201d Shaneth remarked.\u201cDo you think those White Lion guys will leave us alone? Don\u2019t you remember how they looked down on us Continentals? It\u2019s better to make a run for it while they\u2019re preoccupied with things,\u201d Henrick replied.Shaneth and Henrick quietly lowered the makeshift rope down the window and climbed down, quietly landing behind the mansion. Kang Yoon-Soo jumped across multiple window frames and came down as well. He stumbled for a bit, but he was able to maintain his balance once he landed.\u201cLet me ask. Why did you free Yu Si-Do?\u201d Henrick asked.\u201cI have my reasons,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.\u201cThen at least you shouldn\u2019t have gotten caught!\u201d Henrick retorted.\u201cThey would have found out sooner or later anyway,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.Henrick quietly took out his sculpting knife and stared at Kang Yoon-Soo. It was only after Shaneth calmed him down that he put his sculpting knife away again.\u201cI was about to turn you into a sculpture, you punk,\u201d Henrick grumbled.\u201cI don\u2019t want to be a sculpture,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied. It sounded as if he had experienced becoming a sculpture once before, or something.\u201cGood morning to everyone,\u201d Iris said with a bright smile.\u201cIris unni?\u201d Shaneth looked at her with a perplexed expression.\u2018Did Iris go with Kang Yoon-Soo as well\u2026?\u2019 Shaneth thought. She asked, \u201cWhere did you go overnight?\u201dKang Yoon-Soo summarized everything that had happened the previous night. He said, \u201cA walk.\u201dShaneth squinted and asked, \u201cJust the two of you?\u201d\u201cYu Si-Do was with us as well,\u201d Iris replied with a smile. Shaneth did not express it outwardly, but she let out a sigh of relief.\u201cYu Si-Do said he loves Kang Yoon-Soo,\u201d Iris said, suddenly dropping a bomb.\u201c\u2026what?!\u201d Shaneth exclaimed, flustered.\u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo asked, staring at Shaneth.***Kang Yoon-Soo left through the back gate of the mansion and went up a hill. Shaneth, who was right behind him, drew close to him and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s our next destination?\u201dKang Yoon-Soo was about to respond to Shaneth when a familiar voice called out from a distance.\u201cWhere are you rushing off to?\u201d Han Se-Hyun called out. He was biting a reed and rubbing a leaf with his bare hands, and cuts appeared on the leaf as his fingers lightly grazed it. He said, \u201cGive me an answer if you want to get past me.\u201d\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo asked.\u201cYu Si-Do. Why did you let him escape?\u201d Han Se-Hyeon asked.\u201cI said I\u2019d make you the emperor. I didn\u2019t say I would help you destroy the Black Tiger Clan,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.Han Se-Hyun stared at Kang Yoon-Soo skeptically and said, \u201cYou should\u2019ve been aware what kind of relationship I have with Yu Si-Do. To be honest, it\u2019s not that easy for me to forgive you for helping him escape. Do you really plan to make me the emperor? I\u2019m starting to suspect that you\u2019re just feeding me excuses to use me.\u201dKang Yoon-Soo nonchalantly replied, \u201cI killed Emperor Ranford just now.\u201d\u201c\u2026What did you just say?\u201d Han Se-Hyeon asked. He could not hide his shock toward Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s words.\u201cLook into it,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said as he passed by Han Se-Hyun.Han Se-Hyun turned around and looked at Kang Yoon-Soo before breaking out into a loud laugh and exclaiming, \u201cYou\u2019re really a scary guy! That\u2019s why I\u2019m even more curious now.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo asked.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just become the emperor yourself?\u201d Han Se-Hyun asked in return.\u201cI don\u2019t want to,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.\u201c\u2026That does sound like something you would say,\u201d Han Se-Hyun remarked. He looked down at the three people behind Kang Yoon-Soo, and he waved his hand and said, \u201cI\u2019ll explain to my clan members, so the three of you can just go too. I hope to see you guys again, especially the little miss who looks as beautiful as our vice captain!\u201dHan Se-Hyun had a big smile on his face as he walked back toward the mansion.Henrick had a dumbfounded look on his face as he walked up to Kang Yoon-Soo and asked, \u201cYou, what the hell did you just say? Did you really kill his majesty?\u201d\u201cHe committed suicide in front of me,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.\u201cHis majesty did struggle with depression, but to think that he committed suicide? Ha\u2026 How in the world did this happen\u2026? Eh? Wait a minute! Then does that mean you were at the royal palace last night?!\u201d Henrick shouted, jumping in surprise.Kang Yoon-Soo did not respond, as usual. Even though this was his last life, it would only waste his precious time to explain everything step by step to people.\u2018I didn\u2019t get to meet the alchemist who created Iris in the end\u2026\u2019The security of the royal palace would be reinforced from now on, and there would no longer be any invasions by another hostile race like the Centaurs, so it was no longer possible to sneak into the royal palace by jumping over the fence or even by using shapeshifting magic.\u2018Is that why Helkin and Lenox crossed paths with me?\u2019It should not have been possible for Helkin and Lenox to track Kang Yoon-Soo, since he had used the secret passage in the royal palace, and it was the same in all of his previous lives. Why was it different in this life?\u2018It seems someone wanted me out of the royal palace.\u2019Kang Yoon-Soo suddenly felt nervous and on guard when the thought crossed his mind. He could not get anywhere near the royal palace for the time being, and he had made an enemy out of Helkin.\u2018There\u2019s something I don\u2019t know about in the royal palace.\u2019Kang Yoon-Soo closed his fists at the thought of the unfamiliar\u2014change. He had lived the same life and everything had progressed in the same pattern, but things had only changed now in his 1,000th life. Why was that?\u2018I have to grow stronger to solve this mystery, strong enough that no one would dare stand in my way.\u2019Kang Yoon-Soo decided that he needed to leave for now, but he would be returning to the capital once again in the future when he had grown strong enough to bulldoze through the security of the royal palace.\u2018I guess I can only find out the identity of the White Shadow then.\u2019Shaneth walked up to Kang Yoon-Soo and asked, \u201cI asked but was interrupted a while ago. Where are we heading to now?\u201d\u201cThe Desert of Death,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied. Shaneth\u2019s face suddenly turned pale, and Henrick began to carve something on a nearby tree.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Shaneth asked.\u201cLeaving my will. Do you want to leave something behind as well?\u201d Henrick replied.\u201c\u2026Please don\u2019t make jokes like that. Dark humor isn\u2019t funny, you know?\u201d Shaneth remarked with a frown.Iris tilted her head as she looked at the two oddballs. Henrick suddenly stretched as if nothing had happened when he noticed that Iris was staring at them.\u201cWell, I guess it won\u2019t be a boring trip, at least,\u201d Henrick said.***Rumier Kazan walked through the royal greenhouse. He hated all flowers in the world, which was why the greenhouse was the last place he wanted to be in.\u201cGood morning, Your Highness,\u201d he said as he looked at the tied-up princess. Princess Kisifran struggled and groaned, glaring at Rumier as if she were telling the alchemist to untie her at once. However, the alchemist just stood there watching her and said something strange. \u201cYour Highness, why do you think people refuse to accept their fate?\u201dThe alchemist suddenly took off the shirt the princess was wearing, and Princess Kisifran was flustered by the sudden shame she was being subjected to.\u201cThat\u2019s not called being open-minded. It\u2019s called selfishness. The fact that a mere mortal can dare to break the cycle of life and the laws of this world is nothing more than stubborn pride. A mortal that tries to reject their fate and break the cycle of life will definitely bring forth destruction,\u201d Rumier said.The alchemist traced a finger down the princess\u2019 back, and several letters suddenly appeared in its wake.[Sixth]\u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s only right for a world that should be destroyed to be destroyed,\u201d Rumier said. The Royal Alchemist erased the letters on the princess\u2019 back.Princess Kisifran suddenly started gasping for air, coughing vigorously. \u201cHack! Kaahp! Hap! Ha\u2026 ak\u2026\u201dThe princess\u2019 body started to turn cold.Rumier respectfully bowed to the princess and said, \u201cI wish you a pleasant fate, Your Highness.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The merchants took turns once in a while to receive the blessing of Sylphia, the Goddess of the Continent, and today was the water seller\u2019s turn to receive the Goddess\u2019 blessings.\u201cSell me some water!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a silver coin per canteen!\u201d\u201cDamn it, why would water be so expensive?\u201d\u201cDo you think it\u2019s easy to get ice-cold water in this heat?\u201d\u201cHey, still\u2026 It\u2019s too expensive. A silver coin will let you stay two nights at an inn! Give me a little discount, will you?\u201d\u201cGo away if you ain\u2019t buying!\u201dHenrick grumbled as he tossed a silver coin to the water-seller. The water-seller passed him a water canteen with small pieces of ice inside.\u201cI\u2019m thirsty too,\u201d Iris said.\u201cMe too,\u201d Shaneth added.\u201c\u2026Don\u2019t you guys have money? Why didn\u2019t you buy some a while ago\u2026?\u201d Henrick grumbled once again before passing the water canteen to Shaneth and Iris. He then turned toward Kang Yoon-Soo and asked, \u201cHow about you? Aren\u2019t you thirsty?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.The hot sun shone down on them. The moon of the Phoenix had descended, and the moon of the Solar had taken its place. The continent had now officially entered the summer season.\u201cI miss the chilling alcohol we got from the Castle of the Dead,\u201d Henrick grumbled as he chewed on a piece of ice.They were now at a store, and were purchasing quite a bit of food and water for their long journey ahead. Kang Yoon-Soo reached up a shelf to grab a liquor bottle when Shaneth suddenly grabbed his wrist.\u201cWhat?\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo asked.\u201cYou have to stop drinking excessively,\u201d Shaneth nagged.\u201cHey, look here, little miss. Aren\u2019t you being too cruel saying that to a guy who\u2019s more addicted to alcohol than drugs?\u201d Henrick remarked mockingly.However, Shaneth shook her head a few times and stood her ground, saying, \u201cNo, I\u2019ll make him quit drinking one way or another. It\u2019s dangerous for him to drink so much in the desert.\u201d She asked Kang Yoon-Soo, \u201cCan you not drink this time?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo nonchalantly replied.\u201cThen drink moderately, at least down to a bottle a day,\u201d Shaneth said.\u201cI said no,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.Kang Yoon-Soo and Shaneth glared at each other as if they were about to start fighting. Henrick smirked as if he found the sight of the two fighting entertaining.Iris looked quite curious as she asked, \u201cIs alcohol tasty?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a taste for an adult; you won\u2019t understand it yet,\u201d Henrick replied.Iris seemed upset by Henrick\u2019s words, as she glared at him and said, \u201cI am not a kid.\u201d\u201cThen are you an adult? I don\u2019t think so!\u201d Henrick replied mockingly.\u201cHenrick is stupid!\u201d Iris shouted, her eyes welling up with tears.Henrick was taken aback by Iris\u2019 sudden tears and hurriedly bought a bottle of grape wine that had a low alcohol percentage. He remarked, \u201cAhhh, I can\u2019t even tease you now? Here, drink it if you want to.\u201dIris took a sip of the wine, and her face contorted into a grimace as she said, \u201cIt does not taste good. It is bitter\u2026\u201d\u201cWell, look at this! You had no qualms eating those fishy, stinky hearts, so what\u2019s the fuss now?\u201d Henrick remarked.\u201cA heart has a chewy texture from beating and squirming,\u201d Iris replied.\u201cWhat bullshit are you talking about\u2026?\u201d Henrick shot back.The party lifted their luggage and exited the marketplace.Shaneth added \u2018Making Kang Yoon-Soo Drink Moderately\u2019 to the \u2018Impossible Things That Cannot Be Done in This World List\u2019. The disheartened woman asked as she sniffled, \u201cHow do you plan to reach the Desert of Death?\u201dThey did have the carriage they had received from the Sunset Glass Merchant Company, but there was a high chance that the carriage would get caught on Lefman\u2019s radar.\u201cLefman might have done it on purpose, but the wheels of that carriage were quite old. It would be impossible to ride that all the way to the Desert of Death,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.He eventually stopped a carriage that was going on its way on the road, and they stored their luggage in the luggage compartment.The coachman turned around and asked, \u201cWhere shall I take you to?\u201d\u201cRaviesk,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.\u201cAh, that\u2019s a rough place to visit these days. Do you have something you want to buy from the treasure hunters?\u201d the coachman asked.Shaneth asked curiously, \u201cWhat kind of a place is Raviesk?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a rugged and rough desert city in the southwest, and it mainly attracts rough treasure hunters since it\u2019s right beside the Desert of Death. You can easily find famous treasure hunter clans over there too,\u201d the coachman explained. Then, he scratched his chin and added, \u201cIt\u2019ll take more than ten days to get there, and it\u2019s going to cost a lot. Is that alright with you?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll pay you upfront,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.\u201cAigoo, thank you so much, kind sir!\u201d the coachman exclaimed. He counted the gold coins he received before starting to drive the carriage. The carriage containing the party started to move slowly with a creak.\u201cI\u2019m guessing we\u2019ll be traveling together until we reach there?\u201d Shaneth asked.\u201cIt sounds like this is your first time using a travel carriage. We usually make stops at night to rest, and we can make frequent stops whenever you want to take a break. We coachmen are usually capable enough to take care of our food and shelter during our stops, so you don\u2019t have to worry about us,\u201d the coachman said.\u201cAh, I see! Excuse me, but what is your good name?\u201d Shaneth politely asked.\u201cMy name is Slang[1],\u201d the coachman replied.Their carriage ride was quite peaceful. Slang stopped the carriage from time to time to spray water onto the roof of the carriage, making the interior feel cool and fresh while the carriage was running.\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to seeing what kind of place a desert is,\u201d Iris said.\u201cIt\u2019s also my first time going to a desert, but I\u2019m not that excited about it,\u201d Shaneth responded.\u201cTo think we\u2019re going to the desert in this summer heat\u2026 What a perfect plan to match the weather\u2026\u201d Henrick grumbled.***The carriage left the outskirts of the capital and entered a remote area. Slang stopped the carriage when it was starting to get darker outside; the sun had started to set.\u201cI suggest we stop here and rest for the night. Also, thank you very much!\u201d Slang exclaimed.\u201cWhat are you thanking us for?\u201d Shaneth asked.Slang looked at them with a bright smile and said, \u201cWon\u2019t you be donating your precious assets to us tonight?\u201dSuddenly, numerous masked men appeared one after another from the darkness as soon as Slang finished talking. He took out a dagger from under his sleeve and exclaimed, \u201cHand over all of your belongings!\u201dThe travel carriage was actually a carriage bandits used to steal from their unsuspecting passengers.However, their customers today were a bit different from their usual customers. Their usual victims would be stricken with fear by now and hand over all of their belongings, but these people were just staring at them and none of them were surprised at all.Henrick let out a sigh and said, \u201cI\u2019m not surprised anymore at all\u2026 Hey you, you took this carriage on purpose, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cYeah,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.\u201cYou\u2019re such an asshole\u2026\u201d Henrick sighed once again.Slang clicked his tongue and said, \u201cI don\u2019t think you understand what\u2019s going on.\u201dHe took the weakest-looking woman from among the victims and held his dagger to her neck, taking her hostage.However, what happened next was quite obvious. Iris punched Slang\u2019s chin, and his jaw dislocated, having been severely twisted.\u201cAck!\u201d\u201cSlang!\u201dThe bandits brandished their weapons threateningly and approached the party. Suddenly, however, balls of fire suddenly flew into their faces and burned them.\u201cOuch!\u201d\u201cH-hot!\u201dShaneth had gotten down from the carriage with her scythe in hand.\u201cThere\u2019s no need to roast their faces, is there?\u201d Henrick remarked, snickering.\u201cI\u2019m more experienced at handling the skill and I can control the temperature now, okay?\u201d Shaneth retorted as she swung her scythe against the remaining bandits charging at her.Then, a bandit in the back line started to chant a spell. \u201cO, mark of the blue flower! Grant me strength to punish thy enemies, and banish them to never-ending anguish, lost in the bright fire of fury amid the unending darkness of the night\u2019s a\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s taking you so long just to use one spell? I\u2019m getting bored waiting for you to finish,\u201d Henrick said with a sigh.Pukeok!Henrick\u2019s doll swung its leg and kicked the bandit in the mouth, shutting him up. Henrick leaned lazily on the carriage, simultaneously controlling twenty fighter dolls with ease.Kang Yoon-Soo slowly climbed down from the carriage, and he brought his hand to his waist to pull his sword out when he realized, \u2018I don\u2019t have a weapon.\u2019Ravian\u2019s Longsword and Slaughterer\u2019s Bloodsword had been destroyed by Helkin, and he had used up all of the equipment he took from the Crossed Swords Bandits when he summoned the Mini-Lich.The only weapon he had as of now was\u2026\u201cDie!\u201d A bandit charged at him and swung his sword.Kang Yoon-Soo easily avoided the attack and grabbed the bandit\u2019s neck with one hand.\u201cKe-heok!\u201d\u2018Should I take it?\u2019 Kang Yoon-Soo pondered for a moment whether he should steal the bandit\u2019s sword or not. However, he decided against it, thinking, \u2018Let\u2019s fight without any weapons for now.\u2019He was bound to face different kinds of battles, as it was his last life. It was at least an opportunity for him to measure how good his martial arts were.Kang Yoon-Soo slammed the bandit he was holding by the neck into the ground.\u201cKu-heok!\u201d\u2018The past life I lived as a boxer.\u2019Kang Yoon-Soo lightly warmed up with boxing footwork. Two bandits charged at him at the same time, but he easily avoided their attacks and counter-attacked with punches. One of the bandits was struck in the temple, while the other had his chin crushed by consecutive uppercuts.\u2018The past life I lived as a martial artist.\u2019Kang Yoon-Soo lightly stretched his leg and whipped the cheek of a bandit who tried to ambush him from behind. The bandit\u2019s cheekbone was crushed with an audible crunch.\u2018The past life I lived as a vagrant fighter.\u2019A large bandit and three skinny bandits surrounded him. A large, thick mace grazed his nose and three poison-laden daggers flew past his neck. However, Kang Yoon-Soo used the twelve-point defensive stance he had used quite frequently in a previous life.Pukeok!The four bandits were easily knocked down all at once.\u2018The past life I lived as a bare-handed slaughterer\u2026\u2019Kang Yoon-Soo brought up the memories of the past life when he had lived as a vicious slaughterer. However, Shaneth suddenly approached him from behind and tapped his shoulder, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s over.\u201dIt was only then that Kang Yoon-Soo snapped out of it and looked around his surroundings.Slang was on his knees kowtowing and begging for his life. \u201cP-please just spare my life\u2026!\u201dKang Yoon-Soo went straight to the point, saying, \u201cHand over all your belongings.\u201d***\u201cLook at this fella. He\u2019s definitely a premium breed!\u201d Henrick exclaimed as he stroked the mane of a gray horse. Four horses of different breeds and different colors were tied to the reins.\u201cT-they\u2019re the best horses we have in our possession,\u201d Slang said pitifully. Even bandits used horses, as the area was quite remote, far from any towns or settlements.Iris smiled brightly and stroked a beautiful white horse, saying, \u201cThis is really a cool and majestic white mane you have; I like it.\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re talking about white manes, don\u2019t we have one as well? You know, White?\u201d Henrick remarked mockingly.\u201cWerewolves are not my type,\u201d Iris said with a straight face.Shaneth asked out of curiosity, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you like werewolves?\u201d\u201cThey use their sense of smell to sniff out odors and tell which race someone in front of them is, even if that person has changed their form. That is why doppelgangers hate werewolves,\u201d Iris replied simply.\u201cAh\u2026 I-I see\u2026\u201d Shaneth stuttered. She frequently forgot about the fact that Iris was a doppelganger, since she had gotten used to traveling with her.Kang Yoon-Soo turned toward Slang and the other bandits and said, \u201cMoney and your belongings. In the back of the carriage, now.\u201dThe bandits gritted their teeth and cursed under their breath, but it was all for naught. Some of the bandits who were more docile were the first to walk toward the back of the carriage and put their belongings in it.Kang Yoon-Soo pointed to a few bandits without any hesitation and said, \u201cYou\u2019re hiding an earth magic staff and a ring with healing powers in your inner pocket. You, hand over your earrings with protection magic. Also, you, hand over the dagger embedded with a jewel you\u2019re hiding in your back pocket.\u201dKang Yoon-Soo knew exactly where all of the valuable items the bandits were hiding were. The bandits were left penniless thanks to Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s keen senses(?).\u2018Damn it!\u2019\u2018What the hell is that guy?!\u2019To think that the vicious bandits who had tried to hit it big had been robbed in reverse! It was a laughable story that was only going to be useful to flirt with barmaids.Henrick connected the reins of the four horses to the carriage and said, \u201cWe\u2019re ready to go.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo responded.The four people boarded the carriage with Kang Yoon-Soo sitting in the coachman seat with a whip. The carriage seemed to run much more smoothly and quickly after they changed to the new set of horses.\u201cHehe, stupid fools,\u201d Slang said as he watched the carriage go into the distance.\u201cI bet those fools could never imagine that this area is filled with our traps.\u201d\u201cEven the Investigators can\u2019t identify the traps we installed.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s when we\u2019ll kill them and recover our belongings.\u201d\u201cThis is our turf; they\u2019ll never make it out alive. Kekekeke!\u201dThe bandits cackled excitedly.***\u201cWhy are you steering the carriage over to that side?\u201d Shaneth asked.\u201cThere\u2019s a trap over there,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied as he skillfully drove the carriage.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The hot, dry air that entered the carriage through the window pricked their skin.\u201cThis is completely different from all the other cities we\u2019ve been to,\u201d Shaneth said.The city was filled with strategically placed stone structures, and the stone pavement was littered with grains of sand. Raviesk was not an affluent city, and the people were quite hostile and hardy because of their economic situation.\u201cYeah, I agree\u2026 in a bad way,\u201d Henrick added.They sold most of the items they had looted from the bandits at the exchange center and kept the useful ones for themselves. The receptionist at the exchange center was shocked by the mountain of items they brought, and could not stop asking how they got their hands on it while taking out a bag of gold.\u201cLet\u2019s take our belongings and dispose of the carriage,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.They could not use the carriage in the desert, but they were faced with a challenge right away. Iris refused to part with the horse, and she tightly hugged the horse\u2019s neck with tears welling up in her eyes.\u201cDo we really have to leave Snow White behind?\u201d Iris asked tearfully.\u201cSnow White? You named the horse?\u201d Henrick exclaimed.Iris nodded seriously and replied, \u201cJust as Kang Yoon-Soo gave me a name, I named it as well. A name is a very important thing.\u201d The white horse neighed, as if it wanted to show that it agreed with what Iris was saying.Kang Yoon-Soo stared at Iris for a while before saying, \u201cLet\u2019s keep the carriage at a nearby inn and come collect it later.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m really thankful,\u201d Iris said, smiling brightly.Henrick narrowed his eyes and stared at Kang Yoon-Soo, saying, \u201cYou\u2026 You seem to have become very benevolent these days. What are you up to\u2026?\u201dKang Yoon-Soo suddenly added, \u201cNo matter how precious it is, you can\u2019t stay with it forever.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s always been like this. But you always sound as if you\u2019ve experienced everything,\u201d Shaneth remarked in surprise.Kang Yoon-Soo stared at Shaneth\u2019s eyes for quite a while before looking away.***The party approached the largest treasure hunter clan in the city. The place was packed with sandy treasure hunters who were either drinking or maintaining their equipment.A middle-aged man at the counter asked, \u201cWhat business do you have here?\u201d\u201cWe want to go to the Desert of Death,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.\u201cThere are many easier ways to get yourself killed, but why are you guys taking the difficult road?\u201d the middle-aged man asked.He took out an assortment of old, worn-out equipment from a drawer. The equipment consisted of windbreakers, sand shovels, leather pouches, water canteens, maps, compasses, and makeshift tents. He asked in a businesslike voice, \u201cIs this your first time in the desert?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.\u201cThat\u2019s good. There are many people who rush into the desert hoping to get rich quickly, but end up as dried skeletons. Please don\u2019t be greedy, and turn back if you feel it\u2019s hopeless. Don\u2019t throw away your precious lives,\u201d the middle-aged man cautioned them.Shaneth looked around at the other treasure hunters and asked, \u201cThere seem to be a lot of people going into the Desert of Death at this time of year, no?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s because they\u2019re fools who will go to the ends of the world,\u201d the middle-aged man replied.\u201cAre there a lot of treasures in the desert?\u201d Shaneth asked.\u201cThey\u2019re after the remnants of a ruined civilization. There are quite a few of them who talk about finding the golden mask of an ancient king or the rare blade of an ancient knight captain, but half of the stories are just hot-air. I suggest that you diligently do whatever you\u2019re doing now instead of chasing after a pot of gold in the desert,\u201d the middle-aged man replied.Kang Yoon-Soo paid the fee for the equipment and exited. He went to a camel merchant and bought four camels, and the party stored their luggage between the camels\u2019 humps. He said, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dTheir adventure in the desert had finally started.***Fifty Fire Trolls were gathered around. Fire Trolls naturally had the fire attribute, unlike normal trolls, and could thus attack with fire. The air sizzled around them as they gathered together.The leader of each Fire Troll tribe had gathered together to discuss a highly important issue.The Fire Troll High Priest loudly declared, \u201cOur goddess requires a groom!\u201d\u201cWho will be the goddess\u2019 groom?!\u201d a Fire Troll asked.\u201cOur goddess Sylphia appeared in my dreams last night! She told me to bring her a man who will accept her proposal! That\u2019s why we need to find a groom for the goddess!\u201d the Fire Troll High Priest replied.The Fire Trolls murmured among themselves in surprise. The goddess of the continent, Sylphia, was revered even by trolls.A Fire Troll yelled, \u201cThen I\u2019ll be the goddess\u2019 groom!\u201d\u201cShut up! What nonsense are you spewing?!\u201d The Fire Troll High Priest smacked the troll who had spoken up in the head and rebuked him.The Fire Troll who had been smacked in the head balled his hand into a fist and tried to argue against the Fire Troll High Priest, but the other Fire Trolls stopped him.\u201cThe groom of the goddess will be given the right to pull out the Sword of Revelation!\u201d the Fire Troll High Priest explained, pointing at a white sword. The sword was half-buried under the sand and only had its hilt and a portion of its blade visibly sticking out, but anyone could tell that it was no ordinary weapon.\u201cThen I\u2019ll pull that sword out!\u201d the Fire Troll shouted.\u201cYou fool!\u201d The Fire Troll High Priest rebuked and smacked the Fire Troll once more.It was the same Fire Troll who had been smacked previously. He grimaced and grabbed his club as he tried to retaliate against the Fire Troll High Priest, but the other Fire Trolls around him stopped him from doing any other stupid things.\u201cOne must pass the Trials of Fire to pull the sword out!\u201d the Fire Troll High Priest explained.\u201cWe\u2019re strong against fire! We regenerate quickly too!\u201d a Fire Troll shouted.\u201cYanak is right! Something like the Trials of Fire will be nothing to us Fire Trolls!\u201d another Fire Troll shouted.The Fire Troll High Priest smacked a Fire Troll in the head. It was the same Fire Troll who had just been smacked twice. The Fire Troll Yanak, who had now been smacked thrice by the Fire Troll High Priest, screamed in frustration. However, the Fire Troll High Priest did not even pretend to hear Yanak\u2019s frustrated screams.\u201cOne of us can\u2019t be the groom of the goddess!\u201d the Fire Troll High Priest exclaimed.\u201cWhy?! We serve the goddess Sylphia just like any other creature on the continent!\u201d one of the Fire Trolls shouted.The other Fire Trolls seemed to agree with the words their comrade had just spoken, but the Fire Troll High Priest did not pay heed to them and continued, \u201cOne of us cannot be the groom of the goddess even if they pass the Trials of Fire and pull the sword out, because we lack one important quality required to be the goddess\u2019 groom!\u201d\u201cWhy?!\u201d\u201cTell us the reason why!\u201dThe Fire Troll High Priest said in a defeated voice, \u201cThe goddess\u2019 groom\u2026 has to be handsome\u2026!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m very handsome! Then I should be the goddess\u2019 groom!\u201d a Fire Troll exclaimed.\u201cYou thick-faced bastard!\u201d the Fire Troll High Priest shouted in anger as he smacked the forehead of the troll who had just shouted those preposterous words. As expected, it was Yanak.\u201cWhy am I the only one getting hit?!\u201d Yanak exclaimed as tears welled up in his eyes. The other Fire Trolls patted Yanak\u2019s shoulder and tried to comfort him.\u201cThe beauty standards of the goddess are very different from ours! That\u2019s why one of us can\u2019t be the goddess\u2019 groom!\u201d the Fire Troll High Priest explained.\u201cThis is racism!\u201d a Fire Troll shouted.\u201cThat\u2019s right! Why can\u2019t a troll be the groom of the goddess?!\u201d another Fire Troll complained.The Fire Trolls started to complain furiously. That forced the Fire Troll High Priest to shout out loud, \u201cTrolls aren\u2019t the goddess\u2019 type!\u201dThe Fire Trolls were shocked by the Fire Troll High Priest\u2019s words.\u201cThere\u2019s none among us whom the goddess would favor as her groom! That\u2019s why we have to kidnap one! We have to kidnap someone who will become the goddess\u2019 husband!\u201d the Fire Troll High Priest added.The Fire Trolls murmured among themselves upon hearing the words of their leader. One of the Fire Trolls suddenly spoke up and exclaimed, \u201cKidnap?! That\u2019s a cowardly and evil thing to do!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right! You\u2019d be disqualified as a troll even before you were tried as a warrior!\u201d\u201cSilence! This is why one of us can\u2019t be the goddess\u2019 groom!\u201d the Fire Troll High Priest shouted, gritting his fangs and adding, \u201cTell me, what\u2019s the vilest thing you did this week? I\u2019ll give the opportunity to become the goddess\u2019 groom to the troll who did the vilest thing today!\u201dThe Fire Trolls were dumbfounded by the words suddenly spoken by the Fire Troll High Priest, but they soon shouted one by one as soon as they realized that an opportunity had presented itself.\u201cI found a lost child while I was walking in the desert! The child fainted after seeing my face and I took the child to a nearby human village! Kuhahaha! That village will now suffer from taking care of that non-productive human parasite wasting their food and shelter!\u201d\u201cNo! I\u2019m the worst! I dug a branch into the only stream in the desert so it would flow to a nearby human settlement! Now nobody can monopolize that water!\u201dThe Fire Trolls started to boast about their evil deeds. Suddenly, Yanak spoke up and proudly boasted, \u201cI stepped on an innocent scorpion that crossed my path!\u201d\u201cOOOH!\u201d The other Fire Trolls clapped upon hearing Yanak\u2019s evil deed.Yanak scratched his head as if to show that he was embarrassed by the sudden applause and added, \u201cTo be honest, it was unintentional! I just stepped on it by pure coincidence while I was walking!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be ashamed of yourself! You\u2019re evil! You\u2019re fully qualified to become the groom of the goddess!\u201d a Fire Troll said as he wrapped his arm around Yanak\u2019s shoulders.The Fire Troll High Priest sighed and said, \u201cYou trolls are too simple! The goddess doesn\u2019t desire such simpletons! The goddess\u2019 groom has to understand what\u2019s going on in the world!\u201d\u201cThen is the goddess\u2019 groom handsome and evil?!\u201dThe Fire Trolls started to murmur among themselves.\u201cWhy are all women like this? They only want the bad and handsome men!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right! To hell with looks or whatnot! Kind men are the best!\u201dAn out-of-place debate about what women should look for in men suddenly broke out.The Fire Troll High Priest could not help but frown at the stupidity happening in front of him and ordered, \u201cAnyway, go kidnap someone from wherever in the desert! Someone who\u2019ll be suitable to be the groom of the goddess!\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t we bring someone from the elves we usually get along with?\u201d\u201cNo! The elves spend their whole lives with only one mate! It\u2019s rude to request an elf to be the goddess\u2019 groom. We have to look for another race to kidnap!\u201dThe Fire Trolls murmured among themselves as they discussed who to kidnap, but of course, nothing great came out of their discussions.The Fire Troll High Priest was now furious at the trolls\u2019 stupidity. He roared, \u201cThe one who kidnaps the most suitable groom candidate for the goddess will become the tribe leader! So hurry up and bring them here!\u201d\u201cOOOOHH!\u201dThe recommendation of the Fire Troll High Priest was the fastest and easiest way to become a tribe leader. The normal way to become a tribe leader was to bring back the talon of an Eagle King, or the fang of a large ant that resided in the Ant Hell.The Fire Trolls spread out into the Desert of Death to find a suitable groom candidate for the goddess.***\u201cIt\u2019s hot,\u201d Henrick grumbled.\u201cYes, it is hot.\u201d Iris agreed as they both struggled in the desert heat.The blazing sun high up above the desert was almost murderous. They were able to block the sunlight by wearing the thin windbreakers they had bought, but the heat of the sun penetrated through the windbreakers and deep into their skin.\u201cAren\u2019t you guys hot?\u201d Henrick asked as he looked at Shaneth and Kang Yoon-Soo. The two did not seem to be tired at all despite being under the hot desert sun.\u201cI\u2019m fine because I\u2019m drinking alcohol,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.\u201cI don\u2019t feel the heat after becoming an Ignus Warrior,\u201d Shaneth replied.Henrick grimaced when he heard their responses and said, \u201cThose two aren\u2019t humans.\u201dThere was no way to overcome the heat of the desert even though they were riding camels. The desert had mountains of sand piled next to each other; the Desert of Death lived up to its name, as no lifeforms of any sort could be found around them at all.\u201cSummon Acle,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo muttered, calling on the spirit of ice.Acle looked around his surroundings before angrily complaining, \u201cAre you crazy?! You dare to summon me in a hot desert like this?!\u201d\u201cWe need cold air,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.\u201cHmph! Why should I listen to you?\u201d Acle scoffed.\u201cFrozen Crown,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.The Frozen Crown was one of the treasures Kang Yoon-Soo had obtained from the Winterkill Ruin. It was a majestic crown that held an immense amount of cold power, and Acle was obsessed with the treasure.\u201cChe! You cheater,\u201d Acle complained.Henrick frowned as he wiped the sweat off his cheek, saying, \u201cEnough of that. Hey, you spirit of ice thing. Why don\u2019t you live up to your name and make some cold ice?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t make ice here; there\u2019s not enough moisture in the air,\u201d Acle replied.\u201cSince when does magic nitpick about such realistic things?\u201d Henrick complained.\u201cHmph! What a loudmouth for a human who can\u2019t even summon shaved ice! There are limitations to the powers of us spirits, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s difficult for me to use my powers in the desert,\u201d Acle haughtily explained.\u201cWow, how useless can you be? What\u2019s the use of an ice maker if it can\u2019t make ice when it\u2019s hot?\u201d Henrick complained once again.\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Acle glared at Henrick, who was openly mocking him.It was at that moment that Iris suddenly charged like a beast who had seen prey to hunt down, and tightly hugged Acle.\u201cAck! Get off me this instant! You stupid wench!\u201d Acle shouted as he struggled to break free from Iris\u2019 grip, but the doppelganger was just too strong for the ice spirit to break free.Iris rubbed her face on Acle\u2019s cheek and looked very happy while doing so. She said, \u201cAcle is really cool.\u201d\u201c\u2026this must be the first time in the history of the continent that an ice spirit has been used as an ice bag,\u201d Shaneth said as she stared at the strange sight unfolding in front of her eyes.Kang Yoon-Soo ignored his noisy companions and looked far into the distant desert, thinking, \u2018I should find myself a sword first.\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 73": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Record of a Thousand LivesChapter 74Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe day ended and night came to the vast desert. The desert was unexpectedly cold at night. As such, the party tied up their camels and lit a fire to make camp.\u2018I should probably continue the legendary quest as well,\u2019 Kang Yoon-Soo thought.He checked the details of the legendary quest on his wrist device. The details of the legendary quest had changed slightly as he had progressed further.[Legendary Quest\u2014Desert Temple][The southwestern part of the continent housed a great forest and an ancient civilization, but sandy, desolate deserts are all that remain of the once-thriving civilization.][It is said that a great temple can be found in the middle of the vast desert, which the ancient civilization once used as their place of worship.][Collect the clues spread across the Desert of Death and find the hidden great temple.]*The great temple can only be found on days when the mirage subsides.Rewards: Meeting with the next quest giver\u201cA temple in the desert\u2026 Why are you trying to go there?\u201d Henrick grumbled.Shaneth was deep in thought for a moment before asking, \u201cIf it\u2019s a temple, it must be where they worshiped Sylphia, the goddess of the continent, right?\u201dA religion existed on the Sylphia Continent, just like in the real world. However, while multiple other unofficial gods existed, the sole recognized religion on the continent belonged to the goddess who shared the continent\u2019s name, Sylphia. There were multiple temples and shrines spread across the continent that worshiped the goddess.\u201cHey! It\u2019s not hot anymore, so let me go!\u201d Acle complained.Iris pondered for a moment before letting go of Acle. Acle\u2019s face was red with anger as he grumbled and complained. Iris smiled as she looked at the little boy getting worked up and said, \u201cMake me feel good again next time, Acle.\u201d\u201cS-shut up!\u201d Acle retorted as he ran away to the summon dimension.Henrick laughed at the sight of the ice spirit running away and said, \u201cMaybe it\u2019s because he\u2019s an ice spirit, but he seems to get embarrassed really easily.\u201dHe carved a sand crystal with his sculpting knife as he looked into the distance and murmured, \u201cBut this is quite a predicament we\u2019re in\u2026 If we overturn every stone in this vast desert to find the temple, it\u2019ll take us at least half a year to find it.\u201d\u201cWe won\u2019t look for the temple,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.The party looked at Kang Yoon-Soo as if he had just said something very strange. Kang Yoon-Soo fiddled around with the dying campfire with a stick; firewood was quite hard to come by because they were in the desert.However, Kang Yoon-Soo easily pulled out an old tree root and threw it into the campfire as he said, \u201cSomeone will come to us first.\u201d***Morning came, and a voice whispered in Kang Yoon-Soo\u2018s ears as they were preparing to depart once again.\u2018Come to me; come find me; come do my bidding,\u2019 the voice whispered.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you reveal who you are first?\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.\u201cHuh? Did you say something?\u201d Shaneth asked.\u201cNothing. Don\u2019t mind it,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.The party continued their journey across the desert. Henrick and Iris seemed to have acclimated to the heat, as they no longer lagged behind the rest.Suddenly, Shaneth shouted from atop her camel, \u201cThere\u2019s a corpse there!\u201dA set of pale white bones was lying atop a sand dune. The party found a white skull after digging through the sand for a bit.Henrick grimaced at the sight, wondering, \u201cIs it someone who was trekking across the desert like us? This is giving me anxiety for no reason.\u201d\u201cMaybe it\u2019s because it\u2019s the desert, but there seem to be quite a few of these bones around,\u201d Shaneth commented.The two gulped as they felt a strange, eerie feeling creep up on them. Henrick suddenly spoke up as he scrunched his eyebrows. \u201cThese skulls seem to be quite large.\u201dThe skulls that peeked out of the sand seemed to have rather large eye sockets.\u201cIs it the skull of an ogre, or maybe a troll?\u201d Shaneth said.Henrick cleared away the area around the skull using one of the sand shovels the party had purchased, and they realized that the skull was much larger than they had anticipated. The bones buried beneath the skull had dried scales attached to them as well.Shaneth looked at the bones and scales, trying to jog her memories. She suddenly said, \u201cThese bones seem familiar\u2026\u201dShe suddenly realized what the bones belonged to and exclaimed, \u201cThe Spartoi! These bones resemble the Spartoi that appeared from the Orb of the Covenant! The skeletal structure seems to be similar too!\u201d\u201cSpartoi? You mean the ones a dragon orders around?\u201d Henrick asked with a grimace.Iris looked quite nervous as she asked, \u201cIs there a dragon in the desert?\u201dDragons were known as forces that could shake up the entire continent whenever they wanted. They usually never left their lairs, but it was certain that a dragon could wreak havoc and destroy a part of the continent if its rage were stirred up. A dragon was a frightening creature, feared by all races and monsters.\u201cIt\u2019s alright. They say dragons are such rare creatures to see that even elves don\u2019t get the chance to see them even once in their long lifespan, so I don\u2019t think we would ever meet one,\u201d Shaneth said.\u201cWe will,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo suddenly said.\u201cWhat?\u201d Shaneth exclaimed.Kang Yoon-Soo nonchalantly answered, \u201cWe\u2019ll fight the dragon Ignus here in the Desert of Death.\u201dThe party\u2019s faces turned ghastly pale at his words. What kind of a madman would pick a fight with a dragon, a creature that could blow away a whole kingdom in an instant?Shaneth asked with a trembling voice, \u201cY-you\u2019re joking\u2026 Right?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.\u201c\u2026Why do I feel as if this journey is growing more dangerous by the day?\u201d Henrick complained.Kang Yoon-Soo rubbed the Spartoi\u2019s bones. They were already so weathered that they started to crumble and chip just from being rubbed gently.\u2018It seems meaningless to even raise these as undead. There\u2019s no value in having the Lich research them either.\u2019Liches had the ability to research and study the remains of creatures to gain experience points, but there was no value in the Lich studying such old and weathered remains.Kang Yoon-Soo collected the scales from the Spartoi\u2019s bones. The slightly reddish scales seemed to be rather sturdy crafting materials.[Scales of the Spartoi]They have maintained their durability even though a long time has passed since their owner died. They are not suitable to be used for clothing, and are more widely used as material for shields or decorations. However, using equipment made out of this material will make dragons hostile toward the user.Kang Yoon-Soo stored the scales in his backpack and mounted his camel. He looked back at the three people and asked, \u201cWhat are you standing around for?\u201d\u201cKang Yoon-Soo, do we really have to fight a dragon?\u201d Iris asked, her voice shaking nervously. A creature as mighty and frightening as a dragon was the embodiment of fear itself for a doppelganger like Iris.Kang Yoon-Soo nonchalantly replied with one word, \u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWhat if one of us dies?\u201d Iris asked.\u201cNo one will die,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo confidently replied. He continued, \u201cAs long as I\u2019m alive, none of you will die.\u201d***Yanak was facing a huge predicament as the two Fire Trolls that followed him complained, \u201cWe\u2019re hungry!\u201dStarvation in a place like the desert was a dangerous thing. The Fire Trolls had lived all their lives in the hot desert and were used to being thirsty, but they weren\u2019t creatures who could withstand hunger at all.\u201cYanak! Feed us!\u201d a Fire Troll named Ralkwira complained, throwing a tantrum.Yanak was climbing up a sand dune when he stopped halfway and turned around at Ralkwira, replying, \u201cI\u2019m hungry too!\u201d\u201cThen let\u2019s stop and eat!\u201d Ralkwira protested.\u201cBut we don\u2019t have any food!\u201d Yanak replied.\u201cThen we should look for prey to hunt!\u201d Ralkwira suggested.Yanak could easily agree with Ralkwira\u2019s suggestion, but he felt that it would not be leader-like for him to instantly agree with the words of his subordinate. As such, he reacted negatively to the suggestion and said, \u201cWe have to look for a groom for the goddess first! Someone else might beat us to it if we dilly-dally and get sidetracked!\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll starve to death before that!\u201d Ralkwira retorted.\u201cRalkwira is right! We have to eat first!\u201d Another Fire Troll named Orkwi complained as well, rubbing his belly.Yanak finally seemed satisfied and replied, \u201cAlright! We\u2019ll fill our stomachs first! Let\u2019s hunt!\u201d\u201cYanak! There\u2019s no need for us to look far!\u201d Ralkwira exclaimed, pointing across the dunes.Four humans were crossing the desert on camels in the distance. Yanak gulped hungrily and exclaimed, \u201cCamel meat!\u201dRalkwira and Orkwi salivated and roared.\u201cI want to rip that camel\u2019s hump off its back and chew on it!\u201d\u201cI want to feast on that camel\u2019s delicious fat!\u201dHowever, Yanak hesitated for a moment and added, \u201cBut those camels have owners!\u201d\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t take something that is owned by someone else!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right! The goddess will punish us!\u201dThe three Fire Trolls put their heads together and struggled to come up with a solution. They wanted to eat camel meat, but they couldn\u2019t simply steal someone else\u2019s possession.Then, Ralkwira came up with an excellent solution. \u201cLet\u2019s ask them to barter for the camel meat! There\u2019s nothing wrong with bartering!\u201d\u201cBut we don\u2019t have anything worth bartering for camel meat!\u201d Yanak objected as a leader should do\u2014at least, according to his philosophy.Then, Orkwi slowly raised his club and called out, \u201cYanak! This is when the leader has to take one for the team!\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?!\u201d Yanak asked, slowly backing away.However, Ralkwira caught him and exclaimed, \u201cYanak! Prove your right as our leader!\u201d\u201cN-no! I-I don\u2019t want to!\u201d Yanak screamed as he ran away.\u201cGet him!\u201d***The party was facing a strange predicament. There were three large Fire Trolls with serious expressions blocking their way.\u201cAre they trying to pick a fight?\u201d Shaneth asked as she grabbed her scythe.However, the largest Fire Troll stepped up to speak. That Fire Troll seemed to have a few odd-looking bumps on his head. He called out, \u201cI\u2019m Yanak! I have a proposal for you!\u201d\u201cWhat proposal?\u201d Henrick asked.\u201cExchange me for your camel meat!\u201d Yanak offered.\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Henrick replied confusedly.Yanak said in a loud, confident voice, \u201cI\u2019ll gladly become your companion if you hand over those four camels!\u201dKang Yoon-Soo curtly replied, \u201cNo.\u201d\u201cHow could this be?!\u201d the three Fire Trolls exclaimed, as they had never thought their offer would be rejected.\u201cYanak! What disaster is this?!\u201d\u201cThis is shocking! To think I\u2019m worth less than four camels!\u201d Yanak cried out. It seemed he was quite taken aback by his valuation.Henrick waved his hand in annoyance and said, \u201cTsk. I guess you meet all sorts of strange fellas if you live long enough. Move along if you\u2019ve finished your business with us.\u201d\u201cWait!\u201d Yanak exclaimed, wiping his tears away. He pointed at Henrick and Kang Yoon-Soo before saying, \u201cNow that I think about it, you two are men!\u201d\u201cOne of them could become the goddess\u2019 groom, but the goddess\u2019 groom has to be handsome!\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t tell which one is the handsome one!\u201dThe three Fire Trolls murmured among themselves.Soon enough, Yanak said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what standards humans have! Who\u2019s more handsome between you two?!\u201dHenrick was taken aback for a moment before he answered hesitantly, \u201cWell\u2026 Both of us are handsome?\u201d\u201cAlright! We\u2019ll kidnap you!\u201d Yanak exclaimed.\u201cWhat?\u201d Henrick was flustered by the Fire Troll\u2019s words.The three Fire Trolls lifted up their clubs and approached the two men, calling out, \u201cChange of plans! You two men have to be kidnapped by us!\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Shaneth asked as she stood in front of Kang Yoon-Soo.However, Yanak slammed his club down on the ground and roared, \u201cWe don\u2019t need females!\u201dKwachik!A wave of sand flew around Shaneth, but she did not even move a step in the face of the sudden threat by the Fire Troll. In truth, the Fire Troll was more surprised than she was.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He looked at the three Fire Trolls and said, \u201cGuide us to the great temple, and I\u2019ll free you.\u201d\u201cWe can\u2019t!\u201d Yanak screamed.The great temple in the desert was a secret place only the Fire Trolls knew. It was utterly unimaginable for them to bring another race to that place.The Fire Trolls struggled to cut the rope binding them, but the rope made from an unknown material did not budge at all. They protested, \u201cWe\u2019ll never guide you! We\u2019ll never give in no matter what kind of torture you put us through!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll starve you,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said nonchalantly.\u201cKaaaaaaaaah!\u201d the Fire Trolls screamed and looked at Kang Yoon-Soo with eyes that said \u2018how can you be so cruel?\u2019Kang Yoon-Soo was unfazed as he turned around and told his companions, \u201cLet\u2019s have lunch.\u201d\u201cHow cruel!\u201d the trolls exclaimed.Shaneth immediately took out ingredients from her backpack and started to cook soup. The savory smell enticed the Fire Trolls\u2019 empty and hungry stomachs.Yanak could not hold on and ended up giving in, roaring, \u201cFree us! We\u2019ll guide you to the great temple!\u201dKang Yoon-Soo freed the three exhausted-looking Fire Trolls, then asked them, \u201cAre you hungry?\u201d\u201cYes, we are!\u201d the Fire Trolls replied.\u201cI\u2019ll cook, but you have to help me hunt in return,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.\u201cReally?!\u201d the three Fire Trolls exclaimed, jumping with joy.Shaneth was deeply surprised and asked, \u201cDid you just say you would cook? Why are you cooking all of a sudden?\u201dKang Yoon-Soo had not cooked a single bowl of soup in the time they had journeyed together until now.Kang Yoon-Soo glanced at Iris and said, \u201cBecause I made a promise.\u201d\u201cKang Yoon-Soo is a really good person,\u201d Iris said, smiling brightly.Shaneth, on the other hand, glared at the two with eyes full of jealousy.Even though Kang Yoon-Soo had volunteered to cook, there were not enough rations for him to use to cook for the three Fire Trolls. He thus said, \u201cLet\u2019s hunt for scorpions.\u201d\u201cScorpions? Will that even satiate them? I think you\u2019d have to catch a thousand of those just to fill that one guy\u2019s stomach,\u201d Henrick said as he slurped the freshly cooked soup.Kang Yoon-Soo shook his head and replied, \u201cOne will be more than enough.\u201d***The Giant Scorpions in the desert had venom in their tails, and they were absurdly fast when running across the sand. They would kick up dust when they ran, and sand would fly all over the place. They were large monsters that were roughly around Level 230.Kang Yoon-Soo looked at the pack of Giant Scorpions from atop a sand dune and thought, \u2018I\u2019m Level 177 right now.\u2019His level was absurdly low. Forget about being the strongest on the continent, he would not even qualify for the mid-tier on the continent. A hardworking and talented Continental would easily surpass Level 300, and the most powerful boss monsters exceeded Level 500.Kang Yoon-Soo could not afford to slow down his leveling, but he also could not afford to solely focus on increasing his level and abandon collecting skills and items.\u2018I shouldn\u2019t just increase my level. I have to balance it out altogether,\u2019 he thought.The time it would take from his regression until the appearance of the Demon Lord was exactly twenty years, and ninety days had passed since his regression. He had to be the best of the best and excel in everything, especially in terms of combat.\u2018I have to be the best in everything, since this will be my last life.\u2019Kang Yoon-Soo took out some items from his backpack. They were the best items he had received from the band of bandits on his way to Raviesk.[Earth Staff]Rating: RareMana Increase: 55A staff imbued with the blessings of the earth. It allows the user to cast three kinds of spells. The staff\u2019s power will increase when used in swamps, deserts, or muddy fields. However, the user will not be able to use the staff when it is raining.[Ring of Vitality Absorption]Rating: RareVitality Absorption: 47A ring made by extracting the bodily fluids of a vampire. It will let the user absorb the vitality of the enemy whenever the user attacks, but the ring will devour the user if their life force drops very low.Kang Yoon-Soo equipped the items and climbed up the sand dunes, then cast a spell with the Earth Staff. \u201cSand Wave.\u201dThe Earth Staff was not a piece of equipment with very good stats, and its spells normally only affected a small area. However, it would be a different story if the staff were used in a desert.Brrrr\u2026 Rumble\u2026!The sand dunes started to tremble and shake, and one of the Giant Scorpions was isolated away from its pack.The three Fire Trolls raised their clubs and charged at the isolated prey, crying, \u201cDie!\u201dThe Fire Trolls\u2019 way of thinking was very simple. It was fine to kill to eat, but it was bad to kill when they were full\u2014because the latter was a meaningless slaughter. Freed from the morality that bound them normally, the Fire Trolls\u2019 combat prowess was quite fierce and frightening.Crack! Crack!The sound of the scorpion\u2019s shell cracking and breaking rang out whenever the Fire Trolls slammed their clubs down on their prey; it was a show of overwhelming strength. The Giant Scorpion immediately retaliated by stabbing the Fire Trolls with its venomous tail, but the Fire Trolls did not bother avoiding it at all.\u201cWhat\u2019s this? A mosquito bite?! It doesn\u2019t hurt at all!\u201dThe three Fire Trolls\u2019 skin started to turn red and heat up. It was the unique trait of the Fire Troll race: Their skin could heat up and harden like steel plate, allowing them to ignore a great deal of incoming damage.\u201cGrooowk!\u201d the Giant Scorpion cried out as it tried to run away.However, Shaneth was already blocking the Giant Scorpion\u2019s path of retreat, swinging her scythe and using a skill. \u201cFire Strike!\u201dThe dark scythe\u2019s sharp blade ripped through the Giant Scorpion\u2019s joint. The Giant Scorpion\u2019s speed suddenly dropped by more than half because of the Death Scythe\u2019s special trait of casting one of seven curses at random.\u201cThread Tying,\u201d Henrick muttered. He stretched his mana threads out and tied down the Giant Scorpion\u2019s tail. The Giant Scorpion was no longer a threat as soon as its tail, which housed its venom, was tied down.Iris charged at the Giant Scorpion and slammed her fist down.Kwachik!The Giant Scorpion\u2019s shell cracked and broke into pieces.Kang Yoon-Soo swung his staff and dealt the final blow, calling out, \u201cSummon Sharp Stone Fragments.\u201dFragments of sandstone buried deep under the desert sand suddenly shot out of the ground. They rained down upon the Giant Scorpion, piercing through it until it died.The group hunted a total of seventeen Giant Scorpions under Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s command.\u201cWe won!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s eat till we drop today!\u201dThe Fire Trolls danced joyfully at their victory.Meanwhile, Kang Yoon-Soo set aside two female Giant Scorpions to use as ingredients and collected their flesh. He then looked at the remaining Giant Scorpion corpses littered across the sandy ground. It would have been perfect to raise them as undead, but the level difference was just too high for him to raise them.\u2018I guess the skill level of Mass Raise Dead is still lacking.\u2019Kang Yoon-Soo would one day be able to raise even the corpses of immensely strong monsters if his skill level rose. In the meantime, he stretched out his right hand and muttered, \u201cSummon Mini-Lich.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s up, master?\u201d the Mini-Lich asked as it was summoned.Kang Yoon-Soo pointed at the corpses of the Giant Scorpions and said, \u201cResearch these corpses.\u201d\u201cThank you, master,\u201d the Mini-Lich replied.Liches were eager to learn and liked carrying out research. Researching the corpses would help improve the Mini-Lich\u2019s lacking intelligence.The Mini-Lich started to inspect the Giant Scorpion corpses lying around.[The Mini-Lich is researching the body structure of the Giant Scorpion.][Intellect has risen by 3.][The Mini-Lich has learned a bit regarding the meaning of death.][Black magic efficiency has risen by a little.]That was not all. The Mini-Lich curiously inspected the tail of a Giant Scorpion and squeezed out the venom within it.\u201cI want to learn more about acid-type magic that can melt anything. I still lack knowledge. I might be able to learn new magic if I study more corpses that have venom in them,\u201d the Mini-Lich said.The Mini-Lich could even learn new magic by itself. A Lich was a summon that could learn and grow on its own, unlike the spirits and the werewolf.\u2018I should give it opportunities to study more corpses from now on. It could learn new skills, after all,\u2019 Kang Yoon-Soo thought.The Mini-Lich was from an intelligent race and had the endless potential to grow stronger. Additionally, the Mini-Lich suited Kang Yoon-Soo, who had mastered Necromancy in his previous life, quite well.Kang Yoon-Soo stared at the Giant Scorpions he had set aside as ingredients and thought, \u2018I don\u2019t want to.\u2019He innately hated cooking. He wasn\u2019t a picky eater, and most of what he consumed was strong alcohol, so he never felt the need to cook delicious food.Shaneth rolled up her sleeves and stood beside Kang Yoon-Soo, asking, \u201cWhat should I help you with?\u201d\u201cNothing,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied. He had promised Iris that he would cook for her, so he had to keep his promise whether he liked it or not\u2014this was his final life, after all.\u2018First, separate the edible parts.\u2019Kang Yoon-Soo used the dagger he had stolen from the band of bandits and skillfully butchered the Giant Scorpion. He pulled out the Giant Scorpion\u2019s soft flesh after breaking its shell.\u2018Next, season it.\u2019He seasoned the meat with various spices they had bought from the marketplace. There was so much meat that he had to place it all atop a rock and season it there.\u2018It will take a while to thoroughly cook all of this.\u2019He then took out a frying pan. There was also the option of cooking on a rock by using the heat from the sun, but it would be difficult to thoroughly cook all the meat through.He suddenly had a bright idea and muttered, \u201cSummon Sally.\u201d\u201cWow! Where is this?\u201d Sally exclaimed excitedly as she smiled and welcomed the desert heat. She clung to Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s leg and cried, \u201cPapa! Papa! I like it here! It\u2019s hot; I like it!\u201d\u201cSally,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo began.\u201cYeah! Who should I beat up?!\u201d Sally replied.Kang Yoon-Soo placed the frying pan on top of Sally\u2019s head and said, \u201cLight it up.\u201d\u201cWaaaah! Mama! Papa is teasing me!\u201d Sally cried out, clinging to Shaneth.Shaneth patted Sally\u2019s head and let out a sigh, remarking, \u201cWe might be the first on this continent to use a spirit\u2019s fire as a cooking stove\u2026\u201dIn the end, Sally had no choice but to tearfully become the stove that would cook the scorpion meat.At that moment, a large eagle flew down and sat atop the scorpion shells Kang Yoon-Soo had discarded. It was a Corpse Eagle, and it searched beneath the sand with its beak, looking for food. Kang Yoon-Soo quickly threw a dagger toward the eagle.\u201cKwek!\u201d The eagle struggled on the ground after getting hit with the thrown dagger. Kang Yoon-Soo nonchalantly walked toward the eagle and twisted its neck, plucking out its feathers and guts.Sizzle\u2026 Sizzle\u2026The scorpion meat was soon cooked, and the roasted eagle was also coming along nicely. A savory smell filled the air and made those who smelled it salivate.[You have made a spectacular dish despite the poor environment.][You have gained a new skill, \u2018Survival Cooking\u2019.][Survival Cooking]Skill Level: 1 (00.00%)A mandatory cooking skill to obtain ingredients in harsh environments. It will let you make a scrumptious meal even with the most disgusting ingredients.It was a useless skill, since Kang Yoon-Soo was not interested in cooking in the first place.Yanak asked impatiently, \u201cWhen can we eat it?\u201d\u201cYou can eat now,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.The Fire Trolls wolfed down the meal. Henrick, Shaneth, and Iris all sat down as well and ate their meals.Henrick raised a brow and remarked, \u201cIt\u2019s my first time eating scorpion meat, but this is better than I expected\u2026?\u201dKang Yoon-Soo had skillfully masked the stench coming from the scorpion meat with the spices and seasonings. It was not a complicated dish; rather, it was a simple roast dish that brought out the natural flavors of the ingredient. It was not on the level of making the eater see visions, but it was a tasty meal nonetheless.\u201cIt\u2019s really good,\u201d Iris said with a satisfied smile.However, Kang Yoon-Soo just sipped his alcohol and watched the others eat his dish.\u201cAren\u2019t you eating?\u201d Shaneth asked.\u201cI don\u2019t feel like it,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.They focused on eating for quite a while, and Sally walked toward the Mini-Lich, who was studying the corpses given to it. She called out, \u201cHey, Lich! Lich! Let\u2019s play hide and seek!\u201d\u201cAlright,\u201d the Mini-Lich replied, leaving behind the research it was doing. The kind Mini-Lich got along well with Sally.\u201cWow! I\u2019m so happy! Lich is the first one to play with Sally!\u201d Sally exclaimed before hugging and kissing the Mini-Lich out of pure joy and excitement. She added, \u201cI wish Acle were as kind as you, but he\u2019s just too stubborn.\u201dThe Mini-Lich slowly shook its head and said, \u201cSally, that\u2019s not true. Acle is really kind.\u201dSally puffed up her cheeks and pouted, exclaiming, \u201cLiar! Acle hates Sally. He won\u2019t even call me noona!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s because Acle is shy. Sally can get as close to Acle as you want. You are siblings, after all,\u201d the Mini-Lich said.\u201c\u2026really? Does Lich think we\u2019re siblings?\u201d Sally asked.\u201cOf course,\u201d the Mini-Lich replied.The two summons unexpectedly got along pretty well.Yanak, who was quite full and satisfied from the scorpion meat, stood up and said, \u201cKang Yoon-Soo! You fed us! You\u2019re now our friend! I\u2019ll guide you to the great temple!\u201dA friendship had been formed after one meal. There were numerous cases of friendships being formed with trolls over nonsensical things, but they treated all their friendships with complete sincerity.\u2018Our next opponent controls time. I could end up dying as well if I\u2019m not careful.\u2019 Kang Yoon-Soo downed his bottle and thought, \u2018That\u2019s why I have to give this my all.\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 75": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Record of a Thousand LivesChapter 76Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cKatz! I finally found it!\u201d Hudderson shouted.Katz stopped digging and ran toward Hudderson, asking, \u201cAre you sure?\u201d\u201cMy search skill just showed a reaction here. Damn it, that took a while,\u201d Hudderson said as he carefully hammered a stone wall.The old stone wall broke down, and they found a treasure hidden in it\u2014a large coffin.Katz gulped dryly and asked, \u201cWhose corpse do you think is in it?\u201d\u201cIt must be an ancient noble, at least,\u201d Hudderson replied.\u201cHow can you tell?\u201d Katz asked.\u201cLook at the drawings on the coffin; they\u2019re very fancy and luxurious,\u201d Hudderson said.The two graverobbers had come to this place two months before. They had stumbled upon it by accident after wandering around the desert and falling into a ditch, then down into a large hall. The passageway was quite weathered, and it seemed the two graverobbers had fallen when a portion of it caved in.\u201cRight in front of us is the fruit of all our labor,\u201d Hudderson said.The two graverobbers had secured an exit and searched the area. It seemed to be a burial site. The stone walls were inscribed with foreign inscriptions and numerous ornate murals. The place gave off the stench of hidden treasure just from the looks of it; unbelievably, they had found a pile of rare gems after searching for only a day.\u201cHow much would this be worth in yen if we brought it back to reality?\u201d Katz had asked.\u201cI don\u2019t know the exchange rate, but it would definitely be worth at least thousands of dollars,\u201d Hudderson had replied.The two graverobbers had not ventured further inside and instead left with the gems they found. There was an old saying that letting greed get the better of you in an old burial site would bring nothing but danger. However, they had been caught by a corrupt inspector, who confiscated all of their hard-earned gems.\u201cIn exchange, I will overlook all of the crimes you have committed until now. How does that sound?\u201d the corrupt inspector had asked.Katz and Hudderson had felt as if they were going to go crazy from the injustice they suffered, and the two graverobbers thus decided to visit the Desert of Death once again.It had been much harder the second time, and it had taken them a long time to find the burial site once again. This time, they had made up their minds to find the most valuable treasure in the burial site because of the time they had spent. It was actually funny to think about the fact that last time they had given up halfway because of some folktale passed down by word of mouth.\u201cAre you telling me this coffin is the most valuable treasure in this place?\u201d Katz asked.\u201cLet\u2019s open this first and take a look. There are usually valuables and treasures together with the corpse in these coffins,\u201d Hudderson said.They both grabbed the coffin lid and pulled on it with all their strength, but the lid would not budge an inch. There were no locks or anything of the sort keeping it tightly shut, but the coffin lid was heavy like a block of lead.\u201cPhew! What\u2019s going on?\u201d Katz asked.\u201cHow can we open this?\u201d Hudderson exclaimed as he shook his head.Then, a large warning message flashed on their wrist devices.[The ancient king, Kartheon, has awakened from his slumber.]That was the only message that appeared, but they were engulfed by a sudden wave of inexplicable anxiety.\u201cSomething\u2019s wrong\u2026\u201d Hudderson muttered.Suddenly, the lid swung open and a hand shot out from the coffin, grabbing Hudderson\u2019s arm.\u201cA-ack!\u201d Hudderson could not even finish screaming, as his body suddenly withered away and turned to dust.Katz was shocked. He pulled out his sword and screamed, \u201cW-what?! Hudderson!\u201dThe coffin lid slowly slid open, and a dried, withered corpse slowly stood up from it. It had no hair, and its eyes, ears, and lips were severely damaged and looked almost nonexistent. However, the mummy was adorned with all sorts of fancy and luxurious trinkets, and there was an hourglass hanging on its neck.Katz forgot about running away, trembling on the spot.\u201cWhat year is it?\u201d the mummy asked with a voice akin to metal screeching against metal. Katz was so shocked that he just stood there trembling. The mummy waited for a moment before continuing, \u201cAnswer me if you don\u2019t want to lose your life like the fool a while ago.\u201d\u201cR-reorkan Empire Calendar Year 468, 15th day of the month of the Solar,\u201d Katz replied as he read out the date written on his wrist device.\u201cReorkan Empire Calendar?\u201d the mummy asked, scratching his chin with his long fingers and continuing, \u201cIs Reorkan the name of the ruler of the continent?\u201d\u201cY-yes,\u201d Katz replied.\u201cA long time has passed,\u201d the mummy said. He opened and closed his bony hands, as if he were still trying to get used to his body\u2019s motor functions. He continued, \u201cI see that the resurrection took a long time, and this body has stagnated as well.\u201dKatz mustered up his courage and asked, \u201cY-you\u2026 What are you?\u201d\u201cI respect your foolishness in staying and questioning me instead of running away; therefore, I will answer your question. I am the king of Sharshyanon, Kartheon De Rasil,\u201d the mummy replied.\u201cS-sharshyanon?\u201d Katz exclaimed, his eyes wide in shock.There was no way that a person like him who made a living by graverobbing would not know about Sharshyanon. It was a kingdom that had flourished in ancient times; all of the endless treasures and artifacts found in the Desert of Death were all remnants of the once-mighty Sharshyanon Kingdom.Had they really awakened the ancient king?\u201cI need to acquire knowledge of current affairs. I suppose there is value in keeping you alive,\u201d the mummy, no, Kartheon said.Kartheon walked outside, and Katz followed behind him. It was not that Katz was willingly following him; rather, Katz\u2019s body had moved on its own.\u201cHow much has the world changed? Do people still ride wolves and inscribe words on tablets?\u201d Kartheon asked.\u201cN-no, they don\u2019t ride wolves, but they do ride horses. Also, they no longer use tablets, and use paper and pens to write,\u201d Katz replied.\u201cSo the world has progressed quite a bit,\u201d Kartheon mused.Kartheon started to ask Katz various things about the continent, such as the continent\u2019s population, the politics of the empire, its military might, the value of money, climate, topography, and other such things. There were many things that Katz was not aware of and did not know the answer to, but he nevertheless replied immediately because he feared for his life. There were numerous words that must have been new and difficult to understand, but Kartheon simply nodded as if he understood everything.Katz squirmed for a moment and eventually said, \u201cActually, I\u2019m not from the continent. I\u2019m from another world.\u201d\u201cAnother world?\u201d Kartheon asked. Katz\u2019s words had suddenly piqued his interest.Katz pointed at the device on his wrist and said, \u201cThe people who are wearing this are people from another world. We lived in a different world before we were summoned here to the Sylphia Continent.\u201d\u201cFor what purpose?\u201d Kartheon asked.\u201cNo one knows,\u201d Katz answered.\u201cI think I have an idea why,\u201d Kartheon said. He laughed and added, \u201cWhat a pity. I don\u2019t think you guys will ever go back to your world.\u201dKatz could not understand what Kartheon was saying and just tilted his head in confusion. However, he gained some courage to ask a question after seeing that Kartheon had softened up to him a little bit. \u201cHow did you meet your demise, your majesty?\u201d he asked innocently. However, he soon regretted his newfound courage as he realized what he had just said.However, Kartheon simply replied without a fuss, \u201cI was assassinated by a man called Sirian, but I used temporal power and was resurrected.\u201d\u201cT-temporal power?\u201d Katz asked.\u201cI can control time,\u201d Kartheon said.Katz\u2019s jaw dropped in surprise. Kartheon laughed at the sight of Katz\u2019s mouth hanging agape and said, \u201cActually, I already killed you when I first met you. You took too long to answer; it was annoying.\u201d\u201cW-what?\u201d Katz stuttered.\u201cHowever, I decided that I needed information, so I turned back time by three seconds, and that is why you are still alive,\u201d Kartheon explained.Katz dryly gulped and asked, \u201cI-is something like that even possible\u2026?\u201d\u201cI gain temporal power whenever I kill a living organism or simply wait for it to replenish, and I can use it to turn back or stop time in this world,\u201d Kartheon explained.\u201cThat\u2019s amazing!\u201d Katz exclaimed.Kartheon walked toward a large, majestic door. It was the door that would not budge an inch no matter how much effort Katz and Hudderson exerted, but it simply opened by itself as soon as Kartheon placed his dry, withered hands on it.\u201cHowever, this is not enough. I need more temporal power,\u201d Kartheon remarked.There were numerous preserved mummies in the room beyond the large door. The mummies in the room greatly varied in size; some of them were the size of a normal human, but there were a few large ones, each almost the size of a house.Kartheon waved his hand and commanded, \u201cRise from your slumber, my soldiers. The time to reclaim my rightful place has come.\u201dThe bandage-wrapped mummies started to move; there seemed to be thousands of them in the room.A large mummy stabbed its greatsword into the ground and shouted, \u201cO, my king! What is your command for us, your servants that have awakened after a long time?\u201dThe ancient king, Kartheon, declared, \u201cRegression to the past! I will obtain strength by killing all living beings, and I shall regress to the past!\u201d***Kang Yoon-Soo scratched his ears as if an annoying sound were buzzing around him.\u201cIt\u2019s over there!\u201d Yanak announced.A large temple was visible through the scorching heat that made everything in front of the party seem hazy. They had arrived at the great temple after traveling with the three Fire Trolls for four days.\u201cHelp us enter the temple,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.\u201cHuh? You plan to enter the temple?!\u201d Yanak exclaimed. Kang Yoon-Soo merely nodded.A Fire Troll that was standing guard stopped them as they tried to enter the great temple. He barked, \u201cQuit messing around! No other races aside from the Fire Trolls are allowed to enter the great temple!\u201d\u201cThese are our friends!\u201d Yanak retorted.\u201cThe answer is still no!\u201d the Fire Troll guard countered.It was impossible. The Fire Troll guard did not seem to plan on letting them in.Yanak squirmed for a moment before telling a blatant lie. \u201cWe\u2019ve kidnapped these two males to be groom candidates for the goddess! That\u2019s why you have to let us in!\u201d\u201cWhat about the other two females?\u201d the Fire Troll guard asked.\u201cAh\u2026 they\u2019re their mates, so we couldn\u2019t leave them behind!\u201d Yanak responded.\u201cYou should have told me earlier!\u201d the Fire Troll guard said, giving way and allowing them to enter the great temple.Yanak smacked his own forehead after entering the great temple as if he were trying to rebuke and punish himself. He cried, \u201cI lied to a fellow Fire Troll! I\u2019m very bad!\u201dKang Yoon-Soo\u2019s wrist device rang as soon as he stepped into the great temple.[You have completed the \u2018Legendary Quest\u2014Desert Temple\u2019.][The next quest giver is inside the great temple.]The interior of the temple was vast and cool, and a group of around forty Fire Trolls appeared around the party.\u201cYanak\u2019s group has come!\u201d they said.\u201cYou\u2019re the last to arrive!\u201d some of them added.All of the Fire Trolls had kidnapped males to offer as a groom to the goddess so they would have a chance at becoming the tribal leader.Shaneth\u2019s eyes widened in surprise and she whispered, \u201cBut do you think they can become the goddess\u2019 groom\u2026?\u201d\u201cHow should I know? There\u2019s a saying that you\u2019d be better off eating a whole loaf of dry barley bread instead of trying to understand what\u2019s going on in a troll\u2019s head,\u201d Henrick said.\u201cEat barley bread\u2026 That is a wise saying, but who said that?\u201d Iris asked.\u201cI made it up,\u201d Henrick replied.The Fire Troll High Priest stepped forward, and the Fire Trolls who were dying to become the tribal leader could not hide their excitement, causing a ruckus.\u201cSilence!\u201d the Fire Troll High Priest shouted, silencing the rowdy crowd. The old Fire Troll looked around at the surroundings with sharp eyes and asked, \u201cWho did you bring as a candidate to become the goddess\u2019 groom?!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll step up first!\u201d a Fire Troll at the forefront announced confidently. He had brought a large lizard with a chain around its neck. He declared, \u201cThis is a desert lizard that was roaming around the desert! I\u2019m certain it\u2019s a healthy male as per my inspection of its nether regions! It has the qualifications to become a groom!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve gone mad!\u201d the Fire Troll High Priest rebuked the Fire Troll.\u201cHow so?! I\u2019m certain it will be vigorous at night!\u201d the Fire Troll retorted, seemingly feeling it was unfair. However, the Fire Troll High Priest smacked him in the head.The other Fire Trolls were no different than the first one. They brought many kinds of creatures ranging from a small male spider to a male rattlesnake; some of them even brought male desert flowers. The only relevant being they brought was a small male dwarf.\u201cDon\u2019t be nervous! I\u2019ll let you go after this!\u201d the Fire Troll who had kidnapped the dwarf said as he removed the chains binding the dwarf.The dwarf immediately jumped up from the floor and took out a black marble, throwing it to the ground. The surrounding area was engulfed in a cloud of dark black smoke; the dwarf had disappeared by the time the smoke subsided.\u201cThat bastard ran away!\u201d the Fire Troll cried out as he slammed the ground.Henrick laughed at the sight unfolding in front of him and said, \u201cWhat a circus.\u201dFinally, the last Fire Troll left was Yanak. He said haughtily in a boastful tone, \u201cOne of the candidates I\u2019ve brought will become the goddess\u2019 groom in the end!\u201dThe Fire Troll High Priest approached Kang Yoon-Soo and Henrick and inspected them closely; his gaze was especially fixed on Kang Yoon-Soo. He then nodded and said, \u201cAlright! They have the qualifications to become the goddess\u2019 groom! Everyone, get ready for the trial by fire!\u201dThe Fire Trolls started to move around busily. Shaneth could not help but wonder, asking, \u201cWhat\u2019s the trial by fire?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a trial to endure a hot fire! They have to pass this trial to become qualified to be the groom of the goddess!\u201d the Fire Troll High Priest replied.The Fire Trolls brought out a rack filled with an assortment of defensive equipment. Its contents ranged from large chainmail shirts to sturdy tunics and various kinds of shields.The Fire Troll High Priest looked at the two men and shouted, \u201cThe trial by fire is simple! Choose one of the defensive items over here and endure the flames! You can use your own equipment if you wish! It doesn\u2019t matter if you sustain burns; you\u2019ll pass the trial as long as you don\u2019t pass out!\u201dYanak sneakily whispered to them, \u201cChoose the red tri-horned shield! It\u2019s made from wyvern leather, so it has strong fire resistance! But your hands will melt even if you block the fire with it!\u201d\u201cThanks for the advice, but don\u2019t you think your whisper is too loud?\u201d Henrick replied.\u201cIs that so?! We trolls always talk loudly!\u201d Yanak replied.The Fire Troll High Priest smacked Yanak in the head and rebuked him. \u201cYou! How dare you try and interrupt the trial!\u201d\u201cIt hurts!\u201d Yanak cried out.\u201cThis is the flame that will be used in the trial!\u201d the Fire Troll High Priest said as he brought out a heart engulfed in flames. Just from the looks of it, it was extremely hot.\u201cThe heart of a Fire Giant spews out flames that are too hot for anyone to deal with! It can melt the skin of most creatures and burn down entire mountains! Now, who shall challenge it first?!\u201d the Fire Troll High Priest asked.The flames spewed out by the Fire Giant\u2019s heart reached their feet; they were so hot that the soles of Henrick and Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s shoes melted after the lightest graze.Henrick quickly raised his hand and said, \u201cI give up.\u201d\u201cHenrick! How can you do this to me!\u201d Yanak cried out.\u201cDo you plan to see me get roasted or something?\u201d Henrick retorted as he walked back.Kang Yoon-Soo had been left alone.\u201cWill you accept the trial by fire?!\u201d the Fire Troll High Priest asked.\u201cYes,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.The crowd became rowdy once again, cheering when Kang Yoon-Soo accepted the trial. The Fire Trolls liked brave warriors. They gathered around to watch over Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s trial as if this were the first entertainment they had experienced in a long time.\u201cNow, choose your defensive equipment! Will you choose a shield or armor?!\u201d the Fire Troll High Priest asked.Kang Yoon-Soo chose the best defensive equipment in the temple\u2014Shaneth. He grabbed Shaneth by the wrist and pulled her close before saying, \u201cYou.\u201d\u201cEh\u2026? Yes?\u201d Shaneth responded confusedly with a dumbfounded expression.Kang Yoon-Soo said brazenly, \u201cI\u2019ll use this woman as my shield.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He plans to use that female as a shield!\u201d\u201cTo think such an evil person existed in this world!\u201d\u201cGoodness! He\u2019s worse than us! How can such trash even exist in this world?!\u201dThe surprised Fire Trolls murmured noisily, but Kang Yoon-Soo did not bat an eyelid as he grabbed Shaneth by the waist and pulled her close to him.\u201cEh?\u201d Shaneth was flustered, and her face turned red. However, Kang Yoon-Soo did not seem to be bothered by that at all.\u201cWill you really use that female as a shield?\u201d the Fire Troll High Priest asked.Kang Yoon-Soo nodded and replied, \u201cYes.\u201dHenrick and Iris, on the other hand, were not surprised at all; it was as if they had already expected the current situation.\u201cI respect that guy sometimes. It wouldn\u2019t be easy for someone to do something like that even if they went mad,\u201d Henrick said.\u201cAs expected of Kang Yoon-Soo,\u201d Iris added.Shaneth looked at Kang Yoon-Soo and let out a sigh as she said, \u201cYou\u2019re probably the only person who would ever brazenly use me as a shield.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re fine with it anyway,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.\u201cBut still, you should at least give me some time to prepare myself for it. You cook in my place for a day in return,\u201d Shaneth said.Kang Yoon-Soo flinched slightly and replied, \u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201d\u201cThen how about just for breakfast tomorrow?\u201d Shaneth asked as she clung to Kang Yoon-Soo.Kang Yoon-Soo replied quietly, \u201cSure\u2026\u201dThe Fire Troll High Priest grabbed the sizzling heart, and the flames surrounding it started to grow stronger. He shouted, \u201cLet the trial by fire commence!\u201dAn intense flame spewed out of the hand that held the Fire Giant\u2019s heart, and hot red light shone on the surroundings.Fwooosh!Kang Yoon-Soo quickly used(?) Shaneth to block the flames. The flames reached Shaneth\u2019s shoulder and abdomen as if it were trying to grab and engulf her, but it was not able to burn her, nor was it even able to burn her clothes; it simply died out.\u201cOh my! The flames disappeared as soon as they reached the female!\u201d\u201cI think that female is thicker-skinned than us!\u201dNext, the Fire Giant\u2019s heart spewed out bluish flames; the heat from them crashed into the duo like a tidal wave.Fwoooosh!The blue flames spread out as they rushed forward, but Kang Yoon-Soo immediately grabbed Shaneth by her waist and pulled her around to block the flames. His movements were so smooth and gentle that it made it seem as if they were dancing.\u201cI\u2019m getting dizzy\u2026\u201d Shaneth complained.\u201cDeal with it,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied as he moved around with Shaneth in tow.The flames started to speed up as they moved toward the two, but it seemed almost as if they were still too slow for Kang Yoon-Soo, as he skillfully read their trajectory.Shaneth held on tightly to Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s shoulders. It felt as if time had slowed down and it was just the two of them in this world.Badump\u2026 Badump\u2026The sound of Shaneth\u2019s heartbeat traveled all the way to her fingertips, and Kang Yoon-Soo felt a strange, hard-to-describe feeling from her touch. The sensation made him reminisce about the past.\u2018Don\u2019t. Don\u2019t think about it,\u2019 he warned himself.Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s eyes trembled and his vision of the surroundings disappeared, however. What greeted him next was the memory of the life when he had married Shaneth. He had cried on the day he had tied the knot and exchanged marriage vows with Shaneth, but he could not remember why.\u2018We had a child,\u2019 he thought.He could not exactly remember if they had lived happily, but he thought they had.\u2018\u2026What was the name of our kid?\u2019 Kang Yoon-Soo thought as he tried to remember.His child, who had disappeared and no longer existed. His and Shaneth\u2019s child, who had died when the Demon Lord destroyed the world. His child, whom he was no longer able to hold in his arms.His family.\u2018How could I forget the name of my own child?\u2019\u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 was the only answer he could come up with. Forget about how the child looked; he could not even remember whether they had been a boy or a girl.\u2018I didn\u2019t have any more children after that.\u2019He had made a decision about the life that would have been born in an instant; that same child was no longer going to be born.However\u2026\u2018One thing I\u2019m sure of\u2026\u2019That was right. He was aware of it. He was aware of the fact that the world had been destroyed by the Demon Lord, and that the Demon Lord was the reason why his family had been broken up.\u2018I tried to ignore it. I started a family even though I knew the child would end up dying.\u2019He had wanted to live a normal life like other people. A normal, happy life where he could start a family and grow old. He had wanted to continue living ignorant of the fact that the world would be destroyed.\u2018I tried to forget that life. I tried to forget about my child.\u2019He had regressed after the world was destroyed, and he had been left alone all over again. The things he had tried so hard to protect were all gone. Would this final life of his be any different?\u201cKang Yoon-Soo?\u201dThe hallucinations disappeared, and the world was back again. Perhaps the trial was already over, as the flames had stopped coming after them.Shaneth stared at Kang Yoon-Soo, her eyes wide in shock. She asked, \u201cWhy are you crying?\u201dThe surroundings were quiet, and Kang Yoon-Soo touched the tears flowing down his cheek.They were wet.\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied as he wiped his tears away.The Fire Troll High Priest shouted, \u201cHe has cleared the trial by fire! This man is the groom of the goddess!\u201d\u201cOOOOOHHH!\u201dThe Fire Trolls had been staring stupidly with their mouths hanging wide open, and they cheered loudly only after they realized what was going on due to the Fire Troll High Priest\u2019s announcement.Iris tilted her head and asked, \u201cWhy did Kang Yoon-Soo suddenly cry?\u201d\u201cI guess a wave of emotions welled up from somewhere deep within his heart\u2026?\u201d Henrick replied with a shrug.\u201cOoo, the groom of the goddess! Congratulations! You have earned the right to draw the Sword of Revelation!\u201d the Fire Troll High Priest exclaimed.Kang Yoon-Soo put down Shaneth and walked toward the sword even before the Fire Troll High Priest was done speaking. He immediately pulled out the white sword.[Sword of Revelation]Rating: RareAttack Power: 127A sword that is instilled with the benevolence of the goddess. It is one of the seven holy artifacts spread across the continent. It is said that a one-of-a-kind blessing will be bestowed upon the person who collects all seven holy artifacts.*It will give immense power to someone who has been resurrected.*It will guide the user to the Temple of the Angels.*Only a person acknowledged by the high priest may use this weapon.Kang Yoon-Soo sheathed the Sword of Revelation on his waist.The Fire Trolls all cheered in awe as they shouted.\u201cTo think he would ignore the high priest and pull out the sword! I like this guy!\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s the manifestation of evil itself! I want to live free like that too!\u201d\u201cI think the goddess likes him because he\u2019s handsome and bad!\u201dThe Fire Troll High Priest furrowed his brow and shouted, \u201cSilence!\u201dThe Fire Trolls shut their mouths.Yanak confidently walked forward and shouted, \u201cHigh priest! Since the candidate I brought has become the groom, am I the tribal leader now?!\u201dThe Fire Troll High Priest grimaced as if to show his disapproval and answered, \u201cI don\u2019t like it, but I have no choice! The promise has to be kept! Yanak, you\u2019re now the tribal leader of the Fire Trolls!\u201d\u201cOOOOHHH!\u201dYanak sniffled as a wave of emotions swept over him.\u201cCongratulations, Yanak!\u201d\u201cI knew you would pull it off!\u201dThe other Fire Trolls congratulated and encouraged him.Yanak shouted proudly, \u201cI, Yanak, will give my first command as your leader!\u201d\u201cWhat is it?!\u201d\u201cEveryone! Live a happy life!\u201d Yanak cried.\u201cOOOOOHH!\u201dThe Fire Trolls\u2019 eyes were wet with tears due to the emotional first command of their new leader.Henrick watched the scene unfold in front of him and said sarcastically, \u201cWhat a tear-jerker.\u201dThe Fire Troll High Priest stood in front of Kang Yoon-Soo and said, \u201cGroom of the goddess! Your wielding that sword means the goddess has acknowledged you! You\u2019ve received an incomparable title and the gentle warmth of the goddess! I\u2019m not sure of the reason, but Goddess Sylphia wants to keep you by her side and prepare for the future\u2026\u201d\u201cStop. Just give me the quest already.\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo cut off the Fire Troll High Priest.The Fire Troll High Priest grimaced and said, \u201cThe scouts we\u2019ve sent to the western frontier haven\u2019t returned! A man-eating Anthell was located west of here! Our scouts have been eaten by that Anthell according to eyewitnesses! We have to kill that bastard and rescue our comrades! Are you with us?!\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied with a nod.[Legendary Quest\u2014Giant Anthell Hunt]The Giant Anthell is a predator that roams the Desert of Death. The monster gobbles up everything in its path and can even swallow a troll whole. There is still some time left before the digestive enzymes of the Giant Anthell fully digests the trolls.

He said, \u201cHey\u2026 If your scouts were eaten by this Anthell, shouldn\u2019t you have prioritized that instead of all this goddess\u2019 groom nonsense\u2026?\u201dYanak explained, \u201cIt happens more than four times a week! I was also eaten by a large snake in the past, and I was rescued just before I was digested! It\u2019s not a serious issue!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just curious, but\u2026 Why did your previous leader resign from his position\u2026?\u201d Henrick asked.\u201cOur previous leader died while sandbathing in the desert!\u201d Yanak replied.\u201cWhat a mess\u2026\u201d Henrick said, sincerely surprised by the trolls.Shaneth looked worriedly at Kang Yoon-Soo and asked, \u201cAre you alright? Is there something wrong?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied coldly.They packed up and prepared to head toward the west of the desert.***Anthells usually lived buried under the sand; it was not easy finding the monster.\u201cHere,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said, pointing to a corner.Yanak tilted his head and asked skeptically, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201dIt was at that moment that Yanak took a step toward the place Kang Yoon-Soo had pointed out that\u2026Rumble\u2026 Rumble\u2026The sand suddenly collapsed, and a large pincer shot out of it.\u201cIt\u2019s the Giant Anthell!\u201d\u201cThis place is that bastard\u2019s hunting ground!\u201dThe circular sandpit sucked in anything near it; it was not going to be easy to escape if anything fell into it. The Giant Anthell just stayed in place as it watched its prey, not moving an inch.There were only ten minutes left on the legendary quest\u2019s time limit, and the trolls who had been eaten by the Giant Anthell could end up being digested if they failed to rescue them within that time.Kang Yoon-Soo pulled out his sword and shouted, \u201cBe careful and avoid the traps. The Anthell\u2019s weakness is the space beneath its chin.\u201d He then summoned White.\u201cUrnokra!\u201dKang Yoon-Soo jumped up on the beast, and the werewolf dashed through the sand toward the predator.Slash!Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s sword struck the Anthell\u2019s chin. The Giant Anthell squirmed for a moment before it shot up out of the sand.\u201cKyerrerek!\u201d\u201cThe bastard came out of his hole!\u201d\u201cWe have to kill it now!\u201dForty Fire Trolls simultaneously attacked the Giant Anthell. The burning skin that was their racial trait could inflict fire damage on anything nearby when so many of them gathered together. The clubs they wielded were simple weapons, but the Fire Trolls were immensely strong.Kwachik!\u201cKyrerkrerkk!\u201d The Anthell screamed. It had sustained damage quickly; it dove back in and hid underneath the sand.\u201cHenrick,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo called out.Henrick nodded and spread out his mana threads, muttering, \u201cThread Tying.\u201d The Anthell\u2019s body was wrapped in Henrick\u2019s mana threads.Iris grabbed Henrick by his waist to hold him in place. Henrick grimaced and asked with a frown, \u201cCan you not do that?\u201d\u201cHenrick is weaker than me,\u201d Iris replied.\u201cDamn it\u2026\u201d Henrick muttered.Iris smiled before pulling Henrick back with all her might. Henrick grimaced, feeling as if his arm would be torn off. The Giant Anthell wrapped up in Henrick\u2019s mana threads started to be pulled out of the sand bit by bit.\u201cPyrokinesis!\u201d Shaneth shouted as she swung her scythe, and balls of flame shot out of it.The fireballs struck the Giant Anthell\u2019s eyes and combusted. The Fire Trolls did not miss the chance to pounce on the predator.\u201cKyerrkrk!\u201d The Anthell screamed and squirmed as it felt its life force quickly ebbing.Then White, who was carrying Kang Yoon-Soo on its back, quickly shot toward the predator. Kang Yoon-Soo jumped high up and stabbed his sword into the Anthell\u2019s head as he landed.Pukeok!Thud!The Giant Anthell fell to the ground, with only one minute remaining on the quest timer.\u201cWe won!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s cut its belly up!\u201dThe Fire Trolls quickly cut the Anthell\u2019s belly open. Numerous Fire Trolls drenched in the predator\u2019s sticky stomach fluid rolled out of it.\u201cRark! You\u2019re alive!\u201d\u201cI fell asleep! The fluids were a bit sticky, but it was quite cozy inside this guy!\u201d\u201cRikwi! I knew you were going to make it out alive!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nice to see you again! I was the first to get eaten so my skin is a bit eroded, but this will heal in no time!\u201dThere were sixteen trolls inside the stomach of the Giant Anthell, and all of them greeted their new tribe leader once they got out of the predator\u2019s stomach.\u201cThank you for saving us, Chief Yanak!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s something I had to do! Don\u2019t mention it!\u201d Yanak replied proudly.The day ended, and they decided to camp out in the desert.Shaneth asked worriedly, \u201cAren\u2019t you going to eat dinner?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied as he just stared into the horizon of the dark desert.Henrick suddenly walked up and patted his shoulder, saying, \u201cHey, you, come with me for a minute.\u201dThe two men walked up a sand dune, and the view of the cold, lifeless desert greeted them.Henrick asked quietly, \u201cIs it hard?\u201d\u201cYeah,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.Henrick did not inquire any further. He quietly took out two cups from his backpack and poured a drink. He offered, \u201cHave a drink.\u201dKang Yoon-Soo took the cup, and the smell of the strong alcohol tickled his nose. His head hurt whenever he drank, which helped him forget most of his memories.\u2018This is my final life. I have to let go of all attachments.\u2019He brought the cup to his lips to forget the pain of his failures, and to forget his child who had disappeared\u2026Kang Yoon-Soo drank to forget everything.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There had just been a large-scale battle where the Fire Giant clashed with a thousand mummies, but only a measly twenty-one mummies had been killed. It was an overwhelming victory.\u201cI-it\u2019s amazing\u2026!\u201d Katz exclaimed, astounded by what he had just seen.He had been beside Kartheon at all times, ever since he awoke the sleeping ancient king\u2014to be precise, he could not escape.\u2018Even though he\u2019s an ancient king, to think he could so easily take down a Fire Giant\u2026!\u2019 Katz thought to himself.A Fire Giant was a rare monster in the Desert of Death that only appeared once in a while, during the seventh mirage of the month. It was as tall as a mountain, and the flames engulfing its body could burn everything near it. Kartheon had successfully hunted down a creature that was no different from a calamity.\u2018I guess an ancient king is an ancient king after all,\u2019 Katz thought.Kartheon had stayed in the rear for the whole battle, but he had been giving out commands to his army. His legion of mummies had fully obeyed his commands during the entire battle, making them all the more ferocious.[You have defeated Elkana, the Fire Giant of Disaster.][You have obtained 147 units of temporal power.][Your amiability with the Ice Giants has increased.]\u201cStill a long way to go,\u201d Kartheon muttered with a bored expression.Katz hesitated for a moment before asking, \u201cUhmm\u2026 May I ask what the level of your majesty is?\u201d\u201cLevel 13 until I defeated the Fire Giant,\u201d Kartheon replied.\u201cWhat?\u201d Katz was shocked and just stood there, blinking. He had thought that Kartheon would at least be Level 40.Kartheon seemed to have found the human\u2019s reaction amusing, as the corners of his dried, withered lips turned up slightly. He explained, \u201cMy body has deteriorated because my resurrection took place after a long time. I used to be Level 527 in the past, but that is all gone now. I can absorb life force thanks to the trinket I was buried with, but I am nowhere as strong as I used to be in the past. I sacrificed a lot of things just to be resurrected.\u201d\u201cI-it\u2019s amazing. It must be hard to have lost all of your levels. No, no, I don\u2019t mean to offend your majesty,\u201d Katz replied, trembling.\u201cThat is why I am trying to regress to the past,\u201d Kartheon said. He kicked the sides of the bandage-wrapped camel he was riding on. The camel quickly ran forward, and Katz hurriedly followed after it.Kartheon spoke once again when Katz finally caught up with the camel. \u201cKatz, my body has deteriorated, but I will gather temporal power by killing everything on this continent. I will go back in time and kill Sirian, and I will make Sharshyanon flourish.\u201dKatz looked at Kartheon. The ancient king was a strange man in his eyes. Kartheon had the commanding presence of a king and he was strict, but at the same time, he was warmer than anyone else. He was a king who commanded fear and respect, but there were times when he felt like an older brother or a friend. Had he not just openly exposed his weakness just then?\u2018It\u2019s impossible for me to kill Kartheon. Wouldn\u2019t he just stop or turn back time and kill me instead?\u2019 Katz thought.Rustle\u2026 Rustle\u2026Thousands of mummies trailed behind the two men, and the sound of their footsteps echoed through the vast desert. The sunset bathed the desert in a red hue. It was a sight that could only be seen once a day when the sun set in the Desert of Death.\u201cDo you think regression is the only answer?\u201d Katz asked. He would normally have been scared to speak out like that, but he felt strangely comfortable for some reason.Kartheon raised his nonexistent eyebrows and asked, \u201cWhat other answers are there?\u201d\u201cYour majesty has to kill everyone in the continent to regress,\u201d Katz said. Perhaps it was because of the sunset hue shining on his head, but his brain was working quite quickly at that moment. He continued, \u201cThis world will disappear if your majesty regresses to the past. This wonderful desert and I will not exist if that happens. Will you not feel troubled if you are the only person who can remember this world?\u201dKartheon scoffed at his words and responded, \u201cKatz, one cannot be a king with such a weak will as yours.\u201d\u201cBut your majesty is a human too, right?\u201d Katz asked.\u201cIt seems to me that you do not want me to destroy this world,\u201d Kartheon said. Katz immediately shut his mouth. Kartheon continued coldly, \u201cI will kill everything on this continent, and you are no exception.\u201d\u201cWell, I\u2019m nothing but a measly graverobber, and I was also nothing but a thief back in my world, so your majesty doesn\u2019t have to be mindful of someone like me. I\u2019m nothing but a criminal. But\u2026\u201d Katz trailed off as he stared at the blazing sunset, before continuing tearfully, \u201cIt\u2019s a bit sad to think that such a beautiful sight will be gone forever.\u201d\u201cThis place was a lush forest, and it looked much better in ancient times,\u201d Kartheon said.\u201c\u2026is that so, your majesty?\u201d Katz replied. However, he soon fell silent and bit his lower lip, thinking, \u2018It didn\u2019t work. Damn it\u2026\u2019***Iris woke up early in the morning, and looked around at those who were still sleeping. Two people who should have been asleep were not there. Iris tilted her head in confusion as she thought, \u2018Where did those two cute men go?\u2019Then, a voice she had not heard in a while answered. No, it was not a voice, but rather a message that popped up in her head.On top of the sand dune to the northwest.\u201cThank you,\u201d Iris said as she slowly walked up the sand dune.Henrick was sleeping drunkenly with his body half-buried under the sand, and Iris lightly jumped over him. She asked Kang Yoon-Soo, \u201cYou didn\u2019t sleep?\u201d\u201cYeah,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied. He was looking into the horizon as dawn finally came. The cold desert gradually started to heat up again.\u201cIt\u2019s not good to stay up all night,\u201d Iris said.Kang Yoon-Soo nodded and stared at Iris before asking, \u201cWhy is this the last life?\u201d\u201cI do not know,\u201d Iris replied.\u201cAsk,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.Iris put both hands on her chest and thought, \u2018White Shadow, why is this Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s final life?\u2019Iris waited.Kang Yoon-Soo waited.Silence filled the area.\u201cThere was no response,\u201d Iris said.Kang Yoon-Soo walked past Iris without a word, then grabbed Henrick\u2019s shoulder and shook him awake. He said, \u201cWake up.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll give you the response every lazy person on this continent says when someone tells them that. I don\u2019t want to,\u201d Henrick replied.\u201cLet\u2019s have a drink again,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.\u201cAck! You punk! Don\u2019t your insides hurt?!\u201d Henrick exclaimed in horror as he ran down the sand dune.Iris walked up behind Kang Yoon-Soo and called out, \u201cKang Yoon-Soo.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.\u201cWould you still have considered me your comrade if the White Shadow had not been inside me?\u201d Iris asked.\u201cNo,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied. Tears started welling up in Iris\u2019 eyes, and Kang Yoon-Soo blinked silently a few times before saying, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cI still want to be with Kang Yoon-Soo,\u201d Iris said.\u201cYou are right now,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.Iris shook her head and said, \u201cI do not mean it that way.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t like you that way,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said, drawing a firm line.\u201cOh my, I was not talking about love. I want to marry a man who can tell me fun stories all night long,\u201d Iris said.\u201cThen what did you mean?\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo asked.Iris looked at the sand beneath her feet. She bent down to pick up a handful of sand before throwing it in the air. The sand grains in the air reflected the sunlight, sparkling like gold.\u201cIt is because Kang Yoon-Soo is a strange Traveler,\u201d Iris said.\u201cWhat?\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo asked.\u201cKang Yoon-Soo is emotionless and quiet, and you do not explain what you are going to do to other people. You do not tell your secrets to others, but you are fully aware of others\u2019 secrets. You are a really boring man,\u201d Iris said.\u201cI know,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.\u201cThen how were we able to travel with you?\u201d Iris asked.Kang Yoon-Soo fell silent and thought for a moment before replying, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201dIris smiled brightly as the rising desert sun shone on her flowing hair. She remarked, \u201cYou are sacrificing yourself for the people precious to you, no?\u201d\u201cOthers aren\u2019t aware of it,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.\u201cThey know. They might not be aware of your numerous regressions, but they know that you care. Your kindness, your sacrifice, and even your loneliness,\u201d Iris said.\u201cHow?\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo asked.Iris was about to reply when Kang Yoon-Soo suddenly drew his sword and swung at her.Sukeok!A sandworm shot up from the sand, jumping on Iris and trying to swallow her whole, but Kang Yoon-Soo sliced its head in half before nonchalantly sheathing his sword.Iris did not seem to be surprised at all. Instead, she was looking at Kang Yoon-Soo with a smile. She asked, \u201cDo you understand now?\u201dKang Yoon-Soo did not reply. Instead, he silently walked down the sand dune. Iris smiled as she followed right behind him.***\u201cAre you awake?\u201d Shaneth asked as she stretched and woke up.The Fire Trolls also woke up and lazily got up from the ground.\u201cI don\u2019t wanna get up! 10 more minutes!\u201d\u201cNo! The sandstorm will start raging once again if we\u2019re late.\u201dHenrick tried to gulp down a bottle of water to quench his thirst, then angrily frowned and complained, \u201cThere\u2019s no water!\u201d\u201cWhat?! There\u2019s no water?! How could this be?!\u201d the Fire Trolls shouted in surprise. Even though they were used to the desert, it was still impossible for them to travel across the desert without water.Kang Yoon-Soo suddenly said, \u201cLet\u2019s go to the elves\u2019 settlement.\u201d\u201cBut the elves live too far from here!\u201d the Fire Trolls protested.\u201cI know a way,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied nonchalantly as he brought out the sandworm\u2019s long corpse. The monster that looked like a mix of a lizard and a worm was covered in blood.Henrick asked with a curious expression, \u201cYou\u2026 What are you doing right now\u2026?\u201dKang Yoon-Soo dragged the corpse of the sandworm over and started to slice it into pieces. He then sliced those further into smaller pieces that were just the right size for the group to eat.Shaneth jumped in surprise and immediately asked in surprise, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\u201cYou told me to make breakfast,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied as he lit the fire.***It was a very abundant breakfast. Kang Yoon-Soo had cooked the sandworm meat well, turning it into a tasty meat dish that even those who had been disgusted and repulsed by the idea of eating sandworm meat also ate as well. The soup made from its thin skin and the meat skewers were quite good.\u201cIt\u2019s really tasty,\u201d Shaneth said as she praised Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s cooking.\u201cDon\u2019t make me cook ever again,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.He had cooked an amount that would make anyone think he made too much, but the Fire Trolls had wolfed down everything and there were no leftovers.The Fire Trolls rubbed their full stomachs and exclaimed in satisfaction.\u201cThank you! The groom of the goddess!\u201d\u201cIt was a delicious meal! Although I wish there were more!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right! The goddess needed a groom who could cook!\u201dThe party packed their things and prepared to walk across the desert once again, with Kang Yoon-Soo walking at the forefront and guiding them. Around two hours after they departed, they found a small cave opening.\u201cLet\u2019s go in,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.\u201cIt\u2019s too narrow! Our heads are grinding against the ceiling!\u201d the Fire Trolls complained.\u201cDuck,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.The Fire Trolls hesitantly entered the dark and narrow cave, which lit up thanks to the flames surrounding their bodies. The cave started to become wider as they passed through.\u201cIt\u2019s the exit!\u201dBright, warm sunlight greeted them as soon as they exited the cave. Numerous buildings that complemented the desert surroundings were visible over the horizon.\u201cIt\u2019s the elves\u2019 settlement!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s faster than going around the desert! Even those of us who have lived a long time in the desert didn\u2019t know about this!\u201dIt was at that moment, when the excited Fire Trolls were about to enter the elves\u2019 settlement, that Yanak suddenly shouted, \u201cStop! Something\u2019s strange!\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d the other Fire Trolls asked.\u201cLook closely! It\u2019s too quiet, and there are no elves in sight!\u201d Yanak replied.Now that they thought about it, he was right. There would normally be a few elves at this time of day, but it was too quiet. They saw a shadow suddenly move between the buildings, but the shadow quickly disappeared soon after.\u201cMaybe they\u2019re all taking a nap?\u201d a Fire Troll asked.Yanak made a makeshift speaking trumpet and shouted, \u201cHello! Are you guys alright?!\u201dHowever, the only response he got was deafening silence.It was at that moment that suddenly, in place of a reply, an arrow flew toward them.Shhhkkk!There was quite a distance between them, but they were certain that it was an arrow fired by an elf, based on its accurate trajectory despite the distance.Yanak caught the arrow aimed at his head with his bare hands, crushing it. He exclaimed, \u201cSomething\u2019s wrong! Let\u2019s go check it out!\u201d\u201cA kidnapping ring took over that village,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said nonchalantly.The Fire Trolls jumped in surprise.\u201cAre you sure?!\u201d\u201cHow do you know?!\u201d\u201cThe goddess\u2019 groom is on a different level!\u201dYanak was now getting nervous and impatient, saying, \u201cIf they took over the village, we should immediately go and help them!\u201d\u201cThey might have taken the elves hostage, though,\u201d Shaneth cautioned, warning them to be mindful of any hostages.The Fire Trolls glowed red as if to show that they were angry. One of them spoke up. \u201cThen what should we do?! We can\u2019t sit around here and just watch, right?!\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said as he walked toward the village. He was alone, and of course, an arrow flew toward him.Shhhheeeek!Kang Yoon-Soo swung his sword and split the arrow in two. He continued to walk forward while cutting down all the arrows aimed at him.\u201cGoddess\u2019 groom! You might die at this rate!\u201d\u201cGo try and stop him! Isn\u2019t he your comrade?!\u201d the Fire Trolls said.Henrick seemed awfully calm in the eyes of the Fire Trolls as he said, \u201cBased on my experience, that guy never dies when pulling those kinds of stunts alone. Of course, it\u2019s a different story when it comes to someone he\u2019s killing.\u201dKang Yoon-Soo looked ahead and said, \u201cI\u2019ll go and negotiate with them.\u201dYanak seemed confused and skeptical as he replied, \u201cA deal? We don\u2019t have anything to trade with the elves!\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 That guy\u2019s style of negotiations is a little bit different from the negotiations you\u2019re used to seeing,\u201d Henrick said as he picked up a sand crystal and started carving it with his sculpting knife.Shaneth nodded in agreement and said, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a negotiation that only benefits Kang Yoon-Soo.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 78": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Record of a Thousand LivesChapter 79Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayRwekarn was known as \u2018Watcher\u2019. It was a nickname he had received after becoming known for living off his ability to observe and read people. Reading people was not a useful skill for petty thieves and pickpockets, but it was a very useful one for someone who stole the \u2018person\u2019 themself.\u2018I easily obtained an A-grade item. I guess coming to the desert was worthwhile,\u2019 Rwekarn thought as he looked at the elves he had managed to catch.The elves were blindfolded, gagged, and so tightly bound that they could not even squirm.Rwekarn and his party had infiltrated the elf village by posing as adventurers. He thought, \u2018I never thought something so obvious would work.\u2019The kind but ignorant elves had welcomed them with open arms, but Rwekarn\u2019s party had secretly spiked the elves\u2019 food with sleeping drugs. The elves had immediately fallen asleep after eating and slept through the day, and Rwekarn\u2019s party had bound them up while they were sleeping.\u2018I heard the desert elves innately know magic from birth, but it\u2019s fine since I gagged them to prevent them from casting any spells,\u2019 Rwekarn thought.One of Rwekarn\u2019s lackeys came up to him and asked, \u201cBoss, can\u2019t we choose just one of these bitches to use as our plaything?\u201dThe elves started to cry through their gags from fear. Most of them just threw hostile glares at their captors, but some of the female elves could not hold back from crying.\u201cYou fool, have you ever heard of a merchant who lays his hands on his merchandise?\u201d Rwekarn shot back.\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m saying we\u2019ll just use one. You can have first dibs, boss,\u201d the lackey said.Rwekarn grimaced and glared at the lackey, saying, \u201cStop talking nonsense and go secure our escape route. We\u2019ll transport the elves by carriage.\u201d\u201cWhy? It\u2019s not as if anything\u2019s going to change if we take one elf\u2026\u201d the lackey said, sounding disappointed.\u201cI said go secure our escape route,\u201d Rwekarn repeated firmly.\u201c\u2026Alright, boss,\u201d the lackey said. He turned around, discontent visible on his face.\u2018I don\u2019t want to make more enemies by touching a girl who could be someone important,\u2019 Rwekarn thought.Rwekarn had his own principles and he stood by them. He stood firmly by his principle not to touch any of the \u2018goods\u2019 he kidnapped until they were brought to the market and sold. That was one of the reasons why he had been able to survive for such a long time as a slave trader.He motioned the elves to stand up with a finger; a good forty elves had been captured by his party.\u2018It\u2019s retirement as soon as I finish this transaction,\u2019 Rwekarn thought. He was tired of living as a villain. It had started as a way to make ends meet and had turned into a lucrative business, but there was not a day that passed without him burying his guilty conscience.\u201cBoss!\u201d The lackey who had just gone out to secure their escape route suddenly came back in a hurry.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Rwekarn asked.\u201cSomeone\u2019s headed this way!\u201d the lackey reported.\u201cHow many are there?\u201d Rwekarn asked.\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 He\u2019s alone!\u201d the lackey replied.Rwekarn immediately smacked the lackey on the head and berated him. \u201cThen just go and kill him already! What are you causing a ruckus for?!\u201d\u201cT-that\u2019s\u2026 It\u2019s not easy to kill him!\u201d the lackey replied.\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Rwekarn furrowed his brow and exited the tent with his sword in hand.A man was slowly and leisurely walking toward the village; he could afford to relax because he was able to easily cut down any arrows that flew toward him.\u201cTri-Shot!\u201d a lackey shouted, firing three consecutive arrows at the man. The arrows flew in a straight line toward the man, but the man easily avoided two of them and blocked the third one that was aimed at his thigh.The lackey who had been firing the arrows grumbled from exhaustion, \u201cDamn it, I\u2019m out of arrows now.\u201d\u201cHe must be very skilled if he\u2019s managed to avoid the arrows shot from an elven bow,\u201d Rwekarn remarked.\u201cShould I go and bring more arrows?\u201d the lackey asked.\u201cNo, never mind. The elven arrows are all money,\u201d Rwekarn said, stroking his beard.Then, another lackey spoke up and asked, \u201cShould I go and dispose of him myself?\u201d\u201cArthur, we\u2019re already shorthanded dealing with the elves. I don\u2019t want to lose more men,\u201d Rwekarn said.\u201cI can deal with him,\u201d another lackey said.Rwekarn scoffed and asked, \u201cWhat was your name again?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s Hekel, boss,\u201d the lackey named Hekel replied.\u201cAlright, Hekel. Do you think you\u2019re a knight or something? We\u2019re just a group of slave and organ traffickers. I can tell at a glance that you\u2019d lose to that guy, so quit it,\u201d Rwekarn retorted. Hekel seemed to be greatly offended, but he chose to remain silent and stay in his place.\u201cWhat brings you here?\u201d Rwekarn asked the man.\u201cI came to negotiate,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said in a low voice.\u201cWhat do you propose?\u201d Rwekarn asked.\u201cI have business with the elves. Let them go,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo answered.\u201cAnd what will I get in return?\u201d Rwekarn asked.\u201cNothing,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.Rwekarn and his party blinked a few times. Rwekarn asked just in case he had heard the man wrongly, \u201cWhat did you say just now?\u201d\u201cNothing in return,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said once again.\u201cWhat kind of a negotiation is that?\u201d Rwekarn asked. He and his eight lackeys all seemed dumbfounded by Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s brazen words.However, he suddenly raised his brow and muttered, \u201cWait\u2026 That guy\u2026?\u201d\u201cWhat is it boss?\u201d the lackeys asked.\u201cThere have been some rumors flying around these days,\u201d Rwekarn said as he stared at Kang Yoon-Soo. He continued, \u201cThe Crossed Swords Bandits and the Fake Carriage Bandits. They\u2019re well-known criminals on the continent, but didn\u2019t people say they got done in by someone?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know, boss,\u201d the lackey answered.\u201cThey say there was an expressionless guy who didn\u2019t bat an eye as he swept across those bandits. The people call him the \u2018Bandit Nemesis\u2019 because they think any criminals who cross paths with him won\u2019t make it out in one piece. It\u2019s quite a famous story in this industry,\u201d Rwekarn said.\u201cThen are you saying\u2026 That guy is the Bandit Nemesis?\u201d the lackey asked.\u201cI have a feeling\u2026\u201d Rwekarn replied.\u201cThen that means we\u2019ll be pummeled and be done in by that one guy\u2026?\u201d the lackey asked again.Hekel laughed as if the whole thing sounded absurd to him. He remarked, \u201cBoss, do you think such a notorious guy would be here in this harsh desert? Also, where in the continent would you find a madman who would clash head-on against a band of bandits alone? It sounds like the kind of cheap story those drunks at the pub would peddle for a drink.\u201dRwekarn lived off of his instinct alone. He was certain that the man in front of him was not an ordinary man, based on his courage to walk over alone. His instincts were telling him to avoid fighting the man at all costs.\u201cBring one elf over here,\u201d he said.\u201cDo you finally plan to have some fun, boss? Hehehe\u2026!\u201d Hekel replied.Rwekarn kicked Hekel as soon as the other man finished laughing sleazily. Hekel seemed disgruntled by the fact that he had been kicked, and he rubbed his chin as he dragged a female elf to Rwekarn.The elf was blindfolded, but anyone could see she was a beauty. Rwekarn brought a blade to her neck and said, \u201cYou must be acquainted with them if you\u2019re trying to save them. Stand back at once if you don\u2019t want this woman to die!\u201dKang Yoon-Soo did not reply. Instead, he pulled out a dagger from his sleeve as if he had been waiting for the situation to occur, and threw it.Rwekarn jumped back as he tried to avoid the dagger, but the dagger had not been aimed at him in the first place. The dagger Kang Yoon-Soo had thrown narrowly missed the female elf and only grazed past her mouth; the gag covering her mouth fell as soon as the dagger flew past it.\u201cDamn it!\u201d Rwekarn shouted as he stuffed his fingers inside the elf\u2019s mouth. However, the elf bit his fingers hard and ran away from him.\u201cExtinguish, as a candle before a storm!\u201d the elf shouted.Rwekarn and his gang tensed as soon as the elf finished casting her spell, but nothing happened. Hekel mocked the elf. \u201cHaha! Were you in a rush? You seem to have made a mistake casting your spell!\u201dSuddenly, numerous voices rang out from the tent.\u201cMay shining light burn the bodies of these evildoers.\u201d\u201cO light that shines brighter than the stars, please punish these vile creatures.\u201d\u201cI call forth the sands of the earth to crush them!\u201dThe tent where the elves had been kept captive flew away. Rwekarn and his gang were thrown up into the air as well. They did not grow wings all of a sudden; rather, they just flew up into the air.A combined magic attack made up of fire, ice, and sand hit them hard, breaking a few of the kidnappers\u2019 ribs.\u201cKuheok!\u201d Rwekarn gasped, spinning a few times in midair before landing face-first on the desert sand. He managed to pull his head out of the sand, and he shook his head to come back to his senses.However, Kang Yoon-Soo was standing in front of him with his sword drawn. He said, \u201cHand over everything you have.\u201d\u201c\u2026The rumors were true. Please spare me! Take this if you want\u2026!\u201d Rwekarn pleaded as he pulled out a black marble from his chest pocket.Suddenly, however, he threw the black marble onto the ground, and a cloud of thick black smoke covered the area.\u201cRun! Run as fast as you can!\u201d he shouted. He ran as fast as he could while struggling with his broken ribs, and his lackeys did the same as they ran for their lives.Kang Yoon-Soo did not chase after them, and just stood there as he watched them escape.\u201cIt\u2019s a cave!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s hide in there!\u201dThe kidnappers entered the cave and breathed a sigh of relief as they thought they had managed to escape from danger.However\u2026What lay in wait for them was sixty club-wielding Fire Trolls who had suddenly appeared from the darkness of the cave.\u201cThose guys! They ran away the same way as that dwarf I caught! Thinking about it is making me mad!\u201d\u201cWe have to teach these kidnappers a lesson!\u201d\u201cOur elven friends almost got sold off because of them!\u201dThe Fire Trolls were cold and harsh, unlike their usual warm and gentle personalities.Henrick approached Kang Yoon-Soo and patted him on the shoulder as he remarked, \u201cThis happened last time with the carriage as well\u2026 You don\u2019t seem to get along with bandits.\u201d\u201cI know, right?\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo responded.***\u201cThank you for saving us,\u201d the elf village chief said, grabbing both of Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s hands. He looked like a man in his thirties despite his title as the village chief, but of course, he was likely much older than he looked.\u201cBut didn\u2019t you get captured too easily? Aren\u2019t you elves?\u201d Henrick asked. Shaneth nudged his side with her elbow. Henrick groaned before he looked at the village chief and smiled awkwardly.\u201cWe now live in a world where showing kindness is a sin. However, we do not regret what we did. Our beliefs are strong enough not to crumble just because of the evil those men did to us,\u201d the village chief said.A small elf girl came and nudged Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s knee. She placed a crown made of flowers on his head when he bent down to the girl\u2019s height. She said, \u201cHere, take this.\u201d\u201cThank you,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied. The girl blushed and hid behind her mother when she heard Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s low voice.Shaneth was surprised when she saw the flower crown. She asked, \u201cOh my, how did you manage to make a flower crown in the desert?\u201d\u201cWe are working on restoring the desert into a forest,\u201d the village chief responded proudly. He added, \u201cThis is a flower bred to be able to grow in the desert. We call it a desert flower. There are not many of them yet, but we are slowly increasing their numbers.\u201d\u201cTo think that the desert could be restored into a forest. Is that even possible?\u201d Shaneth asked.\u201cThey say that the vast Desert of Death was once a lush forest in ancient times. I believe nothing is impossible,\u201d the village chief said.The Fire Trolls in the back suddenly faked coughs as if they were asking for attention as well. The village chief laughed and said, \u201cOh my, I seemed to have forgotten to ask you. What brings you to our village?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re out of water! Do you mind giving us some?!\u201d the Fire Trolls asked.\u201cOf course; you are our saviors, after all. We will provide for you abundantly,\u201d the village chief said, easily agreeing to their request.Kang Yoon-Soo suddenly added, \u201cThat\u2019s not all.\u201d\u201cWhat else is there that we can help you with? Just tell us anything you need,\u201d the village chief said.\u201cWe have to mobilize all of the Fire Trolls and elves who live in the Desert of Death,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.The village chief was surprised; so were the others surrounding them. The village chief asked, \u201cAnd why is that so?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s an enemy we have to ambush,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.The elves\u2019 expression immediately changed when they heard the word \u2018ambush\u2019, and a few of them seemed to be on their guard. The village chief said coldly, \u201cWe do not enjoy partaking in wars.\u201d\u201cYou have to this time,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.\u201cAnd what if we refuse?\u201d the village chief asked.Kang Yoon-Soo answered from experience. \u201cThe continent will be destroyed.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The Fire Trolls dug up and brought over soil suitable for plants to grow, and the elves transplanted the seedlings.\u201cIt\u2019s strange seeing how elves and trolls are getting along so well. It feels as if we have to cause a rift between them to restore the balance of nature or something, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d Henrick remarked while sitting on a wooden table.Shaneth said as she sat beside him, \u201cNot at all. I don\u2019t think the elves would like what you said just now.\u201d\u201cWhy do you sound as if you\u2019ve lived with the elves before?\u201d Henrick replied mockingly.\u201cThe person who took me in and raised me when I lost my family to the fire was an elf. Although she had a different vibe than the elves over here,\u201d Shaneth explained.\u201cWell, I know a few elves from the pub and they\u2019re completely different from these ones. Although they acted like free spirits and didn\u2019t feel like elves at all,\u201d Henrick said.\u201cFeel like elves?\u201d Shaneth asked.\u201cYou know, attuned to nature, mysterious, innocent, that kind of feeling?\u201d Henrick replied.\u201cHmm\u2026 Lady Hermia told me long ago that the elves were divided into those who stayed in the desert and those who began roaming the continent. The elves in the Desert of Death are the elves who fit the stereotype and the ones roaming around the continent are the free-spirited ones,\u201d Shaneth explained.Iris suddenly approached them, seemingly sulking about something.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, unni?\u201d Shaneth asked.\u201cThere is no barley bread in this place,\u201d Iris said.\u201cJust eat whatever they give you, please,\u201d Henrick said. Shaneth stabbed her elbow into Henrick\u2019s side, and he let out a pained moan as he grimaced. Henrick asked, \u201cWhy does it feel like you\u2019re getting stronger day by day? Do you realize that?\u201dShaneth pretended she couldn\u2019t hear the middle-aged man as she stared at the large tent. She said, \u201cI wonder what Kang Yoon-Soo is doing.\u201d\u201cWhy are you asking as if you don\u2019t know the guy? If it\u2019s him, he\u2019s probably doing one of these three things: Being weird, scamming people, or drinking. Come to think of it, all of those are things a thug would do\u2026\u201d Henrick trailed off.\u201cI believe Kang Yoon-Soo is doing a good job convincing him,\u201d Iris said.***\u201cWhat are you drinking?! Give me some!\u201d Yanak exclaimed.\u201cIt\u2019s water,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied, tricking the poor Fire Troll while sipping alcohol.The elven village chief, Yanak, and Kang Yoon-Soo were seated inside the tent.\u201cI cannot agree to a war. Why do you think we are trying to restore the desert into a forest?\u201d the village chief asked.Kang Yoon-Soo shook his head and said, \u201cIf we don\u2019t wage this war, everything will be destroyed. Including the forest you guys are dreaming of.\u201d\u201cWho is our enemy then?\u201d the village chief asked.\u201cThe Ancient King, Kartheon. He surpassed time and came back to life,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo explained.The conversation suddenly took a serious turn. Nobody who lived in the Desert of Death did not know about the legend of Kartheon. He was a ruthless ruler who had ruled over the ancient kingdom of Sharshyanon. To think a person like him had come back to life!\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d the village chief asked.Kang Yoon-Soo stabbed the Sword of Revelation into the table and said, \u201cThe goddess has given me a revelation.\u201d\u201cLies. Goddess Sylphia would never allow a war to break out,\u201d the village chief said, denying Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s words.However, Yanak suddenly stood up and cried, \u201cHeron! He is the groom of the goddess!\u201d\u201cGroom of the goddess?\u201d the village chief, who was called Heron, asked with a puzzled expression.The groom of the goddess chosen by the high priest would occasionally receive a revelation from the goddess. Such revelations were mostly provided to prevent calamities from destroying the continent or to prophesize things that would happen in the future.\u201cThere is some credibility if you are indeed the groom of the goddess\u2026\u201d Heron said. He sighed and indicated he was at least willing to listen to the full story. He asked, \u201cWhat is the aim of Kartheon, the ancient king?\u201d\u201cTo destroy the continent so he can regress back in time,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.\u201cRegress? Are you saying he will destroy the continent just to go back in time?\u201d Heron asked in surprise. He and Yanak could not hide their surprise, as they stared at Kang Yoon-Soo with their mouths agape.\u201cThe ancient king, Kartheon, has the ability to control time,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.The two, who had already been surprised to begin with, felt as if they had been hit in the back of their heads due to the words Kang Yoon-Soo had just spoken.Yanak could not hide his shock and exclaimed loudly, \u201cControl time?! What do you mean by that?!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s as I said. Kartheon obtains more temporal power whenever he kills the living, and he obtains more of it the stronger the being he kills is. His aim is to extinguish all life in the continent to give him enough power to regress back in time,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.\u201cThen does that mean Kartheon can turn back time?\u201d Heron asked.\u201cHe has to sacrifice a lot to do that, but he can also stop time,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.Yanak and Heron stared at each other with dumbfounded expressions. To think they were up against a king who could control time. Who could stop an opponent like that if they were after the destruction of the continent?\u201cThen are you saying we have to wage war to stop Kartheon from destroying the continent?\u201d Heron asked.Kang Yoon-Soo nodded. Heron fell into a deep dilemma as he cupped his chin. He finally said, \u201cIf the ancient king who can control time has awoken\u2026 Can we even stop someone like that? Would it not be better to surrender and try to convince him otherwise?\u201d\u201cHeron! What are you talking about?! We have to fight him even if we have to put our lives on the line!\u201d Yanak roared.\u201cBut Kartheon can turn back time. Even if we manage to destroy his army, he will simply turn back time to a day before, pinpoint our location, and hit us before we know he is coming, right?\u201d Heron retorted.Yanak could not refute Heron\u2019s reasoning, so he kept his mouth closed. Even the Fire Troll knew that no tactics would work against the power to control time.Then, Kang Yoon-Soo suddenly said, \u201cNo, Kartheon hasn\u2019t obtained enough power to turn back that much time. The best he can do as of now is to turn it back by thirty or forty seconds. Also, he won\u2019t be able to turn back the same moment after he\u2019s turned it back once.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d Heron asked.\u201cHis body has deteriorated over the centuries that passed while he waited to be resurrected, and Kartheon will be able to turn back more time as he slowly recovers his powers. That\u2019s why we have to cooperate and ambush him before he fully recovers his powers,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.Heron could not hide his skepticism. He further inquired, \u201cWhat if he stops time? Then won\u2019t we have no way to win against him?\u201d\u201cKartheon won\u2019t stop time. He knows what side effects he\u2019ll suffer if he stops time better than anyone else,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.\u201cThe goddess seems to have given you a lot of detailed revelations,\u201d Heron said, looking suspiciously at Kang Yoon-Soo. The man knew too much to call it a revelation.Kang Yoon-Soo ignored Heron\u2019s skeptical gaze and continued, \u201cWhatever the reason may be, we can\u2019t afford to waste a second. We have to mobilize all the elves and trolls in the Desert of Death and form an army as soon as possible.\u201d\u201cIt is not as easy as it sounds. Let us say that we do manage to mobilize all of those troops. Then who will lead them?\u201d Heron asked.\u201cI will,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied. Heron frowned.Then, a female elf entered the tent and said, \u201cChief, we have received a message from the Silver Flower Village to the northwest of here!\u201dHeron received the letter; it was eerily covered with spots of blood. He read the bloody letter. His face turned pale and he said, \u201cThe elf village northwest of here has been destroyed. This was a letter sent by the village chief, who managed to escape.\u201d\u201cDestroyed?! By whom?!\u201d Yanak roared.\u201cHe says they were overrun by thousands of mummies. They didn\u2019t spare a single one of the villagers and indiscriminately murdered even women and children. Also, they seemed to have called the one who seemed to be their leader \u2018Your Majesty\u2019,\u201d Heron said.\u201cKartheon!\u201d Yanak raged, gritting his fangs.A sense of urgency filled the tent; Kang Yoon-Soo was the first one to speak. He said, \u201cWe don\u2019t have much time. We have to mobilize our forces and face Kartheon head-on.\u201d\u201cAlright. I cannot fully trust your words, but I have no choice but to believe you because this just happened. I know it is an unavoidable fight and we have to stop him before he creates more victims,\u201d Heron said. He continued, \u201cI will send a message to all of the elf villages explaining the situation. I will send it through the fastest method we have so we will be able to mobilize in four days.\u201d\u201cThe Fire Trolls will gather immediately! No trolls will just stand by and watch while our elven friends are being killed!\u201d Yanak roared.Kang Yoon-Soo nodded and said, \u201cAlright, we have to prioritize mobilizing our forces first. I need the two of you to put that before anything else.\u201dKang Yoon-Soo then left the tent. Shaneth was the first to approach him; she asked, \u201cHow did it go?\u201d\u201cPrepare for war,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.Shaneth gulped nervously. Henrick suddenly turned serious as he asked, \u201cTell me, are you confident in winning this just like you always have?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.\u201cWhat?\u201d Henrick grimaced in response. He continued, \u201cYou! Don\u2019t tell me\u2026 You started a war we can\u2019t win?\u201dKang Yoon-Soo pondered for a bit before he replied, \u201cOur opponent this time is a bit difficult to deal with.\u201d\u201cHow so?\u201d Henrick asked.\u201cI won\u2019t remember it even if I kill him,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Henrick asked with a perplexed expression.\u201cThe enemy can control time,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said. Henrick looked dumbfounded for a minute.Iris, who had been drawing barley bread in the sand, suddenly called out, \u201cKang Yoon-Soo.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo asked.\u201cWill we survive this?\u201d Iris asked.\u201cNone of you will die,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo responded confidently.\u201cWhat about Kang Yoon-Soo?\u201d Iris asked.Kang Yoon-Soo stared at her for a moment before responding, \u201cI\u2019ll survive.\u201d\u201cThen that is fine,\u201d Iris said with a smile.Kang Yoon-Soo started to walk toward somewhere. Shaneth asked, \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d\u201cTo find a new weapon,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.\u201cBut that way is going out of the village,\u201d Shaneth said.\u201cI know,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied as he walked out of the village. He stretched out his hand and muttered, \u201cSummon White.\u201d\u201cRawwwrrr!\u201dThe silver werewolf appeared. Kang Yoon-Soo mounted White and commanded, \u201cRun.\u201d\u201cKarugor!\u201dWhite ran swiftly across the vast desert. They reached a black cave after zigzagging across the desert in a complicated path. There was a statue of a warrior guarding the cave. It suddenly moved when Kang Yoon-Soo tried to enter.\u201cHalt! This is the resting place of Nahilen the Venerable Archer,\u201d the statue said.\u201cI know,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.\u201cThe road here is filled with traps and unending sandstorms, but I expect the fact that you have reached this place safely means you have solved the nine riddles of the Desert of Death,\u201d the statue said.\u201cYes,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.\u201cAmazing! I like wise people. I will kill the sculptor who carved me in the form of a stupid warrior if I see them,\u201d the statue grumbled.It observed Kang Yoon-Soo for a moment before it drew its sword and said, \u201cYou need to have mastered at least three archery skills, but you do not possess any archery skills. You do not have the right to enter.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll make you into a wise magician,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.\u201cW-what? Are you serious? Are you saying you will sculpt me again?\u201d The warrior statue trembled in excitement.Kang Yoon-Soo nodded and said, \u201cTurn around.\u201d\u201cAlright! I never liked this heavy armor I was forced to wear,\u201d the warrior statue said, innocently turning around.Kang Yoon-Soo swung his sword with all his strength and used his skill. \u201cAbyssal Sword.\u201dKwachik!\u201cI knew it! You treasonous viper! Did you really think I would be done in by such a weak attack?!\u201d the warrior statue exclaimed as he grabbed Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s sword.However, Kang Yoon-Soo was not fazed at all, saying, \u201cLook.\u201dThe statue glanced sideways at the wall of the cave, which had been partly destroyed by Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s attack. It saw a staff and a robe carved out of stone hidden within the cave wall.\u201cWhat is this?\u201d the statue asked.\u201cNahilen, who made you, knew you very well. That\u2019s why he intentionally hid a staff and robe carved out of stone hidden near the entrance, in case a friend of his who didn\u2019t have any archery skills came to this place,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo explained.\u201cAmazing!\u201d the warrior statue exclaimed; it was completely absorbed by, and fully focused on, the staff and robe.Kang Yoon-Soo leisurely walked into the cave. The interior was filled with bows, arrows, and various artworks.\u2018That\u2019s the weapon I need.\u2019A burning crossbow was at the end of the cave; Kang Yoon-Soo went over and grabbed it. It was a unique kind of crossbow that would load itself with a bolt made of fire.\u2018Kartheon hated this crossbow.\u2019It was the most suitable weapon to kill the ancient king.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The women ran away with their children, while the men sacrificed themselves to secure an escape route for them. They all had tears in their eyes.\u201cWait.\u201d A large shadow blocked their path.At that moment, the elves were about to scream, thinking it was an enemy. However, the shadow suddenly exclaimed, \u201cShh!\u201dKatz motioned toward the elves to keep quiet, putting his finger up to his lips. An elf who was holding her baby looked at him with a fear-stricken expression.\u201cYou can\u2019t go this way. The mummies have set up an encirclement over the hills. Run northeast. That\u2019s the only place they haven\u2019t surrounded yet,\u201d Katz said.\u201cT-thank you! Thank you very much!\u201d the elf exclaimed.\u201cDon\u2019t mention it; just be careful not to wake the baby up,\u201d Katz said.The elf women bowed their heads and continued running away. Katz waved his hand before he turned around and looked at the burning elven village.\u2018He has no mercy.\u2019 Katz had not lived a \u2018kind\u2019 life as a graverobber, but he had never gotten any experience committing murder.The air was filled with the stench of blood. Kartheon had set fire to the village, as if slaughtering all of its inhabitants was not enough.Katz clenched his fist and thought, \u2018He really intends to kill everything on the continent.\u2019He walked toward the village. The mummies in the village walked around like zombies from a low-budget film as they searched for any survivors. Meanwhile, Kartheon was looking down at the village from the highest vantage point.\u201cAigoo, why is it so hard to take a dump in the desert?\u201d Katz exclaimed as he scratched his butt.Kartheon glanced at him and asked, \u201cWhy did you let them live?\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about, Your Majesty?\u201d Katz replied, feigning ignorance.Kartheon grabbed him by the neck and asked once again, \u201cI asked you, why did you let those elves go?\u201d\u201cKeheok! Keok! Because I pity them, Sire\u2026\u201d Katz replied.It felt as if Kartheon\u2019s dried, withered hand that was grabbing Katz by the neck had begun slowly draining his life force. Katz squirmed and tried to pry the hand away, but Kartheon\u2019s hand did not budge an inch.\u201cA lowly graverobber like you dares to disturb the great cause?\u201d Kartheon exclaimed.\u201cKeuuheoooook!\u201d Katz screamed as his vision started to blur, but he suddenly felt enraged. He thought he should at least say whatever he wanted to say to the mummy if he was going to die anyway. He retorted, \u201cT-then what about you\u2026? Why aren\u2019t you aware of the fact even a lowly graverobber like me is aware of\u2026?\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Kartheon asked.\u201cThat\u2026 Kuheok\u2026! You\u2019re doing something\u2026 very stupid\u2026!\u201d Katz spluttered as he struggled to gasp for air.Kartheon threw Katz away; Katz rolled across the sandy ground. His vision, which had begun to blur while he was being choked, slowly started to return.\u201cTry barking again,\u201d Kartheon said.\u201cWhy did you kill the elves\u2026?\u201d Katz asked.\u201cThe elves are an excellent offering to gain temporal power,\u201d Kartheon replied.Kartheon gained more temporal power the stronger the creature he killed was or the longer they had lived; the elves, who had much longer lifespans than most creatures on the continent, were an excellent source of temporal power.Katz retorted, \u201c\u2018Everything will be gone once I regress so I can live however I want\u2019. Is that what you\u2019re thinking?\u201d\u201cIs that not the case?\u201d Kartheon responded with a shrug.\u201cIt\u2019s going to stay in your mind!\u201d Katz retorted. He was actually racking his brains for anything he could think of at the moment as he continued, \u201cDo you really think this world will disappear once you regress back in time? Not at all! This world will stay in your mind forever. It\u2019ll come back to haunt you one day and make you paranoid!\u201d\u201cDo not make me laugh with your illogical claims. Katz, have you ever experienced regressing?\u201d Kartheon asked.\u201cT-that\u2019s not what I meant\u2026\u201d Katz stuttered, as he could not find any response to Kartheon\u2019s question.Kartheon opened and closed his right hand that could absorb life from another and said, \u201cThose kinds of words would only be convincing if they were said by someone who has experienced regressing. If someone who has actually experienced regression comes and tells me those things, perhaps I will consider it at least once. Of course, there is no way that could be possible.\u201d He then mounted his camel. Katz hesitated for a moment before mounting his own camel as well and following behind the ancient king.Kartheon smirked and asked, \u201cWhy are you still following me after experiencing that humiliation just now?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t just stand around and watch as you destroy the continent,\u201d Katz said.Katz forgot to properly address Kartheon as \u2018Your Majesty\u2019 in the heat of the moment, but Kartheon did not seem to mind it at all. In fact, he seemed to enjoy the situation, as he openly mocked Katz again. \u201cDid the graverobber who only knew to steal from the dead suddenly end up filled with a sense of justice?\u201dKatz shut his mouth and swallowed his anger. He thought for a while before he said, \u201cI\u2019m a graverobber. It\u2019s my job to steal the belongings of the dead. Do you think a guy like me won\u2019t be able to change the mind of the dead?\u201d\u201cYou will not be able to,\u201d Kartheon said sharply.\u201c\u2026You\u2019re really a cutthroat person,\u201d Katz muttered.\u201cThat is why I am a king, and I have the right to sit on the throne,\u201d Kartheon replied.The two men walked away with the burning village behind them; thousands of mummies trailed in their wake. Soon, the desert sky turned dark, but not a single star was in sight. The desert at night was quite silent and peaceful.\u201cIt is going to take quite a while for us to reach the next village,\u201d Kartheon grumbled.Katz asked carefully, \u201cYour Majesty can stop time while we travel, right?\u201d\u201cStopping time consumes my life force,\u201d Kartheon replied.\u201cReally?\u201d Katz asked.Kartheon easily admitted it, saying,, \u201cStopping time for even one or two seconds has severe drawbacks.\u201d\u201cThen, Your Majesty probably won\u2019t be stopping time at all?\u201d Katz continued.\u201cI have only stopped time twice in my entire life,\u201d Kartheon said.Katz thought he needed to change the atmosphere. He had already forgotten about his anger as he asked out of pure curiosity, \u201cWhen were those two times you stopped time?\u201d\u201cThe first was when my body was about to be split in half by the jaws of the Dragon of Destruction,\u201d Kartheon said.\u201cDragon of Destruction?\u201d Katz asked.\u201cIt was a dragon from ancient times. It was strong enough to almost destroy the continent, and considering its long lifespan\u2026 It could still be alive\u2026\u201d Kartheon said.Katz was stricken with fear at the mention of the word \u2018dragon\u2019. He could not fathom the stories of such powerful beings. He asked hesitantly, \u201cYour Majesty fought against such a strong dragon\u2026?\u201d\u201cCorrect. I almost died in the end, though. My life would have been over the moment that big jaw bit and tore me in half. I was nearly out of temporal power, and I had no choice but to stop time,\u201d Kartheon said.\u201cWhat was it like?\u201d Katz asked curiously.\u201cThere was no time in which to experience anything. My body took so much damage that it was about to break apart while I stopped time, but I managed to narrowly escape from the dragon\u2019s jaws thanks to that. However, I was bedridden for days afterward,\u201d Kartheon explained.It seemed stopping time was much more strenuous than Katz had initially thought. However, he asked, \u201cThen when was the second time you stopped time, Your Majesty?\u201d\u201cThe second time was when I saw the most beautiful comet in the world,\u201d Kartheon answered.\u2018A comet?\u2019 Katz thought. It was quite unexpected. He tilted his head in confusion as he asked, \u201cA comet, Your Majesty?\u201d\u201cIndeed, a comet,\u201d Kartheon replied as he looked at the night sky. The desert sky had become filled with stars.\u201cI was walking in the plains alone one day, when the sun set and night came. I looked up to the sky and saw a comet passing by. I tried to make a wish, but it went by too fast. That was why I stopped time,\u201d Kartheon explained.\u201cYou used such a risky ability just for that\u2026?\u201d Katz asked. Kartheon glared at him, and Katz felt the hairs at the back of his neck stand up. He quickly shut his mouth.The ancient king\u2019s story continued. He said as he reminisced, \u201cEverything stopped at that moment, down to the small cries of the bugs, and even the wind that tickled the tip of my nose. Only I was able to move in that moment when time stopped.\u201dKartheon\u2019s face was heavily withered, so it was hard to tell what kind of expression he was making, but Katz could tell that the ancient king was feeling nostalgic and greatly missed that moment.\u201cAlthough it was short, it was the most valuable experience of my life,\u201d Kartheon said.\u201cForgive me for asking, but what did Your Majesty wish for?\u201d Katz asked carefully.Kartheon let out a laugh and smiled as he said, \u201cI wished to be a benevolent ruler.\u201dKatz wondered for a moment who Kartheon was confused about what a \u2018benevolent ruler\u2019 actually meant. A benevolent ruler was a ruler who treated their citizens and subjects with benevolence and mercy.He could not hold back as his mouth moved by itself. He asked, \u201cThen why did you, who wished to be a benevolent ruler, kill those elves?\u201d\u201cDid you not say it yourself? Everything will disappear if I regress. My sins, their deaths, everything will be back to how it was before,\u201d Kartheon nonchalantly said with a shrug. Katz felt goosebumps all over his body upon hearing the ancient king\u2019s words.Only after a long while of riding did Kartheon suddenly stop his camel. He got off it and said, \u201cLet us rest for a bit.\u201dKartheon\u2019s stamina was as feeble as his skinny, withered appearance implied. The whole mummy army stopped as well whenever Kartheon stopped to rest, burying themselves in the sand. A nearby stone mountain looked like an excellent spot for them to spend the night and camp.\u201cI\u2019ll light the fire, Your Majesty,\u201d Katz said.In truth, while Katz had been volunteering to stand watch while they camped ever since the first night, he had been looking for an opportunity to kill Kartheon while he slept. However, Kartheon always closed his eyes and rested, but he never fell asleep.\u201cI was assassinated in my previous life while I was asleep,\u201d Kartheon said as if he could read what was on Katz\u2019s mind.Katz flinched for a moment and tried to remain calm as he put a piece of dried camel dung into the fire. Camel\u2019s dung was an excellent material to burn in the desert, where firewood was precious and hard to come by.\u201cAt the hands of that guy, Sirian?\u201d Katz asked.\u201cCorrect,\u201d Kartheon replied.Katz felt he had heard about the man called \u2018Sirian\u2019 before. Had he heard the name from the Continentals? He could not clearly remember, because he did not interact much with Continentals.\u201cThe fire is burning pretty well today,\u201d Katz said, trying to lighten the mood. He wanted to stop Kartheon\u2019s evil deeds, and he needed to be much closer to the ancient king if he wanted to achieve that.\u201cI see,\u201d Kartheon muttered.The campfire blazed as it shone brightly beneath the stone mountain. It had become even more visible in the pitch-black night.Kartheon suddenly asked, \u201cThat graverobber I killed. Was he your friend?\u201dKatz tried to jog his memories before asking, \u201cAh, you mean Hudderson?\u201d\u201cYes, that graverobber who woke me up together with you at the burial site,\u201d Kartheon replied.\u201cI worked with him, but we weren\u2019t that close. It\u2019s not that strange in our line of work,\u201d Katz replied as he recalled the death of his comrade.Hudderson\u2019s death had left a bitter taste in his mouth. They had felt that they hit the jackpot and could live without any worries when they found the pile of gems at the burial site.Katz suddenly decided to ask the ancient king, \u201cWhy? Did Your Majesty suddenly feel pity for me?\u201d\u201cNo, I am just amazed when I look at you,\u201d Kartheon replied.\u201cWhat do you mean, Your Majesty?\u201d Katz asked.\u201cYou seem to forget about death quite easily,\u201d Kartheon said.\u201cBeing a graverobber is a job that\u2019s always at death\u2019s doorstep. Ah, can you guess what my job was back in my world, Your Majesty?\u201d Katz asked. Kartheon shook his head.\u201cI was a petty thief. I was really dirt poor. I stole other people\u2019s food because I felt I would die of hunger. People would leave the favorite foods of their deceased loved ones at the tombs in the country I came from back in my world, and I had no qualms stealing that food as well,\u201d Katz explained.\u201cI see that your habit of stealing from the dead has not changed even in this world,\u201d Kartheon said.\u201cOh\u2026 I guess so, now that you mention it, Your Majesty,\u201d Katz replied. He scratched his head in embarrassment.Time quickly flew by as they chatted. Soon, Katz covered himself with a blanket and slowly nodded off to sleep.\u2018The stars have changed,\u2019 Kartheon said to himself as he gazed at the night sky. Everything was different from his memories. That was why he needed to go back.\u2018I should go to the Rock Desert as soon as the sun rises to wake up the sleeping giant,\u2019 he thought.Suddenly\u2026Shhhhh\u2026 Ping!Something lodged itself in the back of Kartheon\u2019s right hand\u2014it was a burning bolt. The ancient king was not fazed at all. He smirked as he thought, \u2018I did not sense it at all. It is a skilled assassin for sure.\u2019Kartheon stood up as he tried to pull the bolt out of his right hand. However, another bolt flew toward his temple. He quickly ducked and avoided the bolt.\u2018Someone is after me,\u2019 he thought. He lowered his posture and looked around his surroundings. There was nothing but the silent darkness; perhaps it was because the assassin was quite skilled at camouflage.He thought with some annoyance, \u2018If only my level had not decreased because of the resurrection. This kind of assassination attempt would have meant nothing.\u2019He then suddenly felt something hot approaching him from behind.Pukeok!A bolt lodged itself in the back of Kartheon\u2019s head, and he stumbled. His skull broke open, and the heat from the bolt melted his skin.\u2018I have to see who was after me,\u2019 the ancient king thought. He was at death\u2019s door, but he seemed to be quite composed. No matter how perilous the situation was for him, all he had to do was turn back time.Thus, Kartheon turned back time.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was exactly seventeen seconds, and so he turned back time by exactly seventeen seconds.Whiiiing\u2026! Pukeok!The bolt that had been embedded in the back of his head slowly pulled itself out, and Kartheon regained his balance, observing the surroundings. A fiery bolt grazed past the ancient king\u2019s temple in reverse, and he slowly sat down in place as the bolt in his hand pulled itself out and slowly flew backward.Whiiing\u2026![You have turned back time by 17 seconds.][You have used some of your temporal power.]Piiing!Kartheon moved his hand and avoided the bolt that flew toward it. He then picked up a stone and threw it at the bolt that was flying toward his temple.Kwachik!The stone collided with the bolt, shattering it into pieces. Kartheon slowly stood up and called out, \u201cIs it not frustrating just hiding and shooting from the dark?\u201dA bolt flew toward the ancient king\u2019s head, but Kartheon easily grabbed it and stopped it inches away from his face. His withered hands grabbed the bolt, and the flames engulfing it were quickly extinguished.\u201cCome here. Let us have a chat,\u201d Kartheon said as he drew the sword on Katz\u2019s waist.Seventeen seconds had passed. Kartheon slowly started counting once again.\u201cAigoo\u2026 Hehe\u2026 Stop tickling my waist, you cute little kitten.\u201d Katz muttered nonsense as he tossed and turned in his sleep.Kartheon walked into the darkness. He said playfully, \u201cI will come to you if you do not want to come to me.\u201dA bolt flew toward the ancient king as soon as he finished speaking, but Kartheon swung the sword in his hand and easily cut down the bolt.\u2018There\u2019s only one enemy,\u2019 he thought. Multiple assailants would have shot him from multiple angles at once, but the bolts were only coming one at a time. Kartheon had no reason to retreat or hesitate if there was only one assassin. As such, he walked slowly in the direction the bolt had been shot from.Sukeok! Pukeok! Kwachik!The ancient king easily cut down three fiery bolts that flew at him. It was only logical for a marksman to be flustered the closer their target came toward them. Kartheon could see a shadow holding a crossbow a short distance away from him.Kwachik!Kartheon quickly swung his sword downward. The ancient king could not see clearly due to the darkness, but he felt that he had only managed to graze the assassin\u2019s hair.Then, the assassin suddenly attacked with a sword, stabbing it into the ancient king\u2019s cheek.\u201cKuheok!\u201d Kartheon exclaimed in pain. He could tell that the assassin was highly skilled based on the way their sword moved.\u2018How could he master both marksmanship and swordsmanship?\u2019 Kartheon thought, surprised.The assassin pulled his sword out of Kartheon\u2019s cheek and stabbed the ancient king in the face once again.Pukeok!Kartheon\u2019s teeth were smashed and he collapsed backward. The assassin\u2019s sword was about to stab him dead center between the eyes, but he focused his mind.The space around them slowly started to change\u2026[You have turned back time by 24 seconds.][You have used some of your temporal power.]***\u201cAigoo\u2026 Hehe\u2026 Stop tickling my waist, you cute little kitten.\u201d Katz muttered nonsense as he tossed and turned in his sleep.Kartheon breathed heavily. It was just a short span of time, but things had still been dangerous. He would have already been dead if he had been late in turning back time by even a second.\u2018There is no rule that a marksman can\u2019t be skilled with the sword,\u2019 Kartheon thought. He admitted to himself that he had been overconfident because of the fact that there was only one assassin and the fact that he could control time. The ancient king threw Katz\u2019s sword aside, thinking, \u2018I shouldn\u2019t give this rat time to use his sword. I have to grab him with my right hand and kill him instantly.\u2019Kartheon walked into the darkness, and he saw a flickering flame in the distance. He ducked and avoided the fiery bolt that flew toward him. He thought, \u2018I already know which direction he\u2019s going to shoot from.\u2019 He easily avoided the three successive bolts that flew consecutively at him.He saw the shadow of the assassin carrying a crossbow. The shadow immediately threw his crossbow aside and tried to draw his sword.\u2018Fool!\u2019 Kartheon thought. He had already predicted the assassin\u2019s move, and he extended his right hand toward the assassin\u2019s neck. He had to grab the assassin by the neck to be able to instantly kill him.However, the assassin suddenly grabbed his right hand and twisted it.\u2018Martial arts?\u2019 Kartheon was inwardly surprised.The move the assassin had just performed was not an ordinary move, but it was similar to the skills shown by martial arts experts. They easily snapped Kartheon\u2019s right hand.Clack!The assassin did not simply twist the ancient king\u2019s hand, but rather twisted it precisely at its weakest point; it was clear that they had a great understanding of human skeletal structure.The ancient king\u2019s dry, withered bones broke and his right hand was crushed. Kartheon could not believe his eyes. He thought, \u2018This is not the level of martial arts one would learn for self-defense in case the enemy engaged in a melee. This is the skill of someone who has trained for at least twenty years.\u2019The assassin threw Kartheon down to the ground and mercilessly pummeled him. The ancient king\u2019s collarbone and four of his ribs were shattered by the assassin\u2019s merciless pounding.Kartheon was more taken aback than in pain. He said, \u201cI see that you are skilled in marksmanship, swordsmanship, and martial arts.\u201dThe assassin responded to the ancient king\u2019s praises by digging both of his thumbs into Kartheon\u2019s eye sockets and digging the ancient king\u2019s eyes out.Kartheon was struck with shock and horror by the assassin\u2019s mercilessness as his vision slowly blurred, and then he lost his sight.[You have turned back time by 37 seconds.][You have used some of your temporal power.]***\u201cAigoo\u2026 Hehe\u2026 Stop tickling my waist, you cute little kitten.\u201d Katz muttered nonsense as he tossed and turned in his sleep.The ancient king\u2019s crushed right hand and eyeballs had returned to normal after he turned back time. However, Kartheon was severely annoyed. He thought, \u2018To think a lowly assassin would make me turn back time three times. No matter how much I have deteriorated, I can tell that he is not an ordinary assassin.\u2019The ancient king wanted to know the identity of the assassin shrouded in darkness. As such, he tore off a piece of cloth and threw it into the campfire. As he walked into the darkness, he thought, \u2018I should aim to expose that guy\u2019s identity instead of aiming to kill him.\u2019The assassin kicked Kartheon as soon as the ancient king avoided the bolt flying toward him. Kartheon was utterly defeated, lying on the ground as he exclaimed, \u201cShow yourself!\u201dSuddenly, the ancient king threw the burning cloth outward, causing the darkness to recede for a split second. It lasted only a short time, but it was more than enough for Kartheon to see the identity of his assailant. The assassin was a man in his twenties; he was a Traveler judging by the device on his wrist. The assassin\u2019s face was void of any emotion, as if he were a doll.\u201cI will remember your face,\u201d Kartheon said.The expressionless assassin pointed his crossbow at the ancient king and said, \u201cGo back to the past.\u201dPing!A bolt hit the ancient king dead center in the face. It was at the very moment that Kartheon\u2019s brain was about to cease functioning that he turned back time.[You have turned back time by 32 seconds.][You have used some of your temporal power.][You have turned back time four times in a short period of time.][Your body has received a small amount of damage.]***\u201cAigoo\u2026 Hehe\u2026 Stop tickling my waist, you cute little kitten.\u201d Katz muttered nonsense as he tossed and turned in his sleep.Kartheon roared out loud, \u201cYou know I can control time! I have turned back time four times now! How many times do you want me to turn back time for you to be satisfied?!\u201dKartheon did not expect any reply, but the expressionless man suddenly emerged from the darkness. He put away his crossbow and pulled his sword out, saying, \u201c999 times.\u201d\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Kartheon asked in surprise.\u201cI regressed that many times too,\u201d the expressionless man said.Kartheon snapped angrily at the man, \u201cWhat the hell are you?\u201d\u201cNone of your business,\u201d the expressionless man said as he stabbed his sword into Kartheon\u2019s face. Not a single drop of blood was spilled as the sword penetrated through the ancient king\u2019s skull.[You have turned back time by 27 seconds.][You have used some of your temporal power.][You have turned back time five times in a short period of time.][Your body has received a small amount of damage.]***\u201cAigoo\u2026 Hehe\u2026 Stop tickling my waist, you cute little kitten.\u201d Katz muttered nonsense as he tossed and turned in his sleep.Kartheon thought for a moment before shouting, \u201cYou know I can control time! I have turned back time five times now! How many times do you want me to turn back time for you to be satisfied?!\u201dThe expressionless man suddenly emerged from the darkness. He put away his crossbow and pulled his sword out, saying, \u201c999 times.\u201dThe man\u2019s sword immediately thrust out at Kartheon, but Kartheon already knew the trajectory of the sword, and he got up and avoided the attack. The ancient king moved his left hand simultaneously, countering the blow with Katz\u2019s sword.Clang!It was supposed to be an attack that was impossible to defend against, but the man easily parried the ancient king\u2019s attack by quickly reading his moves.Kartheon\u2019s right hand shot out and\u2026Grasp!The ancient king\u2019s right hand successfully grabbed the man by the neck. The man\u2019s life force was going to be absorbed and he would soon turn into dust.However, tough leather had been wrapped around the man\u2019s neck, preventing Kartheon from using his ability as it required direct contact with his target.\u201cSo you have prepared for this as well,\u201d Kartheon grumbled as he bit his barely intact lips.The man swung his sword, and the ancient king\u2019s neck was sliced apart cleanly.[You have turned back time by 34 seconds.][You have used some of your temporal power.][You have turned back time six times in a short period of time.][Your body has received a small amount of damage.]***\u201cAigoo\u2026 Hehe\u2026 Stop tickling my waist, you cute little kitten.\u201d Katz muttered nonsense as he tossed and turned in his sleep.Kartheon called out to the assassin the same way he had previously.The expressionless man said, \u201c999 times.\u201dThe ancient king changed the trajectory of his counter this time. He aimed for the leather wrapped around the man\u2019s neck instead of trying to inflict damage directly, thinking, \u2018I have to tear apart the leather wrapped around his neck and kill him instantly.\u2019The tip of Katz\u2019s sword reached the leather wrapped around the man\u2019s neck. The ancient king swung down with all his might. However, the leather actually managed to block the sword, and the blade bounced away from it. Kartheon grimaced.The expressionless man suddenly said, \u201cThis leather can\u2019t be cut.\u201d\u201c\u2026I am getting sick and tired of this,\u201d Kartheon said.The expressionless man\u2019s sword swung down and split the ancient king in half.[You have turned back time by 39 seconds.][You have used some of your temporal power.][You have turned back time seven times in a short period of time.][Your body has received a small amount of damage.]***Kartheon finally decided to cast his pride aside, thinking, \u2018There\u2019s going to be no end to it like this, and my temporal power is being wasted as well. I have to use my troops instead of fighting myself.\u2019The ancient king waved his left hand, awakening the thousands of mummies that slept in the sand. The mummies rose from their slumber and asked, \u201cO great king, what is the matter?\u201d\u201cSomeone nearby is trying to assassinate me. Do not kill him if you catch him, and bring him to me alive,\u201d Kartheon ordered. The mummies spread out across the area at his command.Kartheon had wanted to kill the assassin himself. The fact that he had had to mobilize thousands of troops just to catch one man greatly damaged his pride. However, there was no other way aside from that, as the assassin kept finding ways to deal with the ancient king by displaying all sorts of random talents.\u2018Something is strange\u2026\u2019 Kartheon thought. He had almost died seven times in the span of a night, and it was not because he was careless. \u2018That guy precisely targeted me at this time and came after me.\u2019Kartheon could not turn back time much in his current state, as his body had not fully recovered yet, and he could turn back time by forty seconds at most. \u2018It feels as if he is trying to get rid of me in advance.\u2019It had been a while since the ancient king had struggled so much despite turning back time. Kartheon thought of the man\u2019s face. \u2018He looked young, but he had no vulnerabilities.\u2019Then, the ancient king suddenly remembered the man\u2019s words. \u2018Did he say he had regressed 999 times?\u2019Kartheon shook his head. There was no way that was possible. If what the man had said was true, it would mean he was living his 1,000th life on the continent. \u2018Anyone who has lived a thousand times would already have gone mad.\u2019Kartheon decided to take a break for the time being. The ancient king touched his limping body and thought, \u2018It is tiring to keep going back to the past\u2026\u2019***Kang Yoon-Soo quietly withdrew his crossbow in the silent darkness, and he also took off the Frost Demon Leather wrapped around his neck.\u2018He\u2019s called the mummies,\u2019 Kang Yoon-Soo thought. Kartheon was prideful and enjoyed frontal confrontations, and the fact that he had called his subordinates to deal with the matter meant that he had already set aside his pride.\u2018I might not remember it, but Kartheon must have repeatedly turned back time\u2026 and he must have suffered a lot because of me.\u2019 All Kang Yoon-Soo remembered having done was shoot a few bolts from his crossbow. Kartheon was the only one who knew what exactly Kang Yoon-Soo had done and in what way. However, if he had turned back time numerous times because of Kang Yoon-Soo, Kartheon would have realized by then that living through the same experience repeatedly could be nothing but horrible.\u2018What he suffered tonight is barely an intro.\u2019 Kang Yoon-Soo was planning to show him what real hell was in the war that was going to be waged later on. \u2018I\u2019ll definitely lead us to victory in this war.\u2019The mummies scouted the area with their slow mobility, but Kang Yoon-Soo moved while avoiding them. He climbed a steep cliff, then muttered, \u201cSummon White.\u201d\u201cGamakurwa. Romirku. Ornoro,\u201d White said as he stretched. It meant, \u2018I\u2019m confused as to whether I\u2019m a werewolf or a horse these days.\u2019\u201cYou\u2019re a werewolf,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied as he climbed onto the werewolf. White ran along the steep cliff.\u2018I have to bring her to our side no matter what if we\u2019re to win this war,\u2019 Kang Yoon-Soo thought as he lightly stretched his arms. He recalled, \u2018The life I lived as a legend and stole everything valuable on the continent\u2026\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, White felt hotter as it ran, as if it were being steamed.\u201cGorok!\u201d White roared, which meant, \u2018It\u2019s hot!\u2019Kang Yoon-Soo curtly replied, \u201cKeep going.\u201d\u201cUrnokra!\u201d White roared, running even faster.They were approaching a mountain that was emitting a great amount of steam. It was the Shariyer Volcano\u2014and it was an active volcano. The Shariyer Volcano was the reason why they felt so hot even though it was supposed to be cold at night in the desert.\u201cClimb the volcano,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.\u201cKarutorug!\u201d White roared, wincing in fear. It was not simply because of the heat; rather, the werewolf was scared because of the fact that the aura of an immensely strong being emanated from the active volcano.\u201cIt\u2019s alright,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.\u201cRadirujas?\u201d White asked, which meant, \u2018Is it really alright?\u2019Kang Yoon-Soo nodded and said, \u201cYou won\u2019t feel any pain if you die here\u2026 because you\u2019ll immediately melt.\u201d\u201cUrnokra!\u201d White roared and cursed its master. However, it did not stop climbing the volcano with its life on the line.Hot steam rose out of the cracks in the rough terrain, and molten lava flowed through in certain places.\u201cKyaruruk! Kyarururuk!\u201dMany dangerous monsters lived in the active volcano. There were large rhinoceros-like monsters with tough horns, lizards that consumed the volcano\u2019s fire, and warriors wielding fiery swords.There were also a few mysterious, immaterial creatures made of fire that chased after Kang Yoon-Soo and White. They screamed in delight, \u201cFood! Let\u2019s burn them to a crisp and eat them!\u201dKang Yoon-Soo pulled out his crossbow as he rode atop White. It was the crossbow he had found at the temple of Nahilen. The crossbow left behind by Nahilen was called the Blazing Crossbow; it had the ability to absorb the surrounding heat to materialize a fiery bolt. The Blazing Crossbow did not require a physical bolt to be loaded as long as Kang Yoon-Soo was surrounded by the blazing heat of the active volcano. As such, he continuously fired bolts against the chasing monsters.Ping! Kwachik! Pukeok!The creatures collapsed one by one after being hit in the head. The ones that had been critically hit immediately fell down, but the ones that managed to withstand the first shots charged even more intensely toward Kang Yoon-Soo and White.Kang Yoon-Soo summoned Acle.\u201cOuch! H-hot! Y-you\u2026 You! Are you crazy?! How dare you summon me in a place like this?! I\u2019m going back to the summon dimension!\u201d Acle threw a tantrum as he tried to run away. The blazing heat of the active volcano was no different from hell itself for an ice spirit like Acle.Kang Yoon-Soo took out the Frozen Crown from his backpack.\u201cT-that\u2019s!\u201d Acle exclaimed, gulping greedily.Kang Yoon-Soo threw the Frozen Crown at Acle and said, \u201cI\u2019ll lend it to you.\u201dAcle received the Frozen Crown and hurriedly put it on his head. The ice spirit suddenly let out an evil laugh and screamed, \u201cHahaha! It\u2019s my world now! Ice Storm!\u201dAn intense and frighteningly cold storm suddenly materialized out of nowhere as soon as Acle waved his hand. It devoured the flaming monsters that were following them from behind.\u201cW-what is this?!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve never felt something like this before!\u201dThe flaming monsters froze as soon as they were hit by the storm Acle had summoned. They were quite weak against the cold; they had never felt such a thing in their lives, as they had never left the active volcano since birth.Kang Yoon-Soo pulled out the Sword of Revelation and cut down the flaming monsters.Kwachik![You have killed a mysterious, immaterial creature of the Shariyer Volcano.][You have found a clue about changing into the Ancient Explorer class.][Your level has risen by 2.]Acle gathered his magic as the Frozen Crown explosively amplified his powers. Numerous icicles the size of greatswords fell from the sky as they massacred the flaming monsters; the monsters left behind their bright red cores whenever they died.\u2018It\u2019s useful material. It seems I can finally make a useful item for Sally,\u2019 Kang Yoon-Soo thought as he collected all of the flaming cores without leaving a single one behind. Then, he took the Frozen Crown off Acle\u2019s head, who had been excitedly shooting his magic off left and right while laughing like a maniac.\u201cGah! Give me my crown back!\u201d Acle raged, throwing a tantrum.Kang Yoon-Soo stored the Frozen Crown in his backpack and said, \u201cHelp me again next time.\u201d\u201cHmpf! No way!\u201d Acle said, puffing his cheeks up and disappearing into the summon dimension.White\u2019s movement started to slow down as it huffed and puffed the higher they climbed up the volcano. Every step White took felt as if it were stepping on the embers of coals, as the heat sizzled its paws.\u201cOver there,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said. He pointed at the blazing red peak of the volcano and placed a cube of ice made by Acle into the werewolf\u2019s mouth. Then, he took out a bottle of alcohol and gulped its contents down.\u201cGarocomu?\u201d White asked as it chewed the ice made by the Ice Spirit. It meant, \u2018what are you going to do over there?\u2019\u201cI\u2019m going to steal something,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.A quartz cave with lava flowing across its floor came into view as they neared the peak of the volcano. Iit was certain that anything or anyone would instantly melt if they lost their footing and fell into the river of lava.\u201cIt\u2019s a human! A human and a werewolf came here!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a man too! What will he do if the owner of the lair gets angry?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s none of our business, so pay no heed!\u201dMultiple Fire Spirits showed up at the entrance of the cave; they were Salamanders. However, as opposed to Sally, who was a little child, the Fire Spirits of the cave looked like fully grown, mature women. The Salamanders stared curiously at Kang Yoon-Soo.\u201cI want to go inside. Let me in,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.The Fire Spirits grimaced as if they found his words unpleasant.\u201cHow dare a meager creature like him think of entering the lair?\u201d\u201cOh my! This human doesn\u2019t know how to value his own life!\u201d\u201cThe fact that you stepped in here is arrogant enough! Begone at once!\u201dThe Salamanders threatened Kang Yoon-Soo, wielding fiery hammers and bows they had crafted themselves from their own bodies over a long period of time. The weapons were so powerful that a single arrow could destroy a large boulder just by hitting it.\u201cSummon Sally,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo muttered.Sally suddenly appeared out of nowhere, and the Fire Spirits drastically changed their stances as the young girl appeared.\u201cOh my, it\u2019s a young spirit?\u201d\u201cHey, cute little miss, where did you come from?\u201d\u201cI want to give a gift whenever I see small, cute children like you! What do you think of this bow?\u201dSally\u2019s eyes were wide open with shock as she exclaimed, \u201cThere are so many unnis like me!\u201dThe Fire Spirits all laughed out loud.\u201cSo you\u2019re a Summoner who\u2019s traveling with a cute spirit?\u201d\u201cWe can\u2019t kill someone who has made a contract with one of our own.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll let it slide this time and let you pass, but we\u2019ll kill you if you ever come here again.\u201dOf course, Kang Yoon-Soo was not a Summoner. A Summoner made contracts with spirits that lived deep within the embrace of nature, but Kang Yoon-Soo had not made a contract; rather, he had created a spirit by himself.\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.\u201cHing\u2026 Sally wants to play with these unnis\u2026\u201d Sally said with teary eyes, but she nonetheless walked alongside Kang Yoon-Soo.White started to growl the deeper they went inside the cave; it felt traces of a powerful being from the deepest part of the cave. Intimidated by the aura of the powerful being, it started to slow down.Kang Yoon-Soo turned around and said, \u201cIt\u2019s fine; the owner of the lair currently isn\u2019t here.\u201dThey reached a point where the path divided into multiple tunnels. Sally pointed at the left path and shouted excitedly, \u201cPapa! Papa! Look! There are so many shiny things over there!\u201dThere was a mountain of coins in the direction Sally was pointing at; various kinds of expensive-looking equipment peeked out of the mountain of gold.However, Kang Yoon-Soo shook his head and said, \u201cWe\u2019ll die if we steal that.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d Sally asked, tilting her head.\u201cThe owner of this lair placed a curse on them,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo explained.\u201cWho\u2019s the owner of this lair?\u201d Sally asked innocently.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to know,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied as he walked into the heart of the lair. The blazing heat grew stronger and the soles of his shoes slowly started to disintegrate.White stuck its tongue out and collapsed from exhaustion, growling, \u201cRamirutska\u2026\u201d\u201cPapa! Doggy collapsed!\u201d Sally exclaimed.\u201cI know,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied, returning White to the summon dimension. He tried his best to hold it in and not show it, but he was reaching his limits as well.The only one who grew more energetic as the heat grew more intense was Sally. She exclaimed, \u201cPapa! Papa! Are you tired?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.Sally looked at Kang Yoon-Soo worriedly and approached him with her blazing body, exclaiming, \u201cPapa! Papa! Sally will give you a big hug!\u201d\u201cStay away,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.\u201cW-why\u2026?\u201d Sally asked with tears in her eyes.Kang Yoon-Soo said in a low, tired voice, \u201cIt\u2019ll be hot if you come near me.\u201d\u201cWaaaah! I hate you!\u201d Sally cried out as she ran back to the summon dimension.Kang Yoon-Soo walked deeper into the cave alone. The heat reached a point where it felt as if his skin would be fried. He thought, \u2018The tips of my finger are already burnt.\u2019He was already limping from exhaustion, but he could not grab the cave walls for support, as they would instantly burn his whole hand if he did. He dropped the alcohol bottle onto the ground; the bottle melted as soon as it hit the ground and shattered into pieces.Drip\u2026 Drip\u2026Blood started to drip down Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s nose; he could not open his eyes, as it felt as if his eyeballs were drying up from the heat. However, the blazing heat did not show any signs of subsiding.\u201cKagryaaaah!\u201d A monster wielding a greatsword made of fire roared, approaching Kang Yoon-Soo. It was a Fire Ogre with dark red skin and a muscular body. It charged fiercely at Kang Yoon-Soo.\u201c\u2026I guess I have no choice,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo muttered. He pulled out one of the trophies he had obtained from hunting a boss. It was a small fragment of bluish crystal.[Frost Demon\u2019s Winter Fragment]A jewel fragment that contains cold and corrupted power. Its use is unknown.It was the trophy Kang Yoon-Soo had obtained after killing the Frost Demon. He placed the jewel fragment in his mouth and swallowed it.[You have consumed the Frost Demon\u2019s Winter Fragment.][An unknown power is welling up from inside your body.][A ruthless curse will assail you every night for thirty nights.]Kang Yoon-Soo gathered his breath. The blazing heat that wanted to consume him slowly died down, and powerful strength welled up inside him.\u201cKaryaoooook!\u201d the Fire Ogre roared.\u201cAbyssal Sword,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo muttered.The two clashed, and Kang Yoon-Soo leaped up in the air and stabbed his sword into the Fire Ogre\u2019s neck.\u201cKryaaaoooot!\u201d the Fire Ogre screamed, slamming the hilt of its sword at Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s waist.Kang Yoon-Soo firmly held onto his sword despite the pain and pulled it out in an arcing sweep; as the sword emerged, it tore apart the Fire Ogre\u2019s jaw.[You have killed the Fire Ogre.][Your level has risen by 6.]\u201cCough!\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo coughed out blood, and he could feel the eerie, unpleasant curse spreading throughout his body. \u2018I guess I won\u2019t be sleeping for a month.\u2019 he thought, clenching his fist.However, he could afford not to sleep, and he could just stay awake for a month to fight the curse. \u2018It\u2019s the last and final life. I have to make sure everything is perfect.\u2019Kang Yoon-Soo walked deeper into the lair. There, he saw a circular object buried under a pile of rocks surrounded by lava; he could not hastily grab the object, as a high-grade protective seal had been placed on it. He thought, \u2018I would\u2019ve sent Shaneth or Sally here instead if this seal hadn\u2019t been here.\u2019He then began rearranging the magic surrounding the seal. It was a piece of cake compared to the life when he had lived as a Rogue and snuck into the Rogue Master\u2019s tomb. He easily undid the seal.\u2018I found it.\u2019 Kang Yoon-Soo was finally able to steal the treasure he had been aiming for.***The news of the ancient king Kartheon\u2019s return spread like wildfire across the desert.Five thousand Fire Trolls and elves had gathered in one spot. However, their army had been hastily formed and there was no proper command structure in place, and some had even grumbled about the sudden conscription.\u201cDo you know how many mouths I have to feed every day?! Why do I have to be conscripted into this war?!\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about? We have to stop the enemy before they create more victims!\u201d\u201cBut only the elves have died, right?!\u201d\u201cWhat did you just say?!\u201dThe trolls and elves who usually got along had gotten into a heated argument. The leaders of the respective races tried to calm things down, but it quickly became impossible to calm down their people as tensions flared and both races were severely agitated.Shaneth was getting pushed around, holding on for dear life in an attempt not to fall and become a victim of the stampeding crowd. As she struggled within the crowd, she muttered, \u201cThey managed to gather more than we expected.\u201d\u201cThe die has been cast, and we just have to wait and see how that punk will calm this ruckus down,\u201d Henrick replied.\u201cIt is too noisy,\u201d Iris, who had much more sensitive hearing than the other two, complained. She covered her ears with her hands.A brawl broke out among the agitated crowd, and the two races started to throw curses at each other.Henrick scratched his cheek and said, \u201cThis\u2026 I think it\u2019ll be difficult for even that punk to fix this situation\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy? If it\u2019s Kang Yoon-Soo, he\u2019ll definitely fix this easily, just like he has all the previous times,\u201d Shaneth replied with a frown.\u201cWhat can he do against an angry mob? Public speaking isn\u2019t like hunting or taking care of bandits; it\u2019s a completely different thing,\u201d Henrick replied. He suddenly turned toward Iris, asking with a grimace, \u201cHey, what have you been doing all this time, hugging that thing like that?\u201dIris looked up. She was tightly hugging a large basket. Shaneth asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s inside that basket, unni?\u201d\u201cI do not know. Kang Yoon-Soo told me to make sure to keep it safe,\u201d Iris replied.\u201cWe\u2019ll find out if we open it,\u201d Henrick said as he opened the basket. A large egg was inside.\u201cWhat kind of egg is this?\u201d Iris asked.\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d Shaneth replied.The trio tilted their heads, wondering just what the egg could be.***A large altar had been placed in front of the five thousand troops. They had been unable to find a proper podium in time, so they had substituted it with an altar; a voice-amplifying spell had been cast on it that would amplify the voice of the speaker on it.\u201cEveryone! Be quiet! The goddess\u2019 groom who will lead our troops will soon speak!\u201d Heron shouted as loudly as he could. However, none of the crowd seemed to be interested in listening to anything he said.Kang Yoon-Soo suddenly walked up to the altar and said, \u201cMay I have your attention, please.\u201dHowever, the crowd paid no attention to him, as they had with Heron. In fact, his low voice was overridden by the noise made by the rowdy crowd.Then, Kang Yoon-Soo silently pointed toward something. Only a few in the crowd paid any attention to where he was pointing, but the rest followed suit when they heard the panicked shouts from the people who had looked.A large shadow suddenly covered the thousands of troops who had gathered. They all looked up at it.\u201cEh? Aaah! Aaaaaaaaaaah!\u201d\u201cH-how can this be?!\u201dAll of the troops felt intense fear, and their instincts were screaming at them to run away in that instant. However, their overwhelming fear paralyzed them in place.Thud!The ground shook as the large creature the shadow belonged to landed. A sandstorm blew as it lightly flapped its wings.The red dragon that ruled the skies glared at the large group with hostility in its eyes. The dragon, Ignus, roared in a loud voice that rang throughout the desert, \u201cWhere is the bastard who stole my child?!\u201dShaneth was ghastly pale as she looked at the egg in the basket and murmured, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me\u2026 This egg is\u2026?\u201dIris started crying, and Henrick glared at Kang Yoon-Soo seriously with hostility in his eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll kill that punk with my own hands one day, I swear it.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 83": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Record of a Thousand LivesChapter 84Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAnyone who had stood in front of a dragon would lose their right to laugh at anyone who had pissed their pants in fear. There were two reasons for that. First, the presence of a dragon was more than enough to make one feel insignificant. Second, a dragon would have no qualms stepping on a creature in front of them, as they thought of other creatures as nothing more than ants in their way. Unfortunately, the latter was the more common outcome when any creature faced a dragon.Any hints of complaint or grumbling were bound to disappear in the presence of a more powerful being. The crowd that had been rowdy mere seconds before suddenly fell silent at the appearance of the dragon. The silence was so deafening that they could hear an ant\u2019s breath.\u201cI said, where is the bastard who stole my child, who has not even hatched from the egg yet?!\u201d Ignus shouted in a loud, terrifying roar.The elves who were directly in front of the dragon had blood coming out of their ears, and some started to slowly walk backward as if they were ready to make a run for it at any moment.\u201cI will burn everyone and everything in this place if anyone dares to run without providing an answer!\u201d Ignus roared once again. A frightening amount of fire started gathering in the dragon\u2019s mouth. It was obvious that someone would lose at least an arm if the dragon\u2019s breath as much as grazed past them.Who in their right mind would steal a dragon\u2019s egg?A man suddenly spoke, breaking the dead silence.\u201cI know,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.All eyes were on Kang Yoon-Soo as Ignus asked fiercely, \u201cTell me, where is the bastard who stole my child?!\u201d\u201cThe thief is in this place,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied. The crowd started to murmur noisily.Ignus fiercely blew fire out of her nostrils and asked, \u201cWho is that arrogant bastard?!\u201dKang Yoon-Soo confidently stood on the altar and said, \u201cI\u2019m the one who stole your egg.\u201d\u201cI see!\u201d Ignus exclaimed, and fire spilled out of her mouth.Most of those in the crowd suddenly had their life flash before their eyes. They recalled their wills, their childhood friends, and things they still hadn\u2019t experienced.It was a moment in which everything could go up in flames in a matter of seconds.\u201cYou\u2019ll never be able to see your child again if you kill me now,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.Ignus stopped gathering her fire, and the crowd let out a sigh of relief. Nobody had paid attention to Kang Yoon-Soo previously, but his presence had now been recognized by every single one of the five thousand troops.\u201cTell me, you insignificant speck of dust! Where is my child?!\u201d Ignus roared so loudly that the atmosphere shook. Some of the elves in front of the dragon were blown away by her fierce roar.However, Kang Yoon-Soo shook his head and replied, \u201cI can\u2019t tell you that.\u201d\u201cDie!\u201d the dragon roared. A large amount of flame once again gathered in her mouth.The crowd closed their eyes as they braced, waiting for the dragon\u2019s flame to disintegrate them at any moment. They thought, \u2018We\u2019re all going to die!\u2019\u201cOh, dragon Ignus, why do you think I stole your child?\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.Ignus swallowed her fire upon hearing Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s words. A few in the crowd passed out as nerves flared in the tense situation. The dragon asked, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cHasn\u2019t your egg not hatched for decades? It\u2019s difficult to call it a \u2018child\u2019 anymore,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.The dragon was silent for a moment, but she then asked the human, \u201cHow do you know about that?\u201d\u201cDo you still believe the egg will hatch?\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo asked in return.The dragon suddenly roared angrily, \u201cHow dare you ask me that back?!\u201dHenrick, on the other hand, grumbled and whispered, \u201cEh? If it hasn\u2019t hatched for decades\u2026 Isn\u2019t this just a rotten egg?\u201d\u201cShh! The dragon might hear you!\u201d Shaneth retorted, also in a whisper.The dragon slammed its large claws toward the altar.Baaam!The large altar was instantly torn apart, but Kang Yoon-Soo safely managed to land atop the dragon\u2019s claw without sustaining any damage. He said, \u201cYour egg won\u2019t and can\u2019t hatch.\u201d\u201cHow can you be so sure? Who knows if my child will suddenly break the shell and stick their head out one day?!\u201d the dragon roared, anger evident in her voice.Kang Yoon-Soo shook his head and said, \u201cThat\u2019s just you stupidly holding out hope as a mother.\u201dBaaam! Kwachiiiik!The altar was almost completely destroyed, and the crowd scrambled as they tried to avoid the debris falling from it.Henrick scoffed at the destruction in front of him and said, \u201cThat punk is trying to get all of us killed.\u201dIris trembled uncontrollably as she clung to Shaneth and said, \u201cI am scared. A dragon is really scary\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay, unni,\u201d Shaneth said, trying to calm Iris down. She did not feel any fear toward the dragon for some reason, and remained able to stand steadfast in Ignus\u2019 presence.\u201cShaneth?\u201d Iris called out worriedly as she saw Shaneth walk toward the dragon.Ignus roared once again at Kang Yoon-Soo, \u201cYou dare mock my child?!\u201dAn invisible aura of bloodlust filled the air. The dragon\u2019s hostility alone was more than enough to create fissures in the ceiling. The crowd\u2019s fear only grew as they felt the dragon\u2019s breath was about to descend toward them like a storm.\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t kill me,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said confidently, not budging an inch despite the pressure exerted by the dragon. In fact, he was standing face to face against the dragon.\u201cHow dare an insignificant creature like you stand in front of me?!\u201d the dragon roared once more, blowing Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s hair backward.Kang Yoon-Soo said without any hesitation, \u201cIt\u2019s because I\u2019m not scared of you.\u201d\u201cYou arrogant little\u2014!\u201d the dragon roared, now severely enraged.However, Kang Yoon-Soo ignored the dragon\u2019s ranting and asked, \u201cWhy do you think your egg isn\u2019t hatching?\u201d\u201cGrwaaaaaah!\u201d Ignus roared and gathered a ball of flame in her mouth. The dragon launched her breath toward Kang Yoon-Soo.\u201cAaaaaah!\u201d The crowd screamed in fear of the intense dragon\u2019s breath. By the time the thick black smoke subsided, they all expected the brave human to have been burned and melted without leaving a single bone behind.\u201cOh, dragon Ignus-nim. Please calm down,\u201d Shaneth pleaded, standing in front of Kang Yoon-Soo with both of her arms spread wide. She was completely unscathed even after being hit with the full force of the dragon\u2019s breath.The dragon stared at Shaneth for a moment and muttered, \u201cI see. You are the one who inherited my powers.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Shaneth replied. She had obtained a fragment of Ignus\u2019s powers from the Orb of the Covenant. Perhaps that was why she was not afraid of the dragon at all.\u201cWhy are you protecting that man?! Stand aside at once! Do not worry; I will only burn him to within an inch of his life,\u201d the dragon replied.\u201cNo, I can\u2019t do that,\u201d Shaneth replied.Ignus stared down at Shaneth, who was smaller than one of her claws. She asked, \u201cWhy is that?\u201d\u201cThis person is precious to me. That\u2019s why I can\u2019t let you kill him,\u201d Shaneth replied.\u201cThen are you asking a mother who had her child stolen from her to just let it go?!\u201d the dragon retorted.Shaneth was speechless. She could not deny that Kang Yoon-Soo had done a bad thing, and there was no way to justify what he had done no matter how precious he was to her. She turned around and asked him, \u201cW-what should I say?\u201dThen, Kang Yoon-Soo walked forward and said, \u201cPlease withdraw your anger for a moment.\u201d\u201cWhat an arrogant request. You would be burnt to a crisp if that bitch who inherited my power had not protected you,\u201d the dragon growled, scoffing at him.\u201cI\u2019ll just ask you one thing. Why didn\u2019t you break the egg that hasn\u2019t hatched for decades, instead choosing to keep it in your lair?\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo asked.\u201cAre you suggesting you would kick a child who could not walk out of your house?\u201d Ignus replied.\u201cWould you kill the only doctor who could make your child walk?\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo retorted.The dragon scoffed and replied, \u201cAre you claiming you know a way to make my egg hatch?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied with a nod.Ignus was silent for a moment before saying, \u201cImpossible.\u201d\u201cNo, I can make your child hatch out of the egg,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said with full confidence.Ignus lowered her head for a moment before saying, \u201cI admit it. My child in the egg is already dead.\u201dShaneth gasped in surprise.Ignus lamented angrily, \u201cYou asked me why I was keeping the egg in my lair? Because it is my child! Why am I angry even though I know it is a dead egg? Because it is my child!\u201dThe dragon\u2019s roars were so loud that the crowd felt as if their eardrums were about to explode. It was a roar filled both with anger and the sadness of a mother losing her child.\u201cNot a day has passed that I do not remember my child who died because of my mistake! I am sure the egg has rotted as time passed, but I cannot accept that my poor child died without even having the chance to be born!\u201d Ignus lamented further.\u201cOh, dragon Ignus, I understand the foolish hope you\u2019re holding on to,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said to the dragon.\u201cWhat are you trying to say?!\u201d Ignus roared.Kang Yoon-Soo looked at Shaneth for a moment before saying, \u201cI\u2019m living off of a foolish hope as well, just like you are.\u201d He continued, \u201cI understand the pain of not being able to see your child as well.\u201dKang Yoon-Soo was the same as Ignus. He had also lost his child, whom he would never be able to see again.\u201cWhat is your point, you insignificant creature?!\u201d Ignus growled.Kang Yoon-Soo got straight to the point. \u201cI\u2019ll make it so you can hatch your egg if you participate in the war.\u201dIgnus closed her mouth and fell silent for a moment. The dragon was seriously considering the offer. She then stared down at Kang Yoon-Soo and asked, \u201cIs something like that even possible?\u201dKang Yoon-Soo replied, \u201cThere is a man who can turn back time and return from the dead. The right to resurrect a life will be granted if we manage to kill him.\u201dThe dragon Ignus started to listen intently to the words of the human, and Kang Yoon-Soo started to convince her in front of the five thousand troops.***Several stone golems fought against Kartheon\u2019s invading army amid the vast, rocky desert.\u201cWho are you?\u201d asked a golem.\u201cThe one who will kill you all,\u201d Kartheon replied. His thousands of mummies crushed the stone golems, and he slowly accrued experience points and temporal power as the golems fell one by one.\u201cW-why did we come here?\u201d Katz asked, gulping dryly.There were a lot of dangerous monsters in the rocky desert, but Kartheon calmly replied, \u201cFollow me quietly, Katz\u2014if you do not want to wake that being up.\u201d\u201cWho are you talking about, Your Majesty?\u201d Katz asked; his voice was filled with anxiety and fear.Kartheon laughed at the human and replied, \u201cThere is nothing to be scared of. That being is going to be one of us soon.\u201dKartheon and his army reached the center of the rocky desert. What they found at the center was a complicated set of inscriptions and an octagonal seal.\u201cThe being trapped in this place since ancient times is still stuck here,\u201d Kartheon said with a smile. The ancient king bit his finger and released a drop of his blood into the center of the octagon.Rumble\u2026!The ground they were standing on started to tremble, and it felt as if something humongous were moving in the vast rocky desert.\u201cW-what the hell is that?!\u201d Katz screamed, falling on his rear.A gigantic creature, with tattoos all over its large body and skin as hard as steel, stood up from the sand. The giant had a jewel embedded in the center of its head.\u201cAre you surprised?\u201d Kartheon asked with a laugh.Katz replied while trembling, \u201cI\u2019m more than surprised! I almost fainted! What is that giant?!\u201dThe massive giant made the Fire Giants they had killed look like children. Kartheon looked at the gigantic creature that was so tall he could barely see its head and said, \u201cThat is a Colossus.\u201dA Colossus was a creature multiple times bigger than a giant; Colossi were also known as the gods of the giants. They were creatures that were supposed to have only existed in mythology, unlike dragons or golden goblins, which existed but were extremely rare.\u201cA C-Colossus? Why did it show up all of a sudden\u2026?!\u201d Katz asked in surprise.A Colossus was said to be able to rip a mountain out of the ground with one hand, and was supposed to be strong enough to overpower a dragon by its strength alone.\u201cThis was where my kingdom, Sharshyanon, existed in the past, and that Colossus used to hold the ground of the capital together,\u201d Kartheon explained.The words spoken by the ancient king sounded like something that would only be passed down as myth or folklore. Katz could not help but look at Kartheon in disbelief.\u201cThere is nothing to be so surprised about. A magic tower where the Colossi gather and live together exists on the continent. That being was the weakest one among them and was banished from the tower,\u201d Kartheon explained.\u201cB-banished? It looks as if it would be bigger than a dragon, just judging from its size\u2026?\u201d Katz exclaimed.\u201cDo you not think we will at least need someone like this to destroy the continent?\u201d Kartheon replied with a smile. The ancient king moved his left hand, and the Colossus responded to his command and moved its gigantic body.\u2018999th regression?\u2019 Kartheon thought as his gaze turned sharp.If there really was a man who was living his 1,000th life, that was something interesting in itself. There was no better place than the Desert of Death to face such an opponent. The ancient king planned to use both his power to control time and the Colossus to thoroughly step on the self-proclaimed regressor.\u2018I will kill all life on this continent, and I will regress back in time.\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 84": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Record of a Thousand LivesChapter 85Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe Desert of Death was littered with decomposed corpses; in it, it would be quite easy to come across a bleached white skull that belonged to either an adventurer or a monster. There even existed a place in the Desert of Death that had turned pearly white because of the number of bones gathered there.\u2018The Tomb of Bones.\u2019Kang Yoon-Soo walked alone in the sea of bones that colored the desert ground white.\u201cIt\u2019s a living being\u2026!\u201d\u201cI was so lonely\u2026!\u201d\u201cCome stay with us\u2026!\u201dZombies with gray, decomposed skin slowly started to gather one by one, trailing behind Kang Yoon-Soo. The tomb where the dead resided was certain to have a horde of undead crawling in it.Kang Yoon-Soo swung his white sword and killed the zombies one by one.[The Sword of Revelation displays tremendous power against the dead who have come back to life.]The Sword of Revelation could inflict a lot of damage on those who had returned from death, and Kartheon was no exception.\u201cSummon Mini-Lich,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo muttered.A small skeleton wearing a fluttering red robe appeared out of nowhere and asked, \u201cWhat is your command?\u201d\u201cFight against the undead,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo commanded.The Mini-Lich stabbed its staff into the desert ground and said, \u201cListen to me, all of you undead. I will be your friend!\u201d\u201cOooh\u2026!\u201d\u201cA great Lich has come to us\u2026!\u201dThe Mini-Lich had the ability to control and command lower-ranked undead. Some of the zombies forgot their hostility toward Kang Yoon-Soo, and they redirected their aggression toward the other zombies.\u2018It\u2019ll be easier for the Mini-Lich to control mid-ranked undead if it grows stronger,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo thought.The pair soon swept up all of the zombies trailing them. The academically curious Mini-Lich looked back at the zombies\u2019 remains and asked, \u201cMay I research and analyze these right now?\u201d\u201cDo it later,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.\u201cAlright,\u201d the kind and innocent Mini-Lich obediently responded without any complaints, continuing to follow behind Kang Yoon-Soo.A desert littered with bleached white skulls appeared before them. Some bones were degraded so severely that it was impossible to recognize their original form, and some were even larger than the sand dunes.\u201cI smell the stench of death in this place,\u201d the Mini-Lich said happily.Kang Yoon-Soo extended his right hand and muttered, \u201cMass Raise Dead.\u201dThe bones that had been severely damaged or weathered lay still on the ground, but the rest of the bones that were still in good condition rose up at Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s command. A total of 170 undead came back to life.\u2018The undead I can raise at my current state are around the lower mid-rank,\u2019 Kang Yoon-Soo thought.The undead that had been summoned were a mix of Skeleton Trolls, Zombie Elves, and Dark Sandworms. Kang Yoon-Soo still had a long way to go if he wanted to raise a dragon the way he had in a previous life.Kang Yoon-Soo used \u2018Mass Raise Dead\u2019 over and over again whenever his mana replenished; he was able to raise approximately a thousand undead from the area alone.[The skill level of \u2018Mass Raise Dead\u2019 has risen.][You are now able to raise undead that are a rank higher.]Mass Raise Dead had reached Level 5. Skills were usually capped at Level 15, and it could be only said that one had mastered a skill if they managed to max out its proficiency.\u2018It isn\u2019t enough to simply raise undead over and over again if I want to master Necromancy.\u2019Kang Yoon-Soo would not be satisfied by simply raising undead. He needed to raise corpses that belonged to rarer and more powerful monsters, and he had to create a legion of undead that followed his commands.\u2018It\u2019s not only the Necromancer skills. I have to obtain all the useful skills on the continent and grow more powerful.\u2019Kang Yoon-Soo called out, \u201cLich.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d the Mini-Lich asked.\u201cI\u2019ll give you a book that will be helpful to your research,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.\u201cReally?\u201d the Mini-Lich asked expectantly with a bright glow on its face.Liches were usually unrivaled when it came to their cleverness and cunning. They possessed tremendous capacity to lord over other undead, but they lacked the character and loyalty to be used as summons.\u2018But the Mini-Lich isn\u2019t like that,\u2019 Kang Yoon-Soo thought.The Mini-Lich had been created without the skull of an Archmage, and it could be said to not be a complete Lich. Although it did not possess the wisdom of a normal Lich, it had been created with a very innocent and guileless nature.Kang Yoon-Soo took out Nakron\u2019s Codex from his backpack. He said, \u201cRead this and carry out more research.\u201d\u201cThank you, master. This is the first book I have seen that is so detailed when it comes to the undead,\u201d the Mini-Lich said happily.[The Mini-Lich is reading and studying Nakron\u2019s Codex.][The Lich\u2019s research capacity has increased.][The hidden function of Nakron\u2019s Codex has been revealed.][Nakron\u2019s Diary]Rating: RareA personal book written by the Ultimate Necromancer himself. It explains the structure of the undead in detail. Only a clever Necromancer will be able to unlock its hidden function.-Current Research Progress: 0%Nakron\u2019s Codex will transform into a unique, one-of-a-kind magic codex if research on it is completed.\u2018I should use it if the Mini-Lich manages to complete its research,\u2019 Kang Yoon-Soo thought.Researching the undead was cumbersome and required a lot of time and dedication, and the academically curious Mini-Lich was perfect for the job. It was a win-win situation, since the Mini-Lich would grow exponentially while it conducted its research into Nakron\u2019s Codex.\u201cThis is an amazing book! I want to serve whomever wrote this book as my teacher!\u201d the Mini-Lich excitedly exclaimed as it flipped through the pages.\u201cTry it out,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.\u201cAlright! I will make an undead just as it is written in this book!\u201d the Mini-Lich said excitedly.\u201cI\u2019ll help you,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo added.\u201cThank you very much, master!\u201d the Mini-Lich exclaimed excitedly like a student who was excited to learn a bit more from class. It cried, \u201cI want to try creating the Bone Monster of Destruction!\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t do that now,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.The Bone Monster of Destruction required a hundred million bones just to create. For the time being, Kang Yoon-Soo flipped through the pages and found a suitable undead being for Mini-Lich to create.[Grave Soldier]Kang Yoon-Soo commanded the undead he had raised to collect the corpses and bones littered across the area. The corpses gathered by the undead either bore the crest of an ancient kingdom\u2019s officials, or were wearing military uniforms.The Mini-Lich clumsily drew a magic circle and thrust its staff into the center, shouting, \u201cArise!\u201dThe corpse parts started to stitch together, and a new undead was born. It was an undead swordsman that had cross-shaped marks all over its body.[The Mini-Lich has created its first undead.][The Lich\u2019s skull has grown slightly bigger.][The codex\u2019s research progress has increased by 1%.]\u201cIt is a success, master!\u201d the Mini-Lich shouted, jumping in joy.The Grave Soldier slowly opened its eyes and said, \u201cSo this is the world.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll give you my command,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.The Grave Soldier drew its sword and asked, \u201cWhom should I kill?\u201d\u201cTake the undead with you and head west. Ambush the forces of the ancient king Kartheon,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo commanded.\u201cKartheon!\u201d the Grave Soldier shouted angrily.\u201cDo you know Kartheon?\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo asked.\u201cNo, I do not. But the owner of my right-hand feels a deep sense of hatred for that name,\u201d the Grave Soldier replied.Kang Yoon-Soo could only summon low or mid-ranked undead, but he could use Nakron\u2019s Codex to collect materials and create high-ranked undead. The Grave Soldier was a high-ranked undead being that was made from the corpses of many soldiers.The Grave Soldier harbored a deep sense of hatred toward the ancient king, and it also had excellent commanding ability. There was no one else more suitable to command the undead army at that time than the Grave Soldier created by the Mini-Lich.\u201cI will kill Kartheon!\u201d the Grave Soldier exclaimed as it moved out with its undead troops.Kang Yoon-Soo finished his business in the tomb. He stared at the Mini-Lich for a moment.The Mini-Lich asked when it found Kang Yoon-Soo staring at it, \u201cDo you have something to say, master?\u201dThere was something bothering Kang Yoon-Soo. He eventually said, \u201cDon\u2019t call me \u2018master\u2019 from now on.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d the Mini-Lich asked.Kang Yoon-Soo was silent for a moment. It was not something he would usually concern himself with, and it was not something related to killing the Demon Lord, but he could not help but feel bothered by it. He finally said, \u201cI don\u2019t like being called that.\u201d\u201cWhy do you not want to be called \u2018master\u2019? Humans usually love that word. It means I am master\u2019s servant,\u201d the Mini-Lich said while tilting its bony head.\u201cYou aren\u2019t my servant,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.The Mini-Lich tilted its head in confusion once again and asked, \u201cIf I am not your servant\u2026 What am I to master?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.\u201cMaster is a weird human,\u201d the Mini-Lich said as it scratched its hollow eye socket. It asked, \u201cThen what should I call you?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s up to you,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.The Mini-Lich hesitated for a moment before saying, \u201cThen I will call you \u2018friend\u2019.\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.\u201c\u2026\u201d The Mini-Lich was left with a dilemma. It clacked its jaw and said, \u201cI am stupid.\u201d\u201cI know,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.\u201cThat is why I want to learn more. I want a teacher who can always teach me new things,\u201d the Mini-Lich said as it looked up at Kang Yoon-Soo. It continued, \u201cWhat if master becomes a teacher to me?\u201d\u201cTeacher?\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo asked.\u201cMaster is an amazing human. You know everything about the world and you are good at everything. That is why I want you to become my teacher, who will teach me different kinds of things,\u201d the Mini-Lich said. It was to be expected, considering its thirst for knowledge.Kang Yoon-Soo pondered for a moment, before he nodded and said, \u201cAlright.\u201d\u201cSee you next time, teacher,\u201d the Mini-Lich said as it gripped Nakron\u2019s Codex and disappeared into the summon dimension.Kang Yoon-Soo had been left alone, but he was deep in thought. \u2018Why did I say something like that\u2026?\u2019A master or a teacher\u2026 Why did it matter what the Lich called him? \u2018I don\u2019t know\u2026\u2019Perhaps it was because it was his last life? He felt himself slowly changing.However, Kang Yoon-Soo eventually shook his head and thought, \u2018There\u2019s no time for me to waste thinking about things like this.\u2019He pressed a button on his wrist device, and newly updated information on the legendary quest popped up.[Legendary Quest\u2014Emperor of Time]The ancient king Kartheon has surpassed time and resurrected. Kartheon is trying to destroy the continent by using his powers. Stop him from achieving his goals.Rewards: Authority of Domination or Authority of TimeKang Yoon-Soo started to prepare for the upcoming war.***Smoke rose from a campfire in Kartheon\u2019s campsite.Katz rubbed his sleepy eyes and asked, \u201cWhere\u2019s the Colossus? That huge thing disappeared overnight.\u201d\u201cThat is none of your business,\u201d Kartheon replied as he looked into the horizon.His thousands of mummies scoured the desert looking for prey to hunt, in order to make the dry sands run with rivers of blood once more.\u201cKatz, do you think I am doing something stupid?\u201d Kartheon asked.Katz instinctively knew he had to lie this time, but his lips took after their owner and stubbornly refused to do what his instinct told him. He replied, \u201cYes, I think so, your majesty.\u201d\u201cIs it so wrong to want to regress?\u201d Kartheon asked.\u201cIt\u2019s more about the fact your majesty doesn\u2019t give a damn about the world that will be left behind. That\u2019s the problem,\u201d Katz answered before gulping water from a canteen.Katz extended the water canteen to Kartheon, but the ancient king shook his head and said, \u201cIt is difficult\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you know how to drink water?\u201d Katz asked.Kartheon furrowed his barely-intact brows and said, \u201cNot that. Regressing, I mean.\u201d\u201cI was kidding, your majesty,\u201d Katz said with a shrug.Kartheon let out a laugh and said, \u201cYou seem to have made yourself comfortable.\u201d\u201cI think I began to understand the loneliness of a king after being choked by the neck,\u201d Katz said.\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Kartheon asked.\u201cYou majesty could have immediately killed me when you strangled me, just like when you killed my fellow graverobber, but your majesty spared me\u2014until now,\u201d Katz said seriously. He continued, \u201cYour majesty needed someone to talk to, am I right?\u201dKartheon nodded slightly, but did not affirm or deny what Katz said.Katz asked something he had wanted to ask for a long time. \u201cWill your majesty kill me too?\u201d\u201cDid I not answer that already? I will kill every living being on this continent,\u201d Kartheon said. Katz grimaced at the ancient king\u2019s words. Kartheon laughed and added, \u201cYour life was wasted as a graverobber.\u201d\u201cIs that so? Then could your majesty at least build me a nice tomb to make it look as if I used to be someone important after you kill me?\u201d Katz requested.\u201cWhat should I engrave on your tombstone?\u201d Kartheon asked.\u201cHmm\u2026 I have no idea, since I\u2019m uneducated, after all,\u201d Katz answered.\u201cI have a suggestion. What about \u2018the one who stole from the dead paid for his crimes one last time\u2019?\u201d Kartheon suggested.\u201cUgh\u2026 It feels as if other graverobbers would just dig me up. It\u2019s not as if there would be anything to be stolen, though,\u201d Katz complained.\u201cYou enjoyed robbing the dead, but you do not want to be robbed when you die?\u201d Kartheon remarked, sounding amused.\u201cIsn\u2019t that normal?\u201d Katz replied.\u201cI suppose it is along the same lines as my desire to regress,\u201d Kartheon said.Katz was flabbergasted when he heard the ancient king\u2019s words. He quickly changed the topic, and asked \u201cHas your majesty thought of what to engrave on your tombstone?\u201d\u201cI have already died once. I already had a tombstone beside my coffin,\u201d Kartheon replied.Katz rattled his brain, and now that he thought about it, there had been some complicated inscriptions written on the coffin. He asked, \u201cWhat was written there?\u201dRight as Kartheon was about to respond, he suddenly said, \u201cThere is an ambush.\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201d Katz exclaimed.The surroundings were quiet as Katz looked around. Suddenly, he saw a cloud of dust charging toward them. Upon closer inspection, it seemed there were close to a thousand undead heading their way.\u201cW-what?! Why would the undead suddenly show up?!\u201d Katz exclaimed in surprise.\u201cI do not think the battle will end today,\u201d Kartheon remarked as he headed down the sand dune to gather his mummies. Katz hurriedly followed behind the ancient king.The prelude to the war between the king who controlled time and the regressor had started.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 85": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Record of a Thousand LivesChapter 86Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayKartheon\u2019s mummies were very strong; they were considered to be undead, but they had unconditional loyalty toward the ancient king. They marched while staying in formation, and they carried out any orders from the ancient king\u2014no matter what they were.\u201cKill the enemies,\u201d Kartheon commanded. The mummies immediately charged as soon as his order was given.The ancient king\u2019s mummies came in all shapes and sizes. Some were the size of adult humans, and others were the size of ogres. Some of them used their monstrous strength to crush their enemies, and others used their bloodstained bandages to infect their enemies.\u201cThe enemies are mummies! Be careful not to get caught by their bandages and focus on attacking!\u201d the Grave Soldier commanded from the vanguard position as he cut down mummy after mummy.\u201cThe enemy leader is the ancient king Kartheon! All ranged units! Focus your fire on Kartheon!\u201d the Grave Soldier commanded.The Skeleton Archers drew their bowstrings and fired. Kartheon waved his left hand, and a wall of mummies appeared in front of him and shielded him from the incoming arrows.\u201cThe enemy numbers just a meager thousand! The enemy is powerless in front of us, who number seven thousand! Do not falter and attack!\u201d Kartheon commanded.The undead army was severely outnumbered, and the tide of battle tilted heavily in favor of the ancient king, but Kartheon could not relax one bit. He thought, \u2018This is too easy. There is no way they would have carried out an ambush that was certain to fail.\u2019The enemy had accurately pinpointed their location and launched an ambush, and judging by the presence of a commander, these were not average, run-of-the-mill undead. It seemed someone had formally declared war against Kartheon.\u2018It matters not who comes at me. I will turn you all into dust,\u2019 Kartheon thought.At that moment, the Grave Soldier charged into the enemy lines and struck down three mummies with one swing of its sword. It charged deeper behind enemy lines and finally reached Kartheon, swinging its sword at the neck of the ancient king.However, Kartheon leisurely rolled back time five seconds by five seconds. Then, the ancient king avoided the Grave Soldier\u2019s sword with relative ease and grabbed the undead assailant with his right hand.\u201cKu-kuheok!\u201d The Grave Soldier struggled.\u201cThat swordsmanship\u2026 It seems familiar. Are you made up of someone from ancient times?\u201d Kartheon asked.\u201cI d-despise you!\u201d the Grave Soldier shouted angrily, its voice full of hostility.\u201cWell, it does not matter.\u201d Kartheon shrugged and absorbed the Grave Soldier\u2019s life force. The ancient king\u2019s level rose by 5, and he also obtained the sword used by the undead.[Sword of Remaksia]\u2018This is the sword of the corrupt soldier I executed in the past,\u2019 Kartheon thought. The sword was still sharp despite the time that had passed.The undead army was easily annihilated after they lost their commanding officer, and Kartheon cleaned them up, turning them into temporal power.Katz followed behind Kartheon, exclaiming,, \u201cPhew! It\u2019s a relief that the battle finished quickly.\u201d\u201cThe enemy\u2019s strategy was so simple, I did not even have time to scoff at it,\u201d Kartheon said.\u201cHuh? What do you mean, your majesty?\u201d Katz asked in confusion.\u201cThe undead were only bait,\u201d Kartheon said as he pointed toward the surroundings with his new sword.The place they were in was surrounded by sand dunes. A cloud of dust rose from all four directions toward them, and then\u2026\u201cHaaaaaah!\u201d The coalition of Fire Trolls and elves charged toward Kartheon.***Kang Yoon-Soo used his Earth Staff to shift the desert sands and create traps. He continued to use the staff even as he was recovering his mana.[The staff has reached its limits.][The staff\u2019s durability will drop and the staff might be destroyed if you continue using it.]Kang Yoon-Soo was not fazed at all, using the staff to its full capabilities to dig a large hole in the desert. The staff broke in half as soon as he finished digging the final trap.Crack!\u201cLure them here,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said. The elf magicians nodded and transmitted the message to the army.The Fire Trolls in the vanguard clashed with the mummies; the mummies were instantly crushed without even having the chance to properly gauge the Fire Trolls\u2019 strength.Puseok!A few of the mummies fell into the traps, creating an opening for the coalition army to charge deeper into the enemy force.The Fire Trolls released their body heat as they excitedly went on a rampage.\u201cIt\u2019s been a while since we had a battle like this!\u201d\u201cMy power is overwhelming!\u201dThe Fire Trolls flexed their muscles, causing the blood vessels on their arms to swell, and swung their clubs at the mummies. Their overwhelming strength made the mummies explode as soon as they made contact with the trolls\u2019 clubs.\u201cMere weaklings,\u201d Kartheon muttered.A unit of large mummies appeared as the ancient king\u2019s army changed their battle formation. The large mummies used their size and strength to pick up the Fire Trolls easily. Twenty Fire Trolls at the forefront who had been rushing at the enemy were twisted like dolls and killed instantly.\u201cKorkwi!\u201d\u201cHow dare you kill my brother?!\u201dYanak barely managed to calm down the Fire Trolls, exclaiming, \u201cDon\u2019t get too worked up! Maintain formation! The elves will take care of the large mummies!\u201dThe elves who were casting spells at the back waved their staves.\u201cMay the fire of retribution burn our enemies!\u201d\u201cBurn, children of darkness!\u201dThe elves\u2019 magic doused the large mummies in oil before following up with fire magic. Their combined attacks burned the large mummies away.\u201cTeam 3 of the 1st Battalion. Fire at will,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo commanded the elves.The elves let loose their fire arrows toward the ancient king\u2019s army. The elves were miles away from their targets, but the bows they used allowed them to vastly outrange any enemy. Five large mummies burned away.\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be easy,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo muttered to himself as he watched over the battle from atop a sand dune.The coalition army that had been divided into four managed to corral the ancient king\u2019s army into one spot, but they didn\u2019t manage to reduce the enemy\u2019s numbers by much.\u2018It\u2019s because of Kartheon\u2019s commanding skills.\u2019The ancient king\u2019s commanding style was different from Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s. Kang Yoon-Soo had to relay his orders to the Fire Trolls and elves, and they had to be able to fully follow his commands. However, all Kartheon had to do was wave his left hand and the mummies would follow his will to the letter.\u2018He\u2019ll just roll back time even if we manage to shoot off his left hand or charge in and cut it off.\u2019The ancient king who controlled time was a very difficult opponent to deal with. The key to turning the tides of war in their favor would be to boost the coalition army\u2019s overall combat power.Kang Yoon-Soo stretched out his right hand and muttered, \u201cSummon Sally, White, Acle, and the Mini-Lich.\u201d He called out all the summons he had in his summon dimension.\u201cWhat? Did you summon me in the desert again?!\u201d Acle screamed angrily toward Kang Yoon-Soo.Sally pulled on the boy\u2019s shirt and said, \u201cAcle, don\u2019t yell at papa.\u201d\u201cHmph! I don\u2019t want to listen to anything a weakling like you has to say!\u201d Acle retorted with a scoff.\u201cWaaah! Papa! Acle is being mean to me!\u201d Sally cried out to her father.\u201cDo not fight; you are siblings. It is bad to fight,\u201d the Mini-Lich said, trying to ease the tension between the siblings.The commotion from calling on all of his summons at once was chaos itself, but that was the precise reason why Kang Yoon-Soo had divided the coalition army into four groups.\u201cPick one army each and join the battle,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.\u201cRimarikoro?\u201d White asked.Kang Yoon-Soo nodded and said, \u201cThe enemy leader can control time. Prioritize taking care of the mummies.\u201dThree summons all went their separate ways as they each joined an army, and only Acle was left behind. The Ice Spirit glared at Kang Yoon-Soo, screaming at him with a face red with anger, \u201cDamn it! What are you looking at?! That\u2019s right, I\u2019m useless in the desert! So what?!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll lend you this,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said as he took out a crown from his backpack and tossed it to the Ice Spirit.Acle quickly caught the crown and stuttered, \u201cHmm\u2026 You\u2026 You are quite the nice guy, aren\u2019t you\u2026? Hehehe\u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll go crazy if you overuse that crown, so be careful,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo warned him. Acle went down the sand dune to join the last remaining army, and Kang Yoon-Soo stood up as he watched Acle descend.The tides of war, which had previously been against them, began to stabilize thanks to the four summons joining the fray. Sally absorbed the heat of the desert and unleashed fierce flames that burned the mummies away, the Mini-Lich replenished their troops by raising the dead as undead, White charged into the battlefield and wreaked havoc behind enemy lines, and Acle ecstatically unleashed ice storms while laughing like a maniac.\u2018The summons have grown stronger.\u2019They had grown enough to be able to adapt to the situation and fight according to their own combat styles.[White\u2019s wild instincts have been unleashed after killing twenty mummies.][White has learned a new skill, \u2018Wolf\u2019s Fear\u2019.]White had learned a new skill after participating in the war. War was never a pleasant thing, but ironically, it was the best fertilizer for a fighter\u2019s growth.\u2018So far, so good.\u2019Kartheon was not an opponent Kang Yoon-Soo could face at this point in time; it was safer for him to attempt to assassinate the ancient king rather than face him head-on in a war.\u2018It\u2019d be easy to kill Kartheon alone.\u2019The easiest way Kang Yoon-Soo had used to deal with Kartheon in the past was by using sleeping drugs. He had wrapped himself in bandages and infiltrated the mummies\u2019 camp, and he had laced the ancient king\u2019s food with sleeping drugs. Kartheon had not even had the opportunity to turn back time, and Kang Yoon-Soo had used that opening to assassinate the ancient king.\u2018But there\u2019s nothing much to be gained by taking care of him that way.\u2019Kartheon\u2019s level was quite low because of his body having degraded over time, and Kang Yoon-Soo would not be able to obtain many experience points by killing him. However, the ancient king\u2019s troops dropped good loot and also handsomely rewarded whomever killed them with a lot of experience points.\u2018There won\u2019t be any casualties if I choose to assassinate him, but I have to grow as much as I can to face the Demon Lord.\u2019Kang Yoon-Soo purposely chose the hard way to maximize his growth in preparation for the final battle.Kartheon soon massacred the elves. They were victims who should not have died, but they died anyway because of the choices Kang Yoon-Soo made. Those who would not have been sacrificed were sacrificed, and the ones who would not have had to shed any tears had to shed tears at the loss of their loved ones.\u2018I won\u2019t make any excuses.\u2019Kang Yoon-Soo had lived too long to feel any guilt or remorse because of his actions; he focused only on his sole objective. There was only one solution to all the problems in the world, after all.\u2018That\u2019s to kill the Demon Lord.\u2019The intense battle continued, but Kang Yoon-Soo just remained at the rear as he continuously gave out commands.\u2018It\u2019s still not time for me to join.\u2019He tracked the trajectory of the sunset, and he could see that the appointed time was fast approaching.\u2018It\u2019s now time for that to slowly make its entrance.\u2019A large shadow blocked the sun and turned the desert dark. An ear-splitting roar reverberated across the desert. \u201cKrwwaaaaaaaah!\u201dKatz, who had been busy running away regardless of which side he was on, suddenly shouted fearfully, \u201cI-it\u2019s the dragon Ignus! It\u2019s the ruler of the Desert of Death!\u201dThe dragon covered in red scales flew over their heads; she was large enough to cover the battlefield in her shadow.Kartheon was amazed at the sight of the dragon, saying in admiration, \u201cIt has become larger than the dragons of ancient times.\u201d\u201cThis isn\u2019t the time to admire it!\u201d Katz shouted. However, he thought to himself, \u2018Wouldn\u2019t it be better if Kartheon\u2019s army gets annihilated by the dragon?\u2019However, Kartheon laughed as if he could read Katz\u2019s mind and said, \u201cThere is no way that my army will lose. Even if the enemy is a dragon.\u201d The ancient king retained his composure, even in front of the mighty dragon who was feared by all.The dragon Ignus descended before the thousands of mummies, and the pressure from her wingbeats was enough to stir up a sandstorm. She opened her mouth wide.Fwaaaaaaah!Dragon breath that was hotter than the fires of hell blasted out of Ignus\u2019 mouth and engulfed the ancient king\u2019s mummies.Kartheon waved his left hand in an attempt to make the mummies spread out, but hundreds of his mummies had already been burned to a crisp by the dragon.\u201cS-save me!\u201d an elf screamed, running away from a large mummy.Ignus stepped on the chasing mummy; just like that, a large mummy that would have required tens of coalition members to bring down was squashed like an ant. She flapped her wings and muttered, \u201cO, winds of the desert. Sweep away everything in my sight!\u201dA dragon\u2019s magic was incomparable to normal magic used by other creatures. The winds that had gathered from Ignus\u2019 wingbeats suddenly grew into a fierce desert storm that threatened to swallow everything in its path.Whirl! Whirl!Hundreds of mummies flew into the air and were swallowed by the storm, and their bodies were torn to shreds. The storm was so intense that even the members of the coalition had to take care so as not to be swept up by it.\u201cThat\u2019s a dragon!\u201d\u201cThe mighty being is with us!\u201dThe morale of the coalition army rose significantly due to the appearance of one creature, and they felt that victory was certainly on their side.It was at that moment that Kartheon raised his left hand. He remarked with a smirk, \u201cWould it not be a bit too boring if this war ended just because a dragon suddenly decided to appear out of nowhere?\u201dSuddenly, an enormous creature stood up from the sand. The creature had no problem standing up even though the storm was right over it, and a single step from it felt as if the whole desert would collapse.\u201cWhat the hell?!\u201d\u201cA giant? No! It\u2019s much larger than a giant!\u201dThe Colossus began to run, and the whole desert shook as if an earthquake had begun in it.\u201cGraaaaaaahh!\u201d Ignus roared, unleashing her dragon breath once more.Fwaaah!The Colossus ignored the flames as it charged straight for the dragon. It grabbed Ignus\u2019 wing with its large hands\u2014and ripped it off the dragon.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Blood gushed out of her body like a waterfall, and her torn-off wing fell to the ground.However, the dragon did not falter at all. In fact, she glared at the Colossus and roared, \u201cSo the stupid musclehead has decided to trust in its strength and dares stand against me?!\u201dIgnus bit down into the Colossus\u2019 shoulder with her large fangs, and the Colossus roared in pain as its shoulder was crushed by the mighty dragon\u2019s powerful jaws. The Colossus flailed its arms and smashed them down at the dragon\u2019s neck.Kwachik! Pukeok!The tides of war shifted after the two enormous beings clashed against each other. The troops from both sides stopped fighting and froze in place, watching in awe as the intense battle of the two mighty beings unfolded before their eyes. None of them dared to move, as they were certain they would be crushed if they got in the way of the two beings and were stepped on.\u201cKruwwaaaaaaah!\u201d the Colossus roared as it threw an uppercut at the dragon. With a loud crack, the dragon\u2019s fangs broke. Heavy pressure waves rippled through the air whenever the two mighty beings clashed.\u201cArise, my fangs! Absorb the power of nature and become my strength!\u201d Ignus roared, using more of her dragon magic.The dragon\u2019s fangs that had fallen to the ground slowly shifted into the form of creatures and rose up from the ground\u2014it was an army of Spartoi.\u201cAttack the Colossus!\u201d The Spartoi let out a war cry, wielding greatswords with their bulging muscles as they charged at the Colossus.The Spartoi that appeared this time looked so ferocious and strong that they were incomparable to the one who had appeared from the Orb of the Covenant. Their army bravely charged at the Colossus\u2019 feet and started to hack away at it.\u201cL-let\u2019s help!\u201d\u201cWake up! We can\u2019t just watch from the sidelines!\u201dThe elves fired their bows at the Colossus, but their arrows did not even manage to scratch the being\u2019s thick skin, instead bouncing off harmlessly. The Fire Trolls did not dare approach the Colossus, as they were scared of being crushed to death should it step on them like ants.\u2018The Colossus is around Level 600. It is not an easy opponent even for a dragon,\u2019 Kartheon thought with a smile. The ancient king admitted that a dragon was a mighty being, but the Colossus it was facing had been his strongest soldier back when he ruled in ancient times.\u2018There is no way it will lose,\u2019 Kartheon thought confidently.The dragon Ignus, whose wing had been torn off, was getting pushed back by the Colossus. The ancient king\u2019s army did not pass up the chance to commence their attack once again. The battle between the troops beneath the two mighty beings flared up once again, and they fought ferociously against each other.It was just as the tides of war were shifting to favor the ancient king that Kang Yoon-Soo decided to finally make a move.\u2018The time has come.\u2019He collected his breath, and the power sleeping within him awoke once again.[The Frost Demon\u2019s Winter Fragment has unleashed its powers.][You are borrowing this power, and you will pay a price in the future.][Demonization has started.]A pair of wings grew out of Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s back, two horns protruded out of his forehead, and he gave off a freezing cold aura.[You have transformed into a Frost Demon.][You will be able to maintain your form until midnight.][Your personality and habits are very similar to those of the demon race.][You are able to fully use the powers of the demon race.][The forces that are looking for suitable candidates to become a Demon King will send you an invitation if you commit 444 atrocities while in the form of a demon.][You may only use \u2018Demonization\u2019 once every 66 days.][You will not be able to return to human form if you use \u2018Demonization\u2019 more than once within the span of 66 days.]A Frost Demon was a demonic being that not only used black magic, but also possessed enormous strength. Demons were the only beings who could stand toe to toe against a dragon and a Colossus.\u2018I\u2019ll take care of the Colossus first.\u2019The chilling Frost Demon spread his wings out in the hot, dry desert, and Kang Yoon-Soo flew up into the sky. He could clearly see the entirety of the battlefield as weapons clashed and blood was spilled.Dudududu\u2026!The Sword of Revelation trembled, and its originally pure white blade suddenly turned black, starting from its hilt.\u2018I can\u2019t use the Sword of Revelation while in demon form.\u2019The Sword of Revelation was a holy gift from the goddess to her groom, and it would lose all its powers at the hands of a demon.Kang Yoon-Soo sheathed the Sword of Revelation and flew toward Acle. He called out, \u201cAcle.\u201d\u201cDamn it! Why are you bothering me in the middle of a battle\u2026 What?! How are you suddenly flying around?! Did you fornicate and crossbreed with a bat or something?!\u201d Acle shouted in surprise.\u201cMake eight swords out of ice for me,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.\u201cTsk! I\u2019m making them so you won\u2019t bother me later, okay?!\u201d Acle exclaimed as he gathered his powers and created eight swords out of ice.Kang Yoon-Soo equipped a sword on each of his fingers, wielding all eight of them in both of his hands. He flew up once again, and the skills he had temporarily obtained after transforming into the Frost Demon popped up.[Demon\u2019s Overwhelming Strength (Lvl11)][Cold Armor (Lvl9)][Summon Hell Creatures (Lvl8)][Ice Touch (Lvl12)][Absolute Zero (Lvl10)]\u201cSummon Hell Creatures,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo muttered. The space beside him distorted for a moment, and hideous-looking monsters ran out of that space.\u201cKruwwwwwaaaaah!\u201dThese were monsters that had gone berserk after inhaling the air of Pandemonium. They included kobolds that had horns growing all over their bodies, and goblins covered in purple spots.\u2018These guys won\u2019t listen to anyone.\u2019The hell creatures that had appeared were incredibly strong, but there was no way to control them. However, they charged at the Colossus even though Kang Yoon-Soo did not bother giving them a command.\u201cIt\u2019s big! Puhahaha! Meat! There\u2019s a lot of meat!\u201d\u201cKruuuwwaaaah! Thanks for the meal!\u201dThe Colossus\u2019 muscles were filled with toxins that hell creatures loved. They managed to bite off chunk after chunk of the Colossus\u2019 skin and muscle, that even the elves\u2019 arrows had failed to leave a scratch on, with their razor-sharp teeth. The Colossus roared in pain, shaking its leg in an attempt to shake off and step on the rodents munching away at its leg.Kwachik!The Colossus slammed its leg down on the ground, and numerous hell creatures exploded from the impact. However, Kang Yoon-Soo took the opportunity to land on the Colossus\u2019 abdomen and entered its belly button, which was as deep as a cave.\u2018The life I lived as a miner and conquered all seventy-seven jewel mines on the continent\u2026\u2019Kang Yoon-Soo used the eight swords on both of his hands to dig away at the Colossus\u2019 muscles. The Colossus that was still fighting an intense battle against the mighty dragon suddenly screamed in pain.\u201cKuuuoogh!\u201d The Colossus twisted its body tightly in an attempt to shake off the invader, but all it achieved was to create an opening for Ignus to attack and bite its arm.Crack! C-Crack!Kang Yoon-Soo dug through the Colossus\u2019 rock-hard muscle with his swords. The feeling of having a needle pierce through one\u2019s belly button would be torturous for anyone, and the Colossus was no exception. Kang Yoon-Soo thought, \u2018It\u2019s still a humanoid no matter how large it is.\u2019\u201cKwaaaah!\u201d The Colossus let out a deafening roar and started to punch its own abdomen wildly. Eventually, it managed to successfully remove the intruder from within its belly button.\u201cKwaaaaah!\u201d The Colossus roared and swung its hand at the intruder who fell from its belly button.Kang Yoon-Soo tilted his wings and shifted his flight trajectory in mid-air, then muttered, \u201cDance of Death.\u201d He wildly swung all eight of his swords and slashed away at all five fingers of the Colossus\u2019 hand. Ignus managed to unleash her dragon breath at point-blank range thanks to the distraction Kang Yoon-Soo caused.\u201cKruuwaaaah!\u201d The Colossus roared in pain as the blazing, intense dragon flame burned its eyes.Kang Yoon-Soo flew so high up that he started to have difficulty breathing, muttering, \u201cThe Colossus\u2019 weakness is between its eyebrows.\u201dIgnus grimaced as if she found the human to be annoying, but she still opened her mouth and spat her dragon breath between the Colossus\u2019 eyes.Fwaaaaaa!The Colossus hurriedly covered its face with both hands, then threw a punch at the dragon\u2019s jaws after swatting away the dragon\u2019s breath. Ignus lost five of her fangs, and the Colossus grabbed her by the neck.Kwachik! Pukeok! Pukeok!The Colossus fiercely pounded the dragon with its fist, and the cruel sounds of the dragon\u2019s scales breaking reverberated across the desert. Blood dripped down on the battlefield, and Ignus\u2019 face was bruised and battered beyond recognition.\u201cO, Lord Dragon Ignus!\u201d the Spartoi cried out, but all they could do was watch helplessly as the Colossus continued to smash the dragon\u2019s face.The Fire Trolls and the elves watched the one-sided beating the dragon was receiving fearfully. They were witnessing the defeat of what was known to be the mightiest creature on the continent.\u201cDie, dragon!\u201d Kartheon shouted in glee as he raised both of his hands.The Colossus raised its bloodied fist high in the air as it prepared to deliver the final blow and put an end to the dragon\u2019s misery, but a demon suddenly landed between its eyes.\u201cAbsolute Zero,\u201d the demon muttered. An intense cold suddenly enveloped the spot between the Colossus\u2019 eyes. The Colossus roared as it slapped the spot where the demon was standing, but Kang Yoon-Soo nimbly avoided its hand with the help of his wings.\u201cIce Touch,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo muttered. His hands were enveloped with an intense chill, and his ice swords were further reinforced, becoming even sharper.\u201cAbyssal Sword,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said as he attacked the Colossus\u2019 weakness. His attack managed to break through the Colossus\u2019 thick, strong skin. His eight ice swords were drenched in the Colossus\u2019 blood and shone an eerie red.\u201cKwuaaaaaah!\u201d The Colossus roared in pain as it released its grip on the dragon\u2019s neck and wildly slammed its hand into its face.However, Kang Yoon-Soo flew around its face like an annoying but menacing bee, pouring out attack after attack. \u201cAbyssal Sword. Abyssal Sword. Abyssal Sword.\u201dThe bloodied ice swords let out waves of sparkling blood whenever Kang Yoon-Soo swung them. He successfully ripped apart the thick skin between the Colossus\u2019 eyes, suddenly revealing a large jewel. The Colossus\u2019 only weakness was finally exposed.\u201cGrwaaaaaah!\u201d The bloodied dragon charged at the Colossus while dripping blood all over the battlefield, and bit the Colossus between its eyes with her bloody fangs.The Colossus screamed and flailed its arms wildly as it attempted to shake off the dragon, but Ignus held on as long as she could until cracks started to form on the jewel embedded in the Colossus\u2019 forehead.\u201cKwuuhooooo!\u201d The Colossus roared as it staggered back. It looked at Kang Yoon-Soo with pleading eyes that seemed to say \u2018Please, don\u2019t!\u2019However, Kang Yoon-Soo dove down and stabbed the jewel with his swords, muttering, \u201cDie.\u201dKwachiiiiiiik!The jewel embedded in the Colossus\u2019 forehead broke, and its body fell backward. The desert ground shook as if an intense earthquake had occurred, and the desert was engulfed in an intense sandstorm caused by the enormous giant\u2019s collapse.Baaaaaaaam! Thud![You have destroyed the Colossus\u2019 guardian stone.][You have dealt the final blow against the Colossus.][It is an unbelievable achievement that has never before been accomplished by a mere human.][You have drawn the interest of the forces searching for a Demon King candidate.]The Colossus had died, and the Fire Trolls and the elves had witnessed a scene they could not believe even though it had unfolded right in front of their eyes.The first to open his mouth was the bloodied and ragged Yanak. He shouted, \u201cWooooaaaaaaa!\u201dThe Fire Troll\u2019s victory cry reverberated across the battlefield. It was only then that the other troops of the coalition army snapped back to their senses and let out their own victory cry, the sound sweeping across the battlefield.\u201cThe Colossus is dead!\u201d\u201cWe won! We\u2019ve won the war!\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve avenged the deaths of the elves!\u201dThe surviving coalition troops rejoiced and embraced each other, and the ancient king\u2019s army stopped their attacks and withdrew from the battlefield.The dragon Ignus closed her eyes in exhaustion and said, \u201cI will eat you if you cannot bring my child back to life after all of this.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I will,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said nonchalantly.\u201cDo not get too friendly with me, human,\u201d the dragon growled.\u201cIsn\u2019t it about time?\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.Ignus let out a laugh, as if she found the human in front of her unbelievable.Kang Yoon-Soo stared down at the Colossus\u2019 corpse and thought, \u2018It\u2019s a relief it was just an old Colossus that was asleep for so long.\u2019The Colossus they faced this time had exerted less than a tenth of a Colossus\u2019 true power. The Colossi residing in the magic tower were not beings that even a dragon would be able to face. In fact, if this Colossus had been a proper Colossus\u2026 Everyone and everything on the battlefield would have immediately been annihilated.\u2018I gained quite a lot of experience points,\u2019 Kang Yoon-Soo thought. He had only dealt the final blow, but he had gained a whopping 25 levels.Just as the coalition army was drunk on victory, however, the sound of clapping suddenly silenced the whole battlefield. The silence that fell across the battlefield felt so natural, it was as if someone had quieted a rowdy crowd before making a speech.Clap. Clap. Clap. Clap.The sound of a man clapping was the only thing that could be heard across the battlefield.\u201cAmazing! I am sincerely amazed!\u201d Kartheon exclaimed. The ancient king\u2019s voice reverberated across the entire battlefield, and the coalition army raised their guard as they looked at him.Kartheon did not pay heed to the onlookers as he looked up at Kang Yoon-Soo and said, \u201cTo think you would turn into a demon on top of calling a dragon to your side. Amazing! I will definitely uncover your identity after this war is over!\u201dThe dragon Ignus growled and said, \u201cShut your mouth and accept your defeat, you insignificant creature from the past!\u201d\u201cYou are right; this is my defeat,\u201d Kartheon said nonchalantly. However, his voice suddenly turned cold as he said, \u201cThat is why\u2026 Let us do it again.\u201dThe ancient king extended his left hand toward the dead Colossus and said, \u201cTime Resurrection.\u201d[You have consumed 50,000 units of temporal power.][You have consumed a great amount of temporal power to bring a creature back to life.][The target creature is too powerful.][The resurrection timer has increased.][Remaining temporal power: 60,213]The space around the dead Colossus started to distort, and it looked as if time were rewinding for the Colossus alone.[The dead Colossus, Raujan, is going back in time.][You will lose all experience points gained if the Colossus is successfully resurrected.][500 seconds left until the resurrection of the Colossus.]\u201cW-what the hell is that?!\u201d\u201cThe Colossus we went through hell to kill is coming back to life?!\u201d\u201cDamn it! We have to stop it!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019ll all be for nothing if that Colossus gets up again!\u201dThe elves cast their spells and drew their bows, and the Fire Trolls risked their lives to throw themselves toward the ancient king. However, Kartheon was already prepared for any attacks, commanding the mummies to surround and shield him from them.\u201cGrwaaaaaaah!\u201d Ignus roared and charged toward the ancient king.However, Kartheon leisurely muttered with a smile, \u201cThe walls are strong!\u201dThe mummies released a barrier as the ancient king cast his spell. It extended all the way into the air as it blocked Ignus\u2019 claws. Ignus unleashed her dragon breath, but it failed to create a dent on Kartheon\u2019s barrier.\u201cThis barrier will remain standing for half an hour, and nobody will be able to break through it!\u201d Kartheon confidently exclaimed behind the protection of the barrier and the mummies.The wounds on the Colossus\u2019 body started to regenerate, and it slowly began to rise to its feet.The coalition army despaired in the overwhelming presence of the ancient king. Who could win against that?\u201cNow, let us start the party again, shall we? Let us see who will die this time!\u201d Kartheon shouted while cackling. There were fewer than forty seconds remaining before the Colossus was fully revived.Kang Yoon-Soo suddenly said out of nowhere, \u201cYou will die.\u201d\u201cWhat is with your baseless confidence?\u201d Kartheon asked with a smirk.\u201cIt\u2019s not,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.Kartheon suddenly felt killing intent approaching him.Slash!A mummy carrying a black scythe suddenly slashed toward the ancient king from behind. The Time Resurrection spell on the Colossus was nearly interrupted, but Kartheon managed to keep channeling the spell.\u2018What?!\u2019 Kartheon thought inwardly. He had managed to avoid sustaining any critical injuries, because he had detected the attack before he was hit.However, a mummy in front of Kartheon suddenly spread mana threads out toward him. More than thirty combat dolls suddenly popped up out of nowhere and charged toward the ancient king.\u2018Damn it!\u2019 Kartheon thought.The other mummies ran up to Kartheon to shield him from the attacks, but one of the mummies suddenly lunged at the ancient king and slammed his head down into the sand.\u201cKuheok!\u201d The ancient king gasped at the sudden attack. It was a ridiculously strong blow that caved in his head.[The Time Resurrection has been canceled.][The temporal energy will not be refunded.]One mummy suddenly said, \u201cI thought I was going to die of suffocation.\u201d\u201cI know, right? Even though it\u2019s called \u2018infiltration\u2019, we\u2019ve been dressed as mummies since the start of the battle,\u201d the mummy carrying a scythe said with a sigh.Henrick undid the bandage wrapped around his body and wondered, \u201cBut why did that punk turn into a demon this time? Although it suits him too well\u2026\u201dKang Yoon-Soo stared at Kartheon\u2019s bloodied body on the ground, and told the ancient king something he had never heard before from anyone.\u201cYou can regress as much as you want.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, just as he was about to strike down Shaneth, who was disguised as a mummy, Henrick\u2019s combat dolls attacked him. The ancient king destroyed five combat dolls and called for his mummies to protect him, but Iris lunged at him and smashed him to pieces.[You have turned back time by 40 seconds.][You have used some of your temporal power.][You have turned back time fifty-six times in a short period of time.][Your body has received a significant amount of damage.]***Kang Yoon-Soo said, \u201cYou will die.\u201dKartheon hurriedly ran away, but he was blocked by the barrier that he himself had cast. The barrier that was supposed to protect him ended up stopping him from running away.\u201cDamn it!\u201d the ancient king screamed. He knew there was no escape for him, but he still punched the barrier in frustration. Henrick was the one to approach him this time and stab him through the heart.[You have turned back time by 40 seconds.][You have used some of your temporal power.][You have turned back time 94 times in a short period of time.][Your skin has started to break apart.]***Kang Yoon-Soo said, \u201cYou will die.\u201dThere was no way Kartheon would be troubled by insignificant weaklings like them if he had been at his original level. The barrier would remain for half an hour even if all of the mummies in it were killed. The ancient king could delay his death by commanding the mummies to block the assailants, but it would not change the outcome of his dying to them.\u2018There must be a way\u2026 There must be\u2026\u2019 Kartheon was racking his brains when Iris smashed his jaw with an uppercut.[You have turned back time by 40 seconds.][You have used some of your temporal power.][You have turned back time 178 times in a short period of time.][You will start experiencing severe migraines.]***Kang Yoon-Soo said, \u201cYou will die.\u201dKartheon gnashed his teeth, thinking, \u2018I cannot escape no matter what I do!\u2019The same event repeated over the course of 40 seconds.The same situation.The same enemy.The same death.Kartheon was about to go crazy, as the same situation had occurred over a hundred times.

The ancient king looked so pitiful and disgraceful that the title \u2018king\u2019 did not seem to suit him anymore.He had heard the same thing over and over again, every time he turned back time.You will die.You will die.You will die.You will die.It was an endless cycle he could not escape from. He experienced a hellish regression and a repeating nightmare.\u201cDamn it!\u201d Kartheon cursed and screamed. He felt as if he would go insane if he could not at least scream out his frustrations.Shaneth was surprised to see the ancient king looking so defeated, but she nevertheless raised her scythe and walked toward him. The sight of Shaneth walking toward Kartheon made him feel as if he were looking at the Grim Reaper himself.\u201cKuheok!\u201dThe scythe slashed across the ancient king\u2019s body and cut him in half.[You have turned back time by 40 seconds.][You have used some of your temporal power.][You have turned back time 349 times in a short period of time.][Your sense of smell has disappeared.]***Kang Yoon-Soo said, \u201cYou will die.\u201dKartheon fell to his knees.

It appeared to them that the ancient king had suddenly lost all will to fight, mere moments after confidently laughing as if he had already won the war.Kang Yoon-Soo asked coldly, \u201cHow many times did you regress?\u201d\u201c\u2026349 times,\u201d Kartheon answered.\u201cThat\u2019s not much,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo remarked.\u201c\u2026\u201d Kartheon was speechless.The coalition forces let out a victory cry, rejoicing in their success.\u201cWhooooooo!\u201dShaneth, Henrick, and Iris all approached Kartheon and bound him up.The mummies all returned to dust after their king lost the war, and the barrier that had been up for half an hour finally dissipated.Kang Yoon-Soo approached Kartheon, who was bound by his hands and feet. The ancient king asked him, \u201cYou\u2026 How long did you live before regressing?\u201d\u201c20 years,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied in a voice so low that nobody else would be able to hear him.Kartheon was at a loss for words. He had almost gone insane, going back in time by a mere 40 seconds 349 times, but this man had regressed 999 times and lived a period of 20 years each time?\u201c\u2026How are you still sane after all that?\u201d Kartheon asked in surprise.\u201cI\u2019ve already gone insane,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.Kartheon looked at the man, feeling even more thoroughly demoralized. He felt completely sick of the man as he said, \u201cAre you telling me you are insane right now?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve gone insane peacefully,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.\u201c\u2026I suppose that makes sense,\u201d Kartheon said, sounding defeated.Kang Yoon-Soo placed one ice sword on the ancient king\u2019s neck.Ignus impatiently roared, \u201cHurry! Kill Kartheon and bring my child back to life!\u201dKartheon bitterly laughed and murmured, \u201cKatz was right. I should not even have dreamed of regressing.\u201dRegression\u2026 Kartheon had only realized its futility after regressing multiple times. He thought, \u2018It was a foolish idea.\u2019The power to turn back time, returning to the past to right wrongs and make oneself immensely successful, sounded impressive and yet petty at the same time.\u2018Regression is just an act of abandoning one\u2019s world and stealing someone else\u2019s accomplishments,\u2019 Kartheon thought.To live through the same experience over and over.To steal someone else\u2019s accomplishments and punish those one disliked.There was no thrill or excitement in such a life; the only thing one might feel was a sense of futility.Kartheon finally admitted out loud, \u201cRegression is not an opportunity, in the end.\u201dKang Yoon-Soo prepared to deal the final blow and cut off the ancient king\u2019s head. However, he first said, \u201cIt might not sound that way to others, but it\u2019s different for those of us who have experienced it.\u201dKartheon reminisced about the life he had lived as he said, \u201cLiving life all over again is nothing but obtaining second-hand satisfaction from the accomplishments of others.\u201dKang Yoon-Soo nodded. Those were words only those who had regressed until they were sick of it would sympathize with.\u201cNow, kill me,\u201d Kartheon said as he closed his eyes. Kang Yoon-Soo lifted his ice sword and prepared to strike Kartheon.Suddenly, a voice shouted from the crowd, \u201cWait a minute! P-please! Just give me a minute!\u201d A man pushed his way through the crowd and stood in front of Kartheon. It was Katz.\u201cKatz\u2026? But why\u2026?\u201d Kartheon was flabbergasted by Katz\u2019s sudden appearance.Katz breathed deeply before exclaiming loudly, \u201cDon\u2019t kill him! Please don\u2019t kill Kartheon!\u201dThe trolls and the elves protested the man\u2019s request loudly.\u201cWhat the hell are you saying?!\u201d\u201cDo you know how many elves he killed?! Can you still say that after all this?!\u201dKatz bit his lips. He could not understand why he had suddenly done what he did, but he did not back down regardless of the reason. He shouted loudly once more, \u201cKartheon can resurrect the dead elves with his ability!\u201dThe eyes of the trolls and elves trembled, but they seemed skeptical about the idea. However, the bloodied dragon Ignus lowered her battered head to the ground and asked while staring at Katz, \u201cTell me, what are you thinking of?\u201d\u201cK-Kartheon can turn back time! He can only go back 40 seconds right now because his body hasn\u2019t fully recovered, but he can certainly do a lot more if he recovers his strength!\u201d Katz exclaimed, forcing the words out as he continued, \u201cWe should let Kartheon live until he recovers. Then, Kartheon can turn back time days, no, months to the point before the massacre occurred! The deaths of the elves will never have happened in the first place!\u201dThe trolls and the elves in the crowd murmured when they heard Katz\u2019s argument. However, Ignus scoffed and roared, \u201cWhat a foolish attempt! Do you really think he will repent for his sins and change his ways?! He is nothing but an evil creature. He will turn back time and meticulously prepare for this war once again, and attempt to annihilate the entire continent!\u201dKatz was speechless. However, Kartheon suddenly spoke up and said, \u201cNo, I will not turn back time even if I manage to recover my strength.\u201dKatz looked toward Kartheon in surprise and hurriedly said, \u201cHow can you say something like that right now?! You have to tell them you will right your wrongs!\u201d\u201cWere you not the one telling me about the futility of reversing time, Katz?\u201d Kartheon replied. Katz felt flabbergasted, looking dumbfounded by the ancient king\u2019s words.Kartheon no longer wanted to turn back time; no, rather, it was more proper to say that he had lost all his will to live. He said, \u201cI should not exist at this point in time. Indeed, I wish to embrace death once again and go back to a peaceful slumber this time.\u201d\u201cB-but\u2026!\u201d Katz tried to retort.\u201cEnough! You have stalled enough!\u201d Ignus roared in annoyance. She continued, \u201cKill Kartheon and bring my child to life before he decides to pull a trick using time!\u201dThe dragon lifted her claw and swiped at Kartheon. However, Katz remained steadfast, staying in front of the ancient king with his eyes closed as he prepared for his demise. In moments, he would be split in half by the dragon\u2019s claw.\u2018No!\u2019 Kartheon screamed inwardly, focusing his remaining strength into his eyes. It was at the very moment that Katz was about to be sliced apart that the ancient king\u2019s heart was moved for the first time. He thought, \u2018I cannot let him die\u2026!\u2019Suddenly, everything stopped.***Time stopped. Ignus\u2019 ferocious claw strike, Katz trembling in fear, the eyes of the crowd watching the spectacle in horror\u2026 Everything had stopped.The only ones still moving were Kartheon\u2014and one other person.Kartheon saw the human who was moving freely even while time was frozen, and he asked in surprise, \u201cHow are you moving?\u201d\u201cNo idea,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied as he looked around leisurely. He had been aware that Kartheon could stop time, but this was the first time he had experienced it firsthand.\u201cIt\u2019s amazing,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said, swinging an ice sword lightly. The blade broke into pieces like morning frost, its fragments sparkled in the air. In the place where time had stood still, everything seemed weaker.\u201cPlease move Katz,\u201d Kartheon pleaded.Kang Yoon-Soo stared at Kartheon. The ancient king was pleading and not commanding for the first time in his life. He asked, \u201cWhy should I?\u201d\u201cI do not know,\u201d Kartheon replied.Kang Yoon-Soo moved Katz into a position where the dragon\u2019s claw would not be able to reach him. Meanwhile, Kartheon started to slowly turn into dust starting from the tips of his feet. It was the side effect of his stopping time.\u201cYou have gone against the laws of time. That is why you can still move while time is frozen,\u201d Kartheon said.\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo asked.However, Kartheon coughed up blood and said, \u201cYou will find out what I mean by yourself even if I do not explain it to you.\u201d His breathing turned laborious as he continued, \u201cYou do not have the power to control time. How did you regress?\u201d\u201cDemon Lord,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied in a low and deep voice. He continued, \u201cI regressed because of the Demon Lord.\u201dKartheon said bitterly, \u201cI think I know what happened to you. You poor thing.\u201d\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo exclaimed with a frown.\u201cIs something different from your previous lives not happening right now?\u201d Kartheon asked. Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s eyes shot wide open and began trembling when he heard the ancient king\u2019s words. Kartheon slowly continued, \u201cThis will be your last life\u2026\u201d\u201cI know,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.\u201c\u2026and the Demon Lord will appear earlier this time,\u201d Kartheon finished.It was Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s first time hearing that. He could not hide his emotions, and his eyes trembled uncontrollably again. He walked up to Kartheon and grabbed the ancient king by the neck, asking angrily, \u201cWhat do you mean by that?!\u201d\u201cIt is just as I said. Even though the Demon Lord appeared before you consistently after 20 years, he will appear much earlier this time,\u201d Kartheon replied.\u201cTell me why,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.\u201cHmm\u2026 I wonder why\u2026?\u201d Kartheon replied slowly, as if he were exacting an act of petty revenge.Kang Yoon-Soo gripped Katz\u2019s neck and said threateningly, \u201cI\u2019ll kill this guy if you don\u2019t tell me why.\u201dOnly then did the ancient king answer him, saying, \u201cI met with the Demon Lord once at the magic tower.\u201d\u201cSo what?\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo asked.\u201cI almost lost everything after I picked a fight with the Demon Lord. I barely managed to survive; no, it is more fitting to say that the Demon Lord let me off,\u201d Kartheon said as his lower body crumbled to dust. His upper body was beginning to turn into dust as well by the time he continued, \u201cI learned to control time after I survived against the Demon Lord.\u201d\u201cGet to the point,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.\u201cGo to the magic tower where the Colossi reside,\u201d Kartheon said.Kang Yoon-Soo frowned. The magic tower of the Colossi was one of the two forbidden places on the continent, along with the lair of the Dragon of Destruction; they were places no one should even attempt visiting.\u201cWhy should I go there?\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo asked.\u201cThe one who killed me is in that magic tower. He will help solve your problems,\u201d Kartheon said.Kang Yoon-Soo could not understand what was going on, but he asked the ancient king, \u201cWhy did the change only occur during the thousandth life?\u201d\u201cSomeone is getting in your way so you will not be able to regress anymore. I cannot say anything else other than that,\u201d Kartheon said.Kang Yoon-Soo glared at the ancient king before grumbling, \u201cI didn\u2019t manage to get anything helpful out of you in the end.\u201d\u201cWhat did you expect from the villain?\u201d Kartheon retorted with a laugh as he was slowly dying. Kang Yoon-Soo grabbed his head as he was crumbling into dust, but Kartheon asked in an annoyed voice, \u201cCan you not just let me die peacefully?\u201d\u201cI have to get my rewards,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied before crushing the ancient king\u2019s head.The stopped flow of time started to move once again.[The ancient king has been defeated.][You have brought peace to the Desert of Death.]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 88": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Record of a Thousand LivesChapter 89Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe war had ended in a single day. The coalition forces were victorious, and the ancient king had been defeated. It was a victory they could never have dreamed of achieving if not for Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s command and leadership.\u201cWe\u2019re victorious!\u201d\u201cWe protected the desert from the ancient king!\u201dThe once-lifeless desert was filled with life as the coalition army roared and cheered. The trolls and the elves sat together, clinking their mugs and celebrating their victory. At some point, however, all of the coalition forces maintained a moment of silence to pay respect to those who were sacrificed in the war.Most people were drunk and joyful, but one man solemnly walked across the desert, leaving behind all of the festivities.\u2018It should be fine around here.\u2019Katz wiped the sweat off his brow and lowered the burden he had been carrying on his back. He had stopped in a beautiful place in the desert, filled with all sorts of flowers and plants. That was the place where all of the elves had worked, trying to revitalize the desert and return it to its former lush state.\u201cHey, mister, who are you?\u201d a voice called out.\u201cAck!\u201d Katz jumped back in surprise.A young elf suddenly came out of nowhere, having snuck up behind Katz. She asked, \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d\u201cUmm\u2026 I\u2019m giving fertilizer to the desert flowers,\u201d Katz said awkwardly.\u201cHm? You were going to take a dump?\u201d the elf asked.\u201cNo, no\u2026\u201d Katz said as he showed her a pot filled with bone dust. He continued, \u201cI heard bone dust was good for plants.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026 That\u2019s fine. Try not to hurt the plants when you spread it,\u201d the elf said before walking to another spot in the field.Katz let out a sigh of relief. He did not dare imagine how the elf would have reacted if she found out the bone dust belonged to Kartheon.\u201cDo something good, at least,\u201d he muttered as he spread the bone dust across the flower field, the flowers dancing in the wind. Katz did not have any specific reason to spread Kartheon\u2019s remains, and yet he did so anyway.\u201cI never considered for a moment that we were friends or something, and you did try to kill me a few times as well,\u201d Katz said, scratching his cheek. He continued, \u201cBut strangely enough\u2026 You were a pretty nice guy to me.\u201dKatz was aware that Kartheon was a villain, and that he had massacred numerous innocent victims. Regardless, he muttered, \u201cYou were the one who helped me when the dragon was about to step on me, right? I was alive after I blinked. You stopped time, didn\u2019t you?\u201dOf course, that was nowhere near enough to justify all of the atrocities Kartheon had committed, and presenting a criminal as a saint would not absolve them for the crimes they had committed. However, Katz decided to remember Kartheon in a good light regardless.\u201cI\u2019ll keep it to myself anyway; what\u2019s the problem?\u201d Katz remarked with a bitter smile. He was only going to get an extra ten years in prison if they ever found out about his involvement, since he was already wanted as a graverobber anyway.Katz finished spreading the bone dust and said, \u201cHey, Kartheon. Wasn\u2019t I a good companion to you, at least?\u201dThere was no response.Katz took out a plant seedling from his bag. It was a plant that was incredibly difficult to find in the desert. Then, he placed the rare seedling in the middle of the desert flowers to mark the ancient king\u2019s resting place.\u201cCome to think of it\u2026 What was written on your tombstone\u2026?\u201d Katz wondered, scratching his head. He realized they had never gotten the chance to finish their conversation regarding what Kartheon would have wanted to be inscribed on his tombstone later on.\u201cI guess I just have to make it up,\u201d Katz muttered as he took out his graverobbing equipment. He took out his lockpicking set, using the sharp edge of a lockpick to engrave words into the wood supporting the rare plant seedling as a makeshift tombstone for the ancient king.[In remembrance of the king who stopped time for an insignificant graverobber.]Who knew? Perhaps the ancient king\u2019s burial site would one day transform the desert into a lush, green forest.The desert flowers danced along with the wind that blew across the Desert of Death.***The Colossus\u2019 corpse had turned to dust and disappeared without a trace. The Colossus had been sealed for too long, and its body crumbled into dust as soon as its lifeforce faded.[You have completed the \u2018Legendary Quest\u2014Emperor of Time\u2019.]That message had popped up from Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s wrist device as soon as he killed Kartheon, and he had also been notified of his rewards for completing the legendary quest.[Please choose between the Authority of Domination or the Authority of Time.]Kang Yoon-Soo had already experienced obtaining each of the authorities through his multiple regressions. The Authority of Domination would give him the powers to command the mummies that followed Kartheon. It had been a very good reward, but the mummies this time around had been reduced from the original seven thousand to just a few hundred because of the war. He also knew from experience that the Authority of Time was the better reward.\u201cAuthority of Time,\u201d he muttered.[You may obtain one of the skills used by Kartheon to control time.]Three skills popped up.[Time Regression][Time Resurrection][Time Freeze]\u2018Time Regression\u2019 was a skill that meant exactly what its name said, allowing the user to control and turn back time. However, Kang Yoon-Soo was someone who would be driven berserk just by the mention of the word \u2018regress\u2019. Besides, he had once attempted to fight against the Demon Lord with the \u2018Time Regression\u2019 skill, but all it had done was mentally scar him.\u2018Time Freeze\u2019 was a skill anyone would dream of getting, but the cost of stopping time was too high. Stopping time for even just a second was enough to leave one bedridden for a whole week.Kang Yoon-Soo ended up choosing \u2018Time Resurrection\u2019.[Time Resurrection (MASTER)]Skill Level: 15 (100.00%)Temporal Power Consumed: 50,000Allows the user to reverse time for a corpse and bring it back to life. The user may even resurrect a historical figure or a hideous monster only spoken of in mythology.*The casting time will increase the more powerful the target is and the longer the target has been dead.[You have obtained the temporal power left unused by Kartheon.][You have obtained 50,017 units of temporal power.]Time Resurrection was a very useful skill. It would even give Kang Yoon-Soo the option to resurrect an Archmage from the past or a famous knight to add to his party. However, the skill did not allow him to resurrect himself, and it consumed a whopping 50,000 units of temporal power to use.\u2018I can\u2019t collect temporal power like Kartheon did.\u2019To put it simply, it was a one-off skill. The temporal power transferred to Kang Yoon-Soo was worth approximately 50,000 units. He would never be able to use the skill again after using it once.\u2018But I have to use it now.\u2019Ignus glared at Kang Yoon-Soo with an impatient, longing gaze. She roared, \u201cYou! Be careful! Be extra careful not to hurt my child!\u201d\u201cShut up,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo retorted.\u201cI\u2019m just worried, that\u2019s all!\u201d Ignus said with tears in her eyes.Kang Yoon-Soo extended his right hand toward the dead egg and muttered, \u201cTime Resurrection.\u201dThe cold, lifeless egg was enveloped in bright light, quickly recovering its warmth as time turned back for it.Ignus asked impatiently, \u201cDid it work? Will my child be able to live?\u201d\u201cWait,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied curtly.The large, round egg slowly started to tremble. The eggshell started to crack, bursting with fluid as a small red baby dragon peeked its head out of the egg. The baby dragon cried, \u201cKwak!\u201d\u201cMy child!\u201d Ignus cried, licking the baby dragon intensely.Shaneth sniffled as she said, \u201cThis is so touching\u2026\u201d\u201cYeah,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.\u201cThen at least let it show on your face\u2026?\u201d Shaneth replied as she stared at Kang Yoon-Soo.\u201cI. Just. Can\u2019t,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo responded.Shaneth playfully displayed her fist as she remarked, \u201cDo you want me to make you cry?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo responded curtly, seemingly showing disdain for the touching scene.Henrick, on the other hand, lamented while hanging onto the dragon\u2019s back, \u201cPlease! Stop moving! You\u2019re making it difficult for me to stitch you up!\u201dHenrick was dangling in midair while trying to attach the dragon\u2019s wing to her body, with the Body Crafting Kit attached to a spear. The spear was connected to his mana threads, and he was trying to stitch the wing back onto Ignus with it.\u201cHey! You punks down there! Hold the wing properly, will you?!\u201d Henrick shouted.\u201cWe\u2019re trying our best!\u201d Yanak retorted angrily.The Fire Trolls were holding up the dragon\u2019s wing while Henrick was trying to stitch it back on.Iris looked on with a worried expression, shouting, \u201cHenrick! Hurry up! There is no time!\u201d\u201cWhat? What are you talking about?\u201d Henrick asked in surprise.Iris shouted back sincerely, \u201cThere are only ten minutes left before the feast begins!\u201d\u201cHey! You punk! Do you think work on this scale is easy?!\u201d Henrick retorted angrily.The sun started to set. The elves had prepared a feast that was an uncommon sight in the desert, and the Fire Trolls devoured the food with an intensity that matched their fighting during the war.Kang Yoon-Soo said, \u201cGive me alcohol.\u201d\u201cThis is a mixture of desert dew and cactus,\u201d Heron said with a smile as he poured Kang Yoon-Soo a cup.Henrick finally finished reattaching the dragon\u2019s wing. He climbed from the dragon\u2019s back and remarked, \u201cIt\u2019s been a while I worked on something so major; the last time was when I sculpted the Third Emperor\u2019s sculpture.\u201dAs Henrick stretched his tired shoulders, a beautiful red-haired woman with a shiny amulet stuck between her voluptuous breasts walked up to his side and poured him a drink. She said, \u201cI am sincerely grateful to you, Henrick.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m the one who should be thankful since you\u2019re pouring me a drink, but how did you hurt your beautiful face, milady?\u201d Henrick asked, before suddenly realizing that everyone else in the crowd except for Kang Yoon-Soo had their mouths wide open in shock. He realized something was off, and he turned around to see that Ignus had disappeared.\u201cMilady\u2026 D-don\u2019t tell me\u2026?\u201d Henrick stuttered.\u201cIt is more efficient to transform into a smaller creature when I have to recover,\u201d Ignus replied.\u201c\u2026To think I would live to drink booze poured by a dragon. Nothing can surprise me from here onward,\u201d Henrick said with an awkward smile before downing the drink in one go.Ignus, now in her human form, hugged the baby dragon. \u201cKiyuuuk!\u201d the baby dragon cried.\u201cHow lovely you are,\u201d Ignus said, looking at the baby dragon with eyes filled with affection and motherly love.The onlookers were surprised to witness the sudden change by the dragon who had displayed unmatched ferocity in the war, but her gentleness made the coalition army relax and fully enjoy the feast.Yanak filled Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s cup to the brim and expressed his gratitude, \u201cThank you! Groom of the goddess! We would all have been massacred if it weren\u2019t for you!\u201dKang Yoon-Soo, who had led the coalition army to victory against the ancient king, was the center of attention of the feast; that was why people were lining up to take turns pouring him a drink.Shaneth looked on, seemingly unhappy with what was going on. As always, she nagged, \u201cDon\u2019t drink too much.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re the ones pouring it,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo nonchalantly replied to justify(?) his drinking.Henrick smirked, his nose red from intoxication, and exclaimed, \u201cThat guy\u2019s on cloud nine!\u201d He turned to Ignus and added, \u201cAh, right\u2026 Is your wing alright? I can\u2019t see it because you\u2019re in your human form right now.\u201dIgnus nodded and replied, \u201cIt did not fall off because you did a great job putting it back together. You are quite skilled, Henrick.\u201d\u201cWell, I\u2019ll gladly accept your praise, but we aren\u2019t kids like the rest, right? I was hoping a more tangible form of gratitude could be expressed\u2026\u201d Henrick began, before Shaneth elbowed him hard in the ribs.Pukeok!\u201cHeup!\u201d Henrick exclaimed.\u201cOh look, you seem to be very drunk, Mister Henrick,\u201d Shaneth said with an innocent expression.\u201cYou punk! I won\u2019t have any ribs left because of you!\u201d Henrick cried angrily while moaning in pain.Ignus rubbed her lips as she muttered, \u201cA tangible reward\u2026\u201d She then looked at the child she was embracing and asked, \u201cMy child, do you not think you need a new daddy?\u201d\u201cKiyuk?\u201d the baby dragon replied, tilting its head.The feast quieted down all of a sudden. The onlookers, wide-eyed with shock, all focused on Ignus and Henrick.Henrick immediately sobered up upon hearing the dragon\u2019s remark, stuttering, \u201cW-What did you just say\u2026?\u201d\u201cI was kidding. It is fun to mingle with other races from time to time,\u201d the Ignus Dragon replied with a laugh.Henrick whispered to Shaneth, \u201cWhat do you think would happen if I were the first man in history to have sex with a dragon?\u201d\u201cDream on,\u201d Shaneth replied sharply.\u201cI was just kidding, you punk. Why are you looking at me like that?\u201d Henrick asked with a frown.\u201cI think half of it was sincere,\u201d Shaneth replied.\u201cWell\u2026 Maybe thirty percent\u2026?\u201d Henrick said seriously.Pukeok!\u201cHeup!\u201d Henrick moaned in pain.Kang Yoon-Soo kept drinking while staring intently at Ignus. Suddenly, he said, \u201cI plan to go to the lair of the Dragon of Death.\u201d\u201cThe Dragon of Death?\u201d Ignus repeated with a scoff. She continued, \u201cThat fellow is considered a disaster even among us dragons.\u201d\u201cI know,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.\u201cEven a dragon would not survive a trip to that guy\u2019s lair,\u201d Ignus said.\u201cI said I know,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo repeated.Ignus raised a brow before asking, \u201cYou know about it, and yet you are still planning to go there?\u201d\u201cI have business over there,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.In truth, even Kang Yoon-Soo had wanted to avoid the lair of the Dragon of Death. It was the only place on the continent that was as dangerous as the magic tower where the Colossi resided. He had gone to the lair a few times in his previous lives, but he had always avoided going there if he had the option not to because of how dangerous it was.\u2018I don\u2019t have a choice in this life.\u2019It was true that it would be very dangerous and that he could be killed by the dragon, but that also meant the rewards were going to be as great as the risks.\u2018Also, Kartheon\u2019s final words were concerning.\u2019Would the Demon Lord appear much earlier? Why would that happen all of a sudden?Kang Yoon-Soo gripped his cup and thought, \u2018Things are getting much more complicated.\u2019He had thought that all he had to do was put in his best effort to grow as strong as possible until the Demon Lord appeared twenty years later, but what if the Demon Lord did appear earlier as Kartheon had said? If what the ancient king had said was true, he had to kick it up a notch from now on.\u2018The problem is\u2026 I don\u2019t know when he\u2019ll appear\u2026\u2019It would not be strange if the Demon Lord appeared the next day all of a sudden, if what Kartheon had said was true.\u201cWhen are you planning to go to the lair of the Dragon of Death?\u201d Ignus asked.\u201cI\u2019ll go after visiting a few other places,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.\u201cThe Dragon of Death is still hibernating. Do not do anything foolish and wake him up from his slumber,\u201d Ignus warned him.\u201cThat\u2019s why I need your scale, you who gave birth to the Dragon of Death\u2019s child,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.\u201c\u2026How did you know about that?\u201d Ignus seemed stunned by Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s words. Kang Yoon-Soo just quietly sipped from his cup. Ignus shook her head, seemingly having given up as she remarked, \u201cYou are quite the mysterious one\u2026\u201d\u201cThis will be more effective than my scales,\u201d Ignus eventually said, tossing the shiny amulet she was wearing toward Kang Yoon-Soo. He easily caught it out of the air.The feast continued until after the sun had set, only ending after most of the attendees were too intoxicated to even stay awake.Ignus reverted to her original form before saying, \u201cThank you, Kang Yoon-Soo.\u201d The mighty dragon bowed her head toward the human.Then, Shaneth heard a voice whisper in her mind, \u2018It is an unwritten rule that dragons do not get involved in the battles of other races.\u2019 Ignus was directly communicating in her mind; that was only possible because Shaneth had absorbed the dragon\u2019s power fragment.\u2018But you broke that rule?\u2019 Shaneth replied in her mind.\u2018That guy was quite convincing,\u2019 Ignus replied.\u2018That\u2019s the way he is,\u2019 Shaneth said.\u2018I cooperated because the enemy this time was someone who controlled time, and it was necessary to fight to be able to bring my child back to life. Do not expect any miracles to help you out in the future,\u2019 Ignus said.\u2018Of course,\u2019 Shaneth replied firmly.\u2018You have inherited a fragment of my powers. Continue following that man in his travels, and you will one day be stronger than I am,\u2019 Ignus said.\u2018Huh? Do you mean me? I\u2019ll be stronger than you?\u2019 Shaneth exclaimed in surprise.\u2018Believe in your own powers,\u2019 Ignus said. She then hugged her child tight and flew off into the sky.Yanak, Heron, and the rest of the coalition forces bowed their heads multiple times toward Kang Yoon-Soo, repeatedly expressing their gratitude.Kang Yoon-Soo said, \u201cWe\u2019ll be leaving the desert now.\u201dHenrick replied, stretching his tired and drunken body, \u201cIs it finally over?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s finally over,\u201d Shaneth said.\u201cThat is a relief, but I had hoped we could stay a bit longer,\u201d Iris said.The Desert of Death was a barren and tough environment, but it had gifted them with unbelievable memories they would never be able to forget.Henrick suddenly asked, \u201cAh, didn\u2019t you say we would fight with the dragon Ignus before we came to this desert?\u201d\u201cWe fought together, didn\u2019t we?\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.\u201c\u2026You meant we would fight on the same side?\u201d Henrick asked, looking stunned.\u201cYeah,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied nonchalantly.Henrick quietly took out his sculpting knife, and even the kind and innocent Iris did not try to stop him this time. Suddenly, Shaneth grabbed Henrick\u2019s shoulder and said, \u201cKill him.\u201dHowever, Kang Yoon-Soo was already miles ahead of them. Henrick ran furiously toward him as he screamed, \u201cI\u2019ll kill you today no matter what it takes!\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to die,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied, and the two played cat and mouse under the desert moonlight.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His companions were still fast asleep, and he was the only one awake. He walked some distance from their camp before falling to one knee.\u201cKuheok!\u201d He vomited blood, sensing that his body was in an abnormal state.The Frost Demon\u2019s Winter Fragment had allowed him to transform into a Frost Demon to fight the Colossus. His body had returned to its normal state afterward, but the price he had to pay manifested as unending curses that fell on him every night he tried to sleep. The fragment deep inside his body moved to stab his lungs.\u2018I can never get used to this.\u2019 Kang Yoon-Soo barely managed to get up by holding onto a boulder, but he struggled just to stay standing.\u201cKuheok\u2026\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo vomited blood again, and its metallic taste filled his mouth. He felt as if his lungs and heart were being shredded to pieces.\u2018Why did you abandon me?\u2019 A child\u2019s voice, sounding sufficiently eerie and sinister to give one goosebumps, asked from behind.Kang Yoon-Soo closed his eyes. He was drenched in cold sweat, but he told himself, \u2018That\u2019s just a hallucination. Don\u2019t mind it.\u2019\u2018I\u2019m asking you\u2026 Why did you abandon me?\u2019 the child asked again.The child\u2019s question pierced through Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s heart like a stake. He could not take it anymore, and he slowly opened his eyes. What he saw was a bloodied child, with a face so dark and disfigured as to be unrecognizable.\u201cI\u2019ve already forgotten you,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.\u2018You brought me into this world. I\u2019m your child,\u2019 the child cried out. It was the child he could no longer see even if he wanted to; the one he had had in the life when he married Shaneth.Kang Yoon-Soo bit his lips until they started to bleed before saying, \u201cGet lost.\u201d\u2018Why did you have me if you were going to forget about me? You couldn\u2019t even protect me,\u2019 the child moaned.\u201cI said get lost,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said threateningly as he grabbed his sword. It was only then that the child disappeared.He gripped his chest, trying to stabilize his breathing. \u2018Hang on. It\u2019ll only get even harder if you give in.\u2019Time passed, and the sun eventually started to rise on the horizon, chasing away the darkness. Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s pain and suffering subsided as the sun rose.\u2018I guess that\u2019s it for tonight,\u2019 he thought, wiping the sweat off his brow. His whole body was drenched in cold sweat; he had to go through the same nightmare every night.\u2018I have to hang on,\u2019 he thought as he rubbed his temples.The curse did not only inflict physical turmoil, but also made one hallucinate and relive one\u2019s worst memories.\u2018I have to tough it out,\u2019 Kang Yoon-Soo kept repeating in his head. He had to tough it out, because this was his last life.\u201cDo you need another drink?\u201d someone called out. Kang Yoon-Soo looked in its direction, only to find Henrick staring down at him. Henrick continued, \u201cI came to take a leak and almost pissed myself. Hey, what are you squirming in pain for?\u201d\u201cGive me some booze,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.Henrick took out a large whiskey bottle from his inner pocket. Oddly enough, his inner pocket seemed to have some sort of magic, as it was able to store multiple large bottles without them cracking even a little.He remarked with a smirk, \u201cIt\u2019s an alcoholic\u2019s trade secret.\u201dKang Yoon-Soo drank straight from the bottle without even bothering to look for a cup. Henrick sat beside him, opening a small bottle of whiskey as he said, \u201cKeh! Even the booze tastes better now that we\u2019re no longer in the desert, especially since I don\u2019t have sand all over my mouth now.\u201dIt had been four days since they left the Desert of Death.The two women were already awake by the time Kang Yoon-Soo and Henrick returned to the campsite. Shaneth glared at them like a ferocious cat, exclaiming, \u201cYou guys went to drink at this hour?\u201dHenrick shrugged and replied, \u201cIt has a deep meaning when two men share a drink before sunrise.\u201dIris\u2019 eyes suddenly sparkled and she asked excitedly, \u201cAre Henrick and Kang Yoon-Soo in love with each other?\u201d\u201c\u2026I didn\u2019t mean it like that, you punk,\u201d Henrick grumbled.Shaneth looked away from the two drunks and said firmly, \u201cYou leave me with no choice. Both of you have to abstain from any alcohol until tomorrow. Here, put all your alcohol in here.\u201dShe subsequently confiscated all of their alcohol, closing the bag filled to the brim with bottles before saying, \u201cI\u2019ll be keeping this bag of alcohol from now on.\u201d\u201cNow you\u2019re trying to control when and where we can drink? Are you our mom or something?\u201d Henrick grumbled.\u201cYou two drink too much. What if you suddenly fall from your horse because you were drunk? What will you do then?\u201d Shaneth retorted.Henrick flinched, unable to find a response. However, Kang Yoon-Soo secretly retrieved a bottle that was filled with colorless alcohol.The party passed through Raviesk, a city they had already visited, before continuing on to a new area. They collected their carriage, but found that they could not ride it because of the rugged, uneven terrain before them. Thus, they had to travel on horseback.Iris hugged her white horse tightly and said, \u201cI am so happy to see you again, Snow White!\u201d\u201cI completely forgot about that horse. I\u2019m surprised you remembered it,\u201d Henrick said.Iris glared at Henrick while stroking the white horse\u2019s mane, and the horse neighed as if to show that it liked Iris.Kang Yoon-Soo took out an amulet from his backpack.[Amulet of the Dragon Ignus]Rating: ??A great power is sealed within it, but only a dragon can unseal its powers.It was the amulet he had been given by Ignus. It had a red jewel embedded in the center, engraved with the symbol of a dragon\u2019s claw. It was an item that was certainly going to help in the near future. In fact, it was the perfect item for Shaneth to use, but its powers were sealed for the moment.\u2018I guess I have to use it for the time being,\u2019 Kang Yoon-Soo thought as he wore the amulet around his neck. He had gained an astounding forty levels in the Desert of Death, and he was Level 217 now. He could have increased his level faster if he had roamed around the places with dense concentrations of monsters and hunted all night, but raising only his level had not been his main objective.\u2018It\u2019s imperative for me to collect all the hidden pieces while others don\u2019t know of their existence,\u2019 Kang Yoon-Soo thought.He placed a greater priority on raising his overall strength, not obsessing over his level the way other Travelers did. A high level was meaningless if he did not have the items to back it up, and the reverse would be true as well.\u2018A powerful item can overcome the level difference in some cases,\u2019 Kang Yoon-Soo thought, biting his lips. \u2019Twenty years isn\u2019t nearly enough to do all that, and yet the Demon Lord will be appearing much sooner?\u2019He had originally planned to maximize those twenty years to prepare to the fullest before facing the Demon Lord. However, he knew he would not stand a chance if the Demon Lord appeared earlier than before. In fact, the world would surely be destroyed if the Demon Lord appeared tomorrow.\u2018Kartheon said someone who could solve the problem was at the magic tower,\u2019 Kang Yoon-Soo thought. He recalled one person, whom he suspected to be the one Kartheon had been talking about. There was only one individual who lived in the highly dangerous magic tower. \u2018The King of All Beings, Sirian.\u2019Would Sirian really have the solution to the problem? The only way to find out was to reach the magic tower and ask him in person.\u2018Whatever may happen, I have to give it my all this time, to not have any regrets\u2014it\u2019s my final life, after all.\u2019Kang Yoon-Soo felt slightly relieved after going over his thoughts once more, and his objectives had become even clearer.\u2018I\u2019ll definitely kill the Demon Lord this time.\u2019Just as Kang Yoon-Soo was lost in thought, however\u2026\u201cNeighhhhh!\u201dThe party stopped their horses, as a group of people in official attire was blocking their way. A large man came forward, displaying the insignia of a falcon as he said, \u201cI am sorry to bother you during your busy travels. My name is Halven, and I am an investigator from the Sharphill Investigation Department. I wish to carry out an inspection, and I hope you will cooperate with us.\u201d\u201cAn inspection? Did something happen?\u201d Shaneth asked.\u201cThere have been numerous cases of Travelers going missing in these parts. It is just a routine inspection, so please do not worry about it,\u201d Halven replied.Several junior investigators asked the party a few questions and searched them. Afterward, Shaneth tilted her head and asked, \u201cWere you talking about the Travelers from another world, rather than the travelers who travel between cities?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Halven replied, rubbing his tired eyes ringed by dark circles. He continued, \u201cThis place is where the forest and the river meet, so there are few pedestrians here; however, quite a few Travelers have been reported to have gone missing in these parts.\u201d\u201cThat really does sound strange\u2026 To think that only Travelers are going missing\u2026\u201d Shaneth mused.\u201cWe currently suspect this to be the work of those who discriminate between Continentals and Travelers. Well, it happens quite often, in any case; I think the higher-ups are overreacting by asking us to establish checkpoints all over,\u201d Halven grumbled.Halven seemed to be quite bored, as he chatted away long after explaining all the relevant details. The inspectors did not find anything suspicious during their inspection, but Halven saw the wrist device Kang Yoon-Soo wore and said, \u201cI hope you can take care of yourself. I have heard that you Travelers have a different way of thinking from us Continentals, and you guys love to take risks.\u201dKang Yoon-Soo stared at Halven before saying, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you where to find the culprits of the three major unsolved missing cases, and where evidence against them can be found.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Halven exclaimed in surprise.\u201cJust make the report. You can keep the achievements and merits for yourself, but in return, you have to send a 1st Grade inspector team a week from now. A black magician who\u2019s spreading plagues is involved,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Halven asked with a look of deep confusion.Kang Yoon-Soo moved his hand to his inner pocket. Halven flinched at the sudden movement, but what Kang Yoon-Soo took out was just a pen and paper.\u201cThe culprits are still alive, and one of them is affiliated with the upper echelons of the investigation department,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said as he quickly wrote something on the paper and passed it to Halven.Halven was still dumbfounded as he received the paper, but his expression suddenly turned serious and sharp after he read the contents of the note.\u201c\u2026You, where did you get this information? This is top-secret, confidential information that even a senior inspector would not have access to,\u201d Halven said.\u201cI\u2019ll give you one piece of advice. There are many secret executives in the investigation department, and most of them have been carrying out their own investigations covertly,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.\u201cThen that means\u2026!\u201d Halven exclaimed, gulping dryly.Kang Yoon-Soo nodded and responded, \u201cThat\u2019s right; I\u2019m one of them.\u201d\u201cBut I have never heard of a Traveler being an inspector before\u2026\u201d Halven trailed off, expressing his skepticism.\u201cThere are quite a lot of cases that only a Traveler can investigate. Also, there are quite a few of us Travelers working undercover as well,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.Halven could not hide his shock and admiration, but he scratched his head in embarrassment as he said, \u201cBut I am not sure whether I can claim this achievement as mine\u2026 This is a case you spent so much time investigating, after all\u2026\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t wish to draw the attention of the masses,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.Halven and the junior inspectors all looked at Kang Yoon-Soo, their eyes filled with admiration. To think that this man would give up all fame and stay undercover! Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s conviction as an inspector kindled the fire of justice they had all once had when they first started working as investigators.\u201cWhat is your name?\u201d Halven asked.\u201cMy name is Kang Yoon-Soo, but you absolutely have to keep our meeting a secret no matter what,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied..\u201cAh, but there is something that is bothering me,\u201d Halven said. He rubbed his chin as he continued, \u201cEven if it is an undercover investigation\u2026 Do you not usually carry an ID with you, like the falcon insignia I carry around to prove that I am a 4th Grade inspector? If you do not mind, would you kindly show me your identification?\u201dKang Yoon-Soo took out the amulet and showed it to Halven. Halven and the junior inspectors could not hide their shock as they exclaimed, \u201cThe Zero Grade Dragon\u2019s Claw Amulet!\u201d\u201cIs this enough?\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo asked nonchalantly.\u201cY-Yes! The claw engraved looks quite real, just like the real thing from a dragon,\u201d Halven stuttered, unable to hide his admiration.There were a total of nine grades for inspectors, and each grade was symbolized by an animal engraved on their ID. The Zero Grade Dragon\u2019s Claw Amulet was a powerful insignia that allowed the holder to move a whole department on a whim, and it was something that only a few skilled inspectors possessed.Halven could not hide his disappointment as he lamented, \u201cTo think that someone like you, sir, has to be hidden among the masses\u2026 It is really a shame\u2026\u201d\u201cIt makes it easier for me to investigate cases,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said before he and his party mounted their horses again.Halven and the junior inspectors saluted Kang Yoon-Soo, and Kang Yoon-Soo returned the salute before he rode off on his horse.Shaneth quietly asked after they were a distance away from the inspectors, \u201cOf course, there\u2019s no way you are, but\u2026 Are you really an undercover investigator?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.\u201cYou asshole. Aren\u2019t you scared of divine punishment after pulling a scam on everyone you meet?\u201d Henrick grumbled.\u201cNo,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.\u201cKang Yoon-Soo is really knowledgeable. Then, do you know which is more delicious? An apple pie or a meat pie?\u201d Iris asked.\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.Iris felt dejected due to the cold response. Shaneth let out an awkward laugh as she consoled Iris. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, unni! I\u2019ll make both of them for you later.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Iris asked, smiling.Kang Yoon-Soo suddenly heard a familiar voice whisper in his ears.\u2018Stop your horse.\u2019He looked around, but he did not see anyone. However, he was certain that the voice belonged to the familiar woman who had whispered to him before, and he was the only one who could hear the voice, as always.\u2018You have finally arrived. Stop your horse and come to me. This way.\u2019Kang Yoon-Soo stopped his horse and turned to look at the three people behind him. He said, \u201cI\u2019ll be going somewhere for a while.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Henrick asked.\u201cI have someone to meet. It\u2019ll take a while,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied. He hurriedly steered his horse to the left.Shaneth quickly asked him, \u201cWhere will we meet?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll find you guys wherever you are,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied before riding his horse into the forest.Henrick nodded in admiration before saying, \u201cI truly respect that guy.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d Shaneth asked.Henrick pointed at Shaneth\u2019s horse, and Shaneth looked down to see\u2014the bag of alcohol was missing.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Not many people dared to drink alcohol while riding a horse, but Kang Yoon-Soo did not have any difficulties maneuvering his horse even though he was drinking while riding.\u2018I have to figure out the identity of the voice.\u2019Numerous things had changed in his 1,000th life: The White Shadow that knew his secrets, this being his final life, the Demon Lord appearing earlier than before, and the voice that had prophesied the changes happening.\u2018I just know where to go.\u2019Kang Yoon-Soo had suddenly known where to go as soon as he heard the voice whisper; it had felt as if someone had planted the location in his head. He pushed his horse to run faster.\u201cNeighhhhh!\u201dThe Sword of Revelation that hung by Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s waist started to vibrate wildly, and its white blade suddenly started to shine as he passed through a densely overgrown forest and arrived at a vast lake.\u2018This place is\u2026\u2019Kang Yoon-Soo looked around and saw that clean, beautiful white sand lined the lakeshore, and the water was as clear as a mirror.\u2018I\u2019ve never seen this lake before\u2026\u2019It would not have been an exaggeration to say that there was no place in the continent that Kang Yoon-Soo was unaware of. That could only mean one thing\u2014this was not a place anyone could enter through normal means.Kang Yoon-Soo dismounted from his horse and walked along the edges of the lake.\u2018It\u2019s quiet. Am I the only one here?\u2019The lake was surprisingly clear and clean, but at the same time, it was so eerily quiet that not even a bird\u2019s cries could be heard. It gave off a sense of being beautiful yet ominous at the same time.Tap\u2026 Tap\u2026Kang Yoon-Soo looked down into the lake. The lake was so clear and transparent that he could easily see all the way to the bottom, but there was not a single fish in the lake. He dipped his finger into the lake when a voice suddenly spoke to him from behind.\u201cDo not defile the holy water, you insignificant creature.\u201dKang Yoon-Soo instantly turned around, but there was nobody behind him.\u201cAre you stupid? Over here! Over here!\u201d the voice called out from above.Kang Yoon-Soo looked up and saw a naked woman floating in mid-air, flapping a pair of white wings. He asked, \u201cWhat are you?\u201d\u201cCan you not tell?\u201d the woman replied.\u201cYou must be an angel,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.\u201cYes,\u201d the angel replied. Kang Yoon-Soo looked away from the naked angel, and she tilted her head in confusion before asking, \u201cWhat is with your reaction?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo asked.\u201cHumans do not usually react the way you do! They usually faint in surprise or get down on their knees,\u201d the angel said, playing with her hair that was as bright as the sun. She continued, \u201cUhmm\u2026 You\u2026 Do you not have anything to ask me?\u201d\u201cWere you the one who whispered to me?\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo asked.\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d the angel asked in response.However, Kang Yoon-Soo realized that the voice that had spoken to him had a dignified tone, different from that of the angel who was currently speaking. Thus, he was no longer interested in the angel and he began walking along the edges of the lake once again.\u201cWhat? Are you really not interested in me?\u201d the angel asked.\u201cNo,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.The angel flapped her wings and followed Kang Yoon-Soo around as she said, \u201cI have never seen such an indifferent human as you. You have piqued my interest. Tell me, you insignificant lesser creature, how did you enter this place?\u201dKang Yoon-Soo simply ignored her. The angel\u2019s eyes widened in shock as she protested, \u201cAre you ignoring me?!\u201dKang Yoon-Soo ignored her protest again and asked, \u201cWhat is this place?\u201d\u201cThis is one of the thirteen Angelic Temples,\u201d the angel proudly answered.\u201cAngelic Temple?\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo mused, rubbing his chin. He felt as if he had once visited a place that had the same atmosphere as this place, but he had never known that it was actually called an \u2018Angelic Temple\u2019.\u201cThere is going to be a feast here today. The other angels are lazy, but I am the most diligent one among them, which is why I am here early before the feast starts,\u201d the angel proudly declared.Kang Yoon-Soo ignored the angel once again and continued walking. The angel felt humiliated by the fact that a mere human was ignoring her; she flew in front of Kang Yoon-Soo and blocked his path before asking, \u201cBut what are you? How did you enter this place when you are not even an angel?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.\u201cWhat? How is that even possible? You insignificant lesser creatures are usually not allowed to enter this place. I thought you died and came to this place or something,\u201d the angel said.\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo asked.\u201cCreatures who have done something amazing in life are usually summoned to this place,\u201d the angel said as she stared at Kang Yoon-Soo with her beautiful eyes. The angel wanted to speak more with the interesting human and said, \u201cI am Yuriel. What is your name, you indifferent creature?\u201d\u201cNone of your business,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied curtly.It was actually Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s first time meeting with an angel, and that made him raise his guard toward her. The way she looked on the outside did not matter to him; he had no idea whether she was an ally or an enemy.\u201cWhat\u2019s your level?\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo asked.\u201cLevel? You must be talking about the power measurement set by you insignificant creatures. It is a little bit over 600,\u201d Yuriel replied.\u201cYou\u2019re at the same level as the intermediate demons,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.\u201cWhat? What do you mean?\u201d Yuriel asked curiously. She had never heard anything about demons from the other angels.However, Kang Yoon-Soo ignored her once again and asked, \u201cWhen will the feast start?\u201d\u201cNot telling,\u201d Yuriel said, and Kang Yoon-Soo frowned. Yuriel giggled as if she found his reaction to be fun before adding, \u201cI will tell you if you tell me more about the demons.\u201dKang Yoon-Soo stared at the angel before slowly starting to talk, telling the angel everything he knew about the demons in an emotionless and rude tone. However, Yuriel exclaimed in surprise as soon as Kang Yoon-Soo finished talking, \u201cWow! I have never seen a creature as boring as you!\u201d\u201cWhen\u2019s the feast going to start?\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo asked.\u201cHmm\u2026 You keep getting straight to the point\u2026 You really are no fun. Still, I will keep my promise. The feast will be starting soon,\u201d Yuriel said.Just then, a bright ray of light shone from heaven, and numerous angels with white wings started to descend from heaven one by one. Kang Yoon-Soo counted the angels descending; there were exactly forty-eight.\u201cOmo! Yuriel! Who is that creature beside you?\u201d an angel asked.\u201cHow did he enter the Angelic Temple?\u201d another angel asked.Kang Yoon-Soo slowly moved his hand to the hilt of his sword, but the angels only seemed to find him interesting, and did not seem to harbor any hostility toward him. It could also be because they knew Kang Yoon-Soo would not stand a chance if a battle broke out between them.\u201cI am not sure how he got in as well, but the way he is looking at us is very interesting,\u201d an angel said as the entire group surrounded Kang Yoon-Soo.\u201cI do not think he has been officially invited here.\u201d\u201cInteresting. His expressionless face makes him look like a doll.\u201d\u201cI want to touch him!\u201dYuriel blocked the angels when they tried to get closer to Kang Yoon-Soo, shouting, \u201cDo not come near! The creature might die if we touch him carelessly, since his kind is very insignificant and weak!\u201dThe angels agreed with Yuriel and took a step back, away from Kang Yoon-Soo. Yuriel snickered and whispered to Kang Yoon-Soo, \u201cActually, I lied. I hate it when someone else tries to touch something I find interesting.\u201dKang Yoon-Soo did not seem to be listening, as he just stood there and touched Yuriel\u2019s hair.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Yuriel asked.\u201cDoes angel hair always shine like this?\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo asked.\u201cIs that something to be surprised about?\u201d Yuriel responded.\u201cIt seems like a good material to use to craft things,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.\u201cWow, you are bad. You are not an ordinary creature. You are more like a demon,\u201d Yuriel said.\u201cI was a demon a few days ago,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said with a shrug.\u201cLiar!\u201d Yuriel exclaimed.Then, the lake suddenly started to tremble lightly, and a white temple surfaced in its center. All of the angels flew toward the temple entrance.Yuriel extended her hand as if to show her benevolence to Kang Yoon-Soo, saying, \u201cHere, take my hand and come with me. I want to ask the goddess who you are. I will fly you over, since you are an insignificant creature without wings.\u201d\u201cIs the goddess in that place?\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo asked.\u201cWho else would be there? Here, hurry up,\u201d Yuriel said.The angel picked up Kang Yoon-Soo, who was taller than her, easily and spread her wings open. The air above the lake was clean and pristine, and the flight felt different from the time Kang Yoon-Soo had flown over the Desert of Death as a demon.[You have arrived at the Angelic Temple.][The blessing of light will be with you for four days.][This place has an abundance of holy energy and will not run out of it.][You have explored a place that a human would ordinarily never be able to set foot in.][You will greatly influence the religions of the continent if you tell the tale of what you have seen in this place.]Kang Yoon-Soo reached the temple. The temple floor was made out of a white material that was smooth and shone brightly, unlike the white marble that was used in most prestigious places back in the continent. The temple did not contain any sculptures or art, but it still gave off a sense of prestige and authority.\u201cIt\u2019s similar to the ancient temple of the dwarves,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.\u201cThose tiny creatures revered our architecture. Wait, have you been to that place as well?\u201d Yuriel asked.\u201cA long time ago,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.Kang Yoon-Soo entered the center of the temple with Yuriel guiding him. He saw several chalices atop a long table, and the water in them greatly resembled the pristine lake water he had seen previously.\u201cDon\u2019t you have any alcohol?\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo asked.\u201cAlcohol? This is holy water. It is the water you insignificant creatures cannot get enough of,\u201d Yuriel said.Kang Yoon-Soo ignored the angel and took out a bottle of alcohol from his backpack, then proceeded to pour the alcohol into his own chalice. Yuriel curiously watched what he was doing, then asked with eyes filled with curiosity and amazement, \u201cWhat is that?\u201d\u201cAlcohol,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.\u201cMay I try it?\u201d Yuriel asked with sparkling eyes. Kang Yoon-Soo stared at the angel for a while before he poured some more into her chalice for her to try.\u201cHmm\u2026 It has an interesting taste,\u201d Yuriel said after she drank it, licking her lips as her face slowly turned red.Kang Yoon-Soo drank his alcohol as he observed the angels, thinking, \u2018There seems to be nothing special about it.\u2019The so-called feast of the angels was quite simple, as all they did was drink holy water from their chalices as they gathered around to chat. There was no music or dancing at the feast, but the alcohol tasted sweeter as Kang Yoon-Soo drank it while looking at the clouds above the temple.\u201cGive. Me. Another!\u201d Yuriel exclaimed, extending her chalice with a bright red face.Kang Yoon-Soo poured her the strongest alcohol he had while thinking, \u2018So angels get drunk as well.\u2019 He then observed the angels and took mental notes about their weaknesses whenever he saw one. He had experienced fighting against demons, so there was no guarantee that he would not have to fight against angels as well.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThere is something else to drink aside from holy water?\u201d\u201cGive me some as well! I am sick and tired of drinking holy water again and again!\u201dThe angels gathered around Kang Yoon-Soo once again. However, Yuriel stood in front of Kang Yoon-Soo with her arms stretched out and her face bright red, shouting, \u201cNo! Only I can drink what this creature has brought!\u201d\u201cAnd who made that rule?!\u201d an angel retorted.\u201cHmph! I did! I found him first, and he belongs to me!\u201d Yuriel exclaimed.\u201cYuriel! We will smack you if you keep hogging him all to yourself!\u201d another angel protested threateningly.\u2018So the angels quarrel among themselves too,\u2019 Kang Yoon-Soo thought as he continued observing the angels, using the skills he had learned in one of his past lives, when he had lived as a scientist and biologist.It was at the moment that the angels were quarreling among themselves that a bright, intense light descended unto the temple.A voice filled with authority and grandeur called out, \u201cStop this quarreling.\u201dThe angels all jumped in surprise and broke away from each other. Yuriel slapped and rubbed her red cheeks as she tried to sober up. Kang Yoon-Soo, on the other hand, leisurely leaned against a wall as he continued drinking alcohol.\u201cYou stupid creature! Show some respect!\u201d Yuriel yelled.\u201cWhy should I?\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo asked nonchalantly.\u201cThe goddess is coming!\u201d Yuriel replied.Kang Yoon-Soo did not seem to be bothered at all, unlike the angel who was prostrating on the ground while fidgeting nervously. The light that was enveloping the temple turned even brighter, and Kang Yoon-Soo squinted as he said, \u201cIt\u2019s blinding.\u201d\u201cYou are in the presence of the goddess! Of course it is!\u201d Yuriel angrily snapped.However, there was nobody in front of Kang Yoon-Soo, and he was certain he could not sense anyone. Despite that, the angels had begun standing nervously in a line as if there were someone in front of them.Then, the same voice said, \u201cYuriel. Come forward.\u201d Yuriel stepped forward while trembling so nervously that even her white wings had begun shaking as well. The voice seemed upset, rising by a tone as it continued, \u201cYou are drunk.\u201d\u201cI am sorry! Hiccup!\u201d Yuriel replied, trying her best to act sober, but she could not stop the hiccup from escaping her mouth.\u201cAngels are weak against alcohol. Do not let alcohol even touch your lips from now on, do you understand?\u201d the voice rebuked her.\u201cY-Yes! I will be careful from now on!\u201d Yuriel replied, tears welling up in her eyes.Kang Yoon-Soo was confused for a moment, thinking, \u2018They call this a feast?\u2019\u201cI wish to see the creature,\u201d the voice said.All the angels turned their gazes toward Kang Yoon-Soo, seeming to signal with their eyes, \u2018What are you doing? Hurry up and go in front of the goddess!\u2019\u201cThere\u2019s nobody here,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.\u201cNo one can see the goddess!\u201d Yuriel snapped, pushing Kang Yoon-Soo to the front of the line.The voice from within the bright light said to Kang Yoon-Soo, \u201cYou have finally come to me.\u201dKang Yoon-Soo finally recognized the voice after hearing it up close and replied, \u201cYou were the one who kept whispering to me.\u201d\u201cCorrect, you who have lived for the 1,000th time,\u201d the voice said.Kang Yoon-Soo racked his memories as he tried to recall which of the countless religions that existed on the continent was the strongest one, then asked, \u201cWhich goddess are you?\u201d\u201cI am Sylphia, the goddess who protects the continent,\u201d the voice replied.The goddess Sylphia had the most followers among the Continentals, and that had allowed her religion to position itself as the strongest one on the continent. Then, her followers had used their strength to demote all the other religions and denounce them as cults.The angels could not hide their shock and anger as they shouted at Kang Yoon-Soo.\u201cHow dare an insignificant creature speak so rudely to the goddess!\u201d\u201cYou ignorant, unrefined fool!\u201dKang Yoon-Soo ignored the angels, and the voice spoke to him again. \u201cI have a lot of things to tell you.\u201d\u201cThe same goes for me,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied. He asked, \u201cWhy did you only show up on my 1,000th life?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 91": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Record of a Thousand Liveschapter 92Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThere had been a lot of opportunities for the goddess to approach Kang Yoon-Soo in his countless regressions, but why was it that she had just approached him now?\u201cYou, who have lived for the 1,000th time. The world\u2019s balance has started to tilt,\u201d the goddess said.\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo asked.\u201cMy strength is dwindling,\u201d the goddess replied. Kang Yoon-Soo frowned as the goddess continued in a clear voice, \u201cI am the continent and the continent is me. The continent\u2019s name is Sylphia, and my name is Sylphia as well.\u201d\u201cAre you trying to say the continent is in danger?\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo asked.\u201cOne of the laws of this world has been broken, and the world has started to crumble because of it,\u201d the goddess replied.\u201cThe world will crumble because one law has been broken? What kind of logic is that?\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo asked again.\u201cI do not know,\u201d the goddess replied.\u201cCan there be something even a god doesn\u2019t know?\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo remarked with a frown.The angels were flabbergasted, left at a loss for words by the insignificant creature\u2019s brazenness. Yuriel contemplated whether she should immediately drag Kang Yoon-Soo out of the temple or not.However, the goddess calmly replied, \u201cYou creatures have this fantasy about what you call \u2018god\u2019. A god is just a creator. The myth of \u2018omnipotence\u2019 you have about gods is nothing but a fantasy. A god is not all-powerful; the only one who is truly omnipotent in this world is a higher being who is shrouded in mystery even to the gods.\u201dKang Yoon-Soo inscribed the words spoken by the goddess in his mind; she had just indirectly implied that even a god could be killed.\u201cAre you trying to say that the laws of this world were broken because of me?\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo asked.\u201cOne who should not exist in this world has appeared, and that has caused the laws of this world to break. I am certain that it is somehow related to your regression,\u201d the goddess replied.Kang Yoon-Soo frowned once again and said, \u201cI didn\u2019t regress because I wanted to.\u201d\u201cI am aware that it is because of the Demon Lord,\u201d the goddess said.\u2018She\u2019s aware of the existence of the Demon Lord? It\u2019ll be easier to talk to her, then,\u2019 Kang Yoon-Soo thought.\u201cYou\u2019re aware of my regression? Are you also aware of the events that happened in my previous lives, then?\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo asked.\u201cNo, I do not know about those,\u201d the goddess replied.Kang Yoon-Soo bit his lip. He was slowly becoming even more disappointed by the goddess as their conversation continued. He asked, \u201cThen how did you find out that I regressed?\u201d\u201cIt was easy to find out by looking at the years you have lived for. It is uncommon to come across a human that has lived for more than twenty thousand years,\u201d the goddess replied.Kang Yoon-Soo started to be skeptical of the goddess as he said, \u201cYou just said that the continent was starting to crumble, but I don\u2019t recall anything like that happening. There\u2019s never been an instance where the continent was destroyed prior to the appearance of the Demon Lord.\u201d\u201cWhy do you think a change happened in your life?\u201d the goddess asked. Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s eyes started to tremble before the goddess finally told him the reason. \u201cThe reason why this will be your final life is exactly because the laws of this world have been broken.\u201d\u201c\u2026How were the laws broken?\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo asked.\u201cThat is related to what I plan to command you to do,\u201d the goddess said.Suddenly, a bright light enveloped Kang Yoon-Soo; it was so bright that he had to cover his eyes with his hand. He slowly lowered his hand as the light started to dissipate, and saw that a totally different scene was in front of him.\u201cIt\u2019s the continent,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo remarked. He was high up in the sky, looking down on the vast continent; the whole continent was right before his eyes.\u201cI have the ability to see anywhere in the continent, and I have been watching your journey since the beginning,\u201d the goddess said. She waved her hand, and the view moved to a specific place on the continent; there, Lady Hermia was drying her hair while wet and naked. The scene continued to shift, and many villages and large stretches of wilderness flashed past Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s eyes.Ramax, the leader of the Red Rock Excavators, was proudly announcing the missing portion of the continent\u2019s history. Jiang Ren-Wei, the leader of the Martial Blood Clan, was swinging weapons in both hands while fighting intensely in a raid. Han Se-Hyeon was swinging his hand toward Yu Si-Do, and Yu Si-Do was cackling like a madman as he bared his fangs. Yanak was arguing with the other Fire Trolls over camel meat. Katz was tending to several plant seedlings together with a young elf girl.Then, the scene passed from the desert to a lush overgrown forest.\u201cI never imagined Kang Yoon-Soo would steal the alcohol bag. I\u2019ll secretly throw away the alcohol next time!\u201d Shaneth exclaimed furiously.\u201cShhh! Lower your voice. Kang Yoon-Soo is a sharp one,\u201d Iris said.\u201cHey, you punk, do you think he can hear us or something?\u201d Henrick grumbled.The scene in front of Kang Yoon-Soo suddenly turned black before returning to the Angelic Temple.\u201cHowever, I have lost my power to descend down to the continent,\u201d the goddess said.In other words, she had the ability to see, but not to be present.\u201cIt feels as if the continent I created is nothing but a picture framed on a wall now. In fact, even watching over the continent has become difficult for me,\u201d the goddess said in her usual gentle voice that was filled with authority, but her voice shook for a moment as she continued, \u201cI was searching all over the continent to find the cause of the laws breaking, and that was how I found you. I also found out about the Demon Lord destroying the continent and forcing you to regress back in time as I watched over you. That was why I decided to speak to you and guide you to this place.\u201dKang Yoon-Soo went straight to the point and asked, \u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d\u201cFix the broken laws of this world and kill the Demon Lord,\u201d the goddess replied.Kang Yoon-Soo had already planned to do the latter and kill the Demon Lord, but to restore the laws of the world? He said, \u201cI don\u2019t understand. How do you expect me to restore the laws of the world?\u201d\u201cThere is someone who is trying to intentionally destroy this world,\u201d the goddess said.\u201cDo you mean the Demon Lord?\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo asked.\u201cNo, the Demon Lord is not your only opponent,\u201d the goddess replied. She then continued, \u201cI told you that the 1,000th life was your final one, right? Well, there is someone who is aware of your regression and is hoping that you will fail this time and die.\u201dKang Yoon-Soo\u2019s face turned cold. The only other person who knew about his regression was Sirian, but he had not met him yet in this life. He asked, \u201cThere\u2019s someone like that? I\u2019ve lived the same life hundreds of times, but I\u2019ve never met someone like that before.\u201d\u201cI am ashamed to admit that I am not certain of this. I lost too much power when the laws of this world broke. However, if there is one thing I am certain of\u2026\u201d The goddess\u2019 tone turned serious all of a sudden as she continued, \u201cThere is definitely a reason as to why so many changes have occurred in your 1,000th life.\u201dKang Yoon-Soo had actually been relieved by the fact that a change had occurred in this life. Who knew how many times more he would have needed to regress and live the same life over and over again if no changes had taken place?\u201cI am certain that someone intentionally broke the laws of this world. That person has called someone who should not exist in this world. However, I cannot seem to find the person that should not exist in this world,\u201d the goddess said. She continued, \u201cFind this person who should not exist in this world and kill them. Then, the world will be back to normal, and my strength will return.\u201dA light holier than any other light in the world descended upon Kang Yoon-Soo.[You have obtained the qualifications to change into the class \u201cKnight of the Goddess\u201d.][You have been blessed by the goddess.][All of your stats have increased.][All experience points obtained on the Sylphia Continent will increase by 40%.][The Sword of Revelation will transform into the Holy Sword of Sylphia once you complete your class change.][Your race will change from \u2018human\u2019 to \u2018angel\u2019.][You may directly request for the goddess\u2019 favor once every thousand years.][You will have to pledge unconditional loyalty to Sylphia if you change your class to the Knight of the Goddess.][The class\u2019 full powers are currently sealed as the goddess has been greatly weakened.]Kang Yoon-Soo carefully read the message that popped up on his wrist device. He had never seen nor heard of the class \u2018Knight of the Goddess\u2019 in the hundreds of times he had lived.The angels turned rowdy, murmuring noisily and exclaiming among themselves.\u201cHow could this be?!\u201d\u201cThe title of Knight of the Goddess is only given to heroes who appear once in a century!\u201d\u201cIs that creature really that amazing?\u201dIt was Kang Yoon-Soo who had received the class change opportunity, but Yuriel was more excited than he was. The angel shouted, \u201cWhat are you doing, you dense creature?! Hurry up and accept it!\u201dKang Yoon-Soo was currently classless, and the Knight of the Goddess was not a bad class. \u2018However, it has one crucial weakness,\u2019 he thought. It was a problem only he could see.Kang Yoon-Soo asked the goddess, \u201cSo I have to change into an angel if I change my class?\u201d\u201cThat is right,\u201d the goddess replied.\u201cBut I heard that angels have very low alcohol tolerance\u2026?\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo continued.\u201cAngels get drunk from even a single drop of alcohol, so they should definitely abstain from alcohol,\u201d the goddess said.\u201cThen I\u2019ll pass,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied. An eerie silence filled the temple.Eventually, Kang Yoon-Soo broke the silence by asking the goddess, \u201cIs that all you have to say?\u201d\u201cAre you refusing the offer to become my knight?\u201d the goddess asked as her voice turned cold.Kang Yoon-Soo nodded and replied, \u201cYes.\u201dSuddenly, Kang Yoon-Soo felt a sharp pain in his heart that forced him to go down on one knee, and he barely managed to stay up by supporting himself with his sword. He was struggling to breathe.\u201cBecoming the Knight of the Goddess is not an opportunity that is given to just anyone,\u201d the goddess said with a cold voice.\u201cI said, I don\u2019t want to,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.Abstinence from alcohol was not the only reason Kang Yoon-Soo had refused to become the Knight of the Goddess. The Knight of the Goddess class actually had a lot of advantages and strong points, but the knight also had to pledge unconditional loyalty to the goddess.\u2018I don\u2019t like it.\u2019Kang Yoon-Soo was actually on guard against the goddess. The goddess might appear to be a holy being, but who knew if her true self was actually rotten and corrupt? It would be stupid for him to pledge unconditional loyalty to someone he did not even know anything about.The goddess spoke once again, but this time with a voice filled with hostility. \u201cA god is not omnipotent, but it is also not so weak as to overlook the transgression of a mere creature like you.\u201dKang Yoon-Soo\u2019s breathing became labored, and the light that had felt holy and pristine moments before was now engulfing him with hostility.\u201cThere is a fragment of a demon embedded inside you,\u201d the goddess said.Kang Yoon-Soo suddenly felt the torturous pain he usually only experienced at night, and he vomited blood because of the pain. \u201cKuheok!\u201dKang Yoon-Soo had been forced onto his knees, covering his mouth. He kept vomiting blood as he felt his organs twisting inside, and his head started to turn hazy as he struggled to maintain consciousness from the immense pain he felt. However, he still managed to raise his sword despite all the pain he was going through.\u201cWhat in the world?!\u201d\u201cHow dare a mere creature attempt to stand up against the goddess?!\u201dThe angels were in an uproar, but Kang Yoon-Soo did not point his sword toward the light where the goddess was presumed to be. Instead, he placed his sword against his own neck.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d the goddess asked in a cold, hostile tone.\u201cYou\u2026 How come you\u2019ve never tried to kill the Demon Lord?\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo asked.The goddess remained silent, and Kang Yoon-Soo continued, \u201cThe world was destroyed at the hands of the Demon Lord in my past lives, but you did not do anything about it. The Demon Lord would have received your judgment long ago if you were stronger than him.\u201d He continued on, seemingly prepared to risk it all. \u201cYou aren\u2019t confident that you can win against the Demon Lord, and it\u2019s a fact that you can\u2019t win. That\u2019s why you\u2019re passing the responsibility to me, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cThat is a plausible assumption,\u201d the goddess replied.\u201cI refuse to become your knight, and I\u2019ll kill myself this instant if you try to force it on me,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.\u201cAre you saying that you will throw away the life you tried so hard to preserve over the hundreds of times you have regressed?\u201d the goddess asked.\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo responded, even as he continued to struggle to breathe. He collected his breath before he continued, \u201cThe continent will definitely be destroyed if I die, and you\u2019ll die along with the continent, Sylphia.\u201dThe sword had become tainted with Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s blood, but he continued speaking as if he could not feel any pain at all. \u201cRemember this. I\u2019m the only one that can kill the Demon Lord.\u201dThe goddess was silent for quite a while, and Kang Yoon-Soo stared at the light without even batting an eye. Eventually, the goddess spoke from within the light with a sigh. \u201cYou are the first creature to ever say my name to my face.\u201dKang Yoon-Soo felt the pain subside, and he lowered his sword and wiped away the blood on his lips. He touched his neck and found that the wound was deeper than he had thought it was.\u201cHow foolish and stupid of you,\u201d the goddess said, and light shone on Kang Yoon-Soo once again. Kang Yoon-Soo once again put up his guard, but the light instantly healed the wound on his neck this time around.\u201cI have realized one thing. The reason why the Demon Lord has chosen you,\u201d the goddess said with a sigh. She continued, \u201cI suppose it is not that easy to put someone who has lived a thousand times under my thumb.\u201dThe light enveloped Kang Yoon-Soo once again, but this time, it felt warm and gentle, and he felt the heavy burden in his chest suddenly disappear.\u201cI have removed the demonic fragment lodged in your body. I cannot stand the sight of someone carrying out my will having something so evil in his body. Never try to borrow demonic powers ever again,\u201d the goddess said.\u201cThank you,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said as he stretched his tired body. He had not managed to get any rest because of the curse inflicted upon him by the Frost Demon\u2019s fragment.\u201cYou have told me to kill the person who should not exist in this world, but what will you give me in return?\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo asked.Kang Yoon-Soo was not someone to take a loss just because the other party was the goddess herself, but the angels around him did not seem to appreciate his brazenness as they gritted their teeth in anger.\u201cI do not plan to order you around for free,\u201d the goddess replied. She offered a proposal to Kang Yoon-Soo. \u201cI will lend you one of my angels.\u201dKang Yoon-Soo was surprised and asked, \u201cAn angel?\u201d\u201cThat is right,\u201d the goddess responded. The light illuminated the angels in the temple before the goddess continued, \u201cPick one from these children to become your guardian angel.\u201dYuriel took a step forward when she heard the goddess\u2019 words.However, Kang Yoon-Soo shook his head and said, \u201cI don\u2019t need them.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It would be better for him to receive a weapon than to borrow a guardian angel from the goddess.\u201cI\u2019d prefer to receive a weapon with your power in it instead,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said, preparing for the goddess to inflict pain upon him again.However, the goddess instead replied with a sigh, \u201cI suppose you do have the right to choose since you will be carrying out my request.\u201dThe goddess already knew how stubborn Kang Yoon-Soo was after he had refused her offer to take him in as her knight. As such, she easily gave up on trying to tame him. She instead said in a calm, gentle voice, \u201cThe holy weapons have lost their powers because I have lost mine. So it is unfortunate, but I do not have a useful weapon to give you.\u201d\u201cThen bless me instead,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.A blessing could be very useful in many ways. It could either increase experience points gained or protect the blessed individual with holy power. There would be no need to debate whether the blessing was a better reward or not if it came directly from the goddess herself.\u201cI can bless you, but the duration of the blessing will only be for three or four days,\u201d the goddess said.\u2018How useless can you be?\u2019 Kang Yoon-Soo thought to himself. However, he asked just to confirm once again, \u201cCan\u2019t you give me something else aside from the angel?\u201d\u201cThe most useful reward you can receive is the guardian angel, and she will prove to be useful in many ways,\u201d the goddess said.The goddess did not budge an inch on the issue, and Kang Yoon-Soo had no choice but to accept the reward. He said rudely, \u201cFine, I\u2019ll take the angel.The angels loudly began protesting Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s rude behavior.\u201cI don\u2019t like that guy!\u201d\u201cHow can I be the guardian of such a rude creature?!\u201d\u201cHow dare an insignificant creature act as if he had no choice but to take us?!\u201dThe temple became noisy due to the protests. Suddenly, the light that embodied the goddess glowed brightly and aggressively, and she roared, \u201cSilence!\u201dThe angels immediately fell silent, and Kang Yoon-Soo leisurely took this time to take a look at them one by one. Perhaps it was because they were serving a goddess, but all of the angels were females. They were all completely naked without any protective clothing or equipment, but that did not mean they seemed vulnerable or weak.\u201cEhem\u2026 Ehem\u2026\u201d Yuriel coughed a few times as Kang Yoon-Soo passed by her while meticulously inspecting the angels one by one.\u2018It\u2019ll be beneficial for me to choose the strongest one among them,\u2019 Kang Yoon-Soo thought, even as the angel kept coughing to get his attention.\u201cEhem! Ehem!\u201d Yuriel continued.Kang Yoon-Soo continued ignoring her, turning to the goddess and asking, \u201cCan\u2019t you give me all forty-eight angels?\u201dIt would be beneficial for the goddess if he managed to successfully complete the task he was given, which was why Kang Yoon-Soo decided to ask if he could receive her full support on the matter.\u201cThe angels are no different from my flesh and blood. My godly powers will be exhausted if even one angel descends to the continent. Sending even one angel in my current state is already a huge burden for me,\u201d the goddess said.\u2018I guess there\u2019s no helping it,\u2019 Kang Yoon-Soo thought, deciding instead to focus on the angels\u2019 personalities instead of how powerful they were individually. He thought it would be a serious problem if the strongest angel he chose somehow suddenly decided to be hostile toward him.Kang Yoon-Soo made his choice and walked in front of an angel. Yuriel, whom he was standing in front of, looked at him cheekily and remarked, \u201cYou said you did not need me?\u201d\u201cI changed my mind,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.\u201cHmph! What makes you think I\u2019ll follow you?\u201d Yuriel said.Kang Yoon-Soo took out a bottle of alcohol that looked quite luxurious and said, \u201cHave a drink later.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026 I am curious how that one will taste\u2026 but I decided to abstain from alcohol, so\u2026\u201d Yuriel trailed off.It was right when Kang Yoon-Soo was about to put the bottle of alcohol back in his bag that Yuriel suddenly grabbed his arm and shouted, \u201cAlright! Alright! I will be your guardian angel!\u201dKang Yoon-Soo easily managed to convince the angel. The light that embodied the goddess glowed brighter as she said, \u201cThe request I am making to you is not just for me, but for the entire continent. The calamity will surely befall the entire continent if you fail to find and kill the one who should not exist in this world.\u201d[Goddess\u2019 Request\u2014The One Who Should Not Exist In This World]The goddess Sylphia is slowly losing her strength, and the continent is slowly crumbling because of the one who should not exist in this world. Find and kill the one who should not exist in this world and restore the powers of the goddess.*This is the first quest given by the goddess on the continent.*The fate of the continent lies in the success of this quest.*There are no clues regarding the one who should not exist in this world.Rewards: ???It was the first time in Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s many lives that he had received a quest from the goddess. He thought, \u2018Another difficult trial has appeared.\u2019The quest details did not mention what the rewards would be, but he had no choice but to carry out the goddess\u2019 task if there was someone somewhere on the continent who was trying to stop his regression and was trying to kill him as well.\u2018To find the one who shouldn\u2019t exist in this world, and to kill that person\u2026\u2019It was definitely not an easy task, but Kang Yoon-Soo had an ominous feeling that he would be meeting the one who should not exist in this world sometime in the future.\u2018It\u2019s strange\u2026\u2019Kang Yoon-Soo felt a strong sense of certainty that he would meet that person. It was the first time in his thousand lives that he had felt that way.\u2018There are no clues at all as of now. I guess something will come up as long as I keep moving.\u2019\u201cIt is time for me to send you back. I hope that you will definitely protect me and the continent from the calamity,\u201d the goddess said. Her light enveloped Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s body.As Kang Yoon-Soo started to turn transparent, his figure dissipating, he suddenly said, \u201cI have something to tell you.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d the goddess asked.\u201cThis isn\u2019t the only continent in this world,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said. The goddess remained silent, but she did not seem to be surprised at all.Kang Yoon-Soo continued just before he disappeared, \u201cI\u2019ve been to a continent far away from here in a previous life. This world is quite vast. Who knows? Maybe there\u2019s another god like you on the other continent.\u201dKang Yoon-Soo completely disappeared, leaving the goddess muttering to herself, \u201cThis is not the only continent, you say\u2026\u201dSylphia looked at the spot Kang Yoon-Soo had been in moments before, and said, \u201cThose words will come back to you very soon, you who have lived a thousand times.\u201dThe light that embodied the goddess disappeared.***The dark forest was filled with insects and beasts, prowling for something to feed on.Henrick fed a branch into the campfire and said, \u201cShall we tell some horror stories, since it\u2019s gotten dark?\u201d\u201cDo you know any good ones?\u201d Shaneth asked as she stirred the soup that would serve as their midnight snack. Iris just stared silently at the pot of soup.\u201cI know a few stories\u2026 I think that story will be perfect for a day like this,\u201d Henrick said.\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Iris asked curiously as her attention was drawn away from the soup.Henrick lowered his voice to set the mood for the story, saying, \u201cThis is the story of a ghost in a dark forest that kidnaps and eats women.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s lame. I think I\u2019ve heard this one before,\u201d Shaneth said, snickering.However, Iris was already immersed in the story and asked, \u201cA ghost? Are you talking about those who have already died?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, I\u2019m talking about \u2018that\u2019 kind of ghost, but this one is different from the other ghosts. It has a sick and twisted way of eating people,\u201d Henrick said eerily.\u201cSick and twisted\u2026?\u201d Iris asked.\u201cAnything that preyed on humans would usually go for the meaty parts like the thighs or the stomach, right? But strangely, this ghost only eats women\u2019s heads,\u201d Henrick explained.\u201cThe head? Is the head delicious?\u201d Iris asked.\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know if the ghost is a gourmet or an omnivore, but this one has an excellent sense of smell, and it can smell the scent of food miles away, just like a monster\u2014well, it is a monster, anyway\u2026\u201d Henrick said.Iris stared nervously at the pot of soup, while Henrick poked the coals of the campfire around to make space for new firewood to be put in. Henrick continued, \u201cBut this ghost knows what\u2019s delicious and what isn\u2019t. It doesn\u2019t like to eat weak women, and it prefers to eat strong women. It especially enjoys eating the heads of women who have monstrous strength.\u201dIris gulped nervously and asked, \u201cD-does this ghost eat doppelgangers as well\u2026?\u201d\u201cOf course! It can\u2019t get enough of doppelgangers, so much so that it would get on all fours just to eat one, since doppelgangers tend to always shift into the females of numerous races. The ghost especially loves to eat doppelgangers who have shifted into human females, since their heads are quite fragrant and tender,\u201d Henrick continued..Iris trembled slightly, looking around nervously. Meanwhile, Henrick continued his story. \u201cThe ghost looks like a human male, and it usually lurks in the darkness before suddenly showing up. It\u2019s usually quite handsome, since it has to entice women to come to it. Anyway, the ghost would suddenly show up and grab the woman\u2019s head without a hint of expression on its face.\u201dIris\u2019 shoulders started to tremble, and she asked in a shaky voice that was on the verge of tears, \u201cDoes that ghost live in this forest too\u2026?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no telling where it is. It could be anywhere for all we know,\u201d Henrick said in the same eerie voice.\u201cStop it. Can\u2019t you see that Iris unni is starting to get scared?\u201d Shaneth rebuked him as she scooped soup into a bowl.\u201cIsn\u2019t that the purpose of horror stories in the first place?\u201d Henrick grumbled.\u201cI\u2019m tired,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said as he suddenly popped up out of nowhere and sat beside Iris.\u201cKyaaaah!\u201dPukeok!Kang Yoon-Soo immediately ducked, and the tree behind him was split in half as it was struck by Iris\u2019 fist.\u201cWhen did you arrive?\u201d Henrick asked with a look of surprise.\u201cJust now,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied as he tied the horse to a tree and let out a yawn.The goddess had sent Kang Yoon-Soo and his horse to where his party members were to make it easier for him.Iris immediately ran toward Shaneth and clung to her after Kang Yoon-Soo sat beside her, crying out, \u201cMy head does not taste good!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with her?\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo asked.\u201cIt\u2019s alright, unni. Kang Yoon-Soo doesn\u2019t eat people\u2026 I think\u2026?\u201d Shaneth said, trying to console Iris.\u201cHave you met the person you were supposed to meet?\u201d Henrick asked.\u201cYeah,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.Kang Yoon-Soo looked quite haggard and exhausted. The fatigue that had accumulated due to his lack of sleep had hit him all at once when the Frost Demon\u2019s Winter Fragment was removed from him.\u201cHave some soup. You look really tired,\u201d Shaneth said as she passed a bowl of soup to Kang Yoon-Soo.\u201cThanks,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.Shaneth looked at him worriedly and asked, \u201cShall I give you a shoulder massage later?\u201d\u201cYeah,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.\u201cThat lucky bastard. He has a beauty who will give him massages whenever he\u2019s tired,\u201d Henrick grumbled.Iris, having finally managed to calm down, looked at Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s lower body and asked in surprise, \u201cEh? What are those strands of hair?\u201dThere were strands of bright-colored hair hanging out of Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s pocket, glowing like a halogen light.Iris lifted the strands of hair up to her nose and sniffed them before saying, \u201cThey smell really good.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re quite long. Is that a woman\u2019s hair?\u201d Shaneth sharply asked.Kang Yoon-Soo tried to remember where the strands of hair came from, and the only culprit he could think of was Yuriel. He muttered, \u201cI guess she gave me these as a parting gift.\u201dShaneth suddenly froze and dropped the bowl of soup in shock before exclaiming, \u201cA woman gave you her hair as a parting gift\u2026?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo corrected her and continued, \u201cShe was an angel.\u201d\u201cYou cheeky bastard! You could have at least told me you were going to a meeting like that,\u201d Henrick said mockingly while clicking his tongue.Shaneth bit her lips and trembled before saying, \u201cI never imagined you would be someone like this! I thought you were loyal and would only like one person! Were you hiding a lover in this place?!\u201d She seemed visibly upset, with betrayal and shame written on her face. It was as if she were trying to say \u2018How could you do this to me after you kissed me?!\u2019.\u201cThat\u2019s not it,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.It took quite a while for Kang Yoon-Soo to clear up the misunderstanding, but Shaneth still did not seem to be convinced. She looked at him skeptically and asked, \u201cYou\u2019re telling us you went to the Angelic Temple?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied with a nod. Then, he realized it would be fine to ask their opinion. It was his first time seeing a request from the goddess herself, and there were no clues at all as well. As such, he figured it would be better to have other people\u2019s opinions on the matter. He told them everything he had talked about with the goddess, except the parts about his regressions and the Demon Lord.\u201cThe one who shouldn\u2019t exist in this world\u2026\u201d Henrick muttered, rubbing his chin before continuing, \u201cIt\u2019s definitely going to be difficult to find that person. There are tons of people that the world would be better off without, even looking in one city alone.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s something as simple as that. If this person is related to something that can even reduce the goddess\u2019 powers, don\u2019t you think this is a part of something much larger?\u201d Shaneth replied.\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Henrick asked, his brow rising.\u201cHmm\u2026 Maybe an intruder from another world, for example?\u201d Shaneth mused.\u201cHey, you punk. That guy\u2019s an intruder from another world as well if you put it like that,\u201d Henrick shot back, pointing at Kang Yoon-Soo with his chin.\u201cOh? You\u2019re right, now that I think about it,\u201d Shaneth replied.Henrick suddenly snapped his finger and exclaimed, \u201cCouldn\u2019t it be something like this? The goddess\u2019 powers diminished because the Travelers kept crossing over to the continent?\u201d\u201cThat sounds like a plausible theory as well, but it should be a single person, since the quest called them \u2018the one who should not exist in this world\u2019,\u201d Shaneth said.The conversation carried on with numerous theories and ideas, proving to be much better than Kang Yoon-Soo racking his own brains trying to come up with ideas. He was swept up in a feeling of nostalgia, thinking, \u2018Thinking together, worrying together, and discussing things together\u2026\u2019 It was nothing special, but the sensation felt new to him.He had always felt alone, and he had always been alone. The memories he had of his prior regressions were only known to him, and that had made him feel as if it were just natural for him to tackle everything by himself\u2014since he already knew what was going to happen.\u2018I guess I have to tell them everything if the right time comes\u2026\u2019 Kang Yoon-Soo thought. That meant everything about his regressions, the Demon Lord, and his relationships with them in his previous life.He wanted to enjoy the melancholy a little bit more, but his body was just too tired to stay up.\u201cOh right,\u201d he added, looking at Shaneth as he continued, \u201cDon\u2019t secretly throw away the booze when I go to sleep.\u201d\u201cH-how did you know\u2026?\u201d Shaneth asked, her eyes wide open in shock.Kang Yoon-Soo could no longer be bothered to respond. Instead, he finally said what he had wanted to say for some time.\u201cMassage my shoulders.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I\u2019m from Singapore, Singapore.\u201dIt was the man\u2019s habit.\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cThe capital of Singapore is Singapore. My name is David,\u201d David introduced himself as he sharpened his knife.The Mongolian woman said, \u201cMy name is Xayah. Can I ask you something?\u201d\u201cGo ahead,\u201d David said.\u201cWhat will you do with me?\u201d Xayah asked.\u201cI\u2019ll kill you,\u201d David replied.Xayah bit her lips, and the sound of the blade being sharpened filled her ears, but she could not move at all as her body did not listen to her. She asked, \u201cHow can I cut these threads?\u201d\u201cThose are mana threads used to control dolls. You can\u2019t cut them with brute force,\u201d David replied.\u201cP-please, spare me,\u201d Xayah pleaded.\u201cI don\u2019t want to,\u201d David said mockingly.Xayah looked at David with pleading eyes and asked, \u201cWhy did you abduct me?\u201dXayah was an Archer, and archery was something she had been confident in even back in the real world. In fact, she was a very skilled archer who could deliver numerous headshots to boss monsters during numerous raids.\u2018If only I hadn\u2019t been swayed by my conscience and had shot that bastard\u2026\u2019 Xayah thought, cursing inwardly at herself.She had been overconfident in her own abilities and gone out hunting, only to find herself being abducted by David. She had heard numerous rumors of adventurers being abducted, but never had she imagined that she would be the victim of those rumors.She had already been in this place by the time she regained her consciousness, but she had no clue where it was.\u2018Where the hell is this place\u2026?\u2019 Xayah thought. She looked around and saw numerous other people who were bound by mana threads. She could deduce that all of them were Travelers, judging from the devices on their wrists.\u201cAren\u2019t you a Traveler too? Why are you trying to kill me? Are you trying to increase your level by committing murder?\u201d Xayah asked desperately.\u201cIt\u2019s something like that,\u201d David leisurely replied as he checked the sharpness of the blade he had been sharpening on the whetstone just a moment before. He continued, \u201cYou\u2019ll die, but you\u2019ll also stay alive.\u201d\u201cW-what are you talking about\u2026?\u201d Xayah asked nervously.\u201cYou\u2019ll become a monster in this ruin!\u201d David proudly replied.Xayah\u2019s eyes trembled in horror, and her body soon followed suit and trembled uncontrollably as she looked around. What she saw was a dusty stone wall, with various tools she had never seen in her life hanging from it.\u201cA-are you telling me that this is a ruin? The kind of ruin where hundreds or even thousands of monsters reside?\u201d Xayah asked, panicking.\u201cCorrect,\u201d David replied leisurely.\u201cBut why will I become a monster?!\u201d Xayah exclaimed as she struggled to break free from the mana threads binding her. However, the threads did not budge an inch and showed no signs of breaking at all.David pointed his blade at Xayah\u2019s neck and said, \u201cIt\u2019ll be very painful at the start, but you\u2019ll get used to it in the end\u2026 because you\u2019ll lose your mind by then.\u201d\u201cNo! Don\u2019t! Don\u2019t touch me!\u201d Xayah screamed tearfully in despair.However, that did not seem to bother David at all as he swung his blade down.Sukeok!A pool of blood formed on the floor, and an arm with a wrist device attached to it fell to the floor.Thud!***\u201cHenrick,\u201d Iris said.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Henrick asked.\u201cWhitey has died,\u201d Iris said.Henrick, who had been fiddling with his sculpting knife, suddenly stopped fidgeting and asked, \u201cWho\u2019s Whitey?\u201d\u201cThe white horse I was riding!\u201d Iris shouted, tears welling up in her eyes.Henrick awkwardly scratched the back of his head and asked, \u201cThen\u2026 Are we having horse meat for lunch?\u201dWhoosh!\u201cHap!\u201d Henrick exclaimed as he ducked hurriedly and avoided Iris\u2019 fist aimed at his midsection.\u201cHenrick is bad!\u201d Iris screamed, before running away in tears.Henrick was dumbfounded by the turn of events, and he put away the sculpting knife and the piece of wood he was sculpting.Shaneth let out a sigh, approaching Henrick and saying, \u201cHave some sympathy at least, ahjussi.\u201d\u201cYeah, I think the horse meat comment was too mean, now that I think about it. I guess I should\u2019ve told her that we would hold a funeral ceremony for the horse for four days and nights,\u201d Henrick grumbled.\u201cYou\u2019re pretty quick-witted at times, but you don\u2019t seem to understand women at all,\u201d Shaneth said.\u201cShe\u2019s not even going to be my woman, so why should I care to understand her?\u201d Henrick said, sounding annoyed.\u201cYou might end up regretting not understanding women earlier if you end up with a woman later,\u201d Shaneth said.\u201cHey, you punk. Which woman do you think would even want to be with a man like me?\u201d Henrick shot back as he dusted his pants and got up from the ground. He wondered, \u201cBut why did the horse die all of a sudden?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not only Iris unni\u2019s white horse. All of our horses were also dead all of a sudden when we woke up this morning,\u201d Shaneth said as they both walked to where the horses had been tied up.There were four horses lying on the ground underneath a large tree. They were not breathing at all and their eyes were out of focus.\u201cWhy the hell did these fellas die all of a sudden?\u201d Henrick exclaimed.\u201cSudden Death Syndrome.\u201d\u201cAh! Are you a ghost or something? Can\u2019t you make a sound or something before you show up?\u201d Henrick exclaimed, jumping in fright.\u201cWhere did you go so early in the morning?\u201d Shaneth asked.\u201cTo collect some medicinal herbs in the forest,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied as he observed the dead horses. He noticed that all of the horses had purple spots of some sort on their bodies.\u2018Sudden Death Syndrome spreads quickly to anything that comes in contact with the corpses, and the bacteria won\u2019t die from normal antiseptics,\u2019 Kang Yoon-Soo thought.A black magician who spread that disease lived at the edge of the forest. He not only spread various kinds of disease and pestilence, but also made corpses rot, making it difficult for them to be resurrected and used as undead.\u2018But the investigators will take care of that guy,\u2019 Kang Yoon-Soo thought.That was the reason why Kang Yoon-Soo had asked Halven to request for 1st Grade investigators to be dispatched to the forest.\u2018The black magician who\u2019s spreading the disease is a nuisance to kill. It\u2019ll be better to not waste any time with the nuisance and let the investigators take care of him instead,\u2019 Kang Yoon-Soo thought. He had decided to let others take care of difficult and unrewarding tasks, since he now had a mountain of tasks to finish as soon as possible before the Demon Lord appeared.\u201cLet\u2019s walk the rest of the way,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.\u201cCan\u2019t you just raise the horses as undead?\u201d Henrick grumbled.\u201cThey\u2019ve rotted, and it\u2019s dangerous to ride them,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo explained. He took out a large flat dish and started to crush the medicinal herbs he had foraged from the forest; he then mixed the thick paste he had made with the strongest alcohol he had.\u201cDrink it,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.\u201cW-what is this\u2026?\u201d Shaneth asked nervously.\u201cYou won\u2019t get the disease that causes Sudden Death Syndrome if you drink this,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo explained.Shaneth scrunched her face up as she drank the medicinal concoction, which tasted extremely bitter. Kang Yoon-Soo and Henrick gulped it down as well.\u201cWhere is Iris unni?\u201d Shaneth asked. She looked around all over the place, but could not find Iris.Henrick raised an eyebrow and said, \u201cDid she get lost in the forest or something?\u201dThen, Kang Yoon-Soo went into the forest. He came back out in less than thirty minutes, dragging Iris by the wrist.\u201cI want to see Whitey alive again,\u201d Iris said, her eyes red from crying.Kang Yoon-Soo extended the medicinal concoction toward her and said, \u201cDrink it.\u201dIris gulped it down without even leaving a drop behind before sighing and saying, \u201cI have no appetite\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t people usually say that before they eat\u2026?\u201d Henrick grumbled. Then, he looked at the horses\u2019 corpses and saw that an army of flies had already made their way over, buzzing fiercely.\u201cI have a bad feeling these guys will cause an outbreak if we just leave them be\u2026\u201d Henrick said.\u201cThen what should we do?\u201d Shaneth asked.\u201cWhat else? Let\u2019s burn them,\u201d Henrick replied.Iris glared at Henrick and said tearfully, \u201cHenrick is ruthless, emotionless, and stupid.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s called being realistic,\u201d Henrick said with a shrug.Shaneth looked at Iris for a moment before approaching her and asking, \u201cCan we burn them now, unni?\u201d\u201cGive me a moment,\u201d Iris said. She walked toward the white horse\u2019s corpse and whispered something into its ears, then got up and said, \u201cYou can burn them now.\u201d\u201cPyrokinesis,\u201d Shaneth muttered.Fwaaaah!A stream of flame shot out from Shaneth\u2019s hand, engulfing the horses and burning them. Shaneth\u2019s control over her flame had significantly risen across their travels, and she carefully controlled it so as not to burn the entire forest down.Iris leaned on Shaneth as she sniffled at the sight of the horses burning. Shaneth asked Iris out of curiosity, \u201cWhat did you whisper, unni?\u201d\u201cI told Whitey to be reborn as my child in the future,\u201d Iris replied.\u201cIt\u2019ll happen if you wish for it,\u201d Shaneth said in consolation. Henrick could not say anything and just clicked his tongue.\u201cLet us go. I do not wish to see Whitey burn any longer,\u201d Iris said. The trio packed up their belongings and walked up the road.Meanwhile, Kang Yoon-Soo stayed behind and watched the horses burn, then collected a horse bone that was covered with purple spots. Then, he carefully wrapped it in a handkerchief and placed it in one corner of his backpack.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Henrick called out.\u201cI\u2019m coming,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.***David wiped his blood-drenched hands in front of twenty-nine Travelers lined up before him. The Travelers were from diverse backgrounds\u2014Mongolian, Lebanese, East Timorese, and the like.\u2018I\u2019ve got quite the variety,\u2019 he thought. Checking the nationality of his victims was a habit he had had for a long time. However, that habit of his was what had led to his capture back in the real world.\u2018There was that woman who managed to escape before I got to kill her,\u2019 David reminisced.David had been a convict on death row, and his crimes as a serial killer were so heavy that the chance of him getting out on parole had immediately been denied by the courts. Additionally, he had the hobby of stitching together his victims\u2019 body parts.\u2018I never knew my hobby back in the real world would be helpful over here.\u2019He had been transported to this world, which had made him extremely happy. The prison that had held him was no longer there, and he could have a fresh start\u2014which was why he let his instincts go wild.\u2018How many have I killed so far?\u2019 he thought.He had never cared what his level was, or what remained back in the real world.\u2018I\u2019ll kill until I die.\u2019 That was his natural instinct.This ruin was where David was transferred to when he was summoned from the real world to this world, but it did not have any monsters inhabiting it, and at first was only littered with various kinds of crafting tools.He immediately knew as soon as he was summoned to this world that it was a dog-eat-dog world. He thought to himself, \u2018I have to kill to survive in this place.\u2019He mercilessly killed all of the other people he had been summoned with, and did not leave a single one alive. Then, a message popped up from his wrist device when he killed the final one.[You have become the new owner of the Shy Doll Ruin.][This is a desolate ruin with no monsters inhabiting it.][You will obtain additional experience points if you kill intruders entering the ruin.][You will unlock additional abilities when you upgrade the ruin.][Will you become the successor of Madman Rick?]\u2018It\u2019s like a defense game.\u2019He had played a few games that were similar back in the real world; they were about becoming the dungeon boss and killing all of the intruders to defend the dungeon. However, David could not understand the final phrase.\u2018Madman Rick?\u2019 He had no idea what that meant and who Rick was, but he liked the word \u2018madman\u2019 used to describe Rick.\u201cI\u2019ll accept and become his successor,\u201d David said. A wave of new knowledge flooded his mind, and he instantly learned how to use the Body Crafting Kit, which he had never seen before in his life.He started to stitch the corpses of the Travelers who had arrived with him into dolls. He also killed any intruders who entered the ruin and turned them into dolls.[You have obtained the final masterpiece as the successor of Madman Rick.][Only a person who has reached the peak of crafting and puppeteering can use this.][The number of combat dolls stationed in the ruin has exceeded 500.][You are now able to install arrow traps and poison puddles in the ruin.][You have installed the traps in the ruin very well.][You have obtained the knowledge to craft a new and more powerful combat doll.][You have killed more than 200 intruders in a month.][The ruin has reached Level 5!][You are now eligible for class advancement.]David advanced into the class of \u2018Ruin Master\u2019. It was a unique class that allowed the holder to become the boss of the ruin they owned. With that, he thought, \u2018I can freely kill more people in this world.\u2019He immediately started going to work turning twenty-nine corpses into dolls, and stationed them in various places to guard the ruin. After a while, the ruin had grown to house more than 1,500 combat dolls and there were just as many traps installed in it.\u201cIt\u2019s getting boring\u2026\u201d David said with a sigh.The ruin had grown exponentially, but any intruders were very easily taken care of and did not even manage to properly enter the ruin. David no longer felt the thrill of killing his prey, and he had too much time on his hands these days.Right when he was severely bored and unmotivated, however, his wrist device suddenly vibrated.Brrrr![A group of travelers has been spotted near the ruin.][It consists of a single Traveler, two Continentals, and one monster.]David had developed a hobby of abducting Travelers and turning them into dolls due to his boredom. He noted the location displayed on his wrist device. It was an ability granted to the Ruin Master class.\u2018I hope it\u2019s someone who can entertain me this time\u2026\u2019 David thought as he left his ruin.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 94": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Record of a Thousand Liveschapter 95Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe dark forest terrain was very rough and rugged, and it was covered in numerous large tree roots and sharp jagged rocks that made it even more difficult to traverse.\u201cI cannot see anything ahead,\u201d Iris said, still feeling depressed over the death of her white horse.Shaneth lifted her finger and said, \u201cPyrokinesis.\u201d An orange flame burned brightly at her fingertip and illuminated the area like a lamp.When the surroundings lit up, Henrick praised Shaneth sarcastically, \u201cYou\u2019ve become quite useful!\u201d\u201cAm I an object?\u201d Shaneth shot back sharply.Kang Yoon-Soo found that his backpack had started shining suddenly. He opened it to find that Yuriel\u2019s hair was what was emanating that brilliance.[Yuriel\u2019s Hair]Hair belonging to the angel Yuriel. You may summon the angel if you burn this hair. However, you may not summon the angel at night or in corrupted places.+The duration that the angel may stay on the earth will shorten the more often you summon her.\u2018I guess I have to hold back on summoning the angel unless it is an absolutely dire situation.\u2019Yuriel was an angel who was over Level 600; an angel would be a guaranteed boost to their combat powers if she were deployed on a battlefield. However, Kang Yoon-Soo would lose a proportionate amount of potential experience points, since the angel would surely eliminate all the enemies.\u2018The duration she can stay will also be reduced the more often I summon her.\u2019He had explored plenty of ruins and places that held numerous secrets of the continent in the past life he had lived as the Explorer of the Unknown, and he had come across an assortment of information regarding angels. The angels were beings who had a near-endless supply of holy power, but almost all of them lived in the heavenly realms and rarely came down to earth. They were different from the demons, who could live on the earth for an extended period of time, and they had limits on the time they could spend on the earth once they came down.\u2018I have to find out more about angels descending to the earth later on.\u2019The sun had fully set, and the moon had risen to its highest point in the night sky.It was at the moment that they were about to decide where to camp for the night that someone suddenly asked the party a question.\u201cWhere are you from?\u201d a man asked, emerging from the darkness.***David only abducted Travelers; the Continentals were from a different world, and so he did not get the same thrill from killing them. Besides, he had another personal reason to be obsessed with only killing Travelers.\u2018The feeling I get when I cut off the arm with the wrist device is just ecstasy in itself\u2026!\u2019The wrist device was an important item that a Traveler would not be able to live without on the continent. They did not have the innate ability to check status messages or inspect their stats without the wrist device. unlike the Continentals. That was why a Traveler without their wrist device was no different from a castaway in this world.\u2018They can\u2019t increase their stats even if they level up, and they can\u2019t read item descriptions either.\u2019The wrist device was attached in a way that even the user would not be able to detach it from their wrist. The only way for a Traveler to lose their wrist device would be to have their wrist cut off.\u2018The faces they make when they can no longer see the status messages everyone else can see\u2026\u2019 David thought, his expression filled with ecstasy. Those expressions appearing on Travelers\u2019 faces were the main reason why he only chose to abduct them.\u2018I have quite a lot of wrist devices at the ruin now.\u2019 The mountain of wrist devices he kept at the ruin was a testament to the number of murders he had carried out.He followed the green dot shown on his wrist device, arriving at a place where a group of travelers was about to set up camp. \u2018There are two men and two women, and that expressionless man must be the Traveler, judging by the fact that he is the only one wearing a wrist device.\u2019The description given to him by his Ruin Master class ability had mentioned that the party consisted of one Traveler, two Continentals, and one monster.David\u2019s brow rose as he read the last line again. \u2018A monster?\u2019He had been expecting to see a Tamer class adventurer, as he had encountered a lot of them invade his ruin, but all he saw in the group were four normal humans. Was there something wrong with his unique class skill?\u2018I can always recall back to the ruin if things go wrong for some reason anyway, so I don\u2019t have to worry so much,\u2019 he thought.The reason why David felt confident leaving his \u2018home territory\u2019, the Shy Doll ruin, was because he had certain measures in place to protect him in case of an emergency. He had another skill, \u2018Recall to Ruin\u2019, that was unique to his Ruin Master class; it allowed him to instantly teleport to the heart of his ruin in case of any danger he faced outside. Of course, the skill was limited to only one use a week, but that was more than enough to serve him as a precaution when he went outside.David walked toward the group and asked them, \u201cWhere are you from?\u201d Asking his victims where they were from before he killed them was one of his hobbies, after all.Kang Yoon-Soo, the man with the wrist device, slowly replied, \u201cSomewhere in Korea.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m from Singapore, Singapore,\u201d David replied.Shaneth was on guard as she asked, \u201cWho are you to suddenly ask where we\u2019re from? Also, what does \u2018Singapore, Singapore\u2019 mean?\u201d\u201cThe capital of Singapore is a city called Singapore,\u201d David replied just as he always did. He twitched a finger in his pocket, and the bush behind Kang Yoon-Soo suddenly shook.Kwachik!\u201cYou were an intermediate rank?\u201d David remarked, frowning.Henrick easily deflected the mana threads David had shot out with one hand before saying coldly, \u201cYou did quite well hiding your mana threads, but you have too many unnecessary movements. You\u2019ve never properly learned how to be a Puppeteer from anyone, have you?\u201d\u201c\u2026Are you a Puppeteer as well?\u201d David asked in surprise.\u201cThat\u2019s none of your business,\u201d Henrick said as he twisted the mana threads in his hand. A combat doll that was hiding in a bush suddenly moved according to his command.\u201c\u2026What the hell?\u201d Henrick muttered as he scrunched his eyebrows. The combat doll that emerged from the bush was not a wooden doll, but rather a doll made out of a human. Tied to the mana threads was a woman who was holding a bow with her left hand, which had been replaced with a prosthetic arm.Henrick could not hide his surprise and anger as his face crumpled. He exclaimed, \u201cYou\u2026 Fuck! you crazy bastard! Did you turn a corpse into a doll?!\u201dDavid quickly pulled out a knife from his breast pocket and hurriedly cut off the mana threads, then took out his doll summoning box. He summoned twenty combat dolls at once, commanding, \u201cKill them!\u201dShaneth readied her scythe, but she could not hide her surprise as she exclaimed, \u201cT-they all look like humans!\u201dThey were not ordinary combat dolls. They looked no different from real human beings who were just connected to a bunch of threads, from the sword-wielding doll that looked like a man to the staff-wielding doll that looked like a woman.\u201cThey\u2026 are all smiling\u2026\u201d Iris murmured, her eyes wide.The corpse dolls all had the corners of their mouths turned up high. The sight of the human-looking dolls wielding weapons and charging toward the party while smiling made the scene even creepier.Henrick gritted his teeth and shouted, \u201cWake up, you punks! They might look like humans, but they\u2019re nothing but dolls inside! You\u2019ll be six feet under if you get hung up on morality!\u201dThe corpse dolls moved at once; they were faster and more versatile than wooden dolls. Shaneth swung her scythe and blocked a sword that was aimed at her, but a fireball flew toward the back of her head and hit her.Fwaaaaah!Shaneth had been set ablaze by a fireball thrown by a corpse doll, but she swung her scythe even after being hit by the fireball and exclaimed, \u201cThanks!\u201dHenrick also mobilized his own combat dolls and shouted, \u201cAim for the Puppeteer and not the dolls! He\u2019s controlling them!\u201dDavid quickly moved his hands and maneuvered ten of his corpse dolls to block the path toward him.Kang Yoon-Soo drew his sword and called out, \u201cIris.\u201dIris immediately struck the ground with her fist. The earth splintered, kicking up all the dirt in a large area in front of her. It was a display of strength that would simply be impossible for a human.\u2018Is she the monster the system said was among them?\u2019 David thought, furrowing his brows.The dolls\u2019 formation was disrupted for a moment, and Kang Yoon-Soo immediately dashed in as soon as he saw the opportunity present itself, using a skill. \u201cAbyssal Sword.\u201dClang!A corpse doll that was in front of David hurriedly blocked Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s strike. David smirked as if he found the scene to be interesting, saying, \u201cYou\u2019re quite skilled with the sword.\u201dDavid knew these kinds of Travelers very well. Most of the Travelers who possessed such a level of swordsmanship usually had backgrounds related to the sword back in the real world as well. They normally went to a sword dojo, practiced swordsmanship, or trained in fencing.\u2018But those were nothing but recreational sports.\u2019David had killed more than ten people on the first day he had been summoned to this world. The reason he had been able to kill so many people immediately on the first day was not that he was a skilled fighter or anything, however. It was all about his mental fortitude and willingness to kill.\u2018Young people like him tend to have more conscience and a useless sense of justice.\u2019That was one of the main reasons why David used the corpse dolls when he went out to hunt and abduct Travelers. The corpse dolls each had a hand and wrist missing, but they looked no different from normal humans; that was because they had been created from the actual corpses of the Travelers he had killed.\u2018That\u2019s why an opening will definitely present itself,\u2019 David thought confidently. The Continentals were a bit more used to it, but cutting down another human being was not something that a normal person who had just come from the real world could do without feeling guilty. Besides, how many people were there who could cut down an innocent human being?David retreated behind the corpse dolls, summoning ten more. He thought, \u2018He\u2019s bound to hesitate at least once, and I just have to wait for that opening to take care of him.\u2019The corpse dolls he had summoned this time were the ones that looked the youngest among his collection, ones he had set aside specially. The logic of human beings hesitating to kill someone was something David could not understand, but that truth of human nature alone made him certain that Kang Yoon-Soo would hesitate and stop swinging his sword at least once.\u2018I can create a better doll if I get my hands on the corpse of a strong and tenacious one like him. He\u2019s going to be excellent material,\u2019 David thought happily. However, things went contrary to his expectations.\u201cAbyssal Sword.\u201dSukeok!Kang Yoon-Soo mercilessly cut down the corpse dolls in front of him. The head of a corpse doll that resembled a young child was crushed, and its blood spurted all over like a fountain. However, Kang Yoon-Soo did not stop even for a second and kept swinging his sword; he did not show an ounce of sympathy for the corpse dolls, nor did his expression change even once. In fact, the movements of his sword turned even more ferocious as he cut a path through the corpse dolls, charging toward David.\u201cWhat the hell is this?\u201d David muttered. He could not stop snickering at the sight of the man carving out a path toward him. He felt a sense of familiarity and kinship with the man, rather than being surprised at his mercilessness and coldness.\u201cYou\u2019re quite good at killing people,\u201d he said.\u201cThey\u2019re nothing but dolls anyway,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.\u201cBut you crushed the head of such a young kid without a hint of remorse. Don\u2019t you have a child of your own? Ah, you look quite young, so I doubt you have one,\u201d David remarked.Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s gaze had been indifferent the entire time, but it suddenly turned ferocious and hostile for the first time. He recklessly dove into the army of corpse dolls and charged toward the Puppeteer. However, David waved both of his hands and five corpse dolls suddenly attacked Kang Yoon-Soo all at once.Clang!Shaneth\u2019s scythe, Henrick\u2019s combat dolls, and Iris\u2019 fists crushed the corpse dolls, and the sound of the dolls\u2019 bones and muscles breaking reverberated across the forest.David tilted his head in confusion and asked, \u201cAren\u2019t you guys bothered by this? People usually feel hesitant to kill these corpse dolls because they look no different from normal human beings.\u201d\u201cOf course I\u2019m bothered by it, but I\u2019d hate to see Kang Yoon-Soo getting hurt more than anything else,\u201d Shaneth replied with a hint of anger in her voice.David could not understand what she meant at all. He was about to scratch his head in confusion when he noticed that his left hand was missing. The wrist that had been equipped with his wrist device was on the ground in a pool of his own blood.\u201cEuk!\u201d David groaned and staggered backward.\u201cDie,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said, shaking off the blood from his sword.David\u2019s easygoing expression crumbled, and his face contorted to reveal his true colors. He laughed like a maniac while grabbing his wrist and exclaiming, \u201cYou! What the hell did you do back in our world?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t remember,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo nonchalantly replied.\u201cI\u2019m certain that you were a crazy bastard like me,\u201d David said, still laughing hysterically.\u201cThere are a lot of crazy bastards in the world,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said, thinking of the leader of the Black Tiger Clan, before he thrust his sword toward David\u2019s heart.\u201cI can reattach my hand with the Body Crafting Kit, and I have plenty of wrist devices stored in the ruin,\u201d David said with a creepy laugh.However, Kang Yoon-Soo did not give him any reprieve, thrusting his sword forward. Suddenly, David shouted, \u201cI hope we\u2019ll meet each other again! Recall to Ruin!\u201dKang Yoon-Soo\u2019s sword narrowly missed David, who disappeared into thin air. Shaneth stared dazedly at the spot David had been in just moments before, stuttering, \u201cW-what\u2026 What the hell was that guy?\u201dHe had suddenly appeared out of nowhere and ambushed them before disappearing, and he had not seemed to be scared at all even though he was hurt.Henrick looked at the corpse dolls that were strewn across the ground, muttering, \u201cBody Crafting Kit\u2026?\u201d\u201cIt sounds exactly like your heirloom. Does that man also have a Body Crafting Kit?\u201d Iris asked.Henrick thoroughly investigated the corpse dolls that were littered on the ground. He checked the holes the mana threads had passed through, and he also checked the areas that had been stitched together. He let out a sigh and said, \u201cThis\u2026 It seems this is going to be annoying to deal with.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Shaneth asked while tying up her blood-drenched hair.\u201cIt\u2019s a long story to explain step by step, but if I were to start with the most shocking thing\u2026\u201d Henrick trailed off before dropping a huge confession. \u201cMy ancestor was a psychopathic serial killer.\u201dThe rest of the party casually nodded.\u201cI know,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.\u201cIs that so?\u201d Shaneth asked.\u201cI knew it,\u201d Iris said.Henrick was dumbfounded by their reaction. He exclaimed, \u201cHey! What\u2019s with that reaction that makes it sound as if it\u2019s an obvious thing?!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He continued, \u201cSo I\u2019ll summarize the whole thing.\u201dHe coughed once to clear his throat and explained, \u201cThere was a man named \u2018Rick\u2019 among my ancestors, and he developed two Body Crafting Kits while going on a serial killing spree. Afterward, he decided to resurrect his victims, but he left one Body Crafting Kit as a family heirloom and hid the other one in his workshop that only he knew about.\u201d\u201cHis workshop?\u201d Shaneth asked.\u201cIt\u2019s called a workshop, but it\u2019s actually an extremely large ruin. Ha! I wonder how a madman like him ended up with such a fortune,\u201d Henrick grumbled. He then continued his story. \u201cAnyway, nobody was able to find the Body Crafting Kit he hid in the ruin. It\u2019s said he hid it somewhere for his successor to find, according to my great-grandfather.\u201d\u201cThen are you saying that the man from a while ago who was controlling the puppets could be Rick\u2019s successor?\u201d Shaneth asked.\u201cYes, because he has the Body Crafting Kit,\u201d Henrick responded with a nod. He continued, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t really care if he has it or not, but it\u2019s not that simple.\u201dShaneth gulped before muttering, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me\u2026?\u201d\u201cThe Body Crafting Kit can also be used to turn a corpse into a doll, and it seems that that bastard used it to create his corpse dolls,\u201d Henrick said.\u201cCreating a doll out of a corpse\u2026 Is that even possible?\u201d Shaneth asked.\u201cIt\u2019s possible if you submerge it in antiseptic so the flesh won\u2019t rot, then cover it with mana. A doll made out of a corpse is far more powerful than those made out of wood, because the skills and abilities the owner of the corpse had in life can be used by the corpse doll,\u201d Henrick explained.Henrick stabbed his sculpting knife into the ground a few times in annoyance, grumbling, \u201cBut turning a corpse into a doll is something only a bastard would do, no matter how I look at it. I think that guy doesn\u2019t have an ounce of humanity in him.\u201dAlthough he was usually laid back and relaxed, Henrick was visibly angry for the first time ever as he said, \u201cAbove anything else, the successor to Madman Rick is given one special item.\u201dKang Yoon-Soo suddenly finished for Henrick, \u201cThe Final Masterpiece.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m already tired of asking \u2018how did you know that?\u2019,\u201d Henrick said with a sigh of resignation.Iris asked, \u201cWhat is the Final Masterpiece?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the best doll Rick ever made. It\u2019s said to be far more beautiful and stronger than any other doll in this world,\u201d Henrick said.Kang Yoon-Soo nodded and said, \u201cLet\u2019s steal it.\u201dThe party was silent for a moment. Henrick was the first to break the silence, asking, \u201c\u2026Are you serious?\u201d\u201cYeah,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied nonchalantly.Looking back on his previous lives, Kang Yoon-Soo knew the Final Masterpiece was an absolute necessity for their journey. He would not have bothered to go to the Shy Doll Ruin in the first place if not to steal the Final Masterpiece.\u2018It\u2019s a lot faster than my original plan,\u2019 he thought.He had originally planned to take on the ruin after gathering enough party members because it was crawling with hundreds, no, thousands of combat dolls. Many preparations were necessary to challenge the ruin.\u2018But I don\u2019t have time to waste from now on,\u2019 he thought, having decided to start conquering all the obstacles as quickly as he could from now on. The Demon Lord was going to appear much earlier than before, and what he needed was to move as efficiently as possible in preparation to face the Demon Lord.\u2018It\u2019s reckless to face him head-on,\u2019 he thought. David was crazy, but his ruin was well prepared, with traps meticulously placed all over it. However, Kang Yoon-Soo had no plans to use Yuriel this time.\u201cDo we have to fight against those human-looking dolls again?\u201d Shaneth asked, sounding disgusted.\u201cWe don\u2019t have to,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.\u201cHow so?\u201d Henrick asked.Kang Yoon-Soo took out the horse bone riddled with purple spots and said, \u201cWe\u2019ll use this.\u201d***David rolled onto the floor as soon as he was teleported to his ruin. He staggered across the floor and chose a left hand from his pile of body parts. The hands he had cut off the Travelers all had wrist devices attached to them.\u2018It was the right choice to preserve these in antiseptic so the flesh wouldn\u2019t rot,\u2019 he thought as he took out the Body Crafting Kit with his right hand. He then started to precisely sew a left hand onto his left arm. It had only lasted for a short moment, but he had definitely been in danger.\u2018I can still use my skills even without the wrist device,\u2019 he thought in relief. The only thing that would await him if he failed to activate his Recall to Ruin skill was certain death.He finished attaching the left hand to his left arm, then checked his new left hand for any problems by opening and closing it a few times. Then, he checked his new wrist device to see if it worked as well. Fortunately, both his new left hand and his new wrist device seemed to work perfectly without any problems.\u2018It\u2019s safe now.\u2019He was the owner of the Shy Doll Ruin, and he was confident that nobody would be able to beat him as long as he stayed in the heart of the ruin.\u2018I\u2019m confident I can fight against a five-thousand-strong army as long as it\u2019s within my ruin.\u2019IT was not just David\u2019s baseless confidence. The ruin had all sorts of traps installed in it along with the thousands of combat dolls, and it was also designed like a maze such that anyone who dared to invade his ruin was bound to either die or get lost within it. It was not only that, however.\u2018My abilities and stats are greatly enhanced as long as I\u2019m within the heart of the ruin.\u2019Another unique characteristic of his \u2018Ruin Master\u2019 class raised all of his abilities and stats as long as he was at the heart of the ruin, and it also increased his life force the more enemies he faced while he was there. David was the worst boss monster anyone could face as long as he remained in that place.\u2018It\u2019s a shame I couldn\u2019t turn that guy into my doll,\u2019 he thought. The expressionless young man had amazing swordsmanship, even though he had only seen it for a short while. \u2018He could have been a combat doll far stronger than any knight on the continent if I had used him as a material.\u2019It was a shame, but it was already in the past. David thought he would let bygones be bygones as he lay down on his dusty bed and closed his eyes in preparation for what the next day had to offer.***Morning came, and sunlight penetrated into the ruin through a broken window.However, David woke up right before noon. He thought with a yawn, \u2018I\u2019m tired.\u2019The very first thing he did every morning was to check on his \u2018treasure\u2019 before anything else. David went to the heart of the ruin and opened a chest that sat atop an altar.\u2018It\u2019s safe in here.\u2019The Final Masterpiece had been left behind by Rick, and could be considered the only masterpiece doll ever created. A single glance would be enough to make anyone stare for a minute, becoming immersed in its sheer beauty.\u2018It\u2019s already this mesmerizing for a murderer like me. I wonder how mesmerized an artisan would be\u2026?\u2019 David thought as he rubbed his chin.The Final Masterpiece was not only beautiful, but also strong as well. However, it would only be possible for someone who had mastered both puppeteering and artisanship to be able to use it.\u2018I can always just increase the level of my puppeteering, but I have no idea why this bothersome artisanship is also required,\u2019 David complained inwardly. Unfortunately, he could not use the Final Masterpiece, as his skills were still lacking.David rummaged through the belongings of the Travelers he had murdered and took out some food for breakfast. He was not a fan of food, nor was he a gourmet, so stale bread and some water were more than enough to satiate his hunger.\u2018I have to inspect my dolls.\u2019David always inspected his dolls at least once a day. He always checked if there were any damaged or broken parts on his dolls. The corpse dolls were an important part of his ruin\u2019s defense mechanism, and he could not afford to be lazy when it came to maintaining them.\u2018I can control these dolls even without mana threads, but it\u2019s absolutely important that I maintain them.\u2019That was one of the characteristics of the Shy Doll Ruin. The Shy Doll Ruin gave the Ruin Owner the privilege of controlling their dolls even without having any mana threads attached, as long as they were inside the dungeon.\u2018I can control all the dolls in the ruin.\u2019Leadership was an absolute necessity when it came to large-scale combat, as there were bound to be a few troops that would run away if morale fell. However, there was no need to worry about morale or desertion when it came to combat dolls.\u2018There\u2019s nothing special today, as always.\u2019David lined up all of the corpse dolls in single file and started to inspect them one by one. The corpse dolls had eyes void of any emotion, but they all had huge grins on their faces. However, there was no special reason for David to have made the dolls smile like that.\u2018It\u2019s just good to smile, right?\u2019 David thought, snickering. He continued, \u2018You adorable things! Hehe!\u2019 He had a lot of affection and love for his dolls.\u201cI like you guys a lot. Do you like me as well?\u201d David asked. The dolls did not respond, but he seemed happy, as if he had heard them respond back to him.It was at that moment that he found something out of the ordinary.\u2018Hmm?\u2019It was the corpse doll that had gone out to scout in the forest earlier that day. The doll had been made from the corpse of a female Ranger, and it was wearing a skimpy, revealing outfit. A purple spot of some sort was visible on her shoulder.\u2018What\u2019s this?\u2019 David thought, scratching the purple spot with his nails. It was not an ordinary spot on the surface of the doll\u2019s skin; rather, it seemed to be something that spread beneath the skin.\u2018Did she get bitten by a bug in the forest or something\u2026?\u2019 David thought, deciding to quarantine the corpse doll for a while. He sent the corpse doll with the purple spot to a dirty corner of the ruin.The Shy Doll Ruin was very dirty, as David had never bothered to clean it even once, thinking, \u2018What\u2019s the use of cleaning it if it\u2019ll just get dirty again?\u2019David had had no sense of hygiene back in the real world. That had been especially true when he was locked up, serving prison time. Hygiene was unimportant to David because he thought it was a bother and he was alone anyway. Besides, the corpse dolls were all fully sterilized and covered with mana, so he had no fear of them rotting or decaying.\u2018It\u2019s another boring day.\u2019David took a walk around the ruin, then went out for a stroll before returning to the heart of the ruin. There was an old, worn-out bed there, and David proceeded to lie down on it.\u2018I hope something exciting happens tomorrow.\u2019Living in the ruin had been fun at the start. He had killed countless intruders, and it had also been exciting to watch his doll army grow in numbers. However, he was already sick and tired of it all.\u2018This place is starting to feel like a prison,\u2019 he thought as he slowly closed his eyes.***The morning came again, David woke up just before noon once again, and he checked the Final Masterpiece as he always did. The beautiful doll was still curled up in the box, as usual.\u2018I\u2019ll definitely use you once my skill reaches the pinnacle.\u2019 It was the same thing David told himself over and over again every morning.He went up the stairs to the first floor of the ruin. He had stationed numerous corpse dolls all over the ruin on every floor.\u2018\u2026What the hell?\u2019 he thought, blinking a few times.Seven corpse dolls were covered in purple spots all over their bodies, and it looked as if they had been poisoned after ingesting poisonous mushrooms or something of that sort.\u2018How did this happen?\u2019Two of the seven dolls had never stepped out of the ruin. David closely inspected the dolls once again; he found that it was not a simple matter of the dolls having spots all over them, but that their flesh was starting to rot and fall away as well.\u2018How could this be? I sanitized them and even covered them with mana.\u2019He quickly walked toward the corpse doll he had quarantined the previous day. A vile odor invaded his nose when he got closer to the area where he had placed the doll. The first corpse doll to have manifested the purple spots was already severely decomposed, and had flies buzzing around it.\u201cIt\u2019s such a waste, but I guess I have to burn these,\u201d David said to himself.He decided to burn the corpse dolls within the ruin, since it would only attract the beasts of the forest if he burned them outside. He lit a fire and burned the corpse dolls that were infected with the purple spots in a corner of the ruin.A question suddenly popped into his head. \u2018Why did these guys suddenly start to rot?\u2019The antiseptic and mana he had applied to the corpse dolls should have naturally prevented the decay of the corpses, but the flesh had still rotted regardless, and that could only mean one thing. Something else had infected the corpse dolls.David\u2019s heart suddenly sank when he realized, \u2018Don\u2019t tell me\u2026 A virus?\u2019It was highly possible that one of his corpse dolls had contracted an infectious virus from the wild. They were only called dolls, but that did not mean they could not be infected; they were corpses after all. Additionally, it could not be helped that they were much more prone to getting infected than usual; they were more vulnerable and had weaker immune systems than wild animals.\u2018Damn it! I never thought the corpse dolls would have such a weakness!\u2019 David cursed inwardly.He took out all of the antiseptics Rick had left behind, and he poured bottle after bottle over all of the places he frequented in the ruin. He wanted to ventilate the ruin fully, but he could not do so because the ruin was enclosed from all sides.\u2018Should I leave the ruin for a bit?\u2019 he pondered.However, he soon shook his head and decided that it was impossible. \u2018The Ruin Owner class will lose their rights to the ruin if they leave the ruin for more than two days.\u2019It was the ruin he had nurtured ever since the day he was summoned to the continent; he could not simply give up such a precious ruin no matter how dire the situation was.\u2018It\u2019ll be alright since I sterilized the whole place with antiseptics,\u2019 David consoled himself as he slowly fell asleep.***When morning came, David rushed to the first floor and called all of his corpse dolls. He found that twenty-eight of his dolls had purple spots all over their body.\u201cDamn it! This can\u2019t be happening!\u201d David screamed, pulling his hair and gritting his teeth.Did infections usually spread this fast? He had no way to find out how to combat the disease, as he did not even know its name. There was no one to ask, since the ruin was in a secluded forest and this was also a primitive world with not much medical knowledge compared to the real world; it did not have any proper medical facilities.\u201cDamn it!\u201d David cursed as he scratched his left hand, which had been itching since that morning.\u2018What the hell? Why is it so itchy? Did a mosquito bite me or something?\u2019 he thought as he scratched the left hand that was irritating him.He looked at his left hand, and he saw that a large purple spot had bloomed on it.!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 96": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Record of a Thousand LivesChapter 97Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u2018I\u2019m infected by the disease,\u2019 David thought, and a chill went down his spine. He was someone who had not stopped smiling even when his left hand was cut off, but the fear of being infected by an unknown disease was quite different.\u2018What the hell is this disease? Is this something like a pestilence or the Black Death?\u2019 he thought nervously.David could always attach another body part if he lost one by using the Body Crafting Kit, but a disease was a different story altogether. There was no way for him to replace his whole body if he ever got infected with a disease.\u2018Damn it! There\u2019s no better place for a disease to thrive than here, now that I think about it!\u2019 he cursed himself. He never cleaned the ruin and it was very dirty, and the corpse dolls frequently went in and out of the ruin, which made it the ideal environment for pathogens.\u2018Also, I\u2019m the only living organism in this ruin,\u2019 he thought before realizing how scary that was. The infected corpse dolls could no longer be considered his subordinates; instead, they were now enemies that could potentially infect him with diseases.\u2018Damn it! Why did I attach a corpse\u2019s left hand, of all things?!\u2019 he cursed as he scratched the purple spot on his left hand until it started to bleed.David could not remove the left hand he had attached using the Body Crafting Kit. It would have been a different story if he attached a doll\u2019s hand, but the human hand he had attached was now considered a part of his body.\u2018It\u2019s possible that the infection spread faster because I attached a human hand.\u2019 A chill suddenly traveled down his spine the moment he realized that. Perhaps the dead Travelers were carrying out their vengeance against him.\u2018What will happen if I get infected by this disease?\u2019 he thought as his back broke out into a cold sweat. He had been overconfident, thinking he could face anyone as long as he stayed within his ruin.\u2018But I can\u2019t even fight against this disease\u2026!\u2019 he thought, gritting his teeth. He would have preferred to face an extremely strong monster if this was how things were going to be. There was no way for him to fight against a virus he could not even see, and consequently, there was no way for him to win against it either. In fact, was there even a way for anyone to win against a virus?\u201cCough! Cough!\u201d David started coughing, as his throat had become so itchy that he felt as if he were about to go insane from it. He looked at his hand and saw that he had coughed out a mixture of phlegm and blood.\u201cFuck! Cough! Fuuuuck!\u201d he screamed angrily, but there was nobody to direct his anger at. He felt as if he might go insane. The disease was nothing short of divine punishment.\u2018I can\u2019t just sit still and do nothing!\u2019 he thought as he stood up and burned all of the dolls that had purple spots on their bodies. He contemplated whether he should cut off his right hand, which had also become infected with the purple spots, but he decided against it.\u2018The disease has already infiltrated my body, judging by the fact that I\u2019m now coughing up blood.\u2019 He coughed violently while looking for something he could use as a mask. However, his neglect of the ruin\u2019s cleanliness had come back to bite him, as he could not find a single clean cloth to use.\u2018Damn it!\u2019 He had never thought he would resent himself for not cleaning the ruin and just lazing around all day.Finally, David managed to find a clean shirt. It was the shirt of a Traveler he had killed in the past, that he had kept as a keepsake. He tore the shirt apart and made a makeshift mask to cover his mouth and nose.\u2018I can\u2019t stay here after knowing that a disease outbreak has occurred. Let\u2019s go to a nearby village and get treated first,\u2019 he thought. He packed a few bottles of antiseptic and some personal belongings before leaving the ruin.[You have exited the Shy Doll Ruin.][The skill \u2018Recall to Ruin\u2019 is still on cooldown.][You will lose ownership of the ruin if you do not return within the time limit.][Time Remaining: 47 hours, 59 minutes, 59 seconds.]\u2018Damn it\u2026 I have no time\u2026\u2019David had to hurry and return to the ruin as soon as possible if he wanted to maintain his ownership of it. There had indeed been an outbreak in the ruin, but he had burned all of the infected corpse dolls. David still had a lingering attachment to the ruin, and he could not simply abandon it.\u2018Let\u2019s hurry.\u2019He was not sure whether there was even a cure to the disease, but he had to at least try to have it cured\u2014or at least find out the name of the disease, even if it killed him.\u201cCough! Cough!\u201d Every time he coughed, the amount of blood increased. Knowing that time was not on his side, he walked all night to reduce as much travel time as he could.Right on the brink of dawn, he found a small spring. The spring water was a little bit stagnant, but the water looked clean regardless.\u2018I have to get rid of the virus in my body. Let\u2019s wash first.\u2019David undressed and washed himself, then poured all the antiseptics he had on his body. At that point, he realized that the purple spots had now spread all the way up to his chest.\u2018This disease is heavily infectious. I wonder how high the fatality rate is?\u2019Fatality rate was the chance of an infected patient dying from the disease. There was a high chance that he was going to die of the disease if its fatality rate was high, but that also meant he had a high chance of surviving if it was low.\u2018I\u2019ll definitely survive this!\u2019 David thought, clenching his fists. There was no way he was going to succumb to a disease just like that. He bit his lips until they started to bleed.\u2018I\u2019ll survive as long as my heart keeps beating\u2026!\u2019 he thought, resolving to survive no matter what happened.Suddenly, a blade pierced through David\u2019s heart.\u201cKuheok!\u201d he groaned in pain.\u201cWow, this dude was really here!\u201d Henrick exclaimed in surprise, while using the mana threads in his hands to control the large sword-wielding wooden doll that had stabbed David through the heart.\u201cD-damn\u2026 Damn you\u2026!\u201d David cursed while gasping for breath.\u201cThat punk Kang Yoon-Soo told me to come here, so I did. But who knew you would be here leisurely taking a bath? Isn\u2019t the water cold?\u201d Henrick asked.David started to vomit blood as he struggled in pain. However, Henrick did not give him a moment\u2019s reprieve, controlling his wooden doll to drive the sword deeper through David\u2019s heart. He then openly mocked David, \u201cYou killed so many people, but you wish to survive?\u201dThe wooden doll twisted its sword and crushed David\u2019s heart, and an unimaginable pain spread throughout his body.\u201cEaaaahahahakk!\u201d David screamed in pain as he struggled wildly to fight back; however, he could not resist at all, because he was completely naked and did not have any weapons or his summoning box. However, he gathered all his strength and spat out blood toward Henrick as a last stand. \u201cHnnngh\u2026 Ptui!\u201d\u201cUgh, what are you doing?\u201d Henrick grumbled as he wiped the blood off his face with a disgusted expression.\u201cHehehe\u2026 You\u2019re now infected by the disease as well\u2026!\u201d David said, smirking at the thought of bringing someone else down with him.\u201cI already took the cure for this, you punk,\u201d Henrick retorted.\u201c\u2026\u201dDavid breathed his last and died in the pool of spring water, which had been dyed red with his own blood.[You have killed the owner of the Shy Doll Ruin, David Abi.][You may collect the treasure at the heart of the Shy Doll Ruin.][You are an Artisan.][You have attained the required puppeteering skill level.][Do you wish to take over the position of Rick\u2019s Successor?]\u201cRick\u2019s Successor?\u201d Henrick muttered, blinking a few times in confusion.\u201cYou\u2019ll be able to have an easier time controlling your dolls,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.\u201cCan you please not sneak up behind me like that?\u201d Henrick exclaimed, jumping in surprise when Kang Yoon-Soo suddenly showed up beside him. He cleared his throat and continued, \u201cI\u2019m thankful that you told me where this guy would be, but don\u2019t you usually deal the final blow?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not a Puppeteer,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied nonchalantly.Kang Yoon-Soo would certainly have killed David if he had chosen to be a Puppeteer in this life, but he had no intention of becoming a Puppeteer in this life at all. Additionally, he knew from previous experience that it would be much more efficient and effective if he let Henrick take the role of Puppeteer in this life.\u201cLet\u2019s go and collect the treasure of the ruin,\u201d he said.\u201cWhat about the other two?\u201d Henrick asked, referring to Iris and Shaneth who were still asleep at their campsite.Kang Yoon-Soo shook his head and said, \u201cWe\u2019ll be the only ones going.\u201d\u201cWhy? Is there something disgusting waiting for us?\u201d Henrick asked.Kang Yoon-Soo did not say anything and merely nodded in affirmation.***Kang Yoon-Soo had used the horse bone to infect the corpse dolls that went out to scout outside the ruin. The corpse dolls were easily infected because they were dead, and they also spread the infection quite rapidly.[You have infected the dolls in the Shy Doll Ruin with a fatal disease.][Total number of infected\u2014117.][You have successfully caused an outbreak.]\u2018It was very effective to fight through biological warfare,\u2019 Kang Yoon-Soo thought.The one thing that could neutralize an advantage in level or numbers was an outbreak of an infectious disease. In fact, it was arguably even more effective than being a necromancer who continuously raised undead to fight.Henrick could not help but frown, remarking, \u201cYou scary bastard. What would you have done if the disease spread to nearby areas?\u201d\u201cThe investigators would have stopped it,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied nonchalantly with a shrug.That was the specific reason why he had asked for 1st Grade investigators to be deployed, since the whole continent would be in danger if the disease spread all over instead of being contained.\u2018There aren\u2019t many vectors for the disease to spread since the outbreak happened in the ruin,\u2019 Kang Yoon-Soo thought.The two men walked through the forest, but Kang Yoon-Soo, who was walking in front, suddenly turned in a different direction.\u201cHey, you punk, that\u2019s not the way that bastard\u2019s footsteps came from,\u201d Henrick said.\u201cThere\u2019s somewhere we have to stop by before we go to the ruin,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied as he walked toward a secluded area.As they entered the forest depths, they heard the cries of beasts growing louder, and a person shouting ahead of them.\u201cYou dare to think you can fight against me?!\u201d an old man wearing a black robe shouted as he swung a black staff. Wherever the old man swung his staff, the leaves in the forest withered, and all traces of life faded.Facing off against the black magician was a group of investigators wearing official uniforms. Their leader called out, \u201cThe black magician is almost dead! We have permission from the headquarters to kill him. Don\u2019t hold back and keep attacking him!\u201dWhile hiding behind a bush together with Kang Yoon-Soo, Henrick whispered, \u201cIs that the black magician you were talking about?\u201d\u201cYeah,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.It was the black magician who had spread the infectious disease, and he seemed to be on his last legs as the investigators\u2019 onslaught of attacks kept pouring in. The old man seemed as if he might die at any moment, as he struggled to prop himself up by supporting himself with his black staff.It was then that Kang Yoon-Soo suddenly made his move. \u201cAbyssal Sword.\u201dKang Yoon-Soo\u2019s sword stabbed through the old man from behind. The old man gasped, \u201cW-Who are you\u2026? Kuheok!\u201dKang Yoon-Soo twisted his sword before the black magician could finish speaking, and the old man died on the spot.[You have killed Orikel, the black magician who caused a plague.][You have gained ownership of all the items in the black magician\u2019s dimensional pocket.][You have obtained seven Seeds of Plague.][You have obtained four Corrupted Crosses.][You have obtained the Staff of Plague.]Kang Yoon-Soo had suddenly shown up and dealt the final blow\u2014it was a kill-steal.\u201cWhat the hell! Who are you?!\u201d\u201cHow dare you kill someone in front of us investigators?!\u201dThe investigators angrily approached him; judging by their flashy uniforms, they were visibly high-ranked. Their bodies glowed, as they had been blessed to prevent them from catching the disease while fighting against the black magician.Kang Yoon-Soo did not bother to reply, instead pulling out the amulet around his neck and showing it to them.\u201cI-it\u2019s the Zero Grade Dragon\u2019s Claw Amulet!\u201dThe investigators all shouted in surprise before lining up in an orderly fashion. A beautiful woman at the front of the line gave a salute before displaying a bracelet that had a phoenix engraved on it and calling out, \u201c1st Grade investigator Sheryl and fourteen others reporting!\u201dThey were the 1st Grade investigators who had been dispatched after receiving Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s report.Kang Yoon-Soo leisurely walked up to Sheryl and patted her shoulder, saying, \u201cGreat job.\u201d\u201cYes, sir!\u201d Sheryl replied.The investigators had just been engaged in a battle, but none of them seemed to be tired at all. The 1st Grade investigators were the strongest among them.\u2018The Royal Special Investigation Unit,\u2019 Kang Yoon-Soo thought.They were the investigators who were acknowledged by the royal palace, and they were routinely dispatched to different branches of the empire. They possessed far superior stamina and combat prowess compared to average investigators, and their swordsmanship did not fall behind that of the knights at the royal palace.\u2018They\u2019ll find me suspicious if I stay with them longer.\u2019They were different from those Kang Yoon-Soo had conned in the past. They were people who had the extraordinary ability to discern whether the person in front of them was a fraud or not, and there was no guarantee that he would be able to escape their suspicions even if he displayed remarkable acting.\u201cI was investigating the cases of Travelers going missing in these parts when I saw you guys. It really feels good to see that my juniors are doing a great job,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.\u201cDo you mean you were investigating at this hour?\u201d Sheryl asked. Her tone was gentle, but it was evident that she was interrogating Kang Yoon-Soo.Kang Yoon-Soo nodded casually and said, \u201cOf course. Ah, now that I think about it, you seem to be from the Vulpehin branch judging by the wings engraved on your bracelet. Is Sir Rapentahil doing well these days?\u201d\u201cHe is still on active duty,\u201d Sheryl replied.\u201cI am glad he is still as active as ever. It feels like yesterday that he burned his mustache while chasing after that arsonist,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said. A few of the investigators let out a laugh in response.\u201cAre you acquainted with Sir Rapentahil?\u201d Sheryl asked.\u201cHmm\u2026 Have you guys heard of his endless nagging yet? He was quite an earful back in the day,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo remarked.\u201cHaha! We get that every day until we are sick and tired of it. He is obsessed with accruing merits all the time,\u201d Sheryl said. However, she raised a brow before she asked suspiciously, \u201cYou seem to be quite young. Are you from a recent batch?\u201dKang Yoon-Soo looked at her for a moment. He could deduce that Sheryl was the strongest one among the investigators present, and he could also tell that she was almost on par with a knight captain in terms of her level and her combat prowess.He cleared his throat before replying, \u201cI am a Traveler, as you can see. I was specially promoted earlier than the others, just like you guys.\u201dKang Yoon-Soo leisurely dodged the question. The investigators might have had sharp instincts when it came to detecting lies, but Kang Yoon-Soo had the knowledge from his previous lives. That was one of the main reasons why all of his lies were just too believable.\u201cAnyway, I heard that permission was given to kill him so I stepped in to help, but I hope I did not offend you guys,\u201d he continued.\u201cNot at all; we are thankful that you took care of the black magician for us,\u201d Sheryl replied.\u201cThen, keep up the good work,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said, before raising a salute and leaving.However, Sheryl\u2019s gaze fixated on Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s back for quite a long time.\u201cDid you manage to fool them?\u201d Henrick asked from behind the bush.\u201cI think so,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.\u201cBe careful. It won\u2019t end with just jail time for you if you get caught impersonating an investigator,\u201d Henrick said, yawning and scratching his cheek.Suddenly, however, he stared at Kang Yoon-Soo and said seriously, \u201cHey.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.Their gazes met.Henrick took out a bottle of alcohol from his back, and Kang Yoon-Soo took out a bottle of transparent alcohol at the same time. They then mixed both of the drinks they had in equal proportions.\u201cI knew I could count on you when it came to this,\u201d Henrick said, snickering.\u201cI guess,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.The two men clinked their bottles and drank while they walked toward the ruin.!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 97": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Record of a Thousand LivesChapter 98Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe Shy Doll Ruin was hidden deep within a lush, overgrown forest that twisted and turned like a maze. The road toward it did not have any rules or patterns, but it was basically a jungle path that required the adventurer to cut through numerous large tree branches to navigate it.It was around the time that they cut through the seventh tree branch that the pair found the entrance.\u201cMaybe it\u2019s because it was Rick\u2019s workshop, but it looks beautiful, as opposed to those ruins that are crawling with monsters,\u201d Henrick said.Henrick had a point. The Shy Doll Ruin was bigger than the Yultika Ruin, but smaller than the Winterkill Ruin. However, what really made the Shy Doll Ruin stand out from the previous two ruins was its artistic aesthetics. The ruin\u2019s roof had very nice eaves engraved with flowers, and the pillars were engraved with intricate designs.\u2018I made something like that in my previous life when I inherited the skill of the dwarves,\u2019 Kang Yoon-Soo thought. When he saw that Henrick was still admiring the ruin with his mouth wide open, he said to the other man, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dHenrick, whose nose was bright red from the alcohol, shook his head and said, \u201cMaybe it\u2019s because I had a drink, but I don\u2019t feel like going into the ruin.\u201dRuins usually had hundreds of monsters inhabiting them, and just because the ruin had lost its owner did not mean the two of them would be able to leisurely stroll in and take whatever they wanted\u2014of course, Kang Yoon-Soo and Shaneth had conquered a ruin with no other assistance in the past.Creak\u2026An eerie chill greeted them once they opened the door and entered the ruin. The Shy Doll Ruin did not have an ounce of life in it, and the floor was littered with blood splatters and rotten organs.\u201cDid that bastard never even bother to clean? No wonder he got infected so quickly,\u201d Henrick grumbled.The two of them had already drunk the concoction of medicinal herbs Kang Yoon-Soo had made, so they were not worried about getting infected by the disease.[You have entered the Shy Doll Ruin.][This place is filled with mana that makes it easier for combat dolls to move in it.][You will be able to move your combat dolls even without your mana threads.][However, a combat doll that has lost its master will rampage.]\u201cW-wait, what? A combat doll that\u2019s lost its master?\u201d Henrick exclaimed with a nervous expression. He continued, \u201cHey\u2026 Don\u2019t tell me\u2026?\u201d\u201cGet ready,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said, unsheathing his sword.Just then, an army of corpse dolls started charging toward them like a tidal wave from the other end of the ruin. Some of the dolls crawled along the walls, while others walked across the floor toward them.\u201cThe combat dolls can still move without mana threads?\u201d Henrick exclaimed as he took out his summoning box. He then summoned all of the combat dolls he had in his possession, amounting to over five hundred dolls in total.\u201cLet\u2019s do this!\u201d Henrick shouted confidently as he crossed an arm over his chest.Five wooden combat dolls Henrick had summoned, as large as the ruin\u2019s pillars, walked forward and smashed the incoming corpse dolls. Kang Yoon-Soo also charged into the wave of the corpse dolls and slashed them one by one.Sukeok!Dark red blood splattered all over the place whenever Kang Yoon-Soo slashed a corpse doll, as the dolls had been made out of human bodies. The two men could see that blood was still flowing within the corpse dolls, and that their organs were still working.\u201cI knew it. It was a wise choice to have a drink before coming in here,\u201d Henrick muttered as he observed the disgusting sight of the corpse dolls turning into mincemeat.However, the two kept sweeping over the corpse dolls regardless of how disgusting and repulsive it was. In a way, they were killing the dead again.\u201cIt was a good choice not to bring those two,\u201d Henrick remarked.\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.Anyone who had a weak stomach\u2014or rather, anyone else, regardless of who they were\u2014would not be able to help; rather, their mental health would suffer if they witnessed the scene of the two men slaughtering the corpse dolls. The corpse dolls collapsed one by one, lying in pools of their own blood on the floor.Henrick frowned and dusted off a bottle of alcohol before asking, \u201cDo you have more booze?\u201d\u201cHere,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied, tossing a bottle to Henrick.\u201cBooze has never tasted sweeter than it does today,\u201d Henrick said after downing the whole bottle of strong alcohol. As expected, Kang Yoon-Soo did the same.They continued heading into the ruin while leaving behind the bloody mess they had caused. They then went down a staircase leading to the lower level.\u201cI smell antiseptics,\u201d Henrick said, sniffing a few times.Kang Yoon-Soo pointed to a room and said, \u201cThis is the room where he kept the corpses.\u201dThere were coffins lined up in one corner of the room; inside them were corpses that looked like sleeping humans.\u201cBut why do all of them have one hand missing?\u201d Henrick asked.\u201cThey\u2019re all Travelers,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.David had been a serial killer who only targeted Travelers, and cutting off the hands that bore their wrist devices had long been a hobby of his.\u2018Wrist devices\u2026\u2019 Kang Yoon-Soo thought as he looked around. He opened a chest in another corner; it was filled with hands that had wrist devices attached to them. The hands had been cut off and kept, since nobody could remove the wrist device from a Traveler\u2019s arm.\u201cHe was a crazy bastard, alright,\u201d Henrick remarked as he left the room looking disgusted.The two walked into the heart of the ruin; they were able to reach it quite easily, since the ruin\u2019s owner was already dead. There, they found a large box atop an altar.\u201cThe Final Masterpiece is in that box,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said, pointing toward the box.\u201cReally?\u201d Henrick asked with a hint of skepticism in his voice. He continued, \u201cCan I really take it? You\u2019re not going to charge me for it later, are you?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re the puppeteer,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.\u201cIt\u2019s just that this is the first time I\u2019ve ever seen you give up the reward,\u201d Henrick remarked. He cleared his throat a few times before walking up the stairs toward the altar. He then rolled back his sleeves and opened the box.[You have conquered the Shy Doll Ruin.][Conqueror: Henrick Elrickerson][Rank 1 Achievement: Kang Yoon-Soo]Kang Yoon-Soo was not the conqueror of the dungeon, because Henrick was the one who had killed the ruin\u2019s owner, David.\u2018It\u2019s only right for Henrick to take this ruin, judging from the treasure alone,\u2019 Kang Yoon-Soo thought. He had decided that monopolizing all of the rewards and treasures would only make things difficult and inefficient in the future. He was willing to share all the rewards as long as they could kill the Demon Lord.Meanwhile, Henrick peeked inside the box. He then looked back at Kang Yoon-Soo with a dumbfounded expression, exclaiming, \u201c\u2026What the hell is this?\u201d\u201cThe Final Masterpiece,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.Henrick looked back inside the box; a beautiful young girl was lying inside it. The girl had a slender body and a slightly revealing outfit. \u201cHey, it looks more like a human than a doll, no matter how I look at it,\u201d he said as he carefully tapped the girl\u2019s shoulder.Then, the young girl\u2019s eyes suddenly opened. She stared at Henrick with eyes as clear as crystal.[Rick\u2019s successor has surpassed the required artisanship and puppeteering skill levels.][You will now be able to control the Final Masterpiece.]The black-haired young girl stared at Henrick for a moment before saying, \u201cHello.\u201d\u201cWhat are you?\u201d Henrick asked.\u201cRick,\u201d the girl replied.\u201cRick?\u201d Henrick frowned and said, \u201cRick was my ancestor, and he was also a psychopathic serial killer.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s me,\u201d the beautiful young girl said.It was difficult to tell whether she was a young girl who looked like a doll, or a doll who looked like a young girl. She stretched her arms, and her thin blouse fell slightly, revealing some of her skin.\u201cDid I sleep for a long time?\u201d the girl asked.\u201cNo, you can go sleep more,\u201d Henrick said as he tried to close the lid. However, Rick\u2019s hand stopped the lid from closing. The young girl looked quite slender and frail, but she was incredibly strong despite her appearance.\u201cDid you wake me up?\u201d Rick asked.\u201cI just opened the box, that\u2019s all,\u201d Henrick replied.He was instinctively wary of the young girl in front of him. She looked quite frail and beautiful at a glance, but the way she had introduced herself had a sinister air. Rick was a serial killer from the past, but the young girl or doll or whatever she was had claimed to be that same serial killer.\u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d Henrick turned around and asked Kang Yoon-Soo.Kang Yoon-Soo nonchalantly replied, \u201cThe Final Masterpiece is Rick himself.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Henrick asked.\u201cHe turned himself into a doll as his final work,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.\u201cThat crazy bastard!\u201d Henrick exclaimed.Rick brought a long, slender finger to her lips and touched them a few times before asking, \u201cAre you a puppeteer?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Henrick replied.The young girl\u2019s fingers touched the hem of Henrick\u2019s shirt. She brought her small nose closer to him and sniffed him, remarking, \u201cYou smell like booze.\u201d Henrick seemed to be bothered by her actions, and pulled his shirt away from her.\u201cUse me as your doll,\u201d Rick suddenly asked Henrick.\u201cI don\u2019t want to, you punk,\u201d Henrick replied coldly with a hint of annoyance in his voice.Rick stared at Henrick with her crystal-clear eyes and asked, \u201cWhy not?\u201d\u201cBecause I\u2019m not fond of crazy bastards,\u201d Henrick replied, his annoyance clearly audible in his tone. Rick was a psychopathic serial killer, and Henrick felt as if he had awakened that serial killer with his own hands.\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d Rick asked.\u201cHenrick Elrickerson,\u201d Henrick replied.\u201cSo you\u2019re my descendant?\u201d Rick asked. She checked Henrick out from head to toe before continuing, \u201cYou look quite fun to kill, you know.\u201d\u201cI hear that a lot,\u201d Henrick replied with a shrug.Rick could not hide her smile and said, \u201cI like you.\u201d\u201cDo you still feel like killing me?\u201d Henrick asked sarcastically.\u201cYes, I want to strangle you to death,\u201d Rick said with a smile.\u201c\u2026This is driving me nuts,\u201d Henrick muttered, biting his lip. He turned around and shot Kang Yoon-Soo a resentful look, exclaiming, \u201cHey! You punk! You knew it was going to turn out like this, which was why you passed it to me, didn\u2019t you?!\u201d\u201cNope\u2026\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo lied brazenly with a straight face.***\u201cWhy don\u2019t you explain to me what\u2019s going on?\u201d Henrick asked.\u201cI don\u2019t feel like it,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.Henrick quietly took out his sculpting knife as he seriously contemplated stabbing the man in front of him. Only then did Kang Yoon-Soo say, \u201cTry touching Rick\u2019s forehead.\u201dHenrick brought his finger to Rick\u2019s forehead.[Madman Rick]Race: Living DollAffinity: UndecidedCurrent Mental Condition: Good\u201cI understand what \u2018race\u2019 is, but what the hell are \u2018affinity\u2019 and \u2018current mental condition\u2019?\u201d Henrick asked with a frown.Kang Yoon-Soo gave him a long explanation.Affinity meant the direction of Rick\u2019s growth. Rick was a doll, but she could grow as well, unlike normal combat dolls. She could end up becoming anything from a combat doll to a knitting doll, depending on how she was raised.\u201cThink of her as your daughter,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.\u201cThat thing is\u2026 my ancestor\u2026 you punk,\u201d Henrick replied with a frown.Rick\u2019s current mental condition was as written. She would alternate back and forth between sanity and insanity. All of her stats would increase explosively whenever she went mad, but she would indiscriminately attack allies as well.\u201cIn short, it\u2019s a ticking time bomb,\u201d Henrick said as he looked at Rick. Rick looked like a young girl no matter how he looked at her, and he was torn over whether he could really order a little girl to go into combat. He grumbled, \u201cI really hate being in this position. How the hell am I supposed to command a little girl like that to fight?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s strong,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied simply, and that was true. Rick had the potential to become the strongest combat doll, depending on how she was nurtured.\u2018Of course, it all depends on how Henrick nurtures her,\u2019 Kang Yoon-Soo thought. It was not possible for him to get involved with the way the doll was going to be brought up, but their journey would become vastly easier if Henrick decided to nurture Rick properly.\u2018\u2026Although it\u2019s a fact that it\u2019s a double-edged sword,\u2019 Kang Yoon-Soo thought. Rick\u2019s mental condition went back and forth between normal and psycho mode, and that would also depend on how well Henrick controlled Rick.\u2018This is all to make the journey to the magic tower easier,\u2019 Kang Yoon-Soo thought.Henrick walked toward Rick and said, \u201cLook here, my dear ancestor. I\u2019ll use you. I\u2019m a puppeteer, after all.\u201d\u201cAlright,\u201d Rick nodded obediently.Henrick took out a small box from his pocket and asked, \u201cCan you go into the summoning box?\u201d The summoning box was where he normally stored his puppets.\u201cLet me take a walk first,\u201d Rick said.Fortunately, Henrick did not have to be with Rick all the time. He let out a sigh of relief before asking, \u201cA walk?\u201d\u201cI want to take a walk outside the ruin,\u201d Rick said.\u201cWhy? Haven\u2019t you been outside before?\u201d Henrick said.\u201cI can\u2019t leave the ruin without a Puppeteer to command me,\u201d Rick explained, showing Henrick a tiny hole in her body. A mana thread was supposed to be passed through the hole.Henrick\u2019s face crumpled as he passed a mana thread through the hole, then said, \u201cThere. Are you happy now?\u201d\u201cTry controlling me,\u201d Rick said.Henrick lightly shook the hand his mana thread was attached to, and Rick\u2019s body started to move as he wanted.Rick nodded, seemingly satisfied, before saying, \u201cYou\u2019re quite good at controlling me. Keep up the good work even when we get out of here.\u201dThe three people, no, the two men and the doll, ascended to the upper level of the ruin. The smell of blood from the corpse dolls immediately enveloped them.\u201cThe smell of blood\u2026 Hehe.. Hehehe\u2026 Hahaha!\u201d Rick suddenly broke out into a sinister laugh.Kang Yoon-Soo suddenly said, \u201cLet\u2019s pick her up and get out of here.\u201d\u201cThis is driving me crazy!\u201d Henrick grumbled as he grabbed Rick\u2019s shoulder and picked her up.Rick slowly started to return to normal once they were a distance away from the corpse dolls that were emitting the smell of blood. Her body suddenly fell down as soon as they were out of the ruin, just like a normal doll.\u201cMake me walk,\u201d Rick said.Rick had looked exactly like a human in the ruin when she could walk without the help of any mana threads, but she looked more like a doll now that she was helpless outside the ruin. Henrick slowly connected his mana threads, then made Rick slowly take a few steps before starting to walk.\u201cThe weather is really good. How long has it been since I felt the sun?\u201d Rick exclaimed as she continued walking barefooted. Surprisingly, her feet were fine no matter how many steps she took barefooted on the rugged terrain.\u201cCome to think of it, can this one not get infected by the Sudden Death Syndrome disease?\u201d Henrick asked.\u201cIt\u2019s made with the best materials one can find, so it won\u2019t get infected by any disease,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo explained.\u201cSo it\u2019s an expensive body, huh,\u201d Henrick said.The two men followed the leisurely walking young girl as they walked all the way back to their campsite. Shaneth was already up early in the morning and was making breakfast. When she saw the two coming, she turned around and asked them, \u201cWhere did you go so early in the morning?\u201dSeeing Rick, she then exclaimed, \u201cOh?\u201d She looked at Rick and asked with a smile, \u201cWho might this pretty little lady be?\u201dHenrick replied in a completely serious tone, \u201cSay hello to my grandmother.\u201d\u201c\u2026Have you been drinking so early in the morning?\u201d Shaneth asked.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She said, \u201cMake me kill this butterfly.\u201d\u201cAre you mad?\u201d Henrick exclaimed.\u201cOr else I\u2019ll kill you,\u201d Rick threatened him.\u201cYou can\u2019t move without my mana threads,\u201d Henrick said with a shrug.\u201cI can cut your mana threads and move if I go mad,\u201d Rick said with a straight face.Henrick\u2019s face crumpled as he moved his hand that was connected to the mana threads and maneuvered Rick to catch the butterfly. He said while furrowing his brows, \u201cHow the hell am I supposed to raise that thing\u2026\u201dShaneth and Iris had been surprised to hear what had transpired overnight while they were asleep.\u201cShould I just stuff that thing into the summoning box?\u201d Henrick whispered.\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea. It\u2019s still considered to be one of the best dolls on the continent, after all. It\u2019ll end up helping us if all goes well,\u201d Shaneth said. She suggested, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you start by changing Rick\u2019s temperament?\u201d\u201cIf it is raising a child, I want to give it a try,\u201d Iris said confidently. She walked toward the young girl and said, \u201cRick, let go of that butterfly.\u201d\u201cWhy should I?\u201d Rick asked.\u201cLife is precious, no matter how small it is,\u201d Iris said.\u201cI remember seeing it in a book before. This butterfly is edible,\u201d Rick said.\u201c\u2026Really?\u201d Iris asked, staring at the butterfly.Shaneth quickly grabbed Iris by the shoulders and dragged her away. She then came back and said, \u201cLet me give it a try.\u201d She approached Rick and asked, \u201cRick, why don\u2019t you put yourself in the butterfly\u2019s place? Do you see how painful it would be if a giant pulled on your wings?\u201d\u201cI like pain too,\u201d Rick said with a smirk.\u201c\u2026\u201d Shaneth was speechless.The two women stared at Rick, and Henrick shook his head before saying, \u201cI give up. Little kids don\u2019t suit me well.\u201d\u201cWell, it does seem like that. You don\u2019t get along with kids, right, ahjussi?\u201d Shaneth replied.\u201cHey, you punk! Even though that doll looks young, it\u2019s more than a hundred years old! Why do you think I call it my grandmother?\u201d Henrick grumbled.The three focused their gazes toward one person, and Kang Yoon-Soo, who was drinking alcohol from a bottle, firmly said, \u201cNo.\u201d\u201cIf someone asked me who the most unsuitable person to look after a kid would be\u2026 I would pick that guy, and then me,\u201d Henrick said.However, Shaneth shook her head and suggested, \u201cHow about the summons instead of Kang Yoon-Soo? I think Sally would get along very well with Rick.\u201dKang Yoon-Soo extended his right hand and muttered, \u201cSummon Sally.\u201dA fire blazed in mid-air and Sally appeared from it. The small girl looked around for a bit, and her face brightened when she saw Rick. She said excitedly, \u201cHi!\u201d\u201cHi,\u201d Rick replied dryly.\u201cWho are you? My name is Sally!\u201d Sally exclaimed with the same excitement.\u201cI\u2019m Rick,\u201d Rick replied with the same lack of enthusiasm.\u201cNice to meet you! Let\u2019s play!\u201d Sally offered, smiling brightly. She was very excited to have found a girl her age to play with.\u201cSo it\u2019s a spirit,\u201d Rick said with a smile as she put the butterfly in her pocket. The two little girls sat down facing each other.\u201cHmm\u2026 I want to play with dolls, but I don\u2019t have any dolls!\u201d Sally said.\u201cI do,\u201d Rick said. She took out two dolls from underneath her dress; they looked too beautiful to be used by children as toys.\u201cWow! Amazing!\u201d Sally smiled brightly at the sight of the two dolls Rick had pulled out, and the two little girls looked at each other and smiled brightly.Henrick\u2019s hand hung in mid-air to allow Rick to move freely as she wished. Rick would be able to move as she liked if Henrick maintained a loose grip on his mana threads. Henrick remarked, \u201cThey seem to be getting along quite well.\u201d\u201cRight? Kids should play with kids their age. They usually get along very quickly,\u201d Shaneth said.However\u2026 The peace did not last long.Sally\u2019s eyes opened wide, and her voice trembled as she exclaimed, \u201cRick broke Sally\u2019s doll!\u201d\u201cI wanted to break its neck and kill it. Tsk,\u201d Rick remarked.\u201cW-Why would you kill the doll\u2026?\u201d Sally asked, her voice trembling.\u201cIsn\u2019t that how you play with dolls? Kekeke!\u201d Rick replied.\u201cWaaaaah! Papa!\u201d Sally cried, running over to Kang Yoon-Soo and clinging to him.Shaneth let out a sigh as she said, \u201c\u2026I don\u2019t think Sally is cut out for this.\u201dKang Yoon-Soo returned Sally to the summon dimension, then sent out the next summon. He muttered with his right hand extended, \u201c Summon Acle.\u201d\u201cPhew! Finally, we\u2019re out of the desert!\u201d Acle said, looking pleased and rejuvenated.\u201cAcle,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo called out.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Acle responded.Kang Yoon-Soo pointed at Rick. Acle grimaced as he glared at the young girl and grumbled, \u201cAh\u2026 You\u2019re trying to make me babysit again\u2026 Heuk!\u201dAcle suddenly grabbed his chest. His chest, which had been as cold as ice ever since he was born, started to beat wildly. He was completely mesmerized by the young girl who looked innocent, and yet very refined.\u201cY-You\u2026 What\u2019s your name?\u201d Acle stuttered, struggling to get the words out.\u201cRick,\u201d the young girl replied.\u201cDo you need a crown, by any chance\u2026? This is an extremely valuable crown\u2026!\u201d Acle took off the crown he treasured very much, but Rick just shook her head.It was at the moment that Acle was about to pass the Frozen Crown to Rick that Kang Yoon-Soo suddenly snatched the crown away.\u201cY-You bastard!\u201d Acle screamed in surprise.\u201cGo back,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo commanded. Acle was not even given the chance to argue as he was sent back to the summon dimension by force. The reason why Kang Yoon-Soo had summoned Acle in the first place was to retrieve the Frozen Crown from him.Kang Yoon-Soo called out the next summon, extending his right hand again and muttering, \u201cSummon White.\u201d\u201cGrwaaaaah!\u201d White roared as it appeared out of thin air. The werewolf seemed to have grown a lot stronger than the first time Kang Yoon-Soo had picked it up from the Yultika Ruin.Kang Yoon-Soo commanded it, \u201cConvince Rick.\u201d\u201c\u2026Rimakuro. Rakedun,\u201d White growled, which meant, \u201cI don\u2019t want to, but I have no choice but to follow your command, master.\u201dWhite slowly approached Rick and growled, \u201cRakurmor.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cKimorjyana?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cHakimok. Hakimok.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cRachumirm? Hakimokril.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026Urnokra!\u201dWhite cried out, and Kang Yoon-Soo sent it back to the summon dimension.Henrick laughed awkwardly and asked, \u201c\u2026Why the hell did you summon a werewolf?\u201d\u201cRight, werewolves are scary,\u201d Iris added as she appeared from behind a tree where she had been hiding while shivering. Werewolves were always scary for a doppelganger like her.Kang Yoon-Soo called the last summon he had, extending his right hand for the last time and muttering, \u201cSummon Mini-Lich.\u201dA short skeleton holding tightly onto Nakron\u2019s Codex appeared and said, \u201cTeacher, there are many strange writings in this codex. I think there are some secrets hidden behind the strange characters, but I can\u2019t seem to understand them at all.\u201d\u201cThose are about Nakron\u2019s private life; you don\u2019t have to understand them,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.\u201cThank you,\u201d Mini-Lich responded gratefully.Kang Yoon-Soo then pointed at Rick and said, \u201cGo convince Rick.\u201dMini-Lich walked toward Rick and said, \u201cI smell the scent of death on you.\u201d\u201cAh, a skeleton. You make me want to kill you,\u201d Rick said.\u201cYou can\u2019t kill me,\u201d Mini-Lich replied.\u201cHow come?\u201d Rick asked.\u201cI\u2019ll never die unless my life vessel is destroyed,\u201d Mini-Lich replied.\u201cThen I just have to break that,\u201d Rick said with a shrug.\u201c\u2026\u201d Mini-Lich was speechless, as it had only ended up revealing its weakness. It was soon sent back to the summon dimension as well. In the end, all of the summons had failed to convince Rick to change her mind.Henrick withdrew his mana threads and said, \u201cWell, I never expected a lunatic to turn normal all of a sudden anyway.\u201dHe stored Rick in his summoning box, and the little girl disappeared into the box. He grumbled, \u201cI\u2019ve lived alone my whole life, and now I have to take care of a kid. This is driving me crazy\u2026\u201d\u201cI told you, didn\u2019t I? You can be indifferent to how women think all you want, but it\u2019ll come back to bite you later on when a woman comes into your life,\u201d Shaneth said with a snicker.\u201cWho knew this was how a woman would come into my life?\u201d Henrick grumbled once more.Kang Yoon-Soo recalled a previous life when Henrick had nurtured Rick alone, and Rick\u2019s class back then had ended up being \u2018Alcoholic\u2019.\u2018\u2026it\u2019s a relief we have other people in our party this time,\u2019 Kang Yoon-Soo thought.That was one of the reasons why he had even called out all of his summons\u2014including the werewolf. Rick had the potential to grow into an extremely strong combat doll who would assist her owner, but the opposite was also possible, and she could become a completely useless doll.All of them were necessary to kill the Demon Lord.\u2018I have to hurry up,\u2019 Kang Yoon-Soo thought. He was pressed for time now that he knew this was going to be his final life and that the Demon Lord would be appearing much faster than he previously had.\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.Their destination, Vulpehin, was only a short distance away. They packed up their things and left the forest.\u201cWe would not have to walk if Whitey were still alive\u2026\u201d Iris said while sniffling.\u201cThat thing with that horse again. Aren\u2019t you tired of it?\u201d Henrick remarked, openly mocking Iris.\u201cHenrick is really heartless,\u201d Iris said with tears in her eyes. She clenched her fist tightly, as if she were about to punch him at any moment.Henrick suddenly took something out of his pocket and gave it to Iris before she could throw a punch. It was a small figurine of a white horse that could be held in one hand.\u201cHenrick?\u201d Iris exclaimed, looking at him with surprise.\u201cI\u2019ll give you that, so stop crying about it,\u201d Henrick said.The figurine was pure white and looked quite nice, and anyone could see that the sculptor had made it with all sincerity.Shaneth smiled at the sight, remarking, \u201cAre you finally trying to understand how a woman thinks?\u201d\u201cHey, you punk! I just happened to find a piece of Linden wood lying around,\u201d Henrick shot back.Linden wood was known to be soft and white inside, and it was the perfect fit for sculpting ta white horse.\u201cI don\u2019t usually give out these kinds of things because I find it childish, but I had one left over today. Well, you could use it as firewood if you\u2019re cold later at night,\u201d Henrick said.\u201cThank you, Henrick,\u201d Iris said as she stroked the figurine of the white horse. She repeated, \u201cThank you\u2026 Really\u2026\u201d Tears started welling up in her eyes.The White Shadow that was inside her suddenly transmitted a thought. \u2018Get over it\u2026\u2019***\u201cSomething is off\u2026\u201d Sheryl said.The 1st Grade investigators with her were all surprised by her sudden remark. They knew from firsthand experience that Sheryl saying such a thing meant something was up.\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d one of them asked.\u201cThat man,\u201d Sheryl replied.Sheryl was quite famous among the investigators. She had caused an uproar among the senior investigators in the department when she was promoted three grades at once at a young age, but what had surprised everyone was the fact that she did not seem bothered by the uproar. Additionally, Sheryl was famous for her outstanding instincts and gut feelings that were proven correct most of the time.\u201cAre you talking about the Zero Grade investigator we met yesterday?\u201d the other investigator asked, referring to the man who had shown the Dragon Claw Amulet.The other 1st Grade investigators nodded in unison and said, \u201cWe were bothered by it as well.\u201d\u201cIt would be impossible for a commoner to know about the Zero Grade investigators, as well as the stories about Sir Rapentahil\u2019s temperament. Also, the Dragon Claw Amulet he showed looked so real that I almost suspected it to be the real thing from a dragon,\u201d another investigator said. He continued, \u201cBut it sounded like he was trying to convince us that he was a Zero Grade investigator. It was as if he were trying to say \u2018I am a Zero Grade investigator. Believe me.\u2019\u201dIt was not proper for an investigator to accuse someone without any evidence based only on their instinct, but these 1st Grade investigators possessed instincts that were almost at the level of the supernatural. Their minds that spent countless hours and days reading case report after case report were compelling them to suspect the man.\u201cI will go to the headquarters myself,\u201d Sheryl said.The other investigators were surprised. They were in the process of burning corpse dolls that had been infected by the Sudden Death Syndrome disease, with handkerchiefs wrapped around their mouths and noses. They had found the ruin littered with corpse dolls that had purple spots all over their bodies, just like the infected creatures they had seen previously.\u201cDo you really have to go now? You can stop by on our way back to base,\u201d one of the investigators said.\u201cNo, I have to go now,\u201d Sheryl said firmly. She looked at the other investigators that were hard at work and continued, \u201cI am not trying to skip out of work.\u201dThe other investigators were surprised; it was as if she had read their minds. They had actually been grumbling inwardly because they felt they were not at the level of doing such menial work.\u201cCan you finish up here by yourselves?\u201d Sheryl asked.\u201cOf course, ma\u2019am,\u201d one investigator responded on behalf of the group.Sheryl immediately mounted her horse and left the forest. The investigators who were left behind all let out sighs and spoke among themselves.\u201cWhy is she acting like that?\u201d\u201cShe isn\u2019t someone to change plans so suddenly like that.\u201d\u201cWho knows? Maybe her majesty the queen has finally met a guy she thinks is suitable for her?\u201dThey all laughed.Sheryl was known for her beauty and figure, but she was equally known for her cold personality. It was to the point that all of the senior investigators who had had their eyes on her all turned back after experiencing firsthand why she was nicknamed \u2018her majesty the queen\u2019.\u2018This is bugging me\u2026 Something is off,\u2019 Sheryl thought while riding her horse, as her blonde hair flew behind her neck. The image of the man she had met was still freshly engraved in her memories.\u2018His eyes\u2026 They did not belong to someone his age,\u2019 she thought as she recalled the man\u2019s expressionless face and dead eyes. He might have put on a perfect act, but it was not enough to fool Sheryl\u2019s sharp instinct.\u2018His was not the aura of someone so young\u2026\u2019Sheryl had seen eyes similar to the man before. Those eyes were similar to the ones she had seen in a convict who had been on death row for decades. That was why she was so convinced that he was not an investigator.\u2018I could be wrong\u2026 But\u2026\u2019It was only her suspicion, without any evidence to back it up. However, Sheryl was someone who would get to the bottom of things one way or another, and it was that nature of hers that had allowed her to quickly be promoted to the rank of 1st Grade investigator.\u2018I just have to check if his name is on the Zero Grade investigator list,\u2019 Sheryl thought.The list of Zero Grade investigators was classified as a top secret document, but 1st Grade investigators like Sheryl had access to those files. She just had to check the list. It was as simple as that.\u2018I just have to check the list, and I\u2019ll leave it if his name is there.\u2019But what if he was not a real Zero Grade investigator?\u2018I will arrest him on grounds of impersonating an investigator and send him to receive judgment.\u2019Impersonating an investigator, and a Zero Grade investigator of all things, was a crime punishable as a capital offense; it was considered to be on the same level as the crime of impersonating a noble. The perpetrator could be sentenced to life in prison, or even sentenced to death by hanging, depending on the judge presiding over the case.\u2018That is\u2026 If my instinct turns out to be right\u2026\u2019Sheryl spurred her horse onward as she rode out of the forest.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 99": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Record of a Thousand Liveschapter 100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayBlood tells no lies.-a Vampire Lord\u201cWhy are there so many mosquitoes?\u201d Henrick complained in annoyance while swatting several mosquitoes buzzing around him.Shaneth fanned the campfire to let it smoke out the mosquitoes, and the insects instantly distanced themselves from the camp. \u201cTell me about it. There are more insects the closer we get toward Vulpehin City,\u201d Shaneth said.Iris glared at the mosquitoes and said, \u201cIt is unpleasant to have my blood sucked.\u201d Her body had been riddled with mosquito bites, while the others had only been bitten once or twice. She moved her hand toward her voluptuous cleavage and said, \u201cThe place the mosquitoes bit gets very itchy.\u201d\u201cHey, you punk! Don\u2019t do those things when you\u2019re in front of men!\u201d Henrick rebuked her immediately. However, Iris tilted her head in confusion, as if to show that she did not understand what Henrick meant. Henrick then clicked his tongue and said mockingly, \u201cPerhaps your blood is more nutritious than ours?\u201d\u201cWhy do you say so?\u201d Iris asked.\u201cDo I have to say it with my own mouth?\u201d Henrick said as he pointed at an empty pot and several breadcrumbs with his chin.Then, Iris suddenly fell deep into thought, seemingly pondering something serious. Henrick asked, \u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d\u201cCan I get back my blood if I eat the mosquitoes that bit me and sucked my blood?\u201d Iris asked, completely seriously.\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t think that\u2019s how it works, unni,\u201d Shaneth replied.Meanwhile, Kang Yoon-Soo sat peacefully while leaning on a tree. He could see the silhouettes of buildings in the distance\u2014it was Vulpehin City. He muttered, \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to this.\u201d\u201c\u2026What did you say?\u201d Shaneth exclaimed. She was shocked, as if she had heard something she had never expected to hear in her life. It was not only Shaneth; Henrick and Iris were also surprised by Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s statement.However, Kang Yoon-Soo had an expression that seemed to say \u2018what are you looking at?\u2019 as he continued, \u201cWine.\u201dHenrick suddenly nodded in agreement, saying, \u201cWell, the red wine of Vulpehin is quite famous for being the best of the best.\u201dIris\u2019 eyes suddenly shot wide open and she asked, \u201cDoes the red wine of Vulpehin taste that good?\u201d\u201cGood is an understatement. It\u2019s considered to be the most fragrant wine on the continent; the way it goes down one\u2019s throat can make one reminisce about the time one was breastfed, and its color can be considered to be the best under the heavens,\u201d Henrick replied dramatically.\u201cThat\u2019s quite a compliment. Have you ever had the chance to drink it?\u201d Shaneth asked, albeit a bit mockingly.\u201cI tasted a few glasses when I worked under her majesty the royal princess. It was really good,\u201d Henrick said, licking his lips.Shaneth\u2019s gaze seemed to imply that she was looking forward to it; she said, \u201cI want to try their wine as well.\u201d\u201cHoo\u2026 What happened to the little miss who always nagged us to drink less? Why are you getting worked up over wine all of a sudden?\u201d Henrick asked with a smirk.\u201cIt\u2019s because Kang Yoon-Soo and ahjussi always drink too much! I wouldn\u2019t be nagging if you drank moderately without getting so drunk, you know?\u201d Shaneth replied with a straight face.Henrick clicked his tongue a few times in response and retorted, \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of drinking if you won\u2019t get drunk?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you know that\u2019s the motto alcoholics live by until it ruins their lives?\u201d Shaneth replied with a sigh.\u201cYou talk like that because you haven\u2019t tasted how sweet a glass of alcohol can be when your life\u2019s on the brink of misery,\u201d Henrick said melodramatically.\u201cI have no intention of knowing how that feels until the day I die,\u201d Shaneth responded as she fed another piece of firewood to the campfire.\u201cI want to drink wine as well,\u201d Iris said enthusiastically, her voice filled with excitement.\u201cWhat? Didn\u2019t you say you didn\u2019t like the taste of booze last time?\u201d Henrick grumbled.\u201cBut still, I want to try it since you keep saying how good it is,\u201d Iris responded.\u201cYou\u2019re a strange one, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Henrick remarked with a sigh.A warm evening breeze swept through the camp, making the atmosphere feel cozy. The stars in the night sky twinkled like the innocent eyes of babies.Kang Yoon-Soo drank the last bottle of alcohol he had, thinking, \u2018We have to watch out for our blood this time.\u2019He was drawing up plans for the next fight they would enter. He always planned out how to carry out the next battle even before it would happen, using his experience from his hundreds of past lives to produce several tactics.\u2018The fastest and easiest way to win is\u2026\u2019He would draw up several battle plans and shortlist them based on how effective they would be, and would then choose the plan that would benefit him the most. He had developed a habit of asking himself whenever he was choosing a plan, \u2018What is my main objective?\u2019To kill the Demon Lord. To save the world.\u2018To find the one who should not exist in this world and complete the goddess\u2019 request\u2026\u2019And then\u2026\u2018To make sure none of these guys will die\u2026\u2019Kang Yoon-Soo drank as he observed his party members. They were people who had been related to him in all sorts of different ways in his previous lives. He had originally had no plans to accept Iris as a member this time, but then he had discovered the presence of the White Shadow within her.\u2018I have to find out more about the White Shadow once I finish things and return to the royal palace.\u2019That was still something he had to do in the distant future, but Kang Yoon-Soo had already made up his mind. \u2018None of these guys will die.\u2019He gripped the bottle in his hands tightly as he thought, \u2018I won\u2019t die either.\u2019He definitely planned to maintain the resolutions he made that night.The night continued, and the party fell asleep. Kang Yoon-Soo also fell asleep; strangely, however, he was not bitten by even a single mosquito that night.***The next day came.Henrick furrowed his brows furiously as he exclaimed, \u201cWhat the hell is this?!\u201d\u201cWine, what else?\u201d the wine shop\u2019s owner retorted.Henrick stared down at the short and tubby wine shop owner, retorting, \u201cExcuse you.\u201d However, the short tubby did not seem to be fazed or back down in front of the tall, tanned Henrick.Henrick said in a serious and slightly threatening voice, \u201cAre you looking down on us because we aren\u2019t from here?\u201d\u201cWhat did you just say? What do you take me for?!\u201d the owner retorted.\u201cA low-life scammer who fleeces the money of his customers,\u201d Henrick sharply retorted as well.The owner of the wine shop quietly walked toward a barrel of water. Shaneth instinctively knew that he was about to splash them with water and chase them out. She intervened between the two and said, \u201cDon\u2019t mind him, sir. Can you give us a bottle of wine?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s two silver coins,\u201d the owner replied curtly. The wine could be considered cheaper than the wine sold in other cities.Henrick walked out of the shop and grumbled with anger still in his voice, \u201cDoes that man want to close shop or something?\u201d\u201cWell, you weren\u2019t in the right either\u2026\u201d Shaneth said.\u201cHey, you punk! Look at this wine! Anyone would go nuts because of this!\u201d Henrick said.Shaneth observed the wine. She had seen different kinds of wine while serving in Lady Hermia\u2019s estate; it did not seem to look any different from normal wine. She then replied after examining the wine, \u201cThere doesn\u2019t seem to be anything wrong with it, though,\u201d\u201cThen try drinking it,\u201d Henrick said.Just as Shaneth was trying to figure out how to open the cork, Kang Yoon-Soo grabbed the wine bottle from her. He took out a knife from underneath his sleeve before stabbing it into the cork, twisting it, and pulling it out.Pop!The wine bottle opened with a clear sound.Henrick yawned and said, \u201cLook at this punk. You\u2019re a pro now, but where the hell did you get that knife?\u201d\u201cI bought it a while ago,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied before spinning the knife and storing it back in his sleeve.Iris said with an amazed expression, \u201cKang Yoon-Soo knows a lot of tricks. How do you keep the knife in your sleeve without dropping it?\u201d\u201cYou get used to it if you do it long enough,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.Shaneth carefully took a sip of the wine, and her face instantly crumpled. \u201cCough! Cough! Umfph!\u201d She coughed and gagged a few times before exclaiming, \u201cIt\u2019s too sour!\u201d\u201cI knew it,\u201d Henrick said as he took the wine bottle from her and took a swig from it. He remarked, \u201cHmm\u2026 It smells like a sewer, tastes like seawater, and the color is similar to sewage.\u201d\u201cWhy does it taste so bad? Was that shop the problem?\u201d Shaneth asked.Henrick shook his head and replied, \u201cNo, it\u2019s not only that shop. I glanced at the other shops on the way, and they were roughly in the same state.\u201d He then furrowed his brows and continued, \u201cThe wine they\u2019re selling in this city has become worse than normal water. What the hell is going on?\u201dThe party had arrived at Vulpehin City earlier that morning. They had been greatly looking forward to the famous red wine of Vulpehin, but were severely disappointed because the wine\u2019s quality was severely lower than what they had expected\u2014in fact, it was the worst wine they had ever had.\u201cI wondered why the city was so empty\u2026 I guess we\u2019ve found out,\u201d Henrick grumbled.The wine street that was the symbol of Vulpehin was empty to the point of desolation. There was not even one person walking around, which seemed unnatural, even if anyone tried to argue that it was because it was still early in the morning.\u201cWouldn\u2019t that affect the city\u2019s economy?\u201d Shaneth asked.\u201cAigoo\u2026 It\u2019s exactly as you say,\u201d someone suddenly said.The party\u2019s gazes all focused on one person. The person who had spoken was a hunched old man, supporting himself upright with a staff.\u201cWho are you?\u201d Henrick asked.\u201cOh my, I\u2019ve forgotten to introduce myself. I own a small wine shop in the back alleys, and I\u2019m a wine seller. I also own a plot of land in the grape fields. My name is Garmun,\u201d the old man replied.Garmun looked quite gloomy and depressed. Even before the party could ask him anything, the old man told them everything there was to know about the current state of Vulpehin.\u201cThe wine in our city was the best on the continent until recently. The wine tasters raved about our products, and Vulpehin was the first thing that would come to anyone\u2019s mind when anyone heard the word \u2018wine\u2019. However, everything crumbled in an instant,\u201d Garmun said. His hands started to tremble as he gripped his staff, and he continued, \u201cKobolds! If it weren\u2019t for those pesky kobolds, this wouldn\u2019t have happened!\u201dHenrick suddenly looked surprised and worried at the same time. He asked cautiously, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me\u2026 It\u2019s not something as clich\u00e9d as \u2018the kobolds took over the grape fields\u2019 or something\u2026 Right?\u201d\u201cHuh?! How did you know?!\u201d Garmun exclaimed in surprise.Henrick whispered to the others, \u201cHey, doesn\u2019t this sound like a generic storyline\u2026?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right. Everything will fall into place once he makes a request asking \u2018please take care of the kobolds that took over our grape fields\u2019,\u201d Shaneth said.Henrick and Shaneth looked quite nervous for some reason. They had learned an important lesson while on their journey: If things were going smoothly, something was bound to pop up and destroy the peace.\u201cIf only those damned kobolds hadn\u2019t taken over our fields! The production and quality of our red wine, the pride of our city, wouldn\u2019t have fallen like this! The anger inside me is killing me, I tell you!\u201d Garmun explained, shedding tears in frustration and anger. Then, he slowly got to the point, \u201cIf you, oh brave warriors, helped us reclaim our grape fields from the kobolds\u2026 Our city\u2019s economy would flourish once again and all would be well, but\u2026\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s only four of us. Wouldn\u2019t it be better to ask someone else?\u201d Henrick said. He felt nervous again as a thought crossed his mind. \u2018Don\u2019t tell me\u2026 He isn\u2019t going to say something clich\u00e9d again like \u2018We don\u2019t have anything to give as a reward, so the others refused to help us\u2019, is he\u2026?\u2019\u201cWe don\u2019t have anything to give as a reward, so the others refused to help us!\u201d Garmun cried loudly.\u201cHave you tried making a request to the mercenary guild in the city, then?\u201d Henrick asked.\u201cT-that\u2019s\u2026 The other shops prevented us from doing so\u2026\u201d Garmun responded with a hint of nervousness in his voice.\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Henrick asked with a brow raised.\u201cAh! It\u2019s not what you think it is! It\u2019s because the Wine Association doesn\u2019t have the funds to make a request!\u201d Garmun cried once again.Iris looked at the old man with eyes full of sympathy and said, \u201cSuch a pitiful and tragic thing happened to them. Should we not help them, at least?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cAre you crazy?\u201dKang Yoon-Soo and Henrick immediately shot down her suggestion. Then, Henrick walked toward the old man and remarked, \u201cWhat a joke. Are you asking us to work for free?\u201d\u201cW-we\u2019ll reward you with a crate of red wine\u2026!\u201d Garmun stuttered.\u201cHow much would a crate of red wine even cost? Also, we tried the red wine a while ago and it sucked,\u201d Henrick replied. He walked toward the old man and patted his shoulder a few times before continuing, \u201cLook here, old man. You might have mistaken us for a group of righteous travelers like the ones you\u2019ve heard of in stories of old, but those stories were all a sham. Do you think we\u2019re crazy? Why the hell would we help a stranger like you and hunt down monsters for such a shitty reward?\u201d\u201cB-but I heard the adventurers from the other world would usually help out if you asked them in this way\u2026\u201d Garmun replied.\u201cThat\u2019s because those guys from the other world are the strange ones. We don\u2019t know anything about that,\u201d Henrick said coldly. He continued retorting, \u201cIf you guys call yourselves the Wine Association, shouldn\u2019t you guys at least try to sell your remaining wine or declare bankruptcy to pay off some mercenaries and solve the situation? What were you planning to do, hold people walking in the street back while begging for help? We have no plans to help, so quit begging.\u201dGarmun turned around and looked around for a moment. When he noticed that Kang Yoon-Soo was wearing a wrist device, he decided to cling to him and cry out, \u201cAigoo! Please help us! Our situation will greatly improve if you manage to take care of at least two hundred kobolds!\u201dKang Yoon-Soo grabbed the old man\u2019s wrinkly hands. Garmun felt greatly touched, and he bowed to Kang Yoon-Soo and said, \u201cT-thank you! Thank you!\u201dHowever, Kang Yoon-Soo said something contrary to the old man\u2019s expectations. \u201cThe Wine Association will never recover from this.\u201d\u201cEh?\u201d Garmun was surprised and confused by the man\u2019s words.\u201cThe ones who took over the grape fields weren\u2019t kobolds. The kobolds are nothing but their underlings,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.\u201cUnderlings\u2026? Then who took over the grape fields?\u201d Garmun asked.\u201cVampires,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.Garmun\u2019s face turned pale as he yelled, \u201cT-that\u2019s impossible!\u201d\u201cAlso, your problems won\u2019t be solved just by reclaiming your grape fields\u2026 Will they?\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo added.The old man\u2019s complexion turned even paler with fright as he asked, \u201cH-how did you know about that\u2026?\u201dKang Yoon-Soo did not reply; instead, he let go of the old man\u2019s hands and turned around before walking away. Iris ran alongside him and said, \u201cKang Yoon-Soo is cold.\u201d\u201cThe reason why the Wine Association went bust wasn\u2019t because of the grapes,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo remarked.\u201cThen what was the reason?\u201d Shaneth asked.\u201cA commercial dispute between the shops,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.\u201cHe was just feeding us a sob story, then. I was wondering how the same wine merchants could be so different. You know, that old man and the guy we bought this shitty wine from,\u201d Henrick grumbled. He added, \u201cI get the gist of things, now that I think about it. That old man called Garmun holds a significant plot of land in the grape fields or something like that, and that\u2019s why the other shops are preventing any help from resolving the situation. In the end, they chose to all go bust together.\u201dHe then clicked his tongue and said, \u201cIt\u2019s still a shame that we didn\u2019t get to taste the real red wine of Vulpehin\u2026\u201dKang Yoon-Soo suddenly said, \u201cWe\u2019ll go to hunt the vampires in the grape fields when night falls.\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201d Shaneth and the other two exclaimed in unison.Henrick looked severely disturbed by Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s statement and asked, \u201cWhy the hell are we going there?\u201dKang Yoon-Soo turned around and said, as if the answer were obvious, \u201cTo drink the real red wine.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 100": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Record of a Thousand LivesChapter 101Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe investigation department\u2019s confidential file room was a place only 3rd Grade investigators and above could enter; additionally, any investigator lower than 1st Grade had to obtain permission prior to entering.\u2018The list of Zero Grade investigators\u2026\u2019 Sheryl went over a file cabinet that had not been touched for a long time, flipping through several files that were covered in dust. She meticulously went over all of the files one by one before finally reaching a conclusion.\u2018My hunch was right all along,\u2019 she thought.There had been a total of eleven Zero Grade investigators since the inception of the investigation department, and they all had corresponding pictures in the files, but the man she had met that night was not one of them. Additionally, no Travelers had been inducted as Zero Grade investigators in the history of the investigation department.\u2018He was an impostor posing as an investigator,\u2019 Sheryl thought calmly. She was not worked up by the fact that she had been fooled by an impostor, nor was she glad to have the chance to gain some merits through the event. She neatly rearranged all the files in order and walked leisurely back to the office.There, a man with a long mustache and a sombrero sat behind a desk sipping coffee.\u201cSir Rapentahil,\u201d Sheryl called out.Rapentahil, who usually dogged his juniors to go out and earn some merits for him, was usually not in his office and instead spent most of his time slacking off outside. It could be considered luck that he was in his seat at that exact moment.\u201cSheryl? You came back earlier than expected. Don\u2019t disturb my tea time if it\u2019s not going to get me any merits from the higher-ups,\u201d Rapentahil said.\u201cThere is someone going around posing as a Zero Grade investigator,\u201d Sheryl said.\u201cKuheok!\u201d Rapentahil choked on his tea and splashed it all over his pants. His composure went out the window as he immediately stood up and exclaimed, \u201cAn impostor is posing as a Zero Grade investigator?! What a fearless guy!\u201d\u201cPlease wipe your pants first,\u201d Sheryl said calmly as she handed a handkerchief to the man.Rapentahil immediately wiped his soiled pants with the handkerchief before clearing his throat and saying, \u201cAh, now that I think about it. What happened to that black magician who was spreading the plague? Did you take care of that?\u201d\u201cYes, sir. The other investigators and I were burning the corpse dolls that were the cause of the outbreak before I came over here,\u201d Sheryl replied.\u201cCorpse dolls?\u201d Rapentahil replied with a scoff. He continued, \u201cYou really do have some weird cases following you around. Do you remember that lady who acted like she was a young girl? The one who was doing it to inherit the assets left behind by that earl.\u201d\u201cI do not keep the details of closed cases in my mind,\u201d Sheryl replied.\u201cThat\u2019s not a good habit\u2026 Well, if it\u2019s someone of your caliber, that\u2019s a different story,\u201d Rapentahil said. He rubbed and twisted his long mustache before continuing, \u201cNow, who the hell is that fearless bastard who dared to pretend to be a Zero Grade investigator?\u201d\u201cIt was a Traveler from another world. We do not have any other information, aside from the fact that he is in his twenties based on his appearance,\u201d Sheryl responded.\u201cThat\u2019s not enough information\u2026 Wasn\u2019t there anything special about him? Something that might help identify him?\u201d Rapentahil asked.\u201cHe was extremely expressionless,\u201d Sheryl replied.\u201cThat sounds like you. Ah, who knows? It might be your soulmate!\u201d Rapentahil exclaimed with a snicker.Sheryl glared at him sharply. She had never once held any affection for a man. Rapentahil suddenly stiffened and hurriedly said with a fake cough, \u201cAhem, I was joking. It was just a joke.\u201dSheryl stared at Rapentahil and said, \u201cThe man even had the leisure to claim to have been acquainted with you, and told us stories about you.\u201d\u201cStories about me?\u201d Rapentahil asked with a confused expression.\u201cSomething about your non-stop nagging,\u201d Sheryl said.\u201cHey! When did I do that?!\u201d Rapentahil\u2019s voice boomed like thunder, causing nearby investigators to jump in surprise. Rapentahil\u2019s face was red as he said angrily, \u201cWhat a rude bastard. I swear I\u2019ll lock him up and make him rot in prison!\u201dSheryl changed the subject before the man could go on a tirade, saying, \u201cI am certain that the suspect will come here to Vulpehin. I saw familiar tracks on the way here from the forest.\u201d\u201cHoo, you even remember others\u2019 footsteps?\u201d Rapentahil asked, sounding impressed by her meticulousness.\u201cIs that not something basic?\u201d Sheryl responded. Rapentahil drank the remaining coffee and stood up, but Sheryl suddenly said, \u201cI will accompany you.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you just come back? You can go rest for a bit,\u201d Rapentahil replied.\u201cYou will not be able to recognize the man\u2019s face without me, no?\u201d Sheryl responded.\u201cI was about to ask you to give me a composite drawing of the bastard,\u201d Rapentahil said.Sheryl took a piece of paper and a quill from the table, then drew a sketch of Kang Yoon-Soo on the spot. She seemed to have drawn it quickly, but it was enough to recognize the suspect\u2019s main features.Rapentahil looked at the composite drawing Sheryl had made and asked, \u201cWill you still go? It\u2019s really fine if you decide to take a break.\u201d\u201cIt will be faster and more accurate if I investigate it myself,\u201d Sheryl replied.Rapentahil smirked and exclaimed,, \u201cAlright, let\u2019s go and catch that bastard who dared to pretend to be a Zero Grade investigator!\u201dThe cold female investigator and the chubby old investigator left the investigation headquarters.***Vampires were creatures who consumed blood and lived for eternity. They were known as the nobles of the night, and they were high-rank monsters well-known for their beauty and magical prowess.\u201cHow the hell are we going to hunt those things?\u201d Henrick asked.\u201cIt\u2019s just one\u2026 for now,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied.\u201c\u2026That \u2018for now\u2019 part is really worrying me,\u201d Shaneth said.Kang Yoon-Soo and his party were hiding in the bushes in front of a grape field on the outskirts of Vulpehin. The fragrance of grapes filled the air, tickling their noses.\u201cI cannot stand it anymore,\u201d Iris said.\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Henrick asked.Iris looked at the grape trees with twinkling eyes as she replied, \u201cI want to go and eat those right now.\u201d\u201cHold up. Don\u2019t you see those things under the trees?\u201d Henrick asked, pointing at the army of kobolds lined up underneath the trees. He then rubbed his chin and added, \u201cThey seem to be under the influence of mind control magic. There\u2019s no other way to explain how organized they are, since kobolds would never act in such an organized manner.\u201d\u201cThe vampire should be behind it, right?\u201d Shaneth replied, subconsciously rubbing her neck.Henrick suddenly said in an eerie voice, \u201cThey say vampires love the blood of beautiful women.\u201d\u201cI just touched my neck for no reason! Stop it!\u201d Shaneth exclaimed as her face flushed in embarrassment.However, Iris\u2019 face turned pale and she asked, \u201cDoes the vampire drink blood?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why they\u2019re called vampires,\u201d Henrick replied.[1]\u201cThen will it come for my blood too?\u201d Iris asked, sounding slightly nervous.\u201cTry to remember how much the mosquitoes loved your blood,\u201d Henrick said in an eerie voice.Iris\u2019 face turned pale white and she grabbed the hem of Kang Yoon-Soo\u2019s clothes. She looked at him with tears welling up in her eyes and asked, \u201cKang Yoon-Soo, what should I do so the vampire won\u2019t take my blood?\u201dKang Yoon-Soo replied, \u201cThe vampire over there is a female.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Henrick subconsciously rubbed his neck.It was Shaneth\u2019s turn to speak in an eerie voice this time as she said, \u201cI\u2019ve heard female vampires love to drink the blood of handsome men.\u201d\u201cI should be worried, right?\u201d Henrick asked.\u201cOh my\u2026\u201d Shaneth muttered as her face crumpled.\u201c\u2026It was just a joke, you punk. Why the hell would you make that face?\u201d Henrick replied.Kang Yoon-Soo looked at the grape field and said, \u201cThat female vampire is attracted to women.\u201d\u201c\u2026Are there any more plot twists we should be expecting? You\u2019re trolling us, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Henrick grumbled.\u201cIt\u2019s up to you to decide,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said as he rubbed the hilt of his weapon, the Sword of Revelation. He thought, \u2018It\u2019s a shame I couldn\u2019t use this against Kartheon.\u2019The Sword of Revelation would deal an immense amount of damage against those who were dead or had come back from the dead. It would have been the perfect weapon to use against Kartheon, who had died and come back to life; of course, Kang Yoon-Soo had been unable to use it since he had turned into a demon during that battle.\u2018It\u2019s different this time, though\u2019 Kang Yoon-Soo thought.The Sword of Revelation came from the Great Temple in the desert, and it was still filled to the brim with holy power. It was going to be a powerful weapon against the vampires.\u2018This is one way to close the level gap between me and the vampire.\u2019Kang Yoon-Soo was at Level 224. He had gained three levels while fighting against the corpse dolls in the Shy Doll Ruin, but the vampire in the grape field was at Level 367.\u2018Vampires are still considered high-level monsters even when their blood purity is low.\u2019Vampires determined their ranks based on the purity of their blood; one would be considered higher-ranked the purer and thicker their blood was. The vampire in the grape field could be considered high-ranked.\u2018That\u2019s why we can\u2019t afford to be complacent against them.\u2019Vampires had excellent magic powers, and there was a high chance that they would be one-sidedly defeated regardless of how well-prepared they were based on the level difference alone.\u2018We have to fully focus on this fight.\u2019It was the same even for him, someone who had lived for the thousandth time. This was the first time in his thousand lives that he was taking on such a risky fight. He was bound to die if he let his guard down even for a split second.\u2018We first have to draw out the vampire and focus all our attacks against it.\u2019Kang Yoon-Soo then called out, \u201cHenrick.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d Henrick asked.\u201cSummon Rick,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.Henrick\u2019s face crumpled and he asked, \u201cWhy the hell do you want her now?\u201d\u201cWe need her,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.Henrick grumbled as he took out his summoning box, then summoned the beautiful young girl.\u201cIt\u2019s boring inside the box,\u201d Rick said while letting out a yawn. She added, \u201cCan\u2019t I just walk with you guys?\u201d\u201cAre you asking me to hold onto mana threads all day?\u201d Henrick grumbled.\u201cCome on,\u201d Rick said, trying to appeal to him using her cuteness.However, her attempt worked on Iris instead; Iris walked up to and hugged her from behind while saying, \u201cRick is really adorable.\u201dHenrick, on the other hand, did not feel an ounce of affection for Rick. He asked, \u201cYou, weren\u2019t you a serial killer?\u201d\u201cI was, when I went mad,\u201d Rick replied with a shrug.\u201c\u2026You really are a ticking time bomb,\u201d Henrick grumbled.Rick\u2019s mental state went back and forth between normal and mad. She was a cute little girl right now, but nobody knew what sort of chaos she would bring once she went mad.\u201cHenrick, send Rick to the grape fields,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.\u201cAre you telling me to make this kid fight alone?\u201d Henrick asked in surprise.Kang Yoon-Soo shook his head and replied, \u201cThe vampire will be drawn out if you send her.\u201d\u201cAre you telling me she will come waltzing out on her own despite having those kobolds tightly guarding the perimeter?\u201d Henrick asked.\u201cYeah,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo replied nonchalantly.Henrick was skeptical, but he decided to do as Kang Yoon-Soo asked. He moved the hand that was connected to Rick through the mana threads. Rick slowly started to walk toward the grape fields; a kobold saw the young girl and suddenly barked.\u201cWoof! Woof!\u201d\u201cGrrr\u2026!\u201dThe kobolds drew their weapons as if they were ready to charge at the little girl at any minute, but a voice suddenly commanded them, \u201cStop.\u201dThe kobolds immediately froze in place, staring dazedly into the night sky. Then, a beautiful woman leisurely walked out from under the cover of darkness. She wore a revealing top, and a cape the same color as the night sky fluttered behind her.\u201cIt\u2019s the first time a young girl has come here,\u201d the woman said. Her skin was as pale as snow, her eyes were as red as blood, and a pair of fangs protruded from her lips.\u201cOh, a vampire,\u201d Rick said nonchalantly, completely unfazed.The tall vampire lady smiled and walked toward Rick, then said, \u201cYou don\u2019t seem to be surprised even after seeing me. What\u2019s your name?\u201d\u201cRick,\u201d Rick replied.\u201cRick? I think I\u2019ve heard that name before\u2026 a long time ago. I think I heard it from my parents\u2026\u201d the female vampire said. She rubbed Rick\u2019s soft lips and said, \u201cMy name is Rapelka. You really are adorable\u2026 and yet so beautiful, unlike others your age.\u201dRapelka\u2019s hands brushed down Rick\u2019s shoulders in a slow and seductive manner.Henrick\u2019s face crumpled as he looked at Kang Yoon-Soo and asked, \u201cHow long do we have to just stand here and watch that?\u201d\u201cI think we can report her to the investigators for pedophilia soon,\u201d Shaneth said with the same expression.\u201cWait,\u201d Kang Yoon-Soo said.Rick stood calmly in place as if it did not bother her at all. Rapelka started to sound more excited and her breathing turned rough as she said, \u201cYou\u2019re just like a doll. Ah, I\u2019ve never seen such a beautiful girl as you in my long life. Even a berry in the midst of a snowy field wouldn\u2019t look as luscious as you!\u201dShe started to move her hand, touching Rick\u2019s white neck inappropriately. She then whispered into Rick\u2019s ears, \u201cI love the blood of young girls like you. I wonder what you will taste like? I wonder how sweet and innocent your blood will be?\u201dShe then revealed her fangs and exclaimed, her voice filled with ecstasy, \u201cAh! I can\u2019t\u2026 I can\u2019t hold it in any longer!\u201dShe dug her fangs into Rick\u2019s neck.Kwachik!\u201cWhat in the?!\u201d Shaneth exclaimed in surprise, quickly covering her mouth with both of her hands.Iris was also surprised, her eyes wide. Henrick, on the other hand, seemed to be quite calm as he watched the scene.\u201cAhjussi, why aren\u2019t you surprised?\u201d Shaneth asked.\u201cDolls have no blood,\u201d Henrick said calmly.Then, a scream suddenly reverberated across the grape field. \u201cKyaaaaaaaaah!\u201dRapelka\u2019s fangs cracked, but Rick\u2019s neck, on the other hand, was completely fine. In fact, the vampire\u2019s fangs did not even manage to leave a mark on her neck.Shaneth was surprised once again, and asked, \u201cDidn\u2019t the corpse dolls bleed when we fought against them before?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s because it was made by unskilled, cheap hands. That kid\u2019s body was made by the best doll maker, you could say, and it won\u2019t even be scratched by most attacks,\u201d Henrick said with a shrug.Rick furrowed her brows while touching her neck and remarking, \u201cIs that it?\u201d[Rick has been bitten by a vampire.][Rick\u2019s affinity toward vampires will be lower from now on.]Mental State: -5Current Mental State: 45[*Rick\u2019s mental state will lower further if she notices that her owner has used her as bait.]Henrick was surprised, laughing in resignation as he exclaimed, \u201cWhat the hell is this\u2026? Mock parenting?\u201dKang Yoon-Soo pulled out the Sword of Revelation and pointed it toward the female vampire after walking out of the bush. He said, \u201cKill it.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
