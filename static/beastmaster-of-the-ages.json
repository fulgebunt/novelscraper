    "Chapter 1": "Chapter 1 - The Ten Eggs in the Lifebound SpaceNovel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayVolume 1: The Eggstraordinary DuoLegends speak of the times the Heavenly Dao withers away and the cycle of reincarnation hits its limit. When that time comes, the endless realms will birth ten Primordial Chaos Beasts, each of them possessing bodies vaster than the realms of gods. In their wake, heaven and earth will collapse, all life would end, spacetime will invert, and the stars themselves perish.These Primordial Chaos Beasts shall vanish as the old world passes. Only then will heaven and earth take shape once more. The natural order shall return, life will flourish, and a new world shall be born.\u2026\u2026Dark clouds were pressing down on Flameyellow Scions Institute as a storm raged on outside. Institute disciple Li Tianming braved the downpour on the back of his lifebound beast, a Four-Winged Goldroc, before landing in front of a house.The door creaked open to reveal a beautiful girl in a white dress. With one hand holding up her skirt, and an umbrella in another, she crossed the rain with a warm smile to shield Li Tianming from the rain.\u201cHappy anniversary, Qingqing!\u201d The two hurried inside, whereupon Li Tianming produced a jade hairpin which he placed into her hand.Mu Qingqing\u2019s eyes sparkled. \u201cWhat a pretty thing! Help me put it on.\u201dThe two positioned themselves before a mirror as Li Tianming inserted the hairpin into her hair, giving her face a pinch as he did so. He missed the annoyance that briefly flickered in her eyes.Despite the rumbling storm outside, the atmosphere within the house was sweet.\u201cTianming, I want to become a woman tonight.\u201d Mu Qingqing lowered her head as her face flushed charmingly.\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cI want to give you myself.\u201d She began to remove her dress, revealing her soft skin that left one intoxicated.However, Li Tianming only felt confusion. She had always had a haughty personality, and intimacy was a difficult thing even though they were dating. In fact, she had always said that cultivation was her priority, so they had never even gone public with their relationship. Why would she suddenly take the initiative tonight? Li Tianming retreated two steps.\u201cScared?\u201d she asked.\u201cQingqing, something\u2019s off with you today. This isn\u2019t you.\u201d They had gotten to know each other on the road to Ignispolis. Li Tianming had saved her life then, and they had gotten together afterwards.\u201cSo how should I be then? Together with you for better and worse, and live a life of mediocrity?\u201d Mu Qingqing\u2019s expression suddenly twisted into a cold sneer as she continued to remove her clothes.A thunderclap rang out as the house\u2019s roof was torn off. Lightning arced across the sky, and in that singular instant, a violet Three-Eyed Eagle descended. Sitting atop it was a young man, within whose eyes seemed to lurk pools of lightning. Astride a violet three-eyed eagle and with the storm as a backdrop, he seemed every bit a child of lightning!\u201cLi Tianming, how dare you drug and assault Qingqing!\u201d The young man\u2019s wrath-filled voice was like thunder, and in response, the Three-Eyed Eagle suddenly unleashed a bolt of lightning that slammed into Li Tianming! The lifebound beast\u2019s spiritsource ability left Li Tianming paralysed as electricity coursed through his body, and he fell onto the floor with a thud.\u201cLin Xiaoting?!\u201d Li Tianming was stunned. He recognised the man. After all, Lin Xiaoting was a famous existence in the institute. His talent was shocking, and not only was he one of the institute\u2019s Heaven\u2019s Division disciples, he was even born to Ignispolis\u2019 Lightning Manor. Among the most elite of all the children in the nation of Vermilion Bird\u2019s powerful families, he alone stood at the peak!Li Tianming and Mu Qingqing were all from Vermilion Bird\u2019s smaller cities, and had struggled long and hard to gain the right to cultivate in Flameyellow Scions Institute. Lin Xiaoting was supposed to be in a different world from them, someone they should never have interacted with.\u201cBig brother Ting, save me!\u201d A panicked voice called out, and by the time Li Tianming raised his head, Mu Qingqing, with her clothes disheveled, was already snuggled up to Lin Xiaoting, staring at Li Tianming hatefully as she cried.\u201cLi Tianming, upon my authority as a Heaven\u2019s Division disciple, I am well within my rights to lay down punishment for your conduct that is lower than a beast. Judgement has been passed. Your Four-winged Goldroc shall hereby be granted the death sentence!\u201d Lin Xiaoting declared solemnly.The lifebound beast dying was the same as crippling a beastmaster. Lin Xiaoting\u2019s intention was to sever Li Tianming\u2019s path of cultivation, and make him regress until he one day became a cripple, unable to ever stage a comeback!Dense electricity began to coil around the eagle, screeching cruelly a moment later as it launched itself at the Goldroc next to it. With razor-sharp talons pinning the bird down, the eagle began to rip off the feathers of the goldroc. Every feather that was plucked out was accompanied by a small fountain of blood, as well as wretched shrieks that all stabbed at Li Tianming\u2019s heart.\u201cMidas!\u201d It was his lifebound beast\u2019s name. And at long last, Li Tianming understood what these two ruthless people were after. \u201cThey intend to kill Midas and rob away the Saintbeast War-Soul!\u201dTen days ago, Li Tianming had obtained the precious Saintbeast War-Soul in a secret zone. It was the posthumous remains of a mythical Saintbeast, and was worth a city. Supposedly, it had the potential to create a powerhouse that towered above the masses! Midas had already merged the one Li Tianming had found into its feathers.\u201cOnly Mu Qingqing is close to me in Ignispolis. She must have figured out I had gained something precious. So\u2026 she tossed me aside after using information about the Saintbeast Warsoul to latch onto some great family\u2019s child?\u201dParalysed by the electricity writhing around him, he could only look on as Midas, covered in blood, had its feathers plucked away one by one. The desire and pain in its eyes as it cried at Li Tianming stabbed at his heart relentlessly. What could be more painful than one\u2019s brother being butchered alive, while one powerlessly looked on?\u201cLin Xiaoting, Mu Qingqing!\u201d Li Tianming\u2019s blood was boiling.\u201cTianming, submit to fate. Neither your strength nor station in life is a match for me or the War-Soul.\u201d Drenched by the rain, Mu Qingqing approached Li Tianming and looked down at him from above.\u201cSo, what? Now you think you\u2019re a sparrow who\u2019s flown up high and transformed into a phoenix?\u201d\u201cWhat else could I be? Big brother Ting has already promised to help promote me to become a Heaven\u2019s Sanctum disciple.\u201d She looked emotionlessly at him, \u201cLi Tianming, I\u2019ve come to realise since arriving at Ignispolis that we\u2019re just so insignificant. From now on, you\u2019ll be one of the masses, and I\u2019ll be up high and above. Just take it as a sacrifice you\u2019ve made in the name of love for me, alright?\u201d\u201cYou won\u2019t meet a good end.\u201d\u201cWell, unfortunately that\u2019s not going to have anything to do with you. Return from whence you came, Flamehaven. I shall leave you with your life as repayment for the debt of saving my life. From today, we no longer owe each other anything.\u201d She crouched down and tidied up his disheveled hair. \u201cI sincerely thank you for your gift.. I\u2019ve simply been bullied too much since young. From today onward, I\u2019ll like those who\u2019ve looked down on me to kneel while speaking to me.\u201dThe two of them then left, along with the War-Soul.\u201cThis world has something called karma. You may believe you\u2019re risen high up in the ranks of society. However, there shall come a day when you reap what you\u2019ve sown with interest.\u201d He spat bitterly, his maddened, bloodshot eyes fixated on their departing figures.That night, thunder rumbled and a storm poured. A lowly youth, clutching the corpse of his lifebound beast, no, his brother, left Ignispolis and vanished into the night.He knew-There would come a day when he came back and demanded payment for this debt of blood!\u201cThree years, just you wait, Ignispolis!\u201d\u2026\u2026Three years quickly passed.\u201cMidas!\u201d Once again, Li Tianming woke up with a start. He regularly dreamed of his brother who had once fought side by side with him, his eyes reddening each time it crossed his mind.He had spent these three years in Flamehaven living a hard life to remind him of his revenge, while Mu Qingqing had indeed remained high and lofty at Ignispolis, becoming a disciple of Flameyellow Scions Institute\u2019s core, Heaven\u2019s Sanctum.On the flip side, Li Tianming had become a laughingstock in the institute for his unsuccessful attempt to drug and violate a girl. Even after returning to Flamehaven, busybodies who didn\u2019t know better abounded, who would point and curse at his lack of conduct.To add insult to injury, even his Saintbeast War-Soul was said to be obtained by Lin Xiaoting through his own efforts.\u201cPublic opinion is under the control of the powerful families. No one will believe a word I say.\u201d Nothing could be more cruel than the ways of the world.It was already late night, but Li Tianming got off his bed and went to the window, staring in the direction of Ignispolis.Suddenly-Activity occurred within an arcane space in his body.\u201cIt\u2019s finally hatching after three years?\u201d Li Tianming\u2019s eyes widened. That space was called the lifebound space! It was something that existed within every person at the moment of their birth on the Flameyellow continent. After seven days passed, a lifebound beast would hatch within. Practically every person on the continent had their very own lifebound beast.However, Li Tianming\u2019s personal space had a massive secret no one knew about!Apart from Midas, who had come into existence together with him, there were actually another ten mysterious eggs within his lifebound space. And today, two of them were wobbling, with cracks even appearing on one of them. Li Tianming shifted the cracking one out of his space, placing it on his bed and quietly waited for it to hatch.The cracks began to spread on the egg, becoming denser and denser as a stifling pressure began to press down on Li Tianming. \u201cIt\u2019s out!\u201dThe egg split apart.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",

It was readily apparent that the thing crawling out of the eggshells was nothing but a little chick. A particularly yellow and tender one. Li Tianming could only think of one way to describe it: fluffy, and the perfect main dish for a hearty breakfast. In fact, the only thing protecting it right now was that it wasn\u2019t morning yet...\u201cHow does a chick like you even release the aura of a fearsome beast...\u201d Li Tianming could already feel a headache oncoming.\u201cHuh? Who\u2019s the chick here! Don\u2019t look down on me, you nugget! I\u2019m gonna beat your ass!\u201d The little chick stared fiercely at Li Tianming, as if it was trying to kill Li Tianming with its eyes.A newborn chick that threatened his master? That was a novelty alright.Lifebound beasts could communicate telepathically with their beastmaster, but not many could talk with the exception of parrot-types. Perhaps this chick was similar to those parrot-type beasts, which was why it could speak.Li Tianming inspected the chick\u2019s eyes closely, where he could see a pinprick of light, a star.\u201cWhen a lifebound beast is born, the number of stars determine their tier,\u201d Li Tianming murmured.Li Tianming could still remember that Midas had five stars when it first hatched, marking it as a rare five-star lifebound beast in Flamehaven. A lifebound beast\u2019s tier directly determined the potential of the beast, as well as the limits of the beastmaster\u2019s cultivation. A five-star lifebound beast was enough for Li Tianming to be Flamehaven\u2019s top genius in the past three hundred years. This chick had only a single star, suggesting that it was only a miserable one-star beast.\u201cWait!\u201d As Li Tianming stared into the star spark, he seemed to see the star collapse and scatter before him. Li Tianming couldn\u2019t tell if it was just an illusion or reality.Tens. Hundreds. Thousands. Tens of thousands as it continued to grow even further! At long last, Li Tianming saw that single star expanding into a massive starfield.Inside this starfield, countless stars burned. Despite seeming infinitely far apart, their radiance merged and blinded Li Tianming.\u201cWhat was that? That\u2019s billions of star sparks!\u201d He could feel his brain exploding, as his vision faded and he felt himself seemingly sucked into the distant star field.Within the endless void, there was nothing but an infinite number of stars burning like massive fireballs. The next thing he knew, Li Tianming heard an earth shattering cry from a bird. He examined the direction of the sound, where a ball of flame was bearing down from the other side of this starfield.Magnificent wings extended from the field of flames, its radiance overwhelming all the other stars around it. As it approached, Li Tianming was shocked to find that it was just as big as the starfield! Every stream of fire that flowed across its body was composed of billions of stars. It was an eternal phoenix!Everywhere it went, countless stars would be yanked from their orbits, gathered into a burning stream that was swallowed by the creature shortly afterwards. It was like the phoenix was just slurping some noodles, except that each strand was made up of billions of stars, subsumed into its body with an effortless slurp.It was an unfathomable sight for Li Tianming. He continued to follow that eternal phoenix as it devoured everything in its path, without any care as to whether it had swallowed any life-bearing suns.Until one day, a huge dark hand appeared.The creature was clearly scared of this hand. It screamed in panic and tried to flee from the hand. What kind of existence was it that would terrify even the eternal phoenix? As the phoenix tried to flee, it even resorted to consuming its own flames, becoming tinier and tinier. Each time the hand landed, thousands of sparks flew out, each birthing new stars.\u201cHenceforth and forevermore, I am the master of all primordial chaos and reincarnation.\u201d The voice of the hand rumbled through the starfield, reducing everything in the realm to an endless base state of terror.Li Tianming could sense the eternal phoenix's fear as it slowly spread to his body like a poison. At last, the phoenix could no longer maintain its flight and tumbled from the stars. Just as its life was about to come to an end, it suddenly seemed to spot Li Tianming.\u201cWhat on earth are you!\u201d Li Tianming barely noticed how hoarse his voice was, such was his fear.Time ground to a halt as the phoenix stared at him quietly. \u201cI am... the \u2018Aeternal Infernal Phoenix\u2019!\u201dAs his vision dissolved into a blur, Li Tianming could feel his face hurting as he finally found himself back in his own room. The little chick had made its way up his shoulder without him realising, and was now pecking at his face.\u201cYou, an \u201cAeternal Infernal Phoenix?\u201d Li Tianming grabbed it by the wings and dangled it in front of him, while still trying to calm down from all he had seen just now. The single star was still in its eyes, but it was no longer expanding into a starfield.\u201cYeah, pretty badass eh?\u201d The little chick snapped back as it struggled to escape Li Tianming\u2019s grasp.\u201cAnd what exactly is an Aeternal Infernal Phoenix?\u201d Li Tianming questioned.\u201cOne of the Primordial Chaos Beasts!\u201d\u201cAnd?\u201d\u201cI too wish I knew!\u201d\u201cThen, what do you even know?\u201d\u201cGive me a break, I just hatched and the first thing I see is that stupid face of yours. What do you reckon I know?\u201dGetting insulted by a little chick sure didn\u2019t feel good.Of course Li Tianming knew better than anyone else that this little chick was no ordinary lifebound beast. Likely, the same could be said about the other nine eggs.What he had just seen was just way too extraordinary. A beast that snacked on suns, the hand that contained the entire universe within its grasp, and the endless field of stars.And such a creature was his lifebound beast? Li Tianming could already sense his spirit burn with passion.\u201cWill you do symbiotic cultivation with me?\u201d he asked the little chick.\u201cOf course, training a little chickling like you is easy peasy.\u201d The little chick wasn\u2019t even trying to hide its cockiness.\u201cLet\u2019s be clear, you\u2019re the chick here!\u201d\u201cLucky you huh, dual cultivating with a chick for free.\u201d The little chick snorted vulgarly.\u201c...!\u201d One of those chicks was not the same as the others!As the little chick relocated itself onto his head, Li Tianming was thrilled by the prospect of cultivating with a Primordial Chaos Beast.Back in ancient days, the ancestors invented symbiotic cultivation. A channel for cultivation was formed between man and lifebound beast, giving rise to the beastmasters. Through symbiotic cultivation, man and beasts shared their blood veins and their wisdom, forming a dynamic duo of great power.The first stage of cultivation was the beast vein stage. Both beastmasters and lifebound beasts had nine beast veins each, and cultivation in the beast vein stage required them to pair and connect them together. Each connected set of beast veins would strengthen the blood connection between the two. After that, special methods could be used to convert the spiritual energy of heaven and earth into \u2018beast ki\u2019, which would be stored in the beast vein. Beastmasters and lifebound beasts shared their beast ki, thereby allowing power to be shared between the pair.Through symbiotic training, the latent power in the beast\u2019s blood veins would strengthen the master\u2019s body, while the latent power from the beastmaster\u2019s blood veins would enhance the beast\u2019s intelligence.\u201cEver since Midas died, I lost all my beast ki, and all my beast veins wasted away as well. Without a lifebound beast, my journey as a beastmaster was supposed to be over. Whatever this Aeternal Infernal Phoenix is, be it a Primordial Chaos Beast or what, at least it\u2019ll allow me to cultivate once again.\u201d Naturally, Li Tianming had never heard of the legends of the Primordial Chaos Beasts before.Right before he was sabotaged by Lin Xiaoting and Mu Qingqing, he had connected all nine pairs of beast veins with Midas, completing all nine levels of the Beast Vein stage, and had even made a breakthrough to the spiritsource stage.\u201cSince my lifebound beast has changed, I have to reconnect all the beast veins. That\u2019s basically starting over from scratch.\u201dThe first step of the beast vein stage was to figure out the location of the beast veins on both parties. As Li Tianming tried to figure out where the beast vein of the little chick was, he could feel the little chick doing the same for him. Once their first beast veins were successfully connected together, they would reach the first level of the Beast Vein stage.\u201cHow could such a tiny chick have such a thick beast vein?!\u201d Li Tianming exclaimed.Inside that tiny body of the chick, each of the beast veins was like a dragon unto itself, terrifying yet magnificent. It was hard to imagine what kind of fearsome beast these beast veins belonged to. Placed side by side, Li Tianming\u2019s beast veins seemed like little worms.\u201cWhat a rookie, look at these pathetic beast veins, clearly a lack of masculine strength. And look at mine! Thicker. Longer. More perfect than yours!\u201d The chick was clearly despising him.But why did that sound so weird?\u201cLet\u2019s see if you can still brag later. Don\u2019t forget your beast veins will eventually become mine too.\u201d Li Tianming returned the insult.A short while later, their beast veins started connecting with each other. While the chick\u2019s beast vein might be way thicker, it didn't make the connecting process anymore difficult since it was more of some kind of \u2018activation\u2019 instead of a true physical connection. As long as the two could sense each other, the two beast veins would eventually merge and form a complete circulation.Li Tianming was no beginner, but only when the first beast vein connected did he realise how much the blood of the Aeternal Infernal Phoenix could do for his body.\u201cNo way...\u201dOnce their beast veins were connected, it was akin to a dragon being connected to a centipede. Li Tianming could feel his very own beast veins turning into a dragon as well. As the dragon roared in his body, he could clearly feel the beast\u2019s blood travelling through his torso, transforming every inch of his body. For a moment, it even made him feel like an Aeternal Infernal Phoenix itself.His Four-Winged Goldroc had transformed his body before too, but nowhere near to this extent. This must be the power of a real Primordial Chaos Beast! Li Tianming knew this was a huge opportunity for him.It was clear that Li Tianming was a changed man as his eyes shone. Once his beast vein grew to the size of the chick\u2019s, the process of connection would be complete, as was their conquest of the first level of the Beast Vein stage!The next step was to make use of cultivation techniques to absorb the spiritual energy of heaven and earth into their beast veins as beast ki. The quality of the beast ki would be decided by factors such as the quality of the technique and the blood of the lifebound beast. Li Tianming used the best technique available in Flamehaven, the Darkgold Technique, to create Darkgold Beast Ki.Just as he was preparing the Darkgold Technique, the chick snapped, \u201cWhat the hell are you doing? What kind of garbage is this?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Li Tianming was clearly confused, because this \u2018garbage\u2019 was the best technique in Flamehaven!\u201cJust shut up and let me lead the cultivation. We\u2019ll do it my way, the \u2018Aeternal Infernal Codex\u2019 way!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Before Li Tianming could even react, something unimaginable happened...A lifebound beast leading the cultivation, and with its own cultivation technique? But the moment the Aeternal Infernal Codex started running, he was clear that the Darkgold Technique was indeed only describable as garbage.After not cultivating for three entire years, the thrill of being able to cultivate again got Li Tianming\u2019s spirit burning. Before he knew it, an entire night had passed, one in which Li Tianming and his little chick both made a breakthrough to the third level of the Beast Vein stage!It was true that Li Tianming had some foundations. Still, such speed was unheard of in the entire nation. Even his body became an Aeternal Infernal Body, somewhat similar to the little chick. Such a body possessed immense strength and speed, let alone crazy potential.\u201cThis beast ki from the third level of the Beast Vein stage\u2026 it feels even stronger than the beast ki I had at the fifth level with the Darkgold Technique!\u201dAs the Aeternal Infernal Beast Ki coursed through his three beast veins, Li Tianming imagined lava flowing through his body. The beast ki had turned him into a volcano that was ready to erupt any moment.\u201cThere\u2019s still nine other eggs in my lifebound space, and one of them is already showing signs of hatching, just that there\u2019s no cracks yet. What kind of Primordial Chaos Beast will it be next time?\u201dLi Tianming was filled with anticipation on what the next egg, as well as the rest, could possibly offer him. Could it be, by any chance, that he had obtained all ten Primordial Chaos Beasts as his lifebound beasts?\u201cI once thought that my dream was over, that I could never make a comeback. Even with my mother encouraging me every day, I couldn\u2019t see any hope. But! The heavens have yet to give up on me, Li Tianming! Lin Xiaoting, Mu Qingqing, just you wait, I will return! I will get back everything that you have taken away from me! And of course, your life as well...\u201dLi Tianming stared out of the window, mapping out everything he wanted to do in the future. \u201cMost importantly, I can\u2019t let my mother get hurt any further...\u201dHis mother, Wei Jing, had already been living a turbulent life, and his expulsion from the Flameyellow Scions Institute only made matters worse. Throughout these three years, all of her suffering and helplessness had been deeply engraved in his mind. Even after the symbiotic cultivation came to an end and the little chick had already fallen asleep, Li Tianming was still cultivating.It was his mother\u2019s birthday today.\u201cHow happy will she be if she sees me pick myself back up, and that I have a future again? The power to cultivate again also means I can collect more clear spirit grass, which should prolong her life further...\u201dAs the family member that brought him up for the past twenty years, all Li Tianming asked for was to see her joyous face.However, at this moment, a commotion broke out outside of their house. It seemed that someone had just broken into their home.\u201cWei Jing, Li Tianming, open up!\u201d\u201cWe have a big, big \u2018gift\u2019 for you!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 3": "Chapter 3 - If You Meet The Wrong Person, Your Life Shall Be RuinedPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLi Tianming\u2019s father, Li Yanfeng, was Flamehaven\u2019s governor, while his mother, Wei Jing, was the lady governor. Both mother and son had resided in the Rain Appreciating Pavilion for years. It was the best residence in the governor's manor, a sign of Wei Jing\u2019s position in the manor once upon a time.Through the grapevine, Li Tianming had heard that Wei Jing had had both talent and skill in her younger years, and had even been a country-toppling beauty. She had been very impressive then, and had married his father in the end.However, after Wei Jing gave birth to Li Tianming, she contracted some strange illness. It had accelerated the aging of her and her lifebound beast. Today, she was only forty, but her age was belied by a head full of white hair and looked like she was at death\u2019s door. Only her face\u2019s outline gave the barest of hints of the beauty she used to be.Like her son, her lifebound beast was also a Four-Winged Goldroc, which was currently sprawled on the ground. Nearly all of its feathers had dropped off, and its movements were sluggish. Movement sometimes wasn\u2019t even possible. It was rare for a master to get sick along with their beast. Supposedly, she had traveled far and wide , but she had never found a cure. At this rate, she would pass from old age within half a year.They mostly stayed in the Rain Appreciating Pavilion and never went out, rarely meeting anyone. That was why it was unexpected that someone would barge in on Wei Jing\u2019s birthday!Two women walked in. One was in a red dress, looking every bit a graceful and refined madam, if not for her long and narrow eyes, which hinted at her sinister nature. The other was a young girl dressed like a martial artist. Her body was well-built and overflowing with heroic spirit. Evidently, she was born into a family of warriors, her eyes filled with the loftiness that only came from having a high status.Or to put it more bluntly, it was arrogance!\u201cThird sister, Xuejiao?\u201d Wei Jing came out. That madam was Li Yanfeng\u2019s third wife, called Madam Huang. Men in Vermilion Bird were allowed up to three wives and four concubines. As a wife, Madam Huang had a high status in the manor, and her family was also of great importance in Flamehaven. The young girl by her side was her daughter, Li Xuejiao, Li Tianming\u2019s younger half-sister. Her talent wasn\u2019t bad, and she had experienced a meteoric rise in Flamehaven in the last three years.\u201cBig sister, are you well?\u201d Madam Huang immediately plastered on a smile upon seeing them as she brought her daughter in.\u201cHow well could she be with one foot in the grave?\u201d Li Xuejiao\u2019s eyes lit up with amusement as she couldn\u2019t resist mumbling.\u201cThat\u2019s impolite.\u201d Madam Huang gave a stern glare, but didn\u2019t scold her. Instead, she continued to smile, \u201cI heard today was big sister\u2019s birthday. Milord specially ordered a present. He\u2019s a little busy today as he has to receive some guests, so he told me to come in his stead.\u201dLi Xuejiao almost snickered out loud, but managed to hold it back.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Wei Jing was slightly confused.\u201cTake a look,\u201d Madam Huang handed over a document, holding back her sniggers as she did so.Wei Jing\u2019s hand was trembling slightly as she opened the document. At a glance, it was obviously written by Li Yanfeng from the vigorous calligraphy. Just a brief overview left Wei Jing\u2019s eyes red and unable to even stand properly. It was only with Li Tianming\u2019s support that she could sit.Li Tianming took a look as well. While the tone was polite and it kept beating around the bush, the main message was clear: this was a divorce letter!He spoke of how grateful he was for Wei Jing\u2019s company these years as well as her contributions to the family, before waxing eloquence for a while. Finally, he invited Wei Jing to leave the manor. It wasn\u2019t just a removal of her role as the main wife, but her identity as the governor mistress as well!In summary, she was being evicted.Then, it mentioned Li Tianming. The words were curt, telling her to bring him along as well, clearly removing his status as the son of the first wife. It had to be mentioned that Li Tianming had always been the future Flamehaven governor!This was a major event for Flamehaven, but here it was just a side note. However, this showed how merciless Li Yanfeng was.If this had happened three years ago, it would have caused big waves. Now however, it was an insignificant thing. After all, the only thing worth noting about Li Tianming these days was how he had chased after Mu Qingqing and failed, before resorting to drugs.Li Tianming had always known the world was filled with those who liked to kick others while they were down. He had also known Li Yanfeng was heartless. However, he had never drawn a conclusion that it would be his father who kicked him while he was down in the end.In the three years he had returned, Li Yanfeng hadn\u2019t visited often, but he would at least come on his mother\u2019s birthdays.Li Tianming and his father\u2019s relationship had been like water and fire since he was young, as the man had never shown much concern over his sickly mother. It had worsened since his return from Ignispolis, where they hadn\u2019t even exchanged three sentences. These three years, that man\u2019s gaze at him had gone from his usual disappointment, to naked contempt, and then finally indifference. When he came to visit during his mother\u2019s birthday last year, he had just taken a brief glance before hurriedly taking his leave.To be honest, it wouldn\u2019t be a stretch to assume if he was just checking if she had died yet!This pitiful woman was still waiting for Li Yanfeng to play his part in the relationship. Li Tianming couldn\u2019t even begin to calculate just how much Wei Jing had paid for the sake of this relationship. For her to be repaid with this ending would make anyone furious!If you meet the wrong person, your life shall be ruined.Madam Huang and Li Xuejiao could no longer hold it back when they saw Li Tianming and Wei Jing\u2019s expressions. Li Xuejiao clutched onto Madam Huang\u2019s arm, no longer able to hold back her laughter. \u201cSeriously, dad always looks so old-fashioned, but he sends out quite the exciting birthday presents!\u201d\u201cBig sister, don\u2019t begrudge milord. This is all absolutely, positively for the sake of you and Tianming! After all, you aren\u2019t doing all too well now, which people can easily use as grounds to criticize the old master. Even the brave knows when to retreat. Big sister understands that\u2019s a virtue, right?\u201d Madam Huang retracted her laughter to say seriously. \u201cMilord has also made some plans. He took the effort to prepare these spirit gems! These are valuables only beastmasters can use, each one worth many a gold piece! It\u2019s enough to set you up for life.\u201d She took out a bag and casually tossed it to Wei Jing the way one would give a beggar alms.\u201cI really am jealous of you! I couldn\u2019t get that many spirit gems even if I begged for it,\u201d Li Xuejiao said enviously. Petty people really were something else. These two and their jibes would aggravate anyone to their deaths.Li Tianming assumed his mother was suffering and wouldn\u2019t be able to endure it, but she unexpectedly became incredibly calm after the initial moments of despondency. It seemed that she had come to some sort of understanding.\u201cIn fact, this does have its positives. The two of us no longer owe each other anything,\u201d she muttered, shaking her head.\u201cBig sister, if it really is too hard, feel free to cry. In fact, I\u2019ll even lend you my shoulder!\u201d Madam Huang covered her mouth to hide her twitching mouth.Li Tianming was furious at this point.\u201c I think it\u2019s about time for you two to scram, no?\u201d\u201cBig brother Tianming, how could you say that! Know why it\u2019s us two here to notify you? Dad has already promised that Rain Appreciating Pavilion is ours from now on. One divorced and one crippled, shouldn\u2019t you two be the ones scramming?\u201d Lu Xuejiao crossed her arms, her eyes alight with mockery.\u201cXuejiao is correct. Big sister, I won\u2019t make things difficult on account of our years of sisterhood. I\u2019ll give you half an hour to pack up.\u201d Madam Huang quirked an eyebrow, giggling.Li Tianming himself was almost laughing at this point. All these people really were more merciless than the last one. If not for his fortuitous opportunity, this really would be their end. However, he refused to accept this!Why should his mother have to suffer such unfair treatment? Even if they must leave, they would do it grandly! Not like some homeless dogs kicked out!Just as he decided to confront Li Yanfeng, his mother, who had always understood him, grabbed his arm. The strength her delicate body exerted was a testament to her will. \u201cWe leave, Tianming. There\u2019s nothing much to be fond about here. When we\u2019re down, there\u2019s no need to pointlessly struggle. When you make your comeback, we shall return for our lost face.\u201dThese simple words rocked Li Tianming to his core. After all, he was aware that his mother had never been any simple person. If not for her strange illness, this Madam Huang wouldn\u2019t be there smiling so complacently!\u201cComeback? Lay off the jokes. Your son\u2019s lifebound beast life is dead, and from his shameless actions no less. If the laughingstock of Flamehaven could make a comeback, well, that\u2019ll be the day pigs climb trees.\u201d Li Xuejiao snorted.\u201cChallenge accepted. I suppose I have no choice but to send you up a tree today then.\u201d Li Tianming\u2019s eyes glinted with fury as they stared at her.\u201cA challenge, big brother Tianming? I don\u2019t hold back against cripples, you know.\u201d Li Xuejiao\u2019s smile left her face as it turned frosty.\u201cStill remember? That time you got kidnapped when you ran off to play, it was ME who trailed them for three days and three nights, leaving behind clues that led to your eventual rescue. If not for that, you\u2019ll already be a lonely corpse in some dark, lonely corner. And yet... \u201d Li Tianming\u2019s eyes narrowed. Some people really didn\u2019t know gratitude.She curled her lips. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t change what a joke this is, Tianming.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why I regret saving you. I\u2019m a kind, magnanimous, elder brother. We have three trees here. I\u2019ll let you choose which one you want to have fond memories of when you live here. The orange, locust, or parasol tree?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 4": "Chapter 4 - The Blazing Palm that Sent a Pig Up The Tree!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAs expected of Li Yanfeng\u2019s daughter, Li Xuejiao had shown tremendous improvement over the past three years, having reached fifth level Beast Vein at the mere age of fifteen. Her lifebound beast, a Flaming Hawk, was a fire-type avian lifebound beast.Li Xuejiao called out her Flaming Hawk from her lifebound space, the most ideal place for a lifebound beast\u2019s cultivation, before Li Tianming could complete his taunt.The blazing great bird hovered right above Li Xuejiao. Fiery sparks danced off its feathers, its gaze sharp and piercing as it surveyed the area. Its most prominent feature was undoubtedly its talons, the crimson flame burning at the razor-sharp tips reminiscent of a poison-coated dagger.\u201cBig brother Tianming, since you no longer possess a lifebound beast, why not I stand aside while Huo Ling gives you a light roasting?\u201d Li Xuejiao was clearly amused.\u201cWho told you that I don't have a lifebound beast?\u201d Li Tianming strode to his room, where the chick was still asleep.\u201cWho are you trying to fool? Everyone knows your Midas had all its feathers plucked out and died a miserable death.\u201dLi Tianming simply ignored her as he entered the room and brought out the chick, which was still in deep slumber. It stirred as he picked it up by the legs.\u201cHEY! I was having fun with my three thousand haremettes, how dare you disturb me!\u201d The Aeternal Infernal Phoenix clearly wasn\u2019t happy with being dangled by the legs.As for Li Xuejiao, she had already burst into laughter the moment she saw the chick. \u201cBig brother Tianming, is this some sort of joke? I bet you\u2019d make a great comedian. Did you get this chicken through the use of a blood pact?\u201dA blood pact was the process whereby a beastmaster that had previously lost his lifebound beast could find a possible replacement. It involved the use of a special sacrificial technique where the beastmaster would forcefully inject their own blood into a newborn wildbeast to convert it into their lifebound beast. These wildbeasts were usually found in the wilderness, did not belong to any master and were extremely aggressive, usually attacking anything in its sight.The chick was still struggling in Li Tianming\u2019s hands until it saw the Flaming Hawk.\u201cDamn, what a hot chick. Do you want to have my babies?\u201d The chick didn\u2019t hesitate to verbalize its vulgar intentions.\u201cNot only do you have a chicken as your lifebound beast, but it\u2019s also just as perverted as you?\u201d Li Xuejiao was scornful, \u201cHuo Ling, devour it.\u201dWhoosh! The Flaming Hawk turned into a crimson blur, swooping down on the little chick, who whooped in delight.\u201cThis must be love at first sight.\u201d Flapping its tiny wings, the little chick charged towards the hawk, despite the painfully obvious difference in size.\u201cDon\u2019t make a fool of yourself, your size simply can\u2019t compete.\u201d Li Tianming felt a slight headache at the chick\u2019s bold moves, but to be honest, he couldn\u2019t even muster up an ounce of worry. The chick was just too strong, after all.\u201cTry to survive this, Tianming!\u201d Li Xuejiao had also made her move. Based on her movements, it was likely that she was about to use Blazing Palm. Flames erupted from her hands, coating her palm with a visceral energy gathered from her Crimson Beast Ki.Renowned as a fearsome move, the Blazing Palm\u2019s crackling fire was capable of consuming its victims with ease. More importantly, the impact from the palm was known to shatter every single bone. With a merciless glint in her eyes, Li Xuejiao directed the palm straight towards Li Tianming\u2019s chest!POW!To her surprise, Li Tianming didn\u2019t budge an inch, taking the full might of her attack squarely on his chest! It was a direct hit, one that could very well injure or even shatter his internal organs. The loud, solid thump that followed was definitely enough to pronounce him dead on the spot!Having killed her brother, Li Xuejiao started to panic.\u201cXuejiao, are you on a diet?\u201dAn indifferent smile floated onto Li Tianming\u2019s face.Shocked, Li Xuejiao gawked at Li Tianming\u2019s perfectly unharmed chest. How was that possible?!Unfortunately for her, Li Tianming gained complete fire immunity! This was one of the many boons he gained from bonding with the Aeternal Infernal Phoenix. His Aeternal Infernal Beast Ki was already the hottest type of magma in existence. Fire could do nothing to him at all.\u201cBehold. THIS is the real Blazing Palm!\u201d Li Tianming took advantage of Li Xuejiao\u2019s panic and swiftly made his move, way quicker than what she had previously achieved. Before Li Xuejiao could react, a Blazing Palm had already made its way towards her face!POWWWW!!\u201cAHH!\u201dA loud and crisp clap echoed out into the surroundings, which was swiftly followed by a blood-curdling shriek.The terrifying power of the Aeternal Infernal Beast Ki meant that this was no normal slap. Her face blackened instantly, turned into charred ruins, as her body soared through the air and slammed into the tallest parasol tree in the garden. Broken teeth, coagulated blood and saliva splattered onto the ground moments later, a testament to the sheer force behind that casual slap.BAM!Gravity woke up a few seconds later, pulling her back down onto the ground with a cruel jerk. Her body nearly came apart from the fall, and a crippling pain shot up her spine.\u201cAren't you in fifth level Beast Vein? Surely you can do much better than this. Shall we move on to round two?\u201d\u201cNO! Please big brother Tianming I made a mistake, no please!\u201d Li Xuejiao screamed in terror, but that didn\u2019t dissuade Li Tianming from sending another punch to her face.POW!!!\u201cAHHH!\u201d She shrieked even louder, as more teeth flew out of her mouth.Once again, she was sent up the tree, except only this time, she got caught in its branches. There wasn\u2019t an inch of her skin that wasn't scratched and torn up by the branches, and tears began to stream down her ruined cheeks. The way she shrieked sounded really like a pig, Li Tianming mused.\"Hundred points for this pirouetting pig, I\u2019d say. And it landed on the tree perfectly too!\" Li Tianming remarked, clapping slowly as he marveled at his work.He grinned as he saw his mother\u2019s relieved smile. For Wei Jing, the letter of divorce meant nothing to her compared to seeing her son make a comeback.\u201cWell done, my son!\u201d She gave him a thumbs up, just as how she always used to.\u201cWell, I have good genes.\u201d Li Tianming returned the praise.At that very instant, she seemed to appear young once more, the smile on her face hinting at her former beauty.It was at this moment that Madam Huang let out a shriek. \u201cHelp! Li Tianming has committed murder!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 5": "Chapter 5 - Destination: Heaven\u2019s Sanctum!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayMadam Huang fell into shock at this sight. Furthermore, Li Xuejiao was still up the tree. Of Li Yanfeng\u2019s wives and concubines, Madam Huang was the only one who didn\u2019t have much in the way of cultivation, so she could only stay at the base of the tree and babble madly, collapsing to the ground in the process. \u201cLi Tianming! You\u2019re not the heir anymore! Since you touched my daughter, you will have an unpleasant death!\u201dHer mind, however, was a complete blank. Her understanding of the martial dao may be lacking, but everyone knew that Li Tianming was crippled! How did this happen?!\u201cShut it!\u201d Li Tianming kicked Madam Huang, who had crawled over, sending her flying with a good kick to her face. After rolling several times, her face planted itself into a stone, leaving it bloody and bruised.\u201cOne more sound, and I\u2019ll pluck out your tongue.\u201d Li Tianming barked. Madam Huang whimpered, before falling into a submissive silence.Fortunately, Rain Appreciating Pavillion didn\u2019t have people in the area, or she would definitely have attracted quite a bit of attention. The mother-daughter pair had been slapped senseless by Li Tianming, especially Li Xuejiao. She was still hanging from the tree, half her face completely ruined. A pig would probably win more beauty pageants than her from now on.The true eye-opener, however, came from the little yellow chick, who was busy tearing the Flaming Hawk a new one. Bloody holes continued to pop up as the chick darted around gracefully, pecking away with wanton abandon.\u201cHey beautiful, no need to struggle, no one\u2019s going to save you\u2026\u201d The little chick pressed the giant Flaming Hawk down on the ground, smiling wickedly.\u201cMhm, my favour is your privilege.\u201d The yellow little chick was on the verge of pouncing, sending Li Tianming into a state of utter bewilderment. Where in blazes did this little pipsqueak have the equipment to handle the Flaming Hawk?The little fellow paused, as it felt something unwelcome.\u201cAhhhhhh, AHHHHHHHHHH! IT\u2019S MALE! ABORT MISSION! Damn it, why did you dress up so sluttily?!\u201d The chick felt like its world was collapsing around it. Utterly humiliated beyond all belief, it began to violently whale on the hawk.\u201cI think that\u2019s enough, brother\u2026\u201d Li Tianming hurriedly pulled it away.\u201cYou crossdressing nugget, don\u2019t let me see you again!\u201d the little chick spat, kicking up some dirt onto the motionless bird as it turned away. Even Wei Jing was snorting in laughter. Somehow, today was both her saddest and her happiest day.\u201cLi Tianming! I didn\u2019t expect you to have recovered. I won\u2019t forget this, and I\u2019ll definitely pay you back a hundredfold!\u201d Li Xuejiao finally jumped off the tree, before applying some medicine on her face.\u201cI won\u2019t be leaving Flamehaven. Come find me anytime. But don\u2019t expect the other half of your face to survive the encounter.\u201dLi Xuejiao frowned. \u201cYou won\u2019t be leaving Flamehaven?\u201d\u201cProblem?\u201d To Li Tianming, he still had something important to accomplish here!\u201cDo you know why dad chose to depose you and divorce your mother?\u201d Li Xuejiao said malevolently.\u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d\u201cDad wants to marry a woman, and make her the first wife! Obviously, your mother is in the way!\u201d Li Xuejiao crowed. In Vermillion Bird, men who were not the king could take three wives and four concubines. Of the three wives, one would be the first while the other two would be of equal standing. Li Yanfeng had long hit the quota. He had to divorce someone if he wanted a new wife, especially in this case where he wanted a new first wife.\u201cCan he even handle it at his advanced age?\u201d Li Tianming snorted coldly.\u201cYou\u2019ll definitely be happy to hear who\u2019s marrying in.\u201d\u201cJust say it.\u201d\u201cThe woman is called Liu Qing. She\u2019s in her twenties, not much older than you. She\u2019s a famous beauty, but most importantly, she\u2019s of the Lightning Manor! Do you still think Flamehaven will have space for you after this?\u201d\u201cLightning Manor!\u201d Li Tianming was inflamed once again. Lin Xiaoting, who had killed Midas and robbed the Saintbeast Warsoul from him, was a direct descendant of the Lightning Manor. The Lightning Manor was the most powerful clan in Vermilion Bird. A hegemon of the nation, they had innumerable powerhouses, controlling almost half of the nation\u2019s interests!\u201cDad will be hosting a grand wedding in ten days\u2019 time. If you don\u2019t scurry away, you will die if people from the Lightning Manor spots you.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t ten days later when the Flameyellow Scions Institute selection is happening?\u201d Li Tianming frowned. That was the real reason he had to stay here. He had to return to the institute. It may have been where he had fallen from grace, but it was also the holy land for all young beastmasters.Those two people were still there till this day. If he wanted vengeance, he had to return there in an open and aboveboard manner with the identity of a institute disciple.Flamehaven would host a selection to enter the Flameyellow Scions Institute every four years, and Li Tianming had been the one who had succeeded four years ago. And this time, he wanted the slot again. That way, he could grandly leave Flamehaven along with his mother. After all, Li Yanfeng would be forced to send them off, and not kick them out like homeless dogs!\u201cThat\u2019s right. Dad intends to use the selection to liven up the wedding. After all, it\u2019ll be his son who earns the qualification if all goes well.\u201d She didn\u2019t sound quite happy at this. This son wasn\u2019t referring to Li Tianming, but Li Yanfeng\u2019s son through his second wife and Li Tianming\u2019s second brother, Li Zifeng. He was Li Tianming\u2019s junior by three years, and wasn't old enough to be involved in the previous selection.Li Zifeng had risen rapidly in the three years when Li Tianming was crippled, leaving the latter all but forgotten by Flamehaven\u2019s citizens. His current age and stage was roughly as Li Tianming\u2019s was when he obtained the institute slot.Li Tianming had brought shame to the city, but Li Zifeng had brought back hope. After all, as one of the more remote cities, Flamehaven\u2019s citizens hoped that their local geniuses could head to the institute and challenge those chosen from Vermillion Bird\u2019s core!\u201cI understand.\u201d It seemed that he would definitely have to make a trip for this wedding. Li Xuejiao was telling him all this to bait him into going there to make a fool of himself, thereby accomplishing her revenge.However\u2026 there were some things you had to do yourself!This included that woman from Lightning Manor and his heartless father. He had lost everything before, so he needed courage to walk on this path again and seize everything back!Actually, there was also something else important. Li Tianming had once asked Wei Jing when he was sixteen if there was any way to treat her strange illness, and she had responded with a place: the Heaven\u2019s Sanctum of Flameyellow Scions Institute. She had never elaborated on the reason why she could be treated there.However, Li Tianming had never concerned himself with the details. The only thing he needed to know was that he had to join the institute, and strive for its core, Heaven\u2019s Sanctum. Three years ago, his talent was close to sufficient for entry. It had even become a certainty after obtaining the Saintbeast War-Soul, where he was close to curing his mother and extending her life.But Lin Xiaoting and Mu Qingqing had crushed that spark of hope. Now, he was already twenty and Wei Jing didn\u2019t have many days left in her. This selection was his final chance. If he missed it, he could only watch her pass away helplessly.\u201cThen, let\u2019s start from the institute selection, and his wedding!\u201d After keeping a low profile for three years, who wouldn\u2019t want to return to their battlefield and show that, no, they hadn\u2019t lost just yet!\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Wei Jing didn\u2019t have anything she wanted to keep.Li Tianming used his arm to support her. \u201cAlright, mother.\u201d\u201cKeep the spirit gems,\u201d Wei Jing suddenly said, after taking two steps. Li Tianming felt some resistance to that mentally. He wasn\u2019t particularly fond of accepting this last boon from Li Yanfeng, because that was a sort of humiliation.\u201cMy child, a man must know flexibility. If there are benefits right in front of you, just take it! The only thing people will remember is that moment when you truly retrieve your dignity. Don\u2019t concern yourself with losing a few bits of pride here and there,\u201d Wei Jing said gently.\u201cYes, mother.\u201d Li Tianming picked up the gems.\u201cI\u2019m peckish!\u201d The little chick suddenly gave him a pitiful look, though it was admittedly rather cute.\u201cWhat do you even eat, worms?\u201d Today onward, he\u2019ll need to set aside time for a chick's feeding time.\u201cNo, these!\u201d The little chick pointed at the spirit jades, drooling.\u201cYeaaaahhh... no. Stick to your worms.\u201d Li Tianming snorted disdainfully.\u201cWe can make a breakthrough if we finish those,\u201d the little chick said coolly, placing its wings on its hips.\u201cEldest brother chicken, it was just a jest, a jest! Naturally, all this is my birthday present to you! Happy birthday!\u201d Li Tianming hurriedly handed it the goods. If the little chick really could breakthrough just by eating spirit jades, he just struck it big.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 6": "Chapter 6 - The Spirit Gem Gobbling ChickPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayFortunately for Li Tianming, he still owned other properties in Flamehaven, which meant that they still had a place to live in despite their eviction. While it was just a small dilapidated courtyard, Li Tianming knew that the situation was only temporary. Once he had obtained the Flameyellow Order, which would grant him entry into the Flameyellow Scions Institute, he would leave Flamehaven for good.\u2026\u2026Night fell.Piled high in front of Li Tianming and his little chick was a stack of spirit gems. When the little chick first mentioned that it could eat such gems, he didn\u2019t believe it.\u201cWhat are these?\u201d The little chick remarked as it curiously pointed at the patterns on the spirit gems.\u201cThese are heavenly patterns,\u201d Li Tianming replied. Each spirit gem had thin red veins running across its surface. These veins were known as heavenly patterns because they could never be removed.Spirit ores were ores nurtured with the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, their formation a result of infusing these miraculous energies over millennia. Only with heavenly patterns could they then be called \u2019spirit ores\u2019. They had a myriad of amazing uses such as crafting weapons.Spirit gems were considered a subset of spirit ore, as it too had been infused with spiritual energies which had great benefits to both beastmasters and lifebound beasts. Therefore, spirit gems were often used as a kind of currency among beastmasters, with the value of each spirit gem easily surpassing that of an ordinary jewel. There were many different kinds of spirit gems being circulated in the market. Among them, crimson gems infused with fire-type spiritual energy were the most common in Vermilion Bird. However, there were also golden gems, thunder gems and many others that were being exchanged in the market. These gems could be used to purchase all sorts of cultivation-related resources.Legend had it that these heavenly patterns were natural expressions of divine powers, and that hidden within these patterns were the secrets to unlocking the origins of these divine powers. Therefore, most higher level beastmasters would choose to study these patterns when attempting to make a breakthrough, hoping to grasp these divine powers. For these reasons, the heavenly patterns were also known as \u2018the patterns of Heaven\u2019s will\u2019.\u201cThere are nine different colors to the heavenly patterns, the nine being red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet, black, and white. Out of the nine, red patterns are lowest in quality, while the white ones are the highest,\u201d Li Tianming explained. \u201cSpirit ores with white patterns are definitely unprecedented treasures, and rumor has it that their heavenly patterns are some of the most complicated things ever seen.\u201dIn his lifetime, Li Tianming had only ever seen spirit ores with red, orange or yellow patterns. The ores that lay in front of him were red, widely regarded as the most ordinary sort. That said, they were still pretty helpful for his current level of cultivation. The spiritual energy released from these spirit gems would undoubtedly allow him to form beast ki at a much faster pace.\u201cHeavenly patterns? Who cares, they are merely snacks to me,\u201d the little chick mumbled as it jumped onto the table, ready to begin his feast. There were about three hundred crimson gems!\u201cAre you sure these are edible?\u201d While it was true that spirit gems aided cultivation, one had to first release the spiritual energy from the gems before refining and absorbing it. Eating them, however...\u201cWatch and learn!'' To Li Tianming\u2019s shock, the little chick started to gobble down the gems one after another, like they were grapes.\u201cNot bad, hmm. Chewy too.\u201d Having swallowed more than ten of the fire-type spiritual energy infused gems in a row, small flames began to manifest around the little chick, its face glowing like a drunkard. It even let rip a long satisfying burp.\u201cDamn, you\u2019re really going to eat those stones? Aren't you afraid of constipation?\u201d Li Tianming stared in awe.\u201cWhat a bumpkin. I can digest this within minutes.\u201d The excess of spiritual energy in the little chick made it let out a burp, sending visible waves of heat through the air. At the same time, the flames already around it grew rapidly.It had completed its evolution... into a burning chicken.Although it took Li Tianming some time to react, he soon remembered that the little chick was still a Primordial Chaos Beast. All things considered, eating some spirit gems raw shouldn't have come as a surprise.\u201cYou should try one too, they do taste pretty good. Real men like us should appreciate delicacies like these.\u201d Hiding its hunger under a show of generosity, the little chick picked up a gem with its beak, waddling over to Li Tianming to drop on his palm.Li Tianming sank into deep contemplation at that sight. The symbiotic cultivation had granted him the Aeternal Infernal Body. Logically speaking, if the little chick was able to swallow it whole to absorb the spiritual energy, then as the beastmaster, he should be capable of it as well.The burning sensation that followed as the crimson gem slid down his throat reminded him of strong alcohol. The pain he\u2019d associated with them, however, was a non-factor, and the gem slid into his stomach smoothly. The crimson gem began to dissolve and release an incredible amount of spiritual energy that began to burn his innards.WHOOSH! Li Tianming tried to exhale, sending a gout of flame into the air, along with lots of fire-type spiritual energy.\u201cDon\u2019t puke here, you\u2019re wasting it!\u201d The chick looked at him with disdain.Li Tianming lowered his head and took a good look at his torso that had since erupted into flames. Could this have been a dream? It clearly wasn\u2019t, so just what kind of monster did he turn into? But one thing was for certain. Just like the Aeternal Infernal Phoenix, he too was now capable of consuming spirit ores!\u201cDirect refinement of an identical crimson gem would only provide around a third of the spiritual energy as compared to eating it raw.\u201d The little chick explained. \u201cIn addition, the absorption process is way easier as well. You only need to gather the spiritual energy at your abdomen area and refine it using the Aeternal Infernal Codex. That will directly convert the energy into beast ki that\u2019s stored in your beast vein. As for me, if I get enough spirit gems, I can probably cultivate way faster. \u201dLi Tianming realized that this was the reason why the little chick could keep eating without ever being full. It was actually using the Aeternal Infernal Codex to convert the energy into beast ki. This way, both of them were storing a substantial amount of beast ki.For anyone who happened to walk past the dilapidated courtyard, this would be quite the bizarre sight. A man and a little chick, sitting together and casually chatting while snacking on gems. Oh, and they were also on fire.\u201cHey, how much do you know about the Primordial Chaos Beasts and your origin?\u201d Li Tianming even managed to find some alcohol to share with the little chick.\u201cI\u2019m not trying to hide anything, but I don\u2019t know more than you do. The moment I opened my eyes, I knew that I am the \u2018Aeternal Infernal Phoenix\u2019, one of the Primordial Chaos Beasts and nothing else.\u201d The little chick flopped over onto the stone table, clearly drunk.\u201cI remember seeing a huge black hand,\u201d Li Tianming tried his best to recall.\u201cYou had that dream too?!\u201d The little chick jumped up in shock, gazing at Li Tianming.\u201cYou too?\u201d\u201cNaturally. I\u2019ve been seeing that before I was even born. My guess is that I used to be a creature powerful enough to devour suns, till I was hunted and killed by that hand,\u201d said the little chick. \u201cFor some reason, right before I died, I got a second chance by becoming your lifebound beast, thereby surviving in an unexpected way.\u201d\u201cWell, do you know of any methods that can quickly recover your strength and also elevate me to your level as well?\u201d Li Tianming asked.\u201cI don\u2019t know. All that I know is that limitless potential is hidden in my blood, but I\u2019ll need a lot of opportunities to figure them out. \u201dThe little chick could hardly be considered strong. After all, it was just in the third level Beast Vein stage like himself. But if it could release its full potential, it would definitely shock the world.\u201cHmmm, symbiotic cultivation allows us to become stronger together. That\u2019s surely one of the opportunities,\u201d Li Tianming analyzed.\u201cTrue, but I require a lot more resources as well. For example, I can tell from a single look that by eating these spirit ores, I can get stronger. Their effects, however, are limited. There\u2019s definitely something better out there, I know it.\u201dWhen hunted by the hand, the little chick had chosen to change its way of living and this had locked out much of the potential hidden within its blood. The real question here was how do they overcome these and bring it back to its former glory?By then, the duo had finished all three hundred crimson gems!\u201cWe did it!\u201d\u201cFourth level Beast Vein!\u201dThe spiritual energy from the three hundred crimson orbs had helped the pair make a breakthrough to a new level.\u201cEven at the fourth level, the quality of this beast ki is no doubt akin to normal sixth level beast ki,\u201d Li Tianming exclaimed at the unreasonable strength of the Primordial Chaos Beast\u2019s bloodline.Of course, this was just the beginning. For the few days leading up to the selection, Li Tianming would focus on cultivation. Whether he could return to the institute for his revenge and to find a way to prolong his mother\u2019s life or not would all depend on that fateful day.And most importantly...He would prove to the people of Flamehaven.That he, Li Tianming, had risen from the ashes, reborn as a phoenix.\u2026\u2026Day nine.Having established the symbiotic cultivation system with the little chick, Li Tianming had made multiple breakthroughs. Therefore, Li Tianming spent the past few days focused on his foundations and also practiced some of the battle arts that he had learnt three years ago.Night had fallen. The little chick was in a deep slumber on his chest and Li Tianming himself was also beginning to doze off on his bed.Amidst his sleep, Li Tianming felt a sudden surge of pain through his left arm!Li Tianming broke out into cold sweat. \u201cIs someone trying to chop off my arm?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 7": "Chapter 7 - Mysterious Black Arm!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLi Tianming sat up hurriedly, sending the little chick, who was snoozing on top of him, tumbling to the ground. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?!\u201dHe couldn\u2019t see anyone trying to hack off his hand in the dim candlelight, but he could see something else terrifying\u2026 Starting from his fingers, his entire arm\u2019s skin was beginning to blacken!The encroaching darkness began to engulf his arm at a breakneck pace as he woke up, turning his left arm into a blackness that rivaled night itself. Horror gripped him as an eerie, prickling pain, one that reminded him of innumerable ants crawling on it, began to emanate from his left arm.\u201cWhat the hell!\u201d He was utterly disturbed to see the wriggling flesh reform into black scales! The scales were exquisite and orderly, each a perfect hexagon. A frightening aura began to pulse outwards from his left arm, and the feeling his arm no longer belonged to him assailed Li Tianming.There were no words that could adequately describe the horrible aura emanating outwards. But at the very least, it was one that belonged to a supreme being, one that all life could only prostrate and tremble in front of. The metamorphosis didn\u2019t just end there \u2014 his fingernails began to transform into red talons, turning his left hand into a monstrous claw.The fingernail-turned-talons were scarlet and sharp, giving off the impression that skin and flesh would flay at the slightest brush.\u201cAm I still dreaming?\u201d Li Tianming wasn\u2019t quite sure whether he should laugh or cry. His arm was no longer hurting, and more importantly, he could feel that his arm was now capable of harnessing far more strength than the rest of his body.However, the increase in strength was just the tip of the iceberg. His left arm had undergone some fundamental changes \u2014 an evolution into a higher organism could barely begin to describe it. That said, the left arm\u2019s unique aura and blood had already mixed with the rest of the body without anything untoward happening.Then, the nightmare fuel continued. A red line formed on his palm as Li Tianming opened his hand, revealing a glistening, bloody crimson eye that looked right back at him!The fright he\u2019d expected to feel, however, eluded him. Seeing an alarmed Li Tianming looking at \u2018him\u2019 had dulled whatever fear he\u2019d expected to feel. In fact, he was beginning to feel that the \u2018him\u2019 being looked at... was the eye itself. It was a strange feeling, alright!Li Tianming stared at the claw and the eye, while the eye stared back at an alarmed him. A moment passed, then another, and he suddenly understood what was going on. \u201cSo, this new eye is mine!\u201d.He was able to see through two different perspectives, which somehow worked together through some strange method. There didn\u2019t seem to be any downsides apart from making his head a little more chaotic.He pointed his palm behind his back and sure enough, he could see behind him. He stuck it into his pants, and he could see his leg.\u201cSo, Li Tianming, what are you doing?\u201d He suddenly heard.\u201cNothing much!\u201d\u201cNo need to hide. Sticking your hand into your pants and panting... Uh huh, so many possibilities. Young people really need to learn to do it in moderation.\u201d The little chick snorted.Li Tianming was startled. How could something the size of his palm contain so much lewdness?\u201cC\u2019mere, you.\u201d Li Tianming grabbed him. Naturally, he used his right hand.\u201cNoooo, stawhp, I\u2019m not your chick!\u201d the little chick shrieked.\u201c...\u201d\u201cTake a look, what is this?\u201d Li Tianming revealed his black, scaly arm. In the palm of the beast claw, a bloody-red eye was looking at the little chick with schadenfreude.\u201cAHHH! Ghost!\u201d The little chick jumped up a meter in fright, its feathers quivering madly as it teetered on the edge of consciousness.With a jolt, Li Tianming realised that this arm\u2026 was identical to the giant black hand he had seen in the dream when the little chick was born!He had been too shocked then to pay attention to if that hand had had an eye, but these black, hexagonal scales were definitely there.\u201cT-that hand!\u201d The little chick realised the black arm\u2019s aura was making it tremble on an instinctive level.\u201cI think so too.\u201d\u201cWhat happened?\u201d the little chick asked seriously.\u201cNot sure. It suddenly changed. My guess is that you didn\u2019t escape your foe, and he\u2019s come knocking?\u201d\u201cFudge!\u201d the little chick cursed, before staring blankly at the black arm. Truthfully, the two of them seemed to lack the qualifications to know the full truth. Who was the black arm? Why did the black arm chase it down? Why was it lifebound to Li Tianming? Why did Li Tianming\u2019s arm metamorphosize into that black arm? Guesswork alone wouldn\u2019t answer these questions.\u201cNo need to worry! If I were your foe, I\u2019ll definitely give you a satisfying end. Like, we\u2019ll first go on an excursion up a mountain, pick some mushrooms, and then prepare mushroom chicken stew together. How does that sound?\u201d Li Tianming grinned, unable to repress his mirth any longer.\u201cUh huh. Is that why you were sticking your hand down your pants?\u201d the little chick asked, disdain ruffling up its feathers.\u201cWell, it\u2019s still a better sight than a certain someone attacking a male Flaming Hawk\u2026\u201d\u201cShut it!\u201d The little chick shot up, and pecked at Li Tianming. Despite its diminutive figure, the power behind the peck wasn\u2019t anything to laugh at. Sparks flew as Li Tianming blocked with his left hand.\u201cI guess we\u2019re at a net positive? Probably? It seems the arm is nigh-invulnerable.\u201d Li Tianming examined the hexagonal scales under the candlelight. He could indeed feel a strength that surpassed himself when he clenched his fist.In the end, he used some white cloth to wrap up the left arm before changing to a new set of clothes. At the same time, he put on a glove. Now, his entire arm was effectively hidden. Otherwise, whoever saw it would definitely take him for a monster.The little chick accepted this development as well. As a lazy chick, it made sense to adopt a wait-and-see approach to incomprehensible occurrences.\u201cMaybe I have some connection to the giant black hand?\u201d Li Tianming pondered, thinking of that giant black hand that had assaulted the Aeternal Infernal Phoenix. \u201cIts origin may be uncertain, but it\u2019ll give me additional chances for tomorrow\u2019s selection!\u201dWith breakthroughs in his cultivation, as well as the black arm, Li Tianming began to devote the remaining time to practicing old battle arts and ensuring his combat readiness. He had quite a few battle arts, having once reached the spiritsource stage.Battle arts had two types. Martial arts, that were practiced by beastmasters, and beastial arts, which were practiced by lifebound beasts. They were synergistic in nature, and only when executed in tandem could they display their full might.As their cultivation increased, beastmasters and lifebound beasts would have access to more and more cooperative abilities, and battle arts were one of them.Wildbeasts were incapable of learning beastial arts.Battle arts were divided into five ranks of beast, source, unity, heavenly, saint, based on their power and complexity. \u2018Beast\u2019-ranked beastial arts were the most basic and were suitable for lifebound beasts in the Beast Vein stage.They were then further divided into basic, intermediate and advanced. Of course, extraordinary cases existed in the form of \u2018supreme\u2019 beast-ranked arts, which would allow one to dominate their peers in the Beast Vein stage.Following that were source-ranked battle arts which were suitable for spiritsource stage beastmasters. Supposedly, some Beast Vein beastmasters could grasp source-ranked arts.While Li Tianming may have fallen from spiritsource, he still had his familiarity with his old battle arts. It was only the little chick who had to master the beastial arts portion. Still, that fellow was ridiculously talented. Battle arts that Midas spent much effort to learn with Li Tianming, were easily picked up by the little chick. These past few days, they had both reached mastery of many battle arts.\u201cTomorrow is the day!\u201d Li Tianming clenched his fists, his eyes ablaze with passion in the dark night.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 8": "Chapter 8 - The Star of Zephyr Square!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAgainst the backdrop of the rising sun, the fateful day finally arrived. The entire city was excited for the governor\u2019s marriage, especially since the bride was going to be his first wife.Illuminated with festive colours, music could be heard throughout the city.\u201cThe Flameyellow Scions Institute selection will be held today at the governor's place. It\u2019ll occur immediately after the wedding ceremony. The governor wants to further liven up the occasion by letting the guests spectate the selection.\u201d\u201cHave you heard? The governor is going to officially anoint young master Li Zifeng as the heir of the city after he gets the Flameyellow Order.\u201d\u201cWhat a happy day for Flamehaven!\u201d\u2026At dawn, Li Tianming had already brought Wei Jing into the courtyard for her to enjoy the warmth of the morning sun. She knew that today was going to be a special day.\u201cMother, it\u2019s about time I left.\u201d After he obtained the Flameyellow Order, he would take her away from this place that broke her heart.\u201cBe on your way then.\u201d Wei Jing squinted under the bright sunlight, but it had also brought out a faint radiance from her white hair.\u201cAren't you going to impart some words of encouragement? Perhaps, some chicken soup for the soul?\u201d Li Tianming smiled.\u201cChicken soup? What chicken soup?!\u201d The little chick leapt off his head, its tense appearance bringing chuckles to both mother and son. Judging from the relaxed tone of the conversation, it seemed that Li Tianming definitely didn\u2019t appear nervous about the battle ahead.\u201cGo ahead, You should be back after I take a short nap,\u201d Wei Jing said gently.\u201cAlright.\u201d Li Tianming skillfully tidied her white hair, patting her shoulders lightly before leaving the courtyard. As the courtyard gate closed, a single tear droplet crossed Wei Jing\u2019s smiling face. It was a tear that didn\u2019t embody sorrow or worries, but instead hope for the future.No one could have ever imagined the amount of dignity that she had lost in Flamehaven. It was the place where her youth and dreams were buried. However, today, at this very place, she wished for her most beloved son to take everything back for them!...Today, the governor\u2019s manor stood out like a beauty who had dressed herself up. It was brimming with various activities that brought joy and laughter to the place. It was said that not only were the rich and famous of Flamehaven present, but also many distinguished guests from other cities, including even experts from the capital, Ignispolis.As one of the top experts of Vermilion Bird\u2019s southern borders, Li Yanfeng definitely had both reputation and ability, which was further enhanced with the observation that the man seemed to improve with every passing year. Ever since he got in touch with Lightning Manor, word on the grapevine was that Li Yanfeng\u2019s future was way beyond the limits of Flamehaven. For now, he was definitely one of the most famous people at the southern borders.Li Tianming had no interest in observing the wedding ceremony, choosing to enter the manor only when the ceremony was about to be concluded.The place chosen for today\u2019s event was known as Zephyr Tower. It was a magnificent building, with a huge parade square in front of it which was named Zephyr Square. Li Tianming had spent sixteen years of his life training in this Square.A crowd had gathered in front of Zephyr Tower and were waiting in anticipation. The governor had just finished his wedding, which meant that next up was the long-awaited selection!Li Xuejiao snickered as she saw Li Tianming walk in. She knew that Li Tianming would be back to make a fool of himself. This was exactly what she wanted to see. As payback for the slap he had given her, Li Xuejiao and her mother had not told anyone about Li Tianming\u2019s blood pact or his new lifebound beast.\u201cThat new first lady sure is bewitching and seductive, it\u2019s no wonder dad fell for her. She\u2019s going to cause a great deal of trouble for him.\u201d Li Xuejiao gazed in the direction of Zephyr Tower, having already seen the bride. That said, her beauty was nothing in comparison to Li Zifeng and the Flameyellow Order.\u201cApparently, dad has already contacted the teachers at Flameyellow Scions Institute with regards to second elder brother. He\u2019ll be taken care of the moment he enters the institute. I don\u2019t think you had this kind of treatment before, did you?\u201d Li Xuejiao smirked. Just as she finished her sentence, a group of individuals emerged from the top of Zephyr Tower, seating themselves at a position where they had a bird\u2019s eye view of the entire square.As the host for the day, Li Yanfeng naturally occupied the middle seat. The man stood perfectly straight, his hair slightly streaked by white. He lowered himself onto his seat, his hand sturdily grasping the armrest. Even when simply seated, however, he released an intimidating aura which silenced Zephyr Square.Despite his more than humble background, Li Yanfeng was a prodigy ever since he was young, having needed to start from scratch, clawing his way to his current position. As the governor of Flamehaven, legendary tales of his youth continued to be told and retold throughout the city.Beside him, a lady dressed in red gracefully settled in. While she lacked the kind of aura Li Yanfeng possessed, she was no doubt the centre of attention. Li Xuejiao\u2019s claim that the lady was stunning could not have been more accurate. The lady was dressed in a scarlet silk dress with a collar reaching all the way to her chest, a seductive figure that teenage girls could never compare to. Her cheeks were hibiscus-like, her brows like willow, her skin like snow and her cherry-like eyes seemed capable of arousing all of one\u2019s desires. Her black hair was tied up into a bun, while the pieces of jewelry pinned inside glistened under the sun. Her rosy lips, tilted at an angle, seemed to announce to the world that the governor\u2019s manor already belonged to her.She was Li Yanfeng\u2019s bride, the new first wife, Liu Qing of Lightning Manor.Even if there were elites among the guests that matched Li Yanfeng in status or if all of his other wives and concubines were gathered, it was undeniable that no one was as attention grabbing as the two. This was especially true for the belle, a seductive, irresistible figure for all the teenagers in the square.Even Li Tianming had to agree that her charm was enough to make most people lose their mind over her, but just the thought of her being from Lightning Manor was enough to elicit disgust.Their arrival suggested that the selection was about to soon begin.\u201cYanfeng, just one look tells me that Zifeng doesn\u2019t have much competition in Flamehaven.\u201d Liu Qing\u2019s voice was soft and sweet.\u201cIt\u2019s good enough for him to have developed this much in Flamehaven,\u201d replied Li Yanfeng.\u201cI heard that you had another son who also went to the Institute and even dared to offend the \u2018little monster\u2019 from Lightning Manor?\u201d Liu Qing questioned.\u201cDon\u2019t concern yourself with him, he\u2019s already crippled.\u201d Li Yanfeng didn\u2019t appear like he wanted to talk about this topic.\u201cOh, I see.\u201d Liu Qing smiled.Being the centre of attention, Li Yanfeng proceeded to wave his hand. Amidst a rain of applause, someone walked out and announced, \u201cThe Flameyellow Scions Institute selection has officially begun!\u201d\u201cMy turn!\u201dThe moment the selection started,the first to step foot onto the Zephyr Square was a striking teenager!\u201cLook, it\u2019s young master Zifeng!\u201dAs Flamehaven\u2019s most reputable young genius, everyone knew who Li Zifeng was. It was said that Li Zifeng possessed an arrogant personality and enjoyed being in the limelight, and this was immediately evident.With the gazes of everyone on him, Li Zifeng summoned his Purple-Eyed Bright Bird from his lifebound space. The Purple-Eyed Bright Bird, enveloped by violet flame, stood side by side with its master. The valor that exuded from the pair, and especially the murderous look from the Purple-Eyed Bright Bird was enough to make most of the audience flinch.\u201cWho dares to challenge me? You can take turns!\u201d Li Zifeng did a sweeping scan of the area, his enthusiasm and fighting spirit clearly visible.From Zephyr Tower, Li Yanfeng could hear many words of praise.\u201cGovernor Li, your son must be a real hero, to have the guts to be the first one in the ring.\u201d\u201cLook at that Purple-Eyed Bright Bird! He really did receive good genes from the governor.\u201dA brief smile flitted onto Li Yanfeng\u2019s face. \u201cZifeng has improved quite a lot recently and is way more competent than peers his age, so of course he can afford to be the first on the stage.\u201d\u201cAh yes, a lot stronger than the previous one too,\u201d an elder exclaimed.\u201cYou mean Li Tianming? It\u2019s a darn shame,\u201d another replied.Li Yanfeng didn\u2019t want to hear them discussing Li Tianming. After all, they had quite a few guests from Lightning Manor... but it seemed that there were always fools wherever you went.\u201cDon\u2019t talk about people that\u2019s no longer around.\u201d Li Yanfeng clearly wasn\u2019t happy about this.This was enough to silence the chatter. After all, these people have all heard of how Li Yanfeng divorced Wei Jing and abandoned Li Tianming, chasing them out from the manor. And with that, Flamehaven had ridden itself of that joke.As they spoke, someone had already stepped onto the stage and challenged Li Zifeng. It was a battle between the beastmasters and their lifebound beasts! The challenger was named Du Yong, his lifebound beast being an Azure Gale Wolf. As the wolf stood before the Purple-Eyed Bright Bird, everyone knew that the match was going to be awfully one-sided.As expected, Li Zifeng didn\u2019t even have to lift a finger, as his lifebound beast burned the opposing pair to a crisp before tossing them off the stage.\u201cWeaklings! Utterly useless! I want more!\u201d Li Zifeng didn\u2019t even try hiding his arrogance. Furthermore, his methods were violent. He intended to injure his opponents as much as was permissible. This was to discourage other participants from challenging him and thus allowing him to obtain the Flameyellow Order in the shortest time possible.Another challenger approached the stage, only to be defeated yet again by just the Purple-Eyed Bright Bird. This was the potential of his five-star lifebound beast! In general, people with five-star lifebound beasts would easily be considered a genius in Vermilion Bird.\u201cAny more challengers?\u201d Li Zifeng was on a hot streak, eliminating over ten opponents in a clean and swift manner. Even if the subsequent challengers were more threatening, they were still all no match for him.\u201cLi Zifeng must be at the seventh level of Beast Vein stage!\u201d\u201cGiven his strength, it seems like it. Four years ago, when Li Tianming received the Flameyellow Order, he was only at the sixth.\u201d\u201cNo wonder the governor likes Li Zifeng better.\u201d\u201cSeventh level of the Beast Vein stage is a guaranteed ticket to Flameyellow Scions Institute.\u201d\u201cLook! Can you see the governor smiling?Such words began to be spoken more and more as Li Zifeng defeated over thirty people in a row. By now, it was apparent that Li Zifeng was indeed a genius. Additionally, none of the challengers appeared to even pose the slightest threat to Li Zifeng. His outstanding performance definitely made Li Yanfeng feel proud.Another hour passed, with Li Zifeng defeating all his challengers. No one else dared to approach him.\u201cWhat unprecedented talent! Only youths with such an aptitude are worthy of becoming the heir of Flamehaven! \u201d\u201cWhile he does have a bit of a temper, it is undeniable that Li Zifeng inherited his father\u2019s gifts!\u201dFor a while, there was nothing but praise for Li Zifeng. It was apparent that he was the future of Flamehaven.\u201cFather, there are no more challengers, I have won.\u201d Li Zifeng was satisfied with this result and looked up at Zephyr Tower with anticipation. Once he saw Li Yanfeng\u2019s smile, he knew that it was settled.Li Yanfeng suddenly rose from his seat and with a quick leap, he had landed right in front of Li Zifeng. It was a casual jump, but the pressure from his presence alone was comparable to that of a terrifying beast and it brought even the Purple-Eyed Bright Bird\u2019s head to the ground. Could it be that he had the Flameyellow Order in his hand?\u201cThe selection is hereby over! Young master Zifeng shall be going to the Flameyellow Scions Institute!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 9": "Chapter 9 - Twisting A Knife Into His Wound?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cFather!\u201d Li Zifeng had never been this excited before.\u201cWell done,\u201d Li Yanfeng praised.\u201cIt\u2019s because you guided me well, father,\u201d Li Zifeng hurriedly replied.The time had arrived for Li Yanfeng to announce the results to the world. Li Yanfeng turned to face the citizens of Flamehaven, to announce solemnly, \u201cFrom this day on, Li Zifeng shall be the heir of Flamehaven!\u201d\u201cYou may have done well today, but keep in mind not to be full of yourself. You have a bright future ahead, and remember to be cautious with every step you take.\u201d Li Yanfeng\u2019s face glowed with pride, a rare sight.\u201cCongratulations governor! Congratulations young master! What a happy day for Flamehaven. Our governor has gotten married and the young master was made the heir. He\u2019ll also be going to the Flameyellow Scions Institute!\u201d The captain of the imperial guards, Zhao Ding, cheered madly, and the audience began to follow suit.While everyone had their eyes on Li Yanfeng, an unassuming young man dressed in white suddenly made his way onto Zephyr Square.\u201cLi Tianming? What is he doing there?\u201d Most of the audience recognized that figure, and were shocked by this person\u2019s arrival. After all, this was not a place for the shame of Flamehaven to show up at, especially during a time when he was just removed as the heir, with his own brother inheriting it!\u201cWhat on earth is he doing here? Is he a fool?\u201d\u201cWell what would you expect from someone like him?\u201d\u201cThe governor must be fuming. It's his wedding day today!\u201d\"Fortuantely, he didn\u2019t bring his sickly mother with him.\u201d\u201cSomeone just chase him out of here already.\u201dFrom the crowd\u2019s perspective, Li Tianming was just someone who had lost his mind over being removed as the heir. But they underestimated Li Tianming. He was never there for the throne, nor did he have any interest left in the entirety of Flamehaven.As Li Tianming lifted his head, Li Yanfeng had already turned towards him, squinting at him. A terrifying aura engulfed him a moment later. To him, Li Yanfeng felt like a giant capable of reaching the sun, judging him from up high.If this happened ten days ago, Li Tianming would probably be left trembling on the floor, barely able to move. But not now! He was the beastmaster of a Primordial Chaos Beast. No matter how strong his opponent was, the dignity running in his blood would not let him admit defeat there. Even if every step towards Li Yanfeng felt like it was using up all his energy, he still managed to make it in front of Li Yanfeng!\u201cLi Tianming? You must be crazy! Someone, chase him away, this is no place for beggars.\u201d Li Zifeng couldn\u2019t hide the disgust on his face. In fact, he would have forgotten all about this elder brother if not for his unexpected appearance.Quite a few guards gathered around them, ready to carry out the young master\u2019s order. However, Li Yanfeng waved his hand, signalling the guards to stand back.\u201cTianming, this is not the place for you to be at. You should focus on resting at home. As the elder brother, you can always support his decisions,\u201d said Li Yanfeng.\u201cZifeng has done well, and he certainly has the talent for cultivation, more talented than I used to be. But before he gets the Flameyellow Order, I would like to give him one last challenge,\u201d Li Tianming said, his mind far from the hysterical state the others imagined him to be in.The father and son\u2019s conversation was seemingly amicable, both choosing to hide their aggression and hatred. After all, it was an important day, and they were distinguished across the nation, so they didn't want to embarrass themselves.\u201cWhat are you playing at, Li Tianming? What challenge can a pile of trash like you even give me?\u201d Li Zifeng questioned.\u201cWhy are you being so rude on an auspicious day like this? Are you scared you can\u2019t pass my challenge?\u201d\u201cStop fooling around, go back and rest.\u201d Li Yanfeng\u2019s patience was running dry by the time these words left his mouth. His expression, though calm, was betrayed by the anger raging in his eyes.\u201cI\u2019m not joking. I\u2019ve yet to reach the age of twenty, which qualifies me to participate in this selection. The rules don\u2019t state that I am not allowed to contest for the Flameyellow Order again even if I got it four years ago!\u201d Li Tianming said simply, causing a commotion in the crowd.\u201cThat boy must have gone completely crazy after everything he\u2019s been through!\u201d Zhao Ding exclaimed.\u201cI supposed he probably didn\u2019t want to live anymore, and just wanted to use the last moments of his life to ruin the governor\u2019s reputation.\u201d\u201cWhat an ungrateful little brute. Did he forget who raised him? Whatever happened at the institute was because of his own lust. He can only blame himself.\u201dAs the crowd chattered, most of them felt that Li Tianming had achieved the goal of making Li Yanfeng feel uneasy. Everyone knew how much Li Yanfeng cared about his own reputation!The only person that had a different reaction was Li Zifeng, who burst out laughing. \u201cElder brother Tianming, you\u2019re already an ordinary person, and yet you still dare challenge me. Are you hoping that I\u2019ll give you a more honourable death?\u201d\u201cWell, do you accept my challenge then?\u201d Li Tianming asked.\u201cOf course. Remember to not make a fool of yourself on the Zephyr square after being defeated,\u201d Li Zifeng said, before turning to Li Yanfeng. \u201cFather, please don\u2019t worry. I will not kill him. I will chase him away after beating him. After all, it\u2019s me he\u2019s after, which means that it\u2019s only right for me to do the job.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t overdo it,\u201d Li Yanfeng replied, his expression placid. After all, how could someone with no more beast ki and a dead lifebound beast defeat a seventh level Beast Vein beastmaster?Having said that, he leaped back to Zephyr Tower without giving Li Tianming a second look, and explained to the guests there, \u201cIt\u2019s a pity that you have to see my disgrace of a son. You might have heard stories about him before, and I\u2019m really sad to say that he has shamed our family. \u201d\u201cIt\u2019s alright, Governor Li, every family has their issues. This kid doesn\u2019t appreciate everything that you have done for him, and even dares to cause problems for you. At this juncture, there\u2019s not much more you can do as a parent,\u201d said one of the big shots from Ignispolis.\u201cThankfully, Zifeng will make our family proud. Just let Zifeng handle this and teach Tianming a lesson,\u201d said Madam Mo, Li Yanfeng\u2019s second wife.\u201cLiu Qing?\u201d Li Yanfeng returned to his seat and found his bride staring at the Zephyr Square curiously.\u201cYanfeng, even after losing his lifebound beast, this elder son of yours is still calm and composed. He is not as disgraceful as expected.\u201d Liu Qing\u2019s eyes sparkled with interest.\u201cHe\u2019s just faking. I know him well enough.\u201d Li Yanfeng frowned.\u201cDon\u2019t be angry about this, just treat it as a show. Everyone knows what kind of acts this boy has committed before. No one will blame you for that,\u201d Liu Qing comforted him.\u201cYou really understand me best.\u201d Li Yanfeng had already turned his attention to the square. Sure enough, the brothers were already facing each other, both ready for a fight.\u201cLi Tianming, you\u2019re nowhere close to what you were four years ago. This is just letting me twist the knife in your wound!\u201d With a smirk, Li Zifeng picked up his pace and dashed towards Li Tianming!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 10": "Chapter 10 - Flamehaven SHALL Tremble!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWhat did Li Zifeng have to fear? He was already at seventh level Beast Vein, even stronger than Li Tianming had been four years ago! He instantly appeared behind Li Tianming, intending to knock him out by striking his foe\u2019s nape with a well-placed palm.They no longer belonged to the same world. Further words would just be a waste of breath.\u201cFather will definitely appreciate my decisiveness!\u201dThe crowd watched with bated breath as his attack landed.A solid thump rang out as Li Tianming suddenly raised his left arm to block the blow! Under normal circumstances, Li Tianming\u2019s left arm would have shattered. However, contrary to everyone\u2019s expectations, Li Zifeng stumbled back several steps, clutching a trembling right arm. The hand he\u2019d used to attack was bright red, and was beginning to turn slightly purple.\u201cYou wrapped your hand up in a layer of metal?\u201d Li Zifeng clenched his teeth as he hissed.\u201cIt was your hand that was too weak,\u201d Li Tianming replied.\u201cTrying to act all mysterious?\u201d Li Zifeng\u2019s anxiousness after failing to show off was beginning to show, but that didn\u2019t stop him from being curious. \u201cWhy can I still feel beast ki from you? Didn\u2019t you lose it all?\u201d\u201cI simply used a blood pact and found another lifebound beast. How else could I test you? You don\u2019t actually think I came here to die a glorious death, right?\u201d Li Tianming definitely had to claim he had used a blood pact. Blood pacts had low success rates of one in ten thousand. Many beastmasters who had lost their beasts would use it, only to end in abject failure.\u201cAmazing. Well, why not show off your new lifebound beast? You\u2019re so confident. Could it be\u2026 six-star? Or even seven, hmm?\u201d Li Zifeng guffawed.Li Tianming didn\u2019t waste words, choosing to summon his Aeternal Infernal Phoenix instead.The little chick leapt onto Li Tianming\u2019s head as it appeared, showering its surroundings with a fierce glare. The entire manor went deathly still for just a moment, before a torrent of laughter rained from all sides. In front of the Purple-Eyed Bright Bird, it could only be cute, no matter how fierce it acted!\u201cWhat an absolutely adorable chick!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a lifebound beast? Ahahaha!\u201dEvery person broke down laughing, regardless of how high their position was.\u201cLi Tianming really is filial. He must have come today to make the city lord\u2019s marriage more lively in the capacity of a comedian.\u201d\u201cWe misunderstood him. He\u2019s turned over a new leaf, and plans to make a living as a comedian from now on!\u201dLi Zifeng was stunned as he stared wide-eyed at the little chick attempting to act tough, before laughing to the point of pulling a muscle. Even his Bright Bird revealed a human-like smile.\u201cBrother Tianming. That chick isn\u2019t even enough to fill a single dish, and yet you used it as a lifebound beast?\u201d Li Zifeng roared with laughter.But Li Tianming and the little chick were both solemn. The little chick\u2019s eyes turned bloodshot. \u201cHow dare you look down on your grandpappy, you nugget!\u201dThe little chick transformed into a bright yellow blur that assaulted Li Zifeng.Its arrival was too abrupt. Li Zifeng was still in the midst of laughing when his instincts screamed with danger. A moment later, Li Zifeng was violently pounded into the ground as what felt like a giant house slammed into him. His stomach had been scorched black, and a bloody gash glimmered ominously at the centre.\u201cYuck! This flesh is sour!\u201d The next moment, a little chick was back on Li Tianming\u2019s head, now with an additional strip of flesh in its beak. Anyone with two brain cells could tell it was from Li Zifeng.Li Zifeng grimaced. \u201cYou\u2019re asking for it!\u201dThe little chick\u2019s sudden violence had cast a chilly silence upon the area, and the audience\u2019s smiles began to stiffen.Li Tianming shook his head. \u201cAh, my boy Zifeng. You\u2019re too undisciplined. Arrogant, brash and lacking compassion. If someone refuses to teach you well, it falls to me to do it.\u201d\u201cYou? With what, that one-star lifebound beast of yours?\u201d Li Zifeng and the Purple-Eyed Bright Bird exchanged a look, before rushing at the opposing pair.Li Tianming and the little chick communicated telepathically. \u201cSure, our Aeternal Infernal Beast Ki is stronger than his, but it's not enough to overcome the gap of three levels. He has more quantity than us. Unfortunately, his attribute just so happens to be fire!\u201dFire immunity was the reason Li Tianming dared to challenge Li Zifeng, even with a gap of three levels!\u201cThen cut the crap! Charge!\u201d The little chick\u2019s blood was already boiling. It was a fighting junkie, and its favorite hobby was taking on stronger existences than it. This Bright Bird was perfect.\u201cTrashy birdy, come on and accept grandpappy\u2019s love!\u201d It hooted.Some people chuckled out loud. They hadn\u2019t expected the little chick to talk like a parrot. Usually, lifebound beasts could only speak with their beastmaster.While the Bright Bird couldn\u2019t speak, it still understood the little chick, flying into a rage at the chick\u2019s provocation. Extending its wings, it charged forward before Li Zifeng could say anything, its beady eyes focused on the little chick.Li Tianming targeted Li Zifeng as the Purple-Eyed Bright Bird began to pursue the little chick.\u201cWatch this.\u201d Li Tianming suddenly exploded with speed. His legs were so fast that they seemed like a mirage and Li Zifeng, who was at the receiving end, began to feel something like demons shifting in and out of existence in his vicinity.This was the advanced beast-ranked battle art, Ghost Steps. It was more or less the best movement art among beast-ranked battle arts, and Li Tianming had spent half a year polishing it.A ghostly figure whizzed by.Li Tianming appeared in front of Li Zifeng as the latter\u2019s scalp began to tingle, punching outwards at his unnerved foe. Dragon-Mammoth Heavy Strike! It was a boxing art that was Li Tianming\u2019s signature move. Midas had been a metal-type lifebound beast, gifted in speed and power. This advanced beast-ranked art had been made just for him.Like its namesake, this fist was designed to explode with horrifying might and generate high frequency shock waves, capable of reducing a victim\u2019s internal organs to mush.The Li Tianming of today didn\u2019t have the strength of a dragon or mammoth, but he had the even more powerful Primordial Chaos Beasts' strength. Furthermore, it was his black left arm unleashing it now, which made it even fiercer than before!A mighty blow, backed up by incredible speed, lashed out at Li Zifeng! Li Zifeng narrowed his eyes. He could already sense the might behind the punch and calmly responded with his own advanced beast-ranked battle art, the Fierycloud Palm.The Fierycloud Palm wasn\u2019t bad. It created a fiery cloud around the palm that could be used to guard, confuse, or even to suppress the enemy. Concealed within the fiery cloud was power that could shake mountains and rivers.\u201cTime to return to your kennel, you laughingstock!\u201d Li Zifeng said coolly, filled with utmost confidence in his thick beast ki.Palm and fist collided a moment later.A thud rang out, a sound that was swiftly followed by a gruesome crack. Piercing shrieks filled the air as Li Zifeng flew through the sky, landing head first in a daze, blood dripping out of his nose the whole time.Even scarier, one of his arms was twisted at an unnatural angle, the fingers covered completely in blood.\u201cLi Tianming!\u201d Li Zifeng lifted his head, grimacing in pain. He knew he had completely been humiliated.The manor fell silent, stunned by this spectacle!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 11": "Chapter 11 - Forgive me, Brother!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAtop Zephyr Tower, those seated stood up in shock. Their eyes were glued to Zephyr Square, looks of disbelief written across their faces.\u201cHow could that be? Didn\u2019t Li Tianming lose all his beast ki?\u201d\u201cThree years, that\u2019s enough to end any beastmaster\u2019s career!\u201d\u201cBut Zifeng is seventh level Beast Vein!\u201d\u201cDid Li Tianming use some kind of dirty trick?!\u201d Madam Mo had a stern look on her face.Li Tianming, the joke of Flamehaven, the boy that everyone thought would be gone for good, had returned with power that matched Li Zifeng\u2019s? So his appearance today really wasn\u2019t a joke! Probably the only one whose jaw didn\u2019t drop was Madam Huang, who had already seen what Li Tianming was capable of beforehand.Even Li Xuejiao couldn\u2019t hide her surprise. After all, she wanted her second brother to teach Li Tianming a lesson on her behalf, but the tables had turned.\u201cOh? Interesting. He probably recovered a while ago and was hiding it the entire time.\u201d The corners of Liu Qing\u2019s lips curled upwards.\u201cHe must have found a new lifebound beast to prevent the loss of his beast ki. Too bad it is but a worthless one-star lifebound beast \u2014 he can never go beyond the beast vein stage.\u201d The chain of events threw Li Yanfeng off guard as well, but he immediately managed to find an explanation for it. If Li Tianming had made use of sacrificial techniques to find a new lifebound beast the moment he returned to Flamehaven, then it was true that he could somewhat stop the dissipation of his beast ki, thereby preserving a certain amount of strength.But the people of Flamehaven didn\u2019t understand the reason behind all these, as evidenced by how they gawked at the brothers. As a result, being the one with the lower hand, Li Zifeng was almost driven crazy.Malice twisted his face as Li Zifeng drew out a sword. It was a vicious steel sword, crafted with top quality spirit ores and infused with the blood of lifebound beasts. These kinds of weapons were known as beastial weapons, and were far more powerful than regular weapons, especially in the hands of beastmasters. On top of that, beastial weapons could also synergise with lifebound beasts.\u201cThis Blue Steel Sword has yet to drink your blood before.\u201d Li Zifeng pointed his sword at Li Tianming. He had underestimated his opponent, and he would not let that happen again.\u201cAnd my Crimson Blood Dagger was never meant to drink the blood of my own brothers, but I guess there are always exceptions to everything.\u201d Li Tianming drew a scarlet dagger from his sleeve. It was about fifteen centimeters long, with a blade the length of his finger. The entire body of the dagger was a bloody red, making it look like the fangs of a venomous snake.In terms of weapon quality, the Crimson Blood Dagger was just as good as the Blue Steel Sword. It had been Li Tianming\u2019s weapon for a long time, being able to kill in a single deadly blow. And yet, who could have imagined that the brothers would point at each other with real blades in hand, aiming for the other\u2019s life?\u201cWhy did you come here to shame yourself? With your one-star lifebound beast, you are just some garbage stuck in Beast Vein. Once I get the Flameyellow Order, I will be so powerful that you'll grovel at my feet three years from now!\u201dAs he spoke, Li Zifeng swung his Blue Steel Sword, his steps suddenly increasing in speed. This was the intermediate beast-ranked battle art, the Wind-Riding Steps, which greatly increased his agility. But even that paled in comparison to the sword arts he was using. As the sword danced in the air, it was clear that he was using the Blazing Tornado Sword from the Li Manor, an advanced beast-ranked battle art!With the Blazing Tornado Sword, Li Zifeng had created a gust of wind, the sword hidden within the gale as it swung towards Li Tianming. At the same time, the Purple-Eyed Bright Bird had also used the beastial art of Blazing Tornado Wings to sweep up a cyclone, its wings now like two giant knives that swept towards the chick!The battlefield was divided into two, but both sides were just as exciting!\u201cDIE FOR ME!\u201d Li Zifeng screamed.His sword struck from multiple directions, stirring up a wave of flame that surrounded Li Tianming. A vortex of flame engulfed Li Tianming, its interior brimming with countless strands of sword ki that threatened to tear Li Tianming apart!This move was a true reflection of Li Zifeng\u2019s strength, as no one under the seventh level of the beast vein stage could possibly block it! The heat emanating from the tornado of flames alone was enough to burn most people to a crisp.\u201cAre you dead yet? Li Tianming! You\u2019re just a stray dog that should have died long ago, so stop haunting me!\u201d Li Zifeng was already in a state of frenzy.Confidence surged within him as he watched his Blazing Tornado Sword swallow Li Tianming, which swiftly gave way to fear as he realised something.Where was Li Tianming?\u201cYou are right, I am here to haunt you.\u201d Li Zifeng felt a chill run down his spine as a voice spoke from right beside his ears. He froze as hot metal rested on his neck, daring him to move an inch.By now, the audience could see that Li Tianming had already appeared behind Li Zifeng, his Crimson Blood Dagger pressed right against Li Zifeng\u2019s throat. If he so willed it, Li Zifeng would have perished!In fact, Ghost Steps wasn\u2019t the only thing that got Li Tianming there. There was another trick up his sleeve that had decided his fate. It was a supreme beast-ranked battle art, the Bloody Soul Hunt!It was the strongest battle art that Li Tianming practiced, and was meant to be used with the Crimson Blood Dagger. As the pinnacle of beast-ranked battle arts, few had succeeded in mastering it. It wasn\u2019t an offensive battle art, but a cross between a movement art and assassination art. Fast! Precise! The essence was to strike like lightning at the perfect instant to bring death to its opponents. It might not appear much, but Li Tianming had to practice it thousands of times a day just to achieve the effect of a one shot kill.Psss! Without hesitation, Li Tianming sliced the dagger across Li Zifeng\u2019s arms, causing blood to spurt out.\u201cAHH!\u201d Beads of sweat popped out of Li Zifeng\u2019s forehead as he trembled uncontrollably.\u201cZifeng, you shall pay for all your insults and your mockery! Now take this!\u201d Li Tianming\u2019s voice was like a demon\u2019s and with each sentence, the Crimson Blood Dagger drew a new line on Li Zifeng\u2019s body, the latter shrieking in pain the entire time.\u201cAll the acts you have done, all the crimes you have committed, do you really think no one knew about them? They just didn\u2019t dare to touch you because you had Li Yanfeng as your backer!\u201d As a matter of fact, Li Tianming wanted to teach Li Zifeng a lesson a long time ago. During the three years of his absence, there was no one controlling Li Zifeng, who went on to do whatever he wanted in Flamehaven. Despite committing a mountain of malicious deeds, his talent and family had enabled him to elude retribution.\u201cIf your father is not going to teach you about basic manners, then I will do it!\u201d\u201cJust because you\u2019re the governor\u2019s son doesn\u2019t mean you can look down on others!\u201d\u201cThis elder brother will today teach you the meaning of everyone is born equal!\u201d\u201cToday, I\u2019ll teach you how to spell \u2018karma\u2019!\u201d\u201cThis slash, do you like it?!\u201dWith each sentence he said, Li Tianming landed a new slash on Li Zifeng, slashes that were intended to cause great pain without creating lethal wounds. In total, he lashed out six times on his limbs and butt cheeks.\u201cForgive me brother, I learnt my lesson, please release me! DAD, MUM, HELP ME!\u201d Li Zifeng howled miserably, his face paler than paper. His Blue Steel Sword had long fallen from his hands, completing a picture of a one-sided defeat. No one possibly expected this battle to be so one-sided!The image of the youth standing on the stage had already created a lasting image in everybody\u2019s mind, but that wasn\u2019t all. Even more terrifying the sight of a blood soaked huge bird dropping on the ground as Li Zifeng capitulated. It was none other than the Purple-Eyed Bright Bird! As the Purple-Eyed Bright Bird struggled feebly a little chick landed beside it, its mouth stuffed with feathers.\u201cYou stupid stinking bird, do you know how to take a shower? Even your feathers are so damn smelly!\u201d The little chick shuddered as it spat out the feathers in its mouth, gagging and dry-heaving the entire time.How could a cute little thing like this gravely injure the Purple-Eyed Bright Bird over ten times its size? Was it even possible for a one-star lifebound beast?An irritated Li Tianming, a blood stained Crimson Blood Dagger and a grumbling little chick. The governor\u2019s manor sank into an unprecedented, awed silence from their very presence.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He\u2019s just crying and crying. Is it that painful?\u201d\u201cTo be honest, young master Zifeng has always been a bully. Being beaten like this can kinda be considered poetic justice\u2026\u201dMany soft discussions started. Li Zifeng\u2019s reputation immediately came crashing down. There were some words that no one would dare to voice out loud, but kicking someone when they were down was something that came naturally to the audience. Within moments, Li Zifeng\u2019s conduct in the last three years was brought to light.Now, everyone was waiting for Li Yanfeng\u2019s response.And as Li Zifeng expected, his father got up after the six strikes.\u201cMilord, quickly save Zifeng, then execute this rebel!\u201d Madam Mo wailed. She wanted to step forward herself, but she didn\u2019t dare to. Everyone was watching Li Yanfeng. This was supposed to be his joyous occasion, and this had to be a huge slap in his face, especially when it came to the reputation-conscious Li Yanfeng.Furthermore, Zephyr Tower was filled with many dignitaries as well. They may not say anything to his face, but they would definitely ridicule him behind his back after this.Li Tianming could feel a gaze boring at him, and he released Li Zifeng, who crumpled over at his feet.\u201cDad, mom, save me!\u201d Li Zifeng crawled away like a dog, scrambling off the stage without even caring about his Purple-Eyed Bright Bird.\u201cMother, this was for you!\u201d This time, it was all to stick up for her, as well as himself. For his lost dignity \u2014 for the justice he deserved!Wei Jing\u2019s dignity had been cast aside with a divorce letter, while Li Tianming\u2019s had been lost for three years.Li Tianming was prepared to crush anything in his way, consequences be damned.Today, he would rampage as much as he wanted. He was already displaying the beginnings of greatness. This day would definitely be left in the annals of Flamehaven history!Li Tianming lifted his head, meeting his father\u2019s gaze by chance. The latter\u2019s eyes were grim, evident from his clenched, twitching fist, a last-ditch attempt to control his emotions. Li Tianming may have pissed him off, but he was still a man with a city under him \u2014 his dignity was at stake.\u201cAn excellent performance, Tianming. It pleases me to see your perseverance, despite the past three years,\u201d Li Yanfeng said blandly.\u201cWhy, thank you.\u201d The exchange seemed amicable on the surface, but was in truth fraught with tension.In truth, Li Tianming had told Li Yanfeng how he had been framed when he returned from Ignispolis. However, the silent reply he received made him realise that his father feared Lightning Manor too much to offend them. At that moment, Li Tianming had been incredibly disappointed.Even though he had the high and lofty position of commanding Flamehaven, he chose to give up Li Tianming in the face of the colossal Lightning Manor, while tossing aside his mother as an afterthought. That divorce letter of his had been his most vicious move yet, and Li Tianming had carved each and every word into his memory. Where was the mutual respect between husband and wife, and why was it instead a knife in the back?The two might be father and son in blood, but Li Tianming didn\u2019t want to be involved with this man anymore.\u201cSo, what were you aiming for by defeating Zifeng?\u201d Li Yanfeng didn\u2019t want to shed all pretense of cordiality here, so he adopted a gentle tone to maintain a pretence of equal treatment.But no one brought that story. Everyone knew that Li Yanfeng was about to marry someone from Lightning Manor, an organisation that Li Tianming had a blood feud with! Li Yanfeng\u2019s concerns with his reputation was the only thing stopping him from killing his son on the spot.\u201cThe Flameyellow Order, as well as for you to escort me out of Flamehaven just like four years ago. Just do it again. Henceforth, I shall never step a foot into Flamehaven again.\u201d Li Tianming\u2019s words were clear and resolute. The purpose of this was for his dignity, as he didn\u2019t want that divorce letter to force his mother and him to leave this city like homeless dogs!His words left everyone shocked.\u201cDidn\u2019t he withdraw from the Flameyellow Scions Institute himself as his cultivation regressed? And now he wants to go back?\u201d\u201cWhy does he want to go back? He\u2019s the butt of their jokes there. Lin Xiaoting and Mu Qingqing are geniuses of Heaven\u2019s Division, and are a gazillion times stronger than him! He\u2019s just asking to be embarrassed.\u201d\u201cBut it\u2019s obvious that he doesn\u2019t want to stay here or repair his relationship with the governor.\u201d\u201cYeah. Wanting the governor to send him off just seems to be a way to go with some dignity. It makes sense from his perspective.\u201dEveryone was waiting for Li Yanfeng\u2019s decision. However, the man himself merely frowned. \u201cYou just have a one-star lifebound beast. Your current strength comes from what you trained in the past with Midas. The beast vein stage is your limit in life. Even if you do get the Flameyellow Order, the Flameyellow Scions Institute is NOT going to accept you.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not your problem. The Order belongs to me, for I\u2019m first place. Whatever follows, I\u2019ll deal with it myself. Since my position has been stripped, sir governor, our relations end here. No matter how I embarrass myself, it won\u2019t drag you in,\u201d said Li Tianming. This display of backbone by a youth, especially when talking to Li Yanfeng, had garnered grudging respect from the audience.\u201cIt seems like he\u2019s going to get what he wants.\u201d\u201cEverything this fellow did today really was outrageous.\u201d\u201cActually, he does have quite the backbone!\u201dThe mockery had ceased. Even if he was no longer a Flamehaven citizen, the jeering from now on would lessen greatly.\u201cDad, the Order is mine, MINE! You can\u2019t let him have it!\u201d Li Zifeng struggled to his feet in a panic.\u201cMilord, since we\u2019re being ruthless anyway, why not go all the way and\u2026\u201d Madam Mo whispered into his ear.\u201cScram.\u201d Li Yanfeng gave her a look, which quickly frightened Madam Mo into a corner.It seemed that under the public eye, Li Yanfeng could only agree to the request.\u201cMy Flameyellow Order! And send us out of the city!\u201d Li Tianming stressed every word, each one landing like a hammer on the hearts of those watching!Li Tianming thought of his mother. She had to be still in the courtyard, unable to sleep as she stewed in her anxiousness. She might be pacing about to and fro. While she might have never said anything, she had once married into Flamehaven even more grandly than Liu Qing had. There was no way she would ever accept such a pathetic departure, especially at her twilight!\u201cSir governor!\u201d Li Tianming said one final time, his eyes burning as he stared at Li Yanfeng. He found it laughable when he saw the unspoken thought of \u2018unfilial son\u2019 written on his father\u2019s face. He saw the rage and humiliation playing across his features!\u201cWhat can you do no matter how angry you are?\u201d Li Tianming felt rather upbeat to see this reaction.Li Tianming had ruined this joyous occasion, leaving Li Yanfeng with no choice but to swallow his anger. He couldn\u2019t toss aside his dignity as a father and governor in front of so many dignitaries!\u201cRemember well, governor. You don\u2019t qualify to divorce her. Today, the only reason we\u2019re leaving is because you are NOT worthy of her!\u201d\u201cHow embarrassing.\u201d Such conversations began to flow. Only Li Yanfeng knew how it felt to be embarrassed so publicly!It was at this moment that a woman walked to his side and held onto Li Yanfeng\u2019s arm. Liu Qing. She smiled gently at Li Tianming, her lips parted slightly and her eyes seeming to speak volumes.\u201cTianming, it\u2019s not good for a young man to be so hot-tempered,\u201d Liu Qing said gently. Her beauty was not tarnished by a common baseness like so many others, and her words were a reflection of that.\u201cElaborate, madam.\u201d Li Tianming didn\u2019t have a favourable impression of this woman, as she was from Lightning Manor.She smiled. \u201cWhat I mean is that there is still one more Flamehaven genius in the running for this selection.\u201dHer words confused everyone, Li Tianming included. Who else was there? Liu Qing herself? But she was over twenty and in the Spiritsource stage. Who else could it be?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 13": "Chapter 13 - Manna At Red Twill Mountain!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIt wasn\u2019t just Li Tianming that didn\u2019t understand what Liu Qing was talking about. Most of the crowd, including even Madam Mo and Li Zifeng, had no idea that there were others participating in the selection. After all, there were only so many competitors in the vicinity of Flamehaven, all of them renowned.Li Yanfeng\u2019s gaze towards Li Tianming turned even colder, but as he turned back to face someone else, a gentle smile appeared, tenderness and praise written all over his face.\u201cQianyang, although you came from another place, you\u2019re also a citizen of Flamehaven given that I have married your sister.\u201d He looked at a boy about the age of fifteen sitting behind him, immediately putting him in the limelight. \u201cThe teenagers in Flamehaven are way too inexperienced, and have no idea what a real prodigy is capable of. You may be young, but remember as my brother-in-law, you have higher seniority than them all. Now go show them true talent. \u201d\u201cGo, Qianyang.\u201d Liu Qing urged the boy, while still holding onto Li Yanfeng\u2019s hand.That was enough information for everyone! This boy, Liu Qianyang, was Liu Qing\u2019s brother, meaning he was also from the Lightning Manor!\u201cThe first wife\u2019s brother is considered part of Flamehaven as well. So the governor wants him to contest for the Flameyellow Order as well? Did they just agree on this, or had they planned this all along...\u201d Most people were taken by surprise, considering that this didn\u2019t look like a spontaneous decision. Li Yanfeng apparently never intended to hand the Order over to Li Zifeng, which explained why the Order wasn\u2019t passed to him, despite announcing him as the heir.The two sons were fighting over the prize, but it was actually prepared for his bride\u2019s brother?No one dared to question or contest the governor, and the entire place was dead silent. Everyone stared at the boy from Lightning Manor as he rose up from his seat atop Zephyr Tower. As people gradually got a clearer look, it was blatantly obvious that the so-called \u2018geniuses\u2019 of Flamehaven were fireflies compared to this real prodigy!He looked younger than Li Zifeng, his skin a pale white and his looks resembling Liu Qing\u2019s. He had an elegant and intelligent look, and his eyes sparkled like gems in the dark. Perhaps most impressive was the grace that infused his every movement. Only a colossus like the Lightning Manor could nurture someone with such aptitude!In comparison, the noisy, ruthless Li Zifeng was nowhere close to Liu Qianyang. Liu Qianyang\u2019s appearance alone was enough to gain the praises of the crowd, just as he was surely capable of making people forget about the youths of Flamehaven.\u201cQianyang, if you want the Flameyellow Order, you have to earn it.\u201d Liu Qing advised as she adjusted his clothing.\u201cYes sister, and thank you brother-in-law.\u201d The boy was very polite, giving him a gentle and obedient image. But that in no way meant he was weak, as everyone knew what his appearance meant.Li Yanfeng was still one step ahead of Li Tianming. Li Tianming thought that by defeating Li Zifeng, he could obtain the Flameyellow Order, but he hadn\u2019t expected the existence of Liu Qianyang, especially as the true recipient of the Flameyellow Order!From the warmth Li Yanfeng was showing Liu Qianyang, everyone knew that he had made this decision long ago. After all, he never even showed his two sons this kind of care before.To be honest, Li Tianming felt like he underestimated how low Li Yanfeng\u2019s bottom line was.More importantly, the sight of Liu Qianyang\u2019s face, one that resembled a girl\u2019s, had dredged up a memory or two. Three years ago, Lin Xiaoting of Lightning Manor had many followers, some of them as young as eleven or twelve. Even if the boy in front of him had grown up, Li Tianming could roughly remember his appearance back then.That\u2019s right, Li Tianming had seen Liu Qianyang three years ago!Having obtained permission from Li Yanfeng, Liu Qianyang leapt off Zephyr Tower, his crystal clear eyes locked onto Li Tianming. \u201cLi Tianming, when big brother Xiaoting executed your lifebound beast, I was there to witness it.\u201dIndeed, it was him! In his desperation and rage that day, Li Tianming had burned every face from Lightning Manor into his memory to keep track of who his enemies were, and that included this kid right here. Of course, he was now a young boy.\u201cYou were just this tiny bit close to getting the Flameyellow Order. What a shame. It\u2019s troublesome to get the Order in the competitive environment of Ignispolis, so I chose the easy way of entering the institute through Flamehaven instead.\u201d As he landed onto the stage, Liu Qianyang stated his purpose here. As the brother-in-law of the governor of Flamehaven, this was by all means a legal move.From his words, Li Zifeng was fated to be a joke today too as his limit was the position as heir, while the Flameyellow Order was an unreachable dream. The real prodigy of Lightning Manor stood at heights that Li Zifeng would never match.\u201cYour attempt at a comeback today was not bad. Too bad it\u2019s nothing but a final attempt. Do you know why big brother Xiaoting didn\u2019t want to kill you? It was because he didn\u2019t want to destroy all your hopes. After all, it\u2019s far more entertaining to see you struggle, no?\u201d A cold smile crept up his cheeks. Liu Qianyang wasn\u2019t the good boy he appeared to be, with every word he spoke intended to crush Li Tianming\u2019s will.One of the main reasons why Li Tianming wanted to return to Flameyellow Scions Institute was to seek his vengeance on this bunch of geniuses, but who knew one would find his way all the way to Flamehaven.\u201cIt really does sound funny when you put it that way. I\u2019ll struggle mightily to change my fate, only for you to crush me again?\u201d Li Tianming narrowed up his eyes.\u201cYour self confidence is quite delicious. Let\u2019s not waste time \u2014 let me see how much you\u2019ve improved in these three years! \u201d As he spoke, Liu Qianyang summoned his lifebound beast. Flamehaven consisted mostly of avian beasts, but things were different today when a cheetah leapt out from behind Liu Qianyang! The cheetah was swift yet massive, its claws razor-sharp, and its distinct feature the bolts of lightning running through its body. It was a five-star lifebound beast, the Lightning Bolt Cheetah, a lightning-type terrestrial beast!The Lightning Bolt Cheetah was a creature slightly stronger than the Four-Winged Goldroc Li Tianming used to have. After all, five-stars was the bare minimum for someone to be considered a \u2018prodigy\u2019 in Lightning Manor.Liu Qianyang smiled, confident in his bloodline and his strength. A battle between a fourth and ninth level Beast Vein? Surely no sane individual would try that, since that would just be plain stupidity.Li Tianming just needed one glance to know that it would be a one-sided battle. The reason he could beat Li Zifeng was mostly because of his fire immunity. But against the lightning-type foe, the cheetah alone would make short work of the little chick.\u201cWell let\u2019s test you if you are not going to respond!\u201d A thunderstorm brewed with a single palm from Liu Qianyang, bolstered by beast ki from his ninth level beast veins. It was a ghastly move, and just the pressure from the attack was enough to suffocate Li Tianming! Overwhelmed by the attack, Li Tianming was forced off the stage. As the storm persisted, the gust caught up with Li Tianming, forcing him back another thirty steps!The difference was simply too huge! With a difference of five levels, Li Tianming could barely stand straight in the face of the storm!Despite his raging hatred, Li Tianming remained rational. Three years of hardship and tolerance had taught him what it took to be a hunter. A real hunter never tackles the beast head-on, but instead waits for the perfect moment to land the deadly strike!What happened today couldn\u2019t be altered, and he undoubtedly failed to achieve his goal. Nonetheless, Li Tianming had proven himself. By defeating Li Zifeng and shaming Li Yanfeng, Li Tianming showed that he wasn\u2019t some trash that they could toss away on a whim!As he landed, Li Tianming looked up towards Liu Qianyang sitting on his Lightning Bolt Cheetah, who said mildly, \u201cYour beast ki can only reach the sixth level of Beast Vein. With this one-star lifebound beast of yours, what difference is there from being crippled for life? If this is all you are capable of, then begone. You aren\u2019t worthy of being my opponent.\u201dLooking at how Li Tianming couldn\u2019t even put up a fight against Liu Qianyang, the crowd realised the difference between Flamehaven and Lightning Manor was beyond what they had ever imagined. This Liu Qianyang was younger than Li Zifeng and yet he was two entire levels higher!\u201cBefore I go, let me ask you a question.\u201d Everyone thought Li Tianming would be disheartened by now, but his composure turned a few heads. However, no one noticed the murderous look he was giving Liu Qianyang. He would return the humiliation of this palm back to him eventually.\u201cSure,\u201d Liu Qianyang said, as his Lightning Bolt Cheetah gradually grew impatient, growling restlessly.\u201cWhen will you be leaving Flamehaven?\u201d Li Tianming raised up his head. If Li Yanfeng couldn\u2019t scare him, why should Liu Qianyang?\u201cProbably in a month's time.\u201d Liu Qianyang thought briefly. His sister was married, and he had obtained the Flameyellow Order, so there was no reason for him to stay too long. A month felt more than sufficient.\u201cVery well. One month later, at this very place, I will punch that annoying mug of yours. If you lose, the Flameyellow Order is mine. Do you dare accept my challenge?\u201d Yet again, Li Tianming made everyone\u2019s jaw drop. He had admitted defeat, and there was no doubt his opponent was way more talented than he was. One month later Liu Qianyang would be even stronger, while he would still be just hanging off his one-star lifebound beast, so what even gave him the courage to issue that challenge? It wasn\u2019t like he could improve tremendously in just a month.\u201cWhat\u2019s in it for me?\u201d Liu Qianyang snorted.\u201cJust my life.\u201d said Li Tianming.\u201cThe bet\u2019s on. My brother-in-law raised you, taught you how to cultivate, even sent you to the institute. Yet you betrayed his trust, committed crimes, and refused to repent for your wrongdoings even after being punished by big brother Xiaoting! Today was supposed to be a happy occasion, and yet you chose to disturb the peace. An ungrateful little bastard like you should be removed. If my brother-in-law can\u2019t bear to kill his own flesh and blood, I\u2019ll help him clean house!\u201d Liu Qianyang announced to everyone present at the Zephyr Square, the righteousness in his speech drawing praise, especially from the nobles in Zephyr Tower.Li Tianming laughed. What a touching speech. To add on to the irony, Li Yanfeng had barely reacted to everything that Liu Qianyang said, making him almost doubt whether Li Yanfeng was really his father. Throughout the past three years, Li Tianming had asked his mother this question multiple times, and since his mother never lied to him, he had to believe it was true.It was ironic indeed. An outsider from Lightning Manor, claiming to help Li Yanfeng to get rid of his own son, and Li Yanfeng didn\u2019t even react. What\u2019s more, he was holding this exact outsider\u2019s sister by the waist, staring at Li Tianming indifferently from up high.However, since he had long given up hope on Li Yanfeng, he found it amusing rather than upsetting. So much for parenting.At least, he had secured one last chance to get the Order. It was the only way for him to return to the institute, and also for Li Yanfeng to send his mother and him out of the city with dignity! Everything that happened today, and the tricks Li Yanfeng pulled off, would only delay this.The only real loser today was Li Zifeng. who was not only defeated by Li Tianming, but also had his Flameyellow Order snatched away. As he gazed mutely at Liu Qianyang, he probably felt the same way as Li Tianming did when he was abandoned by their father. Karma sure worked in interesting ways.\u201cSo he\u2019s going to challenge Liu Qianyang again in a month to compete for the Flameyellow Order?\u201d\u201cDo you think that\u2019s possible? The governor said he was just relying on his past experience and he can never go beyond the beast vein stage.\u201d\u201cThen why did he act like he could compete with the prodigy of the Lightning Manor?\u201d\u201cHa! Of course he had to at least retaliate a bit before leaving, or else what is he gonna do, just crawl out like a dog?\u201dAs everyone laughed, they looked at Li Tianming sympathetically. In the end, he was just a clown, dreaming of his dramatic revenge stories. Little wonder Liu Qianyang didn\u2019t even bother with him.Only Li Tianming himself knew that his statements were not meant as a joke. He took a final look at Li Yanfeng. On top of Zephyr Tower, the man had the young beauty in his arms, both of them chatting casually. Liu Qianyang\u2019s appearance today had disrupted everything that Li Tianming had planned, getting Li Yanfeng out of a tight situation.But could this be the end?\u201cJust you wait and see!\u201dWould it even take a month?\u2026\u2026Night fell, as a sense of victory lingered in the bridal room. Li Yanfeng had a cup in his hand which Liu Qing refilled with alcohol constantly, the two of them clearly enjoying their time.Liu Qing\u2019s face was red from the alcohol, glowing faintly like a juicy peach. However, Li Yanfeng was properly dressed and seated, the beauty clearly not the first thing on his mind right now.\u201cYanfeng, regarding the competition for manna at Red Twill Mountain, my brother will be relying on you.\u201d Liu Qing refilled the glasses yet again, before finishing her own portion. Her snow-white skin was especially charming in the candlelight.\u201cDon\u2019t you worry, Red Twill Mountain is my territory. Any manna there has my name written on it.\u201d Li Yanfeng was very confident.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 14": "Chapter 14 - A Competition Between The Geniuses of Lightning Manor!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cYanfeng, I\u2019m still worried. The competition is just too intense, especially since manna is a rare resource that can increase the number of stars a lifebound beast has. We all know what that means,\u201d Liu Qing said.\u201cIndeed. A lifebound beast\u2019s stars determine a beast master\u2019s talent and his highest attainable cultivation realm. Five-star lifebound beasts, the best of Flamehaven, will only rank bottom in the Flameyellow Scions Institute.\u201d Li Yanfeng nodded, fiddling with his glass of alcohol. \u201cIf he can evolve his beast to a six-star lifebound beast, then he will have a higher chance of interacting with Heaven\u2019s Sanctum. Of course, that\u2019ll also give you more power in Lightning Manor. Since time immemorial, the birth of manna has always caused a mad rush. Even if the one found this time is just the most basic manna, it\u2019ll still be priceless.\u201d\u201cYanfeng, we were truly lucky that it spawned in Red Twill Mountain, the outskirts of your Flamehaven. Only you can help Qianyang secure this rare resource and let him evolve his Lightning Bolt Cheetah.\u201d Liu Qing threw Li Yanfeng a wink while refilling his glass.\u201cRed Twill Mountain is just too large, its landscape covered by forests and rifts. There\u2019s far too many wildbeasts hidden there, beasts with awakened innate abilities. It\u2019s a dangerous place, to put it mildly,\u201d Li Yanfeng explained. \u201cTo let their younger generations compete and grow in such conditions, it is no wonder Lightning Manor has its current heights.\u201d\u201cOf course. The competition will be intense, given that there are seven other qualified disciples contesting for the loot. Thankfully, Qianyang is probably stronger than most of them, and he\u2019ll have your help too. He stands quite the chance,\u201d Liu Qing replied.\u201cWhen will the other juniors arrive? And who\u2019s accompanying them, experts from Lightning Manor?\u201d\u201cSoon. I was permitted to come earlier because of our wedding. Those kids will be protected by experts, but they have certain restrictions in place once they enter Red Twill Mountain, as this is supposed to be a trial for the younger generation.\u201d\u201cSo the two of us will bring Qianyang into Red Twill Mountain three days later?\u201d\u201cYes, every team will be entering the mountain at the same time on that day.\u201dLi Yanfeng nodded his head. \u201cManna is split into four tiers, royal, profound, terrestrial and celestial! Even the most basic royal manna can evolve a lifebound beast to seven-stars! How it works, its very existence...they remain an enigma. People can only assume it is the providence of the divine, which is why we call it manna.\u201d\u201cTop tier manna is basically impossible to get hold of. The one we are looking at this time was just the most basic kind, one that can be barely considered royal manna, and yet the hunt for it is insane. Thankfully, the Lightning Manor has excellent intel and could reach here first.\u201d When Liu Qing mentioned Lightning Manor, her pride was glaringly evident.Li Yanfeng knew that she would always be a member of Lightning Manor and never Flamehaven, even after she married him. But that didn\u2019t matter, since he too, would become part of Lightning Manor.\u2026\u2026Li Tianming was surprised to see rain when he returned home, since the sky was clear earlier.\u201cMother.\u201d He was afraid that his mother would be drenched by the rain. To his relief, he found her deep in slumber in her own room.\u201cHow relaxed.\u201d Li Tianming didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or to cry. He was fighting for his dignity outside, while she was happily sleeping. He waited by her bedside. Night had already fallen when she finally awoke.She smiled sheepishly at the sight of Li Tianming, who was safe and sound by her bedside, and asked, \u201cWhere's the Flameyellow Order? Should we be on our way now?\u201dLi Tianming sighed at how confident his mother was. \u201dYeah, I taught Zifeng a good lesson alright, but something happened. As a result, I didn\u2019t get the Flameyellow Order.\u201d\u201cAnd that something is?\u201d Wei Jing asked, to which Li Tianming explained the whole incident with Liu Qianyang.\u201cOne more month? I don\u2019t want to wait for so long, Flamehaven is too hot, I want to live somewhere in the north,\u201d she grumbled, reminding Li Tianming of a child.\u201cThere\u2019s no guarantee I can beat him after one month though.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not my problem, I am giving you half a month at most.\u201d Her smile made it obvious that she was just joking with Li Tianming.\u201cAlright, alright, say what you want. When I lose to him and the little chick becomes the cheetah\u2019s snack, you will know how cruel reality really is.\u201d Li Tianming smiled back.\u201cBullshit! That pussy can dream on about eating me, cause I\u2019m gonna peck its face off!\u201d the little chick snapped.Li Tianming snorted. \u201cStop tooting your horn, who was the mouse on stage earlier on?\"\u201cHuh? You must be mistaken, because I can assure you it wasn\u2019t me. I was about to rip that cat\u2019s face off, but you just had to beg me to let it off. I generously decided to let it live for another month,\u201d the little chick said somberly.\u201cHmm, I believe the little chick, it is very capable.\u201d Wei Jing looked at the little chick tenderly.\u201cSee, my mum can appreciate me, unlike you,\u201d taunted the little chick, who leapt into Wei Jing\u2019s arms.\u201cScrew off, that\u2019s my mum, not yours. I\u2019m rather sure she doesn\u2019t lay eggs.\u201d Li Tianming was speechless with how familiar the little chick was making itself.\u201cYeah right. I was in your lifebound space and I was born when you were. If she\u2019s not my mother, are you telling me it\u2019s you? Mommy Tianming?\u201d the little chick retaliated.It was actually quite true when Li Tianming thought about it. Like most beast masters, Li Tianming treated his lifebound beast like a sibling and then some. They fought together and cultivated together, a relationship even siblings didn\u2019t have. He had treasured Midas more than his own life, and while he had only been together with this little chick for a dozen odd days, their bond could only grow firmer.\u201cHey, since she\u2019s your mother too, why not let her name you? It\u2019s too much trouble to call you little chick all the time.\u201d Li Tianming had a sudden idea.\u201cMy name is Aeternal Infernal Phoenix,\u201d the little chick proclaimed proudly.\u201cToo long, we need a nickname. Mother, you can have the honours.\u201d Li Tianming knew his mother had a good naming sense since she was very well educated. She was the one who named Li Tianming, which meant \u2018fate\u2019.\u201cMe?\u201d Wei Jing brought the little chick to eye level and thought briefly, before saying, \u201dFor three years, Tianming had fumbled around in the dark. You, and you alone, brought light back to his life. Though you may be small and weak right now, you gave us hope, like fireflies in the black night. Therefore, your name will be Ying Huo (firefly). What do you think?\u201d\u201cMe, Ying Huo?\u201d The little chick froze up, perhaps already feeling a special connection with the name.\u201cBut it\u2019s not cheeky enough, and doesn\u2019t match its image. That\u2019s false advertising.\u201d Li Tianming smiled.\u201cNO! I want this name!\u201d That triggered the little chick, who flew into a frenzy trying to peck Li Tianming to death.\u201cHaha...\u201dIt was hence decided that the Aeternal Infernal Phoenix would get a new name, Ying Huo.Li Tianming hardly considered the day a success. He had failed to make Li Yanfeng bow before him, and he thought it would be a sorry night. But with mother being so relaxed, and the little chick so cheerful, he still managed to lay down his burdens for the night and have a good laugh.This was what home truly feels like! A mother that\u2019s unconditionally confident in her son, forever showering her son with love and care. A brother that he could joke around with, but would also fight together till their last breath. He was expecting more siblings to join him as well, since there were still nine eggs, with one of them already showing signs of hatching. Li Tianming couldn\u2019t wait for this new member of the family.The only regrettable matter was that his mother looked even older under the candlelight. The knowledge that she could just leave him anytime frightened him even more than the prospect of his own death.\u201cWe\u2019re out of clear spirit grass, the only thing that can make mother\u2019s life easier.\u201d It was already the middle of the night, but Li Tianming was still deep in thought. \u201cI\u2019ll put aside Liu Qianyang and the Flameyellow Order for now. I\u2019ll make a trip to the Red Twill Mountain now and try to gather more clear spirit grass. Before my strength recovered, each trip to Red Twill Mountain was accompanied by life-threatening dangers, which was why mother didn\u2019t allow me to go. But I can convince her now that I\u2019m a lot stronger.\u201dThe clear spirit grass wasn\u2019t exactly a precious herb, but the main problem was its scarcity. Most people had no use for it, making it hard to come by in the market. The only source was Red Twill Mountain.For the next two days, Li Tianming helped to prepare everything his mother needed for a while. Although her lifebound beast was also sick, it could still help her in crucial moments.\u201cIt\u2019s alright if you can\u2019t find any, just remember to come back as soon as possible.\u201d Even when the time arrived for him to take his leave, Wei Jing was reluctant. She knew she didn\u2019t have much time left, and all she wanted was to have Li Tianming by her side.\u201cOf course.\u201d Li Tianming said, before embarking on his next journey.Next stop: Red Twill Mountain!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 15": "Chapter 15 - Goddess on EarthPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe terrain around Red Twill Mountain was rough, covered mostly by hills and forests. Occupied by deadly wildbeasts and venomous creatures, it was a place where only the fittest could survive. Countless corpses of both men and beast were hidden under the mushy soil and dead leaves, forgotten by the rest of the world. It only got more dangerous at night, with a vision-suppressing fog and the constant threat of being attacked by deadly creatures.Li Tianming had spent two days on the outskirts of the mountain, where there were many others trying to gather plants and herbs, so there was little reward. Now, with his cultivation having returned, he decided to venture further in.\u201cI wonder if they sell clear spirit grass in Ignispolis. If they don\u2019t, I better prepare more,\u201d Li Tianming muttered. Ignispolis was the capital of the Vermilion Bird. Not only were Flameyellow Scions Institute and Lightning Manor located in Ignispolis, it was also home to the \u2018Vermilion Bird clan\u2019, the rulers of the nation.Even after two days of non-stop searching, Li Tianming could only find a single clear spirit grass.\u201cPlease let there be more in the deeper parts of the mountain.\u201d The deeper parts were dangerous places that even skilled and experienced beast masters would not venture into. After all, wildbeasts were fundamentally different from lifebound beasts \u2014 the latter were intelligent creatures capable of communicating with each other, whereas wildbeasts were not capable of thinking and relied on hunting others to get stronger.\u201cThat is\u2026 a fire lingzhi!\u201d On their third day in the inner parts of the mountain, Li Tianming and Ying Huo found a rare lingzhi mushroom on a hard to reach cliff. The lingzhi even burned when a beam of sunlight shone onto it.\u201cLet me do it.\u201d The little chick flapped its wings, picking the mushroom off the cliff in the blink of an eye.\u201cTime to run.\u201d The duo left resolutely after picking the herb. After all, natural treasures like this were often guarded by wildbeasts. Spirit herbs were beneficial even to the wildbeasts, but they were cautious about it. Consuming the lingzhi directly would cause the spiritual energy to implode inside the wildbeast\u2019s body, killing it immediately. This was why treasures like these were left there, to be absorbed at their guardian\u2019s leisure.The world was filled with spiritual energy, and if ores could absorb these energy from the ground to form spirit ores, plants could too. After spending enough time in absorbing spiritual energy from their atmosphere, these plants would slowly develop heavenly patterns. Just like spirit ores, plants that developed heavenly patterns were known as \u2018spirit herbs\u2019, their quality determined by the color of their heavenly patterns. Similar to the spirit ores, there were nine different colors ranging from red to white, with red ones being the most common and white heavenly patterns being the rarest.\u201cClear spirit grass only has red heavenly patterns, and can be considered as the lowest tier of spirit herbs. That said, it still has significant medical uses.\u201d Li Tianming exclaimed while studying the fire lingzhi. It had a slightly charred orange heavenly pattern,, which suggested that the fire lingzhi was a tier two spirit herb.\u201cExcellent, here\u2019s your share.\u201d Just as Li Tianming was thinking how much he could sell the fire lingzhi for, the little chick tore it into half, and the spiritual energy inside the herb began to dissipate.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\u201cNincompoop. If I can eat spirit ores, then what is stopping me from eating this?\u201d Ying Huo glared at him while tossing half the plant into his face. Before he knew it, the little chick had already pecked down a good portion of its share of the fire lingzhi.\u201cWow, I\u2019m burning!\u201d For all its boasting, Ying Huo\u2019s skin was now burning, and the little fireball began to hop around madly.\u201cYesss, that hits the spot!\u201d The Aeternal Infernal Phoenix was indeed an amazing creature, capable of tolerating such a strong burst of energy. It even started to use the Aeternal Infernal Codex to refine the energy from the herb. In comparison, other beasts would never consume it like this, and would probably take a dozen days to slowly refine and absorb it.\u201cLi Tianming, I dare you to eat it, though I doubt if you have the balls. Heh,\u201d Ying Huo taunted.\u201cHa,\u201d Li Tianming laughed. It wasn\u2019t the first time he had a burning stomach.With a few quick bites, he swallowed the fire lingzhi. The herb turned into a numbing, scorching stream of lava as it slid down his throat, and as it entered his stomach, it didn\u2019t feel that much different from swallowing magma.It took the fire lingzhi years to absorb enough essences to form the orange heavenly patterns. Other than these two monsters, no one else could even imagine eating it raw, which was only possible due to the Aeternal Infernal Body\u2019s extraordinary fire immunity. Before long, Li Tianming started burning like a fireball too.Of course, this was a great opportunity for him to cultivate. Using the tremendous amount of energy the two had just absorbed, Li Tianming and Ying Huo channeled their beast veins to convert this energy into Aeternal Infernal Beast Ki, as they sought to enter fifth level Beast Vein.As they slowly converted this blazing energy to their own, their pain also eased and it got easier and easier. After a while, they had completely absorbed the fire lingzhi.As expected, the two of them made a breakthrough to the fifth level of the beast vein stage!\u201cAhh, cultivating with you makes me feel like we are spending the night together. That\u2019s disgusting, I want to find a pretty girl and \u2018cultivate\u2019 with her instead.\u201d The little chick pretended to sigh, even though the breakthrough just gave him a ton of energy.\u201cYou\u2019re in the wilderness right now, the chances of you finding a female ghost is way higher,\u201d Li Tianming joked.He had already reached fifth level Beast Vein, his power almost comparable to three years ago. Such incredible improvement speed was only made possible with the blood of the Primordial Chaos Beast.With his current strength, he could probably easily beat Li Zifeng without even using his fire immunity.\u201cBut this is still not good enough for Liu Qianyang, who is at ninth level Beast Vein...\u201d Li Tianming frowned at the thought of that teenager.After absorbing the fire lingzhi, they ventured further into the mountain. Li Tianming removed the glove from his left hand to make use of the third eye on it. He realised the vision from this single eye was even clearer than the ones his actual eyes could offer.The little chick shuddered. \u201cDon\u2019t use it to look at me, it makes me uneasy.\u201d\u201cWhat a coward.\u201d Li Tianming would never let a chance for him to laugh at Ying Huo slip past him. Just as the little chick was about to rebut, they heard a loud rumbling sound, like that of a falling tree, in the distance. At the same time, the ground began to tremble, and faint beastial roars echoed from the source of the rumbling sound.\u201cWildbeast!\u201d Li Tianming recognised it at once \u2014 a wildbeast\u2019s roar was infused with an uniquely-distinct primal quality, as a creature that lacked intelligence and followed its base desires.Just as they were about to run away from the wildbeast, Li Tianming suddenly froze on the spot, his eyes staring at the beast\u2019s direction.\u201cA female ghost?!\u201d The little chick, who was standing on top of his head, was also shocked by what it just saw, its eyes wide open. They were right about the wildbeast, but it was busy chasing someone, the \u2018female ghost\u2019 Ying Huo was referring to.\u201cGhost? That\u2019s totally a goddess!\u201dLi Tianming had seen plenty of beauties back at the Flameyellow Scions Institute, one of them being Mu Qingqing. Ignispolis had gathered many of Vermilion Bird Nation\u2019s most beautiful women, some of them talented, and others with reputable background. Even back in Flamehaven, there were a good number of charming ladies like Liu Qing, whose smile could make many men lose their mind.And yet, despite his prior experiences, time seemed to stop as Li Tianming looked at the figure running towards him. The girl appeared to be shrouded in a glistering white mist, her silky black hair flowing like black ink. Her face had a smooth oval shape, the facial features perfectly balanced on it like a piece of art. This was especially true for her eyes, bright and mesmerizing like the stars under a dreamy night sky.She wore a turquoise long skirt that pleasantly brought out the charm of her thin waist. Her fair skin was as fine as the most exquisite of jade, so soft it looked like it would break from the lightest touch. Such a girl sure looked like she was a goddess who had just descended from the heavens, and had never experienced the taint of the mortal world before.The most unforgettable thing to Li Tianming was still the sparkling of her skin. Unlike normal people, her skins glistened as if they were gems, giving off a soft glow in the darkness. It was exactly this glow that formed the white mist that surrounded her. Li Tianming never knew there were people so beautiful, who could make the whole world bow before their charm.The girl\u2019s appearance seemed to brighten up the forest, making Li Tianming forget about all the bloodshed and danger it hid. How could a human body give off such a pleasant glow?The girl\u2019s presence made his mind go blank. A sentiment appeared in his heart. It was a feeling he couldn\u2019t understand, and yet he knew that the two of them knew each other before, that this encounter was one decided by fate.\u201cI must admit, I\u2019m in love.\u201d Even the little chick was defeated by her beauty after getting a better look.\u201cCut your crap, we need to save her!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 16": "Chapter 16 - Possessed By A Ghost?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLi Tianming sped to her side with all the speed he could muster \u2014 he wasn\u2019t about to let such a beautiful girl die in front of him.The trees transformed into a blur as the little chick hung on for dear life. Screeching, its claws clung onto Li Tianming tightly, its little body buffeted by the passing air.\u201cAhhh, Li Tianming! So this is the kind of person you were. Hoes before bros, you horndog?!\u201d The little chick cursed as the violent jolts shook it.The distance continued to shrink, allowing Li Tianming to view the girl\u2019s overwhelming beauty with greater clarity, especially that extraordinary lustre that surrounded her.Then he saw the girl smile adorably, her dimples and twinkling eyes lighting up his vision.The wildbeast behind her was quite scary, but Li Tianming fortunately made it in time. He reached out, and grabbed hold of the girl\u2019s slender waist!A moment later, her body abruptly crumbled away, vanishing like a puff of smoke!\u201cWhat happened?\u201d The strange event seemed to justify the little chick\u2019s address of \u2018female ghost\u2019.He sensed a comprehensive increase of his power. First came his body. After enjoying the Primordial Chaos Beast treatment, his Aeternal Infernal Body possessed already higher than average strength. And yet, his bodily strength somehow began to surge. His Aeternal Infernal Beast Ki followed suit a moment later. Although his beast ki\u2019s quantity didn\u2019t increase, it had imbibed an odd quality that made it more explosive.When Li Tianming lowered his head, he noticed that his skin had taken on the same lustre that had infused the girl just now. He was now giving off that sparkling light now as well \u2014 what in the world was going on?\u201cBig brother, please dodge.\u201d A gentle voice entered his ears. Such a pleasant voice had to belong to that girl \u2014 Li Tianming was sure of it.If she hadn\u2019t died or crumbled to bits, where was she?As Li Tianming continued to wonder, the voice said, \u201cBig brother, now\u2019s not the time for that. Why don\u2019t we run first?\u201d\u201cSounds like a good plan!\u201d That murderous wildbeast had already found a new prey in Li Tianming. It was a tall and savage ape, with a muscular body that sported golden, sharp fur from head to toe.Li Tianming recognised it as a two-star wildbeast, the Golden Ape. Overlords amongst their two-star brethren, they could contend with the eighth level of the Beast Vein stage upon maturity. Obviously, the one in front of them had already reached adulthood.The star rating for wildbeasts and lifebound beasts were similar, but for lifebound beasts it was chiefly determined by their potential, unlike wildbeasts where their strength determined it. While a lifebound beast that had reached its limits was going to be strong, a six-star lifebound beast still in its growth phase wasn\u2019t necessarily a match for a grown two-star wildbeast.There was no time to hide. At this critical moment, both Li Tianming and the little chick chose to fight!Using Ghost Step to sidestep the enemy\u2019s pounce, Li Tianming clenched his fist, delivering a Dragon-Mammoth Heavy Strike towards the back of the ape\u2019s head.The ground shook. The Golden Ape had blocked the strike, but the force from it had sent it flying away, such was Li Tianming\u2019s strength.\u201cThat strong?\u201d The man himself was a little confused. He could feel he was stronger than when he beat Li Zifeng by two whole levels. However, he had only broken through once since then. It therefore went without saying that that fairy-like girl was the reason!\u201cTake this, you nugget!\u201d The fierce little chick seized the opportunity to rush straight at the ape\u2019s eye, targeting its weak spot.Battle arts had martial and beast arts. Dragon-Mammoth Heavy Strike\u2019s beast art counterpart was the Dragon-Mammoth Heavy Claw, which the little chick was already proficient in. Its tiny claw was in no way an impediment to unleashing mighty power.\u201cRunning?\u201d Under their encirclement, the ape fled as soon as it got up. Primates like these were right at home in Red Twill Mountain Range. If it wanted to run, it wasn\u2019t going to be possible to catch up. There wasn\u2019t much point in chasing either.And with that, the crisis was averted. Still, Li Tianming was left rather bewildered. After all, if the girl hadn\u2019t caused that increase in strength, the little chick and him would have been no match for the Golden Ape.The woods were finally quiet. \u201cHaha, you\u2019re glowing all over! Well, at least you\u2019re bright now\u2026 physically!\u201d The little chick rolled over laughing.Li Tianming lowered his head, just in time to catch the lustre receding. It regathered in front of him, returning into that girl earlier on within a moment. Li Tianming could now see her clearly. She really was like a fairy, possessing almost inhuman beauty.Hold up, was she attached to him just now? Was this actually a person, or some kind of ghostly possession?\u201cBig brother, thank you for saving me just now.\u201d The girl seemed to enjoy smiling, giving another adorable and dimpled smile.\u201cErrrr?\u201d Li Tianming\u2019s mind went blank, his words slurring into an incomprehensible mess.\u201cPretty girl, ignore him. He\u2019s just a regular old nitwit.\u201d The little chick hopped onto Li Tianming\u2019s shoulder, speaking solemnly. \u201cLet me introduce myself. The name\u2019s Huo, Ying Huo. I\u2019m this nitwit\u2019s guardian chicken.\u201d\u201cHow cute!\u201d The girl picked it up and placed it onto her palm, her eyes shining as she rubbed its head.\u201cPretty girl, don\u2019t do that. I\u2019m neither a pet nor someone easy!\u201d\u201cOops, sorry!\u201d The girl returned the little chick to Li Tianming, then looked expectantly at him. \u201cBig brother, could you give it to me?\u201d\u201cNo problem. Remember to add some mushrooms when you stew it. Satisfaction guaranteed!\u201d Li Tianming happily captured the little chick, cursing it internally, \u201cLet\u2019s see if you\u2019ll dare pick up girls again!\u201dThe girl chuckled in amusement. Li Tianming really liked the simple pure smile she had. Once upon a time, there had been a girl like that too. However, after she had joined the Flameyellow Scions Institute, competition had gradually changed her.\u201cBig brother, you really are rather funny. I was just joking, I know it\u2019s your lifebound beast. I\u2019m Jiang Feiling. What\u2019s your name?\u201d\u201cAhhh well his name is honestly kinda, really, very dumb. He\u2019s called Li Tianming, the \u2018Tianming\u2019 that means fate.\u201d The little chick cut in.\u201cBig brother Tianming.\u201d The girl smiled again, clearly amused by the temperament a cute little chick had.\u201cLil\u2019 sis Ling\u2019er, you\u2019re quite pretty.\u201d The shameless little chick continued.\u201cThank you, big brother\u2026 Ying Huo.\u201d\u201cLittle sister Ling\u2019er, where\u2019s your lifebound beast?\u201d Considering how shameless the little chick was being, Li Tianming had no choice but to follow up\u201cI don\u2019t have one. I never was born with one.\u201d Her voice was casual, like she didn\u2019t care.Li Tianming realised she seemed to be like an ordinary person, without any beast ki at all. If you didn\u2019t have a lifebound beast, you couldn\u2019t cultivate.\u201cYou don\u2019t? Then just now\u2026\u201d\u201cAlthough I don\u2019t have a lifebound beast, I have some special abilities. These are secrets, but there\u2019s this strange sense of familiarity I feel, like we\u2019ve known each other for years, that makes me trust you.\u201d She looked at Li Tianming guilelessly.\u201cYou have that feeling too?\u201d Li Tianming\u2019s heart trembled. Why? The more he talked with her, the more he breathed in her scent, the stronger the sense of comfortableness and familiarity grew.He felt like they had known each other forever, but he could have sworn they had never met before.\u201cI find it strange too. My \u2018Spiritual Attachment\u2019 reached complete synchronisation for the first time in my life just now. The best synergy I\u2019ve ever had is Qing\u2019er, who was born on the same year, same month, same day as me. Even then, it\u2019s a grade six attachment.\u201d\u201cWhat is Spiritual Attachment?\u201d Li Tianming asked curiously.\u201cIt\u2019s the process that lets me transform my physical body into a spiritual body. It\u2019s an innate gift of mine that can comprehensively increase the combat power of whoever I attach myself to. A perfect attachment would likely raise it by a full stage.\u201d\u201cThat is rather miraculous.\u201d A girl, born without a lifebound beast, was able to attach her spirit to others to boost their combat strength?The trust she had for him and that sense of familiarity didn\u2019t seem so far-fetched with a complete synchronisation.\u201cTake a look at my fingernails.\u201d She raised her hand, revealing ten slender and snow-white fingers to Li Tianming. He grabbed them on reflex, luxuriating in the soft warmness he felt.\u201cBig brother\u2026\u201d The girl hurriedly pulled her hand back, her face reddening with a cute shyness.\u201cOops,\u201d Li Tianming hurriedly said. He had acted before thinking just now.\u201cJust look at my fingernail.\u201d Her face was still flushed as she raised her hands.Strange symbols resembling heavenly patterns covered eight of them. They were complicated and abstruse, and simply gazing at them was already giving him a minor headache.Only two didn\u2019t have such markings. They shone like jewels, with strange power seemingly circulating within them.\"They say I have ten special abilities, except they\u2019ve been sealed since birth. I\u2019ve unlocked two of them, one of which is Spiritual Attachment,\u201d she indicated her right pinky, \u201cAnd this finger grants me the ability of Temporal Field. It lets me create a region of space where I can control the flow of time.\u201d She said, slightly proudly.Although she wasn\u2019t a beastmaster, these two special abilities did make her seem to be Vermilion Bird\u2019s most unique existence. Furthermore, there were eight other fingernails left which would unlock at some unknown point.\u201cLing\u2019er, why not marry Li Tianming? It\u2019ll be ridiculously overpowered if those two abilities of yours support Li Tianming!\u201d The little chick suddenly said.\u201cThat wouldn\u2019t be a good idea, right? We just met\u2026\u201d The girl replied, flustered.\u201cIgnore it. It hasn\u2019t had a proper diet since young, so its brain has certain\u2026 ah, deficiencies. Putting it bluntly, it\u2019s mildly retarded.\u201d Unable to endure it any further, Li Tianming tossed the chick back into the lifebound space, preventing it from babbling anymore nonsense.\u201cLi Tianming, you traittooooorr\u2026\u201d The little chick vanished before completing its curse, and peace returned once more.Li Tianming was just about to take advantage of the situation and ask about her identity to create further opportunities to meet. when someone suddenly shot out from the right. Pushing Li Tianming away, the newcomer stood between the two, cutting his words short. \u201cWho are you, scoundrel! How dare you disrespect Ling\u2019er!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 17": "Chapter 17 - The Little Fairy from IgnispolisPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe voice of the girl that suddenly appeared was clear and fierce. Li Tianming hazarded a guess that she was the \u2018Qing\u2019er\u2019 Jiang Feiling had mentioned before.She was dressed in a simple yet elegant blue dress that showed off her slender figure. She had smooth skin, beautiful thin brows that rested on top of a pair of lively eyes. Whilst she wasn\u2019t that old, her body had developed in all the right places, with her blue dress accentuating lithe curves that weren\u2019t any worse than that beautiful Liu Qing. To finish it off, she possessed an unruly aura.When these two girls were side by side, one was like a goddess from a dream, unstained by the filth of the mortal world. The other was like a mortal princess, seven parts wilful, two parts cute and one part charming.While Jiang Feiling with her luminescent skin was naturally more otherworldly, this overbearing and slender \u2018Qing\u2019er\u2019 also had extraordinary looks.Li Tianming hadn\u2019t expected to meet such extraordinary beauties here in the wilderness. This \u2018Qing\u2019er\u2019 wasn\u2019t any less pretty than Mu Qingqing, and in fact even exceeded her in temperament.Li Tianming had previously assumed that this \u2018Qing\u2019er\u2019 was possibly a maidservant. However, now he knew he was obviously wrong. Her bearing and aura were unordinary, terrifying even. This was a demeanor born from possessing peerless talent. Even in Ignispolis, such a person was likely to possess a high status.\u201cDon\u2019t scare him, Qing\u2019er. He\u2019s not a bad guy, he saved me just now when I was being chased by a wildbeast.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d Qing\u2019er finally relaxed her guard, before giving Li Tianming a once-over. \u201cAlright then, shoo. Don\u2019t have any untoward thoughts about Ling\u2019er.\u201d\u201cYour pretty face belies a startling lack of manners.\u201d Li Tianming retorted.Qing\u2019er glared at him. \u201cCome again?\u201d Shocking beast ki that surpassed the Beast Vein stage began to pour out of her. It meant she was likely a Spiritsource beastmaster. All who could reach it so young would be famous figures in Ignispolis.\u201cQing\u2019er, don\u2019t bully big brother. Let me tell you a surprise!\u201d\u201cBig brother? Excuse me?\u201d Qing\u2019er\u2019s glare became even fiercer. Li Tianming didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry. It seemed this girl had taken him to be a scoundrel who specialised in tricking naive little girls.\u201cDo you want to hear it?\u201d Jiang Feiling pouted.\u201cFine, go ahead.\u201d Qing\u2019er said helplessly.\u201cJust now, I used Spirit Attachment on big brother. Guess what synchronisation grade it reached?\u201d Jiang Feiling blinked.\u201cSpiritual attachment? I told you to not just attach yourself to any random hobo!\u201d Qing\u2019er said, her head aching.\u201cI had no choice, a wildbeast was chasing me! Guess!\u201dQing\u2019er looked disdainfully at Li Tianming. \u201cHmm, a hobo from the countryside. I give it a grade two max.\u201d\u201cWrong! You definitely won\u2019t believe this, but it was a complete synchronisation! Watch.\u201d Jiang Feiling used Spiritual Attachment on Li Tianming again, and he felt that violent power course through his body again.\u201cDamn!\u201d Qing\u2019er was completely flummoxed to see it, and subconsciously slipped out a word that would have earned her some scandalised glances in public.\u201cSee that? Complete synchronisation! I also feel like I\u2019ve known big brother Li Tianming for ages.\u201d Jiang Feiling smiled as she reformed, eyes sparkling as she looked at Li Tianming.Qing\u2019er ground her teeth, hurriedly dragging Jiang Feiling over to her when she saw how close they were. \u201cLing\u2019er, you\u2019re being too naive. Don\u2019t always listen to other people\u2019s sweet talk. He must have deceived you when I wasn\u2019t around!\u201d\u201cNope, he was very polite.\u201d\u201cExactly, you\u2019ve fallen for his trick,\u201d Qing\u2019er gritted her teeth and continued, \u201cLet me tell you, men are bad eggs. Of course he\u2019s nice to you, you\u2019re pretty. But so what if there\u2019s complete synchronisation? A hobo from the countryside will never make anything of himself.\u201d\u201cSister, how many men have you hurt by saying that?\u201d Li Tianming was getting more annoyed with her as time went by. Were there really people like this who belittled others so much? No matter what, he really had helped Jiang Feiling.\u201cLooking to die?\u201d Qing\u2019er\u2019s head snapped towards Li Tianming as she glared at him coldly, that high-born aura on full blast again.\u201cQing\u2019er!\u201d Jiang Feiling got angry before Li Tianming did. He hadn\u2019t actually expected this little fairy to be able to get angry. Though, he did notice she was quite cute when she got angry...\u201cFine, let\u2019s ignore him then. We need to return to Ignispolis already, we\u2019ve been out for too long already.\u201d Qing\u2019er didn\u2019t want to make her unhappy, so she quickly reined in her temper.\u201cAlright.\u201d Jiang Feiling looked disappointed.\u201cAlright, you scoundrel, we\u2019re leaving. I\u2019ll thank you for helping Ling\u2019er, but erase any other thoughts you have. Both of you belong to two different worlds, so don\u2019t daydream. Just focus on your farming,\u201d Qing\u2019er spoke warningly.\u201cYou don\u2019t happen to have some issue up here, do you?\u201d Li Tianming tapped his head.\u201cYou scoundrel, I\u2026\u201d She gnashed her teeth in fury. How many would dare speak to her in this way in Ignispolis?\u201cLing\u2019er, where do you stay in Ignispolis? I\u2019ll come look for you in the future.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t tell him!\u201d Qing\u2019er covered her mouth before saying to Li Tianming, \u201cWhat Ignispolis? With your background, really, just focus on farming and contributing to Vermilion Bird\u2019s food supplies.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d After saying that, she felt her spirits lift as she ran away with Jiang Feiling. They quickly vanished into the shrubbery, leaving Li Tianming no chance to catch up even if he wanted to.However, he still gave a chuckle. Those two girls were rather interesting.Although one hadn\u2019t been very polite to him, it was because she had her guard up against him and was afraid Jiang Feiling would be tricked by him. After all, that fairy-like girl was so pure that no one would want to see her sullied.\u201cI\u2019m sure there\u2019ll be more chances for us to meet.\u201d Li Tianming didn\u2019t feel worried he wouldn\u2019t be able to find them. Qing\u2019er was definitely some famous figure in Ignispolis with her strength, and Ignispolis just so happened to be his next destination.Li Tianming summoned the little chick back out.\u201cLi Tianming! How could you hide me away like that? What unspeakable things did you do, you savage? Unbelievable, as your lifebound beast, this is an eternal stain on the awesome Ying Huo\u2019s honour.\u201d The little chick immediately started jabbering when he was released.\u201cShush. Am I that sort of person to you?\u201d\u201cDuh. I have seen you stick your hand in your pants...\u201d\u201cGod dammit! I\u2019m going to strangle you!\u201d Li Tianming attempted to seize it to vent the disappointment after the girls left.\u201cI curse your future babies to not have butts!\u201d\u201cI curse you to fly solo forever!\u201d\u201cI curse your pecker to fall off!\u201dMan and bird jumped about as they quarreled, but they didn\u2019t slow down their search for clear spirit grass. Li Tianming only had one stalk, and he needed much, much more.\u2026\u2026Three days passed and Li Tianming had delved into the depths of Red Twill Mountain. Trees stood tall and the ground was littered with shrubbery and fallen leaves. Under such circumstances, it was impossible to guess where a venomous pest or wildbeast may be lurking.He hadn\u2019t found any clear spirit grass, but he had quite the assortment of other spirit herbs. They were all important resources in this wildbeast territory. Anywhere where spirit herbs grew would always have fierce beasts and venomous pests living there.As for any spirit herbs that grew using sunlight and possessed a fire-type nature, they would directly consume it. They were actually cultivating faster than in Flamehaven.In the past, he had taken years to reach fifth level Beast Vein, but it was accomplished in twenty days this time round. The strong points of Primordial Chaos Beasts lay not in their might when they were born, but in their talent and fortune. So far, they had only excavated less than one ten-thousandth of the Aeternal Infernal Phoenix\u2019s potential.\u201cClear spirit grass!\u201d One evening, they crested a ridge to reach a flat area.Many sorts of vegetation and weeds were here, but clear spirit grass was a spirit herb and was easily identifiable even when mixed together with weeds. There were over ten stalks of it here, which was more valuable to Li Tianming than a whole pouch of spirit gems. It was enough for him to comfortably bring his mother to Flameyellow Scions Institute.The heavens really didn\u2019t turn their back on people who tried.The pair quickly sped over. \u201cMother will definitely be happy if I brought so much back!\u201d\u201cDanger!\u201d When they approached it, a streak of blue suddenly assaulted them. That blue might very well be poisonous, and as a general rule of thumb, a poisoned body was more troublesome than flesh wounds from blades.They quickly backed up and avoided the attack. When they came to a stop, they realised a black scorpion was next to the patch of clear spirit grass. It was as large as an eight-person table, its two pincers reminiscent of two hammers. Most fear-inducing was the blue tail held aloft, covered in a thick blue exoskeleton with a sharp stinger that was covered in an obviously poisonous blue liquid.That blue streak was likely that blue tail.\u201cWildbeast!\u201d Li Tianming frowned. He felt something was off about this scorpion, and on closer inspection, he realised the eyes lacked the telltale savagery of wildbeasts, but was instead filled by a human-like coldness. \u201cNo, lifebound beast!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the Blue-Tailed Scorpion, a five-star lifebound beast.\u201d Li Tianming remembered reading about this lifebound beast\u2019s data before.The subject of lifebound beasts\u2019 species and type was endless, but it was still a compulsory course for any beastmaster.Li Tianming had started from young, but it was still difficult to recognise every single lifebound beast, because just too many kinds had appeared in history.For species, lifebound beasts could generally be divided into the categories of avian, terrestrial, bug and fish.However, it didn\u2019t end there. There were also reptiles(tortoises, crocodiles), amphibians(frogs, salamanders), shellfish(snails, squids), annelids(earthworms, leeches), cnidarians(jellyfish, sea anemones) and so on. While these species looked weak, they weren\u2019t necessarily so. Some jellyfish and tortoise lifebound beasts could be eight or nine-star.In fact one of the mightiest powerhouses in the Flameyellow continent, had a nine-star lifebound beast that was technically an earthworm, but was called the Earthhell Hornwyrm.Lifebound beasts also had types. They ran the gamut from metal, wood, water, fire, earth, lightning, wind, light, dark, poison to others like star, shadow, explosion, moonlight, illusion, sound, purification, life, transformation, berserker, control, steelclad and broodmother.Types were the most basic characteristic of lifebound beasts. Metal, wood, water, fire, earth, lightning and wind were known as elemental-types.Elemental-types took up over ninety percent of all lifebound beasts, but the more unorthodox ones could be even more frightening, like the rare broodmother-type, of which ant and bee queens would belong to. They could spawn large numbers of offspring to act as an army.Largely speaking, any lifebound beast could be fixed into the box of \u2018species\u2019 and \u2018type\u2019, like Li Xuejiao\u2019s Flaming Hawk was a fire-type avian beast.Liu Qianyang\u2019s Lightning Bolt Cheetah would be a lightning-type terrestrial beast.And this Blue-Tailed Scorpion was a poison-type arachnid beast!Poison-types could be considered one of the more unorthodox types. It may have lacked the raw power of the elements, but it was definitely scarier when the poison entered your body.However, if there was a lifebound beast, there was always a beastmaster.As expected, the next moment, a thin young man in long, green robes ran over and landed in front of Li Tianming. Right on the clear spirit grass.Li Tianming frowned.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 18": "Chapter 18 - A Fight For The Clear Spirit GrassPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLi Tianming took a closer look at the youth in green robes who was obviously not from Flamehaven. He didn\u2019t expect to see a stranger in the deepest parts of Red Twill Mountain.\u201cWhy is it so easy to run into geniuses these days?\u201d Li Tianming thought. One glance was enough to tell that the youth was at Li Zifeng\u2019s level.There was no reason for him to fall out with the youth, but he needed the clear spirit grass which was below the youth\u2019s feet. Li Tianming winced as the youth stepped forward, crushing two strands of the grass under his feet, causing the spiritual energy to dissipate.\u201cYou aren't from the Lightning Manor, so what gave you the courage to step foot in this part of the mountain. Aren't you afraid to die?\u201d The youth in green glared at Li Tianming, arrogance radiating off his very being.\u201cLightning Manor? Of course I\u2019m not from the Lightning Manor.\u201d Li Tianming was stunned by the question. What did the Lightning Manor have to do with this? \u201cWhat do you mean? Are you from the Lightning Manor, and telling me that only people from the manor are allowed entry to Red Twill?\u201dDisciples of the Lightning Manor generally had lightning-type lifebound beasts, while this boy\u2019s beast was poison-type, so Li Tianming thought the odds of him being from the Lightning Manor weren\u2019t high.\u201cWell since I asked that question, it should be obvious that I\u2019m from Lightning Manor. I\u2019ll let you know that the Lightning Manor has things to do in Red Twill, and that if you don\u2019t scram from the mountain right now, you\u2019ll never make it out alive again.\u201d The youth\u2019s arrogance lent credit to his claim from Lightning Manor. Unbridled megalomania seemed to be a common trait among the geniuses of Lightning Manor, Liu Qianyang included.\u201cSure I\u2019ll leave right now. I was planning to anyway, but I just hope to gather some clear spirit grass here to cure my mother\u2019s illness. I\u2019d appreciate it if you just give me a minute or so.\u201d\u201cClear spirit grass?\u201d The youth in green lowered his head, noticing the spirit herb with red heavenly patterns under his feet.\u201cYes, a few strands and I\u2019ll be on my way,\u201d Li Tianming replied.\u201cOh.\u201d The youth nodded. Just as Li Tianming thought the youth was about to make way for him, the youth ground his foot against the ground, killing all the clear spirit grass, while smiling at Li Tianming. \u201cIf I tell you to scram, I expect you to ask how far. How dare some bumpkin like you bargain with me?\u201dLi Tianming was pretty good-tempered in general, and never one to pick a fight. But in this case all the youth needed to do was to back off a few steps. To make it worse, he destroyed the clear spirit grass when he himself clearly didn\u2019t need it. Li Tianming couldn\u2019t tolerate this kind of outrageous insult, especially not when the grass was needed to save Wei Jing\u2019s life!Li Tianming seethed with fury, what with the clear spirit grass all dead, and the intolerable smugness on the teenager\u2019s face.\u201cI don\u2019t care who you are, I\u2019ll kill you!\u201d Li Tianming cursed, his Crimson Blood Dagger already in his right hand. He clenched his left fist so hard, it almost tore the cloth used to cover it.\u201cYou bastard!\u201d The little chick was way more irascible than Li Tianming, shooting out from the top of Li Tianming\u2019s head like a bullet.The youth could never imagine a \u2018bumpkin\u2019 had the courage to pick a fight with him.\u201cAre they idiots? End them.\u201d He clearly didn\u2019t see a need to confront the pair himself, commanding his lifebound beast to attack Li Tianming instead.\u201cYou can only blame your luck on entering the mountain at this wrong time. We can\u2019t risk the odd chance that you become the first to find the manna,\u201d the youth muttered in a soft voice that Li Tianming couldn\u2019t catch.Despite its size, the Blue-Tailed Scorpion was incredibly agile. Its razor-sharp claws and poisonous tails were as deadly as top quality beastial weapons. The scorpion made use of these to hunt down prey in the fastest time possible, poisoning them in the process.BANG!The moment Li Tianming\u2019s black arm clashed against the Blue-Tail Scorpion\u2019s claws, he knew that his opponents were at seventh level Beast Vein stage. Considering that the lifebound beast was poison-type, Li Zifeng would probably be no match to him, but that was not the case for Li Tianming! On top of that, the youth had yet to make a move, which presented a great chance for Li Tianming to take them down one by one.\u201cNow!\u201d Since the chick and him could communicate telepathically, they could coordinate perfectly during battle.It was the Bloody Soul Hunt! Li Tianming and Ying Huo executed the supreme beast-ranked battle art at the same time, Li Tianming using its battle arts and the little chick using the beastial arts. The Bloody Soul Hunt placed great emphasis on the movements of its users, and within the bat of an eye, Li Tianming had dashed in front of the Blue-Tailed Scorpion!With that being said, the move synergised even better with the little chick. Given its small size and its ability to fly, the little chick was even harder to catch when using the Bloody Soul Hunt to look for its opponent\u2019s weakness. In the case of the Blue-Tailed Scorpion, the Achilles heel was its eyes!The scorpion, on the other hand, didn\u2019t even consider the little chick to be a threat, its focus only on Li Tianming. It was almost as fast as Li Tianming, its pincers aiming directly for where Li Tianming\u2019s arm was, ready to snap his arm into half!\u201cSay goodbye to your arm.\u201d The youth smiled when he saw Li Tianming\u2019s arm caught by the Blue-Tailed Scorpion.Clank! The sound was loud and crisp!Hearing that, the youth relaxed. He was almost certain that it was the sound of Li Tianming\u2019s arm snapping, but upon taking a closer look he was completely stunned.\u201cHow could it be?!\u201dIn contrast to Li Tianming\u2019s unscathed arm, the Blue-Tailed Scorpion\u2019s pincer was riddled with cracks. It was an unimaginable sight!\u201cWhat a fool, you have no idea how tough his hand is.\u201d The little chick laughed.Li Tianming, unharmed by the scorpion\u2019s attacks, made use of that opening to stab the Blue-Tailed Scorpion\u2019s eye with his Crimson Blood Dagger, causing green blood to spurt all over the place. At the same time, the little chick charged at the scorpion\u2019s other eye, its sharp beak tearing it out.\u201cCongratulations! Your prize today is one blind lifebound beast!\u201d The little chick taunted the youth in green as it rose back into the air.The severely injured Blue-Tailed Scorpion could do nothing but roll on the ground from the sheer pain of losing both eyes. Even with the best medicine, it might never see again given that amount of damage.\u201cNext comes your leg.\u201d Li Tianming was done with the Blue-Tailed Scorpion, and had already locked on to his next target. The youth had crushed all of the clear spirit grass, and Li Tianming was going to make sure he paid for that.\u201cGo to hell!\u201d The youth just recovered from the shock of his lifebound beast\u2019s defeat, and in his fury he drew several needles. Those silver needles were evidently top quality beastial weapons, made with precious spirit ores. Li Tianming had a hunch that they were Heart-Piercing Needles, poisonous weapons with a distinctive blue tip.Zoom! The youth threw the needle straight at Li Tianming and the little chick. Sadly for him, his weapon was countered by the pair using Bloody Soul Hunt. Top-tier movement arts could easily dodge this kind of attacks, and once the Heart Piercing Needle missed, the youth would be directly exposed to Li Tianming\u2019s attacks.Within moments, Li Tianming and his little chick had the youth surrounded. Li Tianming\u2019s black arm balled up, and with the Crimson Blood Dagger in his right hand, he struck out mercilessly. Using a sudden burst of his Aeternal Infernal Beast Ki, he landed a direct punch on the youth\u2019s abdomen area, sending the poor boy flying back.BANG!The youth struggled to climb up from the ground, blood dribbling out of his mouth.\u201cSo you weren\u2019t as useless as you look, but I\u2019ll let you know that I\u2019ll still kill you! I\u2019m gonna flay the flesh off your body piece by piece and have you begging me to give you a quick death!\u201d His eyes were blazing murderously.\u201cFor someone who can\u2019t even stand up now, you sure like to talk big.\u201d Li Tianming stared at the youth coldly. No matter how much he beat up the youth, the clear spirit grass wasn\u2019t coming back. \u201cYou deserve another slap.\u201dThe youth was sent flying backwards again, leaving a trail of snot and blood in his wake. For someone who was deriding Li Tianming as a bumpkin just moments ago, the youth sure was in a bad state.\"Which damned leg of yours stepped on the clear spirit grass again?\u201d Li Tianming asked, jabbing his Crimson Blood Dagger into the youth\u2019s thigh. But it was at that moment, something unexpected happened\u2026\u201cAHHHHH!! DAD, MUM, SAVE ME!\u201d The youth let out a piercing shriek that echoed through the forest.\u201cDamn it.\u201d Li Tianming was caught by surprise. Why would the youth take his parents with him on a trip to Red Twill? If he was from the Lightning Manor, then his parents must be too. If they caught Li Tianming, he would be in deep shit.It was time for a tactical retreat. The landscape of Red Twill Mountain were complicated, and if Li Tianming got a head start, there was still a good chance of him making it out.\u201cDon\u2019t you dare run! Before night falls, you'll be hunted down! And when you meet the king of hell, tell him Zhang Zixuan sent you there!\u201d As Li Tianming scrambled for the bushes, the youth roared behind him.\"Zhang Zixuan? What a crappy, overused name!\" Li Tianming muttered as he disappeared into the foliage.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It was Jiang Feiling and Qing\u2019er! He could only imagine that it was fate that brought them together again.Qing\u2019er was definitely a talented girl born from a reputable family, and with her pretty looks, she would no doubt be the center of attention everywhere she went. Yet, when placed alongside Jiang Feiling, Li Tianming couldn\u2019t help but direct most of his attention on Jiang Feiling. No other word but perfection could describe her fairy-like presence.\u201cWeren\u2019t they about to return to Ignispolis? Why are they still here? \u201d Li Tianming thought curiously. But more importantly, he was still being hunted by members of the Lightning Manor! They would be in danger too!\u201cNo time to explain, we need to run!\u201d Li Tianming charged straight at them, ready to grab one with each hand and bring the both of them with him. No matter how talented Qing\u2019er may be, there\u2019s no way she could win against two adults.\u201cWhy are you running, stop there.\u201d Qing\u2019er folded her arms to dodge Li Tianming while rolling her eyes at him.Meanwhile the two girls' appearance had delayed Li Tianming\u2019s escape, and within moments, a middle-aged couple had caught up with him.The couple was clearly boiling with anger. Just a minute they took their eyes off their precious son and he was already beaten up by an outsider? Just as they were about to bring Li Tianming to justice, a girl in green blocked their way.\u201cPrincess Qing!\u201d\u201cGreetings, Princess Qing, I am Zhang Chong from the Lightning Manor and this is my wife. It is an honor for you to grace us with your presence here.\u201d The middle-aged man hurriedly lowered his head to show as much deference as possible.\u201cPrincess? No way\u2026\u201d Only one type of person in Vermilion Bird would be addressed as Princess. They were the daughters of the Vermilion Bird King!Li Tianming could tell that Qing\u2019er was from a reputable family, but the Vermilion Bird clan, rulers of the land? Even with his status as a Flameyellow Scions Institute disciple three years ago, he would never dream of talking to a princess. Even Lin Xiaoting, the number one genius in Heaven\u2019s Sanctum right now, had to bow in front of her like what Zhang Chong just did!After all, her father was the ruler of this land!A brief recollection of what he said two days ago left Li Tianming in a cold sweat. Did he really ask a princess what\u2019s wrong with her head\u2026With that information, Li Tianming roughly gauged Princess Qing\u2019s strength to be close to Lin Xiaoting\u2019s level. The Vermilion Bird Clan had after all controlled Vermilion Bird for millennia, and their clan\u2019s history and wealth definitely surpassed that of Lightning Manor\u2019s.\u201cDispense with the formalities.\u201d Qing\u2019er waved her hands at the couple, but her eyes were trained on Li Tianming. From that smug look, he could almost hear her saying: \u201dNow that you know who I am, do you still want to jeer at me?\u201d\u201cFor what noble purpose is the princess doing in Red Twill Mountain Range? There\u2019s many wildbeasts around here, and if the princess is not well protected...\u201d Zhang Chong\u2019s head was still lowered.\u201cAnd who told you I am not protected?\u201d Qing\u2019er didn\u2019t let him finish his sentence. Now that she was no longer hiding her identity as a princess, her voice had a natural sense of nobility to it. This scared Zhang Chong from speaking any further.\u201cForgive him, Princess, but Zhang Chong was simply too concerned about your highness\u2019 safety that he panicked. Of course with the princess\u2019s identity, how was it possible to not have experts protecting your highness?\u201d Zhang Chong\u2019s wife hastily tried to cover up her husband\u2019s blunder.As for Zhang Zixuan, he had just caught up with the group. But when he saw that even his parents had their heads lowered, he didn\u2019t dare to utter a word.The atmosphere was tense, and only Jiang Feiling was winking at Li Tianming with a smile on her face. Seeing her smile, Li Tianming knew that his safety was in good hands, just that there was no escape from being laughed at by Qing\u2019er later...\u201cYou said you are Zhang Chong from the Lightning Manor?\u201d Qing\u2019er had her hands behind her back, her actions befitting her noble family background.\u201cYes, your highness.\u201d The man could only nod his head.\u201cAnd what is the Lightning Manor doing here? I saw a few others from your manor around here two days ago.\u201d\u201cErrr\u2026\u201d Zhang Chong hesitated for a brief moment.\u201cTired of living?\u201d Qing\u2019er asked.\u201cI plead for your forgiveness, Princess. I\u2019ll talk.\u201d Zhang Chong was sweating all over, a totally different figure as compared to when he just appeared. Unfortunately, he ran into someone way more powerful than him.\u201cMy patience is wearing thin,\u201d Qing\u2019er said. Li Tianming was equally curious about their business in Red Twill.\u201cHere\u2019s the full story, your highness. The Lightning Manor has found manna at the Red Twill Mountain Range, and we selected seven juniors to compete for it. They will each have seniors accompanying them, but we are not allowed to affect the competition in any way, and are only here to ensure their safety.\u201d Zhang Chong explained the entire event.\u201cWhat tier is this manna?\u201d The word \u2018manna\u2019 clearly sparked Qing\u2019er\u2019s interest. Even if she didn\u2019t need it, the lowest royal manna were still pricey treasures.\u201cYour highness, it is but substandard manna that can\u2019t even be rated royal. It is only capable of evolving a lifebound beast to six stars.\u201d\u201cSubstandard? You are aware of the consequences of lying, correct?\u201d Qing\u2019er looked slightly disappointed. Clearly the manna wasn\u2019t good enough to rarouse her interest.\u201cI would never dare to. My son didn\u2019t have much hope of getting it anyway, so there\u2019s no reason for me to deceive your highness.\u201d Zhang Chong gave a bitter smile.That being said, the lowest tier manna could already be considered a treasure in Flamehaven. Perhaps only the real elites from Heaven\u2019s Division or the Vermilion Bird clan would find no use for it.\u201cI doubt you have the gall to do so anyway. You may disappear from my sight now.\u201d Qing\u2019er waved her hands again, her eyes filled with impatience.\u201cWe thank you, Princess, my family and I will take our leave now.\u201d Zhang Chong was clearly relieved that this was over. As he signaled his wife and Zhang Zixuan to take their leave, the couple approached Li Tianming, ready to bring him with them.\u201cWait.\u201d Qing\u2019er glanced at Li Tianming, and said unhappily, \u201cLeave the pig here.\u201dLi Tianming stared in disbelief. Did she just call him a pig?\u201cBut Princess, he\u2019s just a local bumpkin who assaulted my son\u2019s lifebound beast. We just wish to teach him a lesson,\u201d Zhang Chong said.\u201cYour highness, may I ask for permission to take revenge for my lifebound beast...\u201d Zhang Zixuan finally mustered up his courage to speak in front of the princess.\u201cNo, you may not. I want this pig here. Now begone.\u201d Qing\u2019er said again, leaving no room for bargaining.At one side, Li Tianming couldn\u2019t help but sigh. If it wasn\u2019t for the two girls stopping him here, he would be long gone. Instead he was stuck here listening to the princess calling him a pig.\u201cBut princess\u2026\u201d\u201cOut of my sight. Now. Don\u2019t make me repeat myself.\u201d Qing\u2019er was not going to give them any chance.Zhang Zixuan\u2019s face bloated up in anger, but he couldn\u2019t utter a single word as his father forcefully dragged him away. Even when leaving, he continued to tremble as if he was having constipation. He even turned back multiple times to stare at Li Tianming with a burning hatred.\u2026\u2026Only when they were completely gone did Li Tianming turn to face Princess Qing.\u201cWhat are you staring at? Not happy with me calling you a pig?\u201d Qing\u2019er stared back at him, her puffy cheeks making her cuter than usual.\u201cOf course I\u2019m happy. How dare I be unhappy with the princess?\u201d Li Tianming replied.\u201cQing\u2019er, don\u2019t treat big brother like this. He did save me a few days back.\u201d Jiang Feiling ran back to Li Tianming\u2019s side the moment the Zhang family left. \u201cBig brother, are you injured?\u201d\u201cNot at all, thank you for your concern, Ling\u2019er. Gentle girls like you are hard to come by these days.\u201d Li Tianming smiled.\u201cAre you hinting that I\u2019m not gentle?\u201d Qing\u2019er quirked an eyebrow.\u201cHey, I didn\u2019t say that.\u201d\u201cWhatever. I give you leave to return to your farming, while we return to Ignispolis. See you, or rather, hope to never see you again. \u201d Qing\u2019er dragged Jiang Feiling back to her side, as if she wished for Li Tianming to stay as far away from her Ling\u2019er as possible.\u201cQing\u2019er, a moment. I have something important to say to big brother.\u201d Jiang Feiling said.\u201cSomething important?\u201d Li Tianming was taken aback.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Since we parted two days ago, Qing\u2019er said she wanted to follow you for a while more, and study why I could get a perfect synchronization with you. Therefore, we\u2019ve been following you for a few days already. I hope you won\u2019t blame Ling\u2019er for this.\u201d Jiang Feiling explained sincerely.\u201cOf course not.\u201d Li Tianming replied.He lowered his head to take a better look at the girl with the glowing skin. Her skin was so pure, as if she walked straight out from a fairy tale. As her watery eyes stared at him, Li Tianming could almost feel his heart being cleansed.\u201cQing\u2019er still couldn\u2019t figure out the reason in the end, so she gave up. I just told her that there must be some kind of bond decided by fate between us. Next time when big brother comes to Ignispolis, remember to visit Ling\u2019er. If I unlock any new abilities I\u2019d want to try them out with you.\u201d Jiang Feiling said, her eyes sparkling with anticipation.\u201cDefinitely. Of course I will visit you.\u201d Li Tianming replied.\u201cYou are not worthy enough to. Probably won\u2019t even be able to make it past the city guards, so just focus on farming at home.\u201d Qing\u2019er rolled her eyes long and hard. She sure was determined about asking Li Tianming to farm and contribute to her nation\u2019s food supplies.\u201cQing\u2019er, give big brother a jade pendant, so it\u2019s easier for him to come and find me next time.\u201d Right before they left, Jiang Feiling had an idea.\u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201d Qing\u2019er pouted.\u201cQing\u2019er?\u201d\u201cFine! Ling\u2019er you\u2019ve changed, you weren\u2019t like this before you met this pig!\u201d Qing\u2019er was clearly unwilling, but she still produced a jade pendant from her pocket and threw it at Li Tianming. \u201cYou stupid pig, better not let me catch you using my pendant for wrongdoings, or I will see to it that your chicken gets stewed alive!\u201dThe little chick was truly unfortunate. This wasn\u2019t the first time someone wanted to make him their dinner.\u201cBig brother, if you get into situations like the one just now, just bring out the pendant and mention that you are under Princess Qing. This way, no one would dare to kill you,\u201d Jiang Feiling said gently.Li Tianming kept the pendant in his pocket gratefully. The one thing he was really lacking right now was backing, and this pendant was exactly what he needed. He couldn\u2019t hope for a better gift!\u201cThank you, Ling\u2019er.\u201d He thanked the girl solemnly.\u201cBig brother, who else should you thank?\u201d Jiang Feiling blinked her eyes mischievously.Li Tianming reacted immediately. \u201cPrincess Qing, much thanks for your jade pendant.\u201d\u201cYou are welcome. I warn you again, do not use this to scam others, and especially not to ruin my reputation!\u201d Jiang Qingluan\u2019s cheeks were still puffed up from her little tantrum.\u201cNo worries, I solemnly swear upon my farmer honor that I will take this pendant off while farming so as to not stain it.\u201d Li Tianming said solemnly.Princess Qing couldn\u2019t help but crack up from the joke. Finding it embarrassing to laugh out loud, she immediately went back to maintaining a straight face.\u201cBig brother, come here.\u201d Jiang Feiling smiled too when listening to their conversation, and beckoned Li Tianming once they were done.\u201cYeah?\u201d Li Tianming asked.\u201cGot a secret for you,\u201d Jiang Feiling replied.\u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d Li Tianming lowered his head and brought his ears closer. He could smell her faint scent, a smell that he found almost intoxicating. From the corner of his eyes, the sight of the lass\u2019s cheeks made his heart pound faster than ever.\u201cBig brother, do you want the manna? It\u2019s over there.\u201d Jiang Feiling whispered in his ears, while pointing.Li Tianming was baffled. How did she know he wanted to find the manna?! And how in the world did she know where the manna was? This must be the \u2018important thing\u2019 she was referring to previously. For a seemingly normal girl with no beast ki, Jiang Feiling surprised him yet again. Just how many mysterious abilities does this girl have?\u201cLing\u2019er, let\u2019s go.\u201d Qing\u2019er rushed her. This time, they really needed to leave.\u201cBig brother, I\u2019ll see you again in Ignispolis.\u201d Before Li Tianming could recover from his shock, the pair were already disappearing. Even after the two left, Li Tianming was still dazed, complete with a bit of disappointment from not being able to see Ling\u2019er in a while. It wasn\u2019t just because of her looks, but more of the sense of belonging he could feel when he was with her.Li Tianming thought about the time they had together. She looked so pure and innocent, yet she was thoughtful and was able to figure out what he was thinking about. Not only did she get him a jade pendant from princess Qing, a lifesaver for him, she also noticed his minute change in expression when he heard about the manna, which led her to point out the direction of the manna for him. Li Tianming couldn\u2019t help but wonder just what other secrets this girl might hold!The fateful encounter with Jiang Feiling had already left a permanent mark in his heart.\u201cHyperactive hormones, eh?\u201d The little chick didn\u2019t miss this opportunity to laugh at Li Tianming.\u201cI\u2019ll give you a choice. Grilled or stewed?\u201d Li Tianming kept the pendant, his eyes still staring in the direction where Jiang Feiling left.\u201cHa! I can beat you single-wingedly.\u201d The little chick jeered back smugly.\u201cAnd now?\u201d Li Tianming brought up his left arm, the dark arm in full view.\u201cAhh brother!\u201d The little chick\u2019s attitude took a hundred eighty degree turn. \u201cDo you need a nice massage? Perhaps I can get you a drink?\u201d\u201cMuch better now,\u201d Li Tianming teased.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\u201cHmmm\u2026 Manna.\u201d Li Tianming tried to recall the stories he heard about this treasure.It was said that manna was divine blessings given physical form. It came in all sorts of shapes, some stones, some gems, and some even appeared as liquids. Whenever a lifebound beast or a wildbeast obtained a manna matching their type, it could trigger an evolution that enhanced the beast, boosting both the beast and its beastmaster\u2019s limits.Out of the four different tiers of manna, even the most common imperial ones were said to evolve a lifebound beast to seven-stars. Seven-stars! That was sufficient to forge the scariest beastmasters! In Vermilion Bird, seven-star lifebound beasts were known as \u2018Royal Beasts\u2019, crowned as the king of lifebound beasts!Profound and terrestrial manna had even more absurd effects. For example, terrestrial manna was capable of evolving lifebound beasts to legendary \u2018Saint Beasts\u2019! Saint beasts stood at the pinnacle of the entire Flameyellow continent, and the Saintbeast War-Soul that Li Tianming once had was related to them!As for celestial manna, they appeared only in legends and myths.\u201cYing Huo, you mentioned that manna would be of great benefit to you?\u201d Li Tianming asked on a more serious note.\u201cThat\u2019s right. When I heard about it, I managed to fish out quite a lot of information from my memory. Although my abilities as a Primordial Chaos Beast were restricted when I became a lifebound beast, the evolution caused by manna can help me get rid of these restrictions. My primal instinct tells me that if I keep evolving, I may eventually go back to my original form as the Aeternal Infernal Phoenix.\u201d\u201cThen what are we waiting for? We know you need the manna, and we know where it is, so let\u2019s not dillydally any further.\u201d Li Tianming told the little chick.\u201cAre you telling me you want to rob Lightning Manor\u2019s manna? They have seven contestants, each of them guarded by parents or seniors who could easily squash you,\u201d The little chick exclaimed.\u201cThe pendant will come in handy against their parents. From the way Zhang Chong reacted to the princess, they\u2019re probably middle-class members of the Lightning Manor and do not have that much power in Ignispolis,\u201d Li Tianming explained. The jade pendant meant that he had princess Qing protecting him.\u201cTherefore all I need to deal with are the younger generations.\u201d Li Tianming\u2019s eyes shrunk. While Lin Xiaoting may be the main culprit for Midas\u2019s death, plenty of disciples from Lightning Manor were at one side watching and cheering him on. Even if the ones in Red Twill Mountain were not present on that night, Li Tianming just couldn\u2019t see them being friends, and probably would not resist his urge to punch them on sight. After all most of them, like Zhang Zixuan just now, were rotten to the core.\u201cHey, I just realised something.\u201d The little chick suddenly said.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cLiu Qianyang mentioned that he would be staying in Flamehaven for a month, right? The only reason for him to stay that long is because he is contesting for the manna as well! As someone in ninth level Beast Vein, he probably has the highest chance of getting the manna!\u201d The little chick spoke with a hint of disgust, as it remembered how that teenager robbed Li Tianming of his Flameyellow Order.\u201cYou are right, he must be here! That means his sister Liu Qing and my father would be here too. Now this is getting interesting.\u201d The challenge ahead had gotten Li Tianming burning with anticipation.\u201cWhat kind of a father is he? Giving the Flameyellow Order to Liu Qianyang, then bringing him here to win the manna. Are you sure you are his real son, not Liu Qianyang?\u201d The little chick spat. Indeed, how ironic it was that his father ousted him from the family and gave everything to an outsider!\u201cHe used to come to Red Twill Mountain quite often, so you probably can\u2019t find someone more familiar with the terrain here. This Liu Qing, you reckon she married Li Yanfeng for her brother\u2019s Flameyellow Order and manna?\u201d\u201cQuite possible.\u201d\u201cTouching.\u201d Li Tianming stood up, looking at the direction Jiang Feiling left once again.\u201cThen that\u2019s even more reason for me to snatch this manna from you and ruin your plans, Li Yanfeng! And Liu Qianyang, just you wait, because I will take back what is rightfully mine!\u201dWith that, Li Tianming and Ying Huo delayed no further, as the two of them marched on towards an inevitable fight!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 21": "Chapter 21 - The Mysterious Well In The Lake!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLi Tianming realised the direction Jiang Feiling pointed for him didn\u2019t simply lead him to the manna. As the concentration of spiritual energy in the air increased, not only did the number of beasts and nasty critters increased, but also the number of spirit herbs. Since the atmospheric temperature in the Red Twill Mountain Range was quite high all year round, the plants here were able to absorb a lot of spiritual energy from direct sunlight. As a result, most spirit herbs formed here were of the fire type.In other words, this was paradise for the Aeternal Infernal Phoenix!It had been ten days since Li Tianming started walking in this direction. While he hadn\u2019t found the manna, he did acquire quite a handful of spirit herbs with orange heavenly patterns. Other than three fire lingzhis, he also found orange-patterned spirit herbs such as the flaming great fruit and magmaflow leaves. As their journey towards the manna continued, the two also digested a considerable number of spirit herbs. The rewards that this place offered was proportionate to the amount of risks lurking in its shadows.\u201cBreakthrough!\u201d\u201cSixth level Beast Vein!\u201dIn terms of cultivation level, he had now surpassed Li Xuejiao, and was reaching Li Zifeng\u2019s level.\u201cThis cultivation pace is indeed unfathomable. Thinking back, I took a few years to reach sixth level when I started from scratch,\u201d Li Tianming exclaimed. Of course, these changes were only possible due to his bond with the Aeternal Infernal Phoenix, which highlighted how fundamentally different the Aeternal Infernal Phoenix was from the Four-Winged Goldroc.\u201cThe second egg is still just rolling around in my lifebound space. This little fella is quite lazy, refusing to just hatch.\u201d Given how strong Ying Huo was, Li Tianming couldn\u2019t wait for his second Primordial Chaos Beast.On the other hand, they managed to find quite a bit of clear spirit grass in the past few days. It wasn\u2019t really a rare spirit herb, and was more common in the deeper parts of Red Twill Mountain Range. In fact, he had already collected more than thirty strands, each of them carefully kept and packed.\u201cThis trip is taking quite a while. Since I have enough clear spirit grass already, all I need now is the manna and then I can go back home.\u201d\u201cSince Ling\u2019er pointed me in this direction, it must eventually lead me to where the treasure is!\u201d\u2026\u2026Two days after reaching sixth level Beast Vein, Li Tianming found a lake located high up the mountain, boasting the highest concentration of spiritual energy in the mountain. Just by looking at the lake, he could see steam coming out of it. A searing heat engulfed his finger as he dipped it inside; a person without cultivation would have been scalded from simply stepping into the water.Since this lake lied exactly in the direction Jiang Feiling was pointing at, and was also the most special place they encountered so far, Li Tianming decided to dive into it.\u201cWatch out, I can feel something foul is resting in the lake. Even if the manna is inside here, there\u2019s probably some kind of trial that we have to clear first,\u201d Li Tianming warned the little chick.\u201cCoward. Be like me! Heroic, valiant and resolute!\u201d Ying Huo wasn\u2019t going to miss its chance to diss Li Tianming. But just moments later, after the pair dived into the boiling lake, the little chick hid itself frantically in Li Tianming\u2019s clothes, its little head poking out nervously.The water was quite muddy, making it difficult to see the bottom of the lake, but Li Tianming was pleasantly surprised to find that his third eye on the dark arm could see clearly even under such circumstances. Its vision was hardly affected by the clarity of the water, giving Li Tianming a good view of his surroundings.If he was to remove the bandage off his arm right now, one would observe that Li Tianming\u2019s left arm was in fact quite stylish, its eye shining through the darkness of the muddy lake water. This gave Li Tianming\u2019s normally cultured look a sense of demonic charm. With the Crimson Blood Dagger in his right hand, Li Tianming seemed like a soul reaper roaming the dark lake.He soon reached the bottom of the lake, where the temperature was even higher. Even the rocks were red-hot, suggesting that there were magma veins flowing below the lakebed, explaining the high concentration of fire type spiritual energy in the region.\u201cThe vision is incredible!\u201d Li Tianming reckoned that even if someone managed to dive to his position, they probably couldn\u2019t see a thing. The little chick was in fact unable to see anything around them, and Li Tianming himself was entirely relying on the black arm to know where they were going.After searching roughly a third of the lake\u2026\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d Li Tianming swept away a few pebbles on the lakebed, revealing a well in the depth of the lake! The well seemed to be made out of some kind of bronze, the marks on its surfaces hinting at the rich history it may have.The opening of the well was sealed off by a mossy green slate. It seemed to be firmly locked in place, and they found no ways to pry it open. Furthermore, the well was extremely well hidden, and it was hard to imagine anyone finding it without using something like Li Tianming\u2019s third eye.\u201cOoooooh, an ancient sealed well, wonder what kind of treasure lies inside.\u201d The little chick imagined after Li Tianming described it to him.\u201cLook at that, that looks like a keyhole.\u201d Li Tianming pointed at the slate.\u201cI can\u2019t see for shit dammit,\u201d the little chick mumbled.\u201cCould the manna be inside?\u201d\u201cThen we will have to find the key, it\u2019s probably somewhere inside this lake too.\u201dIn his mind, Li Tianming took down the position of this well. It was a large lake, and there were about two thirds of it that he had yet to explore.After another fifteen minutes of searching, Li Tianming found a faint glimmer coming from the lake\u2019s centre! He swam towards it and found a strangely shaped rock lying on the lakebed. The rock was glowing faintly, and Li Tianming could feel that there was something sacred about the rock.\u201cThis must be the key!\u201d Li Tianming was thrilled.However, the little chick had other opinions.\u201cNo, that IS the manna!\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean? The shape of this rock fits perfectly with the keyhole we saw on the well just now.\u201d\u201cThis is the manna itself. I can already smell its fragrance, what makes you think that I can\u2019t tell if this is manna?\u201d The little chick was far more excited than he was.\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Li Tianming inspected the rock again, before realising that it indeed fit the descriptions of manna that he read in textbooks before. He expected it to be much more well hidden, perhaps inside that well, and not just casually lying in the centre of the lake.\u201cThis must be it, just grab it already.\u201d The little chick pressed him on.\u201cEven if it is the manna, I\u2019m pretty damn sure it\u2019s a key to that well too. Perhaps we can find other stuff inside there,\u201d Li Tianming pondered.\u201cSimple, just take the manna then we can try it out,\u201d the little chick suggested.As Li Tianming reached for the manna, he had an ominous feeling. For something so precious, the manna was suspiciously easy to obtain.\u201cWait!\u201d Li Tianming stopped in his tracks and observed his surroundings.\u201cI can sense a wildbeast around!\u201d Apparently the little chick had the same feeling.As they made one round around the manna, they found two rows of blades emerging from the mud behind their prize. There were more than a dozen blades in each row, each of them more than a meter tall and had algae shrouded over them. Even at a distance, they could tell that the blades are sharp and deadly.These blades were not wildbeasts themselves, but part of a much bigger wildbeast. There must be a giant creature resting beneath the mud, its length probably nothing short of ten meters. Luckily for Li Tianming, the beast was probably resting, and hadn\u2019t noticed the intruders who were already in close proximity.\u201cRazor-Backed Colossal Crocodile, a three-star wildbeast.\u201d Li Tianming frowned. The rows of blades were telltale signs of its species.Indeed, the challenge to get the manna had just began. A three-star wildbeast was comparable to a Spiritsource beastmaster, and they also wielded threatening \u2018innate abilities\u2019. Li Tianming was just sixth level Beast Vein, so there was no way he could defeat the crocodile in a direct confrontation. In fact, it was way scarier than Liu Qianyang, and even the Spiritsource stage Li Tianming three years ago would be no match for it.\u201cIf we can\u2019t win with brawn, then we have to win with our brains.\u201d Li Tianming came to a quick conclusion.The little chick wasn\u2019t exactly impressed. \u201cAnd how do we do that, genius?\u201d\u201cI will bait it into leaving the lake, and you make use of this opportunity to steal the manna. Simple as that.\u201d Li Tianming explained his plans. They outnumbered the Razor-Backed Colossal Crocodile, and since wildbeasts were unintelligent creatures, they could easily distract it with a bit of taunting.\u201cYou, bait? What makes you think the wildbeast couldn\u2019t catch you?\u201d The little chick questioned.\u201cWhat other choice do I have? It\u2019s not like you have the balls to go be the bait, you nugget,\u201d Li Tianming said, mockery tinting his words.\u201cWhat did you say?!\u201d The little chick fluffed itself up angrily. \u201cSay it again, I dare you!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019d be far better as a bait, but too bad you\u2019re just a chicken.\u201d\u201cI'll be the bait, and when I come back you better be on your knees thanking me for it!\u201d The little chick hissed.Truth be told, the little chick was a much better choice than Li Tianming. The Razor-Backed Colossal Crocodile was strong, but its massive size meant that its movements would be very much hindered in the forest. On top of that, the little chick was capable of flying as well, which meant that it would be very difficult for the crocodile to even reach the little chick. If Ying Huo simply dashed through the bushes and disappeared from its sight, there was probably nothing the crocodile could do.\u201cSo what do we do after that? Are we going to try opening the well with that manna?\u201d The little chick asked.\u201cWe need to meet up first. If you can lure the Razor-Backed Colossal Crocodile far enough, then we'll have enough time to try that out.\u201d\u201cYou can always go down there alone. Ohhh, is it because you don\u2019t dare to go inside alone without me?\u201d The little chick sneered.\u201cOnly because I\u2019m worried you\u2019d get eaten by the crocodile.\u201d Li Tianming rolled his eyes. In his opinion, they should refrain from splitting up \u2014 there were still enemies from the Lightning Manor around.It didn\u2019t take them long to get out of the lake and prepare for their plan. Li Tianming had already found a hiding spot somewhere nearby, and it was showtime for the little chick.\u201cBe careful.\u201d Li Tianming was confident in its abilities, but reminded it again just in case.\u201cWatch and learn, I will teach you how to kite like a real master.\u201d The little chick was all pumped up and ready. As soon as Li Tianming gave the signal, it dashed into the lake like a bullet, and reached the crocodile in no time.The Razor-Backed Colossal Crocodile was deep asleep when the little chick landed on its head. Without hesitation, Ying Huo used its wings to lift up the crocodile\u2019s eyelid, and gave its eye a good, hard peck.\u201cYour mama moaned so loudly last night, but you\u2019re still fast asleep?\u201d The little chick squawked. That was more than enough to wake up and enrage the Razor-Backed Colossal Crocodile, who let out an earth-shaking roar from the pain in its eyes.\u201cCome and chase me, you idiot!\u201d Seeing that its plan was effective, the little chick flapped its wings and flew out of the lake. Moments later, the giant black crocodile leaped out of the lake as well. It swept up a massive amount of lakewater, forming water tornados that went straight for the little chick!Boom!The water tornado missed the little chick and hit the forest in front of it, causing an explosion of water and wood splinters. That was its innate ability, and could probably kill the little chick instantly if it was a direct hit.\u201cFool, you\u2019ll never catch me!\u201d The little chick\u2019s movements were swift as it weaved through the water tornadoes.The Razor-Backed Colossal Crocodile couldn\u2019t understand what the little chick was saying, but it did get the idea that it was being insulted. With another roar, the crocodile charged after the little chick, going deeper and deeper into the forest.This was the perfect chance for Li Tianming! With the amount of noise the crocodile was making, Li Tianming could infer where its position was. There was enough time for him to extract the manna before the wildbeast returned.Without a second thought, Li Tianming dived into the lake.\u201cManna, here I come!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 22": "Chapter 22 - Killing You Is As Easy As Squashing An Ant!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIgnoring all the waves that the Razor-Backed Colossal Crocodile stirred up when it left the lake, Li Tianming dived right back into the water, aiming directly at the manna. He swam as fast as he could and approached the manna within a few minutes.\u201cGot it!\u201d The manna was small enough for him to keep in his pockets. Once his goal was achieved, Li Tianming didn\u2019t waste a single second and swam back to the surface.So much for having to go through challenging trials to get the manna!Li Tianming knew he needed to converge with Ying Huo first. The little chick had played the most important part in this mission, and it just needed to shake the crocodile off its tail now. If it did manage to lure the crocodile deep into the forest, then they would have enough time to try and open up that well.Li Tianming also didn\u2019t want to be separated from the little chick for prolonged periods of time. Beastmasters should always refrain from doing so, as it led to the risk of them being picked off one by one.Sadly for Li Tianming, it wasn\u2019t the little chick, but danger that found him first.\u201cWho are you?\u201d A girl dressed in blue appeared in front of him. She was a bit younger than him, her eyes were the same shade of blue as the dress she was wearing. She had a delightful look, the only downside being that she seemed to have a spoilt temperament, similar to Li Xuejiao. If Li Tianming guessed correctly, this girl must have been attracted by the commotion caused by the Razor-Backed Colossal Crocodile, and was a member of the Lightning Manor.\u201cThe manna is with him!\u201d A deep voice echoed from the distance. Li Tianming looked towards the direction of the voice, and saw two middle-aged men dressed in black. Based on their appearances, Li Tianming suspected the two to be siblings.\u201cFather, uncle, are you sure?\u201d The girl glanced at Li Tianming indifferently. She stood still on the surface of the lake like a lotus leaf in a pond. From the gentle ripples beneath her feet, Li Tianming could tell that she was pretty strong, possibly stronger than Zhang Zixuan.\u201cOf course we are sure, just grab it already. The Razor-Backed Colossal Crocodile may be back any time, and according to the rules we are not allowed to engage the crocodile,\u201d said the man with the longer beard. Beastmasters like them had already reached the peak of their cultivation, and there was no way any member of the younger generation could take a single hit from them.\u201cUnderstood.\u201d The girl turned towards Li Tianming and denounced him. \u201cI don\u2019t know where you're from, but I will make it clear that this manna here belongs to the Lightning Manor. One chance. Leave the manna here and walk off unharmed, or you will never make it out of this mountain alive.\u201d\"Must disciples of Lightning Manor always be so domineering and rude?\" Li Tianming thought to himself, as he turned around and left without a single word.\u201cYou have sealed your own fate!\u201d His move angered the girl, who instantly went after him. At the same time, her lifebound beast was summoned from her lifebound space and dived straight into the lake.\u201cHer lifebound beast is water-type!\u201d From the corner of his eyes, Li Tianming saw a massive blue fish with glittering scales. Other than a few pairs of eyes, there was also a spike protruding out of its head. This lifebound beast evidently excelled in underwater combat, and the lake was the most ideal arena for the girl.Within seconds, Li Tianming could feel the fish approaching him rapidly. In a single swift movement, the beast leapt out of the lake, its spike aimed directly at Li Tianming\u2019s back!Splash!Li Tianming dodged the attack with his movement arts, while the fish plunged back into the lake, ready for a second round of attack.\u201cSix-Eyed Flying Fish, a five-star water-type fish lifebound beast.\u201d Li Tianming could tell the species from one look at the number of eyes it had.Li Tianming continued his escape. He wasn\u2019t any weaker than the girl, but he needed to pick a better battlefield than that lake. The lakewater gave a huge boost to both the girl and her fish\u2019s combat strength, and he would be stupid to fight there. Not to mention that he didn\u2019t have the little chick with him, effectively making this a one versus two battle.\u201cYou buffoon! I am Jiang Yilin of the Lightning Manor, and both my father and uncle are respected members of the Lightning Manor! If you do not stop and return the manna right now, your whole family will suffer the consequences of your action!\u201d The girl threatened, seeing that all of the Six-Eyed Flying Fish\u2019s lunges had missed. Meanwhile, Li Tianming had already made it onto land.\u201cDo you think you are safe on land? I am at eighth level Beast Vein. Killing you is like squashing an ant!\u201d Jiang Yilin sneered as she too reached the shores. Behind her, her Six-Eyed Flying Fish had taken to the air. It could fly with its giant fins, so land or air combat was not an issue for it, just that it was not as strong as in water.\u201cHow dare you!\u201d Realising that words were not sufficient to make Li Tianming drop the manna, Jiang Yilin drew her Aqua Blood Longsword and dashed towards Li Tianming. She saw no point in convincing him when she could just kill him and take the manna from his corpse.Her sword flashed out rapidly, sending out fierce blasts of sword ki at Li Tianming.It was the Cascading Waterfall Sword Art! An advanced beast-ranked sword art, the move aimed to have sword ki raining down on her opponents as if they were standing under a waterfall.At the same time, the Six-Eyed Flying Fish used the beastial art version of the move, the \u2018Cascading Waterfall Strike\u2019. The spike on its head was as sharp as a beastial weapon, cutting through the air with enough speed to shatter a giant rock!Jiang Yilin was at eighth level Beast Vein \u2014 she was reaching the peak of the stage, and had power matching Liu Qianyang\u2019s. But Li Tianming had an abundance of Aeternal Infernal Beast Ki running in his body right now, thanks to the resources he obtained in the mountain, and was definitely up for a challenge.As usual, he held his Crimson Blood Dagger in his right hand, and his dark arm was clenched into a fist. After the previous fight, Li Tianming had gained a better understanding of his left arm that was covered with black hexagonal scales. If the pincers of the Blue-Tailed Scorpion couldn\u2019t even scratch its surface, it meant normal beastial weapons couldn\u2019t deal any damage to it, his own Crimson Blood Dagger included. With that, his dark arm could be used not only for dealing damage, but also for shielding him from most kinds of attacks.Things were looking rough for Li Tianming who had to take on the two of them at once, but he himself was confident of his strength on land! As the Six-Eyed Flying Fish swooped towards him, Li Tianming used his Ghost Steps to dodge the strike and dashed towards Jiang Yilin. The girl met him head-on without fear, as she had already prepared her Cascading Waterfall Sword Art, showering Li Tianming with a hail of sword ki.Li Tianming\u2019s expressions were as calm as ever, raising his left arm to block Jiang Yilin\u2019s Aqua Blood Longsword!Clang!The sound of metal clashing echoed through the forest. Li Tianming could barely feel any pain on his left arm, as if it was nothing but a bite from an ant. However the impact from the attack had traveled from his arm to the rest of his body, throwing him off balance momentarily. After all, that was a eighth level Beast Vein stage attack.However, Jiang Yilin was dumbfounded. She intended to cut off Li Tianming\u2019s arm, but to her shock it barely made a scratch! That was definitely enough to tear his arm off even if it was coated in metal!Alas, there wasn\u2019t enough time for her to figure out what had happened. Li Tianming had blocked her attack and was ready to strike back.\u201cIs that all you have? Then it\u2019s my turn now!\u201d In a fraction of a second, Li Tianming had launched his Bloody Soul Hunt, a move that could dominate anyone from the Beast Vein stage! All Jiang Yilin could see was a crimson flash blinking towards her, as she dodged as fast as she could. Even so, she felt a burning sensation on her rosy cheeks, the Crimson Blood Dagger scarring her face and slicing part of her hair off.\u201cYou bast\u2026\u201d Before she could curse Li Tianming, he had already punched his left fist out using Dragon-Mammoth Heavy Strike. She tried to block it with her palm, but her attempt was futile and the strike landed straight on her abdomen.BAM!Blood flew out in an arc, as her body got launched by the impact. But before the knockback could launch her backwards, Li Tianming had already grabbed her by the waist and spun her around. With her back towards him now, Li Tianming pointed the Crimson Blood Dagger at her throat and used her as a human shield.The Six-Eyed Flying Fish\u2019s Cascading Waterfall Strike was about to hit Li Tianming, but at this rate it would kill its own beastmaster first. With an awkward midair twist, the fish diverted its direction just in the nick of time. It then crash landed onto the ground, its sharp spike buried deep into the rocky surface of the mountain.The battle was over! At just sixth level Beast Vein, Li Tianming pulled off a one versus two with a landslide victory and even managed to hold Jiang Yilin hostage. He decided to be smart about it this time, considering how he let Zhang Zixuan go the previous time and ended in more trouble.\u201cYou have no idea what you are doing, plebian. You may be able to fight, but do you have any idea what Lightning Manor could do to you when they know that you injured me?\u201d Jiang Yilin hissed, her face still distorted from the pain in her abdomen.\u201cJust shut up already.\u201d With the Crimson Blood Dagger controlling her life and death in one hand, Li Tianming grabbed her jaws with the other. Jiang Feiling was not done cursing at him, but with her jaws being clenched she could only make weird gurgling noises.\u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u201d As expected, the two middle-aged men appeared before them. Both of them were staring at Li Tianming with intense killing intent. If he hadn\u2019t kidnapped Jiang Yilin, they would have shredded him to pieces already.\u201cBoy, you\u2019re still young, and you have no idea the power behind us. If you know about the Lightning Manor, you\u2019d be crying and begging for mercy by now.\u201d Jiang Yilin\u2019s father, Jiang Tao, spoke in a gravelly voice.\u201cNah, it\u2019s quite hard to make me cry.\u201d Li Tianming smiled.\u201cOh, then you may die now.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 23": "Chapter 23 - Fortune Is Found Amidst DangerPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayJust as the two were about to take action personally, a jade pendant appeared in Li Tianming\u2019s hand.\u201cThe royal clan\u2019s jade pendant! A green Vermilion Bird represents Princess Qing!\u201d Jiang Tao was stunned.Li Tianming had never closely inspected the pendant before this, and gave it a look. Indeed, there was a green Vermilion Bird on it. Supposedly, Vermilion Bird lifebound beasts were a truly noble bloodline, all six-stars at the minimum!\u201cI\u2019m Princess Qing\u2019s subordinate. Is there an issue with me taking this manna?\u201d Li Tianming asked. These people all didn\u2019t know who he was, which gave him leeway to play such tricks. It was quite effective. Someone who was \u2018Princess Qing\u2019s subordinate\u2019 would have impressive backgrounds themselves, and was definitely not some local bumpkin from around here.\u201cThat explains your combat strength.\u201d Jiang Tao gritted his teeth, but his eyes betrayed his uncertainty.\u201cI\u2019ve memorised your faces. If you dare fight over this manna with me, would you like to know what will happen when we return to Ignispolis?\u201d Li Tianming asked mildly.\u201cYoung sir, you must be joking. Our Lightning Manor would never dare. However, may I be so rude as to inquire about the identity of your father?\u201d Jiang Tao asked.\u201cMy dad? He\u2019s a big shot, you definitely know him.\u201d\u201cWhich expert may he be?\u201d\u201cTake a guess!\u201d Li Tianming waved the jade pendant dismissively and pushed Jiang Yilin out. \u201cGirls shouldn\u2019t be so violent, liking to kill and fight so much. Scandalous!\u201dJiang Yilin turned white with rage, but she didn\u2019t dare voice her discontent. After all, even her father feared that jade pendant.\u201cBye bye!\u201d Li Tianming swaggered off with the manna.\u201cDad, we can\u2019t let him go! What if that jade pendant was something he picked up!\u201d Jiang Yilin said urgently.\u201cImpossible. Princess Qing would never lose such an item. Only someone she values much would be bestowed the royal clan\u2019s pendant! How would that boy have never been afraid of us from start to end if he wasn\u2019t secure in his backing?\u201d\u201cSo what? We\u2019re going to let him walk away with our manna?\u201d Jiang Yilin said indignantly.\u201cWhat else? He was the one who snatched it from the Razor-Backed Colossal Crocodile after all.\u201d Although he was angry too, there was no way for him to vent.\u2026\u2026Soon after Li Tianming left, another three people rushed over to the lake\u2019s shore. The two parties exchanged a look.\u201cYou got the manna, Jiang Yilin?\u201d The speaker was a delicate and pretty young man riding on a Lightning Bolt Cheetah, which quickly positioned itself in front of Jiang Tao\u2019s group.\u201cHello, Uncle Jiang.\u201d The newcomer was Liu Qianyang. He blocked Jiang Yilin\u2019s path, but didn\u2019t forget to greet Jiang Tao.Along with him was Flamehaven governor Li Yanfeng, as well as his new wife, Liu Qing, holding hands together.\u201cWhy has Uncle Jiang shown himself in the open?\u201d Liu Qianyang asked, slightly dissatisfied. When the younger generations were fighting over manna, the elders shouldn\u2019t show their face and instead just protect them from the shadows.Jiang Tao already wasn\u2019t in any good mood after losing the manna. \u201cA variable has appeared. The manna was taken by an outsider.\u201d\u201cHow is that possible?\u201d Doubt flashed across Liu Qianyang\u2019s eyes.\u201cAn outsider? This is the wild as well as Flamehaven territory. Why would there be an outsider here?\u201d Li Yanfeng asked. They had come over after hearing the Razor-Backed Crocodile as well as Li Yanfeng had been aware that this lake was their destination. However, he hadn\u2019t expected to hear such a commotion just as he was about to arrive.\u201cIt was a young man who claimed he was Princess Qing\u2019s subordinate. He had obtained the manna from the lake and my daughter couldn\u2019t beat him. I was just about to take back the manna before making a final decision on how to handle this when he took out Princess Qing\u2019s pendant.\u201d Jiang Tao sighed.The other party had a strong background, and Lightning Manor\u2019s test for the younger generation this time round had ended up becoming a giveaway for outsiders. A senior of Lightning Manor had found the manna, but he hadn\u2019t taken action, leaving it to the juniors to fight over it.\u201cHow strong is he? What\u2019s his lifebound beast?\u201d Liu Qianyang\u2019s face was getting uglier by the moment. He had been determined to obtain the manna, and had feared no competitor. However, this conclusion was like a bucket of cold water poured on him.\u201cHe didn\u2019t use a lifebound beast. I suppose his cultivation would be roughly mine.\u201d Jiang Yilin kept her head lowered as she spoke.\u201cIf you don\u2019t believe us, chase in that direction. He just left.\u201d Jiang Tao suddenly cut in.\u201cThat so?\u201d Liu Qing and Li Yanfeng gave each other a quick glance. Seeing was believing after all, and the group of three hurriedly made their way in that direction.\u201cDad, why did you let them go? It\u2019s going to be troublesome if Liu Qianyang gets the manna.\u201d\u201cNo choice. We have to let them meet the young man. How else am I going to explain myself after this? If I have no one to back up my testimony, they may even believe I privately stashed away the manna.\u201d\u201cAnyway, if they snatch away the manna, that\u2019s offending the princess,\u201d said Jiang Yilin\u2019s uncle.Jiang Yilin nodded.\u201cI understand.\u201d\u201cHow is that young man\u2019s strength compared to Liu Qianyang?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s definitely weaker with Liu Qianyang, even if he didn\u2019t use his lifebound beast just now. Liu Qianyang has broken through to Spiritsource after all. The person just now relied on that strange armour on his left arm to beat me. His beast ki might have been scary as well, but it wasn\u2019t invincible.\u201d\u2026\u2026After leaving the lake, Li Tianming looped around to avoid being followed. Using the mysterious connection he shared with his lifebound beast, he felt the little chick approaching. The link also let them know each other was safe.The little chick appeared from the thicket, chortling. \u201cSo, bro, got the manna? I\u2019m telling you, I led that croc on a wild chicken chase this time. That lumbering thing couldn\u2019t even see the feathers on my tail!\u201d\u201cPipe down.\u201d Li Tianming hurriedly stopped him. He wasn\u2019t sure whether anyone was following after all. \u201cHow far did you lure the crocodile away?\u201d\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t take long to return to the lake. Why?\u201d\u201cI encountered people from Lightning Manor after obtaining the manna. I managed to get out using the princess\u2019 jade pendant.\u201d Li Tianming said thoughtfully.\u201cThen what are we waiting for? Let\u2019s skedaddle back to Flamehaven!\u201d The little chick was already salivating after seeing the manna.Li Tianming frowned. \u201cIf we leave like this and you refine the manna, we\u2019re not going to have a chance to look at that well again. Let\u2019s go back to it. Fortune is found amidst danger.\u201dLi Tianming wasn\u2019t quite ready to give up on the well despite the circumstances.He had met up with the little chick, the Razor-Backed Colossal Crocodile had yet to return and Jiang Yilin\u2019s group was probably no longer hanging around. All the cards seemed to line up nicely for a chance.\u201cMy third eye has an advantage inside the lake. As long as we go in, I don\u2019t think they can find us.\u201d\u201cThen let\u2019s go, go, go! This is exciting!\u201d It really didn\u2019t know what fear was. It too wanted to see if the manna could open the well.After making a giant loop back to the lake to avoid being followed, they discovered the crocodile indeed still wasn\u2019t back, while no one was around anymore. They quickly dived in. The lake was huge and their entry caused no disturbance.But just as they entered, Li Tianming noticed a youth riding a Lightning Bolt Cheetah appear at the shore. \u201cLiu Qianyang.\u201dLi Tianming watched him, but he definitely didn\u2019t notice Li Tianming.Then, Li Yanfeng and Liu Qing appeared. The bewitching beauty was dressed in tight fitting clothes that showed off her curvaceous figure. Red Twill Mountain itself already had a hot climate, and her appearance only added to it.\u201cWe didn\u2019t find Princess Qing\u2019s subordinate. Did Jiang Yilin point us in the wrong direction?\u201d Liu Qianyang said irritably.\u201cPossibly.\u201d They had returned to try and ask Jiang Yilin more questions, but they were no longer around.Li Tianming thanked the heavens that he had made a loop and made a narrow escape, or else he would have been caught.Then, something more fun happened. At this moment, on the far side of the lake, the Razor-Backed Colossal Crocodile happened to make its way back at this moment, and it immediately noticed the manna\u2019s absence.Alas, the Lightning Bolt Cheetah Liu Qianyang was riding was both a first-rate and large beast. It instantly aroused the crocodile\u2019s ire, which bellowed as it charged into the lake, leaving a spray of foam in its wake as it blitzed towards the cheetah!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 24": "Chapter 24 - Identity Exposed!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe Razor-Backed Colossal Crocodile\u2019s return was nothing but a pleasant surprise for Li Tianming. The more ruckus it caused, the safer he would be. The Razor-Backed Colossal Crocodile had identified Liu Qianyang as the thief, and was ready to tear him into pieces. As for Li Tianming, he was safely hidden in the lake where no one could find him.The Lightning Manor had intended the Razor-Backed Colossal Crocodile to be part of the trial too. Thus, Li Yanfeng couldn\u2019t interfere with the battle. As such, Liu Qianyang was in for a rough fight.\u201cHa! Sucks to be him!\u201d The commotion outside was getting louder, but that didn\u2019t stop Li Tianming from diving deeper into the lake. Having been to the well once, he didn\u2019t take long to find it this time.Ignoring the commotion above the lake, Li Tianming produced the manna from his pocket, and inserted it directly into the keyhole.Clack! The manna fitted into the keyhole perfectly with a crisp sound. The manna was indeed the key to open this well!\u201cWhat\u2019s gonna happen next?\u201d The little chick was curious.Li Tianming was equally curious, but he didn\u2019t lower his guard. For all he knew, the well may contain monstrosities beyond his imagination.Moments later, a slit appeared in the middle of the slate, opening up rapidly to reveal the well\u2019s interior. A moment later, Li Tianming saw a pitch black vortex at the bottom of the well, and before he could react, the vortex had sucked him into the well and devoured him completely!Seconds later, the slate closed back up, sealing the well as if nothing had ever happened here. Yet Li Tianming had completely vanished, gone from the world. As long as he didn\u2019t leave the well, he would have plenty of time to refine the manna.\u2026...\u201cSis, save me!\u201d Liu Qianyang was almost in tears. The Razor-Backed Colossal Crocodile was determined to hunt him and his lifebound beast down, and it was close to achieving its goals. The Lightning Bolt Cheetah had borne the brunt of the crocodile\u2019s wrath, its body covered in blood from the scratches by the crocodile\u2019s blades.\u201cI think we have to step in.\u201d Liu Qing\u2019s heart ached when she saw her brother being destroyed by the Razor-Backed Colossal Crocodile. According to the Lightning Manor\u2019s rules, the moment the two stepped in, their disciples would be disqualified. That was why they had refrained from helping unless it was absolutely necessary.\u201cHmm.\u201d Li Yanfeng nodded. As the leader of Flamehaven, he was a reputable master from the southern borders of Vermilion Bird after all, and his level of cultivation was unmatched in the region. The Razor-Backed Colossal Crocodile was no different from a chickling before his power.Li Yanfeng pointed out his finger, and a flicker of white flame appeared on his thumb. With a flicking motion, the white flame shot towards the Razor-Backed Colossal Crocodile, piercing through its head. The crocodile was still chasing after the Lightning Bolt Cheetah when it got hit by the flame and collapsed on the spot, its body still sliding forward due to its momentum.Even before its body came to a complete halt, the white flame was spreading from its skull to the rest of its body, engulfing the beast with flame in seconds. A minute later, the three-star wildbeast was completely wiped off from the face of the planet. Strangely, the flora and fauna around it was perfectly fine, as if the white flame could not hurt them at all.\u201cYanfeng, that was awesome! Wow you really are so strong.\u201d Liu Qing exclaimed.\u201cPiece of cake. I will go search for that \u2018Princess Qing\u2019s subordinate\u2019, you focus on healing Qianyang for now.\u201d After instructing the two on what to do, Li Yanfeng turned and left. Before this, he was reluctant to use his power to find the person as it was against the rules. But now that he had already killed the Razor-Backed Colossal Crocodile, he might as well forget about the rules and find the thief.\u201cI think it\u2019s fine if you interfere. The rules were meant for the disciples of Lightning Manor, and since it was an outsider that took it, we can decide on our next course of action after snatching it back.\u201d Liu Qing suggested,\u201cAlright.\u201d Li Yanfeng was confident of his capabilities. But there was no way he could have imagined that it was Li Tianming who robbed them of their manna.\u201cSister, we cannot let this person run. This is my only chance!\u201d Liu Qianyang cried as he stared at his blood stained lifebound beast.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, your brother-in-law will get that person.\u201d\u2026\u2026It took Li Yanfeng a couple of hours to return, and even then his expressions were stern.\u201cYanfeng, where\u2019s the person?\u201d Liu Qing questioned.\u201cGone.\u201d Li Yanfeng was clearly unhappy with the results as well.\u201cHow could that be? Don\u2019t you know every crook and cranny of Red Twill Mountain? You can\u2019t even find a teenager hiding here?\u201d Liu Qianyang\u2019s voice was filled with bitterness, as he yelled at Li Yanfeng in disbelief. What about his manna?!\u201cCalm down!\u201d Liu Qing gave her brother a fierce stare. Liu Qianyang was losing his mind over the manna, and if he knew that the person who took it was hiding right in the lake beside them, he would probably puke blood on the spot.\u201cI have searched everywhere, and I couldn\u2019t find this person. He must be quite good at hiding.\u201d Li Yanfeng narrowed his eyes. \u201cEither that, or Jiang Tao made this person up to trick us.\u201d\u201cHe won\u2019t dare to, he\u2019s not the type to play dirty and break the rules.\u201d Liu Qing shook her head.Hearing the conversation, Liu Qianyang got even more agitated. \u201cThen stop wasting time here and keep searching!\u201dNot only did they find the manna or the person who took it, he also got a beating from the crocodile. Liu Qianyang was holding grudges against his brother-in-law by now.\u201cFind Jiang Tao and Jiang Yilin, and we can ask him what that young man looks like.\u201d Li Yanfeng came to a final conclusion.\u201cFine.\u201d Liu Qing agreed, as the three of them reluctantly left to find the other groups.\u2026\u2026In half a day\u2019s time, Li Yanfeng met up with Jiang Tao\u2019s group again. Following a series of arguments, the three of them had no choice but to believe that there were indeed a \u2018Princess Qing\u2019s subordinate\u2019 around who took the manna and eluded Li Yanfeng\u2019s capture.A day later, the six of them ran into another family of three, consisting of the Zhang Chong couple and Zhang Zixuan.\u201cWhat\u2019s with that sulky look, who got the manna?\u201d Zhang Chong could tell that something went wrong.\u201cThe manna was located in \u2018Mirror Lake\u2019 atop that hill, guarded by a three-star Razor-Backed Colossal Crocodile. By the time we reached it, a random boy had already taken it away.\u201dZhang Chong was flabbergasted. \u201cA random boy? Even if our younger ones couldn\u2019t overcome him, why don\u2019t y\u2019all just take it back? How can you let a stranger touch our Lightning Manor\u2019s treasure!\u201d\u201cThat boy had Princess Qing\u2019s jade pendant, do you dare to touch the princess\u2019s subordinate?\u201d Jiang Tao rolled his eyes.\u201cPrincess Qing!\u201d Zhang Zixuan gasped.\u201cDid you see Princess Qing around?\u201d Surprised by Zhang Zixuan\u2019s reaction, the six clueless members stared at him anxiously.\u201cYes we did, and what did you say? A young boy, with Princess Qing\u2019s jade pendant?\u201d Zhang Chong was in shock too.\u201cDo you know that person?\u201d Li Yanfeng inquired.\u201cHere\u2019s the story: A few days ago, we ran into this boy...\u201d Zhang Chong briefly explained the dispute between Li Tianming and Zhang Zixuan.\u201cAfter Princess Qing brought the boy away, she even gave him the jade pendant? What\u2019s so special about the boy for the princess to treat him so well?\u201d Zhang Chong was still trying to fully comprehend what had happened.\u201cHave you all seen this boy? Are there special any features about him? Or could he really just be a plebian from nearby?\u201d Li Yanfeng\u2019s brows were twisted into a single line.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to describe what he looks like.\u201d Jiang Yilin\u2019s group had run into the boy too.\u201cHe has a little chick as a lifebound beast. A tiny yellow one.\u201d Zhang Zixuan supplemented with more details that he could remember.\u201cWhat!\u201d The Li Yanfeng trio jumped up in shock. A month ago, a particular little chick had left them a strong impression, and it was quite impossible to find another lifebound beast as special as that one.\u201cAre. You. Sure?\u201d Liu Qianyang was breathing heavily, his face as red as an apple. \u201cDescribe his looks in greater detail.\u201dJiang Tao and Zhang Chong each took their turn to describe the young man, and they came to a conclusion as all the information came together.\u201cLi Tianming, it must be him! Li Tianming!\u201d Liu Qianyang could not understand, how someone that he had despised so much could possibly spoil his plan and ruin his trip to the Red Twill Mountain!\u201cIsn\u2019t he just at seventh level Beast Vein? How did he defeat Zixuan and Yilin then?\u201d Liu Qing was still doubtful, despite all the evidence that was pointing towards the truth.\u201cHe reached Spiritsource before, and has some degree of battle experience. He must have used some tricks to get the manna.\u201d Li Yanfeng stared into the distance. His mind had went blank momentarily when he heard that name earlier on, and even now, his voice was still a lot coarser. Li Tianming, his own son, coming to spoil his plans again and again!He had already promised Liu Qianyang to get the manna for him, but Li Tianming was here to disturb him yet again. If Li Tianming managed to get the manna, what would Liu Qianyang think of his brother-in-law then? A governor that let his own son ruin his plans not once, but twice?\u201cWhat\u2019s next?\u201d Liu Qianyang was so pissed off that he couldn\u2019t even control the disappointment in his voice.\u201cHe will eventually return to Flamehaven, and when that happens we just have to stop him halfway. Rest assured, he is the last person I will hand the manna over to,\u201d Li Yanfeng hissed, looking towards Flamehaven\u2019s direction.\u201cWhy would he return if he had gotten the manna?\u201d Liu Qianyang tossed out the question that the rest of the crew had in mind as well.Li Yanfeng did not respond to that. He had no intention to tell them that the sickly Wei Jing was still in Flamehaven and Li Tianming needed to pick his mother up.\u201cDid you mention that this boy used a blood pact to get himself a one-star wildbeast?\u201d Jiang Tao asked.\u201cThat is correct.\u201d\u201cThen there\u2019s nothing to worry about. No one-star lifebound beast could refine a manna. This boy\u2019s efforts are futile.\u201dThat sentence made Liu Qianyang a lot calmer.\u201cEven if we don\u2019t find him on the way back, he will make his way back to Flamehaven within a week\u2019s time.\u201d Li Yanfeng finally managed to appease the group, bringing the discussion to an end.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 25": "Chapter 25 - Great Fortune: Godsoul Canon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLi Tianming tumbled downwards after being sucked in by the black vortex. \u201cWhere am I?\u201d He immediately scrambled to his feet to find himself inside a chamber. The chamber was surrounded on four sides by black walls, while the stone ground was also particularly sturdy. However, the ceiling had a bronze passageway \u2014 it was likely to be the well.\u201cI should be below the well.\u201d Li Tianming examined his surroundings. He found a grand total of two items in the hidden chamber. One was the manna that had fallen in with him, while the other seemed to be a sphere made of flawless white jade, giving off luminescence.It was thanks to the sphere that the chamber wasn't cast in complete darkness.\u201cKnow what this is?\u201d Li Tianming summoned Ying Huo out of his lifebound space. There was definitely something strange about the sphere, so he didn\u2019t dare act too rash.\u201cThere\u2019s something here?\u201d The little chick circled one round around the sphere. \u201cYep, a strange thing alright. Hand me the manna, I\u2019m itching to get on with it!\u201d\u201cRight here?\u201d\u201cWhere else? Your father\u2019s still outside. Who knows if they\u2019ll start coming in later.\u201d The little chick rolled its eyes.The process of manna refinement would primarily be executed by the lifebound beast. During the process, Li Tianming only had to stand guard. If it succeeded, the next time they cultivated, the lifebound beast\u2019s improved bloodline energy would remould the beastmaster.\u201cThey take me as a one-star lifebound beast, and definitely don\u2019t believe I can refine the manna. However, they definitely don\u2019t know that I\u2019m not evolving, just unlocking some bloodline shackles.\u201d The little chick said smugly.\u201cAlright, alright, stop bragging.\u201d Li Tianming handed it the manna. He heard that there were many variables that cropped up in refining manna, and the help of seniors in refining it was almost always a given. There were many incidents of failure throughout history, and some even resulted in death. As a rule of thumb, the younger generation would never try to do it alone. However, Li Tianming was not worried for this Aeternal Infernal Phoenix.The little chick was as excited as a child getting their favourite toy. \u201cWell, examine the sphere first. I\u2019ll start if there\u2019s nothing else.\u201dLi Tianming also couldn\u2019t wait and started to examine the sphere impatiently.\u201cThe well uses that manna as a key. If there\u2019s only this white jade sphere inside, its value must be several times the manna,\u201d Li Tianming mused.\u201cWell, that\u2019s going to depend on whether you\u2019re fated with it!\u201dLi Tianming nodded. He mentally prepared himself as he reached out to the sphere. It was cool to the touch, but he didn\u2019t feel any sense of rejection.He raised the sphere to eye level. It was flawless without any markings, no matter what angle he inspected it from. It only seemed to be an ordinary jade without any oddities.Then, an eye appeared on the sphere without warning, gazing at him. Li Tianming immediately felt the world spinning and melting away, leaving him dizzy. In the next instant, he was transported to a world filled with only white light. Innumerable people seemed to be talking around him from all directions.\u201cOf within the Wondersky Realm, I reign as absolute sovereign; From within the great unknown, hereward I beckon you forth!\u201d A voice suddenly boomed out and filled the world, each word thundering in Li Tianming\u2019s mind.There were two pieces of info implicit in this message. First, the message itself definitely came from the owner of the sphere. He called himself the absolute sovereign of the Wondersky Realm. Unfortunately, Li Tianming had never heard of that place. The second portion was more incoherent. What did he mean he had beckoned Li Tianming forth from within the great unknown?He had come for clear spirit grass, then had come to know of the manna through Jiang Feiling. He found out about the well through his black arm. How was he led here in any way?\u201cYoung man, when you cultivate Godsoul Canon to the level of Skypolarity Eye, the spirit core shall truly open. The path to the Wondersky Realm shall be established, and you may seek my legacy thereward!\u201dAnd there it was, another bamboozling string of words.However, he guessed the \u2018spirit core\u2019 referred to the sphere and the eye on it.Suddenly, a golden mist coalesced in front of him, which reformed into golden words.\u201cFirst stage of Godsoul Canon, the Bewildering Eye.\u201d Li Tianming read out loud. The golden script was too long and complex, but every word he recited was indelibly etched into his mind, never to be forgotten. It took him a minute to parse through it all.\u201cWhen the Bewildering Eye is mastered, the Godsoul Canon\u2019s second stage can be learnt.\u201dLi Tianming was still confused, and when he shook his head to clear it, he realised that white world was gone. He was back in the hidden chamber with the white jade sphere, but the eye from before was gone.Ying Huo stared at him.\u201cWhat happened, why did you suddenly start reciting some scripture?\u201dLi Tianming took a while to respond. He examined the white sphere for a long while. Its glow was starting to dim, but nothing he did elicited any further reaction. The inheritance had ended, and perhaps only when Li Tianming made some accomplishments in the Godsoul Canon would there be a reaction.\u201cDo you know somewhere called the Wondersky Realm?\u201d\u201cNope.\u201d\u201cI think I got some good fortune.\u201d\u201cWhat kind?\u201d\u201cOne called the \u2018Godsoul Canon\u2019. It seems to be the technique of illusion-type beast masters.\u201d Li Tianming said.Illusion-type lifebound beasts were a rare breed, all of high rank. Supposedly, Liu Qing was one of those rare beastmasters who possessed one. These abilities to cast illusions were impossible to guard against, and in battle, they could be used to confuse the opponent or even take control of them.\u201cWell, then try it. I\u2019ll see how you fare when I\u2019m done with this.\u201d The manna refining had already started, but the process still needed some time.Since it was going to take a while, Li Tianming took a seat, planning to examine the Godsoul Canon\u2019s first stage, Bewildering Eye. \u201cThis is a technique, not a battle art.\u201dIllusion-type beast masters also had their own illusion-type battle arts, but the Godsoul Canon wasn\u2019t one of them. Illusion-type battle arts were based on the foundation of being an illusion-type beast master to use, and ordinary people couldn\u2019t use it.The Godsoul Canon worked by transfiguring the eye to make one become an illusionary-type beastmaster. Such outrageous techniques would be called secret techniques.Techniques had two kinds. Apart from secret techniques, there were the more standard cultivation techniques like the Darkgold Technique and Aeternal Infernal Codex.Cultivation techniques helped convert the spiritual energy of heaven and earth into beast ki, make breakthroughs, form the spiritsource and so on. It was the fundamentals, even more important than battle arts. Li Tianming had heard of some specially created secret techniques that could be added onto the base system of cultivation techniques. Today, Li Tianming found one, one that didn\u2019t conflict with the Aeternal Infernal Phoenix at all, the Godsoul Canon.He began to practice it.\u201cScary, scary! The idea is to establish \u2018illusion-type spirit veins\u2019 in the eye to let beast ki flow through. They\u2019re tiny and they need to cover the whole eye. A slight failure could very well lead to your eye being kaput!\u201d\u201cThe Bewildering Eye needs you to establish a whole eighty-one illusion-type spirit veins in an eye. This kind of thing that needs such delicate work is very dangerous. Those without special eyes basically have no chance of mastering it.\u201d\u201cBut success would lead to the eye becoming a Bewildering Eye. It can still cast illusionary effects even if you\u2019re not an illusion-type beastmaster. It may even be stronger than one! It\u2019s already so complicated. I wonder what stage the Skypolarity Eye that can make the spirit core open the Wondersky Realm is?\u201dLi Tianming had a premonition that this was a huge windfall. If he could master it well, it would lead to untold benefits. \u201cI wonder how it compares to my Saintbeast War-Soul?\u201dHis sixth sense told him the spirit core wasn\u2019t worth any less.\u201cFrom within the great unknown, huh?\u201d Li Tianming felt so many things still felt unknown and mysterious to him. His meeting with Jiang Feiling felt like one of them. He really did have some belief that he had obtained this spirit core not just through luck, but also through its owner\u2019s beckoning.\u201cLet\u2019s begin!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 26": "Chapter 26 - Back to Flamehaven!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe first step of Bewildering Eye was to establish eighty-one illusion-type spirit veins in the eyes. Each had their own unique shape and would criss-cross with the others. The order and speed of establishment was mightily important.Li Tianming failed the moment he started on the first. Blood began leaking the moment beast ki poured into the eyeball, bringing unspeakable pain.\u201cWas this even made for humans?\u201d Li Tianming couldn\u2019t help being suspicious. Bewildering Eye had over ten thousand words to its technique, but the first line alone had left him like this. He might as well just give up on the rest.His right eye was in incredible pain and wouldn\u2019t be able to withstand a second try. If he forced it, only blindness would follow. Even with his decent toughness, he had nearly lost his right eye and his entire body was shivering in pain.Li Tianming realised it wasn\u2019t him not being hard-working enough, but just a matter of lacking talent. Why did the spirit core\u2019s owner believe he could succeed his legacy and lure him here?\u201cAnd here I was, thinking I had picked up some super duper badass technique.\u201d Li Tianming was a little gloomy, but at that moment, he caught sight his bandaged left arm.\u201cHow did I forget about that eye!\u201d His original eyes might be talentless, but that eye on the black arm was miraculous! It could see clearly in the murky depths of the lake, which meant that that eye may have been the specific thing that was beckoned forth from within the unknown!He immediately went ahead with attempting the method to run beast ki through his third eye. He had exercised his full caution, but the result left him questioning his worldview. \u201cI guess hard work is a joke in the face of absolute talent after all.\u201dThis technique, which his original eyes had failed utterly at, had succeeded with absurd ease when it came to his third eye. He hadn\u2019t even familiarised himself with the latter portions, but the process went smoothly without a hitch. He had the feeling even if he closed his eyes while doing it, nothing would go wrong. And thus, the process finished.Li Tianming looked at that eye and could clearly make out the spirit veins slowly forming. Just like a human body, the eye now had its personal cultivation system. Li Tianming\u2019s body had six beast veins opened, while this tiny eye had eighty-one spirit veins. Despite their little size, however, their strength and intricacy was nothing to sneeze at.The eye had been completely transfigured, the effect like giving a strong man a sharp weapon. The analogy was apt, as Li Tianming\u2019s two original eyes were like babies. Giving it a supreme-grade beastial weapon wasn\u2019t going to accomplish much. The third eye however, was a strong man that had been bestowed a weapon and cultivation techniques. This combination would only get stronger and stronger.Now that the spirit veins had been established, the next step was its cultivation. The properties of the Bewildering Eye would be adhered to it bit by bit. The power would be unleashed through eyesight as a medium to affect the enemy.\u201cThis left arm really is outrageous.\u201d He had made some mistakes just now during the spirit vein establishment, which had hurt the eye, but he had felt it quickly recover from it, proof of its outstanding regenerative capabilities.\u201cIt really does feel like I'm starting to collect quite a few enigmas. Primordial Chaos Beasts, the black arm and now this spirit core.\u201d He really did feel a strong desire to unravel them, and even had a premonition it was his life\u2019s calling.\u2026\u2026The next five days were spent by him cultivating the Bewildering Eye and the little chick refining the manna. By then, he felt like he had the ability to confuse enemies just like an illusion-type beastmaster.The left arm would be of great assistance to him in battle. The Bewildering Eye, powerful physical strength and defense\u2026 and more that he needed to unearth.\u201cSuccess!\u201d A fireball in the hidden chamber let out an excited whoop. As it dispersed, a mighty aura pressed down.Li Tianming was looking forward to it. Ying Huo\u2019s appearance now was too cute and dumb, lacking the slightly gravitas. It\u2019ll only be cool if it reverted to being an Aeternal Infernal Phoenix.The fire was gone. And thus, Li Tianming\u2019s expectant gaze fell on a tender and yellow little chick...\u201cDamn!\u201d Li Tianming was speechless as he looked at the practically unchanged little chick. \u201cAre you sure you evolved? Why do you still look\u2026 you?\u201d\u201cWhat kind of tone is that! Can you judge an evolution by its appearance?\u201d The little chick snapped.\u201cThen? I was promised more badassery! More domineering! What the heck, it\u2019s still the same ole chicken!\u201d Li Tianming snorted disdainfully.\u201cYou're just narrow-minded and judging a book by its cover!\"Actually, Li Tianming had noticed its eyes seemed to have six stars now. To an outsider, they would think a six-star lifebound beast was already a premier expert\u2019s beast.\u201cLi Tianming, you just don\u2019t know my limits. Such lousy manna can only barely just loosen my bloodline shackles. We need far more manna for me to become a phoenix. Of course, even the current me isn\u2019t something a six-star lifebound beast can compare with,\u201d the little chick said arrogantly.The six stars in its eye in fact weren\u2019t an indicator of its potential, but just a symbol of its bloodline shackles opening. Of course, its bloodline energy now was stronger than before. That was the purpose of manna. The Aeternal Infernal Phoenix didn\u2019t need it to evolve, but to recover.\u201cCome, come, let grandpappy show you how awesome my bloodline energy is now,\u201d Ying Huo said pretentiously.The first time they had cultivated together, Li Tianming had been given an Aeternal Infernal Body. Any improvement in Ying Huo\u2019s bloodline would be reflected in him as well. It was an innate skill of lifebound beasts and beastmasters, where their beast ki was mutually shared during cultivation, allowing Ying Huo\u2019s new bloodline energy to transfer to him.\u201cIncredible!\u201d Li Tianming could feel both his body\u2019s power and his talent skyrocketing. The majestic bloodline energy crashed down onto Li Tianming like a waterfall. He got stronger and stronger, approaching the power of a true Primordial Chaos Beast. Others could only dream of such transformations in their lifetime. The burning energy that continued to course through him even ignited the remaining medicinal dregs of the fire lingzhi mushroom the two had eaten.They began to edge towards the seventh level Beast Vein.Then the next day, man and chick hit the seventh level together! The magma-like Aeternal Infernal Beast Ki coursed through the thick dragon-like veins of the two, turning them into something like erupting volcanoes.The effect was especially pronounced for Li Tianming. His Bewildering Eye turned even stranger as beast ki circulated through the spirit veins inside.\u201cWith all the gains we made, the two of us are like whole new people compared to before we came in.\u201d\u201cTry out your Bewildering Eye!\u201d Ying Huo challenged.\u201cOn you?\u201d Li Tianming chuckled. Truth be told, he did want a guinea pig.\u201cTry me, you nugget!\u201d the little chick mocked.Li Tianming removed his glove just enough to show the Bewildering Eye, but not enough to reveal the whole arm. Then he abruptly pointed it at the little chick.Li Tianming operated it according to the technique, activating the eye. Ying Huo\u2019s eyes widened slightly as it froze up, staggering back as it looked foolishly at Li Tianming.Success!Li Tianming grinned. If this happened in battle, it would present many openings to exploit.\u201cMy goodness, you do make quite the sexy hen!\u201d Ying Huo rolled around on the ground, unable to contain his laughter.\u201cWhat?\u201d Li Tianming was confused. When he used the Bewildering Eye, he turned into a sexy hen? How was that possible?He was uncertain if he could use the eye on himself, so he pointed his left hand at himself and activated it. He felt his vision blur.The next moment, he saw his left arm turn into an alluring beauty. She had features reminiscent of Jiang Feiling as well as a figure even better than Liu Qing. She played with her hair coquettishly, looking at him invitingly...\u201cAHHHH!\u201d Li Tianming flinched in pure terror. What kind of godforsaken technique was this? It was all well and good to be an illusion technique, so why did it have to go be some seduction technique?!\u201cAhahaha!\u201dHow humiliating.Still, if he used the hand when fighting against Liu Qianyang and transformed into a beauty, that would give him the chance to\u2026 hmm, win.It was time to go back for his Flameyellow Order. His mother must have been anxious after he was gone for so long. \u201cLi Yanfeng, Liu Qianyang, I\u2019m coming back to Flamehaven!\u201d It was time for the final battle!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 27": "Chapter 27 - Trying To Gang Up on Me?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayHalcyon Hotel saw pretty good business most days, its three floors packed with customers. But things were different for them today, as there was only a small group of customers on the third floor.They were no ordinary customers, but reputable guests from the Lightning Manor of Ignispolis! The hotel staff were informed that the governor and his wife were personally accompanying these guests, and officials from Flamehaven were not even allowed to enter the building. That was enough to suggest how important these guests were.In the past few days, all the households around the region have been ordered to vacate. No one knew why the governor wanted to empty out the area, nor did they understand what the group was waiting for. A curious crowd had gathered a few hundred meters away from the hotel, interested to see what would unfold in the coming days.Even more peculiar was the fact that those eminent figures all seem to be staring at the same place, a dilapidated courtyard not far away from the hotel. If anyone were to walk into the courtyard now, they would find nothing but an elderly lady lying on a lawn bench in the garden, dozing off in the gentle sunlight. She was enjoying the final remaining days of her life, just like what she had been doing for the past few days.Li Yanfeng would occasionally throw a peek at the courtyard too, before quickly diverting his attention somewhere else. For now, he had Liu Qing\u2019s delicate hand in his and a faint smile on his face.\u201cToday is the seventh day, and that guy still hasn't returned. Did he die in Red Twill Mountain?\u201d Liu Qianyang was seated at one side, more agitated than ever.\u201cHe still retained part of his strength from three years ago, so it\u2019s quite unlikely he\u2019d die there.\u201d Jiang Yilin, the girl that got defeated by Li Tianming back in the mountain, was seated beside Liu Qianyang. In fact, all seven Lightning Manor contestants were seated together. True to their roots, every single one of them had a gallant look.At one side, the two local talents, Li Zifeng and Li Xuejiao could only hide in one corner, their abilities paling in comparison with the seven.Other than the seven youths, their parents and guardians were there as well. They had a sour look, considering that they have been doing nothing but looking at the old lady snooze in her lawn chair for seven days.\u201cLi Tianming is not back yet. Could it be\u2026 that his lifebound beast managed to refine the manna?\u201d Zhang Zixuan mumbled anxiously.\u201cWe have ruled out that possibility. The lifebound beast he obtained using a blood pact is just one-star.\u201d\u201cThe blood flowing in an one-star lifebound beast is way too feeble to handle the strength of the manna. Let alone the fact that he has no seniors there to help him regulate this power.\u201d\u201cEven if Li Tianming could fight, it\u2019s totally because of his past experiences with his previous lifebound beast.\u201d The other youths chattered on. The four of them have never seen Li Tianming before, but they heard enough from the rest of the group.\u201cThe only thing we have to deal with is the jade pendant. At least we know the governor won\u2019t be helping him.\u201d Jiang Yilin stated.\u201cI don\u2019t understand, why would Princess Qing give him, a useless piece of trash who can\u2019t go past the Beast Vein stage, her personal jade pendant?\u201d Liu Qianyang spat. He hated Li Tianming for taking away the manna that was rightfully his. To think that back at Zephyr Tower, he barely gave a hoot about Li Tianming, but now that pest was back to give him such a headache.\u201cWe have already received approval from Lightning Manor. The moment Li Tianming returns, the first one who takes him down gets the manna.\u201d\u201cAs long as us parents do not get involved and all the fighting is done by the young ones, the manor will help us settle Princess Qing\u2019s side.\u201d\u201cAfter all, it was the Lightning Manor that found the manna first, and if Li Tianming wanted to take it he\u2019d better fight for it.\u201d\u201cSurely the princess can\u2019t complain if our kids take the manna from Li Tianming by defeating him.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t overestimate Li Tianming. If he really had connections with Princess Qing, he won\u2019t end up like a cripple in the first place,\u201d Zhang Zixuan scoffed.At those words, Li Zifeng and Li Xuejiao couldn\u2019t help but shake their heads. It was a cruel world for those who were abandoned. While the youths from Lightning Manor were discussing what to do with Li Tianming, his own father had no reaction and was instead all lovey dovey with his new wife.\u201cOur only worry now is if this guy took the manna and went to find Princess Qing instead. Then all our waiting will be in vain.\u201d Zhang Zixuan said.\u201cThat\u2019s not possible.\u201d Liu Qianyang shook his head.\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cFirstly, he is a filial son. And secondly, he wanted the Flameyellow Order to return to Flameyellow Scions Institute, in order to take revenge on brother Ting.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d The seven youths stared at each, before bursting into laughter unanimously.\u201cRevenge? On brother Ting?\u201d\u201cHaha! Why doesn\u2019t he take a good look in the mirror to see that stupid face of his? Even three years ago, he was nothing compared to brother Ting!\u201d\u201cHelp, I\u2019m laughing so hard right now!\u201dAmongst all the laughter, Zhang Chong suddenly stood up, a smile creeping up his face. The rest followed his line of sight and found a youth walking towards the hotel! He seemed to be a well-educated person, his look gracious and amiable. Perhaps the most special thing about him was the little chick chattering away on his shoulder.\u201cHis lifebound beast has not evolved!\u201d The group came to a quick conclusion. That means the manna had to still be with him!Their wait wasn\u2019t fruitless! The Lightning Manor\u2019s new rule was that whoever that snatched the manna from Li Tianming would be its owner. It also meant Li Tianming\u2019s appearance was the signal for the battle to begin.\u201cLook at that, the manna must be there!\u201d From afar they could see a bulge in Li Tianming's clothes. Little did they know that that was the Spirit Core he had obtained in the well.\u201cWhat are you waiting for, go!\u201d Jiang Tao stared at his own daughter. He didn\u2019t want her to miss this chance.Before he could finish his sentence, the seven youths had leapt off the third storey of the hotel. They needed to fight Li Tianming together, but deep down inside they knew only one person would get to keep the manna.A battle was about to begin!\u2026\u2026Li Yanfeng\u2019s brow was knitted since the boy\u2019s appearance. Li Tianming had arrived at the courtyard, and was only steps away from opening the gate when the seven youths halted him.\u201cYanfeng, are you feeling sad for him now?\u201d Liu Qing asked gently.Li Yanfeng shook his head. \u201cHe chose this fate for himself. It\u2019s nothing to do with me.\u201d\u201cHm, I\u2019m glad you\u2019d think this way. Once this is over, you can put aside the governor\u2019s job for a while and follow me to Lightning Manor. The Lightning Seigneur has already accepted you as part of the family, and will assign you a greater role.\u201d\u201cGot it.\u201d Li Yanfeng nodded his head. He had already fulfilled his mission, and he was only one step away from reaching out to his dreams. He would make sure of that, even if it means sacrificing his own son...\u2026\u2026Li Tianming had seen the people on the third floor of Halcyon Hotel long ago. All of them, his own father included, had a hawkish stance.\u201cHe knew I\u2019d be back, so he\u2019s here to stop me, and help the outsiders to get the manna?\u201d Li Tianming thought. But it wasn\u2019t that surprising, considering how Li Yanfeng had disappointed him time and time again, so he shrugged it off a moment later.The seven geniuses had him surrounded, and he was staring directly at Liu Qianyang too! Ultimately, one of his main goals for returning to Flamehaven was to take the Flameyellow Order back from Liu Qianyang. It has been a month since their deal, and he was ready for the battle.The Lightning Bolt Cheetah between Liu Qianyang\u2019s legs growled threateningly from its impatience, an action immediately mirrored by the six other beasts a second later.It was stated clearly in Flamehaven\u2019s laws that lifebound beasts were not allowed to battle inside the city. Therefore, the noises from the lifebound beasts had attracted many residents to peek from a distance. Coupled with those curious about the governor\u2019s reallocation order a few days back, a crowd had already gathered, ready for a good show. Even more would join them later, which was a good thing for Li Tianming.On the day of the selection, he had failed to properly prove himself. Now that he was surrounded by seven geniuses from Lightning Manor, it was his moment to shine! His blood was beginning to boil, and even the dark arm became so hot that anyone who touched it would be scalded.Aside from Liu Qianyang and his Lightning Bolt Cheetah, Li Tianming saw Zhang Zixuan with his Blue-Tailed Scorpion and Jiang Yilin with her Six-Eyed Flying Fish. The scorpion\u2019s eye seemed to have recovered a bit, which wasn\u2019t surprising considering the amount of resources and money the Lightning Manor had.Other than that, Li Tianming saw four other lifebound beasts, all of them five-star beasts like his Midas.\u201cTrying to gang up on me?!\u201d Li Tianming glared at the seven pairs with bloodshot eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 28": "Chapter 28 - One Against Seven!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayA variety of lifebound beasts surrounded Li Tianming right now. There was the Hurricane Swallow, a wind-type avian beast that was constantly surrounded by gusts of wind. The Rumble Rodent, a lightning-type terrestrial beast that excelled in attacking from the shadows. The Mythical Ice Bug, an ice-type bug beast that could freeze its opponents. And the last one was a steelclad-type beast known as the Steelclad Giant Shrimp, its armor impenetrable by many weapons.Against the seven lifebound beasts of different species and types, the little chick looked so powerless. How could it even stand a chance?Li Tianming was trapped by a circle of fourteen opponents all staring at him fervently. But why would they be so interested in him when he had already refined the manna?\u201cOhhh.\u201d He figured out the reason when he looked down and saw the spirit core in his pocket. So they thought that was the manna!\u201cLi Tianming, we hereby inform you that this manna is Lightning Manor\u2019s property. The manor has decided that even if you bear Princess Qing\u2019s jade pendant, you shall compete with the seven disciples to contest for the manna. Can you agree on that?\u201d Liu Qianyang was the first person to break the silence.\u201cOf course! Don\u2019t waste my time, the seven of you can come at me together.\u201d Li Tianming gladly accepted that condition. After all, he returned to Flamehaven today to fight for his pride, and to escort his mother away in dignity. One against seven? He had nothing to fear, and in fact, welcomed it!The disciples of Lightning Manor obviously saw this as an insult. As prodigies from the Lightning Manor of Ignispolis, they usually wouldn\u2019t even spare a second glance at people with such background.\u201cPretty cocky, huh.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t bother. He\u2019s always like this. He\u2019ll talk a big game, then run off like a coward.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t regret your choice. We were having difficulties deciding on the sequence anyway. From now on, whoever obtains the manna first wins!\u201d Zhang Zixuan proclaimed. His intention was to pick Li Tianming off after the rest had first weakened him, since he knew he couldn\u2019t beat Li Tianming.\u201cSorry, what did you say? How\u2019s your scorpion\u2019s eye?\u201d Li Tianming taunted, causing Zhang Zixuan\u2019s face to flush in fury.\u201cNo point squabbling, let\u2019s go.\u201d Liu Qianyang was already in a battle stance, confident that he would be the one to get the manna as the strongest out of the seven.\u201cLiu Qianyang, is our deal from a month ago still on? Or are you too scared to hand me the Flameyellow Order if you lose?\u201d Li Tianming\u2019s eyes locked onto Liu Qianyang.\u201cA promise is a promise. And when you lose, you better hand over the manna!\u201d Liu Qianyang replied, dashing towards Li Tianming. He knew that he had an advantage over the other six contestants, which was the Flameyellow Order that Li Tianming desired. Because of that, Li Tianming would definitely focus on him and then he could easily defeat that fool to get the manna!The moment Liu Qianyang made a move, the other six immediately followed suit. They were all competitors who didn\u2019t plan to let Liu Qianyang get the manna that easily. And from Li Tianming\u2019s perspective, it was much easier for him to deal with seven enemies that were like loose sand.\u201cFirst, don\u2019t disturb mother\u2019s rest. Second, it\u2019ll be good to let more people know who\u2019s the real winner of the Flameyellow Selection! And finally, I\u2019ll trample those Lightning Manor geniuses, and make Li Yanfeng regret his choice!\u201dEver since that fateful day, Li Tianming\u2019s goal had never changed. He wanted to get the Flameyellow Order, to walk out of the Flamehaven in dignity with Li Yanfeng personally sending them off. It had been three years, and Li Tianming had enough of being a loser.With a clear goal in mind, Li Tianming used his Ghost Steps to break out of the siege. Another few swift steps brought him up a rooftop, whereupon he dashed towards Halcyon Hotel. This was too far away from Li Yanfeng and Li Tianming wanted to fight directly on top of the hotel where Li Yanfeng had front row seats.\u201cHe\u2019s escaping!\u201d\u201cQuickly, chase him!\u201dMan and chick were chased by seven pairs of beastmasters and lifebound beasts on top of the city district. Some of the beasts like the Lightning Bolt Cheetah were so destructive that any roofs they launched themselves off crumbled instantly, even causing one building to collapse. It wasn\u2019t long before they reached the Halcyon Hotel, the tallest building in the area. Ignoring the group of adults in the hotel, Li Tianming hopped onto the roof of the hotel.\u201cJust what is he thinking!\u201d The group of seniors were all puzzled by his behavior.The seven geniuses caught up a minute later and positioned themselves on the roof. The roof was both wide enough to function as an arena and also tall enough to be viewed by close to half of Flamehaven! It was clear to the spectators that it was him, Li Tianming, taking on seven geniuses of the Lightning Manor alone!\u201cGood enough.\u201d Li Tianming could feel the power flowing through his black arm as he clenched his fist. In his right hand, the hideous Crimson Blood Dagger\u2019s sharp tip glowed a bloody red.Li Tianming focused on his seven opponents, his eyes ablaze with fury. The seven of them had tried to interfere and even attack each other during the chase. As the strongest contestant, Liu Qianyang even had to deal with four of his peers. After all, it was allowed by the rules for the six of them to eliminate Liu Qianyang first before taking Li Tianming on!\u201cThey think it\u2019s a game with seven hunters, and me being the only prey! But is that really the case?\u201d Li Tianming could feel that his Aeternal Infernal Beast Ki was even stronger than normal beast ki at ninth level Beast Vein. He was almost, if not just, as powerful as himself three years ago!\u201cLet\u2019s do this.\u201dAfter dodging a few attacks, Li Tianming\u2019s icy cold gaze found its first victim, Zhang Zixuan. The boy who claimed that he would shred Li Tianming into pieces didn\u2019t intend to attack, as he wished to pick Li Tianming off only when he was weakened.Hmm.When Li Tianming\u2019s eyes met Zhang Zixuan\u2019s, he could sense his opponent\u2019s fear. With a tap on the roof that sent tiles flying, Li Tianming blinked in front of Zhang Zixuan. With Li Tianming\u2019s strength now comparable to those in the ninth level of Beast Vein, how could Zhang Zixuan, who was only slightly stronger than Li Zifeng, even stand a chance?Voosh!\u201cZhang Zixuan, you\u2019re first!\u201d Zhang Zixuan broke out into cold sweat as he saw the punch thrown towards his face. Before he could even dodge, Li Tianming\u2019s fist had already found his face.Wham! Zhang Zixuan\u2019s nose sank into his face, and blood splattered all over the place!That was the first scream that would be heard from the roofs of Halcyon Hotel today. The seniors on level three first saw Zhang Zixuan falling off the building with blood trailing from his nose, followed by a furious little chick piercing the Blue-Tailed Scorpion\u2019s armor in a scarlet ray of light. Before the scorpion could retaliate, the little chick\u2019s wings whipped across its face, the force of the slap throwing it far into the distance and slamming into nearby houses.\u201cXuan\u2019er!\u201d Zhang Chong\u2019s face was as white as chalk. Rage churned inside him as he picked up his son and saw his disfigured face. He had already murdered Li Tianming a thousand times in his mind, but he didn\u2019t dare make a move. After all, the Lightning Manor had specifically instructed them that they would be disrespecting Princess Qing if they personally got involved in a fight among the younger generation.\u201cOi, if you have other children, stop giving them common names! I can find ten thousand Zixuan, Zihan and Ziqis in Flamehaven.\u201d Li Tianming\u2019s comment from atop the roof almost made Zhang Chong puke blood. How would Li Tianming know that he took over a week to think of this \u2018elegant\u2019 name!This first casualty from the battle had already thrown the spectators into confusion. The citizens of Flamehaven rubbed their eyes in disbelief, thinking that they might have seen wrongly. But no matter how hard they rubbed their eye or shook their head, the result was the same.\u201cDid Li Tianming, THAT Li Tianming, just kill a Lightning Manor genius in one punch?\u201d They couldn\u2019t see much details from a distance, so the only thing they caught was Zhang Zixuan falling off the roof with blood coming out of his head. Little did they know, this was just the beginning!Li Tianming could see that the rest of the six were still divided, some of them still trying to block Liu Qianyang from Li Tianming. Their infighting brought a grin to Li Tianming\u2019s face, since he would have an easier time taking them down one by one.So far, only one of them had gotten rid of his competitors and made his way to Li Tianming. Amidst all the confusion, he probably didn\u2019t even notice Zhang Zixuan being knocked out by Li Tianming.\u201cA Hurricane Swallow?\u201d The first thing Li Tianming noticed was the lifebound beast. Before he could even see who the owner was, the swallow flapped its wings and sent a burst of wind in his direction. The gust even ripped off many of the roof tiles, shooting them at Li Tianming like hundreds of razor blades.It looked like Halcyon Hotel would be needing a long time to fix their roof\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 29": "Chapter 29 - Unstoppable!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cHey there, swallow, are ya male or female?!\u201d The little chick rushed forward with desire. Relying on its enormous strength, it seized the swallow and gave it a sound drubbing, causing its feathers to fall off.\u201cAAAHHH, mission failure again! Another guy!\u201d Ying Huo raged. The similarly seventh level Hurricane Swallow could only play a part as the one beaten up. The other lifebound beasts couldn\u2019t help it in time before it was pecked full of bloody holes. Shrieking miserably, it fled.Its master was a young man dressed in green with a pretty face, exerting control of the surrounding wind as if he was their favoured child.\u201cDie, Li Tianming!\u201d He looked incredibly elegant with a longsword in hand. His sword strikes were fierce like the winds of a tempest. Alas, no matter how pretty they were, they didn\u2019t make up for the fact that he was the same as Li Tianming, seventh level Beast Vein. And that was no challenge at all to Li Tianming who could fight two levels above himself!Li Tianming directly leapt into the flurry of attacks as he used his left hand to seize the longsword.\u201cImpossible!\u201d The young man\u2019s face fell as his longsword was immediately locked in place.\u201cShoo!\u201d The next moment, a slap on his face sent him on the expressway down Halcyon Hotel\u2019s three floors. His parents only just managed to catch him before he landed, saving him from a grim fate. The two experts from Lightning Manor had grim faces, but what was most insufferable was that they could only watch on! Still, they couldn\u2019t understand how Li Yanfeng\u2019s son could be so strong.Didn\u2019t Li Yanfeng claim he only had the strength of a seventh level Beast Vein? They immediately shifted all their anger to Li Yanfeng, as they felt that he was definitely trying to mess with them. When they looked back up, they saw Li Tianming was still continuing his one-sided abuse.\u201cSo, you just have to be this strong to be called a genius in Lightning Manor?\u201d Li Tianming\u2019s mocking words filled the area.The remaining five no longer dared to continue their infighting. They were starting to have an inkling that Li Tianming wasn\u2019t easy to deal with, but it was already too late. Apart from the ninth level Liu Qianyang, three were eighth level and the last was a seventh level girl.The girl took one look at Zhang Zixuan\u2019s injuries and then said, \u201cWell, I quit. Have fun.\u201dAnd with that, she fled, her Mythical Ice Bug hot on her heels.Four were left!\u201cAre those really geniuses of Lightning Manor?\u201d The citizens were stunned silly. To them, Lightning Manor was a superpower that could crush Flamehaven with a casual breath.How could Li Tianming suppress them so easily? Wasn\u2019t he kicked out of the governor\u2019s manor like the dog that time by Liu Qianyang?\u201cLet\u2019s stop the internal fighting and deal with him first. We\u2019ll decide after we get the manna,\u201d Jiang Yilin was shaking. She was clearly aware Li Tianming hadn\u2019t been this strong before. She had to stop herself from quaking in her boots when she met in the eye. After all, they were down to four.\u201cTogether!\u201d Only Liu Qianyang could still be considered calm. It was to his advantage if Li Tianming was stronger, as it made him a tough nut that only he could crack. He may have made a strong show, but it was still within his acceptable boundaries.Under his command, the four geniuses and their lifebound beasts, the Lightning Bolt Panther, Rumble Rat, Steelclad Giant Shrimp and Six-Eyed Flying Fish encircled him and approached him from four directions. Immediately, the beastmasters executed martial arts while their lifebound beasts unleashed beastial arts, cutting off all of Li Tianming\u2019s escape routes!However, was it really a successful suppression? Li Tianming turned into a blood-coloured blur as he used his supreme beast-ranked art. Fast. Precise. Vicious. The Crimson Blood Dagger stabbed forward using the Bloody Soul Hunt. The Rumble Rat\u2019s master was shrouded in electricity, but that proved no obstacle at all as the dagger sunk into his stomach!Another person tumbled off the roof and into his parent\u2019s embrace. His beast immediately fled the battlefield, returning to its master\u2019s side.\u201cAnother one!\u201d\u201cIs that his guts poking out?\u201dThe Flamehaven citizens couldn\u2019t see clearly if those geniuses had perished in battle, but that didn\u2019t stop their gasps of amazement.\u201cNext!\u201d Li Tianming\u2019s voice seemed as if it drifted out from a nightmare.Blood leaked from holes rent in the Steelclad Giant Shrimp\u2019s shell from the little chick\u2019s claws, while its beastmaster was nearly killed by Li Tianming\u2019s Bloody Soul Hunt. His erratic and agile movement arts left weaker opponents no chance to retaliate. The fifth genius fell off the roof, his beast following him in retreat!\u201cAnother one dead!\u201d\u201cMy goodness!\u201dThey didn\u2019t know none of them had died as to Li Tianming, steamrolling them was sufficient.He didn\u2019t need to look at Li Yanfeng and the rest of the higher levels of Lightning Manor to know how ugly their expressions were. Ugly at how strong he was!In the blink of an eye, seven had been reduced to Jiang Yilin and Liu Qianyang.\u201cI surrender.\u201d Jiang Yilin was still smart enough to tell from how Li Tianming felled her two same level peers that she would be next. She didn\u2019t care if it was a loss of face as she jumped off the roof and returned to her father\u2019s side. She hugged her father\u2019s arm, her face pale as her legs trembled.The entire third floor of Halcyon fell into a deathly silence, except for the wails of the genius beastmasters in their parent\u2019s arms.Li Zifeng and Li Xuejiao, who were hiding in a corner were stupefied. Li Xuejiao tried to bring her cup of tea to her lips for a sip, only for a tile to fall from the ceiling onto her head.\u201cEmbarrassing,\u201d Li Zifeng sniggered.\u201cLike you\u2019re much better. Take a look in the mirror at how pale you are.\u201d\u201cHow was I supposed to know he\u2019ll become this strong? Do you think dad\u2019s words, that he\u2019s stuck in Beast Vein for life, are true?\u201d He no longer put much stock in those words when he saw Li Tianming\u2019s performance.The members of Lightning Manor also had rather ashen faces. They had expected taking the manna from Li Tianming to be like taking candy from a baby, and the main event to be the internal conflict after.However, reality had given them a slap on the face! Li Tianming had gone on to solo seven by himself. Four had suffered humiliating defeats, two had conceded and only Liu Qianyang was left.\u201cBrother Feng, what\u2019s going on?\u201d Even Liu Qing was confused. She had come to Flamehaven believing everything was all according to plan, only for some minor character to wreck her plans again and again. Now, she was also rather worried for Liu Qianyang.\u201cRelax. Li Tianming is older, and did once hit Spiritsource. He also has abundant battle experience and a lot of combat techniques. A slightly spectacular final stand is ordinary. However, have faith in Qianyang! He\u2019s a bona fide ninth level Beast Vein stage. As for Li Tianming, every bit of strength he uses will never recover.\u201d Li Yanfeng was the calmest present.\u201cStill, Qianyang is going to have to try his best. This battle is also very useful to his long-term growth. Overcoming this difficulty and obtaining the manna will make his prospects limitless,\u201d Li Yanfeng continued. Still, his words didn\u2019t stop Liu Qing from looking at the roof anxiously.On the roof, Li Tianming was facing off against Liu Qianyang under the watchful gazes of tens of thousands people. This was the stage he wanted, and he was now the main topic of conversation for half of Flamehaven. From now on, no one would ever say he had challenged Liu Qianyang a month ago only for face. He had used his actions to shut them up!However, Li Tianming wasn\u2019t done yet. To him, seven Lightning Manor geniuses were just the warm-up.Liu Qianyang carried himself with a confidence similar to Lin Xiaoting as he rode the Lightning Bolt Cheetah, as if he were the master of all life. Looking disdainfully at Li Tianming, \u201cLet me be blunt. The manna is useless to you and even if you get the Flameyellow Order, the Flameyellow Scions Institute will NEVER give you entry. You want to go back for revenge? What a joke.\u201d\u201cThat lifebound beast you got through a blood pact has the same lot in life as you. Is trash, and forever will be. Since that\u2019s the case, become my stepping stone.\u201d Sparks danced in Liu Qianyang\u2019s eyes. He had never held fear for Li Tianming from start to finish.\u201cEven if all I can use it for is as paperweights, I\u2019m still taking them from you.\u201d Li Tianming chuckled, but the fire in his eyes told a different story.\u201cAnyone can talk big, like you from three years ago. Unfortunately, you\u2019re destined to be a cripple. It\u2019s only through crushing you that I can make you despair and return to your rightful place as a street rat.\u201d Liu Qianyang drew his weapon.Li Tianming frowned when he saw the weapon, as he could tell this beastial weapon was different from usual.Beastial weapons were crafted with spirit ores with heavenly patterns as their base. They were further strengthened by adding elements such as spirit fire and spirit wind, as well as lifebound beast blood. There were many types, ranging from offensive, defensive, movement, support and so on. Beastial weapons were split into ten grades, from grade one to grade ten, based on their quality.Li Tianming\u2019s Crimson Blood Dagger was a grade two weapon, which was already rather precious. There were quite a number of orange heavenly patterns on it, proving that a variety of orange heavenly pattern ores had been used in its forging.Liu Qianyang had taken out a purple chain that reached four metres in length. Each of its purple links had lightning and purple flames flowing on its surface. This meant that spirit lightning and spirit fire must have been mixed in during its production.The so-called spirit lightning and spirit fire were actually just lightning and fire that had absorbed much spiritual energy and elemental energy, granting them great destructive power. They were called spirit hazards, and wind, water, earth, ice and others were also candidates to obtain heavenly patterns. Only, it wasn\u2019t easy to see heavenly patterns on them.Such spirit ores, spirit hazards and spirit herbs were all precious treasures and miracles of the world.Li Tianming noticed some yellow heavenly patterns on the chain, which made it at least a grade three beastial weapon. It was quite the accomplishment for a beast vein stage beastmaster to be capable of using a grade three weapon.Liu Qianyang was definitely stronger than expected. But, after what he had accomplished so far , there was no way Li Tianming would fear him!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 30": "Chapter 30 - Crazed Demon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cLi Tianming, be honored that you will be the first person to ever taste the fury of my Thunderfire Chain.\u201d Liu Qianyang held the recently acquired chain in his hands, staring fervently at Li Tianming. He was the only one in ninth level Beast Vein here, and he took pride in that talent of his!While the Thunderfire Chain was looped around his arm for now, it was likely that Liu Qianyang would be using it as a whip. Considering its capacity to tangle its foes, it was even more deadly than a regular whip. The grade three beastial weapon instantly attracted voices of envy and admiration from the audience, with most people suspecting it was too big an advantage for Li Tianming to overcome.\u201cDon\u2019t think Li Tianming can take this one down\u2026 \u201d\u201cForget it, his performance today is already quite impressive.\u201d\u201cOther than that scandal in Ignispolis, Li Tianming was quite a good student. It\u2019s saddening to see the kind of things young people would do for love.\u201d\u201cBut that one misstep was enough to destroy his future. His struggle now is all but useless.\u201dIn fact, Li Tianming could hear a lot of the things being said about him. A useless struggle? He came back here today to show the world that it was anything but a useless struggle. He came back to tell the world that he, Li Tianming, would rise up from the ashes! He had enough with people throwing him looks of pity or ridicule!That coldblooded man downstairs, what did he think when he saw Li Tianming fight for his honour or his own wife withering away? Li Tianming might not be able to make that man regret all his actions, but the least he could do was to make his father question his choice of picking Liu Qianyang instead. And to do that, he just needed to defeat and shame Liu Qianyang!\u201cDie!\u201dThis time, him and Ying Huo would have a direct clash with Liu Qianyang and the Lightning Bolt Cheetah!As expected, Liu Qianyang used his whip art, the Thunder Channeling Whip! The Thunderfire Chain lashed out with a swift and mighty strike, giving the impression that Li Tianming had nowhere to hide. Bam! A few snaps from the whip later, the rooftop of the Halcyon Hotel had collapsed, forcing all those still inside the building to evacuate. Moments after everyone had left the building, the Halcyon Hotel, the tallest building in the area, had collapsed into rubble and dust under the force of Liu Qianyang\u2019s whip!Even then, the chain brimming with sparks of flame and thunder was still chasing after Li Tianming mercilessly! Many spectators couldn\u2019t help but think that Li Tianming was just another paper tiger who would not stand a chance against Liu Qianyang and his Thunderfire Chain!\u201cWimp named Li Tianming, do you still dare not fight me?\u201d Liu Qianyang snickered as the situation swayed in his favor.\u201cTo me, one move is enough.\u201d With his smooth sidestep, Li Tianming evaded a pounce from the Lightning Bolt Cheetah, followed by a lash from Liu Qianyang\u2019s whip. Like a crimson shadow, he kept on dodging within the debris.As for Ying Huo, it was even bolder. It had made its way onto the Lightning Bolt Cheetah\u2019s back, trying to tear a hole in its body. With its small size, the cheetah was hard-pressed to catch or even attack it.Bzzz! In defense, the Lightning Bolt Cheetah used its furs to generate electric bolts to force the little chick off its body.\u201cStop struggling! Today is the day I\u2019ll drink your blood and feast on your flesh!\u201d Enduring the electric shocks, Ying Huo actually managed to peck a hole in the cheetah\u2019s body and was trying to worm inside. The cheetah even tried rolling around but to no avail.Within moments, Liu Qianyang realised that there was no point targeting the little chick, and the smarter move here was to attack Li Tianming together with his Lightning Bolt Cheetah. As he lashed his Thunderfire Chain at Li Tianming, the cheetah also swept its long tail like a whip at the fleeing young man. That forced Li Tianming to deal with both the martial art and its beastial art equivalent at the same time!Li Tianming looked like he was on the downside, but as he said, he only needed to use one move for the entire battle. And now, he had found the perfect opportunity to strike!The crimson shadow suddenly changed his course and dashed towards Liu Qianyang, his left arm tanking multiple hits from the Thunderfire Chain. That force would be enough to rip off anyone\u2019s arms, but Li Tianming\u2019s remained perfectly intact.Liu Qianyang was stunned to see his attacks not taking effect, and even his whip became slower because of his shock. At that precise moment, Li Tianming grinned and raised up his left hand, where both Liu Qianyang and the Lightning Bolt Cheetah could see the centre of his palm.Bewildering Eye!In that split second, both Liu Qianyang and his Lightning Bolt Cheetah\u2019s eyes became dull, and even their body froze momentarily on the spot.\u201cSister\u2026\u2026\u201d Liu Qianyang muttered, his pupils hazy and his tone perplexed.\u201cScumbag!\u201d Li Tianming of course knew that the Bewildering Eye would cause its victims to see the person who they desired the most, but he never expected that person in Liu Qianyang\u2019s case to be his very own sister! Was this how rotten these so-called \u2018prestigious\u2019 families were?Ethics aside, the use of the Bewildering Eye had given him that one chance he needed to end the battle. Before Liu Qianyang could recover from his illusion, Li Tianming had already punched out his left fist with a Dragon-Mammoth Heavy Strike, aiming straight for Liu Qianyang\u2019s face.BAM!!The sound of bones cracking echoed through the city. A month ago, Li Tianming swore to punch Liu Qianyang\u2019s stupid face, and now when he had the chance to do it, he wasn\u2019t going to show any mercy! It was a blow even stronger than the one Zhang Zixuan received, not only breaking Liu Qianyang\u2019s nose but even threatening to snap his neck!\u201cHelp me, sister! HELP!\u201d Liu Qianyang felt as if he fell off heaven and went straight to hell. The impact of the punch had fried his brain and wiped out any morale he had left. As blood and snot flowed across his face, he just couldn\u2019t understand. How the hell did Li Tianming create an illusion of Liu Qing? If anything, illusion arts were his sister\u2019s specialty. Just how??Alas, Liu Qianyang never got a chance to voice his doubts. The sensation of blood flowing in his mouth had reduced him to a trembling mess, only capable of desperate screams for help. In fact, peeing himself was not off the cards right now.The events unfolding at the Halcyon Hotel was beyond any of the spectators\u2019 wildest dreams.\u201cLiu Qianyang, how do you like this?\u201d Li Tianming was like a demon looming over him, ready to harvest his soul. The sheer terror made Liu Qianyang fall to his knees, his vision blurred by his own blood and his voice hoarse from screaming.\u201cYou have won, Li Tianming, just let me go now. Please, I have made a mistake, spare me, I don\u2019t want to die here.\u201d Liu Qianyang was afraid. He knew that even if Li Tianming dared to kill him, Li Yanfeng and Liu Qing would take revenge for him. But what good will it do when he would already be dead? He could feel Li Tianming\u2019s wrath, and no one could save him if Li Tianming decided to end his life right now.Liu Qianyang didn\u2019t want to die! Kneeling on the floor, he begged for Li Tianming\u2019s mercy. Hell, he would even kowtow and lick Li Tianming\u2019s shoes if he still had the strength to.At that moment, Liu Qianyang could feel cold chills from head to toe. The blurry image of the man standing in front of him would appear in every single nightmare he had for the rest of his life. As for the memory of him crushing Li Tianming at Zephyr Square a month ago, it seemed so ephemeral, like a dream. But for him, that dream had ended.\u201cNO! I beg you, don\u2019t kill me! I\u2019m the useless one, I\u2019m worse than an animal, don't kill me please!\u201d Liu Qianyang howled while trying to wipe off the blood from his face, not realising that it just smeared his face even redder.\u201cBut what if I insist on killing you?\u201d That line was enough for Liu Qianyang to let go of his bladder completely, and warm fluid began to trickle down his pants.As for Li Tianming, he had already made his way behind Liu Qianyang. The Crimson Blood Dagger was pressed against Liu Qianyang\u2019s neck, ready to slit his throat anytime!On the other side, the little chick also made use of the Lightning Bolt Cheetah\u2019s delusions, drilling deep inside the cheetah\u2019s body. It was like a woodpecker, pecking on the cheetah\u2019s spine and eventually cracking it. The cheetah fell to the floor, unable to even stand up!\u201cStill dare to act so cocky in front of grandpappy chicken? Next time, I\u2019ll peck off your manhood!\u201d Having completed its mission, the little chick took to the air valiantly, like the king of all beasts!The battle was over! All that the audience could see now was a struggling Liu Qianyang held by dagger\u2019s tip, and a rolling Lightning Bolt Cheetah with a little chick trampling it. It all happened way too fast, and no one, not even Li Yanfeng, could understand how Liu Qianyang suddenly got defeated.A dead silence enveloped Flamehaven, broken only occasionally by the jeers of the little chick and Liu Qianyang\u2019s cries. Everyone\u2019s eyes were glued to Li Tianming and his lifebound beast, still shocked at the results of this battle. For a good minute or so, not a single soul moved.Li Tianming threw a glance at the courtyard. Amidst all the fighting and the commotion, Wei Jing had merely flipped herself on her lawn chair and was still snoozing off. He smiled, thinking of how relaxed Wei Jing must be. What he didn\u2019t notice was the tear rolling off her cheek.That tear, however, was a tear of joy. Within this one month, Li Tianming had finally proven himself not only to be worthy of the Flameyellow Order, but also that he was back to take back everything he had lost three years ago! Defeating Li Zifeng was just a start, and when he had taken down the seven disciples of the Lightning Manor, he had shown his true worth. His actions screamed out to Flamehaven, that he was no longer the boy that had been crippled, and he would instead be their pride and glory!The Halcyon Hotel had collapsed, and Li Tianming stood before the elites of Flamehaven and Lightning Manor, the life of Liu Qianyang still within his control. The look of exasperation on these peoples\u2019 faces made Li Tianming want to laugh, to question them \u201cWho is the worthless boy now?\u201dOf all people, Li Tianming was most interested in Li Yanfeng\u2019s expression, and he was not disappointed. It was certain that Li Yanfeng had lost much face today. Not only did the son he abandoned outperform everyone else, he had also failed his promise of helping Liu Qianyang obtain the manna.\u201cLord Governor, is it just me or are these so-called geniuses from Lightning Manor all utter garbage? If not why can\u2019t they take a single hit from Flamehaven's resident cripple?\u201d Li Tianming was the first person to break the silence, smiling brightly at Li Yanfeng. What would Li Yanfeng think, when he realised the blood-soaked wreck crying in Li Tianming\u2019s hand was the prodigy he put so much hope in?\u201cRelease him!\u201d That was the only thing Li Yanfeng had to say. If this happened at Red Twill Mountain instead, he could have silenced Li Tianming even if he won the fight. Alas, it wasn\u2019t possible now with so many witnesses.\u201cSure thing, but before that, I\u2019ll be taking my Flameyellow Order according to our bet. And as per tradition, the governor should announce to the city who\u2019s the winner of this year\u2019s selection.\u201d As he spoke, Li Tianming had already found the Flameyellow Order he so dearly wanted in Liu Qianyang\u2019s pocket. The Flameyellow Scions Institute had opened its gates to him once again!\u201cYou already got it, let go of Qianyang, now!\u201d Li Yanfeng could hide the anger in his voice, but he couldn\u2019t hide the distortion on his face. As for Liu Qing, she was already trembling, her face pale as paper.\u201cYou forgot the announcement, very esteemed governor.\u201d Li Tianming still had his dagger pressed against Liu Qianyang\u2019s neck, his eyes never leaving Li Yanfeng. Liu Qianyang tried to struggle, his efforts earning him a tight slap that elicited more cries for mercy.Li Yanfeng never felt this passive in his life before. He was afraid of Li Tianming because he couldn\u2019t afford to let Li Tianming kill Liu Qianyang. Li Tianming had behaved like a crazed demon, and no one would be surprised if he actually did murder Liu Qianyang in cold blood. Making things more troublesome was Princess Qing\u2019s jade pendant! That meant Li Yanfeng had been forced to a dead end with no other choices.\u201cI hereby announce that Li Tianming is the winner of the Flameyellow Order.\u201d Li Yanfeng\u2019s eyes were burning with anger, but there just wasn\u2019t anything else he could do.The citizens of Flamehaven never imagined that Li Yanfeng who silently evicted his wife and son a month ago would be forced to declare the victory of this very own \u2018useless\u2019 son of his! As for Li Tianming, he knew that this was only the first step of his revenge. He had sworn that he would never leave like a loser again!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Li Tianming couldn\u2019t help but sneer, knowing that she was the very person Liu Qianyang desired the most.\u201cRelax, I still have a question for our friends from Lightning Manor. According to your rules, I have defeated all your disciples. Then do I, a friend of Princess Qing, have ownership of the manna now?\u201d Li Tianming really was like a crazed demon, his actions unpredictable. There was no way Li Tianming would lose with Liu Qianyang\u2019s life as his bargaining chip, even to those with greater seniority and strength than him.Liu Qing gritted her teeth, \u201cI admit the manna is yours.\u201d\u201cAha, since you\u2019ve admitted it, then make sure y\u2019all don\u2019t regret this later. You've all lost enough face today.\u201d Li Tianming\u2019s voice was loud and clear, echoing through the city.\u201cThat\u2019s enough, let go of him.\u201d Li Yanfeng\u2019s patience was at a dangerous level. Li Tianming was right that he had lost enough face today.\u201cNo, no. Just one more thing, something more personal.\u201d Li Tianming grinned.\u201cDon\u2019t push my limits, Princess Qing can\u2019t save you from everything!\u201d Li Yanfeng threatened, forcing the words out one by one. He wanted to scare Li Tianming using his aura, but Li Tianming wasn't going to succumb to that!\u201cOf course not. It is my humble wish that the governor would send the winner of the Flameyellow Order off just like what you did for previous selections. And you will wish me a bright future in the Flameyellow Scions Institute!\u201d Li Tianming declared, shocking the city yet again.To Li Tianming, he was merely repeating his request a month ago, and it was something more important to him than the manna and the Flameyellow Order combined. It was a matter of dignity for both him and his mother. He would not let Li Yanfeng silently evict the pair from the city, nor did he want the city to just laugh and forget about them. It was a move to ridicule the governor in front of the entire Flamehaven!At that instant, Li Yanfeng went silent.\u201cAre you not going to agree to my conditions? Surely you wouldn\u2019t want to disappoint your new bride right?\u201d Li Tianming smacked Liu Qianyang in the cheeks again while staring coldly at Li Yanfeng.\u201cJust agree. Get him out of my sight.\u201d Liu Qing\u2019s mind had gone blank looking at the state her brother was in. She had done so much to help him get the Flameyellow Order and manna. But now, everything went to Li Tianming instead.\u201cOh and please prepare a horse cart, a slightly bigger one than usual.\u201d Li Tianming added. He could even feel the air around Li Yanfeng freezing, knowing that the thought of killing him must have crossed Li Yanfeng\u2019s mind at some point in time. But no matter what Li Yanfeng said, he was still scared of the jade pendant. Considering that he had plans and ambitions in the Lightning Manor, he couldn\u2019t afford to make enemies with the wrong people.\u201cHorseman!\u201d Eventually, Li Yanfeng shouted to his subordinates. He didn\u2019t address Li Tianming, but the word was enough to show his concession. This result was good enough for Li Tianming.A short while later, a luxurious horse cart had parked itself in front of Li Tianming. The three horses were all tamed one-star wildbeasts, a guarantee of the cart\u2019s speed. Now the only step left was for the governor to send them off personally, before Liu Qianyang could be released.\u201cThank you Mr Governor.\u201d Li Tianming acknowledged the gift with a light bow, his smile speaking of his defiance. Without hesitation, Li Tianming walked towards the courtyard, Liu Qianyang dragged along in his hand like a broken rag.\u201cMother, are you ready? It\u2019s time to go.\u201d Li Tianming poked his head into the courtyard.\u201cLet\u2019s go then.\u201d To his surprise, Wei Jing had already woken up, and was standing at the doors. She had kept her lifebound beast in her lifebound space, and there was no other luggage with her.She walked up to Li Tianming, gently wiping off the blood from his face. She didn\u2019t mention a word on the day\u2019s happenings, but from the relieved smile on her face, Li Tianming could tell that she was freed from the pain that Li Yanfeng had brought upon the family.\u201cMother, after you.\u201d At the center of everyone\u2019s attention, Li Tianming escorted an elderly woman out of the courtyard. Even though her hair was an ashen white and her skin wrinkled, onlookers could tell from her elegant posture that she was once a charmer.With a ragged Liu Qianyang in one hand and his mother in the other, Li Tianming carefully supported her up the horse cart.Before the curtains of the cart lowered, Wei Jing took a final look in Li Yanfeng\u2019s direction. He was dazed by her gracefulness, as it reminded him of her charm during their youth. Back then, he often wondered what he had done to deserve this wonderful woman.But now, as she disappeared from sight with a smile still on her face, Li Yanfeng couldn't help but feel ashamed. She was as calm and composed as ever, as if Li Yanfeng never deserved her in the first place.But she was the one that was sick and dying! Why was it that even when she\u2019s leaving the city, she was more dignified than he ever would be? Her smile was like a knife, hurting him more than anything Li Tianming had done so far. But as the curtain closed completely, he had lost his final chance to question her, and they would never meet again.Li Tianming seated himself on the cart too, personally manning the horse cart. Liu Qianyang was still by his side, only to be freed once they left the city. As the group rode off, Li Tianming turned back and shouted at Li Yanfeng. \u201cEsteemed Governor, remember to keep up! Wouldn\u2019t it be sad if I just dump this genius beastmaster outside of the city and no one even picks him up?\u201dThere was no one to reply to him, as Li Yanfeng was still pondering over Wei Jing\u2019s reactions. But as Li Tianming rode off into the distance, they had no choice but to run after him in fear of Liu Qianyang\u2019s safety!What a rare sight it was for Flamehaven! A group led by the governor Li Yanfeng himself, consisting of disciples of Lightning Manor and the officials and generals from Flamehaven, chasing after a horse cart! Li Tianming drove along the familiar streets of the city he grew up in, with all the rich and famous behind his back \u2018sending him off\u2019!Countless citizens watched his departure in awe, his achievements today something they would remember for life. They would never forget this image of Li Tianming breaking free from this city, while all the big-shots could do nothing to stop him.Li Tianming could feel the gentle breeze caressing his face, as all the buildings and stunned residents flew past his sight. It was a refreshing feeling that he had never experienced before!\u201cPerhaps this is the purpose of all my cultivation, to fight for my dignity and to be the master of my own life!\u201d From now on, Flamehaven was history to him. He would never return to this heartless place, nor see these cold-blooded people. His goal would be the Flameyellow Scions Institute, the place where he had lost many things, and also the place where he would take everything back!\u201cWhat a badass. From now on, you should change your name to Tianming the Badass, so you can truly cut all ties with your father!\u201d said the little chick who was positioned on top of one of the horses.\u201cScrew off!\u201d Li Tianming laughed. He may have cut ties with many family members today, but he had gained a new brother. In fact, there were many more siblings in his lifebound space, waiting to join him, and that was more than enough for him.Li Tianming could already see the city gate by now. Even the travelling time felt so much shorter when he was in a good mood. The moment he crossed the gate, he casually tossed Liu Qianyang away. By the time Li Yanfeng\u2019s group caught up and brought Liu Qianyang back to his feet, Li Tianming was already disappearing into the distance.\u201cLord Governor, you forgot to wish me a bright future in the institute!\u201d Even as he left, his voice seemed to linger across the city.\u201cWhere\u2019s the Thunderfire Chain?\u201d Li Yanfeng realised something was wrong when he helped Liu Qianyang up. Obviously, Li Tianming had pocketed that precious grade three beastial weapon.\u201cThat bastard!\u201d Li Yanfeng stood up and prepared to chase down the horse cart, knowing that they got fooled yet again.\u201cForget it, we have lost enough face today. Can you imagine what the people would say about us if we pursued him now?\u201d Liu Qing shook her head. Indeed, every single one of them there had been played by the young man, and they really shouldn't stoop any lower.\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t be laughing much longer. Even with the Flameyellow Order, he can\u2019t make it into the Flameyellow Scions Institute since it is impossible for him to clear the entrance exam,\u201d Zhang Chong stated, hoping that it would make everyone feel better.\u201cIt would be a joke if a one-star lifebound beast made it into the institute,\u201d replied Jiang Tao.\u201cI heard that the Entrance Exam this year would be extra difficult since it is a very competitive year. We are seeing a large number of capable youths, but the number of people admitted to the institute is fixed.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, and no matter how many prodigies there are, out of all the disciples who can clear the entrance exam, only one of them gets to become the prime disciple and enter Heaven\u2019s Sanctum directly!\u201dTo get first place in the entrance exam and directly enter Heaven's Sanctum was every youth\u2019s dream. While there were still plenty of opportunities to be enlisted in the sanctum, the honor of being the prime disciple in the quadrennial examination was something unique.Four years ago, the prime disciple of Li Tianming\u2019s batch was Lin Xiaoting of the Lightning Manor! And today, he had become the number one genius in Heaven\u2019s Sanctum!\u201cFour years ago Lin Xiaoting won the position as the Prime Disciple. I wonder who would be the lucky one this year?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not sure about the rest, but our very own Lin Xiaoxiao is definitely one of the popular picks. She is the closest to Lin Xiaoting\u2019s level in the past four years.\u201d\u201cNot only is she Xiaoting\u2019s younger sister, she is also a twin beastmaster just like him! Both of them commands two lifebound beasts!\u201d\u201cXiaoxiao had been putting in a lot of effort in the past years to reach her brother\u2019s standards. Even if we have strong contestants from families like the Vermilion Bird Clan, I suppose our Lightning Manor prodigy will shake the world once more.\u201dNaturally, Li Tianming didn\u2019t hear all these discussions going on in Flamehaven. Four years ago, he had barely made it past the entrance exam to study in the Flameyellow Scions Institute. While it was a marvelous result for Flamehaven\u2019s standard, it was nothing in Ignispolis.But this time, Li Tianming\u2019s goal was different. This time, the only result he would accept would be to become the prime disciple!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 32": "Chapter 32 - Xing Mansion And Chen ChateauPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIt wasn\u2019t Li Tianming\u2019s first rodeo in Ignispolis. It was a blazing hot city, and even its walls seemed to be dyed a fiery red by the scorching sun. From afar, the city looked like a giant stove bustling with heat and activity.Of all the cities Li Tianming had seen, it was the most prosperous of all. The city was occupied by the most famous clans and families, a hub for the nation\u2019s wealth, talents, experts and resources. It was the ultimate dream for every youth in Vermilion Bird.Four years ago, Li Tianming was just like many other youths. He arrived in Ignispolis with great ambitions and cultivated in the Flameyellow Scions Institute. Everything seemed to be going so well back then.Four years had passed, and here he was, with a totally different meaning in life. Not only had his mindset changed completely, he even had his mother with him this time.Wei Jing rolled up the curtains from inside the horse cart. Her gaze was as calm as water, hinting at experiences entirely different from Li Tianming\u2019s own. She never told him any stories from her time in Ignispolis before, but Li Tianming always knew that she had lived in the capital before her marriage. Her childhood was situated in this passionate city.Wei Jing wore a faint smile, but her eyes seemed to be misty. What could be going on in her mind, after returning to her hometown after twenty years?Watching her silvery hair getting blown up by the breeze, Li Tianming suddenly found himself imagining her youth. Like Jiang Feiling or Princess Qing, she must have been a lovely and lively girl.\u201cThis disease has been way too cruel to her.\u201d Li Tianming could only exclaim in his mind.\u201cHow do you find this place? Do you miss it? Are you holding back your tears now?\u201d Li Tianming teased his mother.\u201cHa, your mother was never a sentimental person. I just really miss the pastries in Ignispolis, those mung bean cakes and osmanthus jellies were heavenly.\u201d She was almost drooling when she talked about the delicacies of Ignispolis. Did she spend her childhood strolling the street with snacks in hand? Li Tianming could only imagine.\u201cRest assured, when your son makes enough money, you\u2019ll get to eat all you want. Once we settle down in Ignispolis, I\u2019ll bring you the best pastries in the city everyday.\u201d Li Tianming smiled.\u201cPinky promise. I will lock you out of the house if you ever forget.\u201d Wei Jing tried to make a stern face.\u201cWhat a heartless lady.\u201d Li Tianming shook his head, but he could barely hide his grin. Once they left Flamehaven, with that man out of their sight, life was so much more joyous.\u201cWe have a problem now though. We have nothing with us, where are we going to stay in Ignispolis?\u201d This was the most urgent problem Li Tianming had to solve right now. Had he arrived alone, he could live in the institute once he entered it. But his mother couldn\u2019t \u2014 she needed a place to call home.\u201cI can settle this. Your mother still has some friends in the city.\u201d Wei Jing smiled. Clearly, she had planned this through.\u201cIt\u2019s just that we haven\u2019t met for a good twenty years, I hope they are all living a better life than me right now.\u201d No matter how close they used to be, they all each have their own life, their own family now.Ever since they entered the city, Wei Jing had guided Li Tianming towards the western part of the capital. The city was huge, and one would probably take a good week or so to tour it completely. They were headed for the commercial district of Ignispolis, where business was bustling all day.\u201cDo you know where the \u2018Chen Chateau\u2019 is?\u201d Wei Jing asked.\u201cWho doesn\u2019t? The Chen Chateau and Xing Mansion are the most luxurious mansions in the western district, only surpassed by the Imperial Palace.\u201d Li Tianming lived in Ignispolis for a year, and was quite familiar with its geography. In fact, the only thing stopping the two mansions from one-upping the palace was out of respect for the Vermilion Bird Clan.The owners of the brilliant mansions were none other than the two presidents of \u2018Xing & Chen Merchantry\u2019. The merchantry was the largest business union in the entire Vermilion Bird, and controlled most businesses interests that ran in the nation. It also had branches across the nation, including Flamehaven. One could have an inkling of the union\u2019s power from the popular saying: There\u2019s nothing you can\u2019t get from Xing & Chen Merchantry.As for its two presidents, they were both legendary icons of Vermilion Bird. The two of them started from scratch, and were known as the \u2018Starry Twins\u2019 twenty years ago. Now everyone knew them as the \u2018Starry Sages\u2019.In a short twenty years, they expanded their business across the nation, and accumulated wealth matching that of a small country\u2019s. They even had the strength to compete with old school powerhouses in the nation, such as the Lightning Manor.Xing Mansion and Chen Chateau were Sage Xing and Sage Chen\u2019s residences respectively, and had hosted many reputable personages over the years. It wasn\u2019t a place for regular citizens, and at least Li Tianming had never visited it before.\u201cWhy are we heading there? Do you know anyone from the Chen Chateau?\u201d Li Tianming was curious about his mother\u2019s connections.\u201cA girlfriend of mine married into the Chen Chateau.\u201d She too was nervous about seeing a friend for the first time in twenty years. Things had changed, and she was now just a sickly old lady evicted from her own family.Before long, mother and son found themselves in front of a gleaming manor. The estate was like a small castle, seated in the center of the most luxurious district in Ignispolis. Perhaps, the most outstanding aspect of the building was the glowing gems engraved into the walls and statues of the estate, making the place shine like a star in the night sky.The gates to the Chen Chateau were guarded by fearsome sentinels and ferocious beasts. The sentinels purely used lifebound beasts of adult tiger and lion species, scaring most pedestrians even though they were dozing off.Li Tianming parked his horse cart in front of the gates. The horse cart was fancy and well-furnished, as it used to be Li Yanfeng\u2019s personal ride. Therefore, he easily attracted the attention of the guards.\u201cSir, may I know if you intend to visit Chen Chateau? Do you have an invitation?\u201d They were rather polite to him, since they did not know which reputable family Li Tianming hailed from.\u201cPlease inform your Madam Xue Lan that her old friend Wei Jing wishes to visit.\u201d Wei Jing rolled up the curtains and answered.\u201cOur mistress? She doesn't usually entertain guests. I\u2019m sorry, but I can\u2019t let you in.\u201d The guard treated his job very seriously.\u201cPlease, just tell her my name. If she doesn\u2019t want to see me, then I will take my leave.\u201d Wei Jing asked politely.To be safe, the guard ended up reporting to their mistress anyways. In the end, Wei Jing was an elderly lady, and could be their mistress\u2019 senior. They would get into trouble if they chased the wrong people away.......It has been a while since the guard left to notify their mistress. That was understandable, considering that Chen Chateau was a huge place.\u201cMother, is this madam you know famous in Chen Chateau?\u201d Li Tianming was curious.\u201cOf course, how can Sage Chen\u2019s wife not be famous?\u201d Wei Jing replied with a smile.\u201cWhat?\u201d Li Tianming gawked at his mother in disbelief. If she was friends with Sage Chen\u2019s wife, she definitely had quite a background in Ignispolis twenty years ago. It was Sage Chen they were talking about, the legend of Ignispolis who held equal power as some of the highest-ranking officials in the nation. Li Tianming could only dream of meeting someone like Sage Chen.Before Li Tianming could voice his doubt, the guard had already returned. \u201cMadam Xue Lan extends her warmest greetings and invites her guests to the Daybreak Snow Pavilion. Please, follow me.\u201dOnly when they stepped foot in the chateau did Li Tianming realise that he underestimated the wealth of the household. Pavilions and towers sprouted in the estate like bamboo shoots, each of them decorated with a myriad of ornaments and jewels. The governor\u2019s manor back in Flamehaven was nothing but a shack compared to the glory of the Chen Chateau.To be the mistress of the Chen Chateau, Xue Lan must be an extraordinary lady as well. It was hard to imagine how sisters from years ago ended up so differently, one being the mistress of a grand chateau, and the other homeless. Life had been really cruel to Wei Jing. But looking from Wei Jing\u2019s expression, she seemed genuinely happy about her sister\u2019s fortune.It was quite a distance to the Daybreak Snow Pavilion, and the group walked past an arena where many youths from Xing & Chen Merchantry were training at. Many trainees from the merchantry enrolled in the Flameyellow Scions Institute each year, and today\u2019s training was probably a final preparation for the entrance exam, which was only three days away.A particular boy about the age of fifteen caught Li Tianming\u2019s attention. He was tall and slender, dressed in a sky blue training robe. His long hair was combed neatly behind his back, giving him a meticulous look. The most prominent feature about him was still his eyes, sparkling and crystal clear.From a single look, one could tell that the teenager came from an impressive family. The nobility that ran in their blood was not something you would find in common youths. Even in an arena filled with promising youths, he stood out among the rest like a shining star.His lifebound beast was a stout purple lion, cultivating by his side. The lion had six distinct stars in its eyes, indicating that it was a six-star lifebound beast. That put him as one of the most promising youths in the entire Vermilion Bird, incomparable to those like Liu Qianyang or Jiang Yilin.\u201cThis is our young master Chen Yao\u2019s lifebound beast, the Hex-starred Clinquant Lion. Even among the six-star lifebound beasts, it is a high-tier one,\u201d the guard explained, his expression filled with pride and envy.Li Tianming was aware that Ignispolis categorized lifebound beasts into more specific tiers. Even within five-star and six-star beasts, they would be specified into low, mid and high tier beasts. For example, his Four-Winged Goldroc was classified as a mid-tier five-star beast.This Hex-starred Clinquant Lion was not just any six-star lifebound beast, but a high-tier one. This further illustrated the young master Chen Yao\u2019s superb talents.\u201cIs that Xue Lan\u2019s kid?\u201d Wei Jing asked.\u201cOf course! Young master Chen Yao is the madam\u2019s youngest son. Her eldest son, Chen Hao, is currently training in Heaven\u2019s Sanctum and is one of the best disciples there!\u201d The guard replied.Chen Hao? Li Tianming found the name familiar. Chen Hao had ranked third place in the exam three years ago and didn\u2019t get the direct entrance into Heaven\u2019s Sanctum. But ever since then he worked even harder, and made his way into the Sanctum some time later.\u201cYoung master Chen Yao will be attending the entrance exam three days later. He is one of the most hopeful ones to get first place and enter Heaven\u2019s Sanctum directly. Did you know, the earlier a person makes it into the Sanctum, the more opportunities and resources they will get? If young master Chen Hao had gotten first place for his year, he would be doing even better than that Lin Xiaoting.\u201d The guard explained enthusiastically.It went without saying that this young master would be another of Li Tianming\u2019s rivals three days later.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 33": "Chapter 33 - RealityPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaySpiritsource was the base requirement to be number one in the entrance exam. Four years ago, Lin Xiaoting had accomplished it as third level Spiritsource, and the standard today should be roughly the same.In contrast, Li Tianming had only joined the institute with great difficulty four years ago with a seventh level Beast Vein cultivation. Joining Heaven's Sanctum was just a pipe dream.He had made great strides recently and had hopes of rising up through the entrance exam this time. He would make progress on his mother\u2019s illness if and only if he joined the Sanctum.They soon reached Daybreak Snow Pavilion. A beautiful madam dressed in golden clothes was waiting for them inside. Even though she was likely forty as well, no traces of time could be seen on her. Her flawless skin seemed to belong to a teenage girl instead.Her tall and slender frame was delicate and strong. She had obviously maintained her body well, and combined with her noble air, gave her a sort of grace. If she were to go to the streets, anyone would identify her wealthy background easily.\u201cIt really is you, Jing\u2019er!\u201d The madam hastened to Wei Jing, her eyes reddening.\u201cLan'er.\u201d They had finally reunited after twenty years. Wei Jing held her hand, her fingers trembling slightly. Her eyes were already red.\u201cLet\u2019s go inside to talk.\u201d Madam Xue Lan led her into the pavilion before taking a seat. She looked sadly at Wei Jing. \u201cSo in the end, your Lifesbane did flare up. You already look so old at forty. I never knew you were having it so tough. Jing\u2019er, I\u2019ll have visited you earlier if I had known.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m used to it.\u201d Wei Jing smiled peacefully. She pulled Li Tianming forward, \u201cLet me introduce you, Lan'er. This is my son, Li Tianming. Tianming, greet your Aunt Lan.\u201d\u201cHello Aunt Lan.\u201d Li Tianming paid his respects politely. He was sincerely happy for his mother to find an old friend in Ignispolis.\u201cYour kid has grown so big. That\u2019s nice, he should be close in age to my Hao\u2019er.\u201dLi Tianming stood by the side and listened to them chat.\u201cJing\u2019er, it\u2019s been twenty years. Your reason for returning this time\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve ended it with Li Yanfeng. I won\u2019t be returning to Flamehaven. I\u2019ll be in Ignispolis from now on. I\u2019ve missed this place and the rest of you.\u201d\u201cIf only you hadn\u2019t been so stubborn then,\u201d Xue Lan sighed.Wei Jing shook her head.\u201cNo need to mention old matters.\u201dXue Lan pursed her lips. \u201cFine. Did you return because you hope the Sanctum Potentate will help you resolve the curse? I don\u2019t think it\u2019s likely. He\u2019s the one who kicked you out then. With his personality, I doubt he\u2019ll have forgiven you even after twenty years.\u201d\u201cNo, not for that.\u201d Wei Jing still wasn\u2019t interested in pursuing old topics, which led to a slight disconnect in their conversation. \u201cI returned because I want to reside peacefully in Ignispolis and spend my last days with my son. I thought I'd visit you while I was at it. I\u2019m happy you all are living so well.\u201d\u201cIs that so.\u201d Xue Lan nodded. \u201cI respect your choice regardless.\u201d\u201cI have a favour to ask.\u201d Wei Jing leveled a serious look at her.\u201cDon\u2019t speak like that! You and I, we\u2019re sisters! I\u2019ll definitely help you as much as I can,\u201d Xue Lan said.\u201cI\u2019ll like a residence near Flameyellow Scions Institute if possible. It doesn\u2019t need to be grand, as long as it's livable. My son and I haven\u2019t had a place to rest ever since we arrived.\u201d\u201cHow could I let you do that! Listen, just stay at Chen Chateau. It\u2019s easy for me to take care of you too.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s too much trouble for you. I\u2019m someone who\u2019s going to pass away soon, so I just want some peace and quiet.\u201d Wei Jing shook her head.\u201cJing\u2019er\u2026\u201d Pain was written all over Xue Lan\u2019s face. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll make the appropriate arrangements immediately.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cOn that topic, are you looking for a residence near the institute as your kid got a Flameyellow Order and is about to take the entrance exam?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dXue Lan considered Li Tianming, before asking, \u201cChild, what\u2019s your current cultivation?\u201d\u201cSeventh level Beast Vein stage.\u201d\u201cDecent, but the competition this time will be fierce. You\u2019ll need to work pretty hard to secure a place so you don\u2019t let your mother down.\u201d Xue Lan warned.\u201cI\u2019ll try my best.\u201d Li Tianming nodded. He was definitely thankful to her for helping to resolve some of his mother\u2019s worries.However, an unpleasant voice cut in. \u201cSeventh level Beast Vein, and you\u2019re from the sticks? Don\u2019t you think you\u2019re somewhat dreaming to want to enter the institute?\u201dA young man walked in from outside. Several maids were helping him remove his exercise clothing and don a luxurious set of long robes. Finally, they proffered him water with which to wash his face and hands.\u201cSo, we have guests, mother.\u201d It was Chen Yao, who had completed his drills.\u201cYes, this was my sister in the past.\u201d Xue Lan looked at her son with warmth and love.\u201cSister?\u201d Chen Yao snorted out loud after taking a look. \u201cAmazing. You became sisters with an old lady when you were young? She\u2019s old enough to be your grandma!\u201dWhile the words were spoken in jest, they were quite unpleasant to hear. Li Tianming frowned.\u201cDon\u2019t say that, Yao\u2019er! It\u2019s rude.\u201d While she scolded him, her tone wasn\u2019t particularly critical.\u201cI can\u2019t be bothered with this.\u201d He was already done washing his face and continued, \u201cJust send them away already. It really is just so annoying to see penniless friends trying to come and beg. It\u2019s ruining my mood for the exam.\u201d\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll speed this up. I won\u2019t hold up your herbal soup.\u201d Xue Lan spoke lovingly to her son.She smiled at Wei Jing, \u201cSorry about that. My kid just hasn\u2019t grown up. He still wants my herbal soup even now. It\u2019s just so expensive and hard to make! Just look at how calloused my hands are these days!\u201d She extended flawless hands to Wei Jing that had obviously never seen a day of housework in their life. They were obviously in much better condition than Wei Jing\u2019s.Li Tianming immediately understood many things. How could he not realise by now that this woman\u2019s show of affection was just a pretense?Now, she had made such an overt mockery, and she had even done it without batting an eye. It really was very incisive.\u201cHow could that be? Lan\u2019er, your hands are just as beautiful as twenty years ago.\u201d Wei Jing smiled.Li Tianming had expected his mother to feel uncomfortable, but it turned out she was made of sterner stuff than that.Wei Jing got to her feet. \u201cWell, we just arrived at Ignispolis. We still have many miscellaneous matters to handle, so we won\u2019t impose on you anymore, Lan\u2019er.\u201d\u201cWhy not stay a little longer? I\u2019ll get the servants to prepare a feast!\u201d Xue Lan said, reluctant to part.\u201cNo need.\u201d Wei Jing shook her head.\u201cFine. We\u2019ll have lots of opportunities to meet now that you\u2019re back. I\u2019ll get the servants to prepare Chen Yao Inn for you all to stay tonight. Someone will bring you over in a while.\u201d Her arrangements seemed rather considerate.\u201cMuch thanks.\u201d\u201cSomeone, come help send off these VIPs.\u201dXue Lan was still smiling brightly after Li Tianming and Wei Jing left.\u201cWhy do you look so happy?\u201d Chen Yao asked curiously.\u201cAm I? You can\u2019t say that! My sister has been suffering for twenty years, and will even have to pass on alone soon. I pity her so much!\u201d Xue Lan\u2019s mouth twitched.\u201cIs that so? I feel like you\u2019re close to dancing, though.\u201d Chen Yao\u2019s mouth twitched back.\u201cNonsense. Life really is full of twists and turns. It really is incredible sometimes.\u201d Xue Lan could no longer resist chuckling.\u201cHow boring.\u201d Chen Yao recalled Li Tianming\u2019s features and suddenly said, \u201cI find that guy rather familiar. What\u2019s his name?\u201d\u201cIt was\u2026 Li Tianming or something? He\u2019s Li Yanfeng\u2019s spawn. That year, it really was a case of a toad eating swan meat.\u201d Xue Lan shook her head.\u201cLi Tianming\u2026? I remember now! He had entered the institute four years ago! Now, he\u2019s the butt of their jokes there.\u201d Chen Yao was laughing too.\u201cHow so?\u201dChen Yao described what had happened three years ago. Even today, people were still discussing it.\u201cOne woman born with a hard lot in life and a depraved son. What a wonderful match.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s still seventh level even though his lifebound beast died? He should have used a blood pact. He really is underestimating the entrance exam, if he\u2019s expecting to get in.\u201d Chen Yao couldn\u2019t stop himself from shaking his head. He couldn\u2019t understand why someone with his reputation in tatters wanted to come back for round two.Xue Lan had had her fun. She was just about to start making the herbal soup when a servant reported that Sage Chen was back. She immediately dressed herself up before going to welcome him.Chen Chateau plunged into silence the moment he entered. This influential figure of Vermilion Bird looked young enough to be Chen Yao\u2019s elder brother. However, it was impossible to hide the experience and power shown in his eyes.All the guards along the way bow and scraped as if this was the emperor himself. If what was within Chen Yao\u2019s eyes was described as a star, then what lay in Sage Chen\u2019s eyes could only be as a galaxy, the brightness within illuminating the entire chateau.After his return, Xue Lan helped him to change his clothes, before entering his embrace like a happy young girl.\u201cWho were those two who left? They looked familiar.\u201d Sage Chen stroked her long hair.\u201cYou saw her?\u201d Xue Lan curled her lips.\u201cWho was it?\u201d\u201cThat person you couldn\u2019t obtain that time.\u201d Xue Lan smiled.Sage Chen shot to his feet and leveled Xue Lan with a deep look. His expression was grave and shocked as he asked, \u201cHer?!\u201d\u201cYes, did you see her clearly? She\u2019s ugly and old now. Don\u2019t you just want to puke by simply looking at her? I\u2019ve done it myself already today. Need me to help you to the bathroom so you can do it too?\u201d Xue Lan looked up at him, amused as she teased him.He didn\u2019t respond.\u201cSo, do you still love her? Now that she\u2019s forty and so very ugly?\u201d Lan Xue smiled charmingly.Sage Chen took a deep breath and left the room wordlessly.\u201cTake a close, close look! Burn into your mind how ugly she is now! If you haven\u2019t puked enough outside, don\u2019t even think of coming back!\u201d Even after he left, her shrill voice continued to echo out, growing louder and louder.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 34": "Chapter 34 - I Wouldn\u2019t Let Anyone Hurt You!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cSo that lady is asking us to wait at their Chen Yao Inn, until she arranges a spot for us to live?\u201d Li Tianming drove the horse cart along the Ignispolis streets. Chen Yao Inn was one of the best hotels in Ignispolis, and with the money they had, they simply couldn\u2019t afford a single night there.\u201cForget about Chen Yao Inn,\u201d Wei Jing said from inside the cart.Li Tianming was not naive \u2014 how would he not perceive the smugness in Xue Lan\u2019s voice? If she wasn't going to hide her pretentiousness in front of them, what she would do and say behind their backs wasn\u2019t too hard to imagine.\u201cForget about all these so-called sisters. There are always people who would suck up to the rich and powerful, but can\u2019t wait to take advantage of other people\u2019s misfortune. A lot of things can change in twenty years.\u201d Li Tianming shook his head.\u201cShe didn\u2019t use to be like this...\u201d Wei Jing\u2019s voice was slightly shaky.\u201cMother, I don\u2019t wish for you to bow down to others for me, and I will never let anyone hurt you for that.\u201d Li Tianming could tell that she was upset by the events today, and that angered him more than anything. They weren\u2019t just fooled, they were fooled by someone they trusted deeply. If Wei Jing had not treated Xue Lan as her real sister, she would not have approached her for help in the first place. But in the end they achieved nothing except for bringing shame upon themselves.\u201cI know.\u201d She nodded her head. As much as she tried to hide her emotions, Li Tianming could tell that she was deeply hurt today.\u201cLi Yanfeng\u2019s horse cart is of decent quality, and can probably be sold for a tidy sum. With that money, we can find a hotel to stay for about a month. Once I enter the institute, we can think about subsequent plans.\u201d Li Tianming planned their next steps.Xue Lan would definitely arrange a place for them to stay, and with her power she could get it done in a minute. But Wei Jing wouldn\u2019t even step foot in the Chen Yao Inn. They were no longer sisters, but complete strangers.Ignispolis was like a giant whirlpool, things come and go and the people here adapt to survive. Many may have lost their way, but Li Tianming wasn\u2019t going to be one of them. In fact after today\u2019s events, Li Tianming swore to himself that he would never let anybody have the chance to ever hurt her again!\u201cMother, it\u2019s about time you tell me about Heaven's Sanctum. What is Lifesbane? Who is the Sanctum Potentate?\u201d\u201cYou are too young, there\u2019s no use for you to know all of these. I\u2019m happy enough to be back here in Ignispolis and breath my hometown\u2019s air.\u201d Wei Jing said casually, rolling up the curtains.\u201cAre you saying that you wish to just be forgotten, to leave this world without anyone realising? Will you not count on me just this once?\u201d Li Tianming turned his head back abruptly, and gazed at Wei Jing. She had her usual smile on \u2014 it was possible that she really had these thoughts.\u201cMother, listen! I will make it to Heaven\u2019s Sanctum, and I will cure your illness. No matter how difficult it is, I swear I will do it!\u201d Li Tianming said earnestly, every word a promise to his mother.Wei Jing shook her head. \u201cThe road to enter Heaven's Sanctum is arduous and back-breaking. Curing my illness, even more so.\u201d\u201cOf course I know that. But you have to trust your own son, just like how I trust you, mother. I trust that my mother is not a slave to fate, and is not someone who will back down from difficulties! You must have many regrets and unaccomplished things in your life! And therefore, as your son, I will do whatever it takes for you to live a normal life once more!\u201d Li Tianming was more excited than he ever was, holding Wei Jing\u2019s hand in his, looking firmly into her eyes.\u201cBut Tianming\u2026... \u201d Wei Jing didn\u2019t know what to say. Of course she didn\u2019t want to just leave the world like this, but what do they have to fight against this cruel fate that awaits her?\u201cMother, you have gifted me with life. If you die, I will follow you. I will never let you be alone.\u201d Li Tianming was dead serious, and he had always been a man of his words.\u201cNo my child, you have a great future ahead of you.\u201d\u201cMy future is meaningless without you. I\u2019m not giving in to fate, and I will do whatever it takes to fight till my last breath. Promise me, mother, that you won\u2019t give up, that you will stand up against this fate!\u201d If anything, Wei Jing was the one who taught all these to him; only her presence had enabled him to labour through the past three years!\u201cAlright I promise you, I will tell you everything once you enter Heaven\u2019s Sanctum.\u201d She finally picked up her spirit again. Hearing the answer that he wanted, Li Tianming let out a sigh of relief.\u201cMother, I\u2019m telling you we will not take anything from that bitchy Xue Lan. One day, your son will buy you the biggest house, and grab a whole group of maids to serve you,\u201d said Li Tianming.\u201cNo, no, your mother is happy enough when she gets to see you. As long as you are happy, I will be happy no matter how small the house is.\u201d She smiled, reminding Li Tianming of an eighty-year-old child...Ignispolis was huge, so huge that nobody would notice an unfamiliar horse cart crossing the streets. People went about with their own business, and perhaps the only thing that could arise everyone\u2019s interest was the Flameyellow Scions Institute\u2019s entrance exam three days later.But Li Tianming did not know that while they spoke, a man lurked in the shadows around the corner. He watched the cart with a profound look, even following it for a while before stopping, a smile with mixed feelings on his face.\u201cSuch is life\u2026\u2026\u201d He lightly shook his head, before continuing to follow the horse cart.\u2026\u2026Li Tianming sold the horse cart and managed to get thirty spirit gems with orange heavenly patterns in return. There was a mix of crimson gems, golden gems, and other types of gems. It was quite a good sum since all three horses were tamed wildbeasts. If they were regular horses, getting a single spirit gem would already be lucky.The little chick was drooling just by looking at the spirit gems, but they simply couldn\u2019t afford to use it for cultivation. The thirty gems were to sustain them for a good period of time, especially since Wei Jing needed a lot of money, not just for a place to rest but also to buy medicines.As he would attend the exam three days later, Li Tianming found a regular inn and booked a room for a month. There was only one bed for his mother to rest, and Li Tianming only needed a solid floor to cultivate. Ever since he obtained the Aeternal Infernal Body, his system was much stronger, and he could cultivate for days on end without needing to rest.Having settled down in their room, Li Tianming brewed a bowl of medicine with clear spirit grass and fed it to Wei Jing. Before long, Wei Jing fell asleep and he finally had time to cultivate with the little chick.\u201cAhh money, the root of all our problems. Luckily, I had the foresight to borrow Liu Qianyang\u2019s Thunderfire Chain. Push comes to shove, we can sell it for enough money to buy a small house here,\u201d Li Tianming said, a smile on his face.The little chick fretted. \u201cWhat have I done wrong in my past life to deserve this impoverished master?\u201d\u201cWhat happened to going through any kind of difficulties together as brothers?\u201d Li Tianming\u2019s face twitched.\u201cFood before bros. Can\u2019t talk about brotherhood on an empty stomach,\u201d the little chick retaliated.Just as they were joking around, Li Tianming suddenly felt a chill behind his back. He jumped up, realising that a man had silently appeared in a corner of the room. The man wore a loose black robe, and the only observable feature were his sparkling eyes. Apparently, he had observed the two for quite some time without being detected.\u201cShhh, don\u2019t wake her up.\u201d Thankfully the man had no ill intentions, and Li Tianming let down his guard. The man was definitely way stronger than him, considering that neither Li Tianming nor Ying Huo realised his existence until now.\u201cMay I know who you are, sir?\u201d Li Tianming asked.\u201cUnimportant.\u201d The man was studying him from head to toe.\u201cThen what may you be here for, senior?\u201d Li Tianming asked.\u201cLi Tianming, I know you.\u201d The man was smiling slightly.\u201cShould I feel honored?\u201d\u201cDo you know why I know you?\u201d\u201cPlease elaborate.\u201d\u201cBecause I know that the Saintbeast War-Soul was your prize, and it was Lin Xiaoting that took it away from you. Three years ago, your story ended tragically, because you had no background and no support in Ignispolis. Nonetheless, it was you who obtained the Saintbeast War-Soul first, and you are the rightful owner that it recognizes.\u201d The man\u2019s eyes were sharp as he threw out the bomb.Li Tianming jolted when he heard the man talk about the secret he had. Li Tianming had never told anyone about this before, since he knew that the Lightning Manor was influential enough to turn his own words against him.Only when a person makes a breakthrough to the Spiritsource stage would they understand how important the Saintbeast War-Soul was. Simply put, its net value was probably ten times of the wealth of Flamehaven. Lin Xiaoting was never talented enough to become the number one disciple in Heaven\u2019s Sanctum, but the Saintbeast War-Soul had let him achieve that!Becoming a saint beast was the highest level a beast could go, and all of them were accompanied by myths and legends. The War-Souls that they left behind were priceless treasures that could bless a lifebound beast with tremendous power. Just like top grade manna, Saintbeast War-Souls were invaluable treasures that were unobtainable in the market.Words could not even begin to describe how shocked Li Tianming was when someone who knew about his ownership of the War Soul suddenly appeared.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 35": "Chapter 35 - Xing & Chen RepositoryPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cSenior speaks correctly. Not many know of the truth. Do you have any advice for me?\u201d Li Tianming asked respectfully.Indeed, him lacking a backer had been one of the reasons for his failure.\u201cNot really. No one can help you get back what you\u2019ve lost, especially when it\u2019s against Lightning Manor.\u201d Then, he caught sight of Ying Huo, which he stared at for a while. \u201cIt seems I underestimated you. I thought your trip back was meaningless. However, I never expected your new lifebound beast to be a six-star one!\u201dHe must have seen the six stars in the little chick\u2019s eyes. However, he would not expect that the truth actually wasn\u2019t that simple.\u201cIt\u2019s a true miracle to do this with a blood pact. That shows you\u2019re rather lucky, except that you\u2019re still lacking a backer.\u201d The man continued.\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cYou want to take the entrance exam again?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThe exam will be easy. Entering Heaven\u2019s Sanctum is another matter altogether. You\u2019ll most likely need a few years in the institute before you get the chance.\u201d\u201cHow exactly did senior know that was my goal?\u201d Li Tianming suddenly asked.\u201c...\u201d\u201cCould senior have heard my conversation with my mother?\u201d Li Tianming continued that line of questioning.\u201c...\u201d\u201cYour eyes remind me of someone too. Chen Yao from Chen Chateau. Would you happen to be\u2026\u201d\u201cAlright, no need to continue. What a smart kid.\u201d The man chuckled. As soon as he revealed a flaw, Li Tianming had asked a quick three questions that pulled aside the veil of his identity.\u201cSure. I\u2019ll just take it as you\u2019re one of my mother\u2019s friends,\u201d Li Tianming nodded. He knew when to quit. Obviously, the man didn\u2019t want to reveal his identity if he had hidden his face. Furthermore, his first action upon revealing himself was to make Li Tianming not wake up his mother.And most of all, Li Tianming didn\u2019t believe he himself would attract such people.\u201cI feel slightly more relieved now that I\u2019ve seen your new beast. Take good care of your mother.\u201d Now that Li Tianming had guessed his identity, he had become more forthcoming.\u201cShe\u2019s a great person, but also plagued by misfortune. I\u2019ll naturally do whatever I can.\u201d Li Tianming said.\u201cI heard what you said during the day. You\u2019re one filial kid alright.\u201d The man praised. Li Yanfeng, who cursed his son everyday, wouldn\u2019t have agreed... but he didn\u2019t know that. Filial or unfilial, it really depended on the parent.\u201cSenior really was eavesdropping.\u201dThe man spluttered, \u201cDon\u2019t let your mom know I came here today, understood? Otherwise, it\u2019ll be more troublesome for me to help you in the future.\u201d The man gave a solemn reminder.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. My lips are sealed.\u201d Li Tianming hurriedly said. Only an idiot would reject it when this man wanted to help him because of his mother.\u201cMine too!\u201d Ying Huo interjected.\u201cInteresting,\u201d The man nodded before taking out a crimson gem with red heavenly patterns and placing it into Li Tianming\u2019s hand\u201cIt\u2019s kinda stingy for your greeting gift to just be a crimson gem with red heavenly patterns.\u201d The little chick stared. After all, those were the spirit ores of the lowest value.The man chuckled. \u201cThis contains my power. Crush it if you meet trouble you can\u2019t resolve. It\u2019ll help me locate you. However, it\u2019s only good for one use.\u201dLi Tianming had just known there was no way he would be so stingy! He quickly kept it. It was a good item. After all, there were definitely going to be lots of unresolvable troubles on this trip back.\u201cRemember, I can\u2019t help you openly,\u201d the man warned.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, senior. I know the score.\u201d\u201cFine. I wish you luck for the exam. I\u2019ll be going now.\u201d The man was rather satisfied with Li Tianming.With his strength, he could easily vanish in the blink of an eye, so Li Tianming hurriedly shouted, nearly loud enough to wake Wei Jing up, \u201cWait a moment!\u201d\u201cSofter!\u201d The man was rather panicked too.\u201cMy bad,\u201d Li Tianming said.\u201cWhat else is it?\u201d\u201cSenior, any chance I could take a really small loan?\u201d\u201c...\u201d The man stared at Li Tianming with a strange expression, before snorting with amusement. \u201cYour personality is rather like your mom\u2019s while she was younger. Very direct. You don\u2019t beat around the bush, do you?\u201d\u201cThanks. Still, when I make big bucks in the future. I\u2019ll pay you back ten times. Not one cent less. And I\u2019ll do it within a year.\u201d Li Tianming said sincerely.He needed more capital for the entrance exam. And, he needed even more to become the prime disciple. Still, he was really poor now, so he needed money! That was no way he would let the chance pass when such a helper appeared!\u201cWhat if you can\u2019t afford to pay up?\u201d The man\u2019s expression was unreadable.\u201cWell\u2026 You can have the chick, I suppose. It\u2019s like my brother. You can\u2019t place a price on that bond. Losing it will be like losing a part of me.\u201d Li Tianming said righteously.\u201cYou traitor!\u201d The little chick nearly coughed up blood.\u201cI accept the deal.\u201d The man said cheerfully, \u201cSix-star beasts do make rather nourishing soup. Since you\u2019re giving such a good interest rate, I could consider lending more. What\u2019s the most you can handle?\u201d\u201cNo need to be polite. The sky\u2019s the limit!\u201d\u201cPretty gutsy. Take care of it. I\u2019ll be back for debt collection in a year. Let\u2019s see how much you can cough up then.\u201d The man searched his chest area for a little, before tossing a pouch of money onto the ground, where it landed with a loud thud.The two men and one chick flinched.The man hadn\u2019t expected such a loud sound since he was busy talking.They stared at each other, going completely silent until they were certain Wei Jing hadn\u2019t woken up. Finally, they heaved a sigh of relief.\u201cLi Tianming, remember. Ten times!\u201d With those parting words, the man flew out the window.The two left exchanged a look.\u201cQuick!\u201d The chick quickly burrowed into the pouch, before coming back out. It looked pitifully at Li Tianming, \u201cWelp, you\u2019re kaput.\u201d\u201cHow much is there?\u201d Li Tianming asked.\u201cTake a look yourself.\u201dLi Tianming picked it up and opened it, upon which spiritual energy gushed out. He casually took out a crimson gem. It was currently burning at a high temperature and a yellow heavenly pattern was on it!Red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet. Yellow was the third from the bottom. Yellow heavenly markings made it worth ten crimson jades with only orange markings. It was wealth only a Spiritsource beastmaster could use.\u201cAnd there are one thousand of them. You have to return ten thousand in one year! Kaput. You\u2019re done for, Li Tianming.\u201d The little chick looked at him mockingly.\u201cAlright, Ying Huo. In such situations, we need to think this through rationally. Who\u2019s going to become chicken soup if I can\u2019t pay up. Me? Or you?\u201d Li Tianming said solemnly.A shudder ran through the little chick\u2019s body. That\u2019s right, he was the one bound to become soup if Li Tianming failed!\u201cYou\u2019re inhuman, Li Tianming!\u201d The little chick raged.Jokes aside, Li Tianming really hadn\u2019t expected this much wealth. A thousand crimson gems with yellow heavenly patterns was definitely worth a lot. It would help him resolve many troubles.Still, he had his principles. Since he had borrowed it, he would pay it back. He hadn\u2019t been joking when he said he would pay back ten times.These one thousand gems were like charcoal sent during winter, something very much appreciated!Li Tianming was very thankful to that man, even if he couldn\u2019t say the identity he had guessed out loud. Even moreso, he couldn\u2019t let his mother know. She wouldn\u2019t accept it.\u201cGrace accepted today will be paid back another day.\u201d Such kindness shown, especially when he was down on his luck, had to be paid back in spades one day! That was his belief!Their cultivation speed would reach terrifying speeds with this, and it would let him choose some good battle arts. He was clear that what he had wasn\u2019t enough if he wanted to rank high in the exam.The exam had two parts: the admission and ranking tests.The admission test was just to decide if you could join the institute if you passed. After entry, you would receive guidance and enjoy the resources of the Flameyellow Scions Institute.Participation in the ranking test rested on passing the admission test. It would generate a ranking list of the new disciples.Placing first would grant a direct ride to Heaven\u2019s Sanctum. Those that ranked well would also be allocated more resources.However, Li Tianming had barely passed four years ago. His ranking had also been towards the tail-end, so he hadn\u2019t had much resources in the institute. As for Lin Xiaoting, he had clinched first and joined the Sanctum.Li Tianming\u2019s current power would easily let him be admitted. However, the ranking test would be difficult. \u201cI\u2019ll make a trip first to Xing & Chen Repository. They\u2019ll have some good battle arts. When the admission tests start in three days, I\u2019ll need good battle arts to showcase myself.\u201d Li Tianming immediately made a decision.Xing & Chen Repository was the trade and commerce hub Xing & Chen Merchantry had set up in Ignispolis, the largest in the country. The land it took up, a third of Flamehaven, was enough to fit a small city. It was called a \u2018repository\u2019 as it supposedly held anything and everything inside. Li Tianming would find what he needed as long as he had the money.As it was late, he and Ying Huo simply ate the crimson jades to cultivate. The senior likely hadn\u2019t expected they had such an abnormal way of training.The little chick had been peckish for quite a while. They made smooth progress towards the eighth level, enough that Li Tianming had the feeling they would reach it within the three days.The next day, he prepared breakfast for his mother before making his way to Xing & Chen Repository.\u201cI originally thought I was going to sell the Thunderfire Chain. However, if I find a suitable battle art for this grade three weapon, it\u2019s going to be much stronger than the Crimson Blood Dagger.\"The two quickly reached their destination!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 36": "Chapter 36 - Netherfire GhostclawPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWith a thousand crimson gems on him, Li Tianming was bursting with confidence. Since he was young, this was the first time he was so filthy rich!\u201cI borrowed money today to resolve my current difficulties. But I will uphold my promise of paying it back ten times within one year.\u201d Li Tianming etched that into his heart. In life, there were times you needed to be flexible. Being old-fashioned and obstinate was sometimes a kind of stupidity.He had suffered a lot three years ago. So, now that he was Mr Moneybags, he wasn\u2019t going to be mistreating himself! At the Xing & Chen Repository, he would take whatever he wanted, whatever battle art that would enhance the pair's talent to the fullest potential!\u201cBloody Soul Hunt is a supreme beast-ranked art. Perhaps I can crush my opponents in the admission test, but the ranking test will be a struggle. There\u2019ll be many spiritsource geniuses in the ranking tests. They\u2019ll all have trained some source-ranked battle arts.\u201dSource-ranked battle arts were obviously stronger than beast-ranked ones. Mastery of them required aptitude, good fundamentals, as well as sufficient beast ki.Li Tianming reached the repository. Due to its size, it had dozens of entrances, each one servicing an endless stream of customers. Business was especially booming in the lead-up to the Flameyellow Scions Institute entrance exams.However, not many were here for battle arts. The exams were the day after, and there was a limit to how last minute one could be.The seven-storey Many-Battles Pagoda were a small portion of the repository.The pagoda had a wide base, and the floors got narrower the higher you went. The first floor had beast-ranked battle arts for sale, while the second sold source-ranked ones. And the third floor onwards, the even stronger unity-ranked and heavenly-ranked arts were made available.Those weren\u2019t things Li Tianming could handle at his current level. For someone his age, it was likely that only existences like Lin Xiaoting could touch those battle arts from the third floor and above.Someone came to assist Li Tianming as soon as he entered the third floor. The staff of Xing & Tian Repository had undergone professional training and would never judge a customer by their appearance. Ignispolis was a place full of crouching tigers and hidden dragons, and anyone, even ordinary-looking people, could be an expert in disguise.Li Tianming chose to search for battle arts on his own as he wanted to do it at his leisure.Currently, he was satisfied with his Thunderfire Chain. It could be used as a whip or to entangle the opponent. Li Tianming could just imagine how dashing he\u2019ll look in battle with the chain wrapped around his right arm and his black left arm.He was still looking for his own personal weapon, so he was thinking of making an attempt at using a chain.Li Tianming got a rough sensing of the prices after one loop around the premises. \u201cFor source-ranked battle arts, the basic level goes for fifty yellow-marked jades, while the intermediate arts goes for two hundred. It\u2019s really pricey.\u201dHe had thought the thousand yellow-marked jades he brought were more than enough, but it turned out he would likely only be able to buy a few battle arts. \u201cAnd the advanced ones are even more expensive. I\u2019m still in the Beast Vein stage, so I better not bite off more than I can chew.\u201dHis worry wasn\u2019t the inability to master it, but rather insufficient beast ki. It wouldn\u2019t matter how strong the battle art was then. Intermediate source-ranked battle arts was probably his limit for now. Historically, it was the rough ceiling for those who had ranked in the top ten for the entrance exams.Li Tianming had gone through the exam before, so he chose to pick a movement art first. Movement arts were among the cheaper options and the one he picked was worth fifty yellow-marked jades.\u201cConfounding Mirage Walk. Intermediate source-ranked battle art. Creates illusionary clones that can confound opponents. Masks the user\u2019s presence, blurring the boundary between truth and falsehood. \u201dThis movement art was split into both a martial and beastial art, so the duo could both train in it. It was much better than Li Tianming\u2019s Ghost Steps.Li Tianming continued on. Before he found a good battle art for his chain, he found a claw art. His left hand was now like a beast\u2019s claw that was sharper than even beastial weapons. Hence, he wanted to follow that path of development a little. It would also be useful for the little chick\u2019s tiny but fearsome claws.\u201cNetherfire Ghostclaw. Intermediate source-ranked battle art. Cultivate Netherfire within the claw. The Netherfire is venomous whilst the Ghostclaw is incisive. Claw-type beastial weapons are necessary for usage. The complementing beastial art can be used by the majority of lifebound beasts, especially avian species. Once wounded, Netherfire will burn ceaselessly until nothing is left!\u201dLi Tianming had seen a senior in the institute use this before. While the description was vague, it was definitely very strong.For this particular battle art, it was a case of the beastial art being superior to the martial art, making it good for the little chick.\u201cThis is pretty expensive. It\u2019s a hundred and fifty!\u201d It was thrice the Confounding Mirage Walk\u2019s price despite being the same rank! Still, its offensive power was amongst the best of intermediate source-ranked battle arts.Ten yellow-marked jades were enough to last an ordinary person a lifetime. So this Netherfire Ghostclaw could last fifteen lifetimes! If not for that mysterious man\u2019s help, Li Tianming wouldn\u2019t have been able to purchase it even if he sold himself.\u201cI\u2019ll take it.\u201d Now that he had dough, he had to be willing to spend it no matter how much it hurt, so that he could join Heaven\u2019s Sanctum.The Many-Battles Pagoda had all sorts of battle arts, from sabres to spears, swords and halberds. However, chains and whips were a more unique weapon. Other stores might not even stock the related battle arts, and the Pagoda didn\u2019t have the greatest variety either. Still, he managed to find two suitable ones after some comparison.\u201cSkyfire Soulbinder. Intermediate source-ranked battle art. Hundred yellow-ranked jades. Suitable for whip and chain-type beastial weapons. The weapon dances like Skyfire, capable of locking down an opponent. Once caught, extricating themselves is a difficult task.\u201dThis battle art wasn\u2019t an offensive art, but Li Tianming valued its ability for crowd control. Its price was also representative of its power. However, Li Tianming placed even more value on the other art.\u201cNine Flying Bolts. Intermediate source-ranked battle art. Hundred and seventy yellow-ranked jades. Composed of nine consecutive whip strikes, each fiercer than the last. Striking like a rain of lightning, this art is unblockable and matchless in power amongst intermediate source-ranked battle arts!\u201dIt was even more expensive than the Netherfire Ghostclaw and was close in price to some advanced source-ranked battle arts, a testament to its power.Although the four battle arts Li Tianming had his eyes on were pricey, he had long since decided to go for broke.\u201cFour hundred and seventy yellow-marked jade! You actually spent half of what you just borrowed a day ago. What a wastrel,\u201d Ying Huo said, feeling pained. The more Li Tianming spent, the less it could eat.\u201cIf you prattle on some more, I\u2019ll be having you for dinner.\u201dConfounding Mirage Walk, Netherfire Ghostclaw, Skyfire Soulbinder and the Nine Flying Bolts!Li Tianming had bought a movement art, a crowd control art and two attack arts for the black arm and Thunderfire Chain. This was the best selection he could make.The Confounding Mirage Walk and Netherfire Ghostclaw were enough for the little chick, while it wasn\u2019t able to train in Skyfire Soulbinder and Nine Flying Bolts.\u201cWhat a waste, buying stuff I can\u2019t use!\u201d Ying Huo jabbered.\u201cHey, don\u2019t blame me if your whip is too short. You could train in the Nine Flying Bolts if you were the Lightning Bolt Cheetah\u2019s size.\u201d Li Tianming teased.\u201cAre you mocking me?!\u201d The little chick continued its racket in the lifebound beast space.\u201cHey, be careful! Don\u2019t step on your siblings!\u201d Li Tianming chuckled. He examined them briefly. That one egg had increased in activity recently, but it still hadn\u2019t hatched. He was getting impatient.\u201cWill I become a twin beastmaster when it hatches?\u201d Li Tianming was feeling rather expectant. A twin beastmaster referred to those who were gifted with two lifebound beasts when they were born. It didn\u2019t just provide a quantity increase, but a fundamental change to the symbiotic system.A twin beastmaster would receive the benefits of two beasts cultivating. Hence, they would be much stronger than their peers in the same level. For example, in ninth level Beast Vein, a twin beastmaster would have a total of twenty-seven beasts veins, as compared to an ordinary beastmaster\u2019s eighteen.Nine beasts veins allowed storing more beasts ki. The beastmaster\u2019s beast veins would also have received two remouldings from their beasts, making it stronger again.And most of all, a twin beastmaster against a normal beastmaster would always be a three versus two.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 37": "Chapter 37 - Twin BeastmasterPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIn fact, all the twin beastmasters were well-known experts, and they often lived their whole life under the spotlight. Anyone would envy a twin beastmaster, and Li Tianming was no different. But he never imagined that he could become one himself one day. Not just that, he still had nine eggs that were unhatched, which marked him as an up-and-coming decuplet beastmaster. Just the thought of having ten lifebound beasts was overwhelming.In Vermilion Bird\u2019s history existed sagas of triplet beastmasters, and even then, those were just myths with no concrete evidence. Having ten lifebound beasts was out of anyone\u2019s imagination. The only thing Li Tianming knew for sure was that his body would be completely modified by the bloodline of his ten beasts, and his strength would also be the sum of the ten. Such were the benefits of symbiotic cultivation, where the numbers and grade of the lifebound beasts determined the talent of their masters.As for why Li Tianming knew so much about twin beastmasters, it was because he personally knew one of them. That person was none other than his foe Lin Xiaoting, famous for commanding two lifebound beasts!\u201cThis is just the first step of my revenge.\u201d Li Tianming looked at the four battle arts in his hands. It was only going to get tougher from here on, but he was ready for the challenge.Mu Qingqing was in this city too. Four years ago, they arrived at Ignispolis together, helping each other out and clearing the entrance exam together. Li Tianming thought those were the happiest days of his life. But he could never expect that the woman he trusted the most betrayed him for wealth and power, stabbing him in the back together with Lin Xiaoting.He hated Lin Xiaoting, and of course he hated Mu Qingqing. He was no saint, and would not hide his yearning to kill them both. There was no room for negotiation around that, as that was the only way he could honor his brother, Midas, who had fought alongside him for more than a decade. The goldroc was never as lively or as talented as the little chick, but Li Tianming knew that he owed it its life. Every feather that was torn out from Midas on that stormy night was like a dagger that stabbed straight into Li Tianming\u2019s heart. If only he had not trusted the wrong person, if only he was strong enough\u2026Li Tianming stood still in the Xing & Chen Repository as the waves of flashbacks and memories hit him. It has been three years, and he had finally returned to this city. He was nearing them, and they might even meet during the entrance exam two days later!\u201cLi Tianming?\u201d While he was still deep in thought, Li Tianming heard someone mention his name. He quickly set his memories aside and was surprised to see some familiar faces.Standing behind him was a brilliant-looking boy surrounded by a group of youths of the same age, all of them studying Li Tianming. He was none other than the young master of this Xing & Chen Repository, Sage Chen\u2019s youngest son Chen Yao. They had just met at Chen Chateau yesterday.\u201cYou know my name?\u201d Li Tianming recalled that he didn\u2019t introduce himself during yesterday\u2019s meeting.\u201cOf course, you have quite the reputation around here.\u201dChen Yao replied with a grin, causing the group to snicker.\u201cMost people around here know your stories, although if you hadn\u2019t returned, they would have forgotten about you by now,\u201d said one of the girls beside Chen Yao.\u201cYing\u2019er, don\u2019t be so rude to brother Tianming. It\u2019s not easy for scum like him to muster the courage to come back and make a fool of himself.\u201d A hulking boy about the height of two meters laughed. The group of them were all younger than Li Tianming, perhaps around Liu Qianyang\u2019s age.Li Tianming didn\u2019t expect his name to be so well-known. It seemed that Lin Xiaoting had put in a lot of effort to defame him.\u201cChen Ying, Chen Ding, don\u2019t mock him. If he ever decides to take his own life in shame, you are all accountable.\u201d Chen Yao smiled.\u201cBrother Yao must have underestimated him. His face was thick enough for him to not die of shame three years ago after the atrocities he committed,\u201d Chen Ying muttered, causing the group to chuckle again. It was sad to see kids from reputable families being brought up like this, Li Tianming thought.Chen Yao walked towards Li Tianming, and spoke in a threatening tone, \u201cWas that granny yesterday your mother? What a hideous sight, don\u2019t you ever bring her near my mother again. Not only do you dirty Chen Chateau, you are also besmirching our reputations.\u201dLi Tianming could never tolerate anyone speaking bad of his mother. While he initially held no hostility towards this young master, he had changed his mind after these words. Then again, the both of them wanted to compete for the slot to Heaven\u2019s Sanctum, making the two of them rivals during the entrance exam.\u201cChen Yao, remember that there are some things that should never be said. You never know when you will be regretting them,\u201d said Li Tianming.\u201cWhat, you mean that I\u2019ll regret looking down on you and your dying mother?\u201d Chen Yao was cracking up. As for the group behind him, they were already rolling around in laughter, as if Li Tianming was some kind of clown.\u201cThink what you want, but you will see for yourself what I mean soon.\u201d Li Tianming said, unaffected by the taunts. After all the things he had gone through, he was no longer affected by insults like these. Li Tianming knew better than anyone, that the best way to retaliate was to trounce them when the right opportunity arrived. What was the fun in beating them now, when he could do so during the entrance exam in front of thousands of audience, and crush his hope of entering Heaven's Sanctum?\u201cIs this a challenge?\u201d Chen Yao looked at Li Tianming as if he was some kind of an idiot.\u201cWhat a poor thing. It looks like the accident three years ago had permanently damaged his brain.\u201d Chen Ying said.\u201cBrother Yao, what do you think this fool is doing in the repository? Look at the four battle arts in his hand, do you reckon he might be here to steal?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right, this is the source-ranked battle art area, each of these is worth a fortune! There\u2019s no way he can afford all four of those!\u201d The youths were not joking when they said that, and it would have been true if it wasn\u2019t for the mysterious man\u2019s help.\u201cDon\u2019t let him take them, someone, chase this thief out of the repository!\u201d Chen Ying urged.\u201cJust chasing him away is enough? We better teach him a lesson,\u201d Chen Ding commented.They thought they were acting clever, and it was true that they had the backing to. But in Li Tianming\u2019s eyes, such arrogance and insolence would never get them anywhere in life.At the young master\u2019s words, a bunch of guards closed in on Li Tianming, ready to pounce on him anytime.\u201cThief?\u201d Li Tianming snorted at their imagination. He couldn\u2019t be bothered with these immature kids, especially not when he was in their territory. His main goal for the day was to select battle arts for himself. There were ample opportunities to shut those brats up after he mastered them.Li Tianming walked towards the counter. Naturally, the cashiers had witnessed the happenings too, and were watching him closely. While the exit may be right beside the counter, Li Tianming would be naive if he thought he could make a run for it. The Xing & Chen Repository was filled with trained experts who could take down Li Tianming within seconds.At the center of everyone\u2019s attention, Li Tianming handed the battle arts to the cashier. \u201cThat\u2019s all, please pack it up.\u201dThe cashiers were probably thinking of the same things as the youths, and one of them said, \u201cSir, do you know what\u2019s the consequences of messing with Xing & Chen Repository?\u201d\u201cHuh, is this how you treat your customers. How eye-opening.\u201d As he spoke, Li Tianming drew out his pouch, emptying its contents onto the counter. The yellow patterned crimson gems splattered across the table, and Li Tianming only stopped pouring after he counted four hundred and seven gems.Li Tianming smiled.\u201cI pay for what I want, no? If this is considered as \u2018messing around\u2019, then the repository will have quite a lot of people to deal with.\u201dThe moment Li Tianming started pouring out the crimson gems, the cashiers were already bemused. That applied to Chen Yao\u2019s group as well, who were ready to see Li Tianming make a fool out of himself, but now, they were just standing there stupidly.Li Tianming was amused. Of course he would not tell Chen Yao that the money in his pouch right now all came from Chen Yao\u2019s father.\u201cPack it up and stop wasting my time,\u201d Li Tianming reemphasized.\u201cYes, please give us a moment.\u201d The Xing & Chen Repository had strict regulations, and even the young master couldn't stop Li Tianming as long as the latter followed all the rules. In fact, Chen Yao himself would have to pay for what he wanted in full sum, as the Xing & Chen Merchantry wasn\u2019t Sage Chen\u2019s personal business, but instead a union run by a varied group of people.Chen Yao and friends could only watch as Li Tianming walked past them with the four battle arts that he paid for.\u201cThese are at least intermediate source-ranked arts, what use do you have for them, to fuel your stove?\u201d Chen Yao had heard from his mother that Li Tianming was only seventh level Beast Vein.Li Tianming turned around with a smile and said, \u201cOf course, please drop by and try my cooking once I\u2019m done. Better not piss yourself after trying it.\u201d Before the rest could react, he had already left the building.\u201cGosh, why would he dare taunt brother again, just what is he thinking\u2026\u201d Chen Ying found it unbelievable.\u201cForget it, we shouldn\u2019t lower ourselves to his standard.\u201d Chen Yao shook his head. In hindsight, some of the things he said today weren\u2019t that appropriate, and reflected poorly of him. After all, why should a lion bother himself with a mere cripple?\u2026\u2026It was already noon when Li Tianming returned to the inn. He wasted no time and started cultivating immediately, chewing on crimson gems while the little chick guided their cultivation. Li Tianming himself made use of this time to study the battle arts as well, since he was running on a very tight schedule.After using over a hundred yellow patterned crimson gems, Li Tianming and the chick had finally made it to the eighth level of the beast vein stage. As for their small loan, only four hundred gems remained. Cultivation was costly business indeed, but at least they were putting the money to good use.Before long, the day of the entrance exam had arrived, and it was time to put their skills to test.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 38": "Chapter 38 - Flameyellow StadiumPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe Flameyellow Scions Institute was the most reputable school for beastmasters in the entire Vermilion Bird, with a history even richer than the nation itself. It wasn\u2019t just a place for learning and cultivation, but a symbol of strength and talent. To Li Tianming\u2019s knowledge, even powerhouses like the Lightning Manor, the Xing & Chen Merchantry, and even the Vermilion Bird Clan, the royal family, had to pay their respects to the institute.Throughout the nation\u2019s history, countless princes and princesses of the nation had spent their youth in the institute. Word on the streets was that the institute had such influence because it had backing beyond anyone's imagination. And at the center of the institute, it was rumored that Heaven's Sanctum was its true ruler.Needless to say, the institute had nurtured endless generations of beastmasters in Vermilion Bird. It occupied almost half of the northern district of the capital, its dimensions even greater than that of the imperial palace.Today was the day of the quadrennial entrance exam, and Li Tianming had arrived at the break of dawn. Even then, the place was already packed to the brim.\u201cIt\u2019s just the admission test and not the ranking test, and there\u2019s already so many people here. This is way more crowded than four years ago.\u201d It wasn\u2019t just the owners of Flameyellow Orders that were waiting here, but many more parents and servants as well. The sheer number of cultivators present there was a mark of Ignispolis\u2019s robustness and prosperity.The gate of the institute was not as magnificent as people would expect it to be. The simple design, with only stone slabs used in its construction, gave the gate a timeworn vibe. As simple as it may be, the gate was a reflection of the institute\u2019s rich heritage, the goal for any and all beastmasters in the nation.Four years ago, Li Tianming arrived before this gate, eager to study as a disciple of the institute. And today, he stood at the exact same spot, but with a completely different emotion. He knew that the two people who destroyed his life three years ago were crowned as the best disciples of the institute. They would never imagine that Li Tianming was back to haunt them.The admission test should be quite simple for Li Tianming. All he needed to do was to join the queue and display his Flameyellow Order, and after registering his name with the counter he could enter the compound to prepare for the test.There were a total of five registration counters outside of the institute, each of them with a long queue of people. Li Tianming took a look around, and found most people in the queue to be teenagers about the age of fifteen, eager about their future as a disciple of the institute.Li Tianming was lucky that his birthday was next month. Had the exam been held a month later, he would be disqualified for being over the age of twenty.Out of the five counters, Li Tianming picked the counter for the Hall of Phoenix. Other than the exclusive Heaven\u2019s Sanctum, the Flameyellow Scions Institute was split into five different halls, the five being the Hall of Manibeasts, Hall of Phoenix, Hall of Deepblue, Hall of Rudiment and the Hall of Uniquities. They recruited disciples with terrestrial, avian, fish, bug and unique lifebound beasts respectively.The phoenix was crowned the king of all avian beasts, and that was where the Hall of Phoenix got its name from. Together with the Hall of Manibeasts, the two halls had the richest heritage and also the largest intakes of disciples.The Hall of Phoenix recruited exactly five hundred disciples each time but there were more than one thousand five hundred youths aiming to register under the hall this year. That means only less than a third of the youths could get in.As the queue shortened and it was soon to be Li Tianming\u2019s turn, he was pleasantly surprised to see that the people manning the counter was none other than his old classmates from four years ago. After losing his lifebound beast, Li Tianming was no longer able to cultivate and therefore he left the campus. As for his old classmates, they should have made it into the journeyman class by now.Every four years, the institute would take in a new batch of disciples and the previous batch would graduate into their next class after clearing certain requirements. There were three different levels of classes, the apprentice class, journeyman class and elite class, each of them lasting for four years. After twelve years of study, the students could either choose to graduate or to apply to be a teacher of the institute should they qualify. Being a teacher in the institute was a prestigious position that most disciples of the elite class sought after.During these three years that Li Tianming was away, the classmates in his batch had cultivated hard and probably made it to the journeyman class with Spiritsource stage already. Those who haven\u2019t cleared the requirements would be retained in the apprentice class.In the institute, being retained was an extremely disgraceful thing. Not only would you waste another four years of precious youth, you would also be a laughing stock to people around you. The institute also ruled that students could only retain once, and those who failed to clear the requirements a second time would be expelled from the institute.The two students manning the counter right now had both cultivated alongside Li Tianming for a year. But they had moved onto the journeyman class and were Li Tianming\u2019s seniors now, tasked with the role of registering thousands of youths with the Flameyellow Order.Li Tianming still remembered their names, but wasn\u2019t so sure whether they still remembered his own. The boy was called Fang Zhao, and the girl Lin Qingyu.After approximately two hours of queuing, it was finally Li Tianming\u2019s turn. He handed over his Flameyellow Order, and filled his name on the form. Both Fang Zhao and Lin Qingyu were focused on the paperwork and did not notice Li Tianming at first.\u201cNext, Li Tianming of Flamehaven.\u201d Fang Zhao read off the name list, and was visibly confused for a moment. And when he finally looked up and saw Li Tianming\u2019s face, a perplexed look crept up his face.\u201cLi Tianming, it\u2019s you?\u201d Lin Qingyu was dressed in an orange robe, beads of sweat flowing down her head from the burning heat.Back then, everyone were newbies from faraway cities, and they helped each other as much as they could. Li Tianming could still remember when Fang Zhao was bullied by others because of his timid personality, and he was the one that helped Fang Zhao fight back. But there was no joy of reunion on the two\u2019s faces right now, only shock.\u201cTianming, are you serious?\u201d Lin Qianyu must have thought of the scandal three years ago as she questioned.Li Tianming smiled. \u201cWhy not? I\u2019m still qualified for the exam, and I did manage to get the Flameyellow Order from Flamehaven again. The school didn\u2019t regulate that I can\u2019t take the entrance exam a second time.\u201d\u201cBut you lifebound beast is dead!\u201d Fang Zhao looked up, a deep frown on his face. \u201cIt\u2019s been three years. Did you know how much our class got laughed at because of you during these three years? If you are still going to mess around here we will have no choice but to chase you away.\u201d\u201cFor what reason? I am qualified, just register my name already.\u201d Li Tianming was as calm as ever. After all the things that have happened, he was used to being treated like this.\u201cHow can I let someone without a lifebound beast in? Li Tianming, three years have passed and we are already in journeyman class now. If you still want to screw around, don\u2019t expect us to show mercy just because we used to be classmates.\u201d Fang Zhao threatened.\u201cOh, so a senior from journeyman class now, how terrific.\u201d Li Tianming raised his thumb.\u201cLast chance, are you leaving or not?\u201d Fang Zhao didn\u2019t want to entertain his old classmate any further.\u201cQingyu, do you think the same way?\u201d Li Tianming turned to the girl.Lin Qingyu bit her lips, and said after a while, \u201cNever mind, I have no reason to reject you. You have the Flameyellow Order and I have information here that yours is valid, so you may enter. \u201d\u201cQingyu, why are letting this joker in\u2026...\u201d Fang Zhao was clearly not happy about it.\u201cAnd what does that have to do with you?\u201d Li Tianming chipped in.\u201cLi Tianming how dare you! Don\u2019t forget the difference between us now!\u201d Fang Zhao shot up from his seat. After three years of cultivation, he was way stronger than what he used to be.\u201cAwesome, please do show me our \u2018differences\u2019 when I\u2019m free next time.\u201d Li Tianming was not going to waste his time on Fang Zhao, as he cleared the registration and walked into the institute.\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for my task here, I would have shown you what three years of cultivation looks like, you perverted scum!\u201d Fang Zhao couldn\u2019t leave his post as there were still hundreds of people queuing in front of his table, so he could only curse behind Li Tianming\u2019s back.Li Tianming wasn\u2019t going to react to that. Such people would remain as wimps, no matter what their cultivation level was, and Li Tianming had nothing to fear. He could only lament the time they used to study as a class, and wonder whether the rest of his class would treat him the same way as Fang Zhao did.Li Tianming followed the crowd into the gates, where the first thing that entered his sight was the landmark of the institute: the Flameyellow Stadium! Not only was it the place where disciples honed their battling skills, it also staged all kinds of major events, one of them being the famous ranking test.Inside of the stadium, hundreds of stone arenas were placed beside each other, every single one covered with damage from prior battles. The stadium was enclosed by a cyclic stand with hundreds of thousands of seats meant for spectators. All of the institute's trials were open to the public, and it was quite a common hobby for the rich and famous of Ignispolis to spectate a battle here. Of course, regular citizens could also purchase a ticket and witness the glories of the disciples here.Other than the open-aired seats, the stadium had hundreds of private rooms meant for the elites of the nation. These rooms had a better angle than regular seats and could see all the arenas clearly.Throughout Flameyellow Scions Institute\u2019s history, countless heroes had their tale begin in this very stadium, and simply standing in this stadium could make any disciple\u2019s blood boil. Today\u2019s admission test, as well as the ranking test to be held soon, were all to be conducted here.As Li Tianming entered the stadium, he could see plenty of people seated in the stand already, most of them being parents or seniors of those taking the test. He expected some private rooms to be occupied by big shots as well. That being said, the admission test wasn\u2019t as big an event as the ranking test, so the stadium would only be more busy during the ranking test.However, Li Tianming would never imagine that there were two very familiar faces sitting in the spectator stands right now. They were a couple, a stately middle-aged man with a gorgeous woman by his side. The woman was especially eye-catching, her seductive figure drawing the attention of those sitting around them.Had Li Tianming noticed them, he would recognize them at once. They were none other than Li Yanfeng and Liu Qing.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It may be difficult for him to make it to Heaven\u2019s Sanctum, but at his level he definitely outshines most others here.\u201d Liu Qing said with Li Yanfeng\u2019s hands in hers.\u201cThen all is well. Qianyang sure is a good kid.\u201d Li Yanfeng nodded.\u201cHe couldn\u2019t have reached this step without you. Your connections that let him take the slot for Zirrihaven\u2019s Flameyellow Order this time really saved him.\u201d Liu Qing hugged him even closer to her.\u201cDon\u2019t mention it.\u201d Li Yanfeng screwed up his eyes, trying to find Liu Qianyang amongst the crowd.\u201cYanfeng, ever since my father passed away from an accident, my family lost our footing in the Lightning Manor. Now that you are part of the family too, our whole family will have to depend on you.\u201d Liu Qing said tenderly.\u201cOf course. You are my wife and this is the least I can do for you.\u201d Li Yanfeng smiled as he ran his hand through her hair. The pair was drawing plenty of attention from others, especially the envious looks targeted at Li Yanfeng. That made Li Yanfeng even more reassured about his past decisions. He had gained a beautiful wife and also power in Ignispolis, and things could only get better from there on.\u201cOh, that Li Tianming will definitely be here right? How will he react when he realises that for this year\u2019s test, they will be testing the lifebound beast\u2019s grade first?\u201d Liu Qing frowned when she thought of that youth that gave them so much trouble.\u201cWhat a waste of a Flameyellow Order. A one-star lifebound beast appearing on the Flameyellow Stadium will only make him a bigger joke than he already is.\u201d Li Yanfeng said with a straight face.\u201cThankfully you have already cut all ties with that brute, or he would have spoiled your reputation as well.\u201d\u201cHm.\u201dLi Yanfeng nodded in agreement. Coincidentally, he spotted Li Tianming in the crowds at the same time.\u201cYanfeng, what are you looking at ?\u201d Liu Qing asked curiously when she saw Li Yanfeng squinting his eyes.\u201cLook there.\u201d Li Yanfeng pointed Li Tianming out.\u201cSo he really is here. Looks like we can anticipate a good show with his one-star lifebound beast.\u201d Liu Qianyang snickered sinisterly.Li Yanfeng did not react. Even after cutting ties with Li Tianming, he was still worried that his own reputation would be harmed if Li Tianming made a fool of himself.\u2026\u2026The Flameyellow Stadium was split into five different sections, for the five different halls to do their respective tests. A brief look told Li Tianming that the Hall of Phoenix and Hall of Manibeasts had the most people.He had received the pamphlet specifying the rules of the admission test. The test was split into two segments, the first being a test of the lifebound beast\u2019s grade and cultivation level. The beast\u2019s cultivation level was bound to its master\u2019s, and was tested by measuring the beast ki of the beast.Out of the one thousand six hundred students reporting under Hall of Phoenix, only a thousand of them could make it into the next segment, the practical test. The practical test was conducted by pitting a pair of disciples against each other, and the teachers of Hall of Phoenix would then grade the disciples accordingly. Winning wasn\u2019t necessary to clear this segment, as the teachers considered factors such as age, talent and resilience when grading. This made sure that all decisions made were unbiased and justified when they picked the final five hundred people who could make it into the hall.Out of these two segments, each would eliminate around five hundred students, meaning that holding a Flameyellow Order did not guarantee a place in the institute. The rules were about the same in the four other halls, the only part differing being the final intake. The Hall of Manibeasts recruited five hundred, the Hall of Deepblue three hundred, and the other two halls recruited only two hundred disciples each.Only when disciples cleared the two segments of the test would they be an official member of the institute, marking them as the most exceptional youths of the nation in the past four years. Considering that there were more than two thousand cities the size of Flamehaven in Vermilion Bird, it was an honor for a city to produce just one Flameyellow disciple.For Li Tianming, both segments were no kick, and he just wished for his turn to be done and over with.\u201cMy only demerit is my age, and that can lose me quite a lot of marks. After all, if I\u2019m fighting someone of the same level but five years younger than me, the teachers may still fail me.\u201d Li Tianming thought to himself.......A short while later, the five halls have moved on with the first segment of the test. At the corner allotted to the Hall of Phoenix, the invigilators for the test were ten \u2018chief mentors\u2019. The chief mentors had more power and experience than the regular teachers of the institute, and each of them was in charge of an entire class. For example, in the Hall of Phoenix, the five hundred new students would be split into ten different apprentice classes under the ten respective chief mentors. Each chief mentor would then assign regular teachers or senior students to teach them the various aspects of cultivation.Four years ago, Li Tianming joined one of the ten apprentice classes, the Muwan class, named after their chief mentor, Mu Wan. Both Fang Zhao and Lin Qingyu used to be part of the Muwan class with him.Li Tianming wasn\u2019t surprised to see her as one of the invigilators today. Chief Mentor Mu Wan was a dream date for many in the institute, her figure tall and alluring. It was said that her strength was inestimable, and she would only get more suitors if it wasn\u2019t for her strict personality and her icy expressions.It had been four years and the Muwan class had entered the journeyman class, which was why she would be recruiting new disciples today. Chief mentor was one of the most prestigious positions in the institute, and there were only thirty of them in the Hall of Phoenix. Rumors had it that all the chief mentors, Mu Wan herself included, were graduates from the exclusive Heaven\u2019s Sanctum.Li Tianming always had a good impression of Chief Mentor Mu Wan, who had helped him greatly during his cultivation. During the incident three years ago, she didn\u2019t despise Li Tianming like most other people did, but instead asked him if he needed any help. She was also the one who suggested he leave the institute voluntarily, and helped him settle the paperwork. Without her, he would be expelled from the institute instead, which would have banned him from the institute for the rest of his life.\u201cEvery single disciple will have to go through the admission test and join one of the apprentice classes. The ranking test only happens after that, so I better join the Muwan class first before thinking about joining the sanctum.\u201d Li Tianming had come to a decision.Then again, Chief Mentor Mu Wan was the most popular among the boys. Even as she seated cross-legged at the invigilator\u2019s table, her face as expressionless as usual, her fair and slim legs were enough to make the boys drool.\u201cOh Li Tianming, your lust is leading you astray.\u201d The little chick and him knew what each other was thinking about, even if it was still in his lifebound space.\u201cScrew off, I\u2019m being grateful for everything she did for me.\u201d Li Tianming was keeping a poker face.\u201cHa, then why are you looking at her legs?\u201d\u201cWell, everyone\u2019s looking at it, so why can\u2019t I?\u201d Li Tianming claimed righteously.As he was chatting with the little chick, Li Tianming could suddenly sense two people glaring at him. He turned around to find a bulky teenager with a girl much smaller than his size.\u201cLi Tianming, what are you doing here?\u201d Chen Ding scoffed, with Chen Ying standing beside him. Li Tianming knew them from the encounter at the Xing & Chen Repository, but didn\u2019t expect to see these two here. Since they were both queuing for Hall of Phoenix, it implied that their lifebound beasts were avians as well.Li Tianming shrugged.\u201cWhat, am I not welcome here?\u201d\u201cIsn't your lifebound beast dead? Don\u2019t tell me you used a blood pact to get yourself a rubbish wildbeast.\u201d\u201cKudos for getting it right on the first guess.\u201d Li Tianming gave him a thumbs up.\u201cDo you really know no shame? How dare you bring a filthy beast obtained using a blood pact into the Flameyellow Scions Institute?\u201d Chen Ying chimed in at one side.\u201cAnd aren\u2019t you overaged?\u201d Chen Ding\u2019s expressions turned even fiercer.\u201cStop sticking your nose into other people\u2019s business. My presence here means I\u2019m qualified and that\u2019s all you need to know, so just shut up and leave me alone.\u201d Li Tianming had enough of these two rude brats.\u201cAre you looking for a fight?!\u201d That was enough to enrage Chen Ding.\u201cIf you attack me here, it\u2019s you that\u2019ll get thrown out of the institute by the chief mentors.\u201d Li Tianming sneered.\u201cI will deal with you Li Tianming, mark my words. Brother Yao may not bother himself with trash like you, but I\u2019m a lot less forgiving. I can crush you the moment you step out of the campus.\u201d Chen Ding growled like an infuriated beast.\u201cHow brainless of you to provoke the Chen family,\u201d said Chen Ying.\u201cSorry, what did you say? My ears automatically filter out the voices of clowns.\u201d Li Tianming laughed. In terms of trash-talking, Li Tianming was just way better. If it wasn\u2019t for Chen Ying stopping him, Chen Ding would really have attacked Li Tianming by now, which will likely result in his own expulsion.\u201cNot happy with being called a clown? How about you take a good look in the mirror?\u201d Li Tianming added.\u201cWhat about yourself, a pervert who tried to drug others? Have you no shame at all?\u201d Chen Ying scolded while still held on to Chen Ding.\u201cSo you do remember my hobbies! Then you\u2019d better watch out, because young ladies like you are my preference.\u201d Li Tianming leered at Chen Ying, causing her to shriek in terror. Chen Ding\u2019s vessels were close to bursting, but there was nothing he could do.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. With your looks, it\u2019ll be a waste of my drugs anyway.\u201d Li Tianming shrugged, before walking off in a much better mood after teasing those two brats, leaving the two cursing and swearing behind.Li Tianming was more concerned about the test, as it was about to be his turn soon. The procedures were rather simple. Each chief mentor had a special spirit ore known as the \u2018star orb\u2019, which was capable of detecting the grade of lifebound beasts. While this could have been done by just looking at the number of stars in their eyes, the star orb was much more precise.When their blood dripped onto the star orb, the orb would change its color to reflect the lifebound beast\u2019s grade. There were a total of seven different colors: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet, corresponding to lifebound beasts from one-star to seven-stars. It would also split each grade into three different tiers. For example, a lighter shade of blue would represent a low-tier five-star beast while a darker blue would represent a high-tier five-star beast. This wouldn\u2019t be possible from just looking at the number of stars in their eyes.After that, the chief mentor would also test the stage and level of cultivation the beasts were at by personally inspecting the beast. From what Li Tianming could see, any lifebound beast below five-stars had been rejected, no matter their level of cultivation. It was a new rule added this year that made the selection even more stringent.Just then, a commotion sparked in the stadium, coming from the Hall of Manibeasts. Even from where he was, Li Tianming could see the dark blue light shining from that direction.\u201cChen Yao, your lifebound beast is the Hex-starred Clinquant Lion, a high-tier six-star lifebound beast at third level of the Spiritsource stage!\u201d That statement sent the crowd exclaiming in envy. So far, he had the highest level of cultivation as well as the highest grade lifebound beast.Chen Yao stood at the center of attention, an undisturbed smile on his face. It was as if he had anticipated the reaction as one of the most talented youths in the nation.\u201cHow amazing!\u201d\u201cLike father, like son. Sage Chen must be proud of him.\u201dThe Chen siblings caught up with Li Tianming moments later, and Chen Ying laughed, \u201dDo you see that Li Tianming? Look at the difference, and big brother is just sixteen!\u201dBut Li Tianming couldn\u2019t be bothered with her, because he was the next in line at Chief Mentor Mu Wan\u2019s table.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 40": "Chapter 40 - A Dazzling Radiance!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayFew people paid attention when Li Tianming first approached Chief Mentor Mu Wan. For example, in one of the private rooms, the ladies of the Chen Chateau were still absorbed in their boasting. This group were made up of gorgeous, distinguished women, led by none other than Sage Chen\u2019s wife, Madam Xue Lan. All of their husbands were big-shots from Xing & Chen Merchantry, making them some of the most affluent women in Ignispolis.\u201cSister Lan is such a natural with kids. Both your sons are so talented and handsome \u2014 if only my son could take a leaf out of their book.\u201d\u201cChen Hao and Chen Yao must have charmed so many girls in Ignispolis.\u201dAs usual, Xue Lan was enjoying all the flattery foisted upon her, her smug posture suggesting that this was the exact lifestyle she had sought after.\u201cYou all may envy me, but you have no idea how much I have sacrificed for the family, taking care of the boys and a busy husband.\u201d Xue Lan said with a smile.\u201cOf course, every successful man has a woman standing behind him!\u201d\u201cI just wish Yao\u2019er can do his best and perform up to standards. Then when he gets first place for the ranking test, he can enter Heaven\u2019s Sanctum and cultivate together with Hao\u2019er.\u201d Xue Lan was looking into the stadium, and her eyes were filled with hope for her children.\u201cSister Lan has nothing to worry about, with Yao\u2019er\u2019s talent he can definitely get first place.\u201d The ladies\u2019 praises boosted her ego even further.Xue Lan suddenly thought of Wei Jing, and that overaged child of hers who would also be attending the entrance exam.\u201cAt his age, that kid is only at seventh level Beast Vein, there is no way he can make it pass the test. Not to mention that his beast is just a wildbeast.\u201d Xue Lan thought to herself, her smile fading just by thinking of them. \u201cI offered you a place to live when you came begging for my help, but you chose to ignore me instead. Now that your kid is gonna fail the test miserably and you are just one step away from your deathbed, I\u2019ll see how you preserve your \u2018dignity\u2019.\u201dNaturally, she did not voice her vicious thoughts, and the ladies around were still prattling on about how wonderful her kids were. Little did she know that it was about to be Li Tianming\u2019s turn to have his lifebound beast tested!\u2026\u2026While he found it slightly awkward to approach Chief Mentor Mu Wan again after three years, Li Tianming still worked up enough courage in the end. She was seated behind the table, her body-hugging dress bringing out charming contours.Li Tianming walked up in a few swift steps and announced his presence, \u201cChief Mentor Mu Wan, it\u2019s me, Tianming.\u201dShe was observing the star orb, and did not notice the young man at first. Only when she heard his voice did she see that ex-student of hers, and her emotionless eyes instantly fixed onto Li Tianming.After a moment of observation, she finally said, \u201cWhat went into your head? Back to just humiliate yourself?\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m here to make a comeback,\u201d Li Tianming replied.\u201cWith?\u201d She had her doubts, but she didn\u2019t dismiss Li Tianming instantly. At her level, a brief look could tell her that he had not lost all his beast ki even after losing his lifebound beast.\u201cChief mentor, please have a look at this.\u201d Li Tianming summoned the little chick from his lifebound space, marking the first time it made its appearance in the institute.\u201cHow filial of you, I\u2019m definitely in the mood for a chicken dinner.\u201d Mu Wan frowned. There wasn\u2019t anything he could make a comeback with, so was Li Tianming here just to fool around with her?\u201cQuit joking, chief mentor, this chick here is my new lifebound beast.\u201d Li Tianming justified.Mu Wan\u2019s eyes shifted between the little chick and Li Tianming. She could tell that he was being dead serious.\u201cAlright, let me see what you have for me.\u201d She was no longer frowning, and instead rested her chins on her hands in a relaxed manner.\u201cPlease do.\u201d Li Tianming brought Ying Huo to the star orb.In fact, the moment Li Tianming summoned his peculiar lifebound beast, he had already drawn quite a lot of attention. For example, Chen Ying and Chen Ding were chuckling at one side, given that this was the first time they saw Li Tianming\u2019s beast.\u201cIs he some kind of a comedian?\u201d Most of the audience simply shook their heads. Just what kind of students were the institute recruiting?Chief Mentor Mu Wan was the only one who observed Li Tianming with more interest than disapproval. From what she remembered, Li Tianming had always been a hardworking and righteous child aside from that incident. She did not expect him to be back after three years, especially not with a composure that belied his youth.As such, under the witness of teachers and students of the institute, Li Tianming cut open the legs of the little chick and dripped its blood onto the star orb. As the orb infused with the blood, it started to glow red.\u201cRed, so it\u2019s a one-star beast?\u201d\u201cIs this the biggest joke in the institute\u2019s history?\u201dBut before the audience could react, the orb suddenly turned orange in color, and the radiance was also brighter. Generally, a star orb would display the color reflecting the beast\u2019s grade directly, and such a transition of color was a rare case. In these cases, the latter color suggested the real grade of the beast.A two-star lifebound beast was still a laughingstock, but seconds later the star orb had changed its color yet again to yellow.\u201cWait\u2026 \u201dWhat followed next was beyond the audience's comprehension. The color of the star orb continued to change, its radiance continuing to intensify. Soon, it was already green, suggesting that the little chick was a four-star lifebound beast.But at the next instant, the orb turned a bright blue, one that was much deeper than most of the teenagers around him. Most holders of the Flameyellow Order had five-star lifebound beasts, out of which high-tier ones were already considered the leading beasts in the institute. With that bright blue color, there was no doubt the little chick was a high-tier five-star beast!Just as people thought it was over, the star orb turned light indigo! Indigo was a sign of six-star lifebound beasts, just like the Hex-starred Clinquant Lion that Chen Yao had. Out of the thousands of people the institute tested so far, only a dozen of them were six-star beasts, with most of them being low-tier and only Chen Yao\u2019s lion being high-tier. Most of the six-star beasts were magnificent creatures, and it was hard to imagine the cute little chick being a six-star beast.Still, that wasn\u2019t the end. The onlookers gasped as the star orb\u2019s light shade of indigo turned darker and darker, almost nearing violet! That could only mean that the little chick was a high-tier six-star beast, same level as the Hex-starred Clinquant Lion. Perhaps the chick was even better, as people could clearly see the color from the orb was even brighter and deeper than the lion\u2019s!Just like Chen Yao\u2019s case, the bright glow had turned the entire stadium\u2019s attention towards Li Tianming and Ying Huo. The color eventually settled at dark blue. Had the star orb continued changing color, the crowd could only assume that the star orb was spoiled. After all, seven-star lifebound beasts required top quality manna to evolve into, and were almost impossible to be born naturally.\u201cIs the star orb spoiled?\u201d Most of the audience stared at Li Tianming and the little chick curiously, as it was hard to believe that such a cute tiny thing was a six-star beast.\u201cGet me another star orb, now.\u201d Even Chief Mentor Mu Wan was startled by the result. With a new star orb and everyone scrutinising the process intensely, Li Tianming dripped another drop of the little chick\u2019s blood onto the new orb.The result was the same, a dark blue even brighter than that of Chen Yao\u2019s! Star orbs going faulty was rare, least to say two of them malfunctioning together. That was enough evidence to prove that Ying Huo was a high-tier six-star lifebound beast. As an extra precaution, Mu Wan had even confirmed the six stars in the little chick\u2019s eyes as well.Within seconds, discussions about Li Tianming rippled across the stadium, as most people there didn\u2019t know who the young man was.\u201cTianming, you lucked out? It\u2019s very, very rare to find the youngling of a six-star wildbeast, and I\u2019m pretty sure blood pacts have quite a low success rate.\u201d Mu Wan stared into Li Tianming\u2019s eyes, her expression totally different from just now.\u201cChief mentor, folks say that handsome people tend to be quite lucky, and I\u2019d say that they are right.\u201d Li Tianming cracked a joke.\u201cNot bad, you seem to have matured. Seems like I\u2019ll have to talk to you in private sometime.\u201d Mu Wan batted her eyes, her charm enough to make any man\u2019s thoughts stray.\u201cJust the two of us? Might reflect badly on us, and I\u2019m scared of being beaten up by your suitors,\u201d Li Tianming replied with a smile.\u201cI\u2019m impressed you still have the mood to joke around. Do you think that things will get easier just because you have a six-star beast?\u201d Mu Wan didn\u2019t understand where his confidence was coming from. She, of all people, knew how much impact the incident three years ago had, and once his name was announced he would be thrown right into the middle of a storm.\u201cOf course not, but I've been preparing for three years.\u201d Li Tianming stopped smiling at these words, gazing at Mu Wan with a determined look.That got Mu Wan even more interested in the young man; she couldn't fathom how a person could change so much in three years. What exactly happened in that period?\u201cWell, I hope you put up a good show.\u201d Mu Wan was confident that she wouldn\u2019t put her faith in the wrong person. She could only hope that Li Tianming had plans that even she wouldn\u2019t expect.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 41": "Chapter 41 - Blazingly Fiery BirdiePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWas Ying Huo just a high-tier six-star lifebound beast? Of course not, since the star orb couldn\u2019t recognise the blood of a Primordial Chaos Beasts. Ever since it became a lifebound beast, the potential within its blood was hidden, and the orb could only detect what was revealed. Everyone could see the six stars in its eyes, but who would have known that each star could be a starfield on its own?\u2026\u2026As Li Tianming and Mu Wan talked, most people in the stadium were restless as they still did not know who this mysterious youth was and where he came from.\u201cWhat is the species of this little chick?\u201d Mu Wan asked. She considered herself to be quite knowledgeable for a chief mentor, but the six-star little chick was beyond her ken.\u201cThe... the Blazingly Fiery Birdie\u2026?\u201d Li Tianming came up with a random name on the spot. Ying Huo, the Aeternal Infernal Phoenix, was clearly unsatisfied with this lame name, but before it could complain, Li Tianming shut it up by grabbing onto its beak.At the same time, Chief Mentor Mu Wan announced, \u201cLi Tianming, your lifebound beast is the Blazingly Fiery Birdie, a high-tier six-star lifebound beast at ninth level of the beast vein stage.\u201dIn actual fact, Li Tianming was still at the eighth level of Beast Vein stage. But when Mu Wan tested the little chick\u2019s beast ki, it was clearly stronger than that of a beast at ninth level. Since she could see that they had clearly not reached Spiritsource stage, she could only classify it under ninth level Beast Vein.The announcement came as a shock, not because of the little chick\u2019s grade, since everyone witnessed the light from the star orb for themselves. What really caught people\u2019s attention was the name Li Tianming. Gossip rippled across the stadium, as those who knew of the scandal three years ago told it to those who didn\u2019t. Soon, the whole stadium would be aware of who he was, and it wouldn\u2019t take long before the entire institute and even the capital would hear of his return!That was also part of Li Tianming\u2019s goals today. He was never afraid of making a scene, and in fact, his plans for revenge would eventually place him in the spotlight anyway. Since it was going to happen sooner or later, he might as well make use of this opportunity to declare his return, and spare himself from the same damn response every time someone realised he was back in Ignispolis.\u201cLi Tianming! He was the punk who drugged Lin Xiaoting\u2019s girlfriend three years ago and had his lifebound beast executed!\u201d It didn\u2019t take long for the whole stadium to know the story. To add fuel to the fire, the other person involved in this story, Lin Xiaoting, was the number one genius in the institute, the idol of countless disciples here.At that moment, Li Tianming could hear the myriad of insults thrown at him, as well as countless contemptuous looks directed his way. Yet, he stood as calm as the sea, as he had seen all these coming his way. Such was life, and the only way he could prove himself was to become even stronger, strong enough to overthrow those who had defamed him.To be honest, he even enjoyed part of the attention, as he could certainly feel that there were people panicking because of him. Take the example of Chen Ding and Chen Ying queuing behind him. They had known Li Tianming\u2019s identity for quite some time, but when his six-star lifebound beast was revealed, they couldn\u2019t hide their horror. Especially not when the \u2018scum\u2019 they looked down on was better than not just themselves, but also the brother Yao they so admired.It was interesting to watch their expressions, but it was still incomparable to that of Li Yanfeng and Liu Qing\u2019s. Having thought that the little chick was just a one-star wildbeast, they had long come to the conclusion that Li Tianming was a nitwit who could never climb out of the Beast Vein stage. This was also one of the key factors why Li Yanfeng gave up on this son of his. But now, with the result from the star orb showing them how wrong they were, the pair stared at each other awkwardly.\u201cNo, no way that\u2019s true! The star orb is broken! I saw its eyes and there was definitely only one star!\u201d Liu Qing exclaimed. A six-star lifebound beast would make a whole world of difference, and it wouldn\u2019t be surprising for Li Tianming to even surpass Li Yanfeng in the future. Had they known that earlier, Li Yanfeng probably wouldn\u2019t even give up on his son. But her frantic denials had ended when Mu Wan tested again with a second orb.\u201cCould it be that the little thing actually evolved with the manna? But there's no way a one-star beast could possibly absorb the manna\u2019s power\u2026\u201d Liu Qing mumbled on.As for Li Yanfeng, his brows were knitted together as he watched the saga unfold. He had never had high hopes of Li Tianming, even when the boy managed to take the manna and the Flameyellow Order. That was because he knew better than anyone that Li Tianming would be useless, what with his lifebound beast dead and the replacement a piddling one-star wildbeast. But the tables had turned. Li Tianming\u2019s only weakness was gone, and he had returned as a talented young man with a bright future ahead.As the father who made the decision of abandoning his son, Li Yanfeng sure was feeling nauseated right now. Thinking back, Li Tianming\u2019s request for Li Yanfeng to wish him a bright future and Wei Jing\u2019s composure when leaving Flamehaven all seemed to point at the fact that the mother and son would not falter right there.\u201cYanfeng, just forget about him. There is no turning back, and no matter what Li Tianming does in the future, it has nothing to do with you anymore.\u201d Liu Qing saw through his thoughts instantly.\u201cI\u2026 I have underestimated him.\u201d Li Yanfeng ground his teeth.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Of all people, Li Tianming chose to offend the Lightning Manor\u2019s \u2018little monster\u2019. If anything, being stronger will only speed up his own doom, since he will eventually try to seek his revenge on Lin Xiaoting. As for us, I\u2019d say that we just stay away from him, and watch as he ruins himself.\u201d Liu Qing hung on to his elbow. They were on the same ship now.\u201cWhat are you thinking? Of course I wouldn\u2019t regret my own decisions. I have chosen you and the Lightning Manor over him, and I would never regret cutting ties with that brat.\u201d Li Yanfeng shook off his uneasiness, knowing that Li Tianming had nothing to do with him anymore. \u201cAnd as you said, he got into trouble with the wrong people. It won\u2019t end well for him.\u201d\u201cThank you, Yanfeng, for valuing our family. One day, we will have our own child,\u201d Liu Qing said, her cheeks flushing bright red.\u201cOf course.\u201d Li Yanfeng put his arm across her waist, a smile reappearing on his face. But no matter how much they tried to just ignore Li Tianming, the youth shone like a star inside the Flameyellow Stadium, his presence sticking out like a sore thumb.In fact, they were not the only ones feeling that way. From within the private room, a certain Madam Xue Lan was sharing the same sentiments as them. As she was still receiving praises from the other ladies over how amazing Chen Yao was, a much brighter spark from the stadium had caught their attention.\u201cWho is that?\u201d Many of them were curious.\u201cMust be a real talent to have the star orb shine so bright. Unfortunately, Chen Yao\u2019s light is still stronger,\u201d said one of the ladies. But that was an obvious lie, as anyone who wasn\u2019t blind could see that this new radiance was way brighter.Xue Lan was displeased that there were disciples who stole the attention away from her son. But then again, Sage Chen had already mentioned that the exam this year was going to be extremely competitive. The Vermilion Bird Clan, Lightning Manor, and even the Occult Athenaeum had brilliant youths participating this year. As such, it shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise to see a spark stronger than her son\u2019s.She wasn\u2019t too concerned at first, but the fervent discussion going on got her curious about the boy\u2019s identity. She was in a good position, and could clearly see the boy\u2019s appearance.\u201cHuh?\u201d She was stunned for a moment, rubbing her eyes for a closer look. But when she realised that she did not see wrongly, she couldn\u2019t help but shriek, \u201cHow could it be him!\u201dIt was unlike her to lose her composure, especially when there were other ladies in the room as well. But she was just too shocked to even realise that.\u201cNo,no\u2026 But his lifebound beast is dead, and with that pathetic wildbeast, he was supposed to be the joke of the institute! This shouldn\u2019t be happening...\u201d Xue Lan mumbled inaudibly to herself.\u201cSister Lan, do you know who this person is?\u201d\u201cSister Lan even knows this kind of young talent we\u2019ve never seen before, just how knowledgeable are you?\u201d The rest of the ladies asked after seeing her reaction, and even then, they did not forget to flatter her.That did nothing to cheer Xue Lan up. What was she going to say? That the person over there was Wei Jing\u2019s child, who did better than her son? Hell no! She could only shake her head and reply, \u201cNo, I saw wrongly. I don\u2019t know who this boy is.\u201dOf course, the ladies immediately realised that something was not quite right with Madam Xue Lan. It was obvious that troubles were weighing down on her mind, to the point that she was near-hysterical. In silent accord, the others decided to leave her alone \u2014 it looked like the best course of action for now. After all, trying to guess her thoughts might only get them into trouble with the mistress of Chen Chateau.It was only when Chief Mentor Mu Wan announced Li Tianming\u2019s name did one of them remember the scandal that spread in the entire Ignispolis three years ago. \u201cIt\u2019s that boy. I heard from my kid that he tried to drug a girl who turned out to be Lin Xiaoting\u2019s girlfriend, and he ended up having his lifebound beast executed.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t believe it, he has such an obedient look too!\u201d\u201cHow disgusting of him, using dirty techniques to get girls that are way out of his league.\u201d The ladies said in disgust.\u201cYes, I do wonder what kind of upbringing he had to become such a flop.\u201d It was only when Xue Lan said this, did she feel better about herself and her son.The discussion in the room was just a snippet of what was happening in the stadium. From eyeing him with envy to gazing at him in despise, the crowd jeered his doings three years ago.\u201cAre you upset to hear all these?\u201d Mu Wan asked him gently.Li Tianming was grateful for his chief mentor, as she seemed to be the only one who trusted him. While he and Mu Qingqing\u2019s relationship was never made public, as their teacher, Mu Wan probably knew that they had been dating for a year. With that knowledge, it was evident that Li Tianming had no reason to drug her.\u201cChief mentor, there is nothing that could upset me more than seeing them kill Midas right in front of my face.\u201d Li Tianming sounded composed. After everything that had happened, mere words would not hurt him.\u201cA changed man, huh.\u201d Mu Wan grinned. But that only lasted for a split second, before she continued with a straight face, \u201cYou have wasted enough time here. Move on to the next segment of your test.\u201d\u201cYes, chief mentor. I'll aspire to be your disciple again this year,\u201d Li Tianming said.\u201cDon\u2019t be too confident, there\u2019s still one more test.\u201d Mu Wan\u2019s eyes flickered.Just as Li Tianming turned around to leave the invigilator table, he could hear Mu Wan shout, \u201cAll of you shut up! We still have tests going on here, so bring your discussions elsewhere!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 42": "Chapter 42 - Lin XiaoxiaoPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayMu Wan\u2019s voice echoed through the stadium, and the boiling sea of insults and slander began to settle. The exam carried on as per normal, and Chen Ding was called up by Mu Wan since he was queuing right behind Li Tianming.After Mu Wan\u2019s shout, the commotion had more or less died down. The only thing that Li Tianming noticed was that there seemed to be far less people around him right now. After all, no one wanted to associate themselves with a degenerate. Li Tianming was happy with being left alone too, since he got to relax in a corner on his own, while waiting for the second segment of the admission test to begin. The Hall of Phoenix had quite a lot of people still queuing, and it would probably take some time.A while later, the test came to an end. The Hall of Phoenix alone had eliminated over six hundred people.Throughout the test, Li Tianming had been keeping track of those with six-star lifebound beasts. It was true that the exam was particularly competitive this year, and eight beastmasters had appeared, each of them with high-tier six-star beasts comparable to the Hex-starred Clinquant Lion. They were from some of the most elite families and factions, like the Vermilion Bird Clan, the Occult Athenaeum, and many others.Hmm, four years ago, Lin Xiaoting\u2019s lifebound beasts were high-tier six-star ones too. Are there no contestants from the Lightning Manor today? Li Tianming glanced around. The best from the Lightning Manor so far was a mid-tier six-star beast, and he was curious.Just then, Li Tianming saw a familiar face from Lightning Manor. It was Liu Qianyang! The boy with his nose broken by Li Tianming had barely passed the test with his Lightning Bolt Cheetah.\u201cWhere did he get his Flameyellow Order from? And does that mean\u2026Li Yanfeng, Liu Qing, they're here too?\u201d Li Tianming scanned the stadium. Alas, the stadium was too big for him to search properly. At the same time, he could hear a new topic being brought up by the crowd.\u201cIt\u2019s that Lin Xiaoxiao from Lightning Manor, she\u2019s gonna be next.\u201d\u201cFour years ago, her brother got first place in the ranking test and made it straight to Heaven's Sanctum. This year I\u2019d say it\u2019s her turn, do you want to know why?\u201d\u201cAhuh?\u201d\u201cApparently, she\u2019s a twin beastmaster just like her brother! Having two lifebound beasts naturally means that they're two times stronger than others.\u201d\u201cFor real? That was Lin Xiaoting\u2019s trump card!\u201d\u201cAs if twin beastmasters aren't scary enough, the two beasts that he had were some of the best beasts around.\u201d\u201cYou aren't wrong, a twin beastmaster would be nothing if both beasts were mere two or three star beasts.\u201d\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, Lightning Manor probably has the best chance this year. That would give their family two consecutive prime disciples.\u201d\u201cIncredible. Even for the Vermilion Bird Clan, that's a rare event.\u201dFrom what Li Tianming heard, this Lin Xiaoxiao was quite a sensation.\u201cHe had a sister?\u201d Li Tianming never knew that his archenemy had a sister. Not that it would affect his plans in any way, since Lin Xiaoxiao was just twelve years old three years ago; the incident had nothing to do with her. For now, he just treated her as one of his rivals for the upcoming ranking test, just like that Chen Yao.It didn't take long for a girl to appear at the Hall of Manibeasts, catching everyone\u2019s attention. Even from where he was, Li Tianming could see the girl standing out from the crowd. Her fame helped, sure, but her elegance was the main reason.Lin Xiaoxiao was dressed in a light orange dress, and her flawless jade-like skin had a peachy glow to it. Her eyes glittered with intelligence, the long curly eyelashes swaying gently with the breeze. She had lips like roses in the morning dew, tempting anyone that saw it. She wasn\u2019t dressed fancily, with the only accessory on her a pearl necklace that glowed faintly. She was young, about the age of fifteen, but it was already evident that she would grow up to be a beauty.On top of her appearance, she seemed to be at ease even as the center of attention, hinting that her personality was incomparable to teens like Chen Ying. She was neither pompous nor nervous about the situation, which surprised Li Tianming, since it was unlike the usual style of Lightning Manor disciples.\u201cChief mentor, may I begin the test?\u201d She asked politely after stepping up to the invigilator\u2019s desk.\u201cSure,\u201d The chief mentor replied with a smile, knowing that she had strength and backing that they couldn\u2019t ignore. It was said that she had both avian and terrestrial lifebound beasts, and the chief mentors of the Hall of Manibeasts were delighted to know that she chose them over the Hall of Phoenix.After obtaining the go-ahead, Lin Xiaoxiao summoned her two lifebound beasts from her lifebound space, sparking a heated discussion in the stadium!\u201cThat\u2019s the Tri-Coloured Darkthunder Bird and the Vajra Berserk Ape!\u201d\u201cBoth of them are lifebound beasts at the pinnacle of six-star!\u201dLi Tianming took a good look at the Tri-Coloured Darkthunder Bird first. It wasn\u2019t a large beast, but its well-balanced contours suggested that it was swift and deadly. Its feathers were split into three different colours: blue, green and red. As they rustled in the air, the feathers even created tri-coloured lightning bolts that flowed across its body. The lightning sizzled as the bird soared in the air, the sound alone making people\u2019s heads numb.The Tri-Coloured Darkthunder Bird was no doubt an impressive lightning type avian beast, but Lin Xiaoxiao had more than that. While the bird circled around her, her Vajra Berserk Ape stood solemnly beside her like a guardian.The giant ape was about three meters in height, with every inch of its skin covered in golden fur that resembled plate armour. Concealed beneath the fur was a burly physique, capable of crushing any foe.Compared to the exquisite Tri-Coloured Darkthunder Bird, the Vajra Berserk Ape seemed way more brutal, its gaze filled with killing intent. Only when it looked towards Lin Xiaoxiao would its expression become more gentle.\u201cVajra Berserk Ape? That\u2019s a dual-type lifebound beast.\u201d Li Tianming recalled reading about it in a book. Lifebound beasts were categorized by their species and types, and dual-type lifebound beasts were special creatures with, as their name implied, two different types. Theoretically, it meant that the beast would control two different kinds of power, making them more powerful.For example, the Vajra Berserk Ape was a lightning-berserker terrestrial beast, where lightning was its main-type and berserker its sub-type. It was capable of generating lightning, as well as entering a berserk mode, which vastly improved its melee abilities.Despite their individual prowess, the strongest member of the trio was actually the frail looking Lin Xiaoxiao. She could control the power of both beasts, meaning that she could also make use of berserker abilities. On top of that, her beast ki would be that of the two beasts combined.The appearance of the two beasts was no doubt declaring Lightning Manor\u2019s ambition of securing the position of prime disciple again this year. Moments after the two droplets of blood dripped onto two separate star orbs, a brilliant blue light illuminated the stadium. The intensity of each orb was slightly brighter than the Hex-starred Clinquant Lion\u2019s, almost about to catch up with the little chick\u2019s. But of course, with the two star orbs combined, the little chick's performance was simply no match.\u201cLin Xiaoxiao, third level Spiritsource stage, with the high-tier six-star Tri-Coloured Darkthunder Bird and the high-tier six-star Vajra Berserk Ape. To have such results at the mere age of fifteen is very impressive, even for a twin beastmaster,\u201d the chief mentor exclaimed, even praising her.\u201cThank you, chief mentor.\u201d Once her test was over, Lin Xiaoxiao quickly kept her lifebound beasts and disappeared back into the crowd. She didn\u2019t seem to enjoy the amount of attention she was receiving.All things considered, Lin Xiaoxiao\u2019s test was a nice finishing touch to the first segment of the test. The few remaining disciples after her were all pretty average, and less than an hour later, everyone was done with the first segment of the test. More than one third of the youths were eliminated, leaving them no choice but to pack up and leave. Having lost their only chance, they could kiss the institute and their dreams for a bright future goodbye.That was just half of the test, with some rejoicing and others despairing. But the chief mentors cared for none of that, as they were busy preparing for the second segment.\u201cFor this part of the test, each of you will take part in a battle that will be graded by us, the ten chief mentors. Winning is not the only important thing, and we will observe factors such as your potential, mindset or techniques. Of course, we will also account for factors such as age differences,\u201d one of the chief mentors explained.\u201cAnd once you have gotten our recognition, you may get the Disciple\u2019s Order from one of the chief mentors. If you manage to secure multiple Orders, then congratulations, you get to choose your own chief mentor. But if you did not manage to get the Disciple\u2019s Order, we will put you on hold, and if the results are still unsatisfactory you will be asked to leave the institute,\u201d the chief mentor added on.The rules were the same as four years ago, so Li Tianming was pretty familiar with the flow. For example, if Chief Mentor Mu Wan recognised Li Tianming\u2019s talent, she would give him her disciple\u2019s order, and that was basically proof that he had passed the test.There were still close to a thousand students over at the Hall of Phoenix. This meant that there were minimally five hundred battles that would take place, which would likely take a few days. Li Tianming wasn\u2019t willing to wait so long, since his mother was still waiting for good news back at the inn. With his abilities, the only disadvantage he had was his age, and he was sure that Chief Mentor Mu Wan would still pick him. Thus, he just wanted the battle to be over and done with, so that he could prepare for the more important ranking test.\u201cLi Tianming!\u201d Just as Li Tianming was looking for an opponent to fight with, a gigantic figure called out to him from behind. He turned around to find none other than the Chen Ding that had jeered at him earlier on.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m four years younger than you, and I\u2019m at the first level of the Spiritsource stage. Do you dare to fight with me for the test?\u201d Chen Ding stared at him coldly. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, maybe one of the mentors will still pick you even after you lose to me.\u201d\u201cBut if they reject you because of your lack of ethics, then it\u2019s a totally different story.\u201d Chen Ying chipped in at one side. Of course, all these were just excuses \u2014 their real goal was just to beat Li Tianming up to vent their frustration.\u201cToo scared to accept my challenge?\u201d Chen Ding growled.\u201cMore like it\u2019s too easy to beat a stupid musclehead like you.\u201d Li Tianming was more than happy to accept the challenge. He was worried about having to find a stronger opponent so as to cover his age disadvantage, and Chen Ding was the perfect choice for him.First level of the Spiritsource stage? Bring it on!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 43": "Chapter 43 - Magical Star RocPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cSis Qin, your son Chen Ding is up!\u201d\u201cWhat a bold young man! He immediately leapt up to fight first as soon as the practical test started!\u201d\u201cHe must have reached the Spiritsource stage already. My Ying\u2019er is still stuck in the ninth level Beast Vein.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Ying\u2019er will definitely reach Spiritsource within half a month.\u201d\u201cThose two kids have such a good relationship. How enviable. After they enter, they\u2019ll be able to train and improve together inside.\u201d\u201cRight, sis Qin. Still, who would dare fight Chen Ding?\u201dXue Lan, who was in between them, raised an eyebrow as the conversation grew heated. \u201cJust watch a little longer and we\u2019ll find out, no?\u201dHer mood wasn\u2019t good, perhaps because Li Tianming had turned out to be stronger than expected. Her one sentence immediately made the atmosphere awkward, leaving the ladies present reluctant to continue. They didn\u2019t know what was the reason for her foul mood, and didn\u2019t want to set her off.A white-clothed, slender young man who looked intelligent appeared in front of Chen Ding, under the women\u2019s rapt attention. He gave off a gentle and refined impression, and the calmness in his eyes seemed to imply a maturity unfitting his age. The slight smirk in the corner of his mouth was a window to his current emotions.If something unusual about him had to be described, it would be his left arm that was covered in dense white cloth, as well as the gloved hand. It gave his manner of dress a slightly heretic feel.\u201cThat\u2019s Li Tianming!\u201d\u201cHe dares to challenge Chen Ding\u2026I remember Chief Mentor Mu Wan declaring that he\u2019s in the ninth level of the Beast Vein stage!\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s older than Chen Ding by three or four years, but still lagging behind him in cultivation. He has nothing going for him other than a lifebound beast with high stars.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s not going to have any chance to show his abilities when Chen Ding crushes him.\u201d\u201cRight. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he's directly eliminated. He\u2019s almost overage.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s asking for trouble.\u201dThe women were all surprised at Li Tianming\u2019s actions.\u201cSisters, this is Ding\u2019er\u2019s first time participating in such an important battle. So, I\u2019m not placing too much expectations on him.\u201d\u201cSis Qin, don\u2019t be so humble! Everyone knows young master Chen Yao has been helping Ding\u2019er and teaching him much.\u201dThe women giggled. \u201cTeaching an indecent rascal a lesson is a walk in the park.\u201d\u201cCorrect. Chen Ding can definitely do so.\u201d Xue Lan, who had been quiet all this time, finally joined in with a smile, and the women around her finally relaxed.While the ladies were chatting, the battle onstage had started.Many people were spectating this fight, as anyone with the courage to go first was definitely full of confidence. After all, everyone was choosing their opponents cautiously to gain a chance to show off their talents and skills to the fullest. Of course, it was also to avoid a humiliating defeat.The five halls had five stages, which meant five matches went on concurrently. The most eye-catching was Li Tianming and Chen Ding\u2019s match.Chen Ding\u2019s beast had already shown itself. It was a high-tier five-star Magical Star Roc, which was a star-type avian beast. Its body was huge and its purple feathers started to glisten when it unfurled its wings. From behind, it did seem reminiscent of a starfield, bright and imposing.In comparison, the little chick on Li Tianming\u2019s shoulder just looked yellow and tender, like a delicacy.No one would have believed it was a higher tier than the Magical Star Roc if it hadn\u2019t been tested with the star orb.Chen Ding was stretching his muscles and looking serious as he prepared to end Li Tianming with one hit, when the little chick asked pretentiously, \u201cSerious question. Is your lifebound beast male or female?\u201d\u201cWhat are you parroting? How does gender matter?\u201d Chen Ding stepped forward, as his fist shot out, covered in starlight. The power contained within left the air shaking.\u201cWell, I\u2019ll neuter it if it were a male. If it was female, mhm\u2026\u201d The little chick placed its wings on its hips, leering.The roc was displeased to hear this, and let out a shrill shriek as it exploded with killing intent.\u201cAiii, what a uncouth voice. Another male! Being born the wrong gender was your sin. Tianming, sic \u2019em!\u201d Normally, it was the beastmaster that commanded the lifebound beast, and yet it was the other way round here...\u201cWeren\u2019t you supposed to be my mount?\u201d Li Tianming asked, amused.\u201cYou nugget, YOU\u2019RE the mount,\u201d the little chick said coolly.The way they were bantering lightheartedly in battle left Chen Ding furious. He used a basic source-ranked battle art, the Shooting Star Fist. The fist would become a shooting star, with power shocking to all! He was fully confident in sending Li Tianming flying in one punch. He would kill two birds with one stone, teach Li Tianming a lesson and enter the institute.However, the moment his fist landed, Li Tianming\u2019s figure simply shimmered, vanishing like a mirage. In his confusion, Chen Ding believed that he had literally obliterated Li Tianming for a moment or so.\u201cWhat kind of speed is that? Aren\u2019t you embarrassed as a Spiritsource cultivator?\u201d A voice rang out right next to his ear, and Chen Ding began to have some misgivings.He instantly responded and punched out, but Li Tianming\u2019s body simply vanished like a mirage again. That was when Chen Ding realised the entire stage was filled with flickering mirages, each of them lasting for quite a few moments before vanishing!Speed was Chen Ding\u2019s weakness, and he wasn\u2019t able to make a snap judgement of Li Tianming\u2019s position.\u201cThis has to be an intermediate source-ranked battle art!\u201d Chen Ding recalled how he had met Li Tianming buying four battle arts at the Chen & Xing Repository\u2019s section for source-ranked battle arts. Could he have learnt it in just a few days? The thought brought a chill to Chen Ding\u2019s heart.He himself had spent a whole month to polish his Shooting Star Fist, but this wasn\u2019t the time to be shocked. When he charged forward, Li Tianming and him brushed past each other. The next moment, Li Tianming was laying siege to the roc, together with his Blazingly Fiery Birdie!\u201cTake this! Netherfire Ghostclaw!\u201d The Confounding Mirage Walk was very suited for the little chick given its small size relative to the Star Magic Roc, as that made Ying Huo even more elusive.Li Tianming had focused on Nine Flying Bolts and Confounding Mirage Walk these few days, and had yet to touch the Netherfire Ghostclaw.However, Ying Huo had reached a level of proficiency with the Confounding Mirage Walk and Netherfire Ghostclaw. As a Primordial Chaos Beast, the little chick was still leagues ahead in comprehension abilities compared to other lifebound beasts, even with bloodline shackles. Despite how unassuming its tiny claws were, even steel walls wouldn\u2019t survive in their wake.Using the Confounding Mirage Walk, it instantly moved to the Star Magic Roc\u2019s chest area, where it gouged out a chunk of meat from it!The roc was strong \u2014 it was in Spiritsource after all. However, it was too big, which worked to its disadvantage as it couldn\u2019t catch the little chick. Worse still, Li Tianming had jumped over Chen Ding to target it too!There was a saying that in the beast vein stage, beastmaster and lifebound beast were equals. However, the beast would surpass the master in the Spiritsource stage.That was because Spiritsource stage lifebound beasts would gain access to their spiritsource ability. It was a kind of bloodline ability, separate from battle arts, and seized from wildbeasts.If the roc was allowed to use it and they were hit, the battle would ramp up in difficulty. So, the duo had decided to focus it down first, using their advantage in speed and movement arts.Li Tianming\u2019s right hand took out the Thunderfire Chain he had liberated from Liu Qianyang. Spirit fire and lightning crackled on its surface. At the same instant the little chick launched his Netherfire Ghostclaw attack, Li Tianming used the Nine Flying Bolt\u2019s first move to land a blow on the roc\u2019s back.Although they were still eighth level Beast Vein, the Aeternal Infernal Beast Ki burned fiercely; both master and beast were able to execute their moves to their fullest potential. A few moments was enough for Li Tianming and the little chick to flay the Magical Star Roc alive, leaving it howling miserably.\u201cLi Tianming, you cur!\u201d Chen Ding gnashed his teeth in fury when he turned to look at what had happened. He had never expected Li Tianming was fast enough to bypass him and gang up on the Magical Star Roc, reducing it to a bloody mess before two breaths had even passed.After heavily injuring the roc, Li Tianming quickly turned around to block Chen Ding.The little chick would take over for the roc. He would take on Chen Ding alone.As the mirages continued to flicker, the Thunderfire Chain descended from the sky towards Chen Ding like a bolt of lightning!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 44": "Chapter 44 - Radiant Stargazer!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cI like this!\u201d Li Tianming had favoured daggers in the past. He had tried sabres, spears, swords and halberds before, but they weren\u2019t his style either.After he obtained the Thunderfire Chain, he found his true love. The explosiveness when attacking was definitely devastating. The Nine Flying Bolts also offered a repertoire of tricks he could play with the Thunderfire Chain.Chen Ding was full of power, but he was incapable of approaching Li Tianming.With over four metres of reach, Li Tianming\u2019s Thunderfire Chain was definitely a ranged weapon. Employing both the Confounding Mirage Walk and the first whip of Nine Flying Bolts together, he lashed at Chen Ding, who could only suffer a one-sided beatdown helplessly.\u201cLI TIANMING!\u201dPOW!Li Tianming found an opening, when Chen Ding screeched in fury. The chain snaked toward Chen Ding, striking him right on the cheek.Chen Ding was sent flying, as three of his teeth arced through the air. Truly, this battle had been a superb display of skill by Chen Ding like no other.\u201cMouthy, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Li Tianming sniggered.\u201cLi Tianming, you!\u201d Chen Ding\u2019s words were garbled after losing his teeth. His face was starting to swell up and resemble a pig\u2019s.\u201cTake a good look in the mirror. There\u2019s no difference between you and a pig now,\u201d Li Tianming chortled.For Chen Ding, this was an utter humiliation!Honestly speaking, a brute force style beastmaster like Chen Ding was destined to be suppressed by Li Tianming. Li Tianming could wield the Thunderfire Chain as dexterously as his own arm. With his range advantage and the Confounding Mirage Walk, Chen Ding had no chance to approach him.Li Tianming could feel a strange power suffusing the stage when he landed his blow on Chen Ding. He realised it was the Magical Star Roc going crazy after he turned his head around. Its eyes began to spit out piercingly bright starlight, which proceeded to stab at the little chick like swords!\u201cThat\u2019s its spiritsource ability! Radiant Stargazer!\u201d Li Tianming heard such comments from the audience.His actions before to suppress the roc were born from his worry of this ability. Now that it was heavily injured, however, the roc\u2019s spiritsource ability was definitely weakened.Fortunately, Li Tianming had defeated Chen Ding now. At the critical moment, Li Tianming\u2019s Thunderfire Chain flew out again, smashing into the roc\u2019s head.In the next moment, its aim was thrown off and the starlight flew into the skies instead.\u201cWow, so if I don\u2019t shoot you, you think that makes it alright to shoot me?\u201d The little chick was furious and turned into a blur using the Confounding Mirage Walk. Another chunk of meat was torn off the roc.\u201cThat\u2019s enough!\u201d Li Tianming finally heard the stern announcement from the chief mentors.Li Tianming wasn\u2019t an idiot, and immediately stopped. However, the little chick was still in the midst of enjoying itself, and Li Tianming had to use his chain to physically restrain and drag it over.\u201cWhatcha doing! I wanna end that nugget!\u201d Evidently, the little chick was still at the age where being hot-blooded came naturally.\u201cIt\u2019s over.\u201d They couldn\u2019t continue once the chief mentors had made their decision. This wasn\u2019t a fight for the purpose of determining a winner or loser, but for the chief mentors to evaluate each person\u2019s talents.Mu Wan was the one who had declared the halt, and Li Tianming stopped out of respect.However, Chen Ding was still furious. He endured his injuries to force himself to his feet. \u201cI don\u2019t accept this, Li Tianming! One more round!\u201d he snarled.Li Tianming smiled gently. \u201cSince when did losers have the right to demand things?\u201dChen Ding wanted to rebut his words, but Chief Mentor Mu Wan cut in. \u201cCome and take the Disciple\u2019s Order. There are still a thousand people queueing up.\u201dWhile these words were said brusquely, Li Tianming liked them. He looked up to see her smiling at him.The other nine chief mentors were all crossing their arms as they maintained their silence.\u201cMu Wan, you\u2019re well aware of what he did three years ago. He\u2019s a stain on the institute\u2019s prestige, as well as an eyesore to Lin Xiaoting and Lightning Manor\u2026\u201d A male chief mentor at the side gave her a soft reminder.\u201cWhat does my choice have to do with you?\u201d Mu Wan rolled her eyes, before tossing a Disciple\u2019s Order to Li Tianming.The other battles hadn\u2019t reached their conclusion yet, which made Li Tianming the first to pass the entrance exam.\u201cI appreciate this very much. You definitely won\u2019t regret this.\u201d Li Tianming knew how difficult it had been for him to get the order again. However, he had finally succeeded. He was very grateful to Mu Wan for this, as it was likely no other chief mentor would dare to want him.They could easily use age as an excuse to disqualify Li Tianming.\u201cChen Ding. You\u2019re young and have peerless talent. You may have had a poor performance today, but that\u2019s only because Li Tianming was crafty. I\u2019m willing to accept you as my disciple.\" Chief mentor Li Kui, who was the one who had spoken to Mu Wan just now, took out his Disciple\u2019s Order.\u201cI\u2019m willing too. You may choose your chief mentor, Chen Ding.\u201d\u201cI third that.\u201d The other chief mentors followed suit, and in the end nine were willing to accept him.In truth, Chen Ding was among the most outstanding participants given his talent and background. It wasn\u2019t anything strange for ten chief mentors to willingly give him their Disciple\u2019s Order.However, his performance just now had been utterly disastrous. He hadn\u2019t been able to do anything to Li Tianming from start to finish, and the maturity he had shown had been lacking as well.In the end, that performance had netted him nine Disciple\u2019s Orders, while Li Tianming was only offered Mu Wan\u2019s. The contrast was rather funny.Still, Li Tianming only wanted Mu Wan\u2019s. As for the other stinking men, who wanted them?\u201cPrepare for the ranking test, Tianming.\u201d Mu Wan\u2019s words were a reminder for Li Tianming to ignore these interpersonal relationship matters and focus on what really mattered.The institute\u2019s ranking test would be far grander than today\u2019s admission test. Even if they weren\u2019t first, ranking higher meant that disciples would gain better positions and resources.Flameyellow Scions Institute also had some secret zones, where the time disciples could cultivate inside for was determined by the ranking tests.The Hall of Phoenix still had at least five hundred matches. With an uncertain time for each of them, it would likely take days to resolve.Then, the ranking test would begin.For now, admitted disciples could first enter the institute to familiarise themselves with the environment. However, Li Tianming had spent one year there already, so he chose to go and tell his mother the good news instead.After bidding farewell to Mu Wan, Chen Ding and him left the stage. Chen Ding\u2019s eyes were still bloodshot, and he still hadn\u2019t let go of his killing intent yet.\u201cLi Tianming.\u201d The Hall of Manibeast\u2019s Chen Yao met up with Chen Ding as he descended the stairs. That young master of Xing & Chen Merchantry hadn\u2019t taken part in the practical battle yet.\u201cYes?\u201d Li Tianming asked.Truthfully, Li Tianming\u2019s performance, including both his lifebound beast\u2019s tier and how he beat Chen Ding, left Chen Yao very uncomfortable.\u201cOh, it\u2019s nothing much. I just admit I did underestimate you. I didn\u2019t expect you to possess some modicum of luck and skill despite your horrendous reputation and dismal character.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, was that a compliment?\u201d\u201cTake it however you want. You\u2019re the very definition of a pathetic person becoming arrogant after some minor success now. Don\u2019t forget who you are, laughing stock of Flameyellow Scions Institute.\u201d Chen Yao\u2019s face was expressionless.\u201cWhat is it you want? Stop beating around the bush.\u201d Li Tianming\u2019s mouth twitched.\u201cI just wanted to let you know since you beat up my brother today, pray you don\u2019t meet me in the ranking battles. No one is there to say stop. If you meet me, I\u2019ll repay you with ten times the injuries Chen Ding suffered today.\u201dLi Tianming chuckled coldly. \u201cI see no need to pray. I dream of slapping you around, letting your face swell up and your teeth drop out. After that, I\u2019ll watch you go home and throw a tantrum, after which your mother will make your favourite herbal soup for you.\u201dChen Yao\u2019s eyes narrowed, before he turned and left.\u201cIt seems you\u2019ve gotten tired of living.\u201d Chen Yao\u2019s sinister tone was filled with killing intent. He had never expected that laughable joke to end up being able to arouse such killing intent in him.Their mothers were once as close as sisters, and they should have turned out to be like a brother to each other.However, that sisterhood had been lost when Xue Lan had tried to display her superiority in Chen Chateau that time. Xue Lan was now living in the lap of luxury, while Wei Jing had fallen into poverty. Also, one\u2019s son had boundless prospects while the other was a joke. Although Xue Lan may not have done anything, her seemingly casual words that time had been the most incisive knife possible.Perhaps Wei Jing didn\u2019t mind and only lamented the lost relationship, but Li Tianming did mind. Li Tianming would never forgive and forget such people.\u201cLet\u2019s just wait and see then.\u201d Today, he had revealed a six-star lifebound beast and beaten Chen Ding, which had shut the mouths of many who were laughing at him before.Li Yanfeng and Liu Qing were two of them. They hadn\u2019t spoken a word since.The women in the private room were another lot as well. When that particular madam saw her son get toyed with by Li Tianming, then soar through the air together with his teeth, she had gone pale and almost shattered her tea cup.\u201cWhat a piece of trash, that Chen Ding!\u201d The women hadn\u2019t expected the angriest to be Xue Lan. She had stood up, flipped over the table in her fury before leaving.The remaining women all exchanged bewildered looks. Why was Xue Lan even angrier than Chen Ding\u2019s own mother?As long as they didn\u2019t know Li Tianming was the son of that graceful and elegant woman in Ignispolis twenty years ago, they would never guess the answer.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 45": "Chapter 45 - Spiritsource AbilityPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayOn the way back to the inn\u2026\u201cYou know, that Star Magical Roc\u2019s Radiant Stargazer was actually pretty powerful. Fortunately, I protected you in the nick of time, or your body would have a hole or two.\u201d Li Tianming was in a good mood.The little chick rolled its eyes. \u201cYeah right, I totally didn\u2019t dodge that myself.\u201d\u201cOh right, will you be able to gain a spiritsource ability through soul refinement? You aren\u2019t a normal lifebound beast, after all.\u201d\u201cHow would I know? Heck, I don\u2019t even know what a spiritsource ability is!\u201dTo understand what a spiritsource ability was, one had to first understand the secrets of the second stage of cultivation, the Spiritsource stage. Having reached the peak of the Beast Vein stage, the beast master and his partner would have a total of eighteen beast veins in their body. Once that was done, they could make use of each other\u2019s beast ki to form the spiritsource in their own body.The position of the spiritsource was dependent on the lifebound beast. For example, in Midas\u2019 spiritsources were mainly located on its claws, feathers and beaks.Compared to beast veins, spiritsources stored far more beast ki, making it one of the key reasons why Spiritsource beastmasters were so much stronger. The number of stars a lifebound beast had also played an important role here, since the number of stars would decide the number of spiritsources that were formed. For example, when a three-star lifebound beast entered Spiritsource, both master and beast would form three spiritsources each. But for the case of six-star beasts, the pair would form a whopping six spiritsources each! They could all be at first level of the Spiritsource stage, but the difference between them would already be magnified.Why use three-star beasts as an example? What about one-star and two-star beasts? Well, beasts from both ranks wouldn\u2019t even be able to enter Spiritsource in the first place.As an example, Chen Yao had six spiritsources in total, each of them at level three. Therefore, if he was matched against an opponent of the same level but with a five-star beast, the advantage of having one more spiritsource will allow him to crush his opponent.In line with the above, the little chick should be getting six spiritsources as well, making it way more powerful. On top of that, spiritsources had even more advanced uses, which was to channel spiritsource abilities!Spiritsource abilities were more complicated to explain, since there were various ways to get those. To begin with, lifebound beasts were not born with these abilities, and these abilities came instead from wildbeasts.Any wildbeast that were three-star and above would have awakened powerful innate abilities at birth. The Razor-Backed Colossal Crocodile, for example, had the water tornado as its innate ability. When killing these wildbeasts, beastmasters could obtain their beast souls using a special method known as soul refinement. They could then channel these beast souls into the spiritsources of their lifebound beasts, granting them these abilities.In short, spiritsource abilities were obtainable from wildbeasts. That being said, soul refinement didn\u2019t have a hundred percent success rate, as it depended on whether the wildbeast's souls had capitulated. If a junior got his parents to kill and refine a wildbeast for him, the success rate would usually be very low, since the beast\u2019s soul would not recognize the junior as its rightful owner. The refinement could also fail if the type of the wildbeast didn\u2019t synergise with that of the lifebound beast.The quality of the beast soul depended on the grade of the wildbeast, and it could only be channeled into the lifebound beast\u2019s spiritsources, not the beastmaster\u2019s. Generally, the number of spiritsources a lifebound beast had was equivalent to the number of spiritsource abilities it had. Beasts like the Hex-Starred Clinquant Lion would be able to channel six different wildbeasts\u2019 innate abilities, making it much stronger than other beasts.When a lifebound beast gained the innate ability of a wildbeast, said ability would change due to the lifebound beast\u2019s bloodline. The beast soul of the wildbeast and the bloodline of the lifebound beast would converge together to give birth to an even stronger spiritsource ability.These abilities were supposed to be unique to lifebound beasts, and were inaccessible to their masters. However, upon reaching the third major stage of cultivation, the Unity stage, beast masters could use the mystical \u2018unity field\u2019 to cast their beast\u2019s spiritsource abilities.\u201cI will have to reach Spiritsource first to know whether I have those innate abilities or not,\u201d Ying Huo had explained. His true identity was a Primordial Chaos Beast, which was more of a wildbeast than a lifebound beast. Even Ying Huo had no idea what its own future was like...Right now, the only thing they knew was that manna could be used to unlock the hidden potentials in Ying Huo\u2019s blood, which was somewhat equivalent to an evolution for the little chick. As for the Aeternal Infernal Phoenix\u2019s Spiritsource stage, they were clueless to what it may bring the little chick. Li Tianming was rather hopeful about it, and he even hoped that the little chick\u2019s bloodline carried its own innate abilities.Speaking of spiritsource abilities, Li Tianming thought about the Saintbeast War-Soul he had obtained in the Abyssal Battlefield years ago. In fact, the Saintbeast War-Soul in itself was a beast soul of the highest quality!Only the mightiest of wildbeasts could be crowned as saint beasts, and such creatures only appeared in Vermilion Bird\u2019s legends. One could only imagine how terrifying their beast soul would be! Any Saintbeast War-Soul would be a little different from general beast souls. They were not refined from killed saint beasts, but were produced centuries after a saint beast died, through a transformation of its beast soul. Like normal beast souls, a Saintbeast War-Soul could also be channeled into spiritsources, and usually there wouldn\u2019t be much resentment since the beast has been dead for too long.Once the soul refinement of the Saintbeast War-Soul was completed , the spiritsource ability that it granted would be simply phenomenal. However, it would also be quite unstable. It was precisely this instability that gave Lin Xiaoting the chance to snatch the Saintbeast War-Soul that Li Tianming had given his Midas!Normally speaking, a spiritsource ability couldn\u2019t be seized from a lifebound beast that had already refined it. But in Li Tianming\u2019s case, he had only just found the Saintbeast War-Soul. Midas had barely refined the beast soul when they were betrayed by Mu Qingqing. It also explained why Lin Xiaoting plucked out every single one of its feathers, since the Saintbeast War-Soul was refined into the spiritsources on Midas\u2019s feathers.\u201cBecause of the Saintbeast War-Soul\u2019s instability, it\u2019s unlikely that Lin Xiaoting could completely refine and master it even after three years. He took the beast soul and Midas from me, and one day, I will make sure to return him every bit of pain that he had caused me!\u201d Li Tianming thought to himself. \u201cMidas, just give me a bit more time\u2026 \u201dLi Tianming was back in the institute, the place where he had lost his hopes and dreams, and he was back to take his revenge. The next step would be to participate in the ranking test, and it wouldn\u2019t be long before he would slay Lin Xiaoting with this very pair of hands!For his honour, but more importantly, for his brother, Midas!......For a period of time, Li Tianming discussed the various aspects of the Spiritsource stage with Ying Huo, and it wasn\u2019t long before the pair had returned to the inn.\u201cWhat good news do you have for me?\u201d Wei Jing smiled at her son\u2019s return.Li Tianming pretended to sigh. \u201cNah, I got expelled by the school and performed horribly.\u201d\u201cFor someone nearly twenty years old, your acting is really bad.\u201d Wei Jing shook her head lightly.\u201cHa, probably inherited that from you too.\u201d Li Tianming brushed it off with a grin. Knowing that it was about time, Li Tianming said, \u201cMother, let\u2019s go, it\u2019s about time we get you a bigger house.\u201dThe money came from that man from the Chen Chateau, and Li Tianming couldn\u2019t reveal his presence to Wei Jing.\u201cWhere did you get that money from?\u201d asked Wei Jing.\u201cOh an idiot wanted to make a bet with me during the test today, so I made quite a bit of money from him just now,\u201d Li Tianming lied, knowing that it was necessary for his mother\u2019s peace of mind.They shouldn't continue staying in an inn like a wanderer, especially not when Ignispolis was her hometown. He would do whatever he could for his mother to live comfortably, even if he had to beg on the streets.\u201cDoesn\u2019t have to be too big, just two rooms would suffice.\u201d Wei Jing wanted him to save some gems for cultivation. But Li Tianming ignored her advice and found a nice serene courtyard close to the Flameyellow Scions Institute. It had five rooms, and a garden where she could plant anything she wanted. Her lifebound beast could also take a stroll in that garden.The house cost Li Tianming a good hundred yellow patterned spirit gems, double the price of his Confounding Mirage Walk, but it was money well spent. He then took an entire day to purchase all kinds of daily essentials for his mother, and even recruited a friendly auntie to take care of mother\u2019s daily needs.By the time they had settled down, night had fallen. While it was a busy day, Li Tianming was content to see Wei Jing enjoying her rest in her lawn chair. Sometimes, it was the simple things in life.\u201cMing\u2019er, remember no matter how tough life is, always take some time to enjoy the simple things in life.\u201d Wei Jing\u2019s eyes were closed as she enjoyed the pleasant evening breeze.\u201cI know. People may say that life is filled with pain and suffering, but for me, as long as I can be with the people I treasure, that is more than enough,\u201d Li Tianming replied.\u201cHa, you sure know how to talk sweet and make your mother happy.\u201d Wei Jing smiled.\u201cDon\u2019t overthink it, what if the person I was referring to isn\u2019t you?\u201d Li Tianming grinned.\u201cWho could it be then?\u201d\u201cProbably some pretty girl that I love so much that made me forget about my mother.\u201d Li Tianming joked.\u201cHaha\u2026\u201d Wei Jing laughed heartily.She was no doubt the most important person in Li Tianming\u2019s heart, as he would lose his purpose in life if she died. But as he made the joke, he suddenly remembered that fairy-like girl he had met at Red Twill Mountain. She was here in Ignispolis too, and just thinking of her made Li Tianming miss her smile. When would they meet again...\u201cMing\u2019er, I want to go watch your ranking test.\u201d It was already late into the night when Wei Jing suddenly said those words. She hadn\u2019t gone to events like these tests for a very long time, and she had never even seen Li Tianming fight before. The ranking test would be the first major challenge for him, where he would meet opponents much stronger than those he had faced before.Wei Jing wanted to be there for her son. She knew that many parents and seniors from reputable families would spectate the test and be there to cheer their children on. She knew she hadn\u2019t done much for Li Tianming in the past years, but the least she could do was to be his moral support, to tell Li Tianming that he wasn\u2019t facing that fight alone.\u201cDefinitely.\u201d Li Tianming nodded. He knew what his mother was thinking, and he too would show Wei Jing, that her son would be a true champion!There was only so much time he could enjoy with his mother. From tomorrow onward, Li Tianming would return to the Flameyellow Scions Institute and prepare for the ranking test!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 46": "Chapter 46 - White Lotus?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLightning Manor was one of the most reputable clans in Vermilion Bird, its history dating back to thousands of years ago when its ancestors founded the nation. Each and every generation from the manor had its own talents that became the backbone of the nation, and their influence could be found throughout the nation.Vermilion Bird had a fearsome troop known as the Tempest Regiment, which was stationed on the nation\u2019s border, protecting the people from harm. For millennia, the Tempest Regiment had doubled as Lightning Manor\u2019s private corps, and the commander would always be the current Lightning Seigneur. Even so, the Lightning Manor had always known its place, which was as a loyal subordinate of the Vermilion Bird Clan. This was also the main reason why the manor managed to thrive for as long as the nation had.The Lightning Manor itself was positioned in the southern district of Ignispolis, where various clans established their bases. It wasn\u2019t as extravagant as Chen Chateau, but it was far more imposing. If one looked down at it from above, the manor seemed to be covered by purple glazed tiles, giving it an intimidating glow.And right now, in the deepest part of the manor, Liu Qing and Li Yanfeng were standing side by side, facing a modest cottage. The cottage looked incongruent with the rest of the manor, but every member of the clan knew that this was a hallowed place, the meditation grounds of the Lightning Seigneur. It was out of bounds to most of them, and one could only enter if the Lightning Seigneur had personally summoned them.Needless to say, Li Yanfeng and Liu Qing had been summoned to meet the seigneur. Even Liu Qing had never been here before, judging from her slightly nervous expression.\u201cDisciple Liu Qing, together with my spouse Li Yanfeng, greets the Lightning Seigneur.\u201d She pulled Li Yanfeng\u2019s sleeves as a signal, and the two knelt before the cottage. The doors remained shut, and without its owner\u2019s permission, they wouldn\u2019t dare to enter it.\u201cHm.\u201d A hoarse voice sounded from inside the cottage. The owner of the voice was old, but it had an undeniable solemness to it, and could only belong to a true overlord. Even if Li Yanfeng had an entire city under his control, that voice alone had easily suppressed him.\u201cLi Yanfeng,\u201d the Lightning Seigneur called from within his cottage.Li Yanfeng lowered his head. \u201cI\u2019m here, sir.\u201d\u201cI've heard stories about you, that you wish to be part of our clan, and you are very sincere about it. I recognise your talent, and will accept you into the manor.\u201d The Lightning Seigneur\u2019s voice was emotionless, but he pronounced every word firmly.Li Yanfeng was excited to be accepted this easily. \u201cThank you, sir. I am willing to use my blood and my life to fight for Lightning Manor\u2019s honor.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t bother with expressing your loyalty in words, I only look at results,\u201d said the seigneur. \u201cFrankly, you are rather strong even by the manor\u2019s standards. If you were born in a better family, you would be ten times more powerful than your current self right now.\u201dLi Yanfeng had his head lowered, as he listened to the seigneur\u2019s instructions for him.\u201cOnce you make a breakthrough in your current stage, you will probably be one of the top ten cultivators in the manor. I have important uses for people like you, and therefore I shall grant you our Lightning Manor\u2019s heavenly will technique,\u201d the seigneur continued.When the couple heard that, they could barely hide their elation. A fortune was bestowed upon them without any warning, and all they could do was to kneel on the floor and thank the seigneur. \u201cThank you, sir. This technique is very important to me, and I will forever be in your debt.\u201dLi Yanfeng continued, his words packed with emotions, \u201cWords are not enough to describe my gratitude. The seigneur may watch my contributions to the manor, and punish me should my performance be unsatisfactory. \u201d\u201cNo need for the theatrics. At your age, you should know what you should do, and what you shouldn\u2019t. The Lightning Manor can give, and it too can take. You\u2019re a clever man; don\u2019t misplace my trust.\u201d The Lightning Seigneur made it sound simple, but the threat from his tone was so obvious, even Liu Qing broke into cold sweat.But with all that said and done, Li Yanfeng could never imagine that he had already gotten what he wished for, even before he had contributed anything to the manor. He had started everything from scratch, fought for his whole life without any support or backing, and only he himself knew how much pain he suffered because of that.To add insult to injury, he was blessed with talent, but he had never made it into the top ranks of Vermilion Bird, as he didn\u2019t have a heavenly will technique. But today, the Lightning Manor had given him the chance that he could only dream for.Li Tianming always thought that his father got together with Liu Qing for the Flameyellow Order and the manna, but it turned out he had always underestimated Li Yanfeng. What Li Yanfeng wanted was a backing that could support him in climbing the ranks as the elites of the nation. On Liu Qing\u2019s side, her family\u2019s influence in the manor had been weakened due to her father's passing, and she desperately needed a man who could represent her family.\u201cYou are new to the manor, and are probably unfamiliar with the Lightning Manor. Let me give you a simple task,\u201d the Lightning Seigneur said.\u201cAnything I can do for you, sir.\u201d\u201cMy granddaughter, Xiaoxiao, will be taking part in the Flameyellow Scions Institute\u2019s ranking test. That kid likes to act independently, and I need someone who can protect her from the shadows. I have made plenty of enemies in my life, and there are quite some dangerous men,\u201d said the Lightning Seigneur.\u201cBe at ease, sir. I\u2019ll treasure her life more than my own.\u201d Li Yanfeng replied, knowing it was an easy job.\u201cRemember, do not show yourself unless she is in life-threatening danger. She needs to learn to face dangers on her own too. And besides, if she knew about your presence, with her temperament she will probably demand to be left alone.\u201d\u201cI understand!\u201d Li Yanfeng nodded his head, with Liu Qing\u2019s hand in his. Their future seemed to be brighter than ever.\u2026\u2026At the age of fifteen, Lin Xiaoxiao left the Lightning Manor to begin her own life. But little did she know that her family had already found a bodyguard for her.With the admission test cleared, she was now an official member of the institute, granting her unrestricted access in the institute. However, everyone knew that her position in the Hall of Manibeasts was but temporary. It wouldn\u2019t take long before she became a member of the prestigious Heaven\u2019s Sanctum.It wasn\u2019t the first time she walked through the institute, and in fact, she had even lived in the sanctum for a period of time before. As she walked towards the entrance of Heaven\u2019s Sanctum, even the chief mentor guarding the gates let her in with a smile.\u201cXiaoxiao, you should have no problem clearing the ranking test and entering the sanctum right?\u201d the mentor asked.\u201cI will try my best.\u201d Lin Xiaoxiao was a very likable girl. Unlike most of her peers from the Lightning Manor, her manners were affable.The sanctum was an unknown ground to most disciples, but Lin Xiaoxiao easily found her way around till she reached a courtyard. The doors were unlocked, and when she pushed open the gate, she was greeted by a sea of flowers, its fragrance filling her nostrils. A couple of birds were chirping on a tree nearby, and beneath the tree was a pleasant rock garden beside a pond. It was an utopia, there were no two ways around it.All the plants and trees there were planted personally by the garden\u2019s owner, and it clearly took a lot of effort to create such a scenery. Lin Xiaoxiao strolled along a pebbled path, indulging herself with the floral scents.Suddenly, music began to play. The sound of a zither flowed through the garden, its rhythm bringing the whole garden to life. The notes were mellow and the rhythms elegant, hinting at the musician\u2019s skills and grace.In front of Lin Xiaoxiao was a pristine pond, where goldfishes frolicked in the water as if they were dancing to the music. Further ahead, a gloriette rested in the middle of a pond, where a girl in white was playing her zither. Her fingers seemed to have spirits of their own, as they waltzed across the instrument to create the melodic tune.The girl was dressed in a white tulle skirt with pink borders, the hemline swaying to the wind. Her face was covered in a thin veil, the contour of her face showing her pert nose and her smiling, rosy lips. She had skin as fine as jade, and her brown hair dripped over her shoulders like honey. Her eyes were black with an almost unnoticeable tinge of blue, and they glinted with intelligence while she played her instrument. It was almost like a scene straight out of a painting, with a fairy gently stroking her zither, her figure embraced by mother nature.Within the windswept garden, the girl looked like a pure and innocent white lotus in the middle of the pond.\u201cXiaoxiao, you are here. How was the admission test?\u201d The music stopped abruptly. The girl lifted her veil as she stood up to face Lin Xiaoxiao, her slender figure a feast for the eyes.\u201cI cleared it.\u201d With a broad grin, Lin Xiaoxiao hurried into the gloriette, \u201cBig sis Qingqing\u2019s performance is as amazing as ever, how I envy my brother for having someone like you.\u201d\u201cYou sure know how to make me happy.\u201d The girl smiled. \u201cIt's been half a year since we last met. Our Xiaoxiao is so pretty now, and you're just fifteen. You will definitely grow up to be a lovely lady.\u201d\u201cBut being pretty does not benefit my cultivation in any ways, and I'd rather be known for my strength instead.\u201d Lin Xiaoxiao pouted.\u201cYes, yes, Xiaoxiao will definitely be a master in the future, even stronger than your brother.\u201d\u201cOf course, my goal is to surpass Lin Xiaoting, and make him pay for bullying me when I was young, hehe.\u201d Lin Xiaoxiao giggled heartily, showing a side of her that was usually hidden from people.\u201cDefinitely, I will support you when you get the chance to do that.\u201d The girl\u2019s face flushed red when she thought of him.After a bit of casual chat, they talked about the entrance exam. The girl asked, \u201cHow well do you know your opponents? Confident?\u201dLin Xiaoxiao had a determined look on her face, and it was clear that she desired to be the prime disciple of the ranking test, so that she could catch up to her brother.\u201cI believe in you. Soon we'll cultivate in Heaven\u2019s Sanctum together,\u201d the girl continued proudly, \u201cThe sanctum is much more peaceful than outside, and you can learn a lot of new things here too. Look at your brother \u2014 he recently entered seclusion, and he will probably make another breakthrough when you get to see him again.\u201d\u201cBrother is going to get even stronger!\u201d Lin Xiaoxiao rolled her eyes. Speaking of her brother, she remembered about her main purpose here today.\u201cBig sis Qingqing, do you know that an evil man appeared during today\u2019s admission test?\u201d Lin Xiaoxiao said seriously.\u201cEvil? Which evil man?\u201d The girl smiled as if Lin Xiaoxiao was still a child.\u201cRemember the evil person who tried to violate you three years ago? That Li Tianming, who had his lifebound beast executed by brother,\u201d Lin Xiaoxiao asked.Upon hearing the name, the girl seemed to freeze for a moment. A flurry of emotions went through her head, but in the end, she just bit her lips gently, as if she had let go of the past.\u201cI\u2019m sure he returned home, so how did he return to the institute?\u201d she asked with an unreadable smile.\u201cHe managed to get the Flameyellow Order from his hometown again. Apparently, he had gotten himself a new lifebound beast with a blood pact, and cleared the admission test with it.\u201d Lin Xiaoxiao\u2019s expression was twisted with disgust when she spoke of that man. After all, she had heard about his doings from her sister Qingqing.\u201cIs that so? Then I must congratulate him.\u201d The girl nodded, her smile still lingering on her face.\u201cBig sis Qinging, are you not appalled by his return? After all, he nearly destroyed your future three years ago. Do you want me to teach him a lesson?\u201d asked Lin Xiaoxiao.\u201cThat\u2019s not needed,\u201d the girl said.\u201cBut why?\u201d\u201cXiaoxiao, everyone makes mistakes, and he may have resorted to extreme measures because of his love for me,\u201d the girl said gently.\u201cBut...\u201d\u201cHe has paid his price, and your brother executed his lifebound beast. He may have sinned in the past, but we shall leave that behind us,\u201d the girl said sincerely.\u201cYou don\u2019t want me to teach him a lesson?\u201d\u201cOf course not, we used to be good friends too. I\u2019m genuinely happy that he can step out of his past and make it back to the institute. If anything, I wish him all the best in the institute, and hope that his efforts will pay off.\u201d\u201cBig sis Qingqing, you're just too kind, even to those that had hurt you. My brother is really lucky to have found someone like you.\u201d Lin Xiaoxiao looked at her with utmost respect.The girl smiled. \u201cLet\u2019s not talk about all those past stories now. I learnt a new score recently, do you want to hear it?\u201d\u201cOf course!\u201dA while later, the sound of a zither echoed in the courtyard again. It was only when night fell did Lin Xiaoxiao leave the place.......Having sent Lin Xiaoxiao off, the girl returned to her room, the expression on her face a lot colder. She whipped out a piece of ink-black parchment stamped with a blood-red flower, and one could only wonder where she got such a peculiar item from.Holding a quill pen in her hands, the girl dipped it in white ink and wrote on the parchment\u2014\u2014Wanted: Assassination by Bloodflower Chamber.Target: Li Tianming, disciple of Flameyellow Scions Institute, first level of Spiritsource stage.Bounty: One thousand yellow-patterned spirit gems.Bring me his head.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 47": "Chapter 47 - Can\u2019t Wait Ten YearsPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayFlameyellow Scions Institute took up a lot of land, with the Hall of Phoenix being the largest hall. It was built around Mount Phoenix, with thousands of buildings and tens of thousands of pavilions.The Hall of Phoenix had three classes. The elite class were located at the summit, while the journeyman class was halfway up and the apprentice class all the way down at the foot. Naturally, the elite class had the best area when it came to spiritual energy of heaven and earth.Many disciples would drop out in their climb from the apprentice to the elite class. It was the norm for students to fail in keeping up with the pace; they would retain and then finally withdraw from the institute. Hence, simply graduating was already an accomplishment.The Muwan class was still at the same old place next to the Soaring Spirits Lake. There were over a hundred buildings, and the fifty disciples of the Muwan class would spend their time cultivating here. Since her previous class had been promoted, the lake area had been cleared out.Li Tianming was the first to join this new generation of disciples, but he had gone to visit his mother first after being admitted.When he returned, Soaring Spirits Lake was already bustling with activity. The new disciples were currently full of excitement as they toured around.\u201cLi Tianming, come in.\u201d Li Tianming heard Chief Mentor Mu Wan\u2019s voice as soon as he arrived, and briefly wondered if she had eyes everywhere here. How else would she be able to catch him as soon as he showed up?He was summoned to Mu Wan\u2019s Mu's Chamber. It was where she usually cultivated and taught her disciples.Li Tianming knocked before entering, only to see Chief Mentor Mu Wan reclining lazily on a couch in the courtyard. She was covered in a mink fur blanket, her long and snow-white legs poking out of it. She happened to be stretching as Li Tianming entered, placing her charming curves on full display.However, Li Tianming acted like an upright gentleman, keeping his expression honest and not letting his gaze stray. He was all too clear that too long a look would present an excuse for Mu Wan to find trouble with him.\u201cSo, you\u2019ve gotten smarter. I don\u2019t even have the chance to find an excuse to beat you up now.\u201d Mu Wan chuckled.\u201cImpossible. Chief mentor, you\u2019re so graceful and kind! How could you ever beat anyone up?\u201d\u201cQuiet. Come and help me massage my shoulders.\u201d Mu Wan directed a charming smile, loaded with meaning, at Li Tianming.However, if he took it to be an invitation, he would be in for a beating.Li Tianming cleared his throat, feeling that was some trick afoot.\u201cYou ungrateful little thing. Do you know how much heat your chief mentor had to take to accept you? Come and help me destress.\u201d Mu Wan rolled her eyes.She was telling the truth. Li Tianming did have to be grateful. The other nine chief mentors had all ignored Li Tianming\u2019s performance.Li Tianming went behind her back and started giving her a massage. To be honest, giving a pretty woman a shoulder massage wasn\u2019t much of a hardship.Li Tianming enjoyed the exercise, while Mu Wan also enjoyed his show of skill.\u201cTake out your lifebound beast for me to play with,\u201d Mu Wan suddenly said.Li Tianming thought that he shouldn\u2019t suffer alone, so he immediately summoned it out. It was still snoring away as Mu Wan picked it up.\u201cWhat the heck-\u201d The awoken little chick was just about to cuss out a storm when it opened its eyes to a beauty. Moreover, the beauty was putting it on her chest.It quickly retracted its angry look and lay limply in Mu Wan\u2019s hands as she played with it.Li Tianming gaped in bewilderment. He didn\u2019t expect Ying Huo to be that shameless.\u201cYour little chick\u2019s quite fun to play with.\u201d Mu Wan turned to look at him.\u201cChief mentor, those words of yours are very misleading,\" Li Tianming said bashfully.\u201cSo, Li Tianming. You dare to tease even me now? I\u2019m punishing you with one month of shoulder massages for me.\u201dHe had fallen for it...Still, that didn\u2019t sound bad at all.\u201cAs long as it makes the chief mentor happy, I\u2019ll give you all the shoulder massages you want, even if I have to go through hell or high water,\u201d Li Tianming said solemnly.\u201cHmph. You\u2019ve enjoyed yourself well enough so far, I hope. I called you over for official business today.\" Mu Wan turned serious. Li Tianming stopped his hands as he listened.\u201cPlease, continue.\u201d\u201cSo, there was a mighty coincidence three years ago I found rather interesting. Not ten days after your incident, information of Lin Xiaoting finding a Saintbeast War-Soul spread.\u201d Eyes glittering, Mu Wan looked at him squarely.\u201cWhere are you going with this?\u201d Li Tianming asked.\u201cI was just wondering if, by any chance, the Saintbeast War-Soul belonged to you? After you returned from Abyssal Battlefield, I found a sort of ancient aura about Midas\u2019s feathers, but I didn\u2019t overthink it.\u201d She continued to fix her eyes on him.She was the first person to ask Li Tianming such a question in three years. For everyone else, no one would believe it even if Li Tianming said the truth.Li Tianming didn\u2019t respond. Mu Wan lay back down and continued, \u201cSo, even though I\u2019m an outsider, I came up with a story. Would you like to hear it?\u201d\u201cNaturally. I love storytime.\u201d Li Tianming said.\u201cOnce upon a time, there was a boy and a girl. They were together for a year. The boy was deeply in love with the girl, but the girl seemed to have other thoughts. One day, the boy found a great treasure. The girl was the only one he told, but he never expected her to use this information as a stepping stone to latch on to a powerful clan\u2019s young master. They colluded to snatch away the treasure from the boy, as well as defame and cripple him in the process.\u201dAn expression appeared on her face, both a smile and not a smile. \u201cSo, do you think that story sounds like fact or fiction?\u201d\u201cChief mentor, you do have a good imagination. But don\u2019t you think it sounds fake when you keep addressing them as \u2018boy\u2019 and \u2018girl\u2019?\u201dShe wasn\u2019t joking around.\u201cI may be a little selfish and like to tease people, but I do still have a bit of a sense of justice. If that young man from the story can somehow fight his way out of his predicament, I\u2019ll be inclined to give him a helping hand.\u201d\u201cThat young man sure is lucky. Good people aren\u2019t that common these days,\u201d Li Tianming said.\u201cStill, I have to remind him not to rush his cultivation after he gets his new chance. And he definitely can\u2019t let revenge blind him and ruin his newfound chance. After all, the saying goes that a gentleman can wait ten years for their revenge. It\u2019s only been three years,\u201d Mu Wan said seriously without beating around the bush.Li Tianming understood what she meant. These words were her purpose for finding him today. He was grateful that he could still meet a chief mentor like this during these chaotic times.He sighed heavily. \u201cChief mentor. Perhaps he wants to say that he\u2019s been nursing his grudge for three years so that he can send his enemy to hell. He\u2019s not a gentleman who can wait ten years.\u201d\u201cWell, I can\u2019t stop him if that\u2019s what he thinks. Still, he has to remember not to attempt the impossible. The real tragedy is if he fails in his revenge and his enemy goes scot-free for another hundred years!\u201d\u201cStill, what if it's the chief mentor who underestimated him?\u201d Li Tianming asked.Mu Wan pursed her lips wordlessly.\u201cHis goal now is to enter Heaven\u2019s Sanctum. Succeed, and anything will be possible. Do not worry, chief mentor. He has willpower others don\u2019t have. No one knows just how much he\u2019s suffered in these three years. Such people cannot and do not lose!\u201dLi Tianming could feel blood rushing to his head. Li Tianming hadn\u2019t expected to lose his cool around Mu Wan and start to crazily vent like that. Like a wild beast, all he could see was red.And within that redness, that unforgettable scene of Midas\u2019s feathers all being plucked off played again and again. The scene was filled with its tears and blood.Save me, Tianming!Even now, those three words continued to stab at his mind, the pain enough for anyone to lose their rationality.Li Tianming could no longer even breath properly.It had been three years. Was Midas happy in its next life? Did it hate him for avenging it yet?Wait for ten whole years? Screw that!He felt like his chest was filled with magma that kept increasing by the second, threatening to erupt at any moment now.\u201cKiddo\u2026\u201d At this moment, he felt himself fall into a warm and gentle embrace. Such things intrinsically possessed the gift to calm people down.Finally, the red in his eyes receded.As she gently hugged him, Mu Wan gently stroked his head and back, calming the beast within him. This sort of hug was unforgettable.\u201cHey, if I act like that more often, does that mean more hugs?\u201d Li Tianming suddenly asked.\u201cNaughty boy!\u201d However, she didn\u2019t let go. Perhaps, she found it satisfying to use warmth to cool down a volcano. Still, she did pinch Li Tianming\u2019s neck, which caused him to grimace in pain.\u201cNow you know the punishment for teasing me,\u201d Mu Wan gloated.\u201cWell, I still profited here.\u201d Although his neck still hurt somewhat, it was hard to forget that warmth and fragrance just now.\u201cGet lost.\u201d Mu Wan realised she could no longer control him. Li Tianming had changed. Three years ago, he had been obedient and pure.\u201cAlright, time to split!\u201d Li Tianming caught the little chick who was watching the show from the side and quickly fled.After all, he had already enjoyed himself, and if he stayed on, he would probably need to pay a price..However, when he breathed in a mouthful of air, he realised that the fire in him hadn\u2019t been fully doused yet.He raised up his head to look beyond Mount Phoenix, in the direction of Heaven\u2019s Sanctum. It was possible that those two had heard about his return by now.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 48": "Chapter 48 - Whirlwind Zestful CranePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe admission test was still ongoing, and within the Flameyellow Stadium, there were still disciples battling. Once that was over and the Flameyellow Scions Institute reached its full intake capacity, it would take a few days to settle some administrative matters before the ranking test was conducted.Li Tianming still had a small period of time to prepare for the test, and he was ready to spend all his time on cultivation once he left Mu Wan\u2019s place. Disciples' residential areas were allocated by the chief mentors, and all he needed to do was to collect his key. To his surprise, the one distributing the keys was his old classmate, Lin Qingyu.\u201cWhere\u2019s Fang Zhao?\u201d asked Li Tianming.\u201cThere\u2019s still quite a lot happening back in the stadium, and I\u2019m just here to help Chief Mentor Mu Wan first,\u201d she replied.\u201cFind me a secluded place then,\u201d Li Tianming requested.\u201cSure.\u201d Lin Qingyu handed him his key. His place was quite a distance away from everyone else\u2019s.\u201cQingyu, see you around.\u201d Li Tianming took the keys from her and was about to leave. To be honest, Lin Qingyu had treated him fairly, and at least she didn\u2019t bully him even given his current situation.\u201cTianming.\u201d Before he could leave, the girl called out.\u201cYes?\u201d Li Tianming turned back to look at his old classmate.\u201cFang Zhao was really pissed at you because of what you said the other time. He said that he will \u2018pay you a visit\u2019 one of these days,\u201d Lin Qingyu explained. \u201cIf he comes looking for trouble, just stay in your room, or report him to chief mentor.\u201d\u201cWhat level is his cultivation at now?\u201d Li Tianming was not surprised by his decisions. If Fang Zhao thought of himself as superior just because he had three years wrong, Li Tianming was about to prove him wrong.\u201cSecond level Spiritsource, going third,\u201d Liu Qianyang recalled.\u201cHa, three years and he only managed to get to second level Spiritsource from ninth level Beast Vein. Tell him he\u2019s welcome to find me anytime.\u201d Li Tianming brushed it off. Even if Li Tianming was the one who helped him fend off bullies three years ago, just because of their altercation a few days back that hurt his ego as the \u2018senior\u2019, Fang Zhao threatened to beat Li Tianming up. Li Tianming couldn\u2019t care less about this kind of person.\u201cWhy must you seek trouble...\u201d Lin Qingyu shook her head.\u201cAnd what makes you think he can definitely overcome me?\u201d\u201cFang Zhao\u2019s talent may not be much in this institute, but remember, he is no longer just that fifteen year old boy.\u201dLi Tianming listened to her reminder, before leaving with a smile.While they were talking, a small group of freshmen had gathered around them. But when Li Tianming walked towards their direction, the crowd dispersed automatically, as if Li Tianming was carrying some kind of plague. Ever since he returned to the institute, no one other than Chief Mentor Mu Wan was willing to even get close to him.\u201cIs he an idiot?\u201d\u201cSenior Fang Zhao wants to teach him a lesson, and he still dares to talk back?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t get it, why would Chief Mentor Mu Wan accept a delinquent like him? Shouldn\u2019t have joined the Muwan class\u2026 \u201d\u201cHow stifling, to be in the same class as a loser who should have died three years ago.\u201d\u201cLin Xiaoting was still too kind, I would have executed him instead three years ago.\u201d\u201cForget it, I think Chief Mentor Mu Wan quite likes him...\u201dSuch discussions were nothing new to Li Tianming, their accusations even lacking creativity to him. Ignoring the onlookers, Li Tianming found the house allocated to him.Lin Qingyu had indeed given him a secluded place that hadn\u2019t been occupied for a couple of years. The place was piled with weeds when Li Tianming arrived, and he took some time to burn them away before starting with his cultivation.Important tasks awaited him. Not only did Li Tianming need to practice the four battle arts he had just learnt, he also needed to refine more beast ki with crimson gems in order to raise his level of cultivation. With only a few days to the ranking test, it was a race against time.The Confounding Mirage Walk, Nine Flying Bolts and Netherfire Ghostclaw had all performed wonderfully during the admission test; those battle arts had suited him well. But with his current mastery of those battle arts, he couldn\u2019t compare to the likes of Chen Yao or Lin Xiaoxiao, which meant that he wouldn\u2019t qualify to enter Heaven\u2019s Sanctum.Thankfully, he still had time for some last minute effort before the crucial point. If he couldn\u2019t make it into the sanctum with this test, he would have to wait for the next opportunity. But Wei Jing couldn\u2019t wait. Even with a good supply of clear spirit grass, she may not be able to last that long.From there on, Li Tianming spent every single second he had locked up in his room, focused on his cultivation. As for the little chick, it was absolutely delighted with being able to eat spirit gems to its heart\u2019s content. Everyday, it gobbled down crimson gems like peanuts, the powerful spiritual energy from the gems engulfing it in fire constantly. But Ying Huo was used to it, and when it really couldn\u2019t deal with the blaze, it would hop onto Li Tianming\u2019s shoulders and direct some of the flames to him.With enough determination and a clear goal in mind, their cultivation was more effective than ever. Coupled with their superb talent and a comfortable supply of gems, Li Tianming and Ying Huo made incredible progress.Finally, after downing three hundred crimson gems, they successfully made it to ninth level Beast Vein! It was the peak of the Beast Vein stage, signifying that all nine beast veins on their body were developed and pumped with beast ki.They were done with the first big stage of cultivation! Next was the Spiritsource stage, where their cultivation began with first forming their spiritsources. Li Tianming had experience in that, but he was in no hurry to enter that stage. At their current state, they had sufficient Aeternal Infernal Beast Ki in their body already, and the more important thing was to stabilize their foundations, and to work on the four battle arts.Regarding Spiritsource, Li Tianming had his past experience with Midas, while the little chick had its own methods. Upon reaching ninth level, Ying Huo claimed that the Aeternal Infernal Codex in its bloodline had revealed the cultivation methods for Spiritsource. All he needed to do was to gather the spiritsources and the little chick would guide him through on the details. Spiritsource would open a new gate of cultivation for him, and Li Tianming was filled with anticipation.Just as they got familiar with their new power, a commotion had started outside their house \u2014 Fang Zhao had showed up on his doorstep to seek some trouble. But his appearance also implied that his job at the stadium was over, and that the admission test had officially concluded. The ranking test would begin in a few days, and Li Tianming felt the looming pressure redouble.\u201cLi Tianming, I brought some guests for you.\u201d Fang Zhao\u2019s voice sounded from outside the doors, and some people were apparently tagging along.Li Tianming took some time to pack up, before heading outside. As he opened the gate, he saw around eight familiar faces. All of them used to be from the Muwan class and were now in the journeyman class. Back when they first entered the institute, they were all friends who played and cultivated together.Lin Qingyu was among the group too, but she had a worried look on her face. After all, she knew what Fang Zhao was here for.Li Tianming smiled. \u201cFang Zhao, Qingyu, Guanxiong, Zhao Ying, Chen Kun\u2026 What a group we have here. Good to see y\u2019all again.\u201d\u201cGood, but it would have been better had you not shamed yourself three years ago. Then we would be together in the journeyman class now, instead of you playing with these apprentice kids,\u201d Fang Zhao mocked.\u201cLi Tianming, you probably don\u2019t know about this, but ever since your scandal, our whole class had been laughed at because of you.\u201d Lu Guanxiong shook his head and continued, \u201cAnd when you were finally forgotten, you just had to come back to stir up past shames.\"\u201cAnd I thought we were here to talk about the good old times. Why does it sound to me that you all are here to denounce me?\u201d Li Tianming smiled.Aside from the group of seniors, quite a few freshmen had gathered due to the commotion as well. Most of them had gotten to know each other in the past days, with the exception of Li Tianming, who was isolated in his room.\u201cLi Tianming, are you scared now? Who was the one that taunted me a few days back and asked me to pay you a visit?\u201d Fang Zhao licked his lip, his expressions menacing.\u201cNah, I\u2019m just saddened to have to beat up people whom I thought were friends,\u201d Li Tianming replied, his boldness shocking the group. They had heard about how cheeky he was ever since his return, and it seemed that those rumors were justified.\u201cNo point wasting time speaking to a fool. Fang Zhao, go beat some sense into him.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cShow him that someone who had been crippled for three years can\u2019t compare to us in the journeyman class.\u201dUnder their persuasion, Fang Zhao gladly accepted the \u2018honour\u2019. He pointed at Li Tianming and declared, \u201cDon\u2019t blame me, I\u2019m doing you a favour here. Next time you meet other seniors, you better remember to pay them the respect they deserve so you don\u2019t get beaten up again.\u201d\u201cSo I\u2019m supposed to thank you instead.\u201d Li Tianming smirked, his nonchalant attitude making Fang Zhao even more annoyed.\u201cWhirlwind Zestful Crane!\u201d Fang Zhao summoned his lifebound beast.It was a snow-white, red-crowned crane, with only the tip of its tail black in color. The crane was noble and elegant, its wings magnificent when spread out. Like its beastmaster, it had a haughty look on its face.The Whirlwind Zestful Crane was a low-tier five-star lifebound beast, the minimum benchmark for the institute, and it was a wind-type avian beast. While it may not look much, at second level Spiritsource, Fang Zhao and his beast were a powerful duo.\u201cYing Huo, this crane is female, any thoughts?\u201d Li Tianming said to the little chick on its shoulders.\u201cToo ugly, not my cup of tea,\u201d the little chick spat.Li Tianming had suspicions about its sense of beauty. \u201cHuh? It\u2019s a crane, how\u2019s that not good enough for a chicken?\u201d\u201cAfter personally experiencing the gentleness of Chief Mentor Mu Wan, all other chicks and birds just don't cut it anymore.\u201d The little chick grinned.\u201cWhat a pervert.\u201d Li Tianming rolled his eyes, drawing out his Thunderfire Chain at the same time.Fang Zhao was in second level Spiritsource and was also the same age as Li Tianming, making him a worthy opponent. Had Li Tianming not lost Midas, even without the Saintbeast War-Soul, he would be a disciple of the journeyman class too. It was likely that he would be even stronger than Fang Zhao. It was a good time to check whether he had caught up with the years he had lost!Opposite Li Tianming, Fang Zhao had drawn out his third grade beastial weapon, the Wind Calling Rapier. It was well-sharpened, cutting through the wind as Fang Zhao dashed towards Li Tianming.From what Li Tianming remembered, Fang Zhao prided himself for his skill in movement arts. Such an opponent was definitely more threatening than Chen Ding. Not only was his speed faster, but his Whirlwind Zestful Crane had its own spiritsource abilities too.But that wasn\u2019t going to stop Li Tianming from giving him a good beating!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 49": "Chapter 49 - Supernal WindbladesPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cFeng Ling, now!\u201d Fang Zhao held the Wind Calling Rapier in his hands as he used his basic source-ranked battle art, the Whizzing Wind Steps. Within seconds, he was in front of Li Tianming, his rapier pointing directly at the latter\u2019s forehead.\u201cLi Tianming, let me show you what I have achieved in the past three years!\u201d Fang Zhao flourished his rapier, forming sword ki that enveloped Li Tianming completely. As for the little chick, he had ignored it completely.\u201cWelkin Cyclone Sword!\u201d That move was an intermediate source-ranked battle art, one that was only taught to disciples in the journeyman class. It was an honor to be able to learn such battle arts; if Fang Zhao were to return to his hometown now, even the governor had to respect his power.As Fang Zhao sealed Li Tianming\u2019s moves with his rapier, the Whirlwind Zestful Crane had taken to the air, its huge wings stirring up an even stronger gust. The crane was no less threatening than its master, its beak and claws as dangerous as his rapier.A beastmaster and beast duo\u2019s combat style would evolve as their cultivation advances. At Beast Vein, the focus was on martial arts and beastial arts, while in Spiritsource the lifebound beast would develop spiritsource abilities and become the main focus of the battle. Once they reached Unity, the duo\u2019s cooperation would reach a peak, and battle as one in their unity field.As such, while Fang Zhao used the Welkin Cyclone Sword, the crane was using its feathers and claws to wield the beastial art portion of the move, the Welkin Cyclone Claw. Its claws were like the sharpest daggers, tearing through trees and branches in its way as it went straight for Li Tianming\u2019s head.For an old classmate, Fang Zhao sure wasn\u2019t about to show any mercy.\u201cNo longer a wimp now huh? You definitely changed a lot in the past three years.\u201d Li Tianming found it funny. When they first entered the institute, Fang Zhao was cowardly and easily bullied. It seemed like the training at the institute had given him not only knowledge but courage as well.\u201cLi Tianming, the tables have turned, don\u2019t think you can still push me around now!\u201d Fang Zhao\u2019s sword got even faster, as he got more enthusiastic.Li Tianming was trying hard not to burst out laughing. Fang Zhao wasn\u2019t wrong, except that Li Tianming was not part of the group that bullied him. In fact, Li Tianming was the one that stood up for him when others bullied him.Under his opponent\u2019s suppression, Li Tianming focused his newly-gained ninth level Aeternal Infernal Beast Ki. Fang Zhao might be fast, but Li Tianming wasn\u2019t going to lose to him when it came to speed. Li Tianming gradually dialled up his speed, forming fiery mirages around him as if the atmosphere around him was burning. Ying Huo used the Confounding Mirage Walk too, its tiny figure even harder to track.Fang Zhao and his Whirlwind Zestful Crane pressed on even harder, their strikes strong enough to break rocks.\u201cAre you done yet?\u201d Li Tianming suddenly spun around to face Fang Zhao, the Thunderfire Chain shooting out of his hands like a spear. Entwined with bolts of lightning and sparks of flames, the chain pierced right through Fang Zhao\u2019s attack!At the same time, the Whirlwind Zestful Crane had prepared to flank Li Tianming, but was stopped by a sharp pain on its back. It turned its head to find a blazing little chick standing on its shoulder, digging into its flesh and pulling out its feathers.\u201cWhatchu lookin at, you ugly fowl?\u201d Yinghuo flew off, scattering into fiery mirages.An elegant crane getting disgraced by a mere chick? How could the egoistic crane take such a taunt? Consumed by its anger, the crane chased after the little chick, not realising that it was almost impossible for it to catch that little fireball.Without his lifebound beast\u2019s support, Fang Zhao was forced to step back to dodge Li Tianming\u2019s chains. Ashamed that he had the lower hand, especially when he was still being watched by his friends, he struck out once more with his Wind Calling Rapier.Alas, Li Tianming was too fast for him. The Thunderfire Chain was way too nimble for him, while Li Tianming\u2019s movement art was faster than his. In that split second, the chain and the rapier had clashed a dozen times in mid-air, their clinking sound echoing through the courtyard.Fang Zhao could feel the force of the chains travelling through his rapier each time their weapons clashed, its impact threatening to tear the rapier out of his hand!\u201cImpossible! A Beast Vein cultivator can\u2019t be this strong!\u201d Fang Zhao was not feeling so confident right now; in fact, he was even frightened by the predatory gleam in Li Tianming\u2019s eyes. Fang Zhao was never someone with a strong will to begin with, and as Li Tianming doubled down on his assault, his moves began to falter.At that instant, the Thunderfire Chain sped up once more, the metallic chains fully enveloped in flame like a blazing dragon. It was so fast that it even left afterimages behind, making use of Fang Zhao\u2019s hesitation to pierce his line of defence. With a few swift whirls, the chain had tied itself around Fang Zhao\u2019s waist.It was the intermediate source-ranked battle art, the Skyfire Soulbinder! It was Li Tianming\u2019s first time using it in battle, and honestly, he could hardly say he had done the move justice. Luckily for him, Fang Zhao wasn\u2019t focused, allowing him to execute the move successfully.With a swing of his wrist, the Thunderfire Chain had tangled itself onto Fang Zhao, binding and tying him up into a bundle. His Aeternal Infernal Beast Ki coursed through the chains, charring Fang Zhao\u2019s skin.Of course that wasn\u2019t all that the source-ranked battle art could do. To the audience\u2019s horror, Li Tianming swung his arm, throwing Fang Zhao into the air. With a shriek, Fang Zhao spun several rounds in mid air before landing behind Li Tianming.SPLAT!Fang Zhao\u2019s body crashed onto the ground, the impact almost shattering his bones. In his pain, he could only let out an agonizing cry. \u201cFeng Ling, SAVE ME!\u201dOn the other side, the crane was still playing hide and sick with the little chick, not expecting its master to be trashed so easily. When it saw Fang Zhao slamming into earth with the Thunderfire Chain tied around him, it was instantly enraged!Suddenly, all the feathers on the crane\u2019s body started glowing. With a terrifying burst, its feathers launched at Li Tianming like thousands of daggers. It was the crane\u2019s spiritsource ability, the Supernal Windblades!Undoubtedly, it was a threatening move, and even with movement arts, it was hard to dodge the feathers completely. Sadly, the two had made the mistake of not using this trump card earlier. With another swing of his wrist, Li Tianming had dragged Fang Zhao back to him, before brandishing his newly acquired human shield.\u201cAHHH!\u201d Knowing that the move could easily kill him, Fang Zhao let out a blood-curdling scream. With a sharp shudder, a puddle formed underneath his legs, accompanied by the sounds of water falling. Li Tianming rolled his eyes \u2014 Fang Zhao had not really changed in the past three years.The crane did not expect such a play from Li Tianming, and it could only try to abort the attack and retract the feathers back to its body. But the crane had forgotten about the little chick, who suddenly emerged to slap its wings with the Netherfire Ghostclaw. Unprotected by its feathers, the slap shattered the crane\u2019s wing, sending the bloodied crane to the ground.Having dissolved the crane\u2019s attack, Li Tianming flung the still-peeing Fang Zhao to his classmates.\u201cTake him away from me. Oh and remind him to change his pants.\u201d Li Tianming kept his Thunderfire Chain, an unruffled smile on his face.The group hurriedly scattered, causing Fang Zhao to crash into the ground yet again. After all, no one wanted to catch someone who\u2019d just peed his pants!\u201cLI TIANMING! I will make sure to return all these humiliation to you ten times stronger!\u201d Rage pulsed through Fang Zhao\u2019s veins, as he trembled to crawl back up and stared at Li Tianming with bloodshot eyes.\u201cChange your pants first before talking about making a comeback...\u201d Li Tianming said. Fang Zhao looked too pathetic right now, and the audience were trying hard to contain their laughter.\u201cWhat are you all waiting for?\u201d Fang Zhao stared at Lu Guanxiong and the others in disbelief.They briefly exchanged a few looks with each other, before coming to a quick conclusion. They had arrived together with Fang Zhao, and if they were to just leave with Fang Zhao being crushed so easily, they would surely become a joke amongst the journeyman disciples.Then again, they were shocked to see Li Tianming\u2019s triumph too. They had expected to be able to easily crush Li Tianming, given their three years advantage in cultivation. But Li Tianming\u2019s victory was plain shocking, to the point that Fang Zhao had even pissed in his pants. Their attitudes towards Li Tianming had taken a drastic change, and at least they no longer treated him as that fool who returned to the institute to be shamed.That being said, they weren't afraid either. They would suppress Li Tianming together to tell him that he had messed with the wrong people.\u201cLi Tianming, for someone who just returned to the institute, you seem to have forgotten the rules here. From what we see, you probably need a good beating to remember who are the seniors here,\u201d Lu Guanxiong said, as the group of them closed in on Li Tianming with burning eyes.Fang Zhao was but the weakest amongst them. Lu Guanxiong, for example, was in third level Spiritsource, and should they team up against Li Tianming, there was nothing he could do.\u201cKudos to you for having the face to say such things.\u201d Li Tianming was speechless at their utter lack of shame. Must they go to such an extent to just flex their sense of superiority?\u201cWho gave you the courage to talk back to us?\u201d They were already within reach of Li Tianming.All of a sudden, Li Tianming started grinning after a peek over their shoulders, and said, \u201cAre you all going to gang up on a fresh disciple in the Muwan class? For someone who only just graduated from her class, you might want to show her a little more respect.\u201d\u201cCut your bullshit,\u201d Lu Guanxiong sneered. He knew that Li Tianming was trying to use Chief Mentor Mu Wan\u2019s name to scare them off.\u201cAnd who\u2019s bullshitting?\u201d Just then a sinister female voice sounded from behind Fang Zhao\u2019s group. The voice was like a bolt of thunder, causing them to jump in shock, as they slowly turned behind. And when they saw the owner of the voice, their faces were flushed of all colors.\u201cChief mentor, please avenge Fang Zhao! Li Tianming shamed and injured him, and we were just trying to help him seek justice\u2026\u201d Lu Guanxiong tried to salvage the situation.\u201cExcuses, excuses. Coming back here to act cocky just days after graduating to journeyman class, and you still want to blame others when you get defeated? You all better hope you don\u2019t need medical attention after I\u2019m done with you all.\u201dFang Zhao\u2019s group could only tremble in despair when Chief Mentor Mu Wan announced their sentence. For the next ten minutes or so, each of them received a good beating from Mu Wan before they could crawl out from the courtyard crying. Even the already injured Fang Zhao wasn\u2019t spared, and the only one that got out of the hook was Lin Qingyu, who wasn\u2019t one of those threatening Li Tianming.\u201cNext time you all want to try this again, better come prepared for what I can to do to you all.\u201d Mu Wan smiled menacingly. That caused the group to scatter off even faster, and poor Fang Zhao nearly peed in his pants a second time.\u201cScram.\u201d With a fierce stare, the watching freshmen hurried off as well, having seen how intimidating their chief mentor could get.One thing they knew for sure was that no matter what the rest of the world thought of Li Tianming, Chief Mentor Mu Wan seemed to take particular interest in him. Some were angry with Mu Wan, while others jealous of Li Tianming, but there was nothing they could do. After all, Li Tianming had just defeated their senior from the journeyman class, a feat hard to imagine from an apprentice disciple.Soon, only Li Tianming and Mu Wan was left in the courtyard. But a moment later, a middle-aged man appeared behind Chief Mentor Mu Wan. He wore a golden robe, his long hair combed neatly behind his back. The man had a clean-shaven face, and golden sparks seemed to shoot out from his eyes.The man had an aura of a real expert, even making Mu Wan look tame when he stood beside her. He was no doubt one of the titans of the institute.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 50": "Chapter 50 - Li Tianming\u2019s Reverse Scale!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cDisciple Li Tianming greets the hall overseer.\u201d Li Tianming recognised this man, and hurriedly paid his respects. This man was one of Flameyellow Scions Institute\u2019s five hall overseers, specifically the Hall of Phoenix, Wei Zikun.In the institute, only the chancellor and several personages from Heaven\u2019s Sanctum held higher positions than the five hall overseers. To command the Hall of Phoenix, Wei Zikun had to be young and promising. Despite being slightly younger than Li Yanfeng, he was already at the peak of Vermilion Bird.When Li Tianming had been studying at the institute for a year in the past, he had never really met this overseer before. Yet, he unexpectedly appeared here today.Naturally, it wasn\u2019t for him. The overseer gave Li Tianming a once-over. \u201cMu Wan, this is your new disciple?\u201d\u201cYes, hall overseer.\u201d Mu Wan\u2019s words were respectful and serious, a far cry from her usual personality.\u201cThe ranking battles are in three days. Although you\u2019re on the older side, your strength is still passable. Get a good rank, and bring glory to our Hall of Phoenix. After all, they don\u2019t care about your age there.\u201dThe admission test would consider the participant\u2019s age and deduct the appropriate marks.However, the ranking battle wanted a standardised system. Furthermore, there was only so much difference to the ages in the apprentice class, so age wasn\u2019t considered. Hence, Li Tianming\u2019s age would be an advantage and not a disadvantage.Mu Wan glanced at him. \u201cWhy are you still acting so stunned?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll do my best, hall overseer,\u201d Li Tianming said seriously.\u201cThe overseers shall be attending the ranking battles. I\u2019ll be watching your performance.\u201d Once he was done speaking, he smiled at Mu Wan, \u201cAre you ready? The Lantern Festival is about to begin.\u201d\u201cYes, hall overseer.\u201d Mu Wan nodded.\u201cWhen we\u2019re out to relax, there\u2019s no need to be so formal. Brother Kun will do fine.\u201d\u201cYes, brother Kun.\u201d\u201cPlease.\u201dThe two must have made an appointment to go and see the Lantern Festival together.The overseer had been waiting for Mu Wan for a while, when they heard the commotion and came over. Now that Fang Zhao had been driven away, they were naturally going to leave. As they were leaving, Mu Wan gave Li Tianming a glare, a warning for him not to cause any trouble.Now, only Li Tianming and Ying Huo were left.\u201cHeartbroken? That old man is chasing your Chief Mentor Mu Wan,\u201d the little chick gloated.\u201cIt seems you can\u2019t tell. Look at how respectful she was, she obviously doesn\u2019t like him. I heard long ago that the hall overseer was interested in her, just that she\u2019s always rejected him,\u201d Li Tianming said indifferently.In truth, Mu Wan definitely had some kind of background to always be able to reject the advances of someone with Wei Zikun\u2019s status. In the Hall of Phoenix, Wei Zikun\u2019s words were law, and the Hall was itself practically one fifth of the whole Institute.To be honest, all of these weren\u2019t very important to him. What was important were the ranking battles in three days from now.It was definitely going to be ten times more bustling than the admission test.Not only would the five hall overseers attend, but so would some important figures of Ignispolis. In fact, this also included people from the Vermilion Bird royal clan, Lightning Manor, Occult Athenaeum and Xing & Chen Merchantry. After all, they had juniors participating in battles to decide their prospects and reputation.How the apprentice class was ranked and who became the prime disciple were matters the entire Vermilion Bird paid attention to. These juniors were the future, and the medium through which the clans\u2019 legacies passed down.A clan needed to spawn droves of geniuses if it wanted to stand the test of time. And how could it be determined if they had these geniuses? Simple, through the Flameyellow Scions Institute ranking battles!The geniuses of Heaven\u2019s Sanctum like Lin Xiaoting and Mu Qingqing might also be spectating from some private room.Li Tianming continued his training.He was especially hardworking. Although he could let the little chick do the work and relax on the side, he chose not to do so. He was making progress steadily, so that he would have more to work with during battle.Two days passed in a whirl. Tomorrow was the day of the ranking battles.Li Tianming naturally hadn\u2019t forgotten the promise he had made with his mother. She wanted to personally witness his fight. There would be no time the next day, so he planned to pick her up that night.This was very important to Li Tianming. This might be his only chance to enter Heaven\u2019s Sanctum, which was key to curing his mother. He hoped his mother could watch him. Because then, he could unleash 200% of his potential!Li Tianming hadn\u2019t seen Wei Jing for several days as he was busy cultivating. \u201cI wonder if she\u2019s gotten used to living to living in Ignispolis yet.\u201dHe had hired an auntie to reside there and provide for her meals. Wei Jing should be living comfortably apart from her illness. In the dark night, he threaded through the dark alleyways to return to the newly bought house. It wasn\u2019t far from the institute, so it would take him about seven minutes to reach it. The Lantern Festival was celebrated for days in Ignispolis. All the roads were jam-packed with people carousing, a picturesque scene of happiness. The hustle and bustle of Ignispolis was one Flamehaven would never have.When Li Tianming reached his home, he saw from afar that all of the lamps had been doused and the place was pitch-black. \u201cMother went to sleep so early?\u201dLi Tianming stealthily opened the door so that he wouldn\u2019t wake up. He walked to the east wing of the house, which was the largest room and also Wei Jing\u2019s bedroom.However, what greeted Li Tianming wasn\u2019t even breathing, but pained gasps!Wei Jing was definitely inside. Moreover, something had clearly happened! Whether it was her illness or other reasons, Li Tianming would only know after going in.In the dark night, Li Tianming\u2019s two eyes couldn\u2019t see clearly, but the eye in his left palm had night vision; to him, the dark night was like daytime to him. Without any hesitation, Li Tianming directly opened the door and entered.\u201cPlease don\u2019t let there be anything wrong,\u201d Li Tianming prayed.Wei Jing was very weak now, which left Li Tianming\u2019s heart pounding.When he entered, Li Tianming saw Wei Jing lying down on the bed, covered in a blanket. While it seemed to be normal sleep, she was tossing and turning, her breathing feeble and laboured.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?!\u201d Li Tianming felt his heart clench. Seeing Wei Jing in pain was what he couldn\u2019t stand the most. He sped to his mother\u2019s side, and ripped off the blanket. The next moment, his eyes turned bloodshot when he found dozens of worms, blood-coloured and thumb-sized, crawling all over her body.The worms were all nausea inducing. They possessed rings of sharp teeth that they were currently using to gnaw on Wei Jing\u2019s flesh and suck her blood!Li Tianming felt his heart being ripped apart by the sight.\u201cBloodhell Worms!\u201d Li Tianming immediately recognised them, much to his horror. Bloodhell Worms were a type of leech that fed on human blood.Wei Jing didn't have any ability to resist. Her lifebound beast was suffering from Lifesbane as well and was currently sprawled in a corner of the room. Its body was covered with even more Bloodhell Worms than Wei Jing.But, who put them on Wei Jing, a defenceless and sick person?Beast ki began to leak out from Li Tianming. If he had gotten back just a bit later, Wei Jing might have been a desiccated husk.If that happened, he would be left guilty for the rest of his life.He didn\u2019t need to be told that there was someone else in the room with him, the very culprit for this.\u201cFlameyellow Scions Institute disciple Li Tianming, you\u2019ve kept me waiting.\u201d A sorrowful voice drifted towards Li Tianming from behind.When Li Tianming turned around, he only saw a man dressed in skintight black clothes lurking within the shadows. His face was covered in a black veil that revealed only his eyes. The most eye-catching thing was the beautiful blood-coloured flower on his chest.\u201cBloodflower Chamber.\u201d Li Tianming made the obvious conclusion from that dead giveaway. In Vermilion Bird, Bloodflower Chamber was a name that could make people jump in fright just with its name. They were an underground organisation that handled contract killing. While they demanded high prices, their success rate was high, which afforded them a high reputation in the world of killers.However, Li Tianming had never expected them to come after him. It was obvious Wei Jing wasn\u2019t the target, or else Wei Jing would have died long ago.Li Tianming didn\u2019t bother asking who had called the hit on him. It was a basic tenet of the opponent\u2019s job not to share details of their employer. In fact, it was likely he didn\u2019t even know. The assassins would never meet the employer.For the opponent to be sent to kill him, it meant they were certain of his strength and had sent someone who was guaranteed to kill him.Now, Wei Jing and Li Tianming were in a crisis, one they were likely to perish in.Contract killers were cruel and merciless, and would never pity their prey. It was a completely different sort of opponent from anyone Li Tianming had faced before. Previously, Li Tianming could still casually joke around, but now, he felt the very real possibility of death was pressed against his throat.As the man spoke, Li Tianming saw a giant worm as thick as a thigh wriggling about on the ground. Both its head and tail had an opening.The head\u2019s opening was filled with rows of sharp teeth, while the thumb-sized Bloodhell Worms continued to pour out of its tail opening in the thousands. The Bloodhell Worms had already filled everywhere, from the roof, floor to the walls.This giant worm was definitely a Bloodhell Broodmother!This was a fierce lifebound beast that wasn\u2019t exactly a beast. Bloodhell Broodmothers were a doubly special lifebound beast, special in both species and type.Their species was a leech, a kind of annelid lifebound beast. Its type was a broodmother-type, which could spawn large numbers of offspring to use for attacks. Some ant and bee queen lifebound beasts would belong to this type. Hence, this Bloodhell Broodmother was a broodmother-type annelid lifebound beast!Li Tianming was furious. Wei Jing was his reverse scale! For tormenting her so, Li Tianming would definitely rip this man to pieces.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 51": "Chapter 51 - Kill Him!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cBastard.\u201dAs Li Tianming spoke, Ying Huo had already flown over to Wei Jing. Its eyes were already ablaze when it saw this scene. Its beak, which was flaming as well, began to peck the Bloodhell Worms to death one by one.However, that didn\u2019t end Wei Jing\u2019s pain. Bloodhell Worms contained the paralytic Bloodhell Poison, which was administered into their prey during feeding. Furthermore, even more Bloodhell Worms were approaching Wei Jing from her bedside. The swarm would never end as long as the Bloodhell Broodmother continued to spawn them.This was the most troublesome part of broodmother-type lifebound beasts.\u201cYour head is worth one thousand yellow-patterned spirit gems. I\u2019ll be borrowing it.\u201d The black-clothed man took action as he spoke. As killers, they never talked too much.He was holding a blood-coloured dagger that looked similar to Li Tianming\u2019s Crimson Blood Dagger, except that it was of a much higher quality.The moment of mortal danger had arrived. The little chick was busy protecting Wei Jing, tied down by the many worms. Hence, Li Tianming had to deal with both the man and the Bloodhell Broodmother himself.When the black-clothed man turned into a blur, the broodmother opened its maw and let loose a piercing screech that nearly ruptured Li Tianming\u2019s ears. His mind descended into chaos immediately, his vision distorting. This was a sound-based spiritsource ability. It was the hardest to defend against, and could only be endured. Li Tianming hadn\u2019t expected such an ability from this Bloodhell Broodmother.Things were definitely going to be hard for him and the little chick who lacked such spiritsource abilities.\u201cDie!\u201d Even more frightening was that the assassin was at least at fourth level Spiritsource! He was much stronger than Fang Zhao, enough to crush Li Tianming.Bloodflower Chamber always did things with complete confidence. The assassins they chose would not give Li Tianming any chance to escape.In the same moment Li Tianming was assaulted by the broodmother\u2019s \u2018Wailing Banshee\u2019, the assassin appeared in front of him, while at least five hundred Bloodhell Worms surged towards him from the roof and floor.A moment was enough for dozens to attach themselves to his body, whereupon they began to nibble at his flesh. They went straight for his arteries, preparing to feast on his blood.Li Tianming could only struggle before the deadly, two-pronged threat. The other side was much stronger than he was. With a blur, the assassin appeared behind him, the dagger resting against Li Tianming\u2019s collarbone. A nick of the blade later, blood began to flow freely.\u201cLet\u2019s not waste anything.\u201d The assassin pulled aside his veil and gave Li Tianming\u2019s dripping blood a lick. \u201cMhm, quite hot.\u201dThe black-clothed man chuckled, continuing, \u201cMy babies seem to like your blood a lot. I\u2019ll let you live a little longer for their enjoyment. Human blood is the warmest when the human is still alive, after all.\u201dHe leaned in so close to Li Tianming that their eyes were almost right next to each other.The Bloodhell Poison had already spread to his whole body. It felt like an electric shock had run through his body and Li Tianming found even moving a finger to be difficult.\u201cHow does it feel to be sucked dry?\u201d The assassin looked at him, clearly enjoying it and not wanting it to end yet.\u201cCareful my blood doesn\u2019t burn you to death!\u201d Li Tianming glared at him, his eyes bloodshot.Wei Jing\u2019s pain was unacceptable to Li Tianming. She was his reverse scale, something that could make him descend into becoming a crazed demon. Li Tianming no longer considered the gap in strength between his opponent and him. Only the thought of killing him filled his entire mind. This was the first time his killing intent had been so stirred since Midas died.\u201cBurn to death? Good joke.\u201d The man laughed unbridledly.However, the next moment, the worms crawling on Li Tianming started to spontaneously combust. They were quickly reduced to ash that fell to the ground.The assassin\u2019s eyes widened. Something like this had never happened before. How was he expected to know about Primordial Chaos Beasts?\u201cUnusual, but so what? You can only die with the Bloodhell Poison in you.\u201d The assassin now understood not to give this young man any chances. Li Tianming couldn\u2019t move, so he drew his dagger and prepared to decapitate Li Tianming.\u201cWho decided I can only die?\u201d Li Tianming, who the assassin believed was immobile, raised his left hand.The assassin saw something unbelievable. There was a strange eye on the young man\u2019s palm. Then, beast ki circulated through its illusion-type spirit veins and the Bewildering Eye revealed itself.The assassin had never expected Li Tianming to move nor plunge him into an illusion!He was too close. Unable to react, he could only watch as Li Tianming\u2019s beast claw immediately ran him through and crushed all his organs!\u201cDie!\u201d Li Tianming snarled as the assassin looked at him, eyes filled with disbelief. The assassin slowly sank to his knees, blood gushing out like a river.His body finally crumpled over, dead.\u201cYou as well!\u201d Li Tianming swung his right arm, and the Thunderfire Chain wrapped around the Bloodhell Broodmother. Its strong point was its army of Bloodhell Worms, but it was too close to Li Tianming.It attempted to use Wailing Banshee to confuse Li Tianming, but Li Tianming was a step ahead in using his Bewildering Eye.The chain\u2019s sharp edges split the broodmother into several sections. It didn\u2019t matter what level of lifebound beast you were, you would still go to hell before the current Li Tianming!All of the worms collapsed into dust at the death of the broodmother, as they were originally just a part of it.The night\u2019s events came to a close, leaving behind a room covered in blood. The little chick was exhausted too, having fended off many worms to protect Wei Jing.It had been a really close shave, but strangely enough, Li Tianming felt no fear. He realised his heart was much stronger than before, stronger than anyone else. It was through this heart he had weathered this crisis.Although the assassin was dead, Wei Jing was still being tormented by the poison. Killing him hadn\u2019t been enough to soothe Li Tianming\u2019s anger nor save Wei Jing. Li Tianming had also been poisoned, but the poison within him had been neutralised already. However, he was still aware of how vile it was. Moreover, he was a healthy youth in his prime, while his mother was like a flickering candle about to go out.\u201cMy apologies for arriving late.\u201d A young-looking man appeared in the room. He was dressed in a long robe covered in stars. His eyes sparkled in the darkness like a starfield. He no longer hid his identity and showed his true appearance.As expected of one of the Starry Twins, Sage Chen of Xing & Chen Merchantry did possess a dignified and elegant bearing.The moment he had been thrust into danger, Li Tianming had crushed the spirit gem he had been given. Still, Sage Chen still needed time to arrive no matter how mighty he was. He had already arrived rather swiftly, considering everything had wrapped up quickly.\u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t expect such a situation.\u201d The spirit gem Sage Chen had handed him had been for more standard situations, such as a senior suppressing Li Tianming or Wei Jing\u2019s illness flaring up.He definitely hadn\u2019t expected someone to try assassinating this nameless nobody.\u201cIt\u2019s alright. My mother\u2019s been infected with the Bloodhell Poison.\u201d This was what Li Tianming was most worried about now.\u201cBloodhell Poison? Don\u2019t worry, I can cure it.\u201dLi Tianming had faith in Sage Chen\u2019s abilities, so he stepped back.Sage Chen took a quick glance before saying, \u201cIt\u2019ll be fine. Bloodhell Poison is a type of paralytic agent. It\u2019ll hurt, but it won\u2019t have any adverse effects on the body. I\u2019ll just use spirit herbs to hasten the detoxification.\u201dLi Tianming felt much more relieved after hearing that. He didn\u2019t add anything, and as Sage Chen helped Wei Jing, he brought the corpse to the courtyard to incinerate the corpse, leaving no trace behind.Then, he cleaned up the bloodstains in the room.\u201cYou\u2019re back, young master?\u201d The auntie in charge of looking after Wei Jing finally woke up from the firelight. The disturbance before hadn\u2019t been very loud as Li Tianming had quickly killed his enemy.Li Tianming smiled. \u201cI\u2019m bringing my mother along to watch my ranking battles in the institute tomorrow.\u201d\u201cYoung master really is a genius! I\u2019m jealous of the madam for having such a great kid.\u201d\u201cYou flatter me. I should be the one thanking you for caring for my mother.\u201d\u201cYoung master pays me well and the madam is so nice as well. I\u2019ll naturally do my best. Right, what are you burning?\u201d She asked curiously.\u201cA corpse!\u201d Li Tianming grinned.\u201cYou really do know how to crack jokes. I won\u2019t be scared so easily.\u201d Auntie Li laughed back.\u201cIs that so? Have a good rest, I\u2019ll be going in to accompany my mother.\u201d\u201cAlright. Give me a holler if you need anything.\u201dThe ordinary people in the city really were so pure that it was cute.On the other hand, the powerful clans were so vile to the point demons were probably better friends.Who was it that had been so vicious to call a hit on him?\u201cTo think that the Bloodflower Chamber was even involved... who did you offend? Their rules insist on accepted missions being completed. This means another will come soon.\u201d\u201cHow is she?\u201d Li Tianming asked.\u201cShe\u2019ll be fine after a night\u2019s rest. The main problem is her Lifesbane. As long as it's removed, she will recover her vitality.\u201d\u201cHow do I do that?\u201d Li Tianming asked.\u201cIt\u2019s not convenient for me to say if she didn\u2019t tell you. Anyway, someone in Heaven\u2019s Sanctum can do it,\u201d Sage Chen said.\u201cAlright.\u201d Li Tianming nodded. \u201cThe Chamber won\u2019t dare do anything as long as I\u2019m within the institute compound, right?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWhat about my mother?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry. It was my negligence this time. I\u2019ll assign someone to protect her from the shadows.\"\u201cThank you.\u201d Li Tianming wouldn\u2019t know what to do if not for this man. Perhaps his only option would be to beg Mu Wan to bring his mother into the institute.\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Your mother and I had a friendship. I couldn\u2019t possibly stand by and watch her die. Still, it\u2019s better for you to not tell her I came by, or about the guard detail.\"\u201cI understand.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll be going first. I\u2019ll be watching your performance tomorrow.\u201d Sage Chen rose to his feet, probably to arrange for the protection. He had so many trusted subordinates that this wasn\u2019t anything difficult.After he left, Li Tianming lay together with the little chick in the courtyard to watch the starry sky.\u201cI thought I was going to die,\u201d Li Tianming said softly. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t. Now I suddenly have this feeling, that maybe, I won\u2019t die in this life.\u201dEverything seemed to have calmed down, but in reality, the fire in his heart was still raging.\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d The little chick asked, confused.Li Tianming suddenly stood up and looked at it passionately.\u201cWhat?\u201d The little chick subconsciously covered its chest. \u201cHey, if you have those kinds of desires, don\u2019t come to me. I don\u2019t like guys!\u201d\u201cMoron.\u201d Li Tianming gave it a smack. \u201cI suddenly have some enlightenment. Why don't we shoot for Spiritsource tonight?!\u201dThey had only been in ninth level Beast Vein for three days.\u201cHave you gone cray cray?\u201d\u201cNope.\u201d It was only that his confidence had suddenly become boundless, enough to attempt for Spiritsource!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 52": "Chapter 52 - Infernalsource!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLi Tianming reached Spiritsource about half a month before the incident three years ago. Together with Midas, they had gathered the strength of their eighteen beast veins to form five spiritsources on their body.\u201cThe step from Beast Vein to Spiritsource is a breakthrough from one stage to another. It could take hours for some, but years for others, and in certain cases people have tried for a decade with no success,\u201d Li Tianming muttered. \u201cSuch a breakthrough requires not just hard work, but also experience and the correct methods of cultivation. More importantly, the cultivator needs a stable state of mind as well as a spark of enlightenment. I've reached Spiritsource before, so no other ninth level Beast Vein cultivator can be more experienced than I am. And in terms of cultivation methods, Ying Huo\u2019s Aeternal Infernal Codex is absolutely unsurpassed too. \u201dNow that he had satisfied the first two criteria, Li Tianming just needed to adjust his mindset and feel that spark. After escaping the assassination by the skin of his teeth, Li Tianming could feel that he had entered a state of transcendence. He was calm and rational, yet his blood boiled with passion and fury. It was an otherworldly feeling \u2014 his beast ki was rushing through his body, but everything was kept under control by his faith and determination.Ying Huo could feel his passion and his determination too. His actions were like a battle cry, calling out to the little chick to stand up against their fate.\u201cFine, you want to breakthrough, I\u2019ll accompany you,\u201d said the little chick, a fire beginning to burn in its eyes too.\u201cThen let\u2019s get started!\u201d Li Tianming sat himself down in the dim courtyard, the little chick resting on the top of his head like a ball of fire. As their beast veins connected to each other, the duo gradually became one.Li Tianming could clearly remember the last time he tried to reach Spiritsource. From the starting point, till eventually getting there, he had taken a total of three months. In those three months, he and Midas had tried thousands of times, made thousands of errors, before he eventually achieved Spiritsource.But this time, as the little chick started running its Aeternal Infernal Codex, and as their beast ki joined together and ignited, the correct answer seemed so blatantly obvious to Li Tianming! There was only one path ahead of them, and it was a path that would eventually lead the pair to greatness. Without hesitation, Li Tianming and Ying Huo started their breakthrough, their mind fixed on their goals and unimpeded by any obstacles.Just as Li Tianming had said just now, having survived that assassination, he felt that no one in this world could kill him anymore. At that instance, he charged on towards the Spiritsource stage, and nothing could deter his burning ardor!\u201cRahh!\u201d He let out a ghastly roar to vent out the emotions that were building up in him. He recalled his downfall, thought about Midas and ran through everything that happened in the past three years! And all of them were his motivation to cultivate, to seek the path to achieving true strength.The method that they were using to form the spiritsource was known as the Infernalsource. It got its name from the Infernal Realm, a mythical place where everything would be burnt to ashes, and neither chaos nor reincarnation could escape its blaze. It was a fiery hell spoken of only in legends, a world where nothing survived but flames.As Ying Huo guided him with the Infernalsource, their eighteen beast veins joined together to circulate their beast ki in their bodies. A while later, Li Tianming could vaguely see the position of their spiritsources. Since Midas could give him five spiritsources, Li Tianming expected the little chick to give him six since it had six stars in its eyes and was considered a six-star lifebound beast. However contrary to his expectations, he only felt a single spiritsource form, located at his dantian!The number of spiritsources beastmasters and their beasts had not only decided the maximum capacity of their beast ki, but also the number of spiritsource abilities they could refine. Six spiritsources could mean six vastly different spiritsource abilities, but with only one spiritsource they could only refine a single ability. On top of that, they would be basically handicapped when fighting opponents of the same level, as others may have six times the beast ki.As a three-star lifebound beast was the minimum requirement to reach the Spiritsource stage, beastmasters with a single spiritsource probably never existed before. Obviously, such a phenomenon was a surprise to Li Tianming.Yet he was not worried at all, given his trust towards Ying Huo. It was the Aeternal Infernal Phoenix, its bloodline prestigious and sacred; there was no way their spiritsource would be ordinary. Li Tianming reckoned that the spiritsource they formed was none other than the infernalsource itself!The two of them each developed a single infernalsource. While Li Tianming\u2019s infernalsource was in his dantian, Ying Huo\u2019s one was in its stomach. Considering that it was a being that feasted on suns and stars, the position of its spiritsource was an apt metaphor for its nature.As all his beast ki flushed towards this only infernalsource that he had, Li Tianming could feel the infernalsource expanding from the sheer amount of Aeternal Infernal Beast Ki. It was the size of a normal spiritsource at first, but as time went passed, it expanded continuously.The formation of spiritsources was much more complicated than the formation of beast veins, and the time it took was exponentially longer too. While other cultivators would develop their spiritsources one after another in sequence, Li Tianming had been working on that one single spiritsource from the beginning.From midnight all the way till the break of dawn, Li Tianming channeled beast ki into his infernalsource until it had swollen to an unfathomable size. Having prior experience, he knew what the size of a normal person\u2019s spiritsource was and how much beast ki it could hold. Compared to that, his infernalsource was currently seven to eight times bigger than normal ones. That meant when fighting opponents of the same level, not only was his Aeternal Infernal Beast Ki already superior in terms of quality, but he could also store more of it. This placed him at the level of beastmasters with eight-star lifebound beasts, maybe even nine! Li Tianming had never heard of people with eight-star lifebound beasts before, as not a single one had ever appeared in Vermilion Bird\u2019s history. In this nation, anyone who owned a seven-star lifebound beast was enough to make the nation tremble!As such, Li Tianming was essentially invincible when fighting at the same level. He could even easily fight opponents of a higher level than him with that superior beast ki of his!The only question that remained was how many spiritsource abilities could Ying Huo refine with that single infernalsource? Or could it be possible that it didn\u2019t even need to refine spiritsource abilities from wildbeasts? As their cultivation approached its end, and the hell-like infernalsource formed completely, Li Tianming had a rough guess in his mind.He observed his infernalsource, and realised that it looked just like a real inferno. It was now the core of his body, a center that connected to all nine of his beast veins, and also a passage to Ying Huo\u2019s infernalsource. Ying Huo might be much tinier in size, but the nature of its infernalsource was just the same as Li Tianming\u2019s.The little chick suddenly exclaimed in excitement. \u201cI can feel it! My body, it\u2019s awakening!\u201dLi Tianming opened his eyes. The sun had yet to rise and that the world was still deep in slumber. Just then, the little chick raised its head, letting out a cry like a rooster crowing.Whoosh!It released a ball of flame that floated in the air! The golden flame was about ten times the size of its body, and immediately took on the shape of a blazing phoenix as it charged into the air. The phoenix stayed aloft like a miniature sun, lighting up the entire district that they were in. Phoenixes were mythical creatures that appeared only in the oldest legends, and were a symbol of faith for many. The Hall of Phoenix in the institute took its name after this king of all avian beasts, and Li Tianming had read legends describing its looks there, which was why he could confirm that it was a blazing phoenix.With another breath, Ying Huo sucked the phoenix back into its stomach.\u201cHmm, if wildbeasts could get abilities after reaching Spiritsource, then what I just used was that ability. It\u2019s called the Infernal Blaze, and it\u2019s a fire that will burn eternally and cannot be extinguished unless I retract it myself,\u201d Ying Huo explained proudly.\u201cThis must be different from the spiritsource abilities that lifebound beasts have. Those were refined from beast souls of wildbeasts and then channeled into their spiritsources, as lifebound beasts born with no abilities,\u201d Li Tianming observed. \u201cFor your case, this is more of a bloodline ability that was gifted by your blood.\u201dLi Tianming had seen the power of the Infernal Blaze! As long as it came into contact with an enemy, there would be no way to get rid of it. They would need to test it out in battle to see how well it worked, but of course they had complete faith in the bloodline ability of a Primordial Chaos Beast.\u201cWe still don\u2019t know whether my infernalsource is capable of refining beast souls to form spiritsource abilities. We shall try one day, but then again there\u2019s no way those would be stronger than my Infernal Blaze.\u201d Ying Huo was proud of its newfound strength.\u201cI feel like you possess the traits of both wildbeasts and lifebound beasts. It\u2019s likely that you had your own bloodline abilities like wildbeasts, but at the same time can refine beast souls like lifebound beasts too,\u201d Li Tianming guessed.Even if Ying Huo had turned from a Primordial Chaos Beast to a lifebound beast, it had not lost all of its power. In fact it may have opened up other possibilities for the little chick as well. While other beasts\u2019 spiritsource could only contain a single spiritsource ability, his infernalsource already came with its own Infernal Blaze. Considering its size and capacity, they wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it could refine beast souls to obtain spiritsource abilities as well.The duo eventually ended their cultivation, and the heat building up in the courtyard slowly cooled. Li Tianming felt the beast ki running through his body, realising how much stronger he had gotten.\u201cI\u2019m finally back at the level I was at three years ago, but I\u2019m so much stronger now,\u201d Li Tianming exclaimed. While he had five spiritsources three years ago, it simply wouldn\u2019t compare with that one infernalsource in his dantian.\u201cIt\u2019s time to bring our mother to the institute,\u201d the little chick declared. \u201cShould I find out who tried to assassinate us and hurt our mother, I will make sure his soul burns in the depth of hell!\u201dLi Tianming was not in a rush though, since he was confident that they would find out the truth eventually. For now, the more important thing was to get into Heaven\u2019s Sanctum.The sun began to rise, marking a new day... and the beginning of the ranking test!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 53": "Chapter 53 - Can You Defeat Chen Yao?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayFor Wei Jing, she felt like she had a terrible nightmare the previous night. But when she woke up, the first thing she saw was her son sitting by her bedside, telling her, \u201cWhy have you gotten so lazy lately? The ranking test is about to begin soon, hurry up and prepare.\u201d\u201cAh, Auntie Li, come and help me!\u201d Li Tianming ran off.Wei Jing crawled out of bed hurriedly to prepare for the big day. Auntie Li had done most of the preparations already, and all Wei Jing needed to do was to wash up and get onto the brand new horse cart.The tickets for the ranking test of the Flameyellow Scions Institute were rather expensive, but of course Li Tianming had prepared for that. In fact, a ticket had been prepared for Auntie Li too, so that she could take care of his mother\u2019s needs even when they were inside the stadium. The guards that Sage Chen assigned them should be following Wei Jing as well, and it was only with their help that Li Tianming could place his focus on cultivation. It was still early in the morning when Li Tianming drove the horse cart to the institute. By then, the place was already stuffed with people, but Li Tianming could get ahead of the queue as he was one of the disciples of the institute. As such, he could bring his mother into the stadium and pick a nice cozy spot that had a good view of the arenas.A look into the stadium told them that tens of thousands of spectators had already seated themselves comfortably inside the stadium. The private rooms, allocated to the rich and powerful of Vermilion Bird, were also filled, their inhabitants ready to watch the show that was about to occur. But of course, the interior of their rooms were hidden from the general audience\u2019s view, since normal citizens were not permitted to see what was happening inside.The ranking test of the Flameyellow Scions Institute was of course hosted by the institute, and the guests in the private rooms would have no influence over the test proceedings. They were just here to watch a good show.In the arenas, the newly-enlisted disciples who managed to clear their admission test had taken their position. The result of their ranking test would follow them for their time in the institute, and it was a label that would decide the amount of respect and resources they get. It was no doubt a fight that the disciples would put their best effort in.Li Tianming had settled Wei Jing down, and was about to join the rest from Muwan class when the voice of a woman sounded from behind them. He turned around to find a flamboyantly dressed Madam Xue Lan walking into the institute, surrounded by a bunch of ladies. They were heading for their allocated room when they walked past and noticed Li Tianming and Wei Jing.By her side was her son, Chen Yao, who was dressed in a dazzling purple robe. Handsome, capable young men like him were always a sight to admire, especially for teenage girls.\u201cYou can go ahead first, I will join you in a jiffy,\u201d Xue Lan told the rest of the ladies, and walked towards Li Tianming, accompanied by Chen Yao.\u201cJing\u2019er.\u201d Xue Lan wore a smile as she gently held Wei Jing\u2019s hand and said, \u201cWhy did you not go to Chen Yao Inn the other day? I'd already arranged everything for you, but you never showed up.\u201d\u201cI was delayed by other matters. And since it just so happened that Tianming managed to get hold of some gems, we managed to get our own house and decided not to trouble you.\u201d Wei Jing wore an unruffled look, and she didn\u2019t get angry at Xue Lan either. She wasn\u2019t going to waste her emotions on people that had already disappointed her.Xue Lan shook her head pretentiously. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be so awkward with me.\u201dWei Jing smiled without replying to that. She had no intention to play along with Xue Lan\u2019s fake friendship games.\u201cSpeaking of which, the house you bought was also the property of our Xing & Chen Merchantry.\u201d Xue Lan suddenly said, the hint in her tone blatantly obvious: So what if you didn\u2019t accept my offering? You still ended up staying in the house that we sold you!Considering the size and power of the Xing & Chen Merchantry, it was normal that she learned of their movements.\u201cYou know where we are living?\u201d Li Tianming frowned at Xue Lan, having thought of something.\u201cWhat are you suggesting?\u201d Chen Yao was more straightforward than his mother, and asked Li Tianming, staring at him directly.\u201cNo, just a random question.\u201d Li Tianming replied. Was it possible that this woman here was so wicked that when she realised Sage Chen\u2019s kindness towards them, she hired assassins to murder the two of them? It was definitely possible.\u201cMother, it\u2019s time we go. We need to greet the seniors from Xing Mansion and the Occult Athenaeum, and there are important guests from the Vermilion Bird Clan as well,\u201d Chen Yao said coldly. \u201cLet\u2019s not waste any more time on unimportant personnels.\u201d\u201cYao\u2019er, how could you say such a thing? Your Aunt Jing was a sister of mine, don\u2019t treat her so rudely.\u201d Xue Lan snorted, tapping her son\u2019s shoulders lightly.\u201cSisters? She looks more like that servant\u2019s sister.\u201d Chen Yao shrugged, and turned to leave.\u201cJing\u2019er, forgive me, this boy was born with a silver spoon and it was hard to teach him manners. I envy you sometimes, having a son that is so obedient.\u201d Xue Lan smiled, but once again, Wei Jing did not respond.\u201cAunt Lan, a quick question please?\u201d Li Tianming suddenly interrupted her.\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cHave you heard of the Bloodflower Chamber?\u201d Li Tianming asked.\u201cWhat? No.\u201d Xue Lan shook her head. The Bloodflower chamber was a taboo topic, and it was normal for people to not talk about it. Then again, with her position, he wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she was in touch with the chamber.\u201cOh, then that\u2019s all we have. Aunt Lan, please take your leave,\u201d Li Tianming said, his tone clearly suggesting that they were not going to entertain her any further.\u201cDon\u2019t bother us kid, I still have things to say to your mother.\u201d Xue Lan was slightly annoyed.\u201cAunt Lan, does Chen Yao want to get the first place for this ranking test and enter Heaven\u2019s Sanctum?\u201d Li Tianming stared at her.\u201cOf course, what about it?\u201d Xue Lan could sense his aggressiveness.\u201cHa, Aunt Lan, you can stop acting so pretentious, it will only make us look down on you even further. Everyone has their own fortunes and mishaps, and you don\u2019t have to rub your fortune into our face. That will only show that you are still bothered by your defeats in the past, am I right?\u201d Li Tianming continued to stare at her directly, his words firm and powerful.\u201cWhat\u2019s with you, kid? Do you have any manners?!\u201d Xue Lan\u2019s face turned pale, her fingers trembling slightly from Li Tianming\u2019s accusations.\u201cEven if I have no manners, I\u2019m still better than that son of yours. You may think that you are superior to my mother in all aspects, and can\u2019t wait to gloat about it. In that case, I must say you will be disappointed very soon.\u201d Li Tianming was not going to give her any face. Wei Jing pulled his sleeves to signal him to stop, but Li Tianming had enough of this pompous madam.\u201cYou are but a brute who tried to drug others. Who gave you the courage to talk to me like this!\u201d Realising that the pair was not going to play along with her game anymore, Xue Lan was also not about to give any chance. In terms of squabbling, she was just as confident.\u201cYou will find out about that soon, when your son is trampled underfoot by others,\u201d Li Tianming said.Xue Lan smirked, and turned to Wei Jing, \u201cJing\u2019er, speak. Do you want to compare your son with mine?\u201d\u201cPlease leave, don\u2019t insult the Xue Lan in my memories.\u201d Wei Jing grimaced.\u201cInsult? Look at your pathetic self! You are insulting no one but yourself, Wei Jing!\u201d With that, Xue Lan sneered at Li Tianming, before turning around to walk away.She was still gloating over the conversation while walking off, even laughing when she thought of Li Tianming\u2019s words. Onlookers could only guess what had happened to make that Madam Xue Lan this happy.In the end, after twenty years, who had won? Xue Lan looked at her fair skin, the dress she was wearing and the jewelries that she donned. She thought of the Xing & Chen Merchantry behind her back, and the envious looks that everyone threw at her whenever she walked past them. And finally, she thought of those two sons that she had. The victor was clear.As for Wei Jing, she was just breathing her last breath in a little corner, having lost in terms of everything. Even if Wei Jing never wished to compare with her, she wanted to! For the first twenty years of her life, she always lived in Wei Jing\u2019s shadow, surpassed by her in every aspect. No one knew how defeated she felt back then.Even if she had completely fallen out with Wei Jing today, she couldn\u2019t feel any better. She had said many things that she had been thinking of for a long time, and venting those out had given her a spring in her steps. And to think that Li Tianming, that disgusting brute scorned by everyone, dared to challenge her precious boy? She couldn\u2019t wait to share the joke with her sisters.\u201cWhat are sisters? I don\u2019t need sisters who can\u2019t bootlick me and appreciate my greatness.\u201d Xue Lan looked at her perfect figure and her fair skin, and then thought of that sickly Wei Jing. She couldn\u2019t help but burst into laughter again.\u201cOh, Lifesbane. What a beautiful, beautiful thing!\u201d She smirked yet again as she entered her private room, where she shared with her sisters the stories of Li Tianming, causing the group of ladies to giggle like little girls.As for the center of their topic, Li Tianming, he had yet to leave Wei Jing\u2019s side.\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d he asked.\u201cNothing much, she just revealed her true nature.\u201d Wei Jing was calm as ever. While Li Tianming may have been suffering for the past three years, she had to deal with this for half of her life! What happened today wasn\u2019t going to affect her.\u201cNothing else?\u201d\u201cCan you defeat Chen Yao?\u201d\u201cEasy as pie,\u201d Li Tianming said.\u201cThen you better give him a good beating,\u201d Wei Jing said.Li Tianming grinned. This was more like his mother. She was never a cowardly person, but fate had been cruel to her. If she had the chance to make those who had disappointed her pay for what they had done, she would not let that chance go.\u201cCan you do that, Tianming?\u201d Wei Jing asked again.\u201cSit back and enjoy the show, mother,\u201d Li Tianming replied.Wei Jing grinned. \u201cToo bad they don\u2019t have snacks and drinks here.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be too picky.\u201dAt that moment, an announcement that the ranking test was about to commence, and that the important figures of the institute were making their appearances echoed throughout the stadium.\u201cI gotta go. If not, Chief Mentor Mu Wan will scold me,\" Li Tianming said.\u201cMu Wan?\u201d Wei Jing was stunned for a moment.\u201cYou know her?\u201d Li Tianming asked.\u201cNo, just go now.\u201d Wei Jing smiled again, her hands resting on her knees.In fact, when she smiled, she didn\u2019t look that old anymore. Li Tianming could still see the shadow of that beauty from twenty years ago.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He was amongst the most exalted personages of the royal clan.Wei Zikun leading with his introduction was a testament to that.A gentle voice drifted out from among the most luxurious of the private rooms. \u201cYou may dispense with the greeting. The main characters of today are the youngsters. Don\u2019t feel uncomfortable, I\u2019m just here to spectate.\u201dThe rumour that King Xuan had a good temper seemed to be true.Wei Zikun continued his introductions.The second VIP was from the Occult Athenaeum. Technically, the Occult Athenaeum wasn\u2019t an actual power but rather an auxiliary faction of the royal clan.Many of Vermilion Bird\u2019s officials were all nurtured by the Athenaeum, which had a dual focus on cultural and martial education. Unlike Flameyellow Scions Institute, they raised geniuses of officialdom.The current prime minister of Vermilion Bird was the head of the Athenaeum.According to the introduction, the Occult Athenaeum\u2019s representative was the prime minister\u2019s daughter, the Occult Athenaeum\u2019s Pavilion Mistress of their Book Pavilion, Qin Xuanyu.The third VIP was from the Lightning Manor. He was the current Lightning Seigneur\u2019s son and the next generation Lightning Seigneur, Lin Tianjian.Lin Tianjian had already inherited his father\u2019s position as marshal for the Tempest Regiment. He had become Vermilion Bird\u2019s commander-in-chief of the army and was one of the top experts of the nation. In terms of reputation, he was even beyond Qin Xuanyu.However, Vermilion Bird had always had the custom of ranking the Occult Athenaeum that waited upon the royal clan ahead of the Lightning Manor.For many years, both the Occult Athenaeum and the Lightning Manor had worked hand in hand to safeguard the nation\u2019s longevity. The former specialised in the nation\u2019s administration, the latter the nation\u2019s defence.Lin Tianjian was of the same generation as the Starry Twins and the chosen of the Lightning Manor\u2019s previous generation. Rumour had it that in the competition within that generation, he hadn\u2019t been any inferior to the Starry Twins.Furthermore, Li Tianming knew he had another identity. He was also Lin Xiaoting and Lin Xiaoxiao\u2019s father! Hence, Li Tianming wondered if Lin Xiaoting and Mu Qingqing were sitting by his side when he heard that name announced.If so, would they be trying to pick him out from among the crowd?When his gaze landed on that private room, Wei Zikun continued introducing the other VIPs.From Xing & Chen Merchantry, there was Sage Chen\u2019s wife Xue Lan and Sage Xing\u2019s wife Madam Yuan Yum, Fateshaven\u2019s governor Zhang Yunji, the Punishment Bureau\u2019s vice-head Zhao Danhong and so on\u2026 Over twenty influential figures in the nation were introduced.These powerhouses of that age stood at the apex of strength. Together, they held the lifeline of the country.\u201cIt\u2019s about time. Now, let us uncover a new Flameyellow Leaderboard!\u201dA massive stele stood beside the Flameyellow Stadium. It was thick and ancient, having experienced the vicissitudes of the ages. It was the spiritual symbol of the institute, the Flameyellow Leaderboard.The rankings of the apprentice class decided from the ranking battles would be displayed on this leaderboard.From then onwards, anyone who entered the institute would first notice this leaderboard. The glory being ranked at the top, receiving the adoration of the masses\u2026 such was the appeal of the title of prime disciple.Four years ago, Lin Xiaoting of Lightning Manor had fought off the outstanding heroes of his age to occupy the top spot, shocking the nation. Before him, the prime disciple had always been geniuses from the royal clan for dozens of years.That year, Li Tianming had personally witnessed Lin Xiaoting\u2019s glory. He himself had been ranked towards the bottom. However, his vision then had been limited, so he had been giving himself a pat on the back for a job well done.His background was worlds apart from Lin Xiaoting after all.Today, the Flameyellow Leaderboard had already been wiped clean. The following ranking battles would see name after name climb onto it. New legends would be born this day.The glory of being the prime disciple would be thirsted for by any faction. Otherwise, people like King Xuan, Lin Xiaojian and Qin Xuanyu would never have come personally.The leaderboard\u2019s reveal was enough to show the ranking battles had begun. All eyes were now focused on it, the blank stele prompting one\u2019s imagination to run wild.Thousands of fireflies encircled the stele, each with a golden flame lit on their rear. Li Tianming had witnessed them using that exact golden flame to engrave the names of disciples in gold on the leaderboard.The fireflies were all spawned from a broodmother-type lifebound beast, a Heavenly Firefly, which supposedly belonged to a chief mentor from the Hall of Uniquities.The burning golden words were undeniably very stylish!\u201cI declare that the ranking battles hereby commence!\u201dThe following battles would be arranged by the chief mentors. For example, Mu Wan would be in charge of her fifty students.\u201cLi Tianming, why are you late?\u201d When Li Tianming returned to the Muwan class, Mu Wan glared at him.\u201cChief mentor, important people always have to be fashionably late, right?\u201d Li Tianming chuckled.Mu Wan was dressed particularly formally today, that noble but aloof get-up was a beautiful sight in the stadium.\u201cConfident, aren\u2019t you? I look forward to you getting beaten up later.\u201d Mu Wan said, displeased after trying to find him for so long to no avail.\u201cHow could that be possible? I\u2019m here to fight for my chief mentor and the Hall of Phoenix\u2019s glory!\u201dThe rest of the disciples of Muwan class shook their heads. In their eyes, Li Tianming not only lacked morality, but was also glib-tongued and cocky. They didn\u2019t understand why Chief Mentor Mu Wan was putting so much effort into nurturing him.\u201cBe more obedient, and I\u2019ll choose a good opponent for you when I make the arrangements with the other chief mentors. Just wait.\u201d Mu Wan rolled her eyes at him before hurrying off.The rules behind the ranking battles were complicated, and could be boiled down to a rating system. All admitted students would be comprehensively evaluated by their chief mentors with a thousand points as the perfect score.All ten chief mentors would judge and estimate a disciple\u2019s abilities and give a rating. After the best and worst was removed, the average would be taken as the preliminary rating.The Flameyellow Leaderboard would be initially arranged using these preliminary ratings. Of course, the preliminary rating wasn\u2019t the final rating.Disciples would then participate in battles to raise their chief mentor\u2019s evaluation of them and be reassigned a rating. However, if the conclusion drawn by over half of the chief mentors was that their strength was quite similar to their given rating, that would become their final rating.The chief mentors were all old hands. Once they saw a fight, they could basically tell the potential of that disciple. Many preliminary ratings did end up being accurate.However, Li Tianming didn\u2019t care so much. His main takeaway was that he just needed to keep beating up people until he reached the top.There were many participating disciples and the chief mentors had done a lot of behind the scenes preparations for the students to fight for their preliminary rating. The process was long, but fair.Li Tianming listened to Mu Wan\u2019s arrangements and slowly waited for a suitable opponent to be chosen.\u201cI just need to show my very best in the first round. I\u2019ll give myself a top ten preliminary ranking so I don\u2019t need to slowly fight my way up from the bottom,\u201d Li Tianming mused.The aggression from yesterday still lingering in his heart \u2014 perhaps, the person who had ordered the hit was in this very stadium. Hence, his rage was boiling now.When the fighting started, he would rampage!Over ten battles started simultaneously. Golden words quickly appeared, which the chief mentors worked together to give a rating.For example, the current number one - Chen Yao, 870 points!To be given such a high preliminary rating in this system was very rare, and that glittering name immediately drew the crowd's attention.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 55": "Chapter 55 - Tianming Returns With A Slap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cChen Yao's performance was outstanding today, his preliminary rating is even 20 points higher than Xing Que and Chen Hao\u2019s,\u201d from inside one of the Stadium\u2019s private rooms, a lady dressed in a luxurious purple dress exclaimed. She was none other than the mistress of the Xing Mansion, Madam Xue Lan\u2019s closest sister, and Sage Xing\u2019s wife, Madam Yuan Yu.The two of them were the women behind the Starry Twins\u2019 back. When they were young, they were amongst the top beauties in the entire Ignispolis, and even at their age now they were still as charming as ever. Their complexions were as tender and fair as twenty year old girls, thanks to the amount of care and effort they had put in.\u201cThe chief mentors must have a good idea of Yao\u2019er\u2019s strength, which is why they put him at the top of the leaderboard,\u201d Xue Lan said proudly. \u201cBut this is not the final score. He worked really hard for the past few weeks and has improved tremendously.\u201d\u201cYao\u2019er is such a good son. Even if he grew up pampered and free of worries, he still put so much effort into cultivation. How I envy having a son like him,\u201d Madam Yuan Yu exclaimed.\u201cSis Yu, please don\u2019t say that. Even if you only have one son, we all know how well he is performing at Heaven's Sanctum now.\u201d Xue Lan smiled. \u201cYou are Yao\u2019er\u2019s godmother. These three sons are our sons.\u201d\u201cOh Sis Lan you sure know how to make me happy, it's no wonder that Brother Chen fell for you.\u201d\u201cAnd you too, charming Brother Xing throughout the years.\u201d\u201cCut it out, you two. You're giving me goosebumps.\u201d Just as the two were joking around, a voice sounded from outside the room. They turned around to find two handsome youths walking into the private room.The two of them each had their own characteristics, one of them slender and charming while the other bulky and intimidating. The slender one resembled Chen Yao, suggesting that he was Chen Yao\u2019s elder brother, Chen Hao. The other one of them was Sage Xing\u2019s son, Xing Que. It was Xing Que who interrupted their conversation earlier.\u201cBro, be more polite to our mothers.\u201d Chen Hao smiled.\u201cThey're gonna turn into little girls already if we get anymore polite.\u201d Xing Que shook his head and grinned.\u201cHow rude of you, you should look at how caring Hao\u2019er is. I told you to come and support your youngest brother, but you\u2019re too late. He\u2019s already made it to the top of the Flameyellow Leaderboard.\u201d Madam Yuan Yu rolled her eyes.\u201cGetting first place now is pointless. I heard the stories going around, and it\u2019s probably quite difficult for Yao\u2019er to become prime disciple, considering that he\u2019s competing with the likes of Lin Xiaoxiao and Li Shufan. That Li Shufan is the prime minister\u2019s direct disciple, and he was said to be the minister\u2019s best disciple too. As for Lin Xiaoxiao, need we say anymore? She\u2019s quite close to that monstrous prime disciple four years ago.\u201d\u201cAre those two that strong?\u201d Xue Lan frowned, clearly feeling the pressure now.\u201cOf course. Had mother been more strict to Yao\u2019er and pampered him less, he would have a much better chance. As for now, he has a 20% chance, at most.\u201dMadam Yuan Yu shook her head. \u201cEven so, he still has a chance. I told you all to come and support your youngest sibling, what kind of brothers are you two to say such discouraging things.\u201d\u201cOf course we would support our youngest brother,\u201d Xing Que said.\u201cIt\u2019s just that he can\u2019t obtain the title of the prime disciple this time round. Even so, with his own discipline and our family background, within three months we can get him to join us in the Sanctum,\u201d Chen Hao further explained.\u201cYao\u2019er really is talented, and can at least rank among the top three in his generation. If only he had put more effort into cultivation, his odds would increase to 40% today.\u201d Said Xing Que.Xue Lan let out a sigh of relief. \u201cWell, that\u2019s good enough! Once he enters Heaven's Sanctum he can rely on the two of you, and no one would ever dare to touch him.\u201d\u201cWhat are you saying mum? Who would ever dare to seek trouble with the Xing and Chen Clans? If anyone dares to so as much as touch Chen Yao\u2019s hair, I\u2019d personally send him to hell.\u201d Chen Hao smirked.\u201cDon\u2019t forget about me.\u201d Xing Que clenched his fist and grinned too.Xue Lan smiled too, happy with how bonded the brothers were and also with their capabilities. They were truly the future of this nation! She then thought of that dying woman, and the taunt that her disgraced son had challenged Chen Yao with. That made Xue Lan crack up instantly.\u201cGodmother, what\u2019s so funny? Anything good happened lately?\u201d Xing Que asked.\u201cHa, it\u2019s just that some people have no idea where they belong.\u201d\u201cWho are you talking about?\u201d\u201cYou will find out soon.\u201d Xue Lan was acting all mysterious.\u2026\u2026\u201cLi Tianming, it\u2019s your turn, make a move.\u201d After a long period of waiting, Chief Mentor Mu Wan had finally turned her attention to him, as she hurried him onto the arena.Mu Wan was having a busy day, and she was already sweating from the burning sun. But that just made the beauty more attractive than ever.\u201cWho am I facing, and what level?\u201d Li Tianming asked. He wanted a stronger opponent, so that he could get a higher preliminary score and not waste his time.\u201cNinth level of Beast Vein.\u201d Mu Wan replied.\u201cOh c\u2019mon, you must be looking down on me.\u201d Li Tianming grumbled.\u201cWhat can I do, you are registered as ninth level of \u2026 Wait, you reached Spiritsource?\u201d Mu Wan realised that there was something inherently different about Li Tianming, something that didn't belong to a Beast Vein beastmaster.\u201cYeap.\u201d\u201cThen all the more you should calm down and take your time. Don\u2019t worry, I will keep assigning you opponents until you lose,\u201d Mu Wan explained with a serious tone.That was enough to soothe Li Tianming. Some chief mentors might give Li Tianming a biased score based on first impressions, and even if Li Tianming had won, if he wasn\u2019t allocated any more matches, he wouldn\u2019t be able to raise his score.Li Tianming took to the arenas. Since there were over ten battles happening at the same time, not many had noticed him yet. In a while, his opponent was guided up the arena by another chief mentor.Li Tianming took a closer look, and he was surprised that he recognised that fellow. His opponent was none other than the \u2018genius\u2019 of Lightning Manor, Liu Qianyang of ninth level of Beast Vein.\u201cWhat a coincidence. Life sure is funny sometimes, no?\u201d Li Tianming grinned broadly.Liu Qianyang\u2019s expression was exactly opposite of Li Tianming\u2019s. He had personally witnessed Li Tianming defeating Chen Ding. Furthermoe, his nose bone had yet to totally recover from Li Tianming\u2019s punch. Therefore, he shuddered when he realised that he was matched up against Li Tianming once again.\u201cChief mentor, I refuse to battle this person!\u201d Li Tianming never expected Liu Qianyang to yell at the judging chief mentors the moment Liu Qianyang saw his face.\u201cReason being?\u201d\u201cThis person is named Li Tianming, and he was expelled from the institute three years ago for immoral acts! He does not have the right to return to the institute, neither does he have the right to battle me!\u201d Liu Qianyang\u2019s eyes were wide open, and his tone hysterical. It was clear that he really didn\u2019t want to battle Li Tianming.\u201cBullshit. Li Tianming was not expelled from the institute three years ago, and we have judged that he has the right to re-enter the institute,\u201d said Chief Mentor Mu Wan, who was just a distance away, \u201cLiu Qianyang, you do not have a right to refuse the battle, or you will be automatically eliminated from the ranking test.\u201dShe had made her stance very clear.\u201cI disagree! Why can an animal who drugged other people before become a member of the institute?! The Flameyellow Scions Institute is a sacred place, and should not tolerate filth like him! I refuse to battle him!\u201d Liu Qianyang roared, his face flushing bright red.The only reason why he was not chased out of the stadium yet was because he was a member of the Lightning Manor. Instead, many had caught on to what he had said, and they were beginning to notice Li Tianming\u2019s existence. That name reminded many of the joke that had happened three years ago. While Li Tianming was just another average joe, the other member involved in the story was Lin Xiaoting, the prime disciple four years ago and the top disciple in Heaven\u2019s Sanctum now.\u201cSo that's Li Tianming?\u201dLi Tianming\u2019s name had started an array of discussions. \u201cThat Lightning Manor disciple is right. We can\u2019t let such an indecent human be a member of the Flameyellow Scions Institute, it's a sacred place after all.\u201dEven Li Tianming himself did not expect the attention he was receiving right now, since his first battle had not even started. The crowd today was easily ten times that of the admission test\u2019s, and there were simply too many pairs of eyes on him right now.\u201cWhat a filthy scum, he belongs in the drains with the rats. He\u2019s achieving nothing here but shaming himself.\u201d\u201cThankfully Lin Xiaoting arrived in time to save the goddess of Heaven's Sanctum, or he would have laid his filthy hands on her.\u201d\u201cI know, those two make such a good couple.\u201d\u201cI wonder if they are here looking at this brute too?\u201dDiscussion of this kind was going on in all corners of the stadium.Liu Qianyang did not expect his little trick to be so effective. Just as he wanted to add fuel to the fire, he heard someone calling him.\u201cQianyang!\u201d The boy turned back to see his sister, Liu Qing.Her face was stone-cold, as she announced, \u201cBattle like a real man, and stop shaming the Lightning Manor. Children of the Lightning Manor will never escape from a battle.\u201d\u201cBut sis\u2026 \u201d\u201cQuiet, the seniors are watching.\u201d Liu Qing\u2019s voice was as cold as ice.How could Liu Qianyang not get the hint! Liu Qing was in the room allocated to Lightning Manor, and if she stepped out now it means she was carrying the orders from the top personnel from Lightning Manor. To piss off the seniors of the manor was even more frightening for Liu Qianyang.Before the chief mentors could come to a decision on what to do, Liu Qianyang had summoned his Lightning Bolt Cheetah and shouted at Li Tianming, \u201cI changed my mind! It is my role as a member of the Lightning Manor to punish people like you!\u201dHis words had raised cheers from the crowd. Real heroes would punish evildoers, and only cowards escaped from battles. In fact, many in the stadium were applauding Liu Qianyang\u2019s actions right now.\u201cLovely. I owe you my thanks, Liu Qianyang,\u201d Li Tianming said.\u201cThank me? For what? For letting the world know that the joke is back in town?\u201d Liu Qianyang sneered.\u201cPretty much, your announcement had put me into the spotlight.\u201d Li Tianming smiled.\u201cAnd?\u201d\u201cAnd you are useless to me now.\u201d Having said that, Li Tianming walked towards Liu Qianyang without even summoning his little chick.\u201cHow dare you look down on me! Children of the Lightning Manor will never go down without a fight!\u201d Liu Qianyang roared, as he charged towards Li Tianming along with his Lightning Bolt Cheetah. He wanted to make use of Li Tianming\u2019s ego and attack before the little chick was even summoned.BAM!A fiery mirage flashed past, followed by a crisp sound of a slap. An instant later, the audience saw Liu Qianyang spiral into the air, spinning a dozen rounds, before he finally landed with a thud in front of Liu Qing. His body convulsed violently, and strength fled from his body entirely.Bam!Another slap followed. This time, the cheetah was sent spinning too, till it eventually landed beside its master, unable to get up either.The battle lasted for less than a fraction of a second. Showered by the confused looks from the spectators, Li Tianming rubbed his hands together. Everyone was still in doubt of the result, and shocked by the swiftness of the battle. Had Li Yanfeng been here, he would have seen how Li Tianming dominated Liu Qianyang yet again. This time, it was with a single slap!As for what happened three years ago, many had been fooled. Therefore, before he could exonerate himself completely, Li Tianming did not want to make any explanations.In fact, he just wanted to tell Mu Wan: Bring me the next one! If he was lucky, he would be able to challenge the current first place of the leaderboard, Chen Yao, within an hour!And then, trash the shit out of him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 56": "Chapter 56 - Chen Yao, Come Get Some!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cLi Tianming, 480 points, rank 575.\u201d The preliminary rating was quickly released, and Li Tianming wasn\u2019t sure whether to laugh and cry when he saw the Flameyellow Leaderboard. He hadn\u2019t had much chance to show off against Liu Qianyang when he finished it with just one slap.The chief mentors couldn\u2019t give him too high a rating when they didn\u2019t really know his limits.\u201cWhatever. I\u2019ll arrange someone stronger for you now. You\u2019re so famous that it\u2019s easy to find people who want to beat you up,\u201d Mu Wan said.Liu Qianyang had made Li Tianming the focus of the audience, even if it was a negative example of what not to be. On the bright side, now there was a long line of people queuing up to be his opponent.\u201cNo problem. I\u2019ll go for broke to help my chief mentor earn glory.\u201d\u201cGive a good performance. A lot of people are looking down on you now.\u201dBelow the other side of the stage, a face-swollen Liu Qianyang was asking, \u201cWhy, sis?\u201dHis face was still smarting.\u201cThe Tempest Marshal said not to make things difficult for Li Tianming,\u201d Liu Qing said in a low voice.The Tempest Marshal was Lin Tianjian.Liu Qianyang was confused. \u201cWhy would the Tempest Marshal take note of such a small figure?\u201d\u201cMu Qingqing was next to him. The Tempest Marshal is aware of that incident between them three years ago, so he asked her how she wanted Li Tianming dealt with. Guess what she said?\u201d Liu Qing\u2019s expression was cold. There was no way she felt happy seeing her brother go up to get pummeled.\u201cWhat did she say?\u201d\u201cMu Qingqing said she\u2019s already forgiven him for what happened and said he had received sufficient punishment three years ago. They were also once friends, so she didn\u2019t want to hound him any further. In fact, she\u2019s happy he\u2019s turned over a new leaf and doesn\u2019t want Lightning Manor to make things difficult for him,\u201d Liu Qing replied.\u201cHow is that possible? He wanted to violate her three years ago!\u201d Liu Qianyang was even more confused now.\u201cWell, Li Tianming did lose his lifebound beast and suffer ridicule for three years. He has paid a heavy price. It really is a form of magnanimity for Mu Qingqing to forgive him on account of old friendships.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s too overly kind! Still, big brother Ting won\u2019t forgive Li Tianming so easily. Is he around?\u201d Liu Qianyang asked anxiously.\u201cHe\u2019s in seclusion.\u201d\u201cExactly! Big sis Qingqing may have forgiven him, but big brother Ting will definitely teach that guy a lesson once he comes out! We can\u2019t let him make a comeback.\u201dLiu Qing wasn\u2019t very pleased.\u201c You\u2019re wrong. He\u2019ll probably listen to her. Anyway, how could a random Li Tianming make a comeback? He\u2019ll always be an ant before Lightning Manor. No one cares about him. Still, this decision is troublesome for your brother-in-law.\u201d\u201cHow so?\u201d\u201cSo long as Li Tianming is alive, the possibility of a rift forming between Lightning Manor and your brother-in-law exists.\u201d\u201cHasn\u2019t brother-in-law already received an important position from the Manor and obtained a heavenly will technique?\u201d Liu Qianyang asked.\u201cA possibility is still a possibility.\u201d\u201cWhy don't we find Bloodflower Chamber and hire a hit on him?\u201d Liu Qianyang said maliciously.\u201cNot yet. Let your brother-in-law make his decision first.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019ll kill his own son?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll see. I do get the feeling he no longer has any emotional attachment to Li Tianming already.\u201d\u2026\u2026As the brother-sister pair spoke in a corner, a group of people were sitting in one of the private rooms. At a glance, they were obviously of Lightning Manor. All of them were surrounded by an aura of lightning, and were threatening without being angry.In the highest position, sat a middle-aged man dressed in purple robes. His black hair cascaded down like a waterfall while his eyes seemed to contain pools of lightning. Most striking were his pair of lighting-shaped eyebrows, which spiked up at the ends.It gave him a fierce look that would frighten any kid who looked at him.He was the number one marshal of Vermilion Bird, son of the Lightning Seigneur and current Tempest Marshal, Lin Tianjian.He was also Lin Xiaoting and Lin Xiaoxiao\u2019s father.A delicate-looking girl, with pure and charming features sat besides him. She was the most popular disciple for this ranking battle, Lin Xiaoxiao.Besides her sat a gentle-looking young lady in a white dress with blue borders. She gave off the impression of a white lotus, peaceful and natural. A smile from her seemed as cleansing as the spring wind.\u201cBig sis Qingqing, I feel that this Li Tianming\u2019s strength isn\u2019t bad. Supposedly, he had a six-star lifebound beast,\u201d Lin Xiaoxiao whispered in her ear.\u201cIt seems so. He was in Spiritsource three years ago. Now that he has a six-star beast, he\u2019s stronger than before. It\u2019s normal, he is five years older than you.\u201d Mu Qingqing smiled warmly.\u201cFive years is nothing. If he runs into me, I\u2019ll definitely help you teach the hooligan a lesson.\u201d Lin Xiaoxiao fumed when she thought of that matter three years ago.\u201cXiaoxiao, it wasn\u2019t easy for him to turn over a new leaf. Don\u2019t bully him.\u201d\u201cWill big sis Qingqing treat him as a friend if you see him again?\u201d Lin Xiaoxiao asked.\u201cOf course not. It\u2019s no longer appropriate for us to meet, nor is there a need to.\u201d\u201cI understand. Big sis Qingqing really is magnanimous! If it was me, I wouldn\u2019t have forgiven such a person my whole life!\u201d When she said this, she stood up. \u201cAlright, I should get going for my matches.\u201d\u201cXiaoxiao, try and become the prime disciple, like your older brother. I\u2019ve already prepared a room for you in Heaven\u2019s Sanctum. You can live with me once you join,\u201d Mu Qingqing said gently.\u201cI\u2019ve seen Chen Yao and Li Shufan\u2019s abilities. I feel it\u2019s no big deal as long as they have no trump cards,\u201d Lin Xiaoxiao said confidently.\u201cDon\u2019t be too overconfident. Now, go!\u201d Lin Tianjian said sternly when he heard their conversation.\u201cFine!\u201d Lin Xiaoxiao stuck out her tongue before happily going down. While people often said she was very mature and sensible, she would still act like a child around her family.Mu Qingqing was still smiling as she sent her off. But no one noticed how the armrest on her chair had been crushed at some point in time.\u2026\u2026The atmosphere exploded when Lin Xiaoxiao took to the field. She managed to garner the highest evaluation from the chief mentor through two battles. Chen Yao, who had towered above everyone else before now, was finally dragged down to second place by the 950 points Lin Xiaoxiao.Unfortunately, he didn\u2019t keep number two for long either.Occult Athenaeum\u2019s Li Shufan took to the field next and was given 920 points, which was also above Chen Yao.Chen Yao still had opportunities to fight. After another two fights, he made an excellent showing in defeating some third level Spiritsource opponents. Alas, it was only enough to bring him to 900 points.It meant that there was no point fighting anyone else if he wanted to be the prime disciple. Only Lin Xiaoxiao was left for him to beat. By the same logic, it was the same for Li Shufan who had reached the peak otherwise.According to past precedents, one had to accept many challengers to be determined as the strongest disciple by the chief mentors. When there was sufficient proof that the top ranker was unshakable, then and only then would he or she be conferred as prime disciple.While the 950 points given to Lin Xiaoxiao was the greatest affirmation towards her, it also gave the greatest challenge.Still, only those in the top ten could challenge her, with priority given to the higher ranks.The one with the highest priority was the second place Li Shufan. However, Lin Xiaoxiao was still safe, as he was biding his time for now.The ranking battles had only just hit its middle portion and the bottom and middle rankings were constantly changing. Only when those rankings had stabilised would the most spectacular part come!Li Shufan, Chen Yao and the rest were\u2019t anxious yet.During this time, Li Tianming had gone through another two battles. He had already gone against a second level Spiritsource opponent. Without exception, all were defeated by a single slap without him summoning his lifebound beast.He was currently ninety-fifth place with 790 points.However, he obviously hadn\u2019t shown his true strength yet. Hence, he had much more possibility for upward mobility than the others around his rank.Mu Wan was getting more excited after seeing his last two battles and hurriedly arranged even stronger opponents.However, Li Tianming couldn\u2019t wait any longer! It was going to take forever at this rate to fight his way to the top ten. Hence, he decided to give it a try himself.\u201cChief mentor, I want to try to directly challenge the third place, Chen Yao!\u201d It was time to let Xue Lan know whether her precious son was a stunning talent or a trash who had grown up with a silver spoon in his mouth.\u201cImpossible. The top ten are just waiting to challenge Lin Xiaoxiao. They have the right to reject your challenge unless you\u2019re in the top twenty.\u201d\u201cBut hypothetically, what if he accepts?\u201d\u201cThen you\u2019ll be good to go.\u201dLi Tianming grinned. He was full of nothing but methods to get Chen Yao to come get some.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Please help me deliver my letter of challenge to Xing & Chen Merchantry. Help me ask Madam Xue Lan if her son dares to come and get a beating!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s against the rules, but I\u2019ll help you this time. But well, from my perspective, you\u2019re likely to be the one beaten up. He is a real genius, after all,\u201d Mu Wan warned.Li Tianming smiled, his eyes ablaze with passion. He didn\u2019t need to brag or anything. Beating him up was a done deal if Chen Yao dared to come down.Therefore, Mu Wan delivered the letter of challenge to Xing & Chen Merchantry\u2019s private room.At the same time, Li Tianming took the initiative to leap onto a stage and look at where the letter of challenge had been sent. \u201cChen Yao! Do you dare come down here for a beatdown?\u201dThe voice suddenly boomed out within the Flameyellow Stadium, immediately drawing the attention of everyone!Liu Qianyang had successfully helped everyone recognise Li Tianming. So, everyone expected him to be more low profile. On the contrary, he instead even acted more bombastic!With his rank and power, challenge Chen Yao?It was delusional and courting death, garnering ridicule from all sides.\u201cThis fellow, he came to create more joke material!\u201d Many immediately laughed at Li Tianming\u2019s challenge.Now, was the time for second place and onward to contest first place!Chen Yao was waiting for his turn after Li Shufan lost. The first rank had to continuously accept challenges until the chief mentors unanimously decided he or she was the prime disciple.\u201cThe mad dog is barking again. Tell him I\u2019m busy!\u201d Chen Yao was currently resting next to his two older brothers.\u201cHe really is blind. What does he have against you?\u201d Xing Que asked coldly.Chen Yao didn\u2019t say anything, turning to look at his mother, Xue Lan instead. From when Li Tianming started fighting, her expression had been unpleasant throughout. Moreover, Chen Yao was currently ranked third and not first, which added to her displeasure.\u201cChen Yao. Go down and teach him a lesson. If the chance presents itself, cripple him!\u201d Xue Lan suddenly said.\u201cSis, there\u2019s no need right? I just saw him beat a second level Spiritsource. Yao\u2019er is currently preparing for Lin Xiaoxiao. It\u2019ll affect him if he exhausts his strength with this person,\u201d Madam Yuan Yu advised.\u201cI think there\u2019s no need to. Teaching this sort of dog a lesson can be done anytime, anywhere. It doesn\u2019t need to be now,\u201d Xue Lan\u2019s eldest son, Chen Hao, added.\u201cYao\u2019er, are you going or not? You can\u2019t lack the courage to handle such trash if you\u2019re gunning for first place!\u201dEveryone realised Xue Lan was getting more and more irascible today.\u201cHow could I reject if mother has already said this much? Honestly, if I didn\u2019t want to conserve strength for Lin Xiaoxiao, I would have gone straight down and shut his mouth when he challenged me.\u201d Chen Yao stood up. He knew why his mother was so agitated. Before the ranking battles, his mother and Wei Jing had met, shedding all pretense of cordiality in the process. Furthermore, they had made fun of that mother-son pair so much. If he didn\u2019t go forth and it spread, where would Madam Xue Lan\u2019s face go?\u201cHe hasn\u2019t used his lifebound beast to win so far. Are you confident?\u201d Xue Lan asked.\u201cHaha, one move is enough! It wouldn\u2019t affect later on. Mother, just watch! I\u2019m going to plunge that mother and son into despair. It\u2019s just some dog that just won\u2019t go away, if I don\u2019t break its legs, I\u2019m not surnamed Chen!\u201d Chen Yao sneered.\u201cIt\u2019s enough to beat him. Conserve your strength, little brother. After the ranking battles, I\u2019ll just get someone to exterminate his lifebound beast and there, matter resolved!\u201d Xing Que patted him on the shoulder.\u201cWe recently made some fugitive friends who can do anything and everything.\u201d Chen Hao chuckled too.\u201cThat\u2019s good. I won\u2019t have to see such dirty things anymore then.\u201d Chen Yao walked out.\u201cWei Jing, what are you trying to prove before you die? That your son is stronger than mine? Well, I guess you\u2019re not going to be able to peacefully go then.\u201d Xue Lan looked in Wei Jing\u2019s direction, muttering internally. She may not have been able to see her, but she knew where she was.As for Wei Jing\u2019s desire to compare children, she smiled coldly, derision in her heart.\u2026\u2026An incident happened as Li Tianming was confidently thinking Chen Yao would come down. Li Shufan of Occult Athenaeum coincidentally sent his letter of challenge to Lightning Manor.Lin Xiaoxiao had also been waiting for this to defend her prime disciple spot. When she came out from the Lightning Manor\u2019s area, she saw Chen Yao too.The two passed by each other.\u201cDon\u2019t lose. My next opponent is you, so don\u2019t go losing to Li Shufan.\u201d Chen Yao was full of spirit, before he descended like a streak of starlight towards Li Tianming.Lin Xiaoxiao pursed her lips. She was actually very confident. If she could beat Li Shufan, Chen Yao was even less of an issue. Thus, she didn\u2019t know where that confidence was coming from.Under the expectant gazes of everyone, she arrived before Li Shufan. The most exciting moment finally arrived. It wasn\u2019t because of that weird match-up between Li Tianming and Chen Yao, but the match between the first and second places of the Flameyellow Leaderboard!This could possibly be the most exciting match of the ranking battles! It was definitely a match of heavyweights.Lin Xiaoxiao and Li Shufan were both straightforward people. They had a decent relationship. There was no enmity involved in this fight, only the determination of victor and loser.Hence, their fight already started as Chen Yao arrived in front of Li Tianming.Thus, there was less attention paid to the fight between Li Tianming and Chen Yao as everyone just expected a one-sided trampling there. How could Li Tianming who had returned after three years compare to a true talent, the young master of Xing & Chen Merchantry?Even Chen Yao didn\u2019t expect to face off against Li Tianming here. When he laid eyes on him, he realised the rancor in his heart was even more than he had imagined.\u201cStupid mongrel. It seems you think I\u2019m afraid of your biting if I don\u2019t do anything. Since you dared call me down, I\u2019ll break your legs and teeth in front of everyone, including that dying mother of yours!\u201d Chen Yao knew if he didn\u2019t teach Li Tianming a lesson, any random stray cat or dog would come challenge him, a \u2018lion\u2019, from now on.\u201cMadam Xue Lan always acts as if she\u2019s well-bred, but her son lacks any sign of education. Talking so crassly only reveals your inner baseness, you know?\u201d Li Tianming smiled coldly. After three years, it was difficult for people to tell anger or happiness from his face anymore.While he seemed to be casually smiling on the surface, he was hiding a volcano inside, just waiting to erupt. He had been waiting for this too long.One was spewing insults while one was smiling pleasantly. Immediately, the contrast determined the superiority and inferiority between the two.Chen Yao saw the looks of disappointment from people in his conduct.It infuriated him even further to be judged as lesser than Li Tianming! However, the battle of words never mattered in the end on the battlefield. As long as he made Li Tianming kneel before him, everything else wouldn\u2019t matter.\u201cCome out!\u201d Chen Yao snapped, summoning his famous Hex-starred Clinquant Lion, which leapt out of his lifebound space covered in resplendent starlight.The lion was tall and mighty, holy yet awe-inspiring. It held the presence of the king of all beats.Besides each other, the man and beast pair complemented each other well, looking like gods incarnated.It was a star-type terrestrial beast that could manipulate the power of the stars in the sky, drawing on starlight to grow. It had limitless potential.Chen Yao using the Hex-Starred Clinquant Lion meant he wanted to crush Li Tianming thoroughly.From its fierce appearance, it was clear Chen Yao\u2019s emotions had affected it. It glared at Li Tianming, the starlight in its eyes pulsing. Its powerful claws gripped the ground, ready to pounce at Li Tianming at any moment.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 58": "Chapter 58 - This Is A Beatdown!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you want to fight one against two!\u201d Chen Yao frowned. He gathered his beast ki and used it to press down on Li Tianming.He had seen Li Tianming soloing a second level Spiritsource beastmaster and his beast. It did look quite impressive.Xue Lan had originally thought he was useless, but this performance made her gloomy. Now, Chen Yao wanted to sweep that all away!Li Shufan and Lin Xiaoxiao\u2019s battle was very spectacular, but some people divided their attention towards Chen Yao and Li Tianming. Many were speculating why there seemed to be so much conflict between the two.However, they would never arrive at any conclusion if they didn\u2019t recognise Wei Jing.\u201cNope, that\u2019ll be too easy for you.\u201d Li Tianming hadn\u2019t summoned the little chick yet because there hadn\u2019t been any worthy opponents so far.However, this Hex-Starred Clinquant Lion, with its aura as the king of beasts, didn\u2019t look any easy to deal with. It was time for it to make an appearance.A tender little chick appeared on Li Tianming\u2019s shoulder. His mysterious lifebound beast finally appeared in the ranking battles.Many had already heard descriptions of it, but a personal look made them realise the rumours hadn\u2019t done its tenderness and diminutiveness any justice!It looked weak enough that even a baby could crush it. How could it fight the Hex-Starred Clinquant Lion? One was like heaven, one was like earth!Even the Hex-Starred Clinquant Lion felt amused when it saw it. Its killing intent reduced by half, and its eyes filled with disdain.Perhaps, only Chen Yao knew looks were deceiving for this lifebound beast.\u201cProtect it well. Otherwise, you\u2019ll end up crying for another three years if I cut off its head.\u201d Chen Yao realised all of his upbringing seemed to fade away when he came before this person. He felt there was no need to care when it came to this kind of person.Beating up the dog was the only enjoyable way to do things.He drew his grade four beastial weapon, the Starriver Blade, from its sheath. It was a dark blue longsword upon which starlight sparkled, making it seem like a river of stars. Green heavenly patterns could also be faintly seen on it. The blinding starlight it radiated made it difficult to look at directly.\u201cProtect your little brother well. Otherwise, you\u2019ll have to become an eunuch if I peck off its head.\u201d With its temper, the little chick definitely wasn't happy to be mocked by Chen Yao as soon as it was summoned.A tender little chick looking at Chen Yao\u2019s groin with ill intentions and saying such words definitely made some people chuckle.However, Chen Yao felt his humiliation turn into rage. He realised trying to embarrass Li Tianming before the battle only served to work against him.He had already drawn his sword and his lion was snarling by his side. If he didn\u2019t fight now, then when!\u201cBro, let\u2019s kill this pretty boy for our mother!\u201d The little chick was furious.Li Tianming didn\u2019t need it to say anything to decide an opponent. Burning hot beast ki was circulating through his left arm, the Thunderfire Chain was wrapped around his right arm and mirages were starting to shimmer around his legs.When Mu Wan announced the start, he instantly sped towards Chen Yao!Today, he wanted to let Xue Lan know what was a beatdown!He had the infernalsource, which was equal to eight or nine spiritsources in power. He also had the Aeternal Infernal Beast Ki that was several times better in quality than normal people.Although he was only first level Spiritsource, not even a third level Spiritsource could withstand the suppression of his beast ki when he let it explode out. In other words, he hadn\u2019t shown his true power when he fought against the second level Spiritsource just now.\u201cHmph. Just a bluff,\u201d Chen Yao mocked.Bathed in starlight, he looked very elegant with the Starriver Sword in hand and the Hex-starred Clinquant Lion by his side.However, his intermediate source-ranked battle art was anything but elegant as it struck out with startling destructive power!Shooting Star Flying Sword Art!When he flourished the Starriver Sword, it transformed into a rain of falling stars that filled the sky! Drawing eye-piercing trajectories, stars descended from the sky, their target Li Tianming.The beautiful sword stance drew much commotion. It seemed that as soon as they started, Chen Yao was going to suppress Li Tianming.However, was that the truth?In the next moment, the Thunderfire Chain seemed to become a venomous dragon. Sparks of fire and lightning scattered, snaking into Chen Yao\u2019s sword attacks continuously.Chen Yao\u2019s movement art, the Seven Star Steps, was as good as Li Tianming\u2019s. However, he had neglected one thing. Before absolute power, no matter how pretty the sword stance or how sharp the weapon, they wouldn\u2019t be able to block Li Tianming\u2019s frenzied attacks!Nine Flying Bolts! For the first time ever, Li Tianming used all nine whip strikes from the first to ninth. They fell like nine lightning bolts from the heavens, producing heavy clangs every time their weapons clashed.Under the berserk chain attacks, Chen Yao\u2019s offensive collapsed. It was an utter crushing!Chen Yao\u2019s beast ki simply coudn\u2019t stand up to Li Tianming. In fact, the final whip strike wrenched Chen Yao\u2019s Starriver Sword out of his grasp.\u201cImpossible!\u201d They had only just begun and Chen Yao had already felt that feeling of being absolutely overpowered!He hadn\u2019t even registered losing his sword yet, only the pain from the torn skin on his hand.\u201cNothing is impossible. You\u2019re just too weak.\u201d The next moment, the Thunderfire Chain coiled three times around Chen Yao.A horrifying force abruptly transmitted from the chain, leaving horrible flesh wounds on Chen Yao. It didn\u2019t end there, as Li Tianming\u2019s right hand suddenly yanked him off the ground with the chain!Everyone watched dumbfounded as Chen Yao was totally routed. He was then unceremoniously tossed into the sky with the chain, before Li Tianming abruptly swung the chain and smashed him into the ground, his bones creaking ominously.\u201cSo, Chen Yao, who\u2019s the dog here?\u201d Li Tianming stood in front of Chen Yao, his eyes shining.Chen Yao was trembling on the ground, deathly pale. Everything had happened so fast, he hadn\u2019t even understood what just took place, until Li Tianming\u2019s foot ground into his face and he felt the acute pain from his body and face.He had actually suffered a complete and total beatdown by Li Tianming!He hadn\u2019t even had the slightest chance to resist!At such an abrupt, total defeat, Chen Yao felt like the world was collapsing around him!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 59": "Chapter 59 - Rampage!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIt had all ended in less than ten breaths of time. Lin Xiaoxiao and Li Shufan had only just started when Chen Yao, who should have crushed Li Tianming, had the tables turned on him immediately!Because it had happened so fast, everyone was still watching Lin Xiaoxiao\u2019s battle, only noticing Chen Yao\u2019s plight when they glanced over.\u201cAH!\u201d Chen Yao struggled mightily in an attempt to extricate himself from the Thunderfire Chain, only to make it tighter, increasing his pain.\u201cChen Yao, Chen Yao. Look at you now! You\u2019re on a leash rolling around on the ground and I\u2019m using my foot to step on you. Tell me, who\u2019s the dog?\u201d Li Tianming asked Chen Yao loudly. However, his words were actually directed at Xue Lan!He smiled in Xue Lan\u2019s direction as the force behind his foot nearly flattened Chen Yao\u2019s nose.He wanted to let Xue Lan know something. If you didn\u2019t want to help an old sister, fine. Just ignore her, and everyone will know the score. We won\u2019t bother you. However, there\u2019s no need to look down or fall out with each other. Nor do you have to take the pain of others for your entertainment!\u201cYou may have been born with a golden spoon in your mouth, but please try to act at least a little civilised. Don\u2019t keep barking like a mad dog. Otherwise, everyone can tell how much wickedness you're hiding behind that veneer of nobleness. People like you are the real vulgar ones!\u201d Li Tianming felt much better now.\u201cLet me go!\u201d Chen Yao screamed as he struggled and cried, his tears mixing with his blood.The scene was incredibly tragic, especially when one compared his current state to how he had previously been respected by all. No one could have recognised this crying fellow to be the young master of the Xing & Chen Merchantry!The audience all stared at Li Tianming, minds blank. What had happened?They looked at the Hex-starred Clinquant Lion\u2019s battle, hoping that it would put up a better performance.However, the situation there was similarly shocking. Before Ying Huo, the Hex-starred Clinquant Lion was like putty in its hands.The lion could never touch it no matter how it swung its claws. It had six spiritsource abilities, which it had all cycled through, but nothing had been accomplished.The little thing was like an untraceable and untrackable assassin.Once again, before absolute power, all techniques were but insignificant tricks.Just as Li Tianming had laid a beatdown on Chen Yao, so too had the little chick on the Hex-starred Clinquant Lion.It showed that whether master or beast, they were much stronger than their counterparts, and not just by a bit!Li Tianming could guess how furious Madam Xue Lan was in her private room now!Honestly, Li Tianming was aware that Chen Yao was Sage Chen\u2019s son, and Sage Chen was helping him. However, his intuition told him Sage Chen wouldn\u2019t mind him doing this. Xue Lan had spoiled him rotten; that was a fact.But above all, he wanted to help his mother vent. Now, all of Xue Lan\u2019s superiority complex and all the hurtful words she had said was like a slap back in her face! And it felt good!Wei Jing had asked him if he could teach Chen Yao a lesson, and the answer he had now shown was a resounding yes.He had also given Xue Lan a slap on the face as he did so. While it wasn\u2019t a physical slap, it definitely smarted and stung.Li Tianming tried to find his mother in the crowd, but it wasn\u2019t easy. However, he was sure that his mother was definitely crying with happiness for him now, because he had proven himself before tens of thousands of people.It was exactly this kind of happiness that life needed!Were those cruel and heartless people watching as Li Tianming stepped on Chen Yao and trussed him up like a little puppy?This was the real him, possessing the courage and guts to do this! In fact, some would even go as far as to say the current Li Tianming instilled some reverence in them.However, Li Tianming still felt this was far from enough. This was only a declaration, and he didn\u2019t qualify to appear in front of his real enemies yet.\u201cSo, how does it feel, Chen Yao?\u201d Li Tianming said conversationally as he lifted his foot off. However, that didn\u2019t remove the large footprint or swelling on Chen Yao\u2019s face.\u201cUrk\u2026\u201d In his pain, Chen Yao could only tremble and gasp for breath. Of course, when he imagined all of the mocking words he had said to Li Tianming, the pain was surely magnified!\u201cYao\u2019er!\u201d Li Tianming finally heard Xue Lan\u2019s voice. The beautiful moment had finally arrived.\u201cLi Tianming, I swear I\u2019ll kill you! I will definitely make you pay thousandfold the price. I\u2019ll kill your whole family!\u201d Chen Yao was half howling, half gasping for breath.\u201cOh my god! Young master Chen Yao really is the badass among badasses. However, let me tell you, the person I respect the most is Li Yanfeng, currently working for Lightning Manor. If you kill him somehow, I fear I\u2019ll be so, so unbelievably sad,\u201d Li Tianming chuckled.\u201cLI YANFENG! I\u2019ll remember that name!\u201d Chen Yao gritted his teeth. Unfortunately, he was missing several teeth, which made it quite the arduous task.\u201cRelease my Yao\u2019er! Let me go up!\u201d That shrill voice punctuated the air again. Li Tianming turned to see Xue Lan was indeed below. Her clothes were dishevelled and her hair a mess. Combined with her pale countenance, she looked less elegant, and more like a shrew now.However, Hall Overseer Wei Zikun prevented her from going up. It wasn\u2019t very appropriate to let her interfere with Flameyellow Scions Institute\u2019s sacred tradition of ranking battles after all.Mu Wan threw a wink from the side. \u201cMadam Xue Lan, calm yourself. Chen Yao only has some flesh wounds. It\u2019s very embarrassing for you to cause all this hoo-hah!\u201dTwo young men joined Xue Lan, each taking an arm. Both of them were also wearing cold and ashen expressions, boiling with killing intent as they focused on Li Tianming.Li Tianming recognised them. They were Xing Que and Chen Hao, both his age. They had ranked in the top five the previous batch. At that time, Li Tianming didn\u2019t qualify to interact with them with his low rank.Now, they were Heaven\u2019s Sanctum disciples, while Li Tianming was still stuck fighting with their little brother.They didn\u2019t levy any vicious words, only supporting Xue Lan and whispering a few words into her ear. Even then, Xue Lan still fixed Li Tianming with a death glare.Li Tianming couldn\u2019t wrap his head around how such an elegant madam could make such a ferocious expression.\u201cYou\u2019ve won, Li Tianming. Let him go and don\u2019t do anything unnecessary. I declare your victory,\u201d Wei Zikun said.\u201cNo problem, Hall Overseer!\u201d Li Tianming had already enjoyed himself. Most enjoyable was Xue Lan\u2019s expression, as if she had been made to eat some dog shit.\u201cMadam, don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll return Chen Yao to you right away. Still did you eat something bad? You\u2019re not looking too good there! Be careful, you have to watch your diet when you\u2019re getting on in age. I may not have tried it, but I\u2019m sure dog shit isn\u2019t any tasty!\u201dLi Tianming tossed out Chen Yao. While Xing Que managed to catch him, it provoked another yelp of pain.Xue Lan nearly fainted when she took a closer look. Her darling son had never been mistreated like this before. Her entire body shook as she looked at Li Tianming, speechless.\u201cMadam, why are you shaking? Is the weather too cold for you? You can\u2019t skimp on clothing just because you want to look good!\u201d Anyone could hear the blatant sarcasm in Li Tianming\u2019s tone.No one knew what conflict existed between the two, but what they did know was that this was Li Tianming publicly setting himself against the behemoth, Xing & Chen Merchantry.From start to finish, Li Tianming had carried a smile on his face, leaving others unable to read his emotions.As for Xue Lan, this was perhaps the first time she had ever felt like this. Her body shook uncontrollably as she struggled to find words.If they weren\u2019t being watched by an audience, she would have probably ripped apart the whole Flameyellow Stadium. She was actually at a rather high cultivation stage, having access to Xing & Chen Merchantry\u2019s resources.\u201cMother, don\u2019t bother talking too much. He may have won now, but all he can do is spew some nonsense. Such juvenile behaviour only goes to show he won\u2019t live for long.\u201d Xue Lan\u2019s elder son, Chen Hao, patted her on the back, trying to calm her down.\u201cTrue. No one can offend our Xing & Chen Merchantry without paying a price.\u201d\u201cAfter this, I\u2019ll see who dares to protect him. What\u2019s the big deal with him beating Yao\u2019er at his age?\u201d\u201cHe only won with his age advantage. After entering the institute, he would be at the bottom of the heap.\u201d Xing Que narrowed his eyes.The two exchanged a look, immediately making many plans to torment Li Tianming.\u201cFine.\u201d Xue Lan finally relaxed, but her expression, as Li Tianming put aptly, looked like she had eaten some dog shit. She could only declare that Li Tianming and his mother would see what the Xing & Chen Merchantry was capable of.Li Tianming didn\u2019t have much time to act cool before a new commotion arose. On the other stage, Lin Xiaoxiao defeated Li Shufan as expected and defended her prime disciple position.Fervent gazes landed on the two respective winners.Li Tianming was now third as he had defeated Chen Yao. Second place had fallen.Hence, while unbelievable, the conclusion was that Li Tianming now had the right to contest for prime disciple.Lin Xiaoxiao and Li Tianming. Between these two, who would become the prime disciple?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Everyone had thought that the battle between Li Shufan and Lin Xiaoxiao was already the highlight of the day. But the appearance of Li Tianming had just cast doubt on that result, considering that the black horse had just defeated Chen Yao in a one-sided beatdown.Li Tianming, compared to Li Shufan, was more qualified to challenge the first place of the Flameyellow Leaderboard.Lin Xiaoxiao defeating Li Shufan was within most people\u2019s expectations, so the only question that remained was how far Li Tianming could go. That joker from three years ago, just what could he achieve today?No one was going to question his age since the ranking test would not take that into consideration, and in terms of talent, the two were worlds apart. But even if Li Tianming was five years older, for a boy from a faraway city to be able to even challenge the Lightning Manor's twin beastmaster was nothing short of a miracle in itself!Lin Xiaoxiao had been paying attention to the other battle, and witnessed how easily Li Tianming defeated Chen Yao. She was clear that the only roadblock left was Li Tianming. As for those outside of the top five on the leaderboard, they probably couldn\u2019t even overcome Chen Yao, let alone stand a chance against her.She desired to be the prime disciple as much as Li Tianming did, if not more.\u201cFour years ago, elder brother became the prime disciple and brought glory to the Lightning Manor. Father has high expectations of me, and I must not disappoint him or the manor!\u201d Lin Xiaoxiao was already staring at Li Tianming, urging for a battle.The stadium was rather quiet, as the five hall overseers had stopped all other battles already. The ranking test was coming to an end, where the leaderboard more or less reflected the strength of each individual disciple.As Chen Yao, Li Shufan, and their family members exited the arena, Wei Zikun announced to the crowd, \u201cI believe everyone here understands the importance of the battle for the prime disciple. Now that Li Shufan and Chen Yao have been defeated, and those from fifth place onward do not have the strength to fight for the position of prime disciple, we can safely conclude that the quadrennial mystery shall be solved with one last battle.\u201dThe hall overseers and the chief mentor had a great say over the ranking test, and their judgements of disciples were mostly accurate and unquestioned too. Li Tianming clearly had the capability to try for first place, and they would arrange a battle for him to do so. Not to mention that Li Tianming belonged to the Hall of Phoenix, and the overseer of the Hall of Phoenix, Wei Zikun, was the one in charge on the ranking test today.\u201cOverseer Wei, I think the moment we have all been waiting for has arrived. Please arrange a battle between those two youngsters,\u201d From within the biggest room, the Vermilion Bird Royal Clan\u2019s King Xuan declared.\u201cYes, King Xuan.\u201d Wei Zikun smiled, and then announced, \u201cThe five hall overseers have come to a united decision that the position of the Prime Disciple this year shall be decided between Lin Xiaoxiao from Hall of Manibeasts, and Li Tianming from Hall of Phoenix. The victor shall be directly admitted to Heaven's Sanctum!\u201dHe added, \u201cAs for the fifth place and below, based on your performances and our judgement, we have decided that none of you are qualified to challenge these two.\u201dAccording to the rules, anyone from the top ten were given the chance to issue a challenge, but the final decision still remained in the overseers\u2019 hands. And in today\u2019s case, they have decided that any battle other than the one between Lin Xiaoxiao and Li Tianming was pointless.\u201cI already vented out my anger on Chen Yao, but that\u2019s not what I\u2019m here for today. Mother\u2019s condition is deteriorating, and I must enter Heaven's Sanctum. I have to defeat Lin Xiaoxiao!\u201d Li Tianming was clear that he could not back off from this battle, and he must defeat Lin Xiaoxiao, no matter the cost.He had never included Lin Xiaoxiao into his hatred of Lin Xiaoting and Mu Qingqing. In fact, in terms of animosity, he probably disliked Chen Yao way more. Nonetheless the battle with Lin Xiaoxiao just meant much, much more to him. Therefore, Li Tianming would put in his best, no matter who he was facing, to be the prime disciple!Only when his name stood at the top of the Flameyellow Leaderboard, could he proudly tell Ignispolis that he, Li Tianming, was back! And only then, would mother tell him about the secrets between her and the sanctum. He knew that her time was running out, especially since that assassination.\u201cYou will have fifteen minutes to prepare, after which you will present the audience with an exciting battle,\u201d Wei Zikun told Li Tianming and Lin Xiaoxiao.Fifteen minutes of resting was not that long, and it passed in a flash. Considering the importance of the battle, many of Lightning Manor\u2019s youngsters were surrounding Lin Xiaoxiao, encouraging and cheering for her. As for Li Tianming\u2019s side, he only had Chief Mentor Mu Wan, since it wasn\u2019t convenient for Wei Jing to come down from the audience.Mu Wan patted his shoulders. \u201cWell, here we are. Just do your best and prove yourself.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, chief mentor. I won't lose to that little girl.\u201d Li Tianming smiled.\u201cHa, cocky brats like you tend to lose it especially in the important fights. Clearly you don\u2019t have a clue as to how difficult it is to fight a twin beastmaster.\u201d Mu Wan rolled her eyes.\u201cAre you still my chief mentor? Why are you cheering my opponents on instead of me? I request a change of class, I want to get out of here!\u201d Li Tianming chuckled.Of course, Li Tianming knew what twin beastmasters were capable of, since Lin Xiaoting himself was one. Back then, the difference between them was so huge that Lin Xiaoting could easily crush him with a single hand without even using his lifebound beast.\u201cGo ahead, are you going to walk out now?\u201d Mu Wan winked.\u201cNah, definitely not.\u201d Li Tianming grinned. After all, Mu Wan was the only one in this stadium supporting him, apart from Wei Jing and Auntie Li!As the moment drew closer and closer, a tense atmosphere enveloped the entire stadium. Li Tianming closed his eyes, and he could feel the Aeternal Infernal Beast Ki running through his body, as if his body was burning from inside.At that instance, he could feel someone looking at him unlike anyone else. The look was enough to make his heart shudder, as the last time someone looked at him like that was three years ago.The moment he opened his eyes, he saw the girl in a white dress standing beside Lin Xiaoxiao. She had long hair reaching her waist, her fair skin shining in the gentle sunlight.At last, she had finally appeared.Li Tianming thought of the day they met. It was when the both of them had just gotten the Flameyellow Order, and were on their way to Ignispolis from their respective hometowns.She was walking in the wilderness when she ran into two lechers who were after her beauty. She fought, one against two, but the situation looked grim for her. Just as she was about to be defeated, and the attackers were about to get what they wanted, Li Tianming appeared out of nowhere.At that time, he didn\u2019t know how such a beautiful girl could exist. He could feel his heartstrings being pulled.After a fearless battle, they finally defeated the attackers, but Li Tianming himself was on the brink of death. It was she who carried him to find a doctor in the nearby town. Even as he drifted in and out of coma due to his loss of blood, he could still feel the warmth of her body.After that, they found out that they both had the Flameyellow Order, and from there headed towards the capital together. Along the way Li Tianming said all kinds of clumsy jokes just to please her, and she laughed along to them.Perhaps she was grateful towards Li Tianming. Perhaps she was touched by his bravery. Whatever the reason, on the night they passed the admission test and became disciples of the institute, Li Tianming kissed her under the moonlight. It was Li Tianming\u2019s first relationship, and being madly in love, Li Tianming did all that he could for her, even passing her some of the resources he got for cultivation.He had always thought that he belonged with her, and she with him, that they were bound to spend the rest of their lives together. For a year they were together, and Li Tianming could remember every single day, every single thing that had happened.Her smiles, her words of encouragement, would still appear in his mind once in a while. He was with her all the while, be it when she was happy or when she was sad. They had even decided how many kids they would like to have in the future.Back then, diligence was her utmost virtue. She worked way harder than Li Tianming in terms of cultivation, as she had an unfortunate background. While she was the daughter of the governor of Windhaven, she was born from a lowly servant in the manor, who was killed for her transgression not long after her birth. If it wasn\u2019t for her father\u2019s protection and her own talents, she would be dead a long time ago.But life worked in the most funny and unfortunate ways. He trusted her with everything he had, and thought that he knew her better than anyone else. And when she decided to stab him in the back, who could ever imagine the amount of pain and suffering that he went through?Li Tianming wondered. If he hadn\u2019t gotten the Saintbeast War-Soul, or had not told her about it, would that have been a better ending for the both of them?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 61": "Chapter 61 - And I Wish You To Die Heirless!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaySadly, he would never get an answer to that what-if. Three years on, she now stood with the Lightning Manor, supporting her opponent with the countless other spectators in the stadium.She had appeared without any fuss, looking at Li Tianming as if he was a stranger. It was as if the young man had never left a mark in her life. From the very start, she had been inside the Lightning Manor\u2019s room, taking in everything that had happened so far. Only when he was about to battle with Lin Xiaoxiao did she walk out to stand beside Lin Xiaoxiao, supporting her lover\u2019s younger sister.Their arrival in Ignispolis, their struggle to survive in this big city... everything seemed like just yesterday when all that happened. But now, she had adapted to this land, surpassing her contemporaries here.Li Tianming had no desire to mourn for their ruined relationship. Nor did he want to cover that burning hatred in his heart. He could handle her betrayal, but he would never forget the cruel murder of Midas at her \u2014 and Lin Xiaoting\u2019s \u2014 hands!His eyes blazed with anger. The mere sight of her had torn open the wound in Li Tianming\u2019s heart. Personal emotions shouldn\u2019t affect his upcoming battle with Lin Xiaoxiao, but just seeing her standing beside Mu Qingqing was enough to rile him up.Of course, everyone in the stadium knew the story, but it was the version that she and Lin Xiaoting had made up together. In this story, Li Tianming was but a laughingstock, a disgrace of a disciple. Now that their paths had crossed again, especially under the public eye, things were bound to get interesting.\u201cLong time no see, Li Tianming,\u201d she said gently as her sight landed on him. Surprise flickered through his face as she initiated the conversation \u2014 according to her script, he should be the detestable, immoral brute.\u201cIt\u2019s been some time,\u201d Li Tianming replied.\u201cI have never imagined that you could reach this step.\u201d Her words were emotionless, neutral.\u201cDisappointed?\u201d Li Tianming said coolly.\u201cNo. I\u2019m happy you have turned over a new leaf and found your direction in life again. Remember to not make any more mistakes.\u201d\u201cThank you for your advice. I\u2019ll make sure not to make mistakes next time,\u201d Li Tianming replied. What \u2018mistake\u2019 meant to both of them, however, varied vastly. For him, it meant his meeting and saving of her, back when they first met. But he wasn\u2019t ever going to say it.\u201cThen, I wish you all the best for your future,\u201d Mu Qingqing said.\u201cAnd I wish you to die heirless.\u201dHow could Li Tianming not understand her intention to act benevolent in front of the public? Evidently, Mu Qingqing herself was too absorbed with that story she co-authored with Lin Xiaoting.There was no point tearing off her mask since no one would believe a word he said. But his wish for her die heirless was genuine. Since Mu Qingqing and Lin Xiaoting were together, it was as good as wishing for the Lightning Manor to end in their generation!Anyone could hear the aggressiveness in their conversation. Mu Qingqing was a magnanimous girl, who didn\u2019t just forgive Li Tianming, but also wished him all the best. In contrast, Li Tianming had started alright, but the vicious curse at the end was enough to shock everyone. In everyone\u2019s eyes, this was living proof that leopards never changed their spots.\u201cGetting you to start afresh and forget the past seems impossible after all.\u201d Mu Qingqing shook her head regretfully and sighed.\u201cBig sis Qingqing, don\u2019t bother yourself with this kind of person. He doesn't know how to be grateful for your forgiveness, and he probably still hates you for executing his lifebound beast.\u201d Lin Xiaoxiao was generally a good-natured girl, but even she couldn\u2019t control her temper.\u201cHm.\u201d Mu Qingqing smiled at her and held her hand. The hint of disappointment in her eyes was so realistic, Li Tianming would have given her a prize for her acting.\u201cChallenge me, Li Tianming! Scum like you have no place in the institute, let alone Heaven\u2019s Sanctum. No one here will even support you!\u201d Lin Xiaoxiao pointed at the largest arena.No one will support him? But he never needed it in the first place. His mother was sitting in the audience, and wasn\u2019t that enough? He also had Chief Mentor Mu Wan, which was another huge plus!At that moment, Wei Zikun announced, \u201cThe final battle for the prime disciple position will hereby commence!\u201dThe announcement tossed the stadium into applause and cheers once again. But before the fight could commence, something unexpected happened. Two girls walked out of one of the private rooms and approached the arena. Their appearance riled up the crowd, and Li Tianming\u2019s jaws dropped in disbelief!\u201cLook, it\u2019s the sixth princess Jiang Qingluan, and the Vermilion Bird Emperor\u2019s goddaughter, Princess Ling!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s no wonder why they call her the number one beauty of Vermilion Bird. Her beauty is otherworldly.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s always giving off this unique, fairy-like aura that makes even Princess Qing look mundane when placed beside her.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, \u2018goddess\u2019 is the only suitable word to describe her.\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t say that. If the Sixth Princess was by herself, she would be a looker too.\u201dLi Tianming\u2019s mind went blank for the briefest of moments. He knew that Jiang Feiling and Princess Qing were in Ignispolis, that they belonged to the Vermilion Bird Clan, but their appearance here was... unexpected.They must have been with King Xuan previously.Li Tianming looked up to see the two of them. He only found out today that Princess Qing was the Sixth Princess, Jiang Qingluan. She was quite a sensation in Heaven\u2019s Sanctum, having gotten in there with the emperor\u2019s help without even having to attend the entrance exam. Even on the Heavenly Leaderboard, the sanctum\u2019s internal ranking, her name was ranked among the very top.Having not seen them in a few days, Li Tianming missed the way Jiang Feiling stood out in the crowd. It was like she could make him forget all his worries and focus just on her, befitting her nickname of \u2018goddess\u2019.\u201cNumber one beauty of Vermilion Bird, huh?\u201d Li Tianming smiled. It was a suitable title. Mu Qingqing wasn\u2019t a serious contender for that title, now that he\u2019d seen both princesses. He recalled how he thought Princess Qing was Jiang Feiling\u2019s maid \u2014 Mu Qingqing must have felt that way when she stood beside Jiang Feiling.Jiang Feiling was just charming in all aspects, be it appearance, aura or elegance. It was a charm that transcended gender. As an illustration, Mu Wan, whose eyes were glowing right now, was currently whispering in Li Tianming\u2019s ears, \u201cEven I would want that Princess Ling.\u201d\u201cErrrrr...\u201d Li Tianming didn\u2019t expect his chief mentor to be so open-minded.\u201cLook at them walking towards the arena, do they want a better look at the battle?\u201d\u201cOr are they going up to support Lin Xiaoxiao?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 62": "Chapter 62 - Celestial WingsPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayEven though they were still a distance apart, Li Tianming\u2019s eyes caught Jiang Feiling\u2019s.\u201cBig brother Tianming.\u201d Her cry was soft as she trotted towards Li Tianming, dragging Jiang Qingluan along. The crowd automatically cleared a path for the pair as they approached the arena.\u201cWho was Princess Ling calling?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t hear clearly\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy did I hear \u2018Li Tianming\u2019?\u201d\u201cBro, you deaf? How would these two even know each other?\u201d\u201cYeah, the difference between shit and silver\u2019s smaller.\u201dAnd yet, for all their denials, Jiang Feiling had stopped in front of Li Tianming, a brilliant smile on her face. \u201cBig brother Tianming, I watched your performance just now, they were really amazing! I can\u2019t believe you really came to Ignispolis.\u201d\u201cLing\u2019er, I've told you to stay away from this farmer. Haven\u2019t you heard what he did three years ago? So what if this bastard can accomplish something today?\u201d Princess Qing rolled her eyes.\u201cDon\u2019t say that. I can see for myself what kind of a person he is. His heart is pure \u2014 he would never do such a thing,\u201d Jiang Feiling replied, simply because she trusted her judgement. She was a special girl, and had her own ways of interpreting the world around her.\u201cHere we go again.\u201d Jiang Qingluan slapped her forehead, but there was nothing she could do.She glared at Li Tianming, \u201cFarmer, now that you are in Ignispolis and had finally found us, it\u2019s about time you give me back my jade pendant.\u201dThe stage was dead silent other than the three of them \u2014 everyone was listening to their conversation with bated breath.\u201cMust I?\u201d Li Tianming asked.\u201cObviously.\u201d\u201cWhat a pity, I just don\u2019t want to return it.\u201dJiang Qingluan gritted her teeth. \u201cLing\u2019er, now that you have seen this man, can we leave now? He\u2019s about to become an embarrassment. \u201d She pursed her lips, acutely aware of the audience\u2019s gawking.\u201cNo, you can go first. I want to try my newly awakened ability with Brother Tianming. And I want to support his battle,\u201d Jiang Feiling immediately replied.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Jiang Qingluan was speechless. Jiang Feiling was in fact not a patient person, and would never hold back once she made her decision.\u201cHurry up then. This guy has a trashy reputation. Being together with him will put you under public scrutiny too.\u201d Jiang Qingluan threw another glare at Li Tianming. No matter how she saw it, Li Tianming looked like the evil one deceiving innocent girls.\u201cDon\u2019t accuse him, big brother is a clean person.\u201d Jiang Feiling\u2019s eyes were firmer than ever.\u201cWhatever, just hurry.\u201d Jiang Qingluan knew there was no way she could stop Ling\u2019er. As such, Jiang Feiling finally had the chance to talk to Li Tianming without being interrupted.\u201cBig brother, after I returned to Ignispolis, another of the abilities in my nails was unsealed. Other than Spiritual Attachment and Temporal Field, I learnt a third ability,\u201d Jiang Feiling said eagerly. The last time they met, she promised that she would try her newly awakened abilities with Li Tianming.\u201cCare to show me?\u201d Li Tianming was totally aware of the audience staring at them, but he couldn\u2019t care less. Right now, this world belonged to them and them alone.\u201cThe ability is somewhat like Spiritual Attachment, and requires me to attach to big brother\u2019s body too.\u201d Jiang Feiling said with anticipation.Spiritual Attachment had allowed her to fuse into his body and give a mystical power to his beast ki. The effects were capable of boosting Li Tianming\u2019s strength by almost an entire level. What would the new ability do? Li Tianming looked forward to it just as much.As for the spectators, some were confused, while others were irked. Li Tianming just smirked, enjoying their reactions. The two princesses had stunned everyone who had looked down on him. Everyone thought of him to be just a beggar, but why was this beggar so close with the princesses? And was he actually teasing that Princess Qing\u2026But before they could express their annoyance, the events that followed transcended their imagination.\u201cBig brother, ready?\u201d\u201cNaturally.\u201d Li Tianming opened his arms wide, looking as if he was about to embrace Princess Ling.Although Princess Ling was picked up by the Vermilion Bird King and was therefore not his bloodline descendent, she had been treated like a real daughter, even given a prestigious position in the royal clan. She had no lifebound beasts and no means to cultivate, but it was said that she possessed the power to make Princess Qing stronger.The audience blanched right after Li Tianming finished his words. Jiang Feiling\u2019s body had broke apart into millions of sparkles, gathering around Li Tianming\u2019s body and his back in particular to form something.Boom!With a brilliant radiance, a pair of blinding white wings had appeared on Li Tianming\u2019s back. The wings were woven by the sparkles, which were tightly packed together.As the wings spread wide, Li Tianming took to the air with a single flap like a flying beast. Like a fledgling flying for the first time, he mucked around in mid-air for a few moments, before landing catastrophically.It was quite a fast demonstration, and as Li Tianming landed, the sparkles regathered in front of Li Tianming to form back into Jiang Feiling. Part of the radiance remained on her body, making her look even more like a fairy.\u201cBig brother, look at that! The Celestial Wings had complete synchronization too!\u201d Elated by the results, Jiang Feiling wanted to hug Li Tianming. Common sense, however, informed her that there were too many people, and it was with some reluctance that she hugged Jiang Qingluan instead.\u201cQing\u2019er, Qing\u2019er, did you see that? Big brother is incredible, he fully synchronised with the Celestial Wings too! Did you see the speed at which he was flying?\u201d\u201cOh. Oh.\u201d Jiang Qingluan could feel her head aching. How could she not be jealous of Li Tianming? Unfortunately, she could only close her eyes and swallow this bitter farmer pill.Jiang Feiling, on the other hand, was overjoyed. She had gotten the results that she wanted. Li Tianming and her were practically made for each other.This was within Jiang Qingluan\u2019s expectations as well, but she could only curse at Li Tianming in her mind. Ever since they met at Red Twill Mountain, all of Jiang Feiling\u2019s other skills showed signs of awakening. It wouldn't be that bad if he was a prince charming, but the notorious farmer, Li Tianming, was worlds away from that.My head hurts... Pursing her lips, she said, \u201cLing\u2019er, you got what you wanted, can we go now?\u201d\u201cNo, I still want to support big brother\u2019s battle,\u201d Jiang Feiling said hopefully. \u201cBig brother, Qing\u2019er is a disciple of the sanctum and both of us live there. If you become the prime disciple today, you can come and visit us more often!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 63": "Chapter 63 - Blow Enough Hot Air To Blow Away Ignispolis!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cSure, then I have to become the prime disciple for Ling\u2019er\u2019s sake.\u201d Li Tianming puffed up his chest.\u201cI believe you,\u201d Jiang Feiling said sweetly.Jiang Qingluan snorted. \u201cBelieve what? In your ability to brag? If you, a farmer, does somehow become the prime disciple, I won\u2019t stop you from meeting Ling\u2019er anymore.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Li Tianming said excitedly.\u201c\u2018If\u2019 being the operative word.\u201dLi Tianming chuckled. \u201cAlright, watch and learn.\u201d\u201cHmph, we\u2019ll see.\u201d Before tens of thousands of people, the grand Princess Qing deigned to spit on the ground to show her contempt.The current Li Tianming was definitely very eye-catching. People couldn\u2019t help but wonder how he was so close to Princess Ling, even winning her fancy to boot.Li Tianming had noticed it too. Jiang Feiling had chosen this moment of all times to meet him and even show him the Celestial Wings. Was it possible she was trying to help him with her identity as a princess, when he was being cursed by many?Everyone could see her adorable behaviour in front of Li Tianming. Who would call him a joke after this?\u201cIf that\u2019s how it is, she really is too kind.\u201d Li Tianming felt a long-lost warmth in his chest.His impression of Jiang Feiling wasn\u2019t one of an impatient girl. It wouldn\u2019t have been difficult for her to approach him after the fight was over. In fact, they could meet anytime in Flameyellow Scions Institute. For her to choose now was a sign of how considerate she was.Li Tianming suddenly realised that this truly pure-hearted girl had already found a place in his heart, one that had been empty for three years.It wasn\u2019t just a gaping emptiness. It was filled with wounds from when Mu Qingqing had taken his heart and shattered it into pieces. However, today, this girl had picked those pieces up and filled it with sweetness. Perhaps one day, it would heal whole again. \u2018Moved\u2019 wasn\u2019t enough to describe his feelings now. He picked up many seemingly tiny details, from her saying he was a good person to believing he could do what he claimed. Such a person was capable of overturning the distaste towards \u2018love\u2019, a conviction Li Tianming had held for three years. Before this, Mu Qingqing and Li Yanfeng had made him consider it to be one of the filthiest things in the world.Li Tianming was actually underestimating the positive ripples caused by Jiang Feiling\u2019s appearance.Some of his critics had been shocked into silence, unable to understand how he was even able to get along with two princesses so well. It was like a toad becoming friends with a swan, simply inconceivable.Some others, who had a greater understanding of Jiang Feiling, had completely different feelings when they heard \u2018Celestial Wings\u2019 and \u2018complete synchronisation\u2019.\u201cFrom what I know, the Vermilion Bird King once said Princess Ling is a miracle. Although she can\u2019t become a beastmaster, she has certain special abilities sealed in her. When all are unlocked, there will be great benefits for those around her. Currently, the person most compatible with her is Princess Qing, who was born on the same day as her. They have a grade six synchronisation, and as for others? Not even grade four.\u201d Lin Xiaoxiao looked enviously at her when Jiang Feiling appeared, before speaking about her to Mu Qingqing.\u201cShe really is quite mysterious. She\u2019s a child the king picked up that was supposedly abandoned at birth. Everything about her really can be a miracle, which is why it\u2019s unfathomable Li Tianming can reach a complete synchronisation with her,\u201d Lin Xiaoxiao continued, but Mu Qingqing didn\u2019t respond.\u201cBig sister Qingqing, do you know how this came to be? You used to know him. Was there anything special about him?\u201d Lin Xiaoxiao asked.\u201cErr\u2026\u201d Mu Qingqing finally snapped out of her daze, before she hurriedly responded, \u201cI don\u2019t really know. We could only barely count as acquaintances three years ago.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d Lin Xiaoxiao nodded.\u201cLi Tianming and Lin Xiaoxiao, it\u2019s time! Hurry up!\u201d Wei Zikun\u2019s voice caused the area to heat up again. Everyone was waiting for the final battle, and even two princesses could only delay it so much.\u201cBig brother, you have me and Qing\u2019er\u2019s support! Win and become prime disciple!\u201dLi Tianming smiled. \u201cDefinitely. I\u2019ll definitely send her home crying.\u201dJiang Qingluan rolled her eyes.\u201cBlowing hot air again? Be careful not to blow Ignispolis away.\u201d\u201cRemember, you won\u2019t stop me from becoming friends with Ling\u2019er if I win.\u201d\u201cHar har.\u201dAnd with this, Li Tianming gained half a supporter, Jiang Qingluan.He stepped onto the stage and prepared for battle. Lin Xiaoxiao stood in front of him, annoyance and doubt written on her face.\u201cLi Tianming, you\u2019ve been an eyesore to me for quite a while. I detest shameless people like you who still dare to show your face after committing evil the most! I\u2019ll teach you a lesson today and make you apologise sincerely to big sister Qingqing!\u201d Li Tianming\u2019s curse of Mu Qingqing being childless had infuriated her.\u201cLittle miss, you actually aren\u2019t scared of me! I\u2019m a big bad wolf who always carries drugs on me. Do you have a boyfriend to come out and save you at the critical moment though?\u201d Li Tianming said, much to the shock of everyone present. He actually dared to mention it in public?\u201cLet\u2019s see if you\u2019re willing to have your lifebound beast sentenced to death again, then,\u201d Lin Xiaoxiao replied quietly, a calm fury brewing in her. Riling her up was no mean feat, but this person, who had committed wrongs yet still acted in such a way, had done it anyway.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 64": "Chapter 64 - A Fifteen-Year-Old Girl Genius!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cExecute my lifebound beast? That\u2019s ok, I have backups!\u201d Li Tianming smiled.\"Wow, Li Tianming, and I took you as a brother!\u201d The little chick nearly fell off his shoulder from the shock.\u201cLifebound beasts are like brothers and sisters to me. Yet, you can actually utter such words. Whoever becomes your lifebound beast is unlucky through and through!\u201d Lin Xiaoxiao\u2019s face turned even redder in her anger.\u201cWhat can I do? I can only blame my charm for making so many lifebound beasts line up to follow me!\u201d\u201cYou really are incorrigible. I\u2019ve never met someone as shameless as you before!\u201d Lin Xiaoxiao returned fire.\u201cThat\u2019s just because you lack social skills. If not, you would know that the world is just filled with shameless people. Who knows, one of them might even be right next to you?\u201d\u201cActing mysterious!\u201d Lin Xiaoxiao looked anyway, but only Mu Qingqing was next to her now, which only served to infuriate her further.\u201cEnough, enough! Begin the fight!\u201d Wei Zikun was forced to step in as the argument heated up. This was the fight to become the prime disciple, not to resolve their personal grudges. Their argument would never end, so they might as well cross blades to decide who was right.\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for this.\u201d Lin Xiaoxiao gritted her teeth. However, due to her youth, her red face and gritted teeth gave her an adorable look instead.Lin Xiaoxiao nodded to Mu Qingqing, reassuring her that she would definitely teach Li Tianming a lesson.She jumped onto the largest stage and jabbed a finger at Li Tianming. \u201cThe lesson I teach you today will be a very painful one.\u201dLi Tianming\u2019s mouth twitched. \u201cHow scary. You\u2019re so shrew-like at such a young age. What kind of childhood did you have?\u201dLin Xiaoxiao\u2019s anger turned into a frigid chill, and she stopped speaking. Martial might would do it for her.She had been evaluated to have 950 points after a few random battles, just shy of a perfect score on the rating system. She definitely wasn\u2019t one to underestimate.When they both stepped onto the stage, the long-awaited battle would start.Who would be the prime disciple would be decided soon!To Li Tianming, Mu Qingqing being so close to watch was just perfect. He still didn\u2019t have the chance to make her pay, but at least he could make her see clearly from nearby, and tell her that not killing him three years ago was her greatest mistake.Only Li Tianming could see in her eyes the absolute contempt she had for him.Perhaps, in her heart, she regarded twin beastmasters as unrivaled, and both Lin siblings fell in that category. Furthermore, the fifteen year old Lin Xiaoxiao was more worthy to be the prime disciple than the disciple who was nearly overaged.As Li Tianming glanced at Mu Qingqing, Lin Xiaoxiao\u2019s two lifebound beasts appeared.The violent Vajra Berserk Ape appeared by her side, the juxtaposition of a little pretty girl and a huge beast creating quite the visual impact.The Tri-Coloured Darkthunder Bird fluttered above her, its eyes locked onto the little chick, killing intent concealed within them. It was the animosity between avian lifebound beasts.\u201cTwin beastmasters really are the darlings of fate!\u201d\u201cLin Xiaoxiao really is a cut above her peers. Li Shufan didn\u2019t even get to resist earlier on.\u201d\u201cIt was the same with Lin Xiaoting four years ago. Who can stand up to two lifebound beasts? Those siblings are incredible.\u201d\u201cI foresee a bright future for the Lightning Manor in the coming decades.\u201dMany top powerhouses gave Lin Xiaoxiao high evaluations.In terms of performance, she was actually better than Lin Xiaoting in the past. As long as she defeated Li Tianming, the \u2018overaged disciple\u2019, what followed would be the brilliant prospects of Heaven\u2019s Sanctum!With both lifebound beasts now out, Li Tianming and the little chick just looked inferior from every angle. Twin beastmasters had incredible advantages \u2014 numerical superiority and double beast ki, something Li Tianming lacked.Lin Xiaoxiao, who had entered a combat state, no longer seemed like a young girl but a hardened veteran. Her path here was paved with bodies and violence, the difference between Chen Yao and her. Lightning Manor prized the martial spirit, and even the Lightning Seigneur\u2019s granddaughter had to grow through battle.The Vajra Berserk Ape roared, stomping its foot three times before charging at Li Tianming in a golden blur.The high-tier lightning and berserker-type lifebound beast was the primary combat force on Lin Xiaoxiao\u2019s side. However, that didn\u2019t mean the Tri-Coloured Darkthunder Bird could be ignored either. The threat of it swooping down to deliver a mortal blow existed at any moment.The might of these two beasts gave everyone certain expectations. Whether it was ability or talent, the fifteen year old genius Lin Xiaoxiao was indeed more suitable to bear the title of prime disciple than Li Tianming and represent the institute.As the ape entered battle, its figure swelled up and its power increased. Exceptional melee combat skills was a characteristic of berserk-type beasts. And yet, it was actually Lin Xiaoxiao who presented the most danger right now, because two grade four beastial weapons had appeared in her hands.One was a golden bow with lightning snaking around it, the other a purple arrow. People in the know would recognise them as the Roaring Thunder Bow and Luminous Lightning Arrow.The bow would use yang-type lightning to unleash explosive power, while the arrow infused the arrows with the power of yin-type lightning. The mutual augmentation of yin and yang granted great power. Like lightning, the Luminous Lightning Arrow could pierce an unlucky victim's heart in a single instant, only to be recovered by the bow moments later.Lin Xiaoxiao immediately notched the arrow before pulling it to a full draw.Everyone knew Li Tianming was finished. Li Shufan had lost this way too, to an arrow that had lodged itself in his thigh. If she was aiming for a mortal blow, Li Tianming likely couldn\u2019t avoid it.\u201cBrother, scared?\u201d Li Tianming asked the little chick conversationally.\u201cScared? Psshhhawww, I was born to fight one on two!\u201d Ying Huo said disdainfully.\u201cBig talk.\u201d Li Tianming raised an eyebrow.It was at that moment the ape finally arrived, its sharp claws aimed at Li Tianming\u2019s face. The bird chose this moment to dive down as well, but a streak of purple was the first to close the distance.Before the twang of the bow could arrive, the arrow itself had already arrived at Li Tianming\u2019s chest!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 65": "Chapter 65 - Electric Twined Shot!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLin Xiaoxiao\u2019s Electric Twined Shot was an intermediate source-ranked battle art. Its power was formidable on its own, and it would be further boosted when used together with the Roaring Thunder Bow and the Luminous Lightning Arrow. This was precisely why Lin Xiaoxiao was famous for this killer move of hers!Lin Xiaoxiao was smart. She had the Vajra Berserk Ape, a melee-ranged berserker-type beast to confront the enemy up front, while the Tri-Coloured Darkthunder Bird would distract the enemy with flanks and sudden attacks. Because of that, she could use ranged weapons like a bow to safely deal damage from a distance. The arrow was deadly to a tee, and if it wasn\u2019t because she detested perverts like Li Tianming, she wouldn\u2019t have aimed at his chest.Like lightning, the killing flash streaked towards Li Tianming. The sheer speed of the Luminous Lightning Arrow was sufficient to elicit compliments from the onlookers. It was clear that Lin Xiaoxiao was far stronger than Li Shufan or Chen Yao, and she could probably even defeat opponents of the fourth level Spiritsource. Facing such a terrifying opponent, no one would be surprised if Li Tianming was defeated immediately.A sharp screech pierced through the stadium, and Li Tianming skidded backwards, having taken the blow head on.\u201cIs he dead?\u201d It wasn\u2019t that hard to imagine Li Tianming getting pierced through the heart and dying in that one shot.\u201cNot yet!\u201dBut an incredible sight greeted them. The Luminous Lightning Arrow had been blocked by Li Tianming, the deadly projectile clutched in his left hand!In fact, he had reacted calmly, reaching out and catching the arrow without any fluster. Even though the impact of the arrow had knocked him back, the arrow didn\u2019t even get to touch his torso.\u201cNo way!\u201d Lin Xiaoxiao was stunned by that result. She was clear of the speed and power behind that shot, and catching that would qualify as a miracle. On top of that, the arrow was covered with spikes, and anyone other than her who attempted to even hold it would have his or her palm ripped open by those thorns.But she didn't know that Li Tianming\u2019s left hand was invulnerable. Those spikes on her vaunted arrow were useless against it.She wasn\u2019t alone in asking that, however. Even some of the strongest cultivators in the stadium had the same query as Lin Xiaoxiao. How did he catch that arrow bare handed?\u201cCome back!\u201d Using the Roaring Thunder Bow, Lin Xiaoxiao guided the arrow back towards her. Yin and yang-type lightning were opposites that attract, and she used that particular property to pull the arrow back to her.The power from the attraction was almost about to pull the arrow out of Li Tianming\u2019s hands. But what she didn\u2019t expect was that Li Tianming had grabbed on tight to the arrow, lifting his feet off the ground.The Luminous Lightning Arrow zipped back to her, dragging a stray Li Tianming along with it. The speed of the returning arrow even allowed him to dodge the bird and the ape\u2019s attack!Having realised that their targets were escaping from them, the two lifebound beasts turned back to chase Li Tianming.\u201cYou go deal with that bird,\u201d said Li Tianming.The little chick raised an eyebrow. \u201cYou sure you can fight the two of them?\u201d\u201cWatch.\u201d Li Tianming tossed it out into the air, so as to let it take on the bird for him. Life would be much easier for him when he didn\u2019t have to worry about attacks from above.Li Tianming had his eyes on Lin Xiaoxiao. The Vajra Berserk Ape was fast, golden bolts running through its furs. But when Li Tianming used the Confounding Mirage Walk, he could easily confuse the ape.\u201cReturn me my arrow!\u201d Lin Xiaoxiao was clearly unhappy, her still chubby face blushing red with anger.\u201cHere you go.\u201d Li Tianming was quite close to the girl already, as he held the Luminous Lightning Arrow with both hands and exerted force using his left. The arrow was pretty thin, and he wanted to test how strong a grade four beastial weapon was.With a crack that tugged at one's heartstrings, the Luminous Lightning Arrow snapped into two on the spot!What kind of monstrous strength did it take to break a grade four weapon with his bare-hands? Sure, the arrow was pretty thin, but that didn\u2019t make this feat any less astounding.At that sight, Lin Xiaoxiao\u2019s eyes teared up, ready to fall anytime.\u201cThis was a birthday gift from my elder brother!\u201d If her feelings towards Li Tianming just now was just aversion, it had changed completely to hatred. It was her beloved weapon, and Li Tianming had returned it to her in two pieces.\u201cDon\u2019t cry, I\u2019ll get you another one next time.\u201d Li Tianming could feel his eye twitching. The girl had started crying in the middle of such an intense battle, and he had no idea what to do about it.\u201cIt\u2019s not the same.\u201d Lin Xiaoxiao wiped her tears. She knew that Li Tianming had no idea how important that Luminous Lightning Arrow was to her, but the biting chill in her eyes intensified anyway.For those who knew Lin Xiaoxiao better, they recognised her enraged stance at once. This was a prelude to her foes\u2019 nightmare.\u201cHoo boy, Li Tianming touched Xiaoxiao\u2019s reverse scale. He\u2019s doomed for sure.\u201d\u201cXiaoxiao generally doesn\u2019t injure others too much, but this time, that\u2019s not gonna be the case.\u201dWhile the discussion carried on in the Stadium, the Vajra Berserk Ape and the Tri-Coloured Darkthunder Bird had both sensed their master\u2019s fury. The bird was battling the little chick, while the ape was still looking for every opportunity to pounce onto Li Tianming. The ape\u2019s berserker strength would devastate him utterly, should it land a direct hit.\u201cLi Tianming must still be proud to break the arrow. If he thought Xiaoxiao only knew archery, then he would make a costly mistake.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, as compared to bow and arrows, Xiaoxiao is actually stronger in terms of melee combat. Don\u2019t forget that she has the berserker strength of her Vajra Berserk Ape as well.\u201dAs the audience spoke, Lin Xiaoxiao produced a new beastial weapon. It was a battleaxe that contradicted the aesthetics her image and size created. The battleaxe was gigantic and imposing, its bluish purple body like a dragon with electricity flowing across its body. It was the Voltaic Dragon Battleaxe! It was one of the standard weapons in the Lightning Manor, a hand-me-down from her brother. It was with this battleaxe that he conquered the talents of his time during the ranking test and became the prime disciple. And now, it was in Lin Xiaoxiao\u2019s hands.Although there was something incongruous about a huge battleaxe being used by a petite girl, no one would be stupid enough to doubt her right and her ability to wield it. Furthermore, by her side was the Vajra Berserk Ape.Every second was critical in combat, and the two flying beasts were having their own battle in mid-air, unable to provide any aerial support. On the ground, Lin Xiaoxiao and her ape had leaped up at the same time, the two of them closing in on Li Tianming.\u201cLin Xiaoxiao knows an advanced source-rank battle art known as the Sky-Ripping Three Strikes, and both her lifebound beasts could use the beastial counterpart too. Li Tianming can\u2019t possibly deal with that.\u201dAs expected, the tiny Lin Xiaoxiao leaped through the air with the gigantic battleaxe, striking from above! Powered by her formidable beast ki, the battleaxe tore through the air, drawing a downwards trajectory towards Li Tianming!The Vajra Berserk Ape with the Sky-tearing Three Claws was equally scary. Li Tianming was unaware, but the beast had already used its spiritsource ability, the Vajra Stance. It made the ape\u2019s fur and muscles stronger than steel, rendering it practically indestructible to normal methods.Against the two foes, Li Tianming had only the Thunderfire Chain, a miserable grade three weapon nowhere as threatening as the Voltaic Dragon Battleaxe. But Li Tianming was calm as the sea. His fighting spirit burned stronger than ever, especially since Mu Qingqing was spectating his battle. If he admitted defeat today, how could he gather his will to face even stronger opponents? To become the prime disciple was only a means to an end, and Li Tianming\u2019s real goal for returning to Ignispolis was to take revenge and take back what he had lost! He had already met Mu Qingqing today, and he was finally back on the same playing field as his archenemies, even more qualified than he was three years ago. Vengeance... was it still far away?He had already prepared himself for Lin Xiaoxiao\u2019s attacks. Other than the Aeternal Infernal Beast Ki from his infernal source, Li Tianming had many other trump cards, like the black arm or the Bewildering Eye on his palm.After some trial and error, he found that the Bewildering Eye was way more effective on lifebound beasts or wildbeasts. This was because beasts usually had weaker mental defences, as compared to beastmasters.The Vajra Berserk Ape was already in front of Li Tianming, while Lin Xiaoxiao was still in mid-air, having just leapt from her original position.To be fair, her moves were clean, but that wasn\u2019t enough to win her the battle!\u201cCan the Vajra Berserk Ape take on my seduction?\u201d Li Tianming grinned. The Bewildering Eye might be a dirty trick, but it was just too useful!As the ape\u2019s claw was about to reach Li Tianming, his left palm suddenly opened up. The ape was greeted by a creepy red eye in the center of his palm. Activated by his beast ki, the effects of the Bewildering Eye struck the ape. Having spent time to master the technique, the results showed immediately.With a roar, the Vajra Berserk Ape almost stopped in its tracks, its attack dissolving instantly due to its lack of focus.\u201cDon\u2019t you move!\u201d The next moment, the Thunderfire Chain wound around the ape, and its neck in particular.\u201cCome here!\u201d With a mighty heave, Li Tianming pulled the Vajra Berserk Ape\u2019s colossal body towards his position.This had all happened in a single second, and Lin Xiaoxiao had no idea why her ape would freeze up on the spot, allowing itself to be hit by the chain. Before she could react, Li Tianming had already jerked the body of the ape between the two of them!All this time, she was still in mid-air, and it was too late for her to change the course of her attack. Her target had changed from Li Tianming to her own lifebound beast!The Voltaic Dragon Battleaxe was a powerful weapon, but its drawback was its inflexibility. Once she had launched an attack, it would be difficult to change course, and attempting to do that could even harm herself in the process. But Lin Xiaoxiao had no choice. She had yet to master the berserker style of battling completely, and could only try her best to divert the direction of her battleaxe.\u201cDespicable!\u201d She had no wherewithal to speak, however, and her scream never came out fully. Despite her best efforts, the Voltaic Dragon Battleaxe still landed a direct hit on the ape\u2019s back. Even while it was in Vajra Stance, the strike still managed to tear open a bloody gash on its body!The aped roared loudly in pain as blood spurted out from the wound, painting its golden fur a bloody red. Had Lin Xiaoxiao not tried to control the force of the axe, it would have been decapitated.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 66": "Chapter 66 - And Now, Here I Stand Matchless!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayBecause she had tried to reduce the impact of the battleaxe, Lin Xiaoxiao herself sustained injuries from the backlash of retracting her beast ki.\u201cGrr!\u201d Her inwards shuddered and twisted, and a small fountain of blood erupted from her mouth.\u201cHow did he even do that?\u201d Lin Xiaoxiao\u2019s face paled with shock. However, she was in no position to figure that out, as Li Tianming\u2019s Thunderfire Chain was still wrapped around the Vajra Berserk Ape\u2019s neck. Furthermore, the Vajra Berserk Ape was weakened by Lin Xiaoxiao\u2019s attack, and this was the perfect opportunity for Li Tianming to counterattack!Making sure that the chain was tightly bound to the ape, Li Tianming\u2019s next move horrified the entire stadium. With a swing of his arm, he sent the ape, which was a few times bigger than him, flying into the air and then crashing back into the ground, repeating the process with a vicious grin on his face.\u201cFly! How do you like that, ha!\u201d Minor earthquakes rocked the stadium, and within moments, the ape had slammed into the ground three times, struggling to pull the chain off its neck the whole time!The ape would spin in mid-air, before gravity and Li Tianming\u2019s strength worked together to slam it back down, over and over, creating sonorous thumps everything this happened. It was a terrifying sight to behold.The Vajra Berserk Ape was enraged, but it couldn\u2019t make a noise. Its face was paler than paper, given that the chain was about to strangle it any moment.This was made possible because of Li Tianming\u2019s mastery of the chain. Compared to weapons like the Voltaic Dragon Battleaxe, the Thunderfire Chain was as nimble as a snake, allowing Li Tianming to strike at every single weak point of his opponent.But he had underestimated the beast as well. As it made contact with the ground a third time, a frightening golden bolt erupted from the ape\u2019s body. The bolt quickly traveled through its torso and onto the chain, threatening to electrocute Li Tianming a moment later. It was its spiritsource ability, the Golden Flux! The sheer strength of this move \u2014 enough to put Li Tianming out of commission \u2014 was evident, and Li Tianming hurriedly released his chain right before the bolt could hit him.As for the Vajra Berserk Ape, the Golden Flux clearly took all the strength it had left. Right after letting out the bolt, the ape collapsed completely, clearly on the brink of death. Not only had it suffered considerable blood loss, a good handful of its bones were broken after being swung around by Li Tianming. It was evident that the Vajra Berserk Ape was out of this battle!Li Tianming\u2019s action was astonishing, as he had not only blocked Lin Xiaoxiao\u2019s Sky-Ripping Three Strikes , but also made her injure both the ape and herself. That was enough to turn the tides of the battle.At the same time, the battle of the two flying beasts had reached a climax too! The Tri-Coloured Darkthunder Bird\u2019s Sky-Ripping Three Claws were on par with the little chick\u2019s Netherfire Ghostclaw, and it wasn\u2019t about to lose out in speed too.However, when it used its spiritsource ability, Fusion Wave, to launch a tri-coloured lightning bolt at the little chick, it was greeted with a smirk.\u201cWanna compare your ability with mine?\u201d Ying Huo grinned, as it opened its mouth to spew out a blazing phoenix!The Infernal Blaze charged towards the bird, vaporizing the Fusion Wave in its way and crashed directly onto the Tri-Coloured Darkthunder Bird!Ying Huo laughed. \u201cBurn, you stupid bird!\u201dThe bird screeched as it fell from the sky, engulfed in flame. Its intention was to extinguish the fire by rolling on the floor, but it didn\u2019t know that the Infernal Blaze would burn on forever. Without the little chick\u2019s mercy, it had but one fate \u2014 a fiery death.All of these happened simultaneously as the ape collapsed. Lin Xiaoxiao could only gasp at her two lifebound beasts, one gravely injured and the other spazzing out from the burn.\u201cLI TIANMING!\u201d Lin Xiaoxiao\u2019s face paled even further, knowing that she was at her wits\u2019 end. But she was a warrior of the Lightning Manor, and there was no way she would concede here. Once again, she picked up her Voltaic Dragon Battleaxe and charged at Li Tianming and the little chick, without any help from her lifebound beasts.\u201cThat\u2019s it, just admit defeat now. Don\u2019t let your lifebound beast suffer,\u201d Li Tianming called out. If this persisted, the Tri-Coloured Darkthunder Bird would burn to death. Such was the terror of the little chick\u2019s ability.Lin Xiaoxiao was never his foe to begin with. All Li Tianming needed was the victory, and he didn\u2019t need the girl to pay any price for the crimes that her brother had committed. Three years ago, she was but a twelve year old girl, uninvolved in the incident. She had done well today, even struggling to fight till the end. Looking at the Tri-Coloured Darkthunder Bird being tortured by the Infernal Blaze, Li Tianming thought of Midas. That had hit a soft spot in his heart.\u201cNo! I shall not lose, not to someone like you!\u201d Lin Xiaoxiao stared at him, eyes bloodshot as she dashed towards Li Tianming.Clang! Li Tianming\u2019s Thunderfire Chain was swifter than her battleaxe.\u201cToo young, too naive.\u201d He knew that Lin Xiaoxiao had gone hysterical, and with her injuries, she wasn\u2019t much of a threat. Therefore, his chain shot at the Voltaic Dragon Battleaxe and tore it out of her hands. With a swing, the battleaxe was sent flying out of the arena, landing directly in front of Mu Qingqing! As it slammed into the ground, the faint vibration from the impact even caused Mu Qingqing\u2019s hair to flutter.Having lost her weapon, Lin Xiaoxiao could only face the reality that she could not fight any longer. Looking at her lifebound beasts, their injuries brought tears to her eyes.\u201cI concede.\u201d Her voice was feeble and coarse, as she glared at Li Tianming with teary eyes.\u201cShould have done that earlier. Ying Huo, spare her lifebound beast,\u201d Li Tianming said to the little chick.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, it wouldn\u2019t die. At most it'll be bald for a few months.\u201d The little chick sucked the Infernal Blaze back into its stomach. By then, however, the pretty Tri-Coloured Darkthunder Bird was charred all over. Even if it was prettied up later, it was still going to be featherless for some time.The fight to become the prime disciple was over! There was a clear winner, since one of them had both her lifebound beasts injured and she herself had conceded defeat. The expected winner \u2014 Lin Xiaoxiao \u2014 had lost, causing the whole stadium to fall into a deathly silence. Most of the audience stared mindlessly at Li Tianming and the little chick, who was still strutting around and bragging. Within the Lightning Manor\u2019s private room, Lin Tianjian, Li Yanfeng and Liu Qing were all dumbfounded. And in the Xing & Chen Merchantry\u2019s room, Madam Xue Lan was gritting her teeth.They could be annoyed at him, some even angry about his victory, but now? They could only swallow those sentiments!\u201cHa, who are you all looking down on now!\u201d Li Tianming thought. At this moment, he was the star of the stadium!\u201cI don\u2019t dislike Lin Xiaoxiao, but there\u2019s just so many things I can prove by defeating her! Mu Qingqing, Madam Xue Lan, and Ignispolis! Watch me, for I am back!\u201dThis victory had significant value for Li Tianming, as he was no longer just the laughing stock from three years ago, but also the prime disciple of Flameyellow Scions Institute! It was an identity that couldn\u2019t be ignored, since every single one of the past prime disciples turned out to be the elites of Vermilion Bird!That was just what Li Tianming needed for now. For now, his name will be known by the entire nation, not just because of his past, but also because he was the best disciple in these four years! But Li Tianming wasn\u2019t going to be full of himself, and neither had he forgotten his purpose. He knew that this was just a beginning, and ultimately he would show the world who were the scumbags three years ago!He surveyed the audience, most of which were wearing faces of disappointment and disapproval. It was only natural that most people didn\u2019t support him as the prime disciple. Someone who was overaged and had a stained record just wasn\u2019t worthy of such a prestigious position. Most of the youths his age, such as Chen Hao, Xing Que, Mu Qingqing and Lin Xiaoting had all entered even higher levels, and Li Tianming was but an above average teenager compared to them.Yet, this overaged teenager could make it into Heaven\u2019s Sanctum and enjoy the resources and treatment reserved for the prime disciple! Clearly, the system had its own flaws. But rules were rules, and Li Tianming had topped the test fair and square. No matter how many people might find Lin Xiaoxiao to be a more suitable candidate, they couldn\u2019t alter the result.For Li Tianming, there was something even more important. That was his mother\u2019s pride and joy. He knew that he had done Wei Jing proud with his performance today, and Wei Jing could easily be the happiest person in the stadium right now. And the happier she was, the sulkier Xue Lan would be. Just thinking of Xue Lan\u2019s stinking face made Li Tianming grin.Most importantly, Mu Qingqing had witnessed the entire battle in close proximity. She was fully confident in Lin Xiaoxiao, as she thought the siblings were at levels that Li Tianming could never dream of touching. But now that Li Tianming had made his comeback and easily crushed Lin Xiaoxiao, could Mu Qingqing still stare at him with that indifferent manner?Of course not. Li Tianming caught the look on her face momentarily, and it was an expression of dismay. Her slender fingers gripped on to the side of her dress, and the shade in her eyes reminded him of that fateful night three years ago. But this time, it was mixed with a tinge of disbelief and fear. She didn\u2019t worry about Li Tianming\u2019s current strength, but he would no doubt be a factor of instability in that peaceful life of hers.Seeing that look on Mu Qingqing\u2019s face, Li Tianming smiled in relief. If he could, he would tell her personally, \u201cThis is just the beginning, and I will have plenty of time to deal with you!\u201dThree years ago, they tore Midas\u2019 feathers off, one after another. And now, Li Tianming would shred them up piece by piece, be it their body or their soul!\u201cMidas, just a while more. Just give me some more time, and I will let you rest in peace. I will send you off with their blood!\u201d Li Tianming could feel his urge for vengeance burning stronger than ever.......The result of the battle was justified, and the five hall overseers could also only accept that result. For the Hall of Phoenix\u2019s overseer, Wei Zikun, to have the prime disciple come from his hall was an honour in itself.\u201cAs everyone has seen, the result may be surprising, but there is no doubt to it. Therefore, on behalf of the Flameyellow Scions Institute, I congratulate Li Tianming on being the prime disciple for this year\u2019s ranking test. At the same time, you are now officially a disciple of Heaven\u2019s Sanctum, and you will be continuing your cultivation there.\u201d With Wei Zikun\u2019s announcement, Li Tianming\u2019s victory had been made official.From there, there were still a few more battles to adjust a few minor details. But since the prime disciple had already been decided, not many paid attention to the rest of the battles. The quadrennial ranking test was nearing its end.Lin Xiaoxiao didn\u2019t have time to sulk over her loss. She hurriedly returned her two lifebound beasts back to her lifebound space, where they would rest and gradually heal up.\u201cBig sis Qingqing\u2026\" She was still in disbelief, unable to accept her defeat. It was something that she had never felt before, and she could only seek Mu Qingqing\u2019s comfort. But when she looked up, she saw that the way her sister Qingqing looked at Li Tianming was no longer as calm as it used to be.\u201cXiaoxiao.\u201d Only after a while did she notice Lin Xiaoxiao, and she pulled the young girl over to pat her on the back. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. With the Lightning Manor and your brother, you will end up in Heaven\u2019s Sanctum anyway. It\u2019s just a matter of time. This battle says nothing of your cultivation level, considering that he has a five year advantage over you.\u201d\u201cI know, but to lose to him\u2026 \u201d Lin Xiaoxiao felt like she was useless. She promised to help Mu Qingqing teach Li Tianming a lesson, but it ended up being the exact opposite.\u201cXiaoxiao, there are more important people worth your attention. Even if he defeated you today, he\u2019s not worthy of being your opponent in the future. You need to cast your gaze higher,\u201d Mu Qingqing consoled her.But Mu Qingqing herself didn\u2019t even believe what her own words. Her fingers were still grabbed on to the tip of her dress, and red marks had formed on her hand from her tight grip. Mu Qingqing couldn\u2019t see it for herself, but even the veins of her eyes were swollen with blood.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 67": "Chapter 67 - Wash Your Neck!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayNo one could possibly know what was going on in Mu Qingqing\u2019s mind and just how much she wanted to just kill Li Tianming right now. The Voltaic Dragon Battleaxe that flew to her was by no means a coincidence, but a declaration of war from Li Tianming.\u201cI get it now, big sis Qingqing. He may have defeated me today, but one day I will be so strong he won\u2019t even be able to challenge me.\u201d Lin Xiaoxiao finally found her confidence.\u201cI will look forward to that day.\u201dJust as Lin Xiaoxiao was talking to Mu Qingqing, she saw that annoying person walking towards them. He was already the prime disciple, so what else did he want with her? To rub his victory in her face?Lin Xiaoxiao realised that it was not she who Li Tianming was looking for, as he was staring into Mu Qingqing\u2019s face with a complex expression.It has been three years since he last got this close to Mu Qingqing. She had become more mature, more charming.\u201cWhat are you here for? There\u2019s nothing to brag about for beating a kid five years younger than you,\u201d Mu Qingqing said.\u201cOf course not. I\u2019m just here to see if you will still congratulate me like how you did just now,\u201d replied Li Tianming. She destroyed his life, and then said she was happy that he managed to pick himself back up again? If this also worked, then Li Tianming would love to \u2018be happy for her\u2019 too.Mu Qingqing could of course understand the hidden meanings behind what he had just said.\u201cDo you not know any shame? Big sis Qingqing is kind enough to forgive you for what you have done, and yet you come here to annoy her like a fly! If my brother wasn\u2019t in seclusion, you would have gotten your comeuppance.\u201d Lin Xiaoxiao was the first to flare up. She didn\u2019t know the truth, and therefore, she wouldn\u2019t understand their thoughts either.\u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, I have turned over a new leaf and I\u2019m here to make friends with Qingqing. I just want to ask which part of Heaven\u2019s Sanctum do you live in, so next time I can go and say hi.\u201d Li Tianming was smiling, but his eyes suggested otherwise.\u201cBetter not. I can forgive you, but that doesn\u2019t mean I want to have anything to do with you.\u201d Mu Qingqing\u2019s reply was calm, but it had taken all her strength to contain her murderous intent.\u201cI see, what a shame. I thought I could still compete with Lin Xiaoting,\u201d Li Tianming laughed.\u201cQuit dreaming, you are not worthy!\u201d Lin Xiaoxiao felt like she was going mad. Just how could someone be this shameless!\u201cJust leave us alone. Li Tianming, I hope you know what you are doing. I don\u2019t think people like you can ever change, so you better not go around ruining your life again.\u201d Mu Qingqing was getting uncomfortable with the way Li Tianming was staring at her. It was as if he could read into her mind, and see the things that she wished to hide from the rest of the world.\u201cQingqing, I will remember what you\u2019ve said.\u201d\u201cPlease don\u2019t address me like we are friends.\u201d Mu Qingqing could not tolerate him any longer. It would do her no good to keep talking to this man, but then again, it was her own fault for acting all forgiving towards him in the first place.\u201cHmm and how would you like me to address you? How about\u2026 Bloodflower?\u201d Li Tianming tossed out the phrase at the most unexpected moment!Bloodflower! The instant he said the phrase, he could see Mu Qingqing\u2019s pupils dilating. It was a natural reaction for someone who felt guilty!He knew her well enough, and now he could confirm that the assassin sent to him the night before the ranking battles was hired by Mu Qingqing! Everything made sense now.Li Tianming did not continue the conversation, and just stood there, smiling placidly at Mu Qingqing. As for Mu Qingqing, she knew that he had figured it out.Upon hearing the news of his return, she instantly hired an assassin that nearly took Li Tianming and his mother\u2019s life! Was she heartless? Perhaps sinister? It was more like a mixture of both! She betrayed Li Tianming three years ago, leading to the death of Midas whom he treated like his brother, and now she called a hit on him without hesitation!If it wasn\u2019t for Xue Lan, Li Tianming would have suspected her long ago. But after this conversation, he had came to an conclusion \u2014 this cold-blooded woman was the one behind the assassination!Mu Qingqing knew that Li Tianming had gotten what he wanted, and she didn't intend to waste any more time with him either. Pursing her lips, she turned to Lin Xiaoxiao. \u201cLet\u2019s go, he\u2019s disappointed me enough.\u201d\u201cAlright, be gone with you, Li Tianming. Don\u2019t ever let me see you again!\u201d Lin Xiaoxiao hissed.\u201cBye bye, remember to wash your neck.\u201d As the two turned around, Li Tianming said one last line.Wash your neck? What was he going to do, execute her? Mu Qingqing stopped her steps for a moment as his parting words entered her ear, her body quivering for the smallest of moments.\u201cTake care of yourself.\u201d That was the last thing Mu Qingqing said to him, and she no longer used that magnanimous tone that she had earlier. Her tone was now cold, threatening.It was her warning to Li Tianming. So what if he knew who hired the Bloodflower Chamber? With her current wealth and power, she could easily wipe a peasant out of existence with no one the wiser. She had the Lightning Manor to back her up now, while Li Tianming was no different from three years ago, with no background and no power.With that said, the two of them both knew that the war between them had officially started. From there on, one of them will eventually get the other killed.\u201cBig brother.\u201d Just then, Li Tianming could hear a cheerful chirping from behind his back. The voice was almost magical, relieving Li Tianming of his hatred and cleansing his soul. While he would never forget his revenge, he wouldn\u2019t be engulfed in it to the point of ignoring the other, better things in life.Li Tianming turned around to find Jiang Feiling standing behind him. In fact, the moment he saw her innocent and flawless complexion, he instantly put Mu Qingqing behind. Perhaps many would claim that Mu Qingqing was as beautiful as a white lotus flower, and that few can compare with her in terms of appearances. But when placed beside Jiang Feiling, she no longer looked that flawless.Inside Li Tianming\u2019s heart, Mu Qingqing was like a vial of venom, poisoning him 24 hours a day, while Jiang Feiling was like the sweetest honey, soothing his pain and even acting as an antidote to that poison.\u201cLing\u2019er.\u201d Li Tianming smiled. It was a hearty smile, unlike the cold-blooded sneer that he had been showing Mu Qingqing.\u201cCongrats on becoming the prime disciple! This is the address where Qing\u2019er and I live in Heaven\u2019s Sanctum, once you move in do come by and visit us.\u201d Jiang Feiling put a wrinkly piece of paper on his hand, on which there was a line written elegantly.Li Tianming carefully kept the slip in his pocket. \u201cDefinitely.\u201d\u201cBig brother has really done well today,\u201d Jiang Feiling praised him.\u201cIt\u2019s totally because Ling\u2019er is here to support me, that I have the courage to triumph over my opponents,\u201d Li Tianming claimed seriously.\u201cBlargh!\u201d The little chick fanned itself with its wings, as if it was puking from Li Tianming\u2019s acting.\u201cBig brother Ying Huo did really well too, that fire phoenix was really pretty.\u201d Jiang Feiling smiled.\u201cReally? Cause if you want, I will breathe fire for you anyday, darling.\u201d The little chick was suddenly all lively again.\u201cOh shut it, will you?\u201d Li Tianming forcefully muted the little chick by grabbing on to its beaks. The way Ying Huo tried to struggle out of his hand made Jiang Feiling giggle non-stop.\u201cBig brother, there\u2019s something I would like you to know.\u201d After she was done giggling, she looked at Li Tianming earnestly, her eyes as clear as crystal.\u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d Li Tianming nodded.Jiang Feiling lowered her head slightly. \u201cI\u2019m well aware of what happened three years ago, the thing that happened between you and them.\u201d\u201cDoes Ling\u2019er despise me for what I have done?\u201d Li Tianming asked.\u201cNot that.\u201d She shook her head, \u201cI believe my eyes and my own judgement. When I was attached to big brother, I could listen to your heartbeat, and hear the voice inside your heart.\u201d\u201cI could even see the secret that you have hidden with you for these three years. I could see them bullying you.\u201d Before Jiang Feiling could even finish her sentence, there were tears swelling up in her eyes.Lightning seemed to strike Li Tianming as he stared at Jiang Feiling, flabbergasted. It has been three years. For the first time, other than his own mother, someone had cried for Li Tianming, for the suffering that he had gone through. As her tear dripped onto the ground, he could also feel it rinsing the pain in his heart and nourishing his soul.There was only one thing Li Tianming had to say. He wanted to thank the gods, to praise the heavens, for letting a girl like this appear in his life. Even if the relationship between them didn't turn out to be love and they were only friends, Li Tianming would be happy enough. Other than Wei Jing and his new lifebound beasts, he thought he would never find anyone else in the world who would shed a tear for him. The sound in his heart was not the sound of heartbreak, but the sound of it healing from all the pain he had gone through. From the moment he met her, he thought that there was something special about this girl. It was as if he expected her to be part of her life, even if they had only met for a short period of time. It even felt like she had already accompanied him for millions of years before this.\u201cBig brother, can I give you a hug?\u201d She suddenly raised her head and looked at Li Tianming with teary eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 68": "Chapter 68 - Three Days Later To Heaven\u2019s Sanctum!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLi Tianming never knew that Jiang Feiling had seen so much from that one attachment. That explained why she was so friendly towards him, even making use of her identity as a princess to support and encourage him when he arrived in Ignispolis. She had seen what happened for herself, and that was way clearer than having Li Tianming explain it to her verbally. As a result, she had suddenly become the person that knew him the best.\u201cLet me listen to your heartbeat, and that voice from your heart,\u201d she whispered.\u201cMm.\u201d Li Tianming opened up his arms.He wasn\u2019t going to care about what the others thought. Whether the masses viewed him as shameless, dishonourable or anything else had no bearing on him. From young, his mother had taught him to follow his own beliefs. If he had to please everyone for everything he had done, he would have long died from sheer exhaustion.As such, when he felt the shock and the warmth that this girl had brought to him, he would give up the whole world just to have her in his arms.Li Tianming embraced Jiang Feiling. Just like what she claimed, she laid her ears on Li Tianming\u2019s chest, and listened to his heartbeat. A while later, she smiled, \u201cBig brother, your heart was raging just now , but it's calmed down and sounds much better now.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s because you soothed it.\u201d Li Tianming smiled.\u201cHuh, you sure made harassing Ling\u2019er in public sound pretty. Do you think everyone in the stadium is blind?\u201d Unfortunately, an irritated chirping just had to disturb the ambience now.\u201cDon\u2019t say that, stupid Ying Huo.\u201d Jiang Feiling\u2019s cheeks blushed like a peach. She slowly withdrew herself from Li Tianming\u2019s embrace, but her eyes remained fixated on him.That could only suggest that she cared less about the audience\u2019 opinions than he did. Her world right now only contained the two of them.\u201cNo, no, not like this. Look at that ugly fool of a beastmaster, and look at the handsome, fantastic me. How can a pretty girl like you possibly choose him over me?\u201d The little chick howled in disbelief.\u201cYing Huo, despite your little size, your skin is sure thicker than an elephant.\u201d Li Tianming sneered.The hug was over, but it was a sensation he would never forget. If only it could last forever...The only flaw was that he coincidentally made eye contact with Mu Qingqing. As Mu Qingqing turned her head one last time before leaving the arena, she saw Li Tianming and that legendary beauty of Vermilion Bird hugging together. On top of that, Jiang Feiling was leaning against his chest, clearly enjoying it.Mu Qingqing could feel her eyes on the verge of popping out and smashing into the floor. Li Tianming didn\u2019t need to see it to know how irked she was. She was always one who liked to compare, and ended up choosing Lin Xiaoting over Li Tianming. But now, if she was to compare herself with Jiang Feiling, it was clear that she paled in both looks and position. And yet, Princess Ling was hugging the Li Tianming that she had personally destroyed and abandoned, in front of hundreds of thousands of spectators. What would the world think of their relationship?No matter how she looked at it, Li Tianming was more successful than her at the moment. The impact of defeating Lin Xiaoxiao and becoming the prime disciple was incomparable to hugging Princess Ling in the middle of the stadium. People could still say that he had won the battle using his age advantage, but how would they explain his relationship with Princess Ling? Obviously no one had a clue, and could only look on in shock.As Mu Qingqing\u2019s eyes met Li Tianming\u2019s, he grinned and made a puking motion. Immediately after, Li Tianming turned around to face Jiang Feiling with the brightest smile he had, and completely ignored Mu Qingqing.His meaning was clear: You disgust me!This was but the beginning. Her debts to him were far from being paid, and Li Tianming will hunt her down for that!Mu Qingqing and Lin Xiaoxiao left the stadium without another word, while the audience continued to watch Li Tianming with a variety of emotions. For example, Fang Zhao was now wishing for a hole to appear beside him, so he could jump into it and never come out again.As for the rest of the disciples, their feelings turned from abhorrence to envy. They couldn\u2019t understand why Princess Ling would be so close to scumbags like him, but there was nothing they could do but curse in their mind. After all, none of them were qualified to judge the princess\u2019s actions.Even from within the private rooms, many sighed from disbelief or envy. Li Tianming had shocked them all today. Furthermore, the two youngsters were still chatting atop the arena, as Li Tianming joked with Princess Ling and she giggled along.\u201cLing\u2019er, you must be mad!\u201d Just then, a blue figure zoomed up the arena and inserted herself in between the two. She was none other than the fuming Princess Qing.She stared at Jiang Feiling. \u201cYou must be crazy, letting the farmer do this to you in front of the public!\u201d\u201cBut I liked it.\u201d Jiang Feiling smiled, her expression making it impossible to be angry at her.\u201cHey, do you remember your promise to me, Princess Qing? Don\u2019t tell me you are going to break your promise,\u201d Li Tianming said.\u201cShut up, pervert! Scram!\u201d Princess Qing snapped.\u201cSurely a princess wouldn\u2019t back off from her promise, right?\u201d Li Tianming taunted.\u201cAlright, Qing\u2019er, calm down. We shall leave first, big brother, do remember to find us in Heaven\u2019s Sanctum.\u201d Jiang Feiling grabbed on to Jiang Qingluan to stop her from raging.\u201cI will break your leg if you dare to!\u201d Princess Qing warned.\u201cHa.\u201d Li Tianming was too lazy to waste his time with her. A promise was a promise, and she had agreed to them meeting personally.\u201cLook at you, it\u2019s not like you are equipped with the right tool to marry Ling\u2019er. What good does it do to you to split up these two lovebirds?\u201d The little chick rolled its eyes.\u201cShut up! I shall not let this notorious hooligan harm Ling\u2019er\u2019s reputation.\u201d Princess Qing glared at them as she dragged a helpless Jiang Feiling along with her off the stage. But as they left, Jiang Feiling managed to throw a wink at Li Tianming. He believed that she would find ways to deal with Qing\u2019er, considering that they were closer than real sisters.As they left, Li Tianming was summoned by Wei Zikun.\u201cLi Tianming, you have three days to rest, after which I will bring you into Heaven\u2019s Sanctum. To become a member of the sanctum, you will have to follow a \u2018supernal mentor\u2019. Make use of these few days to ask Mu Wan about the different mentors there.\u201d\u201cYes, hall overseer.\u201d With that, Li Tianming left the arena, as there were still other battles taking place.Heaven\u2019s Sanctum was the heart and the sacred place of the institute, and it worked in a very different way as compared to the institute. In the institute, the disciples joined classes led by chief mentors, and generally they would graduate after twelve years of cultivation. From there, they would leave the institute and serve the nation.But one simply doesn\u2019t graduate from Heaven's Sanctum. It was the core structure of the entire Flameyellow Scions Institute, and technically all the chief mentors were part of it. Within Heaven\u2019s Sanctum, those in charge of guiding the disciples were known as the supernal mentors. They were stronger than the chief mentors, and had greater responsibilities. A supernal mentor\u2019s position could easily surpass that of a governor\u2019s, and each of them was well-known in Vermilion Bird.Inside the sanctum, supernal mentors would personally accept and guide their disciples. In fact, each supernal mentor had less than ten disciples. Therefore, one of the most important aspects to cultivating in the sanctum was to pick a supernal mentor that was suitable. Each mentor had a different personality, different teaching style, and even the type of their lifebound beast would make a significant difference.\u201cUsually the prime disciple will be highly sought after by the supernal mentors once they enter the sanctum. But your case is a little\u2026 different. You are much older, and not exactly talented. You better keep a low-profile once you get in, and make sure you don\u2019t piss off any of the mentors there. If not, you better be ready to come back to my Muwan class and remain a joke there.\u201d Mu Wan suddenly popped up from a corner, and explained to Li Tianming.\u201cFor real?\u201d Li Tianming didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or to cry. Even after working this hard to become the prime disciple, he still had the risk of not being able to make it into the sanctum.But he found the rules understandable. Since the supernal mentors would pick their disciples directly, they would never pick those that they didn\u2019t see potential in. Otherwise, it would be their own reputations at stake. If Lin Xiaoxiao was the prime disciple, they would probably fight over her, since real talents like her were bound to have a bright future.In short, it boiled down to how he appealed to the supernal mentors three days later.\u201cChief mentor, how do you feel about me beating Chen Yao and Lin Xiaoxiao?\u201d Li Tianming asked, remembering how she said there was no way he could win.\u201cThat was to encourage you to perform better, you must learn to appreciate how much your chief mentor loves you.\u201d Mu Wan pouted, but that was just a lie. She was just as shocked as the rest of the audience, having realised that Li Tianming was a changed man.\u201cAnd exactly how much is that?\u201d The little chick interrupted.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 69": "Chapter 69 - The Treasure of My Life!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cHmmm, interested in finding out?\u201d Mu Wan answered the little chick\u2019s question with a sinister smile. Terrified, Ying Huo jumped back into Li Tianming\u2019s lap.\u201cWhat do you know about the supernal mentors? Any target in mind right now?\u201d Mu Wan turned to ask Li Tianming.\u201cNot as for now. I don\u2019t know anyone there.\u201dMu Wan threw him a wink. \u201cHmm, how about you come to my room tonight, and I\u2019ll tell you all about it.\u201d\u201cChief mentor, surely it\u2019s not appropriate if the two of us meet in your room at night, right?\u201d Li Tianming asked cautiously.\u201cOf course it\u2019s appropriate. Plus, I\u2019m really interested in what\u2019s so special about you that can make even that Princess Ling hug you.\u201d Mu Wan tilted her head. Li Tianming knew that wasn\u2019t a good sign.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not gonna eat you.\u201d She smiled dubiously, casting another layer of suspicion on her.\u201cChief mentor, I have to send my mother back home first and spend some time with her. Do you mind if I find you the night after\u2026\u201d Li Tianming asked sheepishly. He had to meet Mu Wan at least once, and there was no escape from this\u2026\u201cSure, I can take my time with you.\u201d Mu Wan continued to tease him.That being said, Li Tianming wasn\u2019t going to fall for that. He wasn\u2019t narcissistic enough to think that the goddess of the Hall of Phoenix, the woman that even the overseer sought, would be charmed by him. Chances were that if he ended up believing what Mu Wan said, he would only be bullied even harder.......All in all, the test was over, with him achieving everything that he could possibly desire. Li Tianming was brimming with joy, and of course the first thing he thought of was to share the moment with his mother!Li Tianming parted with Chief Mentor Mu Wan, heading towards the spectator stands. There were still a few battles going on, but the audience was on the verge of leaving.Finally, he saw her. Dusk was at hand, with the setting sun dyeing her pale white hair a brilliant orange. The light also made the wrinkles on her face more obvious, but that didn\u2019t hide the bright, blissful smile on her face.\u201cMother!\u201d Li Tianming bounced towards her, embracing his mother and spinning her around in his excitement.The little chick joined in. \u201cI want to hug mom too!\u201d\u201cHaha\u2026\u201d Wei Jing held Li Tianming shakily with one hand, Ying Huo with the other. She was smiling, but visible tears were forming at the corners of her eyes.\u201cMother, it\u2019s ok for you to be touched by my performance, but there\u2019s no need to cry,\u201d said Li Tianming.\u201cWho told you I was about to cry?\u201d Wei Jing was a little embarrassed.\u201cWell given your son\u2019s outstanding results, it\u2019s perfectly normal for you to be so touched to the point of shedding tears of joy,\u201d Li Tianming bragged.\u201cAnd what makes you think I\u2019m touched? In fact, I\u2019m very disappointed in you right now,\u201d Wei Jing rebutted with a straight face.\u201cWhat? What else could I have done better today?\u201d asked Li Tianming.\u201cI\u2019m not talking about the test, I\u2019m talking about Princess Ling. Tell me, since when did you find such a good girl without me knowing?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not confirmed yet, things are just getting started.\u201d Li Tianming didn\u2019t know whether he should laugh or to cry about that.\u201cReally? You better keep me updated if there\u2019s any progress.\u201d In the end, Wei Jing still wasn\u2019t able to control her tears.Li Tianming smiled. \u201cDefinitely. I will bring her to you one day.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s more like it.\u201d Wei Jing cheered up instantly.\u201cMom, forget about this blockhead who has zero ideas on how to pick up girls. You\u2019ll be better off expecting a grandson from me soon.\u201d The little chick chuckled, making the little family laugh even harder.Just then, a very different group happened to walk past, a callback to how both parties had crossed paths at the start of the ranking test. It was none other than Xue Lan\u2019s group, which had quite a number of people there. Other than Xing Que, Chen Hao and Chen Yao, Madam Yuan Yu of the Xing Mansion was accompanying them too.Xue Lan and Yuan Yu were leading the group with sullen faces, and no one made a sound. Their mood only worsened when they saw Wei Jing and Li Tianming laughing at one side. Xue Lan\u2019s face twitched violently, almost shaking off the layer of make-up powder that she used. Not only had Li Tianming defeated Chen Yao to become the prime disciple, he was even unnaturally close with Princess Ling. That was enough to suggest his superiority over those two sons of hers. Simply thinking of how she was now eating her words made her fume.As they walked past, the two disciples of Heaven\u2019s Sanctum, Chen Hao and Xing Que, stopped in their tracks and glared at Li Tianming.Chen Yao gritted his teeth. \u201cBrothers, take revenge for me. I want him to beg for mercy at my feet.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s bound to happen once he enters the sanctum. He is the same age as us, and his age advantage will disappear completely there. That\u2019s when we can slowly deal with him,\u201d said Chen Hao.\u201cRest assured, younger brother, that scum only got to where he is today by bullying those younger than him. Once he enters the sanctum, he\u2019ll definitely be the weakest.\u201d\u201cMother, let me have a moment with them,\u201d Chen Hao suddenly said.\u201cWhat for?\u201d\u201cSit back and watch.\u201d Chen Hao glanced at Xing Que, and the two of them approached Li Tianming.\u201cLi Tianming.\u201d Chen Hao stopped in front of Li Tianming, his posture hinting out that he was the true elite of their batch.\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d\u201cJust asking, is this your mother?\u201d Chen Hao smiled, only to be greeted by Li Tianming\u2019s frown.Chen Hao snickered. \u201cSeems like it, though she looks way more like your grandma.\u201d\u201cIf you have nothing else to say, please get lost.\u201d Li Tianming glanced behind him, his eyes fixating on how those two ladies were watching.\u201cNo, no, I have good stuff for you actually. Do you know where block 187 of the Ignihills Street is?\u201d Chen Hao asked.Li Tianming was silent.\u201cYou will find a coffin shop owned by Xing & Chen Merchantry there. I think your mother needs one soon, so I decided to gift you one to congratulate you on your victory today. Once you get there, just mention your name and they will bring out the best coffin they have there. After all, you won\u2019t want to end up dumping her body on the street, right?\u201d As he finished, he and Xing Que began to laugh. Even Xue Lan smirked at the joke, dispelling that sullen mood she had.\u201cHow could you say such a thing?\u201d Auntie Li mumbled, displeased with what he had said.\u201cShut up, lowly servant.\u201d Xing Que flared up immediately, aiming a slap at her.Pah!Thankfully, Li Tianming was fast enough to block that slap with his left arm, or it would have easily killed Auntie Li. Xing Que was near the peak of Spiritsource, and he was far stronger than Li Tianming. Even if Xing Que had not used much of his strength, Li Tianming had to back off a few steps after taking the hit with his black arm. He could even feel pain travelling up his shoulder.What Li Tianming didn\u2019t know was that Xing Que was in fact far more surprised than he was. Hitting Li Tianming\u2019s arm was like slapping a chunk of steel, and even his own palm was smarting from that.\u201cChen Hao, Xing Que, let\u2019s go.\u201d Madam Xue Lan held her head up like an arrogant rooster.\u201cMore surprises will await you in the sanctum once you get there. You will soon find out that making enemies with the Xing and Chen clans is the worst mistake you will ever make.\u201d With one last threat, the brothers turned around to leave.Li Tianming remained silent. There was no point arguing with them, and his mother did not want to have anything to do with those people either. Time would prove the real victor. If he could crush Chen Yao today, then it wouldn\u2019t be long before he could catch up with those of his age. Mu Qingqing, Chen Hao, Xing Que and even Lin Xiaoting were all his targets.\u201cMother, don\u2019t waste your time on them,\u201d Li Tianming said. It was quite a lowly move from their side, insulting Wei Jing on her strange illness.\u201cI\u2019m not angry, I\u2019m just sad that so much has changed. Not many things could withstand the test of time.\u201d Wei Jing sighed. The Lan\u2019er that she knew and loved and the Madam Xue Lan of today were already two completely different people.Auntie Li sighed.\u201cMadam is right. We average citizens have it much worse, and life has been tough for me too.\u201d\u201cThank you for all that you have done for us,\u201d said Wei Jing.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, we are all in the same boat now. It\u2019s difficult for people like me to just stay alive, and I\u2019m lucky enough to meet madam and young master.\u201d Auntie Li said sincerely, \u201cI pray that young master makes a name for himself, and madam lives a long and prosperous life. Surely the heavens will reward kind people like you.\u201dShe herself was very aware that she had nearly died just now.Li Tianming took Wei Jing onto his back. It was time for them to leave the stadium too.\u201cMother, now that I have gotten into Heaven\u2019s Sanctum, you have to tell me who can help you with your Lifesbane,\u201d Li Tianming said earnestly, having noticed that Wei Jing was still hesitant about it.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, no matter what stands in our way, no matter how hard it will be, I promise you that I will do it. I, Li Tianming, promise you that even if I can\u2019t cure your Lifesbane, you will not die alone.\u201d Li Tianming would stay true to every word he had said.\u201cAlright, I will tell you once we get back.\u201d With such a vow, Wei Jing was unable to reject him. After all, he had lived up to his words, and became the prime disciple! She put her arms around Li Tianming\u2019s shoulders, and leaned on his back.\u201cMing\u2019er, you really have grown up. I\u2019m\u2026 just so proud of you. My life was not a fortunate one, but you have always been the greatest treasure in my entire life.\u201d As Wei Jing said this, Li Tianming could feel tears dripping onto his ears.\u201cDon\u2019t say that, there\u2019s so many things wrong with that sentence,\u201d Li Tianming stood still and said seriously.\u201cWhy?\u201d Wei Jing tried her best to hold back her tears.\u201cYour life will be a fortunate one, as you still have many, many years ahead of you.\u201d She couldn\u2019t see Li Tianming\u2019s expression from her angle, but she could sense his determination.\u201cAlright.\u201d She could barely control her emotions. She cried not because of her misfortune, but because she realised that the gods had blessed her with the greatest fortune she could ever hope for, her son.\u201cLife may be tough, but there are always things to look forward to in this world.\u201d\u201cTianming, mother doesn\u2019t want to die. I want to see you start your family, to see you prosper and succeed, and to see you take your revenge and fight for what you have lost. Tianming, I\u2026 I don\u2019t want to die!\u201d She could no longer hold back her tears, and they began to flow down Li Tianming\u2019s neck in earnest.Li Tianming stood still on the spot, letting the tears slide down his skin. He could feel the cold tingling sensation of the beads, and it ignited an even stronger determination in him. Without another word, he readjusted Wei Jing so that she was comfortable, and continued forth on their journey!From here on out, nothing could stop him!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 70": "Chapter 70 - GrandfatherPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe prime disciple\u2019s name, \u2018Li Tianming\u2019, spread to every corner of Ignispolis, throwing it into an uproar and even shook the whole country. He was now a household name.He was definitely a hot conversation topic, given his special identity and the incident three years ago.However, whether it was to praise or curse him differed for every individual.The only constant was a sense of pity for Lin Xiaoxiao, who was truly suited to be the prime disciple in both age or talent.By evening, petitions to revise the rules of the ranking battle had made their way to Flameyellow Scions Institute. They didn\u2019t want a similar incident to happen again, where a genius would feel resentment and a fake genius would receive benefits. Only time would tell whether the petition passed.The commotion in the day finally died down by nighttime.Now that he had accomplished his first goal of joining Heaven\u2019s Sanctum, Li Tianming got Auntie Li to prepare a scrumptious feast. They gorged themselves on the meal, enjoying the peace and happiness.Whenever Wei Jing had mobility issues, Li Tianming would personally feed her.\u201cWhen you were young, you were a picky eater and I had to feed you. Now the places have switched,\u201d Wei Jing said, touched.After the meal, Auntie Li kept the dishes while Li Tianming brought his mother to the courtyard. The night sky tonight was particularly beautiful, the stars lined up in a beautiful river. Fire seemed to burn within the river of stars, dying it a faint red.Li Tianming had finally reached the point where his mother was willing to talk about the past. \u201cTell me, how I can help you remove the Lifesbane?\u201dLi Tianming sat on the stairs next to her, his eyes shining like the stars.As for the little chick, it had eaten its fill and was currently burping as it watched them from the roof.Now, Li Tianming was at his second goal \u2014 to extend his mother\u2019s longevity and return her youth. It wasn\u2019t just any pressing matter; it was the most important matter in his life!He thought of Xue Lan and her sons\u2019 mockery of his mother\u2019s state, his mind replaying their words of delivering a coffin to him. He thought of Wei Jing telling him that she didn\u2019t want to die.Wei Jing sat on her chair and looked at the stars. \u201cOnly one person can remove my Lifesbane in Heaven\u2019s Sanctum. And even for him, it\u2019s an exhausting matter. It has lurked in my body for twenty years, so it\u2019s deeply rooted in my body now.\u201d\u201cWho is it?\u201d Li Tianming asked.\u201cHe\u2019s the Sanctum Potentate of Heaven\u2019s Sanctum, the master of Flameyellow Scions Institute.\u201d Wei Jing\u2019s expression turned complicated.\u201cThat can\u2019t be. Shouldn\u2019t the chancellor be the controller of the institute?\u201d Li Tianming asked doubtfully.\u201cYou don\u2019t know this, but actually, the Sanctum doesn\u2019t belong to the institute, but rather, controls it. That\u2019s why the Sanctum Potentate is higher than the institute's chancellor in status and authority,\u201d Wei Jing said.\u201cI see\u2026\u201dThe Potentate had always been a mysterious figure. The chancellor was always the public face of the institute, so Li Tianming didn\u2019t know this relationship.\u201cMother, you mean it\u2019ll be hard to get this potentate guy to help because it\u2019s too exhausting for him?\u201d\u201cNo, that\u2019s not it.\u201d Wei Jing lowered her head, a bitter smile on her face. \u201cThere\u2019s another reason.\u201d\u201cWhat, you offended him?\u201d\u201cThe reason is that I was once the potentate\u2019s daughter. Furthermore, I offended him, and very severely at that.\u201d Wei Jing lifted her head, looking helplessly at Li Tianming.\u201cWhat?\u201d Li Tianming thought he had misheard. She was the Sanctum Potentate\u2019s daughter. Didn\u2019t that mean the person currently in control of Flameyellow Scions Institute and Heaven\u2019s Sanctum was his grandfather? He had speculated that Wei Jing had some family background in Ignispolis, but this was a tad ridiculous.\u201cThat was once upon a time. I was disowned twenty years ago and our relationship ended. That\u2019s why he can remove the Lifesbane \u2014 I inherited it from him.\u201d Wei Jing spoke of these old matters with a light smile, but the smile was filled with some bitterness.\u201cWhat made him so angry with you?\u201d Li Tianming asked.\u201cI was pregnant, but he didn\u2019t like Li Yanfeng,\u201d Wei Jing said frankly.\u201c...\u201d Li Tianming could only say that was life. If she had known that Li Yanfeng would abandon them twenty years later, would she have made that choice?\u201cDo you think I reaped what I sowed?\u201d Wei Jing asked.\u201cHow could that be? If so, I wouldn\u2019t be alive now,\u201d Li Tianming said. Wei Jing wouldn\u2019t have had to marry Li Yanfeng if she wasn\u2019t pregnant, and the potentate probably wouldn\u2019t have been so furious that he disowned her. Furthermore, they had seen neither hide nor hair of him in these twenty years.For the potentate to be this heartless with his own daughter showed how furious he was.Li Tianming didn\u2019t know the full story. However, he could infer from the bits and pieces he had about how severe a crime Wei Jing had committed.And to save her, Li Tianming definitely had to face this grandfather who had been so heartless then. The difficulty was obvious.\u201cI told you someone in Heaven\u2019s Sanctum could save me primarily to give you hope, to motivate you. However, you now know he dislikes me more than anyone else. Seeing me in this state will only make him happy. Let\u2019s not mention the Lifesbane. If he knows I\u2019m here, he\u2019ll probably try to expel me from Ignispolis so that I don\u2019t embarrass him. Just like Li Yanfeng, he places high importance on his face,\u201d Wei Jing said helplessly.\u201cSo what now?\u201d Li Tianming asked.\u201cNow just cultivate in Heaven\u2019s Sanctum.\u201d Wei Jing grabbed his hand and looked gently at him. \u201cChild, believe me. There\u2019s no chance.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t believe it.\u201d Li Tianming pulled his hand out and smiled, \u201cWhy so serious? Let me give it a shot. I\u2019m the kind of person who won\u2019t regret it even if I smash my head against something and it bleeds.\u201d\u201cMing\u2019er\u2026\u201d Wei Jing\u2019s eyes turned misty. \u201cIt\u2019s hard on you, being my son.\u201d\u201cAlright, enough with the exaggerating of how hard it is. Tell me, how do I meet this Sanctum Potentate?\u201d\u201cHeaven\u2019s Sanctum has a \u2018Wei Manor\u2019 inside, but an ordinary Heaven\u2019s Sanctum disciple can\u2019t enter.\u201d\u201cThen who can?\u201dWei Jing considered it. \u201cWhen you seek out a supernal mentor in two days, try getting \u2018Mu Yang\u2019 if possible. If he accepts you, you can tell him my circumstances and that you\u2019re Wei Jing\u2019s son. He might be able to bring you to the Potentate.\u201dLi Tianming finally had a lead. \u201cI\u2019ll remember the name.\u201d\u201cThis Mu Yang wouldn\u2019t happen to be another admirer of yours, would he?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t talk drivel,\u201d Wei Jing said anxiously.\u201cLook at how antsy you are. I knew it, my mom used to be a super beauty in Ignispolis.\u201d Li Tianming smiled, trying to lighten Wei Jing\u2019s mood.\u201cWait. You said \u2018another admirer\u2019. What did \u2018another\u2019 mean?\u201d Wei Jing suddenly stared at Li Tianming.Li Tianming had said that because he had met Sage Chen.\u201cHaha\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t give that dumb laughter. Explain, who did you meet?\u201dUnder her harassment, Li Tianming could only sell out Sage Chen.\u201cDon\u2019t meet him again. He\u2019s Xue Lan\u2019s husband,\u201d Wei Jing said.\u201cOkay. Still, do you have to be considerate for her sake?\u201d Li Tianming felt nauseated when he thought of that woman.\u201cHow others act or think should have no bearing on my own actions and thoughts,\u201d Wei Jing replied seriously.Li Tianming agreed. Unfortunately, the other party was clearly longing for Wei Jing\u2019s death.His mother had been gone from Ignispolis for very long and hence knew little about this Mu Yang right now.Before joining Heaven\u2019s Sanctum, Li Tianming had to make a trip to chief mentor Mu Wan\u2019s residence to get an understanding of all the supernal mentors. Hence, on a dark and stormy night, he made his way to Mu Wan...His only hope was to maintain his personal integrity that night.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 71": "Chapter 71 - The Future PotentatePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cChief Mentor Mu Wan, it\u2019s Li Tianming. I\u2019m here.\u201d\u201cChief mentor, are you there? I\u2019ll be heading over to the sanctum tomorrow, and I\u2019m here to ask you about the various supernal mentors.\u201d Li Tianming continued to knock on the door, but there was no reaction.However, the candles were lit, suggesting that the owner should be at home. After a moment of waiting without any response, Li Tianming decided to push open the gate and step in. He couldn\u2019t afford to head to the sanctum tomorrow without any intel.As he walked across the courtyard, he could hear the sound of water flowing from one of the side-chambers. Apparently, Mu Wan was showering \u2014 and with that, Li Tianming decided to wait in the courtyard.It didn\u2019t take long before the door of the side-chamber creaked open, and a slender figure dressed in a flimsy bathrobe walked out. Doused in moonlight, Mu Wan\u2019s rosy skin and wet hair gave off the charm unique to women of her age. Li Tianming wasn\u2019t going to lose to his desires. Hurriedly turning his head away, he asked, \u201cChief mentor, I\u2019m here to enquire about the supernal mentors.\u201d\u201cFire away.\u201d To Li Tianming\u2019s shock, she walked towards him in her bathrobes. He could already smell the faint fragrance before she even reached him.\u201cChief mentor, how about I come back later?\u201d Li Tianming said nervously.\u201cWhat for? What a coward you are, unlike me. I look at whatever I please.\u201d The little chick had poked its little head out of his chest pocket, its eyes glued to Mu Wan.\u201cThat\u2019s right. Man up, Li Tianming. I\u2019m not gonna eat you.\u201d Mu Wan seated herself beside him and grabbed Ying Huo, fiddling with it.\u201cRespect me, woman.\u201d Ying Huo held its head up.A gleam appeared in Mu Wan\u2019s eyes. \u201cWhat a cute little thing.\u201dThe little chick grinned. \u201cChief mentor, Li Tianming once mentioned to me that he wanted to ahem with you, it\u2019s just that he doesn\u2019t have the balls to.\u201d\u201cYou twat!\u201d Li Tianming snatched the little chick back from her and stuffed it back into his lifebound space.\u201cDid you really think that?\u201d Only when he was done with the little chick did Li Tianming realise Mu Wan was staring at him with her eyebrow raised.\u201cNo, I\u2019m a righteous person, and it\u2019s not like me to...\u201d Li Tianming tried to explain.\u201cMust a righteous person abstain from that?\u201d\u201c...\u201d\u201cAlright, I\u2019m done joking. Give me a while.\u201d She stood up and headed towards another room. A while later, she reemerged, properly dressed this time round, and Li Tianming found himself now at ease.\u201cThose people must be blind, to think that such an innocent, pure boy like you would drug others,\u201d Mu Wan exclaimed. While being called innocent didn\u2019t exactly sound like praise, Mu Wan had at least figured out the truth and was willing to trust him.\u201cI saw Mu Qingqing\u2019s expression when you became the prime disciple today. She must be really good at acting pure and benevolent, considering how vicious she actually is. How lucky are you to meet a girl like that.\u201d Mu Wan patted his back, sitting beside him with her legs crossed.\u201cToo bad not enough people know about this side of her,\u201d Li Tianming said.\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m looking forward to the show you intend to put on. Just remember to treasure your own life,\u201d Mu Wan reminded him.\u201cThank you, chief mentor.\u201d\u201cHere is a list of the eighteen supernal mentors. Just take a brief look, because I don\u2019t think any of them will actually be interested in you.\u201d Mu Wan gave him a pitiful look.\u201cWhat do you mean, chief mentor?\u201d\u201cWei Zikun has been asking around, but he told me that not a single one of them wanted to accept you as their disciple so far. Chances are, things will be awkward for you tomorrow.\u201d Mu Wan smiled. \u201cFor the first time in the Flameyellow Scions Institute\u2019s history, a prime disciple will be chased back to the institute because no one from the sanctum will be willing to accept you. Congratulations on making history yet again.\u201dLi Tianming rolled his eyes. \u201cThen it sucks to be the supernal mentors for losing an unprecedented genius.\u201d\u201cConfident, hmm?\u201d\u201cOf course, I\u2019m chief mentor\u2019s disciple after all.\u201d Li Tianming smiled, flipping through the name list.\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, it just means that you are fated to be under me. Let me put it bluntly. If no one is willing to accept you, just come back and be my disciple. I will make sure I give you whatever resources I get, and make sure you enjoy a prime disciple\u2019s treatment. And when I become a supernal mentor two years later, I will bring you into the sanctum with me.\u201d Mu Wan suddenly changed to a more serious tone.\u201cFor real?\u201d Li Tianming looked up at her.\u201cDo I sound like the joking type?\u201d Mu Wan looked genuinely surprised.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Definitely, because she was the type who never stopped joking around. But this time, Li Tianming could hear the sincerity in her voice. She valued his talents, and more importantly she wanted to help him fight the injustice he had shouldered.\u201cThank you, chief mentor,\u201d Li Tianming said sincerely.\u201cNo problem. After all, I\u2019m interested in that youthful, vigorous body of yours.\u201d Mu Wan licked her bright red lips.\u201cIs that so? That means I have to end up sacrificing myself unwillingly to my chief mentor in order to cultivate here,\u201d Li Tianming said.\u201cQuit it, you little fox, hurry up and read the list!\u201d Mu Wan gently pulled his ears and let out a laugh.Li Tianming took a brief scan at the eighteen names and the short introductions about them.\u201cWho is Mu Qingqing\u2019s supernal mentor?\u201d Li Tianming asked.\u201cLiu Xueyao, a shameless old bitch. Makes a perfect duo with Mu Qingqing with her acting.\u201d Mu Wan rolled her eyes with displeasure.\u201cWhy do you dislike her so much? Is she perhaps prettier than you?\u201d\u201cBullshit, she can be ten times more beautiful than she already is and she still won\u2019t compare with me,\u201d Mu Wan replied, a proud smile on her face.Li Tianming just laughed it off and continued reading. As he flipped across the pages, he furrowed his brows and asked, \u201cChief mentor, is there perhaps someone you have missed out on this list?\u201d\u201cImpossible. All eighteen of them are on this list. I compiled it carefully for you personally,\u201d Mu Wan said. That was quite evident, from the line scribbled under Liu Xueyao\u2019s name: Ugly old hag, don\u2019t be her disciple.\u201cBut there\u2019s someone that\u2019s not here,\u201d Li Tianming replied.\u201cWho?\u201dLi Tianming looked at her. \u201cMu Yang.\u201dMu Wan stared at him for a while, before pinching his face with a grin. \u201cLittle idiot, where did you hear that name from?.\u201d\u201cChief mentor, what\u2019s that supposed to mean? Is there not a supernal mentor named Mu Yang?\u201d\u201cYeah yeah, but my elder brother is the vice-potentate now. In another three years, he will be made Sanctum Potentate. He stopped accepting new disciples a year ago after the current potentate announced him as the next leader of the Sanctum.\u201d\u201cMu Yang? Elder brother? Vice-potentate?\u201d Li Tianming couldn\u2019t process the amount of information in the sentence.\u201cAre you dumb? The whole Flameyellow Scions Institute only has two people with the surname Mu. If he wasn\u2019t my elder brother, then what could he be, my father?\u201d Mu Wan rolled her eyes.\u201cSo chief mentor has such a background, no wonder you dare to be so haughty in the institute\u2026\u201d Li Tianming found out the reason why even Wei Zikun had to be cautious around her when pursuing her \u2014 she had such an influential brother. Now that she mentioned it, Li Tianming remembered that Wei Jing seemed to have reacted to Mu Wan\u2019s name as well. Perhaps they knew each other.\u201cWhat do you mean, calling the kind and soft-hearted me \u2018haughty\u2019?\u201d\u201cOops, my tongue slipped,\u201d Li Tianming replied. He reckoned that even Wei Jing didn\u2019t expect this Mu Yang to be appointed as the vice-Potentate, and that he was the next Sanctum Potentate as appointed by his grandfather. Now what?\u201cChief mentor, any chance I can still get him to accept me as his disciple? Can you, perhaps do me a favor and beg him or something?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t even think about it, I can knock my head onto the ground and he won\u2019t buy that.\u201d Mu Wan shut him down on the spot.That gave Li Tianming a headache. If he couldn\u2019t be Mu Yang\u2019s disciple, then meeting the Sanctum Potentate would be near impossible, not to mention that Wei Jing was running out of time. If he had no other choices, he might have to admit to Mu Wan that he was Wei Jing\u2019s son, and hope that she would pass this message to Mu Yang.If he failed to become Mu Yang\u2019s disciple and was abandoned by all the supernal mentors, he could only end up as Mu Wan\u2019s disciple. While that may still carry some hope, the best option was still to get into the sanctum. No matter which supernal mentor accepted him, he could at least move freely in the sanctum. If not, it would be pointless for him to become the prime disciple.\u201cForget about my brother, he only has three disciples, and any of them could be the next potentate after him. The requirements to become his disciple is incredibly hard, and he even rejected the chancellor\u2019s son,\u201d Mu Wan added.\u201cOh.\u201d Li Tianming figured out how difficult it was. He simply didn\u2019t expect Mu Yang to be doing so well.\u201cOh, you probably know his third disciple too.\u201d Mu Wan grinned mischievously.\u201cWho?\u201d\u201cLin Xiaoting.\u201dLi Tianming had expected that. Ever since he obtained the Saintbeast War-Soul, Lin Xiaoting\u2019s cultivation had rocketed, and it was only normal that he received the future Sanctum Potentate\u2019s attention! He was the brightest star of their generation, and that was only made possible by the Saintbeast War-Soul!Tomorrow was the day Li Tianming would find a mentor, and he still had no idea how things would turn out.\u201cI can only give you a few recommendations. If you perform well tomorrow, there\u2019s a chance they might still accept you.\u201d Mu Wan also couldn\u2019t do anything else for him.Li Tianming remembered those names. It was already dark, and Li Tianming left with the name list.The next morning, Wei Zikun was already here for him. When he saw Wei Zikun, he had the sudden realisation that his appearance somewhat resembled mother\u2019s\u2026Wei Zikun\u2026 Wei\u2026A new idea, one so unique that he'd never thought of it before, flashed through his mind. This hall overseer from the Hall of Phoenix could very well be Li Tianming\u2019s relative!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 72": "Chapter 72 - The Four Heavenly GuardiansPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe moment they met, Wei Zikun pointed out to Li Tianming, \u201cMu Wan should have prepared you for the situation that no supernal mentor is willing to accept you, right? Just keep that in mind.\u201d\u201cGot it.\u201d Li Tianming was a simple man, if the mentors had no interest in him, then he had no intention to stick around there. He wasn\u2019t going to respect people who wouldn\u2019t respect him.\u201cFollow me.\u201d Wei Zikun was a man of few words. It was said that he came from the Wei family that resided inside the sanctum, and was one of the elites of his generation from young. As a hall overseer that wasn\u2019t yet forty, his name was famous in the capital.\u201cOverseer, may I ask a question?\u201d Li Tianming followed behind him.\u201cSpeak.\u201d\u201cI heard that the chancellor of the Institute is your elder brother?\u201d Li Tianming asked.\u201cThat\u2019s right, any problems with that?\u201d Wei Zikun turned back to glance at him.\u201cOf course not,\u201d Li Tianming answered, a smile on his face.The chancellor was a man about fifty years old named Wei Tianxiong, and he was one of the leading figures in the entire nation. It was common belief that Wei Tianxiong was the master of the Flameyellow Scions Institute, and had the institute in his control. That was what Li Tianming thought as well, till he learnt that the Sanctum Potentate was the true ruler of this place.The Potentate had the surname Wei as well, suggesting that he, Wei Tianxiong and Wei Zikun were of the same family. Since that was the case, it meant their family were the leading faction in the entire institute, perhaps even the true rulers. The only thing Li Tianming couldn\u2019t confirm was the relationship between his grandfather, the Potentate, and Wei Tianxiong.\u2026\u2026As they spoke, Wei Zikun brought him across the entire institute. Along the way, many disciples threw envious looks at him, knowing that today was the day Li Tianming was supposed to enter the sanctum.But how would they know that Li Tianming was about to face eighteen supernal mentors who had no intention of accepting him? If Li Tianming were to become the first ever prime disciple that no mentors accepted, then he would still have to return and cultivate in the institute, where he would be an even greater joke. The result was predictable, since the entrapment three years ago had made him out to be a scumbag who drugged others, an impression that was just too hard to change.Around fifteen minutes later, after crossing layer after layer of security, they finally reached the gates to the sanctum.Li Tianming\u2019s first step inside told him that this was no doubt the place that controlled the lifeline of the institute. The security in this region was far stricter, and even the walls here were thicker than the ones surrounding the institute.Those who resided in the sanctum were either the utmost geniuses of the nation or the renowned supernal mentors.\u201cWe shall head over to the Hall of Ancestry first.\u201d The Hall of Ancestry was where the supernal mentors took in their new disciples, and every time a student entered the sanctum, he or she would make their first stop at the hall.\u201cLi Tianming, do you know who else stays within the sanctum other than the supernal mentors?\u201d asked Wei Zikun.\u201cThe smartest disciples in the Institute.\u201d\u201cAnd on top of the supernal mentors?\u201d\u201cUh, the four heavenly guardians, then the vice-Potentate and the potentate himself?\u201d Li Tianming said.\u201cCorrect. The potentate has the highest position in the entire institute, but it is quite impossible for you to meet him in person. Therefore the four guardians are effectively the ones controlling the sanctum. Remember to always pay your respects to them.\u201d Wei Zikun reminded him. He didn't want to see Li Tianming provoke one of the guardians by accident.\u201cThe four guardians are the Guardian of Combat, Guardian of Legions, Guardian of Sanctions, and the Guardian of Ancestry. The Guardian of Ancestry runs the Hall of Ancestry, and he will be the one overseeing the process later. Every single disciple that enters the sanctum will go through his eyes first,\u201d Wei Zikun explained.\u201cYes I understand. But I have a small question.\u201d\u201cSpeak.\u201d\u201cSince you are one of the hall overseers, may I ask if your position is higher than that of the guardians?\u201d\u201cOf course not. An overseer has about as much power as a regular supernal mentor, perhaps a little more.\u201d Wei Zikun wasn\u2019t offended by being compared with the guardians. For Li Tianming to ask that question, it only suggested his lack of background. Anyone from a powerful family in Ignispolis could tell him that the four guardians were just below the potentate and the vice-potentate.For Li Tianming, this information shed light to how much power Heaven\u2019s Sanctum had. He always thought that the sanctum was part of the institute, but in fact, it was the other way round.......The Guardian of Ancestry was in charge of the disciples and their conduct. Every single disciple here was an elite that he himself had approved of.It wasn\u2019t long before they arrived at the Hall of Ancestry. The building was covered in black, and it gave off a foreboding aura that could scare any new disciples.\u201cIt\u2019s about time the supernal mentors arrive. Just follow me. There\u2019s no need to be nervous.\u201d Wei Zikun instructed him one last time before stepping in. Li Tianming followed him closely, noting that they had not run into a single person since they entered the sanctum. It was true that only the very few true elites stayed here.Once they entered the hall, Li Tianming was greeted by some of the most powerful cultivators in the nation. A total of eighteen supernal mentors awaited him, together with the Guardian of Ancestry. They were scrutinizing him, just like how they would scrutinize every other disciple who stepped foot here.The hall was lit brightly with candles, illustrating the many figures that were within the hall. Yet no one talked, and the atmosphere was so stifling that Li Tianming could feel himself almost suffocating from the pressure.\u201cGuardian of Ancestry, supernal mentors, I have brought the prime disciple from the Hall of Phoenix, Li Tianming.\u201d Wei Zikun\u2019s announcement finally broke the silence.\u201cDisciple Li Tianming greets the guardian and the supernal mentors.\u201d He had heard that Heaven\u2019s Sanctum\u2019s was a solemn place, so Li Tianming respectfully addressed his greetings. His voice was calm, and one couldn\u2019t hear any nervousness in his voice.\u201cThank you overseer.\u201d A hoarse voice came from the end of the hall. By the sounds of it, the speaker must be a formidable old man.\u201cPrime Disciple Li Tianming, raise your head. Let the mentors and I take a look at you.\u201d\u201cYes, guardian.\u201d Li Tianming\u2019s head had been lowered the moment he entered, and he only looked up when he was instructed to. It wasn\u2019t because he was scared, but it would be rude of him if he started peeking the moment he entered.Directly in front of Li Tianming, a hulking elder sat in what looked like a throne at the end of the hall. His hair was white, but the pinkish glow on his face resembled that of a vigorous young man in his thirties. Despite his age, he was still giving off a terrifying aura.Nine mentors were seated by his left and the other nine his right. The supernal mentors were slightly younger than the guardian himself, but they all ranged from the age of forty to sixty too. They too gave off the aura of warriors, pairs of eyes staring intensely at Li Tianming. Some of them had youngsters standing behind them, their own disciples who had joined in to take a look at that \u2018famous\u2019 Li Tianming.Li Tianming had never entered the sanctum before today, which meant that he didn't recognise them. But obviously, they were all geniuses that could easily outshine those in the institute, and those who were the same age as Li Tianming were minimally fifth level Spiritsource. The youngsters too looked at Li Tianming with interest, though none of them would dare to speak a word without the seniors\u2019 permissions.\u201cThe prime disciple is here, and I assume that the mentors should have heard of him. It was said that he had been a disciple in the institute four years ago, and everyone seated here should have an idea of his talent. Whoever\u2019s interested in taking him, just go ahead.\u201d The Guardian of Ancestry leaned back on his chair and signaled the supernal mentors to proceed.The eighteen of them were looking at Li Tianming. They were all cautious people, thus all of them had chosen to watch how things went first. This was unlike past years when they had to fight for the prime disciple.Li Tianming had seen portraits of the supernal mentors in the name list, so he could recognize the mentors. He could figure out who was Zhao Tianchen, who was Liu Xueyao, and who was Feng Wuguang. The possible candidates that Mu Wan mentioned were there too, but none of them had spoken up.Things were getting very awkward in the hall, and surely any who heard of this would consider it a joke. Li Tianming was no doubt the most special prime disciple they had ever encountered, and none of the supernal mentors spoke up for a few minutes.\u201cHow about this, Li Tianming. Show the mentors your lifebound beast,\u201d the guardian instructed.\u201cYes.\u201d Li Tianming dipped his head.He had expected things to be difficult today, but this level of awkwardness was... unexpected. The mentors couldn\u2019t accept the level of cultivation he had at his age. He must be the first prime disciple in the sanctum\u2019s history who couldn\u2019t even clear the basic requirement here.As the little chick appeared on Li Tianming\u2019s shoulder, some of the mentors even let slip a laugh or two. That included Liu Xueyao, whom Mu Wan had a strong dislike for. She was Mu Qingqing\u2019s mentor, and their temperaments were highly similar. She wore a white long dress, and if it wasn\u2019t for her stony expression, she would have been more charming.\u201cWhat a joke. There really is a need to fix the rules for the ranking test, I was ready to accept Xiaoxiao as my disciple,\u201d she whispered to the other supernal mentor, Zhao Tianchen, who was seated beside her.\u201cAnd look at who we get now.\u201d Zhao Tianchen sighed. He was a handsome middle-aged man, his long hair tied into a bun giving him a scholarly look.\u201cAnyone interested?\u201d\u201cHaha.\u201d The supernal mentors glanced at each other, their looks of disinterest obvious from their eyes.\u201cTwenty years old and he is at most at third level Spiritsource.\u201d\u201cUnworthy.\u201d\u201cIf Lin Xiaoxiao was here, she might even reach Unity by the time she\u2019s twenty.\u201d\u201cHmm, the flaws in the ranking test had given us a clown instead of a true prodigy. \u201d\u201cWhy should we accept someone who provoked the Lightning Manor and has no background at all?\u201dThe supernal mentors were clueless as to what to do too. How could they have expected the prime disciple to be so problematic?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 73": "Chapter 73 - Wei GuohaoPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIt was obvious from their mocking laughter that no one intended to accept him. Even if someone had been willing to give Li Tianming a chance, in such an atmosphere, they would drop such a thought.The Guardian of Ancestry looked around, before turning to Li Tianming. He could only shake his head and say, \u201cHow about this, Li Tianming, show us some of your skills. You know full well that your age is almost past the optimal age to train, and it\u2019ll be difficult for the supernal mentors to help you.\u201dLi Tianming was used to this kind of behaviour. Mockery occurring here didn\u2019t betray his expectations, and hence, he remained calm throughout.At the start, he had held on to some hope, but now, he was aware that no matter how he performed, none would give him a chance.It was quite depressing that he had done his best to become the prime disciple, but he hadn\u2019t been able to impress even one supernal mentor.\u201cBunch of assholes,\u201d the little chick cursed by Li Tianming\u2019s ear.\u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal. They have the authority to do this,\u201d Li Tianming said emotionlessly.The Guardian of Ancestry wanted him to show his skills now, but he had already done so in the ranking battles. Now, what could he show when there wasn\u2019t even an opponent?\u201cOne of you go down,\u201d said the Guardian of Ancestry, who had noticed the issue.\u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d A tall and sturdy young man stepped out from behind Supernal Mentor Zhao Tianchen. He was dressed in golden robes, his eyes burning like torches. He was imposing without being angry, and truly had the presence of a person of noble birth. At one glance, he was obviously an elite genius.He walked forward to Li Tianming, but instead of looking at him, he looked at Wei Zikun instead. \u201cSecond Uncle, let me lend this brother from the Hall of Phoenix a hand.\u201d\u201cIf you wish.\u201d Wei Zikun could already tell Li Tianming had no chance today. Not wanting to waste time, he took a seat at the side. He was just waiting for the supernal mentor to directly reject Li Tianming so he could bring Li Tianming and leave.In the end, it didn\u2019t matter to him whether or not Li Tianming joined Heaven\u2019s Sanctum.This young man called Wei Zikun Second Uncle and Wei Zikun\u2019s elder brother was the Flameyellow Scions Institute chancellor. Did that mean this young man was the chancellor\u2019s son?\u201cYou\u2019re Li Tianming, right? I\u2019m Wei Guohao, Supernal Mentor Zhao Tianchen\u2019s disciple.\u201d The young man stood in front of Li Tianming, his gaze seeming to contain blades.He was definitely the chancellor\u2019s son. However, in the institute, they didn\u2019t have the custom of using familial relations or who their father was to introduce themselves. Instead, they introduced themselves as their master\u2019s disciple.Li Tianming had heard of Wei Guohao before. Most likely, he had grown up in Heaven\u2019s Sanctum. He definitely didn\u2019t need to participate in the admission test and ranking battles. However, his aptitude was likely still definitely near the top of Heaven\u2019s Sanctum, near to that of Lin Xiaoting\u2019s.\u201cSenior apprentice-brother Wei, how do we do this?\u201dLi Tianming wasn\u2019t sure what Wei Guohao\u2019s motive was.\u201cI\u2019m here to help you. Just attack me however you want, I won\u2019t retaliate.\u201d Wei Guohao sounded very heroic, as if he did want to help Li Tianming. However, the natural superiority in his tone was uncomfortable.\u201cLi Tianming, use this chance well,\u201d the Guardian of Ancestry added.Li Tianming examined Wei Guohao closely. \u201cYes, Guardian.\u201dWei Guohao had trained from young in Heaven\u2019s Sanctum and was roughly Li Tianming\u2019s age. With his talent, ten years of training definitely meant he was far beyond Lin Xiaoxiao; someone on the level of Chen Hao and Xing Que.He was likely at the peak of Spiritsource. Li Tianming was only first level Spiritsource, and it wasn\u2019t likely Li Tianming could catch up to someone his age in just a few months even if he had the infernalsource. He could only try his best.Li Tianming held the Thunderfire Chain in his hand, and a moment later, Ying Huo and him exploded into motion, attacking Wei Guohao. Li Tianming used the Confounding Mirage Walk and Nine Flying Bolts, while the little chick used the Netherfire Ghostclaw.Their speed was incredible as they charged at Wei Guohao, but their opponent merely maintained a gentle smile.\u201cNot bad. When his beast ki bursts out, it\u2019s nearly the match of fourth level Spiritsource. It\u2019s no wonder he could beat Lin Xiaoxiao.\u201d\u201cOur worst disciple in Heaven\u2019s Sanctum at his age is almost at sixth level Spiritsource. And he\u2019s not even actually at fourth level.\u201dEven if Li Tianming showed his best, it would be difficult to make the supernal mentors even raise an eyebrow with his age.Wei Guohao didn\u2019t act polite. He maintained that smile, acting like a senior watching with amusement as a junior threw an unreasonable tantrum.To him, Li Tianming was no different from a snail.His smile turned cold when the attacks reached. With lightning-fast speed, he casually flicked his finger, causing a burst of golden light. It crashed into the little chick\u2019s claw, sending it tumbling away.Li Tianming could only laugh at that. If that wasn\u2019t retaliating, what was?Li Tianming had actually expected him to just stand there and receive the attacks.\u201cToo weak. You can\u2019t do it.\u201d Wei Guohao shook his head while chuckling sorrowfully as he casually extended a hand to seize Li Tianming\u2019s chain.The next moment, a terrifying force emanated from the other end of the chain as if a massive beast had captured it with its jaws. Before Li Tianming could pull it back, the Thunderfire Chain shattered into fragments!And thus, Li Tianming lost his preferred weapon.\u201cMy apologies. I wasn\u2019t expecting your weapon to be so fragile to break at a casual touch,\u201d Wei Guohao said regretfully.Without the chain, Li Tianming had lost a large portion of his combat prowess.Li Tianming\u2019s opponent had worn a smile throughout it all. How was this giving him a chance to show his skills and obtain the acknowledgement of the supernal mentor? This was just reinforcing their decision to reject him.If he held back slightly, Li Tianming would have the chance to put his abilities on full display. However, he had casually used his superior cultivation stage to trounce Li Tianming.However, Li Tianming couldn\u2019t say much because his strength was real. The strong had the ability to trample his reputation into the mud and destroy his chances of entering Heaven\u2019s Sanctum!However, this didn\u2019t mean Li Tianming was going to roll over and accept this! In the same moment the chain broke apart, the little chick belched out a fiery phoenix behind Wei Guohao, the Infernal Blaze lighting up the area.Wei Guohao turned around to see the little chick\u2019s spiritsource ability bearing down on him.He shook his head dismissively, casually punching out and tearing apart the phoenix. \u201cDisperse.\u201dUsually, this meant the spiritsource ability had been vanquished.However, Wei Guohao never expected the phoenix to dissipate into countless sparks that continued at him. He was forced to dodge awkwardly, but a dozen odd sparks still landed on him. But to his shock, his beast ki wasn\u2019t able to extinguish them!\u201cLi Tianming! You!\u201d Embarrassment quickly turned into anger, and he could only quickly tear out the burning sections of his clothing, finally escaping the Infernal Blaze after a dozen holes were added to his clothing.Although it hadn\u2019t actually hurt him, his current appearance was definitely humiliating. It was a far cry from his earlier act of being a senior watching a junior.He had been casually trouncing Li Tianming, but now his hair was in a mess and his clothes were filled with holes.Those unaware might assume he was the one beaten.\u201cBig oops, senior apprentice-brother Wei.\u201d Li Tianming chuckled coldly before he stopped moving. That was his one chance to gain an advantage, but otherwise, he admitted the disparity in strength.He had only been cultivating for a month after all.This accomplishment he had made was not half bad already.Li Tianming\u2019s smile immediately ruined Wei Guohao\u2019s feelings.Being embarrassed in front of so many supernal mentors would make anyone gloomy.\u201cNo need to be. Continue.\u201d Wei Guohao\u2019s tone was much colder now. He even advanced, obviously intent on taking revenge.\u201cThere\u2019s no need. You broke my weapon and I already showed my strongest ability. I\u2019m out of tricks.\u201d Li Tianming smiled. However, his feelings inside were much different.As the chancellor\u2019s son, sure, suppress him. But was there a need to go as far as breaking his weapon? Li Tianming didn\u2019t have much money left.Li Tianming would definitely collect this debt from Wei Guohao.\u201cEnough. Stand down, Wei Guohao.\u201d Just as Wei Guohao was planning to give him a beating, the Guardian of Ancestry spoke out.Wei Guohao could only glare at Li Tianming and return to Zhao Tianchen.However, Li Tianming was still confused about how he had offended him.\u201cNot a bad spiritsource ability.\u201d A female supernal mentor, Qin Shi, gave a slight nod of her head. However, she had only ever accepted female disciples.None of the supernal mentors refuted her.It was undeniable that Wei Guohao had made a bad showing, something none had expected.\u201cLi Tianming, your lifebound beast\u2019s spiritsource ability is good. Everything else is not worth mentioning,\u201d said the Guardian of Ancestry.\u201cYes.\u201d Li Tianming admitted it was true. It was nothing in Heaven\u2019s Sanctum. If he was fifteen, they would definitely fight over him. Alas, he was twenty.\u201cWhat do the supernal mentors think?\u201d The Guardian of Ancestry gave the final note.The supernal mentors all exchanged looks. It did surprise them somewhat that Li Tianming could have such mental fortitude and deal such a blow to Wei Guohao.However, no supernal mentor made a decision. It seemed they valued their reputations too much. Li Tianming just had too many black marks against him.\u201cPass,\u201d Liu Xueyao went first. \u201cI have some awareness of what happened to Qingqing that time. What does it show about someone who would accept such an indecent person as a disciple?\u201d She didn\u2019t stop at just reject him, but also made it impossible for anyone to accept him.\u201cAlright them. Let\u2019s not waste any more time. Li Tianming, return with me to the Hall of Phoenix.\u201d Wei Zikun stood up, annoyed. There was no point to this farce.The conclusion was already set in stone.Li Tianming didn\u2019t push it. Fate sometimes played a hand in finding a master. What else could he do? Kneel and beg?However, it was unfortunate. He was the prime disciple after all. Once this spread, it would be another topic to laugh at him for.Li Tianming followed Wei Zikun away without reluctance.However, a voice suddenly drifted over from the door. \u201cSeriously? You all are chasing away the prime disciple? Breaking our word like this, what's this supposed to imply about Heaven\u2019s Sanctum?\u201dNone of the supernal mentors dared to retort against this voice.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 74": "Chapter 74 - Mu YangPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe supernal mentors all acted as if they were unrelated to the matters at hand, as they kept quiet out of fear.Despite the supernal mentors\u2019 status, just a few words could make the supernal mentors lower their heads. Li Tianming immediately knew whoever had just arrived was a major figure in Heaven\u2019s Sanctum, at least a Heavenly Guardian in status.\u201cVice-Potentate.\u201d Li Tianming heard many people address him as such. He hadn\u2019t expected the newcomer to be Heaven's Sanctum future potentate, Mu Yang.The man who entered was dressed in a blue robe, with a golden belt and black boots. His figure and features were majestic, and were so awe-inspiring it seemed he could take on an army. However, he didn\u2019t look like the overbearing sort, and instead had an amiable appearance. When he smiled, he looked like the harmless sort. His words just now seemed angry, but he was still wearing a charming smile.It reminded Li Tianming of Mu Wan. They looked like the same type of person \u2014 as expected of siblings.As he entered, his gaze swept across Li Tianming, but his expression didn\u2019t change much.All the supernal mentors present rose to their feet when he entered. While the Guardian of Ancestry was of lower status than him, he was still his senior. They were also on good terms, and hence, the Guardian didn't get up.\u201cNephew, why have you come to my Hall of Ancestry this day?\u201d The Heavenly Guardian of Ancestry, Jun Yuancang, smiled.\u201cUncle Jun, I come here often even without any business to drink with you.\u201d Mu Yang smiled back.However, the other supernal mentors turned more grave.\u201cStill, ranking battles have been our institute\u2019s trademark for a thousand years. We\u2019ve always upheld fairness and the prime disciple has always had the right to join Heaven\u2019s Sanctum. This is something Heaven\u2019s Sanctum must uphold. So, I don\u2019t quite approve of the supernal mentors sending away the prime disciple today.\u201d Mu Yang moved on from exchanging pleasantries to targeting the eighteen supernal mentors.As his eyes swept past them, they all hurriedly lowered their heads. After all, they were all aware he would be Heaven\u2019s Sanctum\u2019s new master in a few years.\u201cI agree. Still, the supernal mentors have their own difficulties. The prime disciple this time is indeed a little substandard.\u201d The Guardian of Ancestry explained.\u201cThat won\u2019t do. We must uphold our promise to the prime disciple as long as the rules for the ranking battles haven\u2019t changed. I ask you, supernal mentors, who is willing to accept him?\u201dWhile Mu Yang was still smiling, Li Tianming could tell the authority loaded in his words.Mu Yang never really looked at Li Tianming. From his perspective, he simply didn\u2019t want Heaven\u2019s Sanctum to break its promise. However, all the supernal mentors simply shook their heads helplessly.In the end, Mu Yang couldn\u2019t punish all of them no matter how great his authority was. Together, they made the cornerstone of Heaven\u2019s Sanctum.\u201cFine. Then we\u2019ll let the prime disciple choose. What\u2019s your name?\u201d Mu Yang finally looked at Li Tianming.\u201cLi Tianming.\u201d\u201cLi Tianming, choose whoever you want. I guarantee whoever you choose shall be in charge of guiding you. That is the word of Heaven\u2019s Sanctum.\u201d Every word of Mu Yang was filled with boundless power.As the future potentate, this man stood at the apex of Vermilion Bird. To Li Tianming, the man wasn\u2019t just powerful, but was strong in will and prestige.He also held a virtue the other supernal mentors lacked: integrity.\u201cReally, Vice-Potentate? I can choose anyone?\u201d Li Tianming asked.\u201cOf course.\u201dThe supernal mentors weren\u2019t very comfortable with this development, but they had no choice. The moment to test their luck had arrived. Surely, they wouldn\u2019t be the unlucky one among eighteen people, right?As the Vice-Potentate had spoken, the roles had swapped. Now, it was up to Li Tianming to choose them and not the other way around.Li Tianming looked through them all, his gaze finally landing on supernal mentor Liu Xueyao.\u201cDo you choose Liu Xueyao?\u201d Mu Yang asked.Liu Xueyao had already noticed Li Tianming looking at her, and her eyes gave Li Tianming a warning gleam. She had thought Li Tianming would never choose her given his relationship with Mu Qingqing.However, if Mu Yang forced it, she had no choice. Furthermore, if Li Tianming was placed under her charge and she didn\u2019t teach him well, Mu Yang would definitely find trouble for her given his personality.Just as Liu Xueyao was getting worried, Li Tianming smiled. \u201cVice-Potentate, if I may be frank for a moment. All eighteen supernal mentors look down on me and are worried I\u2019ll embarrass them. I\u2019m thankful for the chance, but since we lack the ties of fate, I think I won\u2019t force matters.\u201d These words were definitely beyond the supernal mentors\u2019 expectations, because that was a very dumb choice. Mu Yang had already stood up for him and given him a chance to stay on at Heaven\u2019s Sanctum, but he had chosen to give up.Of course, this was a kind of dumbness pleasing to the supernal mentors. Liu Xueyao in particular heaved a sigh of relief.\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Mu Yang\u2019s mouth curved slightly as he examined Li Tianming closely for the first time, having not done so before to this youth who had some \u2018incidents\u2019 with his third disciple years ago.\u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d\u201cIs it worth it? You\u2019ll lose the chance to join Heaven\u2019s Sanctum.\u201d Mu Yang asked curiously.\u201cThat, I won\u2019t.\u201d Li Tianming said.\u201cWhy?\u201d Mu Yang\u2019s curiosity ramped up.\u201cThat\u2019s because I don\u2019t want to become a supernal mentor\u2019s disciple, but rather the Vice-Potentate\u2019s.\u201d Li Tianming raised his head, meeting Mu Yang\u2019s gaze.Li Tianming was more mature than others his age, which allowed him to deliver his words clearly even before such an important figure.The words stumped Mu Yang for a moment.Then, the first snort rang out. It spread, as all of the usually stern supernal mentors were unable to hold back from their derisive chuckles and snorts. They exchanged glances with those sitting besides them and shook their heads.\u201cThe prime disciple this batch really is lacking when you compare him to the previous prime disciple. The gap is vaster than heaven and earth,\u201d Liu Xue Yao said helplessly. She had originally been planning to bank on her relationship with Mu Qingqing to accept Lin Xiaoxiao, but it had been ruined by Li Tianming.Everyone knew Mu Yang was now the vice-potentate. He was no longer a supernal mentor and wouldn\u2019t be accepting new disciples. The exception was a new disciple that had the potential to become the future potentate, someone at least on Lin Xiaoxiao\u2019s level. Even the chancellor\u2019s son and Princess Qing of the Vermilion Bird royal clan weren\u2019t qualified to be Mu Yang\u2019s disciple.These words from Li Tianming were no different from a toad wanting to eat swan meat, dreaming beyond their station in life.No one could understand why this fellow kept acting like a laughing stock. Was this the recklessness of youth, or just plain stupidity?Several of the younger disciples couldn't hold themselves back, their bodies shaking from their laughter.\u201cLi Tianming, stop making trouble and seize this opportunity!\u201d Wei Zikun frowned. He had been happy when Mu Yang had given Li Tianming such an opportunity, because he could then answer to Mu Wan.And yet, with such a golden opportunity, right when he was about to give Li Tianming some suggestions, Li Tianming had destroyed the opportunity within a few words. And when Li Tianming said he wanted to be Mu Yang\u2019s disciple, even he laughed in a mix of fury and exasperation.He found it embarrassing to have brought Li Tianming here. He distinctly remembered Li Tianming hadn\u2019t been like this in the ranking battles.Still stunned, Mu Yang asked, \u201cYou do know who I am, no?\u201d\u201cYes. You are the vice-potentate, and the future potentate.\u201d Li Tianming replied.\u201cAnd you still want to be my disciple?\u201d Mu Yang chuckled.\u201cAm I underqualified?\u201d Li Tianming asked, further stunning Mu Yang.To be frank, Mu Yang wanted to laugh with the others. However, he could tell Li Tianming wasn\u2019t messing around. He didn\u2019t want to scorn him, so he replied with full seriousness, \u201cIt does seem so, from what I see now. Alright then, we\u2019ll do it this way. Since you don\u2019t have any interest in the supernal mentors, and I\u2019ve already declared you won\u2019t be going back to the institute, then from now on, you shall cultivate autonomously in Heaven\u2019s Sanctum! If and when the day arrives I find you qualified, I\u2019ll accept this bond of master-disciple with you.\u201dThis was the best possible result for Li Tianming. He didn\u2019t really want to invite scorn upon himself by studying under those supernal mentors through an act of charity. However, now Mu Yang had shown him respect and a promise, even allowing him to join Heaven\u2019s Sanctum.It was just that it was lonely not having a master in Heaven\u2019s Sanctum. Still, it wasn\u2019t as if he was friendless here, with Princess Qing and Jiang Feiling here.However, he still asked, \u201cThen, what do I need to accomplish to be considered qualified by the vice-potentate?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 75": "Chapter 75 - The Son of An Old FriendPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cSimple. Just take Wei Guohao for example. He is the same age as you, and I nearly accepted him as my disciple. If you can overcome him, then I\u2019d say you are qualified,\u201d Mu Yang said casually. With Li Tianming\u2019s performance today, it would take nothing short of a miracle for him to defeat Wei Guohao.\u201cI understand. Thank you, Vice-Potentate.\u201d Surprisingly, Li Tianming did not frown at that challenge, but instead nodded with a smile.Wei Guohao was at least seventh level Spiritsource, and he was no doubt one of the top among his generation. Li Tianming had lost just too much time, and it would no doubt be difficult for him to catch up. But he was confident of himself and the Primordial Chaos Beasts \u2014 it wouldn\u2019t be long before he could overtake Wei Guohao.Idiot! Wei Zikun could no longer take Li Tianming\u2019s stupidity. Since Mu Yang had already made arrangements for Li Tianming, then there was no point in him staying there anymore. After exchanging a few words with Mu Yang and the guardian, he turned around and left the hall.\u201cSecond uncle, wait for me.\u201d Wei Guohao chased after Wei Zikun. As he walked past Li Tianming, Wei Guohao couldn\u2019t help but snicker. It was almost as if his eyes could talk, telling Li Tianming to keep dreaming about defeating him.\u201cThis key is yours now. Do you have any friends in the sanctum?\u201d At least Mu Yang was quite nice to Li Tianming, handing him the key to his residence in the sanctum as well as a simple map of the area.\u201cYes.\u201d Li Tianming thought of Princess Qing and Jiang Feiling.\u201cThen you should pay them a visit as soon as possible. In Heaven\u2019s Sanctum, we have our own rules, which are a lot stricter than the ones in the institute. It would be good if you can ask them about it before you settle here.\u201d\u201cNo problem, Vice-Potentate,\u201d Li Tianming replied.He realised that both Sage Chen and Mu Yang seemed to be amiable and capable individuals, and they had achieved quite a name for themselves in the capital. Li Yanfeng seemed like such a bad choice in comparison. Why would Wei Jing choose Li Yanfeng instead of these two? Li Tianming felt that his mother was still hiding something from him, but he couldn\u2019t figure out what it could be.\u201cTime to leave.\u201d After a few words with the guardian, Mu Yang left the hall as well, and the moment he left was the moment the supernal mentors headed out too. Most of them were still glad that thanks to Li Tianming\u2019s stupid decision, none of them would have to become his mentor.Li Tianming bade farewell to those who were still in the hall and then immediately rushed outside. He didn\u2019t want Mu Yang to leave. Even if he did not manage to become Mu Yang\u2019s disciple, he felt that he could still make use of their encounter to tell Mu Yang about his mother's situation.\u201cVice-Potentate, can I have a moment?\u201d Luckily for him, Mu Yang had yet to leave the vicinity.\u201cYes?\u201d Mu Yang answered. He admired the fact that the boy stood his ground and refused the offer to choose any mentor he wanted. But if Li Tianming was to continue bothering him, then he would just treat him as a fool and ignore him too.\u201cI have some personal matters to discuss with you, and it\u2019s rather important as well.\u201d Said Li Tianming.\u201cWhat personal matters can you have with me?\u201dAfter calculating his risks, Li Tianming finally decided that saving his mother took precedence over him accidentally provoking Mu Yang.\u201cDo you remember an old friend?\u201d Li Tianming glared into his eyes.\u201cWho?\u201d\u201cWei Jing,\u201d Li Tianming said.Mu Yang\u2019s body trembled slightly when he heard the name. The look in his eye changed, and he suddenly extended out his hands to press onto Li Tianming\u2019s shoulder, putting pressure on the boy.\u201cSay that again.\u201d Mu Yang\u2019s voice was a lot lower.\u201cHer name is Wei Jing.\u201d\u201cDo you know her? Or are you trying to threaten me with that name?\u201d Mu Yang\u2019s demeanor was totally different from just now. He looked very emotional, even though he was already trying to contain it.\u201cOf course I won\u2019t dare to.\u201d Li Tianming pointed at himself. \u201cI am Wei Jing\u2019s son.\u201dWhen he heard that sentence, Mu Yang released his palms and took a step back, as he stared at Li Tianming with shaking eyes.A while later, he finally took a deep breath and said, \u201cNo wonder I felt something familiar when I saw you. It all makes sense that you are her son\u2026\u201d He knew that Li Tianming was bold, not only rejecting the supernal mentors and even wanted to be his disciple despite all the mockeries. He had only seen such charisma from one person before, and it was none other than that girl!Mu Yang squinted his eyes and continued, \u201cSo what is it that you want to tell me?\u201dLi Tianming was still dubious about Mu Yang\u2019s attitude towards Wei Jing. After some thoughts, he explained, \u201cVice-Potentate, honestly I\u2019m not sure what my mother went through in the past. I spent so many years cultivating just to enter the sanctum someday, since she told me that the only one who can save her is inside Heaven\u2019s Sanctum.\u201d\u201cSave her? What do you mean?\u201d Mu Yang\u2019s expression was still unreadable.\u201cHave you heard of Lifesbane?\u201d Li Tianming asked.\u201cShe has Lifesbane?!\u201d Mu Yang\u2019s pupils went out of focus momentarily. Clearly, he knew something about that queer illness.\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cWhen did that happen?\u201d\u201cShe apparently got it when I was born, so that\u2019s twenty years ago.\u201d\u201cImpossible\u2026\u201d Mu Yang stared at Li Tianming, his jaws grit together, \u201cShe must have returned long ago if she got the Lifesbane twenty years ago. No one in the Wei family could endure that pain for twenty years, you must be lying\u2026\u201d\u201cAnd why should I?\u201d Li Tianming replied with a rhetorical question.\u201cAlright, so she suffered twenty years of Lifesbane. Even then, she wouldn\u2019t come back, she wouldn\u2019t lower her head\u2026\u201d Mu Yang must have remembered what happened in the past, and even red veins appeared in his eyes. From start to end, Li Tianming had thought Vice-Potentate to be a solemn individual; him being in such a state of panic seemed wholly out of character.After a moment of silence, Mu Yang looked into his eyes, \u201cSo what are you here for?\u201d\u201cShe doesn't have much time left,\u201d Li Tianming answered.\u201cGo on\u2026\u201d Mu Yang looked into the distance.\u201cFrom young, I have asked her about how to cure that freak illness of hers, and she initially told me that it was incurable. Later on, she told me that she would tell me the way to cure it if I entered Heaven\u2019s Sanctum, perhaps just to encourage me to work more diligently,\u201d Li Tianming explained.\u201cI made it into the institute, but after certain events I returned home a crippled man. But this time, I brought her to Ignispolis with me and became the prime disciple in front of her eyes. Therefore, she finally agreed for me to find a cure for her. She told me about her past, and she told me to find you, and said that you are the one that can bring me into the Wei Manor.\u201d After he was done, Li Tianming spread his hands, \u201cThat\u2019s all I know.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s back in Ignispolis?\u201d After a while, Mu Yang finally asked.\u201cYes\u201d\u201cIs Li Yanfeng with her?\u201d Mu Yang asked.\u201cLi Yanfeng? He had abandoned the two of us, and is now a proud member of the Lightning Manor,\u201d Li Tianming sneered.\u201cAre you serious?\u201d Mu Yang\u2019s eyes suddenly became much colder.\u201cOf course, ever since I was a kid, the one who took care of me was mother. Li Yanfeng had nothing to do with it.\u201d Li Tianming rolled his eyes.\u201cThat bastard, I will personally see him dead!\u201d This was the first time Mu Yang displayed his emotions in front of Li Tianming, and an incredible pressure fell on his shoulders.\u201cVice-Potentate, I just want my mother to stay alive. She\u2019s running out of time, and I need to act now,\u201d Li Tianming explained.\u201cBring me to her.\u201d Mu Yang came to a conclusion. Li Tianming was glad that Wei Jing had referred a reliable person to him, since it was clear that Mu Yang was concerned about her. Even if he had grudges against Wei Jing at the start, it had dissolved the moment he heard that she had been suffering from Lifesbane for twenty years.\u201cCan we head to the Wei Manor first? Mother said that only the Potentate could cure her of the illness.\u201d Li Tianming said.\u201c...\u201d Mu Yang did not reply.Only after a while did Mu Yang answer, \u201cTo be honest with you, I know what kind of a person the Potentate is. With the fallout he had with Jing\u2019er, and the fact that she had never come back, his grudge has been festerig. He is utterly disappointed in Jing\u2019er, and it\u2019s all but impossible for you to get him to help. Furthermore, her affliction is now deeply rooted in her body; removing it will be a herculean effort through and through.\u201d Mu Yang fell deep into thought.\u201cI don\u2019t understand this. How much grudge could there be between the father and daughter that he could watch her die without any emotions? Even animals won\u2019t do that.\u201d Li Tianming was displeased, not with Mu Yang but with this mysterious Potentate that Mu Yang had described to him. To make matters more complicated, the Potentate was Mu Yang\u2019s mentor.\u201cYou are Li Yanfeng\u2019s son, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Mu Yang stared at him.\u201cYeah?\u201d Li Tianming didn\u2019t understand where the question was coming from.\u201cDoes Li Yanfeng care about you?\u201d\u201cYou are telling me that this Potentate is as loathsome as that Li Yanfeng?\u201d\u201cOf course not.\u201d\u201cThen I will still have my chance. No matter how difficult it is, I have to take a look for myself. What if he agreed straightaway, and we\u2019re wasting our time here?\u201d Li Tianming said.\u201cIf only the situation was this optimistic,\u201d Mu Yang said.\u201cYou are bringing me there right? Even if the manor is a tiger\u2019s den, I will not give up my chance.\u201d Li Tianming looked at him, his eyes burning with ardent flames.\u201cAren't you scared? The Wei family is huge, and they are the real rulers of the sanctum. Your two uncles, Wei Tianxiong and Wei Zikun, have yet to forgive Jing\u2019er. If you go there today, chances are you will just get chased out,\u201d Mu Yang suggested,Li Tianming just found out that the chancellor and the overseer were both the Potentate\u2019s sons, making them his uncles. That would also make that Wei Guohao his cousin.\u201cBeing chased out from the manor, and saving my mother\u2019s life. Which one do you want me to choose?\u201d Li Tianming looked at Mu Yang. It was a question that needed no answering.\u201cI\u2019m going to the manor today, even if it costs me my life,\u201d Li Tianming said. He was smiling, but the ardor in his eyes spoke of his determination.Mu Yang took a look at him.\u201cDamn it, you look exactly like your mother back then. If it wasn\u2019t for that stubbornness of hers, things would have been much easier,\u201d Mu Yang mumbled, but he still made a decision.He would take Li Tianming to the Wei Manor right now, and nothing could stop them!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 76": "Chapter 76 - The Hidden ClanPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe Wei family had resided in Heaven\u2019s Sanctum for countless generations \u2014 most of the Flameyellow Chancellors and the Sanctum Potentate were members of the family. Even most of the top ranking positions were held by the Weis.As a result, their power and influence covered the entire institute. Yet, many disciples here didn't even know of the Wei Manor. At the very most, they knew that the chancellor Wei Tianxiong was the Overseer Wei Zikun\u2019s brother. But few had ever heard of the Sanctum Potentate\u2019s name, and even fewer knew that the Potentate was actually their father!From this, it was evident that the Wei family kept a very low profile. They would rather not let people think that the Institute was a faction of their family, in order to uphold the integrity of the Institute\u2019s purpose of raising the nation\u2019s gifted youths. Even for those within the sanctum like Wei Guohao, he would rather address himself as Zhao Tianchen\u2019s disciple than as the son of the chancellor.Such a hidden powerhouse therefore had to place great emphasis on the discipline of its members. If not, they would have abused their power, a surefire way of gaining notoriety.There were many different factions that controlled the various parts of Ignispolis, with the Vermilion Bird clan considered as the strongest faction. And only those from the most elite factions would learn that the Wei clan of Heaven\u2019s Sanctum was actually one of the leading factions in the nation too! While the Wei family fell short in the membership numbers compared to factions like Lightning Manor or the royal clan, they were the cream of the crop! This was also why Wei Jing had connections to some of the most famous people in the nation.Under the influence of their ancestors, the entire family considered it their duty to maintain a low profile. Therefore, even the Wei Manor hidden within the sanctum looked like nothing more than just an ordinary courtyard. It was no match compared to the luxurious Chen Chateau, or the grandiose imperial palace. Yet, it was this insignificant courtyard that sheltered the most important members of the institute.Most of the Wei family were gathered here today, making the manor much more crowded than usual. In the main hall, the servants were busy setting up a feast, with dishes and liquor delivered quickly to the dozens of tables scattered across the hall. Clearly, there was some kind of joyous occasion happening in the manor right now.Seated on the left seat of the biggest table was a middle-aged man dressed in a golden robe. A bulky man, his imposing presence was not any weaker than Mu Yang\u2019s. He was none other than the supposedly strongest cultivator of the institute, the chancellor Wei Tianxiong. The man controlled the entire institute, but he rarely appeared in public except for the most important occasions, and even Li Tianming had not seen him before.Seated across Wei Tianxiong was an elder. The elder had vitality that belied his age, his eyes brimming with golden sword ki. Even his muscles had a golden sheen, as if his torso was made out of metal. This elder was the Guardian of Sanctions, Wei Qing. He was also the Potentate\u2019s younger brother and Wei Tianxiong\u2019s uncle. Wei Qing was also a legendary character, as the manager of all punishments in the sanctum.Important positions like the Potentate, the four Heavenly Guardians, the chancellor and the hall overseers were controlled by the Wei family. That made it perfectly valid to say that the sanctum was effectively controlled by the Wei family. Then again, the fact that Mu Yang could triumph over Wei Tianxiong to become the next Potentate suggested that they still encouraged competition.Other than Wei Tianxiong and Wei Qing, the fifty or so other members were part of the Wei family as well. They were either chief mentors of the institute or disciples of the sanctum, and only very few untalented ones cultivated in the institute.The reason why so many gathered in the hall today was because today was the birthday party of Wei Tianxiong\u2019s youngest daughter, Wei Lingxuan. The daughter that the chancellor cherished had just reached eighteen years old today. Wei Tianxiong himself had three sons, the eldest of them thirty-nine and the second twenty-nine. Both of them were chief mentors in the institute, and were working towards joining the supernal mentors. One of them would probably take on the role of the chancellor in the future. His third son was Wei Guohao, who at twenty years old was one of the most talented disciples in the sanctum,As for Wei Lingxuan, she was Wei Tianxiong\u2019s only daughter and also his youngest child. Naturally, she had been pampered since young \u2014 she was essentially the little princess of the manor. As the star of the day, Wei Lingxuan was dressed in a crimson skirt, adorned with all kinds of jewelry and ornaments. As the princess of the family, her disposition fitted her status \u2014 her body was honed and full of power.\u201cElder sister, you look really good today. All the boys in the sanctum must have been charmed by you.\u201d A boy dressed in a green robe said to her. He was Wei Zikun\u2019s eldest son, Wei Qingyi, and was a disciple of the sanctum at the age of seventeen.Surrounding him were his younger siblings. Wei Zikun had two partners, but both of them were his concubines. He had always wanted to keep the position of his wife for Mu Wan, but she had never accepted that offer. That didn\u2019t stop him from having five children, however, with the youngest of them only three years old.\u201cDon\u2019t try to be smooth with me, what do you want?\u201d Wei Lingxuan rolled her eyes.\u201cCome on, we are brothers and sisters. I was just hoping that since sister is in a good mood today, can you perhaps mention this outstanding younger brother of yours in front of Princess Qing? After all, both of you are Supernal Mentor Qin Shi\u2019s disciples\u2026 \u201d\u201cDon\u2019t bother, we don\u2019t exactly see eye to eye with each other. We barely even talk.\u201d Wei Lingxuan pursed her lips and shut down Wei Qingyi\u2019s idea on the spot.Having said that, Wei Lingxuan looked at the doorway and continued, \u201cAnyway, why is my third brother still not here? Surely he wouldn\u2019t disappoint me on my birthday, right?\u201d\u201cElder brother Hao is together with my dad. I heard my dad saying yesterday that he will be bringing a prime disciple to the Hall of Ancestry first before attending the party,\u201d Wei Qingyi answered.\u201cPrime disciple? I watched the ranking test, it\u2019s that Li Tianming isn\u2019t it? What a clown. He\u2019s probably going to be chucked out of the hall by the supernal mentors,\u201d Wei Lingxuan scoffed.\u201cThat would indeed make him a clown.\u201d Wei Qingyi sounded sulky. \u201cSis, why do you think Princess Qing is interested in scum like him?\u201d\u201cWhat Princess Qing? Looks to me like that Jiang Qingluan is pissed at him too. But Princess Ling\u2019s affection towards him is rather intriguing.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s queer indeed. Anyway, that prime disciple is probably still thinking of looking for Princess Ling in the sanctum. How would he react if he found out that he can\u2019t even make it into the sanctum?\u201d Wei Qingyi sneered, \u201cFirst Lin Xiaoting\u2019s girlfriend, and now the princesses, just how shameless is this guy?\u201d\u201cCan we not talk about this kind of person on my birthday? It\u2019s disgusting,\u201d Wei Lingxuan said.\u201cHaha, my bad sis\u2026 Look, my father and brother Hao are back.\u201d Wei Qingyi pointed to the gate where two bulky men were walking in..\u201cThird brother, what have you been doing? We waited so long,\u201d Wei Lingxuan grumbled.\u201cI was preparing a gift for my precious little sister,\u201d Wei Guohao laughed.\u201cAnd where is it?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll pass it to you later. Is grandfather not out yet?\u201d Wei Guohao looked at the seat in between Wei Tianxiong and Wei Qing which was still empty.\u201cWe don\u2019t know if he\u2019s coming out today, let\u2019s wait a while more.\u201d Wei Lingxuan pouted. It had been a long time since she last saw her grandfather, and she hoped to at least see him on her eighteenth birthday.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, he promised he\u2019d be here today,\u201d Wei Tianxiong was drinking with Wei Qing when he overheard her conversation and answered. Wei Zikun had also found his seat and went to send his greetings to Wei Qing.\u201cI reckon he will be really happy to see Xuan\u2019er reach eighteen.\u201d said Wei Zikun.\u201cDefinitely, he adores Xuan\u2019er the most. It\u2019s been eighteen years, time really flies.\u201d Wei Tianxiong exclaimed.\u201cZikun, did any supernal mentor accept that prime disciple?\u201d Wei Qing interrupted at one side.\u201cHa, more like they wanted to hide from him.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not appropriate. Rules are rules, and we need to find someone to accept him,\u201d said the chancellor, Wei Tianxiong.\u201cThat\u2019s what brother Yang said too,\u201d Wei Zikun replied.\u201cMu Yang was there?\u201d\u201cHappened to walk pass.\u201d\u201cAnd?\u201d\u201cHe told Li Tianming to pick one for himself, but that boy was an absolute idiot. He said that he wouldn\u2019t force the supernal mentors to pick him, and he ended not picking any of them. Damn it, how am I going to tell Mu Wan about this.\u201d Wei Zikun downed a mouthful of liquor.\u201cInteresting boy.\u201d Wei Tianxiong smiled.\u201cInteresting my ass, he\u2019s just dumb,\u201d Wei Zikun snapped.\u201cAnd how did Mu Yang settle it?\u201d\u201cHe found him a place in the sanctum and told him to cultivate by himself. That boy even said he wanted to be Mu Yang\u2019s disciple, as if he hasn\u2019t shamed himself enough. Shouldn\u2019t have brought him to the Hall of Ancestry in the first place.\u201d Wei Zikun shook his head.\u201cIf he is going to be over-ambitious then no one can help him. Just let him be, and when he fails the examinations he is bound to be expelled from the sanctum,\u201d Wei Tianxiong said.\u201cIt\u2019s his own choice after all. There\u2019s no way he can survive here without the help of a supernal mentor.\u201d\u201cForget about this fool. Today\u2019s Xuan\u2019er\u2019s birthday, we should talk about something happier.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m happy enough just looking at all those youngsters there.\u201d\u201cXuan\u2019er told me that she had one wish for her birthday.\u201d Wei Tianxiong glanced at Wei Lingxuan, who was chatting with those around her.\u201cThat is?\u201d\u201cShe wanted to see grandfather.\u201d\u201cHave you told him?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d\u201cThat old fellow, how could he cooped up inside his own room for years\u2026\u201d\u201cZikun, watch what you are saying,\u201d Wei Tianxiong interrupted.\u201cMy bad.\u201d\u201cJing\u2019er hurt him too much,\u201d Wei Qing suddenly sighed.Wei Tianxiong looked at his daughter Wei Lingxuan, and said, \u201cXuan\u2019er has grown up, and perhaps this can be a new beginning. I will ask Xuan\u2019er to visit him more often, and hopefully he will forget that person.\u201dWei Zikun nodded in agreement. \u201cGood idea.\u201dJust then, the entire hall suddenly plunged into silence. An elderly man had appeared outside of the gates.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 77": "Chapter 77 - Goldfault SwordPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe old man was dressed in white robes. He was thin, and his posture was slightly hunched. Together with the blotches on his skin, it gave him a very aged appearance. However, appearances could be deceiving. His eyes contained a might within them that surpassed even Wei Tianxiong. A mere glance was enough to silence people with fear.\u201cGrandfather!\u201d A group of youths all gathered together to welcome the pillar in their heart. The man was the potentate of Heaven\u2019s Sanctum, Wei Tiancang. This was one of the true hidden experts of Vermilion Bird, the true master of Flameyellow Scions Institute.Wei Qing, Wei Tianxiong and Wei Zikun all rose to their feet.\u201cGrandfather, let me support you.\u201d Wei Lingxuan was all smiles as she went forward with Wei Guohao, each taking one of his arms.However, despite his hunched posture, Wei Tiancang\u2019s steps were still steady. It was just that no one would reject the support of their grandchildren.\u201cHe finally smiled,\u201d Wei Zikun said to Wei Tianxiong.\u201cYeah, turns out that he really can smile. I should let the children visit him more often. He chases me away every time I visit,\u201d Wei Tianxiong said helplessly.However, the two brothers still felt themselves relax when they saw their father smile.\u201cSit.\u201d His two grandchildren helped him to the seat of honour. Wei Lingxuan suddenly thought of a great idea and didn\u2019t return to her seat, instead sticking by Wei Tiancang to pour him his drink.\u201cI still remember when Xuan\u2019er was born. She was only the size of my palm. Now, eighteen years have passed in the blink of an eye and she\u2019s become a little lady already.\u201d Wei Tiancang rubbed her head, his smile widening even more.\u201cGrandfather, my only hope is for time to pass slower so that you can stay young forever and accompany me.\u201d\u201cGood child.\u201d\u201cGrandfather, let me give you a toast. I wish you happiness as immense as the seas and longevity as long as the mountains.\u201d\u201cHaha, it\u2019s Xuan\u2019er\u2019s birthday today, so why are you giving me the well wishes first?\u201dWei Tianxiong and Wei Zikun exchanged a look and chuckled. It really had to be left to a lively young lady like Wei Lingxuan to cheer up Wei Tiancang,\u201cGrandfather, where\u2019s my present?\u201d\u201cLittle lass, I\u2019ve already prepared it long ago.\u201d Wei Tiancang produced a golden sword from out of nowhere. It was covered in green heavenly patterns and exuded a fierce aura.\u201cGrade five beastial weapon, Goldfault Sword!\u201d All the youths let out exclaimed gasps as they showed envious expressions. This sword was famous.\u201cThanks grandfather, I love you the most!\u201d Wei Lingxuan accepted the present excitedly.\u201cRemember, don\u2019t force it before you\u2019re strong enough to use it. Progress is made step by step.\u201d Wei Tiancang exhorted.\u201cI know! I\u2019m so happy now, Grandfather. It\u2019ll be great if you could come out more often to give me pointers!\u201d She showed a pitiful expression to Wei Tiancang.\u201cAlright, alright.\u201d Wei Tiancang smiled as he stroked his beard.\u201cAmazing.\u201d Wei Zikun was full of admiration. Granddaughters really were a cut above the rest. If his two sons had approached him with such a request, they wouldn\u2019t have been given the time of the day. The last time Wei Tiancang had come out, it had been to appoint Mu Yang as the next potentate.It could be said this birthday party was perfect now. Cheerful conversation flowed non-stop amongst the youths like Wei Lingxuan.At this moment, a guard discreetly approached and whispered in Wei Tianxiong\u2019s ear, \u201cChancellor, the vice-potentate is here.\u201d\u201cLet him in. Did you ask if he has a gift?\u201d\u201cHe brought a young man along with him. He asked me to report in first.\u201d\u201cWho\u2019s the young man?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t recognise him.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s fine, let him in,\u201d Wei Tianxiong said hurriedly.\u201cWho is it?\u201d Wei Zikun asked.\u201cMu Yang.\u201d\u201cHe could have just come in directly.\u201d\u201cIt seems he brought an outsider along.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d Wei Zikun didn\u2019t take much note of it. Currently, a whole group of youths were around Wei Tiancang. Such happy times were rare for the Wei Clan.Then, two outsiders entered.\u2026\u2026Li Tianming hadn\u2019t expected the Wei Manor to be so lively when he came. Even from afar, the sounds of joy of laughter rang clear and visible.Li Tianming took a good, long look around, because he knew this was where Wei Jing grew up. She had been wandering around outside for twenty years, and Li Tianming was sure she was homesick.\u201cSomething must be happening, it\u2019s so lively,\u201d Mu Yang said.\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t say anything later. I\u2019ll handle all the talking later,\u201d Mu Yang ordered.\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cMaster spends almost all his time in his Highcloud Chamber. I\u2019ll talk to Wei Tianxiong later and bring you there directly.\" Mu Yang glanced at the youth before bringing him into the noisy courtyard.As soon as he entered, Mu Yang caught sight of Wei Tiancang. Li Tianming did too, perhaps due to the mysterious connection between blood relatives. Li Tianming had never seen him before, but he immediately knew this old man was the Sanctum Potentate and Wei Jing\u2019s father.And, his grandfather.The Guardian of Sanctions by Wei Tiancang\u2019s side looked even more severe, and he looked old but vigorous. However, Li Tianming didn\u2019t even spare him a glance.\u201cYou\u2019re out, master\u2026\u201d Mu Yang was surprised.\u201c\u201dYes, it\u2019s Xuan\u2019er\u2019s birthday today.\u201d It could be seen that Wei Tiancang\u2019s attitude towards Mu Yang was even better than Wei Tianxiong and Wei Zikun.\u201cI see.\u201d Mu Yang laughed. \u201cXuan\u2019er, sorry, I didn\u2019t prepare a gift this time. I\u2019ll be sure to make it up to you.\u201d\u201cThank you, Uncle Yang. Don\u2019t be too stingy!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t talk like that,\u201d Wei Tianxiong reproached her.Mu Yang smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s alright. I like Xuan\u2019er\u2019s frankness.\u201d\u201cUncle Yang has even better acumen than Mu Yang\u2019s dad.\u201d Wei Lingxuan made a face at Wei Tianxiong, provoking laughter all around.\u201cMu Yang, why did you bring him here?\u201d Wei Zikun had noticed Li Tianming immediately. Mu Yang had never even brought Lin Xiaoting here before.Wei Guohao found it strange too.\u201cThis young man is\u2026?\u201d Wei Tianxiong asked.Wei Zikun\u2019s words made everyone notice Li Tianming. It was rather strange, as Mu Yang definitely knew what the Wei Clan frowned upon.\u201cBig brother, he\u2019s the prime disciple this year, Li Tianming.\u201dEveryone got even more curious now. Bringing such an unimportant person here didn\u2019t seem very appropriate.As everyone was looking doubtfully at Li Tianming, Li Tianming\u2019s eyes met Wei Tiancang\u2019s. The old man was looking at him calmly. As they locked gazes, Li Tianming felt a mounting pressure that left him breathless. However, Li Tianming had no choice but to meet this grandfather of his in the eyes. For the sake of his mother, he couldn\u2019t lose to him.\u201cMaster, I came to find you for some small matter. However, it was bad timing on my part since today is Xuan\u2019er\u2019s birthday. I\u2019ll come back in a few days with a present.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Wei Tiancang gave him a glance before closing his eyes. Those present could feel a storm brewing in the air.Li Tianming got the sensation that the old man had seen through him completely.\u201cI\u2019ll come back another day.\u201d\u201cNo need. Say it here.\u201d Wei Tiancang\u2019s attitude suddenly changed, his good mood gone.\u201cThen, perhaps we can take this to your Highcloud Chamber...\u201d\u201cIf you have something to say, say it here. Don\u2019t waste time,\u201d Wei Tiancang spoke indifferently.Mu Yang could feel a headache coming on. He hadn\u2019t expected today of all days, to be Wei Lingxuan\u2019s birthday. He had originally been planning to speak privately with Wei Tiancang. Now, all the members of the Wei clan were here. While they didn\u2019t have decision making powers, their presence would affect Wei Tiancang\u2019s decision.\u201cLet me say this, vice-potentate.\u201d Li Tianming didn\u2019t want to make things difficult for Mu Yang. Some things, you had to do yourself.In the first place, he didn\u2019t find anything wrong to ask his grandfather to help his mother. Even if it wasn\u2019t his grandfather and it was an ordinary relative, he wouldn\u2019t find it embarrassing either.Li Tianming directly met Wei Tiancang in the eyes and said steadily. \u201cThis junior is called Li Tianming. I\u2019m here for the purpose of pleading with the Sanctum Potentate to save my mother.\u201dThose words sowed even more confusion. Wei Tiancang wasn\u2019t a doctor either, so how could he save someone? Furthermore, this was some unrelated person.\u201cAnd what is your mother\u2019s name?\u201d Wei Tiancang\u2019s raspy voice was very unpleasant to the ears, like metal grinding against metal.\u201cWei Jing.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 78": "Chapter 78 - You Don't Deserve To Be A Father!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe entire Wei Manor changed when Li Tianming spoke that name. If it was like a quiet lake previously, then it felt like boiling magma now, ready to erupt any time.Other than Vice-Potentate Mu Yang, who had known about this earlier, the rest of the Wei Clan was caught by surprise. But everyone knew that it was just the calm before the storm. To them, the name was a taboo topic in front of Wei Tiancang since twenty years ago. And to make things worse, her son, Li Tianming, was right in front of them now!The mainstays of the Wei Manor, including Wei Tianxiong, Wei Qing and Wei Zikun had turned into statues. Their thoughts froze up, and none of them even dared to look at Wei Tiancang\u2019s expression right now.That was especially true for Wei Zikun, who felt like he had just heard a fairy tale. Because of the event three years ago, he had already heard of Li Tianming, but he had never in his wildest dream imagined that Li Tianming to be his very own nephew.As for the younger generations like Wei Guohao and Wei Lingxuan, they had no idea what happened back then. But even then, they had heard the story: they used to have an aunt who was evicted from the clan, and was never heard of since then.Of course, it would be easy for them to search for Wei Jing\u2019s location given their power. But Wei Tiancang had strictly forbade anyone to look for or even contact her, and anyone in the family knew how much Wei Tiancang wanted to avoid that name. It wasn\u2019t hard to imagine how much of an impact his fallout with Wei Jing had twenty years ago!Twenty years had passed, and the one that disappeared two decades ago had never returned. But here and now, a teenager claiming to be her son, had appeared in front of Wei Tiancang\u2019s face.\u201cMy mother got the Lifesbane twenty years ago, and she doesn\u2019t have much time left. She has returned to Ignispolis with me, and I plead for the Potentate to save her life. If you can save her, I am willing to do anything for the clan,\u201d Despite the pressure that the entire Wei Clan was showing him, Li Tianming said earnestly. A teenager facing an entire powerhouse, filled with some of the strongest cultivators in the entire nation like Wei Tianxiong and Wei Qing, and he could still voice out his request calmly. Such an act needed guts, and a whole lot of it!The moment he said that was the moment the storm within the Wei Manor broke. Earlier on, Wei Tiancang had closed his eyes, and only when Li Tianming spoke his request did he open them. In that moment, Li Tianming felt like the whole world was crushing him, an unimaginable weight falling on his shoulders. He could feel his organs being squeezed, his beast ki and blood flowing wildly in his body. His body was being torn apart!That Wei Tiancang in front of him was no longer just any elderly old man, but a dreadful beast that loomed over him. In comparison, Li Tianming felt like he was just a tiny ant.\u201cShe had Lifesbane for twenty years?!\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Clearly, this was something new to them, even to Wei Tiancang who was still applying pressure in him.Li Tianming continued to withstand this tremendous stress that Wei Tiancang was causing him, his eyes fixed onto Wei Tiancang\u2019s! Even then, he still had the guts to say one more time, \u201cShe doesn't have much time left. I beg you to save her, and my life is yours if you do.\u201dEven if Wei Tiancang no longer treated her as his daughter, Li Tianming hoped that Wei Tiancang would still find saving a life a kind act that was worthy of his time. Li Tianming knew that the Wei Manor had no interest in his life, but that was all that he had as he didn\u2019t have any other bargaining chips he could use to fight for Wei Jing\u2019s survival.The onlookers observed Wei Tiancang\u2019s reactions, and some of the younger ones didn\u2019t even dare to raise their head up from the pressure that he was emitting.\u201cMu Yang!\u201d Wei Tiancang suddenly roared, shaking the Wei Manor.\u201cYes master.\u201d Mu Yang threw a pitiful glance at Li Tianming.\u201cEvict this person from Ignispolis together with his mother, and make sure they never come back again!\u201d Wei Tiancang\u2019s voice was hoarse and swelled with rage! No one could even remember when was the last time they saw Wei Tiancang lose his calm like this.Wei Tiancang had outright rejected Li Tianming, essentially pronouncing Wei Jing\u2019s death sentence. Li Tianming was optimistic before this, thinking that any father would not possibly see their own daughter die. But Wei Tiancang\u2019s reactions had astounded him. This was the exact feeling Li Tianming had when facing Li Yanfeng! It was no wonder both Wei Jing and Mu Yang, who knew Wei Tiancang well enough, claimed that such a plan was bound to fail.Was this the true nature of the Potentate of Heaven\u2019s Sanctum? Li Tianming was not just saddened, but also resentful, just like how he resented Li Yanfeng.\u201cSo you are just going to watch her die? You don\u2019t deserve to be a father!\u201d Li Tianming had tried his best to contain himself. But alas, his care for Wei Jing didn\u2019t allow him to just ignore Wei Tiancang\u2019s response. He just had to vent out his frustration.\u201cSilence!\u201d\u201cHow dare you!\u201dThe members of the Wei Clan were filled with indignation. How would they have expected a random boy would dare to cross Wei Tiancang?\u201cMaster, don\u2019t mind him. He\u2019s just too anxious right now, I will take him out now.\u201d Mu Yang reacted immediately, pressing his hands onto Li Tianming\u2019s shoulders. For some reason, Li Tianming felt like he could no longer talk when Mu Yang did that.It was indeed a shame, Mu Yang thought. Today was one of the rare occasions that Wei Tiancang could be happy, but he had screwed things up by bringing Li Tianming here. He dragged Li Tianming along hurriedly, on the brink of leaving the Wei Manor. Even he himself had underestimated Wei Tiancang\u2019s reactions, and how hard it was to save Wei Jing.\u201cNo, wait!\u201d But before they could leave, the hoarse voice sounded once again. Mu Yang could only turn to face him together with Li Tianming.The light emanating from Wei Tiancang\u2019s eyes was like a radiant beam of sunlight, scorching Li Tianming\u2019s own. Even then, Li Tianming returned the glare without blinking once. He didn\u2019t even fear death, so why should he fear a mere Sanctum Potentate?\u201cMembers of the Wei Manor shall not die like wild dogs on the street! If she were to die, she must die in this manor.\u201d Wei Tiancang\u2019s voice echoed in the hall.\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d Wei Tiancang stared at Li Tianming.\u201cLi Tianming.\u201d He gritted his teeth.\u201cTianming my ass! You shall spend the rest of your life in the manor too. I will not let you run around claiming yourself as a member of the Wei Clan!\u201d Wei Tiancang was like a tyrant as he made his demands.\u201cAnd why should I claim to be part of the clan? Is it supposed to be an honor? Cause I find it a bloody shame,\u201d Li Tianming spat back. What did Wei Tiancang want, imprisoning the two of them in Wei Manor forever?As for Mu Yang, he could feel his head buzzing. Just spoke one line from Li Tianming and the boy managed to offend Wei Tiancang again.\u201cTianxiong, clear the Rainforest Pavilion and make it out of bounds. Throw the two inside there, and make sure no one goes in or out from now on.\u201d With that said, Wei Tiancang rose to his feet, and turned to leave the hall without saying another word.No one dared to make a move until he completely vanished off into the distance. Only when Wei Tiancang left did the tension in the hall ease off a bit.\u201cOh, Mu Yang, you really should have told me about this first.\u201d Wei Tianxiong sounded exasperated.\u201cI didn\u2019t know today was Xuan\u2019er\u2019s birthday, and the master would leave the Highcloud Chamber. I did want to inform you about this before heading to his chamber. How would I know that he figured out this boy\u2019s relationship with Wei Jing at one glance\u2026\u201d Mu Yang was helpless about it too.Li Tianming found out about that too, given that Wei Tiancang\u2019s expressions changed the moment he saw Li Tianming.\u201cNow what?\u201d Wei Tianxiong said.\u201cWhat else can we do? I will bring Jing\u2019er back first and lock her up in the Rainforest Pavilion, and we will see what we can do.\u201d Wei Tianxiong sighed, but he could only agree with Mu Yang. After all, they could never disobey Wei Tiancang\u2019s orders.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

And now he\u2019s making people clean it up. Does elder brother intend to save her or not?\u201d Wei Qing couldn\u2019t make heads or tails of it.\u201cWho knows? However, it was so hard to make him happy for a bit, and now this happened. I expect our coming days to not be so peaceful,\u201d Wei Tianxiong said.\u201cDid he say second sis has Lifesbane and doesn\u2019t have much longer left?\u201d Wei Zikun said.\u201cLet\u2019s wait for Mu Yang to bring her back.\u201dWei Zikun was slightly gloomy. \u201cDo you think father will forgive her?\u201d\u201cHow could that be? She hasn\u2019t returned for twenty years, returning only when she\u2019s about to die. You saw how he reacted. You think it's possible?\u201d\u201cThen, what do you think?\u201d Wei Zikun asked.\u201cIt\u2019ll be good if she doesn\u2019t return.\u201d\u201cBig brother, I feel the same as you. She can\u2019t be forgiven after what she did to father,\u201d Wei Zikun said.\u201cMu Yang, you won\u2019t be happy that I said that, right?\u201d Wei Tianxiong looked at Mu Yang who hadn\u2019t left yet.\u201cYour thoughts have nothing to do with me. I\u2019ll get Wei Jing first.\u201d Mu Yang left Li Tianming behind for them to escort to Rainforest Pavilion, while he brought Wei Jing back. He had happened to ask Li Tianming about her residence before coming to Wei Manor. Who knew that it would be useful at such a juncture?Mu Yang turned and left, leaving Li Tianming to face the whole Wei family by himself.They were all his relatives. Wei Tianxiong and Wei Zikun were his uncles, while Wei Guohao, Wei Lingxuan and the rest were his cousins. Normally, they should have grown up together. He had held out some hope before coming to meet these relatives.However, now, he knew he had just been indulging in fantasy.\u201cGuohao, bring them away, lest they embarrass us even further,\u201d Wei Tianxiong said mildly.\u201cYes, father.\u201d Wei Guohao nodded, before approaching Li Tianming. \u201cFollow and behave yourself. Don\u2019t think of running away. If you don\u2019t behave, you\u2019ll have no choice but to suffer.\u201d\u201cAh, what a party pooper. I only have one birthday a year to make grandfather happy, but some contemptible person just had to ruin it.\u201d Wei Lingxuan came along as well.Li Tianming followed them.With the younger generation of Wei Manor led by Wei Guohao, the others followed his lead and joined in.\u201cSister Xuan, why did you call him contemptible?\u201d\u201cHaven\u2019t you heard of the infamous Li Tianming? He was already an institute disciple three years ago. He tried to chase Lin Xiaoting\u2019s girlfriend and failed. So, he tried to drug and violate her. Fortunately, Lin Xiaoting got there in time and executed his lifebound beast,\u201d Wei Lingxuan said disdainfully.\u201c\u2018Disgusting. What a scary person!\u201d Wei Zikun\u2019s eldest, Wei Qingyi said exaggeratedly.\u201cWhat an embarrassment for such a person to be related by blood to us.\u201d Wei Guohao gave Li Tianming a cold sneer.Wei Lingxuan curled her lips. \u201cI bet I can guess why grandfather kicked out his mother. Like mother, like son, they say.\u201d\u201cDo you believe I\u2019ll smack you until your face swells up and you can\u2019t spew any more nonsense?\u201d Li Tianming suddenly turned around and stared at Wei Lingxuan.\u201cOhhh, how scary!\u201d Wei Lingxuan pretended to be flustered as she hid herself in the crowd.\u201cSister Xuan! Better hide quickly. This person must be super duper strong to say such words!\u201d\u201cPerhaps he\u2019s a genius just pretending to be weak. Don\u2019t look at how he\u2019s about third level Spiritsource. If he makes a move, Sister Xuan may be taken down in one hit.\u201d\u201cAt that time, maybe he\u2019ll stun us all. How about we give him a preview of what that\u2019ll be like?\u201d\u201cCome, altogether now.\u201d They all gathered and looked at Li Tianming, before sighing in praise.\u201cWowzers, I did not think Li Tianming was this strong.\u201d\u201cOhmigosh, he took one hit, just one hit!\u201d\u201cMy god, he sent Brother Hao flying with one breath!\u201dWei Qingyi shook in laughter. If it hadn\u2019t been inappropriate, perhaps they would have collapsed to the floor in their laughter.\u201cI simply can\u2019t believe a newly joined disciple is actually so strong. I\u2019m so scared now. I won\u2019t dare to do it again!\u201d Wei Lingxuan caused another round of laughter.All of the drama queens had plastered on exaggerated expressions.\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you saying anything, Li Tianming? Are you fantasizing of actually beating us one day?\u201d Wei Guohao smiled at him.\u201cWhatever you say.\u201d Li Tianming curled his lips.\u2018Well, at least your imagination is strong. A lot of newly joined people really don\u2019t understand the gap between them and us who\u2019ve been in Heaven\u2019s Sanctum since young. Wei Qingyi here is seventeen, three years younger than you. But he\u2019s fifth level Spiritsource, and can beat you anytime, anyday. Everyone here is more talented than you,\u201d Wei Guohao continued mockingly.\u201cAlright, alright sheesh. You all are the bigliest talents, ok?\u201d Li Tianming said indifferently. However to him, since he could return to Ignispolis and become a prime disciple, the day he closed the gap was just a month or two away.He just had to wait and see.Even if he was locked away in Wei Manor, it wasn\u2019t like he couldn\u2019t cultivate and become stronger. Since they had already done a dry run, they could compare notes on the differences with the real thing later on.At Li Tianming\u2019s current rate of improvement, could Wei Manor cage him in?\u2026\u2026They reached Rainforest Pavilion that had been deserted for twenty years. Various servants were already cleaning it up, and the guards arranged by Wei Tianxiong were already stationed there. Two people would guard in shifts, not letting Li Tianming and Wei Jing leave,\u201cGo in. I don\u2019t understand why it needed to be cleaned. The filthy Pavilion is a perfect fit for you.\u201d Wei Guohao\u2019s face was filled with dislike.Li Tianming couldn\u2019t be bothered with him, as he examined the place that should have been where Wei Jing grew up.\u201cXiao Gao, Zhao Jin. Watch him well, he\u2019s not to take even one step out. An old one will come soon too, and same for her,\u201d Wei Guohao instructed the two middle-aged men there.\u201cYes, young master Guohao. We\u2019ve already received instructions from the chancellor.\u201d The two hurriedly nodded their heads.\u201cAlright, let\u2019s go. Let's continue celebrating Xuan\u2019er\u2019s birthday. Let\u2019s not come back here ever again!\u201dThe crowd of youths all left, chortling, their mood a complete opposite to the taciturn Li Tianming.He saw many reflections of his mother in the layout of the place.The servants worked quickly, and the place was soon livable. The master bedroom in particular was spruced up well, whether on Wei Tianxiong or Wei Tiancang\u2019s orders.The servants quickly departed once they finished their work.Half an hour later, Li Tianming heard footsteps. Mu Yang was lending his mother an arm to support her as she walked in.\u201cMother,\u201d Li Tianming called.Wei Jing smiled at him gently.\u201cI failed,\u201d Li Tianming said.\u201cYou didn\u2019t,\u201d Wei Jing said gently.\u201cI really did.\u201d\u201cLook, isn\u2019t this where I\u2019ve been dreaming of returning to even in my dreams?\u201d Wei Jing looked around, emotions and memories clouding her eyes.\u201cTianming, take care of your mother. I\u2019ll go visit master, I feel like there\u2019s some chance,\u201d Mu Yang said.\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t understand. Master isn\u2019t the truly heartless type. Now that Jing\u2019er is back, they\u2019ll have chances to interact. At least, the chances of him saving her are higher than kicking you out of Ignispolis. There would be no chance left if she was kicked out of Ignispolis.\u201dLi Tianming thought so too. That was why he hadn\u2019t been worried when Wei Jing was sentenced to life imprisonment. What was that in the face of his mother living on?\u2026\u2026Highcloud Chamber was not only the best place for cultivation, but also had the biggest fish pond in Wei Manor. Currently, there was an white-haired old man fishing by the pondside. Alas, he wasn\u2019t calm, and his fishing rod kept trembling. If he actually caught something, it would be a minor miracle.\u201cElder brother, so are you saving her or not?!\u201d The Heavenly Guardian of Sanctions, Wei Qing, was lazily lying down on a rock and stretching, the severe aura that usually surrounded him now entirely absent.\u201cWhen Jing\u2019er was young, you always treated her like your treasure. You spoilt her for twenty years and didn\u2019t let anyone touch her. You couldn\u2019t possibly just watch as she leaves this world in suffering, right? There\u2019s no outsiders or juniors here, so just be frank with your little brother,\u201d Wei Qing jabbered on.Wei Tiancang threw the fishing rod on the ground loudly, snorting in anger, \u201cHow dare she be so obstinate! She\u2019s had Lifesbane for twenty years, but still refused to come back. Still, in the end, who\u2019s the one who came back to beg for help?\u201dWei Qing rolled his eyes.\u201cWell, you were the one who couldn\u2019t control your temper and was so fierce, cutting off all her paths with a few vicious words. I wouldn\u2019t dare return if I was Jing\u2019er either.\u201d\u201cNonsense. Was I so fierce?\u201d Wei Tiancang asked doubtfully.\u201cWhat do you think? It\u2019s been twenty years. We\u2019re all old codgers now, so please start moving on. Sure, I do agree Jing\u2019er was partly at fault, but she\u2019s suffered from Lifesbane for twenty years. Isn\u2019t that enough? Just give me a clear answer so I can relax. Save, or not save?\u201d Wei Qing asked.These pair of brothers were already in their sixties and seventies. There weren\u2019t any outsiders here, so they were as blunt as they wanted to be.\u201cOf course I will. That\u2019s my daughter.\u201d Wei Tiancang gritted his teeth.\u201cThen why all the shouting and bluster?\u201d\u201cWhat about my face? She\u2019s been gone for twenty years, and if I\u2019m too eager to save her immediately, how embarrassing will that be?\u201d\u201cDear brother, you were the one who forbade anyone from looking for her. And a certain someone said she was not to step one foot in Ignispolis ever again.\u201d\u201c...\u201dStill angry, Wei Tiancang jabbed the fishing rod at the lake before sitting down in exhaustion. \u201cShe could last twenty years. She\u2019ll last another with Mu Yang. I\u2019ll save her when she comes and apologises to me.\u201d\u201cDoes she have to in public, say how she was wrong, and shouldn\u2019t have been disobedient to her father and chosen Li Yanfeng?\u201d\u201cThen?\u201d\u201cWhatever. It\u2019s up to you. It\u2019s your daughter that\u2019s suffering, not mine.\u201d Wei Qing shrugged.\u201cCould you have a daughter as pretty as mine?\u201d\u201cIs she prettier now? Still boasting?\u201d\u201c......\u201d\u201cStill, your two sons seem to hate Jing\u2019er.\u201d\u201cIt has nothing to do with them.\u201d\u201cWell Mu Yang is impressive, forgetting old enmities like that.\u201d\u201cYes, Jing\u2019er and I owe Mu Yang too much,\u201d Wei Tiancang said.\u201cIt\u2019s all in the past. Mu Yang is enjoying the simple life now, no?\u201d Wei Qing smiled, before remembering the young man from earlier. \u201cHow do you find her son, your grandson?\u201d\u201cWhat kind of genius could trash like Li Yanfeng raise? He\u2019s joined Heaven\u2019s Sanctum, but his age is high and his stage is low. He\u2019s much worse than Wei Qingyi!\u201d Wei Tiancang said.\u201cThat you\u2019re wrong. You don\u2019t know what happened to him three years ago. I just found out myself.\u201d\u201cWhat happened?\u201dWei Qing ran through it.\u201cThis is his stage after starting from scratch. Even if he started the year he lost his lifebound beast, it\u2019s been three years at most. Three years to train back to third or fourth level Spiritsource is decent.\u201d\u201cNot growing up Wei Manor, lacking my personal guidance. He even lost his Four-Winged Goldroc and only has a wildbeast lifebound beast. How far he can go is limited. If he even accomplishes half of Wei Qingyi, it\u2019ll be great already.\u201d Wei Tiancang said with certainty.\u201cTrue. But this child also has some integrity issues. That matter three years ago has spread far and wide.\u201d Wei Qing sighed.\u201cWrong,\u201d Wei Tiancang said.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201dWei Tiancang frowned.\u201cThe child I saw today wasn\u2019t that sort.\u201d\u201cSure?\u201d\u201cSure. That child had a stubborn look in his eye and was also upright. He\u2019s not the vulgar sort,\u201d Wei Tiancang said.\u201cThen that\u2019ll be interesting.\u201d Wei Qing said.\u201cHmph. That little chickling dared to talk back to me, I\u2019ll have to test him.\u201d\u201cHow?\u201d\u201cOh, you\u2019ll see.\u201dSuddenly, someone knocked on the door. \u201cMaster, can I come in?\u201d\u201cMu Yang is here. I\u2019ll skedaddle first!\u201d Wei Qing immediately vanished.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 80": "Chapter 80 - Azure DomainPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLi Tianming helped his mother settle down after Mu Yang left. Since they were already here, they might as well make themselves comfortable.Wei Jing remained restless. This was the place that she had grown up in, and contained two decades of memories. Although movement was inconvenient for her, she still couldn\u2019t resist touring around.Ying Huo had also been feeling depressed, cooped up inside the lifebound beast space. As soon as he got out, he began bouncing around the pavilion.It started drizzling outside.\u201cMother, do you think he\u2019ll save you?\u201d Li Tianming asked.\u201cI don\u2019t want to think about it. However, I do have to thank him for letting me back, as this has indeed been a dream of mine.\u201d Wei Jing wasn\u2019t broken-hearted at all.\u201cI was a little impulsive today. If I get the chance, I\u2019ll ask him again.\u201d Li Tianming did think he had gone a bit too far today. Still, he couldn\u2019t understand why Wei Tiancang had been so heartless.\u201cBrother Yang has already gone over. So just wait,\u201d Wei Jing comforted.\u201cHmph, that old codger is pretty stubborn. Just wait, I'll pluck that beard of his. Hair. By. Hair! Oh and then I\u2019ll strip off his underpants and set \u2018em on fire!\u201d the little chick said, filled with righteous indignation.Li Tianming rolled his eyes.\u201cYeah yeah, keep bragging.\u201dMu Yang returned after a while. Although Wei Tiancang had forbidden anyone from entering, Mu Yang flouted those rules. Crossing the curtain for blocking rain, he approached Wei Jing. His eyes trembled somewhat upon seeing Wei Jing\u2019s aged face.\u201cAny good news?\u201d Wei Jing placed her hands on her knees, lifting her head to look at him. Even with her unnatural aging, she didn\u2019t act any inferior when facing old acquaintances.\u201cKind of,\u201d Mu Yang said.\u2018What is it?\u201d\u201cHe promised not to imprison Tianming anymore. He can return to Heaven\u2019s Sanctum and also come here to visit you. However, the condition is that he can\u2019t reveal his identity outside. Otherwise, he won\u2019t be allowed out of Rainforest Pavilion again. So, in essence, he\u2019s free,\u201d Mu Yang said.If so, it meant the aftermath of today wasn\u2019t that bad.\u201cHe\u2019s overthinking things. My son doesn\u2019t care for the identity of Wei Manor.\u201d\u201cDid he agree to save my mother?\u201d Li Tianming asked anxiously.\u201cHe said it was impossible. He won\u2019t see you again. He also said\u2026\u201d Mu Yang hesitated.\u201cIt\u2019s alright, just convey to me what he said.\u201d Wei Jing said.\u201cHe said let him know when you die. He\u2019ll inter you in the Wei clan\u2019s family tombs.\u201d Mu Yang lowered his head.Frankly, Li Tianming gnashed his teeth after hearing that. He had assumed Wei Tiancang might have a hard exterior but soft on the inside, but it turned out not to be.\u201cThen, help me thank him,\u201d Wei Jing said.\u201cDon\u2019t give up yet, Jing\u2019er. I\u2019ll try my best to convince him. When it's necessary, I\u2019ll arrange for you to meet him so you can apologise,\u201d Mu Yang said earnestly.\u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d Wei Jing bit her lips. Would she have stayed away for twenty years if apologising was so easy?\u201cWhat can I do, Vice-Potentate?\u201d Li Tianming asked. He knew Mu Yang was helping, but it wasn\u2019t in his nature to sit by the side and twiddle his thumbs.\u201cYou? We\u2019ll see. For the time being, don\u2019t worry. I can stop the eruption of her Lifesbane for now. It would help her hold on for a little longer and reduce her suffering. But that\u2019s a short term solution. In the long term, an expert with a blood relation is needed to remove it,\u201d Mu Yang said seriously.\u201cThank you!\u201d Li Tianming felt himself relax.\u201cNo need to be so polite with me. Your mother and I used to be\u2026 the best of friends.\u201d Mu Yang stumbled on his words half way through.\u201cWere you two exes?\u201d The little chick had been watching by the side, and finally found an opportunity to cut in.Mu Yang and Wei Jing weren\u2019t young, and easily dismissed the little chick\u2019s words with a laugh.\u201cTianming, help your mother to her room. I\u2019ll help examine her Lifesbane.\u201d Mu Yang directed.Li Tianming nodded.\u201cYou don\u2019t need to do so much. I\u2019m good just staying here. It\u2019s not very appropriate when you have your own family\u2026\u201d Wei Jing was troubled.\u201cJing\u2019er, how is that so?\u201d Mu Yang shook his head, \u201cI don\u2019t have my own family yet. I only have a little sister, Wan\u2019er.\u201dWei Jing trembled slightly.\u201cYou\u2019re not married yet?\u201d\u201cNope.\u201d\u201c...\u201dHaving hit forty without getting married was abnormal, especially given Mu Yang\u2019s handsome looks, high talent and future status as Sanctum Potentate.\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no specific reason. I just haven\u2019t had a fated encounter yet.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d\u201cTianming,\u201d Mu Yang turned and called out to Li Tianming.Li Tianming helped his mother up and to the master bedroom. Mu Yang was powerful and also seemed to have an understanding towards Lifesbane. Letting him look was definitely beneficial.After they went in, Li Tianming waited outside.As for the little chick, it was now in a new environment, so it had gone to the pond to catch fish with great gusto...Half an hour passed before Mu Yang came out, closing the door. \u201cShe\u2019s asleep.\u201dHe let out a deep breath, leaning on the pillar with arms crossed, his gaze on Li Tianming.\u201cHow is it?\u201d Li Tianming asked.\u201cIt\u2019s been twenty years. The Lifebane has taken root in her bones. I can\u2019t fix it, only master can. And even he will struggle to do so. It\u2019ll take great effort and time from him.\u201d\u201cAre there ways to temporarily extend her life and make her more comfortable?\u201d Li Tianming asked.\u201cThat you don\u2019t need to worry about. I can suppress its spread. I\u2019ll find some spirit herbs tomorrow to do so. It won\u2019t be a problem for at least a year.\u201dBefore, lasting even a month was difficult with only Li Tianming and his clear spirit grass. However, now, a year was easy with Mu Yang\u2019s help. This all pointed to Li Tianming seeking Mu Yang\u2019s help to be the correct decision. His help was most likely needed too, if they were to reverse Wei Tiancang\u2019s decision.Li Tianming had already thanked him multiple times, so he didn\u2019t say anymore. However, he had already marked him as a benefactor.\u201cLeave your mother\u2019s matter to me. Tianming, I have some things I want to ask about you.\u201d Mu Yang\u2019s eyes shone.\u201cSure.\u201d\u201cYou should be aware that my third disciple is Lin Xiaoting of Lightning Manor. I heard you have a grudge with him three years ago. Tell me more,\u201d Mu Yang asked.\u201cWill you believe me and not your disciple?\u201d Li Tianming asked.\u201cI believe only the truth, the facts,\u201d Mu Yang said bluntly.\u201cYour sister Mu Wan was my chief mentor three years ago as well. She knows the truth. Did she tell you the origin of Lin Xiaoting\u2019s Saintbeast War-Soul?\u201d Li Tianming asked.\u201cShe did, but I didn\u2019t believe her before. Until I met you.\u201d\u201cAnd now?\u201d\u201cTell me the details,\u201d Mu Yang pressed.Mu Yang was Lin Xiaoting\u2019s supernal mentor. If he knew the truth, it would be easier for Li Tianming in the future. Li Tianming pondered for a moment and then spilled the beans.Afterwards, Mu Yang wordlessly looked at Li Tianming for a long while, eyes narrowed.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Li Tianming asked.\u201cYou could still soldier on even after such a blow?\u201d Mu Yang spoke, praise within his words.\u201cWell, I have her.\u201d Li Tianming looked at Wei Jing\u2019s room, before turning back to Mu Yang. \u201cSo, do you choose to believe your disciple or me?\u201d\u201cWhere did you find the Saintbeast War-Soul in the Abyssal Battlefield?\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cJust say it.\u201d\u201cAzure Domain,\u201d Li Tianming replied.\u201cThen I have my answer.\u201d\u201cHow so?\u201d\u201cLin Xiaoting said he had found it in Ginblue Domain. But I\u2019ve stayed there for three years before, and I don\u2019t believe there can be a War-Soul there. However, dangers abound in Azure Domain, so the chances are higher there.\u201d With these words, it was evident that his final choice was to trust Li Tianming.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 81": "Chapter 81 - Blazing Dragon ChainbladePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cDo you want me to help you with your revenge?\u201d Mu Yang asked.Li Tianming shook his head. \u201cNope.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cIt will be meaningless unless I kill him with my own hands. Besides, he's your disciple, and I don\u2019t want you to dirty your hands,\u201d Li Tianming replied.\u201cYou want to kill him? Do you know how big the gap is between the two of you?\u201d Mu Yang asked.\u201cI don\u2019t need to know, since I will eventually catch up.\u201d Li Tianming smiled with unreadable confidence.\u201cAre you sure? At your current level?\u201d Mu Yang didn\u2019t want to look down on him, but the truth was undeniable.\u201cOf course.\u201d\u201cThen I will sit back and watch. To be honest, I\u2019d say you are dreaming.\u201dLi Tianming laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s perfectly normal. I\u2019d be more worried if you believe that I can do it.\u201d\u201cConfident, eh? But let me give you one word of advice.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m listening,\u201d Li Tianming said.\u201cDon\u2019t be impulsive, wait for your chance. If your mother has to prepare your funeral, your enemy\u2019s going to get off scot-free.\u201d\u201cI will keep that in mind.\u201d Li Tianming nodded. But he felt that Mu Yang had no idea how strong his burning hatred was. Rage, impulse... these words were insufficient to describe it \u2014 and when the time came, it would be with a frightening calm that he faced his foe.\u201cCare for a drink?\u201d Mu Yang produced two jugs of liquor and placed it on the table in the yard.\u201cWhy not?\u201d\u201cInteresting, I haven\u2019t met anyone who could surpass me in drinking.\u201d Mu Yang smiled.\u201cThen today I will prove to you that you have never met anyone who could drink.\u201d\u201cYoung man, cockiness has a price.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll see who\u2019s going to pay.\u201d\u201cHaha\u2026\u201dWith the blood of the Primordial Chaos Beasts and the Aeternal Infernal Body, Li Tianming could handle the strongest alcohol. And so, the two drank to their hearts content within Rainforest Pavilion.\u201cNot bad, not bad!\u201d Mu Yang exclaimed.\u201cNothing to brag about.\u201dMu Yang suddenly realised that Li Tianming wasn\u2019t that impetuous, hot-headed young man he\u2019d imagined. He was, in fact, composed and thoughtful, and it was hard for outsiders to read what he was thinking.\u201cBack at the Hall of Ancestry, I saw Wei Guohao destroy your weapon.\u201d They had been drinking for quite a while and even Mu Yang was getting slightly dizzy.\u201cYes, that guy clearly didn\u2019t want to give me any chance.\u201d Li Tianming\u2019s face was slightly flushed too.\u201cI do have a weapon that may suit you, take it.\u201d As he spoke, Mu Yang took out a beastial weapon and tossed it at Li Tianming.\u201cI never congratulated Jing\u2019er for her marriage and her child, so just keep this as a gift.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to find a reason to give me a present. I generally just accept all gifts.\u201d Li Tianming smiled as he picked up that weapon.\u201cA grade five weapon?\u201d Li Tianming saw the blue heavenly patterns on the weapon and asked. A mysterious power, furious and powerful, seemed to be oozing out of the patterns.\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Mu Yang nodded. Back at the ranking test, Lin Xiaoxiao and Chen Yao both had grade four weapons, which were superior to Li Tianming\u2019s Thunderfire Chain. And when he faced off against Wei Guohao, the weapon just shattered on the spot. All these pointed at the fact that the Thunderfire Chain was no longer enough to support Li Tianming\u2019s current level.He would have been much stronger with a grade four weapon. As for grade five ones, those were the strongest weapons that people his age could possibly wield. Many beastmasters only owned such weapons after reaching Unity.Even the Goldfault Sword that Wei Tiancang gifted Wei Lingxuan for her eighteenth birthday was a grade five weapon \u2014 it went without saying just how precious this gift from Mu Yang was.\u201cWhat\u2019s it called?\u201d Asked Li Tianming.\u201cBlazing Dragon Chainblade.\u201dIt was a crimson chain even thicker and longer than the Thunderfire Chain. The Thunderfire Chain was made from metal rings that were linked onto each other, while this Blazing Dragon Chainblade had round scale-like pieces joined together instead. The scales had razor sharp edges, and it was not hard to imagine the damage it could cause when it tangled its foes.The tip of the chainblade, a sharp blade resembling the tip of a spear, also had a unique design. With it, the Blazing Dragon Chainblade would pierce through its enemies with tremendous ease.\u201cThe Blazing Dragon Chainblade is effectively made up of two different grade five beastial weapons, namely the chain part and the Blazing Dragon Fang part.\u201d Mu Yang pointed at the tip of the chainblade. The addition of the fang had no doubt enhanced the flexibility of this weapon, and gave Li Tianming more versatility in attacking.\u201cThe raw material used for this weapon was crimson quartz. It was forged with blazing dragonfire, and finally infused with the blood of a Blazing Dragon. The quality of this weapon is better than most other grade five weapons, and all the spirit ores and hazards used in its production had blue heavenly patterns.\u201dAs Mu Yang introduced this weapon, Li Tianming waved it a few times. This weapon clearly suited him, and it was far better than the Thunderfire Chain to boot. With the spirit hazard, the blazing dragonfire burning on the chains, Li Tianming even felt like he was controlling a real fanged dragon.\u201cFinally, here is our Disciple\u2019s Order for the sanctum, freshly made.\u201d Mu Yang tossed a white medallion at him.Li Tianming caught it and felt its weight. He knew that this was a proof of identity for a disciple of the sanctum, and the order itself was made out of high-grade spirit ores. It was impossible for an outsider to replicate the item. On its front, the word \u2018Heaven\u2019s Sanctum\u2019 was stylishly written on it, while on the back the name Li Tianming was engraved into the stone, proving that this order was his and his only.Li Tianming had read about such orders before, and he knew that other than his name, there was supposed to be one more name as well. That would be the name of his supernal mentor, but currently he did not have one.\u201cYou may not have a supernal mentor, but that shouldn\u2019t stop you from cultivating in Flameyellow Pagoda. This order would also allow you to collect battle arts, martial arts, weapons, spirit ores, spirit herbs, spirit hazards as per normal,\u201d Mu Yang explained.\u201cFrom now on, just leave your mother to me. If you focus on cultivating, you may reach the average standard for youths in the Wei Manor. If your performance is impressive, maybe my master will even reconsider his words and give you a chance to talk to him.\u201d Mu Yang rose to his feet. He had everything arranged for Li Tianming.\u201cAverage standard?\u201d Li Tianming remembered every word Mu Yang said. He knew Mu Yang was talking about his talent. He may have put up an excellent show back during the ranking test, but that wouldn\u2019t hide the fact that he was already twenty. And in the Wei Manor, the average standards of a twenty year old should at least be able to beat Wei Lingxuan who was just eighteen.Li Tianming was only at first level Spiritsource, and the difference was obvious. Luckily, the difference in strength wasn\u2019t that big. If he could compare with those youngsters raised in the manor, Wei Tiancang would definitely not look down on him like he did today.Mu Yang was right in that Wei Tiancang wasn\u2019t the friendly old grandpa that he had imagined. He wasn\u2019t going to listen to Li Tianming, unless Li Tianming showed him what he was capable of. That was Li Tianming\u2019s only way to save his mother!Mother was still in the Wei Manor, and Li Tianming needed the power to protect her from all the demeaning words his \u2018relatives\u2019 were throwing at them. Mu Yang had pointed out the path for him, which was to cultivate and get stronger. While he couldn\u2019t help with his mother's situation, he had made it to the sanctum \u2014 it was time to make good use of the resources here to give himself a good boost!Furthermore, Mu Qingqing, Chen Yao and Xing Que were all inside the sanctum! If he could improve fast enough, then he would soon catch up with those of his age, and become strong enough to enact revenge. When the rest of the disciples were grovelling at his feet, could the Potentate still disregard him the way he did today? Li Tianming could feel his passion burning.\u201cVice-Potentate, just one last time. Lin Xiaoting is your disciple, so are you sure you are not going to stop me?\u201d Li Tianming stood up as well, and he too was slightly dizzy from drinking so much.\u201cI told you, I believe in truth and justice. If you can prove your innocence, then I will not take sides,\u201d Mu Yang replied calmly. Then again, he wouldn\u2019t side with Lin Xiaoting in the first place when Li Tianming was Wei Jing\u2019s son\u2026\u2026\u201cOne last question.\u201d Li Tianming stared into his eyes and asked, \u201cBack in the Hall of Ancestry, you mentioned that you will take me as your disciple if I defeat Wei Guohao. Does that still count?\u201d\u201cOf course, I\u2019m not one to take back my words. But let me be honest with you. I don\u2019t think you can match Wei Guohao within the next five years, and there\u2019s no way for you to reach Lin Xiaoting\u2019s in the next ten. They just have too far a head start, and do you really think you can catch up with them?\u201d\u201cDefinitely,\u201d Li Tianming replied without hesitation.\u201cWe shall see.\u201d\u201cSuits me,\u201d Li Tianming said.\u201cI shall take my leave.\u201d\u201cI will send you off.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no need for that.\u201dMu Yang was not one to dilly-dally, and right after finishing his last cup of drink he disappeared from the pavilion.\u201cBro, I have something to say.\u201d The little chick popped up with a perverted look on its face.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI reckon this guy must have really loved our mother back then, and even if she didn\u2019t choose him, he still didn\u2019t give up. Look at him now, single for the past twenty years like a monk. He must really be heartbroken.\u201d Ying Huo grinned as it gossiped.\u201cYou are pretty creative aren\u2019t you?\u201d Li Tianming smiled. It was all stories of the past that younger generations like them did not have to bother with. He only had one question: Why did Wei Jing choose that Li Yanfeng over the handsome Sage Chen or the talented Mu Yang? Surely their lives would have been drastically different if one of the other two had been chosen.\u201cHmm how do you reckon he does that? Does the esteemed Vice-Potentate do it with his own hands or does he visit brothels?\u201d The little chick let its imaginations run wild. If Mu Yang was still here, he might just have strangled the little chick.\u201cYing Huo, do you know how we can make a chicken tastier?\u201d\u201cHuh??\u201d\u201cWe neuter it!\u201d\u201cTsk, just tell me if you are jealous of my manhood.\u201d The little chick\u2019s audacity sure knew no boundaries.Jokes aside, Li Tianming\u2019s cultivation journey in the sanctum had officially begun! Flameyellow Pagoda was the most famous place of cultivation in the nation, renowned for its incredible effects. Li Tianming had always wanted to take a look there, and see what opportunities await him.But before that, he would make a trip to Princess Qing\u2019s place first. His true intention was, of course, to find Jiang Feiling.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 82": "Chapter 82 - Hearts In HarmonyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayEven if Wei Tiancang no longer restricted his movements, Li Tianming didn\u2019t intend to stay in Wei Manor. Right now, walking around the Wei Manor would only bring him unwanted attention. With Mu Yang taking care of Wei Jing, he had nothing to worry about.After saying farewell to his mother, Li Tianming settled down in the residence that Mu Yang had gotten him.\u201cThe vice-potentate must have spent a lot of effort to convince that old man to not lock me up.\u201d Li Tianming knew how determined Wei Tiancang sounded back then.He took out the crumpled slip of paper that Jiang Feiling had given him. After comparing it with the map that Mu Yang gave him, he set off to find Jiang Feiling, Ying Huo at his side.\u201cPrincess Qing\u2019s supernal mentor is called Qin Shi. I heard that she is the strongest female supernal mentor right now.\u201d Li Tianming recalled seeing her at the Hall of Ancestry. Although she was uninterested in him, since she only accepted female disciples, Li Tianming still had a decent impression of her \u2014 she hadn\u2019t insulted him, unlike a certain Liu Xueyao.Inside the sanctum, each supernal mentor had their own allocated area, and their disciples would live inside that area within their own courtyards. As for Li Tianming, who had no supernal mentor, he stayed alone at a corner of the sanctum with no neighbors.Li Tianming\u2019s destination was the Nebulous Pavilion, Supernal Mentor Qin Shi\u2019s territory. He arrived early in the morning, without seeing anyone along the way. Following the instructions on the slip, Li Tianming found himself near the western side of the Nebulous Pavilion. He was looking for a courtyard by the name of \u2018Qingluan Residence\u2019, the residence of Princess Qing and Jiang Feiling.Word had it that ever since Jiang Qingluan entered Heaven\u2019s Sanctum, Jiang Feiling was always by her side. Even though she wasn\u2019t a disciple of the sanctum, the authorities had given her special permission to do what she wanted inside the sanctum. She had no lifebound beasts anyway, so she couldn\u2019t learn anything in the sanctum.\u201cBig brother, I knew you\u2019d be here.\u201d Just as Li Tianming was about to knock on the doors, the door creaked open and a girl in white chiffon pajamas popped out. She stretched and rolled her eyes, clearly having just woken up. Even without any makeup and with her hair still a mess, the girl was a feast to the eyes, especially when she stretched and displayed her fine contours.What a pleasant way to start the day, Li Tianming thought.\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d Another girl walked up behind Jiang Feiling. Compared to Jiang Feiling she was shorter, but she had curves that seemed unfitting of her age.\u201cAHH!\u201d Jiang Qingluan probably didn\u2019t expect Ling\u2019er to open the doors straight away. Before she could even react, Li Tianming had appeared, her skimpily dressed body in full view. For a brief moment, Jiang Qingluan stood there stunned, before letting out a piercing shriek as she ran back into her bedroom.\u201cBig brother, just give us a moment.\u201d Jiang Feiling smiled and closed the doors.\u201cOhhhhhh, no looky looky!\u201d The little chick had covered its eyes with its wings, but that didn\u2019t change the fact that those huge gaps inside its wings pretty much revealed everything.That was surely one way of starting a morning, looking at two beauties with completely different flairs. Li Tianming coughed slightly, and readjusted his posture to look as gentlemanly as possible.\u201cLi Tianming, I don\u2019t think you will be needing your eyes anymore.\u201d The next time the door opened, it was Jiang Qingluan who appeared before him. She had already dressed properly, and she stared at Li Tianming as if she wished to rip a hole in his face.\u201cWhat, do you have a need for them? What are you gonna do, eat them as snacks?\u201d Li Tianming laughed.\u201cScram, we don\u2019t welcome contemptible people like you here,\u201d Jiang Qingluan snapped.\u201cQing\u2019er don\u2019t block the way, let big brother come in.\u201d It was at this moment that Jiang Feiling appeared too, and Li Tianming felt as if the whole world had been brightened up by her. She had changed into a pale blue skirt, leaving her delicate, slender legs exposed. With an enchanting smile on her face, Li Tianming could barely take his eyes off her.At Jiang Feiling\u2019s words, Li Tianming gently pushed aside Jiang Qingluan\u2019s arms, which were blocking the gate, and invited himself into the Qingluan Residence. Within the small hut inside the courtyard, Jiang Qingluan already had tea prepared.\u201cBig brother, have some tea.\u201d She sat down by the table and passed Li Tianming a cup. The tea gave off a faint fragrance, just like that fairy-like girl that was seated in front of him.\u201cThank you, Ling\u2019er.\u201d Li Tianming took a seat too. Every time he met her, he couldn\u2019t help but wonder how such a perfect girl could exist in this world.\u201cLi Tianming, I heard some new stories about you, and pretty funny ones too.\u201d Jiang Qingluan leaned against one of the pillars, and said with an eyebrow raised.\u201cGo ahead, we can have a good laugh,\u201d Li Tianming said.\u201cThe great prime disciple, abandoned by all the supernal mentors. The whole institute is laughing about you now,\u201d Jiang Qingluan said.\u201cHaha, very funny,\u201d Li Tianming mocked.\u201cDo you not have any shame?\u201d Jiang Qingluan sounded slightly annoyed.\u201cOf course I do. What about you? Why are you always trying to disrupt my time with Ling\u2019er? Or do you have ideas for me, and wish to fight with Ling\u2019er over me?\u201d Li Tianming curled his lips.\u201cAre you retarded? I have never seen such a shameless person, and if I don\u2019t keep an eye out for you, who knows what hideous things you may do,\u201d Jiang Qingluan yelled back.Jiang Feiling poured herself and Jiang Qingluan a cup of tea each with a smile. Perhaps the sight of these two fighting the moment they saw each other was amusing to her.\u201cHow can you accuse a gentleman like me?\u201d\u201cIf you were a gentleman, even that chicken would be one,\u201d Jiang Qingluan said with contempt.\u201cWhat do you mean, of course I am a gentlechicken.\u201d The little chick puffed its chest up. Against their shamelessness, Jiang Qingluan could only stomp her feet in frustration.\u201cQing\u2019er, don\u2019t be annoyed. Have a seat and then we can talk.\u201d Jiang Feiling finally managed to calm her down.\u201cEven if I don\u2019t have a supernal mentor, I have already gotten the Disciple\u2019s Order and my cultivation here can proceed normally.\u201d\u201cWow, that\u2019s impressive.\u201d\u201cImpressive? Without a supernal mentor, he can\u2019t do anything in the sanctum without getting pushed around,\u201d Jiang Qingluan interrupted.\u201cThen what? Can Qing\u2019er protect big brother? \u201d Jiang Feiling asked.\u201cYeah I will consider it if he kneels before me and slams his head on the floor.\u201d Jiang Qingluan smirked.\u201cYou might look like my granny, but you sure as hell ain\u2019t one,\u201d Li Tianming replied.Jiang Qingluan realised that this man was entirely incompatible with him when it came to personality. That didn\u2019t mean she found him a bad guy though. Jiang Feiling had told her quite a lot about Li Tianming\u2019s stories regarding the Saintbeast War-Soul and the scandal.\u201cHoho, then you just wait to get wrecked by all the disciples here. Pretty daring of you to provoke the only person in the institute who could possibly cover you,\u201d Jiang Qingluan threatened.\u201cNo biggie. I still have your jade pendant with me, don\u2019t I? It should come in handy,\u201d Li Tianming said.\u201cNow that you mentioned it, return the pendant to me. Now. Immediately.\u201d Jiang Qingluan rose to her feet.\u201cReturn it to you? Sure, come and grab it yourself.\u201d Li Tianming whisked out the pendant and slotted it into the inner pocket of his pants.\u201cGRRR!\u201d Jiang Qingluan almost felt like crying. It was her precious pendant that he put there\u2026\u201cI will strangle you!\u201d And so the chaos continued in the Qingluan Residence.......They continued to fool around for a while, until Jiang Qingluan had had enough of the man. Not that there were any hard feelings.\u201cI want to bring Ling\u2019er with me to cultivate at Flameyellow Pagoda,\u201d said Li Tianming.\u201cFine. Just get out of my sight already.\u201d Jiang Qingluan whimpered. Just being in the same room as Li Tianming was like torture to her.\u201cDon\u2019t be angry, Qing\u2019er, I will bring you back some delicious snacks when I get back.\u201d Jiang Feiling winked at her.\u201cI don\u2019t want it, I\u2019m on a diet!\u201dLi Tianming appraised her from head to toe. \u201cYou do need one indeed.\u201d\u201cGET OUT!\u201dAnd so, Li Tianming was kicked out of the doors together with Jiang Feiling. But then, this had all worked according to Li Tianming\u2019s plans. How else could he have taken Jiang Feiling away from Princess Qing?\u201cBig brother, Qing\u2019er is actually a really kind girl. She\u2019s really sympathetic about your encounters too,\u201d Jiang Feiling said.\u201cOf course I know that, which is why I dare to joke around with her. If not, with her identity as a princess, I\u2019d have died a thousand times already.\u201d Li Tianming smiled.While he and Jiang Qingluan differed greatly in terms of personality, he had always treated her as a kind person, and a good friend. While there wasn\u2019t much he could do for her now, Li Tianming would be there for her if she ever needed him one day,They left the Nebulous Pavilion to face an exquisite garden. It was a delightful day, but it wasn\u2019t even close to the beauty of the girl\u2019s smile. That being said, Li Tianming\u2019s looks weren\u2019t any worse, and they did look like a really fitting couple.\u201cLing\u2019er, I have a feeling that you can help me with my cultivation, especially when you are attached to me,\u201d Li Tianming explained.\u201cThat\u2019s possible,\u201d Jiang Feiling replied.\u201cHow did you know?\u201d\u201cMy instincts. Perhaps it\u2019s a bonus effect of complete Spiritual Attachment \u201d\u201cCan you do that with Princess Qing?\u201dJiang Feiling shook her head.Li Tianming lowered his head to look at her. He had no idea why he had this sense of familiarity every time he looked at her face, as if she was tugging on some innermost feeling in the depths of his heart. They stood side by side, so naturally to the point that it seemed that they had kept each other company for countless years.Was this destined by fate? But no one would ever favor Li Tianming. Princess Ling was a princess, while he, Li Tianming, was a notorious joke. A genius wasn\u2019t needed to know that there could be no future between them.But Li Tianming couldn\u2019t care about what others thought. He just wanted to know more about her, to understand her. For a start, he wanted to find out today how much would complete Spiritual Attachment affect his cultivation. The last time they did that, both of them had the gut-feeling that it would aid Li Tianming.\u201cLet\u2019s try the Celestial Wings once more.\u201d\u201cSure.\u201dIt was Jiang Feiling\u2019s third ability. Li Tianming watched as she turned into light particles that slowly morphed into wings on his back.Li Tianming flapped the light wings and took to the air. The wings were strong, sending Li Tianming flying forward at an incredible speed each time it flailed up and down. Li Tianming felt like he was a bird, and even the little chick would not be able to catch them if it were flying alongside them.\u201cBig brother, I can hear your heartbeat again.\u201d He could hear her voice ringing in his head.\u201cI can hear yours too.\u201dAt that moment, their hearts were in harmony.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 83": "Chapter 83 - Exceptional Mediocrity!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLi Tianming finally experienced what it meant to be one.While Jiang Feiling was a pure-hearted person, flawless and perfect, Li Tianming was the opposite. His heart was like a black rock, filled with injuries and scars that belied his age.Only with her nearby could Li Tianming feel peace, a peace he'd been denied for a long time.\u2018Big brother, what am I feeling now?\u201d\u201cEvil thoughts towards me.\u201d\u201cBig brother, you are aware that if I dispel the Celestial Wings, you\u2019ll fall, right?\u201d Jiang Feiling was definitely blushing, even if it wasn\u2019t visible.\u201cShould I do a mid-air triple axel before pulling off a perfect landing?\u201dShe giggled. \u201cYou\u2019re more likely to turn into a pancake.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t know Ling\u2019er was so cruel.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be fooled by my harmless appearance! I have many cruel methods.\u201d\u201cI'll stop, I'll stop! After all, it\u2019ll be bad if you kill your husband.\u201d\u201c...\u201dThe next moment, Li Tianming\u2019s wings vanished and he tumbled from the sky, crashing into the plaza below. Of course, Jiang Feiling wouldn\u2019t actually let him get hurt. When she deactivated the wings, he was already quite close to the ground.Li Tianming crawled to his feet and saw the girl by his side rejoicing in his misfortune. Her eyes were daring Li Tianming to tease her again.\u201cSo, still dare to talk nonsense?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t dare anymore. Please have mercy, my queen.\u201dIt seemed Ling\u2019er wasn\u2019t some gentle flower that he could easily pick up anytime. However, it was undeniable that Li Tianming liked her a lot. He was even sure his feelings would grow as they interacted more.Her presence also made him realise how base Mu Qingqing, who he once wanted to protect for life, was.However, there were going to be many obstacles in his way if he wanted to get together with her. This world wasn\u2019t one where mutual love was all that mattered.For example, now. He had fallen from the sky and landed in the most bustling place in Heaven\u2019s Sanctum, therefore drawing many a gaze. Among these gazes, many naturally believed Li Tianming didn\u2019t have the qualifications to accompany Jiang Feiling.While Jiang Feiling lacked a lifebound beast, her unique abilities gave her a reputation in Ignispolis. Many young geniuses were interested in making acquaintances with her, and most of these geniuses were concentrated in Heaven\u2019s Sanctum!The place Li Tianming was currently standing at, incidentally, was the most famous place in Heaven\u2019s Sanctum: the Flameyellow Pagoda!It stood before him, giving off the impression of a tall mountain. Its floors alternated between golden and black, continuing on and on until it extended to the clouds.Even when he was in Flameyellow Scions Institute, Li Tianming could see this famous pagoda. Rumour had it that only the most heaven-defying of geniuses could cultivate inside.And today, he was at its feet.There was an ancient saying, \u2018Conquer the Flameyellow Pagoda, conquer the world\u2019, an indication of the pagoda\u2019s status in Vermilion Bird. The pagoda held the best cultivation manuals of Flameyellow Scions Institute, the the holy land of cultivation here.\u201cIs this big brother\u2019s first time here?\u201d Jiang Feiling stood by his side.\u201cYes. In the future, can Ling\u2019er accompany me here often?\u201d Li Tianming asked.\u201cOf course. However, Qing\u2019er will get jealous. I\u2019ll have to placate her afterwards.\u201d\u201cJealous? Just like that and she likes me already? That was fast.\u201d\u201cHmph, she\u2019s jealous of you, okay?\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201d Li Tianming looked at her and shook his head.\u201cWhat are you thinking? Qing\u2019er and I don\u2019t have that kind of relationship. We\u2019re just close sisters.\u201d\u201cHmmmmmmmm.\u201d The little chick chuckled, its grin turning wretched as well.\u201cI\u2019ll throttle you to death!\u201d Jiang Feiling hadn\u2019t expected she would become another Princess Qing around Li Tianming.\u201cWait, men and women shouldn\u2019t casually touch each other!\u201dAs they messed around outside the pagoda, they began to look like a couple engaging in public displays of affection. Many disciples from Heaven\u2019s Sanctum had ugly expressions when they saw that.\u201cWho is that guy beside Princess Ling?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t recognise him.\u201d\u201cAnyone recognise him?\u201d\u201cI do. He\u2019s Li Tianming. Haven\u2019t you heard?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s that prime disciple? The unique talent that all the supernal mentors rejected?\u201d\u201cYes. The one who attempted to drug Lin Xiaoting\u2019s girlfriend.\u201d\u201cI did hear that some big clown joined the Sanctum these two days. So, it turned out to be him. He looks talented, but on the inside\u2026\u201dThe Heaven\u2019s Sanctum disciples all gathered and jeered at Li Tianming, their arms crossed. However, as Li Tianming and Jiang Feiling\u2019s \u2018intimate\u2019 horsing around continued, their frowns deepened.\u201cWhy is Princess Ling with him? Is she unaware of his infamy?\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s so pure, she must have been tricked by him!\u201d\u201cIt seems Li Tianming still hasn\u2019t learnt his lesson. Who wants to teach him again?\u201d\u201cTeaching him a lesson is one thing. The most important thing is to save Princess Ling from his evil clutches.\u201d\u201cI heard he\u2019s already twenty, but he's still around third level Spiritsource. Anyone here can teach him a lesson!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s best not to use barbaric methods when it comes to beautiful women. Use logic! We should let Princess Ling know how nasty he is.\u201d\u201cWho\u2019s going up? If no one else is, I\u2019ll do it.\u201dHonestly speaking, many people wanted to seize the chance to get nearer to Princess Ling. Everyone here was a future pillar of Vermilion Bird, all heroes of their age. They already possessed resounding reputations before joining Heaven\u2019s Sanctum.\u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d A young man walked out, silencing everyone immediately. That was because he was from the Wei Manor and the eldest of Hall of Phoenix Hall Overseer Wei Zikun, Wei Qingyi.More importantly, beside him was the beloved youngest daughter of the Flameyellow Scions Institute Chancellor, Wei Lingxuan.The two had been cultivating in the Flameyellow Pagoda and had just left. Wei Qingyi was unhappy when he came out to see Li Tianming and Jiang Feiling laughing together.Wei Lingxuan frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why grandfather let him out to embarrass us. Even if you prohibited him from revealing his identity, he might just reveal it to show off and embarrass us all.\u201d\u201cHis mother\u2019s matter, even more so.\u201d\u201cWhy is he with Princess Ling?\u201d Wei Lingxuan asked.\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear? He must have tricked her. Princess Ling is so pure; naturally, she can\u2019t see past the mask of nefarious scum like him.\u201d Wei Qingyi burned with righteous anger.\u201cDespicable. Just thinking of how he has our Wei clan\u2019s blood flowing through him makes me want to hurl.\u201d\u201cSis Xuan, give me a moment. I\u2019ll go over now. Hmph, we\u2019ll see if Li Tianming dares strut around in broad daylight after this.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll go with you. Princess Ling is the sister of my sixth apprentice-sister. I\u2019m more familiar with her, so she should listen to me,\u201d Wei Lingxuan said.\u201cRight, if I help Princess Ling, do you think Princess Qing will give me a chance?\u201d Wei Qingyi asked.\u201cMaybe. Still, I think it\u2019s more practical to go for Princess Ling. She\u2019s not an actual princess, and she\u2019s very pretty. Although she has no lifebound beast, she can still help you. Why aim for my lofty sixth apprentice-sister?\u201d Wei Lingxuan reminded him.\u201cYou\u2019re right. Princess Ling is pretty. If I can give her a good impression this time, there may be a chance. Our Wei Manor isn\u2019t any inferior to the Vermilion Bird royal clan after all\u2026\u201dThe longer Wei Qingyi looked at Princess Ling, the more chaotic his mind was. She was simply too breathtaking.Even Wei Lingxuan admitted it. For her, that was the only person she would admit defeat to. She refused to acknowledge others, like Princess Qing and Mu Qingqing.\u201cSis Xuan, I\u2019ll change my targets. Come with me. Princess Ling will trust you more.\u201d\u201cAlright. If this succeeds, don\u2019t forget to thank me.\u201d\u201cDefinitely.\u201d\u201cThe supposed number one beauty of Vermilion Bird, what good fortune for you.\u201dAfter chuckling, Wei Qingyi cleared his throat, before striding towards Li Tianming and Jiang Feiling, the bearings of a gentleman infused with every step he took.Li Tianming had been ignoring all the chatter around him, what with his mind all on cultivating and Jiang Feiling. However, he couldn\u2019t ignore it when two people appeared to block his way just as he was pulling Jiang Feiling into the Flameyellow Pagoda. Moments later, he realised that the pair was Wei Lingxuan and Wei Qingyi. In terms of blood ties, they were very close \u2014 they were cousins, second only to siblings.Li Tianming had thought it was only happenstance that they were blocking him, so he stepped to the side.Wei Qingyi mirrored his action, blocking him.\u201cIs there something you need?\u201d Li Tianming asked, confused.\u201cYes. I\u2019m here to tear off that fake mask of yours and show Princess Ling how filthy you are inside,\u201d Wei Qingyi said righteously.Li Tianming blinked. \u201cAre you\u2026 a nincompoop?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 84": "Chapter 84 - Excuse Me!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWei Qingyi had never imagined Li Tianming would use a ridiculing gaze to look at him, and then even insult him. His face began to burn. Being insulted in front of Princess Ling, especially by Li Tianming, didn\u2019t go well with him. At all.\u201cLi Tianming, you really do have guts. Today, I\u2019ll\u2026\u201d Wei Qingyi couldn\u2019t control his temper, but Wei Lingxuan cut him off before he could finish.\u201cDon\u2019t say anything,\u201d Wei Lingxuan ordered Wei Qingyi, before turning to Jiang Feiling. \u201cPrincess Ling, I don\u2019t know how you met this Li Tianming. However, you definitely don\u2019t know his real self. Don\u2019t be tricked by his honeyed tongue.\u201d\u201cThis person is actually a shameless scumbag. Just ask anyone, they\u2019ll tell you what he\u2019s done,\u201d Wei Lingxuan continued on, her face seemingly full of concern for Jiang Feiling.\u201cFurthermore, he entered the Sanctum as a prime disciple a few days ago and caused another round of laughter, \u201d Wei Qingyi added.\u201cHow exactly did I embarrass myself?\u201d Li Tianming asked. He had known this pair of cousins were arrogant and bored, but he hadn\u2019t expected them to be this bored. Was there no entertainment in Heaven\u2019s Sanctum?\u201cYou actually want to bring it up? Three years ago you tried to drug someone and got your lifebound beast executed. Haven\u2019t you had enough yet? If I were you, I would have killed myself in embarrassment long ago. I wouldn\u2019t be here trying to trick the pure and simple Princess Ling.\u201d Wei Qingyi got more and more agitated as he spoke, puffing himself up with righteous indignation.\u201cWell said!\u201d\u201cPrincess Ling, don\u2019t listen to his sweet talk!\u201dMany Heaven\u2019s Sanctum disciples, none of them any lesser in status than Wei Qingyi, all chimed in with their words.\u201cLi Tianming, get lost! If you get near Princess Ling again, none of us Heaven\u2019s Sanctum disciples will let you off.\u201d Wei Lingxuan raised her head high, speaking arrogantly. Her words sparked much agreement from her fellow disciples.Jiang Feiling also seemed to get slightly angry after hearing all this. However, her only response was to hug Li Tianming\u2019s arm and gently lean onto his shoulder, before saying, \u201cI don\u2019t need you all to tell me anything. I can judge myself who\u2019s a good person and who\u2019s a bad person. Please don\u2019t block our way.\u201dWei Lingxuan and the rest hadn\u2019t expected Jiang Feiling to be so dead-set on sticking with Li Tianming, and so close at that.\u201cPrincess Ling, aren\u2019t you aware of his ugly side?\u201d Wei Qingyi said anxiously.\u201cBig brother isn\u2019t the least bit ugly. The ugly ones are you all, who insist on mocking, insulting and making things difficult for others,\u201d Jiang Feiling said resolutely.\u201c...\u201d Her words stunned everyone, as no one had predicted this result. Wei Qingyi in particular felt like he had been struck by lightning!\u201cNo matter how you all smear me, Ling\u2019er will still stand on my side. What, not happy? I may not have morals or talent, but Ling\u2019er will still like me. Can\u2019t deal with it? Bite me,\u201d Li Tianming replied, a small smile tugging at the corner of his mouth.\u201cLing\u2019er, let\u2019s stay away from such gossip mongers. I\u2019m so pure-hearted, yet they keep slandering me! How vile!\u201d Li Tianming smiled, patting Jiang Feiling on the shoulder, before attempting to pass Wei Qingyi and enter the Flameyellow Pagoda.Many dark expressions littered the area. They had thought Jiang Feiling would ditch Li Tianming after they exposed him, turning him into an even bigger laughingstock.They could only watch on as they experienced what the expression \u2018a flower stuck in a pile of cow dung\u2019 felt like. And it was nothing short of infuriating.Li Tianming must have used some underhanded means to make Princess Ling ignore her reputation for him. Wei Qingyi, however, didn\u2019t blame Jiang Feiling. His heart dripped with blood at the sight of the pure and lovable princess gradually falling into that man's demonic clutches.\u201cExcuse me, coming through!\u201d Holding hands, Li Tianming and Jiang Feiling passed through them,\u201cStop!\u201d Wei Qingyi completely fell for Li Tianming\u2019s taunting gaze. As he snapped, he abruptly struck out with his fist. \u201cPrincess Ling, today, I\u2019ll show you exactly how despicable this fellow is!\u201dLi Tianming was on Wei Qingyi\u2019s right. The moment he attacked, Li Tianming\u2019s left arm came up to block. While Wei Qingyi\u2019s attack was backed by fifth level Spiritsource beast ki, Li Tianming\u2019s left arm was both sturdy and he had his violent Aeternal Infernal Beast Ki. There was no problem blocking this blow.However, the sole imperfection was that the enormous force still sent him flying towards Jiang Feiling. But before Li Tianming could crash into her, he twisted masterfully in mid-air, grabbing her waist. The two spun through the air before landing neatly on the ground.The scene seemed greatly reminiscent of a pair of immortal lovebirds...Especially striking was the glimpse of Jiang Feiling\u2019s snow-white legs under her blue skirt when she spun in the air.For Li Tianming, he was lost the moment their eyes met. Nothing else seemed to exist in that moment in time except for the faintly blushing young lady in his arm. She was so breathtaking that Li Tianming could fully understand why people were jealous. After bashfully looking at him, she buried her head in his chest.If not for his one-year relationship with Mu Qingqing, what Li Tianming was experiencing now would be his first love. However, it was much better than what he had shared with Mu Qingqing.\u201cTake your filthy hands off her!\u201d Unfortunately, the picturesque scene was ruined by Wei Qingyi.His fury stoked by his failure to defeat Li Tianming in one punch, he charged in again. \u201cI challenge you, Li Tianming! Fight me one on one if you\u2019re a man. If you\u2019re a coward, get lost and don\u2019t try to trick Princess Ling anymore!\u201dWei Qingyi\u2019s assault had garnered much support, all the onlookers eager to see Li Tianming make a fool of himself.\u201cWei Qingyi is fifth level Spiritsource, more than enough to crush Li Tianming under his heel.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s already twenty. It\u2019s just sheer luck he could become the prime disciple by defeating a fifteen year old!\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s probably still feeling good about himself. However, he doesn\u2019t know he\u2019s the bottom of the barrel in Heaven\u2019s Sanctum.\u201d\u201cJunior apprentice-brother Wei, I recommend you cripple him and end his line as well. Let\u2019s see if he still dares do this in the future.\u201dNow that someone had stepped out, they all threw their support behind him.Li Tianming had no choice but to put Jiang Feiling down unwillingly.\u201cBig brother, I dislike him. He\u2019s so arrogant and keeps claiming he\u2019s doing this for justice, when it\u2019s really just his selfish desires.\u201d Jiang Feiling frowned.\u201cThen what should I do?\u201d Li Tianming said.\u201cBeat him!\u201d She tugged on Li Tianming\u2019s sleeve, throwing an adorable tantrum.Li Tianming immediately felt his blood boil. Even if he had to face an army alone, nothing would stop him!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 85": "Chapter 85 - Thirty-Six Heavenly Spirits StrikesPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayDifferences in level or talent meant nothing to Li Tianming when compared to Ling\u2019er\u2019s request. Li Tianming burned with a fighting spirit as his eyes instantly locked onto Wei Qingyi. \u201cI accept your challenge, so you better get ready for a bad time.\u201dOf course, that only elicited more jeers from the crowd.\u201cBig brother, I\u2019ll help you.\u201d Jiang Feiling stood firmly beside Li Tianming, and she too, was looking fiercely at Wei Qingyi.With Jiang Feiling helping, Li Tianming was confident about winning. That being said, he too wanted to see what they could pull off when they fought as one. Jiang Feiling had ten different abilities sealed in her ten fingernails, and Spiritual Attachment was just one of them.\u201cBold, aren't you?\u201d Wei Qingyi had expected Li Tianming to run in shame, and if he did, he would have been unable to show off in front of Princess Ling. But since Li Tianming had accepted his challenge... he could barely hide his laughter. With that, their fight was now a legal duel and he wouldn\u2019t have to be responsible for whatever happened next.\u201cYour chance's here. I'll help you deal with Princess Ling, she\u2019s just fooled by that hooligan. You just make sure you make that guy beg for mercy at your feet.\u201d\u201cSis Xuan, just watch. I'll defeat him in three moves!\u201d Wei Qingyi declared, raising cheers and applause from the crowd.Without another word, Wei Qingyi jumped off the stairs and dashed towards Li Tianming. He was holding his grade four beastial weapon, a golden spear. The spear wasn\u2019t straight like most spears, twisting and curving like a wyvern instead. That didn\u2019t undermine the weapon\u2019s power at all, however \u2014 it was still one of the best grade four weapons available.Its name was the Golden Wyvern Spear!Given Wei Qingyi\u2019s family background, he could probably get hold of a grade five weapon. But beastial weapons required mastery from their users, and without enough skill the weapon wouldn\u2019t perform to its fullest potential.For now, the Golden Wyvern Spear suited Wei Qingyi more than any other weapon, given that he had been using it for three years. It could even be stronger than some grade five weapons that other people held.Wei Qingyi did not plan to summon his lifebound beast. Usually, for challenges like this, the disciples would not involve their beasts. Many a time, one-on-one fights between sanctum disciples would be much more straightforward. That being said, a fight together with their lifebound beasts would be a more all-rounded display of their true potential.\u201cDie!\u201d Sparks flew out of Wei Qingyi\u2019s eyes as he charged towards Li Tianming like a snake. The Golden Wyvern Spear was like his fang, aiming for Li Tianming\u2019s body with a golden flash.It was his signature Thirty-Six Heavenly Spirits Strikes, an intermediate source-ranked battle art. The move involved a continuous assault of jabs against opponents, suppressing them with powerful strikes that could easily poke holes in their bodies.Li Tianming drew the Blazing Dragon Chainblade from his sleeves. Against the young master of Wei Manor and the son of Wei Zikun, he would not hold back. Normally speaking, he wouldn\u2019t stand a chance against Wei Qingyi, even with a grade five weapon. But now that he had Jiang Feiling by his side, things were a lot different. He was used to battling alongside lifebound beasts, but this was the first time he fought together with Jiang Feiling. It was a very novel feeling. For example, even with Wei Qingyi charging towards them, Jiang Feiling was still relaxed. Her fingers snapped a moment later, and Li Tianming felt an indescribable storm form around them, which widened instantly to envelop both combatants.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Li Tianming didn\u2019t think it was just an illusion. Wei Qingyi\u2019s speed had fallen drastically, making each jab unnaturally slow.\u201cBig brother, this is the power of the Temporal Field,\u201d Jiang Feiling explained.After a moment, Li Tianming recalled that she had mentioned this ability to him before. This ability seemed even more incredible compared to her Spiritual Attachment and Celestial Wings. It was capable of controlling the flow of time, even though the region was quite limited and the extent of change wasn\u2019t all that much. Nonetheless, it was something that constrained only his opponents, and that tiny difference was capable of changing the flow of battle.Wei Qingyi was frowning. Li Tianming had already dodged three consecutive strikes, and it was as if the golden spear he held could not touch Li Tianming. His speed had slowed, and he couldn\u2019t understand why.He had no time to figure out the reason, because Jiang Feiling had already turned into sparkles a moment later, attaching herself onto Li Tianming. Immediately, a crystalline glow had enveloped Li Tianming\u2019s body, as if he was a god that had just descended from the heavens!The attachment this time was even more perfect than the previous time. Strength flowed through his body, and both his physical power and his beast ki surged out endlessly. This was what having unlimited might surely felt like! It felt so good, Li Tianming involuntarily let out a soft moan as the power coursed through his body.The little chick chortled. \u201cPfffft, did you know what that sounded like? That sounded like Ling\u2019er just molested you.\u201d\u201cOh, shut up.\u201d Li Tianming flushed, annoyed that he had accidentally made such a mistake. He could even hear Jiang Feiling laughing inside his body at Ying Huo\u2019s joke.\u201cOh Ling\u2019er, you might want to check Li Tianming\u2019s body and his size. If it\u2019s not good enough, you can still ditch him.\u201dIf Li Tianming had a choice, the first thing he would do would be to slaughter that damned chicken. Because of it, both him and Ling\u2019er couldn\u2019t even focus on Wei Qingyi, what with their hearts pumping nervously and all that.Although truth be told, she too felt weird whenever she attached to Li Tianming, only to flow through every corner of his body. That was only possible with a perfect attachment, meaning that Li Tianming was the only one who had received this kind of treatment. For other people she attached to, she would only focus on areas such as their arms or legs.But this wasn\u2019t the time for the two to be embarrassed, as Wei Qingyi had charged up again, with yet another explosive set of his Thirty-Six Heavenly Spirits Strikes.Shoosh!Each jab was swift and violent, accompanied by a golden flash. The Temporal Field field only served to slow his movement speed and attack speed slightly, which meant that he wasn\u2019t any less dangerous.That said, Li Tianming had already identified Wei Qingyi as a good way to vent out his frustration and embarrassment. He was getting too conscious about the girl attached to his body, and he desperately needed a good fight to distract him from that. Without hesitation, Li Tianming flung out his Blazing Dragon Chainblade!\u201cThat\u2019s the Blazing Dragon Chainblade! Where did he get that from!\u201dMany people recognised the well-known weapon, but none of them could figure out how it landed in Li Tianming\u2019s possession.A blazing dragon soared outwards as Li Tianming whipped his chainblade at his opponent. Enveloped in Draconic Blaze, the chainblade lashed at the Golden Wyvern Spear. As the chainblade and the spear clashed with each other, Li Tianming unleashed the full power of his Nine Flying Bolts, and it was also the best that he had pulled off so far. The sharp screeching sounds of metal clashing made many viewers frown. They realised that this was not the one-sided bullying they had expected to see, and Li Tianming being crushed by Wei Qingyi was not necessarily the result they would be seeing!Through this battle, Li Tianming had a better idea on the effects that the Temporal Field might cause. Wei Qingyi was forced to fight at a pace he was unfamiliar with, resulting in flaws in his movements. While these loopholes might not be an issue if he had as much an advantage over Li Tianming as he had thought, they would decide the course of battle if they were at the same level.Metallic shrieks rang in rapid succession as they continued to strike at each other.\u201cTry running from this!\u201d The Blazing Dragon Chainblade tangled itself onto the Golden Wyvern Spear, obstructing its movements. Under Li Tianming's manipulations, the Blazing Dragon Fang slid towards Wei Qingyi\u2019s throat!The Blazing Dragon Fang was mounted at the tip of the chainblade, making it impossible to dodge at such close proximity. Faced with incoming danger, Wei Qingyi released his spear to save his life. Since the battle had begun, Wei Qingyi\u2019s mind had been hazy when he realised that Li Tianming\u2019s strength was on par with his. It was an embarrassment to let go of his weapon in the middle of a battle, but he had no time to be ashamed by that. His mind was already a mess; letting go of his spear was just a natural instinct for him to stay alive.But how would he expect that with a swing, Li Tianming had flung his Golden Wyvern Spear into the air!\u201cWei Qingyi, where are you looking?\u201d The next moment, Li Tianming\u2019s black arm slammed loudly into Wei Qingyi\u2019s belly!\u201cAHHH!\u201d Wei Qingyi screamed as he flew backwards, smashing into Wei Lingxuan, who was right behind him. The two landed onto the ground a moment later in a messy pile.With a deafening shriek, the Golden Wyvern Spear landed from the sky and planted itself into the ground between Wei Qingyi\u2019s legs, just a centimetre away from his crotch!\u201cFUCK!\u201d Wei Qingyi couldn\u2019t hold himself back, and a dark stain appeared in the crotch area of his clothes.Silence fell as the audience witnessed this amazing, stunning spectacle.On the other side, Li Tianming had kept his weapon, and the fairy-like girl reappeared beside him. Her face was slightly red as she stood beside Li Tianming. Her head lowered, she played with the corner of her skirt. Li Tianming looked at her and grinned. That was honestly the best feeling he could ever imagine, and he loved the way their hearts beat together. With her attached to him, they had no secrets between them, and everything felt wonderful and pure.\u201cDamn, you wet yourself?\u201d Li Tianming broke into chuckles when he glanced at Wei Qingyi. As for the little chick, it was already rolling on the floor, laughing madly. Their laughter was piercing to the ears.Even Jiang Feiling let slip a brief giggle. She did eventually stifle her laughter, feigning a set of coughs to suppress her urge to laugh.Other than the three of them, no one else was laughing. They were all supporting Wei Qingyi, and now that he had been defeated and even wet his own pants, they had no idea how to react. Wei Lingxuan was the first to climb up. She probably did not realise that her dress was soaked in a certain liquid.\u201cLI TIANMING!!\u201d She was fuming with rage. Unlike Wei Qingyi, she was from the direct line of descent in the Wei family tree, the little princess of the entire clan. She was no different from a princess from the royal family, with the only difference being that the royal family had multiple princesses while the Wei family only had one.Her reddened eyes were locked onto Li Tianming, who was still laughing. Noticing that, Li Tianming stopped his laughter and glared back at her with equal intensity.\u201cTell me, Wei Lingxuan. Are you stunned now?\u201d Li Tianming curved his lips.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 86": "Chapter 86 - Flameyellow RockPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayA few days back, Wei Lingxuan had already given Li Tianming a preview of her \u2018stunned\u2019 face together with her siblings. But the annoyed look on her face right now was far more spectacular.Li Tianming smirked. \u201cJust look at that stupid look of yours. Compared to your acting back then, this is what being stunned truly looks like.\u201dWei Lingxuan was speechless with anger. To make things worse, there was a weird smell lingering around her, and the source seemed to be the wet part of her dress.\u201cLi Tianming, you are dead! Dead, you hear me?!\u201d Wei Qingyi was even more angry. The burning pain from his abdomen and his involuntary incontinence were all reminders of his defeat. The shame that this battle had brought him would last for years to come; killing him would be a mercy now. To add fuel to the fire, it was precisely that Li Tianming whom he so despised that had caused him all this shame.\u201cThere is no way he could have beaten me even with the help of Princess Ling. This cannot be real! I have yet to send out my lifebound beast, I have not lost yet!\u201d Wei Qingyi couldn\u2019t imagine what would happen if the news of his defeat spread in the sanctum, and could only try his best to comfort himself.Cursing in his mind, Wei Qingyi summoned his lifebound beast from his lifebound space. A huge golden bird took to the air, its body covered in glittering gold feathers. Its feathers were like brilliant daggers, but that wasn\u2019t as surprising as the six wings it had \u2014 each of them was like a golden broadsword glistering under the sun.\u201cThat\u2019s the high-tier six-star lifebound beast, the Six-Winged Goldroc, a flying metal-type beast.\u201dLi Tianming stared at the Goldroc, shocked momentarily. How could he not? It was just too similar to his brother, Midas. Midas was also a Goldroc, but it had only four wings, making it a five-star beast compared to the six-star one that Wei Qingyi had. Li Tianming would never forget about the brother that had accompanied him for sixteen years of his life.\u201cBut this is Wei Qingyi\u2019s lifebound beast. It\u2019s not Midas.\u201d Li Tianming knew better than anyone that Midas would not return.\u201cLi Tianming, you brought this upon yourself. One of us will not be walking out of here alive today!\u201d While Li Tianming was still stunned, the enraged Wei Qingyi had already closed in onto Li Tianming together with his Six-Winged Goldroc. The beast of course wouldn\u2019t care about who Li Tianming was, its intention to kill Li Tianming painfully obvious.\u201cWei Qingyi, who exactly isn't walking out alive?\u201d Just as Wei Qingyi was about to strike, an icy cold voice called beside him. That was the voice belonging to a master cultivator, and it made Wei Qingyi shudder instantly, forcing him to stop his moves.Li Tianming had seen the woman walking out of the Flameyellow Pagoda before Wei Qingyi even summoned his Goldroc. She had short hair and was dressed in a neat workout suit that portrayed her figure well. Aside from her handsome features, she also looked like an experienced, respectable senior.Li Tianming knew her. She was Princess Qing and Wei Lingxuan\u2019s supernal mentor, Qin Shi.\u201cI, I, I\u2026 I was joking, mentor. Just a joke.\u201d Wei Qingyi hurriedly halted his assault. No matter how much anger he was, there were rules he had to follow within the sanctum, rules that couldn't be disobeyed even if he was Wei Zikun\u2019s son. And one of them was: Do not disobey the supernal mentors.Wei Qingyi could feel his face twitch. He had to hide all his frustration in front of Qin Shi, and anyone unaware who saw him right now would think he had constipation.\u201cIf your mentor sees you yelling and screaming in the sanctum like this, you\u2019d be in for some punishment.\u201d Qin Shi stared at him. She was always known to be one of the stricter supernal mentors.\u201cYes, mentor.\u201dEven the rest of the chattering disciples were all silenced by QIn Shi\u2019s appearance.\u201cGet back to cultivating, all of you.\u201d With a single sentence, Qin Shi sent all the bystanders scurrying away, with most of them returning to the Flameyellow Pagoda to cultivate.That was one of Li Tianming\u2019s favorite things about the sanctum. The rules here were strictly followed, and all disciples were treated indifferently. Even a little princess like Wei Lingxuan was just another regular disciple in front of the mentors.Well, at least that\u2019s how it was in public.\u201cLingxuan.\u201d Once the crowd dispersed, Qin Shi turned her attention to Wei Lingxuan. Her gaze was like a mountain, crushing her.\u201cYes, mentor.\u201d Wei Lingxuan hid her resentment and forced out a smile.\u201cI have high hopes of you. Place your focus on making it to seventh level Spiritsource and stop wasting your time on unimportant matters,\u201d Qin Shi instructed.\u201cYes, mentor.\u201d Wei Lingxuan nodded.Out of all the disciples in the sanctum, Wei Lingxuan was sixth level Spiritsource at the age of eighteen, marking her talent as above average. But if she managed to breakthrough to the seventh level, then she would become one of the better ones.\u201cAs a member of the Wei Manor, you should know what is expected of you,\u201d Qin shi added.\u201cOh.\u201d Wei Lingxuan pouted.\u201cThen stop wasting time here.\u201d\u201cYes, mentor!\u201dWords couldn't describe how satisfied Li Tianming felt as the two Weis were lectured by Qin Shi. Wei Qingyi had no choice but to return the Six-Winged Goldroc back to his lifebound space and follow Wei Lingxuan back into the Flameyellow Pagoda.The only disciple still left outside was Li Tianming, who was accompanied by Jiang Feiling.\u201cLing\u2019er, you can achieve complete Spiritual Attachment with him?\u201d Qin Shi turned to ask Jiang Feiling, her face visibly confused.\u201cYes, mentor,\u201d Jiang Feiling answered.\u201cAnd Qingluan agreed for you to hang out with him?\u201d Qin Shi asked.\u201cShe does. The three of us are good friends.\u201d\u201cGood friends? The three of you?\u201d Qin Shi was puzzled, given that she was aware of Li Tianming\u2019s history.On top of that, his position in Heaven\u2019s Sanctum was just temporary, and it was likely that he wouldn\u2019t be able to stay here for long. No matter how she looked at it, Li Tianming was on the verge of being expelled, and was in no position to be \u2018good friends\u2019 with the two princesses. She could hardly be impressed by a disciple who got into the sanctum using age advantage and a stroke of luck.\u201cAnything wrong, mentor?\u201d Jiang Feiling questioned gently.\u201cNothing. Since you are his friends, then remind him to abide by the sanctum's rules and stay out of trouble.\u201d With that said, Qin Shi turned around and left.As for Li Tianming, he still had plans to enter the Pagoda. That be said, Wei Lingxuan, Wei Qingyi, and all the spectators were still waiting for him inside there.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, big brother, fighting is prohibited in the pagoda. If anything happens, I can protect you.\u201d Jiang Feiling raised her fist up playfully, her brilliant smile shining under the sunlight.\u201cLing\u2019er, don\u2019t bother about him, he wouldn\u2019t be dying anytime soon. I\u2019m the one who deserves your protection.\u201d The little chick on Li Tianming\u2019s shoulders interrupted bashfully, like the shameless thing it was.As for the Flameyellow Pagoda, what was there to stop him from entering? Not only did he walk in, he did it with Ling\u2019er\u2019s arm in his, and in full view of all the spectators.\u201cLi Tianming is here.\u201d\u201cA piece of filth like him appearing in front of the \u2018Flameyellow Rock\u2019, it\u2019s an insult!\u201dAll kinds of whispers filled the pagoda, most of them derogatory. As for the topic of people\u2019s discussion, Li Tianming himself was fascinated by the Flameyellow Rock they were talking about.The first level of the Flameyellow Pagoda was quite spacious, and just the height of this floor was more than thirty meters. The reason for that was because up to a third of the space here was occupied by a massive, irregularly shaped rock.The moment he entered, Li Tianming could feel the wave of spiritual energy buffeting him. He wasn\u2019t even close to the rock, but he could already feel the impact of the treasure. The rock itself looked ancient, its surface covered in red and yellow stripes. The stripes were complicated, changing with each passing second, and spoke of myriad mysteries that Li Tianming could not understand.It wasn\u2019t an exaggeration to say that everyone in Vermilion Bird knew of the legends surrounding the Flameyellow Rock. Li Tianming too had dreamed that one day, he would achieve the opportunity to cultivate in front of the stone. Today, he finally found out for himself why many would give anything just for an opportunity to cultivate here. Be it the visual impact or the waves of spiritual energy that he felt, he could barely imagine just how much benefit this rock had for cultivators.\u201cBig brother, are you familiar with the Flameyellow Rock?\u201d Jiang Feiling asked.\u201cDo you want to introduce it to me?\u201d Li Tianming smiled.\u201cSure.\u201d Jiang Feiling continued, \u201cThe Flameyellow Rock was said to be placed here by our ancestors on the day the Institute was first established. It was told that the rock is a spirit ore with black heavenly patterns, and it is also the largest, finest one that the nation had ever seen.\u201d\u201cThe Flameyellow Rock took in an endless amount of the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, and it was said that it had even developed its own consciousness throughout the course of history. It was as if the Flameyellow Rock was a living creature, capable of absorbing and guiding the flow of spiritual energy.\u201d\u201cOne of the most incredible things about the rock was that it could pick out cultivators whom it appreciates, and chase away those that it disliked. Every disciple of the sanctum has a unique synchronization level with the rock, where a higher level would mean more effective cultivation. Black heavenly patterns are the second best patterns, right after white ones. That means ores with black patterns are only inferior to those with white patterns. Big brother, can you see the black magical formation there? Those are the black heavenly patterns.\u201dLi Tianming looked up, and sure enough, there was a black magical formation that encompassed the entire rock. The formation was in fact a web made up of innumerable black veins, all part of the rock\u2019s heavenly patterns.Patterns of higher level were capable of forming magic formations, and it was precisely these formations that stored the power of heavenly will, which gave the Flameyellow Rock its unique qualities. Red, orange or yellow patterns were nothing compared to those magic formations in the stone.It went without saying that the Flameyellow Rock was the crown jewel of Heaven's Sanctum, and countless generations had cultivated here before making a name for themselves in this nation.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Based on the distance, the sanctum has divided everyone here into five different synchronization levels. Those at level one are the furthest away from the rock, and will therefore receive the least benefits from the rock.\u201d\u201cAs for those at level five, which is the highest possible synchronization level, they are said to have perfect synchronization with the rock, meaning that they can cultivate right beside the rock. It is a sign of the highest possible talent in the sanctum, and whoever can achieve that would be a legend in the institute.\u201d Jiang Feiling finished her explanation with a hint of admiration.\u201cPerfect synchronization? How many people in the sanctum now has perfect synchronization with the Flameyellow Rock?\u201d Li Tianming asked.Jiang Feiling clicked her tongue.\u201cBig brother, you must be joking?\u201d\u201cVery few?\u201d Li Tianming asked.\u201cYou bet. In fact, perfect synchronization has always been a myth in the institute, and even throughout the sanctum\u2019s history, very few could achieve that.\u201d\u201cFor real?\u201d Li Tianming was shocked to hear how difficult it was to cultivate beside the rock.\u201cOf course. Even the best disciples in the sanctum right now could only only reach level four synchronization with the rock. That\u2019s only about seven people, one of them being Qing\u2019er,\u201d Jiang Feiling explained.\u201cAnd who is the one that can get closest to the rock?\u201d Li Tianming asked\u201cBig brother won\u2019t want to hear that name,\u201d she replied.Li Tianming got the hint immediately. It must be that number one genius of Lightning Manor, Lin Xiaoting. But even he was only at level four. Perfect synchronization hadn\u2019t appeared in the institute for hundreds of years already.Li Tianming had learned enough about the Flameyellow Rock. He was aware that the moment he tried to walk into the proximity of the Flameyellow Rock, a spiritual energy storm would appear and surround him. The gust of spiritual energy was highly repulsive, making it difficult to even stand stably within it.Any disciple who wanted to cultivate here would run the risk of being consumed by the spiritual energy storm, especially when they tried to surpass the limits set by their synchronization level. Most people would figure out what their own synchronization level was the first time they approached the rock. Should a disciple at level one try to cultivate at the location meant for those at level three, not only would it not be beneficial for cultivation, the disciple might even lose his life to the spiritual energy storm.A disciple's synchronization level was decided by fate, and nothing would change that.From what Li Tianming saw, the area near the rock was divided into five rings, and both the innermost and the second closest ring were unoccupied. Only in the third ring did he see a dozen people cultivating.Third ring. That corresponded to a level three synchronization level.With that said, most of the disciples spectating the fight outside just now hadn\u2019t started cultivating. None of them expected Li Tianming to come into the pagoda, especially since he offended Wei Lingxuan and Wei Qingyi. If Wei Qingyi had the chance, he would definitely try to kill Li Tianming.Just as Li Tianming was about to have his synchronization level tested, he felt an icy chill from his back. Turning around, he saw Wei Lingxuan and her cousin Wei Qingyi staring coldly at him.There was no doubt that the two of them were stronger than Li Tianming, especially when he didn\u2019t have Jiang Feiling attached to him. The difference between Wei Lingxuan, who was sixth level Spiritsource, and Li Tianming, who was at the first level, was not negligible.Jiang Feiling frowned. \u201cFighting is prohibited in the Flameyellow Pagoda, so you better stay out of trouble.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you worry, Princess Ling, we have plenty of opportunities to have him grovel at our feet.\u201d Even Wei Lingxuan\u2019s tone towards her wasn\u2019t as cautious as it used to be. After all, Wei Lingxuan herself was not far off from being a real princess.\u201cIf Princess Ling is going to stubbornly ignore our advice and continue to stay with this degenerate, then don\u2019t blame us for not warning you when anything happens in the future,\u201d Wei Qingyi mocked, having given up his chances of creating a good impression in front of Princess Ling. After the shame he had gone through just now, he was in no mood for skirt chasing.\u201cI don\u2019t need your advice to tell me who I should be with. And how convincing is that when it comes from someone who accuses others of being degenerates?\u201d Jiang Feiling argued back.It was rare for the crowd to see the usually cute, easy-going Princess Ling to have such a tough side to her. They could only envy Li Tianming for being the only one to receive this kind of treatment.Wei Qingyi was already frustrated enough, and to make matters worse, he had no idea how to refute the princess\u2019s statement.\u201cForget it Qingyi, birds of a feather flock together. Why stop them if the losers want to keep each other company?\u201d Wei Lingxuan stepped in.\u201cYes, sis Xuan.\u201d Wei Qingyi gritted his teeth in anger.Wei Lingxuan knitted her eyebrows. She wasn\u2019t willing to let Li Tianming off today after all that he had done. But the pagoda was not a place where she could act, so she could only lower her voice and hiss at Li Tianming with a voice that only the few of them could hear.\u201cDon\u2019t you think of returning to the Wei Manor to meet your mother. Or else, I\u2019d make sure you won\u2019t be walking out in one piece.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, you better not let us see your cowardly face. Hiding behind a woman\u2019s skirt, what kind of a man are you?\u201d Wei Qingyi added. The two of them threatened Li Tianming under their breath.\u201cThe kind of man that doesn't pee in public like a wild dog. Hmm, do you smell that strange smell?\u201d Li Tianming shrugged, a sunny smile on his face.Wei Qingyi\u2019s body was visibly shaking. He had already changed his pants and the smell was gone, but Li Tianming mocking him about it was enough to make him want to rip off Li Tianming\u2019s face.\u201cDon\u2019t be impulsive.\u201d Wei Lingxuan held Wei Qingyi back and turned to Li Tianming, \u201cLi Tianming, you surely are your mother\u2019s son. Back then she angered grandfather and left with that bumpkin from Flamehaven and for twenty years, she cared not for the clan. She really deserved to get Lifesbane. As for you, don\u2019t even think about seeing her before she dies and rots away in the Rainforest Pavilion. I\u2019ll make sure to break your leg if you even dare to get close to the Wei Manor.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, don\u2019t you think we will give you a chance just because we are related by blood. Both you and your mother are a disgrace to the clan!\u201d Wei Qingyi cursed.\u201cSay that once more, I dare you.\u201d No matter how good-tempered Li Tianming was, he could no longer take in any more insults. He could argue back if they had insulted him, but instead they mocked his mother, his reverse scale \u2014 something he could not tolerate.\u201cI can say anything I want and what can you do about it? Without Princess Ling, do you really think you can still match us?\u201d Wei Lingxuan glared, her expressions that of a pampered child\u2019s.\u201cOnly this level at the age of twenty? People like you don\u2019t deserve to be in the sanctum, least to say that you came back to beg for grandpa\u2019s help. You wouldn\u2019t really think that I have to respect you just because you are my cousin, right?\u201d Wei Qingyi said.Both of them were confident in their strength. Wei Lingxuan was certain that she could easily crush Li Tianming. As for Wei Qingyi, he firmly believed that without Princess Ling\u2019s interference, he would be the one that had won the previous fight.\u201cYou said that you will break my leg when I return to the manor?\u201d Li Tianming knew more than to count on these \u2018relatives\u2019 of his. Since they insisted with their stupidity, then he would not show them any face either.\u201cOf course!\u201d Wei Lingxuan scorned with her head held up.\u201cThen you better keep track of my location, and make sure that I can find you when I return,\u201d Li Tianming replied.Wei Lingxuan laughed.\u201cWhat a joke. Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll be waiting.\u201dLi Tianming knew that words alone were not enough for him to retrieve his reputation. He turned his attention to the Flameyellow Rock, his main goal of the day.\u201cBig brother, I will attach to you and then we go in. Let\u2019s see if you have level three synchronization level.\u201d Jiang Feiling suggested. She too did not want to waste her time with those kids.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Li Tianming said. The Flameyellow Rock was way more important to him than those two relatives of his.\u201cExcuse me? Level three synchronization level? Is this some kind of comedy?\u201d Wei Qingyi chuckled when he heard Li Tianming and Jiang Feiling\u2019s conversation, \u201cSis Xuan, did you hear that?\u201d\u201cIgnorant moron who only knows how to talk big.\u201dWei Lingxuan rolled her eyes.Li Tianming had intended to ignore them, but they were taunting him yet again.\u201cAnd what if I can reach level three?\u201d Li Tianming turned around with his eyebrow raised.\u201cIs this a gamble?\u201d Wei Lingxuan smirked.\u201cWhat if it is?\u201d\u201cIf you have level three synchronization level, I will lick your boots clean.\u201d Wei Lingxuan shrugged her shoulder indifferently.Her confidence was not unfounded. Even she herself barely had level three synchronization level, while Wei Qingyi was only at level two. Most of the disciples in the sanctum could at most reach level two, and those at level three were already the elites of the sanctum. Li Tianming was at the bottom of Spiritsource, and only managed to get into the sanctum by beating Lin Xiaoxiao who was five years his junior. For disciples like him, even getting to level one synchronization level would be a problem, least to say level three.There was no reason to worry at all, and in fact, she had other plans in mind too. For a disciple to be considered to have a certain synchronization level, they have to cultivate in that particular ring for an hour. That meant that Li Tianming had to spend one hour in the third ring, when his talent clearly wouldn\u2019t even qualify for the first. If he insisted on continuing in the third ring, the spiritual energy storm may backfire on him, injuring him gravely.That was exactly what she wanted. She knew that Li Tianming loathed her, so she offered a wager that Li Tianming would find hard to refuse.Sure enough, Li Tianming fell for it.\u201cWhat if I lose the bet?\u201d Li Tianming asked with his lips curved.\u201cEasy. Just bang your head at my feet and shout as loudly as you can: I, Li Tianming, am a perverted degenerate. Do you have the guts to bet with me?\u201d Wei Lingxuan taunted.\u201cGive me a second.\u201d Li Tianming suddenly ran out of the pagoda.\u201cDid he just run in fear?\u201d The pagoda was filled with laughters and jeers.But Li Tianming was back in less that a minute. The first thing that people saw was the mud and dirt all over his shoes. He must have purposely stepped in a mud puddle.How could anyone not get his hint? He had dirtied his boots on purpose just so that Wei Lingxuan could lick it after he had won. Clearly, he had accepted the gamble!Things were spicing up in the Flameyellow Pagoda.As the bystanders watched on, Li Tianming said to Wei Lingxuan with a smile, \u201cCan we start? Do note that I\u2019m quite a particular person, so I won\u2019t want any mud left on my shoes.\u201d\u201cOh and Wei Qingyi, do you mind pissing on my shoes?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 88": "Chapter 88 - Sky-Spanning Wings!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayRegardless, those who were spectating would never begrudge the matter for blowing up even more. Licking a shoe or kneeling while admitting to being a perverted degenerate were both exciting stakes. The Flameyellow Pagoda was a place of quiet cultivation, and hadn\u2019t been so lively for a very long time.\u2018Well, aren\u2019t you eager.\u201d Wei Lingxuan glanced at Li Tianming\u2019s dirty shoes. She trembled somewhat, but she was so full of confidence that she wasn\u2019t deterred.\u201cExcited to clean my shoe? Don\u2019t worry, an hour will fly by.\u201d Li Tianming smiled, approaching the Flameyellow Rock, Jiang Feiling in tow.The Heaven\u2019s Sanctum disciples cultivating by the Flameyellow Rock all halted when they heard of the bet. Stepping out of the rings, they watched Li Tianming and Wei Lingxuan with rapt attention.\u201cIs there something wrong with Li Tianming\u2019s head?\u201d\u201cThere must be. Otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t have been dumb enough to attack Mu Qingqing three years ago and ruin himself.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s a sensationalist. You actually expect him to act low-profile?\u201dAll of them shook their heads, looking at Li Tianming with pity. Their minds were already full with the amusing events to come.Wei Lingxuan\u2019s cold voice cut them off just as Li Tianming and Jiang Feiling were about to enter the rings. \u201cLi Tianming, this bet is between you and me. Jiang Feiling is not allowed to go in. Don\u2019t keep thinking of getting a girl to help you, coward.\u201d\u201cLing\u2019er.\u201d Li Tianming stopped, giving her a smile.\u201cWill you be fine?\u201d Jiang Feiling asked.\u201cJust wait and see.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m still worried big brother may lose\u2026\u201d Jiang Feiling pouted, her eyes full of worry.\u201cWhy would I be afraid of losing? You\u2019ll help me take the punishment, right?\u201d Li Tianming grinned.\u201cNo way!\u201d Jiang Feiling giggled. She stopped walking after seeing how confident Li Tianming was. She watched with concern from the side as Li Tianming, with a yellow little chick on his head, walked into the outermost ring.Everyone else could easily see the beginnings of a girl\u2019s first love.Li Tianming stood in the region for level one synchronisation. As a rule of thumb, that was where most disciples belonged to, an unspoken requirement of sorts.\u201cA spiritual energy storm?\u201d From this distance, Li Tianming could already feel the spiritual energy emanating from the Flameyellow Rock. The ancient rock in front of him, which had experienced the vicissitudes of time, seemed to have an ancient story to tell. Rather than an inanimate object, it gave him an impression of an elder.The spiritual energy storm was like a gentle breeze when it swept past him, the whistles that passed by his ear sounding like it was trying to communicate with Li Tianming. The spiritual energy wove in and out of his body a moment later, and it felt like the Flameyellow Rock was examining him was its hands.\u201cFor our Primordial Chaos Beast physiques, there\u2019s nothing we\u2019re less scared of than violent energy. We can withstand even the spiritual energy chaos eating spirit jades puts us in, so who cares about some puny rock? If there weren\u2019t so many people around, it\u2019ll be in my stomach by now,\u201d the little chick declared arrogantly, sitting in a nest made from Li Tianming\u2019s messy hair.\u201cHey, you said it! Don\u2019t screw me over, or else you\u2019re joining me when I kneel later!\u201d Li Tianming continued his approach to the rock.\u201cBro, you must be dreaming! I\u2019m not the one who made the bet,\u201d the little chick cackled madly.\u201cSo you do admit you\u2019re screwing me over?\u201d\u201cNaturally.\u201d\u201cAnd you\u2019re supposed to be my lifebound beast? What about the bonds of brotherhood?\u201d\u201cMy only dream is to see you humiliated in front of sister Ling\u2019er so that I\u2019ll look better.\u201d\u201cYou beast!\u201d\u201cWhen egg two hatches, I\u2019m abandoning you.\u201d\u201cDo you believe I\u2019ll go to the lifebound space right this moment and crack all nine runts?\u201d\u201cHow impressive of you.\u201dLi Tianming had already reached the third ring as he chatted with Ying Huo. It was also where Wei Lingxuan cultivated.Li Tianming closed his eyes to better sense the spiritual energy storm here, which was far stronger. The density of spiritual energy here was ten times as large as outside. However, standing here was like being besieged by howling wind and torrential rains. The difficulty of absorbing and converting spiritual energy into beast ki was ten times harder.A moment of carelessness might allow the spiritual energy storm to disrupt the process of cultivation. If that happened, the cultivator would lose control of their beast ki and suffer severe internal injuries.The Flameyellow Rock was an area of great fortune, but also of great danger. That was what made knowing your personal degree of synchronisation important. Overestimating yourself would only lead to ruin.Wei Lingxuan actually had sinister intentions in proposing such a bet. She didn\u2019t want Li Tianming to kneel, but to suffer severe injuries. That was the only way for her to dispel her hate. She was the pampered, spoilt princess of Wei Manor. Flameyellow Scions Institute was the manor\u2019s territory, which made it her\u2019s too. How could she allow Li Tianming to get off scot free after provoking her in her own territory?\u201cLet\u2019s get started. It\u2019s just one hour \u2014 time to see if you\u2019re a real man!\u201d The little chick was enjoying itself.\u201cWait.\u201d Li Tianming felt the spiritual energy storm.\u201cScared?\u201d\u201cHow could that be? Let me tell you something, don\u2019t look down on a youngster now just because he\u2019s weak now.\u201d After Li Tianming finished his words, he continued on, walking towards the rock.The geniuses of Heaven\u2019s Sanctum were all waiting for Li Tianming to cultivate in the third ring. When they saw him proceed inward, they all called out, \u201cLi Tianming, don\u2019t waste time!\u201dTheir natural assumption was that Li Tianming was only posturing, and would come out after walking around a bit inside.Li Tianming simply ignored them and entered the fourth region.The intensity directly doubled!The region where Lin Xiaoting and the other core Heaven\u2019s Sanctum disciples cultivated really was out of the ordinary. The storm was like the continuous attacks of a fierce beast. Anyone who could somehow cultivate here was impressive.The little chick frowned. \u201cYou want to cultivate here?\u201d\u201cWhat, I can\u2019t?\u201d His back facing everyone else, Li Tianming crossed his legs and sat down.The little chick whistled. \u201cGusty!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not like you. I\u2019m only pretending to be scared, while you\u2019re actually scared!\u201d\u201cAre you looking down on grandpappy chicken?\u201d\u201cYou said it.\u201d\u201cHmph. Come come, let\u2019s start our symbiotic cultivation, I\u2019ll show you what a real man is!\u201d the little chick said confidently.Naturally, symbiotic cultivation was even more effective than cultivating alone here. And it was especially effective when the lifebound beast was outside the lifebound space than when inside.The lifebound space was a miraculous area. Most lifebound beasts would feel very comfortable inside. Furthermore, the space was connected to the beastmaster by the beast veins, so symbiotic cultivation could proceed even if the beast was inside.The beastmasters present would generally cultivate with their beast inside the space. Of course, although most lifebound beasts preferred to stay in the space, exceptions like Ying Huo, who liked to prance around outside, existed.The man and chick disregarded the shock of everyone else as they actually sat down in the fourth region and began cultivating, with Li Tianming running his Aeternal Infernal Codex. Li Tianming and Ying Huo\u2019s beast veins connected a heartbeat later, their infernalsources linking together. Now a singular entity, Aeternal Infernal Beast Ki began to rush madly through the connections.Li Tianming had never seen any other cultivation technique\u2019s description to be as domineering as their Aeternal Infernal Codex. Combined with their Primordial Chaos Beast Bodies, they had no equal when it came to resisting such a storm.The Aeternal Infernal Codex could forcefully devour, convert and suppress spiritual energy. Eternally undying, the Aeternal Infernal Body could survive the battering of their beast ki with absurd ease.The moment they began cultivating, Li Tianming was clear today\u2019s bet was a guaranteed win.Level four synchronisation? Nothing much.The spiritual energy storm seemed to have found a storm drain, and it gushed into the symbiotic cultivation system set up by Li Tianming and Ying Huo. It raged around violently, trying to tear apart Li Tianming\u2019s body.However, the Aeternal Infernal Codex was a bottomless hole that devouring everything effortlessly. Every scrap of ordinary spiritual energy ignited, turning into the magma-like Aeternal Infernal Beast Ki that flooded towards the infernalsource to strengthen it.Like a volcano, the area around Li Tianming immediately spiked up in temperature.It was the same for the little chick. Its tender little wings began to emit blistering waves of heat. Although its wings were merely the size of a pinky, flapping them unleashed tempestuous heat waves that should have only been unleashed by a massive beast. For a moment, everyone almost mistook it for having sky-spanning wings!The two of them were beginning to bring the Heaven\u2019s Sanctum geniuses a sense of absolute suppression, as well as a hint of reverence none would ever admit to feeling.The more they saw Li Tianming\u2019s specialness, the more vehemently they would reject those feelings.After all, it was human nature to follow one\u2019s first impression. Who would ever admit that someone they once saw as a joke could instill reverence in them?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 89": "Chapter 89 - Are You Regretting It Now?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWei Lingxuan was the least willing to admit what she had seen.Calmly, she asked her cousin, \u201cWhy do you reckon he went for the fourth ring?\u201d\u201cI suppose since he knew he was bound to fail, so he might as well go for broke.\u201d Contempt surfaced on Wei Qingyi\u2019s face. \u201cThis way, when he exits, it\u2019s not as shameful because he failed in challenging level four synchronization.\u201d\u201cWhat do you guys think?\u201d Wei Lingxuan looked towards the crowd.\u201cI agree with brother Qingyi.\u201d\u201cThis guy must be a masochistic freak who enjoys being shamed by others.\u201dThe geniuses of the sanctum each had their own understanding, but at the center of it all they agreed on one thing: Li Tianming was a joke.\u201cJust look at him, withstanding the spiritual energy storm of the fourth ring. He\u2019ll be dead in minutes,\u201d Wei Lingxuan said.\u201cWho do you think will be blamed for his death?\u201d Wei Qingyi brought up a legitimate question.Wei Lingxuan rolled her eyes. \u201cWho\u2019s there to blame but himself? The sanctum has always warned disciples to strictly abide by their own synchronization level with the rock, and to not go beyond their own limits. It\u2019s his own fault for challenging the rules.\u201d\u201cI agree, it has got nothing to do with Wei Lingxuan.\u201d\u201cXuan\u2019er had been nice enough to him already, given her identity and the power of the Wei Clan in the sanctum.\u201dWei Lingxuan was pleased with all the compliments from the spectating disciples. For now she would wait, not for the one hour to pass, but for Li Tianming to collapse on the spot.She felt like it was about time. Three minutes had almost passed, and the girl even wanted to start a countdown. She had tried enduring the fourth ring before, and she knew the difficulty of the task. Back then, she had stayed there for around seven minutes, which had nearly incapacitated her. Luckily for her, her father mounted a timely rescue, and ever since then she dared not stick her foot into the fourth ring ever again.Recognising and adhering to their synchronization level was one of the basic lessons for a disciple in Heaven\u2019s Sanctum.Wei Lingxuan took a glance at the nervous-looking Jiang Feiling, and smirked.\u201cFor someone this pretty, it's a shame that she has problems here.\u201d She pointed at her head.\u201cI guess I can always try for Princess Qing, she\u2019s smart at least,\u201d Wei Qingyi said.\u201cMy sixth-apprentice sister? She\u2019s not naive, you know,\u201d Wei Lingxuan replied.\u201cJust you wait and see, Sis Xuan. You gotta believe in your younger brother\u2019s charisma,\u201d Wei Qingyi said, adjusting his hair.As they continued to talk, Wei Lingxuan noticed that quite some time had passed. Yet, what she\u2019d expected to see had yet to happen. She wasn\u2019t worried though, since there was still plenty of time and it should be happening anytime soon.An awkward silence began to well up in the Flameyellow Pagoda, as everyone had their eyes on Li Tianming. Seven minutes had passed. Wei Lingxuan curved her lips, knowing that that was how long she managed to last. And yet... why wasn\u2019t anything happening to Li Tianming?\u201cShouldn\u2019t the spiritual energy storm tear him apart by now?\u201d Wei Lingxuan was beginning to lose her calm.\u201cSis Xuan, he is still cultivating...\u201d Wei Qingyi forced out a reply.Wei Lingxuan rubbed her eyes, reconfirming the fact that Li Tianming was at least on the same level as her. That thought alone was enough to freeze her blood.\u201cWait\u2026 If he had stayed in the third ring, he probably could last the entire hour, right?\u201d Wei Lingxuan stared at her cousin.\u201cYes, Sis Xuan, you might have underestimated him.\u201d Wei Qingyi gritted his teeth. In fact, he wanted Li Tianming dead more than Wei Lingxuan did.Wei Lingxuan was puzzled. \u201cBut how could that be possible? His age and his cultivation level all pointed to the fact that he had no talent. His bloodline was tainted by that pig from Flamehaven, after all.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t think of a reason either. But luckily for us, he chose the fourth ring, and he\u2019ll pay the price for that. Sis Xuan, you really escaped by the skin of your teeth this time round,\u201d Wei Qingyi said.Wei Lingxuan agreed with that, heaving a sigh of relief.\u201cJust die already,\u201d she cursed in her mind, her eyes still glued to Li Tianming.Every moment that passed was a form of torture for Wei Lingxuan and those around her. The only exception was Jiang Feiling, and she knew better than anyone that Li Tianming hadn\u2019t just withstood the storm, but he was also getting stronger! She stood in the direction closest to Li Tianming, her heartened expression a soothing visage in the pagoda.Fifteen minutes passed.Thirty minutes had passed!As the spectators watched on in horror, forty five minutes had passed, and Li Tianming only had to spend another fifteen inside the ring! And from the looks of it, that was exactly what he would do!Everyone in the pagoda was counting down in panic. For the past thirty minutes, their expressions had changed from smirks and jeers to one of confusion and frustration. They knew that there was a gamble at stake, and once Li Tianming walked out of the ring, Wei Lingxuan would\u2026The high and mighty princess of the Wei Manor, licking Li Tianming\u2019s shoes? To call that an explosive development would be an understatement.When the one hour countdown first started, chatter and discussions had reigned, but now, silence pressed down on the eardrums of everyone present, their eyes fixated on Li Tianming. No one uttered anything, because they did not want to risk offending the two Weis.As for the two Weis, their expressions were the least sightly of all. It was a mixture of anger, frustration and all kinds of emotions. On one hand, they refused to believe that Li Tianming actually had a level four synchronization level, and on the other, they thought of the bet that they had. It was a gamble with their pride and honor as stakes!Wei Lingxuan had never expected herself to lose, but Li Tianming\u2019s performance now had made her desperate. Anyone would see that Li Tianming had not only endured the spiritual energy storm in the fourth ring, but he had even gotten stronger from the hour of cultivation!That was simply a miracle.It didn\u2019t take long before the crucial moment arrived. The clock in the pagoda had indicated that an hour had passed, and yet Li Tianming was still alive and kicking in the fourth ring. It was as if the spiritual energy storm couldn\u2019t even touch Li Tianming, even as he cultivated in front of the rock.And with that, it was over. Wei Lingxuan had lost the gamble. In abject horror, the disciples watched as Li Tianming ended his cultivation. Man and chicken stood up to face the rest, a sadistic smile on their faces as they looked towards Wei Lingxuan. Amongst the silence, the two of them stepped out of the rings and stopped before Wei Lingxuan.\u201cC\u2019mon, what are you waiting for? Can\u2019t you see everyone here is waiting? Just stick out your tongue already.\u201d Li Tianming pressured, his position as the victor undeniable.Wei Lingxuan\u2019s fist was clenched, and her face purple. The look on her face was getting increasingly more dangerous, yet her body was trembling.\u201cLi Tianming, don\u2019t you dare! Remember your identity!\u201d Wei Qingyi scolded. That said, even he could not maintain a facade of justice, since it had been a fair gamble both sides took up. Clearly, they were the ones that had lost, and there was a price to pay for that. Especially since they were from the reputed Wei Manor.\u201cJust forget it, Li Tianming, you have won today.\u201d\u201cWe admit that we have underestimated you, and we can all vouch that you can indeed reach level four synchronization level.\u201dMany of the disciples stood at Wei Lingxuan\u2019s side. Their tone and words were courteous, but the look they gave him was clearly a sign of warning.\u201cYou have achieved your aim, and we can apologise to you. No one in the sanctum will ever laugh at you for lacking talent again.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, just let Wei Lingxuan off this time. It's not nice for a man to do this to a girl.\u201dMore and more people stood around Wei Lingxuan as they all but coerced Li Tianming. They weren\u2019t just trying to convince Li Tianming through words, but instead it was the aura that the group was giving off that tried to pressure Li Tianming into letting her off.\u201cThey are right. Li Tianming, I take back my words. I\u2019ll no longer call you a disgrace of the sanctum. We can forget about everything that happened here and outside just now. Don\u2019t miss this chance!\u201d Wei Qingyi stepped in front of Li Tianming, and blocked Wei Lingxuan with his body. His intention was clear \u2014 Wei Lingxuan\u2019s wager was too much for her to carry out. In exchange, they were willing to forgive Li Tianming for the events that had transpired.\u201cAlright, alright, it\u2019s time to leave. If not, when the supernal mentors come here later, we will get scolded for not cultivating.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, we are all disciples of the sanctum, don\u2019t take things too seriously.\u201dThere were just too many people trying to protect Wei Lingxuan. They were all pressing onto Li Tianming, forcing him to drop the bet.But, would that be possible?Against the pressure radiating off the mediators, Li Tianming suddenly smirked. The disdain in his expression was obvious, instantly silencing most of the disciples.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 90": "Chapter 90 - Challenging the Peak!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAll those present were the geniuses of the nation, behind whom stood mighty factions. They were even of their clan\u2019s direct line of descent, and had great reputations.For them to step out to resolve this situation could be considered as giving Li Tianming enough face.So, what did that disdainful smile mean?Was he actually mocking them for protecting Wei Lingxuan? How could there be someone so tactless? Could he perhaps not know that Wei Lingxuan was the chancellor\u2019s daughter, as well as the identity of all those present?\u201cWhat are you laughing at?!\u201d Wei Qingyi wasn\u2019t able to control himself any longer.\u201cI\u2019m laughing, because the so-called direct line of descent of Wei Manor, the so-called Flameyellow Scions Institute Chancellor\u2019s daughter, actually just publicly broke her promise in front of so many people, only to hide behind other people afterwards! Wei Lingxuan, would you agree if I say you\u2019re not worthy of a member of Wei Manor?\u201d Li Tianming\u2019s words rang loud and clear.His burning gaze landed on Wei Lingxuan. His words, overflowing with strength and conviction, was enough to tell everyone present one thing \u2014 he wasn\u2019t scared of anyone here.\u201cLi Tianming!\u201d Wei Lingxuan gritted her teeth, her eyes reddening.\u201cWho are you trying to scare? Am I wrong to say someone cowardly like you who dares to bet but doesn\u2019t dare uphold it is unworthy of your identity? Am I?! In my opinion, you\u2019re the disgrace of Heaven\u2019s Sanctum and Wei Manor!\u201dEvery word of Li Tianming landed on Wei Lingxuan like a slap to her face.\u201cLi Tianming!\u201d Wei Lingxuan snarled. Under the pressure, she cracked and tears started to fall. She had never been humiliated like this until today, having always been treated as a princess.\u201cOh please, don\u2019t act pitiful. You definitely didn\u2019t have this expression just now when you wanted to use Flameyellow Rock to maim me. Who are you trying to elicit sympathy from? Wei Manor is always known for their strength of character, but it seems those rumours were blown out of proportion if they\u2019re filled with people like you.\u201d Li Tianming snorted dismissively, his words stabbing at her ears again.Li Tianming wasn\u2019t bullying a girl. In the battlefield, gender distinctions didn\u2019t exist.Since she had attempted to humiliate and injure him, Li Tianming would disregard any supposed cousin relationship they had.Li Tianming had believed since young that all things had their cause and effect. If you were willing to do something, you had to be prepared to pay for it.Li Tianming had swapped his target of disdain from Wei Lingxuan to Wei Manor. For her, the bloodline of Wei Manor had always been her source of pride, and now Li Tianming was trampling all over it. Her bloodshot eyes and tears were insufficient to express the depth of her current feelings.\u201cShut up, SHUT UP! Mongrels like you have no right to comment on Wei Manor! You and your mother are the true failures and disgraces of our clan!\u201d Wei Lingxuan\u2019s hysterical shrieks only sowed confusion among the spectators. What relationship did Li Tianming have with Wei Manor? However, the matter was quickly put aside as the conflict continued to escalate.\u201cFunny. Those disgraces you mention at least know how to uphold their promises. Instead, it seems to be the ones with good breeding that hide behind others after losing a bet! Since we\u2019re all trash, then don\u2019t bother playing dress up and acting all noble!\u201d\u201cSHUT UP! I\u2019m not afraid of you!\u201d Wei Lingxuan shrieked.\u201cImpressive! Then, you may start cleaning.\u201d Li Tianming extended his foot towards her and pointed. Li Tianming didn\u2019t find his actions trashy. Who cared about her dignity? She didn\u2019t care when attempting to lead him into cultivation deviation, so it was a bit too late now.\u201cI swear that I will make you pay a price for this!\u201d Wei Lingxuan pushed Wei Qingyi aside. Surrounded by baleful intent, she strode towards Li Tianming.\u201cRemember, clean it nicely and be quick about it!\u201d Li Tianming inclined his head.Honestly, if it was just a grudge, Li Tianming wouldn\u2019t care. However, if there was malice, it was a different matter. Li Tianming refused to back down, no matter how much criticism the onlookers levied on him.\u201cCome!\u201d Li Tianming stared at Wei Lingxuan.\u201cYou won\u2019t meet a good end!\u201d Wei Lingxuan clenched her teeth.\u201cStop wasting my time with your nonsense.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll see who can protect you once you leave the pagoda. Don\u2019t give me the chance!\u201d Wei Lingxuan was aware her personal strength was enough to crush Li Tianming.\u201cDidn\u2019t I say cut the nonsense!\u201d Li Tianming directly pressed down her head onto his foot. The unprepared Wei Lingxuan\u2019s slammed onto the ground as she entered a crawling position at Li Tianming\u2019s feet.Her pretty lips landed on Li Tianming\u2019s dirty shoe. However, Li Tianming didn\u2019t stop there as he brushed it across her face, smearing it with filth!His brazen actions immediately caused an uproar. Today\u2019s events would surely change Heaven's Sanctum disciples\u2019 view of Li Tianming. There was no way someone with this much guts could be a coward or joke!No one here was unaware of Wei Lingxuan\u2019s status. Even those with the strongest of backgrounds would choose to give Wei Lingxuan some face in this situation, but Li Tianming hadn\u2019t.\u201cYou\u2026 YOU!\u201d Wei Lingxuan trembled as she experienced another first in her life. For three whole breaths of time, her mind was a complete blank as Li Tianming continued to use her face to wipe her shoe.She only finally reacted when her entire face was dirty. She burst into tears and struggled away. By now, Li Tianming had already released her, watching as she went crazy.She wanted to kill someone. In the next moment, her fingernails scraped across Li Tianming\u2019s chest, drawing five bloody gashes on them.Li Tianming ducked out of the way, lest she did even more damage. Although fights were prohibited in Flameyellow Pagoda, she had obviously gone crazy and couldn\u2019t control herself.Although Li Tianming could feel stinging pain and blood was flowing, he didn\u2019t mind. It was just a flesh wound, and in the world, a loss of dignity and face was even more painful.\u201cI swear, I won\u2019t let you die with a complete corpse!\u201d Wei Lingxuan hadn\u2019t lost all her rationality yet. After all, Li Tianming hadn\u2019t gone as far as he could have, as there was still filth left on his shoes. Still, that didn\u2019t stop killing intent and rage from filling her.\u201cI recommend you spend more time reading books and cultivating your inner qualities instead,\u201d Li Tianming said placidly, wiping away the blood.\u201cDon\u2019t you dare leave Flameyellow Pagoda, let me see you, or go back to Wei Manor to visit your mother! Otherwise, that\u2019ll be the day you die!\u201d\u201cAlright, alright. Take a look in the mirror before you continue. Sheesh, the direct descendant of Wei Manor looks like some crazy shrew now.\u201d\u201cLi Tianming, don\u2019t get too pleased with yourself. You\u2019re finished. Sis Xuan, let\u2019s go.\u201d Helpless, Wei Qingyi knew they couldn\u2019t do anything but to leave now. There was no chance of retaliating in Flameyellow Pagoda, and if Wei Lingxuan did lose control, she would land in even more trouble.\u201cGet lost!\u201d Wei Lingxuan pushed him away and rose to her feet herself, leveling Li Tianming with an icy look. \u201cI\u2019ll be waiting for you at Wei Manor.\u201d\u201cSure thing, prepare some fruits for me too. I\u2019m especially fond of grapes. Oh, and they have to be seedless!\u201d Li Tianming said.\u201cSure, I\u2019ll prepare so many that your stomach goes bad!\u201d Wei Ling walked out of the pagoda, intermittently throwing Li Tianming murderous glares.The conflict was finally over.Everyone was speechless, except for Li Tianming who acted like nothing of significance had happened.Li Tianming turned back to the Flameyellow Rock. \u201cYing Huo, interested to challenge level five synchronisation?\u201dThat was the supposed peak.\u201cGame on! Don\u2019t chicken out on me!\u201d\u201cOh, bold words for a chicken!\u201d\u201cHaha, you dare to shame me? I\u2019ll make you lick clean my claws one day,\u201d the little chick roared.Li Tianming realised everyone was looking at him coldly. None believed he could last long in Heaven\u2019s Sanctum after provoking Wei Lingxuan. She was so much stronger than him, and would trample him as soon as he left the pagoda. What would she care about some punishment after what happened?However, among them remained one warm and gentle gaze that belonged to someone who had been waiting for Li Tianming to find her \u2014 Jiang Feiling.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 91": "Chapter 91 - Mystery of Flameyellow RockPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cLing\u2019er.\u201d Li Tianming approached her. \u201cI didn\u2019t scare you, did I?\u201d\u201cNope. I support big brother on this. She was the one who suggested the bet, and she bore vile intentions, so it was only natural she upheld it,\u201d Jiang Feiling said.So, it did turn out there were people who saw reason. The more Li Tianming interacted with her, the more he realised she wasn\u2019t the foolish young girl her appearance suggested her to be. She had her own principles and views.In this situation, if Li Tianming had lost, would Wei Lingxuan have looked the other way?\u201cBig brother, would you like to try if the two of us together can challenge peak synchronisation?\u201d Jiang Feiling asked.\u201cWe\u2019ll know when we give it a shot.\u201d Li Tianming looked at the Flameyellow Rock.If Li Tianming challenging level four synchronisation and making Wei Lingxuan pay the price was a sensational affair, then what was challenging the peak synchronisation no one had accomplished in over a thousand years?No one expected Li Tianming to continue walking towards the Flameyellow Rock. In the first place, they couldn\u2019t understand how his talent was sufficient to achieve level four synchronisation. Considering his age and cultivation stage, even level one would be impressive enough.Yet, he had the guts to challenge the peak that generations of Heaven\u2019s Sanctum geniuses had failed to scale. That was why when he revealed his desire to try, he only drew mockery to himself.\u201cIf it was Lin Xiaoting, it might still be reasonable. He\u2019s the closest to it after all.\u201d\u201cLin Xiaoting attempted it once after obtaining the Saintbeast War-Soul, but failed within thirty breaths of time. That just goes to shows how hard it is.\u201d\u201cLi Tianming got level four synchronisation probably by a fluke. Yet, he still wants to go further? Those who don\u2019t know how to quit when they\u2019re ahead always suffer.\u201d\u201cHonestly, with his age, he\u2019ll never catch up to the standard of Heaven\u2019s Sanctum even with level four synchronisation. It\u2019s wasted on him.\u201dEven though Wei Lingxuan had left, the Flameyellow Pagoda was still bustling with activity. They had been planning to return to their cultivation, but Li Tianming and Jiang Feiling\u2019s conversation had put an end to that.Now, many youths watched Li Tianming, mockery in their eyes, as Jiang Feiling used Spiritual Attachment on him and merged together.To be honest, many were envious of this. Who wouldn\u2019t want to be so intimate with Vermilion Bird\u2019s number one beauty?The title of \u2018number one beauty\u2019 wasn\u2019t something Jiang Feiling had conferred on herself, but rather from her many admirers who had taken her to be a celestial being. The country was vast and filled with numerous beauties, but she was the only one who seemed like a fairy from the heavens.After the Spiritual Attachment, Li Tianming underwent some fundamental changes. Without another word, the little chick and him walked back to the fourth ring.What lay beyond was the fifth ring, which was so close to the Flameyellow Rock that it could be touched. It didn\u2019t have a large area, but the spiritual energy storm there could only be described as horrifying.And Li Tianming fearlessly stepped in.\u201cHe really went in!\u201d Honestly, Li Tianming\u2019s sheer fearlessness did make them feel some grudging respect that they couldn\u2019t hide from their faces.\u201cHe really isn\u2019t afraid of dying\u2026\u201dAs soon as Li Tianming stepped in, he could feel the storm. He was only three metres from the rock now. No one had encroached here for so long that he was like fresh meat to the Flameyellow Rock. The storm, seemingly carrying apocalyptic might, crashed forward!Li Tianming felt like his body was being ripped apart.\u201cIt\u2019s a little uncomfortable, big brother.\u201d Even Jiang Feiling, who was in spirit form, could feel it.\u201cLet\u2019s endure it together.\u201d Li Tianming\u2019s tone had a reassuring quality to it.\u201cAlright.\u201d\u201cFlirting? Did you two forget I\u2019m here?\u201d the little chick snapped. Alas, he really had been forgotten. That was the cruel reality of things.Li Tianming smiled. He could still hold on. He considered for a moment, before deciding to press on. \u201cSpirit ore with ten millennia old black heavenly patterns...what mysteries could this symbol of the institute have?\u201dHe was very curious. While only three metres separated man from rock, it took an inexorably long time to cross it. Pushing and straining, an untold amount of time had passed when he finally reached it. His hand reached out, its target the rock, and the audience outside \u2014 which was on the periphery of his attention now \u2014 began to stir.However, Li Tianming didn\u2019t care. After all, it would be a waste if he didn\u2019t touch those black heavenly markings after coming all the way here. The spiritual energy storm that had battered at him the whole time was actually generated by this very rock; at his current position, his organs were already on the verge of rupturing.Fortunately, however, Jiang Feiling\u2019s Spiritual Attachment seemed to be stabilising Li Tianming\u2019s body.Li Tianming hesitated for a moment, right before he was about to touch it. After a moment of contemplation, he removed the glove from his left hand, taking care to prevent the audience from seeing the unveiled beast claw.\u201cBig brother, why is your left hand a beast claw?\u201d Jiang Feiling asked.The little chick gave a heartfelt sigh. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand. He was alone for just too long. He trained and trained his left hand, until it became what you see today.\u201d\u201cWhat does that mean? I don\u2019t understand.\u201d Jiang Feiling stumbled over her words, clearly embarrassed.The little chick sighed, as if it was bemoaning the state of mankind and the universe. \u201cI absolutely can\u2019t tell that you don\u2019t understand from your tone of voice. Ling\u2019er, I didn\u2019t think you were this sort of person. Alas, when will I ever find someone as pure as me?\u201d\u201cYing Huo, you\u2019re a meanie.\u201dWhile the two teased each other, Li Tianming focused all his attention on the rock. Then, the beast claw touched the rock, the red eye on it coming in direct contact.Li Tianming\u2019s body shuddered as what felt like an electric shock coursed through it. However, this sensation was actually the horrifying spiritual energy storm making use of his left hand to surge into his body, threatening to tear it apart!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 92": "Chapter 92 - Perfect Synchronization!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayBOOM!The Flameyellow Rock shook, and the black heavenly patterns began to wriggle, as if it was trying to form some kind of picture. The changes to the formation was immense!When the Flameyellow Rock shook earlier, the whole pagoda had shuddered along with it. Such a development would have alerted a lot of people, but Li Tianming was past caring about that now.\u201cLET GO!\u201d the little chick screamed. Li Tianming could feel the impact too. If it wasn\u2019t for the black arm enduring the shockwaves that came from simply touching the rock, the outburst of spiritual energy would have blown his entire arm off.It was too dangerous. Had he held his hand there any longer, it would have sundered his Aeternal Infernal Body, and ripped Jiang Feiling out of his body too!Thankfully, the black arm managed to absorb the hit, allowing him to break contact with the rock immediately, saving his own life. It was an encounter that left two humans and one chicken in shock and awe.\u201cI saw the patterns form some kind of a picture just now, but I wasn\u2019t able to endure the spiritual energy storm,\u201d Li Tianming said.\u201cI saw it too, and it looked quite mysterious. There must be other secrets hidden in this rock other than its spiritual energy,\u201d Jiang Feiling agreed.\u201cNo, you won\u2019t make it out alive if you touch it again,\u201d the little chick said worriedly.It was right. Li Tianming knew that at his level, he wasn\u2019t able to withstand the storm. It wasn\u2019t the right time to discover the secrets of the rock.\u201cWell, well, weren\u2019t you quite the daredevil earlier, so why are you backing down now?\u201d Li Tianming laughed.\u201cMe, scared? I was just worried that the two of you would both die here without any offspring.\u201d Ying Huo smirked.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to find yourself an excuse for being a timid chicken.\u201d\u201cHa!\u201dLi Tianming reconsidered his plan to explore the Flameyellow Rock. For now, he would focus on cultivating, and he could prove himself to have perfect synchronization if he could last an hour here. In fact, it was a lot easier with the help of Jiang Feiling. The spiritual energy gushing into his body could be guided by her. Not long later, Li Tianming and Ying Huo started their Aeternal Infernal Codex and began to refine the immense spiritual energy the stone was emanating.\u201cLing\u2019er, word has it that you aren\u2019t related by blood to the Vermilion Bird King. Do you know about your own past?\u201d Li Tianming asked randomly. While she did not have any lifebound beast with her, the powers sealed within her fingernails were simply incredible.\u201cI don\u2019t know. Father said he picked me up right after I was given birth, and even my umbilical cord was freshly cut.\u201d She sounded a little moody. That was only natural, since she didn\u2019t even know who her true parents were.\u201cWhere did he find you?\u201d\u201cIn the Abyssal Battlefield.\u201dAbyssal Battlefield again? It wasn\u2019t much of a surprise, considering that it was the most mysterious place on the Flameyellow Continent, home to some of the greatest mysteries of the age. For example, it was there where Li Tianming found his Saintbeast War-Soul.\u201cOh Ling\u2019er you poor thing. But worry not, as big brother Ying Huo will shower you with love, and be the harbour for your soul,\u201d the little chick consoled.\u201cNah, you are more like a little brother that needs taking care of.\u201d Jiang Feiling grinned.The little chick could only sigh as it turned its attention back to the spiritual energy storm, diverting its attention away from its failed attempt to charm the girl. For now, the three of them would focus on cultivation only.For Li Tianming, the so-called one hour mark didn\u2019t even bother him now. He would prove that with his perfect synchronization, the innermost ring was his and his alone, and he could stay there for as long as he wanted!A burst of flame engulfed both him and Ying Huo and formed a fiery tornado. No matter how violent the spiritual energy storm looked, it would be absorbed by the tornado the moment it got close to Li Tianming. The spiritual energy was then sent to the pair\u2019s infernalsources, which would then expand rapidly. In fact, it was even more effective than eating spirit gems!Entering the sanctum was the correct move after all! Only in this sacred place would Li Tianming find the resources that could let him maximise the potential of the Primordial Chaos Beasts, allowing him to catch up with those his age! The day when he could surpass them was drawing close.The Flameyellow Rock had brought him hope like never before, not to mention that he had perfect synchronization. Putting these thoughts at the back of his mind, Li Tianming went back to cultivating.\u2026\u2026Even Li Tianming himself had no idea how much of a commotion he had caused when the Flameyellow Rock shook. Everyone thought he was looking for his own death when he had touched the rock. That was because the sanctum had strictly forbidden any disciple from touching the rock. Historically, anyone who had tried touching the rock all left the ring as a corpse, without a single exception.The disciples hadn\u2019t even managed to react when Li Tianming touched the rock, such was their shock. But before they could yell at Li Tianming, he had already drawn back. Furthermore, Li Tianming acted as if nothing had happened, and sat down within the fifth ring to cultivate.\u201cWhy hasn\u2019t the spiritual energy storm torn him apart?\u201d\u201cNo way, when was the last time a disciple with perfect synchronization appeared?\u201d\u201cMore importantly, why can that fool do it? Is there something wrong with the rock?\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t you give it a try?\u201dMany were eager after hearing that. They refused to believe that Li Tianming was more talented than any of them there, choosing to blame it on the rock\u2019s sudden malfunctioning instead.\u201cI\u2019ll go, I\u2019ll go.\u201dSoon a handful of them entered the rings, some of them at level three synchronization level. But when they tried cultivating in the fourth ring, every single one of them ran out, beads of sweat dotting their foreheads.The conclusion was obvious. There was nothing wrong with the Flameyellow Rock.Every disciple in the sanctum had endured the spiritual energy storm before, and naturally they understood what a feat it was to cultivate in the fifth ring. And to make things worse, the one who achieved it was someone they had looked down on and despised! Those who were still jeering at Li Tianming just now could only stare at Li Tianming with dropped jaws.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?!\u201d A cold voice sounded from the stairs leading to the second floor of the pagoda, as two women dressed in long white robes walked down the stairs. The one in the lead was a middle-aged lady, her slender feature mature and charming. But the freezing aura that she released was enough to keep disciples away from her.She was none other than Supernal Mentor Liu Xueyao. Following behind her was an alluring teenage girl who gave off the impression of a white lotus, her expressions calm and unreadable. The pair walked down the stairs, their expressions puzzled from the commotion happening on level one.If Li Tianming wasn\u2019t that focused on his cultivation, he would have turned around to find Mu Qingqing and her supernal mentor, Liu Xueyao.\u201cI\u2019m asking a question, right? What\u2019s going on here?! The pagoda is not a place for disciples to fool around!\u201d Liu Xueyao gazed at the disciples crowding outside the rings, her expressions clearly annoyed.\u201cSupernal mentor, please look at that.\u201d One of the disciples pointed to Li Tianming.\u201cThat\u2019s\u2014!\u201d When Liu Xueyao\u2019s eyes landed on Li Tianming, her frosty expressions melted instantly, shock and surprise written all over her face. The fiery tornado had blocked Li Tianming\u2019s appearance, and thus she did not recognise him.\u201cWhich disciple is that to challenge perfect synchronization? Since when did we have someone like this in the sanctum?\u201d Liu Xueyao\u2019s jaws were slightly apart with a look of disbelief on her face. The same could be said for Mu Qingqing, as she frowned at the back of the teenager enveloped in fire. Why did that person look familiar?\u201cSupernal Mentor Liu must know him. He already met all the supernal mentors at the Hall of Ancestry.\u201d\u201cWei Guohao?\u201d Liu Xueyao mentioned the first name on her mind. But that shouldn\u2019t be the case, since he didn\u2019t have the talent for that.\u201cNo, it\u2019s Li Tianming,\u201d another disciple replied.\u201cLi Tianming? Who?\u201d Liu Xueyao was startled for a moment. She didn\u2019t remember any genius in the sanctum by the name of Li Tianming.But Mu Qingqing shuddered when she heard that name, her gaze falling on the boy in the fire. Her pretty face contorted at that moment, her beauty vanishing like dust in the wind.\u201cThat can\u2019t be real, you must have gotten the wrong person!\u201d she shouted, her frenzied voice trembling madly, her nails digging deeply into her own palm.For the second time in three years, she was panicking. The first time it happened, Li Tianming had just defeated Lin Xiaoxiao and was flaunting in front of her. His presence then had already made her feel threatened. How could a boy she had abandoned and long forgotten come back to haunt her again?Today was the second time. But this time, she could no longer take the boy as a mere joke! Even if she had strong willpower, she could no longer stay calm as she gawked at Li Tianming, who was right beside the Flameyellow Rock.\u201cThere is no mistake about that. Li Tianming has been there for a while, and he even had a bit of conflict with Wei Lingxuan and the Wei Manor just now.\u201d\u201cWhat conflict?\u201dLiu Xueyao finally recalled who Li Tianming was. It was that fool of a prime disciple who was unwanted by all of the supernal mentors, and without Vice-Potentate Mu Yang he wouldn\u2019t even be in the sanctum by now.It was only a few days, and that jester had overtaken Lin Xiaoting to become the new top genius of the sanctum?!Liu Xueyao\u2019s eyebrows knitted together as she thought of what she said about Li Tianming back at the Hall of Ancestry. For some reason, her face felt rather sore.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 93": "Chapter 93 - Heaven\u2019s ElysiumPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaySeveral of the disciples narrated the details of the conflict to Liu Xueyao.\u201cHow presumptuous! Isn\u2019t he fearful of Wei Lingxuan killing him?\u201d Liu Xueyao narrowed her eyes. Did he think of his challenge of peak synchronisation as a springboard to success?\u201cHe lasted two minutes in there, even longer than Xiaoting. Qingqing, your thoughts?\u201d Liu Xueyao asked.\u201cMaster, I don\u2019t want to dredge up old matters. He\u2019s already paid the price, and I wish him nothing but luck now that he\u2019s back cultivating. We were friends once upon a time after all.\u201d Mu Qingqing lowered her head. This was the only way she could allay suspicions when Li Tianming left Flameyellow Scions Institute, only to meet an assassination attempt by Bloodflower Chamber.\u201cI\u2019m just afraid he\u2019ll let hatred cloud his judgement. He may now believe he has some chance of revenge. Be careful,\u201d Liu Xueyao said.\u201cYes, supernal mentor.\u201d\u201cStill, no need to worry too much. Firstly, he hasn\u2019t lasted one hour, so he may not actually have peak synchronisation. That\u2019ll be too incredible. Secondly, his starting point is too far behind. His cultivation stage now is weak, so even having peak synchronisation won\u2019t let him catch up.\u201d Liu Xueyao was feeling shocked. Just like everyone else, she couldn\u2019t understand how this was possible.Mu Qingqing relaxed somewhat after hearing that. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I believe Li Tianming has seen the errors of his ways and will cherish his second chance.\u201dYet, she couldn't stop herself from continuously casting glances at a certain youth. As time passed, the possibility of Li Tianming having peak synchronisation grew, as well as the torment in her heart. She was well aware of the terrifying talent peak synchronisation represented, but she continued to maintain a placid expression.\u201cXiaoting is currently in seclusion in this very Flameyellow Pagoda. I wonder how he\u2019ll feel if he knew Li Tianming, who he once crippled, is challenging peak synchronisation right now,\u201d Liu Xueyao said ruefully.\u201cBig brother Ting is a good person. I think he won\u2019t do anything since he\u2019s already levied a punishment on Li Tianming,\u201d Mu Qingqing said.\u201cFortunately, the ones he\u2019d offended were the two of you. If it had been anyone else, his corpse would have rotted away in the three years since then,\u201d Liu Xueyao said.\u201cYes.\u201d Mu Qingqing didn\u2019t deny this part.\u201cXiaoting does treat you well. Your talent wasn\u2019t considered high before you joined Heaven\u2019s Sanctum, and your lifebound beast was only five-star. For your sake, he took out the royal manna, Aquatic Dracosoul, from Lightning Manor. That thing is as valuable as a city! It elevated your lifebound beast to become seven-star, a royal beast. That\u2019s how you achieved meteoric improvements in the past three years, reaching eighth level Spiritsource and creating an unbridgeable gulf with Li Tianming, who used to be on your level.\u201dLiu Xueyao looked at Li Tianming with distaste. \u201cHonestly, you two belong to different worlds now. Don\u2019t keep targeting him, lest you feed the rumour mill.\u201d\u201cSupernal mentor, all of Lightning Manor has treated me well, and I\u2019m deeply grateful for it. Actually, the Aquatic Dracosoul just happened to be a good fit for me, and there weren\u2019t any good candidates among Lightning Manor\u2019s direct line of descent. I was just lucky,\u201d Mu Qingqing spoke happily, a hint of pride in her words.\u201cLuck is part of your abilities,\u201d Liu Xueyao said.While she tended to be frosty to others, she treated her own disciples well. Furthermore, Mu Qingqing\u2019s link to Lin Xiaoting would help keep her seat as a supernal mentor secure.Although they were talking, they kept their attention on Li Tianming. As time passed, their mood worsened.\u201cSupernal mentor, if he really does have perfect synchronisation, will his future cultivation be very fast?\u201d Mu Qingqing couldn\u2019t resist asking anymore.\u201cHe will be fast, but without background or resources, it will never be fast enough to catch up to you two. You may also get more fortuitous encounters in the upcoming Abyssal Trials as well. Focus on it instead; it wasn\u2019t easy getting your slot,\u201d Liu Xueyao said solemnly to Mu Qingqing.\u201cI have to thank you for that.\u201d Mu Qingqing said.\u201cI didn\u2019t do much. The credit goes to Lin Xiaoting and the Tempest Marshal. That family is full of good men. You haven\u2019t married him and aren\u2019t considered a true part of Lightning Manor. Yet, you can join others like Wei Guohao, Princess Qing, Mo Lin, Chen Hao, Xing Que, all direct descendants of powerful clans, in the Abyssal Trials. You can fight for the chance to join Heaven\u2019s Elysium.\u201dLiu Xueyao stroked Mu Qingqing\u2019s head, her eyes full of hope.\u201cBig brother Ting really hopes I can join Heaven\u2019s Elysium together with him. I\u2019ll definitely try my best in the Abyssal Trials.\u201d Mu Qingqing\u2019s expression was serious. As someone who craved advancement, she possessed a fighting spirit that actually wouldn\u2019t lose to anyone.\u201cIn this final stretch, I\u2019ll try to help you grasp more trump cards. After all, the Abyssal Trials won't just have competitors from our Heaven\u2019s Sanctum, but also premier geniuses from other countries. Add on the multitude of fierce wildbeasts, and the death toll will be high.\u201d Liu Xueyao became worried when she mentioned this.She knew that in the Abyssal Battlefield, even the most heaven-defying of geniuses could get killed in a moment of carelessness.\u201cI\u2019m willing to take the risk, all for the chance of joining Heaven\u2019s Elysium.\u201d Mu Qingqing bit her red lips.\u201cNot bad. That\u2019s what I like about you. Although you look soft on the outside, you\u2019re tougher and more hardworking than anyone else. Your accomplishments today were a foregone conclusion. The competition will be fierce, but I believe in you.\u201d Liu Xueyao was clear why Mu Qingqing was so persistent.Heaven\u2019s Elysium was a true paradise. She herself had dreamed of going there when she was young. Only after going there would one know how vast the world truly was.It was Lin Xiaoting\u2019s destiny to go there after obtaining the Saintbeast War-Soul. His horizons would be broadened, and if he went alone, his life may not have a Mu Qingqing thereafter.So, whether Mu Qingqing followed him to that vaster world, or stayed here to wait and wait for him was all up to the Abyssal Trials.Mu Qingqing swore that no one, absolutely no one, would stop her path forward!In the grand scheme of things, Li Tianming was just an insignificant thing, unworthy of mention. He was the past, and what would determine her future was the Abyssal Battlefield.If she was still worrying about him getting perfect synchronisation, that was the real joke. Liu Xueyao was right. They no longer belonged to the same world.Hence, when Li Tianming finally lasted one hour and everyone present burst into an uproar, she was busy completing her mental preparations for what was coming. \u201cFrom now on, if a god blocks my way, I\u2019ll kill the god. If a devil blocks my way, I'll kill the devil!\u201dMu Qingqing bit her tongue, and the taste of blood immediately roused her emotions to bursting point. In that moment, the coldness in her eyes seemed to rise another level. The sanctum geniuses who were busy feeling shocked over Li Tianming now seemed rather meaningless, because Mu Qingqing knew this was not where her future lay.\u201cWhat is he doing?\u201d\u201cIt seems he made a breakthrough, right next to Flameyellow Rock!\u201cHe\u2019ll be famous if it gets out that he has perfect synchronisation. I bet the supernal mentors are all going to fight over him\u2026\u201d\u201cI heard he rejected all of the supernal mentors and wanted to be the Vice-Potentate\u2019s disciple, though\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2026 might actually be possible now.\u201dLi Tianming\u2019s performance had convinced many disciples.Li Tianming\u2019s power madly rose, as he finally entered second level Spiritsource. However, because of Spiritual Attachment and his Aeternal Infernal Beast Ki being much more majestic than others, he seemed to possess power of sixth level Spiritsource to others!It was imaginable that with his perfect synchronisation, his rate of growth would be much quicker. Surpassing most here was a very real possibility. Li Tianming was no longer considered mediocre in Heaven\u2019s Sanctum.\u201cLet\u2019s go, supernal mentor,\u201d Mu Qingqing said coldly.\u201cHe actually has perfect synchronisation. Many of the supernal mentors will be regretting it soon, I bet.\u201d Liu Xueyao couldn\u2019t help but let out a sigh of admiration, well aware of how hard perfect synchronisation was.\u201cGood for him then,\u201d Mu Qingqing said.\u201cYou don\u2019t want to see him?\u201d Liu Xueyao asked.\u201cI\u2019ve forgiven him, but he still hates me. I don\u2019t want to see him strutting around in front of me after he accomplished a bit. Besides, I need to go prepare for the Abyssal Trials.\u201d Mu Qingqing said.\u201cAlright. From my point of view, it's disgraceful when a despicable person has good talent.\u201d Liu Xueyao didn\u2019t say anything more. As the commotion continued, she and Mu Qingqing headed for the Flameyellow Pagoda\u2019s second floor.None of the Heaven\u2019s Sanctum disciples noticed, but when they vanished into the upper floor, Li Tianming threw that direction a glance.\u201cBig brother, why aren\u2019t you happy even though you made a breakthrough?\u201d Jiang Feiling asked.\u201cI think I saw someone detestable.\u201d Li Tianming frankly. It was only a glimpse of a skirt he caught, but that snow-white clothing was what she liked the most.\u201cMu Qingqing?\u201d Jiang Feiling asked.\u201cYes.\u201d From the commotion, it seemed many people had come.Li Tianming wanted to go out for a break. He had just reached second level Spiritsource, so he needed to rest and consolidate his gains. That definitely wasn\u2019t possible next to the rock.After he came out, Jiang Feiling also undid her Spiritual Attachment, flitting out of him like a small bird. It had been like a date, and the two were exceptionally happy. When Li Tianming thought of how he could use this as a reason to bring her out more often in the future, a warm, fuzzy feeling flooded his heart.\u201cHah! With perfect synchronisation as an excuse, we\u2019ll see how Jiang Qingluan stops me from bringing out Ling\u2019er everyday!\u201d Just thinking of Jiang Qingluan\u2019s stunned expression was enough to make Li Tianming chuckle. He left the cultivation region a little while later, hand in hand with Jiang Feiling like a couple getting married. The first person Li Tianming saw was Vice-Potentate Mu Yang, whose eyes were burning with passion. He wasn't alone for long; soon a dozen odd supernal mentors appeared by his side.There were as many supernal mentors now as there were on that day in the Hall of Ancestry. The only one missing was Liu Xueyao, who had already left with complex feelings.As Mu Qingqing\u2019s supernal mentor, there was no way she wanted to personally witness how popular Li Tianming was.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 94": "Chapter 94 - Too Lewd For A Chicken?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLi Tianming didn\u2019t expect such a big hoo-ha because of his perfect synchronization. But now, almost every supernal mentor had shown up, and even the Vice-Potentate had appeared.Back at the Hall of Ancestry, all the supernal mentors were indifferent to his plight, and some of them had even mocked him outright. But now, after walking out of the innermost ring unscathed, all Li Tianming could see was them gawking in disbelief.\u201cPerfect synchronization\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWhen was the last time we had such a genius?\u201d\u201cBut why is it him? I\u2019d rather believe that Lin Xiaoting had it.\u201d\u201cIs the rock malfunctioning?\u201d\u201cIf he had cultivated beside the Flameyellow Rock since young, he would have been stronger than Lin Xiaoting by now!\u201dAs the supernal mentors of the sanctum, they knew the Flameyellow Rock better than anyone else, the true importance and meaning of Li Tianming\u2019s feat.On their side, a lot was going on in their mind, considering that their attitude had changed from one of disdain to envy. Quite a few of them had even jeered at him when he first appeared in front of them as the prime disciple. But now that he had redeemed himself with his perfect synchronization, how were they supposed to react now?Who would still think of him as the joker from three years ago? Who would still consider him to be an unqualified prime disciple?\u201cHow did you even do that?\u201d Mu Yang was standing at the front of the crowd, and even he could only shake his head in shock.Li Tianming shrugged.\u201cOf course I did it with my talent that the supernal mentors were not interested in.\u201dHe savoured the supernal mentors\u2019 expressions. Li Tianming never intended to keep a low-profile, and he never could, considering the power of his Primordial Chaos Beasts. Now that the opportunity presented itself, he wouldn\u2019t hesitate to stomp on their faces.\u201cHaving perfect synchronization is enough to mark you down as one of the legends of the Flameyellow Scions Institute. Not bad, not bad at all.\u201d Mu Yang wasn\u2019t going to hold back his compliments. Given Mu Yang\u2019s authority in the sanctum, his words signified that Li Tianming\u2019s situation had changed completely.Supernal Mentor Feng Wuguang sighed.\u201cIt\u2019s been years since someone with perfect synchronization appeared. We did make a wrong judgement that day.\u201d\u201cToo bad Li Tianming was born in the countryside, and we only found out about his talent for cultivating now. If he had been born in a reputable clan in Ignispolis, he would be so much more.\u201d Another of the supernal mentors, Gao Yuanding, set aside his opinions and praised Li Tianming.Mu Yang\u2019s lips curved when he heard that. He knew that Li Tianming was in fact born to one of the most powerful clans in the nation. Unfortunately, he didn\u2019t grow up there.\u201cWith the Flameyellow Rock\u2019s recognition, his cultivation will rise at an unimaginable pace. It shouldn\u2019t take long for him to make up for all those lost time and catch up with those of his age,\u201d Supernal Mentor Qin Shi added, having felt that Li Tianming and Jiang Feiling being together wasn\u2019t all that bad now.Hearing the compliments from the supernal mentors, the rest of the disciples who were still there knew that the tide had changed for Li Tianming.\u201cDon\u2019t be too happy about this. With your current level, you will be needing a long time to match those of your age even with your perfect synchronization. On top of that, your lifebound beast is only six-star, and with its poor bloodline you shouldn\u2019t be considering yourself the top of the sanctum.\u201d However, a different opinion came from Supernal Mentor Zhao Tianchen.\u201cWHAT? Whose bloodline are you calling poor? Your bloodline is the trash one!\u201d the little chick snapped back, clearly enraged by the insult.Most beasts could only telepathically communicate with their own masters, and this was probably the first time Zhao Tianchen got scolded by a lifebound beast.\u201cSupernal Mentor Zhao, my beast is still young, and I apologise if it offended you. But I will remember what you have said, and one day I will make sure you take back those words.\u201d Li Tianming smiled at Zhao Tianchen. He was obviously not suppressed by that rude mentor.\u201cTake back my words? Keep dreaming.\u201d Zhao Tianchen sneered, and said nothing else. After all, Mu Yang was still here, and he shouldn\u2019t be talking too much.\u201cVice-Potentate, Li Tianming once mentioned that he wanted to be your disciple. Are you in the mood to mentor anyone today?\u201d Qin Shi asked, her opinions of Li Tianming changed after seeing his perfect synchronization.As she spoke, Li Tianming saw Jiang Qingluan standing beside her, winking in his direction. Despite her shocked face, he could tell that she was genuinely happy for him.Well, it would have been better if she hadn\u2019t followed that up with a fearsome stare, clearly a sign warning him to stay away from Jiang Feiling.That being said, Jiang Qingluan was probably the one that prompted Qin Shi to say that. Clearly, she was helping him.Thoughtful, really.\u201cI did make a promise to him. The day he defeats Wei Guohao in a fight would be the day I accept him as my disciple. It\u2019s fair since they are about the same age,\u201d Mu Yang announced, in an inexplicably good mood.Wooo!That sparked another round of gasps from the crowd. That rumour about how Li Tianming could be the Vice-Potentate\u2019s disciple had been proven true after all! Everyone knew how difficult it was, considering that the previous disciple he accepted was that monstrous Lin Xiaoting. Furthermore, Mu Yang would be taking over as the new Potentate soon, meaning that his disciple would stand a chance of being the next Potentate afterwards!If Li Tianming really managed to become Mu Yang\u2019s disciple, he would literally reach the peak a disciple could possibly achieve in the sanctum!\u201cWell, even with his perfect synchronization, he\u2019s still three levels lower than Wei Guohao.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, breaking through the later levels of Spiritsource is the true wall here.\u201d\u201cMore importantly, Wei Guohao is still going to cultivate, and as someone with level four synchronization level, their difference in talent is not that obvious.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a formidable task to catch up with all that lost time.\u201d\u201cWhich is why I\u2019m saying, this challenge Vice-Potentate has for him is practically impossible.\u201d\u201cSounds about right. Furthermore, it\u2019s hard to imagine Lin Xiaoting accepting Li Tianming as his apprentice brother, given the bad blood between them.\u201d\u201cLi Tianming should just make use of this opportunity to settle on a supernal mentor who is willing to guide him.\u201d\u201cIf he missed this opportunity, he would only be wasting his perfect synchronization.\u201d\u201cBut look at him, clearly he won\u2019t go for anyone other than the Vice-Potentate himself.\u201d\u201cThen too bad for him, because he'll soon find out talent is useless without proper guidance.\u201dThe Flameyellow Pagoda was spacious and enclosed, meaning that many of the discussions and murmurs amongst the disciples had travelled to Li Tianming\u2019s ears too. There were a whole bunch of them there, some impressed while others jealous. And Li Tianming would prove them all wrong!Still, without a mentor, Li Tianming would not be a proper member of the sanctum, and this would cause him to lose out on some opportunities.\u201cIf there\u2019s nothing else, you all are dismissed. Li Tianming, follow me,\u201d said Mu Yang, while the crowd continued to chatter within themselves.\u201cYes, Vice-Potentate \u201dThe supernal mentors have seen Li Tianming\u2019s synchronization level with the rock and had nothing else to do there. But what they did realise was that Mu Yang seemed to pay quite a lot more attention to Li Tianming. This puzzled them. How would Lin Xiaoting, who was in seclusion on top of the Flameyellow Pagoda, think?The crowd gradually dispersed. Mu Yang would bring Li Tianming with him, and Jiang Feiling needed to return too.\u201cVice-Potentate, let me send off Princess Ling first,\u201d said Li Tianming.\u201cGo ahead.\u201dLi Tianming brought her to Jiang Qingluan. Although this was their first \u2018date\u2019, it was a pity that he wouldn\u2019t be able to send her back home, and could only leave her with Jiang Qingluan.\u201cGreetings, Supernal Mentor Qin.\u201d Li Tianming was polite.\u201cJust do your best.\u201d Qin Shi dropped this and left the pagoda as well, leaving Li Tianming with the two princesses.\u201cLook at you, Li Tianming. Are you here to show off your perfect synchronization?\u201d Jiang Qingluan asked.\"Naturally. Are you still going to ask me to go back to farming?\u201d\u201cWho told you someone with perfect synchronization can\u2019t be a farmer? Don\u2019t think you can do whatever you want just because of that, our Ling\u2019er isn\u2019t that easy to score points with,\u201d Jiang Qingluan warned him.\u201cYeah, your difficulty level looks lower.\u201d Li Tianming grinned.\u201cYou! Grrr, jokes aside, your perfect synchronization is pretty impressive. I will put it out here, if none of the supernal mentors are willing to accept you, you can choose to serve the Vermilion Bird clan. I promise we will treat you well,\u201d Jiang Qingluan said.Li Tianming nodded. \u201cI don\u2019t mind.\u201d\u201cThat straightforward?\u201d Jiang Qingluan didn\u2019t expect to earn her clan a genius this easily.\u201cObviously. He wants to be the king\u2019s son-in-law after all.\u201d The little chick chipped in.\u201cKeep dreaming.\u201d\u201cWhy are you so nervous? It\u2019s not like he wanted to marry you,\u201d the little chick asked.\u201c...\u201d Jiang Qingluan was lost for words.\u201cThen I will make my stand clear too. The two of you are the only friends I have in the sanctum and no matter what happens, I\u2019m willing to take a blade for the two of you,\u201d Li Tianming replied. No matter how much he joked with Jiang Qingluan, he had always treated her as a genuine friend of his. As for Jiang Feiling\u2026 hmmm. If only he could add another word in front of \u2018friend\u2019.\u201cPretty sure there's something else you wanna take, isn\u2019t there?\u201d The little chick suddenly chuckled.What else could I take from these two girls?\u201cKHHHH!\u201dLi Tianming was done. How could that damned chicken make such an honorable promise sound so obscene? That had to be a talent, no?Luckily, the two girls hadn\u2019t figured out what Ying Huo meant, or they might have just strangled the chicken on the spot.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Li Tianming, I have one more thing for you.\u201d Jiang Qingluan stared at him.\u201cGo on.\u201d\u201cIn a few days\u2019 time, I will have to leave the institute for a period of time. You better protect Ling\u2019er properly, but don\u2019t you dare bully her. If I return and find out that you\u2019ve done bad things to her, you\u2019ll become eunuch Li.\u201d Jiang Qingluan was fiercer than ever.\u201cYou\u2019re leaving?\u201d Li Tianming\u2019s eyes lit up. Does that mean\u2026 unlimited dating with no one to interrupt the two of us?\u201cThis is a stern warning. Do you understand, eunuch Li?\u201d\u201cAye aye, don\u2019t you worry. I\u2019m the most pure and innocent person I myself have ever known.\u201d Li Tianming grinned, and Jiang Feiling, who was watching them talk, giggled.\u201cQing\u2019er, let\u2019s go, the Vice-Potentate is still waiting for him,\u201d said Jiang Feiling.\u201cFor the sake of your lower half, you better watch out!\u201d Jiang Qingluan left with one last warning. It was only after the two vanished did Li Tianming belatedly realise that he hadn\u2019t questioned her about why she was leaving and where she was going to. Oops.\u2026\u2026Once they were gone, Li Tianming hurried back to Mu Yang\u2019s side.\u201cYou had a bit of a conflict with Lingxuan?\u201d Mu Yang asked.\u201cJust some small issues,\u201d Li Tianming replied.\u201cAlright. Just do what you deem fit,\u201d Mu Yang replied.Li Tianming had half-expected Mu Yang to tell him off for getting into trouble, but to implicitly encourage it? Now that was another story. \u201cVice-Potentate, what do you mean?\u201d\u201cSimple, really. If you want to earn a place in Wei Manor for you and your mother, you have to earn it through your own performance. If you manage to leave the Wei Manor disciples in the dust, I\u2019ll be able to talk more about you in front of my master,\u201d Mu Yang explained.\u201cWhat\u2019s there to talk about with my pathetic level?\u201d Li Tianming rolled his eyes; those in the Wei Clan were a haughty bunch.Mu Yang smiled. \u201cLevels are nothing. Your talent \u2014 your perfect synchronization \u2014 is something I can talk to him about. I won\u2019t be asking about your mother, and instead, I'll bring up topics like your Saintbeast War-Soul and your synchronization with the Flameyellow Rock.\u201d\u201cI see. Guess it\u2019s better to have something to talk about. If I, who was born and raised outside, can exceed the descendants that he raised himself, surely that would make him appreciate me more,\u201d Li Tianming said. His strength would show just how effective Wei Jing\u2019s teachings were.\u201cGlad you understand that. Let me explain one thing my master has always worried about.\u201d Ever since Mu Yang met Wei Jing, he had always been on their side.\u201cPlease do.\u201d\u201cWei Manor is the core of Heaven\u2019s Sanctum, and for countless generations, most Potentates were members of the Wei Clan. For my generation, I managed to surpass Wei Tianxiong, allowing me to become the new Potentate. Normally speaking, I would focus on nurturing my master\u2019s grandkids, so that the Wei Manor would regain control of the sanctum. This is my way of showing my gratitude to my master. The sanctum had been running this way since its very beginning, which is also why the Wei Clan had always been in control of the sanctum,\u201d Mu Yang explained, letting a sigh a moment later. \u201cHowever, I have never accepted Wei Guohao, nor any other member of the Wei Clan, as my apprentice. Though you may consider them to be the best in the sanctum, they are not good enough for me.\u201d\u201cSo is the Vice-Potentate saying that their talents are lacking?\u201d Li Tianming clicked his tongue.\u201cNot exactly lacking, but as members of the Wei Manor, they really should at least be able to put up a good fight against Lin Xiaoting. So it\u2019s not because I don\u2019t want to accept Wei Guohao, but because my master doesn\u2019t approve of him and doesn't allow me to take him in,\u201d Mu Yang said.Li Tianming got the picture now. Wei Guohao was definitely not an average disciple, but if he were to be the future Potentate candidate, he had to be the champion of the sanctum. Only then could he resume the tradition and let the Wei Manor control the sanctum once again. In other words, Wei Tiancang was unsatisfied with his grandkids.\u201cAnd this discontent he has with his grandchildren is the second sore point of his. You should very well know what the first one is.\u201d Mu Yang sighed again. He knew Wei Tiancang far too well. For a legendary figure like himself, his descendents had sure failed to live up to his expectations.\u201cI get what the Vice-Potentate means now. By encouraging me to challenge Wei Lingxuan and even Wei Guohao, you are trying to show him that he has a capable grandkid. And if I manage to be the solution to his second sore point, then chances are that he might just fix the first one himself. If he treasures his face so much, then all I have to do is make him proud of me.\u201d Li Tianming had found a hope for saving his mother, thanks to Mu Yang\u2019s advice.\u201cNot bad, if you understood my message. I figured this is the only opportunity you had after talking to my master these few days. Once rumours that you\u2019re from Wei Manor spread, and when people know that your mother is Wei Jing, would he still possibly let her die alone in the Rainforest Pavilion?\u201d Excitement crept into Mu Yang's voice; he too did not want Wei Jing to die.\u201cI understand now.\u201d Li Tianming was now clear on what he needed to do. Both his goals of taking revenge on Lin Xiaoting and saving his mother shared the same process: cultivate! Become stronger!\u201cI didn\u2019t put much hope on you to begin with, because I thought you weren\u2019t worthy. But with your synchronization level, and how you got the Saintbeast War-Soul, I\u2019m having second thoughts about this. Things might look tough for you right now, but I have faith in you,\u201d Mu Yang said, patting his back. Li Tianming never thought that he would meet a senior that trusted him so much.\u201cLi Tianming, even though I pointed out the way for you, there is one thing you need to be clear on.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m listening, Vice-Potentate. \u201d\u201cEven if my master doesn\u2019t approve of Wei Guohao\u2019s generation, it doesn\u2019t mean they are bad. For the you right now, they are impossible targets. Remember, your perfect synchronization is impressive, but their fourth level ones aren\u2019t much worse than yours. You have about a year's time to achieve that, as I can keep your mother alive for only that long. If, within this year, you cannot overcome them, then there\u2019s nothing I can do too,\u201d Mu Yang said. \u201cThe old man is more stubborn than you can possibly imagine.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201d Li Tianming couldn't wait to get started, as he finally had a specific direction to work on.\u201cOh. In the days to come, Wei Guohao would leave for the Abyssal Battlefield. You better pray that he doesn\u2019t find any fortuitous encounters there, or you\u2019ll never be able to match him again.\u201d\u201cWill Princess Qing be heading to the Abyssal Battlefield too?\u201d\u201cYeap, they are the same batch.\u201dJust as Li Tianming wanted to ask him their purpose for going to the Abyssal Battlefield, Mu Yang changed the topic. \u201cYou made a breakthrough beside the Flameyellow Rock, no? I\u2019m willing to help such talent shine with all my might. Just tell me if you need anything, be it battle arts or other resources.\u201dMu Yang also had a vested interest in keeping Wei Jing alive, which was why he wouldn\u2019t be stingy when it came to helping Li Tianming, even though he wasn\u2019t Li Tianming\u2019s mentor.\u201cIf you face any other difficulties in cultivating, feel free to find me at the Mu Manor. Your Chief Mentor Mu Wan misses you too.\u201d\u201cThank you, Vice-Potentate. In fact, I\u2019m looking for some advanced source-ranked battle arts.\u201d Li Tianming seized the opportunity when he saw it. He was rather familiar with the Nine Flying Bolts and the Skyfire Soulbinder, all intermediate source-ranked arts. But in order to face opponents like Wei Guohao and Mu Qingqing who were above eighth level Spiritsource, he needed stronger skills.\u201cVery well then, I will bring you to the Hall of Combat and you can pick for yourself.\u201dThe Hall of Combat was where the sanctum stored its battle arts. Ever since he entered the institute, Li Tianming had heard stories of how the Hall of Combat was home to some of the most unique and powerful arts of all levels.The Hall of Combat was under one of the four guardians, the Guardian of Combat, Zhao Yuanji. He was the youngest guardian, someone in the same generation as Mu Yang.The hall itself was hidden in a secluded forest down the western side of the sanctum. Generally, supernal mentors themselves would bring their disciples here to choose a battle art. This time, however, it was Mu Yang who brought Li Tianming there.A hulking middle-aged man in black robes walked out of the hall as they arrived. There was a deep scar on his face, the kind that would scare the living daylights out of any disciple who dared to lay eyes on him. This man was none other than the Guardian of Combat, Zhao Yuanji.\u201cElder apprentice-brother.\u201d He called out to Mu Yang.As it turned out, this Guardian of Combat was Wei Tiancang\u2019s disciple too.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 96": "Chapter 96 - The Mystery of the Princess\u2019s PantiesPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe four guardians had almost the same status as the chancellor. Although Zhao Yuanji was about the same age as Wei Zikun, Wei Zikun was only a mere hall overseer in the institute. Clearly, Wei Tiancang\u2019s descendants weren\u2019t faring that well.Right now, the ones in control of the sanctum were either Wei Tiancang\u2019s brothers or his disciples.\u201cApprentice-brother, he must be that Li Tianming, the one with perfect synchronization. I\u2019ve just heard the news.\u201d Zhao Yuanji looked at Li Tianming.\u201cYeap, find him three advanced source-ranked battle arts,\u201d Mu Yang requested. That was Li Tianming\u2019s own request, since three battle arts were enough for him to chew on for a while.\u201cAlright, Mo Lin, take your junior apprentice-brother with you and let him pick three arts,\u201d Zhao Yuanji instructed.A teenager walked out from the hall, his slender figure dressed in a black robe and his long hair reaching his waist. His handsome features gave him a quiet, scholarly look, his mild demeanour adding on to that impression.He first greeted Mu Yang with a bow, before gesturing towards Li Tianming. \u201cApprentice-brother Li, please, come with me.\u201dLi Tianming followed him as they passed through the various chambers in the hall. The youth guiding him must be the disciple of the Guardian of Combat, Mo Lin.\u201cI just heard that apprentice brother Li has perfect synchronization. Congratulations.\u201d Mo Lin turned and smiled at him. His movements were effused with grace, the bearings of a confident, assured teenager.\u201cThank you, elder apprentice-brother.\u201d\u201cNo worries. This is the region for the source-ranked arts, and the advanced ones are all the way inside. Feel free to help yourself, and do ask me if you have any queries.\u201d Mo Lin smiled. He was merely a guide and nothing more, treating Li Tianming like any other disciple. This was something Li Tianming didn't encounter often, considering that everyone was biased against him given his 'reputation'.After thanking him, Li Tianming entered the room. Its interior was simple, with all the battle arts stored on wooden shelves, unlike the Xing & Chen Repository. But despite the room's austere decor, any battle art here was actually worth a fortune.After going through almost all the arts in the room, Li Tianming finally found two advanced source-ranked battle arts.The first one was a movement art known as \u2018Flaming Shadow Flash\u2019. It was a more advanced version of his Confounding Mirage Walk, allowing him to retain the mirages while increasing his speed. Once mastered, he would be like a flaming shadow that could appear anywhere in the blink of an eye. A flexible move, it would definitely come in handy when dodging his opponent\u2019s attacks. Even the little chick could make good use of the Flaming Shadow Flash with its tiny figure, turning it into an even deadlier assassin.The second art Li Tianming had picked was named the \u2018Three-Spring Heavy Strikes\u2019. Unlike the Dragon-Mammoth Heavy Strike he knew, this new boxing art took inspiration from solar flares. Furthermore, it contained a fiery aspect to it that could utilize their Aeternal Infernal Beast Ki better. The destructive move not only suited Li Tianming\u2019s black arm, but its beastial art version, the Three-Spring Heavy Claws, also synergised well with Ying Huo\u2019s claws. Like its name, the art was made up of three different stances, each blow more powerful than the last one.Li Tianming also wanted to look for a whip art that he could use with his grade five weapon, the Blazing Dragon Chainblade, but he couldn\u2019t find any.\u201cElder apprentice-brother Mo Lin,\u201d Li Tianming called out.\u201cYes?\u201d Mo Lin walked into the room.Li Tianming didn\u2019t expect Mo Lin to be actually waiting outside while he was looking through the battle arts. Li Tianming treasured that respect this apprentice-brother had shown him.\u201cOut of interest, what is brother Mo\u2019s cultivation level?\u201d Li Tianming asked with a smile, realising that they should be about the same age.\u201cEighth level Spiritsource,\u201d Mo Lin replied.\u201cWhat about your synchronization level?\u201d\u201cI lose out to brother Li in terms of that, since I can only cultivate in the fourth ring.\u201d Mo Lin smiled.\u201cThe guardian must be proud to have a disciple like you.\u201d Li Tianming complimented, knowing that Mo Lin was about Wei Guohao\u2019s standard.\u201cHaha, I hope I don\u2019t bring shame to my mentor.\u201d\u201cWill you be making a trip to the Abyssal Battlefield soon?\u201d Li Tianming asked.\u201cHow do you know about that? My slot hasn\u2019t been confirmed, and I\u2019m awaiting the sanctum\u2019s final decision,\u201d Mo Lin said.\u201cWhat will you be going there for?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t tell you about that, since the sanctum has yet to announce it officially.\u201d\u201cNever mind then.\u201d Li Tianming paused for a while, before he continued, \u201cBrother Mo, I've been looking for a whip art, but I don\u2019t seem to be able to find any here.\u201d\u201cWhip art? Let me take a look.\u201dMo Lin started searching in the room. About fifteen minutes later, he returned to Li Tianming with a black-covered book, but he didn't pass it to Li Tianming.\u201cThis is the only whip art we have, but I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t pass it to you just yet,\u201d Mo Lin said.\u201cWhy so?\u201d\u201cFirstly, this is a supreme source-ranked battle art, while the Vice-Potentate told you to pick three advanced ones. Therefore, I must seek their opinion before giving this to you. Secondly, this is a vicious and cruel battle art. It's not suited for disciples since it is only intended for killing others. Finally, your level of cultivation is not enough for you to understand this art,\u201d Mo Lin explained.\u201cI see. If that\u2019s the case, can you let me take a quick scan of the book while you confirm with the Vice-Potentate? Just tell him I want this art,\u201d Li Tianming said.\u201cSure.\u201d\u201cThanks for the trouble.\u201dMo Lin handed Li Tianming the book before walking out. He was right that Mu Yang only mentioned advanced arts, and supreme arts were miles apart from advanced ones, be it in terms of its power or its rarity.This supreme source-ranked whip art was called the \u2018Soulless Seven Howls\u2019; the name alone already suggesting that this was a malevolent art. A brief glance through its content told Li Tianming that the art consisted of seven deadly stances. The most unique aspect of this art was that its user could vibrate the whip to produce a howling sound that could mentally affect the opponent.\u201cAttacking through a sound wave? I wonder how this would work when it\u2019s coupled with my Bewildering Eye?\u201d Li Tianming blinked twice, and continued to read.According to the book, every time the opponent heard a howl, an illusionary ghost would descend upon them. Over time, the victim\u2019s hallucination of being surrounded by more and more ghosts would intensify, peaking at seven such illusions. It was especially effective when used with his Blazing Dragon Chainblade, since it was easier to produce sounds with metal chains compared to regular whips. Li Tianming was already in love with this whip art before he even started on it.As he was reading, Mo Lin had returned with a smile. \u201cCongratulations, brother Li, the Vice-Potentate had agreed for you to take whatever you wished. Looks like he really trusts you.\u201d\u201cYou have my thanks, elder apprentice-brother Mo Lin.\u201d\u201cYou are welcome.\u201dLi Tianming kept the three arts and headed outside together with Mo Lin. Inside the courtyard, Mu Yang was playing chess with Zhao Yuanji, and the two disciples came out just in time to see Zhao Yuanji win the game.\u201cIt\u2019s been thirty years, yet you\u2019re still this bad.\u201d Zhao Juanji laughed.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to say that out, right? Save some face for me.\u201d Mu Yang rose to his feet and beckoned at Li Tianming. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cSee you around.\u201dThe moment the two of them left the Hall of Combat, Mu Yang turned to Li Tianming and said, \u201cI need to go too. Focus on your cultivation, and find me at the Mu Manor should you need anything.\u201dWith that, Mu Yang disappeared in a flash, before Li Tianming could question him about the Abyssal Battlefield.\u201cDarn it. Looks like I\u2019ll have to ask Jiang Qingluan instead. While I'm at it... let's go find Ling'er!\u201d He had already visited the Nebulous Pavilion once this morning, and it was already nearing night time now \u2014 Jiang Qingluan probably wasn\u2019t going to let him in at night. Therefore, Li Tianming returned to his own house to learn the new battle arts and work on his Bewildering Eye instead.\u201cIf I continue cultivating my Godsoul Canon and reach Skypolarity Eye, the Spirit Core will open the gate to the Wondersky Realm. What would that place be like?\u201d Li Tianming had always been curious about this mysterious power. As a result, he had never stopped cultivating his Bewildering Eye. Like a tireless ant, he continued to work on the spirit veins on his third eye, until the wee hours of the night.\u2026...Underneath the moonlight, Li Tianming took the second egg out of his lifebound space. Just as he placed it on the table, the egg shook violently and tilted from side to side \u2014 the creature inside was clearly having the time of its eggy life.\u201cI say, when will you come out? You\u2019ve been shaking for at least a month already.\u201d Li Tianming waited and waited, but his second beast just wouldn\u2019t leave the egg. He had a feeling that even if this little thing hatched, it would probably be a lazy bummer, completely different from the hardworking little Ying Huo.After staring at it for a while, Li Tianming kept the egg back into his lifebound space. It could take its time, since one Primordial Chaos Beast was already enough of a headache to him.Speaking of Primordial Chaos Beasts, where on earth did Ying Huo go? Was it pecking at worms somewhere?\u201cHey bro, I got some goooooood stuff for ya.\u201d Speaking of the devil, Ying Huo had sneaked back.\u201cWhat?\u201d Just as he turned around to find the chicken, a red undergarment flew right into his face.\u201cThat\u2019s Jiang Qingluan\u2019s hahaha, you will have some explaining to do tomorrow!\u201d\u201cYing Huo, you little piece of shit!\u201d Li Tianming quickly dumped it into the furnace and made sure nothing remained of it. Becoming an eunuch would be a reality if Jiang Qingluan saw that.Unfortunately, there was nothing Li Tianming could do about that damned chicken.\u2026...It was still early the next morning when Li Tianming arrived at the Nebulous Pavilion. Because of that undergarment the little chick stole last night, Li Tianming was feeling uneasy when he knocked on the door.\u201cBetter not give anything away, if not how will Ling\u2019er see me.\u201d He took a deep breath.There was some bustling going on in there, and it took awhile for Jiang Qingluan to open the door with a frown.\u201cWhere\u2019s Ling\u2019er?\u201d\u201cStill doing her makeup inside, why are you here again?\u201d Jiang Qingluan stared at him.\u201cAnd why can\u2019t I be here?\u201d Li Tianming invited himself in. There was a clear displeasure with Jiang Qingluan\u2019s vibes, and he wondered whether it had anything to do with that red undergarment.\u201cBro, remember that red cloth you were using as a handkerchief last night? Do you reckon that vermilion bird sewed on it could be Princess Qing\u2019s lifebound beast?\u201d Ying Huo suddenly interrupted him.\u201cLI! TIAN! MING!\u201d Fire spewed out of Jiang Qingluan\u2019s eyes as she stomped towards Li Tianming.\u201cJust a misunderstandi\u2014\u201d Before he could explain himself, Jiang Qingluan\u2019s hands had already found his neck\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 97": "Chapter 97 - Torch Dragon and AquamarinePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cWhat are you two doing?\u201d Jiang Feiling walked out, curious about the commotion.\u201cNothing. I just don\u2019t like his face.\u201d Jiang Qingluan gritted her teeth, but ended up letting Li Tianming go in the end, since she didn\u2019t want others to know about it.Li Tianming was thankful that he managed to get away with this.\u201cYing Huo, watch out when we get back later. I'll definitely cut your tongue off.\u201d\u201cWith just you?\u201d The little chick rolled around, laughing madly. Li Tianming could only blame his own luck for landing himself such a lifebound beast.\u201cBig brother, have a drink.\u201d\u201cThank you, Ling\u2019er, you are way more polite than a certain someone.\u201d Li Tianming sat down, Jiang Feiling at his side.\u201cHah? Don\u2019t act like you have the moral high ground.\u201d Jiang Qingluan glared at him.\u201cGirls shouldn\u2019t be so aggressive. Anyway, I came over today to ask you a question,\u201d Li Tianming replied.\u201cBefore that, I have a question for you.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cDid you steal the wrong one?\u201d Jiang Qingluan asked, the meaning behind it obvious: Were you trying to steal Jiang Feiling\u2019s?\u201cYea.\u201d Li Tianming could only acknowledge that unwillingly. Had he said no, wouldn\u2019t that imply that he was interested in her? To Li Tianming, Jiang Qingluan was more like a rival...\u201cOutrageous, I should have never let Ling\u2019er interact with you,\u201d Jiang Qingluan rebuked. Little did she know that it was all Ying Huo\u2019s prank, and the mastermind itself was still laughing its ass off on the floor.\u201cWhat are you two talking about?\u201d Jiang Feiling was the only one who had no idea what was going on.\u201cNothing much. Li Tianming, what do you want?\u201d For a princess, she sure wasn\u2019t acting like one.\u201cYou mentioned that you will be leaving for a period of time. Are you going to the Abyssal Battlefield?\u201d Li Tianming asked. He was banking on the question to disperse his awkwardness, and it didn\u2019t let him down.\u201cYeah, how did you know?\u201d Jiang Qingluan looked puzzled.\u201cI heard that Wei Guohao would be going too, when would that be?\u201d\u201cSo you really want to defeat Wei Guohao and become the Vice-Potentate\u2019s disciple? You sure know how to dream,\u201d Jiang Qingluan jeered.\u201cJust tell me when.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not confirmed, but it should be within a month or two,\u201d Jiang Qingluan replied.\u201cAnd how long would you be staying there?\u201d\u201cLess than a month.\u201dThat basically means that Wei Guohao would disappear for about a month sometime this year. It probably won\u2019t affect Li Tianming overtaking him, provided he didn\u2019t find any opportunities in the Abyssal Battlefield.\u201cWhat are you all doing there? How many people are going?\u201d Li Tianming asked.\u201cThings are not confirmed yet, and the supernal mentors forbade us from telling others.\u201d\u201cCome on, not even to a friend like me?\u201d Li Tianming asked, curious about the details.\u201cFriend?\u201d\u201cThen you should know what will happen to Ling\u2019er once you are gone.\u201d\u201cAnd you should get ready to be a eunuch.\u201dLi Tianming licked his lips. \u201cHa, Ling\u2019er\u2019s beauty is totally worth it,\u201d\u201cQing\u2019er, just tell him. You already broke the rules by telling me.\u201d Jiang Feiling chipped in.\u201cYou!\u201d Jiang Qingluan didn\u2019t get why her own sister was on Li Tianming\u2019s side.\u201cYou heard her.\u201d\u201cBasically, Heaven's Elysium has locked down Azure Domain inside the Abyssal Battlefield, placing some things there that could be either challenges or opportunities. The Heaven\u2019s Sanctum of three different nations would be sending out their younger disciples for the Abyssal Trials, and the winner will enter Heaven\u2019s Elysium,\u201d Jiang Qingluan explained.\u201cHeaven\u2019s Elysium? What\u2019s that?\u201d Li Tianming was confused.\u201cWait, you don\u2019t even know what Heaven\u2019s Elysium is?\u201d\u201cFarmer, remember?\u201d\u201cTrue.\u201d\u201cPlease enlighten me, O princess.\u201d\u201cI suppose you should at least be aware that Vermilion Bird is just one of the many nations on Flameyellow Continent, and we hardly know much about what goes on outside. But every single Flameyellow Scions Institute on the continent, as well as the Heaven\u2019s Sanctums, were built by Heaven\u2019s Elysium. Even our sanctum is just one of its many outposts.\u201d\u201cIs it very strong?\u201d\u201cObviously. Supposedly, it\u2019s a world that we can\u2019t even imagine. Based on my knowledge, there\u2019s only one person from Vermilion Bird in the past hundred years that gained the recognition of Heaven\u2019s Elysium. And that person is about to join.\u201dLi Tianming did have a bit of knowledge regarding the world outside of Vermilion Bird nation. He knew that the continent was colossal, but exactly how big it was, no one knew since few had stepped foot out of the nation before. From what he knew, other than the endless wastelands, there was a \u2018Torch Dragon\u2019 towards the northwest, as well as a \u2018Aquamarine\u2019 towards the isles in the south. The three nations all lay on a peninsula near the south-east region of the continent, and the path to the centre of the continent was blocked by endless mountains. Therefore, these three nations knew of each other\u2019s existence, but nothing of the rest of the continent.Heaven\u2019s Elysium was definitely somewhere in the continent centre. If Flameyellow Continent was indeed as huge as the rumours said, then Heaven\u2019s Elysium must be incredibly strong. After all, they could set up countless institutes in different nations and yet only accept their best disciples.\u201cWho has been selected to enter Heaven's Elysium?\u201d Li Tianming asked.\u201cLin Xiaoting. The Saintbeast War-Soul was enough to guarantee entry. His seclusion this time is a final stretch for him. Once he makes a breakthrough to the Unity stage, there will be people to collect him and bring to Heaven's Elysium. Did you know what my father said about this?\u201d Jiang Qingluan said.Li Tianming never imagined that Lin Xiaoting was facing such an opportunity. He could only count on his luck that he returned to Ignispolis in time, or he wouldn\u2019t even be able to find Lin Xiaoting. That also meant he had even less time to take his revenge. Once Lin Xiaoting leaves, where would Li Tianming find that mysterious Heaven\u2019s Elysium?\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d Li Tianming knew that Jiang Qingluan\u2019s father was the Vermilion Bird Emperor himself.\u201cHe said, the day Lin Xiaoting returns from Heaven's Elysium is the day he and Mu Yang will prostrate at Lin Xiaoting\u2019s feet.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dThat was enough to cast a glimpse on the power of Heaven's Elysium. A disciple who returned from there could make the emperor of a nation as well as the Sanctum Potentate submit? Just how powerful could he become?That was all Jiang Qingluan knew about Heaven's Elysium, so Li Tianming didn\u2019t ask anything more about it.\u201cSo basically, you all are going to the Abyssal Battlefield to fight for a single spot in Heaven's Elysium with the disciples from the sanctums of two other nations? The one who wins the Abyssal Trials will be selected to cultivate in Heaven\u2019s Elysium?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. And since it\u2019s organized by Heaven\u2019s Elysium, they will not be guaranteeing our safety, which means this is a really dangerous trip.\u201d\u201cI told her not to go, but she just won\u2019t listen,\u201d Jiang Feiling said with a puppy face.\u201cLing\u2019er, this is the only chance in my life to explore the world outside of Vermilion Bird. No matter how dangerous it is, I must give it a try,\u201d Jiang Qingluan said, just like how she had told Ling\u2019er countless times already. As a princess of the royal clan, she would not back off from danger.\u201cSo is Lin Xiaoting not taking part in the event?\u201d Li Tianming asked.\u201cHe\u2019s basically a member of Heaven's Elysium already, so of course he doesn't have to participate. Honestly, the chance of you having your revenge is quite low, since he'll be leaving any time now,\u201d Jiang Qingluan said.Li Tianming frowned. There was no way he would let Lin Xiaoting just leave like this.\u201cWho else will be attending the event?\u201d Li Tianming asked. He knew both Torch Dragon and Aquamarine had their own institutes, all of them competing with each other.\u201cMe, Mo Lin, Xing Que, Chen Yao, Wei Guohao, and Mu Qingqing,\u201d Jiang Qingluan counted.\u201cMu Qingqing\u2019s going too?\u201d\u201cDefinitely, it's her only chance of pursuing Lin Xiaoting. Why else do you think they are not married yet? She probably values this competition more than anyone else, since whether she would stay here for who knows how long or leave with him depends on it,\u201d Jiang Qingluan explained.Li Tianming understood now. By gifting the Saintbeast War-Soul to Lin Xiaoting, she had landed herself into a sticky situation instead. Was it karma? But if not for the Saintbeast War-Soul, Lin Xiaoting would not be chosen by Heaven's Elysium, and he wouldn\u2019t be pursuing a greater path without her, meaning that she wouldn\u2019t have faced the risk of being abandoned in the first place.How ironic.He always knew that Mu Qingqing was a hardworking person, and this time, she would probably do just about anything for the opportunity for a greater future.\u201cSounds like there\u2019s nothing I can do now?\u201d Li Tianming felt his head ache. He was unrelated to the Abyssal Trials, and could only sit back at home and watch. He had to stay for his mother, and to overtake Wei Guohao as soon as possible.Wait, Wei Guohao?\u201cHave the positions been confirmed yet?\u201d Li Tianming asked.\u201cNot yet. It\u2019s too dangerous and the parents are still considering it. For example, my father doesn\u2019t want me to participate.\u201d\u201cWhat about Wei Guohao?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s definitely going. He\u2019s representing Wei Manor, there\u2019s no way the Potentate will let him not go,\u201d Jiang Qingluan replied.\u201cSay, if I defeat him, can I replace him for the event?\u201d Li Tianming asked.\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cYou heard me.\u201d\u201cIf you keep dreaming, maybe. But in reality, it\u2019s all but impossible. First, his strength is miles beyond yours. Second, even if you defeat him, he is needed to represent the Wei Manor. The positions are decided by the Potentate, Vice-Potentate, the four guardians and the chancellors, and there\u2019s nothing you can do to change that.\u201dJiang Qingluan spoke the truth, but Li Tianming knew that this was his only chance. Nothing would change if he didn\u2019t act. Right now, all he cared about was that he needed to go to the Abyssal Battlefield, and whether he made it into Heaven's Elysium had no meaning to him.Before they made it into Heaven's Elysium, Lin Xiaoting and Mu Qingqing must die!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 98": "Chapter 98 - Come At Me All TogetherPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayHeaven\u2019s Sanctum had a Heavenly Leaderboard with only seven slots available on it, and the seven were known as the \u2018Heavenly Septuplets\u2019. These seven were the cream of the crop of the entire sanctum, and all of them would end up as the future pillars of Vermilion Bird.According to the leaderboard right now, the seven were, from top to bottom: Lin Xiaoting of Lightning Manor.Mo Lin of Occult Athenaeum.Jiang Qingluan of Vermilion Bird clan.Xing Que of Xing & Chen\u2019s Merchantry.Wei Guohao of Wei Manor.Chen Hao of Xing & Chen\u2019s Merchantry.Mu Qingqing of Lightning Manor.There were a total of six positions available for the Abyssal Beast Trials, so other than Lin Xiaoting who already had a place confirmed for him, the rest of the Heavenly Septuplets would fill in those positions.Out of the seven, Mu Qingqing had only recently taken over the seventh place, and she had been cultivating without rest just for a chance to go to the Battlefield. She used to have about the same talent as Li Tianming did, and it was thanks to Lin Xiaoting that she evolved her beast to seven-stars. Mu Qingqing was not a woman who would let anyone stop her ambitions.\u2026\u2026Li Tianming still did manage to bring Jiang Feiling with him when he finally left the Nebulous Pavilion. Jiang Qingluan may have a sharp tongue, but she was soft at heart, and eventually agreed after a bit of pleading from Jiang Feiling.\u201cWhy does she feel like a mother-in-law?\u201d Li Tianming laughed.Jiang Feiling pouted.\u201cBig brother, I\u2019m here to help you cultivate, not for you to find ways to tease me.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, if I want to tease you, I don\u2019t have to find ways to do it. Come on, smile, you pretty.\u201d\u201cNope.\u201dMeanwhile, the little chick nested itself in Li Tianming\u2019s hair, its face emotionless as it watched the couple joke around.\u201cCouples should explode!\u201d It hissed under its breath.Moments later, they arrived at the Flameyellow Pagoda. Li Tianming was prepared to spend quite some time there. The pagoda was always crowded with disciples. Most of them would cultivate in around the Flameyellow Rock, making use of the spiritual energy storm around it. Only a rare few could step foot on the second floor to cultivate, while the top floor was reserved only for the Heavenly Septuplets.Just as Li Tianming entered the pagoda, he saw two people walking down the stairs, one of them muscular while the other slim. They were no strangers to him, but it had been some time since he last saw them. They were Xing Que and Chen Hao from the Xing & Chen Merchantry.They descended the stairs just in time to see Li Tianming and Jiang Feiling walking into the pagoda, their eyes meeting his.\u201cLi Tianming, have you collected your free coffin yet?\u201d Xing Que snickered.But this time, the way they looked at Li Tianming was totally different. While the joke at the Hall of Ancestry was within expectations, stories of the boy with perfect synchronization had already shook the entire Ignispolis a few days back. Madam Xue Lan even broke a few of her most precious potteries when she heard that news.\u201cYour family has more people, save it for yourself.\u201d Li Tianming considered the conflict between them to be over. He had already humiliated Xue Lan for looking down on him and Wei Jing, and he saw no meaning in arguing with the two. Li Tianming had other foes to take care of, and he took Jiang Feiling\u2019s hands as they walked towards the rock.When Li Tianming held the hand of the number one beauty of Vermilion Bird, Xing Que and Chen Hao\u2019s expressions twitched visibly. They weren\u2019t just envious, but also puzzled. Why would Princess Ling associate herself with such a rat?\u201cPrincess Ling, do you know mixing with losers will affect your reputation? We have heard quite some rumors going on already,\u201d Chen Hao snorted.\u201cMind your own damn business.\u201d Jiang Feiling had had enough of these insults too, even letting out a curse that stunned Chen Hao.Li Tianming walked past them and was about to step into the rings when Xing Que spoke.\u201cLi Tianming, did you know that the previous time you fought Wei Lingxuan, she accidentally let slip of you and your mother\u2019s relationship with the Wei Manor? Now the whole sanctum knows about it already.\u201dThat was news to Li Tianming. He took a look around, and then noted that all the disciples were staring at him curiously. So, they all knew that he was Wei Tiancang\u2019s grandson, and Wei Lingxuan was actually his cousin?Well, at least he was no longer just a peasant from the countryside now. Wei Tiancang had forbidden him to reveal his own identity, but Mu Yang did encourage him to be more high-profile about it. Since Wei Lingxuan was the one who leaked it, he did not need to take responsibility.\u201cSo?\u201d Li Tianming stared at Xing Que.\u201cWell, nothing much. Except that we all know your shameless mother had left the family for twenty years, and only returned when she was about to die,\u201d Xing Que replied.\u201cWell, news like these spread fast, especially since both mother and son are birds of the same feather,\u201d Chen Hao continued.As they spoke, the disciples around didn\u2019t have strong reactions. It appeared that they have all heard of the news already.\u201cFrom what I heard, your mother has been imprisoned already. What a joke, abandoning the clan for twenty years and still having the face to come back and seek help,\u201d Xing Que added.\u201cXing Que, Chen Hao.\u201d Li Tianming stared at the two of them. \u201cThere is no strife between us, and I do not intend to make more enemies than I need to. But, if you insist, then the two of you can wait for the day I tear your faces off and make you two bow before me.\u201dLi Tianming would not let anyone insult his mother like this.\u201cHaha!\u201d The two snickered.\u201cGive me a break, look at your levels now, at twenty years old.\u201d\u201cDid you really think that you are invincible just because of your perfect synchronization? Then you should better get your brain checked.\u201d\u201cChallenge me anytime you want, I only need to use one hand.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t forget, we have yet to pay you back for beating up our little brother.\u201d The twins jeered, one line after another.\u201cSave the trash talk, when it\u2019s time, the two of you can come at me together.\u201d Li Tianming\u2019s lips curved, before he walked into the rings towards the Flameyellow Rock.As for Chen Hao and Xing Que, they would never know where Li Tianming got his confidence from.\u2026\u2026Li Tianming arrived in the fifth ring, a place reserved for him and him only ,out of bounds to anyone else. He sat down, cross-legged, his back facing the rest of the disciples.Jiang Feiling was immensely helpful for his cultivation, and allowed him to have an easier time in the spiritual energy storm. With her attached to him, Li Tianming was enjoying cultivation more and more.\u201cLing\u2019er, how long can you stay in my body?\u201d Li Tianming asked.\u201cAs long as I want. In fact, I can stay inside forever,\u201d Jiang Feiling said cheerfully.\u201cFor real? On anyone?\u201d Li Tianming asked.\u201cNo, the best was Qing\u2019er who had sixth-grade attachment, and I could only attach to her for three-fifths of a day.\u201d\u201cSo that means it's only one-fifth for someone with second-grade attachment?\u201d\u201cYes, perhaps even shorter.\u201dLi Tianming felt like Ling\u2019er was really a boon granted by the heavens. While she didn\u2019t have beast ki, nor any power to protect herself, she could benefit him tremendously. Her powers were maximised when used on him, and all of her skills would come in handy. In addition, she had seven more abilities sealed in her fingernails that had yet to be discovered.\u201cIf big brother can attend the Abyssal Trials, then I can hide inside of you. This is the first time that Qing\u2019er will be leaving me for so long and for a place so dangerous. I\u2019m really concerned about her safety.\u201d Jiang Feiling\u2019s were moody. Jiang Qingluan was even closer than a real sister to her.\u201cYou want me to bring you in?\u201d Li Tianming asked.\u201cSadly, that\u2019s not possible.\u201d Jiang Feiling sighed. The positions had been decided, and they were all members of the Heavenly Leaderboard, all of them worlds apart from Li Tianming.Li Tianming said nothing more. He continued to absorb and refine the energy from the spiritual energy storm together with the little chick. Words or promises were meaningless when he could be further empowering himself, to better his odds of defeating Wei Guohao.Despite his perfect synchronization, it was still quite a daunting task to cultivate inside the storm. It was as if Li Tianming was standing beneath a waterfall, with the weight of endless water crashing down onto him every second.Both he and Ying Huo\u2019s infernalsources were like bottomless pits,crazily absorbing spiritual energy with the aid of their Aeternal Infernal Codex. Their bodies started burning yet again, the heat even felt by Xing Que and Chen Hao who were cultivating in the fourth ring. As much as they despised Li Tianming, perfect synchronization was something to be envious about.Chen Hao frowned. \u201cWhat a waste of talent for someone like him to have perfect synchronization. If we had it, Heaven\u2019s Elysium would be within reach.\u201d\u201cI know. That\u2019s the only way for us to leave Vermilion Bird, and explore the world outside. We\u2019ll then get to see the rest of Flameyellow Continent with our own eyes,\u201d Xing Que said with a hint of wistfulness.\u201cFather has said that this is the most important chance we will ever get in our life. Even they did not get such a chance back in their time.\u201d\u201cThen we can\u2019t back down!\u201dOne of the reasons why Heaven\u2019s Sanctum was the best place to cultivate was because of the environment here. Not only were disciples here talented, the effort they put in were also unimaginable by ordinary folk.The most diligent of all was perhaps Li Tianming. For a dozen days, he kept on cultivating without leaving the innermost ring, even though the disciples behind his back had changed many times already.He wanted to put in all his efforts for this. Even when he got bored, he had Jiang Feiling to accompany him, and Ying Huo to talk with. With them by his sides, cultivation was as enjoyable as it could get.He could anticipate it coming. He was about to breakthrough once more.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 99": "Chapter 99 - Two Levels At Once!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe more Li Tianming converted spiritual energy into Aeternal Infernal Beast Ki, the more acclimatised he was with the spiritual energy storm raging around him. It had even gotten to the point where he could practice his new battle arts, and cultivate the illusion veins on his third eye on the side. For the past few days, Li Tianming had shifted his focus from converting beast ki to training his Flaming Shadow Flash and Three-Spring Heavy Strikes. Paced around the inner ring, he continued to practice his moves.Obviously, that had caused quite the commotion, and Li Tianming was soon the center of attention for many disciples cultivating in the pagoda. The discussions about him and his mother Wei Jing never ceased, but Li Tianming had long blotted them out, focusing only on his battle arts. After a while, the sight of a fiery figure circling the fifth rings and punching out regularly had become a fixed attraction in the pagoda. It was obvious with every punch that Li Tianming\u2019s postures were getting better, and his boxing art was integrating well with his movement art.\u201cDamn, not just perfect synchronization, but training battle arts beside the rock?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m level two synchronization level, but it\u2019s not like I can practice my moves in the second ring.\u201d\u201cHe really is a monster when it comes to cultivation. It\u2019s just too bad that he passed the prime age for cultivation already.\u201dLi Tianming didn\u2019t hear any of these, his mind fixated on punching out his fist towards the Flameyellow Rock. It was as if he used the rock as an imaginary enemy.Pow!Li Tianming used the first stance of his Three-Spring Heavy Strikes and punched the rock. While he did not touch the rock, the impact of the punch was met with the reacting force from the spiritual energy storm, giving him an accurate feedback on how his punch was.\u201cOnce more.\u201dLi Tianming craved for power. He needed it, he was running out of time!Pow! Pow!Li Tianming\u2019s strikes got more and more powerful, as the impacts clashed with the storm from the rock. That was even more shocking to the disciples of the sanctum. How could someone punch the treasure and show it such disrespect?But that was exactly what Li Tianming did. For days, he made use of the feedback from the spiritual energy storm to learn his advanced source-ranked arts until he could execute them successfully. Even his strikes were increasing in power as well. On the fifth day since he started practicing his boxing arts, Li Tianming noticed that when the impact of his punch landed on the Flameyellow Rock, the black heavenly patterns on it seemed to move. With each punch, the patterns continued to wiggle, causing the formation to change. Li Tianming could almost feel that the Flameyellow Rock was a living thing that was interacting with him! Jiang Feiling did mention to him before that throughout the course of time, the rock even developed its own self conscious. If then, was that the rock\u2019s consciousness playing games with him?Li Tianming was amused.\u201cTake that!\u201d He increased the speed of his punches, his fist getting closer and closer to the rock. That being said, as long as he didn't make direct contact with the rock, he would be fine.Pow! Pow! Pow!The stronger and faster his attacks were, the greater the changes to the heavenly patterns on the rock.\u201cWhy do I feel like the patterns are congregating?\u201d Jiang Feiling suddenly pointed out.\u201cI think you are right.\u201d Li Tianming saw it too. Initially, the patterns were spread across the surface of the rock like a formation, but whenever he punched towards the rock, the patterns seemed to wriggle towards him.The quicker he punched it, the faster the patterns moved. Like uncountable black tadpoles, the patterns were concentrated in Li Tianming\u2019s area.\u201cWhat if I group them all together?\u201dHeavenly patterns were said to be the most mysterious thing in this world. For a beastmaster to cultivate beyond Unity, he would have to first understand the mystery behind the heavenly patterns.In the world of cultivation, Beast Vein, Spiritsource, and Unity were stages that focused on the usage of the lifebound beast\u2019s bloodlines. But once a cultivator reached Heavenly Will and above, the beastmaster\u2019s intelligence would play a more important role, as he guided his beast in their cultivation. Simply put, in the early stages the lifebound beast\u2019s bloodline and spiritsource abilities would decide the tide of battle, while in the later stages the beastmaster will use his intelligence to guide them in understanding the mysteries of heaven and earth.Li Tianming was only at Spiritsource, so he knew nothing of the knowledge concealed within the heavenly patterns. He could, however, feel that something peculiar was happening.\u201cMore!\u201dHe continued throwing his fist out, one strike after another. The patterns gradually gathered around the area of impact.\u201cNearly there!\u201dA large patch of black was directly in front of him. At this rate, the patterns would all congregate and form a black circle right in front of him in another fifteen minutes.\u201cWhat is Li Tianming doing?\u201d\u201cThe heavenly patterns are changing!\u201d\u201cThey are all gathering together.\u201dIt was a change never seen before on the Flameyellow Rock.\u201cQuick, get the supernal mentors!\u201d\u201cHurry!\u201dThe disciples of the sanctum had no idea what was happening, but the changes to the Flameyellow Rock was making them nervous. It didn\u2019t take long for some of them to scuttle off.Despite the commotion outside, Li Tianming remained concealed by the storm, his mind focused on punching towards the rock. He had nearly achieved his goal, and naturally, whatever happening outside wasn\u2019t of interest to him. Unknown to him, the disciples had brought Vice-Potentate Mu Yang over. Beside him was another middle-aged man, his eyes resembling stars. If Li Tianming turned around, he would immediately recognise that man \u2014 he was Sage Chen.\u201cWhat\u2019s he doing?\u201d Sage Chen noticed Li Tianming the moment he walked in.\u201cI don\u2019t know, I have never seen the rock behave like this.\u201d Equally puzzled, Mu Yang himself was on the verge of walking up to check out the situation.At that moment, Li Tianming punched out one last time, a punch that made all the patterns gather into a black circle. For a moment, time seemed to come to a standstill, the black circle painfully perfect.But at the very next second, a terrifying suction pulled at Li Tianming ! It was a force that he could not defend against, as if the Flameyellow Rock was throwing a fit at him. The rock sucked Li Tianming towards it, and his whole body rammed into the rock!If someone tried to just touch the rock, the spiritual energy storm was enough to rip the aggressor into pieces. But now, Li Tianming\u2019s entire body was stuck onto the rock, every inch of his skin in contact with the heavenly patterns! He wasn\u2019t the only one, as the little chick was sucked to the rock too, with its wings spread wide as if it just had a fall.\u201cOh, shit.\u201dBoth Mu Yang and Sage Chen realised that Li Tianming might have enraged the Flameyellow Rock. Things didn\u2019t look good, and Li Tianming might be ripped into pieces any second now. The two of them dashed towards the rock simultaneously.\u201cGet out of the way!\u201d Mu Yang roared. It was a situation they had never experienced before, and even he couldn\u2019t be sure what would happen next.The disciples scattered from the rings, some of them still cursing at Li Tianming. Just what was he up to again.\u201cHe\u2019s better off dead,\u201d Chen Hao spat as he backed off from the rock.\u201cDon\u2019t you know curiosity kills the cat?\u201d Xing Que smirked.By then, Mu Yang and Sage Chen had both appeared in front of Li Tianming.\u201cGet him out?\u201d Sage Chen asked.\u201cWait, no. He\u2019s still cultivating!\u201d The disciples had never seen the Vice-Potentate so shocked before. They looked towards Li Tianming and realised that instead of a corpse, the fires on the boy was even stronger now.Li Tianming and the little chick were like vortexes, sucking in all the spiritual energy they could from the Flameyellow Rock.\u201cThe spiritual energy storm is gone\u2026 It\u2019s gathering spiritual energy and channeling it to Li Tianming? That\u2019s like cultivating with the best ores and herbs.\u201d Sage Chen frowned.In fact, this was the tamest the Flameyellow Rock had been since anyone could remember. The two of them were standing in what was supposed to be the fifth ring, but they could not feel the storm at all. That was because the spiritual energy was being channeled to Li Tianming in a far milder manner. But that didn\u2019t change the fact that it was even more effective than what perfect synchronization could offer him!Li Tianming could feel the speed of his cultivation multiplying.\u201cIt\u2019s overflowing, overflowing!\u201d The power surging into him was like a feast, as he watched his infernalsource rapidly expand. The Aeternal Infernal Beast Ki flowed through his body like magma, empowering his every cell.Third level of Spiritsource!But no, it wasn\u2019t over.Two hours later.\u201cTwo levels at once! Fourth level now!\u201dLi Tianming and Ying Huo made a breakthrough again, and the pair reached fourth level at an unimaginable speed. Credit had to go to Jiang Feiling too, since she had been helping to guide the spiritual energy in Li Tianming\u2019s body too.Even though he was just fourth level, with the nature of his Aeternal Infernal Beast Ki, his strength was probably even stronger than what he imagined!With an explosion, the rock blasted Li Tianming away. Seconds later, the heavenly patterns dispersed from the place where he was previously stuck to. It didn\u2019t take long before the spiritual energy storm reappeared \u2014 the Flameyellow Rock had returned to normal.When Li Tianming crawled back up from the floor, he could clearly feel newfound power running through his body.\u201cJust what did the Flameyellow Rock bless me with?\u201dLi Tianming even wanted to practice his boxing art once more, so that he could get more spiritual energy from the rock. But clearly that wasn\u2019t possible, since the rock had already rejected him. If it could, there was no reason to send him out. The Flameyellow Rock probably had its own limits, and it had reached that limit by helping Li Tianming attain fourth level Spiritsource.\u201cWell, that\u2019s fine. I can always try again next time.\u201d Li Tianming was happy enough with what he had obtained today. Even he himself didn\u2019t have a clear idea of how strong he was.But he did know one thing: he'd shocked everyone in the Flameyellow Pagoda yet again.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 100": "Chapter 100 - I Wouldn\u2019t Dream of IPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLi Tianming could sense a faint communication between him and the Flameyellow Rock\u2019s consciousness when he was punching away. As weird as it sounded, he felt that the rock had approved of him, which was why it had blessed him with the opportunity to gain two levels at once. But now, it was tired. Such a blessing had to be draining, even for a rock.But if the rock was willing to give him such an opportunity again, Li Tianming believed he could sense its call. For him, the Flameyellow Rock was like a close friend. A disciple gaining the recognition of the Flameyellow Rock...it was an indescribable feeling.Li Tianming stood up, everyone\u2019s eyes glued to him, Mu Yang and Sage Chen included.Just how is he not dead yet? What kind of a miracle is needed to pull this off?\u201cGood afternoon, everyone.\u201dLi Tianming tidied his attire. At the same time, Jiang Feiling had reverted to her physical form and materialized beside him, tired from the days of helping his cultivation.As for the little chick, it was still spewing sparks of fire energetically at one side.Mu Yang beckoned. \u201cCome here.\u201d\u201cGreetings, Vice-Potentate, Sage Chen.\u201d Li Tianming looked at the two in front of him. Both were legends of Ignispolis, prodigies of their generation, and pillars of the Vermilion Bird Nation.Oh, and they were both Wei Jing\u2019s wooers, far stronger and more handsome than Li Yanfeng.\u201cLi Tianming, I have heard so many stories about you recently,\u201d Sage Chen said with a smile, one side of his eyebrow raised.Li Tianming hurriedly replied, \u201cSage Chen, please don\u2019t worry about your loan. I promise to\u2014\u201d\u201cNo hurry. In fact, just tell me if you want more, I can continue lending as long as you can return ten times the amount.\u201d\u201cThank you, I guess, but that\u2019s not needed after all.\u201d Li Tianming shook his headMu Yang had heard about the debt between them from Sage Chen.\u201cTianming, what happened?\u201d Mu Yang asked.\u201cI don\u2019t know much either, other than what you have already seen,\u201d Li Tianming said.\u201cAre you injured? The Flameyellow Rock has never reacted like this before.\u201d\u201cNo. In fact, my strength improved,\u201d Li Tianming replied.\u201cNext time, don\u2019t mess about without my permission. The Flameyellow Rock is not something you can understand at your current level, and I\u2019m scared that something might happen to you,\u201d Mu Yang said. If anything did happen to Li Tianming, then how was he supposed to answer to Wei Jing?\u201cI don\u2019t see much of a problem. In fact, it seems like the rock approved of him,\u201d Sage Chen interrupted.\u201cKeep spewing rubbish. It\u2019s not like you\u2019ll be blamed if anything happens to him.\u201d Mu Yang rolled his eyes.\u201cTsk.\u201dWell, at least all was well now.\u201cVice-Potentate, I know what I\u2019m doing, and I will make sure nothing bad happens,\u201d Li Tianming assured him.\u201cFine then, just remember to take a break when you need to. Same goes to the rest of you.\u201d Mu Yang scanned the rest of the disciples. They were still amazed that Li Tianming survived this, Xing Que and Chen Hao included.Sage Chen saw the twins.\u201cThe two of you, come here.\u201dThey walked up, not forgetting to throw an unfriendly glare at Li Tianming.\u201cDon\u2019t bear any grudges. You all shouldn\u2019t be fighting amongst yourselves, so just shake your hands and make peace,\u201d said Sage Chen.He didn\u2019t want his own son to look for trouble with Li Tianming. Likewise, Li Tianming did not intend to fight with the twins, given their relationship with Sage Chen, who had helped him greatly.\u201cI will accept your apologies.\u201d Li Tianming held out his hand. He was willing to make peace, provided that they apologised for insulting Wei Jing.\u201cFather, he beat up Chen Yao, I have to take revenge for my little brother.\u201d However, Chen Hao was not willing to cooperate.\u201cTake what?\u201d Surprisingly, Sage Chen slapped Chen Hao without any hesitation, and sent the boy flying back into the air.People said that Sage Chen had a good temper, but this hardly looked like it. Still, it was surprising to see how he educated his own son without any mercy. The crowd could only pity Chen Hao, who was kneeling on the floor, his face swollen and tears about to fall off from his eyes.Why would Sage Chen educate his own son just for Li Tianming\u2019s sake? Well, it was simply because Li Tianming was generous enough to end their conflict under a senior\u2019s suggestion, but Chen Hao had refused it.\u201cXing Que, do you think the same way?\u201d After slapping Chen Hao, Sage Chen turned to Xing Que.\u201cUncle, I despise that person.\u201d Xing Que gritted his teeth.\u201cBe my guest then. But I have one word of advice for you,\u201d Sage Chen said.\u201cYes, uncle.\u201d\u201cBoth your father and I simply cannot believe that our sons have such low standards. With your current mentality and achievements, you are nothing compared to the two of us when we were your age,\u201d Sage Chen said calmly.Xing Que lowered his head when he heard that, his fists tightly clenched.\u201cEnough, leave the kids some face.\u201d Mu Yang interrupted, and requested Xing Que and Chen Hao to leave first.\u201cChen Hao.\u201d Before they left, Sage Chen called out.\u201cYes, father?\u201d Chen Hao hung his head.\u201cIf you are victorious in the Abyssal Trials, I will apologise for slapping you in front of everyone.\u201d\u201cI will remember that, father.\u201d With that, the duo left the Flameyellow Pagoda.Li Tianming must say that the slap looked painful.\u201cUncle Chen, I\u2019m in your debt. Even if they refuse to apologise to me, if anything happens in the future, I\u2019ll give them a chance.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t bother, just beat them up if they are in the wrong. Just keep them alive. Without trials and tribulations, how would they improve?\u201d Sage Chen curled his lips.\u201cTianming, stop boasting. You are still miles away from catching up with them. Brother Chen, let the kids deal with their own problems. Shall we?\u201d Mu Yang gestured.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Clearly, they had other matters to attend to, and it would seem that they had to leave soon.\u201cOh and Tianming, your mother misses you. Drop by and visit her when you are free.\u201d Mu Yang turned and said before they left. He had been the one taking care of Wei Jing for the past few days.\u201cSure.\u201d\u201cOh and if you could bring Princess Ling with you and let her see her daughter-in-law, that would be even better,\u201d Mu Yang teased. He definitely didn\u2019t look like someone who would make such a joke.\u201cNot yet.\u201d Jiang Feiling was stunned for a moment, her face blushing bright red immediately afterwards.\u201cNo problem, Vice-Potentate.\u201d Li Tianming answered. In fact, he wanted to return to the Wei Manor now, and let mother take a look at Jiang Feiling too.\u201cDear, shall we?\u201d\u201cDear your head. Don\u2019t spout nonsense, lest my father hears it.\u201d Jiang Feiling rubbed her forehead.\u201cOkay.\u201dAfter all, she was the Vermilion Bird Emperor\u2019s daughter, and her identity was that of a princess. She couldn\u2019t decide her own future without the Emperor\u2019s acknowledgement.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Ling\u2019er,\u201d Li Tianming said.\u201cIt\u2019s ok, big brother, don\u2019t take it to heart. Only time will tell if we are destined to be together,\u201d Jiang Feiling said gently.\u201cYou are right.\u201d\u201cBut I do want to visit Aunt Jing too, do you think I need to bring some gifts along?\u201d Jiang Feiling played with the tip of her dress, her face blushing a faint pink.\u201cIt\u2019s fine, you will be the best gift she can ever receive,\u201d Li Tianming said.\u201cHEY! What about ME?\u201d The little chick chipped in.\u201cYou? Maybe the best dinner for tonight.\u201d Li Tianming rolled his eyes.\u201cHoes before bros? What a bastard,\u201d Ying Huo retaliated.Those two were at it again. Jiang Feiling smiled, as she felt the warmth and happiness in her heart. She imagined the day when she would walk down the wedding hall with her pretty bridal dress, with this man by her side. But would it be possible? Would their hearts survive the test of time? She couldn\u2019t tell, and neither did she want to think about that.\u201cBig brother, let\u2019s go.\u201d She held onto Li Tianming\u2019s arms and made her choice.She was never afraid of rumours and slander, and neither would she fear looks of contempt and disappointment. The arm she held was warm and strong, as if it would shelter her from anything in this world.When she was attached to Li Tianming, she could feel what he felt, and look into his heart. It used to be scarred, but it was now vigorous once again, healed by her own efforts. Thinking of that had brought a smile to her face, yet there were tears flowing from the corner of her eyes.\u201cIs holding a handsome man\u2019s hand so touching that you cried?\u201d Li Tianming was looking ahead, but a smile crept up his lips too.\u201cNo, I was thinking about how you will be beaten to a pulp by Wei Lingxuan the moment you stepped back into Wei Manor. Thinking of the sad state you would be in made me cry.\u201d Jiang Feiling wiped away her tears.She looked up and glanced at the side of his face. The contour of his face, the curve of his lips, it all looked just like the face from her dreams.\u201cLing\u2019er, don\u2019t worry.\u201d Li Tianming gently squeezed her palms, \u201cToday is the first day I bring you to my mother, and I will make sure Wei Lingxuan can\u2019t even touch my hair. Do you believe me?\u201d\u201cNope.\u201d\u201cHa, then be prepared to get smacked in the face for looking down on me when I get my glorious victory later.\u201d Li Tianming smiled.\u201cBut would you really smack my face?\u201d She tilted her head and smiled.Li Tianming was taken aback. Her face was just too pretty, prettier than any sculpture or painting he could ever imagine. It wasn\u2019t just the appearance, but more of the clarity in her eyes.\u201cI would never dream of it,\u201d he said without hesitation.Li Tianming didn\u2019t know what made him do it, but he found his lips on her cheeks a moment later.\u201cBig brother\u2026\u201d Even if the contact was just for a split second, her heart trembled. She had never gotten struck by lightning before, but surely that was how it felt.\u201cMy bad.\u201d\u201cNo worries.\u201dTheir eyes met, and Li Tianming finally understood how beautiful love could be. It was a feeling like never before, and the two of them were in a world of their own.Or it would be, if not for the fact that there was an angsty, single little chick accompanying them.\u201cLook at y\u2019all. That was just a peck on the cheek. Gotta wonder how it\u2019ll be like when the two of you start plowing furrows in the bedsheets\u2026 \u201dAnd with that, the wonderful ambience that they had just up and vanished.\u201cYou little twat...\u201d If he could burn something with his sight, the little chick would have been a golden brown by now.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
