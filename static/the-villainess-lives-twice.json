She didn\u2019t know if it was broken or sprained, but it hurt anyway.She could no longer walk, so now she had no choice but to be dragged.Her broken arm hurt, too. The wrist that the knight twisted was swollen.When the knights threw her to the floor, Artizea rolled on the cold floor.\u201cHow could you kill Abe!\u201dThe Countess Phillies screamed so loudly, she could vomit blood.After shaking the arm of the maid who was holding her, she ran up to Artizea and slapped her on the cheek.Needless to say, the pain was unbearable because her mouth was so badly treated.Artizea rolled back onto the floor, feeling her gaze fade.\u201cWhat did Abe do to deserve that?! How could you kill your own nephew?! You\u2019re a bitch, you must suffer the same fate!\u201dArtizea looked at the Countess Phillies with a blurred vision.The Countess Phillies sobbing ran out the other side of the room. She intended to stab Artizea with anything she could find, whether it was a knife or a candlestick.Emperor Lawrence, who had been watching the situation closely, approached her. He grabbed her lovingly by the shoulder and said.\u201cCalm down, Emma.\u201d\u201cHow can I be calm? She killed my child! How can Your Majesty be so calm? Abe is your son too!\u201d\u201cTia is my sister, Emma. There must be a misunderstanding.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to get revenge! I\u2019m going to avenge my son!\u201dThe Countess Phillies fell to her knees and began to cry loudly.\u2018I see, Abe has been murdered.\u2019Artizea now knew what was going on.She looked at Lawrence. He looked sad and downcast,However, Artizea noticed a small sense of triumph in his eyes.It was clear that a conspiracy had been prepared against her.\u2018First, I will be blamed for murdering your son, making me a criminal. And then a series of accusations will follow one after another.\u2019In fact, she had actually committed many crimes, and Lawrence knew most of them.So there was no need for him to create false accusations against her.Clearly, the person who hatched this conspiracy was Emperor Lawrence himself.The Emperor said.\u201cI can\u2019t believe you committed such a crime, Tia. Did you really kill Abe?\u201dOne could hear a certain joy in his voice.Artizea tried to speak.But before she could open his mouth, the Countess Phillies screamed loudly.\u201cAfter that bitch\u2019s maid went to visit him, Abe suddenly vomited black blood and died!\u201dLawrence raised his hand and the knights brought in another woman. She was Artizea\u2019s maid.The maid knelt down in silence, and Lawrence asked her.\u201cIs it true that the Marchioness Rosan ordered you to poison Abe?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe maid answered politely.\u201cThe plan of the Marchioness Rosan was to kill Abe first, and then to kill His Majesty. That way, she would be able to take control of the empire.Everyone in this room buzzed with shock.Lawrence asked with a sad expression.\u201cDo you have anything to say about this?\u201dArtizea showed a dry smile.What the hell was he thinking?She had no intention of denying that she was evil. But being treated like a dumb person made her laugh.\u201cHis Majesty the Emperor, you know what kind of person I am, don\u2019t you? If I had wanted to take over the empire, I would have killed His Majesty, not Abe.\u201dWhat good would it do to kill Abe in such a careless way as to make everyone realize if Lawrence were still on the throne? It would only make him more careful.If she had come up with a plan, she would have killed Lawrence first without anyone knowing.\u201cTia, such words are useless. You\u2019ll have to clear up what happened.\u201dWhat good are excuses and explanations at this point? Lawrence had already decided to kill me.It was too late, no matter what I did, I had no way of surviving, since the emperor himself had decided to kill me for treason.\u201cI cannot believe it. Tia, how could you do such a thing?\u201d\u201cYour Majesty the Emperor, you are the only authority in this Empire.\u201dSaid Artizea.Her mouth was full of blood, and her tongue was ripped apart by her teeth.Still, if she could bear the pain, she could say a few more words.\u201cYou now carry the empire on your shoulders, so you should kick the habit of blaming others for everything. That\u2019s my last piece of advice.\u201d\u201cInsolence!\u201dThe knight hit her in the face again.\u201cTake the traitor away from here and lock her up!\u201dShe exclaimed.Artizea looked at Lawrence with her puffy eyes. However, he did not interfere.Artizea did not clearly remember what happened after that.She was tortured and forced to sign some documents.She was then taken to court, which was attended only by the emperor, a handful of nobles and officials.The accusers and witnesses presented one set of evidence after another.Some were truly evil acts committed by Artizea.Others were fabricated scandals, with horrible and perverse stories.Artizea had a sharp mind and a strong will.However, she did not have the physical strength to overcome torture.When she was tried, instead of defending herself, she did nothing, she was half-conscious and dazed.By the time the trial was over, she had become the worst villain in history, who had made a pact with the devil, in an attempt to rule the empire.Lawrence lamented with a false sigh.\u201cEven though you are my sister, the crimes you have committed are too great to be forgiven.\u201d\u201cYou have harmed our country with your words, your tongue will be cut out so that you do not commit the same crimes again, and your hands stained with innocent blood will also be cut out as an example to others. But I will spare your life.\u201dAs a result, Artizea was taken to the dungeon.The punishment executed was more severe than the established ones.Instead of being locked up in her house with her tongue and hands cut off, all her limbs were cut off and she was shackled in a deep, unfamiliar dungeon.***\u300c If your brother\u2019s doing well, you\u2019ll do well too.\u300dThat\u2019s what Artizea Rosan had been hearing all her life.Her mother was the Marchioness Miraila Rosan, and her father was Marquis Michael.Miraila was the lover of Emperor Gregor. All the aristocrats knew this.The imperial laws were against polygamy and required that chastity be maintained before marriage.Married men and women were forbidden to have love affairs with unmarried men and women.The Emperor was a man who was exposed to everyone\u2019s gaze. That said, it would be strange if such a powerful man was really a strict defender of monogamy.It was simply impossible for him to hide the fact that he had a relationship with the Marchioness Miraila Rosan.Michael Rosan was in a sorry state, old and dying. He had decided to exchange his own wife with the Emperor for a sapphire mine.The Marchioness Miraila became the Emperor\u2019s mistress and gave birth to a son.That was Lawrence.Everyone knew he was the Emperor\u2019s son. However, no one called him a prince, but neither did they call him the son of the Marquis Rosan.Miraila loved him, and so did Emperor Gregor.On the other hand, given the time of the relationship, it was clear that Artizea was not the emperor\u2019s daughter.Artizea did not resemble the emperor, nor even Miraila.Interestingly enough, she looked very much like Marquis Michael in his youth.\u300c Be good to your brother. It\u2019s all thanks to him that you\u2019re still alive. \u300dMiraila also told her.\u300c How could we continue to live as the Marquisate Family if not for your brother? Since you were born, unpleasant rumors have spread about you being the daughter of Marquis Rosan. \u300dMiraila\u2019s words always ended like this.\u300c You must live for your brother. We can only survive if your brother becomes the emperor. Do you think your brother will treat you badly once he ascends the throne? Your brother\u2019s success is the way our family will be happy. \u300dArtizea could not remember being loved by Miraila. Nor did she remember being happy.Artizea was only praised when she did something that benefited her brother Lawrence.From something trivial, like when Lawrence said the tea she made tasted good, to something bigger, like when Marquis Rosan\u2019s wealth was beneficial to Lawrence.Artizea was no fool.She knew that her mother\u2019s kindness would never be to her.But the desire to be loved that had been planted in her since her childhood was hard to control.She found it easy to invent reasons to justify it.Lawrence, Miraila, and Artizea were linked by blood ties.If Lawrence lost, they would all die. There has never been a case where someone, after winning the fight for the throne, left the family of his rivals alive.To survive.With that in mind, Artizea did anything.She had a talent for evil acts and conspiracies.She had falsely framed loyal subjects to provoke their death and ruined the state policy of the empire. She was also the one who made the citizens suffer and massacred countless people.She committed many more evil and trivial acts in the palace, including a series of murders.She was also the one who used the Saintess Licia, who was the hope of the people of the country, the hope of the empire, besides Artizea was guilty of her death.It was all for the sake of Lawrence so that he could ascend the throne. Even though she knew it was an excuse, she committed many crimes with ease.And so, at last, Lawrence was able to wear the emperor\u2019s crown.\u2018I knew this day would come.\u2019Artizea thought vaguely.Although she was the one who contributed most to making Lawrence the Emperor, she stood by in silence, expecting nothing. The reason, she was afraid.That\u2019s why she also dissolved the intelligence organization she had spent so much time and money on.She felt that after all she had done for Lawrence, at least he would let her live in peace.But Artizea knew too much. She had committed many crimes for him.So Lawrence cut out her tongue so she couldn\u2019t speak and he cut off her hands so she couldn\u2019t leave any records.That\u2019s how I must die for all the crimes I\u2019ve committed.When the hunt is over, the dog is boiled.Artizea was Lawrence\u2019s dog and this prison was her saucepan.\u201cHn\u2026\u201dAfter all, this is what I deserve. What other ending could I expect?Considering everything I\u2019ve done so far, I shouldn\u2019t hold Lawrence or Miraila responsible for my actions.Artizea laughed. Even without my tongue, I can still laugh.\\nNovel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 2": "Chapter 2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 2Translator: GoldArtizea was well aware of her evil acts.Therefore, she did not think about being recognized as a good person or being forgiven.But just once, she asked the Saintess Licia.\u300c don\u2019t you resent me? \u300dIt was a question she asked thinking that Licia naturally resented her.However, Licia smiled brightly with her gaunt face.\u300c Would you feel better if I resented you? Would that make you feel less guilty? \u300d\u300c\u2026\u300d\u300c What can I do? I\u2019ve already forgiven you. \u300dSaid the Saintess Licia with her pale white lips.Artizea had threatened her and forced her to marry Lawrence, because the saint\u2019s influence and symbolism were necessary to compensate for Lawrence\u2019s lack of legitimacy.The whole nation rejoiced to hear that the saintess would become the Crown Princess.Sometime later, during Lawrence\u2019s coronation, the flowers offered by the citizens to the empress piled up like mountains around the palace walls.The empire covered her body with gold and furs, and spread silk under her feet.A woman born in a poor barony on the northern borders became a person capable of possessing all the luxuries of the world.However, she looked pitiful in comparison to when she attended events in social circles without a single jewel, or when she travelled through endemic regions with infectious diseases, wearing worn out clothes that could not stop the cold wind.Her beautiful platinum-blond hair had lost its shine and was dry, and her light but lively skin was dimmed. Her thick red lips became pale and cracked.Lawrence had always been a person with abusive tendencies. In addition, he was now sensitive to the issue of his legitimacy to the throne.The combination of the two caused him to feel inferior and hate the acclaimed empress.Artizea tried to protect Licia from Lawrence.She was the one who dragged her into this hell, so at least she wanted to protect her. And she swore to herself that she would.However, at best, Artizea was only able to stop him from assaulting her in front of her. But she couldn\u2019t stop what was happening in the bedroom.Licia was wilting, isolated and abused in a prison decorated with gold pieces from the south.Licia\u2019s sacred power was powerful enough to save a dying person from death. But she was useless against her own disease.Still, Licia smiled at Artizea as she looked at her.\u300cTia, I\u2019m a much, much stronger person than you think. \u300d\u300cYour Majesty\u2026\u300d\u300cDespite everything you\u2019ve done to me or the reason you did; in the end it was me who decided to marry His Majesty Lawrence. So it\u2019s not your fault I\u2019m here, but mine. \u300dLicia said quietly.\u300cI know how hard it\u2019s been for you to survive so far. While that doesn\u2019t justify you hurting others\u2026 I\u2019ve decided to forgive you. \u300d\u300c\u2026 \u300d\u300cSo you can take my weight off the big load you carry on your shoulders, Tia. \u300dIt was Licia who was dying. However, it seemed more like Licia was comforting Artizea, she raised her hand and touched her cheek.\u300cThanks for coming to see me. You\u2019re the only one who really cared about me in this palace, except for the maids and the ladies-in-waiting. \u300d\u300cThat is not true. Even now, countless citizens are outside the palace praying on their knees. \u300d\u300cThose people only know the Saintess Empress, not me. \u300dAfter Licia said that, she asked hesitantly.\u300cTia, can you hold my hand? \u300d\u300cYes\u2026 \u300d\u300cI thought I\u2019d be terrified when the time came for me to die. But I\u2019m better than I thought. Is it because I\u2019m going to be in God\u2019s arms? \u300d\u300cSoon you\u2019ll be able to get up. \u300dEven though she knew that wouldn\u2019t happen, Artizea couldn\u2019t tell her.Licia said with a smile.\u300cCan I ask you a favor? \u300d\u300cEven if you ask me to bring you the heart of an ice dragon, I\u2019ll get it. \u300d\u300cNot exactly. Although\u2026 I hope this doesn\u2019t happen either, if you should ever meet Cedric\u2026 \u300d\u300cYes\u2026 \u300d\u300cTell him that Licia lived and died without regrets. \u300d\u300cI will, I promise. \u300dArtizea promised her. So, Licia held her hand tight.\u300cI\u2019m sorry. I couldn\u2019t save you\u2026 \u300d\u300cI\u2026 someone like me\u2026 \u300d\u300cIf there is another world to live again, I would like you to just call me Licia. \u300dThose were her last words.Tap, tap.Hearing the sound of footsteps coming down the stone steps, Artizea came to her senses.She couldn\u2019t tell clearly if she had been dreaming or if she had just been thinking about Licia.\u2018How long has it been since I was locked up in this dungeon?\u2019There were no side windows with bars.So she couldn\u2019t even see when the sun rise and set. Artizea had almost lost track of time.Once a day a jailer would bring her food. However, after a few days it was difficult to determine how much time had passed.At first, she was half unconscious because of the wounds from the torture. Now, the bleeding stopped and the wounds healed a bit, but the pain was terrible because of the aftermath.Her shoulders felt like they were about to tear, and the lower portion of her bloody body was covered in bruises.She was cold, but she did not know if it was because the prison was cold or because her blood was not circulating properly in her body.\u201cYou deserve it. You evil bitch.\u201d\u201cUggh\u2026\u201dInstead of making an effort to talk, Artizea remained silent.There was more than one person in the world who would want to see Artizea destroyed and dead. Among them, Venia would be able to sell her soul to the devil if she could stand in the front row.Venia was Licia\u2019s maid.It was Artizea who devastated the village where Venia\u2019s family lived. An epidemic broke out in that area.It was Licia who saved Venia from death, after she lost her whole family. From then on, Venia dedicated her life to serving Licia.All Venia\u2019s loved ones died because of Artizea. It is natural for Venia to hate her.When she saw that Artizea was staring at her in silence, Venia gritted her teeth and spat.\u201cYes, I know you don\u2019t have a tongue. Now you can\u2019t spread your poison with your words.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cJust as you are now, who could imagine that you were once the emperor\u2019s great conspirator.\u201dSlap!Venia slapped Artizea with all her might.\u201cIt\u2019s a pity that they have cut off all your limbs and your tongue, now I have nothing to cut.\u201dSlap!\u201cYou\u2019re a scum. Now you look at me with pity eyes?\u201dArtizea closed her eyes.Venia was right. Artizea did not deserve to be pitied.Venia was always loyal to Licia, even after her death.After Licia\u2019s death, she flattered the new empress and endured all sorts of things in order to remain in the imperial palace, with the sole aim of taking revenge on Artizea and Lawrence one day.Venia slapped her on the cheeks a few more times.Now, Artizea only had a few teeth left. Also, blood was spilling from her mouth because of the many wounds she had.Venia pulled out a handkerchief and wiped the blood off her hand. Then she untied Artizea from the fetters that were binding her.\u2018Why did you\u2026?\u2019Artizea thought it was strange.Venia said calmly.\u201cThese are Cedric\u2019s orders, although I wouldn\u2019t be content to tear you to pieces here a thousand times. He probably wants to execute you with his own hands as revenge for the people you\u2019ve killed.\u201d\u2018It can\u2019t be.\u2019Artizea knew the Grand Duke Cedric Evron much better than Venia.He was an honest and fair man, no matter what the reason, he would not go so far as to finish off a woman who had already fallen and been tortured.Besides, if she escaped from the dungeon, Venia could not return. The Imperial Palace was not such a simple place.It would soon be discovered that it was Venia who came down with the key and took her away.Venia was a subordinate and spy for Cedric Evron who served the empress.There is no way he would waste a chess piece as important as this. At least not on Artizea.Maybe Cedric Evron gave this order for another reason. Probably not because he wanted to publicly execute a tongue-less conspirator, but because he wanted to save the maid who belonged to his beloved Licia.Venia would not be willing to leave this place voluntarily without a reason.However, Venia didn\u2019t think that far ahead. After freeing Artizea, she took off her cloak and covered it up.After months of torture and the loss of her limbs, Venia could easily lift and carry her body by herself alone.Artizea was taken from the imperial palace in a laundry cart and then transported in a wagon.The constant shaking caused the fever to rise in her already weakened body.Halfway through, her consciousness became cloudy again.Artizea knew she was being transported, but she didn\u2019t know how.When she regained consciousness, she was in a tent. Her severed limbs had been wrapped with a clean bandage.The face of the old man who was caring for her looked familiar. He was Grand Duke Evron\u2019s butler.\u201cYou have awakened.\u201dDespite being the enemy, the butler spoke politely to her.\u201cYou\u2019d better eat something, if you can.\u201dArtizea blinked and shook her head.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. The doctor also said you probably wouldn\u2019t want to eat because of the state you\u2019re in. I\u2019ll make you some strong tea.\u201dThen the butler got up and left the tent.Artizea turned her head and looked around.There was nothing special about the tent.There was only a pot of boiling water, the bed where she was lying, and an oil lamp.The butler did not return alone. The cloth at the entrance to the tent opened and Cedric Evron entered.Artizea looked at him in shock.She hadn\u2019t seen him in years, but he hadn\u2019t changed. Only his vivid black eyes seemed deeper than before.\u201cIt has been a long time since we last saw each other, Marchioness Rosan.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI heard they cut out your tongue.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cThe person who was once the greatest conspirator in the whole empire seems to have been unable to save herself, right?\u201dArtizea closed her eyes.She lamented the stupidity of having committed all those crimes for Lawrence, knowing she would be betrayed.But she didn\u2019t feel guilty.All the humans in the world are evil. Even more so those who come close to power.That was Artizea\u2019s firm belief.But in front of two people in the world, Cedric Evron and Saintess Licia, she was not able to say that.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 3": "Chapter 3Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 3Translator: GoldArtizea once destroyed the Ava River embankment to frame Cedric.At that time, Cedric was returning from controlling the situation on the western border of the empire by order of Emperor Gregor.The emperor notified him through an imperial emissary to return the command and control of the commander-in-chief of the army and to hurry back to the capital alone.It was then that Artizea destroyed the embankment.Several cities and villages were swept away.The number of people directly affected was estimated to be only about 30,000 at most. The paddy fields were also damaged, but since this was a good harvest year, there was no danger that the whole country would be plunged into famine.In any case, the most beneficial thing for him would have been to leave the Ava River and return to the capital under the emperor\u2019s orders.But Cedric did not. He chose to use the army to minimise the flood damage.However, since he did not return, but acted as commander-in-chief of the army, this aroused the suspicion of the Emperor.Artizea did this because she knew that Cedric was this kind of person. The same thing happened when Artizea discovered and blamed a village for being rebels in the territory of Grand Duke Evron, or when he devised a plan to get rid of Grand Duke Roygar, and even when the epidemic spread.Even knowing what might happen to him, in the end he always chose to save the people.This cost him his position and he ended up becoming a fugitive.\u201cPlease have some tea.\u201dThe butler spoke politely and gave Cedric an iron cup.Then he sat next to Artizea and he brought a cup of strong tea, full of sugar and milk, to her mouth.Cedric sat down in front of Artizea, while he drank the tea. As if it was tea time.Artizea looked at him blankly, thinking of Licia\u2019s will.\u300cIf you ever meet Cedric, please tell him that Licia lived and died without regrets.\u300dDeep down, Licia did not want Artizea and Cedric to meet again, as that would mean that he was finally defeated and taken back to the capital.But now the situation was exactly the opposite of what she thought at the time.Today, years later, Cedric and his forces were still alive.It was Artizea who fell. Artizea was taken to Cedric\u2019s camp and was now face to face with him.Under these circumstances, Licia would have wanted her to convey the message.But Artizea could not keep the promise she had made to Licia. Because she was not able to speak.Cedric stood up when the butler finished pouring all the tea into Artizea\u2019s mouth.\u201cLet\u2019s go out.\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201dArtizea awoke from her thoughts and looked at him incredulously.Cedric approached her and gently lifted her up.Artizea struggled to free himself from his grip, unlike with Venia. This time she was embarrassed.But she couldn\u2019t resist the strength of Cedric\u2019s arms.He picked her up in his arms and as he left the tent, knights in military uniforms rushed up to her.The knights were all dirty from their constant running away.\u201cYour Grace.\u201d\u201cGrand Duke.\u201dWhere does he take the wicked woman?\u201d\u201cI have unfinished business.\u201d\u201cWe will transport her.\u201dThe knights held out their hands. Cedric turned to the side, avoiding their hands.\u201cDo not speak of people as if they were objects.\u201d\u201cWhat is he saying? Your Grace is being too kind to the devil.\u201d\u201cStay here. I\u2019ll go alone.\u201d\u201cNo way.\u201dThe knights were scared.\u201cThe Marchioness Rosan, she has no arms or legs, she could not harm me.\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t be so sure of that!\u201d\u201cThat witch is capable of causing a disaster with her tongue alone.\u201d\u201cUnfortunately, the Marchioness Rosan doesn\u2019t have a tongue either.\u201dSaid Cedric, clicking his tongue.He strode across the military camp. Then he mounted Artizea on the horse and he climbed behind.Because she did not have her limbs intact, he could not ride her in the back, so this was the easiest way to carry her.Artizea shuddered. She\u2019s never been this close to a man before.The heat from her chest against her back caused her body temperature to rise.Cedric rode out of the camp.It was drizzling.Looking at the mountains and the streams, Artizea realized that this was the Barquee region belonging to the Grand Duke Roygar.Barquee was the granary of the eastern part of the Empire.It could not be compared with the vast plains of the western, but the abundance of water and the mild climate, allowed all kinds of cereals and fruits to be grown here.The best wine in the Empire was also produced here.But now there was no trace of it left.Smoke rose from the charred ground. While he was riding she could only see the remains of houses.There were corpses everywhere, the vast majority being the bodies of men.The city was also destroyed.Only the rubble of the walls remained, and the survivors, crouched beneath the walls of their destroyed homes, looked up at the two of them with a glint in their eyes.Artizea stared at the scene in a daze, not understanding what had happened.What had happened while she was in prison.There should have been no war in Barquee.\u201cThis happened because a native of Barquee was found to have planned an assassination attempt against Lawrence with the Grand Duke Roygar 12 years ago.\u201dArtizea was breathless, his heartbeat accelerated.This was an unnecessary massacre.Lawrence was already emperor and had the imperial army at his disposal.The imperial power was solid and stronger than ever. It was Artizea who made this possible.Lawrence had to keep himself clean. So such things had always been Artizea\u2019s responsibility.That was the task Milera imposed on Artizea and she faithfully carried out her duty.So now, without her, Lawrence could have become the perfect emperor.Do you find that surprising and shocking? This is what you used to do too, Marchioness Rosan.\u201dCedric said quietly.\u201cThis was either necessary or unnecessary. I know that\u2019s what you think to execute your schemes. Perhaps this is something that Lawrence considered necessary.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cOr do you believe, Marchioness Rosan, that your judgment is absolute and Lawrence\u2019s is not?\u201dArtizea was speechless.\u201cIf so, no wonder you\u2019ve been expelled.\u201dCedric said, with a change in his tone.***Then Cedric formed a small, separate troop and moved from place to place. Artizea was taken on the butler\u2019s horse and moved with the small troop.There were many other places that had suffered a terrible fate.No one took care of the plagues of locusts, the aftermath of the civil wars, or the restoration of the embankments.Nor did the granary exist.Every road was overflowing with wandering people and infested with contagious diseases. Carcasses that had not been collected were scattered everywhere.The politics of the empire were not just a disaster in the last year or two.Emperor Gregor was self-centered and selfish, a man who put his authority ahead of the lives of his people.The struggle for succession ended up ruining the country, Artizea took the initiative to make that happen.Artizea thought that once Lawrence became emperor, he would be able to restore the empire.There was hope for the Empire when Licia was Empress.Even after her death, there was an effort on Artizea\u2019s part to do something to change the situation while she was at Lawrence\u2019s side.But now the imperial family seemed to have abandoned everything.Artizea had already understood what Cedric was trying to tell her.Instead of condemning her with his mouth as Venia did, he seemed to want to show her the consequences of what she had done.\u201cMiraila is dead. I heard that she was still scolding Lawrence on the subject of women.\u201dThe day they arrived at the village of the rebels on the other side of the northern ridge, he broke the news.Artizea was too exhausted to be surprised by the news.In the village of the rebels, only the graves remained, with thousands of shadows cast by the wooden crosses.This village was not really a rebel village.It was the place where people fled when Emperor Gregor killed Cedric\u2019s parents, accusing them of treason.Later, the truth came out and the empire recognised it. The wanted list of those who fled was also lifted.Still, they did not leave the village where they lived, trusting and supporting each other.Licia was also from this village, and Venia\u2019s family also lived in hiding here.Cedric, who had no other blood relatives, found comfort among the villagers.Artizea knew this.This was a terrible thing.Artizea had just learned about the construction of these tombs.\u2018Did Cedric make all these tombs himself? Did he bring me here with the intention of making me reflect?\u2019Artizea thought.After standing silently for a long time on the hill overlooking the whole village, Cedric took her back to the military camp with him.\u201cI don\u2019t think you ever imagined that Lawrence would end up like this, Marchioness Rosan.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI knew he was very bad and perverse. But if I had started fighting for the throne, I was convinced that defeat would have been worse than death.\u201dArtizea was anxious about another matter.\u2018Why doesn\u2019t he ask about Licia? Why doesn\u2019t he ask how the Saintess died, who tried to protect him at all costs?\u2019So much so that Miraila was killed because of the women\u2019s issue. Cedric should know by now how Lawrence treated women.Therefore, it would be logical that he blame Artizea for taking Licia away from him and forcing her to marry Lawrence.But he didn\u2019t. His stiff face looked like a public statue erected in a town square.\u201cBut I did not expect to see such tyranny. Why the hell is he doing this? Now that the Crates Empire belongs to him. Has he no desire to protect his people, to save and make this place great?\u201dIn any case, Artizea could not answer because she had no tongue.She looked down. She just wanted to know. Why was Lawrence like that?\u201cDevise a plan.\u201dThen she raised her head in astonishment at Cedric\u2019s words.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

However, the power gap is too big. My subordinates and I only know about military affairs, we have no idea how to narrow that gap.\u201dArtizea stared at him blankly.Cedric\u2019s face, which she had thought was like a statue, had become a blazing sun.He didn\u2019t raise his voice. Yet for Artizea it was as if he had roared.\u201cI know you\u2019re a very intelligent woman.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t have the insight to choose correctly who to serve, but I think you were blinded by affection for your family. Though you made many horrible schemes, I know it was for Lawrence.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cThe only person who can reverse this situation is you. Marchioness Rosan, I need your help.\u201dCedric bowed his head.But as if he didn\u2019t think that was enough, he got down on his knees, put his hands on the floor and bent his back until his forehead almost touched the ground.Artizea was startled.She shook her limbs. If it wasn\u2019t for the butler who held her, she would have fallen, as she could barely sit up straight.Cedric raised his head. His black pupils were like burning coals.\u201cYou no longer have Lawrence\u2019s affection or that of your family. When you look around the empire, don\u2019t you regret how it fell into ruins?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI know you were just a schemer following orders, not a devil. Unlike Lawrence. Didn\u2019t you ever think to do anything good with the power you had?\u201dArtizea shook her head.She thought she had no right to regret it.People were right.If there was a witch who had made a pact with the devil, that would be her.Even if she had changed her mind, she had no tongue to speak and no hands to write.She couldn\u2019t even think straight with her tired and aching body.\u201cMarchioness Rosan, you still have a brilliant mind. You can write by holding a pen in your mouth, or you can point to the words with the help of another person. As long as you live, you can accomplish anything if you have the determination and will to do so. I need you.\u201dArtizea looked at him for a while, her vision blurred.It was funny.She had never heard Lawrence, the person she had dedicated her life to, say he needed her.She knew Cedric.As an enemy, she knew him better than anyone else in the world.The resentment in his heart should be hotter than a valley of lava. The people around him would expect him to kill her fiercely.But he was kneeling before her. All for a good cause.However, Artizea could only shake her head again.She was only good at persuading others to do her favors, to plot, to murder, and to scheme. She did not master tactical strategies.Artizea couldn\u2019t accomplish something Cedric wasn\u2019t capable of.Even if she were a truly brilliant strategist, there was no way to overcome the current imbalance of power.\u201cI see.\u201dCedric seemed to understand quickly why Artizea shook her head.\u201cEven you can\u2019t do anything about it.\u201dHe said grimly.Tears fell from Artizea\u2019s eyes.She had decided from the first time her hands were stained with blood, that she would regret nothing until the day she died.All the things she had done, cannot be forgiven just because she regrets them later.Even if the dead held some resentment against her, she thought that what they must resent is the fate of having been born into this world.No one is innocent in the world after being born.No. Even a newborn baby is a sinner for being born.Just like her. And so is Lawrence.Still, she regretted it.In fact, the regrets accumulated deep in her heart came together like a huge rock that struck his heart.\u201cI\u2019m sorry I was reckless with my words.\u201dCedric stood up.\u201cI can\u2019t give you better accommodation because of the poor conditions in the military camp, but I\u2019ll soon send you to the countryside with some of my men. I hope you can live in peace for the rest of your life.\u201dArtizea looked at him, unable to say anything and shedding tears.That night she was huddled in the tent, thinking to herself, of a way to fix everything.In the current situation, there was no way.But the truth was that Artizea had a method.She crawled slowly and sat down.She didn\u2019t want to use this method. Because she was a sinner.Artizea didn\u2019t believe that Lawrence was to blame for her sins.She just wanted to die and rot, embracing all the evil she had done for Lawrence.But\u2026\u2018There is no plan, but there is a method.\u2019If the balance of power was too tilted to be reversed, then she must only turn back time before the balance of power tipped.Artizea bit off what was left of her tongue, then started drawing a magic circle with the blood.Magic has long since disappeared from this world.However, the method of using magic is still passed on.Precise magic circles drawn in blood, and human sacrifices.In fact, the main reason for the disappearance of magic was not due to human sacrifices, but the fact that there were few people who could accurately draw a magic circle.The characters of the magic circles are written in an ancient language.Even if someone could copy them, no one could activate them at will.But Artizea could.She was one of the few people who could easily write the ancient characters of that dead language.She had studied the magic circles to use them in evil acts.Although the bleeding did not stop, Artizea bit her tongue many times and also bit the inside of her mouth to bleed even more.She had to draw a magic circle of considerable size with the spilled blood.She drew the magic circle all night long.There would be no second chances, so she had to draw it correctly on this one occasion.Halfway through, her vision became blurred, and she had to bite her tongue harder to stay awake.Before dawn she finally managed to finish, and collapsed on the magic circle due to great blood loss.\u2018It\u2019s a proper human sacrifice.\u2019Artizea closed his eyes helplessly.The magic circle that would take her life began to glow blue.Cedric, who realized that something strange was happening in the tent, rushed in and looked at her in amazement.But the magic circle had already begun to work and required no further sacrifice.There was a flash of light that prevented him from approaching.\u2018I hope that your wishes will come true in your next life.\u2019That was Artizea\u2019s last thought.The magic soon became a pillar of light that extended to the ends of the sky and illuminated the night sky.***When she opened her eyes, it was almost dawn.Artizea moved her feet under the blanket and then moved her hands.Finally, she touched her tongue with a finger.She tried to speak out loud. Her voice came out loud and clear.\u201cDid I make a mistake in the magic?\u201dThe ancient characters written on the magic circle meant < In return for Artizea Rosan\u2019s life, time will return, turn back time. > For that reason, Artizea thought she was going to die.But now she was alive.There were no wounds or pain in her body. However, the huge rock formed by her regrets continued to strike at her heart.Feeling strange, she raised her hand.The moonlight filtered through the window and dyed her nails blue.Artizea looked at her nails in silence, took off her sheets and got off the bed.Then she lit the lamp and went out to look at herself in the mirror.\u201cI have returned.\u201dIn the mirror was a girl with bright blond hair and turquoise eyes.She touched her cheek with her fingertips. She felt that her own face was not hers.\u2018Did my face look like this?\u2019She realized that she had never cared for herself.She had only seen herself a few times in the mirror. Because she hated that her face was different from Lawrence and Miraila\u2019s.Miraila often said she was so ugly that she didn\u2019t even want to look at her.Lawrence rarely looked at her directly.However, between siblings it was normal not to notice each other\u2019s appearance. Although Artizea was obliged to do so since she was in charge of Lawrance\u2019s image for social events.Artizea turned around and went back to her bedroom.She had no plans to return herself. Her goal was to give Cedric another chance.Without her, Lawrence\u2019s power would be greatly weakened.Miraila had an exceptional ability to manipulate the emperor, but she possessed an impulsive personality.No matter how much effort she put into her schemes, she would always leave some trace.From the beginning, Lawrence was not the kind of person to conspire.Besides, he was originally the only one who distrusted Cedric.Back then, as he was the emperor\u2019s nephew and had not yet excelled, Artizea kept him under control by tying his hands and feet.If she had done nothing, Cedric could have preserved his power until the decisive moment.Even after all the damage she did to him, he survived to the end and resisted Lawrence.\u2018The important thing is that I have returned.\u2019Whether it was a magic circle glitch or some other problem, there must be a reason why she has survived.\u300c I need your help.\u300dArtizea remembered the moment when Cedric had bowed his head to her.She felt a weight on her chest and gently placed her hand on her left breast.\u2018In return for kneeling before the devil, you got the devil to get his hands dirty for you.\u2019It was like a promise.Artizea went to his desk.At the bottom of the desk drawer was his diary. She took it out and opened the diary on the last page.< June 2nd, 482 in the Imperial Calendar >Eight days ago, Artizea turned 18.It was almost two years before her 20th birthday, when she would inherit the title of Marchioness Rosan.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The temperature drops as it gets dark.\u201d\u201cBut as soon as the sun comes up, it starts to get hot. If you don\u2019t have an appetite, let me know. I\u2019ll talk to the chef to prepare your favorite food, winter melon soup.\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s fine.\u201dWith one graceful move, Lawrence shoved the cut fish into his mouth. Since she was a child, Artizea had envied Miraila\u2019s attentions to her brother. Because she did not receive the same love from her mother.So, wanting to get a little closer to both of them, she sat as close to them as possible.And in Miraila\u2019s absence, she looked after Lawrence, thinking it was her duty.Even after she realized it wasn\u2019t her duty, she convinced herself to do it.Lawrence was someone of value, who would be able to become the emperor. Lawrence was also the one who would make Miraila an honorable and distinguished person in the future.So, of course, he would be treasured. Artizea was not in the same position.But now, she had no interest in either of them.During her torture, her lingering feelings for Lawrence disappeared. Her attachment to Miraila had disappeared before that.She knew that her existence was like a tumor to Miraila. Similar to the late Marquis Rosan.Artizea finished breakfast, she only ate the bread and salad.She didn\u2019t have much of an appetite. Besides, she wanted to get out quickly to check the current situation.The Salmon Meuni\u00e8re, which had been prepared as the main dish for breakfast, was not even placed in front of her.As she wiped her mouth and stood up, Miraila said abruptly.\u201cYour brother hasn\u2019t finished half his meal yet, but are you getting up already?\u201dOnly then did Miraila realize that Artizea was not sitting next to her as usual, but she was sitting in a distant seat.Her beautiful brown eyes rounded.In the past, Artizea would have apologized, but not now.\u201cI don\u2019t have much of an appetite. Besides, you always told me I had to lose some weight.\u201dArtizea said calmly.In her childhood before she was ten, she was chubby.Miraila always told her she was too fat and ate too much. That she should eat little like birds to maintain her figure.Because of that, Artizea developed an eating disorder at that time.If she didn\u2019t eat anything, she would only have bones, so Miraila shouldn\u2019t tell her to lose weight.However, Miraila used to tell her all the time that she had to lose weight.Miraila got angry.\u201cBut you must keep your table manners\u2026\u201d\u201cToday I\u2019d like to visit the temple outside the city. Is that okay, brother?\u201dShe asked Lawrence for permission to go out, as she was sure that Miraila would not give it to her. That way, Artizea would also avoid hearing her reproaches.The only thing that Lawrence cared about Artizea was her ability to serve. He didn\u2019t care for her as a younger sister.Miraila was about to explode, but she stopped when Lawrence slowly opened his mouth.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, you can go.\u201d\u201cThank you, brother.\u201dSaid Artizea, making Miraila rethink the words she would say.Then Miraila said in a radiant voice.\u201cHow can you be so considerate? You even think about your sister\u2026\u201dArtizea had a lot of things to do and she couldn\u2019t worry about that.When she came out, Alice, a maid close to her, approached her quickly.\u201cMy lady, didn\u2019t you eat well again? Why did you leave so soon? Usually you\u2026\u201d\u201cAlice.\u201dArtizea stared at Alice.She felt a little nostalgic.Alice was her first personal maid. She was perceptive and loyal, but because of that, she was poisoned instead of Artizea.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat is the matter, my lady?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201dNot knowing what to say, Artizea just turned her head.At that time, Artizea tried to take care of Alice\u2019s family members for the rest of their lives, because she was always loyal to her.What happened to Alice\u2019s family after she was incarcerated?Not only with Alice\u2019s family, but also with the other families of those who died for Artizea.Artizea had designed a structure to ensure that financial support would continue to be given no matter what happened to her.She was also in charge of hiding the money and its link to that, in case something bad happened.Considering that she was being more careful after she had eliminated all her political enemies, she had probably been suspicious of Lawrence long before she was falsely accused.\u201cMy lady, are you laughing?\u201d\u201cDid I laugh?\u201d\u201cYes. In this way.\u201dAlice laughed, mimicking her expression.Artizea did not even show the faintest smile and turned around instead.Even if it was an encounter after 20 years, her personality did not allow her to rejoice and embrace the other person with joy.\u201cI\u2019m going out. I\u2019m going to the Temple.\u201d\u201cYes, my lady.\u201d\u201cAlice, come.\u201dArtizea gestured for her to come closer.Alice leaned down and brought her ear to Artizea\u2019s lips.Artizea whispered to her what she had to do.When Alice straightened up, she said.\u201cSo, go to the kitchen and prepare a lunch box with sandwiches stuffed with plenty of meat.\u201d\u201cOh, my lady. Have you finally decided to stop dieting?\u201d\u201cI think I need to strengthen my body.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right. You need to eat more.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s uncomfortable to eat alone. So prepare and pack at least 5 more portions. Also, pack a picnic tea set.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dAlice was confused. But she had never questioned Artizea\u2019s decisions.\u201cI don\u2019t have much time, so do it quickly. Sophie will get me dressed.\u201d\u201cYes, my lady.\u201dAlice left quickly.Artizea went slowly to her room.After breakfast, Artizea usually changed into her afternoon dress. That\u2019s why Sophie was already in front of her boudoir.\u201cWhich dress do you wish to wear?\u201d\u201cBeige\u2026 no, better green.\u201dSaid Artizea, thinking it would be annoying if the dress got dirty.Artizea didn\u2019t have many clothes.Unlike Miraila who had four dressing rooms full of clothes, Artizea had a boudoir with almost nothing.When Miraila was getting dressed there were about 20 maids around her serving her. On the other hand, Artizea only had Sophie to serve her.Just by saying \u2018green\u2019, Sophie knew which dress she was talking about and ran quickly to the closet.However, it was a long time since she wore formal dresses.Miraila did not like going out with Artizea, and she did not like the idea of Artizea having contact with outsiders.She always told her that it was embarrassing that her horrible daughter was out and about.Artizea didn\u2019t completely believe her words.From Miraila\u2019s perspective, Artizea was proof that she had betrayed the emperor, so she did not want to show her in public.However, she could not yet look directly into the mirror and appreciate her face.Sophie took off Artizea\u2019s outer garment and she sat down in front of the dressing table.Then she asked Artizea, although she knew that she didn\u2019t care.\u201cHow would you like your hair done?\u201d\u201cNeatly\u2026 no.\u201dArtizea took a deep breath and said something she had never said in her life.\u201cMake it pretty.\u201d\u201cOh my.\u201dSophie was surprised but immediately smiled brightly.\u201cWell, I guess you\u2019re at that age too.\u201d\u201cWhat age?\u201d\u201cYou want to look pretty and date handsome guys.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t talk nonsense. I\u2019ll just go to the temple.\u201d\u201cYou could meet someone at the temple. Maybe it\u2019s a charming knight or someone like that.\u201d\u201cWho would put me in their eyes?\u201dThis was the first time she said anything like that.The appearance was important. Thinking about what she was going to do today, it would actually be good to look pretty.However, it was not significant to her. Because her real value wasn\u2019t in looks.However, it seemed as if she really wanted to look pretty.She knew she couldn\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t have that kind of relationship with the person she was meeting today.Sophie opened her eyes wide and smiled.\u201cIsn\u2019t that what you expect?\u201d\u201cSophie.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll just make sure any man you meet is interested in you.\u201dSophie said cheerfully, as she curled Artizea\u2019s hair.\u201cMy lady, you can become the number one beauty in high society because you are naturally very beautiful. You just need to gain some weight and get some more sleep.\u201d\u201cNonsense.\u201d\u201cYou know you\u2019re Miraila\u2019s daughter. To be honest, considering her age, now the jewel of high society is\u2026 jeez!\u201dSophie quickly fell silent when the door opened.It was Miraila. Lawrence seemed to have finished eating.Miraila looked around the boudoir. And when she saw that Artizea was being combed, she said scornfully.\u201cYou don\u2019t intend to seduce men with that ugly face and that pitiful appearance. Do you?\u201dSophie said nothing and concentrated on what she was doing.Artizea spoke calmly.\u201cI\u2019m going to the temple. What would I do by seducing the priest, mother?\u201d\u201cThen why is she curling your hair? Like an old woman?\u201dArtizea looked at Miraila through the mirror.Miraila plopped down on a sofa in the boudoir .\u201cDidn\u2019t my brother say he was going out today?\u201d\u201cHe already left.\u201dMiraila sighed, lamenting.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

There was no other reason why Miraila could be in such a bad mood.Lawrence was already 22 years old.Even the most spoiled son, at this age, would like to be away from his mother and have more freedom.This is especially true for someone raised, like Lawrence, to be self-centered about everything.\u201cDid he say where he was going?\u201dAt this point, Sophie realized that Miraila\u2019s attention had turned to another subject, so she continued to do Artizea\u2019s hair.Miraila only sighed at Artizea\u2019s question.Artizea then consoled Miraila with her words, as she used to do.\u201cLawrence has many friends, and many things to do\u2026 so it can\u2019t be helped.\u201d\u201cYes. I know. Your brother is a wonderful man, so many people are behind him.\u201dMiraila lamented.\u201cI hope he\u2019s not captivated by some bitch.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry. My brother is a intelligent man.\u201d\u201cBut the problem with women is different. No matter how great a man is, if a woman decides to seduce him, he will eventually succumb to her. Because sexual desire is a male instinct.\u201dMiraila used to say that all the time. Artizea always wondered if that was wisdom or prejudice based on her own experience.Anyway, Artizea already knew what she had to answer. Miraila wanted to hear something that was comforting to her.\u201cHow could my brother do that? Mother has raised my brother with great dedication. He is not that kind of person.\u201dWhen Artizea was much younger, she used to pay attention to Miraila\u2019s words. But now, she knew that Miraila only cared about her own interests.Miraila nodded at her words.\u201cThat\u2019s right, your brother is different from other men. Still, I am worried about him. After all, when a man falls in love with a woman, he forgets about his mother. You won\u2019t, will you?\u201d\u201cOf course not, Mother. I\u2019ll always be by your side.\u201dArtizea said politely and Miraila smiled with satisfaction.\u201cThat\u2019s obvious. You\u2019re my daughter.\u201dWhile they were talking about it, Sophie finished curling all of Artizea\u2019s hair.Sophie had a good technique for making hairstyles, but she exaggerated and her curls were too short.Miraila seemed satisfied with the hairstyle.\u201cHave a nice day. Remember to donate some money and try to freshen up. You should always pay attention to the temple.\u201d\u201cYes, mother.\u201dArtizea responded obediently.When Artizea was 15 she had the idea of creating an information network, so she suggested donating to the temples and distributing money to the priests. Also, buy maids and servants from the imperial palace.Miraila had tried several times to do similar things before.However, she failed on every occasion, because compared to the large amount of money she spent, she did not have very good results.In the end, she succeeded after putting Artizea\u2019s words into practice.Even so, Miraila acted as if she had planned everything herself and that Artizea was only the errand person.However, Artizea was not upset. In a month at most, everything would change.She didn\u2019t want to argue or be beaten up over such a trivial matter, so she acted as before, as if she knew nothing.\u201cMy lady, are you all right?\u201dOnce Miraila left, Sophie asked her with concern. Artizea nodded her head.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing new, is it?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026 but still\u2026\u201d\u201cPut my dress on.\u201d\u201cOh, yes.\u201dSophie hurried.Artizea wasn\u2019t wearing a corset.As a child, Miraila would force her to wear a little corset to make her look a little better.However, when Artizea\u2019s body began to look like a grown woman\u2019s, she prevented her from wearing any tight clothing, saying it would make the men think dirty thoughts.Sophie put a bustle on her and dressed her in a dark green striped dress.Finally, Sophie sat her down on a chair and put her hands in Artizea\u2019s hair.Then, while massaging her scalp, she extended the curls she had previously curled for a perfect hairstyle.The curls were extended to the right level.Artizea\u2019s hair had a nice color, so she looked beautiful with her hairstyle.Artizea looked awkwardly in the mirror and fiddled with the tips of her hair.\u201cWhat do you think? You do not have to worry, by the time you return you will have your hair down. In any case, just spraying water can remove it.\u201dSophie said cheerfully. Artizea didn\u2019t know how to react.She had never paid attention to her appearance.However, it was the first time that a maid had broken the dress code, with the intention of making her look pretty.When she was satisfied, she would give a silver coin to the maids as a token of her appreciation for their work.\u2018Is it okay that I look pretty in the first place?\u2019Artizea had always had an obsessive anxiety about whether it was right for her to do something for herself.\u2018I have to get away from my mother as soon as possible.\u2019She made a firm decision.\u201cYou do not like?\u201dSophie asked with an anxious look. Artizea shook her head, opened the dresser drawer, took out a silver coin and gave it to Sophie.\u201cOn the contrary, you did a good job today.\u201d\u201cWow! Thank you very much!\u201dSophie accepted the silver coin with both hands and bowed her head.At that moment, you could hear the sound of the door opening.Alice came in after finishing what Artizea had ordered, and was surprised to see Artizea.\u201cMy lady, you are very beautiful today!\u201dSophie secretly made the V sign behind Artizea.Artizea noticed and fixed her gaze on Sophie. Sophie hummed and shrugged her shoulders.Alice, who was livelier than Sophie, said cheerfully.\u201cYou look really pretty! It would be great if you always looked like this.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re good with words. You won\u2019t get anything out of flattery. Did you do everything I asked?\u201d\u201cYes, I also packed the lunch boxes properly and put them in the carriage.\u201d\u201cGood job.\u201dArtizea also gave Alice a silver coin.Sophie finally gave her a little hat decorated with a couple of flowers.Artizea took her beige umbrella that had a green line on the end to match the dress and went out with Alice.The change of the future had just begun.***At that time, Grand Duke Cedric was in a barracks outside the capital.Cedric was the emperor\u2019s nephew. His mother was the Emperor\u2019s sister.Shortly after the death of the previous emperor and the ascension of the current emperor to the throne, Cedric\u2019s parents were falsely accused of being conspirators and were killed.At that time, almost the entire imperial family died, except for the children of the current emperor.However, Cedric, who was a baby, and Roygar, who was 12 years old, survived the political purge.The emperor had three children with the Empress, besides Lawrence with Miraila.However, all of them died before their 10th birthday due to some illness or accident.It was rumored that the emperor was cursed for killing a close relative.There were even rumors that the ghost of the late Empress Dowager haunted the graves of the innocent Grand Duke and Grand Duchess Evron, shedding tears of blood.The emperor caught and executed all the people who spread such rumors.But his violent personality decreased as he aged. Moreover, the successive deaths of his children also left a strong impression on him.The emperor eventually restored the Evron Family to its original position.Cedric was disappointed with the power. So, although his family was reinstated, he remained silent protecting the Grand Duchy Evron without thinking of entering the political arena.But when Cedric\u2019s reputation rose, the emperor summoned him by force from the north, and put the Imperial Western Army under his command to restore order to the western region, which was plagued by monsters.In the west, there were waves of monsters.This meant that the monsters, which had gradually increased in number over the years, were attacking the habitat of the humans.When the situation became grave, more than half of the western plains were devastated by the monster attacks and food was as scarce as in times of famine, and even rumors were spread about the practice of cannibalism. Human trafficking was also common.Ordinary people lost their homes and wandered around. Industries, including agriculture, were destroyed.However, the Crates Empire, which had lost its foundations, could not even intervene in the western region.Cedric had to start with rebuilding the Western Army.Then, after a long expedition, they conquered a large area outside the borders and established a fort.For a while, they would not have to fight the growing population of monsters. It was a great victory.However, the emperor had not yet given the approval for the ceremony of the triumphant return.For that reason, Cedric stayed for two months in some barracks outside the city.\u201cNow is not the time to be stubborn.\u201dHis lieutenant, Freyl, lamented.\u201cLet\u2019s dissolve. The ceremony is not important. It is enough for you, Your Grace, to enter first, bow to the Emperor and say, \u2018The army is well, all has been made possible by His Majesty.\u2019\u201d\u201cFreyl.\u201d\u201cThen His Majesty will thank us for the hard work, offer us some benefits and a feast. That\u2019s what everybody does, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cThese soldiers who have suffered for over a year without replenishing their troops and without supplies deserve to receive such an honor.\u201dCedric said firmly.It would not be difficult for him to enter and bow to the Emperor.But it would not be right.\u201cThere\u2019s no need for a grand ceremony, but we have to enter the capital officially. Rewards for battle merit cannot be based on money alone.\u201dCedric seemed serious.\u201cAnd we cannot dissolve, Freyl. Although we achieved a great victory, after a few years, the same thing will happen again. What do you think will happen?\u201cIn that case, His Majesty will have to act quietly and meet with the Grand Duke Evron.\u201d\u201cIf the West collapses, the whole empire will be in danger.\u201dHowever, Cedric couldn\u2019t help but sigh slightly.\u201cI know what you\u2019re talking about, Freyl. We can\u2019t stay like this forever.\u201d\u201cSo, what are you going to do?\u201d\u201cI thought I\u2019d ask the Archbishop to intercede as a mediator.\u201dFreyl showed a doubtful expression.The emperor was not on good terms with the temple.\u201cWell, will that work?\u201d\u201cI have to try. Anyway, I was planning to go to the temple because I had a disturbing dream.\u201d\u201cA dream?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dCedric nodded.In his dream a woman appeared who he had never seen before.It was a woman with platinum-blond hair, she was crying incessantly without saying a word, so much so that her face was soaked with tears.In a way, this could even be considered a nightmare.But instead of feeling fear, for some reason he felt sorry for her. He felt desperate and suffocated, as if his chest was being squeezed.It was a dream that left a bitter taste in him in many ways.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 7": "Chapter 7 - First Meeting (3)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 7 \u2013 First Meeting (3)Translator: GoldThe temple where the Archbishop was located was on the outskirts of the capital, at a considerable distance from it.This was partly due to the doctrine that advocated the need to distance oneself from the secular world, and partly for practical reasons to try to establish a certain distance from the Emperor\u2019s sphere of influence.In the capital there were several small temples that were frequented by commoners. However, when the nobles had time they would visit this temple, which also had beautiful and picturesque landscapes.Even the Imperial Family had to come here for some important sacraments.This was also one of the ways to confirm the authority of the temple.Cedric went into the forest with several knights under his command to go to the temple.A carriage was at a strange angle in the middle of the road.\u201cWoah!\u201dFreyl, who was in the lead, tugged on his horse\u2019s reins to stop. Cedric also stopped after him.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201dFreyl asked. The coachman took off his hat and bowed his head in shame.\u201cForgive me, knights. The wheel of our carriage has come off.\u201d\u201cThe wheel came off?\u201dFreyl looked at Cedric and when he nodded, Freyl got off his horse.They were riding horses, so they could perfectly well stray from the path and pass by.But neither Cedric nor the knights were that kind of person. Nor did they have a reason to hurry.Cedric watched the situation for a moment.The bracket connecting the axle to the wheel had come loose for some reason, causing the wheel to come off.\u201cThis is unusual. How were you handling the carriage?\u201dFreyl chided the coachman vigorously. The nervous coachman wiped his forehead with his hand.\u201cI was driving carefully, I don\u2019t know how it happened.\u201d\u201cCan you fix it?\u201dCedric got off his horse and went over to Freyl.\u201cIt\u2019s not that hard. You just need to mount the wheel and put the bracket back. That takes a bit of strength, but it looks like the people inside the carriage were women, so they couldn\u2019t fix it.\u201dFreyl reported and Cedric nodded his head.A girl standing in the shade of a tree a short distance away approached him with her maid. She seemed to be the owner of the carriage.\u201cThank you for your help.\u201d\u201cYou are welcome.\u201dCedric responded and turned to look at her. In that instant, he was stunned.She had the same face he had seen in his dream.She was younger, much prettier, but certainly still the same woman.The girl said quietly.\u201cI was worried about having to walk from this place to the temple.\u201d\u201cHow could a beautiful lady walk from here to the temple? Don\u2019t worry. We\u2019ll fix it right away.\u201dFreyl intervened, beating his chest.Cedric looked down on him, this is not something he could guarantee. It was a bad habit of Freyl to show off in front of pretty women.The girl smiled softly. It seemed like a bitter smile and at the same time it seemed that she was trying to contain her laughter.A crying face was superimposed.Cedric looked away from her face, feeling disconcerted. The carriage was quickly repaired.The girl thanked the knights one by one, and said.\u201cI\u2019m sorry to have disturbed you.\u201d\u201cYou do not have to apologize. It is our duty to help those who need it. You are a beautiful lady, it is dangerous for you to go out without an escort.\u201dAgain, Freyl spoke in Cedric\u2019s place. The girl answered.\u201cIt\u2019s just a midday trip to the temple. We\u2019re in the middle of the road so it\u2019s not convenient now, but when we get to the temple I\u2019ll thank you properly.\u201d\u201cNo, you do not have to.\u201dFreyl responded, but Cedric nodded in agreement.Then he opened the carriage door himself, Artizea seemed embarrassed.\u201cPlease get on.\u201dHe spoke briefly and extended his hand.Artizea hesitated and her cheeks turned red, but she finally took his hand and got into the carriage.Cedric\u2019s party on horseback split in two.Some were a little ahead of the carriage and others a little behind it.Artizea realized that it was because they intended to serve as escorts.When the doors of the temple were in sight, Cedric\u2019s party accelerated and moved away. They were not going directly to the temple, but planned to visit the personal residence of the Archbishop.Once Artizea\u2019s carriage stopped at the main entrance of the temple, the priest ran out to receive her.\u201cWelcome, Lady Rosan.\u201d\u201cThank you for coming to receive me despite my unexpected visit.\u201dArtizea ordered Alice to take out a small box she had brought.\u201cI have brought scented wax candles. I would like to offer them to the statue of the Son of God.\u201d\u201cFollow me, please. I\u2019m sure the Son of God will be very pleased by your great devotion, Lady Rosan.\u201dThe priest was delighted. The scented candles inside were negligible, but the box was a valuable item with a ruby inlay in the center, after being molded in gold and covered with satin.This was much better than making a direct donation.Although the temple had been secularized a long time ago, they still wanted to pretend to be poor and honest.Artizea slowly followed the priest with the box.The priest did not take it to the main hall, but to a small chapel with the statue of the Son of God.Artizea approached the statue and knelt down respectfully.She opened the box and took out three candles. Then she placed them in front of the statue of the Son of God, lit them, and put her hands together.As a child, she prayed a lot, but she never prayed sincerely to God again since she turned 16.But now she wanted to do it with all her heart.\u2018I used magic and sacrificed my body for it, but please forgive me. Though he is serving the foolish and the wicked, Grand Duke Evron, he is a just man, please take care of him. Finally, protect your Saintess daughter, Licia.\u2019For every candle, she made a petition.When she stood up after a short prayer, the priest asked her politely.\u201cWould you like to see the Archbishop?\u201d\u201cNo. I\u2019ll just have tea and rest before I go back.\u201d\u201cThen I prepared the gazebo for you.\u201d\u201cAnd one more thing, please.\u201dArtizea winked at Alice.Alice quickly took a silver coin out of her pocket and gave it to the priest. The priest grabbed the coin casually and tucked it into his sleeve.\u201cSome knights helped us to repair the wheel of our carriage on our way to the temple. I\u2019d like to thank them properly, so would you please guide my maid to them?\u201d\u201cIf it was knights, it must have been the party under His Grace, the Grand Duke Evron.\u201dThe priest called a server and asked him to lead Alice.Then he himself led Artizea to the gazebo.Artizea followed the priest slowly through the temple.Because the temple was located in a beautiful place, many of the people who came also took advantage of it to rest.In addition, some noble ladies who were deeply religious lived nearby and came to the temple daily.For this reason, several gazebos were built on the extensive grounds of the temple, so that visitors could enjoy the beautiful natural scenery without interruption from others.Artizea waited a while alone, sitting in the gazebo where the priest had guided her. The stream that flowed by the side of the gazebo produced a harmonious sound.It was about half an hour before Alice returned with the server.The server was holding a tea kettle of hot water and a wicker hamper, while Alice was holding a box of tea set.\u201cMy lady, I handed out the lunch boxes as you instructed. They liked it.\u201d\u201cWell done.\u201dThe food served at the temple does not include meat products. So, it wouldn\u2019t be enough for the knights.Artizea had planned this from the beginning, so she had packed a lot of food.\u201cI also invited the Grand Duke as you ordered. My lady, you should also eat something.\u201dWhile Alice was talking, she opened the tea set box she had brought and took out the things that were in the wicker hamper.Artizea didn\u2019t have much of an appetite. But she had to set the table because she had invited him.Alice put some plates on the table, with small slices of sandwiches, scones and jams.Meanwhile, Artizea prepared the tea herself. A refreshing citrus scent drifted through the air.When Artizea poured the tea into her teacup, Cedric finally reached her gazebo.Artizea got up from her seat. Her heart was pounding, she had never felt this way before.She was not sure if it was due to tension.\u201cI greet you again, Your Grace, Grand Duke Evron. I am Artizea Rosan.\u201dShe bowed her head respectfully. Cedric added a few words to confirm what she had just said.\u201cThe Marchioness Rosan\u2026\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019m her daughter.\u201d\u201cIf you knew I was the Grand Duke Evron, and planned all this to establish a connection with me, you should also know that the Marchioness Rosan is not to my liking. Is that not so?\u201d\u201cYou realized that.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not that stupid. How could the wheel of a perfectly good carriage have fallen off like that?\u201dCedric continued.\u201cYou even had lunch boxes prepared, as if you\u2019d planned it all from the start.\u201dArtizea was a little embarrassed.\u201cThere\u2019s something I need to tell you. If I hadn\u2019t made that little connection, you would have turned around as soon as you knew I was Miraila Rosan\u2019s daughter.\u201dCedric looked at her silently.In spite of everything, he wouldn\u2019t have given it much importance, if it hadn\u2019t been for the terrible dream he had last night.Artizea looked him straight in the eye.Cedric thought her turquoise eyes were like precious stones.Unlike the sad look he had seen in the dream, her eyes shone warmly.So he sat down.\u201cI hope what you have to say to me is valuable and you\u2019re not wasting my time.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dArtizea bowed her head again respectfully.As Artizea poured the hot tea into his teacup, Cedric hesitated for a moment. He didn\u2019t really feel comfortable. He knew that Artizea was trying to do something, even though he thought that in the worst case, it was a bad joke, he also could not ignore that she was the daughter of the Marchioness Rosan.Nevertheless, he decided to at least drink his cup of tea. He could get up and leave at any time.\u201cPlease propose to me.\u201d\u201cC-Cough!\u201dHe choked on the hot tea.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 8": "Chapter 8 - First Meeting (4)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 8 \u2013 First Meeting (4)Translator: GoldCedric covered his mouth with his hand and coughed for a while, wincing. He had burned the inside of his mouth with the hot tea.\u201cOh my goodness. I never thought I would hear that from a young lady I just met today.\u201dArtizea offered him a handkerchief with a blushing face.Cedric took it, and wiped his mouth and hands.Artizea wasn\u2019t talking about a real marriage proposal.Even if she had changed, Cedric didn\u2019t know it.So she thought that by telling him about the proposal, he would take it as a scheme. She never imagined that he would misinterpret it as a real marriage between a man and a woman.Artizea admitted that she herself had made a mistake. At this moment, Cedric was not only unaware that she had changed, but he didn\u2019t even know her. No wonder he misinterpreted her words.She spoke, pressing her blushed cheeks with her closed hands.\u201cI\u2019m not asking you to marry me for real. I say it as a way of solving the problems Your Grace has been struggling with.\u201d\u201cWhat problems are you talking about?\u201d\u201cYou haven\u2019t entered the capital for the last two months because of the ceremony of the triumphant return, have you? I know Your Grace is concerned that the soldiers will not be treated as they deserve, as this could lead to the collapse not only of the Western Army but also of the Southern Army.\u201dThe treatment of the local troops by the Imperial Family was not new.However, the discontent that had been building up in the army was slowly exploding, because they had not been recognized despite risking their lives to make contributions.The soldiers were beginning to desert from the Southern and Eastern Armies. In contrast, the Western Army had not had many problems under Cedric\u2019s leadership.\u201cThe longer Your Grace persists, the less willing His Majesty the Emperor will be to recognise the army\u2019s military merit. He hates losing to others and losing face more than anything else. Perhaps Your Grace is here to ask the Archbishop to act as mediator?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThe Emperor has an inferiority complex about the Archbishop. That is not a wise choice.\u201dArtizea continued.\u201cIf the Archbishop intercedes, even if he succeeds in having the ceremony of the triumphant return, there will be reprisals in the future. Not only is he likely to block any possibility of Your Grace becoming involved in the Western Army, but key Western Army personnel who are helping Your Grace could be expelled or purged. Still, you should be glad that there is only a delay in the replenishment of troops and supplies.\u201dArtizea said this because she knew perfectly well what had happened in the future.The Western Army became weaker and weaker. And seven years later, when the wave of monsters came, the western region of the country became a real hell.Because of the loss of the cereal fields other regions suffered from famine.Cedric\u2019s face darkened. He knew it too.But still, he could not bow and yield to the Emperor.It\u2019s not just supply that constitutes an army. If pride and military discipline disappeared, then the organisation he managed to rebuild would disintegrate.\u201cHis Majesty cares for my brother Lawrence. But at present my brother Lawrence has no military support. It is clear that this will become a great weakness in the future for him, when the fight for the throne begins. His Majesty is worried about this.\u201dShe continued to speak.\u201cThough of course, His Majesty has no intention of sharing his power.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d\u201cSo Your Grace is the right person. You are in the line of succession to the throne, you can strengthen my brother Lawrence\u2019s legitimacy, and also give him the military support he needs.\u201dArtizea took a sip of tea and said.\u201cIf Your Grace will leave open the possibility of supporting my brother Lawrence, His Majesty the Emperor would be willing to bestow the appropriate honours on the Western Army and organise a ceremony of the triumphant return to match the achievements made.\u201d\u201cI understand what you mean, lady. But it is impossible for that to happen. I will not collude with the Marchioness Rosan, that is completely out of the question. Much less marry her daughter.\u201dCedric said firmly.\u201cLady, the only reason I\u2019ve listened to you so far is because you seemed intelligent, but you\u2019re still young. Also, probably because you don\u2019t know me very well, when you listened to your mother and brother hatch that scheme, you thought it would be feasible.\u201d\u201cYour Grace.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not angry with you, lady. I hope you will excuse me for leaving in the middle of the conversation, but I do not share your ideas.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dArtizea grabbed him by the sleeve as he stood up.\u201cI\u2019m not done talking. And I\u2019m not asking you to actually support my brother Lawrence.\u201dCedric looked down at her. Artizea said quickly.\u201cBy showing His Majesty the Emperor the \u2018possibility\u2019, it is enough.\u201d\u201cLady.\u201d\u201cYour Grace may or may not support Lawrence, leaving this uncertain will allow the Western Army to receive the treatment it deserves. And yet you will throw it all away for personal reasons?\u201d\u201cI have no intention of begging for the recognition that soldiers deserve for their military merits.\u201d\u201cSo, what about the \u2018Village of the Rebels\u2019 in the Grand Duchy Evron?Cedric frowned and looked at Artizea with fierce eyes.\u201cAre you trying to blackmail me, lady?\u201d\u201cNo, I am offering my advice with all sincerity. The fact that I know this, means that others may find out too, Your Grace.\u201d\u201cI deduce that at least the Marchioness Rosan and Lawrence must know.\u201d\u201cMy mother and brother are not very good at such delicate work. You needn\u2019t worry. Right now, I\u2019m the only one who knows.\u201d\u201cThey are not guilty.\u201d\u201cI know, too. But this is a problem that could trigger a serious situation at any time.\u201dArtizea now knew he couldn\u2019t leave.This allowed her to relax and pour herself another cup of tea.\u2018I\u2019m thirsty.\u2019Cedric sat down again when she finished talking.Then he asked her in a low voice.\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d\u201cYour Grace should pursue a more practical benefit.\u201d\u201cIs that practical benefit in joining hands with the unjust to bring about the ceremony of the triumphant return of the Western Army?\u201d\u201cYour Grace, you must set aside your honor, so that you may gain the honor of the Western Army and protect the Grand Duchy Evron.\u201dArtizea said.\u201cNeither my mother nor my brother knows of this meeting. I did not damage the carriage so that Your Grace would think that our meeting had happened by accident. I did it to deceive the others.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIt is quite common that after an accidental encounter between a man and a woman they develop feelings for each other.\u201dArtizea spoke calmly.\u201cSo, announce that you will stop fighting the Emperor\u2019s will and enter the capital because you have fallen in love with me. Then propose to me. There won\u2019t be many people who will question it.\u201dShe was Miraila Rosan\u2019s daughter. People would misunderstand the whole situation.Except Miraila and Lawrence, who would know it wouldn\u2019t be a political marriage. Therefore, no marriage alliance would be established.After saying these words, Artizea straightened his back and looked directly at Cedric.\u201cOn the surface, it will seem that Your Grace has abandoned the honour of the Western Army for a woman. But in reality, His Majesty the Emperor will calculate the benefits that Lawrence could obtain when I marry Your Grace. And then, he will allow the ceremony of the triumphant return of the Western Army to take place.\u201dCedric was silent.\u201cBesides, you will also get the favor of the Grand Duke Roygar, Lawrence\u2019s greatest adversary. Your Grace can benefit from both sides.\u201dArtizea emptied the cold tea from his teacup, and poured out new tea.Then Cedric finally asked.\u201cI know that Lawrence will try to get me on his side. But the Grand Duke Roygar is Lawrence\u2019s adversary, what do you mean if I marry you, I\u2019ll get his favour?\u201d\u201cYou want to marry me because you fell madly in love, not to form a marriage alliance in support of Lawrence.\u201d\u201cSo far, Your Grace, the Grand Duke Evron, has been sensible and fair in all that you have done. But what will the Grand Duke Roygar think when he learns that you entered the capital not to bow to His Majesty the Emperor, but for a woman? Well, he may think you\u2019ve given up your pride to get something in return, so he\u2019ll try to persuade you to take his side.\u201cYou mean I can influence both sides.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dCedric was never a man without power of influence.The Grand Duchy Evron was the shield of the empire in the north.And Cedric was the man who had earned the most merit in the Empire.He also helped rebuild the Western Army and stopped the waves of monsters.There were also many people who admired him in the Central, Eastern and Southern Armies.At the same time, he cemented his reputation by not bowing down to anyone or forming a party faction. In the end, that made the Emperor end up hating him.He didn\u2019t have enough power to threaten the Emperor, but he had enough influence to make him feel uncomfortable.\u201cIf you marry me, the Emperor will not be as displeased with your presence as before.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat His Majesty the Emperor hates most is having his power ignored. And the struggles for succession are what affect that power the most. Consider why he does not support his son Lawrence unilaterally, but puts his brother, the Grand Duke Roygar, on the table as well.\u201d\u201cI see what you mean. His Majesty is a cautious man, and is deliberately weakening both sides by creating a factional struggle. Therefore, even if someone were to behead me, His Majesty would consider it a simple political dispute and treat it as a minor matter.\u201dCedric muttered to himself, deep in thought.\u201cIs this how she intends to protect me?\u201dArtizea quietly waited for him to finish thinking.She ran out of tea, so she called her maid to bring her more hot water.Cedric remained silent while Artizea poured the hot water into the teapot and turned the hourglass.\u201cLady, if it is not to force me to side with Lawrence through a marriage alliance, then what would you gain from this marriage?\u201dShe had no choice but to lie about this, Cedric had no reason to trust her yet.\u201cI just want to inherit the Marquisate Rosan completely and become independent.\u201d\u201cLady, you will inherit the Marquisate Rosan anyway.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t wait until then.\u201dWhat Artizea said wasn\u2019t entirely untrue.\u201cI\u2019m currently 18 years old. I can only inherit the title when I turn 20. My mother, who is my guardian, has until the next two years the authority to dispose of the estate of the Marquisate Rosan as my guardian.\u201dDespite the fact that the Marquisate Rosan had completely lost his political influence, it still had a large fortune.The power that Lawrence could exercise just for these reasons was enormous.And there wasn\u2019t much Artizea could do while she was under Miraila\u2019s control.For now, her first priority was to distance herself completely from her.\u201cBut you can marry with your guardian\u2019s permission. And after you marry, you will be recognized as an adult.\u201d\u201cYes, but just because I choose someone, doesn\u2019t mean my mother will let me go. Even when I become an adult it will be the same. Mother would find a way to kill my future husband before letting me marry him.\u201dArtizea said calmly.\u201cIn that sense, Your Grace, the Grand Duke, is the best candidate I can choose. I am sure His Majesty will be pleased with Your Grace\u2019s proposal of marriage, and my brother Lawrence will not refuse it.\u201d\u201cAre you thinking of betraying your mother and brother?\u201d\u201cI am only a tool. If a tool falls into the hands of another person it cannot be considered treason.\u201dArtizea said bitterly.That didn\u2019t mean she didn\u2019t consider others to be tools.In that sense, maybe she was too much like Miraila.\u201cPlease remain formally married to me for only two years and protect me, Your Grace. If you do, then I will make Your Grace the Emperor.\u201dCedric\u2019s eyes grew larger at her unexpected words.\u201cYou must do it. If you want the people of the Crates Empire to live in peace. Lawrence is cruel and Roygar is greedy. If either of them ascend to the throne, the Empire will be a living hell.\u201dArtizea said firmly.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

His Majesty has not yet chosen the Crown Prince.\u201dArtizea said calmly.\u201cIf the Grand Duke Roygar is entitled to the succession to the throne, Your Grace is also entitled. Your mother was the Grand Duke Roygar\u2019s elder sister, a legitimate princess of the empire, and Your Grace is the late emperor\u2019s grandson, born of a legitimate marriage.\u201d*Thud.*Cedric punched the table and rose abruptly from his seat. \u201cI can\u2019t listen to you talk about this anymore.\u201d\u201cYour Grace.\u201dHe turned and left quickly.Alice, who was watching them from afar, ran up to Artizea in surprise.\u201cMy lady, are you all right?\u201d\u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 He left angrily.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what I expected.\u201dArtizea quietly poured more tea into her cup of tea and drank it. On the contrary, she would have been disappointed if he hadn\u2019t shown his rejection.The position of the Crown Prince was not something that could be discussed lightly. And much less about an alleged \u2018conspiracy\u2019.Even just by mentioning this, even if he had a right to succession, could cause him to be treated as a conspirator.Cedric knew that better than anyone. Because his parents were framed and killed for conspiracy.Besides, Artizea was Lawrence\u2019s half-sister. Rather, it would have been odd if he didn\u2019t doubt her intentions.\u2018He\u2019ll need time to think about it.\u2019Cedric\u2019s previous foray into politics came after the fall of Roygar and after Lawrence became the Crown Prince.However, while Roygar was in the fight for the throne, he always stayed away from these matters.The illegitimate son of the emperor or the legitimate son of the emperor\u2019s sister? Favouritism or bloodlines?That fact alone had caused the confrontation to intensify, but no one had considered the emperor\u2019s nephew as his successor.Cedric had never shown the ambition of the Grand Duke Roygar.Everyone thought he hated politics and power, and that he only wanted to protect the Grand Duchy Evron.Even when he began to confront Lawrence. He did it to survive, not out of any interest in political power.But had Cedric himself once thought about it?Artizea thought not. No, she was sure he hadn\u2019t.She had been watching Cedric for almost 20 years. Artizea had been cautious about him even before he stood out.She couldn\u2019t say that she understood him, nor that she sympathized with him.But she knew him better than anyone else.He was a man of strong convictions. When someone has to step forward to face adverse situations, he is the first to take that step.\u2018Making a decision before the scales tip could be a much better start.\u2019Pushing Cedric\u2019s back wouldn\u2019t be a difficult task.Even bringing up one of the tragedies that the power struggle between the two would cause, Cedric would feel responsible.Until now, he had probably ignored the issue, vaguely thinking that Lawrence or Roygar could do it right.However, when he discovered that this would not be the case, he would feel the need to confront them.But Artizea decided not to do that.She considered Cedric her master.Therefore, a close aide should strive to fulfill the will of her master. It was out of the question to conspire to influence her master\u2019s actions and thoughts.Of course, she had to become his aide first.The first decision had to be made by Cedric.Time was a valuable resource, but the worrying process of thought and resolution was also important.And if after that worrying process he came to the conclusion that Artizea was not necessary, then she would do something else.\u201cMy lady, eat something. The only thing you ate today when you woke up was a small portion of salad.\u201d\u201cAh. I\u2019m sorry, I forgot.\u201dArtizea finally took a small slice of sandwich and put it in her mouth.Then she offered Alice. Anyway, there were so many that she couldn\u2019t eat them all by herself.\u201cMy lady, will you come home now?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s wait a little longer.\u201d\u201cWhy? The Grand Duke Evron has already left.\u201d\u201cWell, let\u2019s just wait. We\u2019re in no hurry to get home early anyway.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201dAlice sighed.However, there was no need to wait any longer.\u2026After an hour, one of the knights who helped her repair the carriage arrived at the gazebo.\u201cI am Benjamin Corner of the Western Army.\u201dThe knight introduced himself with a military salute.\u201cI have come by order of His Grace, the Grand Duke Evron, to escort you, lady, to the home of the Marquisate Rosan.\u201dEarlier, he had shown himself to be angry with her, but now he was sending this man to escort her, leaving one possibility open.If he was really angry with Artizea because he considered her words unacceptable, he would not have sent anyone to escort her.Now she was looking forward to their next meeting.\u201cThank you for your kindness. I would also like you to convey my thanks separately to His Grace.\u201dArtizea said politely. Alice quickly put everything in the wicker hamper and the tea set box respectively.Benjamin helped her carry the heavy box of the tea set.Artizea followed them, walking slowly along the beautiful temple path, carrying her umbrella.***When she was on her way back to the Marquisate Rosan, the sun was setting.When the manor could be seen in the distance, the way was blocked. The Imperial Guard was on alert and they raised their hands as the carriage approached.The coachman was used to this, so he stopped the carriage calmly.Benjamin knocked hastily at the door of the carriage. Artizea opened the curtain on the carriage window and looked out.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cAh, sorry for bothering you. There seems to be an inspection. I\u2019ll find out what\u2019s going on and\u2026 \u201dIt was then that one of the Knights of the Imperial Guard approached him and asked.\u201cIsn\u2019t that the Western Army uniform? What\u2019s a Western Army knight doing here?\u201d\u201cAh! I am Benjamin Corner, Knight of the Fourth Western Army Corps! I am escorting the lady home on the orders of His Grace, the Grand Duke Evron.\u201dBenjamin responded with a tense voice. One might think that the Knights of the Western Army, the Knights of the Central Army and the Knights of the Imperial Guard possessed the same status, but in reality, there were notable differences between them.In particular, the Knights of the Imperial Guard not only had access to the Imperial Palace, but could also meet with the Emperor at any time and wield a weapon near him. They were treated similarly to an Earl.The Emperor was no fool. He did not select the knights who guarded him by status or lineage, but chose them personally from among the elite Knights of the Central Army.Even ordinary people could become knights just by military achievement.In an empire constantly threatened by monsters and pirates, the way was open for those with the necessary abilities.In fact, the Imperial Guard was also the highest position to which an ordinary person could rise.The Knight of the Imperial Guard asked in surprise.\u201cHis Grace the Grand Duke Evron?\u201dWhen Artizea heard the voice, she opened the carriage door.Then the Knight of the Imperial Guard approached the carriage.This middle-aged man named Henry Kishore was one of the Six Commanders of the Imperial Guard. And also, he was one of the Emperor\u2019s trusted men. There was nothing wrong with being close to him.\u201cHello, Sir Kishore.\u201d\u201cWhere are you coming from so late? Lady Artizea.\u201dKishore asked with a stern expression.\u201cI was returning from the temple, but I had a mishap.\u201dHe had been a close aide to the Emperor since the time of Artizea\u2019s birth. And he often went to the Marquisate Rosan to visit Miraila on the Emperor\u2019s orders.So sometimes he acted as a protective uncle to Artizea.\u201cI see. But why are you with a soldier of the Western Army\u2026?\u201d\u201cThe Grand Duke Evron helped me repair the carriage when I was stranded on the road. He was surprised I was without an escort, so he asked Sir Connor to accompany me home.\u201dArtizea deliberately blushed.The Emperor trusted Kishore because he was an honest and selfless man.He was also a non-partisan figure loyal to the Emperor and unconnected to the noble families.Mielle was a year younger than Artizea. For that reason, Kishore was kind to Artizea.He was the perfect person to make her meeting with Cedric today come to the Emperor\u2019s ears in a natural and favorable tone.This meeting with Kishore was not planned by her. But Artizea thought it was the best thing that could have happened.\u201cYou\u2019ve grown up, you are no longer a child, you\u2019ve become a woman, Artizea.\u201dHe said that with a warm smile on his face.Artizea blushed again, but this time she wasn\u2019t acting. Even her ears turned red and her body temperature rose.\u201cOh, this is no time to talk about this. I\u2019ll escort you home.\u201d\u201cWell, then I\u2019ll leave now.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve escorted me here. If you like, you can come with us and have a teacup before you go.\u201d\u201cNo. The Grand Duke gave me the order to escort you home safely. But from now on, the safest thing is for the Knight of the Imperial Guard to escort you. I have already done my duty, so I will return.\u201d\u201cAll right, thank you.\u201dArtizea said with a smile. Kishore tapped him on the shoulder and said, \u201cGood job.\u201dBenjamin stiffened, he said goodbye to Kishore with a military salute, and left quickly as if he were running away.Artizea laughed internally. Although Benjamin was respectful and courteous, he must have felt quite nervous. After all, he was a young Knight of the Western Army, who had met a Commander of the Imperial Guard.Kishore closed the door of the carriage and Artizea said out the window.\u201cAh, today I received a prayer candle after praying to the statue of the Son of God in the temple. It is blessed and I would like to give it to Miss Mielle.\u201d\u201cThank you for your consideration.\u201dKishore said it with sincerity.\u201cI hope someday, when Miss Mielle\u2019s health improves, we can go on a picnic.\u201d\u201cMielle will be glad when I tell her.\u201d\u201cSir Kishore, you will come with us, too.\u201dArtizea spoke with a smile, and Kishore covered his face with his palms.\u201cThat child, she\u2019s been bothering me lately\u2026\u201dShe was a 17-year-old girl, so no wonder. Whether she liked her father or not, she would not want to be with him all her life.Artizea laughed.\u201cI\u2019m sure that\u2019s not her intention. By the way, if you\u2019re here, that means His Majesty the Emperor is also in the Marquisate Rosan, right?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dArtizea took a deep breath.She couldn\u2019t remember all the details of the events that were to occur. However, she remembered the date of the Emperor\u2019s first visit, after she had turned 18.Because \u2018something\u2019 happened that day that allowed Artizea to realize how she could help Lawrence.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

And if someone is from the Imperial Family, there will be dozens of people following him from room to room to serve him. The number of people who clean, tidy the rooms, prepare and carry the food is countless.\u300d\u300cIt is true.\u300d\u300cBut most of the employees who work for these nobles are not even recognized as human beings. For that reason, they can obtain a lot of valuable information by acting as spies.\u300d\u300cWell, I understand what you mean, but if they have valuable information, don\u2019t they usually sell it? Isn\u2019t it better to pay them at that time?\u300dAlice said, bowing her head.A lot of employees knew they could make money selling information.So they used to remember everything that the people they served talked about and did, to sell that information when the time was right or to achieve their own ambitions.\u300cIf I do this regularly, won\u2019t they come talk to me first when I have valuable information?\u300d\u300cAh, you are buying priority.\u300d\u300cEspecially trust, they will think that I am willing to buy any valuable information and also that I have the ability to pay no matter what it costs. It must be shown that regularly.\u300dArtizea also bribed those in unimportant positions.She could not buy their hearts by spending money only when it suited her.\u300cYou should know this. If you give money without asking for any favors, they will feel indebted. This is very important. When you give money and ask for something in return, the relationship will end immediately. But when you don\u2019t ask for anything in return, the relationship will never end. They will always think they have to do something for you.\u300dThis applied not only to the poor, but also to those in better positions.With the gold coins that Artizea gave them, they could live quietly for months and educate their children.So, naturally, they were grateful.If she had had an inferior status, the recipients of the money would have seen it as a bribe and ignored it.But she was the real Marchioness Rosan.The money she gave was a bribe for the future, but the recipients did not feel that they were being bought, but that they were being favored by their superior.And for them, loyalty was the way to pay for their superior\u2019s grace.\u300cTalk to them every time you hand over the money. They should know that I am willing to buy any information, even some that they did not sell because they thought it was not valuable. As my overall reputation rises and I gain their trust, people who have never been given money before will come to sell their information.\u300dAlthough Artizea might have an idea of the overall picture, it was important to be able to get a lot of information.On the other hand, the quality of the information did not depend on the length of the message, but on whether it came from a reliable source.Knowing that Artizea had prepared gift pouches for this reason, Alice spoke anxiously.\u201cIt\u2019s almost half of the budget you can spend this year.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s all right.\u201dAnyway, if she married Cedric, the wealth of the Marquisate Rosan would be in her hands. At that time, she would no longer have to worry about money.Alice did not used to be insistent, so she did not ask again. She bowed her head politely as a sign of understanding, and hurried to Artizea\u2019s room.After Alice left, Artizea went to Miraila\u2019s boudoir.She was going to greet the emperor.Miraila did not like it when she appeared before the Emperor.But now she had no reason to be considerate of Miraila. She couldn\u2019t miss the opportunity to make a strong impression on the Emperor.The knights of the Imperial Guard and the servants bowed to her in silence. Artizea also bowed and told the servant at the door.\u201cPlease let His Majesty the Emperor know that Miraila\u2019s daughter, Artizea, wishes to greet him.\u201dThen she took a small silk pouch from her pocket and gave it to the servant.It was the same as the pouches she had ordered Alice to hand out. Artizea always had some pouches on her for anything.The servant, who had received several of these pouches in the past, nodded with a friendly smile. Then he opened the door and went in.From outside, one could hear voices mixed with Miraila\u2019s laughter.The cheerful conversation seemed to stop for a moment, and then the door opened wide.\u201cCome in, Lady Artizea.\u201d\u201cThank you. By the way, if any visitors come while I\u2019m inside, could you let me know first? I would like to take care of it so that it does not interfere with the time that His Majesty and my mother spend together. \u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dArtizea entered with cautious steps.The emperor was sitting comfortably on the sofa.Miraila was dressed only in a petticoat. The maids were to one side, arranging the dress she was to put on.Emperor Gregor was a cold, selfish man.He was more interested in securing his own power than in ruling the country. He was suspicious, vile and greedy.However, his love for Miraila was the only thing that was genuine.He was involved with countless women, but Miraila was the only one he kept by his side for 25 years.Although Miraila had given birth to another man\u2019s daughter, they were only separated by a year at most.He was kind to Artizea because she was Miraila\u2019s daughter.But she never knew what true love was. There was a time when she was curious about love. But now she didn\u2019t care.The important thing was that he loved Miraila and would never leave her.Artizea knelt down on one knee and bowed to the Emperor.\u201cMay the sun of the empire descend upon its citizens. Artizea, the daughter of Miraila, greets Your Majesty the Emperor. Long live the Emperor.\u201d\u201cIt has been a long time since I last saw you. You have grown up in the blink of an eye.\u201dSaid the Emperor.He smiled like a snake and looked at Artizea from top to bottom. It was a critical look.\u201cIf you looked like your mother, you would be much more beautiful.\u201d\u201cI know I\u2019m beautiful.\u201dSaid Miraila. Then, she walked up with soft steps and sat on the Emperor\u2019s thigh, grumbling.\u201cWhat can I do? Even her face is ugly, but she\u2019s my daughter, so I have to live with her.\u201d\u201cWhy? Although Tia doesn\u2019t look like you, she has the features of a beautiful woman. If she gains a little weight and her body matures more, she\u2019ll look pretty in no time.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s already grown up and remains the same. If you say those things, she might actually believe it, honey.\u201dSpeaking lovingly, Miraila caressed his cheek. The Emperor smiled.\u201cI meant it. Did you think it was a joke too, Tia?\u201dArtizea looked down politely.When Artizea was a child, Miraila hated her and beat her because she didn\u2019t look like her.\u300c\u201dIf you were at least a little like me, wouldn\u2019t His Majesty the Emperor have treated you like his own daughter?\u201d\u300dArtizea truly believed in her words and cried. Even some nights, she dreamed that she had also been born as the Emperor\u2019s daughter, and that she received the love of her parents, just like Lawrence.But now that she thought about it again, that was foolish.If she had resembled Miraila, she would no doubt have been dragged into the Emperor\u2019s bedroom as soon as she turned sixteen.She had been fortunate enough to have a face that didn\u2019t look like her beautiful mother\u2019s.\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear it. Your Majesty loves my mother and thinks I\u2019m beautiful. What could make me feel more honoured?\u201d\u201cHow old are you?\u201d\u201cI recently turned 18 years old.\u201d\u201cYou have really grown up. I need to find a suitable husband for you.\u201d\u201cNo, she is just an 18 year old child. What kind of marriage would that be?\u201dMiraila said bluntly. The Emperor laughed, grabbed Miraila\u2019s wrist and kissed her hand lovingly.\u201cI know you want your daughter to be by your side forever, but she should be engaged before she turns 20.\u201d\u201cMm, but still\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll get her a suitable husband. She\u2019s not going to live with her brother forever, right?\u201dThe Emperor smiled.By suitable husband, he meant not a good marriage for Artizea, but a political marriage that would only help Lawrence.But Miraila did not understand and grunted with disapproval. Although she was upset, the Emperor still found her cute.Artizea bowed politely.Miraila rose angrily, to put on her dress.She had not put on the dress she had previously decided upon, because she wanted to show her figure to the Emperor.A beautiful green satin dress, with a sweetheart neckline on her chest and a straight neckline on her back.At that moment, the servant entered and said politely.\u201cA visitor has come to see you, Lady Artizea.\u201dArtizea said hastily.\u201cForgive me. I must leave.\u201dThe emperor gestured, giving her permission to leave, and Miraila glanced at her.Artizea turned around and left the boudoir. The servant followed her and said in a low voice.\u201cCountess Eunice is now in the foyer making a fuss. She wants to see His Majesty the Emperor.\u201d\u201cAll right, I\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d\u201cDid you know the Countess Eunice was coming?\u201d\u201cYes, I supposed to.\u201dArtizea hadn\u2019t gathered this information beforehand, she just remembered it.However, the servant didn\u2019t know, so he said with admiration.\u201cYou\u2019re amazing. Thank you very much.\u201d\u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d\u201cHis Majesty is in a very good mood for the first time in a long time. If the Countess had disturbed him, I\u2019m sure we would all have been harmed.\u201d\u201cIt is natural for me to welcome visitors. Besides, it is not yet known. If I don\u2019t manage to appease the Countess, she\u2019s sure to make a big fuss.\u201dHaving said that, Artizea headed for the foyer.The sound of Countess Eunice\u2019s screams reached the second floor.\u201cYou mean His Majesty won\u2019t even see me, his own daughter, because of that dirty bitch?\u201dThe butler was nervous and stooped.Artizea walked down the stairs at a snail\u2019s pace.\u201cHello, Countess Eunice. What brings you here\u2026\u201d*Slap*Suddenly, the Countess Eunice raised her hand and slapped Artizea hard on the cheek.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Even one of the knights guarding the foyer came running up in bewilderment.The Countess\u2019 maid turned pale and had no idea what to do.\u201cNothing happens.\u201dArtizea shook her head slowly. Her mouth was torn and bleeding, so she pulled out a handkerchief and wiped herself.Then she stared at Countess Eunice.The Countess Charlotte Eunice was one of the Emperor\u2019s two illegitimate daughters.Her mother was not a beloved lover like Miraila, but a maid who had been dragged into bed for a night.It was to keep the empress under control that he had a child with his maid, not because she was a beloved lover.That wasn\u2019t even a secret.The Emperor was not interested in Charlotte\u2019s mother. However, he loved his daughters like gold and jade.Countess Eunice had memories of being loved by the Emperor until she was about ten.Although she had no power or love now, her pride as the emperor\u2019s daughter was stronger than anything else.So she couldn\u2019t bear to be defeated by Miraila.At best, isn\u2019t she just his lover? She knew it was inevitable to lose to his son, Lawrence, but being his daughter, she couldn\u2019t bear to be behind his lover.That\u2019s why she hated his lover\u2019s daughter, Artizea, like an insect.From Artizea\u2019s point of view, both were born denied.However, the Emperor\u2019s blood that flowed through her veins seemed to make that not important to her.Countess Eunice looked down on Artizea. It was a look of superiority.\u201cCountess Eunice you have no idea what you have done.\u201d\u201cTell your mother to come here.\u201d\u201cWhat do you think will happen if I collapse here and start crying?\u201dArtizea said quietly.\u201cThe servants and knights of the Emperor\u2019s Imperial Guard saw how you suddenly slapped me on the cheek.\u201d\u201cMmm, so what?\u201d\u201cHis Majesty detests noisy people. Besides, what man would want his daughter to visit him during his secret meeting with his lover? You are no longer a five or six year old girl, on the contrary, you are already married and even have children.\u201dCountess Eunice\u2019s face turned pale. Artizea spoke coldly.\u201cIf I make a big fuss at this moment, crying out in humiliation and pain, I\u2019m sure His Majesty the Emperor will come. And my mother would not let this opportunity pass, so she would cry with me, and tell the Emperor that his daughter despises and insults us in this way. What do you think will happen then?\u201d\u201cHe, he\u2026\u201d\u201cThe more you try hard to deal with my mother, the more sympathy His Majesty the Emperor will have for her. Do you want to check?\u201dSaid Artizea and stepped forward.Countess Eunice felt so pressured by her overwhelming presence that she almost fell backwards. The maid rushed to hold her.Artizea pulled the hem of her dress. Then she said quietly.\u201cMy mother and my brother Lawrence are the only ones who would benefit from this. So go home today.\u201d\u201cWho do you think you are? If you\u2019re really so confident, why don\u2019t you try?\u201dCountess Eunice spoke with an air of dignity, but her voice trembled.Artizea smiled bitterly.She didn\u2019t have to try to find out. Because, in the past, she really had.She was used to being slapped by Miraila, so she didn\u2019t really find it painful. However, back then she acted as if it hurt, collapsed on the floor and cried. The astonished servants and knights approached her to help her.Miraila, who was resourceful in this, quickly realized Artizea\u2019s intentions and acted.With tears in her eyes, she complained to the Emperor that she and her daughter did not deserve to be treated this way.She then resigned herself to leaving her bedroom, and wept pitifully for almost ten days.The Emperor, broken by the tears of his beloved woman, rebuked Countess Eunice. He also gave Miraila a great consolation gift and organized a glamorous party for her.Miraila arrived at the party hugging proudly the Emperor\u2019s arm and became the star of the party.It was the first time that Artizea was recognized by Lawrence and Miraila as \u2018something useful\u2019.\u201cCountess Eunice, you should not compete with your father\u2019s beloved woman. You who are his beloved daughter, if you want to push my mother aside, you have to accept to be loved in a different way.\u201dCountess Eunice looked at her in puzzlement.She couldn\u2019t understand why Artizea said this as if she wanted to take his mother down.\u201cHis Majesty truly cared for you as his daughter, and there was a time when he loved you very much. Bring back those memories. Tomorrow go with your children to visit His Majesty. And be loved as a daughter. You shouldn\u2019t criticize his relationship with women, you\u2019ll only make His Majesty hate you. That does not benefit you in any way.\u201d\u201cWhat the hell are you saying\u2026?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll pretend nothing happened today. Now, go away. No father in the world wants his children to see him with his lover.\u201dArtizea said this and looked back at the knight of the Imperial Guard. The young knight became nervous at Artizea\u2019s gaze.Artizea smiled sweetly at him.\u201cCountess Eunice is going to retire, would you please escort her out?\u201d\u201cIs that all right with you?\u201dThe knight looked at her sadly. Artizea spoke.\u201cWe should not interrupt His Majesty\u2019s time of rest. Countess Eunice, please mark my words and go home. Don\u2019t forget what filial piety really is.\u201dCountess Eunice didn\u2019t seem to understand your words. However, when the knight urged her to leave, she did so obediently.Artizea released the hem of her dress.The love one person could feel for another had a limit. Even more so for an egocentric person like Emperor Gregor.Love for a woman is different from love for a child, but neither can be poured out infinitely.As Countess Eunice recovers the Emperor\u2019s love, Miraila will eventually be pulled out of his heart.Artizea was not like before, when she slandered and schemed against others to sow doubt in the Emperor\u2019s mind.In the past, she used to destroy people who wanted to get close to His Majesty, so that all his love would go to Miraila.But now, she had to drive Miraila out of the Emperor\u2019s heart and fill it with other people. At the same time, she had to prevent the emergence of anyone who had enough influence to replace Miraila.Shortly after Countess Eunice left the foyer, the Emperor and Miraila appeared.The servant glanced furtively at Artizea with an apologetic expression.\u201cI heard that Charlotte was here.\u201dThe Emperor looked down at the foyer. He saw Artizea holding a bloody handkerchief with a swollen cheek. The side of her lips, which had scratch marks caused by fingernails, was torn and still bleeding.That alone gave him a general idea of what had happened.He knew perfectly well Countess Eunice\u2019s temperament, and he also knew that she hated Artizea.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201dSaid the emperor in a low, muffled voice. The shame for his daughter\u2019s foolish behaviour was evident in his voice.Artizea knelt solemnly on one knee and responded.\u201cNothing happened.\u201d\u201cCharlotte seems to have been hard on you.\u201d\u201cCountess Eunice made a small mistake because she misses her father, I could not harbour any resentment against Your Majesty or the Countess for that alone.\u201dAfter Artizea said this, Miraila\u2019s face turned completely red and she exploded in anger.\u201cNo matter the reason, she came to my home and slapped my daughter on the cheek, how dare she despise us like this? You too! You should have called me when that happened!\u201d\u201cHow could I, a fatherless daughter, not understand Countess Eunice\u2019s feelings?\u201dArtizea said, addressing the Emperor, not Miraila.\u201cShe probably did this because she misses her father very much, and is jealous of me. Besides, as master of the Marquisate Rosan, the most important thing is that Your Majesty should feel comfortable in this place. Should I have made a big fuss over such a small matter?\u201dThe Emperor smiled.\u201cYou have a commendable heart.\u201dArtizea bowed her head respectfully.\u201cBut it\u2019s my fault for not disciplining Charlotte. She\u2019s very pretty, but also very violent because of her upbringing. Now that she has three children, she should improve her temper a bit. I\u2019m a little embarrassed because she hurt a young lady\u2019s face. Ask me anything you want. Come to think of it, I haven\u2019t even given you a birthday present.\u201dAlthough the Emperor said that, he had never cared about Artizea\u2019s birthday.Artizea was surprised by this windfall. However, she wouldn\u2019t make the mistake of asking for a gift at this point.Instead, she said.\u201cThen, with all due respect, I would like you to accept the gift I have prepared.\u201d\u201cGift? For me?\u201d\u201cYes, Your Majesty. In fact, it\u2019s a gift I had prepared to give to my mother on my birthday as a thank you for giving birth to me, but it\u2019s an accessory that comes in pairs for parents.\u201dArtizea bowed her head with deep regret.\u201cBut I had no one to accept the other pair. Even so, when I prepared it I thought of Your Majesty, but I could not even give it to my mother because I was not sure. If you would accept it, I would be very happy.\u201d\u201cHaha.\u201dThe Emperor laughed cheerfully.\u201cIf it is a accessory for parents, does that not mean that it is an accessory for a couple after all? How could I refuse to use an accessory for couples with Miraila? Bring it forth.\u201dArtizea winked at Alice, who was now in a corner of the foyer, observing the situation.Alice had come to report after she had finished distributing the bribe to the servants, but she was watching from afar when she came across this incident.Alice hurried to Artizea\u2019s room to bring a gift box that had been prepared.Meanwhile, the Emperor finished coming down the stairs and sat down comfortably on a sofa in the foyer.Artizea took the gift box that Alice had brought and held it carefully in front of the Emperor.Inside were a pair of large amber brooches.The Emperor took the woman\u2019s brooch and placed it on the top of Miraila\u2019s dress. Then he put the man\u2019s brooch on himself.He smiled at Artizea.\u201cDon\u2019t be so careful. You\u2019re Miraila\u2019s daughter, so you\u2019re like a daughter to me.\u201d\u201cI am honored.\u201dArtizea said politely.In the past, she really wanted to hear those words. She wanted to be part of the \u2018family\u2019 of Miraila and Lawrence.But in the end, the family she had imagined was just a sweet illusion.Lawrence had killed Miraila. There was no family to trust, love and support each other.\u201cSo, shall we head off to the opera now?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dMiraila coldly looked at Artizea as she stood up, holding the Emperor\u2019s hand.However, he seemed to like the brooch, he had a satisfied face.Artizea knelt down and bowed her head, waiting for the two of them to leave.Now with this, the Emperor will feel indebted to her for today\u2019s events, not to Miraila.Even if it was a momentary feeling, it was a big gain.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Become the Emperor to avenge the death of your parents.\u300dThose who mentioned that he should ascend the throne always told him these two things.It has been almost twenty years since his mother and father were executed after being falsely accused of treason.Most people in the empire had already forgotten. His family\u2019s position in power was restored, and he succeeded the Grand Duchy Evron.But he never forgot that he was standing on a thin line.Perhaps Emperor Gregor didn\u2019t kill him because he regretted killing his younger sister, or because he knew Cedric had no power to threaten him.But as successor to the throne, the story was different. Cedric\u2019s lineage was too deep to be ignored.His subjects were determined that if Cedric faced the same danger as the previous Grand Duke and Grand Duchess, then that was when they would truly raise their troops and show the true power of the Grand Duchy Evron.Cedric had always dissuaded them.Just as they protected Cedric, Cedric stood aside to protect them.He stayed away from the central political arena and acted as if he abhorred power. The Grand Duke Evron increasingly became the shield of the Empire.But eventually, unless he gave up his position as Grand Duke Evron and lived as a hermit, the only real way he could survive was by becoming the Emperor.However, he could not abandon his position as Grand Duke, let alone the Grand Duchy Evron. It was his family.Yet, to this day, he did not even think of pronouncing the words \u2018succession\u2019 or \u2018imperial throne\u2019, because he did not want to get his hands dirty to survive.Cedric would rather die honourably.Would his parents be happy if he ascended the throne staining their hands with the blood of revenge? He didn\u2019t think so.He couldn\u2019t even remember his mother\u2019s face.Besides, he was a good and just man, the people of the Grand Duchy Evron praised him for that, it was unlikely that Cedric would want revenge.However, Artizea did not want him to become Emperor for his survival or to seek revenge, but for the welfare of the people of the Crates Empire.Cedric was shocked.Until now, he had considered the Grand Duchy Evron his only responsibility. He had worked hard to protect his home and his precious people.But can he turn a blind eye to the Crates Empire itself?Of course not. He was the shield of the empire.He did not possess a shred of loyalty to the Imperial Family, but protecting the people of the empire was always on his mind.Cedric could not share this concern with anyone.His aides were willing to give their lives for him.If Cedric said that he would participate in the fight for succession, everyone would be happy and would act.He wanted to talk to Artizea again.He had the feeling that she would be able to point him in the right direction, even in the midst of the fog.All night long, he couldn\u2019t fall asleep once. When the sun came up, he realized that his mind was pointing in one direction.\u201cYou could not sleep well last night?\u201dAsked Ansgar, Grand Duke Evron\u2019s butler, who arrived at the barracks this morning.Cedric had already gotten up and was shaving himself. His face was haggard, and under his eyes there were dark circles.Ansgar followed Cedric to the battlefield to serve him.Cedric didn\u2019t need much of his attention. On the contrary, it was more exhausting to worry that nothing bad would happen to the old butler.But he was not able to tell him to stay and rest in the comfortable manor.Because he knew that after the tragic loss of his previous masters, Ansgar feared and worried that he might even lose him in that way.\u201cI tossed and turned in bed a little.\u201dAnsgar didn\u2019t ask why.He couldn\u2019t get involved in such matters. The only thing he could do for his master, who was dealing with his official duties, was to attend to him in any way he could.\u201cPlease sit down, Lord Cedric.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dCedric sat quietly in the chair.Ansgar grabbed a cushion and placed it behind his neck so he could lie down comfortably. Then he put a warm towel over his face.\u201cI think I might even fall asleep.\u201d\u201cWould you like to get some sleep?\u201d\u201cNo, I don\u2019t have enough time to sleep. I\u2019m going to the imperial palace today.\u201dAfter Cedric said that. Ansgar looked for his robe instead of his military uniform.Cedric changed his clothes and headed to the capital with two escorts.***Cedric arrived at the Imperial Palace around 10 a. m.The Emperor used to spend the morning attending small audiences and receiving personal guests.Cedric chose that time because he didn\u2019t want to have lunch with him.When he arrived, Countess Charlotte Eunice was already meeting the Emperor with her two daughters.The Countess Eunice had followed Artizea\u2019s advice.She was now 36, and her eldest daughter was 15 this year.Countess Eunice was at an age when she could not be considered pretty or charming, so it was no use for her to act arrogantly.If she wanted to gain the love of her father, the Emperor, she had to know how to recognize his mood and please him.For the sake of her daughters, too.The Emperor was not the kind of man to take care of his children, and neither did he have the need to do so. He only did it when he wanted to.As a result, Countess Eunice had entered a phase of rebelliousness, and after Lawrence was born, they had much less time to spend together, as father and daughter.But that didn\u2019t mean that he suddenly hated the daughter he loved so much.He just put her aside, because every encounter with his daughter ended up making his mood worse.Countess Eunice made a surprise visit to the Emperor to enter his heart again. Of course, the Emperor was not aware of her true intentions.He thought that perhaps she felt guilty for disturbing his tranquility yesterday and was trying to obtain his forgiveness in some way.Whatever the reason, for the first time in a long time, it seemed that his daughter had decided to change her mind and become a filial daughter. He was enjoying a good time.The Emperor was also pleased with the amber brooch that Artizea had given him.He had always accepted Artizea as an accessory to Miraila.Of course, he had never thought of her as a daughter, nor had he felt any family feeling towards her.But Artizea had never done anything wrong to hate her either.Although he had no sexual desire for her, he felt good knowing that this beautiful girl wanted to be loved by him.If Artizea had cried in yesterday\u2019s incident and Miraila had complained, the Emperor would have felt very bad.It was admirable that a girl of her age, prone to anger, did not complain despite being slapped on the cheek, and tried wisely to appease the Emperor\u2019s heart.Besides, now that his rebellious daughter was looking at him with love, he felt that he had gained much without having to do anything.The Emperor was old now. Unlike his younger days, he now enjoyed the tenderness of his children and grandchildren as much as his seductive lover.That\u2019s when he was informed of Cedric\u2019s visit. The Emperor gladly requested that Cedric be allowed in.\u201cLet him in. I\u2019m just taking a rest.\u201dCedric hesitated as he was about to enter the Emperor\u2019s living room under the guidance of the chief attendant.He had been surprised because he had been led into the living room, not the study or the or the audience chamber.Also, there was Countess Eunice with her daughters, in complete privacy.\u201cThank you for receiving me. If I had known Countess Eunice was here, I would not have bothered you.\u201dThat was the first thing Cedric said after making a formal greeting. The Emperor laughed.\u201cWhy are you behaving so formally? Charlotte is my daughter, you\u2019re my nephew, so you two are cousins. We\u2019re all family.\u201dThe Emperor said and laughed. He acted as if he didn\u2019t know Cedric hadn\u2019t entered the capital until now because of the Western Army issue.Sometimes, Cedric even thought the Emperor might have forgotten that he\u2019d killed his parents.Of course, that couldn\u2019t be true. Because if it were, there was no reason for the Emperor to try to bend him whenever he had the chance.Cedric nodded politely. The Emperor said cheerfully.\u201cYou two haven\u2019t seen each other in a long time, have you? Although you\u2019re cousins, considering Cedric has no brothers, you should behave like a real sister to him. I felt a bit bad because he often came to visit me, but he\u2019d been in the barracks outside the capital and wouldn\u2019t even come in.\u201dThe Emperor said.Cedric thought it was ridiculous.If he really felt bad, he could have told Cedric to have a private audience with him, leaving the complicated situation aside.Or he could have tried to listen to his reasons.But the Emperor didn\u2019t. He had ordered Cedric to return to the capital alone and bow to him, abandoning the Western Army.The Emperor said.\u201cAnd you should also be closer to Tia.\u201d\u201cFather. How could the Lady Artizea meet Cedric, who is always away on military business?\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about? When two people are destined to meet, it can happen at any time, right? Besides, is not Tia the sister of Lawrence? Although she doesn\u2019t have my blood.\u201d\u201cYou mean the Lady Artizea\u2026?\u201dCedric asked in surprise.It was because he didn\u2019t expect the name to come out of the Emperor\u2019s mouth first.\u201cI hear you sent a knight yesterday to escort Tia to her home.\u201dThe story had been told by Kishore to the Emperor.\u201cIt was no big deal, but you know that. We met casually at the temple and she had no escort, so I sent one of my men to escort her home.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve been circling outside the capital all this time and suddenly you decide to visit me. This has nothing to do with the Lady Artizea?\u201dCedric couldn\u2019t deny it right away, as he wasn\u2019t used to lying. The Emperor laughed merrily.\u201cSometimes you are also very old-fashioned. I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll be glad you\u2019re visiting her today.\u201d\u201cI did not come to the Imperial Palace for the Lady Artizea. Your Majesty, it is about the Western Army\u2026\u201d\u201cHeavens! Don\u2019t you understand why I brought you into my living room?\u201dThe Emperor roared, looking angry.And then he smiled softly.\u201cWe should not talk about such things when we are gathered as a family. Let\u2019s talk about it again in three days. Did you think I would forget what the Western Army has achieved this time?\u201dSaid the Emperor, pouring him a cup of tea.Cedric took the cup of tea to his mouth, hesitantly.Only then did he realise that the news of his meeting with Artizea had already changed the Emperor\u2019s attitude.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He then went to the manor of the Marquisate Rosan as originally planned.The butler was extremely surprised by the visit of the Grand Duke Evron.And he was even more surprised by the fact that the person he had come to visit was not Lawrence nor Miraila, but Artizea.\u201cThe Lady went out.\u201d\u201cWhere did she go?\u201dThe butler got nervous at his question.Cedric finally realised how badly Artizea\u2019s position was in this house.Artizea was the sole heir of the Marquess Rosan, so she would succeed the title in two years.But even so, the butler didn\u2019t even know where she\u2019d gone.The butler begged him repeatedly to wait a moment before approaching the maids.Cedric stayed in the foyer and waited.He was angry. This was inconceivable in the Grand Duchy Evron. Cedric had lost his parents tragically during his childhood, but his vassals cared for him as if he were their own son or grandson.Even the day he returned from the funeral, his house was still his home.The day he felt oppressed by the Emperor, the day he thought he could do nothing, even the day he simply wanted to surrender, and seek comfort with his broken heart, his house was still his home.It was a place where he could rest peacefully, and a place where he felt protected.His butler and servants were not just employees to him.Cedric regarded them as his family, they took the place of his late parents. They cared for Cedric as if he were their own son, their grandson, or even their brother.As Cedric waited standing, the butler of the Marquisate Rosan panicked and did not know what else to do.Artizea\u2019s trusted maids would not reveal where she went lightly.In the end, Cedric had to wait almost an hour before he received an answer.\u201cForgive me, Your Grace. I was informed that Lady Artizea has gone to the ball at Count Enda\u2019s estate. If you wait a little longer, I will ensure that she returns immediately.\u201d\u201cAre you in a superior position to Lady Artizea in this house?\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201dThe butler blinked his eyes. Cedric spoke coldly.\u201cAs far as I know, Lady Artizea is the successor of the Marquisate Rosan. Can you, a butler, tell her when to come and go?\u201d\u201cOh, no.\u201dThe butler quickly bowed his head and made up an excuse.\u201cI wanted to tell you that the young master Lawrence will soon return, Your Grace can converse with the young master. In the meantime, I will escort Lady Artizea back\u2026\u201dThe excuse made Cedric even angrier.\u201cI must have been mistaken.\u201d\u201cEh?\u201d\u201cI thought I was talking with the butler of the Marquisate Rosan, but you seem to be Lord Lawrence\u2019s butler.\u201dWhen Cedric said it, the butler\u2019s face turned pale.The butler had forgotten it because no one had pointed it out, but the master of the Marquisate Rosan was really Artizea.Although he was one of Miraila\u2019s henchmen, it was true that as the butler of the Marquisate Rosan, he had said some things he should not have.\u201cI apologize.\u201dThe butler bowed politely.Among the fussy and inflexible nobles of high society, there were those who were obsessed with etiquette and formalities, no matter who the person with the real power was.On top of that, Cedric hated Miraila.The butler felt cornered. And he thought the only way out of this situation was to apologize.He never imagined that Cedric would defend Artizea. He didn\u2019t even understand why he had come to see her.Artizea had had some good ideas lately, earning Miraila\u2019s praise.However, in the butler\u2019s mind, Artizea was just Miraila\u2019s punching bag.\u201cI will tell Lady Artizea about this.\u201dBecause it was not his own house, Cedric said these words and left the Marquisate Rosan.\u300cI just want to inherit the Marquisate Rosan completely and become independent\u2026. Please remain formally married to me for only two years and protect me, Your Grace.\u300dThat\u2019s what Artizea had told him.Cedric seemed to understand what she meant by \u2018protect me\u2019.***Artizea, who attended the ball on Count Enda\u2019s estate, stood aside as if it were an adornment.A ball like this, held at noon, was not a place to enjoy.It was a place for young men and women to socialize healthily under the supervision of adults.Of course, this was with the ultimate goal that they could find a good marriage partner.Still, most marriages were still decided by the heads of the families, taking into account the status and wealth of both families.However, meetings between energetic young people were not something that could be avoided.So parents preferred that these meetings be held in a controlled and supervised environment.Thanks to this, noble young people of marriageable age could make their own choice, even if their decision did not carry much weight.In addition to building social relationships between people of the same sex and sharing exciting moments with the opposite sex, they were able to experience social events.Also, through these meetings, they could determine whether a family could lead to chaos, whether there was a family with which a connection should be established by any means necessary, or whether a family should be ignored, all as appropriate.Artizea was one of the least popular girls in this type of ball.Considering her position as successor of the Marquisate Rosan, she should have been the center of attention at these social meetings.But Artizea was Miraila\u2019s daughter. Those who despised or hated Miraila naturally avoided her.And those sycophants who clung to Miraila ignored and mistreated Artizea in the same way that Miraila did. Because if they treated Artizea well, they feared that Miraila would lose her temper and become angry with them.\u2018And at this age, appearance is power.\u2019Artizea thought as she took a glass of apricot juice from the table and sipped it.After all, they were boys and girls under 20 years old.Few of them could notice the enormous wealth of the Marquisate Rosan behind Artizea.And even those who did, would still think that a beautiful appearance and a sweet personality were of greater value than wealth.Certainly a sweet personality is worth much more.Artizea thought so.Even if one possessed ten times the wealth of the Marquisate Rosan, it could not compare with the good heart of Licia.Artizea would wish to have a heart at least half as noble as that of Licia, even if she had to give up all the wealth of the Marquisate Rosan.\u201cHello, Lady Artizea.\u201dArtizea wanted the time to pass quickly to leave, preferably in silence and without exchanging greetings with anyone.However, it was not strange that things were not as she wanted.It was the beautiful Lady Atiyah who greeted her.\u201cWhy do you look so depressed? You are early, but you have not yet danced to a single song.\u201d\u201cSomeone has to stand still to decorate the walls.\u201d\u201cOh, my. I\u2019m sorry to hear that. All the men who have come to this ball are discourteous and heartless. I can\u2019t believe they haven\u2019t asked you to dance with them, not even a single song.\u201dAs she said this, Lady Atiyah lowered her long eyelashes.\u201cHowever, Lady Artizea you are also to blame. This is the fourth time you\u2019ve worn the same dress, how could true gentlemen tell if they\u2019ve danced with you today or if that happened at the last ball?\u201dThe young men around her laughed as their shoulders shook.Artizea showed a smile.Before, she used to be so unsure of her appearance and was so ashamed of her old clothes that she could not even lift her head when she heard these words.But now that she thought about it, she wondered if Lady Atiyah was in a position to say that.No matter how beautiful the flower of the ball was, Artizea was the successor of the Marquisate Rosan.The Count and Countess Atiyah were too insignificant to ignore her. They were nowhere near Miraila.Artizea said with a smirk.\u201cWith my ugly face wouldn\u2019t it be a waste if I wore a dress priced at hundreds of thousands of gold coins? Especially that dress\u2026 As far as I can see, it\u2019s an embroidered velvet dress from the Southern Kingdom Eon, right? A dress as precious as this must be worn by a beautiful lady like you, that would be the most rewarding thing for the designer who worked on it.\u201d\u201cOh, so you have a good eye.\u201d\u201cBut is that all right?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cEon\u2019s embroidered velvet is so expensive, that using that unreserved fabric to make such a splendid dress would cost over ten thousand gold coins in that material alone. And it seems this is the fourth dress of this type you have worn, so Count Atiyah must have invested almost half of his County\u2019s annual income in Lady Atiyah\u2019s dresses alone.\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\u201cAh, the Count and Countess Atiyah love you so much they didn\u2019t tell you anything, right? The marble mine, the County\u2019s main source of income, will probably be closed in a year or two, due to its low profitability. Even now, their income must have dropped drastically already. I know they\u2019re on the verge of bankruptcy.\u201dLady Atiyah\u2019s face turned blue.\u201cWell, it\u2019s too much money to spend that way, but it\u2019s not much if it\u2019s a big investment for the future of the family. Lady Atiyah, you are beautiful, so I am sure you can definitely meet your parents\u2019 expectations.Artizea said with a smile.\u201cAre you saying my parents are thinking of selling me?!\u201dLady Atiyah shouted loudly, forgetting the looks of the people.At the same time, there was a little commotion at the entrance, apparently because of the arrival of a new guest.Everyone looked in that direction.Cedric removed the long sword he carried and handed it to a servant.The people even stopped whispering, and only the sound of music could be heard in the quiet hall.\u201cYour Grace, what brings you to this place so suddenly?\u201dSaid Countess Enda, bowing politely.Cedric Evron was a man who ignited the hearts of countless girls with his handsome appearance and manly attitude, but he had never had a dance partner.He did not attend balls or parties at all, unless it was a ball at the Imperial Palace that he was obliged to attend.But he had appeared here, at a social meeting of young men and women.\u2018What effect would his participation in this ball have?\u2019 She was thinking about that.\u201cI need to meet someone, and I was told that person is here. I apologize for coming without an invitation. May I come in?\u201d\u201cOf course, there is no place in the high society of the Crates Empire where Your Grace cannot enter.\u201dSaid the Countess Enda.Despite the complex and critical political situation in which he found himself, Cedric was one of the best candidates for a husband.He was young and had already inherited the title of Grand Duke. He was also rich and a military hero on his own merits.Cedric Evron could be a kingmaker. If he chose to swear an oath of loyalty to Lawrence or Roygar, the current scenario for succession to the throne could change completely.\u2018Who has he come to meet?\u2019\u2018It can\u2019t be a woman, can it?\u2019Such questions ran through the minds of those present.But Cedric seemed completely unaware of it, crossed the hall and headed straight for Artizea.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Also, you have scratches caused by fingernails, and one side of your lips is also torn.\u201dCedric scrutinized her face to the point of appearing disrespectful.It was hard to tell at first glance, because she was well covered with makeup, but she definitely had traces of being slapped.Probably over time, blue bruises would form on her face.\u2018What the hell happened to her? Besides, with her face in this state, how could Miraila let her out?\u2019The same applied to the employees of the Marquisate Rosan. This was a private meeting, a ball she didn\u2019t need to attend.Artizea didn\u2019t really want to come. At a meeting like this, you couldn\u2019t get any useful information.But she had no choice but to attend because Miraila would be furious if she did not attend the meeting as she had ordered.\u201cYour Grace.\u201dArtizea grabbed his wrist with a face of embarrassment.Cedric stared at her and whispered softly.\u201cDid Countess Eunice do this to you?\u201d***Before he left the Imperial Palace, Countess Eunice stopped him.Cedric looked at her warily. Although they were cousins, they had never been close.\u300cAre you going to meet Lady Artizea?\u300d\u300cIs that any of your business?\u300d\u300cNo, but there is one thing I would ask of you.\u300d\u300cI can\u2019t guarantee anything, but go ahead, I\u2019m listening.\u300d\u300cPlease tell Lady Artizea that I regret what happened yesterday.\u300dSaid Countess Eunice clutching the skirt of her dress.\u300cIf you have something to apologize for, why don\u2019t you do it personally?\u300d\u300cOf course I\u2019ll visit her in person and apologize for it at the appropriate time. But right now I think a mediator is needed. Just tell her that, \u2018I\u2019m sorry, and I appreciate her advice\u2019.\u300dCedric didn\u2019t know why, but he nodded his head and left.***He never imagined it was because of this.\u201cThe Countess Eunice\u2026\u201d\u201cPlease, do not say anything more. If you continue, you\u2019ll put me in a difficult situation.\u201dArtizea pressed his wrist slightly.Cedric, impotent, released her chin. Then he spoke sternly, containing his anger.\u201cLet\u2019s go back.\u201dArtizea felt strange.Alice was the only person in her past life who had ever cared about her.After Alice\u2019s death, no one noticed her injuries.In her youth it was even worse.When Miraila was in a bad mood, she used to vent her anger on her.No one in the Marquisate Rosan cared that she was slapped on the cheek.However, now Cedric was angry about it. Of all people, Cedric.Somehow, with tears in her eyes, Artizea lowered her head and said stiffly.\u201cAlright.\u201dIt wouldn\u2019t be good for her to leave the ballroom under these circumstances.But Artizea wasn\u2019t here to find a good marriage partner anyway.Nor was there anyone in this place who wanted to be her friend. Her reputation had already hit rock bottom and so far it didn\u2019t look like it would get any better.Cedric took a step back and extended his arm to escort her.Just then, Lady Atiyah casually made eye contact with him.Lady Atiyah who had been staring blankly at the two of them, realized that this was her chance.She quickly grabbed the skirt of her dress, bowed and smiled as beautifully as possible.\u201cI apologize for my sudden greeting, Your Grace, Grand Duke Evron. My name is Laila, I am the daughter of Count Atiyah. I did not know that you knew the Lady Artizea.\u201cPleased to meet you. Lady, are you a friend of Lady Artizea?\u201d\u201cPardon? Ah, yes!\u201dLady Laila said that, thinking she could make a good impression on Cedric.Then, with a smile in her eyes, she continued.\u201cIt\u2019s not like a gentleman to come to a ball and leave without having danced. Even more so when there are young ladies present who have not danced to a single song.\u201dAll the warmth in Cedric\u2019s eyes faded away.\u201cThe true duty of a gentleman is to care for a woman in an uncomfortable situation. Lady Laila, are you really friends with Lady Artizea?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIf you are her friend you should be concerned about her, but you seem to be more focused on me.\u201dCedric said coldly.Lady Laila\u2019s face turned red with embarrassment.Artizea tugged slightly at his sleeve.From her point of view, there was no reason for Cedric to be angry with Lady Laila. So, she thought that his displeasure was due to Lady Laila having lied, saying that she was her friend.However, Cedric was truly indignant.From their first meeting, he had not stopped thinking of Artizea.He had decided to accept Artizea\u2019s proposal because she had mentioned a good cause.But beyond that, he felt the desire to protect this girl.\u2018She\u2019s too thin.\u2019He knew Miraila had a daughter, but he never thought she would be such a thin, pale girl.Artizea was a beautiful young woman with an elegant physique and snow-white skin, contrary to what he had imagined.But her face, which had never been cared for, was haggard, her body too thin, and her cheeks sunken.Her wrists that protruded from her long-sleeved dress were so skinny that one could only see bones.On the other hand, she wore the same dark green striped dress she had worn yesterday.It was a normal dress, suitable for a walk, but it could not be considered a party dress at all.Even Cedric, who was not familiar with the atmosphere of the ballrooms, could realize that Artizea was being excluded.Although she was the heir to the Marquess Rosan and the sister of a potential candidate to become the next emperor, the young lady, despised by her family, was not welcome anywhere.Artizea herself seemed to accept it as normal.Even that, made Cedric uncomfortable, because it seemed that she was giving up the rights she was supposed to enjoy as a daughter and as a human being.\u201cThen, Lady Artizea.\u201dCedric reached out to Artizea.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cMay I have this dance?\u201dLady Laila\u2019s face was distorted by the humiliation she felt.It was far from Cedric\u2019s usual personality to do anything that would draw attention in a ballroom like this. But now he wanted to do it.\u201cI really don\u2019t want to draw too much attention.\u201dArtizea whispered quietly. Cedric responded.\u201cI know. It\u2019s all right, Lady Artizea. The Grand Duke Evron makes for an ideal complement.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dArtizea didn\u2019t respond.Because Cedric seemed to have noticed that her outfit was unsuitable for this ball and that she was being ignored.She seemed to be indifferent to such things. This time, however, she was embarrassed.\u201cCome on.\u201dCedric urged.The fact that a man asked her to dance was strange to Artizea. And even more so because on this occasion, that man was Cedric.She had to summon up some courage to take his hand.Artizea didn\u2019t know why she was so nervous.\u201cI could step on your feet. I\u2019m not very good at dancing.\u201d\u201cThen even if we step on each other\u2019s feet, let\u2019s be understanding and pretend not to notice. I can\u2019t dance well either.\u201dCedric said and tugged on her hand.When he wrapped his arm around her waist, Artizea became extremely tense.Although he said he wasn\u2019t good at dancing, Cedric guided the dance to the rhythm of the music, like a duck to water, and headed towards the centre of the ballroom.Whispers exploded everywhere.Some couples stepped aside, and others stopped dancing altogether to watch them.As she danced, Artizea felt that the hall was empty.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It was at Lawrence and Licia\u2019s wedding reception.That wedding served to turn Lawrence from an illegitimate son, who could not even be called Prince, into the Crown Prince.No one thought Cedric would be present.Not only did he attend the wedding, but also the wedding reception.And he asked Artizea to dance with him.Perhaps it was the strangest event that had occurred in high society back then.\u300cI had never seen you dance before, I assumed you didn\u2019t know.\u300d\u300cYour Grace, weren\u2019t you the one who didn\u2019t know how to dance?\u300dThen Cedric stared at her.\u300cMarchioness, do you know why I wanted to dance with you on this occasion?\u300d\u300cI have no idea.\u300d\u300cIs there anything the Marchioness cannot guess?\u300d\u300cI am not a saint who passes on oracles from the future, nor am I a sage capable of looking through the heavens. So how can I guess? There are many things I don\u2019t know.\u300dThat day they went around in circles, holding hands, just like they were doing now.However, Cedric kept a perfect distance from Artizea, as if he didn\u2019t want to touch the bottom of her dress.She felt such a stifling tension, her skin crawled.Artizea was so exhausted that she almost collapsed when the waltz\u2019s melody was about to end.She didn\u2019t want to look weak in front of Cedric, so she struggled to stay on her feet without losing her composure, that memory was still alive in her mind.\u300cI did it, because I have a favor to ask of you Marchioness, but I didn\u2019t want others to hear and misinterpret my words. It\u2019s not related to politics, I wanted to tell you face to face, looking you in the eye.\u300d\u300cGo ahead. Your Grace\u2019s words will not be misinterpreted. \u300d\u300cIf the Marchioness says so, then perhaps it is true.\u300d\u300cIf I wanted to do so, to speak face to face with Your Grace or not, it would make no difference.\u300dCedric laughed quietly.His laughter resounded in Artizea\u2019s ears and shook her chest.The words that are spoken looking directly into each other\u2019s eyes are more meaningful than the rest.Artizea could no longer look at him directly, and lowered her head. But as if she had been drawn in, she quickly looked him in the eye again.From her perspective, his black eyes reflected her ugly face.\u300cYes. I know that. Truth and honesty mean nothing to you, all you care about is getting the results you want.\u300d\u300cI\u2019m sorry.\u300d\u300cPlease look after Licia. That\u2019s what I wanted to tell you.\u300dCedric said.Artizea looked at him in surprise.She was better at reading people\u2019s minds than anyone else, but she never expected Cedric to say that.\u300cWhy are you telling me? You should tell His Highness the Crown Prince.\u300d\u300cI can\u2019t trust Lawrence.\u300d\u300cBut do you trust me?\u300d\u300cMarchioness, I know that you employed all sorts of tricks to get Licia to marry Lawrence, even manipulating the oracle. So you, as Lawrence\u2019s schemer, should naturally take care of her. Besides, being a Saintess is already a big burden.\u300d\u300c\u2026\u300d\u300cRegardless of the motives, the final decision was taken by Licia. So there\u2019s nothing more I can say about it. But she\u2019s like a younger sister to me, so I can\u2019t help but worry about her. I just hope you protect Licia and the Empire for a long time.\u300dArtizea didn\u2019t lower her head, but even then, she lowered her gaze.\u300cHow could I ignore Your Grace\u2019s words? I will do everything I can to protect her and the Empire.\u300dBut she could not keep her promise.And now that she was dancing with Cedric, she couldn\u2019t stop thinking about that moment.Unlike then, Cedric had a calm look on his face. His hand around her waist moved smoothly, facilitating the harmony of the dance.\u2018Because he doesn\u2019t know anything about it.\u2019Artizea felt her heart squeeze, as she thought about it.The deep pain in her chest was because she could not keep her promise.Or so she thought.As she returned to the past, the consequences of her evil acts disappeared.But for her, that doesn\u2019t mean that her evil acts were erased.This time I will keep my promise. I will protect and care for Licia so that she can become a true Empress.While thinking about this, she couldn\u2019t help but lose her concentration.Artizea never had a good athletic ability. She was not used to dancing, so she had to focus on her steps.The moment Artizea stumbled and was about to step on Cedric\u2019s foot, he lifted her slightly, with his arm around her waist.Then, as if he had originally intended to do so, he made a half turn and lowered her. His steps were impeccable.Artizea suddenly returned to reality, her face blushing completely.Cedric smiled.\u201cApparently, my dancing skills are a little better than Lady Artizea\u2019s.\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you being too cruel to me by comparing my movements with those of Your Grace, a renowned warrior?\u201dArtizea replied seriously. At her comment, Cedric laughed.Artizea stared blankly at Cedric, it was the first time she had seen him laugh from so close.***The dance music was over. Cedric escorted her out.Artizea\u2019s carriage was waiting outside the main gate.Cedric helped Artizea into the carriage, and then he got into it too. This was the best way to strike up a conversation.Cedric closed the door, and soon the carriage began to move.Then Artizea spoke.\u201cThank you for your consideration.\u201d\u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d\u201cFor dancing with me.\u201d\u201cI only did the duty of a gentleman.\u201d\u201cI know you did it to defend my honour in front of Lady Laila.\u201d\u201cIt was no big deal.\u201dCedric shook his head. Artizea smiled slightly.\u201cMay I ask you another favor?\u201d\u201cGo ahead.\u201d\u201cI want to visit a place before I go home, would you like to accompany me?\u201d\u201cOf course. I have no objection to accompanying you.\u201dWhen Cedric answered, Artizea instructed the coachman to go to Reve Street.Cedric asked, puzzled.\u201cWhat are you going to do in Reve Street?\u201dReve was a slum, where nobles like Lady Artizea should not go. Even burly men were reluctant to visit.\u201cThere\u2019s someone I need to meet. I had no one to escort me to that place safely, so I didn\u2019t know what to do. It\u2019s a bit far, but we have a lot to talk about, so I think it\u2019ll be fine. Is that all right with you?\u201d\u201cYes. Anyway, I came here for you. I don\u2019t care if we have our conversation in the carriage or in a comfortable tearoom.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dArtizea bowed her head. Cedric looked at her with interest.\u201cBy the way, I think you know why I\u2019ve come to meet you.\u201d\u201cYou went to the Imperial Palace today, didn\u2019t you?\u201dCedric was silent for a moment. Then he spoke slowly.\u201cIs it possible to enter the capital in secret? Besides, it would not be right for me to visit His Majesty, after having talked to you.\u201d\u201cI thought of it because you mentioned the Countess Eunice in the hall.\u201dArtizea continued.\u201cYour Grace is not so close to the Countess Eunice as to meet her alone, so you probably met by chance. The Countess Eunice must also have visited His Majesty today.\u201d\u300cJust tell her that, \u2018I\u2019m sorry, and I appreciate her advice\u2019.\u300dCedric recalled the words Countess Eunice asked him to convey to Artizea.\u201cDid you advise the Countess Eunice to visit His Majesty today?\u201d\u201cShe did not necessarily have to do so today. I only told her that if she wanted to get my mother out of His Majesty\u2019s heart, it would be best for her to behave like a lovely daughter, instead of being angry, competing with Miraila and criticising His Majesty.\u201dSaid Artizea.Cedric looked again at Artizea\u2019s swollen cheek.Artizea had an upright posture and a serene expression.Cedric could not help overlapping on her face the expression of despair, pain and tears that he saw in his dream.He did not know how to explain what he was feeling.That was an unbearable dream of just thinking about wanting to wipe her tears and not being able to do it.Artizea spoke calmly, not knowing what was going on in Cedric\u2019s mind.\u201cSo, how did it go at the Imperial Palace?\u201d\u201cHis Majesty knew we met for the first time yesterday. Lady Artizea, did you tell him?\u201d\u201cHe found out, but I didn\u2019t mean to. When I returned home yesterday, His Majesty was at the manor of the Marquisate Rosan.\u201d\u201cKnight Benjamin informed me of your meeting with Sir Kishore.\u201d\u201cYes. So I told him what happened. Sir Kishore has always been very kind to me.\u201dCedric said with a bitter smile.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to keep pretending that it\u2019s all a coincidence, Lady Artizea. His Majesty\u2019s attitude has already changed, although we only met yesterday for the first time.\u201d\u201cYes, it was to be expected. His Majesty sees much further than my mother and brother.\u201d\u201cIt was the first time in years that His Majesty told me I was part of his family. He even mentioned that he wouldn\u2019t forget the achievements of the Western Army, although he didn\u2019t want to talk about it and put it off for another day, he seems to be considering it positively. And that\u2019s because of the possible relationship between us.\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019m sure of that.\u201d\u201cI did not expect His Majesty to speak in a kind and open manner. Lady Artizea seem to be a person capable of seeing the future.\u201dArtizea was embarrassed.\u201cIt is also partly thanks to Countess Eunice that His Majesty was in a good mood.\u201d\u201cWasn\u2019t it the Countess Eunice who did that to you?\u201dCedric pointed again at Artizea\u2019s cheek.Artizea involuntarily put her hand over the wound.\u201cThis is no big deal.\u201d\u201cWould you at least be willing to explain what happened to you to a person who cares about you?\u201d\u201cSimply, Countess Eunice waved her hand in a fit of anger, and unfortunately slapped me.\u201d\u201cHow is that not a big deal?\u201d\u201cBecause I let her slap me. She was very angry at the time, and if she hadn\u2019t, she wouldn\u2019t have calmed down enough to hear my words.\u201dArtizea answered his question, and then she said.\u201cSo, have you made a decision about my offer?\u201d\u201cBefore I give you an answer, I would like to ask you a question.\u201d\u201cGo ahead.\u201d\u201cWhy do you want a divorce in two years?\u201d\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Even legally, the only descendant of Marquess Rosan are you.\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cThis inheritance is protected by God and the Temple. Not even His Majesty can act arbitrarily.\u201cYes. Besides, just because he loves my mother, His Majesty will not put me under too much political pressure.\u201d\u201cSo Lady Artizea, what you need is a husband who has the proper social status to protect you from trouble. For that reason, it is too risky to choose me as a partner.\u201dCedric said.\u201cIf it is not power and glory you desire, there is no reason for you to marry me and enter the battle for the succession to the imperial throne. I don\u2019t know if you want to become the Empress, but I don\u2019t understand why you want a divorce in two years.Artizea gave a long sigh.To tell the truth, it was because of Licia that she wanted a divorce in two years.Licia was still young. However, in two years, she would be as beautiful as a rose in all its splendour.And on her 20th birthday, she received an oracle.\u2014Take care of the weak and disadvantaged in my name.That was the oracle that originally descended to the Temple.It was the first time in almost 100 years that an oracle descended.Licia became a Saintess at the same time she received the oracle.The faithful rejoiced with tears in their eyes, and even those who did not believe in God were amazed.She lived as a Saintess with every fiber of her being. She extended her hand to all who needed her, saving even the dying.When the flood damage from the Ava River caused an epidemic, she just took some of her assistants and ran to the center of it, purifying the contaminated wells and treating the people.She was also the one who gave hope to the people when the wave of monsters turned the Western Region into hell.She saved countless lives and gave hope to many more.She was able to heal anyone in need with her sacred power. But she probably healed more hearts than diseases or wounds. The wishes of the people were gathered in the Saintess. She never got involved in politics. She didn\u2019t even appear in social circles, and was rarely in the capital.Among the nobles, Cedric was the only one who protected and helped her.For the people, it was the Saintess who would guide them, not the Emperor or the Archbishop of the Temple.The faith of the people is the will of God.So Artizea took advantage of this and fabricated a new oracle.\u2014The Saintess would become the Empress.In the face of this fact, the people were deeply pleased.The authority of the Imperial Family and the Temple would be restored to its original position once and for all. The Imperial Family would gain its lost legitimacy through the Saintess, and the Temple could interfere with the power of the secular world.Until that moment, the struggle for succession had remained at an impasse.Although Lawrence was the Emperor\u2019s favored child, he could do nothing on his own against Roygar. On the other hand, the Grand Duke Roygar could not overwhelm the Emperor\u2019s favored child with his power either.In that situation, the lie spread by Artizea made the struggle between the two take a different direction.By indicating that a woman would become an Empress, it meant that her husband would become an Emperor.Emperor Gregor, Lawrence and Grand Duke Roygar believed in the power they had in their hands rather than superstitions, like an oracle.Probably, although Artizea did not reveal it, the emperor also knew that the oracle had been fabricated.However, people all over the country believed that the beautiful and good-hearted Saintess would become the Empress, so no one could betray that belief.The marriage to Licia became the final piece to complete Lawrence\u2019s legitimacy.And now, she would do the same for Cedric.Besides, Licia and Cedric were originally in love with each other. If she let things take their course, they would fall in love again and get married.At least that\u2019s what Artizea thought, so she wanted to divorce him before that.Before the oracle descended. Before Licia became a Saintess and Cedric helped her. She wanted to divorce before they developed feelings of love for each other.Cedric was a man of integrity. She was sure that if she asked him to divorce her so that he could marry Licia after the oracle descended, he would not do it.Artizea also did not want the man she served to be branded as someone who had divorced his wife just because he wanted to be with the Saintess.She couldn\u2019t tell Cedric about this situation right now.Artizea hesitated. Cedric realized this and said.\u201cCan\u2019t you tell me?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not trying to trick you, Your Grace. It is just that I do not want to become the Empress, although I consider it best for the empire that no one but Your Grace becomes the Emperor. Besides, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m suitable for that position. You may think it\u2019s for a greater good.\u201d\u201cLady Artizea, you seem determined to sacrifice yourself for the good of the empire.\u201dArtizea shook her head.\u201cI am the least appropriate person to receive such words.\u201dAs the conversation continued, the carriage came to Reve Street and stopped.The coachman touched the carriage window to find out exactly where she wanted to go.Artizea in response, tapped the window three times to indicate to the coachman and her maid that here was good.Then she looked Cedric in the face.Cedric said.\u201cI think it\u2019s too early to talk about the imperial throne.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cHowever, I gratefully accepted her offer to overcome the situation of the Western army. As long as we hold hands, I will protect Lady Artizea with all my might. And you will do your best for the welfare of the Grand Duchy Evron and for me. Do you agree with that?\u201d\u201cYes. And the divorce\u2026\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s think about it in two years\u2019 time.\u201d\u201cI understand what you mean. Until a relationship of full trust is established, it is best to secure what can be given and received.\u201dSaid Artizea. Cedric looked at Artizea, feeling a pressure on his heart.\u201cI have one condition.\u201dWhen Cedric said this, Artizea got nervous.She wondered what to do if it was one condition she couldn\u2019t fulfill. Would it be better to lie, or to equivocate?She thought he would demand honesty, not scheming, or something like that.But Cedric said.\u201cI hate that people around me get hurt. If you want to be by my side, then you must remember that.\u201d\u201cYes, I understand.\u201d\u201cLady Artizea, you don\u2019t seem to know. What I mean is that you yourself must not be hurt either. Please don\u2019t let that happen again.\u201dCedric said, pointing to her cheek.\u201cI\u2019d rather have you hit them.\u201dArtizea couldn\u2019t help but laugh. Cedric smiled too.\u201cI\u2019d rather be hit, so I can sue and spread rumours to crush the other person\u2019s reputation, rather than be the one to do it.\u201d\u201cI just don\u2019t want you to get hurt.\u201d\u201cYes, all right. Thank you for your concern, Your Grace.\u201dShe responded with a smile on her face.Cedric showed a full smile, thinking that her smiling face looked much better than her serious face.\u201cWell, I have one condition too.\u201d\u201cGo ahead.\u201d\u201cThere is a jewel called Saintess Olga\u2019s Heart, the heirloom of the Fischer Viscounty. Give it to me as a marriage proposal gift.\u201dCedric was surprised because he never expected Artizea to ask him for jewelry or anything else.\u201cThe family heirloom of the Fischer Viscounty\u2026?\u201d\u201cYes. That will make it easier for you to understand what kind of person I am.\u201dArtizea said quietly.\u201cIf you don\u2019t change your mind after getting Saintess Olga\u2019s Heart, propose to me so magnificently that everyone will talk about it.\u201dCedric nodded his head without asking any more questions.Artizea tried to open the carriage door.Cedric gently blocked her hand, and smiled at Artizea, who was surprised. Then he opened the door and went out first.After getting out, he extended his hand to Artizea. Artizea hesitated and put her hand on his.Then Cedric raised it and lowered it.\u201cAh.\u201d\u201cIt is not proper for a lady to get off the carriage first.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026 that\u2019s right.\u201dArtizea blushed a little. She felt like a little fish was swimming in her chest.The path was narrow and muddy. A crowd of children, like mosquitoes, crowded around her and spread their hands.\u201cGive me a penny!\u201d\u201cHave mercy, beautiful lady!\u201d\u201cThe more sustenance you give to the poor, God will prepare a better place in heaven for you.\u201dAlice hastily took out a black cloak and put it on Artizea. Artizea lowered the hood of her cloak deeply.\u201cDo you always have that cloak ready beforehand? I don\u2019t think you would have planned to come to this place today.\u201d\u201cYes, because the color of my hair usually draws attention.\u201dArtizea responded.The coachman shouted and chased away the crowd. Artizea quickly left the main path, escorted only by Cedric.Walking through the alleys of Revi Street with one or two ordinary men was a great adventure.But Cedric was no ordinary man. He was the Shield of the Empire and the greatest warrior in the Empire.Although Artizea was covered in a black cloak, she could not hide the silhouette of her dress, which clearly showed that she was a noblewoman.It was clear that her companion was also a nobleman. In this scenario, it would not be surprising if they were assaulted in less than five minutes.However, due to Cedric\u2019s overwhelming presence, no one showed up.Artizea did not notice, but Cedric could feel some of them around him, tense and holding their breath.\u201cWho are you going to meet?\u201d\u201cWith the butler who had been serving Marquisate Rosan for generations and who was dismissed shortly after the death of the previous Marquess Rosan.\u201dArtizea continued.\u201cI have no one I can trust. He probably holds a grudge against my mother and me, but his family has been loyal to Marquisate Rosan for generations, so I\u2019m sure that will make him at least listen to me.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dCedric looked around again.He couldn\u2019t believe that a butler who had served a wealthy, noble family for generations would be in a place like this.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 17": "Chapter 17Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 17Translator: GoldThe place where Marcus Hanson, the old Rosan Family butler, lived was a ramshackle tavern on a corner of Reve Street.He did odd jobs during the day and served customers at night, living in a small room attached to the tavern.Marcus had many children and grandchildren, but the family had split up a long time ago.Artizea had never met Marcus Hanson in her past life.In the past, his granddaughter, Lise Hanson, had come in as Artizea\u2019s maid, concealing her name with the intention of getting revenge.Lise Hanson had thought that she had completely concealed her identity.However, at that time, Artizea already had many enemies. She had to be careful even with her new maids.After checking Lise\u2019s background, Artizea had thought that her ambition and temperament would fit in well with her work.In that way, she had secured the position that Marcus Hanson had held. Having taken her grandfather hostage, Lise had no choice but to remain loyal to the end.However, in reality, she had done nothing to Marcus. She had not even met him in person.But when she entered the tavern, she could tell at a glance who Marcus was.Marcus was a 78-year-old man, but he stood erect and firm. Even though the old-fashioned suit he was wearing was worn out, it looked clean, even his cuffs were white.He asked, without losing his composure, while the other man who worked with him was overwhelmed by Cedric\u2019s sword and his splendid clothes.\u201cDear nobles, what brings you to a place like this?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cCan you give us a moment of your time, Mr. Hanson?\u201dMarcus was silent for a moment. But he soon told the other employee.\u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d\u201cA-Are you sure, old man?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I don\u2019t think they want to kill me.\u201dHe said that and turned around, walked away.Artizea followed him, along with Cedric.Marcus led them to a vacant lot behind the tavern, where they used to put the garbage.\u201cThis is not a nice place, but I work here, so it\u2019s hard to get them to a clean place. Grand Duke Evron, why did you come to visit a man like me?\u201dHe recognised Cedric and asked him.Eighteen years ago, when Marcus was forced to leave the Marquisate Rosan, Cedric was a child who was not yet ten years old.However, Cedric looked like his father, his predecessor, the Grand Duke Evron.As the former chief butler of the Rosan Family, Marcus knew the faces, personalities and history of all the high nobility.For that reason, it was not surprising that he knew who Cedric was.\u201cAlthough our family has been kicked out, we have served the Rosan Family for generations. There is nothing I can tell you.\u201dMarcus thought the reason for Cedric\u2019s visit was to unearth the Rosan Family\u2019s weaknesses.But Cedric shook his head.\u201cI am simply her escort.\u201dCedric pointed to Artizea.Artizea slowly took off the hood. Her platinum-blond hair slid over her shoulders.Even in the vacant lot resembling a rubbish dump, the sun shone, with Artizea\u2019s hair glittering intensely.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cGreetings, Mr. Marcus Hanson. I am Artizea Rosan.\u201dArtizea looked up. Marcus stared at her for a moment without saying a word.pent-up anger, grudge, longing, and sorrow welled up inside him, making the old man\u2019s wrinkled face contort.Marcus did not know what to say.\u2018Miraila\u2019s daughter?\u2019\u2018The person who had caused the destruction of my family and the extermination of the Rosan Family?\u2019But he finally spoke in a trembling voice.\u201cYou certainly look a lot like Lord Michael. Heir apparent.\u201dEighteen years had cleared away the grudge inside him. Old age had exhausted his body to the point where he didn\u2019t have the strength to vent his pent-up anger.The longing called forth sorrow. The most intense feeling in Marcus was sorrow.And sorrow is a feeling that one wants the other person to understand. One wants to be heard, to be comprehended and to be embraced.That was the only remedy.Marcus still missed the Marquisate Rosan.The Hanson Family had served as butlers to the Marquisate Rosan for generations. Although they were not aristocrats, they prided themselves on being different from ordinary people.Marcus was born in Marquess Rosan\u2019s estate, and as a child he became a playmate of the Marquess\u2019 children.Since he grew up, he learned to work as Michael Rosan\u2019s attendant. After some experience, he started working as a butler under the orders of his grandfather, the head butler.His children and grandchildren were also born at Marquess Rosan\u2019s estate.His sons and daughters followed in his footsteps, serving the Rosan Family.He couldn\u2019t help but get nostalgic. The more he remembered his family, the more he remembered the good times and the more he missed the Marquisate Rosan.He wanted someone to help him with this pain, this sorrow.Artizea could see it in Marcus\u2019 face and trembling eyes.It was the same feeling she had sensed in Lise Hanson, who had wanted to kill her in the past.\u201cMr. Hanson, you are the first person to address me as heir apparent.\u201dArtizea said in a soft voice. Marcus spoke firmly.\u201cHeir apparent, does your mother know\u2026 that you have come to this place?\u201d\u201cShe should not. If she knew, she wouldn\u2019t have let me come.\u201dSaid Artizea, then she put her hand on her chest and bowed deeply.It was a polite bow, as if she were bowing to a priest.\u201cMr. Hanson. I have many things to say to you, but first I must apologize.\u201d\u201cDo you know what your mother did?\u201d\u201cYes. My mother poisoned all the direct descendants of the Marquess Rosan and framed the Hanson Family. In order to make me the sole heir to the Marquisate Rosan.\u201dThe poisoning incident took place during Michael Rosan\u2019s mourning period. It occurred when Artizea was six months old.Michael\u2019s oldest daughter, who was to succeed him, was in shock when she learned that Miraila\u2019s daughter looked incredibly like Michael. But there was no way Artizea could be the daughter of the dying Michael. Perhaps one of Michael\u2019s young grandchildren had played with fire, sleeping with Miraila. For that reason, she had decided to recognize Artizea as her sister, because she preferred that, instead of hearing that her son had impregnated the one who was like his grandmother.Thus Artizea became a legitimate daughter of the Marquess Rosan.But Miraila, who had lost the Emperor\u2019s favor by becoming pregnant with Artizea, was not satisfied with that. She needed more reliable safeguard.She saw the funeral as an opportunity. She poisoned the dinner table, where all of Michael\u2019s direct descendants had gathered.Marcus tried to prove that Miraila was lying and that she was the real culprit.However, his intelligent daughter, seeing him shaking with fear, gave her opinion.\u300cYou should give up on that idea, Father. You\u2019re putting our lives at risk.\u300d\u300cBut I have proof.\u300d\u300cWhat\u2019s the use of all that? Nothing\u2019s going to change for a while. Even if Miraila\u2019s guilt is proven, we\u2019ll probably be dead before that happens. She\u2019s the only one who deserved it.\u300d\u300cHis daughter continued in tears.\u300d\u300cAnyway, the inheritance belongs to the only surviving descendant, Miss Artizea. If you manage to reveal the truth, do you think she\u2019ll be grateful? Father, you\u2019d be the enemy of her mother!\u300dHe knew his daughter was right.\u300cFather, please give up. Our family and the Rosan Family are finished.\u300dIf another heir to the Marquess Rosan had survived, he would have fought loyally to the end.However, the only direct descendant of the Marquess Rosan who had survived was Artizea.In any case, Miraila would not leave the Hanson Family alone, even if she took control of the Marquisate Rosan.Finally, Marcus asked his children and grandchildren to escape before anything bad happened to them.He told them to conceal their identity and forget about the Hanson Family and the Marquisate Rosan. As long as his descendants could still be alive, it would be fine for Marcus.However, he himself could not give up his name.Even though the Hanson Family, which he considered honorable disappeared, he was still Marcus Hanson.\u2018Anyway, I\u2019m an old man. If one day Miraila finds me and kills me, it doesn\u2019t matter.\u2019That\u2019s what he thought.Miraila\u2019s malicious scheme had not been properly planned and executed, leaving loose ends. She had no useful advisor, no trusted employee.Marcus had managed to go into hiding.Then something more frightening happened than his daughter had anticipated.The Emperor intervened.The Emperor was furious about Miraila\u2019s infidelity. But in the end, he prevented Miraila from being executed.The huge bribes and power covered up the truth.The Emperor opened his bedroom door again to Miraila. Like a bird, Miraila flew into the Emperor\u2019s arms and embraced him.After all, nothing could be found, despite the search for the poisoner.Marcus couldn\u2019t show his face to the world again. That\u2019s why he\u2019d been leading a hard life in this tavern on Reve Street.\u201cI do not intend to excuse my mother\u2019s actions. I\u2019m not doing this in her name.\u201dMarcus was staring at her. Artizeria straightened her back, looked at him and said.\u201cAs the last descendant of the Marquess Rosan, I apologize for not protecting my retainers.\u201d\u201cHeir apparent\u2026\u201d\u201cI am sorry.\u201dShe bowed her head again. Marcus\u2019 eyes got wet.Artizea approached him and offered him a handkerchief. Marcus accepted the handkerchief.Cedric was watching the scene from a short distance.Some of his retainers cherished him more than his family, and as someone who wanted to protect them, he could not help but have mixed feelings.Also, Cedric felt a relief in his heart, because he thought that Marcus would be the first person to take care of Artizea, who was isolated in the Marquisate Rosan.***At that time, Bill, the butler of the Marquisate Rosan, was telling Miraila about Cedric\u2019s visit.\u00a1Crash!Miraila stood up abruptly and waved her hands, upset.A glass vase that was almost a work of art broke when it fell on the floor.The glass shards spread out and shone on the leopard-skin rug.Bill knelt quickly in front of Miraila, not caring about the glass that was scattered on the floor. Then, politely, he gave the slippers to her.Miraila, who was barefoot and only wore a thin robe over her underwear, slipped her feet through the slippers and sat back down on the sofa with a thud.\u201cTell me again.\u201d\u201cHis Grace the Grand Duke Evron asked me why I was loyal to you and not to Miss Artizea.\u201dBill said, interpreting Cedric\u2019s words to his convenience. Miraila was burning like fire.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 18": "Chapter 18Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 18Translator: Gold\u201cWhat? Who is he to say that?\u201d\u201cHe said Lady Artizea is the master of the Marquisate Rosan, so he would tell her about what happened.\u201dMiraila stood up once more.\u201cTia is the master? You just stood there listening to him?\u201d\u201cIt was the Grand Duke Evron. How could I dare to answer him? He could have slit my throat at that very moment.\u201d\u201cHa.\u201dMiraila felt her throat burn and reached out her hand. Bill quickly offered her a glass of cold water.Miraila drank the glass of water, sighed and sat back down on the couch.\u2018It\u2019s strange. Where did she meet the Grand Duke Evron?\u2019She had a hunch.When it came to relationships between a man and a woman, Miraila\u2019s hunches had always been right.Rationally, she thought there was no way an unattractive girl like Artizea could catch the Grand Duke Evron. There was no way they could have met anywhere.But her hunch told her otherwise.Somehow she felt a little unpleasant, no, she was really in a bad mood.Artizea was an ugly girl. Miraila thought that from the bottom of her heart.\u2018Artizea doesn\u2019t resemble me at all. She\u2019s 18 years old, but she doesn\u2019t have any feminine traits, not even a charm. She could only live with me, because I\u2019m her mother. She has no chance of getting married, right?\u2019That\u2019s what she thought, but not the Grand Duke Evron.However, Miraila also believed that all girls were the same. Even with the odds against them, they would find a way to seduce men.\u2018Maybe I\u2019m overthinking it.\u2019At that point. A servant knocked hastily at the door.Bill offered a small apology to Miraila, and went to open the door.\u201cHead Butler, Grand Duke Evron\u2019s squire is here.\u201d\u201cHis squire? What for?\u201d\u201cApparently, after attending the ball at Count Enda\u2019s estate, the Grand Duke and Miss Artizea went somewhere in her carriage. His Grace asked the squire to wait for him here.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dBill glanced sidelong at Miraila, her face was turning fierce.Just then Lawrence appeared.He had just returned home after going out for some fresh air. He was frowning, like he was upset about something.\u201cYoung Master, did you enjoy your outing?\u201dBill bowed his head politely. The servant knelt quickly on one knee.Lawrence used to stare at Bill, the Head Butler, when he was in a bad mood.And now, it seemed to be the case.\u201cBill. Grand Duke Evron\u2019s squire is out there. What\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cOh, that is\u2026\u201d\u201cLawrence, my prince, welcome home.\u201dMiraila left her room with a bright smile, wearing a coat over her thin robe.Lawrence looked at his mother with an annoyed expression.\u201cDid any trouble happen with the Grand Duke Evron?\u201d\u201cNo. How could I have a problem with the Grand Duke? He is a warrior who goes from one battlefield to another. He only came to visit Tia this afternoon.\u201dMiraila grumbled. Lawrence\u2019s face contorted.\u201cAre you angry about something?\u201d\u201cYou haven\u2019t been disrespectful to the Grand Duke Evron, right?\u201d\u201cI haven\u2019t even seen him. When the butler informed him that Tia had gone to the ball at Count Enda\u2019s estate, he went over there.\u201d\u201cI understand. If he comes back, don\u2019t interfere. Stay out of it. I\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cMother, Grand Duke Evron is a man of integrity. It\u2019s been a while since Tia did anything useful, but if someone like you interferes, it\u2019ll all be ruined.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201dMiraila reacted startled. Lawrence said coldly.\u201cMother, the Grand Duke despises you. You talk as if you don\u2019t know that. And unfortunately, he despises me, too. For that very reason, my father has not been able to trust me with the seat of the Crown Prince.\u201dThe hidden meaning in his words was obvious. Miraila\u2019s face turned pale.However, she did nothing.With Artizea, she acted like the greatest tyrant in the world. But with her son, she was an understanding and submissive mother.***Marcus hesitated bitterly for a long time when she asked him to return to the Marquisate Rosan and help her.Although he had accepted Artizea as the heir apparent, returning to the Marquisate Rosan was another matter.\u300cI will marry soon, and I will retrieve the Marquisate Rosan from my mother\u2019s clutches. I\u2019ll need Mr. Hanson then.\u300dIt had been almost 18 years since he had last been to the Marquisate Rosan.Currently, all employees of the Marquisate Rosan in relevant positions, serve Miraila.the estate of the Marquisate Rosan was large and its wealth enormous. It would be difficult to fight them all at once.\u300cI want to prevent the Rosan Family\u2019s assets from being stolen and get it all back. Mr. Hanson, you know all about the Marquisate Rosan. Besides, you know most of the former employees, right?\u300d\u300cWell, that\u2019s true, but\u2026\u300d\u300cSo I don\u2019t think it\u2019s difficult for you to understand and control the situation. It would be even better if the entire Hanson Family could come and help. Please, return to your rightful position and help me.\u300d\u300cBut my family has been accused of poisoning the direct descendants of the Marquess Rosan, so how can we return?\u300d\u300cIt was 18 years ago. Right now, poisoning has become a thing of the past. His Majesty intervened to clarify the situation, but the real culprit could not be identified.\u300dArtizea continued.\u300cMy mother tried to incriminate the Hanson Family, but not only did she have no evidence, but no one believed her. So she thought, it would be better to leave it at that.\u300d\u300cHeir apparent\u2026\u300d\u300cAnyway, I\u2019ll make sure that incident doesn\u2019t affect you.\u300dIt was a great incident, since it had caused the Rosan Family to be exterminated. The fact that the perpetrator had not been identified was very burdensome for the Emperor.\u300cIn case this incident comes out again, this time, as the successor, I will be by your side, so let\u2019s fight together until the end. If you are still worried, you can change your name and hide your identity until everything is resolved.\u300d\u300cI lived in the manor house of the Marquisate Rosan for 60 years, of which 45 years I served at master Michael\u2019s side. Not only employees, but many of the aristocrats know about it.\u300d\u300cWhy not do the same thing my mother did? It was because everyone was blindfolded that she managed not to be convicted of the poisoning incident.\u300dArtizea spoke with dignity.\u300cI will become the Marchioness Rosan, Mr. Hanson. As sole heir, I can handle matters relating to the Marquisate Rosan at my discretion. As long as Mr. Hanson is willing to return, I will take care of the rest of the problems.\u300dHowever, Marcus could not immediately nod his head. The wound was too deep.But he didn\u2019t shake his head either.Back in the carriage, Cedric was the first to speak.\u201cI am amazed, Lady Artizea.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201cThe best way to reach a person\u2019s heart is to move it, right? Lady Artizea, although you are still young, you seem to know this very well.\u201cI did not intend to move Mr. Hanson. I was just trying to give him a valid excuse.\u201d\u201cAn excuse?\u201d\u201cMr. Hanson is struggling to make ends meet. He also has his 14-year-old granddaughter in his care. I\u2019m sure he must have wanted to get out of Reve Street for a while now. But without a suitable excuse, he would not take my hand.\u201dSaid Artizea. And she apologized for that.Cedric chuckled. Artizea blushed slightly.\u201cWhy are you chuckling?\u201d\u201cLady Artizea seems to consider herself as a villainess.\u201d\u201c\u2026Because it\u2019s true.\u201dFor Artizea, that was as true as the morning sunrise.\u201cAnyone who remembers honorable moments would want to escape disgrace. And that can only be determined by oneself. Lady Artizea, you did not give Hanson an excuse, you only made him remember honorable moments. So he will return for you.\u201d\u201cFor me?\u201d\u201cYes. Because he loves the Marquisate Rosan, and you are the only heir.\u201d\u201cHowever, I am not Michael\u2019s biological daughter.\u201d\u201cHe used to be the head butler, so he probably knows who your biological father is. You are a direct descendant of the Marquess Rosan. Otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t have accepted you.\u201d\u201cI see. I never thought of it that way.\u201dCedric asked.\u201cAren\u2019t you curious to know who your father is?\u201d\u201cNo, there\u2019s no point in knowing. Whoever my biological father is, at first glance, is an immoral person who committed adultery with the wife of the Marquess Rosan. But more than that, he\u2019s an idiot who slept with the Emperor\u2019s concubine.\u201dArtizea said, biting her lips.When the wheels of the carriage began to move, the vibrations of the rattle were transmitted to their bodies.Then Artizea was silent, and Cedric said nothing either.There was only silence inside the carriage until it reached the front of the manor house of the Marquisate Rosan.Once again, Cedric got out first and helped Artizea.Artizea bowed her head to him.\u201cYour Grace, thank you for escorting me. If it were not for you, Mr. Hanson would not have trusted me. He would have thought that Miraila\u2019s daughter had gone to plot against him.\u201d\u201cYou are welcome. I understand well the importance of today\u2019s meeting, for Lady Artizea and the Marquisate Rosan. I am grateful that you have invited me and allowed me to be present. If you need anything else, please don\u2019t hesitate to let me know.\u201d\u201cIf you say that, I\u2019ll really feel free to ask him for anything. Even though I have no power, no wealth, no people right now.\u201d\u201cBut you have this, right?\u201dCedric tapped his temple with his index finger.Artizea smiled.\u201cFrom now on I\u2019ll have to show you whether it\u2019s really useful or not.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m counting on it.\u201dThat\u2019s when Cedric\u2019s squire appeared, leading a horse by the reins.Bill was following the squire in a hurry. He had left by order of Lawrence.\u201cWelcome, Your Grace. How was your outing, miss?\u201dArtizea tilted her head and looked at Bill.Bill had spoken nervously.He didn\u2019t think Cedric would listen to him, since he\u2019d made him angry earlier.However, Lawrence was strict when he gave an order, so he had no choice but to convey his message.\u201cYour Grace, young master Lawrence has told me that he would like to invite you to dinner.\u201dCedric narrowed his eyes as he looked at Bill, putting on the riding gloves his squire had given him.He wanted to rebuke him again, but in the end he decided not to.\u201cIt will be another time. Unless, Lady Artizea invites me.\u201dArtizea smiled.\u201cAs an unmarried woman, I am a little reluctant to invite a man who is not a relative into my home at this hour.\u201d\u201cI knew you\u2019d say that. Then I apologize. Next time I\u2019ll visit you with Olga\u2019s Heart.\u201dCedric bade farewell with a deep bow. Artizea also bowed politely to him.As Cedric mounted his horse to leave, Artizea called out to him when a sudden thought crossed her mind.\u201cOh, now that I think about it, can I ask you something?\u201d\u201cGo ahead.\u201d\u201cWhy do you act so formally with me? The other day, you weren\u2019t acting that way.\u201dArtizea gazed up at Cedric.Cedric thought her turquoise eyes were bright and deep, rich in colour.\u201cI must respect you, not because you are Miraila\u2019s daughter, but because you will be my future wife.\u201dCedric said and turned on his horse.Artizea lowered her head, feeling her whole face blush.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 19": "Chapter 19Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 19Translator: GoldWhich relationship is more distant, a relationship with a stranger or a relationship with a senior?Artizea thought about this every time she had a chance to have a conversation with Lawrence.Her relationship with Miraila was like a relationship between strangers. And her relationship with Lawrence was like a relationship with a senior.From childhood, the relationship between the two had been formed by Artizea\u2019s one-sided desire.By the time Artizea began to understand the world, Lawrence was already the happiest and highest status child in the Empire.He still knew nothing about issues such as illegitimate children, inheritance or succession. He also didn\u2019t care about the people around him.Even once, he sat on the Emperor\u2019s lap and played a joke on him by taking away his crown.In Artizea\u2019s eyes, Lawrence was the most enviable person in the world.She did not yet know the difference between her and her brother. So, she thought that if her brother was loved, it was as if she was loved too.And she loved Lawrence like her mother did.\u300cIf your brother\u2019s doing well, you\u2019ll do well too.\u300dBack then, she really believed in those words.Even when she grew up, she kept using those words as a guide in her life.She convinced herself of it, justifying it with the fact that being the sister of the next Emperor would be beneficial. And that because they were related by blood, she had to make Lawrence the next Emperor anyway to survive.But it wasn\u2019t the same. As a little girl, she genuinely believed in those words.She thought that love was mutual.However, Lawrence never cared for Artizea.Now that she thought about it, it was only natural. Why would he care about her?Miraila\u2019s love and attention was only for her son. Besides, she didn\u2019t teach him to be a real older brother either.In childhood, Lawrence acted like Artizea didn\u2019t exist. As they grew older, they sometimes ate or drank tea together, but only had formal conversations.The times Miraila would beat Artizea, he would calmly observe.Occasionally, he would offer her words of comfort while she cried.\u300cMother doesn\u2019t do it because she hates you.\u300d\u2018What would it be like if I were a stranger?\u2019While she was thinking about it, Artizea went to see Lawrence.After Cedric left, Lawrence sent for her and she didn\u2019t have time to change her clothes.Artizea adjusted the dress she was about to take off, then with her hair pulled up in a hairnet and slippers, she headed to Lawrence\u2019s study.Lawrence was impatient, so she had to rush.\u201cWelcome, Tia.\u201dLawrence greeted her coldly. More than angry with Artizea, he didn\u2019t seem to be in a very good mood.Artizea greeted him politely and asked him,\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d\u201cI heard you went out with the Grand Duke Evron.\u201d\u201cAh, yes. You probably heard it from the butler. We met at Count Enda\u2019s estate, and then went for a little walk together.\u201dA family that really cared about an 18-year-old girl would have to question the fact that she went out alone with a strange man without saying where she was going.However, Lawrence didn\u2019t care what Artizea did with her personal life.He wasn\u2019t cautious of her either. The current Lawrence, did not know the true face of Artizea.The incident with Countess Eunice, the reason she had been considered \u2018something useful\u2019 in her past life, had not developed in the same way this time.Instead of being used as a tool to carry out schemes, this time she could be used as a tool in a marriage of convenience.Although she thought and planned to do so, Artizea got goosebumps from Lawrence\u2019s soulless look at her.She smiled bitterly in her mind.In the past, 18-year-old Artizea would jump for joy when Lawrence looked at her that way.She thought she was being praised. She felt she was being useful.But now she had a different idea.\u2018If one looks at one\u2019s subordinates in that way, one will not get their loyalty.\u2019Unless one was a slow person and unable to read people\u2019s expressions, who would be loyal to someone who doesn\u2019t value one?There are many reasons why a person follows someone. Money, power, hope, relationships and many more.Lawrence had almost all of them.Most of his followers sought to become worthy subjects of the next Emperor and receive rewards for it.Also the enemies of the Grand Duke Roygar, supported Lawrence, with the purpose of preventing the Grand Duke Roygar from becoming the Emperor.Of course, in a sense, they expected something in return.Only a few people followed him without expecting something in return.However, they did not do it for him, those were people loyal to Emperor Gregor, who understood the Emperor\u2019s wishes and took care of his favorite son.\u2018Even me.\u2019Artizea had been no exception.She also expected something in return. She expected the love of her family.But, for someone to become a true monarch, more than that was needed.It was necessary to have at least some loyal subjects, who were willing to give their lives selflessly. Only they could act in critical moments without regard to consequences.And such loyalty could not be obtained by those who considered others merely a tool.In case one wanted to share one\u2019s true feelings, one should at least hide one\u2019s contempt for the other person.Lawrence did neither. In that sense, Roygar was much better.Artizea could not help but smile.Lawrence spoke, without even imagining what she was thinking.\u201cI would have liked you to invite him home.\u201d\u201cI have heard that he is in a military camp outside the capital. It is difficult to cross the forest paths when the sun sets completely, so I thought it would be better if he returned as soon as possible.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dLawrence seemed to think for a moment.\u201cAre you going to meet him again?\u201d\u201c\u2026Can\u2019t I?\u201dArtizea deliberately asked carefully.From Lawrence\u2019s attitude, it seemed that someone had already advised him on the benefits of a marriage of convenience between her and Cedric.Lawrence disliked Cedric. However, probably because of the benefits he could get, he had wanted to invite him home.Lawrence shook his head.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing you can\u2019t do. You\u2019re 18 now.\u201d\u201cThank you, brother. \u201d\u201cYou should invite him home next time. Grand Duke Evron rarely stays in the capital, and even when he stays, he doesn\u2019t usually attend social events, so we haven\u2019t had a chance to get acquainted.\u201d\u201cYes, brother.\u201dLawrence nodded his head when Artizea responded obediently. Then, he gestured for her to leave.Artizea said cautiously.\u201cBefore I leave, I have a favor to ask you, brother.\u201d\u201cTell me.\u201dLawrence spoke with indifference.\u201cI would like to hire some servants and maids. To take care of me personally. It\u2019s a little uncomfortable for me to be away from home, since I only have one person at the moment.\u201d\u201cOne?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dFor the first time, Lawrence showed a puzzled face.Artizea smiled.Lawrence was not related to that, so it was not strange that he did not know.\u201cI will talk to my mother.\u201d\u201cDo you need our mother\u2019s help for this? Besides, brother, you know\u2026 her too. Our mother is busy.\u201dLawrence understood perfectly what she meant by Miraila being \u2018busy\u2019. And he nodded his head.\u201cYou are right. Take care of it yourself. And if my mother says anything, let me know.\u201d\u201cYes. Thank you, brother.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s my duty as a older brother.\u201dAlthough the resources of the Marquisate Rosan were used to hire the employees, Lawrence had spoken without shame, as if he were being condescending.\u201cArgh!\u201dAt that moment, Miraila could be heard screaming in the distance.Artizea was startled. Seeing this, Lawrence said coldly.\u201cShe is hysterical. It\u2019s not a day or two thing. You don\u2019t need to concern yourself with that.\u201d\u201cAll right.\u201d\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be convenient if Grand Duke Evron noticed a bruise on your face or somewhere else.\u201d\u201cI understand\u2026\u201dAfter that, Artizea retired.She then went to Miraila\u2019s room.Miraila kept screaming loudly, unable to control her anger. One could also hear the sound of something breaking and the wailing of a maid being beaten.Miraila would occasionally get angry in this way, beating people and destroying the rooms.In the past, Artizea tried to calm Miraila in these moments.The anger was not good for health. She wanted to hug Miraila. She thought that by doing so, Miraila would calm down a bit. However, the only thing she got was for Miraila to beat her worse than usual.Artizea stopped for a moment in front of the door.The other maids looked at Artizea, holding their breath.Once Artizea entered the room, Miraila would direct your attention to her and she would not see anyone else.Therefore, the maids begged wholeheartedly for this to happen.However, Artizea turned around.A maid stopped her.\u201cMiss, aren\u2019t you going in?\u201d\u201cDo you think I should go in and be beaten instead?\u201d\u201cOh, no, I didn\u2019t mean that\u2026\u201d\u201cYou better get that girl out of there before the situation gets worse.\u201d\u201cB-But, miss. If I do that\u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not the only maid here, right? If you all take the beating, your injuries won\u2019t be as serious. I will cover the medical expenses and give you generous compensation. I will even let you take a break from your work until you recover. After that, tell that girl to come and see me.\u201dThe maids gulped. This time, they knew that Artizea would not be the scapegoat.Artizea suddenly remembered what Cedric had told her in the past.\u300cMiraila is dead. I heard that she was still scolding Lawrence on the subject of women.\u300dWas Miraila resentful of Lawrence when she died?Had she ever imagined that Lawrence would kill her? Did she still love him despite his actions?Or had she simply turned a blind eye to reality until the end?Had she repented at the time of her death, even a little, having mistreated Artizea?Artizea had tried to protect her to the end. Had she regretted losing that shield?Or had she even considered it?Now it was irrelevant that she still thought about it. That was in the past.Artizea again turned around and left.Even in blood relations, as between mother and daughter, there were limits. Besides, Miraila had never taken her hand before.Artizea now realized that she could really leave her mother.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Then Ansgar answered calmly.\u201cThe Fischer Family collapsed 18 years ago. The Viscount and Viscountess committed suicide by poisoning themselves, and their relatives, including their children, disappeared. It is virtually destroyed.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dCedric became surprised and laid down his cup of tea.Taken aback, he changed his posture, no longer resting comfortably in the chair.Ansgar then said,\u201cAt the time of their destruction, Viscountess Fischer was Her Majesty\u2019s lady-in-waiting. She was also a childhood friend of the Empress. Because of her low status, she could not become the head lady-in-waiting, but she was Her Majesty\u2019s most trusted person.\u201cSo, why did she commit suicide?\u201d\u201cShe assumed responsibility for the death of the two princes. Because she was in charge of taking care of them.\u201dCedric gulped.He had not thought deeply about it until he had returned.Although he felt there must have been some reason for Artizea to make this request, he had thought that after meeting Viscount Fischer and buying the jewel, that would be the end of it.\u201cDidn\u2019t one of the princes die of smallpox?\u201d\u201cYes, that is true. But someone needed to take responsibility. The princess was the first to die, and a year later, both princes died. Then, as you know, rumors began to spread that it was a curse\u2026\u201d\u201cYes, I know that.\u201dAlthough this was an incident that had occurred during his childhood, Cedric also remembered it because at that time his family was reinstated to its original position.\u201cDid Her Majesty force her to commit suicide?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think so. But there must have been pressure.\u201dAnsgar said.\u201cEveryone knows that the Empress must have been very resentful of the Emperor for what happened.\u201d\u201cDo you mean that the Empress was so resentful of losing her children, that the Emperor kept her under control for fear that she would pose a threat? Come to think of it, not long after that, Her Majesty\u2019s Family fell.\u201d\u201cThere is no evidence that this was the Emperor\u2019s doing. It was only a rumor that was circulating at the time.\u201dAnsgar continued.\u201cBut there was a harsh criticism that someone had to take responsibility. But no one could hold the Emperor responsible, nor attack the Empress directly. So, perhaps to protect Her Majesty, Viscountess Fischer gave her life.\u201d\u201cBut it is strange that the whole family has dispersed and disappeared, even though no crime had been proven.\u201d\u201cYes, there are other suspicions.\u201dIt could have been a murder.Or it could be a larger plot than Cedric could ever imagine.Cedric, who had met with Marcus Hanson today, could not help but sigh deeply.He wondered if this was the reason why the Emperor had pardoned Miraila.With the death of all the Empress\u2019 children, the Emperor had lost his rightful successors to the throne.He only had his illegitimate children left. The mothers of his two daughters had too low a status. And then there was Lawrence, whom the Emperor loved more than anyone else.The loss of his children could have made him feel lonely and depressed, causing him to lean on Miraila again.\u201cIs there any possibility of finding a descendant of the Fischer Family?\u201dCedric asked, reclining on his chair again and interlacing his fingers. Ansgar hesitated.\u201cI can\u2019t say for sure, but we can try.\u201d\u201cI think we could ask around.\u201d\u2018Maybe this is what Artizea wanted me to do,\u2019 thought Cedric.Ansgar then stated,\u201cMy duty is to serve you, but why the sudden interest in the Fischer Family?\u201d\u201cI heard that the heirloom of the Viscounty Fischer is a jewel called Saintess Olga\u2019s Heart.\u201d\u201cYes. That\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cI need it. But with the Fischer Family in that situation, I don\u2019t know when I\u2019ll get it.\u201dCedric sighed.He had told Artizea that he would give her Saintess Olga\u2019s Heart at their next meeting, but now he didn\u2019t know when he could see her again.He realized that he was already looking forward to the next meeting. At that point, he sighed again.\u201cYou should go and check it out, after all, it\u2019s a jewel.\u201d\u201cHow?\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s a jewel you\u2019re looking for, wouldn\u2019t it be quicker to ask a jeweler? Eighteen years have passed. It\u2019s very likely that it\u2019s currently on the market. Also, rumor has it that most of the Fischer Family\u2019s assets were sold back then to finance the escape.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dAs soon as Cedric got up from his chair, Ansgar laughed.\u201cIt is midnight, Lord Cedric. You don\u2019t plan to go to the jewelry store in the capital at this hour, do you?\u201d\u201cOf course not.\u201dCedric, who had risen slightly from his chair when he felt inexplicably excited, sat down again.Ansgar smiled and took Cedric\u2019s empty teacup.\u201cBy the way, Ansgar.\u201dCedric asked.\u201cHow can I present garments as a gift to a lady?\u201dHowever, Ansgar could not help but laugh slightly.Cedric said firmly.\u201cIt\u2019s not what you\u2019re imagining.\u201d\u201cYes, I understand.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s really nothing.\u201d\u201cYes, yes.\u201dDespite Ansgar\u2019s answer, Cedric stamped his foot in discomfort.***After that day, the Marquisate Rosan was enveloped in a dark atmosphere.Miraila, who had wrecked her room, beaten her maids and made a fuss all night felt so weak that she did not have the strength to go out the next day and remained lying in her bed.Her temperature had risen, and her throat had become inflamed from screaming too loudly.Like an obedient daughter, Artizea sat beside her, giving her hot lemon tea with a spoon.Then, Miraila spoke in a hoarse voice,\u201cNow that you\u2019re grown up, would you rather pretend that last night you didn\u2019t notice your mother angry?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like that. My brother called me and we talked for a while.\u201dArtizea responded obediently.\u201cI would never turn a blind eye to mother\u2019s condition.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s true. When I grow old, the only person I will be able to trust will be my daughter. I live for you.\u201dMiraila hugged Artizea with a smile, as she sometimes did when she was in a good mood.\u201cIf you are not feeling very well, why don\u2019t you go with His Majesty to the detached palace?\u201dDetached palace?\u201cIt has been very hot lately. Maybe it\u2019s the best time to go to the Detached Palace. Moreover, the sea is right beside it.\u201dMiraila\u2019s eyes glittered.\u201cWe should go on vacation. Do you think Lawrence would have time?\u201d\u201cIf my brother is busy, you two should go alone. That way, you would have a more intimate trip.Even if Lawrence didn\u2019t go, it was a trip with the Emperor, so it wouldn\u2019t be really intimate.However, these words seemed to improve Miraila\u2019s mood, and she giggled even with her sore throat.The Emperor gladly accepted Miraila\u2019s request.The trip was organized, and the plans was executed with unprecedented speed.Artizea thought that the Emperor was doing this to stall for time. And she was right.At this point, the Emperor was probably contemplating on whether or not to allow the ceremony of the triumphant return of the Western Army.He had been postponing the issue of the Western Army for a long time. He had refused, giving one excuse after another, but if he were to give his consent now for the sake of Lawrence, it would be somewhat embarrassing. Now that Cedric had entered the capital, he could no longer postpone his decision.In this situation, Miraila\u2019s request represented the perfect excuse to stall for time.The Emperor would spend the next few weeks observing Cedric\u2019s attitude before coming to a decision.Although this would allow him to continue delaying his decision, he could be accused of neglecting his responsibilities.On the other hand, if the demands made were not met, criticism would fall on the government.In any case, public opinion would be directed in that direction.This was also a good thing for Artizea and Cedric. Artizea now had a few weeks to do what she wanted.And in the afternoon of the first day.Three loaded carriages arrived at the manor house. Countless garments, mannequins and boxes were being unloaded.Butler Bill\u2019s eyes were opened wide. This was not unusual. It always happened when Miraila bought clothes.However, now Miraila was not here.Emily, the owner of a renowned boutique, smiled happily at Bill as she got out of the carriage.She was the dressmaker who made the most stylish, exclusive and expensive dresses in the capital.And Miraila was a regular customer.\u201cHello, Mr. Butler.\u201d\u201cWhat brings you to this place? Madam went on vacation with His Majesty to the Detached Palace. I thought you knew, Emily.\u201d\u201cI am not here today for madam, but for her daughter.\u201d\u201cYou mean Miss Artizea?\u201d\u201cYes. His Grace the Grand Duke Evron sent me. Oh, by the way, the times I\u2019ve seen her I\u2019ve noticed her outfit, and I\u2019ve always regretted not being able to do anything to make her look better, only with that she would be as beautiful as her mother. However, today I am here to enhance her beauty, he told me that I could do \u2018whatever I wanted\u2019.\u201dEmily laughed out loud.She knew Artizea\u2019s situation very well.Even if it was only a change of weather, Miraila was buying dozens of clothes.There were some things the Emperor gave her, but there were also many things she bought herself. From silver and gold embroidery, to Eon embroidery which was the most expensive. She bought the most precious materials in the whole empire, and she had to have all the new designs to be satisfied.Perhaps not even the Empress could match her in terms of clothing.But during Miraila\u2019s shopping sprees, Emily never once saw her buy even a single ribbon for Artizea.Holding a good eye, Emily had noticed that the price of a dress from Artizea was equivalent to only one of Miraila\u2019s scarves.Her dresses probably didn\u2019t fit her short, because at her age one didn\u2019t grow that much anymore.Bill\u2019s eyes were still wide open.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Her employees followed her with different garments and mannequins.It was then that Bill decided to stop Emily, but when he saw the last man who entered, he shuddered and kept his mouth shut.At first glance, one could tell he was a knight. Not even his clothes could hide his great physique and well-developed muscles.The clothes he wore were rugged and simple. But he emanated dignity and composure. Moreover, he wore a sword on his waist.The four squires who followed him were also armed.Bill belonged to the lower class. He would not dare to pounce on an armed man, especially if he was a knight.He was more afraid of the knights who were used to killing than of the nobles who opposed Miraila.\u201cWelcome!\u201dAlice came cheerfully running to greet Emily.When the head maid saw Alice welcoming Emily, ignoring both her and the butler, she lashed out at her.\u201cAlice!\u201dHowever, the shouts that should have continued did not arrive.Artizea appeared on the stairs and looked down.Emily smiled, gripped her skirt and greeted her politely.\u201cGreetings, Lady Artizea.\u201d\u201cWelcome, Madam Emily. I don\u2019t recall calling you, what brings you here?\u201d\u201cHis Grace the Grand Duke Evron sent me.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dArtizea responded after a brief silence.\u201cSophie, accompany madam to my boudoir.\u201d\u201cYes, Miss!\u201dEntranced, Sophie, who was standing behind Artizea, ran down the stairs.Sophie gently took Emily by the arm and guided her to the second floor, as if she were an aunt she hadn\u2019t seen in 30 years. Her employees also went up behind her.The maids whispered as they watched the scene.This time, Artizea turned her attention to the knight, who was also standing in the foyer.The knight put his fist to the side of his chest and bowed his head politely.Artizea went down to the foyer and stood in front of the knight. Then the knight knelt on one knee and greeted her.\u201cI am knight Alphonse Luen. I was knighted by Grand Duke Evron and have served in the Grand Duchy\u2019s Guard until now. It is an honor to meet you.\u201d\u201cIt is a pleasure to meet you as well. I am Artizea Rosan. You may rise.\u201dWhen she extended her hand, Alphonse respectfully kissed the back of it and then stood up.\u201cOnly if you allow, I will escort you from today onwards on orders from His Grace.\u201d\u201cI will be grateful. I hope you can feel comfortable in the Marquisate Rosan.\u201dArtizea calmly expressed.However, inside she felt strange.Alphonse was one of the Grand Duke Evron\u2019s most capable and reliable knights.He was honest and without a doubt loyal. He had the strong spirit of the Grand Duchy Evron.The fact that Cedric placed this man as her escort made Artizea feel uncomfortable.If he had chosen Knight Freyl or any other knight of similar rank, she would not have felt that way.With any other escort, she would have thought he had come to observe and evaluate whether or not this marriage would really be useful.And that would be the norm.But that he sent Alphonse proved otherwise.To have sent him meant that Cedric was only thinking of protecting Artizea. That made her feel strange.In the past, Cedric had entrusted Alphonse with the role of protecting Licia. Alphonse did his duty to the end.He had died at the hands of Lawrence.There was no need to think about it now. Artizea shook her head faintly to clear her mind.Then she looked carefully at the people standing behind Alphonse.Among those people, there was a familiar face \u2013 a woman dressed in maid\u2019s clothes, her head bowed behind the squires.It was Lise Hanson. Marcus\u2019 granddaughter.\u201cSir Alphonse, did His Grace mention anything else?\u201d\u201cI have been His Grace\u2019s sword until now, but he had asked me to become Lady Artizea\u2019s shield henceforth.\u201dAlphonse slowly declared.A shield is a weapon that protects the inside from the outside, but at the same time attacks the outside from the inside. It can be used not only as a support weapon for the attack, but also as a decent offensive weapon within a limited range.Moreover, weapons do not think for themselves. Alphonse would follow the wielder\u2019s orders.Artizea fully understood the implications of this. Cedric must have thought of all this.Moreover, the arrival of Lise Hanson meant that Marcus had made up his mind. In that case, there was no need to hesitate.She called Bill, who was watching her.\u201cBill.\u201dBill lowered his head hurriedly. Artizea told him.\u201cPrepare a room for Sir Alphonse. I would like him to be in the same corridor as my room, and for the squires, it will be better to prepare rooms for two people, in an annex. You can let Alice take care of the maid.\u201d\u201cA small space where they can lay down is sufficient. These guys can sleep well in a stable.\u201dAlphonse said. Artizea smiled.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. There are still plenty of rooms available. Even if it\u2019s not for long, I hope you\u2019ll feel comfortable in a strange house.\u201dBill didn\u2019t seem to think so. He smiled and said, with a troubled face.\u201cBut miss, preparing rooms without the permission of madam or the young master would be problematic\u2026\u201d\u201cBill.\u201dShe knew Bill would say that. For that reason, she took the opportunity to speak in front of people.Artizea deliberately lowered her voice, making it further sound frigid.Bill was even more surprised to see that Alphonse had a more severe expression than Artizea.The boutique employees also looked at the scene with rigid faces. Even Emily turned around and looked at the scene, instead of going to the boudoir.An icy atmosphere descended on the foyer. Artizea asked in a deliberately soft voice.\u201cBill, can you tell me who I am?\u201d\u201cWell, miss\u2026\u201dBill sounded embarrassed.The servants and maids of this estate were under his control. However, without Miraila\u2019s instructions he could not physically coerce her daughter.Even more so in front of Grand Duke Evron\u2019s knight and Madam Emily, a woman with many connections.\u201cThere is no need to make a scene, let\u2019s go inside and talk. This is a private matter, right?\u201dBill was trying to calm Artizea and extended his hand to pull her arm.Just then, Alphonse hit him with his sheathed sword in his arm.\u201cOw!\u201dHe screamed and took a step back as he felt a terrible pain in his arm.When the knight stepped forward, two of his squires also came forward and twisted Bill\u2019s arms to hold him.\u201cOn your knees!\u201dAlice shouted fiercely.Bill was stunned as he knelt on the ground.Artizea bent one knee in a graceful movement to meet his eyes.\u201cBill, this is the second time the Marquisate Rosan has been disgraced by its useless butler in front of Grand Duke Evron.\u201d\u201cMiss\u2026\u201d\u201cOnce can be overlooked. That can happen to anyone. If one neglects his work, one may not even know their master\u2019s whereabouts. But to be useless twice is a disgrace to the family. Sir Alphonse acts as the eyes of His Grace. It is incredulous that you have behaved this way in his presence.\u201dBill rolled his eyes. Cold sweat began to form on his back.Artizea asked again.\u201cBill, can you tell me who I am?\u201cMiss\u2026\u201d*Slap!*Alice slapped him hard on the cheek.\u201cMiss! If madam finds out about this, Argh!\u201dAlice slapped him again.His eyes turned red, not from the pain, but from the shock.He had never imagined that something like this could happen.The situation might seem ridiculous, of course, from the perspective of Miraila and her followers. But the person in front of Bill was the future Marchioness Rosan, and he was no more than a commoner.Besides, Miraila was not present, nor was Lawrence. And they would not return for the time being.Bill realized that Artizea had enough time to deal with him.Alice slapped him on the cheek once more.\u201cWhat of it if madam finds out?\u201d Do you mean to say that our miss will be beaten this way?It depended on Miraila\u2019s mood, however, that was probably what would happen.But Lawrence was different.He took honor very seriously, and he would not tolerate that Artizea had made a scene in front of the knight of the Grand Duke Evron, no matter what punishment Miraila imposed on her.And even if Miraila later became angry with Artizea, it did not mean that Bill was safe at this time.Finally, he responded by shivering.\u201cH-heir apparent\u2026\u201dArtizea smiled. Her smile looked completely different than before.The squires released Bill\u2019s arms.\u201cBill, prepare accommodations for Sir Alphonse and the squires. When you have finished, come to my room with the key and the account books.\u201d\u201cEh, the key?\u201d\u201cHaven\u2019t you understood? I mean the key to the safe. Jacob.\u201dArtizea called Jacob, the dejected assistant butler, whose shoulder was hunched in the corner.\u201cGo to Bill and help me with that.\u201d\u201cYes, yes!\u201d\u201cDo you really understand the meaning of Lady Artizea\u2019s words?\u201dAlice inquired sharply.Although Jacob was tired of being treated like a nobody, he nodded obediently. Then, when he turned around, his shoulders rose as high as possible.If she were to take the key away from Bill, then Jacob, as assistant butler, could be left in charge. And from his attitude, he seemed to have realized this opportunity.Artizea then ordered Alice,\u201cAlice, go and help that young maid.\u201d\u201cI want to see your new garments too\u2026 \u201d\u201cWho else could I trust but you?\u201dAlice stuck out her tongue and said, \u201cAll right, I will.\u201d Then she laughed.When Artizea turned around, Emily and her employees dispersed quickly as if they had not been looking.Alphonse followed her silently.Stopping at the door of the glamorous boudoir, her expression completely different from that of a few moments ago, Artizea stated,\u201cMy apologies. You saw a horrible image of me as soon as you arrived.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dAlphonse responded with courtesy.\u201cLady, you don\u2019t have to worry about your image in my presence. His Grace has told us that you are in a very complicated position within this family, and that although you seem to be acting incomprehensibly, there must be a reason for it, so we must not doubt you.\u201d\u201cHis Grace\u2026\u201dArtizea said, feeling strange.Even Lawrence, to whom she had been loyal all her past life, had never trusted her in this way.More than garments, he sent her confidence and strength.Now she could take the next step.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Sipping the tea that the jeweler had given him beforehand, he calmly inquired,\u201cI was told that I should come to this place if I wanted to know about a jewel and of who its current owner is.\u201d\u201cAre you interested in a particular jewel?\u201dThe jeweler asked curiously.\u201cI am looking for a jewel called \u2018Saintess Olga\u2019s Heart\u2019.\u201d\u201cYou mean the diamond that was the heirloom of the Viscounty Fischer?\u201dSo it was a diamond. It was something Cedric had just found out. At first, he had thought it had been a ruby, as it was referred to as a \u2018Heart\u2019.\u201cYes, I\u2019m looking for the heirloom of the Viscounty of Fischer.\u201dThe jeweler looked like he had been put in an awkward situation. Cedric, noticing his expression, asked him assertively.\u201cIs it that you don\u2019t you know anything about it, or just something difficult to divulge?\u201dJewels were used as a means of doing secret business and accumulating wealth.Compared to diamonds and sapphires, gold was the most common means for these types of transactions as it was easier to hide its origin.However, historical and renowned jewels were also very useful means.Especially if it was a question of bribes. This was because historical jewels have a value beyond mere wealth.Moreover, this jewel came from a family that had been destroyed when the Viscountess and the Viscount decided to commit suicide for the Empress\u2019 sake.Some would like to have their belongings as trophies, and others would like to keep the belongings of their comrades.On the other hand, even if a jewel was not obtained for a wicked purpose, it could have been obtained illegally. Especially if it was a jewel considered an heirloom.\u201cI\u2019m not making inquiries; I just want to buy it.\u201dHearing this, the jeweler gave a small sigh.\u201cI understand. For now, I will write a letter to the person who owns the jewel. This could be a good thing. A man like Your Grace has taken an interest.\u201dThe jeweler stood up, asking him to wait for a moment.Cedric stood up and looked around the jewelry store while the jeweler wrote the letter of introduction.The reception room to which he was led was the place where distinguished guests were received.A part of Odorov\u2019s store collection of jewels was on display as decoration.On a wall shelf, Cedric saw a pair of cufflinks and a gold watch.Although he didn\u2019t know much about jewelry, a diamond necklace and bracelet that looked very expensive caught his eye.On impulse, Cedric lifted the bracelet.The bracelet looked very unusual. The bracelet, made of two strips of small diamonds, as if it were a simple beaded bracelet, glimmered under the light in five different colors.The jeweler soon returned with a wax-sealed envelope.Cedric placed the bracelet on the table with a firmer face than usual.\u201cNow that you have provided me with the information, you must accept that I buy at least one item.\u201d\u201cAh! You mean this one? Thank you very much.\u201dThe jeweler, who was not expecting it, quickly bowed his head, his eyes beaming.Freyl, who until then had been waiting for his master to finish this matter, stood by the door in silence, with a bored expression.Cedric knew, but pretended not to.***The jeweler told her to go to the house of a man named White.A man who had owned a small jewelry store.\u300cHe was a trustworthy man who had a good eye. If things had gone well, he would have been a renowned jeweler today\u2026\u300d\u300cDid he leave it?\u300d\u300cIn business, sometimes certain investments can seem like a gamble.\u300d\u300cThat\u2019s true, because the risks and the benefits are proportional to each other.\u300d\u300cYes, but when the risk is greater than expected, no matter how prepared one is to face it, it is not possible to overcome it. What White experienced was like being in a barn doing fire prevention maneuvers, only to end up being hit by a tsunami.\u300dOdorov told him nothing else.Thinking he was close to solving a riddle, Cedric headed to White\u2019s house along with Freyl. Freyl grumbled,\u201cThis is too much.\u201d\u201cIs it too much to ask that you come with me?\u201d\u201cYour Grace, have you really decided to marry Miraila\u2019s daughter?\u201dCedric looked at him seriously and answered,\u201cI thought you agreed with me.\u201d\u201cNo, I know you are doing this for the Western Army.\u201d\u201cBut didn\u2019t you say it was a good strategy?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not because I don\u2019t think it will work. I just wonder if it\u2019s worth sacrificing your happiness for.\u201dFreyl chose his words correctly.Cedric ignored him and waved the reins so his horse would go faster. However, Freyl quickly caught up with him on his horse.Then he stated in all seriousness,\u201cYour Grace, in any case she is Miraila\u2019s daughter, don\u2019t you think it\u2019s a little strange?\u201cAre you questioning my judgment?\u201d\u201cEh?\u201d\u201cYou are implying that I am not capable of judging clearly whether Lady Artizea is a different person from Miraila or not.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dCedric said this even though he knew Freyl didn\u2019t think that way. Then Freyl shook his head,\u201cIt is not that. It\u2019s just that\u2026\u201d\u201cLady Artizea pointed out that it would only be for two years. I don\u2019t think a two-year marriage of convenience is a price that cannot be paid by the Western Army.\u201d\u201cYour Grace, divorcing Miraila\u2019s daughter after a marriage of convenience would be a stain on her honor.\u201dCedric suddenly remembered Artizea\u2019s words and smiled.\u300cYour Grace, you must set aside your honor, so that you may gain the honor of the Western Army and protect the Grand Duchy Evron\u2026 And yet you will throw it all away for personal reasons?\u300dIf Artizea had not said that, he would have considered the offer an insult and would have been furious.\u201cSoldiers must receive the treatment they deserve, and I will not avoid it for fear that my honor will be stained.\u201d\u201cYour Grace.\u201d\u201cAnd that\u2019s what Lady Artizea made me understand.\u201dFreyl said nothing else, and remained silent, wearing a strange expression.\u2018Just because of that?\u2019He was tempted to ask him that question.Besides, if it were a simple marriage of convenience\u2026He could have sent her just a wedding dress. It would have been a good way to make it look like a love marriage and make the Emperor let his guard down.With this in mind, was it really necessary to buy her a jewel?\u2018I don\u2019t think so. However, he doesn\u2019t seem to be aware of it at all\u2026 Will I have to tell him so that he realizes it?\u2019Freyl became distraught.Could Cedric understand this concern? Honestly, he was worried about having to serve Miraila\u2019s daughter as the Grand Duchess for the rest of his life.As he thought about this, they arrived at the address that the jeweler Odorov had given Cedric.Cedric had doubts as he got off his horse. A black cloth was hanging over the front door.It was a sign of mourning.\u201cOh no\u2026\u201dHearing his lament, Freyl said.\u201cI understand your concern, but we should go inside. It\u2019s not like we can take the time to come back another time, right?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201dCedric sighed deeply.Freyl knocked on the door.Out of the gloomy house, carefully opening the door was a young woman who looked to be in her early twenties.\u201cYou look like important people, why have you come to this place? My father has died.\u201dThe girl said with a face of suspicion and exhaustion. There were dark rings around her eyes.Freyl quickly took out the letter of introduction Cedric had given him and handed it to the girl.The girl opened the seal on the spot and read the contents. Then, she looked at Cedric puzzled. Soon after, and in a hurry, she knelt on one knee,\u201cI am honored to meet Your Grace.\u201d\u201cNo. Please do not kneel. There is no need for you to act with such courtesy\u2026\u201d\u201cThank you for your kindness.\u201dThe girl spoke with a polite but tired voice, and then stood up.She led them into the living room.It was already night, so the house was dark. The girl lit a candle to illuminate the place.Then she appeared carrying a tray with three cups of tea, sat down and put it on the table.\u201cI apologize for the lack of hospitality. We don\u2019t even have good tea leaves in our house. But since my father\u2019s soul has not yet left this house, let me give you some tea, so that my father may feel honored and rest in peace.\u201d\u201cIt is us who should apologize for having come at a difficult time.\u201dCedric was not very thirsty, but he drank the tea slowly until the cup was empty. Freyl did the same.\u201cThank you very much. I\u2019m sure my father will be very happy.\u201dThe girl bowed her head and said,\u201cYour Grace, Mr. Odorov\u2019s letter of introduction mentions that you are looking for a jewel. My father passed away, but the ledgers from his days as a jeweler are still intact, so I will try to help you in any way I can.\u201d\u201cI apologize in advance for the inconvenience caused during your mourning. I am looking for a diamond called Saintess Olga\u2019s Heart. Mr. Odorov told me that your father has ownership of that jewel.\u201d*Clink-clink*The woman\u2019s hands trembled. This caused the cup of tea she was holding to shake and make a noise as it hit the saucer.Cedric carefully took the cup of tea from her hand and placed it on the table.The girl stared at him with a pale face. She held not just an angry expression, but also one of disgust and hatred.He just wanted to buy that jewel.But the girl\u2019s face clearly showed that there was a story behind that jewel.\u201cThat jewel is not in our house.\u201d\u201cWho was it sold to?\u201dAfter thinking about it for a moment, the girl got up and went to the study.Her behavior was so unusual that Cedric and Freyl looked at each other.The girl soon returned to the living room with a document envelope.\u201cHere is the contract for the transfer of ownership of Saintess Olga\u2019s Heart.\u201dShe handed the contract to Cedric. The name of the buyer of the jewel in the contract was Baron Yetz.\u201cThis is a promissory note issued by the Baron when the contract was drawn up.\u201dShe also handed him the promissory note. The date on the promissory note indicated that it was made seven years ago.\u201cThe rest are responses to letters my father sent him to pay for the promissory note. My father had been writing letters to him for seven years, but he only received about 10 replies. In all of them, he requested a delay in payment.\u201dThe girl gritted her teeth, then said, \u201cIn the last letter the Baron wrote, \u2018I will pay when I have to. Don\u2019t you trust me?\u2019\u201dIt was clear what had happened. The nobleman had deliberately delayed payment; he was purposely ignoring then.Baron Yetz had practically stolen the diamond by means of a piece of paper signed with his identity. In fact, this was not unusual.After reviewing the contract, Freyl remarked,\u201cAccording to this contract, ownership of the diamond will only be transferred when the promissory note has been paid.\u201d\u201cYes, that condition was put in place to prevent any fraud .\u201d\u201cIf you had sued, you could have won.\u201dThe girl sobbed.\u201cHow could we have done that? That diamond has been given as a present to the Marchioness Camellia.\u201dCedric and Freyl looked at each other again.The Marchioness Camellia was the sister-in-law of the Grand Duke Roygar.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He never thought of economic benefit. Just studying a historical jewel represents a great experience for a jeweler\u2019s career. But in the end, all that was left was a discolored piece of paper.\u201dAlthough White had the signed a contract and a promissory note, he would never have taken this case to court.What judge would dare rule against the Marchioness Camellia in favor of a commoner?\u201cBecause of this, my father went bankrupt. He had to work so hard to the degree that he collapsed and died suddenly. Those people killed my father.\u201dShe complained, however she did not expect Cedric to do anything about it.Which person would fight a high-status noble for someone they had just met?Even more so a noble for the sake of a commoner.She had told him this story because she just wanted to pour her feelings out to someone. All this time, she had felt so desolate and helpless.Cedric understood her feelings.For that reason, he waited without saying anything, until she stopped crying. Then, he gave her the money for the face value of the promissory note plus interest and a little more compensation.\u201cNow, it\u2019s nothing more than just a piece of paper. We chose not to burn it because my father never gave up hope.\u201d\u201cUnderstandably, Mr. White did not want to do that.\u201dBut Cedric was in a different position. No court would dare to deny or doubt the document in his possession.The girl signed the sales contract with her eyes full of tears. With this, the ownership of Saintess Olga\u2019s Heart was transferred to him.After a few words of comfort, the two left White\u2019s house.***Cedric first returned to the Evron Mansion in the capital as it was too late to return to the military camp.He took off his overcoat and gave it to the servant, then he leaned back on the armchair. He felt like having a drink.As if he had noticed, Freyl took a bottle of brandy and one glass from the shelf. Shortly after, he poured the drink.Cedric accepted Freyl\u2019s glass of brandy.\u201cIt\u2019s intriguing.\u201dThose were Freyl\u2019s first words.\u201cIntriguing?\u201d\u201cAt first I had thought that Lady Artizea only wanted a precious jewel as a proposal gift. I never imagined that this was related to Grand Duke Roygar. Now I can understand why you said she and Miraila are different.\u201dA few hours ago, he had called her Miraila\u2019s daughter, but now he seemed to have changed his mind.\u201cI hadn\u2019t thought about it.\u201d\u201cWhat should we do? Lady Artizea gave Your Grace a pretext to fight against the Marchioness Camellia. If we sue for the return of the diamond, we could damage the reputation of the Marquisate Camellia.\u201dCedric looked at Freyl with a subtle expression on his face. Freyl spoke excitedly.\u201cAn honest merchant went bankrupt and died after being conned into selling a jewel, leaving his daughters alone. This would be a great scandal. Even more so if it emerged while Your Grace was looking for a proposal gift.\u201d\u201cI do not intend to expose the White Family to the public just to tarnish the reputation of Marchioness Camellia. What is the point of waging a dispute that may affect his daughters?\u201dNot only Marchioness Camellia, but Artizea, as well as Mr. White\u2019s daughters would get dragged into the scandal.Many would sympathize with Mr. White\u2019s daughters. However, they would still get hurt. A scandal like this was not something that could be handled by ordinary people.Even Artizea would be harshly criticized; comments would circulate that Miraila\u2019s daughter was greedy because she had wanted a very ostentatious diamond.\u201cIf that happens, I\u2019d rather not get that diamond.\u201d\u201cBut Your Grace-\u201d\u201cAny other precious gift will do. At least, that\u2019s what I thought you would say.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s different now. Not only is it a jewel that is a family heirloom, but also an heirloom from a family that became extinct after Viscountess Fischer, the Empress\u2019 lady-in-waiting, committed suicide. If Marchioness Camellia was not related to this, she would have already boasted about it to the point that there would be no one in high society who would not know about it.\u201dMoreover, the jeweler Odorov had not known that Marchioness Camellia possessed the jewel. And even if he had known, it was not a public fact, so he would not have risked talking about it.In other words, the Marchioness was hiding the jewel.\u201cIf not a gift, then it must be a bribe.\u201dCedric sighed.\u201cWhat would change whether it is a gift or a bribe? Uncle Roygar loves money and is not ashamed to covet wealth. It is no secret that Uncle Roygar accepts bribes, and that everyone around him does too. Would Uncle Roygar turn his back on Marchioness Camellia just because she accepted a bribe? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d\u201cSo, the Baron is a crooked man.\u201dFreyl spoke with conviction.\u201c\u2026\u201dCedric waved the glass in his hand and was silent for a moment.His mind was in utter chaos.If he wanted to get the jewel back, he could simply sue.After suing, they would then negotiate behind the scenes. Most likely, after weighing the costs and benefits between the two parties, an agreement could be reached for the diamond.But was that really what Artizea wanted him to do?Had she not mentioned the name of Marchioness Camellia because she did not know who had the diamond she wanted?He didn\u2019t believe so.\u300c Yes. That will make it easier for you to understand what kind of person I am\u2026 If you don\u2019t change your mind after getting Saintess Olga\u2019s Heart, propose to me so magnificently that everyone will talk about it.\u300dAlthough Artizea said that, for Cedric it was the opposite.He thought Artizea was testing him.She seemed to be trying to pose a difficult problem for him to see how he would handle it.\u201cIt reminds me of an old tale.\u201d\u201cAn old tale?\u201d\u201cA tale about a beautiful princess from the East who demanded to solve three riddles for whoever wanted to marry her.\u201d\u201cAh, that. Where hundreds of people failed.\u201d\u201cIn the end, a young wanderer uses his wits to solve the riddles and marry the princess, right?\u201d\u201cYes, I remember it.\u201dCedric wanted this to be the only riddle.\u2018On second thought, Lady Artizea\u2019s words were not entirely false. At least I could recognize that she is a very complex-minded person. Moreover, despite being at the bottom of the Marquisate Rosan, she is a person capable of gathering valuable information.\u2019\u201cLet\u2019s recapitulate. Lady Artizea asked for Saintess Olga\u2019s Heart. Officially, the diamond is now in the hands of Baron Yetz. Let\u2019s find out a little about Baron Yetz.\u201dFreyl commented.Cedric became lost in thought, shaking his glass while Freyl had the butler bring him the registry for the aristocrats.Artizea\u2019s real purpose was not the jewel.Was it a strategic move for the future?But creating a scandal to discredit the Marchioness Camellia had no practical effect.It would be logical if he had a personal grudge against the Marchioness, or if the objective was to create a power struggle in high society.However, it was not enough to strike a blow against the forces of Grand Duke Roygar.Besides, it was still too early for Cedric to fight the Grand Duke Roygar.What was currently more important was to make his presence felt in the central political arena.While he continued to be absorbed in his thoughts, Freyl checked the registry for the aristocrats and spoke,\u201cHere it is, Baron Yetz. The original title was Baron Rand. He inherited the family when he married the Baron\u2019s successor, and then changed the surname to his own. In fact, you could say he bought the title.\u201d\u201cHe must be very rich.\u201dIn the Crates Empire, technically, you couldn\u2019t buy or sell titles.However, by marrying the heir of a fallen family, it was possible for the spouse to get the title.And after a few years, if the spouse divorced the heir by paying a large sum of compensation, the family\u2019s master would then change. It was a convenient way to trade titles.\u201cBaron Yetz?\u201dOne of the knights of the guard, who until then had stood in front of the two men without saying anything, asked, his eyes wide open.\u201cWhy? Danny, do you know something?\u201d\u201cBaron Yetz, who married Baron Rand\u2019s daughter, is a casino owner. He has a large casino on Fontin Street, and about four others just in the capital.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s amazing that a nobleman is directly involved in the casino business.\u201dFreyl tilted his head and stared at the knight.\u201cDanny, how do you know so much about this? You haven\u2019t been gambling, have you?\u201cOf course not!\u201dDanny quickly shook his head.\u201cAbsolutely not. My younger brother is a bit of an idiot, so he\u2019s been indebted to Yetz\u2019s Casino a couple of times. I found out about it because I helped him pay it off on those occasions. If it was only an illegal casino, I would have tried to dismantle it.\u201d\u201cOr you tried, but the person backing it was more powerful than you thought.\u201dFreyl stated coolly, as he looked at Danny suspiciously.\u201cYou didn\u2019t use Grand Duke Evron\u2019s name in the process, did you?\u201d\u201cHow could you think that about me?\u201dDanny seemed offended, but he must have used the Grand Duke\u2019s name to some extent.Cedric shook his head.\u201cIt\u2019s all right. The important thing is that Baron Yetz is the owner of a casino. I think I just understood where the issue might be. It\u2019s probably one of Uncle Roygar\u2019s constant sources of income.\u201d\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d\u201cWhat do you think I\u2019m going to do?\u201dFreyl said after a moment of reflection.\u201cA good citizen has been swindled by a casino owner and died. If Your Grace had not known about it, you could not have done anything, but now that you do, you are not the kind of man who would let such an incident go unnoticed.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, I can\u2019t let it stay that way.\u201dCedric stood up.He still had no clear idea what Artizea wanted. So he planned to act his way, rather than try to give her an exemplary response.He was curious to see how it would all end.Standing next to Cedric, Freyl then asked,\u201cDo you want to go now?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t this the best time to go to a casino?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dFreyl smiled faintly.\u201cI will prepare the knights.\u201dThen he stepped forward.Cedric drank the glass of brandy slowly, before leaving. He could not stop himself from thinking about Artizea.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The crystal chandelier reflected the candlelight, shining brilliantly even in the middle of the night.This was Baron Yetz\u2019s strategy, to spend money, even to the point of seeming gaudy.Anyway, no matter how extravagantly decorated the interior was, the only impression one would pick out was how a small-time commoner had bought his title with money.In that case, it was better for him to boast about the overwhelming amount of money he had.The sound of masked guests cheering as they played their cards or rolled the dice could be heard.Half-naked men and women with golden cups slid like fish through the noise.Baron Yetz was happy with today\u2019s fine wind. Business was booming.When he successfully finished his patrol and turned to leave, the secretary suddenly approached him in a panic.Everyone present looked at the secretary, wondering what was going on.\u201cWhat did I tell you, fool? If you barge into the main hall like this, the customers guests can\u2019t concentrate on their games\u2026\u201d\u201cThis is no time to worry about that! We\u2019re in trouble!\u201d\u201cIn trouble?\u201d\u201cThe Grand Duke Evron is here. Bringing with him the ownership document of Saintess Olga\u2019s Heart!\u201dOf course, it was impossible for Baron Yetz to not know who the Grand Duke Evron was. However, he became puzzled, and for a moment, he could not understand what his secretary wanted to tell him.He had never once thought that Grand Duke Evron himself would ever come to his casino.In addition, the matter of Saintess Olga\u2019s Heart had happened so long ago that it took him a while to understand the meaning behind the secretary\u2019s words.But soon after, he understood the situation and hastily went to his office.Frigid air swept through the office like a sharp blade.Baron Yetz hesitated as he entered. Seven knights had taken control of the office.Grand Duke Evron\u2019s knights had strict military discipline and great vigor. They were all young, so they could have been carried away by the boisterous and profligate atmosphere of the casino, but instead, they all kept their composure.Sitting in an armchair, the Grand Duke Evron and looked visibly upset.\u201cGreetings, Grand Duke Evron, to what do we owe the honor that Your Grace has even taken the time to come to this shabby and humble place?\u201d\u201cSit down.\u201dCedric said firmly.He didn\u2019t like the atmosphere in the casino.Therefore, him exercising power without regard to due process could not be considered inappropriate.\u300cYour Grace must exercise your power. You can point in any direction you want. This is just a drop in the bucket of all that Baron Yetz has done so far.\u300dFreyl had expressed with a snort.Baron Yetz sat down with his legs together carefully. Cedric threw the document.Cedric waited for Baron Yetz to verify the document with his trembling hands and then spoke,\u201cI have acquired ownership of the Saintess Olga\u2019s Heart. Since you haven\u2019t paid for seven years, I don\u2019t think you have any right to make any claims about it.\u201d\u201cT-that\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cI will search the place to find it and also take the opportunity to check your ledgers.\u201dCedric declared imposingly.\u201cPardon?\u201dBaron Yetz asked reflexively.But the knights did not wait to act. As soon as Cedric made a gesture with his hand, they began to search the office in perfect order.Baron Yetz became startled and tried to stand up. However, before he knew it, one of the knights behind him put his hand on his shoulders and forced him to sit back down.A scream was suddenly heard outside. The seven knights in the office were not the only ones Cedric had brought.Dozens of knights occupied the administrative area of the casino at the same time. Baron Yetz\u2019s guards tried to respond but found themselves quickly overpowered.Of course, there was no way mere thugs could resist real knights.The space in which the guests were located had not been brought under control, but it was impossible for the commotion to not have been transmitted outside.The frightened guests rushed out of the casino.One of the employees rushed to the office to report the situation, but the knights caught him and brought him to his knees.\u201cEven Your Grace has no right to do this in my place of business!\u201dBaron Yetz shouted in a tearful voice. Cedric then asserted without changing his expression,\u201cThe Office of Public Security will not object to my search on the office of a casino that appears to have committed illegalities. Or perhaps, is there no need to do this for you to hand over the jewel?\u201dCedric asked even though he knew Baron Yetz didn\u2019t possess it.Will he mention Marchioness Camellia? In that case, Cedric would do whatever was necessary for the Baron to accompany him to a meeting with Marchioness Camellia.However, the probability that Baron Yetz would name her was extremely low.Beads of sweat formed on Baron Yetz\u2019s face. As expected, he tried to excuse himself.\u201c\u2026 Well, if you wait for a moment, I shall bring it to you.\u201d\u201cKnights present can bring it right away; you just have to say where it is.\u201d\u201cGive me time until tomorrow.\u201d\u201cHow can I trust you? People who take someone else\u2019s possessions and don\u2019t pay for seven years don\u2019t have any credibility, don\u2019t you think?\u201dCedric said coolly.\u201cIf you yourself have used your power to swindle a good merchant, and have gotten hold of the diamond in which he had invested most of his assets, you\u2019ve most certainly done other similar things. I will prove it.\u201d\u201cUhh\u2026\u201d\u201cIf you have any complaints, tell me where the diamond is.\u201dCedric demanded politely, but it was a complete threat.Baron Yetz couldn\u2019t say anything.He had no way out of this situation.Grand Duke Evron had too high a status for him to ignore or oppose him.If he were an insignificant low-status noble, he would have used the reputation of the Marchioness Camellia to his advantage.However, Marchioness Camellia would not tolerate Baron Yetz using her name against the Grand Duke Evron.His other option was to pretend that Mr. White\u2019s document was no longer valid, but there was too great a risk.In one of the hidden file archives, there was a manipulated document.However, he could not open these file archives in front of others. Long ago, he had stored the document with other fake documents, not knowing this would happen.In addition, the Grand Duke Evron had the original document in his possession, so he would have no problem discrediting the authenticity of the manipulated document. The court would also side with Grand Duke Evron unconditionally.It could even, in some way, provoke the wrath of the Marchioness Camellia for causing her an inconvenience.The knights turned the office upside down. They had taken out both the file boxes that were hidden and the safe.Baron Yetz\u2019s frightened secretary handed over the key. With the key, there was now no need to break the lock of the safe.Baron Yetz tried his last resort with his head down.\u201cYour Grace, I have a blue diamond that is even more grandiose and magnificent. I can give it to you instead\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat a pity. I really need the Saintess Olga\u2019s Heart. The lady specifically asked me for it as a present. I shouldn\u2019t give her another jewel, should I?\u201dBaron Yetz\u2019s face turned pale. He had realized that the only lady with sufficient status to receive the Saintess Olga\u2019s Heart as a present from Grand Duke Evron was the Empress.He was in a real bind. He couldn\u2019t think of a way out no matter how hard he tried. And if they found out what was in the basement\u2026Cedric turned his gaze away from Baron Yetz.Baron Yetz was a scum. Destroying this man\u2019s office was not something to feel guilty about. Besides, he had promised Freyl he would ignore due process.However, Cedric did not like to use pretexts in order to oppress others with his power.Just when he was thinking that-One of the knights rushed up and knelt down before him.\u201cYour Grace, there is a dungeon in the basement, I think you should come see for yourself.\u201d\u201cWhat about it?\u201dCedric asked, puzzled. Most aristocratic manor houses had at least one small dungeon. It would be strange if there wasn\u2019t a dungeon in this casino with thugs within it.However, the knight\u2019s attitude was unusual. Cedric stood up and followed the knight into the basement.When he arrived at the place, he held his breath.What was there was not a small dungeon that could hold three or four people, but a prison camp that could hold more than a hundred.Inside, dozens of naked boys and girls were locked in chains.Human trafficking.***\u201cAlthough imperial laws now just nominally exist, this does not mean that there is no rule of law.\u201dArtizea said quietly, holding his cup of tea.The tea had a wonderful aroma. However, it was a little heavy for Artizea to drink in the middle of the night because it contained a little bit of betel nut that did not fit her fragile constitution.But she could not refuse it since it had been given by Marchioness Camellia. She had no choice but to drink the tea.\u201cThough the Emperor does what he wants, he still fears to arouse the anger of the people, even though he does not openly say so. He is quite obsessed with legitimacy and power.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI read somewhere that what a crown prince experiences can influence his entire government, and I think that\u2019s true.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean, Lady Artizea?\u201d\u201cGambling is acceptable. Drugs are acceptable. Bribes are acceptable. Even violence is acceptable. The public doesn\u2019t care, because for them, that\u2019s the typical behavior of nobles.\u201dArtizea continued,\u201cBut hurting young children will provoke the people\u2019s anger. His Majesty will also be furious. Even if it is just pretense to be furious in order to keep public sentiment under control.\u201d\u201cAre you trying to threaten me, Lady?\u201d\u201cI am only telling you, it is in your interest to sever that connection, for the sake of the Grand Duke Roygar. Marchioness Camellia.\u201dArtizea stared at her with her turquoise eyes.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Do you think Grand Duke Roygar is somehow related to Baron Yetz, Lady?\u201dShe spoke in a graceful tone.But her mind was still in disarray.Baron Yetz was one of Grand Duke Roygar\u2019s most important sources of funding.Although this did not mean that he played an important role in the Grand Duke Roygar\u2019s faction.He simply gave large amounts of money in exchange for certain benefits. Because the Director of Public Security and the Minister of Finance were men of Grand Duke Roygar\u2019s faction, as well as key officials.It was not a relationship created by loyalty, so it did not matter if it ended.Certainly, it would be best to sever all connection with Baron Yetz. Especially if it was true that Cedric had taken his ledgers.Now that Cedric was involved, there was no chance that things would be quietly get resolved through behind-the-scene negotiations or political agreements.Since Mr. White\u2019s daughters and the jewel were related to this issue, the newspapers would make a lot of noise about it.The emperor would use scapegoats rather than risk appeasing the people\u2019s anger by force.Baron Yetz would not be enough to appease the people\u2019s anger, so he would have to offer a piece of higher status.She had to avoid becoming that target.Anyway, all Baron Yetz had to offer was money. It was a lot of money, but not something indispensable. It was not the time to feel pity for it.But she could not simply accept Artizea\u2019s words. She wondered how far she should believe what she was saying.Cedric Evron hated politics behind closed doors.Marchioness Camellia had also heard the rumour that he had fallen in love with Lady Artizea.Is he the kind of man who gave up what he has to do at the behest of the woman he was in love with?It was a mystery. Cedric was a young man, and several men only truly showed their genuine nature after falling in love.Although there was no guarantee Artizea could sever the connection between Grand Duke Roygar and Baron Yetz\u2019s business, there was also no guarantee she could not.Artizea put down her teacup and looked at her.\u201cBaron Yetz is a vulgar man. He offers bribes to anyone who can benefit him. I am sure he has given gifts to many influential figures, all to gain protection at times like this. However, it is not wise to receive a gift from such a person.\u201dArtizea smiled.\u201cA lady of your standing would never have imagined that the jewel the Baron gave you as a present had been acquired by swindling a good person.\u201dMarchioness Camellia slipped her fingertips over the edge of the teacup.Artizea put the teacup back on her lips. Marchioness Camellia watched Artizea carefully.The corners of Artizea\u2019s mouth were gently curved. Her eyes shone, as if she were in a pleasant situation. Her every movement was elegant and calm.She wore a frilly dress, but it did not stand out. It looked cheap and shabby from so much washing, and moreover, its sleeves were short.Although she was still young, she acted like one of those old sly foxes within high society.Until now, she never gave Artizea any importance. Miraila\u2019s daughter, a poor girl. That was what she thought of Artizea until now.Although she was the successor to the Marquisate Rosan, she didn\u2019t have it in her own hands. She was Lawrence\u2019s sister, but she would not be useful, even for a political marriage.She would be devoured by Miraila like a parasite for the rest of her life, and Lawrence would try to gain his freedom by feeding his obsessive mother to her sister.Marchioness Camellia took pride in knowing human nature well. Miraila would never give up her daughter.Many parents considered their children as their alter ego\u2026 or rather, their possessions.Many people found pleasure in tormenting, controlling, and abusing others.But there was a clear difference between beating a servant and abusing a child.Nothing satisfies one\u2019s desire for power and possession more than the pleasure one felt when one beats their own child to death, and then starts to hear their cries, longing for your embrace and affection.To give up such a well-tamed possession was meaningless.Therefore, they would not be someone to worry about.But now the girl in front of her was not the poor girl Marchioness Camellia had always thought she was, but a genuine lady.In the eyes of the Marchioness Camellia, there seemed to be a turquoise fire burning inside Artizea.\u2018It is a pity we did not meet sooner.\u2019 The Marchioness thought.Sometimes friendships can be more intense than romance, but her daughter was far from being able to gain this girl\u2019s trust.What about her son? Her son would have been suitable, but Cedric had already met her first.Standing up from her seat, she asked Aritzea to wait for a moment. Then she returned with a velvet jewelry box.Inside, there was a diamond necklace.Artizea could recognize that the jewel embedded in the center was the Saintess Olga\u2019s Heart.\u201cThis necklace was designed especially for the Saintess Olga\u2019s Heart. Please take it as it is.\u201d\u201cThen I will pay you for the rest of the necklace.\u201d\u201cLady Artizea, that won\u2019t be necessary. As you know, you have already paid a reasonable price. Besides, I think I can imagine who you want this jewel for.\u201dMarchioness Camellia spoke in a soft and gentle voice about her memories.\u201cIn the past, when I was not recognized as the daughter of Marquess Kwaimar, and was not even acknowledged as a noble\u2019s daughter, the most honorable lady in high society used to attend the same ballroom as me.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dArtizea responded cautiously, so as not to reveal her emotions.\u201cNow it is different, my husband cares about me, and Her Grace the Grand Duchess Roygar recognizes me as her older sister, she submits to me. Now, even the other nobles look up to me. \u201dThe Marchioness Camellia continued.\u201cAt that time, I couldn\u2019t imagine greeting Her Majesty nor anything close. I was so envious when she treated her friend with affection and praised her family\u2019s precious jewel, that I could not forget it. \u201dArtizea knew the reason why the Marchioness Camellia spoke this way.\u2018Acting as if this were a gift for the Empress, it gave the impression that the jewel was not being taken away from her. Thus denying her relationship with Baron Yetz while maintaining a pleasant atmosphere. In reality, she could not accept that such a precious jewel was in the hands of such a vulgar man, who was not even a true noble.\u2019\u201cSo after having this memory of my youth in my hands, I felt the need to exalt its beauty. This is a temporary measure because the Statue of the Saintess Olga has disappeared and we have not been able to find it, so the gem was temporarily placed in this necklace.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dArtizea spoke naturally.Of course, the words of the Marchioness Camellia were not credible.She was not the kind of person who would consider this a memory. But if she were truly telling the truth regarding her admiration and memories of the Empress, she would have already presented this diamond to Her Majesty.Artizea thought this was probably a trophy for the Marchioness Camellia.A reward for her youth, wherein she felt slighted and inferior to Viscountess Fischer.Now, she had in her hands the proof that she was in a much higher position than Viscountess Fischer, with an influence that not even the Empress could afford to ignore.But for Artizea, Viscountess Fischer\u2019s life had been much fuller compared to that of the Marchioness Camellia. Because she was able to meet her master, the person to whom she wanted to dedicate her life; she earned her trust and died for her.Then Marchioness Camellia smiled before finally expressing,\u201cI trust that you will convey my feelings properly to Her Majesty.\u201d\u201cI will bear that in mind.\u201dArtizea took the jewelry box and stood up.\u201cI apologize for having come at this time of night. May the hands of the goddess of the night allow you to have a pleasant dream.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you think we can be good friends? Come visit me often in the future.\u201dArtizea just smiled.Although that was not a bad idea, she and the Marchioness Camellia were not destined to be friends.Marchioness Camellia wanted to turn Grand Duke Roygar into the Emperor, or so it seemed.Yet conversely, Artizea would one day bring down Grand Duke Roygar.***When Artizea left Camellia\u2019s estate, the moon was already tilting towards the west and a morning star was rising in the sky towards the east.Everything was in motion, and now nothing could stop it.She did not go to the main entrance of the Marquisate Rosan\u2019s mansion, but got out of the carriage near the rear entrance.She didn\u2019t want anyone to know about tonight\u2019s departure. She had left in an unmarked carriage.The night breeze was cold. Alphonse put a cape on her shoulders.\u201cLice.\u201dArtizea called one of the two maids who followed her.Lice Hanson, who had arrived in the Marquisate Rosan yesterday and did not yet know what role she would play, bowed slightly and replied, \u201cYes milady.\u201d\u201cYour grandfather is staying in the Grand Duchy of Evron at the moment, right? Are your other relatives there too?\u201d\u201cNo, but my uncle is staying in the capital.\u201dThat was the answer Marcus had told her to say in case Artizea asked.\u201cI see.\u201dArtizea nodded her head. Perhaps it meant that instead of Marcus, his eldest son had the means to contact his relatives.She pulled a letter from her chest.\u201cThen go to your uncle and give him this letter. That will be best.\u201dSending a letter to the Grand Duchy of Evron late at night would be risky, so this was the best course of action at the moment.The return of the Hanson Family to the Marquisate Rosan still had to be prepared behind the scenes.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. All you have to do is give it to him. Your grandfather and your uncle will decide the important things.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201d\u201cGet in this carriage. It\u2019s too late for you to get another one. After you hand over the letter, you can visit your grandfather on the way back. Just try not to attract the attention of the other maids.\u201d\u201cYes. Thank you.\u201dAfter receiving the letter, she kept it in her chest and bowed politely to Artizea.Soon the carriage was gone. Artizea went inside the mansion.She had finally finished the preparations to take control of the Marquisate Rosan.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

If they were to be kicked out, they would have no place to go and nothing to do, so they cried out to Bill.If the rightful successor said he would exercise that right, of course, Bill wanted to kneel in front of him.So he can\u2019t help but be confused.The world turned upside down in one morning? Or, will they be back in place when Miraila and Lawrence return? Will there be a fight? Should Artizea be the Master now?In terms of reason, it was right to follow Artizea, but for many years, there were many people who were prejudiced that the lady was nothing in the mansion.Even Jacob, who temporarily held the keys to the vault, had not yet understood the situation.In the meantime, Grand Duke Evron visited. The employees who thought he was the cause of this cataclysm were cautious, not knowing what to do with the Grand Duke.However, the tide has already changed. A few maids from Artizea\u2019s side actively wandered around.\u201cWelcome, Your Grace. My lady told me to take you to the Tuvalet room.\u201dSophie greeted Cedric in a very happy mood and said so.\u201cTuvalet Room?\u201d\u201cYes. Madame Emily is here.\u201dCedric hesitated.Tuvalet room. If it\u2019s not an intimate relationship like a family, isn\u2019t it a place to invite lovers or to be attracted to each other?Sophie laughed lightly.Cedric realized too late that he was a man presenting himself for a marriage preparation.His face turned red.Artizea\u2019s Tuvalet room was overflowing with fabrics and props and flowed out into the hallway.Cedric stumbled once more in front of an open door. Loud voices came from inside.\u201cOh my God! You look so good!\u201d\u201cSince your skin is as white as snow, it fits any color you wear!\u201d\u201cHow about this pink color? You always try to wear dark colors. Sometimes you have to wear cute clothes too!\u201d\u201cOh, this is good too. Well, if you have this hair color and your eyes, you look good in everything. Okay. Pick this one as well. It\u2019s perfect for making a dress for a picnic.\u201d\u201cThis too!\u201dCedric didn\u2019t have the courage to step in. But Sophie, who guided him, yelled out without hesitation.\u201cHis Highness, The Grand Duke Evron has come.\u201dThe Tuvalet Room became quiet for a very short time.Emily and her staff knelt on one knee and politely bowed.\u201cIt\u2019s an honor to meet you, Your Highness Evron.\u201dEmily\u2019s voice was half a tone higher than usual. Cedric flinched.If this was a momentum fight, it was Cedric\u2019s side that was defeated. Emily laughed when she saw him embarrassed.It is not common for something to be so pleasant like this. The man who bought the whole wardrobe and spent it, and the girl who will be beautiful from now on, it\u2019s going to be the most interesting moment.\u201cStop it.\u201dArtizea called attention with a soft voice. Cedric breathed a sigh of relief.\u201cExcuse me early in the morning.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been more than two hours since I had breakfast. It\u2019s too late for early morning.\u201d\u201cYou wake up early.\u201dCedric said so.He was a military commander and knight, so getting up early was a habit.However, most of the nobles, especially those without a position, enjoy parties until dawn the day before, and only get up late until after lunch.Artizea smiled.\u201cSit down. It\u2019s right to welcome you by the parlor, but the only room in this house that I can say for sure is the Tuvalet room, except for my bedroom. I hope you don\u2019t think it\u2019s rude.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry to come to you early in the morning without an appointment.\u201dCedric sat in an awkward position. Artizea called Sophie.\u201cSophie, give His Grace a cup of warm mint tea. Give me a cup of tea too.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cFirst, take a breather. You look tired. Let\u2019s talk next.\u201dWhen Artizea beckoned, Emily and the staff began to organize the fabrics and samples of trinkets that had been scattered all over the place.Looking at it, Cedric said casually.\u201cBy the way, Madame Emily is here early.\u201d\u201cBecause there are so many clothes to make.\u201dArtizea had very few clothes.First, she\u2019ll need a party dress, perhaps an engagement dress. And she could afford to get almost everything new, from outing dresses and teatime dresses, to everyday clothes and room clothes. Of course, it wasn\u2019t something that could be done in one day.Cedric nodded. It was he who told her to do however she pleases. He couldn\u2019t even guess how many clothes would actually be made.As soon as he showed interest, Emily threw away the fabrics and trinkets she had been arranging. There was an ultramarine cloth in her hand.The fabric, endlessly embroidered with fine patterns of silver, looked expensive to Cedric, who knew nothing.\u201cWhat do you think of this fabric, Your Grace?\u201dEven after asking for his opinion, Cedric had nothing to say.Emily unfolded the cloth and put it on Artizea\u2019s shoulder. The color goes well with Artizea\u2019s bright platinum hair, and her white face looked even whiter.\u201cIt\u2019s the finest Ianz embroidery. Only one roll came in. I think this fabric will go well with the dark blue color of the Grand Duke of Evron.\u201dArtizea then said.\u201cIt\u2019s too much. If you make a dress with Ianz embroidery, you\u2019ll pay for at least one villa. It\u2019s enough to attach it at the ends.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s follow Madame\u2019s recommendations.\u201dCedric intervened. He didn\u2019t know about dresses or fabrics, but he could add a word for the money issue.\u201cMadame knows the best, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\u201cEven if it is expensive, this kind of embroidery is for the works. Wouldn\u2019t it be better for someone who looks good to wear it?\u201d\u201cThe person that suits you is the Lady! There are only a few people who can pull off this kind of fabric.\u201dArtizea rebuffs such praise. It\u2019s a merchant\u2019s praise anyway. What can\u2019t they say to sell?When Artizea had a grim face, Emily had a burning face.She finally closed her eyes and said.\u201cI will only take the fabric price.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not trying to get it.\u201d\u201cInstead, when the Lady gets married, please leave your wedding dress and the first party dress you will wear after the wedding to me.\u201dArtizea thought for a moment. Honestly, she wasn\u2019t trying to cut down the price. However, she couldn\u2019t help but be swayed if it was cut down to such an extent.It was not Artizea, but Cedric who answered.\u201cPlease do that.\u201d\u201cYour Grace.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not about price when getting a lady a gift.\u201dArtizea looked at him with a subtle look and nodded.The simplest and best way to spread gossip between man and woman is to spend money. It was strange that Cedric knew that.Well, she knew he sent Emily because he knew so.\u201cThank you. Then, I will proceed.\u201dEmily said thanks with a bright face.This job will add the best line to her career.The two have not yet set a date for their marriage, but the chances are very high.If she had the opportunity to make a wedding dress for the Great Duke of Evron, it was worth the considerable amount of loss.How bitter it was that she wasn\u2019t able to make Roygar\u2019s dress.Artizea has elegant bones and fair skin.She rarely dressed to suit her beautiful appearance, but she was born with elegance and ladylikeness.She wasn\u2019t as passionate a beauty as her mother, Miraila.She lacked the charming attitude and adorable laughter that people demanded of girls this age, nor she had sweet looks and flushed cheeks.However, a person with such a beautiful and undisturbed frame shines with age.Emily had the ability to see beyond a person\u2019s appearance and see through the real temperament in it.Emily wasn\u2019t saying this because she was a big guest, but it was a really good material.A great model, the best fabric, and the lavish wares, this was a seamstress\u2019 joy.\u201cI\u2019ve been interfering for too long. Then, I think I\u2019ll proceed as it is, and I will come back.\u201dEmily bowed, speaking politely. The employees bowed behind her, designed it, and arranged the samples, and left out like a low tide.There were only them two left behind among the previous piles of fabrics and laces, and all sorts of things that dizzy the eye. Cedric became very awkward.Soon Sophie came and put down the tea with a refreshing scent on the table.Alphonse guards the door outside.Cedric took a sip of tea and sighs.\u201cI think I\u2019ll get some. I couldn\u2019t sleep much last night.\u201d\u201cIt seems like you are more tired of dealing with Emily than staying up all night.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just that I\u2019m not used to it.\u201dCedric said with a straight face.\u201cLast night, various things happened. I apologize to the Lady for that, and I want to confirm something.\u201d\u201cYes, go ahead.\u201d\u201cThe next time we meet, I told you that I will bring Saintess Olga\u2019s heart, but it has become difficult to keep that promise.Artizea was not surprised or disappointed.\u201cYou know everything.\u201dCedric sighed.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 27": "Chapter 27Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 27Translator: effefilleProofreader: xoxomonamiAfter witnessing the scene of human trafficking at Baron Yetz casino yesterday, he had been feeling slightly conflicted..It was because he couldn\u2019t figure out how far it would go.As the case escalated, it became uncertain whether he\u2019ll be able to get the jewel back in time.The surest way to get the jewel back was to hold onto the information about trafficking and bribery to negotiate with Marchioness Camellia.However, what conflicted him the most was the guilt he felt for not being able to keep his promise to Artizea.Although it was a pressing matter, there wasn\u2019t really time to worry.\u201cI couldn\u2019t use this issue as a negotiating tool, even if it meant breaking my promise to the Lady. And I think the Lady would understand why I couldn\u2019t..\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a bit embarrassed, Your Grace. You\u2019ve probably already guessed that I didn\u2019t ask for Saintess Olga\u2019s heart because I actually wanted the gem.\u201cI know. The Lady probably wanted me to get involved in this situation through a more natural process. Because if this was truly just about dealing with the human trafficking that was ocurring, you would have instead just conferred with Sir Keshore.\u201dBut she didn\u2019t. She didn\u2019t even tell Cedric the story of Baron Yetz directly.If she had, Cedric would have been simply concerned with the procedural question of whether he should leave it to the security office,despite knowing that the corrupt security office will try to reduce the case.The situation, instead, involved him meeting a jeweler to obtain a proposal gift and after hearing about the injustice that happened to the innocent jeweler, he pressed the matter against Baron Yetz at the casino house. As a result of the confrontation, he became furious at the discovery of the illegal trafficking that was occurring incognito.And maybe in the future, his fury towards injustice can involve him into more of this kind of work. As such, he will quickly rise as a true nobleman who cares for the people, and not just as a hero of a distant border.Cedric understood that purpose last night.He knew from the beginning that she didn\u2019t just want him to find the jewel.He didn\u2019t think Artizea would never have found the jewel.Nevertheless, he wanted to come to apologize.There was a kind of romantic notion to the word \u2018proposal gift\u2019. He seemed to care about it more than he had thought he would..\u201cBecause a promise is a promise.\u201dThen Artizea bowed her head.\u201cIt is actually myself who should apologize to His Grace.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201cI have already secured the jewel.\u201dArtizea said and proceeded to retrieve something from the bedroom.She put the jewelry box down in front of the puzzled Cedric and opened the lid.\u201cThis diamond is the Saintess Olga\u2019s Heart.\u201dThe necklace sparkled a brilliant light.Saintess Olga\u2019s Heart, the central jewel, was great, and the jewels that adorned its surroundings were small but not lacking.Cedric had no artistic eye, but he could see how carefully the necklace was made.\u201cThis, when \u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cI went to Marchioness Camellia at dawn.\u201dArtizea replied. Cedric looked at her in surprise.No amount of play was enough against her.\u201cYou\u2019re very quick with information. I think I went to the casino after 10 o\u2019clock last night.\u201d\u201cNo one truly follows a man like Baron Yetz. Although there are people who work with him, they are all simply connected by money. It just so happens that employees are easily discarded. There are plenty of people who will provide information for just a few pennies.\u201d\u201cSo, knowing that I went to the casino last night, you went straight to the Marchioness Camellia.\u201dArtizea carefully looked at Cedric.\u201cAre you disappointed?\u201dArtizea looked up and looked directly at Cedric\u2019s eyes.When she spoke to Lawrence, her eyes were always down. But that was so he wouldn\u2019t get angry..But when you talk to Cedric, you have to keep your eyes on him.Cedric was a person who wanted to understand and could understand.Speaking to Lawrence was like giving a presentation to a wall, while Cedric was actually engaged enough in the conversation to actually respond.He could never guess how much it made her tremble.Cedric asked back in surprise.\u201cWhy would I be disappointed?\u201d\u201cBecause I deceived you.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think so. Didn\u2019t the Lady make it clear from the beginning that the gem was just a means? I\u2019m going to need to get to know you a little better.\u201dFeeling the heat rising inside his chest, he said firmly,\u201cBut I am angry. Not because the Lady did something wrong, but because you didn\u2019t believe me.\u201d\u201cYour Grace\u2026.\u201d\u201cI understand that the Lady asked to marry me as a means to work together towards a better future. And although we didn\u2019t begin our relationship with love, shouldn\u2019t my partner trust me to carry out the same goals?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s different.\u201dArtizea stood up from her seat. It was because she didn\u2019t want the waves tidaling in her heart to be evident.\u201cI told you about the political marriage, but it\u2019s only a means. If I weren\u2019t 20 years old and Lawrence\u2019s sister, I would have knelt down and sworn allegiance instead of making such a request.\u201d\u201cEven more so, the Lady should have believed in me, because everything you do will be my responsibility,\u201d Cedric said quietly.Artizea shook her head.\u201cI know that Your Grace hates authority and schemes. Perhaps you understand my reasons, but deep down, you are uncomfortable with being tricked into using your power for the sake of the victims of human trafficking.\u201d\u201cA family is a family. I know that the Lady is trying to compensate for my shortcomings.\u201dCedric stared at her.\u201cThe Lady has been telling me things from the beginning till the end and you didn\u2019t realize it yourself?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dArtizea turned to him.\u201cFor the future, you are telling me to give up my honor and justice for now, and to simply take the disgrace. From the day we first met to the present day, I understood the way the lady works.\u201d\u201d\u201cYour Grace\u2026.\u201d\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a straight path, but it was the right thing to do,\u201d Cedric said calmly.\u201cOne of my lieutenants is a guy named Freil.. He asked me to give up procedural legitimacy to do the right thing. I also led the knights to Baron Yetz casino to get White\u2019s revenge. I\u2019m not exactly the most righteous person.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cI know you can\u2019t get to the throne on a straight road alone. So tell me everything. No, I\u2019m not good at lying, so you can tell me after all if necessary. However, I feel that I should also bear the burden of all this. \u201cArtizea couldn\u2019t say anything.\u201cAnswer me,\u201d Cedric said firmly.\u201c\u2026 Yes. I will accept Your Grace\u2019s wishes.\u201dEven if he decided to accept Artizea, he was still infinitely in the right. Artizea wouldn\u2019t dare shake her head, saying she couldn\u2019t.However, even though she answered the way she did, Artizea did not intend to keep her word. Until now, she planned to disclose only the parts he could understand.\u2018And because it\u2019s something you shouldn\u2019t be responsible for.\u2019As she did for Lawrence, any time she devised one of her schemes, she made sure it was clean.Still, she was very grateful for his words..She smiled bitterly.\u201cDo you know why I like you, Your Grace?\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201dCedric flinched at her sudden words.\u201cYour Majesty was born with a noble status and suffered in his childhood. He was in a position where he could ignore his subordinates and not even consider them as human beings, or he could be buried in his own world and sympathize only with himself. But your heart always moves in the same direction as mine.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026\u201dCedric exhaled a long sigh from his lungs, which was momentarily startled and tense.So it was that kind of story?Cedric turned his gaze because it felt awkward for no reason.He didn\u2019t see himself as such a great person. He didn\u2019t even think Artizea understood him at all. They have been together for less than a month after all.But Artizea\u2019s words had a strange persuasive power.She seemed to have faith that Cedric could change the world for the better.He hoped to never betray that belief.They drank tea without a word for a while.\u201cI\u2019m thinking of going to Chancellor Lin soon,\u201d Cedric said when the teapot was empty.\u201cYes, Chancellor Lin is a fair and honorable man. You made a good decision. Your Grace is a military figure who has nothing to do with politics, and you don\u2019t have to give up that image yet. Sometimes it would be appropriate to check the progress of things once in a while.\u201dArtizea said so. Cedric asked again.\u201cWhat are you going to do with Saintess Olga\u2019s Heart?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to give it to Her Majesty the Empress. It\u2019s a keepsake from a dear friend of hers, so it\u2019s only right that she keeps it.\u201d\u201cRight.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not upset, are you?\u201d Artizea asked carefully.\u201cI thought you\u2019d plan to do that from the time I heard Pescher\u2019s story. What do I have to be upset about?\u201dThe truth was that he felt sad. So Cedric sighed a little.\u201cIt\u2019s just that I couldn\u2019t retrieve the gift, so it\u2019s difficult to make a splendid proposal.\u201dArtizea shut her mouth, unsure of how to respond.Cedric took a small velvet pouch from his chest pocket. Then, he opened the pouch and revealed a diamond bracelet over his palm.\u201cGive me your hand.\u201dArtizea\u2019s face flushed red.She would not have felt this way if he had brought a jewel as big as Saintess Olga\u2019s Heart in a precious box.However, the diamond bracelet had neither history, political value, nor features worthy of attention. It was too simple to use as a gift for Grand Duke Evron\u2019s proposal.For that reason, it made Artizea feel even more embarrassed.Did he buy the bracelet himself?Cedric carefully put the bracelet on her wrist.\u201cI\u2019ll use this as a replacement proposal gift. Please marry me.\u201dThis was only a formality. Cedric only chose to recite the traditional proposal words.The real meaning behind his words was instead, \u2018I will accept you as my servant and fellow\u2019.Artizea thought so.Cedric, however, thought differently.This diamond bracelet, not Saintess Olga\u2019s heart, was chosen by him for Artizea.So rather, it was a much more meaningful moment for him.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 28": "Chapter 28 - Politics or marriagePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 28: Politics or marriageTranslator: effefilleProofreader: xoxomonamiFor some time, since the human trafficking scandal, the empire has been very noisy.In no time, the expos\u00e9 was known all around. The people couldn\u2019t help but talk about it! It was something the salon lady would chat about, scholars seated at a cafe would discuss, and even commoners made visits to each other\u2019s homes with cookie jars in tow just to talk about the news.Each time the whole story of the incident was revealed, the people were immensely excited.When it was revealed that most of the trafficking in the casino house was children, parents who had lost their children clamored and flocked to the security office.There were also parents who sold their children themselves, but after hearing the news, they stopped working from far away and came to look for their missing child.When it was revealed that a considerable number of them were sold as sex slaves, fires of anger swept across the capital.A rally was held calling for the public execution of those involved. Some people hopped up the podium in the park and made a resentful speech.Newspapers poured out criticism about the lives of the fallen nobles.The citizens were outraged and were on the verge of starting a riot when it was uncovered that Count Eisen had continuously supplied children under the age of 10 and then later killed and buried.Dry firewood was piled up around the security office building and oil was poured out. The magistrate responded by calling a gun squadron there and aiming guns.Eventually, the popular Chancellor Lin, came out to apologize, and promised to direct the investigation himself and make the criminals pay.Even so, the anger of the citizens did not subside. The assembly was disbanded until Cedric stepped forward and made earnest promises.The news reached the annex where Emperor Gregor was in less than a day.The emperor responded to the first human trafficking case with appropriately disguised anger.But when he learned that Lawrence was involved in Count Eisen\u2019s case, he turned his desk upside down in anger.The information revealed to the public was that Count Eisen was a pedophile who regularly had dealings with Baron Yetz.However, the report received by the emperor contained much more detailed news.According to what was written there, Count Eison not only personally killed the children, but also bought 30 children at once at half-year intervals and used them for hunting.The hunting game was renowned for being stimulating and exciting among the young and prodigal nobles.And the biggest problem was that Lawrence got involved in the game several times.\u201cAre you crazy!\u201dThe emperor shouted and threw the inkwell at Lawrence. The attendants fell on the floor and shivered.As he dared not avoid it, Lawrence was completely struck.The glass did not break. However, the lid was open, so the coveted hair and white face were stained black with the dripping ink.\u201cFather.\u201d\u201cI knew you were going wild. I thought that a young man might do that. It\u2019s a once-in-a-lifetime thing. So no matter how you play around, I understand you. But you hunt people and bury them in the dark? Are you playing with the guy who stripped them and released them in the forest?\u201d\u201cFather, I-.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to hear it!\u201dNot listening to Lawrence\u2019s excuse, the emperor threw the report to his head this time.Lawrence closed his eyes tightly, enduring the humiliation.\u201cWho doesn\u2019t know Count Eisen is a friend of yours?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not a personal relationship. Didn\u2019t Father have a relationship with Count Eisen\u2019s predecessor?\u201d\u201cYou mean you don\u2019t have the ability to judge what kind of guy he is? You\u2019re that far off? Oh, you\u2019re so incompetent that you don\u2019t even have a head around you to even think that you\u2019d be in big trouble if you got caught?\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not anything else, it\u2019s human trafficking! It\u2019s killing a child! Do you not even know what the foundation of the empire is? Do you know that the people of the Empire are under the protection of the emperor and can only be disposed of by the Imperial Law?\u201dThe emperor pulled out a letter from the report and shouted while shaking it.\u201cCed said that it would be okay to handle the bribery case at my disposal, so that only the trafficking side would be dealt with. Do you know what this means? The case is serious enough that a stubborn guy like that says that it is okay to cover this whole-scale bribery case. It means that even if I tried to stop him, he won\u2019t stay still. But, because you\u2019re involved, I can\u2019t raise my face to Ced!\u201dLawrence wanted to ask. No matter what he says, the emperor will not listen. However, his lips trembled with anger.It was then. The door opened wide and Miraila came in. Lawrence glanced at her.Miraila stared at him once with anxious eyes, and approached the emperor with a gentle walk.The emperor did not scold her for coming in. Then Miraila approached the emperor\u2019s side, sweeping the nape of his neck with her hands.\u201cDon\u2019t be so angry,\u201d she said, tenderly.\u201cAre you here because you were worried about your son again? What the hell is he? I clearly said not to let people in.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m worried about you too. Don\u2019t be angry, huh? It\u2019s been a while since the doctor said that getting too excited is bad for the heart.\u201dMiraila whispered in a sweet voice.\u201cWell, it\u2019s because you\u2019re this way that he can\u2019t get himself together at his age. When I was that age, I grabbed the crown prince\u2019s seat with my hand.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it because your Majesty is too excellent?\u201dMiraila rubbed the Emperor\u2019s neck, then loosened his tie.Then, she folded his collar and carefully massaged the place with both hands. The perfume that had been applied to the hand in advance made the scent of flowers waft around the emperor.It was an obvious move, but it worked. The emperor sighed once and then relaxed his body.Miraila massaged his shoulders in an earnest, reassuring way.\u201cDon\u2019t worry me too much. If you get angry, it\u2019s not good for your health. Look at this. It\u2019s tense here again.\u201d\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll tell the masseur to do a massage later. You said your finger hurts every morning.\u201dThe emperor said, taking her hand, kissing her knuckles.Then he waved to Lawrence.\u201cCut ties with Eisen quickly. I\u2019ll take care of the rest. Consider yourself lucky! Ced may be an uptight fellow, but he won\u2019t condemn you for Tia\u2019s sake!\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about\u2026.?\u201dMiraila was about to ask. This is because the emperor\u2019s anger could not be defused any more.The emperor sighed and shook his head.\u201cGo back and think about how you can get closer to Ced.\u201d\u201cFather.\u201d\u201cThink carefully. I may be your father, but I don\u2019t intend to choose you as my successor unconditionally. I can\u2019t. Ced is the Grand Duke of Evron. And he has a network that you don\u2019t have. Just put Ced in your hands. Then I will do the rest.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Yes.\u201dLawrence replied in a humiliated voice.\u201cGo back. I\u2019m tired.\u201dSaid the emperor with his eyes closed.Lawrence stepped back and wiped the ink dripping from his forehead into his cuffs.The emperor then ordered Archduke Roygar to send a copy of the bribe.Until then, Miraila, silently rubbed the emperor\u2019s shoulder.The emperor had written up all the names to be sent to the capital\u2019s Chancellor Lin, and then pulled Miraila to sit on the armrest.Then he leaned against her soft body and sighed.\u201cI have to get ready to go back to the capital.\u201d\u201cYes, as Your Majesty wants\u2026..\u201dShe gently slid her hand around his chest, bowing her head and kissing his forehead.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about it that much, but Lawrence has to get his head on straight.\u201d\u201cI say father a lion, a son cannot be a dog. Don\u2019t worry too much. A boy grows up with a lot of accidents. It\u2019s because he has a lot of bugs that stick to him because he\u2019s of noble descent.\u201d(T/N: Father a lion, son cannot be a dog means that with a distinguished father, the son is sure to do well.)\u201cI wish Lawrence was as half as good as you,\u201d the emperor said with his eyes closed.\u201cIf he had tried to be loved by the empress, he would have already been the Crown Prince.\u201dMiraila\u2019s hand paused for a moment. The emperor raised one eyelid and looked at her and smiled.\u201cWhy? Are you going to be jealous again?\u201d\u201cIf I do, will you listen?\u201d Miraila said in a sulky voice.\u201cYou know that I can\u2019t help it. Lawrence too. He should have built up his own power and merit like Ced.\u201d\u201c.\u2026 Still, he is Your Majesty\u2019s son. \u201c\u201cYes. My only son.\u201dThe emperor muttered so and buried his face in Miraila\u2019s chest with a weary attitude.***It was the very next day that a messenger came running with an envelope bearing the imperial order.\u201cHis Majesty has given permission,\u201d Chancellor Lin said as he opened the envelope.In short, it meant covering up the bribery case and thoroughly digging into Count Eisen\u2019s case.\u201cI see,\u201d Cedric replied. He knew this would happen, but he still felt bitter.\u201cDo you feel bad?\u201d\u201cYes. I think the person who turns a blind eye to the money is no different from the main culprit. If it were a junior official who patrolled the gambling house they would have known most of the high-ranking positions. Aren\u2019t these people more evil than the main culprit?\u201d\u201cBut I can\u2019t touch it right now. There are too many people who have been bribed. It is very likely that nobles and officials will come together to cover each other and resist, and the case will be overshadowed.\u201d\u201cYes. \u201c\u201cIf His Majesty makes a strong decision, I would not know again. It\u2019s not a conspiracy, it\u2019s a simple crime, so you wouldn\u2019t want to bear that political burden.\u201d\u201cI think that Baron Yetz is pretty smart. Not only the high-ranking aristocrats, but the treasury and tax departments, as well as the junior officials of the police, are all intertwined. How can we handle it without being prepared to cut the Imperial Government itself? \u201cCedric sighed.\u201cIn the first place, His Majesty doesn\u2019t take this as important, and I\u2019m sure he\u2019s probably thinking of just keeping the bribe ledger. My fianc\u00e9e said that weaknesses are the most powerful weapons when hidden.\u201dA gun is scary when aimed, and a newly sharpened knife is the sharpest before use.\u201cHis Majesty is a relentless one. Whether a million or a thousand die at his feet, unless the throne tilts, it\u2019s like stealing wheat from a warehouse for him. He may be angry, but it\u2019s not a big deal that His Majesty himself can make up his mind while taking on something.\u201dArtizea said so.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Do you often talk about that with your fianc\u00e9e?\u201dCedric looked at Lin with an embarrassed face.She had already been exposed to the outside world too much. Newspapers had made noise that Cedric had found the trafficking site in the midst of looking for a proposal gift for her.As the case progressed, the words seemed to fade for a while, but as soon as Count Eisen\u2019s affairs were revealed, her name began to reappear.Artizea didn\u2019t seem to mind.However, contrary to the request to strictly protect the White family, she isolated herself.Cedric hated it.Apart from trusting Lin personally and as a servant of the empire, he did not want to be sloppy. However, when Lin asked, it was impossible not to answer.\u201cIt\u2019s not like this has nothing to do with her.\u201d\u201cI know that the Lady Rosan is still young, but she has great insight. Well, the Marchioness Rosan is also smart in certain areas if you take away her hysterical temper. Instinctively, she knows how to get what she wants.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dIt was about Artizea\u2019s parents, so Cedric refused to talk.\u201cDo you feel skeptical about politics?\u201d Lin asked gently.\u201cA little bit.\u201d Cedric responded bluntly.He didn\u2019t know it before, but the fact that this incident was nothing to the emperor gave Cedric an unfamiliar realization of futility.When Cedric himself was in check, he did not realize it was his problem.It was a dangerous law for those who hold military power. In addition, he was the child of parents related to royalty, who died tragically for accusations of treason.However, in this case there was no object to be held in check. It seemed like a completely accidental incident, thanks to the circumstances Artizea had made.Lin is only a servant of the emperor and is only tasked with dealing with the trafficking case.If he had to keep it in check, it would be Cedric again, but Cedric has never been involved in domestic politics up until now.Therefore, this was a purely public issue.Nevertheless, the emperor seemed to be thinking of only using Cedric\u2019s work to strengthen his own power.\u201cBut that\u2019s the politics of Krates. We are not doing the right thing to cover up disputes, not using the finances efficiently, but we are running away from the people\u2019s will by weighing in the wishes of the emperor.\u201d\u201cDoesn\u2019t the Chancellor feel skeptical about it?\u201d\u201cI shouldn\u2019t feel that way.\u201d\u201cSo why do you ask me if I feel skeptical?\u201dLin kept his mouth shut.There was a moment of silence. Lin changed the topic.\u201cIt is rather fortunate that the Grand Duke was able to cover up the bribe case.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201dCedric asked back. Lin replied.\u201cAs far as we know from the inside story, Lord Lawrence and Grand Duke Roygar were also hit by this incident. Grand Duke Roygar not only lost an important source of funding, but was also weakened by His Majesty the Emperor. He was favored by his Majesty.\u201d\u201cYes, I know.\u201d\u201cThe blow that Lord Lawrence suffered because of Count Eisen is not to mention great as well. Not only did he gain a bad reputation, he must have hated His Majesty. Considering that Count Eisen was rejected, he probably also suffered a blow to his fund line.\u201d\u201cI would assume so.\u201d\u201cIf the bribery case was made big, there will be many people who think that the Grand Duke has dug this up for Lord Lawrence. But since we\u2019ve covered up the bribery case, Lord Lawrence is the only one left. It\u2019s a shame, but the emperor punished Lord Lawrence instead and cut off his power.\u201dAnd at the same time, rumors spread that he was engaged to Artizea.People will now never say that the engagement was a marriage alliance between Lawrence and Cedric.It worked out as she promised. Cedric was brought to central politics by imprinting important figures of the Lawrence faction.But it started out by accident, so Lawrence would not see him as an enemy.Did Artizea predict this far? It\u2019s a mystery.\u201cIsn\u2019t your fianc\u00e9e sad?\u201d\u201cYes. She told me to follow the path that I thought was right. She knows what I need to do now more than anyone else.\u201d\u201cYour fianc\u00e9e has good sense. Do not let go of that hand, Your Grace. It is rare for a person in your position to find genuine affection and trust, not politics.\u201d\u201cYes, I know.\u201dThere was a stifled sigh in Cedric\u2019s heart as he answered.It was when this began to escalate, and Freil said the same thing for a completely different reason.[You must not lose the Lady Rosan, Your Grace. I feel it is too dangerous to pass her onto others. Honestly, it\u2019s creepy to think that Lady used to be Lawrence\u2019s support.]Cedric agreed rationally to the remark. But the sentiment was opposed.Whenever he thought of Artizea, Cedric was caught in a strange mood.His heart seemed to be pounding and he felt excited.She is only 18 years old now. She was still young. It was the age to be protected.Looking at those pale and slender wrists, he thought it would be right not to talk about the situation and ask for advice, but to wrap her into a warm flower blanket and put her on a sofa on a sunny day.He wanted to take care of her. Although he needed her advice, she wasn\u2019t a tool to be used.But more than anyone else, Artizea treated herself that way. It was frustrating, but he felt upset because he couldn\u2019t do anything about it.****Scratch scratchThe sound of the quills scratching the rough paper was irritating.Bill groaned and looked at the original again, drawing a stroke as if he were sewing stitch by stitch.\u201cShiiiiiit\u2026\u2026.\u201dHe had been stuck in a narrow closet for nearly a month, copying an unreadable ancient text book he was given by Artizea.He felt like his wrists and fingers were going to come off. His eyes hurt, too, and he felt like he would vomit just by smelling paper and ink.It could have been fortunate if it had ended there.Having been trapped here, he could hardly grasp how the Marquisate of Rosan\u2019s mansion was doing.However, he could tell that there were a lot of people.Most of the servants, perhaps Bill\u2019s closest associates, had disappeared.Instead, it seemed that the old employees he had put in the corner of the former Marquis\u2019 estate or villa were asked to return.The maids have also changed quite a bit. In particular, a lot of maids who do chores such as cleaning and laundry have changed, and more and more maids wore luxurious clothing.Most of the high-ranking maids would have followed Miraila to the annexes, and all of them would be newly hired maids to serve Artizea.Jacob, who had been shrugging his shoulders for a while, could not be seen from some point.\u201cI can\u2019t believe she was such a scary girl.\u201dAs she muttered to herself, Alice, who had just opened the door and came in, snorted.\u201cOh, it\u2019s wrong to guess the master funnyly.\u201d\u201cAlice you\u2026!\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know why she told me to give you afternoon tea.\u201dAlice was in a merry mood.Rize, who came behind her, pushed the papers piled up on the narrow desk with her hands, threw them on the floor, and set the tea tray.Bill jumped up.\u201cHey you!\u201d\u201cWho is this man?\u201dRize raised her eyes and looked at Bill.Bill rolled his feet. However, he couldn\u2019t reach out and just cursed.\u201cWow, now you\u2019re ignoring me? Hey, Alice, are you still standing with this?\u201d\u201cWhy? It\u2019s better than the usual hustle and bustle. Are you a nobleman? Did you hire me? If you don\u2019t like it, don\u2019t drink it.\u201dAs soon as Alice said so, Rize picked up the tray.\u201cHey!\u201dBill shouted again.\u201cNo, no. I was wrong. I\u2019m sorry, so put it down.\u201d\u201cRize.\u201d\u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t understand why we are taking care of a criminal.\u201dRize said plainly. Alice sighed.Bill changed his expression and called Alice with an earnest voice.\u201cLet me see the lady.\u201d\u201cWhat are you going to say after seeing my lady?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll apologize for doing something wrong.\u201d\u201cTell me 10 things that you\u2019ve done wrong, starting with the worst offenses.\u201dBill bit his lips. And made a careful choice.\u201cIgnoring the lady\u2026?\u201d\u201cWrong.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026 I misunderstood the lady\u2026.?\u201d\u201cIt looks like it will be about the third. Think carefully. I\u2019ll talk to her.\u201d\u201cThis!\u201dBill handed out a four-folded paper to Alice who was about to go back.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cSelf-reflection.\u201dRize laughed outright, but Bill spoke with a straight face.\u201cPlease tell her that I really mean it.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dAlice accepted it with a puzzled look.****Artizea, who received the reflection, smiled.\u201cEven though he has a bad temper, he worked as the Marquis Rosan\u2019s general butler for several years. There\u2019s one thing he\u2019s good at.\u201d\u201cRubbing his hands?\u201d\u201cMy mother is capricious. Matching her personality for more than 10 years is a talent if you call it a gift.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a talent that is only harmful in everything.\u201dAlice grumbled.\u201cWill you just let him go? Can\u2019t he be fired?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll just leave him until the day I leave this house. If I leave only the chief maid and the butler, my mother won\u2019t care. I\u2019m just preparing for it now.\u201d\u201cBut even if the lady took the ledger and the key and made a copy of the book like that, it would be a big blow.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to close your eyes, right? And it\u2019s still useless for Bill.\u201dAs Artizea said so, she turned over the papers that Bill had copied the day before.The ancient script is difficult to master. Bill wouldn\u2019t know what he wrote even if he spent a year on it.Of the papers, she picked the most plausible ones.Bill will think that what he was copying is an old book. He would believe Artizea brought that book with these intricate texts to harass him.Of course, Artizea wasn\u2019t doing it because of her petty revenge.The purpose of this work was to prevent Bill from doing anything else.Rather, it was to make a book so that the handwriting would not be revealed.It wouldn\u2019t even be Bill\u2019s handwriting. Because Bill is not writing letters, but drawing pictures.And just in time today, the pages she wanted were gathered.Artizea hand-tied it and entrusted it to Rize.\u201cTake this and put it in the library. The east corner is good.\u201d\u201cThis one?\u201dRize tilted her head. Alice then said.\u201cWhen the lady speaks, you don\u2019t have to wonder why. Because she tells you everything you need to know.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dRize responded obediently and went outside with the book. Alice said again.\u201cYou have to hurry now. It\u2019s afternoon tea time.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d\u201cReally, a day like this is coming. My lady is going to greet guests at tea time. Come on. You have to change clothes.\u201dAlice rejoiced as she put her fluttering hands together.Artizea nodded grimly and looked out the window. It was sunny. Perfect for holding a tea party in the garden.It was a very good day to get the job done.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 30": "Chapter 30Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 30Translator: effefilleProofreader: xoxomonamiArtizea stopped by the Tuvalet room for a while before going to the terrace where the tea party was prepared.Now, her Tuvalet room was overflowing with flowers and gifts.Sophie greeted Artizea.\u201cWelcome, Miss. Are you going to change your clothes?\u201d\u201cNo. I just came to check. Are all of these flowers gifts?\u201d\u201cYes. I brought the ones from the Grand Duke of Evron to the bedroom, and I wrote down exactly who sent the gifts. Among the rest of the gifts, flowers and lace from the women were decorated on the terrace today.\u201d\u201cAnd? \u201c\u201cIt was discussed with the butler to separate the gifts received from men over the age of 40 years old. Additionally, expensive gifts such as jewelry or those from unmarried young men were all returned.\u201dSophie responded nervously, unsure of whether she may have acted out of line.\u201cFor the wedding, I have made a list of items in need of attention and put it in the warehouse for you to check and decide at a later time.\u201d\u201cWell done.\u201dArtizea replied lightly.Sophie relaxed and laughed. Sophie was hired as the chore maid of the Marquess Rosan, but was assigned to Artizea\u2019s maid for her interest in dressing up.It was one of the few occasions that Bill treated Artizea as the lady of the house.Even if she was a maid serving a lady, the salary she received was no different from that of a servant maid.When there was short of work, she was called to the laundry room that everyone hates. It was not a treatment for the maid who aids the lady that was going to be the successor.Sophie liked Artizea, so she wasn\u2019t dissatisfied with how poorly she had been treated..But Artizea had often been ignored and only had shabby clothing in her possession, so Sophie always felt sorry for her.The situation then turned over within a month, Bill was kicked out and his employer changed.The rude ones were expelled, and all important positions were filled with people who were polite to Artizea.Most of them were from the Hanson family, who changed their name, and former employees who were close to them.Invitations and flowers arrived like a mountain every day to the young lady.It was rewarding to have served the lady through tough times, because both Sophie and Alice were recognized as Artizea\u2019s closest aids.She was also in charge of the full wardrobe, jewelry, and Tuvalet room that overflowed with flowers and gifts.Some people used the gifts as a bribe for Artizea asking to deliver letters to Cedric.It seemed that the heavens and earth had opened up.At first, she also felt anxious. She was afraid that Miraila and Lawrence would come back anytime and overturn everything.But now she was just proud. As far as Sophie, who is only a maid, knows, Artizea is now a celebrity in the social world.Politics and public opinion were infested with the case of Baron Yetz, but it was not the only topic in the social world. Grand Duke Evron\u2019s engagement couldn\u2019t help but make headlines.Cedric has always worked in the interest of the people as he grew up and eventually taken over the title. Who will be Grand Duke Evron\u2019s relative? Who will occupy the shield of the North and the hero of the West.Refreshingly, few people talked about Cedric himself in that engagement.The part to be interested in Cedric was the fame and influence he gained from this incident rather than the engagement.On the other hand, Artizea suddenly became a socialite celebrity as much despite her lack of involvement.Whether Cedric decides to join hands with Lawrence, and what will happen to the Duke\u2019s wealth? Even with that alone, the nobles could debate all night long.As such, Artizea\u2019s name was mentioned a lot. People wanted to know what she was like.The women told more romantic stories than what existed.There was no one who did not wonder how she became connected with Cedric.It was all wonderful. From meeting by chance due to a damaged carriage in a suburban temple; to Cedric and Artizea dancing at a Duke\u2019s ball; a proposal gift that sparked the case of Baron Yetz; and a year\u2019s worth of dresses from Emily\u2019s boutique.Even the young men of marriageable age showed interest as if they had found a pearl on the beach.Some men asked Artizea for a date or sent gifts.Artizea dismissed such interest. Sophie thought it was terribly strange.She\u2019s known for a long time that Artizea doesn\u2019t show her feelings much.But still, it wasn\u2019t really stupid.Sophie used to think that Artizea was just a young, immature girl.But one day, Artizea suddenly became really calm.Though she had experienced a lot throughout her childhood, it seemed as if all of that disappeared.Even the beautiful gifts that would have made her heart flutter in the past were no different from a cobblestone on the side of the road.It was a pity for Sophie.\u201cI\u2019ll do you a new hairstyle, my lady.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. It\u2019s just a light tea time.\u201d\u201cYes. It\u2019s your first time hosting a tea party like this.\u201dArtizea smiled.\u201cIt\u2019s a common thing for the guests.\u201d\u201cThen wait a minute.\u201dSophie rearranged her dress again. Artizea flinched when Sophie slightly pulled up her sleeves to reveal her bracelet.\u201cThese days, the shorter sleeves are in style.\u201d\u201c\u2026..\u201d\u201cBecause it\u2019s gotten a lot hotter. It will be summer soon.\u201dArtizea did not answer. But her cheeks were a little red.Sophie became satisfied. The bracelet was fine, and it was good that the Lady was engaged to a nice man. And more than that, it was good that Artizea\u2019s face changed like a girl when she talked about it.***Guests had already arrived on the terrace.Among them, Artizea and Miel, the daughter of Keshore, were the only ones that were really acquainted. Artizea was the first to greet her among the other four guests.\u201cWelcome, Lady Miel.\u201d\u201cHello, Lady Artizea. I\u2019m glad you invited me here.\u201dMiel smiled brightly, greeted and held Artizea\u2019s hand.\u201cHow are you today?\u201d\u201cMaybe because of the good weather, I\u2019m in great shape. I can even accept Lady Artizea\u2019s invitation like this. I used the bath product that you gave me last time. Once I put it in the water, afterwards, my hands and feet were so nice and warm. I was able to walk for a long time.\u201d\u201cEven in the hot weather, I feel much better after some warm water.\u201d\u201cThank you for always taking care of me. I don\u2019t know if my father fully conveyed my gratitude. Oh, this is my cousin Hazel.\u201dThe girl who was waiting next to Miel greeted her with a reddish face.\u201cHello, Lady Rosan.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you. I am Artizea Rosan.\u201dArtizea bowed politely, bending slowly at the waist.\u201cThank you for inviting me. I really wanted to meet you.\u201dHazel greeted her as if she was seeing a childhood friend whom she hasn\u2019t seen in years.Neither Miel nor Artizea knew much of the guests because they were hardly socializing.The other guests who were invited this time were introduced by Hazel, as the two people had a small social range. All were girls of marriageable age.Of course, they weren\u2019t really unknown to Artizea.She knew most of the socialites, so she had basic information about all the guests.Some of these people didn\u2019t have any special biographies, but some would become a noble lady in the future.Artizea was particularly interested in Hazel.Hazel was intelligent, had a good memory, and was sociable. And was rather snobbish.She knew that Hazel would show off her personal connections without being offensive, and she was also a player in spreading news.She wasn\u2019t a bad person to get close to.Artizea and the guests sat down. All the guests looked at her outfit and the mansion with twinkling eyes.Although Artizea\u2019s dress looked modest, it was made of luxurious cotton fabric.The undecorated design looked rather classy, \u200b\u200band the diamond bracelet over her slender wrist was rather emphasized.The eyes of some of the guests quietly passed through the bracelet. It seemed to be the bracelet that was widely rumored to be given by Cedric as an engagement gift.As news of their engagement came out in a newspaper article, two-line diamond bracelets became popular as a gesture for love in the last month.Wasn\u2019t it a gem whose name circulated as the Saintess Olga\u2019s heart, that started the incident?It was not just diamond bracelets, a second line of crystal bracelets that were being sold at a commoner\u2019s price was also being used as a gift for marriage proposals and was thus being sold in large quantities.\u201cSo it turns out that Sir Alphonse isn\u2019t here. I heard that he\u2019s always around.\u201dSomeone asked with curiosity.It was also a famous story that Cedric sent the strongest and most reliable man among the Knights of Evron to Artizea.\u201cYes. He\u2019s not here today because he\u2019s on urgent business.\u201dIt was then. A maid came running to her.\u201cLady! Lady!\u201d\u201cWhat are you making such a fuss about? Can\u2019t you see the guests?\u201dArtizea rebuked the maid. But the maid said urgently, turning pale.\u201cThe Madam is back!\u201dThere was a loud noise from outside. She heard Bill yelling and someone screaming.Artizea stood up from her seat at a slow pace. It was because she didn\u2019t want to look strange to others.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019ll be away for a moment.\u201d\u201cAh yes.\u201dMiel had a pale face, not knowing what to do.It was when Artizea had just opened the terrace door. Miraila was right there.\u201cMother.\u201dMiraila looked at Artizea with an angry face.From behind, a maid was clinging onto the hem of Miraila\u2019s dress after repeatedly informing her that Artizea was entertaining guests.Artizea laid her eyes down with a calm face.Miraila\u2019s gaze glanced from head to toe. After that, she saw the flowers and lace on the terrace.\u201cThere are rumors that you caught a man and you\u2019ve been very spoiled.\u201dMiraila said sharply.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She intended for Artizea to live without getting married or ever leaving the mansion.There was enough money to spend until her death.So, it was best to just live with housework and embroidery.But isn\u2019t it important for Lawrence?However, she was going to soothe Artizea well, and get her to ask Cedric to speak well with Lawrence.She knew that Cedric was a man of principle, but he was still a man.The man before knowing a girl and the man after knowing a girl are two completely different people.Even Miraila knew that Cedric despised her.But look. Don\u2019t you fall in love with my daughter?It was impossible to know what would happen to the relationship between man and woman.But Miraila didn\u2019t think it would last long.By now, he must have been obssessed by her daughter\u2019s charm like a man possessed.And that kind of love doesn\u2019t last long. In Miraila\u2019s experience, this especially applied to young men.So, she was going to allow it. If necessary, she was going to teach her how to seduce a man and how to keep his love for a long time.If you want to do well, you must do it right.Artizea could be the Grand Duchess. Miraila herself gave birth to her and raised her not as an illegitimate child but as the Marquis\u2019 daughter.Grand Duchess Evron, didn\u2019t it just sound cool? As the emperor said, it will be of great help to Lawrence.She came all the way here with that mindset.But when she saw the mansion completely changed, her eyes turned upside down.Artizea was different as if she had transformed into a butterfly.Miraila\u2019s eyes weren\u2019t good enough to recognize that the seeds in it were the same.All she saw was that her daughter, who had not long ago been docile and sloppy, was buried among the flowers sent by a man, while changing into the clothes a man bought her one morning.\u201cMad girl!\u201dMiraila\u2019s eyes turned red as she screamed and grabbed Artizea\u2019s hair.\u201cAaahh!\u201dThe guests screamed in horror and stood up from their seats.Even the man who was watching with his eyes shining for something exciting would happen, was astonished by the excessive violence and did not know what to do.\u201cWhat did I say? Didn\u2019t I say that a stupid and ugly bitch like yourself should just sit in the corner of the house and live while breathing and embroidering!\u201dThe silver pins on her head were scattered on the floor.Artizea couldn\u2019t scream and closed her eyes tightly. Then Miraila pulled and dragged her away.She has never resisted since she was very young. When she resisted, Miraila was more heinous. The abuse would only grow longer.As the front of her eyes became dark, her legs loosened.She didn\u2019t know what it would be like to fight like a crazy person, but she had never tried.Getting used to it was a scary thing itself.She was a villain of the world who had thousands and tens of thousands of deaths on her hands. However, in front of her mother, it was no different from when she was two years old when she pinched her skin till it peeled off and then reached out for a hug.\u201cYou should know how to be grateful for me for giving birth to you! But now that you have a man caught in the middle of your eyes, you decide to stab your mother in the back?!\u201d\u201cPlease be patient, Madam!\u201d\u201cPatient? Should I be patient? Should I be patient with my daughter?!\u201d\u201cAhh!\u201dMiraila shouted and smacked the maid who held her arm. The maid sat down on the floor and grabbed Miraila\u2019s leg.\u201cMadam, madam!\u201dMiel cried mournfully to stop, but it did not go into Miraila\u2019s ear.Miel, who was inherently weak and frail in character, was so surprised that she couldn\u2019t breathe properly and collapsed.Hazel was surprised and supported Miel.\u201cDoctor! Call the doctor! Miel, Miel?\u201d\u201cMadam Rosan, stop!\u201dEven among the startled guests, a person intervened and tried to stop them.Miraila pushed with her hand and pulled Artizea off the terrace.And threw her to the lobby.\u201cWhat did I say!? I told you not to be a bitch! Crazy bitch, this stupid bitch!\u201dMiraila squeezed Artizea\u2019s head, and hit her face. And she shook Artizea\u2019s head again.\u201cDo you think you can live in comfort because you\u2019re a girl?! Get clothes from a man, get a bouquet, get a gift of jewelry, do you think you are something? Huh?\u201dHit!The sound of a kick rang in the lobby. All of the employees fled, trembling.The only ones left in the lobby was Miraila and Artizea. The maid that was hit had also run away.\u201cWho gave birth to you and gave your life?! You dare to smack the back of my head like this?! You can\u2019t go anywhere! If you want to run away, give back the life I gave you!\u201d\u201cLady!\u201dAlice, who arrived late, shielded the crouching Artizea.Artizea pushed Alice away even in such a state.Miraila quickly struck Alice with a basket, pulled her out and pushed her back.Even in that situation, Alice didn\u2019t raise her hand.Because if she accidentally scratched Miraila\u2019s body, it was the same as asking the emperor to kill her.At that time, the front door opened up.\u201cQuickly!\u201dRize, who hurried in, stopped breathing at what was happening in the lobby.Cedric, who hastily followed her, opened his eyes wide.Rize was quick-witted. As soon as she heard that Miraila had come, without thinking twice, she went to ask for the Grand Duke Evron\u2019s help.And just in time, she ran into Cedric who was at home.\u201cLady!\u201dRize reacted before the frozen Cedric. She ran and hugged Alice.Alice cried out loud.\u201cPlease save her!\u201dMiraila grabbed Artizea\u2019s arm and dragged her.Cedric stepped up and grabbed Miraila\u2019s wrist.\u201cLet go of this hand.\u201d\u201cWho invited you to enter someone else\u2019s house?! Get out! Get out now!\u201dMiraila screamed in a shrill voice.\u201cGet out!\u201d\u201cI told you to let go of this hand.\u201dCedric said in a voice repressed with anger.Miraila spoke to him in a hateful voice as if spitting at him.\u201cWhy would anyone interfere when a mother is teaching her daughter a lesson?\u201d\u201cWhat education is this?\u201d\u201cOr what else!? Whatever I do with my daughter is up to me! Ahhhh!\u201dCedric gave his hand some strength. Miraila screamed in pain as if her arm were breaking.Artizea\u2019s arm fell down as the strength from Miraila\u2019s hand loosened.Cedric pushed away Miraila.\u201c\u2026 No.\u201cArtizea whispered through a breathless sound, as if trying to endure the pain.\u201cIf my mother gets hurt, you\u2019ll be in trouble.\u201dCedric took off the cloak he was wearing and covered her head first.Her hair was ripped off, and her face was left with a red mark. The dress was torn, too, and her shoulders and arms were covered with blood.He opened his cloak and hid Artizea\u2019s body.There was a difference in height, so even a cloak that came near his calf was enough to fit Artizea\u2019s body.\u201cYour Grace.\u201d\u201cStay still.\u201dThen Cedric carried Artizea.He already knew from feeling it when she danced, but her skinny body was lighter than it looked.Miraila blocked his path.\u201cPut her down. It\u2019s my daughter.\u201d\u201c\u2026..\u201dCedric tried to move away from her without even responding. Miraila grabbed him and shouted out.\u201cIt\u2019s mine whether I decide to kill her or let her live!\u201d\u201cNot anymore.\u201dCedric replied in a low growl. Then he pushed her hand roughly and made his way out.In the background, came the shouts of Miraila\u2019s raucous roar.Cedric walked quickly out of the estate.The knights who followed him politely bowed their heads. Cedric ordered.\u201cThe Lady will move in from today. Take control of the Rosan mansion. Keep every single employee in custody so that the Lady may dispose of them herself later.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThere was concern that the emperor would intervene. However, Freil didn\u2019t dare to say anything.As long as Cedric was determined.Anyway, now that Lawrence had a major accident, even the emperor would not be able to recklessly protect Miraila.After hearing Freil\u2019s answer, Cedric climbed onto the horse holding her as he didn\u2019t want to use a carriage if it came from this mansion.Artizea panted and struggled hard to say.\u201cAlice, Alice\u2026.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Freil will take good care of her.\u201d\u201cAt home, there were guests. Lady Miel is weak\u2026\u201d\u201cFreil will also take care of that for you.\u201dCedric bit his lips.\u201cYou should worry about yourself.\u201dIn his arms, Artizea was straining for a while.But it wasn\u2019t long before she resigned. He felt relieved when he saw her lose consciousness.Cedric looked into her face, curled up in his cloak.In some areas, the skin was broken and the flesh had fallen off from the long nails that tore through her. The bruises and blood made her appear badly beaten, and her unconscious face was pale with a new blue color.Artizea said that she could not wait until she inherited the title of Rosan nor could she choose a suitable man. Cedric felt that he really understood it now.If it wasn\u2019t for him who held her hand right now, Artizea probably knew she would have been killed. Not because of wealth or position, but simply because of the mad mother\u2019s anger.It\u2019s foolish to ask why she didn\u2019t fight back. She must have been terrified.From birth, she must have been treated like this. Beating the trauma from childhood was difficult.There are things that can\u2019t be done no matter how wise and noble people are. Cedric believed in the power of the will, but he wasn\u2019t foolish enough to believe that it would solve everything.Artizea needed him.The bottom of his chest seemed to be twisting and cracking. Still, his heart shook with that fact.Something rattled down his throat. Cedric wanted to spit it out, but he still didn\u2019t know exactly what it was.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

There was a white one-piece pajamas on her body.There was a fire in the fireplace. She heard the sound of firewood burning.Heating in this weather was unusual, but it was good enough for Artizea\u2019s body who was in the middle of a cold.Artizea wriggled her hands and feet while lying still. Her knees and shins hurt, and her arms and shoulders stung.So did her face. Artizea tried to graze the wound on her mouth that she got from having been slapped in the face.What was different from other times she was beaten, was that her eyes were not sore. It looked like someone had wiped her face.She slowly sat up.It wasn\u2019t just certain parts of her body, but the muscles and joints of her shoulders and limbs also hurt. It seemed that her body was under even more pressure because of how nervous she was feeling.And she thinks she fainted. Her last memory was of Cedric grabbing Miraila\u2019s arm.She doesn\u2019t think she passed out right after that though.Even so, she never lost her memory in this way.It wasn\u2019t really that big of a deal, but could the situation really have been so nerve wracking that it caused her to faint?She had broken up an embankment, spread a plague, dealt with the Pirate King of the South Sea over the southern city of the Empire.Even at that time, there had never been a situation where she fainted.Artizea carefully got out of bed.Then she stroked her face once with her palm. Her cheekbones hurt.\u201cPhew\u2026.\u201dShe sighed. She wanted to see the mirror, but she didn\u2019t actually want to see it. She was certain it must be terrible.To think that such a face was seen by Cedric. She felt an unfamiliar melancholy.She had no memory, so there was no way to know for certain.Artizea sighed.The memory that seemed to be overloaded is probably because of the complexity in her head.But that was the end for today.It was then, the sound of a knock on the door was heard.She didn\u2019t answer, but the other person opened the door silently as if it was just a formality.It was Ansgar.When he saw Artizea standing up, he put the wash basin and towel he brought in on the table near the door, and politely bowed.\u201cI am Ansgar, the butler of the Grand Duke Evron.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dArtizea replied, suppressing the soaring feelings into her throat.But she couldn\u2019t stand it all, so she said it again in a tone full of emotions.\u201cYes, I know.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s an honor to meet you. Ced has told us of how nice it would be for the Lady Heiress to stay here until the situation is settled.\u201d\u201cYes, I am grateful.\u201d\u201cThank you for your understanding. The mansion is still a little cluttered. Normally, it\u2019s a space where only soldiers come and go. We started cleaning it only last month.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll serve you during your stay here. If you have any needs, you can tell me anything.\u201dAs Ansgar said so, he approached Artizea with a towel soaked in warm water.Instead of leaving her face to Ansgar, Artizea accepted the towel.\u201cThe doctor said that you were too traumatized and lost consciousness. Most of the wounds on the body are partial traumas, so you\u2019ll be able to recover in no time. I will bring a hand mirror.\u201d\u201cNo. It\u2019s okay\u2026\u2026. I don\u2019t want to see it.\u201d\u201cYes. It is said that it will leave no scar. So you don\u2019t have to worry about it.\u201d\u201cYes. \u201cArtizea replied vaguely.It\u2019s not that easy to be beaten to death by one\u2019s bare hand. More so with a woman\u2019s hands.Miraila was stronger than Artizea, but she was still just a lady.The heaviest of the things that hand could have held would be, at best, the emperor\u2019s coat.It was not common to get hit like yesterday. But it certainly wasn\u2019t her first time.Artizea carefully wiped her face with the warm, wet towel. The front and corners of her eyes, and the stinging areas on her forehead and cheeks were also gently wiped.\u201cThe Lady\u2019s maids are also in this mansion. They might be unpacking now. Would you like me to call for them?\u201d Ansgar asked, gently.The reason Ansgar dared to ask was because Artisea\u2019s condition seemed very bad.Many decent nobles hated to show such vulnerability.And this young lady must have been more noble than her mother or brother.Ansgar noticed that she swallowed her emotions down her throat on several occasions, but he hid his sorry feelings.The person in front of him is Cedric\u2019s fianc\u00e8e, who will soon become the Duchess. So, as the butler, he was not qualified to show sympathy.\u201cWhat about Alice?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re talking about the maid who is close to the Lady. I heard that her injury was just a sprained wrist. She said she wanted to stand by you, but she looked very tired so I told her to go and rest.\u201d\u201cOkay, thank you for the consideration.\u201dArtizea now replied with a completely calm and contemplative face.\u201cWhat is Marcus doing? I know that he was entrusted with the mansion by the Grand Duke Evron.\u201d\u201cSir Marcus Hanson is now working to sort out some affairs for the Lady. Ced left the Knights behind.\u201d\u201cThe Knights are too much\u2026 \u201cArtizea muttered. But now, she was very exhausted, that her thoughts flowed out of her head like it was someone else\u2019s work.Even if it is something you know and are familiar with, she never adapted to the physical abuse and the pain. Neither did her mind.Playing an instrument or learning a sword would result in calluses to your hand, but Artizea thought that it would never happen to her mind as well.Anyway, the work at the Marquis\u2019s mansion wasn\u2019t an important issue right now.\u201cI\u2019ll bring you a simple meal. Eat a little something and think about what you\u2019re going to do today.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think I want to eat that much now. More than a meal\u2026 can you make a cup of tea?\u201d\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll be right back.\u201dAnsgar quietly stepped back.Artizea realized she has a dazed face.Ansgar quietly doused her towel with water again.Artizea took it and buried her face in it. She felt much better because of it.\u201cThank you, Ansgar.\u201dShe returned the towel from her face to Ansgar.Then she acknowledged Cedric, who was standing at the door.\u201cIt\u2019s okay for Your Grace to come in. Unless you\u2019re afraid of my face for being too ugly.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve never thought about that.\u201d Cedric said, stuttering.\u201cI already know that you don\u2019t care about other people\u2019s looks.\u201d Artizea smiled.It wasn\u2019t that he didn\u2019t care about it at all. Originally, her face wasn\u2019t very pretty, but she got bruised and even scabs.On top of it, it was filled with tears, so she will surely not be able to see him with eyes wide open.But strangely, her heart was cool. After returning to the past, it seemed that a large boulder that had been placed on the edge of her chest had rolled and disappeared.But this wasn\u2019t wrong. She was going in the right direction. Be with the right people.Ansgar\u2019s tea flavour informed her of it.\u201cAre you feeling okay?\u201d\u201cYes I\u2019m fine. \u201c\u201cThank God.\u201dCedric was restless. Still, he could not settle his gaze on her, and the tips of his ears were red.\u201cDon\u2019t be like that. Sit down.\u201dArtizea offered him a seat.Cedric hesitated, then turned the chair next to the table and sat away from Artizea.Ansgar stepped back and walked out of the room.\u201cI\u2019m sorry for opening the door so recklessly. I was worried, so I stopped by before I left.\u201d\u201cThank you. Yesterday\u2026..\u201dArtizea said calmly.\u201cThank you for coming to help. I never thought you would come in person.\u201d\u201cWhen Rize came to call for someone, I happened to be in front of the mansion and ran into her.\u201dAs he answered so, Cedric realized.She never thought he\u2019d come in person. Conversely, it means that she was thinking that anyone would come.And this means that Artizea\u2019s \u2018thinking\u2019 was completely different from the way other people think.\u201cTia, as expected\u2026\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cThis situation, did you plan this?\u201dThe young man who was shy and couldn\u2019t make eye contact with the girl disappeared, and Grand Duke Evron became present.Although it was intense, as if looking into the abyss, his black eyes stared at Artizea.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I apologized to Lady Keshore and the other guests and sent them home. I asked why Alphonse wasn\u2019t next to you\u2026 and that\u2019s when a thought came to mind. How would you, the clever Aritzea, not know that Madam Rosan would appear.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cI told Alphonse to stay by your side. I know that it has a symbolic meaning that shows to others that I am always by your side and am protecting you even when I\u2019m not physically there.\u201dArtizea turned away from his sharp gaze. She couldn\u2019t figure out why he was upset.\u201cBut I couldn\u2019t get it out of my mind why you asked Alphonse to leave the house the day you invited guests. You knew that Madam Rosan was coming back that day? Did you?\u201d\u201cI mean\u2026 I don\u2019t know everything\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not the answer. Is this one of your schemes or not?\u201d\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dArtizea hesitated to answer.It was possible to make things up without telling him. However, it was disloyal to tell a lie when asked.\u201cYes.\u201dArtizea replied and glanced at Cedric.It wasn\u2019t something that she couldn\u2019t talk about. What she noticed was that Cedric was very angry.\u201cI didn\u2019t say it was to \u2018add more fire\u2019. I was simply inviting guests to match the day my mother would come back. And it was necessary.\u201dArtizea sighed a little, but she spoke honestly.Because she promised she would talk about it later when she was up to something.\u201cI wanted to make sure that I had an opportunity to completely cut off my relationship with the Madam of Rosan,\u201d Artizea said.Anyone who didn\u2019t know how much Miraila hated Artizea would know now.Anyone who saw her at the ball would also know that she was being treated poorly by the Marquis of Rosan\u2019s Madam.Nevertheless, however, people valued family ties.Anyone who didn\u2019t know her in person, or people outside the social circle, will say that no matter the situation is behind closed doors, one shouldn\u2019t treat their mother that way.Even those who knew, would think that the mother and daughter relationship could not easily be torn apart.\u201cAnd if there was no trigger, I couldn\u2019t get the title of Rosan right away. I took the keys and ledger from Bill, but the moveable property in the mansion\u2019s vault is only a small fraction.\u201d\u201cTia.\u201d\u201cIn the case of business management, estates, and other property in other areas, all of them are entrusted to the representatives, and the representatives are those chosen by His Majesty, the Emperor. Even if I get married and inherit the title, my mother would not give it up easily.\u201dHowever, as things have come to this end, neither the Emperor nor Lawrence will be able to take Miraila\u2019s side because of her actions.Don\u2019t pretend you don\u2019t know and give your daughter her legitimate rights.Until now, in front of the emperor, she acted more and more like a gentle filial daughter. Now the time has come to reap the fruit.\u201cIt\u2019s like I\u2019ve lost my dignity as someone to be the Great Duchess of Evron, but my reputation would have been broken anyway. It\u2019s better for me to be a poor girl than to do something like a court battle and splash muddy water to the Evron name.\u201dA battle for property between mother and daughter was also a battle against the emperor\u2019s government and its arms.Even the flowers that Miraila had on her head would become a topic of interest- enough for newspapers to write sensational articles about it.Artizea could not be left that way.Not for herself, but for the Grand Duchess of Evron.\u201cTia.\u201d\u201cThe fortune of the Marquis of Rosan is by no means small. It will be of great help to Your Grace in the future. Conversely, it is too big to keep in the hands of Brother Lawrence.\u201dCedric covered his face with his palm.\u201cSo you\u2019re saying that it was necessary for you to get beaten?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Artizea said so without any hesitation.It wasn\u2019t that she wasn\u2019t scared, but because it was necessary, she was willing to make the sacrifice. She\u2019s only put a little trick on what\u2019s about to happen.Then things went as they pleased, and she had to endure.\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about it since I went into bed last night about how I wouldn\u2019t be mad at you. I even opened my eyes this morning and reminded myself of that, but you\u2019re not making this easy.\u201dBut Cedric was really angry. Artizea could not understand it.\u201cWhy are you upset? I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t tell you in advance, but this was something that could really benefit you from a little effort. I didn\u2019t feel that it was worth talking about. No one was injured. I heard that Alice sprained her hand, but there wouldn\u2019t be any big injury.\u201dIt was Miraila who hit her, and the guests saw it. The only person that was unjustly harmed was Alice, who shielded her and was also badly beaten.In this matter, there was nothing that could violate Cedric\u2019s morality.\u201cAren\u2019t you hurt?\u201d Cedric said in a repressed voice.It was an unexpected remark. Artizea blinked a few times.\u201cTia, I\u2019m not angry because I thought there would be no reason for what you did. I\u2019m angry because you put yourself at risk.\u201d\u201cWell, I, it wasn\u2019t very dangerous, because I knew my mother would never have killed me,\u201d Artizea replied in a stutter.\u201cYou can\u2019t do that. You shouldn\u2019t use yourself as a tool. If you continue calculating in this way and things go according to plan, you\u2019ll end up giving your life someday. This is not how a person should be treated, even if it is your body,\u201d Cedric said in a low tone.Artizea couldn\u2019t say anything and looked at him.Because it really was so.She thought that she wouldn\u2019t waste the rest of her life this time.A life without limbs and no tongue, it would be meaningless to spend a few more years even with the help of someone.So, she wanted to use this life a little more usefully.Until now, Artizea had only perceived that her body was a cheap resource with little cost.No need for money to buy it, no effort to buy loyalty.She also priced loyalty. It was difficult to obtain a loyal person, and once consumed, that was the end.In addition, there was a limit to a person\u2019s willpower, so if you constantly ask for hard work, they\u2019ll cut you off.So you should buy loyalty, but carefully choose where to use it.Compared to that, her body was too simple.There was no complaint or fear of betrayal.So she was embarrassed. She\u2019s never heard such a thing before.Health, yes, everyone was concerned about health.She knew that Alice was always worried, and Sophie also kept notes.After establishing herself as the heir of the Marquis of Rosan, they were her employees. The flattering crowd was only concerned about her health with exaggerated remarks.Even Lawrence sent medicine.Because she was a difficult resource to replace.When she was very young, even Miraila took care of her when she was sick.But now, when she said \u201cit\u2019s necessary\u201d everyone would follow suit.Even Alice said, \u201cIf so, it can\u2019t be helped. \u201cAnd she would just take care of her with a sad face. It was the first time she was angry.Someone said that her body shouldn\u2019t be used as a tool.Someone said she was a person.\u201cI said clearly at first. If you want to join hands with me, you shouldn\u2019t hurt yourself either.\u201d\u201cAh.\u201dIt was funny when she heard it, but she had never really taken it in mind. So Artizea sighed briefly.Cedric glared at her.\u201cWere you not even thinking about it?\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dCedric moved and approached the bed.Artizea bowed her head.\u201cSorry.\u201dCedric grabbed her hand, which was lying on the blanket, casually. Then he wrapped it warmly with both hands.\u201cThere\u2019s another thing you\u2019ve done wrong.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dArtizea said in a crawling voice. Now there was no excuse.\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t behave like you caused me trouble.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve caused you any trouble. I\u2019m grateful for you. I didn\u2019t even think you\u2019d come directly\u2026\u201cBut actually, did you think I would send a few people without going directly myself after hearing the news? \u201cArtizea looked at him with a subtle look. She didn\u2019t think that way.Anyway, her plans included help coming from the Grand Duke of Evron.It was the result of considering Rize\u2019s quick-minded personality and that Marcus Hanson was trusted by Evron.But she didn\u2019t think Cedric would come.She didn\u2019t predict who was coming, who wasn\u2019t coming, no specific case.\u201cI did what I had to do. I know that you take this engagement as just in name, and you don\u2019t accept me as a real fianc\u00e9. If so, consider me as a companion.\u201d\u201cI am a body that has decided to serve your Grace as my master. Why would you say that\u2026.\u201d\u201cSo, why don\u2019t you want my protection? It may be your role to think and move, but it is my role to protect you.\u201d\u201c\u2026..\u201dArtizea bit her lower lip.\u201cNow, do you know what to say to me?\u201dIt was a little confusing.Artizea hesitated.She was good at seeing through people\u2019s minds and was always ready to get the results she wanted.But now what Cedric wants her to say was \u2018I\u2019m sorry.\u2019 or \u2018thank you\u2019.Eventually, she said with a new reddish face, \u201cI was happy you came to save me.\u201dIt was a shameful thing for her to say to others.Cedric\u2019s face turned red just like her.But he didn\u2019t let go of her hand. Rather, he gave it strength to hold it tighter.Artizea lowered her head.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It couldn\u2019t be boring because there was even a little romance and politics sprinkled on it.The rumors flared up as the papers published a story from a man who worked as an employee in Marquisate of Rosan.This made Cedric a hero who saved people on two different occasions. One of them was saving his poor lover.And that girl would now be the Marchioness of Rosan and also marry him.People also paid attention to how the emperor would respond.Neither side was convinced that this would diminish Miraila\u2019s favor.The emperor\u2019s attitude of Miraila was similar to caring for a mean cat where it would sometimes get angry or act terribly.However, no matter what she did, he did not get angry for long. He would smile bitterly, hug her and say, \u2018it can\u2019t be helped because she\u2019s a foolish woman.\u2019But Artizea had a different problem.Many people speculated that Artizea made a disturbance by causing a scandal with Miraila.The emperor didn\u2019t. He simply responded to Cedric\u2019s petition letter in a civil manner.The petition letter was about Cedric\u2019s request for permission to become the guardian for Lady Rosan as her fianc\u00e9.The letter didn\u2019t even mention Miraila a bit. There was no story about the fight between Miraila and Artizea.Originally, it was the parents who represented the legal authority of the young successor before marriage.So, originally, it was impossible for him to be his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s guardian while her mother was alive.However, the emperor stamped a seal on the document that allowed the guardianship without saying anything.And in a personal position, he spoke with an air of pity on Artizea.\u201cTia is a kind and timid child. She\u2019s very filial. If Miraila gave her a little sweetness, she would have paid her back ten or twenty times. It\u2019s totally different from the kids I\u2019ve been hoping for these days. How could you not be shocked to treat that little girl like that? Miraila did too much.\u201dAnd this is what he said about Miraila.\u201cMiraila has a hot temper, so if she gets angry, she can\u2019t see what\u2019s in front of her. But, it\u2019s all my fault. If I really treated Tia like a daughter, she wouldn\u2019t have gone so far. Even though she said that there was no need for that, I guess the misunderstanding between the mother and the daughter has led to this.\u201dThis wasn\u2019t a reaction he had in public, but an intimate thought that he confessed while with his daughter, Countess Eunice.[Lady Rosan,When Father said that the Lady was weak, I almost said no.However, I did that because it would be a favor for the Lady who didn\u2019t say anything. I believe this has been a reward for your last advice.Father said that the Lady is still young, but one day she will be able to understand the sincerity of Madame Rosan\u2019s feelings.He pitied both of them, and was rather angry with Lawrence. He failed to mediate between Lady and the Madame and allowed the situation to escalate.There is something I would like to add to that as well, but I will save it for the day when I meet the Lady someday.Anyway, Madame Rosan did something stupid. Had this not happened, Cedric would not have advocated to manage the estate and property of the Marquisate of Rosan.After being scolded for Count Eisen\u2019s troubles, Lawrence has been out of sight for a while. Did he go back to the capital?After scolding Lawrence, Father has shown me and my children a deeper and more genuine affection than ever before.If I hadn\u2019t come to the separate palace because I didn\u2019t like Madame Rosan, I wouldn\u2019t have had the opportunity to do so.A few days ago, my husband even gave me the permission to fish, which I have been really wanting to do. I was very surprised and happy because I had not been allowed to do so for three years.Next week, we will follow His Majesty\u2019s direction and return to the capital. At that time, I believe that there will be time for quiet, long hours for us to build a proper friendship.We\u2019ll soon be cousins.May peace be endless until the day we meet again.Charlotte Eunice.]Artizea showed the letter to Cedric.\u201cI thought Charlotte hated me. I understand that she\u2019s trying to get along with you, but I didn\u2019t think she\u2019d put the word cousin there,\u201d Cedric said with a subtle face.\u201cIt\u2019s my mother and Lawrence that Countess Eunice hated, not Your Grace Cedric,\u201d Artizea said with a smile.\u201cAnyway, I don\u2019t have to worry about Your Grace\u2019s problem anyway with this. I want to finish the issue of the Marquisate of Rosan before he changes his mind.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t overdo it until late at night. They said you looked at the papers until the candles were all gone last night. Rize told me.\u201d\u201cShe now has a habit of informing Your Grace when the smallest things happen.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that because I\u2019m worried about you? You need to gain some weight above all else. You\u2019ve only eaten two pieces.\u201d\u201cAh yes.\u201dArtizea, embarrassed, took out a bite-sized crispy roll of wheat bread from a snack plate and put it in her mouth.As the crispy skin broke, the hot filling seeped out. Artizea closed her mouth with her hand in case the fillings spill.\u201cIt\u2019s not just that, Ansgar and Marcus are very worried because you always leave your meals. I\u2019ve been ordered to give you the snacks today. It\u2019s not tasteless isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s delicious.\u201d\u201cDo you know how much you eat?\u201dArtizea shook her head. It wasn\u2019t that she wasn\u2019t eating because she was full.\u201cLooking at you these days, it seems like you keep forgetting to eat even if you have snacks next to you.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026 because I\u2019m not used to it.\u201d\u201cHow much can you eat?\u201dCedric pointed to the plate.Artizea pointed at about half on the plentiful plate after contemplating.Then Cedric split that up, grabbed the rest in a handful and poured it in his mouth.\u201cNow, you can just empty everything else and reassure the cook.\u201d\u201cDo you eat it all at once?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it a snack anyway?\u201dArtizea opened her mouth slightly and looked at it.Then she laughed a little and put one in her mouth.Cedric refilled her teacup with herbal tea.\u201cSo it turns out, where and what is Lawrence doing?\u201d\u201cToday he returned to the mansion of the Marquis of Rosan.\u201dArtizea replied. Cedric was a little surprised.\u201cYou know what\u2019s going on. Did you let them in?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the house he used to live in. I can\u2019t keep him from coming in. My mother is there too\u2026\u2026. They\u2019ll continue to do so. I\u2019ll just take the safe and my belongings, and keep the mansion as it is. So are the employees. I can\u2019t keep my family out.\u201d\u201cTia, I don\u2019t think there is a need for that. Lawrence has enough wealth\u2026..\u201d\u201cThey have to stay where they are now.\u201dArtizea prevented Cedric from even commenting. With her index finger on his lips, she lifted the corner of her mouth and laughed.\u201cI think I know now that when you laugh like that, it\u2019s when you\u2019re having scary thoughts.\u201dCedric sighed.\u201cYou can\u2019t overdo it. You understand?\u201d\u201cYes, I know.\u201d\u201cIf something happens or is likely to happen, please discuss it with me.\u201d\u201cI know that too.\u201dArtizea replied with a smile.Then the maid knocked on the door and carefully raised her head.\u201cLady Artizea.\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201d\u201cMaster Lawrence has come. He\u2019s waiting in the parlor.\u201dThe maid\u2019s face was pale.Cedric stood up. Artizea grabbed his sleeve.\u201cI want to meet him alone.\u201d\u201cTia.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. It\u2019s not a big deal. I\u2019ll shout if something happens.\u201dCedric looked at her with an anxious face. Artizea smiled.She left Cedric and stepped outside. Alice, who was waiting after leaving the room, hurriedly followed.\u201cLady, what are you going to do? Master Lawrence is here\u2026\u201d\u201cI expected we\u2019d meet. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d\u201cLook at the mirror, Milady. I\u2019ll fix your makeup.\u201dArtizea hesitated for a moment.She had light makeup on her face. It was to make the scars and bruises look lighter.\u201cDon\u2019t do that, bring a wet towel.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI have to wipe the makeup off.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dAlice replied with a tight, nervous face, and hastily left the hall.Artizea returned to her room with slow steps.Soon Alice brought a bowl of hot water and a towel.Alice soaked a towel in water and handed it over to Artizea. Artizea covered her face with the towel.She wiped it off once and then again, working hard to wash her face. And again, looking in the mirror, she meticulously wiped the makeup.There was no girl with a spring face in the mirror.In the past, the appearance of her in her mind was similar to a skinny witch with white hair.The bones on the back of her hands were ugly and her complexion was pale. She looked like death.Returning to the past, she learned that for the first time that she had red cheeks.Sometimes she looked in the mirror and she was surprised by how beautiful she looked. The goddess of the underworld said she put on her youth by putting on makeup, so she believed that to be true.However, she was now completely back in the past.Artizea smiled at the familiar person in the mirror.After all, it must be this face she wears when facing Lawrence.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Even information spilled thoughtlessly could be dangerous.On the other hand, there was no opportunity to look inside.Artizea decided to discuss the matter with Ansgar today. At the very least, she had to install a sound collector and an eye hole with a lens.That would be a later project anyway.Artizea took a small breath and opened the door to the parlor.\u201c\u2026..\u201dLawrence sat cross-legged on the parlor sofa with his eyes closed.Unlike Artizea, he emitted an aura that resembled Miraila\u2019s.His fascinating appearance was as sweet as a prince dreamed of by all girls and his cheeks were bright like a person who had been dancing somewhere all night long.However, Artizea could see that he had struggled to contain his anger, which could burst at any moment and struggled to put a lid on it.That\u2019s why he closed his eyes as if he couldn\u2019t hear it, even though he came in while showing off his popularity.In the past, Artizea had evaluated Lawrence this way.\u201cBrother Lawrence isn\u2019t a foolish person. He has a sense for politics and a sense of judgment. However, he inherited his arrogance from His Majesty, the Emperor, and from his mother who had an unpredictable temperament.\u201dBoth of them easily trampled on his reason and often made him vicious.Whatever great qualities he had, it was a serious problem that would be offset by his flaws.A mad emperor or a selfish and greedy emperor. Measuring Lawrence and Roygar determines that. In the past, it was natural that Chancellor Lin did not choose and ultimately quit.Nevertheless, Artizea thought that Lawrence would be able to overcome his shortcomings.In other words, this was Artizea\u2019s flaw. It was a judgment that was clouded by blood ties.Eventually, Lawrence ceased to be completely in control of himself when no one was oppressing him.But not at this point. He still had a control called the emperor.So he won\u2019t be able to pour out that anger on Artizea. Now that she was Cedric\u2019s fianc\u00e9e. Lawrence knows that politics is a delicate and complex affair.Even though the emperor\u2019s seat seemed to be of absolute power, he understood that it was a position placed on a balance of powers.So no matter how dissatisfied he may be, he will behave with a soft voice at the presence of the Grand Duke of Evron.It wasn\u2019t only the emperor\u2019s loyal subjects, but the emperor, himself, told Lawrence to bring Cedric in. Artizea knew it.However, in a voice that seemed unaware of anything like that, Artizea cautiously called Lawrence.\u201cYou are here, brother?\u201dStill, it is good to be considered a helpless girl.Lawrence opened his eyes. Artizea bowed politely to him.Instead of greeting each other, he still looked at Artizea\u2019s face.There was a bruise on the eyebrows, and the scratches on her temple and chin had turned purple.There was a hit mark on her wrist that was exposed from under one of her fluffy sleeves. There would be more scars in the parts that could not be easily seen.Artizea did not turn her head, nor cover her wounds.Lawrence finally sighed when he saw Artizea\u2019s pale complexion.\u201cSit down.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dArtizea avoided the main seat and sat across from Lawrence.\u201cI heard that you haven\u2019t been in the annex.\u201d\u201cI went out to get some air.\u201d\u201cHave you heard the news? Have you been home?\u201d\u201cYes. You\u2019ve organized your belongings.\u201d\u201cYes, Grand Duke Evron said it would be better to stay at the residence before the wedding.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dIt wouldn\u2019t be right to start living together before marriage. Moreover, Artizea is still only 18 years old.But Lawrence didn\u2019t say a word about it.Cedric couldn\u2019t stand still when he saw a woman\u2019s face like that. Well, much more against his fianc\u00e9e.This had already left Lawrence\u2019s hands.\u201cHow\u2019s mother doing?\u201d\u201cListen, she\u2019s down with hysteria.\u201dArtizea knew all the steps contained in that single sentence.The mansion will be draped like an evacuation procession, and the maids will roam silently, terrified.Miraila was now in bed, fluttering in depression.Anger is a matter of using energy. She once burst into anger and beat Artizea, but then became exhausted and treated her tenderly the next day.With a sad or sorry face, she acted like a person about to die.\u300cIt\u2019s because I can only rely on you.\u300dSaying so.Lawrence asked as Artizea lowered her head.\u201cIf you\u2019re able to, come see her for a moment.\u201d\u201cNo. I don\u2019t want to see my mother for the time being. I think this would be a good opportunity. I\u2019m thinking taking this opportunity to sever ties with my mother.\u201dLawrence asked back in amazement.\u201cAre you serious?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cTia. This is not something you should decide in haste. Didn\u2019t you love your mother?\u201d\u201cI love her,\u201d Artizea said with a groan.Of all the words she\u2019s exchanged with Lawrence so far, that was the only sentence she said with sincerity.\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean I want to dedicate my whole life to her. I want to be happy with Cedric. This kind of luck may not come to me ever again, so I want to do my best. Even if I couldn\u2019t make it as an honorable Grand Duchess, I want to be recognized as Cedric\u2019s wife.\u201d\u201cTia.\u201d\u201cBut I can\u2019t be like that in the name of Miraila\u2019s daughter. Whatever I do, I\u2019ll only be condemned by the world. You know that right?\u201dWhat Cedric saw was a big deal, but Artizea did not.It wasn\u2019t the first time it happened, and it wasn\u2019t going to be much worse than the other times.However, Artizea\u2019s determination seemed firm.Lawrence didn\u2019t even know she had that kind of will.Artizea dropped her head.\u201cAnd I don\u2019t want to be this miserable in front of Cedric again.\u201d\u201cYes, if that\u2019s what you want.\u201dLawrence nodded effortlessly.After all, the rights of the Marquisate of Rosan belonged to Artizea.If she marries, she will also inherit the title. It\u2019s not a matter for Lawrence to argue about here.Unlike Miraila from the start, Lawrence didn\u2019t have any regrets about the Marquis of Rosan\u2019s estate.\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThen what would you do with the mansion? I have a few mansions, but I think it will take some time for me to organize them and move.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to leave the mansion to my mother. I\u2019m going to give you the maintenance of the mansion and a pension that\u2019s not less than what you\u2019ve been spending so far. You and mother can continue to remain there.\u201d\u201cYes. Okay. It\u2019s a little early, but congratulations on your wedding. I wish you had informed me of your engagement in advance.\u201dLawrence only said then.Artizea felt bitter in her heart, but smiled without showing it.\u201cIf things didn\u2019t go fast like this, you would have made an engagement announcement when I returned from the annex.\u201d\u201c\u2026. yes. I suppose so.\u201dLawrence was then caught up in some strange intuition.Did anything happen?Was Artizea a kid like this?He felt uncomfortable. As soon as he returned to the Marquisate of Rosan, he remembered how Bill had complained.[Even before then, Miss Tia was a little weird. It\u2019s not just because your mother hurt her face. She must have devised a scheme.]Lawrence didn\u2019t think Artizea knew how to do that.In the first place, Bill isn\u2019t a credible guy. He was only good at catering up to Miraila, so he just let it go.However, it was true that everything was going on at a fast pace, as if the situation had just been lying in wait to unfold.This was also the case when Artizea decided to change the employees before this even happened.Thanks to this, the fortune and ownership was already being transferred.With the emperor\u2019s approval, it would be finished. It couldn\u2019t be done if she didn\u2019t prepare in advance.\u2018Tia did\u2026 ?\u2019The Artizea Lawrence knew has always been helpless and intimidated.He knew she wasn\u2019t a bad kid. And that she always looked around and yearned for affection.Artizea in front of him now looked like that. Her words were careful, and her attitude was the same as before. The face with the traces of being beaten was haggard.As if she was determined to be strong, she was clasping the two hands on her knees so tightly that her knuckles turned white.It was a lot from her point of view to say that she would cut off her relationship with Miraila with such determination.Nevertheless, she looked pale and cold.The pupils under the lowered eyelids were deep like the deep sea. It seemed that blue blood was spinning in the veins under her thin skin.He knew such a person. Sitting in the shade of the conference room and touching the map with a dry hand\u2026.\u201cWhat are you going to do, brother?\u201dArtizea spoke as if to cut off that thought.Lawrence was very nervous. The looming image had already disappeared.\u201cMe?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dArtizea raised the curtain that had been down until then. And she said again.\u201cHow long will you be tied to mother?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d\u201cProbably no one will be able to say this, but this is a testimony that I can give because I am my mother\u2019s real daughter and my brother\u2019s real sister.\u201dArtizea chose the words on purpose. Instead of advice, she called it a testimony.\u201cThere\u2019s no one else who needs to cut off their ties with my mother more than my brother.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cMy mother is certainly receiving the favor of His Majesty, the Emperor, but it is not a favor that my brother needs. Because you are His Majesty\u2019s son even without his favor for mother.\u201d\u201cSo?\u201d\u201cWhat you need to become a crown prince is not your Majesty\u2019s favor, but a legitimate right.\u201dLawrence\u2019s complexion changed a little.He always felt disgusted to hear that he was born as an illegitimate child.Artizea spoke once more before he got angry.\u201cThe only one who can give that to brother is Her Majesty, the Empress. The only way for a person outside of marriage to be recognized for the right to inherit is to be adopted by the spouse.\u201dFrom her words, Artizea raised her head.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 36": "Chapter 36Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 36Proofreader: xoxomonamiNo matter how powerful aristocrats were, they were compelled to follow the temple for three things: baptism, weddings, and funerals.The temple strictly forbade the inheritance of illegitimate children as witnesses of the sacred marriage vows and guardianship.Property is only transferable while alive. Some of the titles were transferable.However, the title belonging to the family itself was non-transferable. The illegitimate child could never inherit.Even if there were hundreds of children, if there were no offspring to inherit the family, the title of the family and the accompanying property were returned to the imperial family.The only way to avoid it is for the spouse to adopt them.It was also the most powerful right for a spouse who had no children to protect themselves.\u201cHis Majesty hasn\u2019t said anything?\u201d Artizea asked in a quiet voice.The current succession quarrel is, in fact, the seed sown during the reign of the emperor.The previous Emperor had not had children for a long time while with the first empress. So, he made one of the extramarital affairs into the Crown Prince and made him as the Empress\u2019 adopted son.That is now Emperor Gregor.However, when the Empress died in her later years, the previous Emperor remarried with a young woman as young as his daughter.The firstborn was Cedric\u2019s mother, and the second was Grand Duke Roygar, who was now a candidate to become next emperor.The imperial politics was greatly shaken.However, it was too late to overturn the position of the prince which had already been established.The grown-up prince was already building up his power, and the emperor was already over fifty years old.On the other hand, Emperor Gregor was carrying his own family after the deceased emperor.Even so, Emperor Gregor suffered a problem of legitimacy in the early days of his throne.Thus, the imperial power was strengthened by purging Cedric\u2019s parents for treason.However, the legitimacy question raised at that time still lingered.If Emperor Gregor had an offspring, the succession structure would not have been complicated. Because he was already the emperor.However, there are no children of the Empress line in the Imperial Family. By law, Gregor\u2019s closest relative is Grand Duke Roygar.The temple tried to prevent the marriage vows from being neutralized for two generations. Grand Duke Roygar remained the enemy of the Emperor.This succession right is, in fact, powerful enough to quarrel with Emperor Gregor.So, if Lawrence wants the Crown Prince\u2019s seat, the fastest and surest way is to become the Empress\u2019s adopted son.To avoid that, there was no other choice but to create legitimacy in a different way. Just as Artizea had married him to a saintess in the past.This is all true.Poison is the scariest thing when it is true.This is because no matter how much the poisoned person looks at it, they logically reach the same conclusion.Lawrence was wise enough to understand what Artizea meant.At the same time, he was foolish enough not to realize that Artizea\u2019s words were never fair.\u2018My brother is arrogant and selfish,\u2019 Artizea thought so, looking at Lawrence.It was Lawrence\u2019s arrogance to think that the fickle favor of the emperor\u2019s was solely his own.In addition to Lawrence, the emperor had a few more illegitimate offsprings.However, the reason why the emperor chooses and favors Lawrence is not because Lawrence is a son or because of the high status of his birth mother.This is because the emperor loved Miraila and decided to create a family with Miraila.If the family game cracks, the emperor\u2019s favor will disappear like a summer frost.The emperor wasn\u2019t very responsible enough to cling to his broken family, and there were a lot of people trying to drive a crack into it.Even Miraila knew, but Lawrence didn\u2019t.The things that Miraila had done so far to stop the emperor\u2019s wrath and attract his love and favor to Lawrence will not remain in his mind.Because his mother\u2019s love and devotion were natural to him.Artizea whispered one more word as if breathing poisonous breath as he watched the gloomy thoughts sway within Lawrence.\u201cMaybe, I don\u2019t know if my mother is deliberately preventing me from saying it. My mother is obsessed with brother.\u201d\u201c\u2026.. Tia.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m so nervous. Since His Majesty loves you, everyone considers you to be the future crown prince, but if something happens tomorrow, it\u2019s Grand Duke Roygar who will succeed him.\u201d\u201cTia, don\u2019t talk ominously. Just saying that can be a treason.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026.. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019re so anxious.\u201dLawrence said with eyes slightly reddened with anxiety.\u201cBecause I\u2019m brother\u2019s younger sister. Brother\u2019s safety is directly related to my safety.\u201dArtizea bowed her head.These words gave him hope that he would be able to easily win the favor of Grand Duke of Evron. At the same time, it gave him anxiety and worries from Artizea.Lawrence was silent for a moment, then said furiously.\u201cHow can you say that you are ending your relationship with your mother so easily?\u201dHe asked again.\u201cBut what you say does make sense.\u201dHe nodded.\u2018Done.\u2019Artizea felt relief in her heart. The poison went into place.Splitting the power by alienation was a basic strategy used by the weak to deal with the powerful.In order to beat Lawrence, she first had to remove Miraila.\u201cDon\u2019t worry too much.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u2026 I\u2019m sorry for saying something so ominous,\u201d Artizea said passively.Lawrence stood up from his seat. Artizea stood up as she followed him.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to come. The butler will see me off.\u201d\u201cBrother.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t wait to see you again with a clean face. By then, Grand Duke Evron will be with you.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dArtizea bowed her head to him. Lawrence patted her shoulder once and stepped outside.Voices of greeting come from afar. Artizea sat on the couch for a while, feeling tired.With this, Lawrence will prevent Miraila from attending the wedding.Knock, knock.There was a knock on the door.It was Marcus who opened the door, politely holding a letter on a silver tray.Artizea smiled embarrassingly.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this errand yourself.\u201d\u201cThis is the news you\u2019ve been waiting for. I brought it myself because I was worried that Master Lawrence might notice something happening.\u201dHe laid out the tray. On top of it was a letter that was sealed with a gold seal of a sea dragon.It was an invitation from the empress.\u201cFinally.\u201dAs she threw herself out in front of the guests, the final object she expected had arrived.Artizea smiled contentedly.****Lawrence had a cluttered mind and didn\u2019t even know he had arrived at home until the carriage door opened.[I am your father, and I don\u2019t intend to make you my successor unconditionally. I can\u2019t do that.]The emperor\u2019s words came to mind again.[Just put Ced in your hands. Then I will do the rest.]At that time, he was filled with pent up anger and didn\u2019t take it, but when he thinks about it now, it was a word that meant enough.Amelia Harper, one of the emperor\u2019s loyal subjects, once advised him. It was when the first words about Artizea and Cedric appeared.[The Grand Duke Evron is of the imperial enemy line. If you can receive his loyalty, that alone greatly complements Master Lawrence\u2019s legitimacy.]It was a word that touched Lawrence\u2019s complex.As he did not hide his displeasure, Harper said coldly.[The emperor is the only authority of this empire. Master Lawrence wants to be the emperor, but you are not confident of getting Grand Duke Evron in your favor?]He should have listened to Harper more carefully.Maybe the emperor was already arranging several things for Lawrence.And he was obligated to meet the expectations.With that thought, Lawrence stepped into the chilly mansion of the Marquis of Rosan.Miraila hurried to meet him to the mansion lobby. How much has she cried for her face to become so swollen?\u201cLawrence, Lawrence, you\u2019re here? What did Tia say? Is she coming back?\u201d\u201cFrom my mother\u2019s perspective, who grabbed and abused Tia in front of her fianc\u00e9 and guests, do you really think she would come back?\u201d\u201cThat girl\u2019s house is here. Of course she has to come back!\u201d\u201cDuke Evron won\u2019t let that happen.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous. What did he say? She\u2019s my daughter! Besides she\u2019s still young, isn\u2019t she? What does Grand Duke Evron have to do with my own daughter? I didn\u2019t approve of this marriage!\u201d Miraila shouted, clinging to Lawrence.It was a rare attitude for Miraila, who would never show a bad appearance to Lawrence. That\u2019s how desperate she was.But Lawrence pushed her away with a cold manner.\u201cMother, are you determined to ruin my future?\u201dAt Lawrence\u2019s words, Miraila hiccuped and bit her mouth shut as if scared.\u201cWh, what do you mean?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve heard of Father saying that Tia is fortunate to have a relationship with Grand Duke Evron. But why are you doing this?\u201d\u201cWell, that\u2019s\u2026.. that\u2019s not it. How can Tia do this to me anyway? I didn\u2019t mean to hurt Tia. You know that, don\u2019t you? How did I give birth to such a girl?\u201d\u201cI know. Right.\u201dLawrence looked at her with a grim gaze with no warmth.\u201cYou had a hard time giving birth. This is the second time, right?\u201d\u201cWha, what\u2019s the second\u2026\u201d\u201cMy mother is blocking my way. You gave birth to Tia, and now you\u2019ve done this. Mother, do you want to kill me?\u201dLawrence said softly as he touched the scarf around Miraila\u2019s neck to correct it.Miraila shrugged her neck in fear.\u201cWha, what do you mean? Why do I want to kill you?\u201d\u201cDie or become emperor, there can only be one thing to do of the two. Mother, please do not do anything useless and stay still.\u201dLawrence clenched his teeth.\u201cAnyway, my mother couldn\u2019t have the ability to dethrone the empress, nor could she make me the prince.\u201d\u201cLawrence, you know? The empress\u2026\u201dMiraila mumbled with a miserable face. Lawrence turned around.\u201cNo, no. Lawrence, Mom will never disappoint you.I will never again. I will never disappoint you again. Lawrence, Lawrence!\u201dMiraila, hurriedly followed him, grabbed his arm. Lawrence shook her hand roughly and once again stepped out.Miraila sat down and sobbed.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 37": "Chapter 37Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAs Artizea entered, the mansion of Duke Evron began to change.For Cedric, \u2018house\u2019 meant the people of the Grand Duchy.He seldom stayed in the mansion itself. By nature, he did not pay close attention to the atmosphere of the mansion.Ansgar, who had to take care of the mansion, always followed Cedric to and from the camp.No one stayed at home, so the house was naturally desolate. The Grand Duke\u2019s residence in the capital was close to a space where Cedric and his knights could only sleep for a month or two of the year.Artizea renewed the atmosphere.\u201cThanks to the Lady Heiress, the whole house is full of life.\u201dThe butler and the head maid\u2019s face bloomed.For the Grand Duke of Evron, for the first time in nearly two decades, he finally felt like a homeowner.A new maid was hired, and flowers were decorated. In the dining room, fine new cutleries was placed to replace the old silverware.The wardrobe was filled and the bedroom was lively.The servants opened the door of the empty room and polished the old furniture. Simple construction was also done in several places, including the living room and bedroom.The real purpose of the construction was to decorate the house with needed equipment such as installing a sound collector and a secret passage.But on the outside, it seemed like they were simply installing ornaments or changing wallpaper.Cedric replied happily to Artizea asking for permission.\u201cDo whatever you want. You can use the budget of the mansion as you like. Don\u2019t just think about what you need for your work, but make sure you have whatever you need to be comfortable.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cIf you need me, feel free to tell me. I\u2019m not very useful for this, but I will do my best,\u201d he added, a little awkwardly, \u201cIsn\u2019t it also going to be your home now?\u201dArtizea wanted to say thank you for his care, but somehow the words couldn\u2019t come out smoothly on her tongue.\u2018Your home\u2019.She never thought so. For Artizea, moving to his residence was part of the plan.But Cedric says this will really be her home.Even though it was only a two-year contract, it was as if it was a real marriage.Her face heated up.The marriage was nothing. She only intended to naturally stick to Cedric\u2019s side and influence the Grand Duke.However, every time he said things like this, she didn\u2019t know why her face became hot and why her heart shook.Seeing Artizea\u2019s face, Cedric made an awkward face.He looked at Artizea several times as if he had something else to say, then coughed and just left the room.Artizea bowed behind him and rubbed her hand on her cheek. She was worried that she might have had a strange attitude.\u2014\u2013The maid, Loa, breathed in a deep and tense breath in front of Artizea\u2019s study.\u201cLady Heiress, This is Loa.\u201dArtizea rarely called in her employees directly for work.What would it be?Artizea was a generous master.Routine chores, such as washing or cleaning, may not have been touched because they are not yet married.However, she seldom interfered with the things she was holding in the bedroom.There were no attempts to win over the mansion\u2019s maid. She was not directly involved in hiring a new maid, and she did not even try to pick someone she liked.At first, Loa was worried that Cedric\u2019s fianc\u00e9e was the lady of Marquisate of Rosan. She had imagined her to be discerning and extravagant.The same would be true even if she was not of the Marquisate of Rosan, but instead another central noble.But Artizea didn\u2019t show that at all. She was generous to the maid and left most of the work to herself.Rather, Loa became uneasy. She had never had such a mistress.Not to interfere. So maybe she did too much work on her own?After being called to the study, she became more anxious.When she knocked on the door, the door of the study opened.\u201cCome in.\u201dAlice greeted Loa with a grin and a smile. Then Loa went inside carefully.Artizea sat comfortably on the sofa in the study.Loa politely bowed to her. Artizea beckoned to Alice.Alice opened the box in front of Artizea and gave the pouch inside to Loa.\u201cUse it to replace curtains and bedding.\u201d\u201cToo, too much.\u201dLoa was surprised to learn that what was in the pocket was gold, not silver.\u201cHalf of this is enough.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m giving it to you generously on purpose.\u201dIf you were an employee of another noble family, you would know the meaning of a generous budget and handle it well.However, the employees of the Grand Duke of Evron had no such experience.Artizea said softly.\u201cI have a lot of work to do, but wouldn\u2019t it take a lot of time to talk through the butler? If necessary, hire a person temporarily with this money and share the money with the working people.\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s still too much though. I didn\u2019t even use all the money that you gave the maids to get all new clothes and shoes.\u201dLoa said in a trembling voice.Artizea also knew.And she already knew that the Loa didn\u2019t take a separate share of the money.\u201cThen, how about hiring more people or buying decent tea for your breaks?\u201d\u201cBut \u2026..\u201d\u201cI took money out for my employees, and it\u2019s impossible for that money to go back into the vault.\u201dHaving said this, Loa could not dare to refuse again as an employee.\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cSince I\u2019m young and I\u2019m still not good at the circumstances of the Grand Duchy, I will continue to rely on you a lot.\u201dLoa was thrilled with this trust. Then she carefully packed the pocket of gold coins and went out.After the door closed, Alice exhaled a breath. Then she tilted his head and asked.\u201cDo you need to test again?\u201d\u201cWhy do you think it\u2019s a test?\u201d Artizea asked with a smile.\u201cYou\u2019re going to see what she\u2019s going to do after receiving undeserved authority.\u201d\u201cShe didn\u2019t put any in her pocket, so you need to know better. What kind of values does she have?\u201d\u201cShe could be just an honest woman.\u201d\u201cThen, it\u2019s rather good because I can leave all of the work. I don\u2019t have time to manage a maid or a servant. It\u2019s easier to give them a lot of authority and correct it quickly if something went wrong.\u201d\u201cBut yes. How hard it must be for you to return to the Rosan Estate. It\u2019s such a waste.\u201d Alice grumbled.Artizea could not help but smile.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Money is just used as tools. It\u2019s also a small amount of money anyway.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cIf there\u2019s any talk between the maids, let me know.\u201d\u201cYes, don\u2019t worry! That\u2019s my role.\u201d Alice said cheerfully. She had already bribed nearly half of the Grand Duke\u2019s maids.That was what Artizea told Alice to do first.It was also necessary to collect rumors among the employees of the Grand Duke.However, rather than that, it was because she had to find out how far the Duke worked.\u201cI have to prepare to go out.\u201d\u201cOh, yes! I\u2019ll talk to Sophie soon!\u201dAlice jumped up and went outside.Artizea spent a leisurely time sipping tea for a while.Now it was time to greet the second guest.Knock, knockThe person who she had been waiting for had finally arrived.\u201cCome in.\u201dArtizea replied calmly.It was Freil who opened the door and entered.He politely bowed to Artizea and spoke in a firm voice.\u201cThis is Freil, the lieutenant of Grand Duke Evron.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time, Sir Freil. This is the first time we\u2019ve met since I saw you at the mansion of Marquis Rosan, right?\u201d\u201cYou remember it even though it was a bad time.\u201dAs a sign of gratitude, Freil bowed down a little.\u201cOf course. I saw you at the temple as well.\u201d\u201cYes, I saw you back then too.\u201dAnd Artizea knew him much better than he imagined.It was Artizea who assassinated Freil in a previous life.Freil didn\u2019t have an outstanding talent in terms of strategy or conspiracy. However, his vision was wide and he was alert.When Artizea plots something against Cedric, the first person to notice was Freil.It was one of the reasons why the people of the Grand Duke of Evron cursed and hated her so badly.Conversely, he was a man who could be a very powerful ally.In addition to Cedric\u2019s support, Artizea needed another comrade who could move with her to support the Grand Duke of Evron.A person who keeps a secret and can risk his life together for Cedric regardless of profit.And if it was Freil, he was the one who could do that.Artizea felt a little excitement.But she couldn\u2019t tell Freil that she was happy to be able to talk to him alive.As she closed her eyes, Freil\u2019s observant gaze came.\u201cI heard that you appointed me as an attendant while you went out today.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t do anything that I can confidently say for myself, but my skills are inferior to the other knights of the Grand Duke of Evron. Of course I can\u2019t compare to Alphonse.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not asking you to accompany me in case there\u2019s a danger in the capital. It\u2019s a bit inappropriate to be accompanied by Sir Alphonse.\u201dArtizea raised her eyes.\u201cYou may want to know what kind of person I am. That\u2019s why you responded to the request right away.\u201d\u201cThe Lady has made the choice. I do not dare to judge.\u201dAs she made eye contact, this time Freil lowered it down. And he said as if he had read inside Artizea\u2019s mind.\u201cWhat I know is exactly what the Grand Duke knows.\u201dFreil euphemistically expressed that she shouldn\u2019t tell him what to hide from Cedric, but Artizea smiled.\u201cMake that decision after we finish our work.\u201dFreil bowed his head silently.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 38": "Chapter 38Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 38Proofreader: xoxomonamiArtizea went out quietly without being noticed by the people of the mansion.The clothes were of the nobility and were more commonly worn in times of mourning. There was nothing special about the characteristic of such a dress.The striking white blonde was wrapped in a finely woven net of fine brown thread.A black veil was attached to the brim of the hat, covering all the way to her lips. That was the biggest reason for choosing a mourning dress in the first place.Freil removed his epaulettes.(T/N: Epaulette is the ornamental shoulder piece on military uniforms.)It seemed that Artizea knew why Alphonse was inadequate to accompany her. Alphonse was an overly picturesque knight, so even wearing rags, he was sure to still look good.Except for Freil, one coachman was the only attendant. Alice didn\u2019t come along either.\u201cDo you often go out like this?\u201d Freil asked in surprise\u201cUntil now, I didn\u2019t have much to go out for this kind of thing, but yes. Should there be occasions where I\u2019ll need to go out unnoticed, I will have to operate this way.\u201dFreil looked at the black two wheeled carriage without a single crest.Nowhere, there were no special features anywhere. No one would be able to tell who Artizea is or what kind of person she was.There was nothing dangerous to do unless a fight broke out in the field.And such a thing could be avoided by having a strong coachman and moving carefully.Freil thought he didn\u2019t know what Artizea was like.He had known that she was clever from the time she proposed a contract marriage by tying up her own marriage and Western military affairs.When Saintess Olga\u2019s heart was linked to the Baron Yetz case, she even advised Cedric that he shouldn\u2019t miss it.But isn\u2019t this like an area of experience?Freil thought that even if he prepared for Cedric\u2019s secret affairs, he would not be able to do this thoroughly.Freil was wary of Artizea.Behind the Grand Duke of Evron were many simple, good-natured Northerners.At first, several people were shocked that the master was engaged to Milaira\u2019s daughter.But everyone noticed that Artizea had suffered a great deal under Milaira\u2019s hands and put their guard down.There was no one who did not sympathize with her, knowing how miserable she was in Rosan.When Artizea came to the mansion and showed a calm appearance, his good feelings grew.She was noble and kind.While entrusting great authority to her subordinates, she knew almost everything.It was the mistress that the people of the Grand Duke of Evron had longed for.However, Freil was convinced that the event with Milaira was also made up by Artizea.The work that began with Saintess Olga\u2019s heart was not finished yet.In fact, Artizea received an invitation from the Empress because of this incident.It didn\u2019t seem like she had bad intentions.But it wasn\u2019t clear to Freil how far Artizea\u2019s work would be connected or what big picture she was drawing.It was dangerous to be that invisible.Freil thought that he should be alert and keep his head straight.The carriage passed the downtown area and entered the old street.This street has been inside the city gate since the early days of the establishment of the imperial capital, but due to its lack of geographical advantage, it was not incorporated into the center.However, a new building could not be built, nor could it create a strong community like a rural village, so the slums were in progress.Most of the inhabitants were not citizens who had lived for a long time, but were thieves who came to the city.There was a bar in the middle. Artizea opened one of the doors and entered.Freil followed her. He was taken aback in his heart that Artizea knew a place like this.Artizea did not hesitate to approach the bartender. And said,\u201dTell Rye Fidget that I\u2019m here to buy a bottle of barberry wine.\u201dThe bartender\u2019s face hardened.The other clerks panicked when they heard it and went inside.\u201cWhere did you hear the name?\u201d\u201cRye? Because we know each other very well.\u201dArtizea leaned against the back of the chair in a relaxed manner.The breathless tension settled down in the store.Rye Fidget was a solver and an honest villain. He would do everything he could if you gave him money and kept his trust in the person who gave him the money first.\u201cYou are the one who sold humanity for money. So you have to be loyal to money.\u201dArtizea praised him for that point.She used money to grow Rye\u2019s organization. Because there were many things that needed black hands.Under Artizea he bloomed as a trusted villain.From forgery of documents to intimidation, kidnapping, torture, and spreading bad rumors, it was a useful load. In fact, he matched Artizea very well.And in the end, he betrayed Artizea.Artizea remembered that he had come to court with forged documents and evidence of the assassination.[I\u2019m sorry, Marchioness. I am a man who sells humanity for money.]With a face that had lost one eye and broken nose from torture, Rye confessed.Artizea did not think she was betrayed. It wasn\u2019t a relationship that was made with fidelity anyway.There was no need for conflict between the emperor and his former master, who have been accused of treason.Why did he need to risk his life to protect her?Apart from that, of course, this time he felt the need to have some other safeguards, not money.It wasn\u2019t long before Rye came out to the store with a pale complexion.As if he came out of bed right away, his hair was shaky and his shirt was wrinkled. It was refreshing to see the young face after a long time.Artizea looked at him closely, so Rye felt embarrassed.\u201cWho are you?\u201d Asking so, he tilted his head.Only his colleagues knew what his real name was. Because the name was so cute, he was often looked down on, so he changed his name to Watt when he came to the city.It was because of the mail coming from his hometown that he gave out his name to his colleagues.There was no way anyone who knew his name would come. Much less referring to the \u2018barberry wine\u2019.\u2018Barberry wine\u2019 was a slang word for murder in this area.\u2018Who is it? She looks young, but when you look at your gestures, it doesn\u2019t seem right. And the man beside her\u2026.. Is he a knight?\u2019\u201cDecide after hearing my suggestion, Rye. Right now, you won\u2019t even understand if you roll your head,\u201d Artizea said briefly.Rye bit his lips gently and asked.\u201cHow did you know my name?\u201d\u201cIs that important?\u201dBeyond the veil, thin lips smiled brightly\u201cI\u2019m here to buy barberry wine. And you\u2019ll sell whatever money can buy.\u201d\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll connect you with someone who can sell.\u201d\u201cI want you to take care of it yourself. Of course, it doesn\u2019t mean I want you to use your own hands.\u201dThis woman is dangerous. Rye trusted his intuition.He wondered how she knew his name. However, it was better not to get connected.It is true that he is a guy who sells anything for money. However, he did not sell his life or his family.Artizea gave Rye a small bunch wrapped in black paper.Rye took it and weighed it by hand. Looking at the thickness and texture, it seemed like ten gold coins.If it was 10 golds, it was enough for a common people\u2019s family to eat and live for a month.It wasn\u2019t a small amount of money, but Rye pushed it away with his hand.Then Artizea presented a second bundle. Rye pushed it back again. Then came the third bundle.Rye flinched briefly this time. Artizea asked as she held out the fourth bundle.\u201cIs that enough to sell humanity yet?\u201d\u201cDamn it, stop it.\u201dArtizea added two more bundles to make a total of 60 gold.Rye rolled his eyes.He wondered how far the amount would go up. He said he wouldn\u2019t be bought, but it seemed that he could be sold depending on the amount.However, it wasn\u2019t a bunch of gold coins that came out as the seventh, but an envelope.Artizea silently put it on top of the stack of gold coins.Rye felt ominous and grabbed the envelope and opened it.[To brother Rye.The youngest is in very good condition thanks to the money and the doctor you sent us this time. I can even walk around.All that\u2019s left is to dry out firewood this winter. Thanks to you, I have a lot of room, so hopefully I can prepare a cloth to hang on the wall before winter. Thank you so much.But is it okay to send me such a large amount of money? You are not working dangerously, are you? Sending me a doctor from the capital must have cost you a lot of money.The youngest is also important, but the older brother is also important. Do not work too hard. And as far as I am concerned, I just want my brother to return to his hometown.]There was a longer comment below, but it didn\u2019t come into Rye\u2019s eyes.The hand holding the letter trembled.He had never sent money to a doctor, so this woman must have done it.And Rye wasn\u2019t so stupid that he couldn\u2019t know it was a blackmail.\u201cAhhhhh! \u201cHe screamed and jumped to his feet.Freil tried to block it. But Artizea shook her head and signaled Freil to stop.Rye reached out his fist at Artizea, but he dared not touch her.This woman is a noble.She also knows why Rye needs money.He couldn\u2019t figure out how far she knew, and how far she would have played tricks. It was too dangerous.Artizea finally took out a small card and handed it to Rai.Rye read the card and sat down. And asked in a tone of resignation.\u201cIs this all I need to do? You don\u2019t have to look for me to deal with such a stupid guy. I\u2019ll just give it to a drunkard with a tenth of the money. It\u2019s a waste.\u201d\u201cI want perfect results, and it\u2019s not a waste if I think I can get you on my side.\u201dAfter saying so, Artizea took the card back and put it in her handbag.Rye stroked his head with his palms. And he sighed.\u201cOkay. You\u2019ll be able to hear the news the day after tomorrow. Lady Rosan.\u201dBy saying so, he revealed that he knew who Artizea was.But Artizea was not shaken.Inside the card was the name of the person to be dealt with. If he was stupid enough to see it and still not recognize who she was, then she wouldn\u2019t even make a deal with Rye.\u201cI don\u2019t mind if you don\u2019t give me separate news,\u201d Artizea said so and stood up from her seat.\u201cWhat did you ask for?\u201d Freil asked as they made their exit.\u201cTo get rid of traces,\u201d Artizea said as she got into the carriage. The next destination was a safe house.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Unless he was a poor male baron who was regretting the money to lend his name to such a signboard or a courtesan that succeeded in marrying a noble.These restaurants were not intended for nobles.It is a place used by the middle class who are rich in their own way, but cannot interact with the nobility, the knight class who cannot afford to hire a cook, and the noble class who has no inherited title or property.It was not a place for the Lady Heiress of Rosan\u2019s to visitArtizea got off without hesitation. Freil hesitated a little.Artizea is wearing a veil. Her identity won\u2019t be revealed.But there was no law that anyone who knew her face would not be in the restaurant.\u201cWould you like to wear a mask?\u201d Artizea asked.\u201c\u2026 are you kidding?\u201dShe wasn\u2019t kidding. There was really a mask ready in her carriage.It was nothing more than a simple black cloth with holes for the eyes. Freil could easily imagine her making it.\u201cI\u2019m sure there\u2019s no one who would recognize you, but if you\u2019re uneasy.\u201dArtizea said so. Freil sighed.\u201cBecause I\u2019m not Alphonse.\u201dArtizea smiled as if she knew. Freil got off the carriage, feeling the misery of a man who had neither popularity nor fame.The two went through the back door of the restaurant. Unlike the main entrance, where a lot of people enter and exit, this door led them directly to the VIP room.\u201cIs this the Lady\u2019s shop?\u201d\u201cRather than the shop, it would be the entire building.\u201dFreil rolled his eyes in disbelief.\u201cWhen did you buy it?\u201d\u201cWhen I got the key to the safe in the mansion of Marquis Rosan,\u201d Artizea answered calmly.Freil wondered how many buildings she would have in the capital.As far as he knows, there were eight mansions in the capital that were publicly owned by the Marquisate of Rosan. In addition to that, there will be a cottage or land.He didn\u2019t know that they were also buying buildings in downtown areas.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing bad about having a lot of buildings. I might need it for houses or for secret work, but buying real estate in the capital will never hurt you. As an investment.\u201dOf course, Freil knew very well. He just couldn\u2019t buy any because he didn\u2019t have money.\u201cThat advice, would you please give it to my Lord a little too? It\u2019s my Lord\u2019s side that you should decide to worry about.\u201dThe assets of the Marquis of Rosan were truly enormous.Originally, it would have been divided and inherited by several descendants.In other words, the Duke only gave it to Artizea. It was different from the common noble family with many blood relatives.There were many families that maintained an inheritance method of concentrating on one successor and passing on property. Even so, it was rare that such a fortune was concentrated on one person.Three of the largest gold mines and six silver mines in the empire belonged to the Marquisate of Rosan. There was also a diamond mine.The iron and copper mines that Michael\u2019s brothers and sisters inherited were double digits.The highly profitable sapphire mine received in lieu of giving Miraila, still made a huge income.The property managers hired by the emperor on behalf of Miraila have exerted enormous influence over the iron and copper smelting business in the process of growing their wealth. It was used in policies to increase the imperial control over the economy.It was natural that it could not be returned to Artizea as it was.The emperor absorbed the smelting business as belonging to the imperial family and returned the appropriate money to Artizea instead.The amount could not be taken into account of it\u2019s possible impact on the imperial economy.Even so, it was true that Artizea was one of the richest nobles in the Empire. The funding power that could be mobilized immediately would have been more than the imperial family.Cedric was somewhat worried about it.[I don\u2019t intend to deal with the property of the Marquisate of Rosan, but is it good to leave it to Tia as it is? Anyway, she\u2019s 18 years old\u2026][Would the Evron do it well?]Freil said that with a half sarcastic feeling. Cedric laughed in vain.[Yes. There\u2019s Marcus\u2026]Except for the smelting business that the emperor was going to collect back, the family fortune of the Marquisate of Rosan\u2019s was mostly from mines and forestry.And while land-based businesses don\u2019t prosper very much, on the contrary, they don\u2019t buckle easily after decades.Like a loyal old general butler, Cedric said he would keep Artizea safe until she got used to it. Thinking about it now, he didn\u2019t know who to worry about whom.When they entered the VIP room, a simple refreshment was served. Looking at the number of glasses, it seemed that the number of guests to come was three.Artizea sat down and said.\u201cI think I have some time left. If you have any questions, ask me.\u201dFreil hesitated.There were a lot of questions. But he couldn\u2019t decide what to ask and how far to ask.The opponent was the master\u2019s fianc\u00e8e, but he just couldn\u2019t accept it that way.For a person like Artizea, even a question becomes a matter of handing over information.How can he be sure that she is not an enemy?\u201cAre you doing a lot of secret things?\u201d Freil asked.\u201cMaybe the people of the Grand Duke of Evron are not familiar with such secrecy, but it will happen more frequently from now on.\u201d\u201cIs it because the Lady intends to go out in earnest to society?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not interested in the social world, but if you\u2019re asking if I will create more secrets, the answer is yes, that\u2019s right. Until now, Grand Duke Evron has been overly honest. Someone has to be in charge of secrets.\u201d\u201cHonesty is the right thing. The Grand Duke is a right man.\u201dArtizea smiled inside the veil.\u201cI know. In fact, until now, Evron has not even had enough capacity to hide something. It is normal to have several factions split within Evron.\u201dHe couldn\u2019t deny it.\u201cThe result is now. His Highness\u2019 words have trust, and the Evron has honor, but in fact, the Grand Duke is only in a position to be returned to the battlefield.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t know you thought so about His Highness.\u201d\u201cThe truth is, it always hurts. Sir Freil, do you think His Majesty the Emperor sent him to the Western Front in hopes that the Grand Duke would reap his military merits?\u201dThere were many things to say to Freil.However, the conversation could not continue. It was because the first guest had arrived.A little fuss came through the thick wooden door. Artizea lowered her hand under the table.Her mood had changed. Freil bit his lips. Because he knew that the original purpose of coming here had begun.The door burst open.It was a middle-aged man who jumped in.\u201cYou can\u2019t be so rude like this, Sir Lexen.\u201d\u201cAre you saying I\u2019m going to do something bad? I\u2019m just trying to talk to the madam first!\u201dTwo young men were dragging him by his arm, and were embarrassed to see Artizea.Artizea looked at the men expressionlessly. The young men quickly bowed and stepped back.Freil thought this was also staged.There was no way he could believe that those two men were the only ones working for Artizea. Besides, if they truly meant to keep him away, it wouldn\u2019t be impossible to really stop a middle-aged man.Lexen straightened his collar and stood upright. And said,\u201cI\u2019m sorry for meeting you like this, madam. Even though I keep saying that I should meet you in person, your representative has not listened to me, so I\u2019ve been rude.\u201d\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t make any difference by meeting me first.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure you would have thought that the representative was of course a trustworthy person for the madam, but he doesn\u2019t seem to know anything important.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t get excited and sit down, Sir Lexen. And take a sip of water.\u201dArtizea reached out her hand and offered him a seat.Lexen sat down. He then realized that his attitude was rude and apologized.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m tired.\u201d\u201cSince the priest hasn\u2019t come here yet, I\u2019ll listen to you until then,\u201d Artizea said.\u201cIsn\u2019t it ridiculous to get a divorce in exchange for taking over the farmland?\u201dSaid Lexen. He tried to keep his cool as much as possible, but he couldn\u2019t do so and ended up with a fierce voice.Artizea looked at him with cold eyes. Even under the veil, Lexen could feel the gaze.\u201cYou seem to have a misunderstanding. I have no interest in the Lexen family.\u201d\u201cBut my representative tells me to divorce and marry madam\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cSir Lexen.\u201dArtizea interrupted him.\u201cYou owe an an irreparable level of debt due to stupid investments you made over and over again. You surely have not forgotten the amount written on the loan?\u201dArtizea said coldly. Lexen stuttered.\u201cSo, didn\u2019t you tell me to tell my wife that I\u2019m going to hand over the farmland, the forest, and the grain stores?\u201cYou don\u2019t really think that the western farmland has value, do you?\u201dArtizea tapped the table. Lexen\u2019s face turned white.\u201cIt\u2019s an operation that\u2019s well worth the investment. It\u2019s fertile land. This year, we\u2019ve harvested close to 10,000 pounds of wheat per hectare, and pastures are best suited for growing sheep nearby.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not in doubt that the land is fertile,\u201d Artizea said.\u201cThis year\u2019s crop was good. I think it\u2019ll be okay next year. What about the next year? Could it be harvested?\u201dLexen\u2019s complexion turned pale.\u201cDo you really think that there are people who buy land at such a high price that might be swept away by the monster wave, Sir Lexen? It\u2019s much safer to buy wheat and wool than to buy land with this money.\u201dEven if the safe eastern land prices soar to the sky, the western land prices never move. This is because no one would know when the monster wave will come.Ironically, that is why farming, the foundation of the empire, was not maintained. Landlords and businessmen never bought land in the West.\u201cThis money is the price to pay for your title. I thought you knew.\u201dArtizea smiled under the veil.\u201cIf you think that the amount is insufficient, you can destroy the contract even now. Because I have not signed any documents yet.\u201dLexen appealed with his sad face.\u201cMadam, even if the monster wave happens at short intervals, it takes more than 3 years. This business has enough potential\u2026\u2026..\u201d\u201cIf so, you can find an investor who believes in that possibility.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t the Madam a nobleman too? I believe you will be able to understand my situation a little. My wife is from a commoner. If she divorces me, she will have no place in the social world. I have been married for 35 years already\u2026..\u201d\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 40": "Chapter 40Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 40Proofreader: xoxomonamiArtizea cut him off.\u201cI\u2019m already being generous at the level of a philanthropist, Sir Lexen. What I\u2019m asking for is a marriage certificate that will give me the name of Mrs. Lexen, and to make sure this transaction is unknown, you hand over all your assets and move to the East to stay quiet. For that, I decided to rent a small manor for free.\u201d\u201cMadam\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cAfter relocating to the East, you don\u2019t have to declare that you are legally divorced from your wife. If you don\u2019t want to enter the social world, there is no problem.That\u2019s it,\u201c Artizea said.In general, the transaction of title is made through a successor.Those who want to buy titles marry their successors. Then, as a spouse of the successor, they will inherit it, and the family\u2019s surname is changed.And it ends when the child takes over the position as a successor. It is a transaction spanning three generations.In some cases, the successor of the family who sold the title, but it was okay if not.This is because if the spouse\u2019s approval is given, inheritance is possible even if the child is out of marriage. So, it was common to divorce after granting inheritance rights.Artizea did not demand that far.Lexen knew Artizea as a rich businesswoman who wanted to establish herself in the Crates Empire.Therefore, instead of buying the title as it is, she is only trying to obtain the name of Mrs. Lexen.By marrying a successor, inheriting an inheritance, and divorcing them, you can obtain the title, but you cannot obtain an imperial lineage.Even in the social world, a noble woman with an imperial husband is better than a foreigner who bought the title in many ways. Eventually, the words came up to Lexen\u2019s throat, asking if it was because of her own interests.But Artizea wasn\u2019t wrong.In the end, the eldest son of Lexen will inherit the Lexen family.The only thing lost is honor and wealth. The title remains intact. His descendants will have a chance to come back as nobles.However, his wife is in a different position. If Artizea was active in the capital\u2019s social circle under the name of Mrs. Lexen, relatives and acquaintances could not be unaware of the circumstances.It would be better if the divorce was real. However, if he signs another marriage certificate, then if he still lives with his current wife, she becomes a mistress in an instant.A disgrace, but his wife will not be able to easily reach the temple.Lexen bowed his head deeply.\u201cI can\u2019t abandon my wife.\u201d\u201cThen, you\u2019ll go bankrupt together. There will be a lot of hardships for the two of you until you die.\u201dArtizea pointed at the door with her hand. It was an order to get out.Lexen\u2019s complexion turned pale.She has said many things, but the one who was at a disadvantage was Lexen.Artizea chose him as the best trading partner for several reasons.As a low-ranking aristocrat in the western region, it is difficult enough to sell his title. At the same time, he had no strength, no fame, and he was an unobtrusive opponent even if he disappeared.However, Lexen is not the only poor noble of similar circumstances.It was more so considering that what Artizea needed was not the title of inheritance itself, but the marriage certificate.While Lexen sighed for a moment, a new guest arrived.The second guest was a priest.\u201cOh. Madam, no matter how simple it is, it\u2019s a wedding, and you wore a black veil.\u201dThe priest looked at Artizea and said so with a laugh.However, he was already a man who had already received a large bribe from Artizea. He knew well that this marriage was not a normal marriage. He didn\u2019t say anything else.Lexen sat silently.The secretary, who followed the priest, laid down several documents in front of Lexen.Among them were divorce papers. The divorce papers already had Mrs. Lexen\u2019s signature.Artizea had already worked on it separately. Lexen realized it and trembled a little. But in the end all the papers were signed. The secretary handed out the divorce papers to the priest.The priest brought out the marriage vows. The secretary first brought it to Lexen.When Lexen signed, this time the papers came to Artizea.Freil glanced over the papers.[Terry Ford]It was already signed that way.After Artizea checked it, the secretary brought it to the priest.There was no formal exchange of gifts. The priest smiled with a big smile and acted as a witness that made it all true.\u201cI hereby inform you that this marriage was formally established before God. Congratulations Sir Lexen, Mrs. Lexen.\u201dLexen\u2019s face turned gray.\u201cI want to give a gift to the priest as a sign of gratitude,\u201d Artizea said.The secretary gave the box prepared in advance to the priest. The priest laughed as if embarrassed.Artizea said softly.\u201cIn commemoration of this marriage, please use it for good things instead of us.\u201d\u201cIf so\u2026\u201dThe priest stood up with the box. Artizea instructed the secretary to see him off.And looked at Lexen.\u201cYou can go back now.\u201d\u201cIs this\u2026 the end?\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s it. All your debts are cleared. Go back now. Your estate manager will clean up the rest of your financial ties and tell you where to go. I want you to spend your life quietly, happily with your wife, without much socializing.\u201dLexen wandered for a while while standing up.But in the end, he couldn\u2019t talk to Artizea again. He turned around and went out.Freil was confused.He was caught in a subtle and strange feeling.The signature on the marriage vows was Terry Ford. Of course, Artizea is not going to use her name directly.Making Lexen feel as if he was married to Artizea herself was an intentional illusion. This is to prevent him from knowing who his real opponent is.\u2018Whoever it is, it\u2019s the Heiress\u2019 henchman.\u2019Freil thought so.\u2018A grain dealer\u2026\u2019Something caught his mind.Artizea\u2019s words were absolutely right. There was little value in western farmland.There are grain vendors in the west as well, but it meant nothing to big figures like the Marquisate of Rosan. It\u2019s probably cheaper to buy than the building in this capital where they sit now.\u2018Lending a manor in the east would actually be for surveillance. \u2018And no matter where or how Mrs. Lexen appears, no doubts will arise.There was no gap at all.Artizea has natural intelligence, wisdom, determination, prudence and observation.She had a trusted figure named Marcus Hanson. Thanks to that, there were also trusted servants who asked Hanson for work.But Freil knew a little about Marcus. He and his children are far from conspiring.As soon as she acquired a huge wealth, she established a safe house, separated the assets that could be hidden, and invested in other places under a new name.Freil knew about testing the employees of the Grand Duke\u2019s Residence.It looked like an attack but on the contrary, it seemed to be engaging in counterintelligence.Based on that behavior, she is probably forming an information network. Freil was able to bet about 100 gold in the fact that she would have started working on other mansions at the same time.Is all this really possible? For an 18-year-old girl who had just barely gone out of reach from her abusive mother\u2019s hands?Freil didn\u2019t take her lightly just because she was young.It was at that age that Emperor Gregor became the adopted son of the previous Empress and was engaged to the present empress who was from the Duchy of Riagan. Already by then he was a politician.Even now. He would not have been surprised if Lord Lawrence and Roygar had shown such insight at the age of 18. At the age of 18, they were already in the midst of a political struggle.But Artizea was different. Not long ago, she was in a situation where she had to wear a shortened dress with a layer of cloth. She wouldn\u2019t know how to deal with money.Miraila herself, was the emperor\u2019s favorite mistress and social star, but her daughter was seldom seen out.It caught his mind. However, the reason was unclear.Artizea smiled and looked at Freil.Unlike Freil, she had all the information, so Artizea could read all the confused thoughts in his head.Knock, knock.Freil\u2019s thoughts stopped.It was because the third guest had arrived.\u201cThis is Terry Ford, my Lady.\u201dA woman in plain brown clothes knelt on both knees as soon as the door opened. It was the symbol of complete obedience.Terry Ford was not a name Artizea had known since her previous life. It means that her existence had not played such an important role back then. Also, it never showed any kind of talent.But she reached out to Artizea herself. Terry was a senior maid of the Weave\u2019s own family.Viscount Weave was a relative of the family of the Marquis of Luden, the father of Grand Duke Roygar and Marchioness Camellia.After being sent on errands, several trips to and from the Viscounty, she realized something.The cleaning maid was collecting small rumors from the master\u2019s family.It wasn\u2019t important information. That Marchioness Camellia has come to like light purple velvet these days, or the Marquis made a bet that took 1,000 gold to determine whether this year\u2019s vintage barque Wine would join the ranks of luxury goods at the gentleman\u2019s club.Perhaps such information is also useful somewhere.However, it was a waste of time to stop it.The maid whispered to her that the person giving her money was a reporter for a newspaper. He seems to be planning to dig up a scandal involving Marchioness Camellia.However, after watching the process closely for two months, Terry was convinced that it was a lie. The employer couldn\u2019t be a newspaper reporter.Terry wanted to meet the real master. The one holding the laces of the money bag, the superior to serve, the precious noble who can\u2019t even tie their own shoelaces, and the kind of person who controls a person\u2019s life or death with a few fingers.Terry was smart.And she wanted to gamble.Big bets were needed for big rewards. She had a wish, and she was ready to risk her life for that wish.Terry backtracked the maid to reach the person who sent the gift directly from Alice.And she said she has important information that cannot be traded with something like silver coins.Artizea was interested in her. It\u2019s not because she thought Terry\u2019s information was great. This is because she was able to come to know Artizea\u2019s existence by herself.Of course, her intelligence organization was still poor.However, from the top, Alice was still clumsy. That\u2019s why she was asked to deal with small things like rumors or attires, not real information.But that didn\u2019t mean that a maid could find and dig up by herself alone.So Artizea met her.[\u201cI heard that the lady is buying information.\u201d]Terry said so. Her complexion was pale, but she was full of determination.Artizea asked slowly.[\u201cWhat kind of great information did you come to me to sell?\u201d][\u201cI want to sell my life.\u201d]\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I think I can get rid of you of your neck enough with 2 gold. Even if you risk your life, it\u2019s nothing to me,\u201d Artizea said.\u201cAnyone who has a vengeful spirit is helpful enough to not throw up anything even if they are set on fire.\u201dTerry said so and tried to put her hand into the furnace to prove what she was saying. Alice caught her hurriedly.Artizea laughed bitterly.\u201cThere is no need to do anything stupid to prove your determination. Wouldn\u2019t it rather be useless if you get a big burn?\u201d\u201cThen will you listen to my request?\u201d\u201cEven if I use you, I can\u2019t send you to the Roygar Grand Duchy as Marchioness Camellia\u2019s maid, Terry. She already knows almost everything about you. That means Marchioness Camellia can easily find out.\u201dArtizea said so.\u201cAnd even if you\u2019re useful, I might not grant your wish.\u201d\u201cBut you\u2019re going to destroy Grand Duke Roygar and Marchioness Camellia, right?\u201dTerry\u2019s father was a baron\u2019s second son. The title was not inherited, but the rank was at the end of the nobility.Her only sister caught the interest of Grand Duke Roygar. While Grand Duchess Roygar was dissatisfied with it.Nothing really happened. Terry\u2019s older sister wasn\u2019t foolish enough to pay attention to a man with a wife.Terry\u2019s older sister even took refuge in a relative\u2019s house in the western region to avoid it.Nevertheless, Marchioness Camellia murdered Terry\u2019s older sister to comfort her brother\u2019s heart.The murder was tricky. Terry\u2019s sister\u2019s murder was disguised as suicide.Terry\u2019s family did not believe she committed suicide. But it was impossible to reveal the truth.Probably, even if revealed, it would not hurt Grand Duke Roygar or Marchioness Camellia.This was so common that it wasn\u2019t even worth paying attention to for long.Having left alone, she abandoned her status as the daughter of a knight. And went into Viscount Weave as a maid.That was eight years ago.For eight years she realized how insignificant her existence was.\u201cThere can be no absolute power in the world. The young lady is the fianc\u00e9e of Grand Duke Evron and the sister of Lord Lawrence. For whoever it is, I know that one day the lady will fight Grand Duke Roygar.\u201dTerry looked at Artizea with clear eyes.\u201cIf you use me to increase your chances of winning, if you can destroy them by doing so, it will be my revenge in the end.\u201dThat couldn\u2019t be enough. However, as Terry, there was no other way to take revenge except to be part of the weapon Artizea would hold.Artizea knew some people with such determination.And, like Terry said, such a person was useful.\u201cGood. I will use you. If you\u2019re lucky, it might be part of the blade that will slice Grand Duke Roygar\u2019s neck.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dTerry was really pleased. It wasn\u2019t difficult to put Terry into what was going on anyway.Artizea intended to send someone to the Riagan Duchy in the south. She decided to put Terry in its place.It is unclear whether there will be any future use.However, the spy must be sent from a time when they could not even think of the hostile relationship before it becomes useful.Thanks to Terry, Artizea was able to lay a stone that is completely separate from the information organization to be created in the future.It wasn\u2019t a plan in the original blueprint, but it was a big point.\u201cRise up, Terry.\u201dArtizea took off her veil. It meant that Terry was one of her own.Terry\u2019s gaze touched Freil once.But soon fell politely. If Artizea thought he was a person she didn\u2019t care to know, she didn\u2019t care either. That\u2019s what loyalty is for.Artizea gave her the marriage certificate.Terry Ford became Lexen\u2019s wife, who didn\u2019t even know her face.\u201cYou\u2019re going to go to the South Sea under the name of Mrs. Lexen. You can tell the maid of the Weaves that you\u2019ve become lucky to be the wife of a junior noble.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cSince you said you had relatives of the Ford family in the south, it wouldn\u2019t be difficult to get into the social world. On the way, you\u2019ll receive a letter of introduction from the Duchess of Riagan\u2019s maid.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cFrom there, you\u2019ll do what you can. If possible, try to earn the duchess\u2019 trust. If you can be a maid, it\u2019s better, and if not, you should at least be a friend of the maid.\u201d\u201cYes. \u201c\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll get back to you when you\u2019re useful.\u201dArtizea gave her an ebony box lined with gold.Instead of a wedding present, Terry took out the ring from the box and put it on.Then she stood up. With the ebony box in her arms, Terry knelt again.\u201cI\u2019ll pray to God for news.\u201d\u201cThe object you should be praying for is not God, but the devil.\u201d\u201cEither way, it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\u201cGood luck,\u201d Artizea said.Terry went out.Artizea offered Freil a seat this time. Freil\u2019s mind was all confused.He walked a few steps away from Artizea\u2019s escort position.\u201cTo send a spy to the Riagan Duchy, you buy the title of a western nobleman?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201dArtizea tilted the cooled teapot on her hand.\u201cThe Duke of Riagan is not an independent power, but rather a servant who follows the orders of His Majesty the Emperor\u2026 But in order to encompass the empire, it is imperative to keep the southern powers in mind.\u201dSuddenly, the scale of the story expanded enormously.Freil\u2019s mind woke up.\u201cAre you going to jump into the battle for succession of the empire?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cAre you serious?\u201d\u201cWhy do you think I\u2019m not serious? Cedric\u2019s mother was His Majesty the Emperor\u2019s relative. From the lineage, it\u2019s not an exaggeration to say that Cedric has the right to it in the first place.\u201dArtizea said plainly. Freil replied sharply.\u201cDon\u2019t try to drag Grand Duke Evron into a pointless war.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve never thought of that before, Sir Freil. I couldn\u2019t have been the only one to suggest that.\u201dArtizea smiled.\u201cPower is something that has the nature to exclude others. This is something you have to do to survive.\u201dIf you do nothing, what\u2019s in front of Cedric is purging.The military authority who captured the hearts of the soldiers is dangerous. In addition, the people\u2019s hero is even more dangerous.If he has both of them at the same time and has an imperial lineage, he must be removed first, needless to say.Had Cedric been stupid or incompetent, he would have been fine. If so, Evron would be able to secure safety by giving their hand to one of the two successors.But Cedric is too good. Even if Freil himself is a figure in Lawrence or Roygar\u2019s, he will surely try to get rid of him.\u201cI understood the words of the Lady. But how can I trust the Lady Heiress? Sir Lawrence is the real brother of the Lady.\u201d\u201cIt would be hard to believe even if I said that an unqualified person should not be emperor,\u201d Artizea said. \u201cSo, what if I tell you that I covet the position of Empress? Is that believable?\u201d\u201cThe Lady has proposed a two-year contract marriage.\u201dSaid Freil. If being the empress was the purpose, it would have been a proper marriage rather than a limited-time contract marriage.Artizea smiled.\u201cI did.\u201dFreil bit his mouth in front of the smile.\u201cI want to prevent destruction. The only alternative was Cedric,\u201d Artizea said softly.\u201cLady Heiress.\u201d\u201cThe empire already lacks the vitality of its founding. The law has become obsolete, and there are more things that don\u2019t do its work properly,\u201d she said.\u201cNow, the emperor is high and it is maintained. His Majesty is selfish and arrogant, but not incompetent, but can brother Lawrence or Grand Duke Roygar truly unite the empire like his Majesty Gregor? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t deny it.\u201d\u201cThe north will be abandoned, the west will be destroyed by monster waves, the east will be independent, and the south will be devoured by the Eimmel kingdom. The empire will be torn to pieces.\u201dArtizea closed her eyes and breathed a huge sigh.She struggled desperately to maintain the empire after Lawrence became prince.However, it would have been better to just leave it to pieces.If it was going to perish anyway, it was better for it to fight and open a new era rather than be destroyed in the hands of the mad emperor.If so, Cedric would have had a way to make a recovery.Artizea felt anguish and placed her hand on her chest. And she tried to control her mind.\u201cBut in Cedric\u2019s way, he never holds power in imperial politics right now. In order to acquire power itself, a proper means is needed. Cedric\u2019s justice can only be realized after taking power.\u201dArtizea knew her method might not be right, but it was effective.She already had a successful experience.It wasn\u2019t a successful life, but maybe later she got tossed out, but that had nothing to do with the process of raising Lawrence as emperor.Again, Artizea had confidence that she could do it.Her role is to give Cedric power. As with Lawrence, the work after that was not hers.\u201cSo it\u2019s two years. To stand by His Grace, to do things that Evron couldn\u2019t do.\u201dFreil said so and remained silent for a while. He was wise enough to understand the meaning of Artizea\u2019s words.His heart pounded.The future, the size of the determination, the firmness, and the coolness of an only 18-year-old girl, Freil felt ashamed of himself.\u201cI understand what you mean. You\u2019re right. I\u2019m not going to tell His Grace about this.\u201dFreil breathed a small sigh.Cedric\u2019s loyalty and support all come from the fact that he was a just person.By harming it, Artizea\u2019s will cannot be fulfilled. But at the same time, she has to do something that his way cannot.Eventually Artizea will fall apart, doing what Evron cannot do.Freil knew he, himself, was the best person to help her.Because he knows how to doubt.He can doubt Artizea and doubt what she does. Conversely, he will be doubting any incoming information.And it can be judged beyond Cedric\u2019s knowledge.What is needed for this kind of work is not loyalty. It is distrust and prudence.That\u2019s why she revealed everything to Freil even though she knew it could be a threat to her organization.He slowly knelt in front of Artizea. And, as in a pledge of allegiance, he bowed his head and kissed the back of her hand.\u201cYou will need support, right? I will be with you.\u201dArtizea gave a small nod.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 42": "Chapter 42Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 42Proofreader : xoxomonamiThe garden of Grand Duke Evron\u2019s residence was quite neglected.Like other places in the mansion, it was inevitable because the owner did not take care of it.Horses and hunting dogs were grazing on the grounds, and idle servants were hiding. The old leaves and branches were also entangled in their own way, so it was a space that had nothing to do with aesthetics.Cedric was no exception if the place stood out from others because he didn\u2019t care about appearances.The main gate was managed at least, but at best, it was enough to mow the lawn and cut the branches on time.\u201cI have to make a new road.\u201dThe grass grew unruly. Recently, he hurriedly mowed the grass and made a trail, because a woman in fine clothes would not be able to comfortably walk around.Cedric looked embarrassed. He thought that it wouldn\u2019t matter as long as support and defense were well maintained. He thought it didn\u2019t matter letting the horse and dogs loose.However, when walking with Artizea, there weren\u2019t one or two things that bothered her.\u201cThis too. I feel like I\u2019m in the woods, not in the garden.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dArtizea said without thinking. Cedric covered his face with his palm.\u201cI have to call the gardener.\u201d\u201cNevertheless, Ansgar told me that he had brought in new employees. Until now, he said there were only two gardeners. This mansion is large, so it would have been difficult for both people to manage.\u201d\u201cDo you say that gardeners are called from far away?\u201d\u201cYes, from the Grand Duchy.\u201dCedric sighed briefly.\u201cEven if it takes some time, it\u2019s better to use someone you trust. The structure of the garden is particularly important for security.\u201d\u201cI know, but\u2026\u2026\u2026 But first, I have to lay the base for a temporary road.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a waste.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know when it will be in order. Isn\u2019t it difficult for you to walk right now?\u201dCedric pointed to the grass getting under the dress.She just needs to put a piece of cloth there. It was a little difficult to walk with shoes. Artizea lifted the hem of her dress and crossed a clump of grass.\u201cIt is sometimes. Won\u2019t it be like a change of mood?\u201d\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be sometimes.\u201dArtizea looked at him, tilting her head.\u201cDid the doctor not recommend it? Take a walk every day.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026I\u2019m paying attention.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not paying attention to the doctor\u2019s recommendation, are you? I was scolded by Ansgar today.\u201d\u201cWe eat breakfast together every day. That\u2019s enough for you to care for me.\u201d\u201cIs it bothersome that I keep pushing my face in front of you?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s not.\u201dArtizea looked at him with an embarrassed look. She never thought it was bothersome. However, she just thought he didn\u2019t have to do that for her.\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s enough to just say what you needed to say.\u201dIt was.Artizea knew Cedric well, but Cedric did not know her very well.Even if it\u2019s a contract marriage, it\u2019s a marriage, and even if you\u2019re married, it\u2019s not that you\u2019re going to be separated and never know each other.Not only as a couple, but also between the master and slave, appropriate understanding and trust are needed.Artizea knew it well enough to die for it, so she nodded.\u201cSorry.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cBecause I can\u2019t tell you everything honestly.\u201dArtizea lowered her eyes. Cedric asked curiously.\u201cDid it sound like I\u2019m blaming you?\u201d\u201cNo. It\u2019s not like that\u2026.\u201dArtizea hesitated.It has been a long time since she gave up on being understood by others.Rather, it\u2019s okay for someone to have the kind of mindset like Freil.But she was hesitant to ask for human understanding apart from all that.Even if she was a vicious human, it was difficult to ask to believe that she was doing her best for the future.It was more comfortable for Artizea to admit that she was a wicked person rather than to ask for understanding.Since she is a wicked person who will fall to hell, it was more comfortable to fear and hate her so that she could move according to her will.Cedric knew that she could be trusted, at least someone he could try to.Instead of taking the easy way to condemn her even in the last minute, he was a person who could bow his head to try and help the world.Therefore, even saying this requires great courage.\u201cEven if it looks like I\u2019m hiding something from Cedric, or even if I\u2019ve done something nasty, I\u2019m not going to do it with hostility\u2026.\u201d Artizea said carefully.\u201cIf you want to know something, ask me the reasons why.\u201dIf he did that, she thought she would be happy to die even if she would lose her head and climb the gallows.\u201c\u2026..\u201dCedric was silent for a moment.He wanted to ask why she said that, but strangely the words didn\u2019t come out.Even if he didn\u2019t hear the answer, he felt like he knew it.Perhaps obviously, when that happens, she\u2019ll know why too.That\u2019s what he thought.He reached out his hand. This is because Artizea\u2019s lowered eyelashes were glistening, and it looked like tears had formed.\u201cCedric?\u201d\u201cNo, no, nothing.\u201dHe came to his senses and lowered his hand.Cedric thought he had a strange idea. Why is he thinking that she will do a rough job without his knowledge? And even so, he can understand itAnd then he even wanted to hug her. All three were strange ideas.Artizea promised to consult him before devising a scheme.It\u2019s natural she doesn\u2019t say everything. Cedric had nothing to interfere with the work in the Marquisate of Rosan.It wasn\u2019t strange at all trying to hide the shadow she had in her mind.Cedric reached out to her. Artizea hesitated.\u201cThe road is rough. It is strange to say that inside the house.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dArtizea carefully placed her hand over Cedric\u2019s hand.Cedric grabbed her hand and let her put her arms around him.He still had the idea of \u200b\u200bwanting to hug her, but it was too early so he decided to be satisfied with this.\u201cI\u2019ll make sure to lay the road properly sooner or later. If you\u2019re going to take a walk for exercise, that would be great.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dCedric\u2019s hands and neck were warm.Artizea couldn\u2019t stop her face from blushing.As they walked side by side, it was all good that Cedric\u2019s face was not visible in the eyes of Artizea.The two walked a little longer without a word.\u201cSo, is there anything I can do to help you prepare for the wedding? No, I should say I have to help\u2026 it\u2019s my job,\u201d Cedric asked.\u201cNone.\u201dArtizea replied immediately. Cedric turned to her with an embarrassed face.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to say it so firmly, do you?\u201d\u201cDid you fill out all the invitations?\u201d\u201cYes, I will write only what I will send to His Majesty and Grand Duke Roygar, and Ansgar will be responsible for the rest.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s enough. You got the formal dress. I\u2019ll do the rest.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s because I only seem to be doing nothing. You look incredibly busy, and you have a lot to do.\u201dShe did.Marriage, the birth of a successor, and funeral were the most important things in the noble family.Among them, there has never been more work to be done than marriage, where family unity takes place.Artizea doesn\u2019t even have parents to do those things for her.She had to prepare for the wedding while preparing for the Marquisate of Rosan.Artizea\u2019s wedding arrangements include preparing wedding dresses and gifts or preparing wedding invitations. However, the priority was to lay a stone for the future while adjusting various interests.However, there is a limit to the physical strength and mental strength that can be used per day. Artizea had to pay attention to the distribution as she did not have a very energetic body.In order to maintain a clear mental power, she had to take a break, so the problems that ordinary brides care about were forced to be pushed to the back.Cedric felt sorry for that.\u201cAren\u2019t you so busy that you are barely preparing for yourself?\u201d\u201cBut I can\u2019t help it.\u201d\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t say that, Tia. I\u2019ll be doing the chores, and you\u2019ll have to prepare for yourself.\u201d\u201cAnsgar is in charge of the chores. The most important preparations are made without a hitch. Don\u2019t worry,\u201d Artizea replied.Cedric sighed. His chest was stuffy, but he couldn\u2019t figure out exactly why.He thought he wished Artizea would be more concerned with this marriage.He didn\u2019t want to say that a wedding is more important than what she is trying to do, or that marriage is the most important thing in a woman\u2019s life.But marriage is marriage.Even if it is a contract marriage with a time limit, it is a marriage. And Artizea is a bride.And he thought it would be nice if Artizea made good memories at the wedding. It was even more so because she was a girl who had never been in the leading role before.He wanted to make her happy for a moment.\u201cThis is our marriage.\u201dThe words he said were barely squeezed out because he wasn\u2019t good at speaking.The main thing in this wedding is neither a scheme nor a conspiracy.It is \u2018our marriage.\u2019 After his mouth said those words, his heart pounded.\u201cDo I look nervous?\u201d\u201cA little.\u201dCedric thought about how to properly convey his feelings.\u201cWhen I got engaged to you, the Western military problem had already been resolved. Remember I first said that I\u2019m going to accept the contract for the Western Army?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cOur purpose has been achieved in the first place. I\u2019ve been granted the Western Army\u2019s victory ceremony, and you\u2019ve gotten out of Miraila. So think slowly for now. At least until the wedding. There is a lot of time left for us to be together.\u201dCedric said, gently patting the back of her hand.Artizea lowered her eyes. It was to hide the fire rising to her face.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not forgetting it.\u201dThe word \u2018our marriage\u2019 tickled her ear strangely.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I\u2019m not trying to make you comfortable, but it\u2019s because I can\u2019t believe you.\u201d\u201cAm I so incompetent?\u201d\u201cBecause there are areas that suit people, and there are areas that don\u2019t. Can you understand why Countess Katasha and Countess Paella both wrote letters saying they would come in tan dresses?\u201dCedric shook his head silently, as he couldn\u2019t even guess.\u201cThe two are competing with each other in the social world. They are having a war of nerves over the dress, saying the other person copied them. They\u2019re trying to gain the upper hand by telling me in advance.\u201d\u201cShould I care about that?\u201d\u201cIf you care a little, you can prevent the trouble, but there is no reason not to.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u2026 maybe, if I have my subordinates do that, I guess they would follow the rules and then tell them to settle for themselves when a fight arises.\u201d\u201cWould Cedric like that?\u201d\u201cI prefer to prevent the disturbance in advance. I don\u2019t know how.\u201dHe looked at Artizea with a look of attention. Artizea smiled.\u201cThey don\u2019t have to be seated at the same table, but you just have to sit them down with another person who needs to pay attention to.\u201dArtizea gave him the right answer.Of course, it is a matter to think about where to actually place them.Cedric finally shook his head.\u201cDon\u2019t worry because Ansgar helps me well. I can\u2019t ask Cedric for such chores.\u201d\u201cNo matter what you think, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m useful in the entire capital. It\u2019s only that I saved you time to practice dancing.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s step on each other\u2019s feet and pretend not to know\u2026.\u201dOn second thought, she felt cheated, so Artizea said so. As she thought about it, her cheeks turned red unknowingly.\u201cI know you don\u2019t attend social gatherings very much, but when did you practice dancing like that?\u201d\u201cI think I have a sense of rhythm. I learned it easily when I was young. I have been praised by my dance teacher many times.\u201d\u201cYou knew you were a good dancer, didn\u2019t you?\u201dCedric\u2019s face also blushed.\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to make fun of you. I mean it.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think you were trying to make fun of me. Thank you. It was the first time I ever danced like that at a ball.\u201dThen Cedric\u2019s face turned redder.Artizea answered plainly.But when Cedric became awkward, she became very awkward, and bowed his head.The two returned to the mansion silently, staring at different places.\u201cLady! You\u2019re late!\u201dSophie hurried out, saw Cedric and was startled, stopping her steps.\u201cI, I\u2019m sorry, Grand Duke.\u201d\u201cNo. Is there anything urgent?\u201d\u201cMy lady, you really can\u2019t do this. Did you forget that today\u2019s the wedding dress fitting?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t forget. Is Madame Emily already here?\u201d\u201cYes. Honestly, you forgot your last fitting, but you have to do it right today. You don\u2019t have enough time.\u201dArtizea sighed a little. It was troublesome.Cedric was looking at her.Cedric opened his mouth, but he was stunned. Quite a long time. That\u2019s because it was a matter of determination.\u201cShall we see it together?\u201d\u201cThe wedding dress fitting?\u201d\u201cWell, first of all, I\u2019m the groom, right?\u201dArtizea had a perplexed face. Awkward air flowed between the two.It is common to invite a husband or fiance to the Tuvalet room. Even more, if it\u2019s a love marriage, they would have seen the wedding dress together.However, even though they lived in one house, the two were not close enough.Rather, they were able to talk positively without a wall when sharing about political opinions or discussing practical and serious discussions.However, when it came to a strangely personal situation, it was awkward and they couldn\u2019t even speak.Cedric hesitated when entering the Tuvalet room.Even Artizea couldn\u2019t tell him to come in either.Cedric said with a slightly reddened face.\u201cI\u2019m sorry to say something useless. I was afraid you might be embarrassed.\u201d\u201cOh, no.\u201dArtizea bowed her head.\u201cThen go in first. I have to go back out.\u201d\u201cYes. Go ahead!\u201dArtizea greeted and turned around.Did Cedric have a schedule to go out? She searched her memories, but couldn\u2019t know for certain whether she just couldn\u2019t think of it or if she truly just didn\u2019t know. It was because her head was blank, as if it had turned white for a moment.Artizea took her mechanical steps to the Tuvalet room. She felt Cedric\u2019s gaze still standing behind her back.Even her left feet and right feet had cooled down, so she doubted that she was walking properly.Sophie followed Artizea\u2019s and whispered.\u201cLady, why did you do that?\u201d\u201cWhat did I do?\u201d\u201cIt would be nice to ask His Grace to look at it.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like Cedric is going to change the design just by looking at it.\u201d\u201cBut still. I caught a glimpse at it, and it was really pretty. If you wear it, you will surely be like a princess.\u201d\u201cI am not a child, and I do not want to be a princess.\u201dArtizea said so.As she climbed up to the second floor, Emily greeted her with a bright face.\u201cWelcome, Lady Heiress. His Grace didn\u2019t come with you?\u201dArtizea frowned slightly.\u201cI think I made a very nice dress in a short time. The Grand Duke will surely be satisfied.\u201d\u201cHe didn\u2019t come with me.\u201dSophie noticed that Artizea didn\u2019t like it very much, while Emily looked visibly disappointed.\u201cIsn\u2019t it because you\u2019re more likely to rip off Cedric than me?\u201d\u201cNo, no way.\u201dEmily fiercely denied.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing but a wedding dress. It\u2019s my clothes. All I have to do is to be satisfied, I don\u2019t intend to cause trouble for Cedric.\u201d\u201cHow can you say that? And nothing else, it\u2019s a wedding dress.\u201dEmily said as she took her sewing pins to fit Artizea\u2019s body.\u201cI understand that you\u2019re busy, but you can\u2019t be too uninterested. As a woman who makes clothes, I don\u2019t quite understand. Isn\u2019t the dress the alpha and omega of the wedding, from beginning to the end, and even the flower?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have time. I have a lot of other things to do.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. It\u2019s too tight. You have to commend me for doing this in as little as two months. It was fortunate that I was just bringing in many kinds of white cloth.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve worked hard.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve gained a little bit of weight on your arms and shoulders than when I measured it before. It looks much better. Your waist is a little better now too.\u201dShe said it looked so precarious so far, and Emily snapped her pin into her waist. Then Sophie intervened.\u201cThe butler and the kitchen are united to this purpose and are also pressuring His Grace, so she\u2019ll be looking even better soon.\u201d\u201cHis Grace Evron?\u201d\u201cYes. He became the Lady\u2019s personal snack messenger.\u201dSophie put her nose up like it\u2019s her own story.\u201cStop it. Cedric keeps bringing snacks because it\u2019s awkward.\u201d\u201cI saw the butler serving midnight snacks in Cedric\u2019s hand.\u201d\u201cMaybe. What\u2019s the big deal with talking about him to this person?\u201dArtizea scolded Sophie.But it was a serious story for Emily. She asked anxiously.\u201cWould you like to gain a little more weight?\u201d\u201cWould I have to gain such weight in a month or two?\u201d\u201cIt will look good if you gain a little more weight. That\u2019s right, but I\u2019m afraid it won\u2019t fit after sealing it in this state.\u201dEmily looked worried, and had a distressed face.\u201cIf you get in trouble, I can just tighten the waist with a corset\u2026 Now, look in the mirror.\u201dArtizea turned to the mirror as Emily told her.\u201cHow do you feel?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s well made.\u201d\u201cOf course!\u201dEmily said.The dress was designed to fit snugly on the upper body, and has a thin fabric from the waist with fine folds that spread out.\u201cIt\u2019s not the latest trendy style these days. The Lady\u2019s overall body is slim, so this neat design would be more suitable than emphasizing the curve of the body.\u201dArtizea smiled bitterly, knowing that she twisted the words \u2018dried\u2019 so gracefully.\u201cIf I had more time, I would have put on jewelry to make it shine properly, but I didn\u2019t have enough time to do that. I was still able to get the fabric embroidered with silk thread.\u201dAs Emily said so, she showed the fabric around Artizea\u2019s waist.It wasn\u2019t noticeable because it was embroidered on white fabric with white embroidery, but every time the light hit it, it shimmered.\u201cIt\u2019s too simple as a wedding dress for someone who will be the Marchioness of Rosan and the Grand Duchess of Evron, but this is the best it can get.\u201d\u201cWow! But it\u2019s really pretty!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll look so good!\u201dThe maids burst into cheers. Emily\u2019s nose rose by a centimeter.Artizea smiled bitterly.\u201cYes. Do it like this.\u201dArtizea wasn\u2019t the main character of the wedding anyway.Now the whole society is listening to the wedding, how are the bride\u2019s clothes, how are the gifts.But what everyone really expects is a scandal.How will Miralia, who slapped and trampled on her daughter, attend the wedding?What attitude will the emperor, who is showing a favorable attitude to this wedding, take on Miralia?What will the girl look like when she regains the Marquisate from her family\u2019s grip in an instant?Is it easy or not? Is it usable or not? Is the Grand Duke Evron corrupted or not?Those are the real interests.Anyway, the moment all attendees are revealed, the bride\u2019s wedding dress will become a passing topic.However, Artizea was captivated by the strange movement inside of her chest. She seemed to be anxious, and her heart was pounding with tension.Knock, knock.Then she heard a knock on the door of the Tuvalet room.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

As if she had run, she was gasping for breath.\u201cMiss.\u201d\u201cWhat happened?\u201dArtizea turned to her and asked calmly.Alice seemed to come to her senses when she saw the colorful room filled with dresses, jewelry and fabrics. Taking her breath, she strides towards Artizea.\u201cKaah! You\u2019ll get dust on it!\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t step on it!\u201dEmily\u2019s employees made a fuss, but Alice didn\u2019t seem to be inclined to do so.\u201cMy lady, the news came from the Marquisate of Rosan.\u201dAlice said quietly into Artizea\u2019s ear.Emily quickly noticed and distanced herself from Artizea. Sophie opened her eyes and tilted her head.\u201cLast night\u2026 No, this dawn, they said Bill died.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dIt looks like Rye did the job right.\u201cWell done.\u201dArtizea praised Alice.It\u2019s too trivial this time. However, it is important to hear the news even a little earlier than others.For Alice, the work of dealing with information was no different. She was commendable.Alice grinned with delight.\u201cYes. Nora came to deliver the news to me. She is a maid who worked in the laundry room.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll remember.\u201dThis is all due to the effects of offering bribes in the name of gifts.She was told to let them know if there was any news, and she ran as soon as she knew that this incident had happened and delivered it to Alice.Sophie heard the name Nora and opened her ears.\u201cWho is Nora?\u201d\u201cOh, that\u2019s\u2026.\u201d\u201cBill is dead.\u201dAlice looked at Artizea, wondering if she had to hide it.Artizea nodded her head in an attitude that was not in the slightest surprise or agitation.Miraila\u2019s butler died. Anyway, the news would spread even after half a day.Articles will also appear in the newspaper this week. There was no reason to hide it.\u201cOh my gosh!\u201dSophie was startled and stopped the scream with her hand. Emily shouted in surprise too.Since Miraila had been to Emily\u2019s several times, most of her staff knew about Bill.Amazement and shock spread.\u201cOh, how did that happen?\u201d\u201cLast night the madam, alas.\u201dAlice stopped talking, and she quickly shut her mouth. It was noticeable that she had mentioned Miraila.Artizea shook her head lightly and gave a sign that it didn\u2019t matter. Then Alice said with confidence.\u201cIt looks like the Madam hit Bill in her hysteria, so he got angry and went out for a drink in the middle of the night.\u201d\u201cThen?\u201d\u201cHe didn\u2019t come back until morning. The Madam got up in the morning and looked for Bill, but she was angry again because he wasn\u2019t there. So the servants went around all the nearby bars and looked for him, and they found him. He fell down on the street and died.\u201d\u201cOh my God. Was it a heart attack or something like that?\u201d\u201cNo, but someone hit him with a stone from the back and stole his wallet. It\u2019s a frequent crime in the neighborhood. Bill was unlucky to fall forward and hit his head wrongly and died in an instant.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s terrible.\u201dSophie muttered to herself, Emily asked again.\u201cDid they find the culprit?\u201d\u201cNo. I reported it to the police, but there is no hope of finding the criminal.\u201d\u201cI suppose so.\u201d\u201cI heard they will investigate but there\u2019s not much to say. I guess it\u2019s hard to say that it was done and disguised by someone with a grudge. They said Bill took out his wallet at the bar and splashed money last night.\u201dRye has never disappointed Artizea in this matter.This completely hides the source of the book copied by Bill.Artizea hid a satisfying smile.Emily asked in bewilderment.\u201cWhy the hell did he do that?\u201d\u201cHe would have said he lived this miserable life to get this money. The butler is not like that once or twice.\u201dSophie answered in a small voice. But it was a tone of compassion.\u201cI hated the butler more than the Madam, but to hear he\u2019s dead\u2026\u201d\u201cThe Madam\u2026 What did she say? He was her favorite butler.\u201d\u201cI think she was shocked. She fainted.\u201dAt Alice\u2019s answer, Emily turned to Artizea. Artizea returned the gaze with an indifferent expression.Emily put her eyes down.\u201cI see.\u201dEmily didn\u2019t even say her next words, but Artizea knew what she had come up with.She herself came here, and some time ago, Lawrence also left the house. Miraila was left alone in that house.In such a situation, even the butler was killed. She must have wondered if it would be okay to just leave her alone.As Artizea looked at her silently, Emily hurriedly lowered her gaze.She is a renowned seamstress, so the ladies are friendly, but she wasn\u2019t in a position to face Artizea and talk easily.It was a sin to dare to come up with advice. In addition, Emily knew about Artizea\u2019s inner situation. She was so sorry that she tried to show her sympathy for Miraila.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Lady Heiress.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s there to be sorry about?\u201dEmily politely bowed her head.\u201cAlice, the maid named Nora is not gone yet?\u201d\u201cYes. I urgently told her to wait for a while to inform you of the news, and then came up. Maybe she wants to see you.\u201d\u201cI want to, but I can\u2019t meet her because I\u2019m in this situation. You can treat her to a cup of tea in my place.\u201d\u201cYes, thank you, Miss.\u201dAlice bowed her head to say her greetings and ran out. This is because she knew that the word \u2018in my place\u2019 means to give a reward instead.As for Alice, she was able to make her face big.Sophie hesitated and said.\u201cMiss, can I go out for a while?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThank you! I worked in the laundry room before serving you, and I know Nora well. Thank you, I\u2019ll be here soon!\u201dSophie followed Alice.Emily continued to work silently for a while.When Sophie\u2019s fuss disappeared, the Tuvalet room became very cold.Artizea got bored and asked Emily.\u201cYou\u2019re done with the wedding dress, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cYes, but there were many things I wanted to show you\u2026\u201dEmily said with a fretful face as if it was unfortunate.With big guests like a bride preparing to get married, the combination of their demeanor, excitement, and accustomedness to large expenditures, creates a fearlessness to the world.However, Artizea was not as excited as she thought and the least she could do was save her face. She was the first to have such great fortune and didn\u2019t know how to use it.But she had one thing that would make Emily happy.She had lived a long time in the Marquisate of Rosan. The unit of money in the accounts book was far beyond the budget of a family.\u201cYou\u2019ve already taken the dimensions, so do anything else on your own. You don\u2019t have to worry about the money.\u201dEmily\u2019s cheeks rose brightly.\u201cWhen the Grand Duke said that, you said it was a waste.\u201d\u201cBecause it\u2019s not my money, but the money that Cedric uses.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous to call it a waste!\u201dEmily said in a shrill voice, and at this time she was full of energy, causing Artizea to flinch.\u201cI know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201dCedric\u2019s spending money on her also has functional value. It didn\u2019t matter much.Yet, she felt embarrassed for no reason. Maybe it was because she felt sorry for being treated as a bride even though it wasn\u2019t even a real marriage\u300cThis is \u2018our marriage\u2019.\u300dThe sound of her beating heart seemed to be spreading to her ear.Artizea rolled her eyes down and felt a strange heat rising from the corner of her heart.Cedric needs to be careful with his words. She knows he\u2019s not trying to seduce a woman, but his sincere face and sincere voice were overly powerful.Artizea knew that she understood what he wanted to say.In any case, the Artizea in his eyes is an 18-year-old who just got out of her mother\u2019s grasp.It must have seemed sad that she was focusing on conspiring rather than preparing for marriage.\u2018Don\u2019t be nervous, don\u2019t be pressured, but still, because it is a marriage, enjoy all that you can enjoy as a bride.\u2019\u2018Because you are a kind person.\u2019She\u2019s someone who didn\u2019t deserve such consideration.With that in mind, the heat moving in her chest cooled down.And her head was full of work to do.She couldn\u2019t think slowly, like Cedric said. If she has six hands, she would be moving all of them.There\u2019s nothing good about stalling time. It is better to drop Lawrence as soon as possible.Emily denied it when she found herself lost in thought.\u201cNo. I don\u2019t think you know me at all.\u201d\u201cMadam Emily.\u201d\u201cA man on the verge of marriage is the time when he invests the most in a woman in his lifetime. The upper limit is no different from what he receives at this time. You should not lower that limit yourself!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019m the Marchioness of Rosan.\u201dEmily mumbled and bit her mouth.\u201cHe\u2019s not going to have any financial difficulties\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t say anything, just do your job well. Don\u2019t you know more about what you need for a cloth product? I don\u2019t have time to take care of each one.\u201d\u201cLady Heiress.\u201dThe happy marriage that Emily envisioned was not the concern of Artizea. It wasn\u2019t going to happen.It was Artizea herself that made the people around her mistake it for a love marriage, so she had nothing to say otherwise.\u201cIt\u2019s Sophie who manages my wardrobe, so tell her. I\u2019ll pay a generous amount for her labor expenses.\u201dEmily sighed.\u201cI thought you could see the light now\u2026..\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t making and wearing beautiful clothes that change reality?\u201dArtizea said that and finished her fitting, listening to Emily\u2019s sighs.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Audience with the EmpressThe day has come to see the empress.Alice had been making a fuss since the morning.\u201cWhat should I do? Lady, is this pretty, or is this pretty?\u201d\u201cBoth are very bright colors.\u201dAlice\u2019s hand held an ivory dress and a light blue dress. Artizea shook her head.\u201cI think the light blue suits you a lot better.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to wear a dark color. Put the clothes back. There\u2019s no reason to dress up.\u201d\u201cBut still it\u2019s your first time going to the palace as the \u2018Marchioness of Rosan\u2019. It\u2019s also the first time to greet the Empress as the fiancee of Grand Duke Evron.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s nothing like that, because I\u2019m coming in quietly to the Empress.. What happened in Her Majesty\u2019s palace will not be spoken out and will not be seen by others.\u201dEighteen years ago, the empress lost all of her children.Shortly thereafter, her best friend, Viscountess Pescher, committed suicide with her husband.However, the empress\u2019s misfortune did not end there. While she was grieving and turning away from the outside affairs, the emperor reorganized the power structure of the southern nobility.He was ready to hit the Duke of Riagan, the empress\u2019s father.By the time the empress came to her senses, she was already in a state where everything was irreversible.The Duke of Riagan and his wife died in an accident shortly thereafter. Whether it was a real accident was unknown.The empress walked away and locked the door of her palace. And for 18 years she never took off her mourning clothes.It was for her children, it was for her friends, and it was for her father and mother.Outwardly, she seemed to have given up on life.\u2018Nevertheless, the emperor is wary of her empress. That\u2019s the biggest indicator.\u2019During the 18 years of the empress\u2019s despair and mourning, Emperor Gregor held Miraila and Lawrence in his arms and played a happy family game.Couldn\u2019t the anger and resentment accumulate in the heart of the empress?She is not a saint. At one time in her youth, there must have been a time when she trusted the emperor.Whether there was love in her trust or not is unknown to Artizea.It\u2019s true that with or without her love, she played a great role in bringing Emperor Gregor to his present place.Her power still remains. The emperor neither deposed the empress nor killed her.The Empress has a considerable stake on the throne of Emperor Gregor.Therefore, it is better to show herself as it is than to decorate as brightly as possible. Because a girl drunk in her romantic dreams is useless to the empress.Artizea made up her mind and refined her strategy.At an unexpected hour that day, Freil visited the Tuvalet room.\u201cIt was so close to time.\u201dFreil shrugged his shoulders.Artizea had just finished getting dressed. No matter how much he thought about it, it didn\u2019t seem like there was an urgent need for Freil to visit at this time.Freil brought out the box that he was holding. Alice tilted her head and accepted the box.\u201cWow! It\u2019s heavier than it looks, Sir Freil?\u201dAlice brought the box to the dressing table in front of Artizea and opened the lid of the box.Sophie glimpsed and exclaimed.\u201cWow, is it a jewel?\u201dWhat was inside was a blue crystal the size of a forearm. It was a deep navy blue, reminiscent of the southern sea.Artisea smiled unintentionally when she saw the shape.\u201cThis is the special salt of the South Sea. It would have been difficult to obtain such a beautiful and large crystal.\u201d\u201cSalt?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThere is a lot of good salt in the South Sea.South Sea salt was used everywhere except in the underdeveloped area in the western and northern parts of the empire. The revenue generated by the resale of salt amounted to nearly 20% of the empire\u2019s finances.\u201cMost of the salt in the South Sea is made by boiling sea water, but in some beaches in the Riagan region, it is said that salt grows like this crystal on the floor. So, salt is not expensive.\u201d\u201cBut it\u2019s really pretty.\u201d\u201cIn the Riagan region, it\u2019s something that commoners can bring and decorate if they want.\u201d\u201cIt was incredibly difficult to bring to the capital as well. Don\u2019t say that.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think the Sir brought it, but a merchant did, right?\u201dAt Artizea\u2019s words, Freil was grave.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t normal to have them bring it.\u201d\u201cGood job. But the deadline I mentioned was probably a month later.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dFreil had a frustrated face.\u201cIt\u2019s not bad. It\u2019s much better if I can take it today. I set a deadline a month later because I thought it would be difficult to get such a vivid blue crystal.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s unfair that I have to run here and there in a hurry.\u201d\u201cThe Sir has a habit of listening to one thing, but he\u2019s not careful. It\u2019s such a small thing. It doesn\u2019t matter.\u201cWhat kind of life is mine? The Lady Heiress doesn\u2019t care, when I\u2019m a big supporter of yours.\u201dArtizea laughed.\u201cI\u2019m not kidding. Before you go somewhere to drink poison and regret it.\u201d\u201cWho will poison a knight like me?\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dArtizea did not answer. It was then.\u201cYou\u2019re talking about something nasty. Poisoning.\u201dCedric said.Then he stood there and knocked on the door.\u201cI wasn\u2019t trying to\u2026. The door was open\u2026\u201d\u201cOh, Your Grace.\u201dFreil salutes him. Artizea stood up.\u201cWelcome.\u201d\u201cAre you ready to go?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dIt was after Sophie had already put a small hat on Artizea\u2019s head and fixed it with a pin.\u201cI thought I heard something about poisons\u2026.\u201d\u201cIt was a joke.\u201d\u201cWhat is that?\u201d\u201cOh, yes, it\u2019s a gift prepared by Sir Freil.\u201d\u201cFreil prepared a gift?\u201dFreil glanced at Cedric\u2019s eyes.Cedric\u2019s countenance occurred in his eye. He wasn\u2019t angry. He just fiddled with his eyebrows with his own hands.Artizea replied.\u201cYes.\u201dFrustrated Freil\u2019s brain cells sang.He couldn\u2019t tell if he knew but pretended not to know, or if he really didn\u2019t know.\u201cThe Lady Heiress said she needed salt from the Riagan region so I got it for her. That\u2019s a hundred percent not a lie. Then, I\u2019ll be on my way.\u201dFreil spoke quickly and floated away as if running away. Cedric looked away from behind him.\u2018I didn\u2019t say anything.\u2019He stroked his forehead again with his index finger.\u201cIs this a gift prepared for Her Majesty?\u201d\u201cYes, why?\u201dArtizea tilted her head and asked. Cedric grinned.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. I just thought it was a bit unexpected.\u201dHe extended his arm. Artizea put her hand on his arm.When Alice heard that, she closed the lid of the box and went out first to put it on her carriage.The two slowly came downstairs later.Cedric escorted Artizea to her carriage. Artizea took a seat and asked when the carriage door closed.\u201cWhat kind of person is Her Majesty the Empress?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it a little late to talk about it now?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just curious about Lord Cedric\u2019s impressions, not objective information. You said you would come with me. You said you weren\u2019t one of them.\u201dAt first, Artizea was going to see the Empress alone.Because she was going with Cedric, it would be like just going to say hello to a relative.Saintess Olga\u2019s heart can also be delivered through Cedric. The Empress will then give a reasonable appreciation for presenting a fine jewelry as a gift.But it shouldn\u2019t be.That\u2019s why they left the easy path and came back round.Everyone in the social world knows that she has won Saintess Olga\u2019s heart.She showed her involvement in the incident. In doing so, she revealed her desire and gaps.She created a probability that people thought she would want to take revenge on Miraila.In doing so, she aroused the empress\u2019s interest. Letting her know that she is a worthy opponent for trading.And she finally received an invitation with her own name, Artizea Rosan.However, Cedric was opposed to her meeting the empress alone.\u201cIsn\u2019t that strange? You\u2019re going to say hello as my fianc\u00e9e, but also leave me behind by going alone.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not unusual for a noble girl to see Her Majesty alone. And, as I said, I\u2019m not just trying to say hello as a relative, but I\u2019m going to make another request.\u201d\u201cAre you worried about me knowing your tactics?\u201dArtizea could not help but be embarrassed. It wasn\u2019t like that. It wasn\u2019t something she could do secretly without notifying Cedric.\u201cNo. It\u2019s not like that.\u201d\u201cIf so, let\u2019s go together. I won\u2019t interfere with what you\u2019re trying to do.\u201dCedric said in a soft voice.\u201cHer Majesty The Empress is not easy, but until now, the gates of the Empress\u2019s Palace were closed. If you see her alone, it will surely catch the attention of the social world.\u201dIt was an undesirable thing. Artizea was forced to nod her head.Despite the fact that the most important figure for Lawrence to become the prince was the empress, Artizea did not have much information about the empress.Just mentioning the empress was the biggest reason why Miraila was so angry. However it was also a problem that her palace was always closed.All the remaining employees in the palace are loyal ones who gave their lives to the Empress. The few guests who came and went were all of the empress\u2019s very close friends.There was no one who could be bought with money.It would have been possible to take the time to intimidate the family or create weaknesses with things like beauty.But instead of working so hard, Artizea solved it so easily. Under the emperor\u2019s acquiescence, she set fire to the empress\u2019s palace.It was after the saint\u2019s oracle came out. Now she had calculated that Lawrence could acquire his legitimacy even if she wasn\u2019t the empress.The empress died without leaving the palace. None of the assassins who waited for the Empress to come out alive, got blood on their knife.It wasn\u2019t until then that Artizea thought that the Empress might have been really ill.\u2018Cedric will not forgive.\u2019Unlike killing a butler, she can\u2019t hide and do such a big thing.Artizea gazed gently at Cedric\u2019s face.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Probably the last time His Majesty the Emperor met her too. I thought it was true that she was ill.\u201d\u201cSince she is living such a life, she cannot possibly be healthy.\u201d\u201cYes, I don\u2019t have anything to say because I don\u2019t see her often.\u201d\u201cYou weren\u2019t in a position to do that. It\u2019s not just a relative. For Her Majesty the Empress, Cedric is someone under their command. You had to think about safety.\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s true.\u201dCedric sighed with a light chuckle.\u201cI\u2019ve only seen her for a short time, so it wouldn\u2019t be helpful to tell you with the impressions of that time. When I was younger\u2026 when Pavel was alive, I sometimes went to play.\u201dPavel was the second son of the empress, who died 18 years ago.Cedric said, recalling his memory.\u201cHer Majesty was a cold person to Brother Pavel as well. As you know, I lost my mother early, so when I was a child, I had something like a fantasy about having a real mother, but I was surprised that Her Majesty was so cold.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d\u201cShe must not have had a heart to love.\u201d\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, she won\u2019t be in grief until now.\u201dArtizea let out a small sigh.\u201cIf Prince Pavel had been alive, he would have been the successor to the Riagan Duchy, right?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Since Her Majesty was the only descendant of the Duke, she wrote a contract with His Majesty before marriage. Of the children born between them, the youngest of the children is to belong to the Riagan Duchy. She did it to avoid joining the royal family.\u201d\u201cShe was a noble person. Ambitious, and it is not easy to marry into the imperial family.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dCedric replied, then bite his lips for a moment.When Artizea fell quiet at her thoughts, the inside of the carriage became quiet too.She thought about the situation when the empress was drawing up the contract.She probably chose to marry because at the time it was a conventional way to supplement his legitimacy while supporting Emperor Gregor.However, she had no intention of joining the Riagan Duchy to the imperial family.If so, the pride of the Riagan Duchy is still the biggest weight in the empress\u2019s heart.\u201cThe salt crystals Lord Freil brought might play a more important role than I think.\u201d\u201c\u2026 are you and Freil close?\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201dAt Cedric\u2019s unexpected question, Artizea tilted her head.Cedric stroked his mouth once. It was to hide his agitation.\u201cNo, it\u2019s nothing. Just because you look friendly \u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re not close.\u201dArtizea replied immediately.He showed his true color and trusted his ability. She could easily entrust the work without hiding it.But saying that she was friendly with him was completely separate.Cedric\u2019s face turned a little red. He lowered his eyes.\u201cYes, no, nothing. I asked you a strange question. Freil is a quick witted and reliable person.\u201d\u201cYes, I think so.\u201dArtizea tilted her head.***The carriage passed through a small wooded garden and stopped in front of the main gate of the Empress\u2019s Palace.Cedric got off the carriage first and helped Artizea.The Lady-in-waiting, Countess Martha, bowed politely.\u201cWelcome, Grand Duke Evron, Lady Heiress of Rosan.\u201d\u201cNice to meet you, Countess Martha.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve become more good looking since the last time I\u2019ve seen you.\u201dCount Martha said with a smile towards Cedric.And she politely bowed her head to Artizea.\u201cEven in the midst of Her Majesty\u2019s sickness, she waited very much for the day to meet the Lady Heiress.\u201d\u201cIt is an honor.\u201dArtizea glanced at Alice, who followed her.As Alice had been instructed in advance, she quickly lowered the jewelry box and she presented it to the Countess Martha.\u201cI had my maid bring something for Her Majesty the Empress. If it\u2019s okay, can you do me a favor?\u201d\u201cOkay. Then, I\u2019ll take care of it.\u201dCountess Martha accepted her box.\u201cCome in. She is waiting in the audience room.\u201dCedric reached out his arm. Artizea was escorted by him and headed inside.The ceiling was so high that the footsteps echoed.The floor was marble, and the pillars were decorated with gold studded embellishments.Even though it was bright because the curtains were open, it felt somehow dark. Perhaps this is because there was no signs of people.Upon arriving at the audience room, Countess Martha politely announced.\u201cGrand Duke Evron and Lady Heiress of Rosan have arrived.\u201dThe creaking door opened.The empress was sitting with her two maids.Today, she was also dressed in mourning. The jewel on the neck was a black jet with no luster.This is a tomb that the empress made herself.It was a realistic figure.Cedric released Artizea\u2019s arm. And he first knelt in front of her empress.\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time. I\u2019m sorry for not visiting you often.\u201d\u201cI know you\u2019re not in a very comfortable situation, and you can\u2019t even stay in the capital for a long time, so why should you feel sorry for not being able to greet often? I\u2019m grateful that you came without forgetting about me.\u201d\u201cNo, absolutely not.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re Rosan\u2019s Lady Heiress, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cYes, this is my fiancee.\u201dCedric stood up and introduced.Artizea slowly approached and knelt in front of the empress. Then she kissed the hem of the black mourning gown.\u201cRosan\u2019s Artizea greets the Moon of the Empire.\u201d\u201cRaise your head.\u201dArtizea raised her head. The empress looked down at her.\u201cYou look like Marquis Michael.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m overwhelmed with awe.\u201dArtizea lowered her eyes.\u201cI am also overwhelmed for this chance to meet you.\u201d\u201cAlthough I\u2019m sick and quietly recuperating in the palace, wouldn\u2019t I even meet Cedric\u2019s fianc\u00e9e? Still, I\u2019ve been hearing news from the outside.\u201d\u201cI should have visited and said hello, but I didn\u2019t dare to see you until you call me.\u201d\u201cA lot of things happened. Relocating a residence is no ordinary thing. Especially since it\u2019s a big deal to get a family home. Cedric may be very helpful, but what about the Lady Heiress of Rosan\u2019s family?\u201dThe empress said slowly. She seemed unwilling to hide that she was listening to all the social news with her ears open.Artizea said politely.\u201cThankfully, His Majesty the Emperor has allowed my fianc\u00e9e to be my guardian before marriage, and the old employees in the family have also returned. We are taking care of it well.\u201d\u201cGood thing.\u201d\u201cI am relieved as if all my worries were washed away, and Your Majesty\u2019s has also allowed me to see you. I have something I brought to the Empress as a sign of gratitude.\u201dCountess Martha took the jewelry box brought by Artizea to the Empress.The empress opened the lid of the box. A large diamond shone brightly in the morning sunlight.\u201cThe last time I saw it was a very long time ago, so I thought it would be different from my memory\u2026 Even if it was made like this, it\u2019s still beautiful.\u201dThe empress could not hide her trembling voice for a moment.But soon the trembling subsided beneath the expressionless dignity.\u201cBut I heard that Cedric gave it to the Lady Heiress as a proposal gift.\u201dInstead of answering, Cedric looked at Artizea. Artizea bowed her head and said softly.\u201cAfter knowing the history of this gem, how can I just think of it as a diamond and hang it on my neck?\u201d\u201cDoes the Lady say so, knowing that the owner of this jewel has committed suicide for betraying the imperial family?\u201dCedric flinched at the empress\u2019s sharp question as if trying to intervene. But Artizea didn\u2019t even move, so he endured.\u201cIt\u2019s okay if you consider a jewel only as a jewel. Such a great diamond is enough to use it as a wedding gift for the Marchioness of Rosan or as a treasure for the Grand Duke.\u201dThe empress questioned stronger.\u201cBut you dedicate it to me while telling of its history, it\u2019s a disgrace to me. Did you think that I should keep a sinner\u2019s past, so the sinner is bound to me?\u201d\u201cHow can a will that has already been created disappear?\u201dArtizea said in a calm manner.\u201cThe history attached to the object does not disappear. Would the lady who had this jewel really regarded it as a precious diamond? Was the jewel when in the hands of others, not the Empress, to be forgotten by the people?\u201d\u201cLady Heiress. You dare.\u201d\u201cThe Pescher\u2019s heirloom is by no means just a jewel.\u201dArtizea said so. Because that would be what the Empress wanted.The Empress needs someone to share her sufferings with herself. It will only be with someone she trusts enough to risk her life for herself.If such a person does not appear, she will not be able to open the door of the Imperial Palace.But Artizea couldn\u2019t give her that trust. The empress is not one to be cajoled by words in a short time.Instead, she decided to grasp her weaknesses.The Viscount and Viscountess of Pescher took responsibility for the death of the princes and committed suicide. And it was the emperor, not the empress, who demanded responsibility.In other words, it was to deny what the emperor had done and praise the Peschers.It was also something she could do because she was convinced that the empress would not use that weakness.The empress, in her mourning dress, couldn\u2019t mention the sins of Viscountess Pescher again out of her mouth.Artizea said, holding her blue eyes straight.\u201cI know they took their life because of the suffering that they did not fully repay Her Majesty\u2019s trust.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cThe Peschers were not executed as a traitor, but there were no descendants left.\u201dThe silence sank down breathtakingly. The Empress tapped the armrest several times and said.\u201cPeople who risk themselves will want that much reward. What is the reward for the Lady Heiress?\u201d\u201cI only want to be closer to Her Majesty.\u201dArtizea said with her head down.\u201cPlease use me as with Viscountess Pescher.\u201d\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The one I got from Sir Freil.\u201d\u201cTia.\u201dCedric made a voice that seemed to try to appease Artizea. Artizea said again.\u201cIt\u2019s something that can\u2019t be left in the hands of others. Even if it\u2019s called the Empress\u2019s Palace, there will be the eyes and ears of His Majesty the Emperor somewhere.\u201dArtizea was right. Cedric stood up. Then he gave a little greeting to the empress and went out of the audience room.Artizea stood up and knelt again before the empress.The empress asked, languishingly leaning on her back.\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re suspicious of my palace.\u201d\u201cYour Majesty is well aware that this is true.\u201dA suspicious person like the emperor must have planted people in close proximity like the palace. The empress did not find any fault in her.\u201cSo, you will be my lady-in-waiting?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cIt seems that there was no discussion between you two.\u201dThe empress said so.\u201cIt\u2019s my decision.\u201dArtizea\u2019s face had no color. So, both eyes with strong will were deeper and a new blue light was shining.However, she couldn\u2019t fully understand the inside of it.\u201cIs your mother so shameful?\u201dThe empress asked to shake Artizea.The more noble she is, the less likely she will be a lady-in-waiting.It was usually an unmarried sister or cousin who became the lady-in-waiting. If not, a niece or a guardian that\u2019s educated to be a lady-in-waiting.Someone you can trust among the vassals. These ladies aren\u2019t just women who take care of miscellaneous things and become companions. It is a henchman.However, Artizea met the Empress for the first time today. It is not that the Marquisate of Rosan has had a relationship with the Riagan Duchy in the past.As such, it is inappropriate to speak of loyalty or pledge.Even if she is the Marchioness of Rosan, what would she benefit from being the Queen\u2019s lady-in-waiting as the Grand Duchess Evron?She didn\u2019t know again when she was fighting for power in the middle of the imperial palace, but she had no reason to be beside the empress, who had been living in seclusion like now.\u201cIf you follow me, it doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019ll be my lady-in-waiting. Did you dare compare yourself with the Peschers and use me because you want to make your mother angry?\u201dArtizea lowered her eyes down and said.\u201cThe relationship with my mother is already broken. I don\u2019t want to bring shame to the Grand Duchy of Evron. It\u2019s better to be the Lady-in-waiting as Grand Duchess of Evron rather than Milaira\u2019s daughter.\u201d\u201cDo you think I\u2019ll listen to that? Even when in public in an official position with Gregor?\u201dThe empress said, with a quiver.If it\u2019s her husband\u2019s nephew\u2019s wedding, she doesn\u2019t have to go out, but if it\u2019s her lady-in-waiting\u2019s wedding, she\u2019s compelled to attend.That means she has to be in the same position as the emperor. And she couldn\u2019t pretend to not know each other while being in the same place as the emperor.\u201cYour Majesty will accept my will, because she wants revenge.\u201d\u201cHow would it be revenge for me to harass your mother?\u201dThe empress said coldly.\u201cYes, I hate Miraila. No one likes the mistress with or without love for her husband.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cWhen my child died, Gregor hugged that bitch and her son and said that it was all for her. He gave what my child should have inherited to her son, killed my own family, tore up the family fortune and distributed it to those who flattered her.\u201dThe empress sharply gnashed her teeth.\u201cNevertheless\u2026, how could Miraila be the object of my revenge? For Gregor, to love his mistress is nothing but entertainment. Isn\u2019t it really something he does for that bitch to beat someone who doesn\u2019t kneel in front of her as an excuse?\u201dThe Empress\u2019s anger echoed in her reception room.\u201cIt is to split the power of the nobles in half by separating the flatterers and those who don\u2019t, and to overthrow the servants by purging those who speak offensive things in advance!\u201d\u201cThen, you are going to let His Majesty Emperor have his will for the descendants?\u201dDespite being the daughter of that Mililla, Artizea was not at all withdrawn or afraid.\u201cThe Emperor is a greedy person. Power is not shared with his children. The Emperor will hold that power until the moment he stops breathing, and then he will pass it on to a child he loves enough to be considered his alter ego. Lawrence is most likely right now.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cBut everything that he will inherit should have been brought to life by the Empress. Do you want His Majesty to do all of it at will? He was not alone in his own power to ascend the Emperor. How much stake does Her Majesty have on the throne?\u201dThe empress was silent for a while. Then in a split voice she said.\u201cYou\u2019re excellent at stabbing people and encouraging anger.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m overwhelmed with awe.\u201dArtizea bowed her head deeply.Anger and desire move people easily. Fear and restraint are far more useful means of manipulating a person.Even though the Empress noticed it, she said again.\u201cGregor\u2019s throne clearly contains my share. Do you want that? Is it the empress\u2019s seat that you want?\u201d\u201cWhat I want is to have the power to regain my rights and to have the power to not be so obsequious with others again.\u201dThe Empress would not believe that justice or the right path, or that she decided to follow it. It would be easier to understand if she says it was for ambition or vengeance.If she didn\u2019t know Cedric and Licia, Artizea would have done it herself. So Artizea replied that way.\u201cBecause it will be the greatest revenge for those who despise me.\u201dThe empress shed a laugh afterwards.\u201cIt\u2019s of no use to me. If I follow your will, what will you pay me back?\u201d\u201cI will make His Majesty the most lonely and miserable person in the world.\u201dArtizea answered so without hesitation. The empress lost her words.Even the empress\u2019s maids did not dare to open their mouths.The sharp air filled the audience room.Artizea was neither anxious nor worried. She would not know if it was to make someone happy, but she was confident if it was to make someone miserable.Even if he dies lying on a bed decorated with gold, nothing will remain in the hands of the emperor.\u201cDo you know that your words can sound like treason?\u201d\u201cI can turn it around, but I know that\u2019s not what your Majesty wants to hear. I told you that I can do exactly what you want.\u201dThe empress changed her complexion.It was then.The door opened carefully and the attendant said politely.\u201cThe Grand Duke Evron is back.\u201dCedric returned with a box.He noticed the tension in the audience room, but instead of letting go of the embarrassment, he came inside, pushing the air out in a calm and stable manner.Cedric\u2019s presence softened the atmosphere of the audience room with heavy pressure.He put the box down on the table.Cedric knew that while he had been away there was a serious and heavy conversation.But he didn\u2019t dare to ask on the spot or act without notice.Instead, he raised Artizea to support her and asked in a gentle voice.\u201cWhy are you on your knees?\u201dThat alone loosened the tension.The empress looked at the box and asked.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cThis is a gift that Tia has been preparing to give Her Majesty. Saintess Olga\u2019s heart cannot be a gift because it was what Her Majesty deserves.\u201dCountess Martha approached.Cedric reached out and stopped the Countess from opening the box.\u201cI don\u2019t think you should open it now.\u201dArtizea smiled as it seemed that Cedric looked through her and said it.She said, as the empress sighs at Cedric.\u201cHow did you find a wife like this?\u201dCedric had an embarrassed face. He didn\u2019t know what kind of conversation went, but he had guessed what the empress wanted to say.\u201cI think she\u2019s great.\u201d\u201cI heard rumors say you were in love.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dAs the empress sighed, she exhaled a long sigh.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean that she thinks immaturely because she\u2019s young, but\u2026.\u201dNevertheless, there was a stir in his chest.There was no reason to trust. The only thing Artizea now has is the Marquisate of Rosan\u2019s wealth and Cedric.However, despite the fact that Artizea knew nothing, she succeeded in regaining the Marquisate of Rosan back.Her ability to deal with people was excellent and her goals were clear.There are rumors that she fell in love with Cedric, but the empress thought it would be a lie.The size of her ambition and the confident young attitude that Artizea revealed reminded the empress of her own youth.However, she contained in it her coldness and objectivity that the empress of her girlhood did not have.She doesn\u2019t believe that Artizea can persuade others with the greatness of her own ambitions and purposes; it\u2019s rare for people her age to do so.It wasn\u2019t something that she came up with like saying that she would pay in return. She is precisely aiming at the empress.Such a woman is not caught up in emotions and she does not go wrong.The Empress spoke to Artizea in a relaxed voice.\u201cMost people are committed to blood ties and families, but some people choose their own partner to be loyal to.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m overwhelmed with awe.\u201dArtizea bowed her head. The empress seemed to have seen through her and who she was willing to work for, beyond her ambitions and hatred.The empress said slowly.\u201cI know such a person, so I\u2019m not going to deny the Lady Heiress\u2019 desire.\u201dAnd the empress beckoned.\u201cMartha, I want you to bring it from my bedroom.\u201d\u201cYour Majesty\u2026.\u201dShe knew what the empress was saying, and Countess Martha asked back in surprised.\u201cIf I received a gift from the Lady Heiress, wouldn\u2019t it be customary for me to give a bigger gift than that. She\u2019s getting married, so I can\u2019t be neglectful anymore.\u201d\u201cYes. \u201cCountess Martha politely replied, and she withdrew.The Empress looked at Artizea with her tired face.All of her dignity that she had worn so far seemed to be worn out, exposing her original face.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

But it wasn\u2019t long before he went bankrupt.The curse of a couple who died unjustly was put on the jewel. Then, the price of diamonds soared even further.However, as far as Artizea knows, Saintess Olga\u2019s heart has never appeared again.Anecdotes about history and miracles were attached to the statue.Saintess Olga is a real person from 200 years ago. As she traveled throughout the empire, she performed sacraments.After Olga died, her lover sculpted the statue of her himself.It is said to have shed tears on the day the sculptor died.The tears of the Saintess had the power of healing. It is said that the pilgrims who fell asleep in front of the statue were all younger, and all the sick were healed in several nearby villages.Saintess Olga\u2019s statue worked a miracle of healing in the years that followed.But as the years passed, it cracked around the chest.The large diamond was obtained by the Viscount which was said to have been cured by the sacred miracle and was put into the empty chest.It is such a treasure.If it had ever been circulated on the black market, a word would have come out as the Saintess Olga\u2019s heart shook the social world.However, there has never been a single line of rumors about the Saintess.So, she vaguely thought it had broken as the Peschers were ruined.\u2018Is she kept by the empress?\u2019Perhaps she disappeared when the palace of the empress was on fire.Soon, Countess Martha pushed a handcart. The cart had a cloth-covered statue the size of a child.When the fabric was taken off, a bluish stone figure emerged.It could not be said that it was beautiful. It was not a work of an artist who had craved it in marble. This is because an ordinary man engraved the image of his lover on stone.There were two long streaks of stains like tear marks on its face.The empress handed over Saintess Olga\u2019s heart to her attendant.The attendant took the diamond from the necklace and put it on the statue.The empress said.\u201cLady Heiress of Rosan and future Grand Duchess of Evron, I will give you this statue as a wedding gift. Since I received Saintess Olga\u2019s heart, it is only right to gift you the completed Saintess.\u201dArtizea bowed her head deeply to express gratitude.The empress staggered and stood up from her place.\u201cI\u2019m tired. You two go back now. Congratulations. You\u2019ll be busy with preparations, so it\u2019s okay, you don\u2019t have to come again.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a shame we took so much of your time. Rosan will withdraw.\u201dArtizea bowed to her.The empress first left her audience room. Countess Martha approached and said.\u201cI will send what the Empress has given to the Evron Grand Duchy. Is that okay?\u201d\u201cYes, thank you, Countess Martha.\u201d\u201cThen goodbye. Congratulations on your wedding.\u201dArtizea greeted her.Then she crossed arms with Cedric and stepped out.Cedric asked in a low voice.\u201cAre you okay, Tia? You look tired.\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019m a little tired, because I paid a lot of attention.\u201d\u201cDid everything you want come true?\u201dArtizea pondered. She then concluded.\u201cYes. I received all the answers I came for.\u201dThe empress did not give an immediate positive answer. But it would be foolish to answer right away for something so important.Artizea was not worried.The empress\u2019s heart was definitely inclined. Otherwise, she wouldn\u2019t have given the completed statue of Saintess Olga.Her dead friend\u2019s heirloom, in its imperfect condition, have until now been kept unknowingly in her own bedroom.What did the empress think as she saw the loss of it\u2019s heart every day before going to sleep? What else did she think about? Cedric sighed.\u201cBy the way, you\u2019re taking on a tremendous responsibility. Restoring the Peschers. We can cancel it now.\u201d\u201cYou noticed it.\u201d\u201cIf the offspring of the Peschers was alive, she wouldn\u2019t have concealed the saint. I now understand why until now she closed the door of the Empress Palace and stayed quiet.\u201dThe Empress still had something to protect.\u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201d\u201cIs it a matter that I can decide?\u201dArtizea asked. Cedric asked back.\u201cThis is what you started.Of course you have to decide, right?\u201d\u201cHow about you, Cedric? I can tell you which one is advantageous and which one is profitable, but in the end, it will be the Grand Duchy of Evron that will restore the Peschers.\u201dCedric thought for a moment.But the answer was decided from the beginning.\u201cI don\u2019t want to turn away from the Pescher Viscounty. That\u2019s not a good idea. I was originally thinking of looking for a descendant.\u201dCedric sighed.He told Ansgar to look it up, but in the end he hasn\u2019t been actively investigating.He felt a sense of debt.That said, he couldn\u2019t ignore the risk. Anyway, the top priority he had to keep was Grand Duke Evron.\u201cLet\u2019s do it if you think it\u2019s better to postpone it after considering the priorities.\u201d\u201cThe problem of the Perscher Viscounty is only a small thing. Cedric is carrying a bunch of dangerous people anyway.\u201dArtizea thought and talked about the village of the rebels of the Evron Grand Duchy.He understood what she meant, and Cedric had an embarrassed face.Artizea smiled.\u201cUndoubtedly, I\u2019m sure the Emperor already knows about the Pescher artist, so don\u2019t worry too much. You can\u2019t get something done right now as much as protecting it. Taking up work from 18 years ago puts a political burden on Your Grace as well. It\u2019s even more so now that Lawrence is in line for the successor.\u201dOn the surface, she seemingly has to do what the Empress asked for by taking charge of the statue. However in reality, it is on the empress\u2019s side that, if the exchange went down, the Empress would be anxious.The Empress had not done anything for 18 years and she had grown old. She must have also felt anxious that there was no one to take over.She has not found the character and power that deserves to be the guardian of the blood and flesh of her precious friend.So it was a rather hostage situation, for the empress had no choice.Artizea smiled.\u201cAren\u2019t you supposed to ask me about something else?\u201d\u201cYou mean the salt?\u201dCedric said in a slightly troubled tone.\u201cIt is true that the burden is high, but didn\u2019t you think it was necessary?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s all right. I know that in order to bring in the southern provinces, we need to get the Riagan Duchy. The import of salt from the Riagan Duchy is also heavily involved in the finances.\u201dCedric sighed.\u201cBut I can\u2019t imagine that such a day will come \u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201dArtizea said.How can I make you an emperor if I can\u2019t do that much?Artizea smiled and looked up at Cedric.\u201cLet\u2019s go back.\u201dCedric nodded his head. And he walked alongside her and left the empress\u2019s palace.***\u201cMartha, open the box.\u201dThe empress dressed comfortably and sat up on her bed.Countess Martha opened the box she had brought from the audience room.When she opened the lid, the four sides of the wall of the box opened as if falling off.And in it, crystals of salt, like blue gemstones, came out.\u201cYour Majesty\u2026.\u201dCountess Martha called the empress with her trembling voice. The empress did not say anything for a while.These jewel-like salt crystals come only from one beach owned by the Riagan Duchy.The coat of arms of the Duke of Riagan also embodies the salt crystal.The Duke of Riagan lost all descendants, except for the Empress.The Empress gave up her title at the time of her marriage, so after the death of her parents she could not regain her title.The current Duke of Riagan was the one that served the emperor. It was the emperor who gave him a seat there.Considering that the foundation of the Duke of Riagan was derived from the salt of the South Sea, the meaning of Artizea\u2019s offering of this salt crystal was clear.Artizea had told the Empress that she would bring back the Riagan Duchy.\u201cMartha.\u201dThe empress said in a cracked voice.\u201cIs this possible?\u201d\u201c\u2026 How dare I make such judgement?\u201dCountess Martha said with a biting voice.It is impossible to get the Riagan Duchy back. The only descendant is the Empress.And she had no children anymore. She had no close relatives.However, she had no intention of passing it on to one of her current kin. They are traitors who succumbed to the emperor and harmed the descendants, so they are all deserving of death.So, even if she drives out the current Duke of Riagan now, there is no way she can get back the future the Empress originally wanted.Still, Countess Martha couldn\u2019t say that.Knowing her suffering the Empress had been through for 18 years, she could not say that it was impossible.\u201cYes, it\u2019s impossible.\u201dThe empress said so, and she lay in bed.Countess Martha placed the salt crystal in the place where the Saintess had been. It was in a position where the empress could see it by just laying down on her side.\u201cMartha, I\u2019m\u2026..\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cI have never forgotten it.\u201d\u201cYes, Your Majesty\u2026\u201d\u201cI thought it was impossible to stand up because I\u2019ve grown old, and have no strength left in my hands and feet. But I still haven\u2019t forgotten.\u201dThe empress said so.The empress began to doze after she was exhausted from welcoming guests after a long time. And she soon fell asleep.Countess Martha carefully covered her with a blanket.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

No one was competent enough.The years have passed without any access to the authority of the Marquisate of Rosan.Some lined up for Milaira, but most were unsuccessful.After losing the Marquisate\u2019s glory, a significant number of them lost their family business and went bankrupt.After Rosan, some completely cut off relations with the Marquisate and planned a way to live. Some of them were quite financially successful.However, no one returned to the society where Milaira was.There were many people who expected something to change as Artizea became the Marchioness of Rosan after becoming independent from Milaira.[Even if she inherits the title, it is because of marriage. Isn\u2019t she a young girl who is only 18 years old? You\u2019ll need a guardian.][To capture the heart of the Grand Duke Evron, as expected, the blood cannot be deceived\u2026.. No, I\u2019m saying that because I think it\u2019s great.][I heard that she fought and split with Milaira, but if so, wouldn\u2019t she need a relative to take care of her from now on? And even more so if she wants to do well as Grand Duchess Evron.]Such whispers spread among the relatives who gathered in the capital after a long time.Some of them tried to contact Artizea first.Until now, Artizea has ignored them all. Because she already knew that none of them could be useful.However, she thought she had to make sure at least once in order for them to be quiet in the future as well as in the weddings.So she invited them to the capital and to the wedding. And gathered them in one place.Artizea appeared with Marcus and sat down at the head of the table.She spoke straightforwardly without even saying hello.\u201cWhoever objects my inheritance rights to the Marquisate of Rosan, tell me now.\u201dNot one or two were dissatisfied with Artizea\u2019s arrogant attitude.[The little girl.][She was only acknowledged as Michael\u2019s daughter because the previous Marquis wanted to prevent the scandal, but isn\u2019t she actually an illegitimate child whose father is unknown?]However, none of them could argue.No one knew who Artizea\u2019s biological father was.But there was no doubt that she was one of Michael\u2019s children.Artizea\u2019s face, and how the previous Marquis\u2019s attitude to hurry up and deal with the scandal proves it.And by the emperor\u2019s recognition, the right of inheritance became firm.Now, the powerless side could not dare to take on the inheritance right.Artizea looked over the crowd.They were those who could only give in in the past and in the future.\u201cThe Marquisate of Rosan will not merge with the Grand Duke of Evron. I will be married as an individual, not as a family to family.\u201dThat was what she promised in case of her divorce.\u201cAlso, I don\u2019t plan to use incompetent individuals just because they\u2019re close to blood. So, like I said, there\u2019s no difference.\u201dArtizea said expressionlessly.\u201cI know that the descendant line has been too indifferent so far. From now on, I will do my duty. I will give a pension to the house where it is difficult to live, and if only the elderly and children remain, I will take care of it.\u201dArtizea said again.\u201cMarcus will take care of everything as my representative, so contact him if you need anything.\u201d\u201cI would like to ask you one thing. What of the inheritance in case the Lady Heiress dies? Will all the children born become children of the Grand Duke Evron?\u201dA middle-aged man asked aloud.It was rude. And it was also a fearless act.It was a far cry to bring up the issue of inheritance to a family head who was only 18 years old.Besides, it was the same thing to tell a little girl about her future child.But Artizea did not shake or blush.\u201cThe firstborn will be the successor to the Grand Duchy of Evron, and the second child will be the successor to the Marquisate of Rosan.\u201dIt was so on the prenuptial contract.Of course, there was no chance of having a child. Artizea said dryly as if to recite the contract.The man who considered Artizea to be a little girl and tried to humiliate her, rather flushed at her calm response. Marcus glared at him.\u201cThen I think I\u2019ve told you everything. You can comfortably stay until the wedding and then go. I\u2019m busy, so I don\u2019t think I have time to greet everyone one by one.\u201dArtizea stood up from her seat.Even though Artizea said she had no time to greet them, several hurriedly followed her.\u201cLady Heiress, Lady Heiress, ah.\u201dMarcus, blocked those trying to follow Artizea, standing in front of her.\u201cGo away. I need to talk with the Lady Heiress.The butler who abandoned the master and ran away\u2026..\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what I have to say.\u201dMarcus said coldly.\u201cI haven\u2019t forgotten yet. What did the people here say when I said I\u2019ll accuse the poisoner?\u201dHe said with a big glance.\u201cIf you bow down at that time, do so till the end. Unlike before, this time there will be no flaws. The person you\u2019ll be bowing down this time is not the master\u2019s poisoner, but the rightful master.\u201dNo one was willing.This is because there were none left, but even if there were those who were left, they would not have forgotten the past and came here looking to see if there was anything to benefit from.Therefore, Marcus, like an old dog, showed his teeth to them without hesitation.***The wedding took place in one of the residences owned by Marquisate of Rosan in the capital, not in the Great Duchy of Evron.The main reason was that until then, the cleanup was not finished.The animals were still grazing in the middle of a ranch and the garden, and the cluttered troops came in and out. Internal repairs were not finished.It would have been better to use an empty mansion rather than creating a hall for the ceremony.This mansion of the Marquisate of Rosan was not usually a house to live in, but it was used at least once in a season for entertainment.It was better than the Evron mansion, which had only accumulated long years without ever changing the interior.Of course, Artizea wouldn\u2019t have brought a large number of people into the mansion, even if the Grand Duke\u2019s mansion was beautiful.The interior wasn\u2019t the problem, but the interior repair wasn\u2019t finished.It was no different to advertise that they were making secret passages, safe houses, and other new fixtures by inviting people now.It was the end of summer.To stop the sound of cicadas, boys hired separately ran around the garden carrying buckets of water. They couldn\u2019t get rid of them all, so at least they can try to get rid of the sound by dampening its wings.The door of the whole mansion was open to greet guests.Candles were placed all over the place for the evening reception, and a golden glass of liquor was distributed to all guests.The archbishop, who was especially invited, also shared his virtues.The only door closed was the bride\u2019s Tuvalet room.The inside was true to its splendor. Emily decorated it with white lace and light pink silk.Thanks to the pink roses decorated in various places, it was full of good scent.\u201cOh my God. That\u2019s really nice.\u201dAs Countess Eunice came in, she made a fuss.\u201cI guess His Grace really cares about the Lady Heiress. Oh no, now you\u2019re the Grand Duchess.\u201d\u201cNot yet.\u201d\u201cIf you marry, you will inherit the title immediately. I\u2019m telling you, weddings should be like this.\u201d\u201cI heard that Countess Eunice\u2019s wedding was also gorgeous and spectacular.\u201d\u201cIt was because of my father.\u201dArtizea shook her head lightly.She thought these roses were a waste. There was no reason to cherish it, but there was no reason to decorate as well.The bride\u2019s Tuvalet room is a place that is only open to her close friends.However, Artizea didn\u2019t have any relatives or friends to invite.She was expecting a visit from only one or two guests with political purposes.So, maybe the people below prepared the decorations to fit the illusion of a love marriage. Especially Sophie.Artizea couldn\u2019t even imagine that Cedric had picked and sent flowers himself.Countess Eunice asked.\u201cYou said you\u2019re going on a honeymoon to the north?\u201d\u201cYes. Cedric has to man the Grand Duchy in the winter. It takes too much time to go to other regions and then return to the north.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s still a honeymoon\u2026. It\u2019s too bad to spend in the desolate North. Grand Duke Evron is too much. A honeymoon doesn\u2019t come twice.\u201d\u201cCedric hasn\u2019t been back to the land for three years. We can go somewhere else anytime we want.\u201dArtizea smiled with a visible smile.\u201cWell, with a wonderful husband, is the North a great place? Even buried in the snow, it would be hot.\u201dCountess Eunice smiled.Artizea did not understand what she was trying to say. So she pretended not to know.\u201cI like to travel in spring and summer. There will be opportunities at some point.\u201dNow is the best time to greet the vassals of the Grand Duke. They should also look at the situation in the north.Artizea only knew the Grand Duchy in writing. Its desolate land and tombs were all that she saw in her eyes of Grand Duchy Evron.That wasn\u2019t enough for her.This is a place that Cedric values.To protect it properly, it was necessary to feel it with her body and confirm it with her eyes.\u201cWell the Lady Heiress is not an ordinary person. There must be something more important than enjoying your honeymoon.\u201dSaid Countess Eunice wriggling.Knock, knock.Someone knocked on the door.Countess Eunice laughed loudly.\u201cHas the impatient groom come already?\u201dBefore opening the door, she heard a call outside.\u201cHer Majesty the Empress has arrived.\u201dCountess Eunice was frightened and stood up.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Because she thought she wanted to scream.Artizea was not surprised. Because she knew she would come.Sophie and Emily reached out to help Artizea stand up.The door opened.Thud.In fact, it is almost impossible to hear footsteps.But Countess Eunice felt the illusion of hearing such a sound. The Empress\u2019 presence was too great.It has been 18 years since the Empress came out of the palace.Countess Eunice knew the Empress. In her childhood, it was also the Empress who was the most feared person in the Imperial Palace.So she could recognize her right away.The Empress was old, but she was still cold and dignified.The Empress was wearing a black dress again today.Since the interior was filled with ornaments for the bride all over, so her mourning black dress was even more noticeable.\u201cThank you for coming, Your Majesty.\u201dArtizea, supported by Sophie, kneeled politely. The hem of the new white dress was wrinkled.The Empress snorted.\u201cYou must have already known that I was coming.\u201d\u201cI was just thinking that if that happens, it will be a lifetime of glory.\u201d\u201cDoes it make sense that you know how to shake a person\u2019s heart so well and not know the consequences?\u201dThe Empress said so and reached out her hand. Artizea stood up, taking her hand carefully.The Empress looked around her and she said.\u201cMartha, this outfit is inappropriate for entering the wedding hall. Bring me some flowers.\u201dNot taking off her mourning clothes meant that she did not yet believe everything Artizea said.However, she did not intend to do the sinister work of holding the bride\u2019s hand in mourning clothes.Emily hurried up and picked the larger of the rose flowers that adorned the Tuvalet room and decorated it on the Empress\u2019s chest and hat.That alone brightened up the atmosphere.The Empress pulled Artizea\u2019s veil.Then she put a pure gold orb in the largest rose blossom in the center of her bouquet.Soon an errand boy came up from the wedding hall. It was to announce the beginning of the ceremony.***Cedric\u2019s preparations ended much faster than Artizea.It was just about wearing a dark blue robe and wearing an insignia.The servants who helped him in his outfit wanted all his medals to be attached.However, he omitted most, because Cedric thought that the gold strings and epaulettes on his clothes were too much and just decorative.He did not have much preparation, but he had a lot of obligations. As the head of the Evron Grand Duchy, he had to welcome his guests.Artizea was also the head of the Marquisate of Rosan, but since she was the bride, she was exempt from almost all duties.However, she did not waive her duty just because she is the bride on the day of the wedding.Most of the actual guests were Cedric\u2019s.The only guests of Artizea were the relatives of the Marquisate of Rosan. There was no personal guest due to the narrow social relationships. On the other hand, there were endless people looking for Cedric.Congratulations flooded from the military\u2019s influential men, his men, his adoring knights, and his parents\u2019 old friends.\u201cThere are not one or two people who send separate letters from the western fortress asking what\u2019s going on. I highly doubt it, but turns out you\u2019re not matchmade but got married by dating.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not just the West. The Grand Duchy is no joke. Everyone almost wanted to duel till everyone died to attend this wedding. I won, with the fastest and strongest horses.\u201dCedric sighed between the noisy knights.\u201cDidn\u2019t I say that I would go there after the wedding anyway.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re really wrong, Your Grace. What do you mean taking the Grand Duchess to the Grand Duchy for your honeymoon? You\u2019re going to get some kind of resentment later on from the Grand Duchess.\u201dThere were exclamations of agreement here and there.Cedric had nothing to say.In fact, he did ask if she would like to go somewhere else.Since she had been so busy so far he thought it would be okay to take a break at the resort for a month or two.However, Artizea shook her head.\u201cThere is no time.\u201d\u201cIf there is a lot of work to do, why don\u2019t you remain in the capital?\u201d\u201cDo you not want to take me as the Grand Duchess?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like that, but the north is cold. There is nothing to see because it is so desolate.\u201dAt that time, Cedric couldn\u2019t understand the strange and subtle expressions Artizea made.She looked at Cedric silently for a moment, and smiled sadly.\u201cI have someone I need to meet in the North.\u201dArtizea probably knew no one in the Evron Grand Duchy. She has never left the capital on her own.\u201cWho is that?\u201dCedric asked, but Artizea was stubbornly silentAs it came to his mind, his heart became a little heavy.He knew that Artizea wasn\u2019t telling him everything she did.Some of the things she shouldn\u2019t tell him about and some she doesn\u2019t want him to know.However he was so concerned about who was the \u2018someone I need to meet\u2019 that made her look like that.\u201cNo. I\u2019ve been thinking, isn\u2019t the Grand Duke actually doing this with a terrifying trick?\u201dAt the words of Chancellor Lin, Cedric was dumbfounded and asked.\u201cA trick?\u201d\u201cWhile you are in a relationship, when do you go to a ball or go to a social gathering, or go on a picnic. No matter how much you think about this, it is clear that His Grace hides the bride and does not want to show it to others. Such a man, Your Grace.\u201d\u201cWhat nonsense.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. No matter how good it is, you shouldn\u2019t leave her at home.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that because you\u2019ve been in the same house before marriage, so you don\u2019t have to do anything like date?\u201dThere were also people who were unaware of who they were trying to make fun of.\u201cSo what happened to Ansgar?\u201dAsked Lin, looking around.\u201cI thought he would definitely be the most disheartened person. Isn\u2019t he the one person that raised the Grand Duke?\u201d\u201cEven if he wasn\u2019t, he was so happy that he started to cry last night, and now his eyes are swollen, so he can\u2019t come in front of the guests.\u201dFreil replied.\u201cI thought the old man was going to go, and he went crazy upset in the morning.\u201d\u201cWhat can he do without even attending the wedding ceremony.\u201dWhile they were talking about that, a cry was heard from outside.\u201cThe Pillar of Crete, His Majesty Emperor Gregor Afanas Nestor, who became the Sun on the Earth, who received the royal scepter and orb from the gods.\u201dThe friendly atmosphere quickly disappeared.Cedric strengthened his mind and tightened his body.He never hesitated to rush into the enemy camp, with his horse and a spear alone.However, it was scary to face the Rmperor.Cedric knew very well that he was awkward with social fights and power struggles.So he should be a shield or something.Artizea pretended to be a spear for him. Then he himself had to be an impenetrable shield to protect her.Cedric took a few deep breaths and stepped outside.\u201cOh, Cedric. Seeing you dressed up like that, I feel like you\u2019re getting married.\u201dThe Emperor caught him and hugged him before Cedric could even bow his knees and greet. His casual smile seemed to be truly happy.\u201cI\u2019m overwhelmed with awe.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve only traveled to the border, and you didn\u2019t even have a sign of having a woman, let alone have a family. It\u2019s something that the world has set together.\u201d\u201cBecause he\u2019s old.\u201dRoygar, who followed the Emperor, said with a smile.\u201cIt\u2019s surprisingly not so common to meet the right mate at the right age, but it\u2019s really a strange couple that I\u2019ve never thought about.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m overwhelmed with awe.\u201dCedric politely bowed his head.\u201cTia is smart but timid, she needs protection, and you are a person who can take a step back and protect.\u201dSaid the Emperor.\u201cI used to think that you would like a woman who is wise and who doesn\u2019t like to come out, and this is who you meet.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dCedric replied mechanically.The Emperor\u2019s words felt unfamiliar.Artizea is not that kind of person.Did Artizea hide herself so well in front of the Emperor?Or was his judgment blurred?The Emperor probably already knows that the Empress sent Artizea the Saintess Olga statue.If so, he might have doubted what kind of conversation that had come and gone with the Empress, what kind of deal was made.However, the Emperor did not show any signs of that.Cedric couldn\u2019t clearly tell if the judgment he said was what he really looked like, or if it was a warning to live quietly in the future.People surrounded Cedric and went out to the garden where the main ceremony was prepared.The weather was sunny and the temperature was just right.The garden was elegant and the decoration was gorgeous, frugality, which was unlike the wedding of the Grand Duchess of Evron, in other words, rustic.Round tables spread throughout were decorated with gold ornaments with their names engraved on them, which were given as gifts to those in attendance.Cedric took the Emperor and headed to the table where he would sit.To the right of the Emperor was the archbishop, and to the right of the archbishop was the seat for Lawrence.The left was empty. The seat was skipped and then the seat of Grand Duke Roygar.It seemed that Grand Duke Roygar had considered it strange.\u201cWhy did you leave a room?\u201d\u201cIs it weird, uncle?\u201d\u201cSo the Archbishop and I won\u2019t sit side by side.\u201dGrand Duke Roygar made up his own answer.Cedric didn\u2019t answer.The owner of the seat is the Empress.However, until this moment, it was unclear whether the Empress would really attend the wedding.So they didn\u2019t put a name tag on it.\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you choose to inherit the title of the Marquis? It would have been enough.\u201dHe was going to greet others, but Grand Duke Roygar followed and asked.\u201cIf you were to join the family, you\u2019ll probably be in a stable position. Once you hold the title, no one will want to touch it.\u201d\u201cOur families will not join. Tia is still young, and she has never had something of her own, so I intend to give everything back to her.\u201d\u201cWell, you\u2019re honorable, so you don\u2019t want to be told that you coveted the Marquisate of Rosan.\u201dCedric didn\u2019t dare refute.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Well, it seems that your bride is smarter than you are.\u201dGrand Duke Roygar laughed.\u201cYou know Marchioness Camellia? These days, all she talks about is all about your bride. If you come back from your honeymoon, you can come to my house together.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cEven if you are relatives, you can\u2019t go in and out of the imperial family.

Anyway, isn\u2019t that what families are for?\u201d\u201cYes, I understand.\u201dCedric replied heartlessly.Grand Duke Roygar and Cedric suffered similar hardships. The age difference was also small for uncle and nephew.However, they have never been close.They were also different in nature.Grand Duke Roygar established his own power by joining hands with aristocrats and subjects who could not hold the mainstream power in central politics.In the meantime, Cedric had to defend the North at an early age.After some stability, the emperor sent him to another battlefield.Since his life was different, there wasn\u2019t much to talk about even when they met occasionally. It was just a casual talk with him as a mandatory greeting.Now he\u2019s come and behaves like an irreplaceable family in the world.Even though Cedric knew the reason, he felt weird.\u201cCome to think of it \u2026\u2026.\u201dGrand Duke Roygar hesitated.He was wondering if Milaira was coming, but it seemed inappropriate to ask Cedric about it now.Grand Duke Roygar glanced at Lawrence.Lawrence was carrying the gold name tag with a calm face.A servant cautiously approached Lawrence and whispered. Then Lawrence stood up.Marchioness Camellia was also looking at the name tag in a subtle mood.\u2018There is no way that the Lady Heiress of Rosan accidentally made an empty seat.\u2019What is the intention?When the case of Baron Yetz first broke out, Marchioness Camellia thought that she could take Artizea, and she could go further to Cedric.It was because they were the nobles of the Lawrence faction that suffered the most in the case of Baron Yetz.However, since then, Artizea has not taken favor toward either Marchioness Camellia or Grand Duchess Roygar.However, the relationship with Milaira seemed to have been completely widened.Did the empty place on the name tag the place for Milaira?\u201cSister, how about if we also go see the bride?\u201dGrand Duchess Roygar covered her mouth with a fan, and asked Marchioness Camellia.Marchioness Camellia shook her head.\u201cI wasn\u2019t even invited.\u201d\u201cBut Charlotte\u2019s gone. She knows I\u2019m a relative.\u201d\u201cCountess Eunice and the Lady Heiress had an exchange from the beginning, but you haven\u2019t met the Lady Heiress of Rosan yet\u201dMarchioness Camellia gently soothed her.\u201cThe Lady Heiress of Rosan sure has it great. It doesn\u2019t mean that I have a complaint with my husband, but I wanted to live with a handsome man once.\u201d\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t carelessly say such a thing, Your Highness.\u201d\u201cHave you ever thought about it? How would it feel to kiss a guy like Cedric?\u201d\u201cYour Highness Grand Duchess.\u201d\u201cLawrence is also handsome. But I mean. I feel weird because he resembles Milaira too much. And I like to look more at the manly ones rather than the delicate looking.\u201dThe Grand Duchess said without hesitation.She was the youngest daughter of the prestigious Marquis Luden, from the East.The Marquis Luden had more than ten children, but most of them were illegitimate children. Except for the Grand Duchess, the only direct descendant, his eldest child.So, as the only descendant, she has been very cherished from the time she was born for her future political marriage.She was only 6 years old when she was engaged to Grand Duke Roygar, who was fifteen years older.It was the largest investment Marquis Luden had made in his life. In short, the Grand Duchess\u2019s expense was the contract investment.It goes without saying that the contract was successful for both sides.Grand Duke Roygar pampered his young wife with gold and silk and dotes on her like a treasure.She gave birth to three healthy children and strengthened his successionHer words with a cheerful look like an innocent girl, only worried the Marchioness Camellia.\u201cYour Highness, stop saying the words that are likely to be misunderstood. Grand Duke Evron is His Majesty the Emperor\u2019s niece.\u201dThe Grand Duchess cried out what she was angry about.It was then.At the entrance to the mansion, cheers and amazement was heard.From there, the shock spread like waves.Grand Duchess Roygar tilted her head.\u201cDid the bride come out?\u201dThe question was because there was someone who was too curious to welcome the bride.Cedric turned to Grand Duke Roygar in silence.Artizea took the empress\u2019s hand and passed through the rose arch.Like a daughter coming out to the wedding hall holding her mother\u2019s hand.As she came with the bride, it was not necessary to call out loudly to inform who had arrived.But who she was quickly spread.\u201cOh my God.\u201dMarchioness Camellia jumped up in surprise.Not just the Marchioness Camellia, but many others. The whole wedding hall buzzed like waves.\u201cThank you for coming.\u201dInstead of a long, formal greeting, Cedric said so sincerely. A bright smile hangs on his face.It is not because of the reassurance that Artizea\u2019s mind was right.Artizea said that even if the Empress doesn\u2019t come, she\u2019s okay with the wedding itself.But isn\u2019t it too lonely for her to enter the wedding hall by herself, with no one to be part of her family.The Empress narrowed her eyes. Cedric swept his cheek.\u201cDid I say something weird?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dThe Empress shook her head.\u201cThe last time you said wasn\u2019t a lie.\u201dArtizea tilted her head. Because she didn\u2019t understand what she was saying.But Cedric noticed.His face flushed and avoided her gaze.\u201cDon\u2019t make fun of me.\u201dThen the Emperor came. There was a surprise in his eyes.\u201cCatherine.\u201dThe Empress hardened her face and threw a cold gaze at the Emperor. The Emperor feigned a calm attitude.\u201cWhy are you walking outside the Imperial Palace? Is your health a little better?\u201d\u201cMy lady-in-waiting is getting married, and my condition is not so bad that I cannot come and visit for a while.\u201d\u201cLady-in-waiting?\u201dThe Emperor threw a calculating gaze at Artizea.Artizea didn\u2019t look at him and put her eyes down.The Empress said.\u201cYou\u2019re not going to come to a wedding and tell the bride and groom to kneel are you?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t intend to.\u201dThe Emperor gave a hypocritical smile.\u201cI\u2019m just a little surprised. If you\u2019ve decided to go outside and get rid of the old things, it\u2019s welcomed. It\u2019s a wedding, so it\u2019s good to remember our old days.\u201dCedric and Artizea can see the Empress clenching her teeth.The Empress didn\u2019t dare to smile at the emperor. She just gave a cold reply.\u201cOkay. I \u2018m not saying I\u2019m going to be different. I thought I\u2019d rely on a good nephew and niece who could relax my heart as I live alone at this age.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good too. If you\u2019re thinking of a peaceful future.\u201dThe Emperor smiled. Then he unwrapped the diamond brooch from his own chest.\u201cIf you\u2019re going to be Tia\u2019s mother, let me stand in as Cedric\u2019s father\u2019s. I\u2019m glad they don\u2019t have to have a wedding without parents.\u201dTo a woman, her mother gives a pure gold orb, meaning to keep the shining heart as the day she got married.To a man, his father gives a new diamond that has never been used, meaning to keep a solid heart forever.And after the wedding, they combine it to create a memorial for the couple.That was the custom.The Emperor\u2019s brooch is not a new diamond, but since it was an Emperor\u2019s gift, it was not short of the new one.The Emperor attached the brooch to Cedric\u2019s chest.The band quickly noticed and began to play music. The attendant and the maids also stepped back a couple of steps to widen the distance.The Empress again took Artizea\u2019s hand.The Emperor came to Cedric\u2019s side and patted his shoulder again.The knights lined up on the left and right sides of the road made a silver roof with their swords.The flower girl, who took the lead, sprinkled flowers.The four slowly headed toward the altar.Upon reaching the altar, the Empress released Artizea\u2019s hand.And she changed the bouquet to the hand she had held so far. Then the Emperor reached out his hand to the Empress.\u201cGregor.\u201dThe Empress looked at him with a puzzled face. Tension floated between the two.\u201cIt\u2019s a wedding.\u201dHe said so, implying that there was nothing good to behave like an enemy in front of everyone else.Countless times the Empress put her hand on the Emperor\u2019s hands.She was unwilling, but this was one of the things Artizea asked for.This was the very purpose of why Artizea wanted to be her lady-in-waiting from the beginning.For the Empress to take the seat of Artizea\u2019s mother from Milaira.No matter how arbitrary the Emperor is, he will not be able to act with Milaira as her husband if the Empress attends.No, there was no way that Milaira could dare to show her face at the wedding, in which the Empress was present.Just thinking of acting as a couple with the Emperor was creepy.However, the Empress has already been prepared.As she took his hand, the Emperor smiled at her. It was a triumphant smile, as if it had forced the Empress down.When the two stepped back, Cedric took Artizea\u2019s hand.The Archbishop gave a pleased smile.\u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful couple that God will bless as well. Not only did the young two meet, but it also gave a chance for the couple who had been separated for a long time to reconcile. What could be better than this?\u201dArtizea bowed her head.***Milaira, who watched the scene, gave a fit of yelling.\u201cHow! How can you do this!\u201dThe servant held her arms as she tried to run.Lawrence sighed.\u201cDon\u2019t come, I told you, mother.\u201d\u201cLawrence!\u201d\u201cWhy can\u2019t you understand words like this?\u201d\u201cI am Tia\u2019s mother!\u201d\u201cSo, you\u2019re going to ruin her wedding now?\u201dMilaira looked at him with her bloodshot eyes.\u201cHow can you do this to me?\u201d\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Most of the seamstresses showed a sense of embarrassment, saying that reservations were full.As usual, if she swayed and prevailed, there would be a place to succumb.Milaira didn\u2019t do that.Her clothes and jewelry were her pride, but what she needed this time was not the clothes to wear when she and the Emperor\u2019s arms joined, but the clothes to wear as the bride\u2019s mother.She did not want to flaw herself at the wedding.\u2018No matter what, isn\u2019t it my daughter\u2019s wedding?\u2019That was the first thing she thought of after coming to her senses after being stuck in a room crying and angry for a few days.Every time she thought of Artizea\u2019s wedding, a hot fireball rose in her heart.Milaira, lying in her bed, hit her chest several times. She howled and got mad.She was angry and she could not stand it. She felt sad and resentful just imagining it.Milaira believed that her resentment was her anger towards Cedric.However, the wedding was allowed by the Emperor, so she couldn\u2019t help it.She couldn\u2019t have told Lawrence it was helpful too.\u2018Tia, how can that timid and stupid thing get married properly and start a new life without my help?\u2019The reason she hasn\u2019t been contacted so far is because Artizea was encouraged by the people around her. There is no man who keeps a straight face and intentions.Perhaps she was virtually imprisoned by Cedric.As she thought so, her mind was a little at peace.Even Artizea couldn\u2019t contact her, so Artizea is sure to be anxious by now.They will be able to reconcile. Although Artizea rebelled and complained this time, it won\u2019t last long.If Milaira allowed her to marry, she would cry and thank her and she would ask for forgiveness. Like she always did.How happy will Artizea be when she knows that her mother cares so much?Milaira had no invitations or contact. She only received a short letter from Lawrence saying not to come.Milaira didn\u2019t believe that was what Artizea meant. This is what Cedric did.So she thought she just needed to get to the wedding hall.No matter how much Cedric wants to do as he pleases, there\u2019s no way he can ignore his mother-in-law at the wedding.If the Emperor also sees the way Cedric treats her, he will listen to Milaira.So she quietly came to the wedding hall.Artizea\u2019s maid was waiting outside and guided her directly to the mansion.Milaira thought as she saw that. Artizea was also waiting for her.But Lawrence blocked her way.Milaira said.[You were here.][Go back. Mother. You\u2019re not to attend this wedding.]Lawrence said so. Just when he said that, Artizea came out of the mansion.Holding the Empress\u2019s hand. With a pure gold orb in her bouquet.Milaira screamed in shock, but it was buried in the cheers of the guests and employees.Music played by the band came from afar.At some point, the maid was gone.Milaira was so angry that she tried to run to Artizea.Lawrence had his servant to stop her.\u201cHow, how are you doing this? Are you Tia\u2019s brother? I\u2019m Tia\u2019s mother. Are you intending to make her a parentless child at her wedding?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s mother who made Tia a parentless child.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cYou beat her in front of others, grabbed her hair and pulled her out. Tia left the house, and that\u2019s why she wanted to cut off her relationship with mother.\u201d\u201cYou, are you saying you\u2019re okay with that?\u201d\u201cI understand Tia. It was too bad for me to see as well.\u201dLawrence said coldly.\u201cAnd if you think about Tia\u2019s position, you wouldn\u2019t have come. Would she like to go into the wedding hall with her mother holding her hand? Knowing mother\u2019s situation?\u201d\u201cWhat the hell are you talking about! I\u2019m the Marchioness of Rosan! I\u2019m Tia\u2019s mom!\u201d\u201cThe other person is not someone else, and it\u2019s Grand Duke Evron. My mother herself is not honorable. What does the title or the name of the marriage vows mean?\u201dLawrence said pitifully.Milaira looked at Lawrence with a shocked face.\u201cYou, you, how could you say that to your mother\u2026\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you not to come? There\u2019s nothing good for each other if you come.\u201dLawrence\u2019s face was accompanied with irritation and annoyance.\u201cTia is much smarter than mother. She knows what she really needs and she knows what to do.\u201dLawrence didn\u2019t know that the Empress would choose Artizea as her lady-in-waiting, he would not have thought it would be possible, even if she said she would.However, it was a perfect solution to Artizea\u2019s problem.Who would dare attack the woman who took Artizea\u2019s hand and brought her to the altar of her wedding for reasons of Milaira\u2019s identity or bloodline, especially when it\u2019s the Empress.This wedding will be perfect for the Evron couple.Artizea has said she was fine without Milaira.But Lawrence didn\u2019t know what she was going to do. He thought she was just saying she\u2019d stand the gossip.He didn\u2019t know she could convince the Empress.By the time they last met, Lawrence\u2019s assessment on Artizea had already begun to change.And today it was completely overturned.\u2018It\u2019s a little annoying that she didn\u2019t tell me in advance.\u2019Still, Artizea is well worth it.She was enough to be the Grand Duchess Evron, she even became the Empress\u2019s lady-in-waiting, and that was enough for Lawrence.Artizea gave him the opportunity to make acquaintances with the Empress. At the same time, she even showed that it was possible for him to be adopted by the Empress.Now all he had to do was stop Milaira.\u201cDoesn\u2019t my mother say you want me to be a prince?\u201d\u201cWhat does this have to do with it?\u201d\u201cTia said that the only legal way I can become a prince is to become adopted by the Empress.\u201d\u201cWell, do you think such a thing is possible? Don\u2019t you know the kind of relationship I have with the Empress?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s nothing you can\u2019t do right? Tia has become the Empress\u2019s lady-in-waiting. It means, at least because of mother, the Empress doesn\u2019t even consider your children like her enemies.\u201d\u201cThinking that it\u2019s possible, you\u2019re saying you\u2019re going to abandon your mom and hold Tia\u2019s hand now?\u201dMilaira\u2019s whole body trembled in anger.\u201cDid you leave the house with this intention? Even you? Saying that you\u2019re embarrassed and you don\u2019t need me?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t say I\u2019d throw you away. Why are you being so irrational?\u201dLawrence said annoyingly.\u201cI\u2019m just telling you to be quiet for a while. Be comfortable with Father and get along. Don\u2019t compete with the Empress or get angry.\u201d\u201cLawrence!\u201d\u201cThen, how will me or Tia take care of it? Can\u2019t we delay satisfying my mother\u2019s pride after that? When I become the Emperor, my mother becomes the Emperor\u2019s mother.\u201dMilaira\u2019s face blushed. She felt dizzy.\u201cYou, you\u2019re telling me, I\u2019m getting in trouble for some useless pride\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re still doing that right now, aren\u2019t you?\u201dLawrence said.\u201cWhen the Empress is in the bride\u2019s mother position, what are you going to do? Will you go and grab the Empress\u2019s hair and drag it? Or will you go next to Father and act as the mother of Grand Duke Evron?\u201d\u201cLawrence!\u201d\u201cIf mother comes out, the wedding will be ruined. Nobody wants that. How is mother going to stand before the Empress? If Father is angry, how are you going to deal with it?\u201dMeanwhile, the wedding continued over Lawrence\u2019s shoulder.The empress took Artizea\u2019s hand and headed in front of the altar.When she returned, the Empress took the Emperor\u2019s hand and came out.The two seats were prepared side by side at the table. A congratulatory address from the archbishop was heard.Flowers sprinkled, and the sword fell. Young choir sang a hymn.Knights of Grand Duke Evron followed with a loud voice and buried the voices of the choir.Milaira was weeping.She wiped her tears with her palm. The makeup smeared black and red.\u201cI didn\u2019t know you would do this to your mom.\u201d\u201cGo back. I\u2019ll see you after the wedding.\u201dLawrence said with concern that the wedding would be over.The Empress will probably return immediately after the wedding.Since Artizea once pulled the Empress from her palace, it is possible that she will continue to meet the Empress.But there won\u2019t be many chances. Every minute, every second was precious.Milaira knew Lawrence was glancing at the wedding. She also figured out why.She felt as if the world had turned around.\u201cWhat did Mom do to you.\u201d\u201cGo back, mother.\u201d\u201cWhat did mom do to you \u2026\u2026. I only want you to be successful\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cSo you have to help me do it well.\u201dLawrence said. Now, the way she spoke to him changed as if she could understand.\u201cDo you think this will work out?\u201dMilaira muttered in vain.\u201cThe only thing in the world left to believe in is blood.\u201d\u201cYes, I believe in that too.\u201dAnd for Lawrence, the Emperor is also his blood.Realizing that, Milaira was out of her mind.Lawrence approached her and gently wrapped her shoulders. And he said so sweetly,\u201cFirst, go back and take a rest. After sleeping, your reason will come back.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u201dMilaira snapped at Lawrence. Then she turned around.She felt as if her stomach felt empty. There was a small amount of despair.\u201cMadam!\u201dThe maid, who had been watching Milaira about to fall, quickly supported her.Lawrence ordered his servant.\u201cTake mother home.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u201dMilaira said in a split voice.\u201cEven if you don\u2019t keep an eye, I\u2019ll go back in peace.\u201dShe was confident that she knew men better than anyone else. The man with that voice had already ousted her from his heart to the point that he didn\u2019t even want to be pretentious.Even if he was her son.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 53": "Chapter 53Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 53Proofreader: xoxomonamiThe wedding came to an end.It was a wonderful and splendid wedding, worthy of the reputation of the Grand Duke Evron.The Empress held the bride\u2019s hand and the Emperor held the groom\u2019s hand. That alone is an incomparably honorable wedding.About half of the guests would have had different thoughts. However, no one had any unpleasant thoughts about this marriage. Everyone congratulated them with bright faces.The reception was magnificent. All the guests danced, ate and drank. The knights cheered, and the employees\u2019 feast was held separately.Ansgar, in the name of Grand Duke Evron and Marchioness Rosan, served the slums with plenty of alcohol and food.It went smoothly without anything ruined.The Empress left before the reception began. As she left, she said:[I\u2019ll watch you.]Artizea wasn\u2019t very worried. Because she was confident she would keep her promise.The Emperor left shortly after the Empress rose. At the reception, he danced a song with Artizea after Cedric.He said after congratulating her.[Now, I shouldn\u2019t be calling you Tia carelessly.][How would the Grand Duchess Evron claim my name in front of His Majesty\u2019s glory? Since the Grand Duke is your Majesty\u2019s nephew, I will be honored if you treat me like your niece.]Then the Emperor laughed.[Okay. I\u2019ll keep doing that. That would also be an honor to you.][I\u2019m overwhelmed with awe.][Tia, I knew you were smart, but I didn\u2019t know you were so bold.][I have never tried to deceive Your Majesty. Believe me.][No, that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m disappointed, I just realized refreshingly that even at this age, my eyes that see people aren\u2019t perfect.][I\u2019m overwhelmed with awe.][Cedric is straightforward. Such a character is an advantage, but there is a side that does not suit the secular capital. He\u2019s a good man, so take care of him so that he doesn\u2019t get harmed.][Yes.][And.\u2026 Don\u2019t hate her too much. That poor Miraila.]The Emperor said so and left.He seemed to already know that Miraila had come to the wedding and she was chased off by Lawrence.The Emperor was not the only one who noticed.Marchioness of Camellia and Grand Duke Roygar also approached and spoke about it in a quiet manner.[Because men are simple. They might think that it was because of Sir Lawrence that Her Majesty the Empress was present at the wedding instead of the Marchioness of Rosan. Not only did Sir Lawrence have a chance to see Her Majesty, they\u2019re going to think there\u2019s a potential for the brother and sister, as Her Majesty has made you her lady-in-waiting.][\u2026\u2026][But Her Majesty the Empress\u2019s cannot accept Sir Lawrence. Men often mistake a woman to love the child\u2019s father for life when a woman has children.][What do you want to say?][If anyone knows how important the Marquis of Rosan\u2019s role was playing this time, they will know the true meaning of what you have done\u2026][I do not know. I\u2019m not that proud of being separated from my mother.][By the way, I\u2019m glad that the present I gave you is worth it. Did you receive the statue of the Saintess for your wedding? Please show me when you come back from your honeymoon. I\u2019m very curious, so is Grand Duchess Roygar because she\u2019s never seen it before.]Grand Duchess Roygar was also sisters with the Marchioness Camellia.[Today, it was such an event, so she just greeted you for a while, but I will arrange a proper meeting next time. Congratulations on your wedding. Have fun on your honeymoon.]Marchioness Camelia greeted with a smile.Since then, she has been greeted and congratulated with countless people.She had to dance a total of 5 songs with Cedric, and then Lawrence and then Grand Duke Roygar.By the time she left the reception with fatigue, she was exhausted.Artizea and Cedric left while the reception was in full swing.Then she simply changed clothes and got on the boat. It was to go to the port city, which can be called the entrance to the capital.In the port there was a mansion of the Grand Duke Evron.It was much more convenient and faster to travel by sea than through land to get to Evron Grand Duchy. That\u2019s why they had middle-of-the-road accommodation.After sleeping there for one night, they were going to board the boat headed for the Grand Duchy.By the time they arrived at the mansion, it was already after sunset.Cedric was kidnapped by a group of knights celebrating the wedding the second time.Artizea was exhausted and headed to the room where she was led to.The maids prepared bath water and clothes to change. In the meantime, Artizea tried to rethink her wedding.There was no problem. All the desired objectives have been achieved.\u2018Now I just need to check the result.\u2019Alice pulled the door open and called.\u201cLady.\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201d\u201cOh no, no. You\u2019re the madame now? Oh, I love it. You\u2019re not the lady anymore, you\u2019re a madame.\u201dArtizea smiled.\u201cIs the bath ready?\u201d\u201cOh, yes, so is that. Sir Freil is here.\u201d\u201cLet him in.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dBecause of this, she was waiting without taking off her uncomfortable clothes.Freil came in. Seeing Artizea, he hesitated.\u201cWell, how should I greet you now? Grand Duchess? Lady Heiress?\u201d\u201cSay as you feel comfortable.\u201d\u201cThen Grand Duchess\u2026.\u201dFreil politely bowed his head and greeted her lightly. And reported.\u201cMadam Rosan went home right away from the wedding hall. I\u2019ve checked it myself, and you don\u2019t have to worry about being noticed.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dSince Bill was no more, there must have been no one to complain to.\u201cHis Majesty the Emperor also went straight from the wedding hall to the Rosan mansion. I came back after confirming that.\u201d\u201cWhat about brother?\u201d\u201cSir Lawrence has returned to the house of Baroness Andeman, where he is living now.\u201dArtizea sighed.Being rejected by Lawrence is like being denied by life itself. She must have had a tremendous shock.After the wedding, it would be nice for him to go to look for her.She was the one who made these calculative moves, but she didn\u2019t feel very good about it.Apart from that feeling, it was ultimately a good thing.Lawrence was not allowed to meet the Emperor in front of Miraila crying to strengthen the family\u2019s affection.The Emperor knows the physiology of power and likes to indulge it.But at the same time, he must show himself as friendly to his son.Lawrence is no longer the age of joking around on his parents\u2019 lap. He is both a son and a successor to the emperor.No matter what, his cute age has already passed by. By simply showing a desire for power, he may become like many other servants.So the right thing Lawrence had to do here was to flatter the Empress in public, and when it\u2019s over, run straight to Miraila.In front of the Emperor, he can show that he loves Miraila and comfort her with all his might.Then the Emperor would consider Lawrence\u2019s behavior right and be happy.Now the Emperor was seated with the Empress with a calm face, but then he got up early and went to Miraila.Lawrence\u2019s thoughts don\u2019t get there.\u2018Well, you don\u2019t know your mother\u2019s role. You don\u2019t know much about His Majesty, too, brother.\u2019It was enviable that he had lived while being loved so much to afford not to know. And she thought it was stupid.\u201cShall I keep watching?\u201d\u201cIf there is any news from brother Lawrence, please let me know. There is no need to keep an eye on him.\u201d\u201cYes. \u201c\u201cMore than that, watch my mother. Did Alice tell you about the informant of the Rosan mansion?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cObserve and keep an eye on the flow of the situation and record it. You don\u2019t need to do anything in advance. Leave it until I get back.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t forget to get in touch with Rye.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll remember it well.\u201dFreil scratched his head.\u201cBut, don\u2019t you think you\u2019re overworking me?\u201d\u201cYou have to use the talent you have.\u201dArtizea smiled. Freil sighed.\u201cAnyway, please, Your Grace, take good care of my master. I am worried that something will happen because this is the first time I\u2019m not following His Grace.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s in the north. I\u2019m sure Cedric knows much better than me. I\u2019m a stranger to strategy tactics.\u201d\u201cDid you know that I didn\u2019t mean it that way?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be too anxious anyway. I\u2019ll be right next to him to assist.\u201dFreil had an ambiguous face.\u201cWell, how do I say it\u2026. I\u2019m not saying that you have to serve His Grace.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just talking about the real thing. So, is this the end of the story?\u201d\u201cYes. \u201c\u201cI won\u2019t be able to see you for a while. In the meantime, stay healthy and work hard.\u201dArtizea raised her body. Freil replied to her with a military salute.And he said in a polite manner.\u201cCongratulations on your wedding. I was relieved that Your Grace became the Grand Duchess Evron.\u201d\u201cBecause you don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to ruin the Grand Duke Evron?\u201d\u201cAnd I think you\u2019re going to ruin someone I don\u2019t like.\u201dArtizea smiled. Then she greeted Freil in return and headed to the bathroom.And as Artizea came out of the bathroom, she encountered a terrifying reality.\u201cIt\u2019s the first night.\u201dSophie, with her cheeks dyed red, came out with her pajamas shyly.Those pink pajamas were terribly lovely.It was shiny, but it didn\u2019t look too glossy or shiny.The body line and pale-colored underlayer were thin enough to be slightly reflected, but the underlayer was not visible explicitly.The sleeves were slightly inflated and had frills. The hem of the skirt, which reaches the knee, naturally widens and spreads like a morning glory. One turn, it would be wrapped around the legs.The chest wasn\u2019t open. However, if only the ribbon tied over the chest was untied, the clothes would fall under her feet.\u201cSophie, what the hell is this?\u201dSophie replied to Artizea\u2019s absurd question.\u201cIt\u2019s pajamas. This is the latest fashion for bridal pajamas.\u201d\u201cDid Emily say that?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s true that it\u2019s the latest fashion. And it\u2019s perfect for a real bride\u2019s pajamas! Come on!\u201dArtizea felt dizzy.Sophie didn\u2019t know, because she believed it was a love marriage, so she wouldn\u2019t even think that nothing would happen the first night.\u201cBring other clothes.\u201d\u201cShall I bring the white one? There is also light blue.\u201dSophie said with excitement at Artizea\u2019s words.\u201cI think pink is good, but I think light blue will suit you too. The master will love whatever you wear. You will be cute and sexy!\u201d\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

And bring my pajamas.\u201d\u201cNo way, are you going to sleep in that old gray pajama? It\u2019s your first night!\u201d\u201c\u2026..It\u2019s comfortable. It\u2019s warm.\u201dArtizea hesitated for a moment.The pajamas she had been wearing were years old.As she grew tall, the sleeves and pants got shorter, so she sewed fabric to it. Besides, she wore it for so long that it got fluffy.Still, it was 100 times better than this pink pajamas.\u201cDon\u2019t say nonsense! And I don\u2019t even want to give it to you.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cWho brings such pajamas on their honeymoon? What would the people of the Evron Grand Duchy think when they see the new mistress wearing such pajamas?\u201d\u201cSophie.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t even put it out in the laundry room. At first, even in the marquisate, do you know how hard it was because everyone felt sorry for the kind of clothes my lady wears?\u201dShe felt a sudden pain in her bone.Okay. Let\u2019s say so. She knew it was necessary to make new indoor clothes and pajamas.So, she has left Emily and Sophie to get everything they needed.But she never thought they would bring something like this.\u201cBring something else. Couldn\u2019t you have an indoor dress or a gown?\u201d\u201cI have already loaded all the clothes chests on the ship. I left only clothes for tomorrow morning and this.\u201dIt was a dilemma.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Me and Madam Emily worked so hard to make you look the best and pretty.\u201dSophie smiled wide.\u201cObviously, the master will also fall in love with you.\u201dArtizea felt dizzy.Desperately, she regretted that she had left Sophie to do it. Even if she had to spare her busy time, she should have checked.She should have seen Sophie pack up.\u201cCome on.\u201dSophie shook her arm and the pajamas.***Eventually Artizea lost.It was because she didn\u2019t want to make a fuss of unloading her clothes from the ship near midnight or bringing other clothes from the capital\u2019s mansion.Soft pajamas wrapped around her legs, making Artizea feel strange.Even more to wear this pajama and enter the honeymoon room.The room was neatly decorated so that it was neither excessive nor insufficient.It was well ventilated and a scented candle was burning, giving it a soft scent. There was a soft, yellow curtain on the window.And there was an oversized bed. Of course.Artizea had never thought seriously about her honeymoon room until this moment.No matter what you say out there, with or without a ceremony, this marriage is not a real marriage.She also trusted Cedric. He is a man who knows what kindness is.Therefore, she didn\u2019t even worry about the problem of going to the honeymoon room.Even Artizea stepped forward and said she would use the same cabin on the ship with Grand Duke Evron.Shouldn\u2019t it be that way? In other words, if a newlywed couple who is married in a love-marriage uses a different room on their honeymoon, what would the people outside think of them?In other words, she only considered external issues.It wasn\u2019t until after entering the room that Sophie, who smiled, and Alice who cheered for her pajamas, saying that it was too pretty, did Artizea realize an internal problem.\u2018Wear this on, lie down there and sleep together?\u2019As she decided to do that, it sounded crazy. She couldn\u2019t sleep.Artizea knew why Cedric had such a strange face when she told him to share the cabin.\u201cHoo.\u201dArtizea looked around in her room.But no matter how much she thought about it, she couldn\u2019t think of a way out.She had no idea what rumor would spread if the bride left her room on the first night and slept elsewhere.Everyone in this mansion would have had their mouths full.Instead, it will bring unwanted worries and concern to the people. It was obvious to see that it would become more problematic.It is also a futile idea. It was unlikely that Cedric would care about how she was dressed.\u2018If you wear rags, he may be sorry.\u2019Still, Artizea pulled the blanket out of the bed. Then she curled up on the sofa and covered herself with the blanket.She was very tired, so Artizea quickly started to doze off.Even in her dreams, she was nervous. As a result, Artizea was surprised by the sound of the door opening and she jumped up.As Cedric came in, he said cautiously.\u201cI\u2019m sorry for being late. Isn\u2019t it past midnight right now? I couldn\u2019t get out\u2026..\u201dCedric looked at Artizea instead of apologizing.And he stopped without repeating all his words. Cedric\u2019s nape and ears turned red.Artizea didn\u2019t know why he looked that way at first. Then she realized that she had dropped the blanket, and she quickly picked it up.She made up her mind that it was just a little thin, and it was nothing. There is no exposure, nothing to be ashamed of.But that decision was of no use. She felt embarrassed to death.\u201cWell, well, because Sophie doesn\u2019t know anything. It looks like she made something called a bride\u2019s pajamas. Is it weird? I tried to find other clothes, but they said the clothes were on the ship, and I couldn\u2019t get them out during the night\u2026\u2026\u201dArtizea fired up excuses like rapid fire.Cedric shook his hand not to do so. Then he stroked his face once with his palm.\u201cIt\u2019s not strange. I think it\u2019s cute.\u201dThis time, Artizea turned red. On the other hand, her mind went blank.Cedric hesitated, then he approached Artizea.\u201cThis, this is Madame Emily\u2019s\u2026\u201dHer mouth was going to make more excuses, but Cedric\u2019s outstretched hand slightly touched Artizea\u2019s scattered hair.Artizea was surprised and hugged the blanket like a shield and sat down on the sofa.\u201cThe bed is for Lord Cedric. I\u2019ll sleep on the sofa.\u201d\u201cTia.\u201dThere was a moment of silence. Cedric breathed a little.He went to bed and sat down. Then he swept his face down once with his palm.\u201cI\u2019m sorry to have surprised you.\u201d\u201cOh, no.\u201dArtizea replied with a slight trembling voice. She couldn\u2019t figure out what was going to happen a while ago.\u201cIf you are uncomfortable using the same bed, I will sleep on the sofa.\u201d\u201cNo. I can\u2019t give up the blanket. I\u2019ll give up the bed instead.\u201d\u201cUse both the blanket and the bed. It\u2019s not cold, so I don\u2019t need a blanket.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t do that. How can I put the master on the sofa and sleep comfortably in bed?\u201d\u201cBut\u2026..\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a lot smaller. Lord Cedric, I don\u2019t think you can fold your legs in half to fit in the sofa.\u201cTia.\u201dCedric called her. Artizea spoke first before he could speak again.\u201cCan you turn off the light?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Sure. If you\u2019re comfortable with it, I\u2019ll do it.\u201dArtizea was relieved inside.Soon the bedroom got dark. Cedric\u2019s shadow lay on the bed.Artizea was finally relieved from the fire up her neck and closed her eyes.But she did not think she\u2019ll fall asleep. Until a while ago, she was so tired that she fell asleep in no time.Artizea realized that she was counting both her exhalation and inhalation.And Cedric also noticed that he sighed occasionally and made irregular breathing sounds.She had to do a post evaluation of today\u2019s wedding. Originally, before going to bed, she was going to check the results with Cedric and refine their future plans.But she couldn\u2019t. All she can see is a shadow, but why is she so nervous?After a while, Cedric jumped up and sat down.\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cWe have to use the same room for a while anyway. Wouldn\u2019t it be better to get used to it? We can\u2019t sleep like this in the cabin.\u201dBefore Artizea replied, he came over.He then stretched out his arms and held Artizea over the blanket.\u201cAh! \u201cArtizea struggled in surprise.Cedric effortlessly took her to the bed and laid her down.\u201cI didn\u2019t see it.\u201dArtizea couldn\u2019t understand for a moment what that meant.She belatedly found out that it meant that she was wearing a duvet and he didn\u2019t see her body.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I won\u2019t do anything.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not worried about that.\u201dHer words were sincere, but her voice trembled because of her shortness of breath.Cedric came into the blanket. The temperature inside the blanket has risen.Artizea recognizes the swaying of the bed, and she turns her back to him and lays her back on the bed.The bed was large so they could sleep without sufficient contact.But Cedric\u2019s hand gently hugged her from behind.\u201cGet used to it. I will too.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dArtizea shuddered because his lowly voice seemed to dig into her mind.As her cold limbs warmed to Cedric\u2019s body temperature, it tickled her. Artizea couldn\u2019t move and held her breath.There was silence again.This time Artizea started counting her heartbeat, not her breath.The sound of Cedric\u2019s heartbeat reaching her ears was far stronger than her own.It wasn\u2019t until she focused on her regular beats that she fell asleep.Perhaps because of her long tense time, as her body relaxed, Artizea was quickly dragged to the borders of her dreams.\u201cTia, are you asleep?\u201dHer answer didn\u2019t come back.Cedric gently raised his head and looked at Artizea\u2019s face.There was a murmur of breathing sound. The color of her lips, which had been pale all day long as her body warmed, turned pink.Cedric carefully touched his lips to her temples.\u2018I thought my heart was going to sink.\u2019He knew Artizea didn\u2019t see him as a man. Still, when he opened the door and saw her for the first time, he thought about her.Because she was so lovely.\u2018You should stop thinking about it.\u2019She\u2019s trusting him to the point that she falls asleep so defenselessly.He always wanted to hug her.She was as thin and delicate as he had thought, like she could break and disappear.Her body temperature was warm. Cedric decided to be happy that he could keep her hands and feet warm.After chasing a mirage for a long time, he saw the illusion of holding her in his arms. When he woke up from his dream, he was afraid that it would all crumble in blood.Cedric sighed and lightly gripped Artizea\u2019s left wrist. Even though it was time to go to bed, she was still wearing her diamond bracelet.His heart beat wildly.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The garden was not well maintained, and the cleaning condition was not good at a glance.\u201cThe butler is dead. I heard he met a robber.\u201dThe attendant reminded him. The Emperor exhaled.\u201cThat\u2019s understandable. Tia was in the Evron Grand Duchy, and Lawrence said he was staying in another house. I\u2019m sure she was lying with her head wrapped up.\u201dThe emperor gave a glare to the attendant.\u201cWhat are you doing without paying attention?\u201d\u201cI, I\u2019m sorry. Lawrence didn\u2019t like anyone being involved in the work of Rosan\u2019s mansion\u2026\u201d\u201cThat makes sense when he\u2019s at home.\u201dThe Emperor said disapprovingly.\u201cFind a guy. He\u2019s to be patient and good at work.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe attendant gave a deep bow.\u201cIsn\u2019t Lawrence still at the reception?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cHe didn\u2019t send a single person?\u201dAs the Emperor said so, he walked up the stairs.A small number of employees were surprised and quickly knelt down on their knees.There weren\u2019t many employees left in the mansion because many of them followed Artizea.The Emperor went up to Miraila\u2019s bedroom.Nora, the maid with a tray, was pacing at the door. Then she was surprised to see the emperor and the attendant.Nora was clumsy with her manners. She worked for a long time at the Rosan mansion. But she only worked in the laundry room. It was her first time seeing the Emperor in person.She thought she had to get her knees down, she couldn\u2019t figure out what to do with the tray.As Nora quivered, the attendant quickly accepted the tray instead.And then the attendant asked.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\u201cI, I\u2019m overwhelmed with awe. Oh, this is from Lady Artizea.\u201d\u201cTia, what?\u201d\u201cWell, that\u2019s\u2026 Lady Artizea said the Madam would be upset when she comes back and she told me to prepare a soup made of pumpkin and lemon, that\u2019s\u2026\u201dNora stumbled, and she started crying this time.It was yesterday that Artizea called her through Alice.[Tomorrow is my wedding.][Yes. Congratulations.][I didn\u2019t call you to congratulate me on the wedding, but I have something for you to do. Talk to the kitchen tomorrow morning and ask them to make a pumpkin and lemon soup.][What?][And when my mother comes back, bring it to her.][My lady, I\u2019m a maid in the laundry room.][Maybe my mother will be in a very bad mood and won\u2019t pay attention to you. She is much more likely to drink, and you don\u2019t really need to be in front of my mother.]Artizea said.[While snooping near the bedroom, when His Majesty comes, tell him that I told you to prepare the soup. That\u2019s it. If His Majesty does not come, you can take care of it yourself. To bring it or not.]Nora held her breath.[If I do that, will you write me a recommendation letter?][Nora!]Alice shouted in an angry voice. Nora bowed down after she grabbed Nora with a strong arm.Artizea looked down at Nora with cold eyes.[You dare to make a deal with me?][Ah, young lady\u2026 ]Nora wanted to get out of the Rosan mansion.Nora\u2019s eyes could see the Rosan mansion tilt. Not only was Miraila not going to be the owner, but she was even cruel. Nora had no reason to be stuck here.The employees who had worked for generations had already moved to another mansion or business of the Marquisate of Rosan, using the connections of the Hanson family.However, maids who didn\u2019t have any connections, like Nora, couldn\u2019t easily change jobs. Because Bill, who is supposed to write her letter of recommendation, is dead.Miraila grew increasingly violent. No one even wrote a letter of recommendation because they were afraid.So she grabbed Alice\u2019s outstretched hand like a rope.She\u2019d love it if Sophie could be the maid who praised her. She would have her write a letter of recommendation so she could go somewhere else if that was difficult.She wanted to get a definite answer on this occasion, but it was a mistake.Artizea said.[It\u2019s just to check if you\u2019re useful and if you can carry out my command properly.][I\u2019m sorry, lady.]Alice bowed her head deeply.Artizea sighed a little. She decided to forgive Alice by looking at her face.She said again.[It is about meeting the Emperor in person and speaking with him. If you\u2019re as useful as you think of yourself, you don\u2019t even have to ask me for a reward.]And now, Nora finds herself useless.She just had to snoop around with the soup and tell the Emperor the truth, but she couldn\u2019t speak.When she thought she was in front of the Emperor, her head turned blank.The Emperor showed frustration at Nora. The attendant replied quickly.\u201cThat\u2019s enough. I\u2019ll bring the soup, so you go back.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m overwhelmed with awe.\u201dNora bowed her head down. And as if running away, she left the scene.The Emperor sighed.\u201cBut Tia is better.\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t daughters\u2019 minds more delicate?\u201d\u201cIf there were only one child of mine like Tia, I would have long decided on a successor.\u201d\u201cDo you appreciate her that much?\u201dThe attendant asked in surprise. The emperor lamented.\u201cTia knows how she should behave. She knows how to put her pride and feelings behind. I thought she was overly timid, but I saw what she did to the Empress this time. She has determination and is also bold.\u201dThe Emperor glanced to open the door. When he opened the door of the bedroom, several empty liquor bottles were rolling around on the floor. Even the maid, close to Miraila, was not standing by her side.The Emperor frowned. However, he once again sighed and relaxed his expression.Miraila was lying in bed in a drunken stupor. She felt a person coming in, but she didn\u2019t respond. She didn\u2019t even have the energy.Her tears didn\u2019t dry out and shed constantly. She was so stunned and sad that she wanted to die.[My mother herself is not honorable. What does the title or the name of the marriage vows mean?]Lawrence\u2019s words didn\u2019t leave her mind.Miraila always carried her head up with a proud face. All the expensive and colorful objects in the world were wrapped around her body. She did not tolerate anyone who disobeyed her own words.Miraila deliberately trampled on a person to see if the power in her hand was real.When the ladies of the social world bent their knees and bowed to her, she was finally satisfied. She could beat an employee to death and cast them aside.But she knew more than anyone else that Miraila herself was not honorable.Miraila had never had a decent wedding.Her marriage was all about sitting face to face with an old man who couldn\u2019t even walk properly and signing the papers.There were no bouquets and no guests. There was no pure gold orb to receive from her mother.The priest, who came to notarize her marriage, looked at her with his eyes, as if seeing her as a dirty thing. And as soon as the signing was finished, he hurried to leave without giving a proper blessing.The Emperor dressed her in a white dress that night.However, the skirt of the wedding dress was all mesh, so the inside was transparent. It could not be as cherished as others.It was evidence of her favor, but not that she was proudly married.[What kind of wife is that woman who lives like a corpse at the Empress\u2019s Palace? You are my wife.]The Emperor often said so, seeing Miraila with her lovable face.The Emperor gave her numerous things.Miraila rode a carriage with the imperial crest. She even went to imperial ceremonies where she took the Emperor\u2019s hand and became his wife.The Emperor put her on his lap and at occasions held the seal in her hand.She had even personally stamped the papers that govern the fate of the country.Miraila was the only one who could freely enter the bedroom of the Emperor.However, only the Empress seat was not allowed to Miraila.She is the Emperor\u2019s mistress, and she is not the empress.The Emperor gave Miraila everything he could give her whenever she felt like it, but he did not give her a legitimate right to be protected in the name of God.While the Emperor is alive, it will be Miraila who is in his bed.However, it would be the Empress who was buried in the same tomb as the Emperor and her name engraved on the tombstone.Lawrence is right. She was dishonorable.But she didn\u2019t know Lawrence would blame her.Even though everyone in the world could blame her for being dirty, Lawrence and Artizea alone shouldn\u2019t.\u201cHow can they? To tell me\u2026\u2026. I raised them.\u201dMiraila murmured.The Emperor approached and sat down by the bed on which Miraila was lying.The mattress dipped and her body tilted. Miraila did not turn her head and buried her face on the pillow.The Emperor stroked Miraila\u2019s hair with a gentle touch.\u201cAre you angry?\u201d\u201c\u2026.go.\u201dMiraila said in a cracked voice.\u201cI guess I should be seriously punishing Lawrence for making you so sad.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t do that.\u201d\u201cAre you still worried about Lawrence?\u201dMiraila replied in a sobbing voice.\u201cDid you know everything from the beginning?\u201d\u201cMe? What?\u201d\u201cDid you know that Tia became the Empress\u2019s lady-in waiting or why Lawrence told me not to come? So, you didn\u2019t even tell me to go to the wedding today\u2026\u201d\u201cNo. No matter how bright my eyes and ears, how would I know what happened inside the Empress\u2019s palace?\u201dThe Emperor said with a sigh.\u201cI knew Tia went to the Empress\u2019s Palace and got a wedding present. But, it\u2019s natural for the groom Cedric to greet her. I never imagined she could have done such a great deal.\u201d\u201c\u2026..You\u2019re praising Tia.\u201dThe Emperor groaned at Miraila\u2019s murmur.\u201cEveryone, how can you do this to me\u2026 .\u201dHer weeping got louder again.\u201cThe Empress took it all from me. My son and my daughter. The only upper hand I had against her was them.\u201d\u201cRelax, don\u2019t burden yourself. The kids are supposed to leave when they grow up anyway. I would do anything. What\u2019s so upsetting you?\u201dThe emperor pulled Miraila. Miraila was held in his arms without strength.\u2018Then can you make me an empress? Can you make me honorable?\u2019Miraila didn\u2019t say such stupid words.When she was young, she had spoken out a few times.But now Miraila doesn\u2019t say that. She didn\u2019t even believe in the Emperor.A man is not to be trusted.Now he loves her. She is pretty.But as the years go by and her beauty fades, she will be thrown away. If she offends him, she will be thrown away. She will be thrown away if she fails to please him.[All that remains is blood.]It was sincere to say that to Artizea.But there was no blood left.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It was based on an experienced messenger continually changing horses and running.There was a way. However, on the way, you have to go through a vast barren land.The Evron Grand Duchy was a large land with a low population of people. Wherever you go, no village will appear. Homelessness continued when moving by land, and it was cold and windy. It wasn\u2019t an easy way for ordinary people to go.So, from Spring to Autumn, most of them used sea routes for transporting goods and for people to travel.In Winter, the port of Evron Grand Duchy is mostly frozen. At that time, exchanges with the mainland of the Empire declined.That was the reason why the people of the Empire called the Northern people distinctly as Northerners.\u201cReally, it seems a little scary. It\u2019s like a foreign country.\u201dAlice said to Artizea.The two stood on a boat going back up the river.Artizea has crossed the sea in a large ship for over a month. And yesterday they changed into a sleek and fast ship that moved from the estuary to the main city.The scenery seen by the river was as exotic and unfamiliar as Alice said.There was a large river, so water was abundant and the plain was wide, but there was no village. They changed boats at the port and were moving fast for over a day, but she couldn\u2019t see any area where people live.Trees that stretched high into the sky formed forests. There were ice caps sitting in the mountain range that circled far away and surrounded the land as if to trap it. Drift ice could be seen from the sea.\u201cOh, Madam, look over there! It\u2019s a deer!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you get tired of seeing so much?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s interesting. They don\u2019t run away even if they see people.\u201dIt was not easy to see wild animals in the capital. Though crossing the city boundaries, everyone lived in the area. There were mountains and forests. But it was all managed.This place was completely different.Artizea threw her gaze far away.The sound of the waves and the wind deafened her eyes. Wrapped in this sound the whole time, she was about to forget what it was like to be quiet now.\u201cWhat are you looking at in the blowing cold wind?\u201dCedric said, wrapping Artizea in a fur cape from behind. Artizea was surprised because she couldn\u2019t hear anything.\u201cAh.\u201dFire burned to her cheek over nothing.She got used to this too. Funny enough, it was all thanks to motion sickness.The ship Cedric used to travel to and from Evron Grand Duchy was very large, stable, and luxurious.However, during the first 15 days, Artizea suffered from seasickness. As she lived with sugar water and chocolate, the weight that she had been slightly attached with was about to come off again..It was useless to worry about using the same cabin as Cedric. She didn\u2019t even have enough spirit to do that.By the time her body got used to the ship, the awkward and embarrassing memories of the first night were roughly covered in time. She got used to Cedric as she climbed up and down the deck to breathe fresh air.Artizea fiddled with the brooch that Cedric put on her cloak. With her head down, she didn\u2019t know what kind of face she was making.It took some time to pretend to be calm.\u201cAlice still seems to be fascinated by the strange landscape.\u201d\u201cThe atmosphere is different from the central region.\u201cAutumn is gone.\u201dUnlike the mild Imperial capital, Evron Grand Duchy was a cold region.When the Great Duke\u2019s southern boundary, Elia Wall, was crossed, the air temperature changed from there. And the northern boundary line, the Thold Mountains, was also the northern limit line where humans could survive.It was around late Summer when she had their wedding. More than a month has passed since then, so now the capital will be in Autumn.But it was already Winter here.\u201cIt\u2019s Autumn here. It\u2019s still a little better, but the wind is stronger when you go to the mainland. It will get colder in the future.\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t overdo it.\u201d\u201cYour words are hard to trust. I would have liked you staying in the capital.\u201dArtizea laughed at the criticism.\u201cIt\u2019s kind of weird to hear that we\u2019re separated as soon as we get married. And it\u2019s better to stay away from the capital city.\u201dUntil the seeded conspiracies sprout and grow.And for a while she needed to rest her head. When she returns, she will be busy harvesting.\u201cThis is the first time you have left the capital, right?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026..\u201dArtizea looked far away.She did so in the past. Artizea never left the capital until Cedric showed her the fallen empire.She was the one sitting in her dark back room, moving the chess pieces and pulling the threads.There were times when what was happening in the Imperial Palace or in the social world needed to be done directly, but as the number of people increased and the scope of conspiracy widened, there was no direct movement.She had never seen the endless horizon of the West, or the beautiful hilly map of the East.The same was true of the North.When she thinks about it now, it was something she didn\u2019t need to do from the beginning.Seizing power and conspiring can be done in a room.But politics is about life. She should have known that living lives exist separately.If she had seen the world a little earlier, would she have done that?\u201cTia, what are you thinking?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not thinking about anything.\u201dArtizea consciously emptied her head.Not yet. This was just the beginning. One\u2019s life shouldn\u2019t have been considered more than a number.For a moment she stood in the cold wind.Because Cedric was standing too close. Artizea corrected her consciousness to keep focusing on him.\u201cTia.\u201dCedric called her again. For no reason, her body temperature rose.\u201cI see the mainland!\u201dSomeone shouted the moment she was about to lose balance and reveal her embarrassment.Artizea opened her eyes. As they went half way through a forest, she saw a majestic, but crude stone castle.\u201cWow!\u201dShe heard Sophie cry when she came up.Cedric said.\u201cI hope you\u2019re not disappointed.\u201d\u201cWhy would anyone who knows the history of the Evron Grand Duchy be disappointed? This is the pride of the Evron Grand Duchy.\u201dThe history of Evron Grand Duchy was made up of endless wars. This is because a group of monsters called Karam regularly traveled south across the Thold Mountains.Foot traffic was not inconvenient here either. In fact, the resource-rich and densely populated areas were further South.Considering the smoothness of governance, it was right to build the mainland a little further South. Considering the exchange with other regions, it should have been located close to a port that does not freeze.But the Evron Grand Duchy did not. Instead, they built a defensive fortress close to the border and built a nest there.When the defense line of the Thold Mountains fell, it was to protect the people who could not evacuate.If only enough food was stored, it could last for several years.When the beacon rises when the defensive line has collapsed, all the neighboring common people gather by the fortress. And while the stronghold is holding the line, the Southerners were forced to evacuate under the second line of defense, the Elia Wall.In short, the fortress was a sign that the Grand Duchy was protecting the Thold Mountains, and it was also a symbol of the life they live for the common people.That is why Evron is called the Evron of the North, the Shield of the Empire.Cedric smiled awkwardly. He was pleased with the praise for the family and also ashamed to accept it as his own.\u201cFortunately, we haven\u2019t actually used it yet. Anyway, it\u2019s certain that the interior is not as tacky as it looks. It\u2019s not a castle that was originally designed around the comfort of life\u2026\u201d\u201cIt will block the wind well.\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s based on a familiarity standard\u2026\u201dCedric groaned unsurely.Artizea wore her fur cape, and the maids were also wearing their own coats.However, Cedric and his knights and servants were all wearing thin clothes. Some of the sailors wore short sleeves.Artizea only smiled.The ship was soon connected to the dock that was connected to the mainland. The knights first came down, and then Cedric escorted Artizea.All the guards and employees of the mainland were lined up at the dock.\u201cHave you been well, Grand Duke?\u201dA middle-aged couple dressed in classy clothes came to the front and bowed.\u201cI\u2019m glad you look healthy, Aaron, Margaret.\u201dCedric hugged the two lightly once. And he introduced them to Artizea.\u201cTia, these two are Count and Countess Jordyn. They are responsible for the management of the estate while I am away.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s an honor to meet you, Your Grace. We have been waiting for your arrival.\u201dCount and Countess Jordyn knelt together.Artizea also gently nodded and greeted the two. And she said.\u201cYou may rise. I\u2019m glad to meet the trustworthy servants of Grand Duke Evron. I hope you will help me a lot in the future until I get used to the circumstances of the estate.\u201d\u201cI will try my best to help.\u201dThe two answered together.\u201cEveryone is gathered to greet you two.\u201dAaron said.\u201cYou came after the wedding ceremony, but you have to do the wedding here as well. How many people do you think have been waiting for you to get married?\u201d\u201cWell, reception is a little\u2026. What do you think?\u201dCedric turned to Artizea and asked.\u201cAfter three years, you came back safely from the Monster Wave. I fully understand the desire of wanting to have a feast.\u201d\u201cWill you be okay?\u201d\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I be okay?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you hate crowds?\u201dArtizea was a little surprised.That\u2019s true.The reason she avoids balls is because her clothes are shabby, appearance was complex, and because of her poor dancing skills.But overall, she didn\u2019t like crowds. Because she had a lot of thoughts, she got tired quickly in places with many people.But she didn\u2019t know that Cedric knew that.It was then. A girl jumped out of the crowd and jumped into Cedric\u2019s arms.\u201cYour Majesty! You\u2019re back!\u201d\u201cOh.\u201dCedric was startled. He held the leaping girl as if to prevent her from colliding with Artizea.Margaret hurriedly grabbed the girl\u2019s hand.\u201cAubrey, what a rude thing to do!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I heard it too late when the ship was coming in. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re back, Your Grace.\u201dAubrey blushed and looked up at Cedric with a shy face.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She was a 15-year-old girl who was still a child when she last met Cedric.And he had more vivid memories when she was 7 and 8 years old.\u201cAubrey? You?\u201dCedric was startled.\u201cYou\u2019ve grown a lot.\u201d\u201cYes, Your Grace. I\u2019m an adult now. I\u2019m 18 years old.\u201dAubrey looked up as she clung onto Cedric.Cedric gently shook his arms and pushed Aubrey off. When he was young, he loved her like a younger sister and she was cute, but this was the age that he shouldn\u2019t indulge such behavior.Aubrey was shocked. It was the first time he didn\u2019t hug her when she clung onto Cedric.Margaret quickly grabbed Aubrey\u2019s arm and dragged her to the side. And she lowered her head.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Your Grace. I didn\u2019t raise my daughter very well.\u201d\u201cNo. It\u2019s been a long time so she was excited to see me. Aubrey\u2019s already grown like this, I can\u2019t believe how long I\u2019ve been away.\u201d\u201cYour Grace has changed a lot.\u201dAaron stepped in and laughed to avoid making the mood awkward. Cedric laughed too.\u201cThree years ago, I was a kid.\u201d\u201cYour Grace, even when you were only twenty, you were not an ordinary child.\u201d\u201cDoes that mean I look older?\u201dCedric stroked his cheek. And he looked back at Artizea with a sneaky glance.Artizea tilted her head.\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cNothing.\u201dCedric scratched his slightly red cheeks with his index finger. Then he reached out his hand to her with a soft face.\u201cFirst of all, go to the room. I\u2019ll give you a guide to the castle after warming up and resting. I\u2019ll think about it tomorrow whether to have a greeting or having a reception.\u201d\u201cI heard It\u2019s still Autumn.\u201dArtizea smiled.\u201cNot me, but you. You\u2019ve been on the boat for over a month, that your lips have turned white.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not so tired.\u201dAs Artizea said so, she put her hand on Cedric\u2019s hand.Then Cedric flipped his hand and grabbed Artizea\u2019s hand.Artizea flinched. Her embarrassed fingers flinched and scratched Cedric\u2019s palm.Cedric succeeded in maintaining his normal expression, but his earlobes reddened.The people of the Grand Duchy who saw it silently glanced at each other. The words they wanted to say, but no one took it out of their mouth.Alice, Sophie, and Rize smiled happily with satisfaction.Artizea turned her gaze to the wrong place. Her hands were cold, and Cedric\u2019s hands were hot.Strangely, however, she had the illusion that even her own hands were hot.It was a lie that she got used to it. Rather, it was getting strange, so even touching his fingertips made her head white.For no reason, she was breathless. She kept reliving the memory of his embrace that she felt through her thin pajamas.It was not known when the memory would disappear from her skin.\u201cLet\u2019s go in.\u201dCedric whispered into Artizea\u2019s ear with a lower voice than usual.Artizea lowered her head. Cedric pulled her hand and she folded her arms.However, he did not let go of her hand.Aaron took the lead in a hurry.\u201cI\u2019ve cleaned up the Grand Duchess\u2019 room. I did it on my own, but there is a limit to what I can do here. I was worried about it being unsophisticated, so I did not decorate it. How about doing it yourself?\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dArtizea pretended to be calm on the outside, trying to press down her clamoring heart.She then suddenly felt a gaze and looked back.Aubrey was staring at Artizea without even thinking of hiding her roaring expression of hatred.\u2018This.\u2019Artizea got embarrassed.This is difficult to handle.She couldn\u2019t pretend she didn\u2019t know, though. If Aubrey was trying to hide her emotions, then she would have never known. However, she carried an expression that blatantly exposed her hatred. Leaving such a defiant distracts the family.Cedric shook her hand lightly to make her focus on him.Cedric smiled as she looked back at his gaze.***Artizea\u2019s bedroom was next to Cedric\u2019s bedroom. It was said to be a space used as a bedroom for the Grand Duke and the Grand Duchess from generation to generation.There was a door between the two rooms, so it was possible to go back and forth without going through the corridor.\u201cYou can lock both sides. The keys on both sides are different, so if you lock on one side, you cannot open on the other side.\u201dAt Aaron\u2019s explanation, Artizea laughed.\u201cIs it for a couple\u2019s fight? So, to spread the distance and arrange a room\u2026.. Oh, was the door for in case of an emergency.\u201d\u201cThe retreat is on the side of my room. I\u2019ll show you how to open it later.\u201dCedric said so.\u201cIsn\u2019t it a secret passage?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s no secret how to go from inside to outside. It\u2019s prepared for emergencies. Since there\u2019s no one to communicate with Karam, anyone knows the passages.\u201d\u201cAh, yes. If that\u2019s the case, I\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201dThere was a Tuvalet room and a small bathroom opposite Cedric\u2019s bedroom. There was also a space that could be used as a study next to the reception room.The bedroom wasn\u2019t big. Fur hung tightly on the walls everywhere. The floor was also covered with fluffy fur enough to cover the ankles.Artizea reached out her hand and touched the wall.\u201cAll rooms are made small because if the space is large, it gets cold quickly. There are many vacant rooms, so please tell us if you need more space.\u201d\u201cIs this a bearskin?\u201d\u201cOh, yes. This is better than a tapestry, it blocks drafts better. If you don\u2019t like it, I\u2019ll buy something else.\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s not because I don\u2019t like it, but because it\u2019s too extravagant\u2026\u201dArtizea muttered.\u201cEven the predecessor\u2019s Grand Duchess wore fur in the living space. It\u2019s still okay, but when Winter comes, it\u2019s difficult for people who are not from this place to bear.\u201d\u201cYes. I see.\u201dArtizea answered and turned to Cedric. Cedric nodded his head.\u201cThe warmth seems to be enough. I\u2019m warming up without doing anything too much. The people below will do well, but\u2026.. The only thing you can\u2019t do is take care of yourself.\u201d\u201cI feel like a very incompetent person if you say that.\u201dCedric laughed.\u201cFirst of all, take a break. I\u2019ll pick you up when it\u2019s time for dinner. I\u2019ll first take a look at the situation.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s talk in the evening about what to do tomorrow. There are many things I\u2019d like to ask for your opinion about.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dCedric reached out his hand.Artizea was shocked and stiffened her body. Cedric\u2019s thumb gently swept through Artizea\u2019s eyes.\u201cRest.\u201dHe spoke kindly and went out.Aaron and other vassals bowed their head to greet her and followed Cedric.\u201cMadam, have a seat.\u201dSophie took Artizea\u2019s cloak off. Artizea sat in the armchair.She wasn\u2019t aware of the cold, but she melted as she sat in front of the fireplace.She was bothered by the brooch that Cedric gave her. Artizea, caught in a subtle mood, fiddled with it in her hand mindlessly.The brooch was engraved with the crest of Evron Grand Duchy.She was busy in the capital, so she couldn\u2019t afford to think carefully. However, when she came here, she realized that she got the name of Cedric\u2019s wife anyway, even if it was only a formality.For the time being, the mistress of this stronghold is herself.Looking back at it, why didn\u2019t she ever think about getting married in her previous life?Artizea recalled the past.She never really thought that she hated political marriage.When she was young, her mother and her brother were everything in the world to her, but as she got older, she might have wanted to run away with marriage.It wasn\u2019t that there were no men who approached her at all.Even when she became Marchioness of Rosan, even after Lawrence stabilized his position as the Crown Prince, there were men approaching her for her position and her fortune.Artizea never paid attention to them.\u2018Is it because I can see right through them?\u2018Even superficial tenderness must have shaken her heart. Like she did when Lawrence was good at times.Or maybe she did it because she knew that she would eventually be purged.\u201cWhew.\u201dArtizea leaned her neck against the backrest, and she briefly closed her eyes and then opened it.\u201cRize, go and call Margaret. Now I have to greet her.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dRize quickly went outside.Margaret was waiting outside with a butler, the chief maid, and several senior employees. When she was told that she was called by Artizea, she hurried in.After Artizea was greeted by the employees, she said:\u201cIt\u2019s not a small thing to live in the stronghold, and it would be more so to someone who had stayed for a few months a year at the most. I want you to take care of it like you\u2019ve done so far. If you are a person Cedric trusts, I can trust you as well. .\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cMost of my servants are the maids I brought. But the number will be insufficient, so if there is someone who is a good maid, you can choose a few people and send them to me. I hope my maid never fails to say what they have to say or do what they have to do.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThat was the only thing she asked of the employees.After dismissing the butler and the chief maid, Artizea looked at Margaret.Margaret was very nervous.Margaret had no intention of disregarding Artizea as she is the newly married young mistress.She was the Grand Duchess that Cedric chose. That alone was enough reason to be loyal.But apart from that, Artizea carried a dignity she could not dare to relax and deal with. She was like a completely different person than when she was holding Cedric with her hand and blushing shyly.\u201cMargaret, as you know, I didn\u2019t bring any lady-in-waitings from my family. It\u2019s because I didn\u2019t have any relatives and no acquaintances.\u201dArtizea said in a slow voice. Margaret responded politely.\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThe lady-in-waiting I\u2019m going to choose will be from among the Evron Grand Duchy and its closely related family. I hope you will advise me on that.\u201dKnowing what would come next, Margaret took a breath.\u201cFirst, I wonder, how about Miss Aubrey? If it were the daughter of Count Jordyn, she would be fitting if I considered her status, her loyalty, and her age, which is similar to mine, so our conversation would be good. I believe she can help me adapt to life here.\u201dArtizea said so.She had to sort out the ranks in advance.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 58": "Chapter 58Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 58Proofreader: xoxomonamiMargaret didn\u2019t know what to do.As a vassal of the Grand Duke Evron, she ought to be pleased that the new Grand Duchess would only select her lady-in-waiting from within the Evron Grand Duchy.This is because it means that she will not attract the forces of her own family or create a new one.She also says she\u2019s going to take her own daughter as her first lady-in-waiting. This is to show deep trust in Count Jordyn and strengthen their ties. It was also an honor.If the successor was conceived in Artizea\u2019s body, it was even more important.A child born is bound to be intimate with the mother\u2019s ladies-in-waiting, while they are under the mother\u2019s care.The nanny and the first tutor were also usually chosen among the ladies-in-waiting.However, Margaret couldn\u2019t lift her head.\u201cAubrey\u2026 only appears grown up, but she is still an immature child. She has no manners, that I can\u2019t possibly let her serve the Grand Duchess.\u201dMargaret knew Artizea\u2019s eyes were slowly scanning her.She would have been insecure even if Artizea hadn\u2019t met Aubrey, but she had already seen Aubrey.She also saw Aubrey blatantly antagonizing her. She would already know why, too.In fact, Margaret thought Artizea would be angry. There was no excuse, so she would first apologize deeply and then scold Aubrey until she came to her senses.But she said she would make Aubrey her lady-in-waiting with such an elegant attitude. Margaret got goosebumps.Whether her act of conciliation was for the purpose of putting Aubrey under her hand, or to make sure she knows who is their superior.Either way, it wasn\u2019t something someone of Artizea\u2019s age would think of.Margaret admired the wiseness of her new mistress. Meanwhile, she was also afraid as the mother of her foolish daughter at the same age.Artizea said slowly.\u201cWe\u2019re in the same castle anyway, and even if you hide her, will she be hidden?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like that\u2026\u201d\u201cIf she doesn\u2019t have an etiquette, then she should learn more etiquette. When I heard from His Grace that Count Jordyn was a trusted family, I wanted to invite the lady-in-waiting for the first time. It\u2019s embarrassing that you cannot give your daughter..\u201dMargaret bowed her head deeply because she had nothing to say.\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean that I doubt your loyalty to Evron.\u201d\u201cNo. Please take away those fearful words. Please don\u2019t say that as you are the Grand Duchess of Evron.\u201dAnd she finally said.\u201cIt is a great honor to hear that the Grand Duchess is going to take my foolish daughter. There will be many mistakes, so please guide us a lot.\u201dArtizea slowly nodded her head.Contrary to Margaret\u2019s thoughts, she wasn\u2019t upset with Aubrey.It was because she wanted to crack down on Aubrey in advance.Artizea was the Marchioness of Rosan, and she held the empress\u2019s hand instead of her mother\u2019s at the wedding.Aubrey ran into Cedric\u2019s arms without any sign of being conscious in front of her.Until now, Cedric must have been so sweet. He originally is fond of children and regarded the people of the Grand Duchy as family members. He probably thought she was like his younger sister.However, he is allowed to do so because his subordinates did not forget their loyalty.If there is someone who doesn\u2019t know up and down like Aubrey, it will surely be a problem someday. It is for the sake of the Evron Grand Duchy that the buds are cut in advance.For the future when Lisia became the Grand Duchess.\u2018Really?\u2019Such a question suddenly ran through the inside of her chest and stuck in her head.\u2018Aren\u2019t you angry? Really? It doesn\u2019t matter emotionally?\u2019Artizea threw her gaze into the fireplace and quietly fell into her thoughts.She casually put her hand on her chest. Her heart was heavy as if a stone was on it.But Artizea did not check what was on her heart.It was because she instinctively realized that she shouldn\u2019t.***Cedric, who was picking her up at dinner time, appeared earlier than expected. Behind him was a servant pushing a trolley with food.Alice, who opened the door carefully, was flustered. She didn\u2019t think the visitor would be Cedric.\u201cThe madam is sleeping.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201dCedric hesitated for a moment.If he had been in the capital, he would have said he would come again and turn around. But Cedric didn\u2019t this time.They slept in the same cabin for more than a month. Besides, they were married externally, and it would be okay to not have gone that far.Alice also informed him, but she didn\u2019t stop him from entering.Cedric stepped into the warm bedroom.Artizea sat asleep in front of the fireplace.He thought she had a good rest on the ship. However, she seems to have been tired, as Cedric said. As her soles and knees warmed, her drowsiness came.It was said that the Evron Grand Duchy was cold, but this room was not. Rather, it was warmer than Artizea\u2019s bedroom in the Rosan mansion.This is thanks to the heated room. The fur skin was warm.Cedric approached her and laid the plate down on the table. Because of the heat, Artizea\u2019s cheeks were flushed nicely.\u201c\u2026..\u201dWould it be better not to wake her up?With that thought, Cedric approached Artizea\u2019s side.The servant left the trolley and went out silently. Alice followed and carefully closed the door.Cedric pulled the chair and sat next to Artizea, looking at her sleeping face for a while.But it would be right to wake her up too. Sleep was important, but a meal was also important.She barely gained weight after working hard for several months.Cedric quietly reached out his hand. It\u2019s good if she wakes up, and it\u2019s okay if she doesn\u2019t wake up. He thought about it and tried to cover her cheek slightly.\u201cAh.\u201dArtizea opened her eyes in amazement at the image of his palms almost touching her down on the cheek.Cedric, who couldn\u2019t even touch it, awkwardly lowered his hand.He openly clenched and opened his fist a few times. It would be an excuse to try to touch her because he was curious if her cheeks were warm.While she couldn\u2019t speak, Artizea blinked her eyes a few times and she said \u201cAh,\u201d again. It was an unknown face when Cedric tried to touch her cheek.\u201cI thought I was dreaming.\u201d\u201cAm I in your dream?\u201d\u201c\u2026 I do not know.\u201dA bitter smile formed on Artizea\u2019s lips.\u201cWas it a bad dream?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dArtizea replied briefly. It wasn\u2019t a dream, so the word bad dream was inappropriate.Rather, the way he was looking at her so tenderly now seemed like a vain dream.Artizea tried to get up. But after sleeping a little, then standing up after a little sleep, she felt heavier as if she had extra legs and arms.\u201cYou should rest more.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it dinner time?\u201d\u201cYou were tired, so I didn\u2019t think it was necessary to go down to the dining hall, so I brought the food here instead.\u201d\u201cBut to greet the vassals \u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cI decided to skip it today. We\u2019re going to have a proper banquet the day after tomorrow. Is that okay?\u201d\u201cOf course. \u201cArtizea sighed briefly and buried herself in the armchair. If she can take another day off, she was grateful.Cedric stood up. He pushed the trolley and came by the armchair.He opened the soup warmer lid and transferred the soup to a bowl.\u201cIt smells delicious.\u201dUntil then, Artizea, who had been sitting blankly against the armchair, woke up.\u201cDon\u2019t get up, I\u2019ll give it to you.\u201d\u201cOh, I have to. \u2026\u2026\u201dCedric was one step faster. He already took the soup bowl and spoon it up before her body was raised.\u201cSit in a warm seat and eat.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 Thank you. \u201cArtizea awkwardly thanked him.Cedric skipped the soup on his own and piled meat and mushrooms on a plate like a mountain. Then he poured melted cheese on it and put bread in a small space.Cedric sat down again when he returned with the plate. Artizea inadvertently opened her eyes wide. Isn\u2019t it too much?Cedric raised a fork with a calm face. And he asked plainly.\u201cIs the room okay?\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s warm. The bathroom was also very warm.\u201d\u201cI was worried that the rooms hadn\u2019t been used for long, but I\u2019m glad.\u201d\u201cIs this the room that Lord Cedric\u2019s mother used?\u201dArtizea asked carefully.\u201cSince this is the room used by the Grand Duchess for generations. Since the joining with the Empire, the Grand Duchess have rarely been northerners, so we must pay a lot of attention. If the Grand Duchess that came from a political marriage got sick in the cold, the problem can spread greatly.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s also true.\u201dArtizea ate a spoon of hot soup.The soup, which was boiled with a thick bone broth, was different from what was usually eaten in the capital. Her stomach quickly became hot.\u201cIs there anything wrong with the Grand Duchy so far? Three years is not a short time\u2026\u201d\u201cBecause we haven\u2019t received any reports in the meantime. And Evron Grand Duchy is not an area where there is much change, as long as there\u2019s no war with Karam.\u201d\u201cI see. The last war was five years ago. Lord Cedric was praised as a hero.\u201dCedric\u2019s face turned red.\u201cIt\u2019s a vain praise.\u201d\u201cYou rebuilt the Western Army, which was almost destroyed, and stopped the monster wave. You proved that it was not vain.\u201dArtizea smiled. However, Cedric looked serious.\u201cIt\u2019s not because I did well, but because there was the Knights of Evron by my side.\u201dAnd he sighed.\u201cThe population seldom increases, and in Winter, most of the trade stopped\u2026 and the industry fell behind. Even if it wasn\u2019t a big battle, there were many small disputes at the Thold Gate. Everything we do in this land is to be prepared for war.\u201dCedric shook his head.\u201cSo it\u2019s natural to be able to fight.\u201dThe Empire praised Evron by calling it Evron of the North.Grand Duke Evron officially held the rank after the emperor and empress.Except for the emperor, only Grand Duke Evron was able to take the knights and lead the knights. The sovereignty of the province was also fully guaranteed.Grand Duke Evron had the authority to collect taxes, convene troops, and draft supplies. Some of these powers were applied beyond the scope of the Grand Duke.But Cedric didn\u2019t think it was power or honor.All of that power was given to defend Karam. And too many sacrifices were made as a defense from Karam.It is not an honor to make such a sacrifice. There was no need for power that forced sacrifices.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Artizea thought of it and smiled a little.\u201cIf you had forced them to sacrifice with power, the Western Army would not have followed Lord Cedric. You said there were many people who wanted to follow you? If Lord Cedric accepted, the soldiers would have moved to barren land with their families on their backs. Do you think that\u2019s something anyone can do?\u201d\u201cYou know that? Oh, Freil said that.\u201d\u201cLord Cedric was treated as a hero not because of the size of your authority, but because you were able to give such faith and hope.\u201dIf he only thought of Evron, he would be right to accept it. It was a way to solve the population growth rate hitting the wall and the ever-threatening military power at once.But Cedric didn\u2019t.There was also an internal situation of Evron Grand Duchy. Rather, it was because he was concerned that civilians would see a lot of damage in the next monster wave by pulling out the trained troops from the west.\u201cThere are as many common people who believe in Lord Cedric as there are countless numbers of people in the armed forces. You have to trust yourself.\u201dCedric\u2019s face was brightly colored. Artizea twinkled.\u201cI\u2019m one of them.\u201dCedric turned away from Artizea.\u201cYou sometimes embarrass me too much.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t say anything that wasn\u2019t true.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201dThere were many times he had heard sincere praise.However, Artizea\u2019s words were unusually swaying in his heart.His chest swelled, just like when listening to the cheers of the soldiers who survived after a tough fight. He was proud of himself, proud of his opponents, and more than anything else, he was happy.He was embarrassed.Cedric shook his head once to shake off his feelings.\u201cNow let\u2019s stop talking about this.The food will get cold.\u201dCedric broke a piece of bread in half. The white pastry was torn and the steam fluttered.\u201cHere.\u201dHe handed the bread to Artizea.\u201cBe careful because it\u2019s hot.\u201d\u201cOh, thank you.\u201dArtizea accepted it.Her neck was tickling.She knew that Cedric liked to eat simply without following the etiquette.Even in the capital\u2019s mansion, he often eats after bringing food to his study or living room. Even on the ship, he arranged all the food on a table in a narrow space and ate it in no order.However, this felt overly intimate as they were sitting side by side in front of the fireplace.When Artizea emptied all the soup, Cedric took the empty bowl and put it on the trolley.And this time he handed her a plate and a fork with a little main dish.\u201cEat it all. Try for me.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll try my best.\u201dArtizea sighed. The soup was so thick that she felt like she was full.\u201cTo keep your body warm, you have to eat well. You have to get into that habit from now on.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think I can take it well\u2026..\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it tasteless?\u201d\u201cNot like that.\u201dArtizea knew best that it was because of a psychological reason. Even if she knew it, it was something she couldn\u2019t do.\u201cTry it a little.\u201dCedric watched her eat for a moment. And he ate slowly himself, in accord with the speed of her eating slowly.Then, at the end of Artizea\u2019s meal, he looked at the timing and opened his mouth.\u201cTomorrow\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI want to take a look at the financial situation of the estate tomorrow.\u201dThe two spoke almost simultaneously.Cedric flinched. Feeling as if she had intercepted his words, Artizea hesitated.\u201cOh, sorry.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s no big deal. I\u2019m going to the family tomb tomorrow. If you\u2019re okay, I was going to ask you to come with me.\u201d\u201cAh.\u201dArtizea groaned briefly.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s important, but I forgot it.\u201dShe wasn\u2019t even thinking about it.First of all, she was in the status of the Grand Duchess, so she was expected to pay a visit to the tomb. It was also out of courtesy to the vassals.\u201cDon\u2019t think so seriously. I don\u2019t mean to have a formal service. I came back after a long time, so at first I thought I\u2019d just go for a walk by myself.\u201dCedric stroked his cheek once to calm the heat in his face.It was for no special purpose, but he was simply saying to go out together. It took a lot of courage.\u201cI thought it would be better if we went together. It\u2019s not far away, so I think it will be a change of mood for you too\u2026\u2026. I want to show you something.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u2026\u201dArtizea slowly nodded her head.\u201cThen, are you giving your permission?\u201d\u201cAn expression like permission is too grand. I have time, so I have no intention of rejecting Lord Cedric\u2019s recommendation.\u201dArtizea replied.\u201cThen, we\u2019ll go to the family tomb in the morning and get a report together in the afternoon.\u201d\u201cYes, let\u2019s do that\u201dThen there was nothing to talk about, so the silence filled the room for a while.Cedric became terribly shy and awkward. His heels seemed to be stinging.He seemed to have something stuck in his throat. He had a lot to say, and he couldn\u2019t figure out what to say.Even when he returned from an extraordinary routine to his daily life, the world was still changed to him. When he returned to a familiar place, he realized more and more that he had changed.Eventually he couldn\u2019t sit there and stood up, feeling impatient.Artizea stood up after him. Cedric removed all the bowls and put them on the trolley.\u201cJust leave it. The maids will do it.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll leave it here.\u201dArtizea came out to the door to see him off.Cedric sighed. He doesn\u2019t want to be nervous, but he seldom does.\u201cTia.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cYes? What?\u201dUnable to understand why Cedric was saying that, Artizea blinked.Then Cedric laughed, making a sound in the wind.He still feels embarrassed.But after they talked, his mind was rather relaxed, so he could have a natural face.\u201cThere are many things. And for listening to my story.\u201dHis heart was so complicated that he couldn\u2019t put it all together.Cedric had never thought he would ever return with someone.He has never been alone.People like his family were always there.The vassals cherish him. Ansgar followed him to the battlefield. There were also many who risked his life to protect him.He was in a precarious line of fire, but a solid net of trust created by people in the same situation supported his feet.A loving heart cannot be hidden or created by lies. Although he lost his parents at an age he couldn\u2019t even remember their face, Cedric grew up in love as much as his parents gave him.This entire Evron Grand Duchy was his home. That\u2019s why he never thought he hated Evron even when he was held hostage in the capital as a child, or when he became a boy and suddenly fell under the imperial shield.So he never thought he was lonely, but when he came back with Artizea like this, he realised he was.The fact that her presence alone filled his heart. It was only then that he realized that there was an empty space in his life.For Artizea, it was a marriage that was unavoidable because of necessity. Moreover, it is limited to two years. He will be just a contract partner.But for him it was more than that.Even if it wasn\u2019t Artizea, he would one day marry someone. He would have had children and had a family.However, Cedric thought that if he had done so, he would not have been as full as he is now.He may have respected and cared for the marriage partner. She may be someone who thinks he\u2019s attractive as a man.But he would not have shared the respect and admiration as he now does with Artizea. He wouldn\u2019t even have thought he was happy to be with that partner.Cedric took a deep breath.\u201cThank you for choosing me.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re saying weird things. You know from the beginning that it\u2019s beneficial to each other.\u201dAs Artizea turned her head a little and looked down at the floor, she said consciously coldly.\u2018Don\u2019t speak too kindly to me.\u2019The words echoed in her mind in many ways.She herself was a person who did not deserve to hear such words. Even if he drew his sword and cut her neck right now.Cedric chose her, not herself.Cedric took her out of the dungeon. He got down on his knees and told her to make a plan for the world.He said he needed her first.So she decided to be the one he needed.This time she herself got down on her knees and decided to make a plan for him.That\u2019s it.Artizea wished Cedric could not hear the beating of her heart.Cedric laughed.\u201cI did.\u201dThe voice sounded happy.So Artizea momentarily forgot what conversation they were having.She didn\u2019t understand what Cedric was saying. Cedric reached out and grabbed Artizea\u2019s hand.The temperature of the two hands were different, causing Artizea\u2019s fingers to melt ticklishly.She couldn\u2019t figure out what would be better. She couldn\u2019t think of anything. She was short of breath.\u201cTia.\u201dArtizea paused, then barely raised her eyes and looked up at him. She then froze.His deep and profound eyes approached. Artizea stopped breathing.And she stared blankly as his dark lashes slither down, obscuring the sweet light in them.Something soft touched her lips.Artizea was astonished as if she had been beaten.Cedric grabbed her hand tightly. Artizea could not run away. It was the hand that was caught, but as if holding her whole body.She closed her eyes tight. Her whole body nerves become sensitive as if they were rushing to her lips.As her body heated up, she trembled with tension. The feeling of being held over her thin pajamas revived over her skin.The lips fell.Cedric gently patted her cheek. And he said sweetly.\u201cGood night.\u201dArtizea nodded her head dumbly. Cedric opened the door and went out.Thump.The door closed.Artizea barely breathed in her breath that stopped.It seemed that her blood was circulating in the veins all over her body. Her cheeks were burning hot.With her trembling legs, she stooped back and sat down on any chair.She couldn\u2019t figure out what had happened.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She is the Grand Duke\u2019s choice, the Marchioness of Rosan. Originally, our house, which is just a county in the region, is not worthy of serving her.][Mom.][Nevertheless, to make you her first lady-in-waiting and to keep you close is to show her blessing in consideration of the fact that our family has been loyal to the Grand Duchy.]Margaret seemed to be worried about her. She felt like she did not want to let Aubrey go.However if she did not send Aubrey, it would have been more suspicious.She just hopes that Artizea has as much compassion and understanding as she has wisdom.She wanted her to know that Aubrey was just a stupid kid, and that Jordyn was not disloyal.[The Grand Duchess is someone who you can tell is intelligent with just a few minutes of conversation. Aubrey, please don\u2019t mess with her with your immature behavior. Not only you will be in jeopardy, but it\u2019s also your family\u2019s honor.]Her eldest sister threatened to shave her head and send her to a convent if she did anything stupid.\u2018It\u2019s ridiculous to become the Grand Duchess. She\u2019s a prostitute\u2019s daughter.\u2019Aubrey thought.She doesn\u2019t know what made Cedric marry that woman. She heard rumors of a love marriage, but Aubrey didn\u2019t believe it.\u2018She\u2019s not even pretty.\u2019She was wondering how beautiful she was because she was the daughter of the mistress that the Emperor loved.However, by Aubrey\u2019s standard, Artizea fell short of her expectations.Her body was so thin that she couldn\u2019t find a healthy curve. Even considering that she had been on a ship for a long time, she looked shabby.Her skin was fair but it was as pale as if she were diseased.Cedric once said that he would marry someone worthy of Grand Duke Evron.And, in Aubrey\u2019s opinion, a sickly foreigner who couldn\u2019t get out of the room properly wasn\u2019t qualified to be the Grand Duchess.Either the Emperor\u2019s influence entered, or perhaps there is such a situation. She may have had some other insidious means. Her mother is the Emperor\u2019s mistress, so her daughter can do such a trick.But Cedric is a smart man. He may be obsessed by the fox-like trick now, but sooner or later he will wake up and escape.\u2018I\u2019m much better.\u2019Aubrey thought so.She can often see Cedric when she is the lady in waiting of the Grand Duchess. That was one good thing.She may have a chance to come to him someday. She thought so, and from the morning she got dressed up and came out.Aubrey exhaled a big sigh, straightened her posture, and stretched her chest. She was thinking she was pretty today.With a confident walk, Aubrey headed to Artizea\u2019s Tuvalet room.No one responded when she knocked on the door. Aubrey opened the door slightly with her hand.\u201cJordyn\u2019s Aubrey\u2026\u201d\u201cTry it on!\u201dAubrey\u2019s words were buried in the cheers bursting from the inside.\u201cIt\u2019s the coat that the master sent you in the morning. It\u2019s a little long, but I think you can wear it if you just fold the cuffs!\u201dSophie said happily.Artizea was buried in the fur of pure white.Sophie shortened the sleeve by basting it briefly.\u201cIsn\u2019t this originally men\u2019s clothing?\u201d\u201cWhat do you think? You look good. The sleeves are long, so I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll have to wear gloves. Even if you wear gloves, this might be better because your hands won\u2019t get cold.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think even the Marquisate has such precious marten fur?\u201dAubrey was astonished.The sable coat was Cedric\u2019s.When three white martens with no fur of different color mixed together were found at once, the adults were making a fuss, saying it was auspicious.Cedric shot and caught them without a scratch. A simple celebration was also given.It was such a valuable item.After seeing Aubrey, Rize asked with a cold attitude.\u201cWhat are you doing, Miss Jordyn?\u201dAubrey was furious by the rude maid. But before she shouted, Artizea turned over.\u201cStop it, Rize. Come in, Aubrey.\u201dThe voice was calm and dignified.The white face looked smaller because the coat she was wearing was large.Aubrey felt defeated and bit her lower lip.\u201cGreetings Your Grace Grand Duchess\u2026.\u201dRecalling Margaret\u2019s stern warning, Aubrey effortlessly bowed her head to greet Artizea.\u201cYes, I think you must have heard from Margaret.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dArtizea turned her head back from the mirror to Aubrey.Originally she wanted to properly check Aubrey and give lessons. But now she didn\u2019t feel like it. She didn\u2019t even have that spirit.Last night she couldn\u2019t sleep until dawn. Yesterday\u2019s kiss didn\u2019t leave her mind.At best, he only touched her slightly. Rather, holding his hand to dance was a much deeper contact.However, the sense of that moment has revived. It is unlikely that any one of it will be forgotten in memory, including a friendly look, a rough hand, and a light trembling breath.It seemed that her body was floating in the air.Aubrey, who thought she had been ignored by Artizea, trembled.The mistress lost her mind to give a lesson to Aubrey, but the maids were different. Alice held a jewelry box in Aubrey\u2019s hand.\u201cWhat?\u201dThinking that the maid dared to pass her goods, Aubrey was angry. Alice smiled lightly.\u201cThis is the original role of a lady-in-waiting, Miss Aubrey. Until now, I was holding it because the Madam didn\u2019t have lady-in-waiting, but now Miss Aubrey has to do it.\u201dThere was nothing she could forgive, from the rudeness of calling her name to the cheeky expression.However, Aubrey could not overturn the Grand Duchess\u2019 jewelry box.Paula, the new maid, gathered Artizea\u2019s hair to one side and braided it.Artizea looked in the mirror.She wondered if the under eyes were too dim. It was the first time that she wondered if her cheeks were too slim and her cheekbones came out.She wanted to look pretty.Artizea recalled the early summer days.She returned from a long, dire future, and that\u2019s the day she went to see Cedric.For the first time then she looked straight in the mirror. Sophie would make her pretty, so she told her so.Thinking if he liked her hair\u2026.. she felt some kind of anxiety and guilt.Perhaps at that time, she was already predicting the feelings of today.Knock, knock.They heard a knock on the door.\u201cOh, he must have come!\u201dRize shouted with a voice twice as bright as usual and ran to open the door.Cedric made eye contact with Rize and smiled.\u201cWhat about Tia?\u201d\u201cShe is almost ready.\u201dRize blushed her face as if she was shy and cleared the way.Artizea glanced through the mirror and she saw him. She took a deep breath and turned.She thought she wished she wasn\u2019t too shivering. She thought her cheeks shouldn\u2019t be red.\u201cDid you sleep well?\u201d\u201cYes. I slept in a bed that does not shake after a long time.\u201dThe voice came out as calmly as she thought.\u201cIs the weather outside a lot colder? I have a winter coat, too\u2026 They sent me Cedric\u2019s clothes. It must be very precious fur\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s precious, that\u2019s why you wear it. It\u2019s a waste to wear when I\u2019m active, so I can\u2019t wear it anyway. Even though I told Ansgar to save it, Ansgar made it as clothes, so it hasn\u2019t ever left the closet.\u201d\u201cBut it looks like I\u2019m covered in a blanket\u2026\u201dSophie and Alice both opened their mouths in surprise. Because there needs to be someone else who would say no.Cedric shook his head.\u201cIt suits you very well as I thought.\u201d\u201c\u2026..\u201dArtizea bowed her head without saying a word.Paula consciously made a cheerful voice.\u201cIt was time to choose a headdress.\u201dPaula turned to Aubrey. Aubrey was startled.Cedric seemed to notice that Aubrey was there only then.\u201cAha, you are Tia\u2019s first lady-in-waiting.\u201d\u201cYour, Your Grace.\u201dAubrey couldn\u2019t speak like before.Cedric\u2019s face was still sweet, but he felt like a completely different person.Aubrey didn\u2019t know this face. Even with the same soft face, the face of a man who treats a woman and the face of an adult who treats a child were completely different in the color of the emotions in them.He never had a face like that when he took her young hand and took her to her mother.\u201cTia\u2019s body is weak and she gets sensitive to cold, so please take good care of her. It\u2019s probably different from being around someone who\u2019s familiar with this place.\u201d\u201cYour Grace\u2026.\u201dAubrey called him in a trembling voice. Tears welled up.Cedric tilted his head strangely. It was because he hadn\u2019t noticed why she did that.\u201cPaula. Anything is fine.\u201dPaula took a blue velvet ribbon and tied a knot at the end of her hair.Her shiny white blonde and the color of the ribbon dangling over her pure white coat were accentuated.Cedric stroked the corner of his mouth once. He took a small sigh.Artizea looked up at Cedric gently.A smile soon returned to Cedric\u2019s face, after a brief resignation.\u201cShall we go?\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019m ready.\u201dArtizea replied. And she told Aubrey.\u201cAubrey, I\u2019ll leave my jewel to you in the future. Alice, please tell Aubrey the original place.\u201dAubrey hesitated and left.Cedric tapped her shoulder with his palm, as she seemed somewhat stiff. It was a consolation.Aubrey became more angry and bowed her head. She felt like tears were coming.Cedric reached out to Artizea. Artizea hesitated, then she put her hand on his palm.The two slowly stepped outside. The maids who would not come as they went out then greeted them from inside the Tuvalet room.When the listeners disappeared, Artizea asked.\u201cWhat\u2019s bothering you so much?\u201d\u201cMe?\u201d\u201cYes, you have a look on your face.\u201dThere was nothing to say. Was it Aubrey\u2019s fault? She thought for a moment, but she didn\u2019t think Cedric was giving Aubrey an eye.Cedric sighed a little.\u201cNo big deal. I think you and Aubrey\u2026\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cI remember you two being of similar age. I just realized it because it didn\u2019t feel that way at all.\u201dCedric turned his head to the other side. It was a shameless face.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

If there is something like the tomb of the family in the castle, there would be problems with the space, but there is one more place to be protected in case of emergency.\u201d\u201cIf it was outside, it\u2019ll be even more fragile.\u201d\u201cIt is said that it was built outside the castle with the intent of giving it up quickly. If it is inside the castle, even if you say you don\u2019t have to protect it, you can\u2019t do that from the standpoint of your vassals.\u201dThat said, it cannot be built anywhere and left unattended.So, it was built on the mountain closest to the stronghold.Since the mountain was also a military hub, the Grand Duchy built a defensive facility there. And he put the military in place.Cedric asked.\u201cBut, isn\u2019t it cold?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not cold.\u201dArtizea shrugged her shoulders a little.It is still fall weather by the Evron standards, and if it were in the capital, it would be considered to be mild winter weather. It wasn\u2019t cold enough to wear a marten coat like this.Rather, because she was in Cedric\u2019s arms, she felt hot. She couldn\u2019t even tell if she was speaking properly.She was told that they were going out casually. But she didn\u2019t think he would come out with a carriage.[You have to climb the mountain. There is no paved way for a carriage to go through. I thought you\u2019d know\u2026]The butler said with a sorry expression on his face.During the time when the preceding Grand Duchess was alive, the dirt roads were nicely paved, but in the past twenty years or so, no one had to go in a carriage to the mausoleum.The road got rough.[Sorry. I didn\u2019t think much.][No. We can ride a horse right?]Artizea asked. Both the butler and Cedric had ambiguous looks on their faces.The reason was found after a while.There were only huge horses in the stables, which were enormous in height and in their amount of hair. In the first place, the horse breed is different from the passenger horse in the capital.[Are you good at riding horses?]Cedric asked. Artizea had no choice but to shake her head.Anyway, she was far from using her body. She knew how to ride a horse, but she was only able to sit on a gentle path and stroll.Cedric smiled with a somewhat pleasant face.[Let\u2019s ride together.][What?]Artizea was confused.[Are you troubled?][No, not that. No, but.]Soon, a black horse that had been gently combed came out.Cedric held Artizea and placed her on the horse. And he carefully climbed on its back.She\u2019s never ridden a horse like this before, but there was no time to be surprised or scared.It was because she was put in a position that had her held between his arms.The feeling of Cedric\u2019s touch on her back and hearing the sound of his heart beat, made Artizea hold her breath.There was a memory in this sense.\u2018Ah\u2026.\u2019It was when she was carried around the empire by Cedric on a horse after losing all her limbs.She had no idea at the time.Her incompetent body hurt without ceasing. Everything that came through the five senses put her mind in pain.Even then there was this warmth. She didn\u2019t feel the warmth, but it was definitely there.Being trapped in Cedric\u2019s arms was like a punishment.And now\u2026Artizea closed her eyes tightly and forced her to cut off her thoughts.A cold wind hit her face.As they ran the plain for about 40 minutes, they entered the mountain trail. Cedric easily handled the horse and ran through the mountain path. It was stable, as if nothing took place.As they climbed the mountain, they saw a fence blocking the road. Soldiers standing guard saw Cedric and quickly cleared the fence.The knight in charge of the defense facility came out and gave a military salute.\u201cWelcome, Your Grace, Grand Duke. I have been waiting for your call in the morning.\u201d\u201cI just came to visit, so don\u2019t worry and go back to your original duty.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe knight replied briefly and raised the salute again.Soldiers closed the fence from behind.Some soldiers whispered, but not enough to bother. The knights were wearing a happy smile.It was a good idea for the Grand Duchess to ride with Cedric\u2019s horse. If it weren\u2019t for their duty now, they would have rushed and surrounded.Artizea opened her eyes and looked around her.The first thing that caught her eye was the stone tower. Likewise, there were soldiers\u2019 quarters and arsenals built of solid bricks.\u201cWhat about the tomb?\u201d\u201cThis way.\u201dCedric paused in front of a building that looked like a small chapel.Cedric opened the bag on the saddle of his horse. Four flowers made of silk appeared as if prepared in advance. He handed it over to Artizea.And he himself lifted a lamp.Cedric took the lead and went to the chapel.The chapel had only a large stone staircase pierced below. It looked like a chapel, but it was actually a wall covering the stone steps.\u201cIs the tomb in the basement?\u201d\u201cIn case, the building is destroyed and the entrance is blocked. It is not an object to be protected first, but it is also a matter of not letting the tomb be dug.\u201d\u201cIf someone collapses it right now, will we be buried alive?\u201dCedric laughed out loud.\u201cIt\u2019s a useless worry.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not worried about it. Though I\u2019d like you to bring an attendant next time.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not a building that\u2019s exposed outside. It\u2019s in a military building.\u201d\u201cDo you thoroughly believe in all the knights and soldiers in the military and even their families?\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cNo, of course, you believe because they are the citizens of the Grand Duchy \u2026\u2026\u201dArtizea sighed.\u201cPeople become betrayers for very unforeseen reasons. Until now, you\u2019ve only been as Grand Duke Evron, so it would have been okay.\u201d\u201cThe port and the Elia side are certainly not managed, but we can know and understand who goes to and from the military and stronghold.\u201d\u201cI hope you understand my worries a little. Be careful in the future. It is enough to have someone you trust outside to guard.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dCedric made a bitter smile.\u201cI don\u2019t know if this will help you get rid of your anxiety, but it\u2019s only the head of the army that knows how to take this building down at once. And that friend lost one arm for me.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not suspicious of the Evron Knights. I was talking about the general theory.\u201d\u201cI know. I don\u2019t misunderstand. Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll be careful in the future.\u201dCedric said so.Cedric\u2019s parents were laid side by side in the outermost room.Two sarcophagi were enshrined in a stone altar. In front of it, a carved slate was placed to cover the deceased\u2019s coffin from being directly seen.And each was engraved on the slate like this.<<Leobrick of Evron, a faithful husband and servant, lies asleep here>><<Floella of Krates and Evron, May you be in peace forever until the day you return.>>Cedric moved and lit the candlesticks on the left and right of the altar. And he cleared the artificial flowers in front of the tombstone.The old silk flowers would have been originally white. But now it has turned yellow. It looked old enough to crumble.\u201cIt\u2019s been 3 years.\u201dAs he made excuses, he received two new silk flowers from Artizea and laid them down on the altar.Artizea was still behind him.She had never missed the dead, so she could not speak words of consolation. She didn\u2019t think she could dare say consolation.Cedric called her with his hand.\u201cI want you to give a flower too.\u201d\u201cCan I do that?\u201dTwo silk flowers remained in Artizea\u2019s hand. She thought it was a flower for Cedric to dedicate to another tomb.\u201cI heard my mother liked flowers. She will be happy.\u201dArtizea carefully approached the altar. She then got down on her knees and put the flowers down.\u201cThe day will come when you will return.\u201dArtizea said so in a whispering low voice. Cedric shook his head.\u201cI never thought I should take my mother to the capital. Because the dead are dead. She is gone, she will already be in peace.\u201d\u201cLord Cedric.\u201d\u201cThe important thing is on the living side. I know you can\u2019t live right if you have a grudge, Tia.\u201dCedric spoke as if confessing.\u201cI think I should live with that much value, even for those who threw their lives for me. And being obsessed with revenge for the deceased would not be living for a better world, if not meaningless.\u201dArtizea looked at him in a strange mood.Artizea knows well that Cedric\u2019s words are sincere and true.However, whenever she saw his right mind like this, she couldn\u2019t help but get caught up in the feeling of seeing something unrealistic.Artizea did not know how to pay tribute. She couldn\u2019t imagine her willingness to stand up and face the future.She had already given up when Miraila died. If there is a heart closest to her memory she felt it for Lysia.But when Lysia died, Artizea was in despair, foreshadowing a miserable end. It was then that she disbanded the intelligence organization and chose seclusion.She gave up the empire.***After finishing the offering and coming out of the tomb, Cedric led Artizea to the tower.\u201cIt\u2019s a watchtower. If you climb to the top, you can see the gateway to the Thold Mountains.\u201dArtizea rolled up the hem of her skirt and grabbed Cedric\u2019s hand and climbed the spiral staircase.The guard at the top of the tower was startled and gave a military salute. Cedric answered him and said.\u201cThe telescope.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe watchman handed the telescope he had to Cedric.The wind blew like crazy. The wind broke through her coat, and Artizea shuddered.The tower was higher than she thought.The surrounding area was low and it was the only tower on top of the mountain. As Cedric said, she could see the surrounding terrain at a glance.Holding a telescope, Artizea looked around.Then she saw people plowing in a valley beyond the Thold Gate, the northern border.\u201cLord Cedric, that\u2019s\u2026.\u201dCedric nodded as Artizea mumbled in the exact direction.\u201cThat\u2019s right. I was going to show you that.\u201d\u201cAre they nomads? Why are they there\u2026.\u201d\u201cWe are researching whether it is possible to grow Karam crops.\u201dArtizea swallowed her breath.\u201cIf the temple finds out, they will say that you are researching the devil\u2019s crop. They may say that you\u2019re colluding with Karam.\u201d\u201cYes. That\u2019s why I\u2019m doing it beyond the Thold Gate.\u201dCedric replied.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 62": "Chapter 62Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 62Proofreader: xoxomonamiOn the way back, her mind was complicated and she couldn\u2019t afford to worry about Cedric.As soon as Artizea returned to the stronghold, she went straight to Cedric\u2019s office.She then looked at the entire map of the Grand Duchy hanging in the office for a long time. On the map, not only was Evron Grand Duchy on there, but even beyond the Thold Mountains in detail.\u201cWhen did you start the research project?\u201d\u201cSince I inherited the title. Even before that, some of the young people planted and harvested in small fields. However, they had never tried to plant and cultivate in a large field.\u201d\u201cTo be honest, I\u2019d like to tell you that it\u2019s time to stop. Just making a field beyond the Thold Gate is not enough of an excuse. Karam is an enemy of the country. The temple calls it a race of demons.\u201d\u201cNo one knows how terrifying Karam is better than Evron.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not enough. Lord Cedric.\u201dArtizea said.\u201cThis is not really a problem with Karam, it is a political problem within the Empire. If you get caught, there will definitely be a person who will frame you for having a relationship with Karam.\u201d\u201cBut there are very few crops that could be food while still being able to grow in the middle of the winter on this land. For now, I think it\u2019s really the only possibility to solve the food problem.\u201dCedric said.The food self-sufficiency rate of the Evron Grand Duchy was less than 30%.That is why, in the past, Evron Grand Duchy was subjugated to the Krates Empire. They are relying heavily on supplies from the Imperial government.All of the problems of Evron Grand Duchy come from lack of food.The population cannot grow because of lack of food. Since the population is small, the industry cannot develop.As the industry cannot develop, the standard of living of the common people fell behind. So, there was a vicious cycle in which productivity fell and food was scarce again.In addition, the Imperial family used food supplies as a bargaining chip to shake the Grand Duchy.The Evron Grand Duchy was not poor. There was honor, and there was wealth worthy of it.However, enriching the entire territory is quite different from wearing fine clothes and decorating furniture with gold leaf within a family.In case of emergency, even if you have money, it is of no use.Artizea looked at Cedric.\u201cIf the problem is to receive food in a stable manner, how about buying farmland in the south?\u201d\u201cStable supply is, of course, an important issue. But Tia, rather than that, we need crops that can be grown by our people.\u201d\u201cIf Cedric becomes the Emperor, it will all be solved. This task is very risky and inefficient. Even if the cultivation method is established, it will still be hidden and raised.\u201d\u201cThis land also needs a future.\u201dCedric said so.\u201cIf I really get to the position you\u2019re talking about, the supply problem will be solved, but if you get supply from the mainland, then, in the end, military supplies come first.\u201d\u201cLord Cedric.\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t be rich with food rations forever. And after I die, what will happen?\u201dCedric looked at the map and said.\u201cBefore becoming a part of the empire, people in this region said that war itself was a business. Because there was no industry to make a living. What\u2019s the difference now? We are rationed food in exchange for war with Karam.\u201d\u201cLord Cedric \u2026.\u201d\u201cWe need to get rid of the situation of getting supplies. Only by raising food self-sufficiency and activating trade can we escape the situation.\u201d\u201c\u2026 would you rather give up part of the Grand Duchy?\u201dArtizea asked, even though she knew he loved the land.It was also something she could say because she thought Cedric would not answer emotionally.Artizea marked the position by placing a pin halfway between the Grand Duchy.\u201cHonestly, the productivity of this area is too low. Even if the fortress of Thold Gate is maintained due to its topographical advantage, it is not necessary to form a town up to this point.\u201d\u201cTia.\u201d\u201cIf the population is concentrated in the south, the density of the population will increase and the productivity will increase accordingly. It will be advantageous to form an industry. And even better than that, it is to move all the common people to the south of the Elia Wall and abandon the north. Think about it.\u201dCedric smiled lightly.\u201cYou\u2019re testing me again.\u201d\u201cIt won\u2019t be easy in reality. I know.\u201dArtizea said.\u201cBut from a purely practical point of view, yes. If Lord Cedric takes over the Imperial family, the Grand Duchy will be virtually gone. No one can claim the right to this land. The history of the Grand Duchy remains as a record. If you decide to wait, it\u2019s not impossible.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t do that. The history of the family is not a problem, but the possibility of peace with Karam disappears.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dArtizea opened her eyes wide. Cedric gave a short glance.\u201cWe\u2019ve been in a scuffle for over two hundred years. It\u2019s unimaginable for the people of the mainland, but exchanges are happening in their own way. In fact, Evron Grand Duchy is geographically closer to Karam than to the mainland of the Empire.\u201dThe north is barren. There are times when extreme cold strikes so that it is impossible to live exclusively.At that time, there were choices to exchange here and there.\u201cIt has become possible to communicate at a simple level. Rarely, there are mixed races. That\u2019s why the gap between wars is getting longer.\u201dCedric said.\u201cThe day will come when the war will cease and Evron Grand Duchy can act as a buffer zone. I want to leave that possibility.\u201d\u201cIs that what you want to do after Lord Cedric becomes the Emperor?\u201d\u201cWell, it is.\u201dCedric\u2019s face turned a little red.\u201cAnd so for Evron Grand Duchy. I want Evron to have the power to develop itself.\u201dHaving said that, he spoke as if making excuses.\u201cI couldn\u2019t take the first step, so I only had big dreams.\u201d\u201cNo\u2026.. \u201cArtizea bit her lower lip and fell into thoughts.The future Cedric sees is much farther away than he is, and his vision is much higher.She realized it anew.Cedric said.\u201cI\u2019ve shown this to you, partly because I have nothing to hide from you, but also because I need advice. Tia, you said you were going to move for me?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThen please help me.\u201dArtizea took a deep breath.It will soon be half a year since she\u2019s returned from the past and met him again.This was the first time Cedric asked for anything.It wasn\u2019t until the first contract, when she was out of Milaira\u2019s hands and Cedric had his Western Army\u2019s ceremony that he had shown his will for.Artizea closed her eyes for a moment.The coordinator should fulfill the will of the master, and not try to fit the master into her frame.[Marchioness of Rosan, do you see your judgment as absolute and Lawrence\u2019s judgment not? If so, it would be natural that you were ousted.]Cedric had said that in the past. Cedric was right. She didn\u2019t believe much in Lawrence\u2019s judgment.She did everything for Lawrence, but Lawrence wasn\u2019t a reliable person. It is even doubtful whether there is a philosophy for governance from the beginning.But Cedric is different.\u2018Because you are looking up.\u2019What he wants is not the seat of power itself, but what he can do on the spot.So just because it\u2019s her role to put Cedric in power, she shouldn\u2019t hurt his will.If this was what he wanted to do as an Emperor, then it was even more necessary.Her heart pounded. She was excited.It was the first time that there was a person in front of her who she could completely believe and follow.\u201cI wanted to see the Grand Duchy\u2019s financial situation to fill the warehouse.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s important.\u201dCedric answered plainly. Artizea said.\u201cThen I\u2019ll try to use my hand on grain prices.\u201d\u201cTia.\u201dCedric\u2019s voice was mixed with criticism.\u201cSupporting Grand Duke Roygar is the focus of all circles and the great landowners of the fertile eastern region. They are largely involved in the requisition of supplies to the north.\u201dBy average, there was a large amount of grain produced in the vast plains of the western region.However, in the West, due to the monster wave, the annual yield varied greatly.Nobles and landlords preferred to own land in the east rather than in the west. The west was run mainly by self-employed people.The Imperial Family requisitioned the eastern landlords to compel grain.Supplies sent to the north are the cost to protect the empire from Karam.Nobody liked it. However, no one could reject it. Refusal was seen as a connection with Karam.\u201cIf the price of the grain goes up, His Majesty will entrust the work to Grand Duke Roygar to facilitate the requisition, but Grand Duke Roygar is greedy, so it would be unfair to send the increased grain to the north for free.\u201dSo Artizea touched it.She had pirates pillage trade ships that exported grain to the southern kingdoms over the years.At the same time, she freed the Marquisate of Rosan\u2019s fortune and she bought a large amount of grain, and all the grain thus obtained was dumped into the sea.There were dozens of fires in the West.Grain prices skyrocketed. As expected, the Emperor entrusted Grand Duke Roygar with supplies to the north.Just in time, in the southern part of the Eimel Kingdom, in order to meet the lack of wheat, they bribed Grand Duke Roygar and bought the requisitioned grain at a high price.This was because the calculations were well-established for Grand Duke Roygar.It was autumn. After a month or two, the empty warehouse could be refilled with freshly harvested wheat.He then thought that he could go and send supplies.But that year, Karam went South on a massive scale. Due to hunger, Evron was unable to protect the Thold Gate.Karam almost broke through to the Elia Wall.Indeed, it was the first time in a long time that the Empire was appalled.The war ended within the winter of that year thanks to the success of Cedric, who defended his stronghold, and succeeded in killing the king of Karam.However, Grand Duke Roygar took responsibility for the defeat. In the meantime, a secret agreement with the Eimel Kingdom was revealed.Artizea was involved in the proposal of the agreement in the Eimel Kingdom. The agreement had been in her hands from the beginning.Grand Duke Roygar was decapitated for treason.She intended to use the same trick. Because it was a proven method.But war had to be avoided. She already knew the year when the war would break out, so she could do that. In any case, a secret agreement is enough to cut the head of Grand Duke Roygar.And in order to prevent Evron Grand Duchy from starvation, she planned to fill the warehouse in advance.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

But there\u2019s no way you can do that. If you put your hands on the price of grain, it\u2019s not about the supply to the north, it\u2019s going to hurt the lives of the entire empire.\u201d\u201cYes, I know.\u201dArtizea replied.\u201cTo be honest, I think the priority is to bring down those who ruin people\u2019s livelihood.\u201d\u201cTia.\u201d\u201cThe Empire occupies all the good lands that people can live in. The productive power is enormous and the industry is developed. The reason that people\u2019s livelihood is impoverished is because the ruling class is exploiting it. So even by cleaning them up, the Empire will soon come back to life.\u201dIt is a country with such potential.So the faster you pull them down, the better.\u201cIf you count people\u2019s lives as the total amount of happiness, my method is correct.\u201d\u201cIf you think so, then why do you ask me for an opinion?\u201d\u201cWhen I look at Lord Cedric, I think it\u2019s wrong.\u201dArtizea muttered.\u201cI\u2019m not a ruler. I\u2019m ashamed, because I just understand the moral rules with my head.\u201dSo she said.It didn\u2019t mean that Cedric wouldn\u2019t use it just because it\u2019s a method he hates. His ideals were so high that he was worried that he could realize this kind of work.And she was actually guessing the answer. She just needed conviction.\u201cTia.\u201dCedric lowered his head and looked into her eyes.\u201cI understand your logic. I think it\u2019s a judgment you can make.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026. \u201c\u201cBut once you lose your morality, you cannot get it back. You can lose your honor, but you cannot lose your morality.\u201dCedric gave her a smile instead of being angry with her.Then, carefully reaching out his hand, he swept the strands of her hair that had flowed down into Artizea\u2019s ear.\u201cYou are a smart person. You can come up with a better way than that.\u201dArtizea couldn\u2019t help but nod her head.It was then.Knock, knock.There was a knock on the door.\u201cCome in.\u201dCedric stepped out of Artizea\u2019s side with light movements and went to the other seat.\u201cExcuse me. I don\u2019t know why you called me\u2026\u201dIt was a middle-aged woman who opened the door. Artizea noticed that the woman was a little surprised to see her in the office.But she quickly realized who she was. The woman politely knelt down on one knee to greet Artizea.\u201cI\u2019m Hannah. It\u2019s an honor to meet you, Your Grace.\u201d\u201cHannah is in charge of the town north of Thold. I called this time to get a report.\u201dHannah couldn\u2019t hide her surprise at Cedric\u2019s words.The work on the Karam crop was the greatest secret of the Evron Great Duchy.But Cedric said,\u201cYou don\u2019t have to hide anything from the Grand Duchess. Think of her in the same way you think of me and report on the Karam crop.\u201dHannah soon resolved her surprise. She then put down the documents she brought in front of Artizea.Artizea briefly turned the papers over without a word.\u201cThe only thing I can tell for sure is that you need a proper drainage system. It can withstand the cold, but it can grow better in milder climates.\u201d\u201cYes. The harvest can be done once in early spring and autumn, and the harvest in the fall is quite large. But it may be because of poor care during the winter. In winter it is almost impossible to dig frozen ground by manpower.\u201d\u201cWhat about the plough?\u201d\u201cIt is said that horses are better than humans, but horses are also dangerous on a snowy or windy day. Only those who are mixed-race Karam can work little by little. If it is from the south of the Grand Duchy, it is easy to harvest twice a year.\u201dArtizea read all the reports that were not many.And she covered it and looked at Cedric.\u201cI think it would be better to stop this once again. Again, the efficiency is too low.\u201dAnyway, this research will fail anyway. If successful, Artizea would have known.Perhaps the reason for the failure was that during that war, which decapitated Grand Duke Roygar\u2019s neck, Evron Grand Duchy completely lost its power to make new attempts.\u201cI don\u2019t mean to give up. Let\u2019s do it in a less dangerous way.\u201d\u201cIs there a way?\u201dCedric\u2019s eyes sparkled.\u201cLet\u2019s wash the source of the seeds first. We make it as crops found in the northwestern region.\u201dArtizea pulled out all the pins on the map. Then she put a pin in another point. It is the end of the western border where the monster wave begins.\u201cThe border line with the Evron Grand Duchy was blocked by Elia Wall, but the western end of the monster habitat is directly connected to the north, right? In this way, it is also connected with Karam.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not a place where people can live.\u201d\u201cYes, but when there is a monster wave, it often happens that the body of the monster coming down there comes with plants or insects.\u201dCedric leaned out his body with a positive attitude.\u201cI know a few people I can trust who are native of the West.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s perfect.\u201dArtizea smiled.\u201cIt would be much better to study farming methods there.\u201dShe shook the document.\u201cThe seeds are kept strictly, but all of these records are burned. I hope we get rid of the town north of Thold as soon as possible.\u201d\u201cYou mean to remove the trace?\u201d\u201cYes, completely.\u201dHannah swallowed. Artizea looked back at her.\u201cIf there is any other reason not to get rid of the village, tell me now.\u201d\u201cNo. I\u2019ve always been thinking that it would be better to do it in the south. It\u2019s just because there\u2019s no place for mixed race people to go\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to get Aaron to find them a suitable job. We can\u2019t ignore those who have worked so far.\u201dCedric said.\u201cCan you make sure the words don\u2019t flow out?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry. That\u2019s my job.\u201d\u201cThen, this is all about doing things that didn\u2019t exist.\u201dArtizea looked at Hannah once and then again at Cedric.\u201cForget the name of the Karam crop completely. The new name will be given to the western farmers. And next year, when a new western harvest is made, I will put it on the altar of the Temple.\u201d\u201cAt the altar?\u201d\u201cYes, since the work of consecrating newly improved seeds is done every year. Once consecrated, then, even if it turns out that they are also in Karam, they will not be said that it is a devil\u2019s crop.\u201d\u201cIs it possible? They don\u2019t just put anything on the altar of the Great Temple.\u201d\u201cIn the mainland, there\u2019s nothing that money can\u2019t do.\u201dCedric stroked his chin, thinking.\u201cI think it\u2019s possible enough. It\u2019s an important job, so would you take care of it yourself?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cHowever, even if it receives the consecration of the temple, I am worried about how His Majesty will react.\u201dFood is the most powerful weapon that controls Evron. There was no way the Emperor would like it.\u201cIf it starts in the West, it\u2019s over in no time.There is no reason to reject the new crop that the farmer has found. Even His Majesty cannot deny the temple altar.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s also true. It\u2019s also something we have to go through anyway.\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s still possible, it\u2019s better to hide it until you\u2019re ready enough.\u201dArtizea said, pondering.\u201cLet\u2019s make a grain merchant union in the West.\u201dCedric looked at her with her puzzled face. Artizea replied.\u201cIn the summer, I bought a small and medium-sized grain dealer under a borrowed name. There are roughly 70 of them. This is enough to lead public opinion and make a union.\u201d\u201cTia, did you really intend to carry out the manipulation of the grain?\u201d\u201cThanks to Cedric stopping the Monster Wave last year, there are no burnt warehouses, or farmland, and grain prices have stabilized. If you buy it, I just thought it was for now.\u201dArtizea lied.\u201cThat\u2019s why you make an excuse to bribe the temple and spread new crops. But if you simply have the upper ranks, you wouldn\u2019t know that if you make such a coalition and move, there is a lot of chance to get caught by His Majesty.\u201d\u201cEven so, there will be no excuses to stop it. In case they can stop the transportation and take the warehouse, I think they will be relatively generous.\u201dIf the Emperor tries to stop it, he will face the top forces, led by Grand Duke Roygar. Something they hate most is when the aristocrats are prevented from expanding their business.\u2018It\u2019s okay to hold hands temporarily.\u2019The plan to dismiss Roygar with this was completely gone.However, she can plan other things later. As Cedric said, she, herself, would have been able to come up with better strategies.\u201cI don\u2019t know much about military affairs, and I don\u2019t know much more about the Evron Grand Duchy. But I can support you so that you don\u2019t worry about your back. So do what Lord Cedric wanted to do as much as you can.\u201dLuckily, the Marquisate of Rosan is wealthy, it wasn\u2019t enough to enrich Evron Grand Duchy, but it was enough to make a difference.She thought it was the best course of action.Cedric crept down the corners of his mouth. He was grateful, but he had no idea how to accept it.\u201cNo. You\u2019ve only barely gotten the Marquisate back. You have to keep it. I\u2019ll be grateful for the intention. It\u2019s enough to lend your hand and wisdom.\u201d\u201cIf I were Count Jordyn, would you have objected to the idea of using his private property?\u201dCedric said perplexedly.\u201cIt is different from that.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the same. What\u2019s different about using what I have for someone I\u2019ve decided to devote my whole life to?\u201dCedric\u2019s face hardened for a moment.Then, from his neck, a new red color began to appear, and his entire face finally turned red. Cedric eventually covered his face with his palm.Artizea hesitated, not understanding why he did that.Then, Hannah and her eyes met. She was smiling with a lukewarm face.Artizea looked back at the words that she had said. And her face turned red as she came to her senses.Cedric took her hand.\u201cI know that\u2019s not what you meant. I\u2019m not misunderstanding, so just sit down. Isn\u2019t the report not over yet?\u201dHe said so, but of course there were some who misunderstood.Hannah cleaned up the scattered documents.\u201cI don\u2019t dare to disturb you. I\u2019ll go back. Please call me anytime you need anything.\u201dThen she left the office.The door is closed.Artizea felt like sitting on a thorny cushion. She said something without knowing what to do.\u201cI\u2019m sorry to have caused you a strange misunderstanding\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not a complete misunderstanding.\u201dCedric said without letting go of her hand. Artizea pulled out her hand.She said, in a cracked voice, as she wrapped her left hand in the heat of her other hand.\u201cI\u2019ll talk about the rest later. I\u2019m\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t go.\u201dCedric took her hand again.Artizea stumbled with dizziness. She let Cedric pull her hand and fall towards him.\u201cStay still. You can\u2019t look at my face right now.\u201dArtizea held her breath. Cedric hugged her with his arms and pressed his lips to the crown of her head.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

What if they hear it at the temple?\u201dThe noble ladies shouted and covered their mouths with fans.\u201cHe\u2019s not a prophet, but a necromancer. I heard that he\u2019s from the slums\u2026\u201d\u201cHe predicted that the doors of the Empress\u2019 Palace would open?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not a prophecy. There was once a seance held at Grayson Viscounty, and the ghost that appeared there was that of a woman of the noblest status that decided the future emperor.\u201d\u201cAh, that\u2019s what anyone can say. I don\u2019t know that Sir Lawrence\u2019s qualifications will depend primarily on Her Majesty\u2019s will.\u201d\u201cBut only then, no one could have imagined that Her Majesty would really open the doors of the Empress\u2019s Palace and come out.\u201d\u201cOf course it will. Grand Duke Evron, of course, as a relative of hers, he sometimes met Her Majesty. Her attendance at the wedding is amazing, even so\u2026\u201dThe noble ladies said that it was amazing to have used Miraila\u2019s daughter as her lady-in-waiting and stood in as the mother.\u201cShe also gave her a pure gold orb. It happens when a lady-in-waiting doesn\u2019t have a mother, but\u2026.\u201d\u201cDo you understand a little about Her Majesty\u2019s feelings? Hasn\u2019t the Marchioness of Rosan boasted of her son?\u201d\u201cThe young ladies these days don\u2019t know, but before the Empress, she used to say that the mother who lost the Crown Prince and her children in a row doesn\u2019t deserve to live, so that she brought in Sir Lawrence with her.\u201d\u201cBy the way, her daughter has become Her Majesty\u2019s lady-in-waiting, and Lord Lawrence has come and gone through the threshold of the Empress\u2019 Palace these days\u2026\u201d\u201cBut, isn\u2019t it a little too much to say Her Majesty has quit her seclusion? The Empress\u2019 Palace door is open, but she doesn\u2019t actually meet anyone.\u201d\u201cAt least, she has revealed that she is willing to be involved in the future affairs.\u201dPeople were looking at the door of the Empress\u2019s Palace in a tense manner. Apart from that, the topic of the necromancer was very interesting.\u201cBut I think that necromancer is the real deal.\u201dSomeone lowered their voice and said.\u201cBaroness Landon also found her son.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t the son of Baroness Landon leave the house because of a maid that caught his eye two years ago?\u201d\u201cYeah. But without the son, the baroness is a little\u2026 You know. Baron Landon was lying in his sickbed and didn\u2019t know how to get up, and he had the worst relationship with his ex-wife\u2019s daughter. They haven\u2019t heard from him since he left the house but the necromancer told them where he is.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s great. The necromancer sometimes shows up, but I think this is the first time I\u2019ve heard stories about finding something or getting it right like this one.\u201d\u201cBy the way, it\u2019s a big deal for Baron Landon. Maybe he wouldn\u2019t accept the maid, right?\u201d\u201cWhy not?\u201dSomeone said interestingly.***The rumored necromancer was in the mansion of Henry Keyshore, the emperor\u2019s captain of the guard.It was invited by Keyshore\u2019s daughter Miel and her cousin Hazel.Miel hesitated terribly at first. Hazel urged her.\u201cIt\u2019s just for fun. It\u2019s no different from watching coffee dots. You don\u2019t have to take it that seriously.\u201d\u201cBut if my father knows, I\u2019ll be scolded.\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you curious? Why the hell is there so much sensation in the social world? Didn\u2019t you hear that? Not long ago, he guessed right when Sir Noah was going to sue Count Atilla. Until then, no one had ever guessed the love Sir Noah has for Lady Atilla.\u201dMiel was tempted. Hazel said energetically.\u201cWhat if the necromancer comes and only tells lies? There is nothing to lose.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to write an article about it.\u201d\u201cReally? Did your aunt allow it?\u201d\u201cIf the newspaper sells my article, my mother won\u2019t say anything anymore. Help me, Miel. I want to keep it a secret until I finish the article.\u201dMiel was defeated.Miel provided the place, and Hazel prepared everything else.Some of the noble ladies, who were interested in the seance, immediately announced their intention to attend.The invited necromancer appeared wearing a purple hood over his eyes.\u201cA perfectly circular table, 9 people, red candles as many as the number of people, white tablecloths\u2026 All right. You have everything you need.\u201dThe necromancer said seriously. Then he took the knife out of his arms.He stabbed his finger and drew his blood. With the blood, a magic circle was drawn in the center of the white tablecloth.Then the lights were turned off and the curtains were drawn to darken the room. Then there was a rather mysterious atmosphere.\u201cEveryone, please put your hands under the table and hold hands with the people on both sides. This is called the circle of life. It plays a role in keeping the spirit from going out.\u201dThe necromancer said with a serious face.\u201cNever let go of your hands. Even we don\u2019t know what good spirits would do if they go out of control. Above all, these holding hands serve to protect each other. Spirits seep into the palms of a living person, so make sure to hold the palm together.\u201dHazel giggled. It was because the words of the necromancer sounded too absurd.The necromancer mumbled and memorized an incomprehensible spell.The guests were going to enjoy this funny game in their own way, but they couldn\u2019t do so when the blue sparks started splashing in the magic circle drawn by blood. Hazel, who was giggling, stopped laughing.There was tension in the room.Flash!The magic circle spewed out a flash so that it couldn\u2019t be seen for a moment.\u201cAackk!\u201dStartled Miel screamed.A silent footstep ran from outside. Keyshore, who just came home, heard Miel\u2019s scream and ran.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on, Miel!\u201dThe door opened wide, and a light came in. The frightened guests hurried. Some screamed that if you let go of your hand, the spirit will escape.Keyshore pulled the glowing tablecloth and threw it off the floor.As the candles fell, the carpet caught fire. Keyshore struck it off with a tablecloth.Then Keyshore opened the curtains wide open.Then he glanced at Miel, squeezing her chest in the chair, and turned his stunned face to Hazel.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on with this, Hazel?\u201d\u201cOh, that\u2019s it. We just had a seance\u2026.. Don\u2019t get mad, don\u2019t get mad, uncle. It was just for fun. Miel\u2019s yelling was just of surprise\u2026\u201d\u201cSeance? Is this the scammer who is famous these days?\u201dHe grabbed the collar of the necromancer.\u201cHehehe\u2026.\u201dThe necromancer laughed awkwardly.Keyshore dragged the necromancer to the library.And he threw him to the floor.After taking his hood that was shaped and worn upside down. Inside, there was a young man with no mystery or anything.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dKeyshore asked fiercely. The necromancer said.\u201cI am just a clown.\u201d\u201cEven if you\u2019re not, I heard ridiculous rumors about you. Clown?\u201d\u201cWell, what is it\u2026. Gives a little fun to the rich who like that, and they give me a little reward\u2026\u201d\u201cI heard the words that you call a real soul and prophecy.\u201d\u201cAh, who seriously believes in such a thing? I\u2019ll tell you, I try to find out a little about the guests beforehand to make a realistic acting.\u201dThe necromancer groaned and rubbed his palm.\u201cIt\u2019s just gathering rumors of social affairs and wrapping them in plausible words. The Lady\u2019s marriage partner is the one who seems to hate the Lady now. He has charming eyes\u2026. Something like this.\u201d\u201cHow did you create the light?\u201d\u201cWell, that\u2019s where I picked up an ancient script and learned it. It means \u2018shine,\u2019 I draw it with blood, and it glows after a while.\u201dKeyshore touched his forehead.It was absurd to say that this scammer is so rumored in the social world. He was almost ashamed of himself.\u201cGo away. Don\u2019t show up again.\u201dHe shouted loudly.The necromancer slipped and fell while striking his back with a shy, frightened face. Then he quickly turned around and ran out.Outside the study, Hazel and Miel snooped with frightened faces. Keyshore said in a harsh voice.\u201cCome in both of you.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m, I\u2019m sorry, Father.\u201dMiel bowed her head. So did Hazel.Keyshore sighed.\u201cYou have to have something to be curious about. I thought you guys were smart ladies, so I didn\u2019t say anything and just watched. So, what stupidity is this?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just a play. I know it\u2019s a scam. I\u2019m curious about the trick\u2026\u201d\u201cHazel!\u201dKeyshore yelled.\u201cDoes it make sense for children under 20 years old to attract scammers to their homes for fun? If it\u2019s a scam, it\u2019s a scam, it\u2019s a big deal! What would people think? What about the temple?\u201d\u201cAh, it\u2019s a trend here and there, that\u2019s\u2026\u201dHazel flinched while trying to make an excuse. It was because Keyshore had a scary face.***As the necromancer was expelled, he stretched out his shoulders and sighed as he stepped out of the Keyshore mansion.As he walked around one of the alleys, a black carriage was waiting.The necromancer lamented as he climbed the carriage.\u201cToday is a really wild day.\u201d\u201cDid something happen? Rye?\u201dAsked Freil, who was riding in the carriage.\u201cDon\u2019t you say Rye, it\u2019s Watt. By the way, how long have you been calling me by my name?\u201dThe necromancer, Rye Fidget complained.Freil laughed. Artizea called him Rye, so he just followed accordingly.\u201cWhat about Sir Keyshore?\u201d\u201cI was thrown out after being treated as an absurd scammer.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re a ridiculous scammer, right?\u201d\u201cThe absurd conspiracy\u2026.\u201dWhile saying so, Rye saw Freil\u2019s sarcastic face and corrected his words.\u201cIt\u2019s called \u2026.. a pawn.\u201dRye sighed.\u201cBy the way, I did what I was told to do, but I didn\u2019t know that the wave would grow like this. It seems that Lord Keyshore already knew me.\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t say your name, did you?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I know that disappearing with nothing but a fraudulent necromancer saved my life.\u201d\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He\u2019ll forget my face tomorrow.\u201d\u201cDo you need more pay?\u201d\u201cIf you give it to me, I won\u2019t decline it.\u201d\u201cHer Grace must have given you enough.\u201dEven with a puzzled face, Freil took out a pocket of silver coins from his arms and gave it to Rye.Rye took it, put it in his inner pocket, and looked satisfied.\u201cIt\u2019s important to get extra income.\u201dThe second time Artizea visited Rye was about fifteen days before the wedding.[What brings you to such a place when a precious marriage will be taking place soon?]Rye asked, complaining.[You have done very well the last time.][If you were dissatisfied with that, my throat would have fallen already.][Are you afraid to live?]Rye shook his head.But she wasn\u2019t that offended.Artizea has clearly indicated that she was his superior, but never cared about his disrespect. She was comfortable with that attitude.And not so long ago, his sister contacted him again. It was said that an old doctor who had come from the capital to heal the youngest settled in the village.The doctor said he hired her to be a nurse. His other siblings and village children were also taught letters and numbers for free.As the youngest\u2019s treatment expenses were reduced, there was room in his house. His mother also said that she started getting treatment for her wrist that\u2019s always been sore.He was honestly grateful. Instead of just throwing a large sum of money to take care of his own life, she was constantly taking care of his family so that they would not notice it.Even if she gave 10,000 gold at a time, his family will not be able to keep it well.He was worried about what kind of work she made him do.Artizea said as if she had read that thought.[If you die, you don\u2019t have to worry because your family will be taken care of forever.][Oh my. Have you already pawned someone else\u2019s life?][I have no intention of asking for your life yet.]Artizea smiled faintly.[I need a young man who has a good manner of speaking, can respond on his toes, has impeccable memory, shameless, and has an inconspicuous appearance. Of course, a heavy mouth is a necessary condition.][With exception to my appearance, I meet those conditions. I\u2019m a little handsome\u2026 ]Rye replied, searching the connections in his head for a moment.Artizea snorted at the retort about his appearance.[I chose you, including your appearance.]And what she asked him to do was to become a necromancer.[It\u2019s about getting into the center of the social world. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll get a pretty good extra income. But you shouldn\u2019t be shaken or excited. Don\u2019t forget that approaching your goal is the number one priority.]Rye told Keyshore that he gathered rumors of social affairs and told them in a plausible package.But, in fact, all of the information he spoke of came from Artizea\u2019s hands.Artizea collected useful information from the information she remembered in advance and compiled them into a small booklet. And she left it to Freil.It wasn\u2019t important information. It was just simple information that would be interesting and forgotten in the social world.Most of them were things such as Viscount Moe having an affair, or where the jeweled fan that Viscountess Moe lost would be found.Then he will be esteemed as a remarkable fortune teller at the time.On the other hand, when it comes to important topics, there will be more attention from people as insignificant as Keyshore.To raise interest and credibility, Artizea created a magic circle.The magic circle with the word \u201cLight\u201d written on it was elegant to look at because of the ancient characters.However, the structure was very simple. When activated by a spell, a dazzling light is emitted for about 15 seconds and turns off automatically.Because it was such small magic, there was no need for human sacrifice. The life force from freshly shed blood was enough.Of course, Rye complained while memorizing difficult ancient scripts.[If I get caught in the temple by mistake, I\u2019ll be the one in trouble.][So you have to pretend to be a scammer.]Necromancy and ancient magic are all prohibited in temples. If caught, they will be burned.However, there was always someone interested in divination, calling ghosts, or predicting through constellations. There have always been scammers.The temple couldn\u2019t be interested in these little things. Wouldn\u2019t it be more demeaning to be tricked by a scammer that acted like a real wizard?[If you are caught as a scammer, I will get you out with money, so don\u2019t worry.][Really, I\u2019m uneasy.][If you\u2019re uneasy, can\u2019t you just use it when it\u2019s absolutely necessary?]Artizea said that, but Rye couldn\u2019t.At first he didn\u2019t do it because he hated bleeding.However, it changed as the atmosphere rose and invitations from noble families began to come.Without realizing, his mouth fluttered magic really well and he used it to heighten mystery.Thanks to that, his fingers, arms, and other parts were full of wounds.Rye finally understood why Artizea was looking for someone who could approach the goal without getting too excited.He became so popular that he was invited to decent homes such as the Keyshore Mansion. As a result, even he got excited over the prospect of money despite his firm goal.If he were a normal man, he were more likely to forget his original goal and focus on the interests of the social world, and run wild.However, even Rye did not yet know what Artizea\u2019s final goal was.He was only told that if the goal was approaching, he would naturally know.The carriage started rolling. Rye received a booklet from Freil\u2019s hand and began memorizing the information he needed for the next seance.The reason why he didn\u2019t give the booklet at all was because there was a lot of information about the nobles and it was dangerous for Rye to keep.So, Freil had to come in person every time to have Rye memorize the booklet.\u201cThe Marchioness seems to be running a separate information organization, right?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t try to dig too far.\u201dFreil said briefly.But in fact, Freil was also curious.Freil classified the information there into three categories.The first is information that can be found through investigation, and the second is new information that can be inferred from the collected information.However, the third could only be thought of as a prophecy.Most of all, it was amazing that this amount of information could be collected and written at once.Artizea began to form an information network in earnest around the time she met Cedric.Even considering the scale of the information network that was created now, that was perfect.Yet, with the size of the information network, it will not be possible to find out so much information at once.\u2018I\u2019m also interested in things that don\u2019t need to be too much digging.\u2019Freil shook his head.If you don\u2019t want to believe it, you don\u2019t need to know, but if you choose to believe it, you don\u2019t have to think about anything else.Rye, who memorized all the necessary information, returned the booklet.The carriage arrived near Rye\u2019s accommodation just in time.Rye jumped out of the carriage.Then he entered the place, and ran back out of the road before Freil started the carriage.Freil was surprised and gestured to the coachman to wait. Rye jumped into the carriage.\u201cHere. This is the Marchioness\u2019 goal.\u201dRye handed out an envelope of an invitation.The envelope was stamped with the Marquisate of Rosan.It is only Artizea and Miraila that can write from the Marquisate of Rosan.And since Artizea is not in the capital, this was Miraila.\u201cIt\u2019s terrible, even the Marchioness. With a pretty face. To be taking revenge so thoroughly.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be alarmed. Watch your mouth.\u201dFreil said lowly.He knew the goal.However, he did not know the final goal of Artizea\u2019s play.[My mother is always anxious.]As she completed the booklet and gave it to him, Artizea said so.[But she can\u2019t lean on the temple. My mother\u2019s life itself violates the temple\u2019s teachings, but that doesn\u2019t mean she can\u2019t get out of that situation.]Artizea laughed in a self-helpful way.[Isn\u2019t the sincere dedication of the emperor\u2019s mistress to the temple itself a ridicule in the social world? She can give a bribe, but she can\u2019t pray.][Yes.][Then the only place to rely on is superstition. If she sees a necromancer who is rumored to be clever, she will surely be interested.]Artizea also said.[The reason I chose a young man is because my mother believes the word of a man much better. If he were a young man, he would be a substitute for my brother.][Aren\u2019t you putting too heavy a burden on Rye Fidget?][Rye will do well. Because he\u2019s a man who is quick to act.]Artizea said so.[There is a high probability that I will not be in the capital, so you should advise Rye instead.][Yes.][He must not give the initiative of the relationship to my mother. He doesn\u2019t really need to get close. He needs to thoroughly pretend to be a mysterious necromancer and focus on raising money.][Yes.][By attracting multiple people to the seance, reducing the number of meetings one-to-one, mainly by making predictions or giving information to other people, it is difficult. My mother will be anxious just because the seance is real, so it\u2019s okay.][Would His Majesty the Emperor remain still?][It is important for His Majesty to think that necromancy is just play. If he thinks she\u2019s indulged in a rather peculiar play, he\u2019ll fall for it. The most important thing is not to reveal Rye\u2019s identity.][Yes.][Don\u2019t worry too much about her because my mother never shows off her recourse to superstitions in front of His Majesty. I have also advised Countess Eunice.][Yes.][So I think the possibility is low, but if His Majesty intervenes while you can\u2019t contact me, or if there is any other urgent situation, protect Rye. Be prepared so that he can always give up everything and disappear.][Okay. By the way, if you have enough trust before you come back, will you not proceed with the work in advance?]He could only guess what she was going to do.But if she\u2019s going to get Miraila into a conspiracy, Freil asked if it wasn\u2019t good when neither Artizea nor Cedric were in the capital.[I think it\u2019s safer for you to control it yourself. It\u2019s something that can get me involved. It\u2019s okay if it\u2019s me alone, but it\u2019s difficult to stop the Grand Duke Evron from getting caught in it.]Artizea said with a cold face.However, she quickly erased her cold face and sighed with a somber face.Freil quietly stepped back without disturbing her any further.This is not revenge. That was the only thing he could know for sure.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The eyes are shiny glazed black stone.By itself, it looked just like a real rabbit.The soft, fine fur was swept on her palm. Artizea smiled without knowing it.\u201cCute!\u201dThe maids admired.The treasurer Jaden, who brought the rabbit fur doll, sighed with relief.It was only a month ago that Artizea had Jaden do this.Artizea checked all the financial books of Evron Grand Duchy. Then she acknowledged that there is no way to deal with the grim situation of the Evron Grand Duchy.No matter what, as Cedric said, human resources were a problem.There were many resources. There were also a number of profitable mines, and projects that could be done by leaning against the vast coniferous forest were also available on the spot.But they couldn\u2019t afford to develop it. All healthy and young men who could be the core of the labor force were enlisted.Otherwise, most of them were engaged in agriculture. This is because the man\u2019s strength was needed to plow the frozen ground.It is a difficult place to raise livestock. It was inevitable to use human resources.Most of the other industries were women.Everyone was working without a hitch. Otherwise, it was difficult for the entire province to survive together.In addition, the same was true of growing mines or other industries.The mainland of the Krates Empire is a fertile land full of vast and productive power. The products in remote areas like Evron Grand Duchy are not competitive.There is even the cost of transportation. In some cases, it was difficult to profit from trade.It is also important to keep in mind that traffic is cut off in winter.For that reason, Evron didn\u2019t even have a merchant guild, let alone the business.Even if there was a business that could make money, they couldn\u2019t even invest heavily in it. This is because the food self-sufficiency rate that is still maintained will also fall.If this was not the Evron Grand Duchy, it could have been solved by growing other industries and purchasing food.People will flock where money goes, so population problems can also be solved.But this is the Evron Grand Duchy. Even if food is purchased, transportation takes time.Moreover, the transport route was too limited.When it was peaceful, it could be resolved by purchasing it from the mainland. But it always had to be thought about when it was impossible.If the imperial family blocks the supply even for a year, they will not be able to withstand it immediately.Like the mainland, when food is scarce, it does not have the ability to withstand the next harvest.That reduced population will never grow again.Therefore, they had to maintain the current production as much as possible.As a result, they were in a position to put agriculture first, even though they knew what a competitive business it was.Artizea turned to the fur and leather business.First of all, she thought it was important to increase the efficiency of the existing business and make room for finances.[The leather business is the main source of income. We have to continue hunting anyway.]Aaron explained.[If we do not hunt, wild animals will invade human areas. It can also serve as military training, so the army is doing it in units.][Most of the leather is handed over to the business as it is.][Yes. I know it\u2019s a bargain price, but I don\u2019t have enough room to figure out the actual market price sold in the mainland and distribute it directly there.][Have you ever bargained?]Aaron had an embarrassed face.[Is it so severe?]Even Artizea didn\u2019t even know the wholesale price of leather, but it was clear from the record that it would be denting.She didn\u2019t rebuke Aaron because Artizea knew it would be anyway.Aaron is a soldier. He is only in charge of such a business as the manager of the estate due to the circumstances of the Grand Duchy, who has not developed commerce.Expecting great skill is too harsh.The same was true of the treasurers. They were sincere and meticulous. They were the ones who did what they had to do without mistakes.All were very loyal. In the past, even a lot of money couldn\u2019t make a traitor.Instead, there was no one with outstanding abilities. To be honest, she wondered if there was anyone under Cedric who was so capable.Perhaps it is because the Evron Grand Duchy itself is lagging behind the commercial industry.As Artizea knew, the vast majority of talented talents under Cedric were soldiers.Artizea took a new piece of paper and wrote the last year\u2019s price, and wrote the new price next to it.[Do not sell below this. I\u2019m sure they will be crying about the market price or the shipping cost, but don\u2019t listen. If you feel like your heart will be shaken, tell him to come to see me.][Ah, I see.][Speaking of the Evron leather, even I, who doesn\u2019t know much about this industry, has heard the name, so let\u2019s bargain with the idea that it doesn\u2019t matter if the deal is cut for about a year or so.]Artizea said coldly.[There\u2019s a problem with only three places at the business and offering the same price. They must be doing something in collusion.]If caught, she won\u2019t let it go.It wasn\u2019t something to be done right away, so she left it only in memory, and Artizea finished the word.[Next is the fur.][Ah, yes. This is pretty good. There are so many things that are used domestically, so the processing technology is good.]The treasurer in charge answered politely.[But it\u2019s not an item that\u2019s sold all year round and it\u2019s a luxury item. If too much is sent out, the price will fall, and the profits will decrease, so we are adjusting the supply.][We need to increase demand significantly.]The treasurer looked at her with an embarrassed face. If that was possible, no one would have worried.[Let\u2019s reduce the distribution level. Sir Aaron, I don\u2019t think there are any merchants from Evron working in the capital\u2026.][Yes, there should be.][Look for them. Someone you can trust.][What are we going to do?][Let\u2019s make stuffed animals and fur ornaments.]Artizea said so.[No matter how hard you try, we can\u2019t lead the trends like fashion, but anything that hasn\u2019t existed before is different. It would be nice if it was a product that could show the luxury of fur to the fullest.]At Artizea\u2019s words, the treasurers blinked.The first one to understand was Jaden, a junior treasurer.[Oh, I see. You can make something like a prop or a doll that is light enough to not be strange even if you bring it to a banquet and that looks valuable enough to show off to others, right? Using a lot of fur. Then it will continue to sell in the summer.][You\u2019re quick to understand.][Even if we start with high-end products at first, the trend will eventually go down to the middle class, so the demand for fur leather itself may increase tremendously. Hopefully it will be a great deal. If you think that the Kingdom of Iants is rich even from selling only embroidery fabrics.][Yes.][But, Grand Duchess, fur leather is different from the Iants embroidery. No artistry, no monopoly. Fur leather would be produced in the mainland as well.[One of the treasurers refuted.[So, we should make it while thinking about its beauty and texture, not just a cold weather tool. There\u2019s no place that can supply more quality fur leather than Evron. Even if it is behind in the final production, it is always beneficial if it is trendy. If it\u2019s an ornament, it can also be sold in the South where it doesn\u2019t require cold weather.]Instead of talking, Jaden exclaimed as if he realized it.[Hopefully you can sell it to the Southern Sea, can\u2019t you? If it\u2019s a trend in the capital social world?]Artizea clapped twice.[You will be responsible for this job.][Yes?! I\u2019m a junior official, are you serious?][ A person who understands what they are trying to do should take over the job.]Artizea said so.That\u2019s how Jaden became in charge of this.[It\u2019s a product to be shown to the social world. Make it any way you like, whether it\u2019s jewelry or precious metal. Give the prototype to your wife and daughter.]Artizea said so.Aaron asked anxiously.[I understand what you mean. But would it be so easy to make it fashionable in the capital city?][Don\u2019t worry. Whose daughter do you think I am?]Aaron and the treasurers bowed their heads with a sorry face, thinking of Miraila.But at the same time, they also thought that it was possible. Her mother is the Emperor\u2019s mistress, who has dominated the Empire\u2019s social world for over 20 years. There will be plenty of experience in this kind of thing.And after several failures, these dolls were made in a month.\u201cIs the black one fox fur?\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s not a black fox, it\u2019s dyed.\u201dArtizea lifted the elongated fur. It looked like a doll, but it was enough to wrap it around the neck and use it as a decoration. Even if she put it on her shoulder, it was pretty cool.\u201cThe pupils are blue crystals.\u201d\u201cI told you to use jewelry.\u201dHe said that he would give the prototype to his wife and daughter, so it would be nice to have the most expensive one.Jaden said with a sad face.\u201cFor my wife, this jewel is expensive enough. How can I satisfy my own selfish desires when you have entrusted me with such an important task?\u201d\u201cIs that what you think about or your wife?\u201d\u201cMy wife told me to say this.\u201dJaden confessed with a shameless face.Artizea made a small sound and laughed.\u201cYou have a wise wife, you\u2019ll be successful in the future.Jaden only scratched his head. Artizea called Aubrey.\u201cAubrey, go get my jewel box.\u201dAubrey, who had been standing behind Artizea the entire time, moved.Artizea stroked the fox fur in a satisfed mood.Knock, knock.Then she heard a knocking on the door. The maid ran and opened the door.Cedric walked in with a plate of cookies and stopped when he saw Jaden.\u201cOh, are you busy?\u201d\u201cNo. The business is almost over.\u201dArtizea turned and said, the big hand gently approached.\u201cOoph.\u201dA bite-sized snack came in her mouth.Inadvertently, the scent of baked apple spread in her mouth as the crunchy outer pie material broke.Artizea covered her mouth with her hand, turning red.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Then, she could barely answer him.\u201cI\u2019ll eat it later.\u201d\u201cThen I will wait until you finish eating.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t need to do that. I can eat after work.\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019ll wait for that too. If I don\u2019t keep the snack time, I\u2019ll be scolded by Ansgar later.\u201dCedric sat next to Artizea, stroking the fox fur ornament.\u201cIs this the fur product you mentioned before?\u201d\u201cYes, is it okay?\u201dArtizea put it on her shoulder and showed it to him.\u201cIt looks good, to be able to wear it like a gold decoration.\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s a good idea.\u201d\u201cIt suits you.\u201dArtizea lost words to answer.Cedric would casually say something like this.It seemed that he didn\u2019t know that Artizea\u2019s heart trembled every time.Artizea struggled to turn her head. And she beckoned to Aubrey, struggling to maintain a casual look.Aubrey came out with the jewelry box, saw Cedric and stopped walking.Artizea opened the lid of the box with her standing by her side.\u201cThe fox\u2019s eyes look good with sapphire.\u201dArtizea picked up two small sapphires of the same size.\u201cAnd for a rabbit, simple gemstones would be better, garnet and amber. Sophie, go get a pouch to hold this.\u201dOnly then, realizing that Artizea was about to give him the jewel, Jaden struck his hand.\u201cIt\u2019s too much, Grand Duchess. I really can\u2019t accept it.\u201d\u201cHold it for three days, then discuss it with your wife. Dispose of it on your own. It won\u2019t be a burden to have such a thing at home because it is a gift.\u201d\u201cThank you. \u201cJaden knelt down on one of his knees and bowed. And with a thrilled face, he also thanked Cedric.Artizea said.\u201cThree fox furs and two more rabbit furs. Make the finest. I\u2019ll send them all to a valuable person, so they must be of different forms. Don\u2019t forget that this is the first product to be introduced.\u201d\u201cYes, I will do my best.\u201d\u201cI will choose jewels that can be used as eyes or decorations and leave it to Margaret. Use it extravagantly.\u201d\u201cYes, I understand.\u201d\u201cI wish I could see the results in a short time.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve made it once, so I\u2019ll be able to make the second faster. Thank you for trusting me.\u201dJaden politely bowed.Then he took the jewel bag from Sophie, put it in his arms, hugged the two dolls and went outside.\u201cAre you done with your work today?\u201dCedric asked, picking up the snack and holding it out. Artizea hesitated.\u201cYes.\u201dArtizea carefully took the snack from Cedric\u2019s hand.She was conscious of chewing something in front of his eyes, so she was very careful. She was also bothered that there was a crackling sound in her mouth.Cedric asked.\u201cIs the taste okay?\u201d\u201cYes. I\u2019ve never known that fruit is so delicious.\u201dFor the food situation, the diet consisted mainly of meat processed for storage.This is where even grain is scarce. All vegetables were pickled and stored. Fruits were only jam or dried.He was paying special attention to Artizea\u2019s meals in the kitchen, but there were limits.The scent of apples was precious.\u201cEat more. I\u2019ll be here until the plate is empty.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to bring it yourself like this. Even if you order it to a maid, she\u2019ll keep the snack time.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m bringing it myself because I want to come.\u201dCedric revised it, as if he had forgotten what he said earlier that Ansgar would scold him if he didn\u2019t uphold the snack time.Then he picked up another snack and handed it to Artizea.\u201cIf you keep doing this, I will get into a bad habit.\u201d\u201cSo it turns out that I didn\u2019t announce my new year goals?\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t say anything. What is it?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m making you spoiled.\u201dArtizea covered her mouth with her hand and laughed out loud. Because she truly thought it was a joke.However, Cedric simply smiled deeply and looked at her. The laughter died down. Maybe he wasn\u2019t kidding.Her mouth could hardly be opened, even though she had decided on what to say.Cedric called her name.\u201cTia.\u201dArtizea unintentionally turned her eyes, and she again caught him in her gaze.Cedric smiled lightly. His face was so close that his breath was mixed with Artizea\u2019s.Cedric lowered his head. Artizea closed her eyes unknowingly.But his lips touched her cheek, not her lips.Artizea exhaled a trembling breath to relieve her tension. She thought he was going to kiss her.Cedric said in a soft voice, sweeping lightly under her eyes.\u201cI told you to pay attention to the heating, the Grand Hall is still cold. Dress warmly.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026.\u201d\u201cSee you later. \u201cCedric stood up.\u2018Why are you doing this to me?\u2019Every time she looked at his face, she was eager to ask. The emotions were high.But she doesn\u2019t really want to know his feelings. She doesn\u2019t even want the right answer.She just wanted permission to stay a little longer like this.She can\u2019t do that, but she keeps getting happy.She could not deny that she was attracted to Cedric.How could she not be attracted? To such a sweet, strong and upright person.She ended her life once. There was a time when she was sitting right below the emperor.She saw and evaluated a lot of people. She disturbed the world as if churning the bottom of the river, confirming the dirtiness at the bottom of men.It was also then. Cedric was the most straightforward and gorgeous man she knew.Even when his eyes were covered in mud named Family, she could still see his light shine through.She pulled him down to the bottom and saw nothing changed.She dared not to describe him like jewels.\u2018At that time\u2026 .\u2019At that time.She just pretended not to know, because it was something she shouldn\u2019t know.She came back to the past, and it still was something that couldn\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t be.So she tried to push her emotions deep into her stomach and ignore Cedric\u2019s hand.How dare she take the place next to Cedric?She killed several people whom Cedric cherished. Lysia was also taken; Evron Grand Duchy was destroyed.Just because time is turned back doesn\u2019t mean that all the crime will disappear. At least it certainly remained in Artizea\u2019s memory.Even after more than half a year, she sometimes recalled Cedric, who bowed down in front of her.Every time she did that, it was so painful that it was difficult to even breathe, as if her chest was pierced with a spear.Artizea sometimes thought she would have been better to stay by Cedric\u2019s side, where she would have been able to help him to work off that punishment.She knows it\u2019s a selfish idea. She knows that it is much better to minimize the victims.But every time Cedric smiled with a friendly face, she felt so sore and painful in her heart that she couldn\u2019t help but think so.At that time, Cedric would not have smiled at her. Knowing everything, he wouldn\u2019t have been kind.She deserved it.Even being by his side as a servant is a sinful thing, how dare she want more than that.For Cedric as a monarch, it was fine. Because he has a vessel that can accommodate evil people like her.Because he told her to make a plan.But as a man, he is not his own.It was also a sin for him to be greedy. She knew he deserved to be refused.But when he smiled tenderly, her heart jumped.When he held her hand, her body heated up. When he reached out his hand, she could not escape. She wanted to be held in his arms.Her lips trembled, knowing the joy he touched.She wanted to walk a little more, not in reality, but stepping on these sweet dreams.The feeling left on the cheek was unlikely to disappear for a while.***Aubrey stood far away with her jewelry box.She was in tears.It was like being an invisible person.Artizea did not particularly ignore her, but she did not treat her close as a lady-in-waiting.The maids who followed Artizea hated her blatantly.The ladies of the stronghold were not the same as before.If it were her old days, she was the most precious lady in the stronghold. There were rarely any women in the Grand Duchy, so naturally the daughters of the Jordyn\u2019s received precious treatment.But now everyone knelt to Artizea. Aubrey was behind the scenes. She was only seen as Artizea\u2019s lady-in-waiting.But the saddest thing was Cedric\u2019s attitude.\u2018How can you not even look at me like that?\u2019If he looks at her once, he\u2019ll notice this unfair situation.However, when Cedric was with Artizea, there was very little in him giving any attention to anything other than Artizea.The gentle gaze, friendly gestures, and kind consideration sometimes seemed sweet.Every time she saw it right in front of her eyes, Aubrey felt even more disastrous of her standing.Artizea kept Aubrey close and never let her sit.The subordinate cannot sit in the seat until the superior allows it. That is the court manner.Artizea offered to teach her.Aubrey had to stand by Artizea all day long. Even when the treasurer or the maid is sitting.That said, she didn\u2019t have anything to be proud of.All that was left to Aubrey was a jewel box.It was important. No lady entrusts a jewelry box to someone she doesn\u2019t trust.But Aubrey thought she was just like a foot on a jewelry box.Artizea sometimes had her bring the jewelry box so that she could look at it and put it right next to her for an hour to pick.She can\u2019t believe she was being treated like this. She is the daughter of Count Jordyn, who can be called the first vassal of the Grand Duke, and she is the first lady-in-waiting.Sophie came out of the bathroom to prepare clothes for the banquet. She saw Aubrey standing until then, and so she said cautiously.\u201cIt\u2019s hard, right? My madam called, and she told me I need to clean up the jewelry box. So, sit back and relax. Since the madam is a gentle person, Miss Aubrey just \u2026..\u201d\u201cShut up! Do you sympathize with me when you\u2019re the maid?\u201d\u201cAahh!\u201dAubrey threw the jewelry box at her.Sophie, who was beaten by the heavy gold box, fell to the floor. The jewels scattered on the floor and sparkled brilliantly.Blood ran from one side of Sophie\u2019s head.Aubrey was startled. Because she didn\u2019t intend to hurt Sophie.But she soon clenched her lips.It\u2019s all because of Artizea. As such, it was not a problem for a maid brought from Artizea\u2019s family.Aubrey knew very well that this was Artizea trying to discourage her.\u2018I wonder who will give in.\u2019She was the daughter of the Jordyn family, and was the vassal of the Grand Duke Evron. She wasn\u2019t a knight, but she was confident that she wasn\u2019t the same as the weak capital ladies.\u2018I\u2019m not someone to be treated like this!\u2019Aubrey ran out.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She couldn\u2019t find a physician and was helped by another maid to stop the bleeding.It was because she had to come back before Artizea left the bathroom.Thanks to that, the bandages wrapped were poor. The blood oozes out a new red color, and it starts to unravel.Artizea looked at Sophie quietly. Cold air settled in the Tuvalet room.The maids bowed their heads in fear, even though it wasn\u2019t their fault.Artizea was a master with very little expression of her emotions. Even though she was angry, she would be quietly and fiercely angry.But they didn\u2019t expect her to show such cold anger without moving an eyebrow.Sophie gave a hard smile and said.\u201cMadam, please change your clothes first. You need to prepare for the banquet.\u201d\u201cYou go and show the wound to the physician. Paula, take Sophie to the physician.\u201d\u201cYes, Madam.\u201dPaula crossed Sophie\u2019s arms and led her out in a hurry.\u201cRize, bring me the jewelry box.\u201dRize handed over the jewelry box she was holding to Artizea.There was a crack as the box made of agate and gold fell to the floor. There was also blood on the corner.\u201cI can\u2019t believe it. Even though Aubrey doesn\u2019t show me the respect I deserve, I never thought she would throw my jewelry box on the floor to destroy it. She even beat the maid I brought from home.\u201dArtizea\u2019s voice rang coldly.\u201cGo find Aubrey and bring her here.\u201d\u201cMa\u2026 madam, please dress up\u2026\u201d\u201cHow can I be dressed up after being insulted by my own lady-in-waiting?\u201dArtizea said so.The maids were terrified and panicked.An older maid took the lead and offered a bow to Artizea.Then, she rushed the other maids out.\u201cYou go and tell Margaret what just happened. The rest of you go and quickly look for Aubrey. If anyone finds her, go inform Margaret first before bringing her here.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t the first thing to do is to come and ask for forgiveness?\u201d\u201cYou know Miss Aubrey\u2019s temperament. Soon after, if there is a real big deal, it\u2019ll only be a mess. And how worried would Margaret be?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d\u201cAnyway, find her before it\u2019s too late.\u201dAfter the discussion, the maids scattered.***Margaret was in the Grand Hall.Artizea has given her full authority over the life of the stronghold. So it was Margaret\u2019s job to prepare the event for the New Year\u2019s banquet.She cared for heating more than anything else.Charcoal with less smoke was spread here and there, and tapestry was hanged in layers where drafts could penetrate.However, if the ventilation is poor, the smoke may build up. She had to pay attention to keep the warmth flowing without the cold wind hitting the seat of the Grand Duke and Duchess.Artizea was an easy mistress.She did not compare the desolate Grand Duchy to the Capital. She didn\u2019t get fussy with what to wear and sleep on, and didn\u2019t even try to press down on people below her.When Cedric said that he was marrying Miraila\u2019s daughter, she was worried in so many ways.But now that worry has completely disappeared.Her behavior was decent and calm. She was generous to everybody, but she had an air of superiority.The number of people who voluntarily stepped over increased. Many of them were treasurers.The economic situation in the province, which seemed to have been stagnating forever, began to move with vitality.Recently, she has also had a good reputation with the maids.It was a flaw that she wasn\u2019t eating well. She had to try hard so she wasn\u2019t cold. Still, there was nothing difficult about it.Margaret once served Cedric\u2019s mother. In fact, it was much harder then.Cedric\u2019s mother was kind and good, but she was too young. She got homesick and she was always sick. She made the people around her feel sorry.Compared to her, Artizea did not feel young, even though her age was similar.She\u2019s not a young mistress to look after, rather she was a supervisor you could count on.It was the Grand Duke\u2019s wishes. No, it\u2019s more than that.She was the one who suited Cedric and complimented his shortcomings.\u2018You two good luck, so you can give me some good news next spring\u2026\u201dAaron was already looking ahead.Margaret pinched the back of his hand for those nonsense.[Because the Grand Duchess is not so healthy. Before that, she will need supplements and a lot of nutrition, gain some weight, and exercise to stay strong. She\u2019s still young, and it\u2019s better to stay in a warm place.]So Margaret also said some nonsense that the next spring is just perfect.Anyway, the only concern now was Aubrey.\u201cAunt Margaret.\u201dWhile she picked up a candlestick and checked the ebb and flow of the wind, she heard a voice calling.A beautiful girl wearing a cozy fur coat was entering the grand hall.The roughly loosened red hair was scattered by the wind and got disheveled. Her lively cheeks and a small nose were dyed red, as if struck by the cold breeze.The girl was wearing furry leather pants and boots that reached her thighs. She wore a short sword and a gunpowder container on her waist.She seemed to be dancing to the air with a brisk gait. Her red lips were lush, and her green eyes were clear like a forest.If she had only a bow and a quiver on her shoulder, it would look like the goddess of hunting had just popped out of the picture.Margaret was startled, she asked.\u201cLysia, did you come on a horse?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, aunt. The banquet dress will be arriving soon. I just came a little early because I was frustrated.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean early? Everyone was here a few days ago, but only you are late. Today is the banquet, but you just came now.\u201d\u201cBecause I was a little worried. You know. Our village situation. I hesitated until the end.\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d said Margaret, and she sighed.The name of the village where Lysia lives was the village of rebels.The rebel village did not have an official name because it was a village that was not displayed on the map.When the predecessor Grand Dukes were killed for treason, all the vassals, knights, and employees in the capital were also killed.The village of rebels is the village where their families lived in hiding.The village was completely hidden. Because if it was revealed that he had hidden the rebels all this time time, it would be a blow to Grand Duke Evron.So they decided to live in silence to the end.It was also possible because the years of living while comforting each other with the same pain were not short, and they had already become one community.Only young people were carefully stepping out one by one, reclaiming the family name and starting to find new homes.That is why she has long thought about whether or not to come to greet Artizea.Margaret laughed.\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Because Her Grace already knows about the northern town of Thold.\u201d\u201cYes, I saw you wrote it down on the last letter. I guess His Grace really trusts her.\u201d\u201cWell. At first, I was worried about this and that, too. But he\u2019s really a perfect match to the Grand Duchess. No, it\u2019s much better than that. It should be said that she fits perfectly with the insufficiency of the Grand Duke\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat a relief. \u201c\u201cIt was the best because the Grand Duke is more than anything else.\u201dMargaret laughed.\u201cYou\u2019ll be surprised to see him too. He didn\u2019t look as bright as he does now.\u201d\u201cHe was a bit blunt in my memory, even though he was serious and sweet.\u201d\u201cYes, he has such a sweet face, and I only knew it for the first time. For that alone, I, Aaron, and everyone else are all grateful to the Grand Duchess.\u201dThen Margaret sighed, thinking of Aubrey.Aubrey is too immature. She treated Cedric so familiarly three years ago, and that was acceptabled because she was still young.She is now 18 years old, so she deserves to know up and down. Even Lysia, a few months younger than Aubrey, knows what\u2019s right.Margaret shook her head and looked at Lysia.\u201cAnyway, I was relieved because you came here.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cSo, it\u2019s an issue that has something to do with you. You know that Grand Duchess said that she would choose her lady-in-waiting from among the Grand Duchy?\u201d\u201cYes, because you wrote it in the letter.\u201d\u201cAubrey, she became the first lady-in-waiting of Her Grace.\u201dMargaret was about to lament.Just then, one of the maids ran in haste.\u201cMargaret, we\u2019re in trouble!\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cThat\u2026.\u201dThe maid lowered her voice and explained to Margaret about what Aubrey had done.Margaret became lost in thought.\u201cI\u2019m going to go to the Grand Duchess. Lysia, do you know where your place is?\u201d\u201cYes. I can go alone, so don\u2019t worry.\u201dMargaret hurriedly left the Grand Hall. She was going to see Artizea.Lysia looked around the banquet hall with a moved feeling for a moment.\u201cIt\u2019s nice to be warm.\u201dIn the absence of Cedric, the stronghold\u2019s New Year\u2019s banquet was a small banquet where only those who had time gathered.Remembering when Cedric was there, it wasn\u2019t very beautiful. Although there were many people gathered, the atmosphere was somber and it was always like a memorial service.But today it was different. The decoration is also bright and the band is practicing dance songs.Lysia smiled, saying that it was a good idea to bring her only banquet dress.What kind of person is the Grand Duchess? Her heart was thrilled.***Artizea sat in her armchair, silently waiting for Sophie to return.Alice asked carefully.\u201cAre you angry?\u201d\u201cI wasn\u2019t very angry.\u201dHowever, it seemed clear to her that it wasn\u2019t true.\u201cI really didn\u2019t know Aubrey would do something like this.\u201dThe best thing was for Aubrey to realize her position first.However, she did not seem to admit that she was only in the position of the servant.It was better to make sure if she wanted to rebel. She even thought Aubrey would one day.But she didn\u2019t think Aubrey would hurt Sophie. She thought Aubrey was immature, but she didn\u2019t know it was this much.Sophie returned after the bleeding stopped. The bandages still smudged by a little blood, but her complexion looked much better.Sophie said with an anxious face.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Madam. I shouldn\u2019t have aroused Aubrey\u2019s temper\u2026\u201d\u201cIt was going to explode anytime soon. It\u2019s not your fault.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dSophie said in a crawling voice.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It\u2019s just a slight tear on the skin. It\u2019s not bleeding anymore.\u201d\u201cWill it leave a scar?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be any. It\u2019s nothing. If I just scratched my arm or something, it would have bled too. I have worried you for no reason.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear.\u201dArtizea finally smiled.\u201cWould you please help me with changing my clothes? Normally, you always do it all by yourself, so it\u2019s actually more comfortable.\u201d\u201cYes, Madam.\u201dWhen Aubrey was first hitting her with the jewelry box, Sophie was sad and angry with tears.But she quickly brushed it off. It was better to forget.Aubrey herself was just Count\u2019s Young Lady, but Count Jordyn was different.It is the second family of Evron Grand Duchy. And Aaron and Margaret are the pillars that the Grand Duke\u2019s people rely heavily on.It is natural that the hearts of the people of the stronghold are tilted to their daughter.It was not uncommon for the master\u2019s wife or her lady-in-waiting to beat a maid. Like Miraila. There was never a day for the bruises to fade on the maid\u2019s body.Sophie wasn\u2019t foolish enough to forget her position because Artizea said she would treat her kindly.Artizea never beat her either. She was rather angry and she was worried. That was enough for Sophie.She wished that she wouldn\u2019t be the cause of her precious Madam not getting along with Count Jordyn.Sophie sighed to hide it from Artizea. She brightened her mood and brought a dress.What she prepared was a velvet dress lined with a soft, fine fur leather.\u201cMadam Emily is definitely great. She doesn\u2019t know how cold it will be in the north, so she went and got the help of a local person who told her to make enough cold weather suits inside.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d\u201cI actually thought it might be a little big, but it fit perfectly because I sewed thin fur leather inside.\u201dThe outer material was pale orange with low saturation, and the fur visible on the sleeves and collar was bright barley.\u201cIt\u2019s a New Year\u2019s banquet, so I chose a light color. Your hair is pretty and your skin is white, so you\u2019ll look good in all colors. I feel relieved when a maid like me has to dress you up.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re doing well, Sophie.\u201d\u201cSomeone like me was originally just a maid in the laundry room.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Sophie? If you weren\u2019t good, wouldn\u2019t Madame Emily have been angry already? Our Madam likes you, so she brought you here.\u201dAlice said, helping trim Artizea\u2019s hem. Sophie blushed her face.Artizea looked at the mirror and nodded her head. It was a pretty dress that looked bright and warm.She lifted the shawl on the dressing table. Because it was for winter, there was fur on the part that touched her neck. The ribbon was silk.Sophie wrapped it on Artizea\u2019s neck once around her throat, and she took it off as it didn\u2019t fit.\u201cSophie.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dArtizea put it around Sophie\u2019s neck. Then she took out one of her gold rings and she fixed the shawl with it.\u201cI like the clothes today. I\u2019ll give you a prize.\u201dThat was an excuse. Sophie knows that it\u2019s not because of the clothes, but because of her injury.Artizea did not justify herself.It was strictly because Artizea herself that Sophie got hurt. She knew it for sure.In the end, this is just an act to compensate Sophie\u2019s wounds. It is to replenish wasted loyalty with money.She will not retaliate for Sophie.She will throw Aubrey out. But that\u2019s because that was the goal from the start. Not for Sophie.Regardless of how they felt, Count Jordyn took precedence over Sophie.Had it been necessary to have Aubrey by her side, she would not have shown any anger at all.All people are just numbers. Therefore, this person was just a resource.That was right.So Artisea didn\u2019t say anything else.But Sophie already understood everything.Her eyes turned red.\u201cWell, I\u2019m really okay.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t I say I like the clothes?\u201d\u201cOh, yes, you did.\u201dInstead of wiping away her tears, Artizea gently moved the shawl to fix it properly.And she turned away as if nothing had happened.It was then that Margaret arrived.\u201cGrand Duchess, this is Margaret.\u201dAt the sound of the polite call, Alice opened the door.Margaret came in and knelt on one of her knees instead of saying her usual greetings.Artizea glanced down at her with only her eyes moving.Margaret was nervous as she saw Sophie wiping her tears through her sleeve.Thinking that she is a maid that is not to be ignored. She is one of the most beloved maids brought from Artizea\u2019s family.Aubrey didn\u2019t just hurt her, she threw a jewelry box.Even the jewelry box was left to Aubrey\u2019s care by Artizea. In other words, she threw the mission entrusted by her mistress.In Evron, this was really unforgivable.\u201cI heard that Aubrey has committed a sin. The sin of raising a daughter incorrectly; I know that nothing can absolve that.\u201dMargaret deeply bowed her head and said.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201dShe only hoped that by her own apology, Artizea would relieve Aubrey\u2019s sin by releasing her mind a little.Artizea spoke coldly to her without even giving her a gaze.\u201cDid you find Aubrey?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m looking for her right now.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure you know that Aubrey has been disrespectful to me.\u201d\u201cI have no excuse. Even though Your Grace gave me several opportunities, my child was stupid and immature, so she committed a crime.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not up to me to raise a child. I\u2019m not going to scold you. I\u2019m not even questioning the faithfulness of Count Jordyn.\u201dMargaret only bowed her head.Although Artizea said so, she did not allow her to stand up. It meant that Aubrey\u2019s sins were not forgiven.\u201cAlice, take the box and give it to Margaret.\u201dAlice took the ruined jewelry box on the dressing table and gave it to Margaret.\u201cPlease make sure you get it fixed. As if there was no crack in the first place. If you do that, I will forget it all.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dMargaret\u2019s hand trembled a little.What Artizea was talking about was a box, but it was obvious that it wasn\u2019t just a box.It meant to punish Aubrey on her own so that there was no crack between the Grand Duke and Count Jordyn.And she will forget about it.\u201cThank you for your generosity.\u201dMargaret bowed her head deeply again before stepping back.And she hurriedly called a maid.\u201cI\u2019m ordering everyone to find Aubrey. Tell them that I ordered it, and held her even if she must be tied up by a rope.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cIf she ever enters the banquet hall, make sure that there is nothing noticeable to the Grand Duchess, you must stop her. Let the guards know.\u201d\u201cHah, but, Lady Margaret, then rumors might come out\u2026.\u201d\u201cShe has sinned against Her Grace, the Grand Duchess. Is a rumor a problem now? I\u2019ll have to go for a while. If something happens while I\u2019m preparing for the banquet, I\u2019ll send someone.\u201d\u201cYes. \u201cMargaret curled up her hem and headed out in a hurry.\u2018Stupid think.\u2019Becoming the lady-in-waiting of the Grand Duchess was Artizea giving Aubrey a chance.She kicked the opportunity and she proved herself disrespectful. Now Aubrey would never again be able to rise to a high position within Evron Grand Duchy.***Emotionally, Aubrey\u2019s work itself was a trivial matter for Artizea. The long dragging of Count Jordyn was over.What was left was the New Year\u2019s banquet.Artizea was escorted by Cedric and headed to the Grand Hall.Even though it was a large banquet hall with high ceilings, it was warmly heated.Expensive white charcoal furnaces were placed everywhere. There were so many candlesticks placed everywhere that they would brighten up even the darkest of night if lit.To reflect the light, about a hundred glasses were placed close to each other.To hide the dark tapestry and create a bright atmosphere, the long hanging purple and white silk fabrics were lined here and there.It is incomparable to the splendid banquet in the capital, but it was magnificent and luxurious enough.As the two entered, the attendees stood up and bowed.Cedric led Artizea to the top of the table and made a light greeting with his servants.The servants diligently carried the glasses. Bubble wine produced in the East was served in long-necked glasses and distributed to everyone.Artizea also received a glass. Cedric whispered in a small voice.\u201cIf you can\u2019t drink it, you don\u2019t have to.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. \u201cArtizea didn\u2019t enjoy alcohol and was weak, but she could drink at least a glass of wine.Cedric said while standing.\u201cI\u2019m glad to see this new year with everyone for the first time in 3 years. Thank you for protecting Evron in the meantime. I don\u2019t know how many times I\u2019ve been saying the same greeting, but I\u2019m saying it again.\u201dA little laughter spread like a wave.\u201cA lot of things will change in the future. But I hope that next year, we can all celebrate the new year together, staying the same as we do now.\u201d\u201cNo! I\u2019m going to marry too!\u201dOne of the knights shouted. But he was beaten and sunk down, as the people asked him what the hell he was talking about.So this time Cedric laughed.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, because it\u2019s always welcome to expand your family. Now, then.\u201dCedric raised the glass.\u201cFor a life of honor!\u201d\u201cFor the glory of Evron!\u201dFollowing Cedric\u2019s call, the attendees shouted in unison.\u201cFor the Grand Duchess!\u201dThe guy who wanted to stand out, once again shouted a different cheer by himself, and was beaten and sank again.Cedric just laughed because it was a yearly event.Then he turned to Artizea, struck his cup lightly against hers, and he emptied it.Artizea emptied her glass and sat down.The hearth under her chair was warm and made her feel comfortable.Aaron came up first and offered a tribute.\u201cCongratulations on the new year. I wish there will be better news this year.\u201d\u201cThank you. It\u2019s all thanks to you. But what about Margaret?\u201dAaron being alone, made Cedric puzzledly asked. Aaron sneaked a glance at Artizea.Artizea said calmly, as she had no intention of blaming Aaron and Margaret.\u201cSomething happened a while ago, so she said she\u2019d be leaving. She can greet us later.\u201dCedric nodded his head. Then he realized that Aubrey wasn\u2019t there either.He passed it by, thinking that Artizea had entrusted her to do something and let it go.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Those who met Artizea for the first time congratulated their wedding and even gave gifts.Words of blessing and laughter bloomed. Artizea was enjoying it, smiling in a slightly unfamiliar mood.She seemed to understand why Cedric considered Evron Grand Duchy as his home and his vassals and the people as his family.The Imperial Palace\u2019s New Year\u2019s banquet is an extension of the political and social world. It would have been the same for Miraila and Lawrence.Surrounded by countless people, she was struggling to read the true intentions of people who were coming and going.Miraila, drunk with alcohol, woke up in the evening on the first day of the year. Lawrence was more often buried in a second feast of debauchery in a woman\u2019s house.So, there was no such a thing as a New Year\u2019s banquet in the Marquisate of Rosan. This is because there was no one to share good words and wishes.This was probably a family-like atmosphere.It was strange and unfamiliar to Artizea that she was naturally involved in it, because she never thought it was acceptable to her.It\u2019s not really hers.But it wasn\u2019t something she wasn\u2019t allowed to participate. Because she will be a part of this even if she divorces and sits down in the seat of the servant.As she thought so, she felt happy and heartbroken.It was then.She felt the air in the banquet hall changing. Artizea looked around.Lysia was just entering the banquet hall.As if she had been running in a hurry, she was holding the hem of her skirt together. Her clothes were a simple but fine violet-colored dress.Maybe she hadn\u2019t had time to do her hair, she just braided her hair aside. There was no makeup on her face.But she was more beautiful than anyone in this place. An overflowing light shimmered around her.Lysia\u2019s beauty was different from that of Miraila.It was hard to say where she was pretty. It can be said that the light from her heart and the lively movement are beautiful.\u2018Lysia\u2026\u2026\u2019As Artizea held her breath, she thought blankly.Lysia immediately approached the two. She politely knelt down on one knee.\u201cI\u2019m sorry for being late, Your Grace. I am relieved that you are in constant health.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time, Lysia. You\u2019ve grown a lot. But are you alone? What about Baron Morten?\u201d\u201cMy father is refraining from going out because his legs are uncomfortable in winter. This winter, I decided to come as the village representative instead.\u201d\u201cI see. Are you now eighteen?\u201d\u201cYes, I had my birthday last month.\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re eighteen, you\u2019re old enough.\u201dCedric said so in a complicated mood.And he looked back and gently introduced her to Artizea.\u201cLysia is the daughter of the Morten family. She is from the village you know.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m Lysia of Baron Morten. It\u2019s an honor to meet you, Grand Duchess. And, although it\u2019s late, congratulations on your marriage.\u201dLysia stood up and she turned her body towards Artizea. And she again knelt on her knees in front of Artizea politely.Lysia\u2019s lips touched over the ring of the Grand Duchess she was wearing. It was a sign of loyalty and obedience.Artizea knows that her heart has been crushed, so she can\u2019t answer for a while. Her ring felt as hot as if burning.\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you, Lysia.\u201dThe tip of her tongue became heavy calling her name.[If there is a next world and I can live once more, then I hope you can call me Lysia by then.]It really did.But what kind of relationship did Lysia hope for at that time?Artizea stood up, grabbed Lysia\u2019s hand and raised it up. She shouldn\u2019t have had to kneel to her.\u201cBring a chair.\u201dThe servant who was waiting near her heard that, and quickly brought a chair.She placed it next to Artizea. Lysia was embarrassed.\u201cThank you, Grand Duchess. But I can\u2019t sit in a seat like this\u2026.\u201d\u201cSit down. It\u2019s okay. I need someone to talk to.\u201dArtizea said so with a soft, calm voice.It was difficult to talk to Lysia as if she were treating a subordinate, but she shouldn\u2019t look strange to others.Lysia\u2019s cheek redded with joy.\u201cThank you, Grand Duchess.\u201dShe felt guilty.In her previous life, she was unable to protect Lysia. Cedric asked her the first and last time, but she couldn\u2019t do anything.She couldn\u2019t even tell Cedric Lysia\u2019s last word.Lysia forgave her, but Artizea could not forgive herself.What did she think when she came back to the past and opened her eyes? As she offered a candle to the saint, what did she wish for?She will protect her this time.She thought so.She thought of giving her all that she had stolen. She tried to give her back what she deserves.She intended to make her the empress.She actually wanted to meet her earlier. She ought to go and apologize for her mistake.This was not possible because the place where Lysia lived was the village of the rebels.She told Cedric that she knew about this place from the start.But she couldn\u2019t find it easily. It was the most sensitive area in Evron, which is closed to outsiders.It was better to wait to meet naturally and bring her to her side.It was a rational conclusion.Apart from that, however, Artizea knew that her own heart was completely unjust.One day, two days, she delayed meeting Lysia.She could have asked Margaret to call her to come naturally. She has already said that she will choose her lady-in-waiting among the vassals of the Grand Duchy.She also knew that Margaret had made her own list of girls Artizea\u2019s age. So, she could choose Lysia among them and ask Margaret to bring her here.But she didn\u2019t.Artizea newly realized her own inferiority.She just wished that she would be allowed to be by Cedric\u2019s side a little longer. She must have been slowing down with such an unscrupulous mind.She knew for herself that she did.She couldn\u2019t control her mind and she was obsessed with Cedric. She felt foolish and she couldn\u2019t stand it.Her heart was sore and painful. She originally felt like the world was getting darker just by thinking that she would lose the affection, even if it wasn\u2019t hers.However, it\u2019s not up to her to decide.She knew this wasn\u2019t the place where she would sit. It was Lysia\u2019s seat.It\u2019s only for 2 years, she only needs to sit for a while before she has to give it back.She knew.She then felt as if the time she had with him would go on forever. She hoped so.Then her thoughts of Lysia finally stopped.The band began to play dance songs.Cedric stood up and reached out to Artizea.Artizea looked at the hand in a feeling of hopelessness.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201dEveryone was looking at them.It was customary for the first dance to be held by the host or the top person.She placed her trembling hand on Cedric\u2019s. Cedric held her hand and led her with a soft, natural touch.This was the fourth dance.Once at Lysia\u2019s wedding, once at Count Enda\u2019s ball, and once at the wedding.All three times, Cedric kept the distance respectfully.They had a conversation and came close enough to see the shade on the lashes.However, he kept to all the manners he had to obey.There was never a force in his hand that held her. The only thing that supported Artizea\u2019s body was his arm.While leading Artizea, who was not good at dancing, he never touched her body even though she made a mistake.But today it was different.His hand on Artizea\u2019s back came deeper than it was.Instead of politely touching her back to support her, he naturally wrapped her waist around him.When Artizea put her arm on his shoulder, it was as if it were in his arms.And Artizea was compelled to admit that, just as she was accustomed to be in his embrace, her own body was already used to leaning against his arm.But she couldn\u2019t dare dance like this in front of Lysia\u2019s eyes.Cedric, who misunderstood the reason Artizea hesitated, said in a smiling voice.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. If you make a mistake, I\u2019ll cover it up. You know I\u2019m good at dancing, right?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not worried about that.\u201dArtizea muttered in a split voice.\u201cI will make you the most beautiful dancer in the world.\u201dCedric assured her. Then he led Artizea and slipped into the middle of the banquet hall.***Aubrey was near the banquet hall.Eventually, Margaret failed to find Aubrey first.Aubrey is also someone that has lived in the stronghold since birth. It wasn\u2019t just a day or two where she ran to hide after a scuffle with her mother.Aubrey went home and hurriedly, getting mad at her close maid and changed into the most gorgeous dress she had.It was a dress that had gold thread embroidered Iantz embroidery around the hem of the rich skirt, and spread around the chest.Margaret said she hated the clothes because it overflowed. It was made by designers from the capital and it cost quite a bit. Aaron thought that his youngest daughter was cute so he gave anything to her and was able to make the dress.She wore it, ran through her mother\u2019s jewelry and wore the most expensive ruby \u200b\u200bnecklace of Count Jordyn.In her opinion, today\u2019s self was pretty. And it was mature.At this point, she thought she would be able to draw attention of the banquet hall.But Aubrey couldn\u2019t even get into the banquet hall.\u201cThere was an order from Countess Jordyn that you could not enter the banquet hall.\u201dThe guard did not know the details.Aubrey had always had a small incident, so he only thought it would be like that this time.\u201cPlease wait here for a minute, Miss Aubrey.\u201dThrough the blocked door, Aubrey saw Artizea dancing her waltz in Cedric\u2019s arms.The hem of the heavy skirt spreads out like a flower and goes round and round with the fur inside.\u2018Damn it.. Damn it, damn it, damn it!\u2019Aubrey clenched her teeth. It felt as if Artizea had taken her place.She turned around and ran out.\u201cOh, Miss Aubrey!\u201dThe guard shouted.There was a command to catch Aubrey, but the guards thought it was the usual mother-daughter fight.In Evron, there was always a problem with Karam and the mainland of the Empire, but there was never a problem with the people in the castle\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Whenever the hem of her skirt spread out like a flower petal, she felt a fluttering in her heart, and it was painful.Artizea turned away from it.\u2018I can do well.\u2019Because she has confidence in being patient.Don\u2019t let your heart flutter.So that he can\u2019t hear the pounding sound of her heart.She will be able to do well.As she stood up, Cedric asked, holding her hand.\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to get some fresh air.\u201dArtizea consciously pressed her face and replied.She took her hand out of Cedric\u2019s hand.When she was held, it felt as if she couldn\u2019t get out.But when she tried to pull out her hand with strength, his entangled hand had no strength. She slipped out easily.Cedric stood up after her.\u201cThe air is not good.\u201d\u201cYou stay here. The master must not leave.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Everyone is enjoying themselves.\u201dThe atmosphere was happily bustling.Unimaginable numbers of bottles of alcohol had been emptied in Artizea\u2019s honor. People danced in the hall to the cheerful dancing music and enjoyed it.It wasn\u2019t elegant, but it was a pleasant banquet. Even if Cedric is away for a while, the atmosphere won\u2019t go away.But Artizea got embarrassed. She went out on the excuse of getting a fresh air, but she was thinking of going back.\u201cRather, how about dancing with the lady here?\u201dLysia stood up in confusion.\u201cIf the Grand Duchess allows, I\u2019ll take the Grand Duke on board.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not possible to leave the banquet hall without dancing once. Did you go out even after receiving a dance request because of me?\u201dArtizea said so with her smile. Lysia shook her head.\u201cI\u2019m not good at dancing, and I don\u2019t like it.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s better. He makes people like me dance quite nicely, so take this opportunity to learn.\u201dArtizea said so and went outside.Alice, who was waiting behind her, quickly put a fur cape on her shoulder.\u201cMadam, why are you doing that?\u201d\u201cWhat did I do?\u201dAlice couldn\u2019t answer because she hesitated.It feels like Artizea is leaving Cedric to Lysia, but when she thinks about it, perhaps she said it because she was right next to her.Cedric, who had been stunned for a moment, rushed to her way.\u201cTia.\u201dAt the call, Artizea stopped her pace.Cedric came by.\u201cAre you angry?\u201d\u201cDo I look angry?\u201dArtizea asked in a calm voice. Cedric could not answer.She didn\u2019t appear to be angry. She looked sad.\u201cTia.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just a little tired. Why would I be angry when nothing happened?\u201d\u201cAre you all right?\u201dCedric reached out. Artizea took a half step back. Cedric paused his hand and then lowered it.Artizea said softly.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019m fine. It\u2019s already past midnight, and now I want to rest.\u201dIt was the same attitude and tone as usual.Cedric didn\u2019t want to stop her because she wanted to rest.She had celebrated and danced. At other times, she would be tired, so he would have told her to go back and rest.But she was different now. He realized that something was wrong.However, he couldn\u2019t even guess what the problem was.\u201cI\u2019ll take you to your room.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Go back. If both of us are missing, the people will be anxious.\u201dArtizea said so and she turned her back. Alice bowed her head as if sorry to Cedric, and quickly followed Artizea.Cedric watched until her back disappeared.Artizea never looked back at him and went all the way to the end of the hallway and climbed the stairs.Cedric sighed and turned back to the banquet hall, where Lysia appeared.\u201cDid Her Grace leave? Is she okay?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201dCedric sighed again. Lysia approached him, she asked.\u201cDid I make a mistake?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think so. You have nothing to worry about. If you had done something wrong, she would have definitely rebuked it.\u201d\u201cBut isn\u2019t she angry?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know that either. She\u2019s a person who doesn\u2019t show her heart. Anyway, it\u2019s not your problem.\u201dCedric wiped his face once.If he did something wrong\u2026.. But even when he looked back, he couldn\u2019t guess what he had done wrong.Lysia smiled.\u201cI guess you really like her.\u201dCedric blushed his face a little. Lysia laughed out loud.\u201cActually, my father was worried a lot. He heard rumors about dating or something like that, but he still didn\u2019t believe it. He thought it would be an arranged marriage.\u201d\u201cWell. \u201c\u201cThere were many people unsettled by Her Grace\u2019s mother. My father was very concerned about your situation.\u201cBecause Baron Morten thinks it\u2019s better for me not to be involved in central politics.\u201d\u201cYes, I thought you were trying to get involved in the fight for the succession to the throne.\u201d\u201cDid you come to check that?\u201d\u201cWhat am I supposed to confirm? I just thought that if you were to be in Lord Lawrence\u2019s faction, we\u2019d better hide deeper in our village. I\u2019m still young and I\u2019m a girl of her age, so I came because I thought it wouldn\u2019t be obvious. I didn\u2019t know you had already told her everything.\u201d\u201cWhen it comes to your village, Tia knew even if I didn\u2019t say anything.\u201dLysia swallowed her breath.\u201cIf the villagers know, it will be a big deal.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to worry about. Even if it\u2019s known, I\u2019m trying to get my head in politics so that it doesn\u2019t matter when it\u2019s known.\u201dCedric said.\u201cWhat do you think rather than that?\u201d\u201cAbout the Grand Duchess? Or, about Your Grace getting into politics?\u201cBoth.\u201d\u201cWhat does someone like me know?\u201dCedric smiled. And he beckoned Lysia to follow him this way. This is because it was inappropriate to stand at the door of the banquet hall and have a conversation.Lysia came to his side with a quick pace. The two walked towards the corridor for a while.\u201cBecause your intuition is good since you were very young. You are wise beyond your age.\u201dLysia\u2019s wisdom was a different kind from Artizea\u2019s acuity.She looked through lies as if she had the eyes of truth. Even for things that seem to be shifting and not clear at first glance, she pointed out the right direction intuitively, rather than logically.Lysia said.\u201cNot getting involved is a different way of getting involved in politics. Even the Evron Grand Duchy can\u2019t help but be influenced by what the next emperor is like. If that\u2019s the case, would it be better to choose the right person and support him?\u201dIt was much less compared to Artizea\u2019s judgment that even if she chose someone else to join the faction, she would eventually have to keep him in check.Cedric thought Artizea\u2019s judgment was right.However, Lysia\u2019s words were also worth listening to.This is what she said without knowing anything about the central politics. This would be one of the thoughts of the rebel villagers.For Cedric, that was also an important issue.Lysia said.\u201cAnd you\u2019re not married for it anyway. Your Majesty has been with someone you like, so I think that\u2019s enough.\u201dCedric coughed for nothing.Lysia asked in amazement.\u201cIsn\u2019t it so from the perspective of Your Grace?\u201cI didn\u2019t get married for political gain like what the Baron Morten or you thought, but as the rumor goes\u2026 I married because I fell in love.\u201dHe knew this marriage was mutually beneficial. He was also dependent on her resourcefulness.However, one of the reasons he initially accepted the contract marriage was that he thought he would protect her until she reached adulthood.The right to inherit the throne as Artizea said is just a later thing. He didn\u2019t take it seriously.And two years later, he knew that Artizea would divorce and end up with a separation.Cedric sighed.Lysia looked at him curiously.\u201cYou like her now. Wasn\u2019t that enough? Is Her Grace\u2019s heart different?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not that simple. Tia is still young.\u201d\u201cThe age difference, it isn\u2019t that much? The age difference between my parents will be twice that between Your Graces.\u201d\u201cBut Tia is still 18.\u201dCedric has already accepted in his heart.But age is not just a number. It also marks the stage of life that a person must overcome.And the 18-year-old girl did not stand on the same stairs as Cedric. It is separate from the difference in numbers.Artizea finally escaped from her cruel house and began to live her own life.She had a sharp reason and keen judgment. She looked through the heart of a person, and looked deeper and wider into the world with a vision that no one else had ever thought of.But she was clumsy with her own feelings. She only knew how to put up with it.So he thought he had to be careful.Approaching her as a man, needs to wait after a little more time\u2026 This is what Artizea could do after experiencing life some more. Now, he just has to settle for giving her a friendly heart.But Cedric keeps forgetting it these days.Until now, he had considered himself a self-controlled person. And he realized that he had overestimated himself.\u201cYour Grace stood at the front line of the Thold Gate as the Master of Evron for the first time when you were 16, and by 18 you are already a warrior. Your Grace is already doing your job as the master and the Grand Duke. And I\u2019m embarrassed to say it myself, but I am still here as a representative of Morten and the village.\u201d\u201cBecause I wish you hadn\u2019t grown up so fast, for you and Tia even more so.\u201d\u201cBut you don\u2019t look at the Grand Duchess as a child at all, right?\u201d\u201cI have nothing to say.\u201d\u201cThen what can I do, you already like her.\u201dCedric again covered his eyes with his hands. His earlobes are red.\u201cDon\u2019t make fun of me.\u201dLysia laughed.\u201cPlease take care of Tia. She seems to like you. Tia doesn\u2019t have any friends, and she doesn\u2019t have any chance to get along with her peers.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s an honor for me to be called by her side.\u201dCedric smiled and patted her hair lightly. It was the same attitude as when he was younger.\u201cThank you.\u201dAnd he went back to the banquet hall first.Lysia paused in thought for a moment, then she slowly turned around.Then, Aubrey, who had red eyes, made eye contact.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

What are you doing there?\u201d(T/N: Lysia calls Aubrey as \u2018older sister\u2019 or \u2018\uc5b8\ub2c8\u2019)Lysia and Aubrey were cousins. Even if she did not live nearby, there was a degree of exchange.When Lysia was young, they were closer. Because she grew up in the stronghold, left to Margaret\u2019s hands to learn the manners and culture of the nobility.However, even though they were the same age, the two were never close.Lysia said.\u201cI didn\u2019t see you in the banquet hall. I heard that you became a lady-in-waiting of the Grand Duchess\u2026\u201dAubrey came out to the place where the light of the lantern was reaching. Lysia frowned at her.Aubrey\u2019s clothes and makeup were excessively luxurious. Artizea\u2019s was elegant and luxurious, but not excessive, so the difference was even more noticeable.It\u2019s okay if Aubrey herself is the main character, but this was a New Year\u2019s banquet.If Aubrey had entered the banquet hall as is, she would have become the lady-in-waiting who has more colorful clothes than her mistress.Aubrey said sharply.\u201cThat woman stopped me from entering the banquet hall.\u201dLysia couldn\u2019t understand who Aubrey was talking about. It was because she never thought she would call the Grand Duchess in words like \u2018that woman\u2019.Not in the mood to ask who and what had happened, she said as if evading.\u201c\u2026. Aunt Margaret was looking for you.\u201d\u201cWhat did you talk to His Grace?\u201d\u201cWe didn\u2019t talk much. I just listened to his story a little because it seemed that the Grand Duke had a problem.\u201d\u201cWhy to you?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s probably because I was nearby at the moment he wanted to talk.\u201dPerhaps the most important thing Cedric wanted to say was to take care of Artizea.It may also be because he hoped that Lysia, as the representative of the rebel\u2019s village, would not be anxious. He reminded her that he was not married in order to intervene with Lawrence\u2019s succession to the throne.But Lysia didn\u2019t say that in detail.It was because Aubrey wasn\u2019t having a normal expression.Aubrey questioned her with a hoarse voice.\u201cIs it because of that woman?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIs it because of that woman? Yes. I knew it. He\u2019s a wise man, so even if he was seduced for a moment, he would have immediately noticed what kind of person she is. Did he say anything about me?\u201dLysia then realized that she was referring to Artizea.\u201cYou don\u2019t mean \u2018that woman\u2019 as the Grand Duchess, are you?\u201d\u201cWhy? Did I say something wrong? Then, should I praise a woman like that?\u201d\u201cSister Aubrey, how dare you say that?\u201d\u201cDid I say something I couldn\u2019t? Do you mean because she\u2019s the Marchioness of Rosan? Who doesn\u2019t know that the woman\u2019s mother is the Emperor\u2019s mistress? She claimed she was the daughter of the predecessor Marquis, but no one knows her birth father?\u201d\u201cSister, be careful what you say.\u201d\u201cWell, she\u2019s not an ordinary prostitute. She\u2019s that kind of woman. What did she learn?\u201d\u201cYou have insulted not only the Grand Duchess but also the Grand Duke!\u201dLysia raised her voice.\u201cStop pretending to be good. It\u2019s disgusting.\u201dAubrey looked at Lysia with a disgusted face.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you want me to say that she\u2019s not a good person? Because she\u2019s above me? What kind of woman is she?\u201dAubrey said in a voice filled with resentment.Artizea had to respect her.Isn\u2019t that what the Evron Grand Duchess should do? She must, of course, adapt to the people of the Grand Duchy and respect Count Jordyn.Even Cedric respects Aaron and Margaret. He himself considers Aubrey like a family.But Artizea kept her standing endlessly, and treated her no more than a furniture. She made Aubrey be ignored by the maids, and even Cedric stopped paying her attention.How can she do this to her, a descendant of the noble Count Jordyn?\u201cThe Grand Duke always said he would choose the best suit for Evron. But is that prostitute good enough for Evron?\u201d\u201cSo, if she has an inappropriate qualification as the Grand Duchess, and sister knows about it and speaks for His Grace, why can\u2019t you tell His Grace directly? Now go into the banquet hall and give advice to His Grace, the Grand Duke, in front of everyone.\u201dLysia pointed to the banquet hall. Aubrey raised her voice.\u201cThat\u2019s because she forbids me from going to the banquet!\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s it. You couldn\u2019t come out even though His Grace was here a while ago.\u201dLysia said sharply.\u201cIf you come through the official route to give advice, there is no way that the Grand Duchess will reject it. Instead, you insult, criticize and curse her behind her back.\u201d\u201cThis, this!\u201dAubrey raised her hand in anger.Lysia clasped Aubrey\u2019s wrist before it slapped her in the cheek. And she said coldly.\u201cDon\u2019t even think about it, sister Aubrey.\u201d\u201cLet go!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s because you\u2019re jealous. If you think about it, you\u2019ll get the answer right away.\u201dAubrey\u2019s face was stained with anger and shame. Her hair stood on top.Lysia then said.\u201cHis Grace has undeservedly loved you like his own sister. But that\u2019s because your parents, aunt and uncle have sincerely served His Grace. It\u2019s not that sister was special.\u201d\u201cI told you to let go of me! You do whatever you want, you can crawl to her in a servile manner.\u201d\u201cGrand Duchess is someone who doesn\u2019t need your approval. Because she is the mistress of this land that the Grand Duke has chosen himself.\u201dAubrey went wild trying to get rid of Lysia\u2019s hand, but she couldn\u2019t beat Lysia at her strength.Lysia held her tight, she said.\u201cI can\u2019t let you go. I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re going to do. As long as you insulted her by making a noise like this, it\u2019s not just about you. I can\u2019t let you cause any more trouble to the Grand Duke.\u201dAubrey was struggling and her hair was all loose and messy. A silver pin with a flower in her hair fell to the floor. Her face and ears were also reddened.The fuss grew. Soon after hearing the news that the two were fighting, Margaret ran.Margaret saw Aubrey\u2019s appearance and took her by the shoulder, dismayed by the view.Lysia released her hand and sighed long. Her arms were stiff.\u201cAubrey, what the hell did you do, where did you go?\u201d\u201cOh! Mom! Why are you even like this, Mom!\u201d\u201cGo!\u201dMargaret grabbed Aubrey\u2019s wrist.\u201cWhat did I do wrong? I can\u2019t accept that such a prostitute is His Grace\u2019s companion!\u201dAubrey yelled. Margaret hurriedly closed Aubrey\u2019s mouth, but the sound rang throughout the hallway.The servants and the maids were frightened, each bowed their heads. They pretended not to hear anything and left.***Thud!The door was roughly closed.Aubrey, who was left alone, swung around the room, huffing and puffing.Margaret dragged her to the temple, not to the Jordyn Estate.She was afraid that if she took Aubrey to the Mansion, she would be said to protect Aubrey.The temple was chosen because there are many vacancies, it\u2019s a public place, and not a prison.Even during the day, she didn\u2019t know things would go this far.However, the rant in the hallway today couldn\u2019t be tolerated. She couldn\u2019t even imagine how much worse she had said in front of Lysia,She couldn\u2019t cover it by sending her quietly to a country cottage anymore.[The Jordyn family has been the vassal of the Grand Duke until now, and has been trusted by His Grace as well. To your mom and your dad, that was our lifelong pride. In such a case, you will destroy our family. I can\u2019t let that happen.][What did I do wrong? What\u2019s the big deal about a maid injured?][With you as the lady-in-waiting, you threw the mission entrusted by the Grand Duchess to the floor and wounded the head of her favorite maid. In addition to that, unforgivable abusive remarks about the Grand Duchess. If you were a member of the Knights, you would have lost your neck on the spot.]Margaret said with a suffocating face.[How did I raise my child like this.][I haven\u2019t done anything wrong. I don\u2019t think I said anything I couldn\u2019t.][When the snow stops, go to the convent. Don\u2019t come out of there forever and live reflecting on yourself.][Mom!][How fortunate are you that Her Grace will forgive you just by removing you from her sight?]Margaret said so, and she shut the door. She ordered servants to watch Aubrey in two shifts.Aubrey couldn\u2019t beat them. Although she is angry at Artizea, she is also angry with Lysia.Why did Cedric not say a word to her, but he was telling Lysia that?It was then.The door opened.\u201cWho is it!\u201dAubrey shouted sharply. The two fallen servants collapsed inside the door.It was a young man with fiery red hair who kicked the servants. Three or four armed men entered after him.\u201cWh\u2026 who are you?\u201dAubrey was terrified.The man was wearing a short sword and had a tanned face. At first glance, he was not a northerner.The man pulled a chair and sat down and smiled.\u201cI\u2019m from the South Sea. I came up without knowing the northern weather, and got tied up. Thankfully, the temple took pity on me and gave me accommodation.\u201d\u201cLies.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a foreign identity, but it\u2019s true that my feet were tied because I didn\u2019t know the northern weather well, and it was true that the temple felt sorry. Sit down, Lady Jordyn. I didn\u2019t come to harm the Lady.\u201dAubrey slowly relaxed.Well, what wickedness could that man do here?This is no ordinary place, but a temple of the stronghold.\u201cThat\u2019s bold. No. I\u2019m not condemning it. That\u2019s exactly what I like. You need guts to negotiate.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s your purpose? What are you going to negotiate?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m here to get my woman back. I think the Lady can help with that.\u201d\u201cYour woman?\u201dThe man laughed.\u201cExactly, I\u2019m trying to get my girl back. It\u2019s amazing to hear the news when I\u2019m on my way to propose and she married another guy.\u201dAubrey trembled. This is because she realized that the man was talking about Artizea.Isn\u2019t that so? Artizea and her maids are the only foreigners in Evron\u2019s stronghold.She is the only one who could have a relationship with a man from the South Sea.\u201cThat woman, she\u2019s a really funny woman. You mean she married the Grand Duke with a lover aside?\u201dThe man did not answer the question and smiled and said.\u201cLady Jordyn. Rumor has it that the Lady hates the Grand Duchess quite a bit\u2026. Will our purpose be quite aligned?\u201dAubrey nodded her head without thinking.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

If she was the successor to Baron Morten, her status and position would be appropriate for the lady-in-waiting of the Grand Duchess. Her age was also the same.In addition, Artizea showed her more than usual favors from the start.Artizea gave Lysia a room next to her. She also attached three personal maids.She picked the best of her own clothes, repaired them, and even presented them as a gift to Lysia.There were quite a few clothes in her closet that she hadn\u2019t worn yet, and in Evron Grand Duchy it was hard to get a fine cloth. Even though they have the money.Lysia refused, bewildered.\u201cYou can\u2019t give it all to me like this, Grand Duchess. Besides, these clothes were a gift from the Grand Duke\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I know it\u2019s not polite to give what you have received as a gift to others. This is all I bought separately, so I hope you don\u2019t mind and accept it.\u201dArtizea said so.\u201cBecause my lady-in-waiting\u2019s outfit is related to my status as well.\u201dLysia looked embarrassed, but she accepted it gratefully.In fact, she only had one or two dresses, so she needed such consideration in order to stand next to Artizea.Baron Morten is poor. The village of the rebels itself was like that as well.It was supported by the Evron Grand Duchy. However, creating a village cost a lot of money. They had to avoid the imperial eyes, too. They couldn\u2019t guarantee a generous life.Lysia wasn\u2019t very interested in luxury from the beginning.So it was Artizea\u2019s desire to put her in fine clothes and hang jewels around her neck.At times Artizea felt skeptical, she seemed to be trying to compensate for her guilt that way.But she had no reason to hold back her desire to do so.At least as much as she received from Cedric, it was right to repay it to Lysia. It was originally Lysia\u2019s.Artizea also sent a person to the Baron Morten. It was to help Lysia bring any items she needed and to take care of Baron Morten\u2019s affairs.Naturally, the maids became polite to Lysia. It was because unlike Aubrey\u2019s time, they realized that Lysia was going to be the second-in-command.She wasn\u2019t able to return after the New Year\u2019s banquet, so she wrote a letter to her father.[To my father,I am doing well. I\u2019m sure you heard the news that I\u2019m now working as the Grand Duchess\u2019 lady-in-waiting.I apologize for not being able to discuss it in advance because it is sudden.However, for the Grand Duchess, there is no other lady-in-waiting at the moment, so I cannot leave her. As it was, Aubrey would have been there, but she made a mistake and was kicked out.Many were afraid because Count Jordyn\u2019s daughter had been kicked out.But in two or three days, everyone understood the situation and the stronghold quickly returned to normal. Her Grace, thankfully, did not hold aunt Margaret or uncle Aaron accountable.I think it\u2019s because she favored me as a lady-in-waiting.The Grand Duchess is cool, but she is a dignified and elegant person. She has certain rewards and punishments to match her authority.It was the same this time, the Grand Duke didn\u2019t interfere with the work of the Grand Duchess.Evron has never had a mistress for too long. At first, everyone felt a little confused, but now it is ordinary.According to Aunt Margaret, even though she stood by the predecessor Grand Duchess, she was married young, and she was sick all the time and died early.Besides, the Grand Duchess is full of wit and intelligence. The officials are afraid and respectful because she has already discovered problems with the territory many times in unexpected places.Above all else, she loves and trusts the Grand Duke.She\u2019s not far from politics, but she doesn\u2019t seem to be the one who will pull the Grand Duchy into a political battle, as my father concerns.The Grand Duke did not marry for that purpose.If there is anything I am anxious about, it is that the Grand Duchess is undeservedly too generous to me.I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t live up to expectations, and I\u2019m worried that I won\u2019t be able to return the loyalty and favor as much as she has given me.Her Grace is planning to pick up only the loyal subjects of the Grand Duchy and bring in two more ladies-in-waiting. When that time comes, I\u2019ll go home once.Lysia.]As Lysia was finalizing her letter, Artizea came into the room.Lysia quickly stood up from her seat. Rize put the tea tray down on the table.\u201cJust sit down. Are you writing a letter?\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m done.\u201dLysia shook the letter to dry the ink, fold it, and press it on one side.And she quickly opened the lid of the tea container.\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201dArtizea asked. Lysia blushed her face.\u201cIf you allow it.\u201d\u201cYes, you may.\u201dArtizea said so as she sat down.Lysia wasn\u2019t very good at pouring tea.She first scooped the tea leaves with the tea spoon and transferred it to the teapot. Her hand, pouring the hot water, trembled.When Artizea did it, it was very simple and beautifully done.But she didn\u2019t know why it was so difficult when she did it herself. It was even more so when someone was watching.\u201cYou just have to practice slowly.\u201dSaid Artizea.\u201cIn a warm area, it is said that thinning the water stream and dropping it from a high place makes the water softer, but in this place the water cools down. It is natural that you are not used to it.\u201d\u201cBecause we didn\u2019t have all the tools at our house.\u201dLysia said. In her childhood she was educated. However, she did not actually have a chance to practice.\u201cI\u2019ll learn it thoroughly before the winter passes.\u201dLysia knew that Artizea brought tea these days to teach her and do it in front of her.When Artizea heard the words, she smiled faintly.\u201cI don\u2019t think that the beauty that the social world demands is indicative of the dignity of the person and the culture.\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cBut, the one who cares can reduce the risk of being attacked. Because it is related not only to themselves, but also to the eye of the person who chose them.\u201dArtizea said so, thinking about the time when Lysia became Empress.She is the Saint Empress and will receive the love and support of the whole empire.However, it was the imperial socialite where Lysia really had to live.Being the daughter of Baron Morten was one of the factors that made her an easy target.The pious ladies sided with her, but not a few laughed at her for not being educated because Lysia was from a rural village.Of course, Lysia wasn\u2019t sorrowed or saddened by that.Still, it was not bad to reduce her weakness in advance.Lysia took Artizea\u2019s words completely differently. She thought that \u2018the person who chose her\u2019 was not Cedric, but Artizea.She smiled.\u201cYes, I will practice hard and become a lady who will not embarrass you.\u201dArtizea looked at her with a slightly surprised expression. And she lowered her gaze down.\u201cI\u2019m grateful that you treated me with a sincere favor.\u201d\u201cWhy do you say that when it\u2019s a natural thing?\u201d\u201cActually, I thought I couldn\u2019t help it if you were a little more stubborn. Aubrey was rude to you and was disloyal to the Grand Duchy, but you think that\u2019s normal.\u201dArtizea sighed lightly.\u201cIt\u2019s foolish, of course, that Aubrey couldn\u2019t hide her true intentions, but I think her punishment could be enough. That\u2019s why Count Jordyn wasn\u2019t penalized for it.\u201d\u201cYour Grace is mistaken. You being the Grand Duke\u2019s choice is enough to receive our loyalty and love.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cI think it was a very good choice.\u201dLysia put her hand on her chest and said politely. And she smiled.\u201cBut, even if Your Grace was not the kind of mistress that the people of the Grand Duchy wanted\u2026 I would have been very happy.\u201d\u201cLysia\u2026.\u201d\u201cBecause then His Grace would choose not for his responsibility, but for his own happiness.\u201dArtizea turned her head away to hide her trembling sigh.Although she was sincerely happy with Lysia\u2019s words, she felt the pain that felt like a big needle pricking the inside of her chest.Although she was temporary, she felt sorry that she was married. Because it seemed she didn\u2019t return Cedric to Lysia in full.Nevertheless, she feels secret joy in hearing Lysia says that she is Cedric\u2019s wife. She felt guilty for it too.Artizea\u2019s facial expressions became complicated, so Lysia thought that she had made a slip of the tongue.She looked carefully at Artizea. Artizea knew, then said, as if making excuses.\u201cI hope you don\u2019t get it wrong. It has nothing to do with His Grace\u2019s preference.\u201d\u201cGrand Duchess.\u201d\u201cCedric is a good lord to serve. That\u2019s why he decided to trust the Marquisate of Rosan. That\u2019s all.\u201dLysia looked embarrassed.There was a knock on the door. Lysia checked her watch. It was snack time.Rize opened the door. As usual, Cedric stood with a plate of cookies in his hand.Artizea naturally stood up from her seat.\u201cWelcome.\u201d\u201cJust in time.\u201dCedric smiled as he saw the tea ready.Lysia brought a new cup and put it down in front of Cedric.\u201cHer Grace prepared it in time.\u201dCedric put down the plate of cookies and sat down.Artizea picked up one of the teacups and its saucer and moved about a third of the homemade cookies. She then told Rize to bring a tray and placed the cup and cookies on it.Cedric wrinkled eyebrow.\u201cIf I\u2019m interfering, I can leave.\u201d\u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t, I have some work to do. Lysia, could you serve His Grace with the tea instead?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, but I\u2019ll do it for you.\u201dLysia said in confusion.\u201cIt\u2019s because I don\u2019t want to be disturbed.\u201d\u201cBut Your Grace\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it the lady-in-waiting\u2019s job to serve guests on my behalf when I\u2019m busy?\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u2026\u201dArtizea pressed Lysia\u2019s shoulder lightly to indicate her to sit.And she slightly bowed her head to Cedric.\u201cExcuse me.\u201dThe wrinkles in Cedric\u2019s brow were like fluctuating change in the earth\u2019s crust, turning into towering mountains and deep valleys.Whether she noticed or not, Artizea left the room as it was.Rize bowed with a face like a guilty prisoner about to be executed. Then she picked up the tray and followed.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Cedric thought, rubbing his eyebrows with his index finger.Or, did he say something that had disappointed her without knowing?Lysia said.\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be nice to follow after her, instead of worrying about it?\u201d\u201cI should.\u201dCedric stood up.Lysia briefly wondered if it was because of her.\u201cSurely.\u201dNo matter how much she thought about it, there was nothing to be misunderstood about her relationship with Cedric. She thought the idea was too self-centered and she forgot it.***Artizea was in the library.It was true that she had several documents to write. She wanted to get her plans in order before the winter was over.She thought it was a decent break, but it wasn\u2019t. She had so many things to do as she went back, but her mind was irritated.She had no craving appetite. She\u2019s got a few sweet pieces of cookies, and even that didn\u2019t go down well. Artizea knew that she couldn\u2019t eat anything, and she put it down.In Artizea\u2019s mind, she has begun to picture some specific details after all of her work is over.If she luckily doesn\u2019t die, she\u2019d better build a villa somewhere in the eastern, quiet countryside.How about buying all the books she wants to have and putting them together? It would be nice if she walked every day, read books, and wrote letters she couldn\u2019t send.She was thinking about that when the door opened.Rize said cautiously.\u201cMadam, the Master\u2026.\u201dCedric came through the door without permission and stood there asking.\u201cAm I interrupting?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t tell you that.\u201dArtizea sighed a little and sat back.Cedric knew that she had allowed his entry and stepped inside.\u201cTia.\u201d\u201cDo you have anything to say?\u201d\u201cIf I don\u2019t have anything to say, can\u2019t I join your tea time?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do that.\u201d\u201cTia.\u201d\u201cIf you have nothing to say, I have to do my job.\u201d\u201cTia.\u201dHe called in a stern voice. Artizea raised her eyes.Cedric thought that it had been a long time since his and her eyes made contact.But even if he matched her eyes like this, there wasn\u2019t much difference from when it wasn\u2019t.Her eyes, which had always had a deep color, were now as emotionless as blue jewels.Artizea put her eyes down again.\u201cIf you have any business, please tell me. I will listen.\u201dCedric finally sighed.\u201cI just wanted to talk to you.\u201d\u201cDo it later when I have time. You don\u2019t have to make me spoiled. Lysia is taking good care of the snacks these days.\u201dIf she said this while turning away, Cedric couldn\u2019t speak any more.\u201cOkay, I won\u2019t disturb you anymore.\u201d\u201cSorry.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to the hunt early tomorrow morning.\u201d\u201cYes, I know. You said it was like a New Year\u2019s event.\u201dWinter hunting has been around since the time when food was scarce in the middle of winter. It is for an intermediate replenishment of food.However, winter hunting is dangerous, so when there is a place where a lot of knights gather, there is a custom of going out hunting together.Naturally, it was immediately after the New Year\u2019s banquet. Again, for unity, a hunting plan was scheduled for several days.\u201cMaybe it will be about 5 days to a week. It could be longer if the weather conditions are good.\u201dArtizea nodded at Cedric\u2019s words.\u201cIt seems to be very dangerous because it is right after it snows, please be careful.\u201d\u201cTia.\u201d\u201cAlthough I think the knights know much better than me.\u201dCedric reached out. However, his hand could not reach Artizea. This is because Artizea preemptively avoided his hand.\u201c\u2026..Do you have anything else to say?\u201dCedric asked.There was no way there would be, but Artizea did not know.Cedric looked at her fingertips. So Artizea held her hand together and hid her cold fingertips.\u201cOkay.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m leaving tomorrow early in the morning, so I probably won\u2019t have time to say hello. It\u2019s going to be a few days away, so please take care.\u201d\u201cYes, don\u2019t worry about it, have a safe trip.\u201dCedric eventually couldn\u2019t hold her hand or kiss the back of her hand.He turned his back and went outside.Artizea looked at his back for a while, then lowered her head when the door closed.***It was fussing at dawn. The butler tried to quietly lead the hunting procession away, but that couldn\u2019t be done.The excited dog barked, and the knights shouted as they lined up the soldiers.Artizea barely slept that night.Her heart was restless. She heard the sound of a cold wind as if she had a hole deep in her heart by an awl.She kept thinking of the hand that Cedric had stretched out.She knew that his heart was inclined quite a bit to her. She knows that if she reaches out her hand, he may hold her.That was the most painful. She thinks she\u2019ll fall for the temptation.But it shouldn\u2019t have been.Artizea came down from bed. She tucked her feet into the fluffy fur slippers on the floor and found her gown.\u201cHuh? Madam?\u201dAlice, crouched asleep on the couch, spoke sleepily, but she was startled and tried to get up.Artizea shook her head.\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d\u201cShall I get you water? Or\u2026\u201d\u201cJust sleep.\u201dLooking for a gown over her pajamas, she opened the door to Cedric\u2019s bedroom.Cedric never locked the door on his side. If Artizea wanted to open it, she could open it anytime.It\u2019s been a long time since the owner of the bedroom had already left, so the room was bleak. It was after the servants finished all tidying up.Still, it wasn\u2019t without human traces. Artizea briefly looked around the room and sat down on the bed.She heard the sound of a horn in the distance.Artizea stood up and approached the window. When she opened the shutter slightly, the torch of the hunting procession was already far away.The wind was so cold she quickly closed the window. And she came back to her room.What if she had opened this door when he was there?It\u2019s meaningless even if she thinks about it.She was a vicious woman. She was generally as vicious to everyone, but she was more vicious to Evron.She shouldn\u2019t forget that. Artizea locked the door again. And she crawled back into bed.In the meantime, her hands and feet were sore as if her body temperature had dropped. She covered the blanket all the way to the end of her head, but her breath formed like dew on her limbs and made it colder.Artizea suddenly realized that she was still wearing the diamond bracelet.\u2018This\u2026.\u2019She had been wearing it from the time she was proposed, so she forgot.She pulled it out and put it down on the side table.Her sleep was unlikely to come again.***It was two days later that a guest came.\u201cFrom the South Sea, a leather dealer?\u201dAt the words of the treasurer in charge, Artizea was quite surprised.\u201cYes, it\u2019s said to be a small business of the Eimmel Kingdom. It took so long to check the identity card, that\u2019s why I\u2019ve only got to post it now.\u201dSaid the treasurer with a regretful face.\u201cIn this season?\u201d\u201cThey didn\u2019t know that the sea would be frozen, so they came up, but I guess their feet were tied up. Sometimes fishing boats from the mainland do the same.\u201d\u201cWhere are they staying now?\u201d\u201cAt first, they stayed at an inn, but in winter, the inn also closed its business\u2026. Now it seems that the temple is taking care of them. There are many empty rooms.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t common, but it wasn\u2019t something that had never happened before, so the treasurer said without doubt.\u201cIt\u2019s been said that Evron leather was being received through the business of the mainland so far. Middleman traders have raised the price unacceptably, and now they want to trade directly.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d\u201cPreviously, when Her Grace\u2019s secretary was negotiating with the leather dealer, it didn\u2019t go well. They said that they want to meet in person.\u201d\u201cOkay. I think it\u2019s possible. Let\u2019s meet.\u201dArtizea nodded her head. It was an opportunity to see how much profiteering the middleman traders had been making.There was nothing to delay, so the merchants were called in that very afternoon.Artizea decided to meet them in the reception room of the Grand Duchy.Privately, Cedric entrusted her with full power. However, she did not want to give the impression that she had just married and that the Grand Duchess took over the official office.Lysia sits by her side, and Alphonse stands behind her. Four financiers took seats on the left and right.The entrance to the reception room was bustling.Merchants who had been called entered the reception room.\u201cI heard that everyone is a sailor, but the physique is quite\u2026..\u201dOne of the treasurers mumbled.Artizea wasn\u2019t listening to that.She stood up in astonishment when she saw the red-haired man who came in at the forefront.\u201cAh\u2026!\u201dBut she couldn\u2019t put the name out of her mouth.It was because at this point in time, as a normal person, she didn\u2019t know.The man laughed.\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time, Marchioness Rosan. How long has it been? You probably haven\u2019t forgotten me already?\u201dThe eyes and expression were bright.Then, she realized that he already knew her.\u201cHis Majesty Cadriol of Eimmel.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m relieved you remember. My head is still tingling after I got hit by you.\u201dAlphonse felt a strange hint and moved.However, Cadriol\u2019s men were faster.A man spit out a knife thinner than a finger from his mouth. And with it, he poked his companion\u2019s belly next to him and pulled out a round object from his stomach.Alphonse, who noticed the strange feeling, was already running at him.Lysia screamed.\u201cNo, Sir Alphonse! Her Grace\u2019s side!\u201dBut both were already late.The smoke bomb exploded and the room was filled with sticky purple smoke.The smoke bomb was a melee weapon that Eimmel\u2019s navy was proud of.All of Cadriol\u2019s subordinates were elite among the elite of the Eimmel Kingdom, and through the smoke, they could see ahead like in broad daylight.However, there was only one Alphonse from the Evron Knight.The guards plunged into the room, but couldn\u2019t find their direction in the dark smoke.Cadriol ran to Artizea and snatched her.Alphonse ran after him with his senses alone. Six blades blocked his way.He broke the blade in his way and cut the neck of his opponent.However, he did not get Artizea back from Cadriol\u2019s hand.Lysia went out by touching the wall.Smoke bombs exploded in succession. Soon the hall was full of smoke.\u201cCall the knights! Close all doors of the stronghold! \u201cLysia shouted out loud.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

They rarely even considered being attacked by the same human beings. This is because the frozen sea and cold weather were more powerful defenses than anything else.In addition, for the hunting events, all the main figures in military relations, including knights, would be away.He thought that if only the escape route could be secured, it would be easy for him to kidnap a weak woman.But it wasn\u2019t something to look down on.The moment they realized that the enemy had entered, the stronghold itself shifted.A door made of steel descended on Cadriol\u2019s front and back. Originally, it was intended to bind the feet of enemies invading from outside.Nevertheless, as they fell simultaneously, it was easy to get trapped in the hallway.The target position was close, but Cadriol had to go round and round. Jump into another room, open another door, and run into a new hallway.If he had not been familiar with the structure of the stronghold in advance from Aubrey, even if his men were the best warriors of the South Sea, they would have been trapped and killed.\u201cDamn it!\u201dArrows flew from behind.Guards blocked the hallway. All entrances to this castle would have been blocked by soldiers.\u201cGo!\u201dA member of the elite team stayed behind. Cadriol shout out, \u201cI will definitely pay you back!\u201d.And finally, he arrived at the end of the corridor on the first floor.[Turn the left and right wrist of the statue carved on the wall at the same time. It is a secret passage that was created to supply water.]As Aubrey told him, this secret passage opens from the inside, and only extends to the river.But for Cadriol, that was enough.Eimmel is a maritime kingdom, a kingdom of water.For the people of Eimmel, handling the boat was like handling their own hands and feet. Manipulating sails and flying in the wind is something even a 10-year-old can do.Even if it is a frozen river, a river is a river. Once he got on the boat, he won\u2019t lose to anyone.With a rumbling noise, the wall with the statue of the saint opened.Bam! Bam! Bam!Short arrows were stuck in the statue of the saint one after another.Cadriol exploded the last smoke bomb left. And he jumped into the secret passage.***Lysia lowered the crossbow.There was no guarantee that Artizea would not be hit by shooting an arrow into that cloud of smoke.A group of soldiers rumbled into the secret passage.Lysia said.\u201cSend people outside the secret passage. We have to go through it.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d\u201cSend a messenger to the Grand Duke right now. And secure Aubrey Jordyn.\u201dLysia ordered one after another. Margaret\u2019s face turned pale.Lysia grabbed her hand.\u201cWe have to know who leaked the secret passage.\u201dThere were three secret passages of the stronghold.The most insignificant among them was the passage of the statue.Rather than a secret passage, it was an emergency water supply route, so the length was short, and it was unreasonable to use it as an escape route.However, that is based on the Evron or Krates mainland people.At the end, there is a river. And the opponent is a South Sea person.\u201cOh, Aubrey, how could you\u2026\u201d\u201cThink calmly. Aubrey is the most likely suspect, Aunt. Aubrey is at the temple, and they were staying at the temple too. Didn\u2019t she hate the Grand Duchess a bit?\u201dLysia said coldly.In addition, Cedric said that everyone knows of the passage, but in reality, it was hard to know how to open the secret passage.He only informed it to his trusted vassals in case the stronghold was breached and the command was destroyed.Among them were the caretakers of the stronghold, the Count Jordyns, who were the agents of the master, and their children who were expected to inherit the duty in the future.Blood drained from Margaret\u2019s face.\u201cWe need to find out information about them, even a little. Aunt Margaret! If something goes wrong with the Grand Duchess like this, how are you going to see the Grand Duke\u2019s face?\u201dMargaret was startled and lifted her head. Then she nodded and ran out.***Artizea\u2019s mind came after Cadriol got out of the stronghold and boarded a boat.Artizea opened her hazy eyes and raised her head. She was lying on the floor of a small cabin like a coffin.Over her body was a coat of thick fur-skinned leather. There was also a fur coat on the floor.\u201cAh\u2026.\u201dHer whole body hurt, as if being beaten. She sat up.Unable to cope with the cold and frozen body, she pulled up the overcoat and put it on her. It was the length that reached her ankle.Her last memory was that she was pulled by the back of neck while being carried by Cadriol.She stood up carefully. The feet in her indoor silk shoes were cold as if her toes were falling apart.Oversized fur shoes were laid. Artizea wore it and stumbled and stepped out of the cabin.The remodeled small ship was pushing forward, smoothly like a sled on ice.Artizea glanced everywhere, blankly. The sails were blown up by the wind.The riverside passed by in a flash. Even when it was warm, it didn\u2019t get to this speed even when she rode Evron\u2019s ship.\u201cYou woke up.\u201dCadriol clicked his finger.\u201cThe hospitality is not very good, but hang in there. I know that the Marchioness is not very healthy, but I can\u2019t afford to carry a hearth.\u201dArtizea took a quick breath. The cold air froze her lungs.\u201cI don\u2019t know what kind of hellish weather this is. Is Evron insane? They built a castle and built a town to live in a place like this?\u201d\u201cHis Majesty Cadriol.\u201d\u201cAre your fur shoes warm? Cutting off the bride\u2019s toes with a knife is not what I want.\u201d\u201cHow\u2026.\u201d\u201cHmm how.\u201dLeaving the sail line to another sailor, Cadriol approached Artizea\u2019s side.Artizea stepped backward.\u201cWhere do I start? How did I escape? How did I know the structure of the stronghold? How did I get here?\u201dCadriol laughed brightly.\u201cOr, should I start from the moment my neck fell? You haven\u2019t seen it have you? My neck fell off with an axe.\u201d\u201cYour Majesty. \u201c\u201cThe executioner told me. My father deliberately told him to use an ax that didn\u2019t work well, but the Marchioness spent money and replaced it with a sharp one. Should I say thank you for that shallow mercy?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026.\u201d\u201cActually, I was really grateful. I had my neck drop in one swing. If I had been axed five or six times, I would have gone crazy as soon as my memories revived.\u201dArtizea took one more step back.Cadriol snatched her waist. Her wrist, which swung like she was trying to resist, was easily caught.\u201cBe careful. If you fall under the boat now, your body will be shattered by ice, and you die immediately.\u201d\u201cHow.\u201dArtizea could only ask.Cadriol, the first prince of the Eimmel Kingdom, was the pirate king of the South Sea.The kingdom of Eimmel was a small island in the South Sea.The population was small, and the land mass was smaller. There were no resources, and agriculture could not develop in the salty land.Even so, they did not develop a delicate technology like the Kingdom of Ianz in a similar situation.The industry that did develop was fishing. However, distribution of seafood is possible only on the beach at best.During the development of Krates, Eimmel grew poorer.So it was piracy that Cadriol turned his eyes to.It wasn\u2019t that way from the start. Initially, they used their advanced navigation technology to engage in shipbuilding and relay trade.However, the Duke of Riagan, who was backed by imperial support, crushed it.It didn\u2019t even take a few years to realize that Cadriol could hardly stand up against the large business of the Krates Empire.He subdued the pirates of the South Sea and gathered them all under his banner.In the first place, many of the South Sea pirates were from the Eimmel kingdom. Even some that came from other kingdoms, it was commonly dominated by the South Sea people.Organized pirates intensively plundered the Kratesian merchant ships, periodically sweeping the southern coastal regions, weakening the naval forces.At the same time, he declared himself the protector of the South Sea as the Prince of Eimmel.It was said that a merchant ship protected by the Eimmel Navy could safely cross the sea.It was from the beginning of the country\u2019s founding that the southern regions of the empire suffered from piracy.However, in the next ten years or so from now, the imperial navy is at its weakest and the power of pirates rises.In fact, there was a position where they could do nothing without the help of the Eimmel Navy.It was all done by Cadriol.So Artizea joined hands with Cadriol. The first transaction was to manipulate grain prices to oust Grand Duke Roygar.It was a deal that Cadriol couldn\u2019t refuse.He took the money separately, and obtained the grain merchant shop. As the price of grain rose, the plundered grain was released back to the southern regions and gained triple benefits.The alliance continued for some time after Grand Duke Roygar was expelled. This is because Lawrence wants to subdue even the Duke of Riagan.But in the end, Artizea betrayed Cadriol. It was because he had evidence of her conspiracy.After trusting Artizea, Cadriol was arrested by the king for treason and lost his neck.It was the Krates Empire that lent soldiers to King Eimmel that day. It was Lawrence to be precise.\u201cHow\u2026?\u201dArtizea was forced to ask again. Cadriol smiled.\u201cAbout 4 months ago, I woke up while sleeping, and I was so surprised and grateful that my neck was intact. I remember my neck being cut by the death penalty. At first, I thought I had the oddest of nightmares.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cBut from that day, it was very weird. The documents, the people, all I had already seen, and even the day the storm came. The memories became more vivid and I couldn\u2019t say that I had a dream.\u201dSaid Cadriol.\u201cSo what do you think was the first thing I thought about? Marchioness?\u201d\u201cI do not know. \u201c\u201cI had to get you in my hand.\u201dCadriol\u2019s hand grabbed Artizea\u2019s chin and fixed it.\u201cI don\u2019t know how long I\u2019ve missed you. I\u2019ve thought about it many times. Should I strangle you or kiss you when we meet?\u201dHe laughed furiously. A whisper fell over Artizea\u2019s lips.Artizea stopped breathing.No one else would have any memory. Artizea has checked it in many ways.Cadriol kissed her. Artizea bite down the lip hard with all her might.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

There were 14 guards killed by swords and 4 strangers from the South Sea.Cedric put a sheet with Evron\u2019s crest on the body of the guards. After identification, the body of the South Sea people was tied with a rope and pulled out.And Cedric sat on the upper seat of the Grand Hall with his sword on, without even loosening the winter cape strap over his coat.Alphonse knelt in front of Cedric. He couldn\u2019t even erase the blood stains he had during the day.He lowered his sword, removed the insignia from his chest, and placed it in front of Cedric.\u201cI will pay you back with death, the sin of failing to protect the Grand Duchess.\u201dCedric responded with an angry voice to Alphonse\u2019s words.\u201cDon\u2019t put death in your mouth easily. There will be work to be done before I take your breath away from your throat.\u201d\u201cForgive me.\u201dThe situation was grasped.A group of South Sea people came in last month and stayed at the temple for nearly a month. It was just before the port was frozen.Aubrey, who met them at the temple, drew in detail the structure of the stronghold.The South Sea people, who had passed through the passage of the Saint statue, went down to the estuary from the river, in a small boat that had been waiting.The ship was said to have been modified to run on ice like a sled. The merchant who had lent the warehouse to store the ship bowed down and lamented that he was guilty of death.\u201cThe one who remodeled the ship is also those South Sea people. There were some damages, so they came in and out to repair it themselves, but there was no doubt about it at all.\u201dWhen the South Sea people contacted Aubrey, the servant who watched her and all of their family, were also found dead.Cadriol held their family hostage to prevent words leaking from their mouths, then killed them before leaving.Cedric ordered coldly.\u201cClose the temple, arrest and investigate all residents who have had any interactions with them. Make sure that the secret passages are destroyed and blocked. Since it is known to the outsider, it should be made so that it cannot be used again.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWhat about the port?\u201d\u201cOnce the beacons were lit, a complete shutdown order was issued.\u201d\u201cIf you can go down the river by attaching a sled under a boat, it will also be possible in the sea. Do not neglect cracking down on the supply warehouse just because it is frozen. No matter how great the ship of the South Sea people is, they will not be able to go out to the ocean without any supply.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dCedric said only then.\u201cBring Aubrey.\u201dSoon Aubrey was brought. She was caught in the temple room without knowing the situation.Aubrey wasn\u2019t surprised to see the ugly atmosphere of the stronghold. She asked with a cool smile, as if she was delighted.\u201cThat woman, did she run away too?\u201d\u201cAubrey Jordyn. Did you inform the South Sea people of the structure of the stronghold?\u201dCedric asked in a cold voice.\u201cWhat? Oh, yes.\u201dOnly then Aubrey\u2019s shoulders shrunk. It was because she knew it was wrong.\u201cHe said he must meet her. Uh, do you know that she abandoned her lover that she originally intended to marry and married Your Grace instead?\u201dCadriol never said that. But within Aubrey\u2019s head, the story was already so transformed.\u201cI\u2019ve known that for a long time. That\u2019s what cheap women do.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be so sad. She is a woman who is not worthy of Your Grace\u2019s heart.\u201dAubrey approached Cedric.She wanted to comfort him. How sad and betrayed he must have felt.He was so nice to the lowly woman whose father is not known, and gave her the status of the Grand Duchess, then she betrayed him and ran away with another man.Aubrey thought Artizea was a really funny woman. Whether she has a changed heart or for other reasons, shouldn\u2019t she first ask Cedric for divorce and ask for forgiveness.However, she guessed it from the time Cadriol spoke that they would be running away. She must have committed a great sin that she couldn\u2019t say.Even though he became angry, Aubrey was deeply satisfied, and with this, Cedric also knew Artizea\u2019s true color.As Aubrey thought, Cedric was angry with sadness and betrayal.However, the reality was different that the person who did the betrayal was Aubrey, not Artizea.Aubrey\u2019s rude remarks froze the air in the Grand Hall.Margaret, who was terrified, ran out crying and hugged Aubrey and fell to the floor.\u201cJust her life\u2026\u2026\u2026 Please spare her life!\u201dAubrey said annoyingly.\u201cOh, mom. What\u2019s the matter? She\u2019s gone so she\u2019s gone, it\u2019s done now. She\u2019s a woman who\u2019s not worth scolding.\u201dAaron pounded both hands on the floor. It was because he couldn\u2019t even dare to ask for a life.Following Aaron, the daughters of Count Jordyn came forward and knelt.The eldest daughter, serving as the knight, unwrapped her sword and took off her cloak. The second daughter and third daughter, who serve as officials, also took off their hat and the insignia indicating their identity.Following that, all of the lineages of Jordyn\u2019s knelt on their knees.Aubrey then realized that the situation was completely different from what she thought.Cedric lamented in front of her as he looked around.\u201cI can\u2019t believe it. This happened in my castle.\u201d\u201cYour Grace\u2026.\u201d\u201cWhen I came back to this place a few days ago, the Grand Duchess advised me. People can betray me for unforeseen reasons, so she wants me to be more careful. Do you know what I answered at that time?\u201d\u201cYour Grace\u2026.\u201dAaron called him in a trembling voice.\u201cI laughed it off! It\u2019s all right, it\u2019s safe in my estate! I trusted you! I never thought there would be any betrayal in my castle! So I said she\u2019d be safe, too!\u201dCedric jumped up with anger.\u201cI was always worried about getting pierced from the outside! I was worried about being wiped out by Karam, and I was worried about the imperial conspiracy! I was afraid of winter approaching, and I thought of fighting and death. But I was able to sleep with confidence only in my house, my castle! Because I trusted you!\u201dThe knights and officials could not handle the anger and knelt on the floor at once.\u201cAubrey Jordyn! I\u2019ll give you one chance to make just one excuse, looking at your parent\u2019s side. Why did you do that?\u201d\u201cYou, Your Grace..\u2026\u201dAubrey, terrified, muttered tearfully.\u201cBecause Your Grace is looking only at her, an, and \u2026\u2026I yearn for Your Grace\u2026\u2026\u201dShe couldn\u2019t stop saying that.Clang!Cedric drew the sword from his waist and threw it in front of Margaret.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to forgive all of the crimes of treason against the Grand Duchess, the treachery of leaking the secret of the stronghold through a communication with the enemy, and the high crimes against Evron.\u201d\u201cPlease, please, spare\u2026\u201d\u201cIt is deserving to destroy the whole family, but considering the achievements of Jordyn, I will give you the opportunity to rid the shame of the family by yourself.\u201dIt became irreversible.Margaret cried endlessly, hugging Aubrey\u2019s head.Aubrey looked up at Cedric blankly. And said \u201cHuh? Huh?\u201d and looked around with a face that couldn\u2019t figure out the situation.No one sided with her.Aaron couldn\u2019t dare say that he would cut his daughter\u2019s throat on his own, and did not move his face up.Instead, the eldest daughter stood up and picked up Cedric\u2019s sword.Subsequently, the second daughter and the third daughter ran. The two captured Margaret and pulled her out.\u201cI, I will die instead! I will die!\u201dAs Margaret was pulled out, her cries echoed from outside.Slash!Without a scream, her blood gushed.Lysia turned her head.Cedric continued.\u201cI hereby order that Aaron Jordyn and Margaret Jordyn be deprived of their titles and to serve as a servant at the Thold Gate. After a three-years probation, after confirming their loyalty, I will decide on future punishment.Tears dripped from Aaron\u2019s eyes.\u201cViscount Agate.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cTemporarily take over the management of the stronghold. I will track down the invader with the military.\u201dCedric ordered that and turned around with his cloak.\u201cWhere are you going? We\u2019ve already delivered a search order to the port, so we\u2019ll have news tomorrow afternoon.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going.\u201dHe headed out with a determined step.The knights rushed out after him.It was midnight, and snow was piled up. It was unreasonable to run horses all night even for northerners who were used to the cold.However, Cedric did not hesitate.The South Sea people were said to use a boat that was converted into a sled. He couldn\u2019t even guess where it would go in a day, or where the real ship would have been put on the frozen sea.\u2018It\u2019s my fault.\u2019He thought.Just because it was his castle doesn\u2019t mean he was safe.It would have been better if he had followed Artizea\u2019s warnings enough. He should have been properly escorted without being relieved, even if it was in his stronghold.It is arrogance to believe that the hearts of the servants will be the same as his own.It was a mistake to believe that everyone would respect her and treat her like him because she was his chosen companion.Aubrey should have been kicked out earlier as well.He already knew that Aubrey was disrespectful. However, he didn\u2019t deliberately interfere because he believed it was Artizea\u2019s job to rule her lady-in-waiting.However, Artizea was softened by the thought of his relationship with the Jordyn family, and that was one of the reasons for this incident.He found it difficult to forgive himself.She had to be by his side.Only regrets remained.\u201cYour Grace!\u201dLysia ran out in a hurry.Cedric said, pulling the horse\u2019s reins.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, nothing will happen to Tia.\u201dIt was more like a word to himself.\u201cThat\u2019s not it. This\u2026.\u201dLysia politely raised the diamond bracelet to him with her two hands.Cedric looked down at it vaguely.\u201cIt was lying next to Her Grace\u2019s bed. She always wore it \u2026\u2026 Please give it back to her.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dCedric took it and put it in his arms.And he sped up the horse. A group of knights followed him.\u2014\u2014-Notes:The talk about betraying is in Chapter 61.Aaaa, this is one of the most exciting chapters I tl-ed to date! (Thus, I dare to write this long thoughts.)This chapter really shows Cedric in his element, usually it\u2019s Artizea being cool and him being a sweet cutiepie. But on the other hand I\u2019m quite sad that Cedric learnt his lesson this way. Like for a child to experience a cut to not play with sharp objects anymore.What will happen to Cedric in the future tho? One of his good points is that he\u2019s down-to-earth, someone just beyond grasp, and he believes in these people he thought was his family.But with this, will he lose trust in them? Be more wary? Since it\u2019s really shown how hurt he was by the incident.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 77": "Chapter 77Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 77Proofreader: somniumIt was around midnight the next day that Cadriol arrived at the port.He had already secured a safe accommodation and warehouse, so he could safely enter the city without being noticed.There was anxiety that he might be caught.However, it was too dangerous to go out into the frozen sea in this darkness. It was because it was impossible to know where the ice was breaking and where the drift ice would flow.The main ship was anchored and waiting in a far sea; deep enough not to freeze.It was dangerous. However, considering the possibility of getting trapped in ice, this was better.But once they\u2019re joined, they wouldn\u2019t be overtaken by Evron\u2019s ship.Cadriol put Artizea, who he had been carrying like a sack, down in front of the fireplace.\u201cGet these guys out of here.\u201dUntil then, the owners of the house and their families who had been rolled in front of the fireplace with their hands and feet tied and their mouths gagged were dragged out.Cadriol took off the cloak he had covered Artizea with.Even though she had been in the cabin, Artizea\u2019s body was frozen blue. Her face was ash colored, and her lips were purple.When he looked at her face, he didn\u2019t even feel angry about his broken lips.\u201cHow did you think of marrying a northerner with such a body.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s none of\u2026 Your Highness Cadriol\u2019s\u2026 concern.\u201dArtizea said, trembling.The sailor poured hot water from the kettle hanging in the fireplace and handed it to Cadriol.Cadriol held the cup in Artizea\u2019s hand.Artizea couldn\u2019t lift it because her body froze. Then Cadriol wrapped Artizea\u2019s hand with his hand and put a cup of water to her mouth.After drinking two cups of hot water and sitting in front of the fireplace for a while, the color of Artisea\u2019s lips returned.Cadriol gave her warm porridge this time.It wasn\u2019t easy to eat, but Artizea tried hard to eat it. It was necessary for her body to hold on, and it was necessary to regain her reason.The trembling of her body did not stop easily. It was because of the cold.However, mixed with tension, Artizea couldn\u2019t tell which necessary side she was focusing on.\u201cWhat are you going to do with me?\u201d\u201cWell, what should I do? I had originally intended you to be my wife.\u201dCadriol muttered.She had no idea how he returned to the past.Over the course of a month, he found out that no one else had this memory.So Cadriol thought it was very likely that Artizea had no memory of it too.So, he was planning to formally propose to her.As Marchioness of Rosan she was inferior to the Prince of Eimmel, but not low enough that she couldn\u2019t.And given that Lawrence was the emperor\u2019s son, she was the right person.She will not reject the alliance between Lawrence and Eimmel.Once she got married and put in his hands, she would have no worries from then on. She wouldn\u2019t know anything about Lawrence.He was going to separate her from Miraila and Lawrence, and make her dedicated to him.It would be good if she helps him as his wife and cultivates her talents as before.But even if she couldn\u2019t, it was fine. All he has to do is keep Artizea next to him and watch her do nothing.Cadriol had the confidence that he could make her love him. Why won\u2019t she when she will be treated like the most precious person in the world and be loved?Even the future Marchioness of Rosan, she is only an 18-year-old girl who is hungry for affection.However, he was already too late by the time he went to the capital.\u201cI\u2019m amazed because the Marchioness left after marrying Grand Duke Evron.\u201dCadriol said, shooking his head.Artizea was mentally busy trying to infer his thoughts. Cadriol laughed at it.\u201cSo I knew that Marchioness had memories too. How far? Your memories?\u201d\u201cThe moment of death.\u201dArtizea replied only so. She didn\u2019t have to tell him that she had cast a regression magic.Cadriol was convinced and nodded.\u201cAre you betrayed by Lawrence?\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cWell, it was a predicted ending. Marchioness made Lawrence a puppet and not took the regime directly.\u201dArtizea did not answer.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. If I had seen it, I would have laughed at it cheerfully. Didn\u2019t I tell you? Give up Lawrence and come to me. It must have been quite painful to be beaten by someone you trusted?\u201dShe couldn\u2019t say it wasn\u2019t painful. However, Artizea did not want to show such intent, so she turned her head.\u201cI never trusted you.\u201dCadriol showed his teeth again and laughed.Artizea clasped her cold fingertips.\u201cSo, this time, is Grand Duke Evron the chosen man? Or, is it the Saintess?\u201d\u201cPlease tell me your business. You have come to this place, so you must have a serious business.\u201dArtizea said firmly.Even though she is a threat, the assumption that he came to kill her is wrong. If so, he doesn\u2019t have to come in person like this. It is much better to wait for her to come to the capital and send an assassin.It was the same if he came to kill her himself because of revenge.Instead of dragging her and saying phrases and words like this, it\u2019s okay if he killed her when he caught her in the stronghold.It would have been much easier to escape.Cadriol said something Artizea never thought of.\u201cBe mine.\u201dArtizea opened her eyes wide. She had already guessed that his purpose was not to kill her, but she didn\u2019t know she would hear these words.\u201cMarchioness is too good to be under Grand Duke Evron. He will not be able to use your abilities in half.\u201d\u201cDo you mean that Your Highness Cadriol is different?\u201d\u201cWith the memory, I am, of course, different. If the two of us hold hands, it will not be impossible to overturn the empire.\u201d\u201cI am not interested in the Eimmel Kingdom before.\u201d\u201cI will also help you take revenge on Lawrence.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cI will not be bad to the Saintess and Grand Duke Evron. I am not interested in the northern part of the empire anyway. Marchioness will mediate. Me in the south, and Grand Duke Evron in the north hold hands and press the mainland of the empire to split it in half?\u201d\u201cYour Highness Cadriol.\u201d\u201cIf Marchioness had joined hands with Grand Duke Evron for the sake of the Saintess, this would have led to a much better result. Rather than becoming the Crown Princess of the Empire, she would live happily with the Grand Duke Evron this time.\u201dArtizea was silent.He knows Artizea of \u200b\u200bthe past. So she wouldn\u2019t trust him.There was no one more difficult to persuade.Cadriol laughed happily.\u201cOr, did you not marry the Grand Duke for the Saintess, but married the Grand Duke with a private heart?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s.\u2026.\u201dArtizea was confused and tried to refute. Cadriol intercepted her words and said.\u201cYou have had Grand Duke Evron in your heart from the beginning, so it\u2019s not unusual to do that.\u201dCadriol pulled her arm.Artizea saw her face reflected in his golden eyes. She had a silly look.\u201cDid you think I wouldn\u2019t know that?\u201d\u201c\u2026..I\u2019ve never done that way before.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll pretend I don\u2019t know anything.\u201dSaid Cadriol.\u201cAnd for either case, I love you enough to forget everything. Come to me.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026I refuse.\u201dArtizea shook his arm. And she turned her face toward the fireplace.\u201cIt\u2019s true that I\u2019m a vicious woman, but I\u2019m not so mindless enough to change my master twice.\u201d\u201cThen, I will kill you in this place. I will have a special taste of sprinkling you to the sea by slicing you alive in front of the Saintess and the Grand Duke.\u201d\u201cAre you convinced that killing me is profitable?\u201dArtizea turned her head back and looked at Cadriol. A cool light returned to her turquoise eyes, shaking with anxiety.\u201cBecause you\u2019re not sure, you haven\u2019t killed me yet.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not about killing Marchioness. I\u2019m asking you to come to me.\u201d\u201cIf I follow Your Highness Cadriol and state my plan, will you believe it?\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cIt will be difficult to do that. Your Highness\u2019 plan has already been broken because I have the memory.\u201dCadriol shrugs his shoulder.\u201cWell, there\u2019s nothing to lose just by keeping you by my side and monitoring you so that you can\u2019t do anything.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s easier to kill me than that.\u201dArtizea said so.\u201cI\u2019m never going to follow Your Highness Cadriol. But, I\u2019ll give you a plan. We\u2019ve gotten along well together before. We\u2019ll be good allies this time.\u201d\u201cAnd then you want to hit my back again? I\u2019m sorry, Marchioness Rosan, this time I have nothing to do with the struggle for the succession of the Krates Empire.\u201d\u201cThe current Queen of Eimmel.\u201dArtizea said briefly.And when she confirmed that Cadriol had his ears open, she said.\u201cShe will be assassinated within half a year. It has nothing to do with Your Highness, but by the hands of the Krates Empire.\u201d\u201c\u2026..\u201d\u201cI will create a cause for anger enough to cause military action and to force King Eimmel to abdicate. You will never lose money.\u201dArtizea said so.This is the only way to persuade Cadriol, who has memory before the return.No matter how big her promises are, Cadriol won\u2019t believe her. Artizea has a history of betraying him already.Then she had to present something more paramount than that. She must convince him that even if she later betrays him, he will not be hurt.The circumstances of the Eimmel royal family were rather complicated.Cadriol\u2019s father, the current king, was close to sixty years old.Cadriol was the first prince, and there were no siblings. This is because the king and the former queen, Cadriol\u2019s mother, were not close.As soon as there was a successor, the king and his wife did not meet again.And shortly after the death of the former queen, the king remarried. The new queen, younger than Cadriol, was beautiful and has a lot of charm.The king loved Cadriol\u2019s half-brother, born from the body of his new queen, it didn\u2019t irritate him to put him in front of his eyes.On the other hand, he hated Cadriol, who resembled the former queen.At the time, his eldest son was already over 35 years old, and his second son was only around 7 years old. It was impossible for the king to pass his throne on to his second son when he would not live at least 15 more years.In addition, Cadriol was already taking substantial control of the Eimmel crown. He had great achievements and was gaining support from the people.For the king, he was also a thorn. To him, Cadriol was not seen as his son and successor, but as a political opponent taking away his power.Therefore, when Artizea prepared the frame and soldiers to be given to take out Cadriol, he did not hesitate to implement it.Cadriol was silent for a moment.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

So, she added quickly.\u201cWe have already planted a sword in the Riagan Duchy. I will assassinate Her Majesty and accuse the Riagan Duchy. Her Majesty is secretly holding hands with the Riagan Duchy. I\u2019m sure you know.\u201d\u201cThe opinions of both sides are different.\u201d\u201cYes, but Your Highness is not officially aware of the relationship between the Riagan Duchy and the Queen, so it will be enough justification for military action.\u201dCadriol asked with a suspicious face.\u201cHow can I believe you\u2019re going to do it?\u201d\u201cYou must have already found out about me in the capital, so you must also know that I have become Her Majesty\u2019s lady-in-waiting?\u201dCadriol nodded his head.\u201cIt is the Empress\u2019 desire to destroy the Riagan Duchy.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re going to use it for the empire\u2019s infighting.\u201d\u201cYes, because the Riagan Duchy is not a small prey.\u201dIn all likelihood, Grand Duke Roygar will come out. Because the salt business is lucrative.And now, the Riagan Duchy is in charge of the distribution of salt in the South Sea under the leadership of the emperor.The money earned from the monopoly of salt was also the emperor\u2019s greatest source of income. If you put your hand on it, it was easy to drive it into another direction.Cadriol thought about it for a moment. Even if Artizea didn\u2019t have to explain it, he could guess her thoughts.\u201cIn the worst case, father will be related to the imperial rebellion, and even if it is not, it will be revealed that the queen has a hand in the empire\u2019s salt monopoly. There\u2019s no way Gregor could stay still.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t interfere with the internal affairs of other countries, but Eimmel\u2019s King will also have to show his sincerity.\u201dSo it meant to force the abdication from the pressure of the Krates Empire as the cause.Artizea said calmly.\u201cThis isn\u2019t something I\u2019m doing for Your Highness Cadriol, and it\u2019s something I can only do if I\u2019m in the Empire.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cAll Your Highness Cadriol will do is to take action in time for your case. If you hide that we met here today, there is no one to doubt you.\u201dShe waited calmly for Cadriol to think.In the meantime, the trembling of her body stopped.Cadriol suffered from his father all his life, and fought his stepmother, who he had a bad relationship with. He also learned that he would be betrayed by his father even if he established contribution and made his country rich.If he could get rid of the two without hearing a say that he had hurt his parents, he would have nothing more to wish for.If Artizea succeeds, he can be crowned without any moral flaws. If she fails, he doesn\u2019t lose anything.And once he is crowned, Artizea\u2019s way of harming him disappears.For Cadriol, it is to solve both of these worries at once.If he could also have some of the assets of the Riagan Duchy, it would have been a great profit.Artizea knows Cadriol well. She knew at least as much as Cadriol knew Artizea.So she knew that this was an acceptable offer for him.Cadriol looked at Artizea with a complicated face.Artizea was dumped on the carpet in front of the fireplace. Cadriol looked down at her.\u201cYou are smart. The successor you give birth to must be born with very good qualities.\u201d\u201cSo, are you accepting my offer or not?\u201dArtizea asked without shaking.Cadriol laughed in vain. He then raised his body.He reached out to Artizea.Artizea grabbed the hand and barely sat up. Her weary body seldom moved, so it was difficult to take her back off the floor.\u201cI have an offer on my side as well.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dArtizea tilted her head.Cadriol said, holding her hand.\u201cIsn\u2019t it the purpose of the Marchioness to raise Grand Duke Evron as the emperor? What to do after you\u2019ve finished?\u201d\u201cAre you saying you\u2019re going to call me as Eimmel\u2019s servant?\u201d\u201cNo. I say come to me as a woman.\u201dCadriol\u2019s breath passed through Artizea\u2019s palm.\u201cIf Grand Duke Evron is your only master, you don\u2019t have to insist on him after everything is done, right? After all, you wouldn\u2019t have any intention of staying in a small publicly exposed position anyway?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right\u2026\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re going to retire and go somewhere, come to me. The South Sea\u2019s climate will surely be good for the Marchioness\u2019 health.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to go through such troubles to keep an eye on me. Even then, you won\u2019t be able to believe me anyway\u2026\u201dWith his lips on Artizea\u2019s palm, Cadriol lifted up his golden eyes.Then she lifted her head with a bleak face.\u201cAre you really saying this because you don\u2019t understand my intention? Or are you deliberately pretending to not understand?\u201dArtizea hesitated.Cadriol shook his head. Then he pulled Artizea\u2019s hand and wrapped his other arm around her waist.Artizea was carried lightly in his hand. It became a posture that seemed to be held in his knees.\u201cYou\u2019re crazy. Have you forgotten what I proposed to you?\u201d\u201cNo, I do remember\u2026 It was for alliance, wasn\u2019t it?\u201dIt wasn\u2019t long after Grand Duke Roygar was ousted.Artizea had already obtained everything she would get from Cadriol at that time. So, she didn\u2019t want to make complicated things like marriage alliances.It was a time when there was a lot left to do for Lawrence. She had to be next to Lysia as well. She had no intention of leaving the capital and going to Eimmel.So she refused.Cadriol had a stunned face.\u201cThis is the first time I am this humiliated. I mean it.\u201d\u201cDo you have any weird habits of favoring a woman who axed your own neck?\u201d\u201cHey, I think I have a bad taste, too. But I can\u2019t help it. I know what kind of jewel when I see one.\u201dCadriol lightly put his forefinger on Artizea\u2019s temple.Then, he slid along the contours of her face, raising her chin.When this happened, Artizea could not help but be nervous.All sorts of complex emotions raged in Cadriol\u2019s eyes.Half of that would be hate. But the other half was something beyond that.\u201cThink seriously, Marchioness Rosan. I\u2019m willing to wait for the situation to be resolved.\u201dIt was right when he said that.\u201cCaptain!\u201dHe heard a shout from outside.Bang!The door was torn apart with a strong sound. Cadriol knocked Artizea to the floor and covered her with his body.A bloody smell came in with the cold breeze.Artizea, who was astonished, was pulled by Cadriol. Then he jumped up and pulled out his sword.A body fell through the door.Cedric slowly stepped over the body. He was holding a bloody sword.\u201cOh my God. I didn\u2019t expect you to come personally.\u201dCadriol groaned a little.Less than 48 hours have passed since he snatched Artizea from the stronghold.He thought Evron would make all-out efforts to track him down. However, he didn\u2019t think that Cedric, who had been out hunting, would come this fast.Cedric looked at him with a cold face to freeze.\u201cLet my wife go, then I\u2019ll kill you in a way that you don\u2019t suffer.\u201d\u201cThe reality is that I\u2019m going to die the moment I let her go.\u201dCadriol replied lightly.\u201cWhat do you think, Marchioness Rosan? Now, if I put a knife to your neck and threaten you, can you get me out of this terrifying situation?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not time to joke.\u201dThe moment Artizea replied, Cedric\u2019s complexion changed.Kang!Cadriol raised his arm in astonishment.In an instant, Cedric\u2019s heavy sword cut his steel forearm guards in two at once.Cadriol took his back step and was attacked by Cedric.Kang!Kaangg!The sound of metal crashing from the blades resounded in the narrow room.Cadriol stepped back further. He drew a pistol from his waist.However, Cedric\u2019s sword was faster. Cadriol pushed Artizea away and rolled over the floor, avoiding the sword from piercing his shoulder.Cedric\u2019s sword smashed the wooden window shutters.Cedric\u2019s cloak fluttered, causing the wind to stir the lights in the fireplace.\u201cUgh!\u201dCedric\u2019s hand grabbed Artizea\u2019s arm and pulled her.Artizea had no idea what the fight would be like. When her mind was thinking, Cedric was moving to the other corner of the room, leaving her behind him.It was to defend her from new enemies who might come through the door.Cadriol shouted with anger.\u201cYou think I don\u2019t want to kill you, right?\u201d\u201cBarking in the middle of a fight is something that even dogs don\u2019t do.\u201dCedric said softly.\u201cWait!\u201dArtizea ran and hugged Cedric\u2019s waist. Because her arm couldn\u2019t even reach torso.Cedric flinched and stood there. It was because he feared that any wrong moves would hurt Artizea.Artizea cried out to Cadriol.\u201cGo!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re telling me to run away from the enemy!\u201d\u201cAre you going to fight Evron in Evron? Are you crazy? You know this is his territory!\u201d\u201cTia.\u201dCedric called her.\u201cPlease let him go. He shouldn\u2019t die right now.\u201dThe diplomatic situation that would arise from the death of Cadriol here would be heavy.Artizea couldn\u2019t see Evron\u2019s under that burden because of her.\u201c\u2026..\u201d\u201cPlease, trust me.\u201dCedric said nothing.Artizea spoke this time to Cadriol.\u201cGo.\u201d\u201cMarchioness Rosan.\u201d\u201cI will keep my promise. If you do not believe me, I will swear by Her Majesty the Empress\u2019 name.\u201dThe empress, which Artizea spoke of, did not refer to the present empress, but to the future empress, Lysia.Cadriol got it.He took the sword.The oath Artizea made under the name of the Saintess is unbelievable.And Artizea is right; He can\u2019t fight Evron in Evron.And even if it\u2019s on the sea, he wouldn\u2019t know. He had no ability to break the Shield of the Empire while on the ground.\u201cI will come back to pick you up.\u201dCadriol said that and turned around. Then he jumped over the body and ran out of the broken door.The whistle sounded. Cadriol gave the signal to the warriors of Eimmel to escape.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He left the rest to his subordinate.When he arrived at the mayor\u2019s residence, the mayor couple and employees who were waiting rushed out.\u201cYour Grace, I\u2019m glad that you\u2019re safe! The Grand Duchess too\u2026\u201d\u201cWhere is the bedroom?\u201dThe mayor hurried ahead and opened the door himself.Cedric climbed the stairs quickly, not handing Artizea over to the hands of the maids.\u201cRemove the blockade of the port, and let the stronghold know that the Grand Duchess is safe. Raise the beacon to release the alert.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dThe bedroom, which had been preheated before the start of the operation, was warm enough.Cedric put Artizea down on the armchair.Artizea, who had lost her energy, hung on the comfort of the chair.The cold and exhaustion of her physical strength completely left her body. She warmed up for a while at Cadriol\u2019s quarters. However, for more than a day, her body suffered from bone-chilling cold in the cabin and had no more energy.In the midst of the fight, she was too agitated and did not notice.However, when she came to her senses, her tension was relieved, so she no longer had any strength in her body.The mayor\u2019s wife said.\u201cLeave the work to us. You must be tired, too\u2026.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay, go back.\u201dCedric said without looking back at her.The mayor\u2019s wife read the vortex of emotions deep under his voice. She hurriedly knelt down on one of her knees and bowed.She then drove the maids away and closed the door.Thud!Cedric took off the steel gauntlet and threw it. The cloak and sword were also randomly stripped and thrown on the floor.Snow-soaked boots stained the carpet. Perhaps the black spot is not just mud.\u201cYour Grace\u2026\u201dHe dragged Artizea\u2019s armchair to the front of the fireplace.Artizea could smell the dust and faint blood on his body.\u201cHow, this far\u2026 how are you here?\u201d\u201cHow? Then, after hearing the news that you were kidnapped, do you think I was hunting in peace?\u201d\u201cNo, that\u2019s not it, the stronghold\u2026\u201dIt is not unusual for the defense of the stronghold to be broken.Since she fainted, Artizea didn\u2019t know everything about what was going on.However, it was easy to guess that someone in the stronghold would have informed the secret passage to Cadriol.In addition, the guards searched them and found no swords and smoke bombs.It was also evident that casualties were incurred in the battle a little while ago; even in Evron\u2019s stronghold, people would have died and injured.The biggest problem was that the trust of the Grand Duke would have been broken.Artizea bit her lower lip. She felt responsible.That wasn\u2019t directly Artizea\u2019s responsibility. Because she was not involved in the defense of the stronghold.However, it was undeniable that the underlying reason was with her.If Artizea hadn\u2019t been in the stronghold, Cadriol wouldn\u2019t have come this far.Cedric touched the armrest of the armchair.As if she was trapped in the armchair, Artizea withdrew her body.\u201cIs that more important to you?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cDo you have anything else to say to me?\u201dArtizea hesitated.She couldn\u2019t think well. She was both mentally and physically exhausted, and Cedric was too close.When Cedric appeared, she thought her heart stopped.She thought she could convince Cadriol. But it wasn\u2019t that she didn\u2019t care.She wasn\u2019t afraid of death. She was already dead once.But she didn\u2019t want to die without seeing Cedric again. Now that she\u2019s living like a human for the first time, she didn\u2019t want to leave this life.Even if she hadn\u2019t died, if she had been taken to the South Sea.[You\u2019ve always had Grand Duke Evron in your heart, so it\u2019s not unusual to do that.]Cadriol said so.Artizea denied that word. But his words were nailed to her chest.When he said he would make her forget everything, her heart was shaken for a moment.But she was happy Cedric came to the rescue, can she say that? What he lost was too great for that.Cedric looked down at her.Artizea saw a burning fire in his dark eyes. She saw herself trembling in it.She had tears in her eyes, then it trickled down.\u201cTia.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201dArtizea chose to apologize.The anger and frustration he felt was fully understandable.It would have been difficult for him to run directly to this place through the snow and cold. Since the stronghold was breached, the aftermath would not have been small.But Cedric prioritized her over that. He came to rescue her.But she told him to let the enemy go.If she knows she\u2019s sorry, she shouldn\u2019t shed tears. She did not deserve to be as sad as he deserves to be happy.However, the body, which reached its limit, did not listen.It always has been.It was easier to convince Cadriol. When talking about a great country, she could be rational.She could protect herself even if Cadriol threatened her with a knife under her neck.Even now. If Cedric asked her coldly why she told him to let Cadriol go, she could mix up dozens of subtle excuses.But in front of the person she liked, she was always a mess.Cedric reached out his hand. Artizea reflexively closed her eyes and curled her body.However, it was not violence, but a careful touch, like touching a thin glass.Artizea blankly opened her eyes.Cedric\u2019s face came close.Their lips touched.The first kiss was completely different from a good-night greeting.Artizea held her breath. Cedric swept her hair in one hand and hugged her back with the other.That hug was also completely different from what it used to be.\u201cYour Grace, um.\u201dHer lower lip was lightly bitten by his lips, so Artizea could not speak until the end.She was struggling. But she couldn\u2019t get out of Cedric\u2019s arms.Her body temperature soared suddenly. She didn\u2019t know if it was the temperature of her body or the temperature that was transmitted from Cedric\u2019s body.Her hands and feet were tingling. Hot blood seemed to seep into the veins of her body.\u201cYour\u2026 Grace\u2026\u201dArtizea strode close to his chest.She couldn\u2019t tell whether she was hanging because she had no place to support, or whether she was trying to push him out.\u201cDon\u2019t apologize. I don\u2019t want you to feel sorry for me.\u201d\u201cWell, then\u2026umm\u2026.\u201dHis lips touched hers again. Artizea groaned unknowingly.\u201cDo you know how I felt when I heard that you were gone?\u201dCedric said in a low voice. A hot breath mixed up between the two lips. As it was, he pressed his lips against Artizea\u2019s again. The answer was enough.\u201cI was running all night in the snow and I thought I couldn\u2019t live with losing you.\u201d\u201cYour Grace\u2026.\u201d\u201cMy stronghold broke down. I also knew that Jordyn had betrayed me, and the trust I believed was an illusion. I was supposed to feel like I\u2019ve lost everything\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not an illusion, it\u2019s not.\u201d\u201cBut, I only thought about you. As usual, I chose you over Evron, as if Evron was nothing if you were okay.\u201dArtizea trembled. It was both because of joy, and because of fear.Cedric leaned further.Her heart poured down. Artizea trembled and grabbed Cedric\u2019s hem.\u201cBut you threw yourself to protect me.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t do that. If His Highness Cadriol dies here, ummph.\u201dAgain, their lips overlapped.Cedric, who stopped her words with a kiss, lifted his lips and said.\u201cYou told me to do that, so I let him live. That\u2019s all my patience is. You don\u2019t have to defend it and you don\u2019t have to tell me why. I don\u2019t want to be messed up in front of you anymore.\u201d\u201cYour Grace.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t call me like that.\u201dCedric\u2019s hand swept her hair and wiped the tears from her cheek. His body was in close contact, and everything was too close.Artizea put her gaze down. The inside of her eyelids became hot again.Cedric touched the eyelid with his index finger. Knowing that the tears were welling, he did not tell Artizea not to cry.\u201cThis isn\u2019t right.\u201d\u201cI think so, too.\u201dShe is still young, and she was married to a guardian.He was only a contracted marriage partner who had promised protection for only two years. He called her his wife in front of Cadriol, but he wasn\u2019t Artizea\u2019s real husband.Nevertheless\u2026 no, that\u2019s why it seemed to burn her heart even more.Even Cedric himself didn\u2019t know that his feelings were so deep.Artizea shook his soul. After almost losing her, he just noticed that there were feelings that melted deep into his stomach.He wanted to hug her and warm her up. He wanted to touch her tenderly and kiss her.And just as much, he was angry and sad at her. There was a feeling of resentment and a feeling of hate.Cedric himself did not know where these feelings came from.However, even if she shed tears, it was okay if she was doing it in his arms.He could no longer hold himself back anymore.\u201cI love you.\u201d\u201cAh.\u2026.\u201dArtizea lifted her eyes to look at him and spit out a sigh.Now Cedric\u2019s voice was like a breathless sound.\u201cDon\u2019t say you didn\u2019t know. Didn\u2019t you avoid me because you knew?\u201dArtizea put her gaze down. Cedric\u2019s forehead touched hers. Then, Artizea closed her eyes.\u201cTia, I love you.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cThen, say \u2018I don\u2019t like it\u2019.\u201dShe couldn\u2019t say that.She has lived with countless lies, but she couldn\u2019t lie about that.He whispered with his lips almost over Artizea\u2019s lips.\u201cI love you.\u201dArtizea heard the words not by sound but by the touch.Her touching lips trembled. Ecstatic tremor ran through her back.She closed her eyes in a daze. It felt as if the floor had collapsed and fallen into hell.She knew it was a sin.But just once was fine. She wanted to be loved with all heart and body from someone she adored.Artizea eventually wrapped her arms around his neck weakly.Cedric hugged her tightly in his arms and kissed her deeper.\u201cDon\u2019t think about anything, I\u2019m the only one watching, Tia.\u201d\u201c\u2026..\u201d\u201cDo you hate it?\u201d\u201cNo\u2026.. Lord Cedric.\u201dArtizea replied with a voice that seemed to be fading out.The fireplace light burned red.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The cold air shook her bare shoulders.She suddenly realized that she was in the bed with her naked body.\u2018Ah\u2026..\u2019She came to her senses.Artizea recalled last night\u2019s event and her face turned red.The inside of the blanket was chilling.Artizea hesitated to lie back.Cedric sat in front of the fireplace with his shirt on. He was picking up firewood with poker and lighting up a flame.The red fire made his face line look deeper. Whenever the flame grew, the shadow on her eyes shook.His face seemed to be engulfed in agony.Artizea briefly looked at Cedric\u2019s side face.After the anger and enthusiasm faded away, was he regretting it now?Artizea was caught up in such anxiety.Artizea, herself, did not regret it.No, she regretted it.A little bit of favor and a little bit of a friendly hug can be forgotten if you turn a blind eye to it. However, this cannot be said to have never happened.Can they separate like this? After she breaks up, can she casually remain as his servant?She won\u2019t be able to.Artizea knows that she will carry last night\u2019s event for the rest of her life.However, she did not regret it. Even if this was a sin, even if it was for a single night, she was happy.\u201cAhhh\u2026\u2026\u201dA long sigh flowed out.She had a lot to think about.How will she atone the sins to Lysia.With a simple contract marriage, it was already a great sin for her to hold the name of his wife for a while.So is what she promised Cadriol.What she suggested to him was something she had to do anyway.Rather, it was a bigger concern that he had memories of the past.It was the first time that such large-scale magic was actually cast, rather than trying a simple and small magic such as \u201cLight\u201d.There may have been something wrong.Or maybe it\u2019s a flaw inherent in magic itself. She didn\u2019t study with a magic example that was completed in the first place.At that time, she thought she drew the magic circle perfectly, but when she thinks about it now, it might not be.She used to think that she was able to think properly, but she might not have been sane because the aftereffects of torture remained.Maybe someone else, too, has their memory other than Cadriol.Then there was a need to make a full revision of the plan.Uncertainty increases with the existing information. There will also be those who are hostile to her like Cadriol.Most of all, when another person who knows her in the past appears, it might be then Cedric really knows what kind of person she is\u2026\u201cTia.\u201dDazed in thought, Cedric felt her awakening and turned his head.He put down the poker and approached Artizea.\u201cDid I wake you up because of the rustling?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dArtizea replied with a split voice. Her throat was sore, so the sound didn\u2019t come out well.Cedric sat by the bed and covered her in the blanket thoroughly.And he looked down at her with a somewhat complicated face.\u201cIt\u2019s still long before dawn. Sleep more.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026..\u201dArtizea softly closed her eyes.But Cedric was right next to her, so she couldn\u2019t fall asleep easily.As she felt her breathing trembling, Cedric asked in a soft voice.\u201cDo you regret it?\u201d\u201c\u2026..no.\u201d\u201cI thought you might ask me to forget it because it was a mistake.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Lord Cedric\u2026..\u201dShe wanted to ask if it was a mistake.However, she didn\u2019t ask until the end, afraid of the answer that might come.Cedric was silent for a moment. So Artizea became scared. Anxiety shook her body.His hands covered Artizea\u2019s eyes.Cedric sighed. He then bowed his head and put his lips on her temple.\u201cI\u2019ve never thought about it like that. I\u2019ve never made a mistake about something like this\u2026.\u201d\u201cLord Cedric\u2026..\u201d\u201cRather\u2026.. I thought I should have done this a long time ago.\u201dThere was a faint trembling in his voice, as he was saying \u2018a long time ago\u2019.So Artizea tried to ask about what it meant.However, she forgot about it because of Cedric\u2019s next words.\u201cI\u2019d like to make it as if we didn\u2019t have a contract, Tia.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026..? \u201cArtizea was surprised and tried to raise her body. Because she understood it to mean to cancel the marriage.But Cedric didn\u2019t remove his hand that covered her eyes. He was able to defeat Artizea\u2019s resistance with just a little strength in his hand.\u201cPlease make the proposal I made as just a proposal. Regardless of the contract or the like.\u201dArtizea took a breath. Cedric said, still covering her eyes.\u201cGive me your left hand.\u201dArtizea hesitated to pull her hand out of the blanket.Cedric held her left hand lightly. Cold metal passed through her hand and caught on her wrist.She hadn\u2019t taken it out for months, so Artizea knew right away what it was. It was the diamond bracelet she got from Cedric.\u201cWould you marry me, Marchioness Rosan?\u201dArtizea held her breath. The answer was stuck in her throat and could not come out.Cedric smiled generously and faintly.\u201cWe already had a wedding, but it doesn\u2019t mean anything. I just wanted to.\u201d\u201c\u2026.. Yes\u2026.\u201d\u201cFar a long time ago, I should have done this. \u201cHe said so in a soft voice.Artizea thought it was fortunate that Cedric covered her eyes.He won\u2019t be able to find her eyes with tears or her body trembling under the blanket.\u201cBefore\u2026 You told me to ask you if I felt suspicious because it seemed that you\u2019re hiding something.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026..\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll ask instead. Don\u2019t forget what I\u2019m saying now, even if we\u2019re against each other, if you\u2019re suspicious of me or I\u2019m suspicious of you, on the contrary.\u201dCedric removed his hand from her eyes. Then he bent over and looked into Artizea\u2019s eyes.\u201cNo matter who you are, no matter what you do, even if you put a dagger in my heart, you are my only wife.\u201d\u201c\u2026..\u201dArtizea couldn\u2019t answer.Cedric said as she lowered her gaze down.\u201cTia, what is the answer?\u201d\u201cI understand\u2026.\u201dHow could Artizea say it shouldn\u2019t be?She replied, pressing her thumping heart. Cedric smiled faintly.A sweet kiss fell over Artizea\u2019s mouth.As Artizea flinched, she grabbed the hem of his shirt and gently opened her mouth.Cedric lifted her lips and opened his eyes. Then he touched her hair and smiled.Artizea, bowed her head, blushing.\u201cNow let\u2019s go to bed. When we get up, we have to start with the stronghold.\u201d\u201cLord Cedric, you too\u2026.\u201dShe was embarrassed to ask if he was sleeping. It was because she was going to ask if he would lie next to her.Cedric said.\u201cI just refilled the fireplace with firewood. I need to make sure that the fire catches on. Go to bed first.\u201dArtizea nodded her head.Cedric stood up and patted her sweetly.Artizea boiled down surprisingly easily this time.Her body was very tired, and her hands and feet were warm. The inside of her chest was still thumping and it made random noises, but she quickly forgot.Cedric sat in front of the fireplace until the fire rose. Then he returned to the bed.And he sighed out loud.Artizea was deeply asleep. After confirming it, he confessed directly to her.\u201cYou are the first and the last woman I thought I wanted. Before and after. Maybe, even if I had another life to come, it would be the same.\u201dOf course, a sleeping person cannot answer.But it was good enough for him.Cedric laid next to Artizea and hugged her. It felt like he was embracing regret and happiness together.***The next day, Artizea woke up early in the morning.The mayor\u2019s wife, who woke her up, said with regrets.\u201cIt would be nice if you can settle for one more day and then leave tomorrow\u2026.\u201d\u201cBecause what happened to the stronghold is not a small issue. We can\u2019t delay.\u201dArtizea said so.It was better to go to the stronghold to settle things.She slept warmly last night, but she can\u2019t get Cedric stuck that way all day long.The heating facility of the official residence fell far short of the Grand Duchess\u2019 room in the stronghold.Artizea borrowed the mayor\u2019s wife\u2019s clothes instead of her ruined clothes. She dedicated both of her only coats of fur to Artizea.Artizea decided to give her a reward beyond that.Cedric finished the preparations early and shared a meal with her.He was back with a cool, usual face, whether all of his fatigue had been relieved by just having a good night\u2019s sleep, or thanks to the solution to the frustrating problem.\u201cDo you have anywhere uncomfortable?\u201d\u201cThere isn\u2019t\u201dArtizea said, blushing her face a little. In fact, it wasn\u2019t without any at all.\u201cThe road will be a little rough because maintenance is not possible due to the snow. The carriage wouldn\u2019t work very well.\u201d\u201cI think it\u2019s better to go back and rest. I\u2019m worried about the stronghold.\u201d\u201cThank you for understanding.\u201dCedric nodded his head.\u201cI had something I wanted to tell you.\u201dArtizea said so carefully. Cedric spoke ahead of her.\u201cIf you\u2019re talking about the South Sea people, it\u2019s okay not to explain it. You\u2019re not someone who does things for no reason.\u201d\u201cNot that. Last night\u2026 I wanted to tell you about what you said that trust is an illusion.\u201d\u201cTia.\u201dCedric looked at her with wonder.\u201cI never thought that Lord Cedric\u2019s trust was built on an illusion.\u201d\u201cTia\u2026..\u201d\u201cI think betrayal can happen anywhere, but\u2026 nonetheless, the people of Evron Grand Duchy haven\u2019t really betrayed. It\u2019s just that they think differently about the way Cedric and Evron are.\u201dArtizea said earnestly.She knew that Evron really didn\u2019t betray him. Rather, if the trust was broken because of her, betrayal could have really sparked.\u201cEveryone\u2019s thoughts are different. I know. I just realized it anew.\u201dCedric said.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I still believe in good intention and justice.\u201dHe said so. Then he bowed his head and kissed Artizea.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Even the sound was quiet as it was covered with snow. Artizea thought that this was like going to an empty place without directions.Of course, to the knights and Cedric surrounding the carriage, it was different. For them, it was a familiar road that they went through thousands of times more.Knock, knock.The sound of a tapping on the wooden shutters caused Artizea to carefully lower the shutters. Cedric looked in and asked.\u201cShall we take a break?\u201d\u201cCan I take a break?\u201d\u201cBecause it\u2019s the beginning of the forest, there\u2019s less wind. If you move for a while, your body will be more comfortable.\u201dArtizea nodded her head. It was lonesome to sit alone in a small carriage with all the windows closed.Cedric opened the carriage door and reached out his hand. Artizea was a little shy and took the hand.He held Artizea down.Cedric said it was less windy, but that didn\u2019t mean the wind stopped.Artizea gathered and grasped her hair blown away by the blade of wind. She wanted to untie her ribbon and tie it back, but she didn\u2019t dare to take off her mittens.Her white face quickly turned red in the cold breeze. Cedric took off his gloves, reopened the collar of her coat, and wrapped her cheeks with both hands.\u201cYour hands will be sore.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay for a while. Isn\u2019t the carriage uncomfortable?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I didn\u2019t have a choice anyway.\u201dThe official residence\u2019s four-wheeled carriage wasn\u2019t worth bringing. There is a need for inspection, and it is because the carriage itself was heavy.It was the same with Artizea that even though the road was a little more difficult, it was better to get to the stronghold quickly. She was also worried about the stronghold. That is why she chose to ride alone in a small, light two wheeled carriage.The wagons rattled without pause, and the walls were thin, so the draft was intact.However, even if it is a four-wheeled carriage, that does not mean that the cold will disappear, anyway. She missed the carriage of the stronghold that could put a small brazier.\u201cWhen I first came here, I thought there would be nothing more difficult than taking a boat.\u201dArtizea smiled. Even at that time, she suffered a lot because of her motion sickness.But it was nothing compared to going through this road.\u201cMove your legs. We have to keep going until evening.\u201dCedric said so and put his gloves on again. Then he grabbed Artizea\u2019s arms on both sides.Artizea looked up puzzledly, not knowing why he was doing it. Cedric smiled and pulled her arm straight up.\u201cAw aw.\u201dFrom her stiff shoulder, there was a crunch.\u201cBecause you didn\u2019t even walk in the cold while you were in the stronghold.\u201d\u201cI walked a little in the living room.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of exercise is spinning around in a room?\u201dArtizea knew nothing to say, so she laughed shamelessly. Cedric lowered her arm.Then he stretched it to the left and right this time.\u201cUgh.\u201dAs Artizea groaned, Cedric pulled out his hand.He clenched and opened his fist a few times.Artizea regrets a little because it was cold.Cedric sighed softly. Then he brightened his expression.\u201cShall we take a walk in the castle next time?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Yes.\u201dArtizea blushed her cheeks.Then she sighed and looked up. The forest is not deep, so she can see the sky and snow-capped mountain ranges through the coniferous forests.\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d\u201cI think the future is far away.\u201dCedric wrapped her shoulder lightly. Artizea closed her eyes for a moment as she seemed to be buried in the hem of his cloak.It only stopped the wind, and it was worse for Cedric as his outerwear was colder. Because he continued to ride the horse. But he still warmed her body.Artizea thought it was not bad to enjoy all the joy in her life for a moment.\u201cDon\u2019t be nervous. It\u2019s just the beginning.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWould you like to walk?\u201dCedric took his steps. Artizea also walked slowly under his arm.There was a crisp sound in the snow. Her boots got wet on the outside.\u201cYou can go first. If you go alone, you can shorten your time a lot.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s all right.\u201d\u201cYou came after me with only temporary measures at the stronghold.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, but there\u2019s nothing in a hurry. Isn\u2019t it funny to run out to save you and go back alone?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s true that you saved me. What do you think? I\u2019m telling you to go back first to take care of emergencies, because the way back is hard.\u201d\u201cI may misunderstand that you do it because you want to avoid me again.\u201d\u201cI never did that.\u201d\u201cTia, I\u2019m not particularly quick to notice, but that doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m completely stupid. You think I didn\u2019t know you were trying to leave me on Lysia?There was nothing to say, so Artizea bit her lips. Cedric lamented.\u201cDon\u2019t think it\u2019s okay. It\u2019s a nuisance to Lysia in the first place.\u201d\u201cWho says I did?\u201d\u201cYou pushed your young maid to serve tea to your husband. I thought that was something of a bad political marriage.\u201dArtizea\u2019s face turned red.She knew she was hungry for his affection.Once she starts wishing, she will be obsessed with dedicating her life to him. Once he holds his hand out, she will never be able to sway from his side.She wasn\u2019t sure when Cedric and Lysia fell in love in the past.What is certain is that Cedric proposed to Lysia, who accepted the proposal.It was about five years after Lysia became a saintess.There was little Cedric could gain from that marriage. This is because she was a vassal of Evron Grand Duchy.He rather lost his prestige. Considering that she was from the rebel village, it also created a risk.Still, the two had decided to marry.Had Artizea not manipulated the oracle, the two would have married and kept the Grand Duchy together.Lysia broke her engagement because of a divine message that she would be the Empress. She was worried that Cedric would be harmed because of the divine message.Cedric left the capital and never returned again after Lysia and Lawrence were married.And he hasn\u2019t been with any other woman in his lifetime. Before and after.In the end, she took Cedric away from Lysia again this time.Artizea looked at Cedric in a confused mood.Again, will his heart naturally lean toward Lysia after time passes?It seemed so. How can he not love someone who is beautiful and has a shining heart like Lysia.But maybe this time, neither of them was in a difficult situation, so the deep affection and bonds of the past could not build up.\u2018Wouldn\u2019t it be okay then?\u2019When all this is done anyway, she doesn\u2019t know if she will be alive.So, wouldn\u2019t it be okay until then?Her heart pounded because she felt guilty just thinking about it.However, what would be different if she puts one more feeling on the many evils she has committed so far?The future has already changed. Cedric could not be returned to Lysia in full condition.This marriage was established as a real marriage. No man has ever given his heart solely to Lysia.\u2018He loves me.\u2019The moment she recalled the words, a fever soared all over her body.The two are not in love with each other, yet. It has not been stolen by Artizea, yet.So just a little more like this.Just until Cedric\u2019s heart is taken away from her.\u201cTia, what are you thinking?\u201dCedric called her and asked.\u201cIt\u2019s your strength to think deeply, but that\u2019s also a downside. I\u2019m too worried.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201dArtizea tried to divert her gaze, but Cedric caught it and looked into all sorts of emotions frosted inside her eyes.And he lowered his head.His lips touched hers briefly inside the coverage of the cloak. Artizea closed her eyes unknowingly.At that moment, she had no thoughts, no guilt, no complicated mind.She slowly opened her eyes only after Cedric\u2019s lips fell.Cedric tried to get his gaze off Artizea\u2019s all-bitten lips. Her lips, which usually don\u2019t have much blood, looked red today.He impulsively reached out his other hand and touched her lips. Artizea\u2019s face turned red.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to try to concede me to someone else.\u201d\u201cThat\u2026.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay if you\u2019re mistaken. That\u2019s what you\u2019re doing very wrong with me, Tia.\u201dArtizea bowed her head with a scorching face. It was actually the opposite.She was thinking that it would be okay to sin so that she could take possession of him.She carefully grabbed Cedric\u2019s cuffs.\u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026 because I\u2019m not used to it.\u201dIt didn\u2019t seem like she would ever get used to someone putting her first.Cedric once again lowered his head.This kiss was a little bit deeper and a little bit longer than before. Artizea grabbed Cedric\u2019s hem, breathing embarrassingly through her nose.Cedric hugged Artizea\u2019s back, who had lost her balance. He bit Artizea\u2019s lower lip with regret. And he set her upright.When he suddenly looked around, the knights were all looking at different places.Some were staring into the air, while others were absorbed in the stain on the nose of their shoes or observing the bark of the trees.Cedric coughed in vain. Artizea lowered her head because her face turned red.\u201cWe should get going. We\u2019ll be able to get to the accommodation before they close.\u201d\u201cYes. \u201c\u201cIsn\u2019t it wet inside the boots?\u201d\u201cYes? Oh, it\u2019s okay. Ah!\u201dCedric hugged her. Artizea was embarrassed.However, instead of struggling, she hugged his shoulders and buried her face on the back of his neck.\u201cYou told me I had to walk\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a field of snow.\u201dCedric said in a cracked voice.\u201cIf we go a little further, you can rest properly, so be patient.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dIt was then.Hooo!In the distance, the sound of the scouts horns rang out.Cedric was shocked. He hastily rushed Artizea into the carriage.\u201cWhat happened, kaak!\u201dThe door of the carriage was closed in front of her.Cedric shouted.\u201cTake aim!\u201dFrom a distance, the roar of the beast screeched.And the sound came in an instant like an avalanche. Artizea could not clearly tell the difference between the distant and near cry.Ta-dang!The sound of the first firing shook the carriage like thunder.\u201cHow is Karam here!\u201dSomeone yelled.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 82": "Chapter 82Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 82Proofreader: somniumBang!Twenty guns fired all at once.However, the speed of the rushing Karam group was not slowed down at all.Rather, as if they were familiar with the sound of the gun, they leaned on their stomach, lowered their height to avoid bullets, and ran with their four arms and two legs.Karam\u2019s back is covered with pure white fur. So the shape looked as if snow became waves and pouring out.\u201cKaha! Kahaho!\u201dThe sound of shouting came through the wind.Collin, a young knight, breathed in the overbearing form.He made a merit in the Western Army and was erected as a knight. And he followed Cedric to the north for the first time this year.He\u2019s experienced enough of the battle with the monsters.However, this was the first time for Karam.He learned enough to know that Karam is different from other monsters. However, he turned blue at Karam\u2019s momentum.Outside of Evron, Karam was just the name of a fierce monster. The same was true in the west.Collin was imagining something like a bunch of small ogres. Of course, he would be weaker than an ogre.However, facing Karam face-to-face was fundamentally different.They could not be mistaken for humans. Karam had four arms and three eyes, and their height was slightly over two meters.Their dense muscles were tough enough to be called a monster\u2019s. Agility and physical mobility were also more overwhelming than humans\u2019.Conversely, compared to humans, they were similar enough to find little differences.No one comes to this world and says that trolls do not resemble humans.However, there are many people who say Karam is different from humans. Even in the temple.Karam walked on their two feet and used their hands. Their fur was only on their back and head. They knew how to make tools and use weapons. They developed mines and built farms. They put on clothes.They were different in the structure of the vocal cords, and they screamed in something that humans could not imitate, and they could not imitate people\u2019s words. However, they communicated via their language.They lived divided into several tribes, and there was also political conflict between the tribes.The use of hands was not as sophisticated as humans, and the tactics were simple. However, it was clearly different from the existence that could be called a monster.Northerners did not think of Karam as a simple monster. There is also barter-level trade. There is also a mixed race between humans and Karam.But the people in the mainland would not be able to comprehend such things. Although Collin knew about it, this was his first time to see them in person.Although it resembles a human, the apparently different beings are lying down and running with their four hands and two feet, giving an instinctive sense of rejection and fear.Another knight tapped the terrified Collin on the shoulder.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Have you ever dealt with a direwolf?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s weaker than that.\u201dThose words didn\u2019t wash away his fears.\u201cKaha!\u201dThe Karam leader roared and jumped to his feet. The leap distance was quite a few meters.Cedric was the first to sped up his horse and ran forward, wielding his sword.Slash!The leaping Karam\u2019s neck was cut by the sword.\u201cAlphonse, Ned, Collin, by the carriage!\u201dCedric shouted. Three knights were ordered to surround the carriage in a triangle.The remaining seventeen got off their horses and made the first defending line.There wouldn\u2019t be any window.However, the equipment they had now was a hunting gun that they could not afford to reload and a sword on their back. There was no advantage to raising body height over Karam.While riding a horse, they could be struck by Karam in the face. It was impossible to trample through Karam\u2019s ranks. Mobility is useless. This is because there was the Grand Duchess\u2019 carriage at the back.Besides, if they lose their horse, it freezes and dies in this snowy field. It is different from leaving a supply unit behind during war.\u201cKak, Kaheim!\u201dAnother Karam, who ran for the second time, stood up. And he swung four axes at once.Cedric pulled the reins. The excellent horse avoided Karam\u2019s ax by mixing back and side steps.Cedric struck one ax and pierced his sword forward to strike the other with his sword. The Karam\u2019s primitive ax cracked and stuck to the tip of his sword.He struck the jammed ax with his sword in the face of the surprised Karam. The Karam staggered and swung two axes in his other hand.Cedric drew his gun with his left hand and used it to strike the Karamgun. And then he drew his sword down.Slash!The Karam\u2019s head split and steam rose.It all happened in an instant.Thud!The Karam, who had lost his neck, fell to the ground. The hot blood melted the snow.Cedric slowly lifted his blood-soaked sword.The Karam must be attacked first at the captain. Due to the characteristics of the race in which the strongest person becomes the captain, this was an act of showing off his authority and power not only to enemies but also to allies.In line with that, Cedric also killed two of their leaders, proving that he was the captain.It was in order to not draw any attention to the carriage behind him by pulling Karam\u2019s gaze.\u201cKak!\u201dThe Karams let out a shout.Cedric got off his horse.The next moment, both sides got entangled.Artizea held her trembling hand in the carriage.She did not know the war.Cedric once showed her what it was like after the war. But this was the first time she was in the middle of one.\u201cArgh!\u201dWith a scream, a knight bumped into the carriage. The carriage rattled loudly once.Subsequently, an ax blade was stuck on the side wall of the carriage.Artizea tried to stay in the middle of the carriage as much as possible. It was the limit of her ability to hold her breath in order to not scream.The ax blade soon fell from the carriage wall.\u201cKahak!\u201dThis time, there was a flurry that seemed to be breaking the wind.Alphonse tapped the shutter and asked.\u201cAre there any injuries, Your Grace?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201dArtizea held her breath and she replied slowly.\u201cIs this a dangerous situation?\u201d\u201c\u2026 It\u2019s fine.\u201dThere was some time gap before Alphonse\u2019s reply. Artizea knows that it\u2019s a pretty dangerous situation.However, it was best for her not to get in the way of the knights.\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201dAlphonse said so.However, there was a difference in numbers from the beginning.The Evron Knights were all elite, but they were not properly equipped for war.On the other hand, Karam fights with physical strength with the inherently poor equipment.If there were two spears, it would not have reached this situation. Their number was also twice that of Karam.This degree of number difference is also their advantage.It was then.Whooooo!The sound of a loud horn blew.One of the knights shouted.\u201cIt\u2019s a reinforcement!\u201dThe Karam also understood the meaning of the sound.\u201cKak!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t let them retreat! If we miss it here, the nearby town will be in danger!\u201dThe remaining knights raised their swords high and intercepted.Clop clop clop.The sound of the Knights\u2019 horse hooves shook the ground.The scared Karam scattered around trying to run away. The knights stopped it.The number of reinforcements was only 30. However, they were heavily armed.It was enough to trample the Karam troops.The knight pierced the abdomen of the Karam, who was coming at him, and kicked it with his horse hooves. Another knight struck the spear on the Karam\u2019s back, avoiding any retaliation.The war situation quickly turned over in an instant.Then, four Karam, who had been dealing with the knights until now, ran toward the carriage.The Karam had already grasped that the knights were guarding the carriage.If there was anyone important on it, they thought they would take them hostage and settle the situation.\u201cOh, ah ah!\u201dInstead of the missing weapon, Karam pulled out their nails and grabbed Collin. A screaming sounded.\u201cYour Grace!\u201dThe moment Cedric turned around towards the call, a spear flew into his hand precisely.\u201cThank you, Lysia!\u201dCedric threw his sword and raised the spear with both hands.The body of the last Karam was tucked into the ground. The situation ended with it.***After that, Artizea was escorted out of the carriage. It was hardly possible to judge how the war was going.\u201cLysia?\u201d\u201cYou have to hurry.\u201dNot having time to explain anything, Lysia put Artizea on her horse.There was an injured person who injured his leg, but instead of getting him in a carriage, he was picked up by another knight\u2019s horse. The body of the deceased was also quickly put on someone\u2019s horse.No one said anything. Fifty horses ran frantically to their original destination.Artizea desperately hung on Lysia\u2019s waist. She was covered with a cape from the top of her head, but it was hard to overcome the cold.Collin, the injured person, made a painful sound without ceasing.The messenger who ran ahead opened the village door and was waiting.As soon as Cedric arrived, he went into the room, holding Collin.Two knights tied Collin\u2019s body tightly to the bed with a rope. They then removed the blood-soaked cloth and leather pieces from his arm.\u201cHow\u2019s his condition?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s already rotting up above the elbow.\u201d\u201cI will do it myself.\u201dA knight heated his sword on the fire and poured alcohol to disinfect it.Cedric grabbed Collin\u2019s face.\u201cCan you hear me, Sir Collin? Sir Collin!\u201d\u201cUhhhhhh\u2026\u201d\u201cYou have nail venom on your arm. If you leave Karam\u2019s nail venom alone, it will continue to rot and your muscles will die. I\u2019ll have to cut off the wound.\u201dCollin nodded as he trembled.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll cut out only the wound. It will take some time to do anything, but there will be no problem with your arm. Understand?\u201dImmediately, the knights gagged Collin\u2019s mouth. It was to prevent biting the tongue with the pain when cutting it out.Alcohol was also poured into the wound. As the blood was washed away, the tattered arm was revealed with scratches of fingernails and necrotic skin.Cedric raised his sword.It is a lie that there will be no abnormalities in the arm. If he cut off this much muscle, there will definitely be some problems, not unlike cutting off an arm.Life as a knight is over anyway.\u201cUmmmmpphhhhh!\u201dCollin screamed, gagged.The cutting ended quickly. Next, a hemostatic agent was sprayed on the wound and wrapped a cloth on it.More than that can only be left to God.While putting the bandage, Cedric threw the sword and held Collin\u2019s head. And he said, while kissing his forehead.\u201cIt\u2019s okay. It\u2019s okay. It\u2019s a common operation here, so nothing will happen.\u201dCollin quieted as he held onto him and suppressed his struggle. He fainted.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Artizea knew that she was trembling.The village chief had the bathroom ready. Lysia immersed her first in lukewarm water to prevent frostbite.The maids poured hot water little by little and melted her frozen body.\u201cHo, how \u2026\u2026?\u201dHer lips were also trembling, so the words that came out were only that much.Lysia replied.\u201cThere was a report yesterday morning that some of Karam\u2019s small troops were found.\u201d\u201cBeyond Thold\u2026..?\u201dThe Thold Mountains are grim.Except for the canyon called the Thold Gate, there is no way for the military to move.So, for hundreds of years, the war with Karam has been centered around the Thold Gate.As far as Artizea knows, it was.Lysia said.\u201cIt\u2019s not impossible to cross the mountain range at all. Hunters and herbalists are quite frequent, the traders and the slash-and-burn farmers are also going around. In the case of personal crossing, we turn a blind eye.\u201dIt was more like an agreement between Karam and Evron.Trade is also taking place in that way. It is impossible to act as a spy anyway, because of the lack of communication and appearance.However, it was never before that a group of close to 40 Karam personally crossed the mountain range.That\u2019s why Cedric initially fired a threatening shot.From the beginning, the guns, the knights had, were only a secondary armament with a short range and weak firepower. As long as it didn\u2019t hit the vital spot, it wasn\u2019t a threat to Karam.Still, he fired it in order to hear the gunshot and see Karam react.And instead of scattering, the Karams lowered themselves and came running.All of them must be on the rank of warriors.\u201cWe sent out scout troops in various places. Then I was worried about the Grand Duchess. It was impossible to escape if the Grand Duchess\u2019 carriage encountered Karam, and all the equipment that the Grand Duke took were all hunting equipment.\u201dWhen fighting a few people, that was enough. However, if Karam is the opponent, they must be equipped with a minimum amount of armament.Artizea\u2019s complexion returned to her face. Lysia made her come out of the water.The maids wiped Artizea\u2019s body and wrapped her hair. Cotton trousers and tops were put on.Lysia rested and sighed.\u201cI care about the clothes you\u2019re wearing and the carriage you\u2019re riding on\u2026\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to.\u201d\u201cI should.\u201dLysia struggled with her smile. She was struggling to control her emotions.Even Artizea wasn\u2019t at peace with her mind. How many people have died?Downstairs there was still a repressive scream. It was the sound of a knight with an injured leg being treated.Then Artizea was guided to a room where the fire was warmly lit.The only proper house was the village chief\u2019s house, so Cedric and the commander of the reinforcements and several knights also came here.\u201cTia, are you hurt?\u201dCedric saw Artizea and asked. Artizea shook her head.\u201cI\u2019m fine. More than that\u2026\u2026\u201dShe carefully looked at the people. A solemn atmosphere hung among the knights.\u201cSix dead and seven are injured, two of which are seriously injured. Sir Ned will be fine. He\u2019s not someone to lie down for a long time with a cut in his thigh.\u201dCedric said. Considering that they faced twice as many Karam with 20 people without proper equipment, it was worth saying that they did well.Artizea couldn\u2019t ask if Collin was okay, so she looked down at her toes.\u201cThank you for the timely support. If it had been a little late, we would have been in trouble.\u201d\u201cThanks to Baron Morten. Most of the scouts were already moving towards where the Karam troops were seen. They heard the sound of a fight while they were moving with the carriage and clothes to meet the Grand Duchess.\u201d\u201cGood job, Lysia.\u201d\u201cOf course, it\u2019s something I have to do.\u201dLysia replied briefly.\u201cWhy does the warrior class wander around this place?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m looking into it now.\u201dCedric pondered for a moment.Artizea was dizzy in her head.As she remembers there is no war this year.Changes in the situation inside the empire must have affected the Karam. There is no one who could communicate that closely with Karam.Artizea only first found out about that possibility when she came to Evron. It would be right to think that people in other regions don\u2019t know.\u201cIt\u2019s better to take a break today first. You all go back and take a rest. The sun has set.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe footsteps of the knights retreating rumbled.Lysia also turned around.The door is closed.Cedric stayed there for a while, covering his face with both hands. He was overwhelmed with emotions.Artizea stood still on the spot.When she started the war, and when she killed his people, did he have a face like this?It must have been. Countless times.When she thought about it, her heart fluttered and it became difficult to breathe.Every time she exhaled, it was hot like she was burned in the chest. She couldn\u2019t even keep her eyes open.So, as she stood still with her eyes closed, Cedric approached her.\u201cAh.\u201dArtizea was startled and stepped back. Cedric grabbed her arm and pulled her into his embrace.\u201cWait a minute, stay like this.\u201dHe stayed there for a long time without saying anything. Artizea stiffened her body.It would be great if she could hug him face to face. Someone who can do that had to be here.But all Artizea could do was to touch Cedric\u2019s hair with care and anxiety.Sticky dirt smeared his hair, as if he had wiped blood from only his face and hands.\u201cDo you think I\u2019m right?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI wiped, kissed and comforted the injured\u2026 Every time I do something like that, I feel like an evil hypocrite and it\u2019s hard to bear.\u201d\u201cWhy\u2026\u2026. do you think so?\u201dThere are many people in the world who think of the lives of soldiers like chess pieces made of paper.There weren\u2019t many people who thought it was a waste to decrease as they deal with troop numbers.On the other hand, why is Cedric a hypocrite who remembers each and every person and takes care of their wounds?Artizea knew that he would not forget that he had treated Collin here.He will take care of Collin\u2019s family, and he will take care of Collin\u2019s life to the end. He was such a person.\u201cIt was just that I brought Sir Collin to this place to fight.\u201d\u201cIt was Sir Collin who decided to follow Lord Cedric. The knight has given all their loyalty, so you can honor him as a Knight.\u201dCedric said with dark eyes.\u201cYes, I am loyal.\u201d\u201cLord Cedric\u2026.\u201d\u201cThe better I do, the more the soldiers will die for me.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not a hypocritical act to gain loyalty, you do it from the heart.\u201d\u201cBut the results are the same. Sometimes I feel that I\u2026\u2026\u2026am telling the soldiers to die for me.\u201dArtizea couldn\u2019t say anything.\u201cDo you think there is value in goodwill that leads to unfortunate consequences? Is there any value in a righteous process that leaves nothing but sacrifice?\u201d\u201cLord Cedric\u2026.\u201d\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be better to let go of it all? Is it worth the sacrifice of someone else to me?\u201dCedric asked Artizea, but it didn\u2019t seem like he was hoping for an answer.He was silent again.She gently stroked his face with her trembling hands. There were no tears around her eyes, but it almost seemed like there was.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to explain, but\u2026.\u201d\u201cTia.\u201d\u201cI think that those who have no doubt, will have no regrets to die for Lord Cedric as well.\u201dCedric bit his mouth.\u2018You think like that because you don\u2019t know a real hypocrite or a real evil.\u2019Artizea couldn\u2019t say that. Instead, she gently hugged his head.She didn\u2019t dare to give strength to her arm in this embrace.***In the early morning of that day, Cedric covered the bodies of the dead knights with a handcrafted white cloth.\u201cThe people from the stronghold will come separately.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe village chief bowed his head.A short condolence ended with silence and salute. A proper funeral will later be held in the stronghold afterward.Four beacons of fire and smoke erupted into the dawn sky in the distance. It was a signal from the fortress at the Thold Gate.\u201cAt the end of the day, there was a problem in Thold too.\u201dThe knight said so.\u201cI have to go.\u201dCedric sighed.One beacon signifies the border, two beacons signify a local conflict, and three beacons signify that a large army of Karam is coming.And the four beacons mean that decision makers\u2019 instructions are needed right now.\u201cIs it a war?\u201dAsked Artizea. Cedric replied.\u201cI\u2019m not sure. Rather, I think there is a high possibility that there may be a problem inside Karam. If so, then it won\u2019t be possible to come with an all-out war to our side either.\u201d\u201cFrom the inside?\u201d\u201cThere are several forces inside Karam, so there is a conflict. I know that for the past few years, there have been those who have held the dominant power\u2026\u201dCedric said so, and gently patted Artizea\u2019s cheek.\u201cDon\u2019t worry too much. It doesn\u2019t mean that the war has erupted yet. Go to the stronghold. I\u2019ve only taken a temporary measure, so please take care of it.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cI have to go to the Thold Gate.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201d\u201cYou can leave military matters to Agate himself.\u201dArtizea nodded her head.Cedric called Lysia this time.\u201cLysia.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cI believe in you. Stay with Tia.\u201dLysia bent her knees and raised a salute.\u201cMorten\u2019s daughter will take the order.\u201dCedric finally put his hands on Artizea\u2019s shoulders. Then he bent his head to meet her eyes.It was as if he was trying to engrave her gaze in his eyes.\u201cTia, I trust you, so you trust me too.\u201d\u201cLord Cedric\u2026.\u201d\u201cEverything you do is my responsibility. Don\u2019t forget.\u201dShe heard it before. However, the weight was different from when she heard at that time.The heavy addition seemed to fall over her heart\u201cWe\u2019ll be able to find the right way when we go together.\u201dArtizea did not nod her head. She couldn\u2019t.Cedric hugged her once and let her go.\u201cI\u2019ll be back.\u201dHe said so and put his hat on. And climbed onto the horse.Five knights followed him on horseback. Six horses ran toward the north like a flurry.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Her cotton clothes and coat that Lysia brought with her were also warm, so she was quite comfortable.Artizea sat silently. Her mind was complicated.Lysia, who sat face to face with her, said softly.\u201cSir Collin and Sir Ned would be fine. The treatment was fast enough, so if the wound healed, they would be able to live normally.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not worried about injuries.\u201dArtizea said so and looked out of the window.What she is concerned about is Cedric.There is a small furnace in the carriage. A cold wind came through the open window to get rid of the smoke.\u201cDoes Lord Cedric usually do that\u2026.. treating the wounded himself?\u201d\u201cYes, I know he does.\u201dLysia replied.\u201cWhen there is a military doctor, of course, the military doctor comes first. When he was a boy\u2026 He made his first military deployment before he was sixteen. At that time, he couldn\u2019t fight himself, so he would do something like this\u2026.\u201dLysia did not finish her statement. Artizea could understand everything she didn\u2019t say.\u201cI see.\u201dThe reason why the emperor saved Cedric even after killing his parents was to not destroy Evron.Had all the descendants of the Grand Duke been lost, Evron would have just given up and became part of the empire. However, because there was still a young master, they band together.Cedric was carrying that weight on his back.[Is it worth the sacrifice of someone else to me?]Artizea knows best of the expression on Cedric\u2019s face. She then noticed his anger.She knew his face when he was stunned, and his face when he was pained.Now she knows his joyful and shy face, and she knows his face when she utters sweet friendly words.She also saw his face full of passion.Nevertheless, she couldn\u2019t imagine his face with tears, yet.Artizea looked down at her palm. The lashes that rubbed against her palm weren\u2019t wet.However, the feeling made her heart flutter strangely.She knew everything about Cedric\u2019s birth to his growth. Like memorizing the name of the nanny and characteristics of the teacher. She was also aware of the outcome of his first deployment and the first battle he took as the captain.However, no matter how much she memorized it in documents, she kept seeing things that she didn\u2019t know.\u201cAre you sad?\u201dAt Lysia\u2019s question, Artizea suddenly woke up from her thoughts.\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cBecause you never show such a face to us.\u201d\u201cAh \u2026..\u201dLysia smiled.\u201cI wanted to thank Your Grace for coming to this place. My father was always worried.\u201d\u201c\u2026..\u201d\u201cEver since he was a boy, the Grand Duke always said he was okay, he can still keep going and that it was nothing.\u201d\u201cLysia\u2026.\u201d\u201cAs a noble lord, as the only pillar of Evron, it was a decent attitude he was obligated to have, but it seems that it always hurts the hearts of the elders.\u201dShe said that she was young at the time, so she didn\u2019t know well, Lysia added lightly.\u201cI am so happy that Your Grace has accepted Evron as part of him again.\u201d\u201cNo\u2026.\u201dArtizea lowered her gazes down.Perhaps it was originally Lysia\u2019s role. She was rather stealing what she shouldn\u2019t see.But when she heard that from Lysia, she couldn\u2019t lift her head straight.***It took another full day to arrive, and the atmosphere of the stronghold was very gloomy.Before, there were many people who cheered and rejoiced that the carriage of the Grand Duchess was passing by.But now, no one came to greet. There was no one who took off their hat respectfully while doing their job before returning to work.Those on the road quickly avoided the carriage. The faces of those who greeted were also darkly depressed.Anxiety fell down like a fog. It may not be because of the Karam problem.\u2018It\u2019s also broken trust.\u2019Artizea lamented in her heart.She heard an explanation of the situation from Lysia.Aubrey\u2019s sin was not something that could be forgiven independently of its cause.Leaking out the structure and secret passages of the stronghold is a felony to the extent that even if it was committed by the family of the castellan, was a serious crime.Since she revealed the water supply passage, which would save the castle\u2019s life in an emergency, even if it was the castellan himself, it was a situation that could not be forgiven.Artizea thought she should not have come to Evron at all.She wasn\u2019t going to do that to Aubrey. At best, she tried to drive Aubrey out and prevent Aubrey from coming back again.But this is her own responsibility. Aubrey wouldn\u2019t have come this far if she hadn\u2019t come.Aaron and Margaret have been caring for this castle for over 20 years. Jordyn County was a family that was trusted by both the higher people and the lower people.No matter how sinful it is, such a family has been thrown out in one fell swoop.The castle, which has been impregnable since its construction, has been breached.The cause of this was a foreigner Grand Duchess who had only been married for less than half a year. Little by little, rumors spread that the kidnapper was her old lover.From the standpoint of the young people, it will be compelling to feel uneasy.Artizea sighed.It was a rift that was so difficult to make in her previous life, but she came here and soon she made it herself.She shouldn\u2019t have done that this time.\u201cYour Grace.\u201dLysia called her in a soft voice.Soon, her carriage stopped. Viscount Agate was welcoming her. The Viscount opened the carriage door and escorted her off, and he said.\u201cI\u2019m glad you came back safely, Your Grace.\u201d\u201cThank you. I heard that Lord Agate took care of the stronghold on behalf of the Grand Duke.\u201d\u201cYes. It was a temporary job until Your Grace\u2019s return, but it seems that I will have to take charge of the local affairs for the time being because of the situation underway.\u201d\u201cI must count on you. The Grand Duke went straight to Thold.\u201d\u201cI saw the beacon from this side as well. Now, in the stronghold, the knights are organized for patrols. We will report on any changes in the situation.\u201d\u201cIs the village okay? There were quite a few casualties on the way back\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay because it\u2019s winter. In the summer, there are a lot of people going out for work, but now most of them will be inside the barrier. One unit is around forty people, and we\u2019ll endure it until the reinforcements arrive.\u201dArtizea nodded her head. If this is Viscount Agate, that would be correct.But that doesn\u2019t mean she can\u2019t help with anything else.\u201cAll the Karam units we have seen so far have been destroyed. You must be tired, so don\u2019t worry and rest. The stronghold is safe.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dViscount Agate politely bowed and stepped back.Then Alice, Sophie, Rize and the maids poured in.\u201cMadam!\u201d\u201cDo you know how worried we were?\u201d\u201cAre there any injuries? Do you want to warm up your body first? Shall I prepare bath water?\u201d\u201cDo you want to have dinner? I have pumpkin soup, and I\u2019ll bring a little bit of it.\u201dArtizea was almost pushed into the bedroom.Even when she entered the room, the chatter did not die. Lysia raised her voice to calm the turmoil.\u201cEveryone stop it! Her Grace must be tired!\u201dThe maids were pinched.\u201cSophie, prepare a change of clothes, Rize, bring soup and chocolate, and everyone else prepare bath water. Your Grace, is it okay if I go to change clothes for a while?\u201dLysia cleared up the fuss at once. Artizea was truly thankful because she was about to get a headache.\u201cYou must have been tired from being out for a long time, too, so go and rest, Lysia.\u201d\u201cThank you, Your Grace. I\u2019ll be back soon.\u201dLysia bowed her head. And she went out of the room.Then only Alice was left in the room. After a while, Artizea knew that it was Lysia\u2019s consideration.Alice smiled lightly.\u201cI think Miss Lysia is a really nice person. She made your mind more comfortable\u2026. She knows that I have something for you and she was considerate, right?\u201d\u201cWould you like to come here for a minute?\u201dAlice tilted her head and approached Artizea.Artizea hugged her with open arms.\u201cWhat are you doing, Madam?\u201dAs Alice hesitated, she didn\u2019t know what to do.She was her close maid, but she had never had such direct and deep contact with Artizea.Artizea sighed.\u201cJust.\u201d\u201cJust?\u201d\u201cYes. Just\u2026.\u201dAlice smiled strangely.\u201cMadam, you\u2019ve been through a lot of trouble.\u201d\u201c\u2026..\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201dThe warm hands gently wrapped around Artizea\u2019s back. And she patted as if to comfort a child sweetly.\u201cIt\u2019s really okay now.\u201d\u201cAlice. \u201c\u201cBecause you are back safely. Nothing will happen.\u201dIt was actually Artizea, not Alice that had to say that.But she couldn\u2019t say so. Artizea just hugged Alice with all her might.Artizea first realized that she wanted to do this when she just returned and met Alice.She wanted to hug Cedric like this so much.But even now, Alice was the only one who could accept this embrace.***Lysia released a gun from her waist.The gun was originally Cedric\u2019s.It was made by one of the most skilled artisans in the capital.It was seemingly simple. There were little decorations except for the inscription of the Grand Duchy in gold on the grip.But in terms of performance, it was probably one of the best gun.Cedric gave her before dawn, when he left for Thold at dawn.[Did you learn how to shoot?][A little bit.][You can do everything well, so it won\u2019t be difficult to learn. Practice it.]Lysia was nervous. There is an unusual meaning to handing over the weapon that the monarch used to use.It is to give authority as well as trust. Even more if the crest of the family is engraved.It was too much to entrust the daughter of a baron, who was only 18 years old.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The reason Cedric gave her the gun wasn\u2019t something entirely unknown.However, isn\u2019t it too much authority to leave it to her only by the reason that she\u2019s Artizea\u2019s lady-in-waiting?[Wouldn\u2019t it be better to give it directly to Her Grace yourself?][If she shoots this thing and it doesn\u2019t come out of her grip, then it\u2019s a miracle.]Cedric laughed. But the laughter disappeared without staying long on his lips.[To protect her body, this might be useful, but I\u2019m not very worried about it though. If you think there may be a risk, you are a person who can prepare for it on your own. What I\u2019m concerned about is her heart, Lysia.\u201dLysia tilted her head.[She is a person with a weaker heart than others.][Yes.][I\u2019m not saying that she\u2019s weak. Tia seems to have a strong mental power, but she is actually fragile. Maybe it\u2019s because of her good brains, or she moves on without even thinking about it. She has a habit of assuming the worst situation and is easily shaken by the word efficiency.]Cedric sighed.[But it will be fine if you are by her side. You always know how to find the right path.][I just got to know Her Grace. If you ask me to sacrifice my life to protect her, I will obey it. However\u2026][Please be by her side. Can you do that?]Lysia received the gun.She wasn\u2019t sure if she could do it. She couldn\u2019t understand why he gave her such a great task.Maybe because she has been trusted, she acted with all her heart.Lysia changed her clothes and put the gun back inside her dress. And she went back to Artizea\u2019s room.***There was a funeral that night.It was a funeral for knights killed by Karam and guards killed by the South Sea people.Artizea also packed a mourning suit just in case, but she didn\u2019t think she would wear it this way.Artizea did not attend many funerals. She had fewer attendance as a superior.It wasn\u2019t that she had a small experience with death. However, her subordinates were usually people who had no name, no identity.There was no honor in dying with such loyalty. She couldn\u2019t even reveal who they really are and who is their real master.There were many cases where their real name could not be written on the tombstone.When attending funerals, Artizea never mourned or said how honorable the dead were.Instead, she gave their family pension. In general, that\u2019s what she pays for their loyalty.Sometimes she did things that seemed like revenge, but it never happened for her people. Lawrence was somewhat different from her, but he wasn\u2019t someone who gave too much meaning to the death of his subordinates.The funerals attended by Artizea was usually a funeral for someone who meant nothing to her.The death of an old nobleman, the death of a young heir\u2026.Behind the funeral, there were conversations filled with gloom yet anticipation about the title to change due to the death and the rights and obligations of property.It was part of politics. Often power relationships changed, and social trends changed. Sometimes the empire\u2019s economy overturned.But the funeral here was different.Sophie cried all throughout as she dressed Artizea in black. Alice also had red eyes.Neither of them knew the dead specifically, but everyone was sad.In the dark air that spread all over the stronghold, sadness was as heavy as anxiety.Compared to the grief, the funeral itself was simple.Dozens of coffins were laid in the grand hall. Lysia carefully asked Artizea.\u201cWould you like to see the body?\u201d\u201cShould I see it?\u201d\u201cIt is customary here for the Master to place a medal on the forehead of the honorable warrior. Now, the Grand Duke is not here, so the Grand Duchess should do it. If you are not confident, I will do it for you.\u201d\u201cNo. \u201cArtizea didn\u2019t live so delicately that she was afraid to see decaying bodies.However, neither Lysia nor Viscount Agate looked at her with anxious gazes.The lid of the coffin was down to about the shoulder.The bodies had already been cleansed and were wearing a robe. The faces had light make-up on, so it was no different from live faces except that it was pale without blood.Artizea wondered how much care the funeral director would have had to fit the broken body and decorate the face.However, they can still afford to go through a funeral like this.In a real battlefield, it is probably a luxury to be put straight into a coffin.Artizea placed the medals that Lysia handed over one by one on the body\u2019s forehead. The medal was the size of a coin, and the coat of arms of Evron Grand Duchy was engraved.The feel of the skin touching her hand was as cold as wax.All of these people were killed by Artizea.It wasn\u2019t that she drove someone to death, but that someone died to protect her.Alice was the only one who\u2019s ever been like that.The coffin lids are closed.\u201cGood job.\u201dViscount Agate whispered words of encouragement in her ear.He assumed that the young Grand Duchess would have been shaken by those deaths.It was believed that nobles who had grown up weakly in the capital would have never seen a dead body.This might be the first time for her to see a death; cut and torn by knife and weapons, not a disease or anything.Artizea shook her head without any answer.A flag was covered over each coffin. The coffins of the dead guards were covered with the flag of the Grand Duchy by Cedric himself.And this time, the coffins of the new bodies were covered by Viscount Agate and other knights.Artizea wondered how many of these flags and silver medals were prepared in the warehouse. She thought she\u2019d go bankrupt with just that.There were several other victims. The coffins of the servants and their families who were murdered by Cadriol were wrapped in white cloth.The coffins were carried out.Knights were lined up from side to side. Artizea stood in the position of the master and waited until the last coffin went out.It was too cold to dig a grave.All of the coffins will be enshrined, and in spring they will be buried in their respective tombs of their hometowns.No one cried violently. No one even fired a gun.So the funeral was consistently quiet from beginning to end.The ringing bell of the priests drifted away.The bereaved family and friends followed. Two maids near the entrance distributed flowers made of white cotton to the people.As the little sobbings all went outside, silence filled the grand hall.\u201cYour Grace.\u201dLysia carefully called Artizea. She couldn\u2019t see the face hidden behind the black veil well.Cedric said she was weak, but Lysia couldn\u2019t tell if she was mourning, or if she felt nothing.\u201cLet\u2019s go back. Your Grace should rest more.\u201d\u201cWhat about Aubrey?\u201dIt was then that Artisea asked.Lysia stopped. But she was forced to answer.\u201cAubrey is in the temple.\u201dGreat sinners are not allowed to enter the Grand Hall\u2019s funeral. This is because they are no longer a people of the Grand Duchy.The Jordyn family organized themselves and now it was temporarily enshrined in the temple like people who died of illness or other reasons.It will probably be transferred tomorrow without any delivery ceremony. It was fortunate that family members were allowed to attend.Artizea slowly turned around.\u201cWould you like to go?\u201dIt was Alice who first noticed where she was heading.\u201cIt\u2019s not Madam\u2019s fault.\u201dAlice said in a low voice.\u201cShe was punished by the Grand Duke. Miss Aubrey committed a sin that deserved death.\u201d\u201cI know. \u201cArtizea replied so.She did not intend to go in front of the coffin to apologize.She can\u2019t do anything to what has already passed. Cadriol\u2019s work was out of her predictable range.Artizea main job is to reduce the variables as much as possible and to move people within a predictable range.But just because she is Artizea, doesn\u2019t mean she knows everything in the world.The sacrifice that comes from unexpected things is unavoidable.Artizea wants the variable to have as small variation as possible, and does her best to do so.However, she\u2019s not sorry because people\u2019s lives are precious. This is because the smaller the variable, the higher the success rate of the plan.When the unexpected sacrifices were made, the stance that she should take was not to grieve.It was to analyze the blind spot and adjust the variables so that it doesn\u2019t fail next time.And she seldom felt guilty about it. Because she didn\u2019t do it for herself.She didn\u2019t feel guilty about getting Aubrey out. That\u2019s a natural thing to do for Lysia.In the first place, won\u2019t it be funny for a tool to sympathize with another tool?But today was different.Those who died today died for Artizea. For a two-year contract marriage, that is not worth it.And now she is responsible for all that. Now, because she was his wife, not secretly dealing with sin behind Cedric\u2019s back.So was Aubrey\u2019s death. She didn\u2019t have to die. Due to this, Evron Grand Duchy got divided. This was a variable that Artisea had not thought of.But she\u2019s ahead of all that.\u2018Only for today.\u2019Let\u2019s be emotional.It was probably because she had seen a funeral she had never seen before.Artizea had never seen such familiar and restrained feelings of mourning.No, no one will get used to that feeling. It is not emotions, but procedures, that the people here have become accustomed to.Cedric would not have been used to it, forever. Even when she had driven Evron to ruin.The temple was quiet. This is because the priests were away to lead the funeral.Artizea left Lysia and the maids at the entrance to the temple.Alphonse lifted the lamp.The temple of Evron stronghold was small compared to the number of people, the geographical and political importance of the stronghold. This is because there was not enough land in the castle.The chapel where Aubrey\u2019s coffin was placed was also small. Candles were lit only on the left and right of the chapel.The lid of the coffin had already been nailed. Instead of smooth white cotton, it was covered with rough, undyed fabric.In the middle, there was not a white flower, but a mistletoe with fruit that seemed to have come from somewhere.In front of her stood a knight in her 30s.\u201cDame Mel Jordyn.\u201dShe was the eldest daughter of the Jordyn family.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 86": "Chapter 86Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 86Proofreader: somnium\u201cAh, Your Grace.\u201dMel, who felt her presence, stepped back and knelt down in a hurry.Artizea had met Mel when she had just come here. It was when she was greeted by everyone on the trail.At that time, Mel looked majestic as a knight captain with one hundred knights under her control.After the Knighthood, she was supposed to serve in the fortress of Thold Gate. And, after gaining experience as a commander in another region, she would have succeeded Aaron in the future as Countess Jordyn, a vassal in the Grand Duchy.The black clad captain was no different from the other knights who attended the funeral today.The status of all of Count Jordyn household was forfeited. However, a trained knight is a skill that cannot be abandoned.Just because the punishment is applied, it is not possible to bring about an immediate power decline.For that reason, Mel had her epaulets covered with white cloth.She served as a knight, but lost her post and was demoted to a commoner.Even now, instead of kneeling on only one knee and saluting, Mel knelt down on both of her knees and bowed.It is in accordance with the tradition of the common people greeting the Grand Duchess.\u201cRise up.\u201dArtizea said in a split voice.Mel stood up with her head down. It was a quiet and calm attitude.\u201cIf I met someone, I thought I would see Margaret or Aaron\u2026.\u201d\u201cMy father went out on patrol. My mother is sick.\u201d\u201cAt the age of Sir Aaron, patrolling would be difficult.\u201d\u201cHe volunteered. He wanted to pay at least a little bit for teaching his child wrong\u2026..\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201dHaving said that, Artizea looked at the coffin silently for a moment.\u201cAubrey wouldn\u2019t be pleased about my visit, but I came because I thought it was right to send her.\u201dMel lowered her head.\u201cThank you. It wasn\u2019t an honorable death\u2026.. She was Your Grace\u2019s lady-in-waiting for a while, so if Your Grace would forgive her, that would wipe out Aubrey\u2019s disgrace a little.\u201dMel stepped aside.Artizea approached Aubrey\u2019s coffin and placed a white silk flower next to the mistletoe fruit.And she silenced for a moment. It wasn\u2019t pure condolences that caught her heart. Rather, it was a complex tangled dark emotion.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201dEventually Artizea said.She didn\u2019t intend to make it this far, and she won\u2019t make such an excuse.She has done countless things even worse than this, and she has never looked back on those deaths.She couldn\u2019t make excuses just because she was feeling sentimental.There\u2019s no reason for Aubrey\u2019s life to be heavier than someone else\u2019s.Mel said.\u201cAubrey is a disgrace to Count Jordyn.\u201d\u201cDame Mel.\u201d\u201cMy parents and I\u2026 raised her wrong.\u201dMel put her gaze down.\u201cIt may sound only as an excuse, but Aubrey is a child born prematurely on the day we heard that the Grand Duke was purged.\u201d\u201c\u2026..\u201d\u201cAt the time, Evron was having a hard time and both of my parents had suffered a lot\u2026 and felt a lot of guilt.\u201d\u201c\u2026..\u201d\u201cOn the day she was born, I knew they were worried about just covering her head with a blanket. At that time, everything was opaque. I heard they thought it would be a burden to have a newborn child in the Jordyn family if there was a war with the imperial family. So it would be nice to just die when she doesn\u2019t know anything.\u201d\u201cDame Mel.\u201d\u201cYou did a good thing by saying sorry. You don\u2019t behave like the wives of the capital do, they wear pretty clothes, do what they want to do\u2026\u2026 As if to make amends for what happened then.\u201dMel said she didn\u2019t make amends, but was trying to make amends.\u201cOne day, I realized Aubrey wasn\u2019t just immature, she was thinking of herself as the Grand Duke\u2019s Lady. I realized that it shouldn\u2019t be, but it was too late.\u201d\u201cRegardless of how their parents raise them, people live by their very nature.\u201dArtizea replied in a low voice. Mel replied.\u201cYes. Some people don\u2019t change no matter how they were taught. Still, I regret it.\u201d\u201cDame Mel\u2026.\u201d\u201cShe might have been a different child.\u201dMel shed tears.\u201cHis Grace the Grand Duke had his first battle on his sixteenth, and so did my father. So, if Aubrey was armed and posted on the fortress walls of Thold Gate, she might have understood why Evron was loyal\u2026. I\u2019m sorry.\u201dShe apologized to Artizea by bending her back. Her tears fell on the stone floor of the temple.Artizea sighed a long sigh.\u201cDame was a good older sister. You don\u2019t have to doubt that.\u201dIf she regretted it, she wouldn\u2019t put Aubrey up as the lady-in-waiting, but Aubrey\u2019s blood was buried in Mel\u2019s hand.Aubrey\u2019s words of envy pushed down her throat.Aubrey had everything she wanted.Artizea knew that if she had been in Aubrey\u2019s position, there would be nothing else she wanted to have or wanted to do in the world.She had loving parents and good older sisters, so just enjoying that happiness would have been enough for her life.Artizea sighed again.Aubrey\u2019s life is far more expensive than Artizea\u2019s if she considers the sadness of the remaining people to be worth her life.However, in reality, several people died to save Artizea, and Aubrey is buried in a wooden coffin that cannot even soothe her parents\u2019 sorrow.When she thought about it, everything was in vain. The world was unfair and evil.Leaving Mel in her place and coming out, there was someone waiting for her.\u201cDid you finish saying goodbye to the lady-in-waiting?\u201d\u201cPriest\u2026..?\u201dAlthough she had seen his face, she had never spoken with him in person.Artizea bowed her head and greeted the priest. The priest said in a low voice.\u201cI have something to tell you for a moment. Please come over here.\u201dThe priest beckoned her to follow him.\u201cSoon the other priests will be returning from the funeral. I want to say something before that, Your Grace.\u201dArtizea was somewhat surprised.There was no reason for the priest to find her in such a hurry. Even more so, if he\u2019s a regular priest.Of course, the ranks of priests were different from those of ordinary people. Even noblemen usually treated priests with sufficient courtesy.Even people who have no faith at all, their speech spontaneously increased in front of the priest.The same was true of Artizea.So, there is no law that says to not speak to her just because he is a regular priest.But Artizea was the Grand Duchess. Whenever they came to pray in a formal way, the bishop greeted them or at least a high-ranking priest greeted them.So, as they had no close acquaintance, she wasn\u2019t in the position to come and follow him.What\u2019s more, he has something to tell her when there are no other priests.The priest\u2019s body smelled like dirt and dust, as if he had come back in a hurry. His shoes also had mud on it.From the main entrance of the stronghold to the burial site, all roadwalks are paved with stone.The presence of mud means that he sneaked out through the back door. Or running down the side road.What was he trying to talk about?Artizea nodded lightly. And she followed the priest.Alphonse followed Artizea without a word.The place the priest guided her to was his residence.\u201cPlease wait here.\u201dArtizea said to Alphonse at the door.\u201cYour Grace can regard me as a dead man.\u201dHe had already assumed that his life was nothing. As Cedric said, he was only here because there is more use of him, and in reality there is no more competent escort.He remained determined to be with Artizea as a sword until the next moment he had to give his life.But Artizea shook her head.\u201cStay here. The priest is scared.\u201dThat was true.Even to Alphonse\u2019s eyes, the priest was trembling.\u201cI will be at the door.\u201dArtizea nodded her head.Then she went into the priest\u2019s room.The room was very small. There was only one bed that could barely be laid down, one furnace, and a small desk with a candlestick.The priest recommended that Artizea sit down by turning the desk chair.And he himself sat down on the bed. The room was so small that it was only possible to maintain a polite sense of distance.Looking at each other like this, she could see the priest sweating cold under the dim light.\u201cYour Grace, I\u2019m sorry to be asking for such rudeness. I have found some important facts, but there is no one else to discuss with but you. As I see it, you\u2019re the only one that is not from Evron\u2026.\u201dThe priest wiped his forehead with his sleeves.\u201cAs Your Grace may have already felt\u2026. In the North, the ties between the local people and the priests are so strong that they are worried about burying such a serious matter. So I had no choice, but to be a priest first.\u201d\u201cTell me what\u2019s going on first.\u201d\u201cYesterday I was confessed by a farmer.\u201dThe priest clenched his nervous hand.Disclosure of confession to others is prohibited in any case, but this was too serious.\u201cIt is said that the reason the war broke out this time was because they tried to cultivate the devil crop.\u201dOnce the priest had spoken, he poured out his words as if he had been relieved.\u201cIt looks like it\u2019s called the Karam crop among farmers.\u201d\u201cIs that such a big problem?\u201dArtizea asked, as if she did not understand anything.\u201cI knew that sometimes poor farmers sow seeds on the field and then pick fruit or dig up the roots when they are famished. This kind of behavior can be forgiven once or twice.\u201dThe priest said, shaking his hand.\u201cThe same goes for trading with Karam. It\u2019s what fools do to survive in a place out of the reach of God.\u201d\u201cPriest.\u201d\u201cBut this is a different problem. It is said that a village on the north side of the Thold Gate was systematically researching the devil crop. It seems that some of the vassals of the Grand Duchy were involved.\u201dArtizea looked at him, dimming her blue eyes.It seemed that there would be less than a day where she could be emotional.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 87": "Chapter 87Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 87Proofreader: somniumIt wasn\u2019t something unexpected.The village that was created to study the farming method of Karam crops consisted of about 20 households. There were no large families like ordinary villages. Still, the population exceeded 80.It is not 80 trained soldiers or informants, but 80 ordinary villagers.It is strange that the information does not leak out. It would most certainly be best to kill all of them to cover their mouths.Nevertheless, there are two reasons for Artizea to not suggest killings; believing in the words of Hannah and Cedric that they can control information.The first is that Cedric cannot accept the means of annihilation.It\u2019s something they can\u2019t even commit, anyway. Rather, as a result of that, if the confidence in oneself decreases and the liberty to speak is weakened, they will not be able to do what they should do at an important time in the future.Second, the traffic between the north and the mainland was inconvenient.The second reason wasn\u2019t too small: There is virtually no way for the peasants living at the northern end of the colony of the Evron Grand Duchy, to leak that information to the mainland.Evron Grand Duchy is a place with poor traffic. The spread of information was also very slow.Even if one talks to those around them, it is unlikely that it will reach the mainland across the wide Grand Duchy.Even if it arrives, it will be after the work in the West have already been completed by then.Perhaps there is an imperial spy inside the Grand Duchy.However, unless information gathered was targeting Karam crops and the northern town of Thold, the probability of finding out about this was low.\u2018A priest.\u2019Hannah showed confidence in controlling the people involved.However, there is something that no one in the world can stop. It was a religious spirit.Perhaps the one who confessed to the priest had not even realized that he had leaked secrets.This is because, in the thought of a pious person, confession is not about shedding secrets. Like no one thinks that confessing the sins to God, who they pray to before sleep, would be revealing secrets.Of course, the priest who received the confession took a different position.\u201cYour Grace, the Temple defines Karam as the devil. Karam belongs to the devil.\u201dThe priest said with a righteous face.\u201cIt is a felony that the Grand Duchy\u2019s vassals are trying to bring in the devils. Moreover, it is said that this is why the war broke out.\u201dForgetting that he was in front of the Grand Duchess, he swept his face with both palms.\u201cIt\u2019s divine punishment. It\u2019s natural that we attracted the devils because we coveted the things of the demons. Unlike other times, Karam suddenly appeared beyond Thold, it must be because of that.\u201d\u201cHave you spoken to the bishop?\u201dArtizea asked with a low, soft voice. It was to know the policy of the priests.The priest shook his head.\u201cI didn\u2019t tell him. The Bishop is a weak man. Besides, he is someone who takes the unity of this region more important than supporting the will of the temple.\u201d\u201cI see. \u201c\u201cOf course, there are cases where it is unavoidable in order to survive, and I know that there are some people who help Karam.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cBut I\u2019ve told him that we have to preach more intensely about the fact that it is forbidden. But the Bishop said that wrong good deeds are also good deeds. First of all, he is the one who always says that we have to live.\u201dThe priest once again stroked his face. But then there was a determination in his face.\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m speaking to Your Grace. I know it well because I\u2019m a person from here. The bishops, the other priests\u2026 maybe the majority will stay quiet to cover this for Evron.\u201d\u201cPriest.\u201d\u201cBut this has led to war. How can I bury it? There must be someone who caused the war.\u201d\u201cHow does the priest want me to help you? I am ignorant of the situation here, and I don\u2019t know much about Karam.\u201d\u201cPlease tell the mainland Abbey about this, Your Grace.\u201dThe priest bowed his head deeply.\u201cThe Abbey is too far from here, and I think, even if I write a letter to the Abbey, someone in the middle is likely to intercept it.\u201d\u201cPriest.\u201d\u201cIf the Abbey demands, the Bishop will not forgive the devil and the fool who communicates with Karam for their own good. We have to find them out as soon as possible. We must not have the Evron Grand Duchy abandoned by God because of its vassals, do we?\u201dArtizea still looked at the priest.There seemed to be no malice. He is sincerely concerned about Evron Grand Duchy.If this was known to the mainland, it would have been unthinkable, the crime of communicating with Karam and excommunication of Evron Grand Duchy.\u2018I\u2019m glad you discussed it with me.\u2019Artizea thought.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to say anything right now.\u201dShe replied calmly.\u201cBecause it is not yet clear that the cause of the war really is because of that. And\u2026 the confessor may have said something wrong to the priest with a bad meaning?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to doubt the confessor\u2019s identity.\u201d\u201cOkay, but if some of the Grand Duchy\u2019s vassals did something secretly, I couldn\u2019t interfere with it too quickly. It doesn\u2019t seem like a normal problem.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cSo, first of all, I\u2019ll find out a little. Please keep this a secret until then.\u201d\u201cYes, Your Grace\u2019s careful words are correct.\u201dThe priest nodded.Artizea stood up and greeted him lightly.\u201cI\u2019ll see you again soon. It\u2019s okay if you don\u2019t see me off.\u201dThe priest stood up after her. Artizea left him in the room and went out alone.Thud.After closing the door, a sigh leaked out.\u201cHooo.\u201dAlphonse raised the lamp without saying anything.Artizea quickly stepped out of the temple.Priests are pretty troublesome.The temple had a considerable level of centralized system. It is impossible for farmers at the northern end to pass information to the mainland, but it is very easy for a priest to contact other temples.For this time, the letter can be intercepted. But someday it will reach the temple.If Artizea responds in vain, this priest will no doubt come up with a different way of sending the news.And the priest\u2019s words will be taken more seriously than the farmer\u2019s words. It\u2019s a shocking story for people from the mainland to interact with Karam.It is possible that not only the Karam crop is a problem, but all the communication that took place in Grand Duchy Evron will be treated as crime.If it were not the priest who was talking about this now, but some other person, Artizea would have simply killed them and bound their mouth. Because the dead cannot speak.But she can\u2019t do that against a priest.All priests have their names on the Abbey\u2019s list. If they die, they must tell the reason for their death.And if a priest suddenly dies for an unacceptable reason, the Abbey will surely try to investigate the reason.\u2018If I had known one day earlier.\u2019Artizea felt pity.If that was the case, she would have killed the priest with the weapon of the South Sea people, which was held by the dead Cadriol\u2019s men. If we said that it was the casualty that occurred during the raid, would it have been possible to deal with it?However, the funeral has already been held, and the body could not appear immediately after this.It was fortunate that the priest had confessed. The priest appears to be a devout principled man who is faithful to the temple.So he wouldn\u2019t easily let the confession out.Anyway, the first thing to do is finding out the reason for the war.Artizea came out with a scary face.Lysia and the maids waiting outside the temple looked at her with anxious faces.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Your Grace? What happened inside?\u201d\u201cWhen the funeral is over, tell Viscount Agate and Hannah to come to my place. It doesn\u2019t matter how late it is.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dLysia replied with a tightly tense face.Artizea quickly returned to the stronghold.The two people gathered in Artizea\u2019s parlor, well past midnight, and it was about 3 o\u2019clock in the morning.Artizea sat in front of the fireplace without taking off her mourning clothes. Her mind was complicated trying to organize her thoughts.After everyone was seated, Artizea first asked Viscount Agate.\u201cWhat\u2019s the situation at the Thold Gate?\u201d\u201cAs far as the last messenger announced, there is no conflict yet. However, the number of warrior-class Karam gathered in front of the fortress is estimated to be over 20,000 and under 25,000.\u201d\u201cGenerally, when a war breaks out, I know that a lot more would gather than that, but it\u2019s not even less than 20,000.\u201dLysia added more explanation. Artizea looked at Hannah this time.\u201cI heard something today.\u201d\u201cYes? \u201c\u201cThey said that the war broke out because of the village north of Thold.\u201dArtizea said so in a cold voice.Hannah\u2019s face turned pale.She looked at Viscount Agate. Viscount Agate hesitated and looked at Lysia.\u201cDid the Grand Duke tell you to hide it from me? Or are you randomly hiding it?\u201dArtizea asked in a cold voice.Lysia replied instead.\u201cI don\u2019t know what this is about, but I know for certain that the Grand Duke has said to take good care of the stronghold.\u201dThen Viscount Agate lowered his head.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Your Grace.\u201dHannah jumped up and knelt down.\u201cYes, it\u2019s my fault. In the process of dismantling the village, I accidentally kidnapped a child of Karam.\u201d\u201cA child?\u201d\u201cThere was a new Karam village not far away. It is said that children from both sides often played with each other. On that day, in the process of dismantling the village and moving residents, some of the children came into the Thold Gate together. The military officer who made the mistake said that he was wearing a hood covering his upper eye, so he thought he was mixed race and brought him in.\u201dArtizea exhaled greatly.It was a sigh of relief.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 88": "Chapter 88Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 88Proofreader: somniumWhen the beacon rose from the fortress of the Thold Gate, it was the emergence of the variables that worried Artizea the most.As Artizea remembers, there was no war with Karam this year.So, is this a crazy butterfly effect of her actions?If that\u2019s not the case, was it because there was another person who had the memory before the regression, other than Cadriol?Artizea did not see the probability of the former as high.The likelihood that a person outside of Evron who is related to Karam is near zero.The Western monster wave was thought to be a natural disaster. Karam is no different, because it was considered a kind of monster in all areas except Evron.As Artizea knows, she was still the broadest person ever to come up with new ideas among those involved in imperial politics.Besides, she had been devoted to giving Evron pain.She didn\u2019t even think that Karam could be the target of negotiations or politics until she came here and talked to Cedric.So it is unlikely what she did at the mainland had any impact on the Karam.In other words, it meant that a completely unknown variable occurred in Evron.Variables beyond her control are dangerous.However, if the cause of the war was the village north of Thold, it meant that Artizea herself had an influence on this conflict.It is not a variable.The war itself was, of course, a problem.However, it was better than the appearance of an unknown variable.Artizea took a deep breath and looked at them.\u201cDoes the Grand Duke know?\u201d\u201cYes, the village guard went to the fortress at Thold Gate with the report.\u201d\u201cI see. What about the child?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve already sent it back.\u201d\u201cBut since it happened once, it is said that the extremist in Karam got room to gain advantage over the moderate one.\u201dArtizea was lost in thought\u201cHow did the villagers handle it? Hannah, I remember you being firmly confident that you could keep it confidential.\u201dHannah lowered her head with a pale face.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. \u201c\u201cI don\u2019t want to hear an apology.\u201d\u201cWe will look for the suspect that leaked the information as soon as possible.\u201dHannah bowed her head.\u201cWhat are you going to do about it?\u201d\u201cPunish the perpetrator severely and warn the other not to let this happen again\u2026..\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure you know what will happen if this is known to the mainland. I have already told you why I am dismantling the village and trying to put the crop on the altar of the Great Abbey.\u201d\u201cYes. \u201c\u201cA warning doesn\u2019t mean anything unless you kill everyone to cover their mouth.\u201dArtizea said coldly.\u201cYour Grace\u2026!\u201dLysia was startled and called her. Artizea shuddered.To be sure, there is nothing more than that. Half-hearted punishment and warning increase the likelihood of information leakage.It wasn\u2019t clear whether it would make any sense to investigate it now.Artizea touched her forehead. Viscount Agate said like an excuse.\u201cIn the first place, we were going to relocate to a suitable area and cut off contact with the outside for a while. At the time of the conflict, I went to the stronghold first to deal with the urgent matter, but after that, since Karam troops appeared here and there, we have not yet cleaned it up.\u201d\u201cFirst of all, we\u2019ll have to deal with the residents.\u201dArtizea turned to Lysia and asked.\u201cWill there be any room in the village of the rebels?\u201d\u201cOur village?\u201d\u201cBecause the village of rebels is the most secret place in Evron. It would be nice if you could accept about 8 households.\u201dFirst of all, the rest of the mixed family or their relatives are all right. This is because they had already pretended to be a common civilian.The words of relatives who have mixed Karam blood will not be accepted publicly at all.So, hide the rest in the village of rebels.The village of the rebels is a place where everyone hides together. The people there were most loyal to the Evron Grand Duchy. They will also have a sense of revenge for the imperial family.They will monitor the villagers north of Thold to keep information from leaking.\u201cYou will have to get some support from the stronghold.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not impossible.\u201d\u201cI think it would be okay if it was a temporary residence. We have to discuss whether it will be acceptable in the long term.\u201dArtizea looked at Viscount Agate and Hannah. Hannah nodded her head vigorously.\u201cWe can meet this winter, and we can solve the problem after it. In spring, we will relocate the entire village to a secret place as originally planned.\u201d\u201cIs it okay to believe that?\u201d\u201cThey won\u2019t be so uncooperative. All of them have lived as neighbors with mixed Karam for several years. They have enough loyalty, I swear.\u201dHannah said.Artizea sighed a little.Loyalty and faith are compatible. Even the one who confessed to the priest this time would not be because they have a lack of loyalty.Anyway, it\u2019s good.Now that information leakage has already occurred once, it is safe to think that it is already known somewhere.As Hannah said, it\u2019s good if there is no information leaking again, or else it can\u2019t be kept secret, anymore.She had no choice but to have the Karam crop on the altar in the Abbey as soon as possible.The Western Grain Merchant Union must also be made quickly. Wherever the word karam crop comes from, it can be regarded as a battle between grain vendors.Artizea said.\u201cI have to go to the capital.\u201d\u201cYes? \u201cViscount Agate, Hannah, Lysia, all three looked at Artizea in amazement.Artizea said again.\u201cThe sea is blocked, but the land is clear, right?\u201d\u201cBy land\u2026 you mean?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not an easy road, Your Grace. Snow has piled up\u2026. If you take a break in the carriage, it would take a lot longer than two months.\u201d\u201cIn addition, Karam is crossing the Thold Mountains. As you can see, the patrols are subduing them, but it cannot be said that it is not dangerous.\u201dSaid Viscount Agate.Hannah had other worries, too.\u201cThere is a dispute at the Thold Gate, and if the Grand Duchess is away, the morale of the people may be lowered.\u201dArtizea was also concerned about that.To be a good Grand Duchess, it would be right to remain in the stronghold.Artizea also knew that the master and his family could give pride and trust to the young people by protecting the stronghold.But that\u2019s too low of the profits when she thinks about what she can do to go to the capital.She doesn\u2019t know much about the protocol. Rather, unnecessary efforts and resources are put into protecting her.There will be someone who sees the Grand Duchess returning to the capital, not long after she has been married, as running away.However, such personal disgrace is fine.Among the few issues here, there is Karam who has crossed the Thold Mountains. Disputes are arising at the gate. A war will break out by any chance.She was not afraid of war. There were also concerns that Cedric would get hurt.However, such worries mean nothing, no matter how sleepless she may be.On the other hand, there are so many things that she can do in the capital at this moment.No one can touch the Grand Duchess of Evron at this time.If the Grand Duchess of Evron was accidentally \u2018touched\u2019 or betrayed and the Grand Duchy falls back, the next front line becomes the Elia Wall.It means that it will be a war coming to the imperial family and the central nobility.Instead, they will get enough military supplies and compensation. Wouldn\u2019t it be necessary to get as much as they sacrificed?She doesn\u2019t know what the naive ancestral Grand Duchess was like. But Artizea knew well enough to know what could happen if Evron was touched at this point.At least in their opinion, their lives are much more expensive than those of Evron.Shouldn\u2019t the gap be filled with gold?The same was true of the Great Abbey; while Evron is at war with Karam, they cannot excommunicate the Grand Duchess.So now was the best time to harvest and manipulate the seeds she sown.Everything she has to do is in the capital.In the meantime, she thought that she had to bring all the western troops that Cedric had given up.\u201cMake a plan so we can get there in two months, Lysia. Before the end of winter.\u201d\u201cYour Grace\u2026.\u201d\u201cGo down to the south and do the work together. If you don\u2019t have enough troops, you\u2019ll have to organize a minimum of escorts and hurry.\u201d\u201cNo need, it is possible.\u201dViscount Agate replied.\u201cBut before that, I would like to speak to His Grace the Grand Duke.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dArtizea said.\u201cI will write him a letter.\u201d\u201cYes. \u201cViscount Agate replied without concealing his embarrassment.\u201cIt\u2019s late at night, so go and take a rest.\u201d\u201cYes, Your Grace.\u201dArtizea first stood up.A rough outline of what she had to do in the future has already been made in her head. Now, she only has the priest to deal with it.***It was three days later that Artizea\u2019s letter was delivered to Cedric at the fortress at Thold Gate.\u201cDid you bring the letter yourself?\u201dCedric frowned lightly at Lysia, who handed the letter.\u201cYes. It\u2019s not a long distance from the stronghold. Her Grace said this is an important letter, so she wished I could deliver it myself.\u201dThere was also a slight suspicion that she was trying to pass Cedric to Lysia.\u201cShe asked me to see the war with my own eyes and tell her. She thought that the Grand Duke might downplay it when telling her\u2026.\u201dHaving said that, Lysia looked over the wall.20,000 Karam warriors.It\u2019s not a small number, but it wasn\u2019t enough to break through the fortress at Thold Gate.In general, it is said that attacking a fortress requires 3 to 5 times the troops of the defending side.The number of troops regularly deployed at Thold Gate was 10,000. When calculated arithmetically, there should be more than 30,000 Karam warriors to be able to fight against them.But it is a story between people. In fact, Evron has 10,000 troops to prevent 100,000 Karam.Karam\u2019s civilization lagged far behind that of the Empire.Karam\u2019s life span is about 40 years, even at the maximum. History cannot be accumulated because there are no letters and the environment is not capable of developing agriculture.Karam\u2019s tactics are childish, and their weapons are poorly developed. Compared to humans who already use guns, Karam is now barely starting to properly handle spears.That was the reason why Karam couldn\u2019t surpass Thold despite its excellent physical ability and survivability like a beast, fertility that is more prolific than humans, and the rapid growth of reaching adulthood in five years.However.\u201cA battering ram, is it?\u201dLysia stared blankly at the other side. They had a siege weapon.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 89": "Chapter 89Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 89Proofreader: somniumThere were also two catapults, not just battering ram.Lysia looked at them with binoculars. All three were just a rudimentary machine.The wooden wheels were loose. Instead of capping the tip of the log with iron, a part which would hit the wall, it barely had an iron belt around it.The catapults were also poorly held together. The rebound will break itself.However, the design itself was refined enough.Above all, the fact that it appeared was important.Until now, Karam wasn\u2019t very dependent on weapons. They have the physical ability to climb the walls barehand. So, there was hardly ever a siege ladder to be placed on the wall.However, this is the first time that aspect has changed.\u201cSiege weapon after guerrilla warfare\u2026..\u201dLysia sighed.\u201cThey\u2019re perfectly prepared for the war. I don\u2019t think the problem is the kidnapped Karam or anything like that.\u201d\u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t look like they\u2019re ready for war. If they did, they wouldn\u2019t have collected 20,000 at most.\u201dCedric\u2019s face remained relaxed.\u201cRather, I am curious about how they came up with such an idea.\u201d\u201cThey have been fighting at the Thold Gate for over a hundred years. Maybe they just realized that it\u2019s difficult with a naked body?\u201d\u201cRather than that, it\u2019s more likely that they learned from someone. If the first idea was to \u200b\u200bsmash gates by hitting them with a log, they would have brought a log first. But they made a battering ram and also have catapults. I don\u2019t think Karam will be able to make something like that so suddenly.\u201d\u201cYou mean someone taught them?\u201dAlthough there are trade routes, it is only at the level of communicating with gestures.It was impossible to explain the concept and share the design of catapult or battering ram, and to go to war with it.Cedric was silent.It\u2019s not that he had nothing to say, but decided to save his words.The same goes for both siege weapons and small troops crossing the mountain range and disturbing the borders.It was beyond the limits of accumulated Karam history.Life or wisdom.However, some of the Karams have crossed it.\u201cAnyway, 20,000 warriors are not enough to stage a siege properly. Karam probably knows.\u201dThe fortress commander intervened.Cedric nodded his head.And he opened Artizea\u2019s letter. The letter concisely explained what had happened in the stronghold.Of course, she omitted the story she heard from the priest. The information on the northern village of Thold was leaked, and the information on the follow-up was written first.And as a result, there was a need to quickly create a grain merchant union, and the main point was that there were works to be done in the capital.Cedric was first suspicious when he was told that Lysia had brought the letter. He was wondering if it had something to do with Lysia leaving her place.But when he looked at the content, it wasn\u2019t.To accommodate residents of the village north of Thold, who may have leaked information, with the village of the rebels, was a reason that Cedric could accept.In fact, if she wasn\u2019t going to kill everyone, there was no better way.It seemed that Artizea had not yet decided for sure whom she could trust in Evron Grand Duchy.It would have been. It wasn\u2019t long since Aubrey\u2019s incident happened.Loyalty and trustworthiness are different matters. Cedric knew it now.Cedric folded the letter back and put it in his pocket. Later, the letter will have to be burned. There was some information that should not be put into the hands of others.He smiled bitterly. From the time they met in the capital to this day, they still exchanged a few letters, but none was left in his hand. Because all had to be burned.There was never a word written that was affectionate enough to be kept.\u201cI\u2019m taking a rest at the fort today, Lysia. I have to write a reply.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dLysia nodded her head.\u201cBut won\u2019t you stop her from going to the capital?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m worried about her traveling in winter, but I\u2019m sure Tia knows it already. Nevertheless, the purpose must be important enough to have to go.\u201dCedric said so.It is also important to make a grain merchant union and to put Karam crops on the altar of the Temple.Apart from that, Cedric was able to raise several advantages for the Grand Duchess during a dispute at the Thold Gate.So he could have guessed why she was going back to the capital.If so, all he has to do is support her.Dong! Dong! Dong! Dong!The Karam began to beat the drum.Ka! Kak! Ka! Kaaram!The shouts of the Karam warriors united and shook the sky.Said Cedric looking down at it.\u201cI\u2019ll have to drag the confrontation a little longer.\u201d\u201cYour Grace?\u201dCedric\u2019s command flustered both Lysia and the fortress commander.\u201cIt\u2019s less than 20,000. That means that they didn\u2019t really come together to fight a war. Maybe some of the forces have come to test whether the catapults and battering ram they made were actually useful or not.\u201dThe fortress commander\u2019s face was slightly hardened.Cedric was speculating that way from the start.He was first reported as to what caused this dispute,However, it is a superficial excuse to tilt the scale further toward the extremist due to the kidnapping.Upon learning of the facts, Evron immediately sent the child back and provided a significant amount of compensation.Nevertheless, this happened.\u201cNow, we can destroy all siege weapons with one or two bombardments. It\u2019s better not to let Karam know the utility of it at all, Your Grace.\u201d\u201cKaram already knows the utility of the weapon and the meaning of tactics. If you break it down at once, you can create infight in Karam. But the end result will be the same.\u201d\u201cThe end result?\u201d\u201cThe second and third attempts will be made. Eventually, Karam will learn as well. That in order to destroy the walls, you can\u2019t do it with physical strength alone. Before that, we must be different.\u201dYou must have the power to pour out enough resources to stop it completely or gain the power to attempt for peace.Cedric reached out his hand.\u201cBring my great bow.\u201dThe fortress commander turned his head in amazement.One of the lieutenants ran. Cedric\u2019s bow was hung in the third command post adjacent to the wall. These days with guns, it was more of a decoration.Cedric adjusted the string of the bow that was not used for a long time.He chose not to shoot a gun, but to shoot an arrow, because it could have a much more direct emotional impact on Karam.Guns are unknown to Karam. Fear may be instilled on them, but cannot serve as a reminder that a true warrior is here.Dong! Dong! Dong! Dong!The drumming rang without stopping.The battering ram started to move. The fortress commander said with an anxious face.\u201cAre you really going to just leave them alone?\u201d\u201cThey can\u2019t threaten the gate.\u201dCedric hung an arrow on the bow. As the string was pulled, his whole body muscles were tense.\u201cAfter I shoot the second arrow, fire afterwards.\u201d\u201cWhat about the catapult?\u201d\u201cLeave one. Let\u2019s see if it\u2019s functioning properly. All shields are in place, right?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dIt was Karam who moved first.\u201cKak! Kaak!\u201dKaram\u2019s warrior, who took the lead, yelled.\u201cIt\u2019s coming!\u201dSomeone shouted.A group of Karam pushed the battering ram and ran.Cedric let the arrow go. The arrow that flew away with a whispering sound was stuck in the center of Karam\u2019s big drum.Tong!The drum tore apart the shouting sounds.The second arrow broke the flagpole standing next to the drumming Karams.The Karam was startled and paused for a moment. Shooting the drum accurately with a bow across that distance and breaking the flagpole was usually not something a warrior could do.The bombardment continued without missing the beat.Boom!The first bombardment broke the battering ram in one hit. Some of the Karam who was pushing the battering ram got caught in the blast and became bloody.Boom!The second bombardment threatened the catapult.Cedric saw a young Karam standing near the flagpole.The reason he noticed him anew was because he was looking exactly at Cedric.Cedric could not clearly distinguish Karam\u2019s face. This is because he had been away from the Grand Duchy for a long time.However, the Karam did not seem to be having the same problem.A meaningful gaze swept Cedric\u2019s face.Usually, Karam will not be able to clearly distinguish human faces.They can tell who is the head of the human beings by clothes, bows, and mood. However, this Karam\u2019s gaze was not simply a face looking at the head of the hostile forces.\u2018You know me.\u2019Cedric caught the gaze. The inside of his chest was flickering.It had crossed the limit.Would it be better to kill it here?Or should he keep it alive?Is it the status quo or change to a different future?He wanted to know what Artizea would say.Karam warriors roared. The situation that almost became a battle entered into a confrontational situation once again.***At that time, Artizea headed to the temple with only Alphonse.She wore a hooded fur cloak over her coat. In her hand, wearing thin lace gloves, she held a small handbag with jewels.She walked without a carriage, but no one asked why. Because she came out without anyone knowing.If possible, she wanted to come alone without Alphonse. However, unlike in the capital, she could not separate him.She didn\u2019t have Freil to take the place of the escort, and Alphonse didn\u2019t want to be separated either. Alphonse insisted that if she doesn\u2019t take him, she should take at least two other knights with her.Alphonse was better than two knights. Besides, he followed her to the temple last time. He has already seen the priest\u2019s face.When the Grand Duchess came to the temple without any notification, the apprentice priest at the entrance greeted with great surprise and bowed his head. Artizea spoke quietly.\u201cI\u2019ll just pray for a while, so don\u2019t let them know.\u201d\u201cOh, yes.\u201dThe apprentice priest bowed his head.Probably not really a secret visit. It is not something to hide; that the Grand Duchess came to the temple and quietly prayed and left.It didn\u2019t matter that much.Artizea walked across the temple without taking off her hood.It wasn\u2019t the chapel or prayer room that she was heading for. It was the room of the faithful priest who told her about the Karam crop.Cedric was wrong. Artizea had entrusted the letter to Lysia in order to be separated from her.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It wasn\u2019t difficult to find out that the priest would be in the room at this time, even after just a day or two of observation.Furthermore, he was contemplating a complex problem. It was fully predictable that the time he spent staying alone in the room would be longer.\u201cYour Grace.\u201dThe priest opened the door, and he bowed his head in surprise to see Artizea.Artizea glanced at him to enter. The priest hurriedly went back inside.Artizea left Alphonse outside and closed the door.\u201cSit.\u201d\u201cOh, yes.\u201dLike last time, the priest sat on the bed.Artizea pulled the chair herself and sat down.\u201cI\u2019ve noticed a little of what the priest has said.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right. There was a village on the north side of the Thold Gate, where mostly families of mixed Karam lived.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s terrible.\u201dHearing the name of mixed Karam blood, the priest made a cross. Just thinking about it seemed to make him shiver.\u201cThe Grand Duke is too weak in heart. It is much more benevolent of the father or mother to dispose of the seeds of sin quickly.\u201dArtizea hid the bitter smile. And she said with a serious face.\u201cJust being thrown out of the temple will be punishment enough for them.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not a punishment. How dare the devil put his foot on the temple?\u201d\u201cPriest.\u201dArtizea sighed a little.\u201cThe Karam mixed race created a village north of Thold. Well, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s important. Even if someone else has helped them, how can a person easily ignore a family member or relative?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026. I understand Your Grace\u2019s heart. But\u2026.\u201d\u201cPlease pardon the individuals, but I think I can\u2019t forgive a vassal who did this without even the Grand Duke\u2019s knowledge.\u201dArtizea said in a soft voice. The priest nodded his head.\u201cThe Grand Duke will also know about this. It is the cause of the war, so he can\u2019t go into it without knowing the fact. I will find the person who caused it and punish them.\u201d\u201cAh! That\u2019s right! Good thing.\u201d\u201cBut, things aren\u2019t good right now. Some time ago, there was an incident with the Jordyn family, and now there is a threat from Karam at the Thold gate, so you will have to be cautious.\u201d\u201cI know what you mean.\u201d\u201cDid you write a letter to the Temple in advance?\u201dAsked Artizea. The priest nodded.\u201cThen, give it to me now. I\u2019m going to the capital soon, but I won\u2019t deliver that letter right away.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026 what do you mean?\u201d\u201cIf Priest becomes aware of new news or has an important cause that needs the letter to be delivered to the Temple immediately, please contact me again.\u201dThat\u2019s what Artizea said.\u201cThen, I\u2019ll make sure to deliver Priest\u2019s letter to the Temple right away.\u201d\u201cBut what if the news is intercepted or someone manipulates it?\u201dThe priest said with a face full of concern.Artizea smiled little.In her opinion, only Freil and Ansgar were the only ones who had the right heads in Evron Grand Duchy. Ansgar wouldn\u2019t be involved in this matter.However, the key point was that the priest thought so.Artizea opened her handbag and pulled out a silver seal from within.\u201cI\u2019ll give you this.\u201d\u201cIs this Your Grace\u2019s seal?\u201d\u201cI used it before I got married.\u201dWhen Artizea said so, she showed the shape of the seal.It was a seal engraved with a vine rose pattern that would be used by premarital young ladies who did not have any rights to the family.\u201cIf you press here like this, the pattern changes.\u201dAfter Artizea pressed one of the ornaments on the seal, she showed it back to the priest.Part of the bottom engravings of the seal have risen. As the petals of the vine rose were turned into reliefs, they were almost the same, but changed the seal into a different feel. The border has also changed.\u201cThis is what I used when I got a private letter from a friend that I didn\u2019t want to show my mother, Priest.\u201dShe said it was her friend, but the priest soon understood what she meant.What kind of person Miraila was, even a priest in this distant land heard rumors. She was a person who would tear open and inspect her daughter\u2019s letter.\u201cI got it back because I don\u2019t need it anymore, but my maid knows this changed seal.\u201d\u201cI understand what you mean. If I have anything serious to contact, I will stamp this seal and send it to Your Grace\u2019s maid.\u201d\u201cYes. Then it will be delivered to me intact.\u201dIt was a complete lie.Artizea never had a separate seal or anything else before the marriage.She only informed Alice of the pattern of the seal this time. It was in order to accept the letter if there was any real contact from the priest.Of course, it was very unlikely. It\u2019s because she doesn\u2019t really give it to be used for sealing.This seal was equipped with an elaborate device.When she shows it to the priest, she has pressed the other decorations first so that the pattern changes safely.Instead, if anyone just pressed one of the decorations that Artizea had taught, the stinger was supposed to pop out. It was thin and short like iron hair, and it was like a thorn that was difficult to find even if it was stuck in the hand.If he is lucky, he will survive. If he believes that Cedric will deal with this properly and forget about today, the priest can live.If he puts the seal deep in the drawer and never takes it out, nothing will happen.However\u2026\u2018Maybe, you\u2019ll not survive.\u2019Artizea thought so.The priest will surely try to contact her. It was a matter of faith.It is difficult to believe even if he swears to keep a secret, but he was the one who had contacted Artizea because he zealously thought that he had to inform her of this fact even in difficult circumstances.He will surely try to inform the Temple about the Karam crop. He will eventually die. What\u2019s the point of leaving a ray of possibility of survival?\u2018Because it\u2019ll become an alibi.\u2019Artizea thought of an excuse.At the moment the priest dies, she herself will be in the capital. No one can connect her with that death.Actually, it didn\u2019t mean much.This poison barely leaves any trace. If they performed an autopsy, it will just determine the cause, which is poisoning.However, there is no one who will do so just because a single priest died suddenly here.So anyway, this was all Artizea could do for her own emotional comfort.It was like relieving guilt and pushing responsibility to the victim, saying that it wasn\u2019t her responsibility they died, but their fault.\u201cThank you very much for your consideration. I\u2019ve been thinking for a long time whether or not I should talk to you, but I think I did the right thing.\u201dThe priest said with a somewhat relaxed face.\u201cBelieve in His Grace and wait. I hope that the priest will keep the faith in people as much as the faith in God.\u201dArtizea said so.Then she put a pretty thick letter from the priest in her bag and came out again.\u201cGo in, Priest.\u201d\u201cThank you, Your Grace.\u201dThe priest bent down to his waist and bowed deeply.Artizea turned around.She suddenly remembered what Cedric said.[When we go together, we will be able to find the right way.]When he said that, what would be the right path he was drawing in his mind?She guessed it vaguely.Moreover, Artizea knew that he didn\u2019t seem to be able to go to the capital with her.\u2018I have to go back to the capital.\u2019She thought blankly.Anything like a person\u2019s life can be used as a chess piece, a pocket of gold coins or a place where a plot is made can be used to take one step closer to the throne.That is where she will be.In the capital, she doesn\u2019t have to feel this hesitation anymore. In a one-eyed world, only the one-eyed is normal. Her ugliness will also blend in among the countless despicable ones.Rather, she hoped so.***The first thing Artizea did when she returned was to take the priest\u2019s letter out of her handbag and read it.There was little to keep in mind.There was a story about the fact that some of the Evron Grand Duchy\u2019s vassals had attempted to grow Karam crops using the residents and the fact that a Karam mixed blood was living there.The priest added his usual thoughts to the end.[There are many people here who are pure and sincere, but far from the Word of God. The vassals of the Grand Duchy are also loyal and courageous, but they don\u2019t seem to know what\u2019s important.The Grand Duke has been away many times, so there are many places where his eyes cannot reach.Not a few of the people here sympathize with the devil\u2019s seed. Sometimes it is mixed with ugly and dirty blood, and excommunication alone is not a sufficient punishment.There are not enough temples in Evron Grand Duchy. That is why people are wandering even more without knowing the right path.In order to take this situation into account at the Great Temple, please send several priests to discipline the people and teach the doctrine to knights and officials\u2026]Artizea read through and threw the letter into the fireplace. The letter burned in the fire in a flash.She picked up the fire poker and meticulously scattered the ashes. It was a habit.Perhaps there is no one in the stronghold who could pick up the remaining pieces of paper from the fireplace and match the letter. If there was such a person, she wanted to recruit them.Knock, knock.There was a knock at the door.\u201cCome in.\u201dArtizea replied plainly. She had called Alice, so naturally she thought Alice had come.However, the door did not open right away. Artizea wondered and stood up.When the maids knock, they will say \u2018it\u2019s Alice\u2019, but she can\u2019t hear them say anything.Is it someone else?\u201cAh. \u201cThe door opened before she opened it.Artizea was startled and almost jumped. Cedric was smiling with an awkward expression across the door.As if he had just come from the outside, his cheeks, struck by the cold wind, turned apple-colored.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Artizea stepped back in confusion.She didn\u2019t think he couldn\u2019t come in or that she would hate it, but she was so surprised that she just wondered what this was about.It was four days ago that Lysia left.She was told that it took three days on horseback to go to the fortress at the Thold Gate. So she thought it would take at least three or four more days for Lysia to return.And there\u2019s no way Cedric can return at this point.The dispute could not have ended so swiftly.It was not a problem of returning the kidnapped Karam child.20,000 warriors gathered. When that number is gathered, it doesn\u2019t end by saying,\u2019The situation is over, so scatter\u2019.Individual interests, interests between forces, and other interests will be intertwined.Most of all, if they have gathered that much, they will think that they have to fight.\u201cWhat happened? When did you arrive?\u201d\u201cI just got here.\u201dHe would. Cedric was wearing a windbreaker cloak covered with dust and snow. As soon as he entered the stronghold, he seemed to go straight to Artizea\u2019s room.Cedric said.\u201cOriginally, I was going to write a letter, but the word seldom comes out.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThere are some things I need to tell you, some things I\u2019d like to discuss with you, but I couldn\u2019t write the first sentence. That\u2019s why I just came.\u201d\u201cAre you having a big problem with something?\u201dShe asked so nervously. She couldn\u2019t accept Cedric\u2019s words saying that the first sentence could not be written literally.She wondered what more perplexing and serious things had arisen that couldn\u2019t be explained with more than just a few sentencesCedric smiled and looked at her.\u201cWell, it\u2019s a serious problem that I need your advice, but I\u2019ll put it off first. This is more urgent.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dArtizea blinked her eyes.\u201cI wanted to come see you before you left for the capital.\u201dHalf was true, the other half was a lie. This is because there was no need to come in such a hurry if he were just coming to see her. But it was true that he wanted to come.Cedric opened his arms and embraced her.Because he moved so slowly, Artizea could tell that she would be hugged by him. But, knowingly, she was startled and stiffened her body.A soft touch pressed over her lips. By the time she realized it was a kiss, he had already had her feet in the air.\u201cYou got lighter?\u201d\u201cThat, I don\u2019t.\u201dArtizea barely replied.Cedric lifted her lightly with one arm and unbuckled his dusty cloak with his other hand.The belt and coat, with his sword and gun hanging from it, fell to the floor.Artizea impulsively bent her body and wrapped his face with her two hands.Cedric\u2019s face was a little cold. It was because he was outside with the cold wind for a long time.\u201cAre you busy?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d\u201cHow about your body? Do you feel sick?\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m not sick.\u201dArtizea said, trembling her body. It seemed that her body temperature had risen a few degrees. She even felt hot at her eyelids so she couldn\u2019t keep her eyes open properly.Cedric laughed.\u201cThat\u2019s a relief.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m afraid you won\u2019t be able to hold out if you\u2019re in a bad condition like last time.\u201dThe end of his words became a whisper.His hot breath was mixed up with hers. Cedric put Artizea down on the bed.***When Artizea opened her eyes, it was dark everywhere.Her body was hot. It\u2019s been a long time since she slept so warmly. To be precise, it was the first time ever since she got off a ship coming to Evron Grand Duchy. In the port city, she was so exhausted that she was in a state of fainting rather than sleeping.Interestingly, it made her realize, by the temperature more than the feeling, that her body was falling asleep in contact with Cedric\u2019s arms.Her body was quite comfortable. She could hardly feel the stiffness of her fingers or the soreness of her shoulder, which was usually painful every time she woke up.\u201cUh\u2026\u2026\u201dStill, the sound of pain came out. Her muscles, which she usually didn\u2019t know existed, appealed for their presence here and there.The bed rocked. Artizea looked back subconsciously.Cedric, lying next to her, reached out his arm and lit a candle. And he turned his body toward Artizea.Artizea stared at his face in a vague mood. It was still an unrealistic feeling that this man was lying next to her.Then Cedric stretched his arms towards her. Cedric\u2019s arms were lightly wrapped around her stomach.Artizea closed her eyes tightly. She could hardly open her eyes and look at him.\u201cYou can sleep if you are confident that you could sleep until morning, but it would be better to open your eyes for a while. It\u2019s still evening.\u201dA soft voice penetrated into her ear. A trembling passed over Artizea\u2019s skin.Cedric caressed her cheek this time as she closed her eyes.\u201cDon\u2019t pretend you\u2019re asleep when you\u2019re up.\u201dHis arms were wrapped around her waist again. Artizea was dragged to him. Cedric hugged her tightly once more, and poked her.She was completely awakened.When she tried to open her eyes, Cedric\u2019s face was in front of her. Artizea had her eyelids down again this time.Cedric\u2019s hand swept her hair.\u201cIf you don\u2019t open your eyes, I\u2019ll kiss you.\u201dIt became a situation that she could escape or not escape. Artizea hesitantly raised her eyelids.Cedric didn\u2019t keep his words. That\u2019s because the moment their eyes met, he touched her lips again.It was only after Artizea\u2019s body, unable to breathe properly, lost strength that his lips fell. Cedric put himself down on the pillow and hugged her on top of him.Artizea lay down for a while, with her shoulders bent.Cedric made a languid face. Unlike the drowsiness and fatigue when he was tired, it looked like he was buried in bed and hated to get up.Artizea looked at the face in an unfamiliar mood. She knew for the first time that he could have such a face.Her stomach rumbled. She didn\u2019t think it was an empty stomach, but she was very hungry. It was unusual for her to feel hunger like this, so she felt strange.Then Cedric threw his laziness away and sat up. He then scratched his messy hair.\u201cShould we eat?\u201d\u201c\u2026..Yes.\u201dPerhaps he heard the rumble, Artizea\u2019s face turned red.\u201cWait a minute. I\u2019ll come back.\u201d\u201cCall someone. The maid will be waiting.\u201d\u201cI have to change my clothes anyway. And\u2026 I feel like I don\u2019t want to be disturbed now.\u201dArtizea was able to understand his words.It was dark and warm inside. The white fur on the wall reflects the light of the fireplace and candles, turning the room into a warm color.The warmth was like an afterglow. It was a heartfelt and desperate space, as if there were only two of them left in the world.At that moment Artizea knew, she wished that time would last forever.If there was nothing in the world, only she and him existed, she would be able to be happily buried in his arms as it is, with no more thoughts, no more sin, no more shame.However, they cannot help but open the door.Cedric stood up. And from the bed, he picked up the coat and boots that fell here and there.\u201cWhere\u2019s the key?\u201dHe asked, pointing to the door that was connected to his bedroom.Artizea sat up carefully, covering herself with a blanket. It was because she was too embarrassed to answer while lying down.\u201cNext to it, it\u2019s in a drawer.\u201dArtizea pointed to the small decorative table next to the door. Cedric opened the table drawer and pulled out the key.The locked door opened. Cedric left the door open and crossed over to the room over there.A cold wind blew through the open door. There was a sound of him throwing a pile of clothes on the floor and him pulling the string.As it got colder, she wanted to lie back with the blanket on, but Artizea carefully got out of bed.When she saw the cold air coming in from Cedric\u2019s bedroom, she wasn\u2019t sure about going through the dressing room to look for pajamas. If she called the maid, they would prepare her bath water and even bring her clothes to dress, but she didn\u2019t want to.Putting a robe over her bare body, Artizea approached the fireplace. She then filled the kettle with water and hung it on the fire.Soon Cedric returned with a plate of sandwiches and a bottle of milk in one hand. As soon as the door closed, it warmed up.\u201cFirst of all, eat something simple. The butler said he\u2019d prepare a proper dinner and would bring it here but I told him not to.\u201d\u201cThis is enough for me. But for Lord Cedric, this may not be enough.\u201d\u201cIt would be on my side if I didn\u2019t eat and it lasted long.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not talking about survival skills.\u201dArtizea said as if it were absurd. Cedric laughed lightly.\u201cWhatever you want to eat, I can bring it from the kitchen later. Sit down. Would you like to wait for tea? Or have milk?\u201d\u201cI like tea better.\u201dCedric brought his teaware. Artizea sat in front of the fireplace and watched him move.The bare feet in his slippers stuck in her eyes.\u201cIs there something wrong?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201dIt was a gaze that meant nothing. She just became unfamiliar with the realization that they had become a real couple.Cedric made tea. Artizea put the sandwich cut into bite-sized pieces in her mouth.Artizea didn\u2019t like cold food at all, but she felt unsure now, perhaps because of her warm body.There were boiled egg whites and apples cut thickly between the mashed potatoes and yolk. It tasted fresh whenever she cut it with her front teeth. It was slightly stimulating to see if there was a little mustard.\u201cYou want milk in the tea?\u201d\u201cYes, please.\u201dCedric poured milk into a glass and poured a thick tea on it.Artizea gratefully accepted it. And she laughed.\u201cOur Grace Grand Duke Evron is taking care of tea.\u201d\u201cIf you put it like that, it\u2019s water boiled by Marchioness Rosan.\u201dCedric smiled.She ate a couple of sandwiches and thought she would get some sleep afterward. Artizea could only ask.\u201cBy the way, was it really important to run here in such a hurry? What about Lysia?\u201d\u201cShe will come slowly. I was in a hurry because I was worried that you would leave immediately without waiting for my reply.\u201dCedric replied, putting sugar in the teacup and stirring it with a spoon.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 92": "Chapter 92Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 92Proofreader: somniumArtizea lowered her eyes down with an embarrassing face.\u201cI was going to wait for a reply.\u201dBut Cedric\u2019s words couldn\u2019t be said to be wrong.What Cedric was talking about wasn\u2019t just a letter. It was because he meant whether she was going to leave without thinking about Cedric himself and saying goodbye.She was going to do that. She was going to leave without seeing his face again as much as possible.She thought she needed to keep her distance.If she went to the capital, she may not meet Cedric for a while.Then, she will be able to strengthen her mind a little bit. She will be able to get rid of the anxiety and greed a little from her heart.The cold will come back. Artizea thought it would.She thought she shouldn\u2019t have come to Evron Grand Duchy. It is not a matter of whether the variables she has created have caused conflict or that the loyalty of the Grand Duchy has been cracked. Artizea herself is shaking.She wants to settle down now. She lost confidence to sacrifice even a little humanity left. She was trying to not be a hypocrite.There is a conflict whether or not it is necessary to kill for efficiency.That doesn\u2019t mean that the blood from her hands was washed away. There are a few left to be killed anyway.Minimization of sacrifice is only a reduction. The sacrifice does not disappear at all.If the efficiency gets worse, the damage eventually increases. Artizea was able to calculate it. Her red hands couldn\u2019t be whitened just because she took a drop of blood off from the start.She knew it, but she was worried that she would be caught by him right now. And he would hate it, so her hands and feet were heavy.It\u2019s stupid.Isn\u2019t she happy to sleep next to Cedric? She came to do something he couldn\u2019t do.She did so even thinking about the future. She should also think about after Cedric wears the emperor\u2019s crown.Artizea wanted to put away those who would interfere when he began to rule as much as possible. Before she leaves.But now, she wasn\u2019t sure she would be able to leave when the time comes.When she had just returned to the past, Artizea had a perfect picture of the future that she had envisioned in her mind. The right emperor and the good empress, who love each other, work together to change the world for the better.It must have been the most complete imperial figure the whole Empire wanted. But now she was in pain and couldn\u2019t even think about it.When she can\u2019t think of the future, she can\u2019t design schemes.So she had to leave.Artizea felt like her mind was completely in a mess. That was the only useful part of her.\u201cTia.\u201dCedric reached out his hand and touched her cheek and chin lightly. Artizea was lost in her thoughts, and she raised her head in amazement.A light kiss came down to reach her.She couldn\u2019t even think about it.The moment his lips fell, Cedric swept her lower mouth with his thumb as she exhaled a long sigh.\u201cCan\u2019t you just think about me now?\u201dArtizea again turned her gaze away embarrassingly. She was in trouble because she could only think of him.\u201cWhat\u2019s the situation at Thold Gate?\u201d\u201cAre you talking to me right now?\u201dArtizea laughed awkwardly. She then pulled the teapot and refilled her empty cup.\u201cThat was where you\u2019re supposed to be.\u201d\u201cEven if I say I wanted to talk and look at your face before you leave, you\u2019d argue that\u2019s where I belong, right?\u201d\u201cSomehow, you seem to be a little bit harsh on me today.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s your fault.\u201dCedric lowered his head lightly. Artizea turned her head away before being kissed by him.\u201cI think it\u2019s Lord Cedric\u2019s turn to talk.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s your side that\u2019s being harsh.\u201dCedric decided to give up by kissing her on the cheek instead.\u201cYou\u2019re at war, can you leave like this?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not in a state of skirmish. After the first fight, Karam retreated outside of engaging range.\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like they\u2019re going to retreat?\u201d\u201cThere seems to be a different purpose.\u201dCedric calmed his mind after a sip of tea. And he said,\u201cKaram made siege weapons.\u201dArtizea looked at him in amazement as she tried to put another sandwich in her mouth.\u201cDid Karam have that level of technology?\u201d\u201cNo. The siege weapon they made this time was practically useless. The battering ram was broken in one shot, and the catapult was inaccurate, and it smashed after flying the rock three times.\u201dCedric said.\u201cBut the design itself was a complete and functional catapult. The craftsmanship of the blacksmith who produced it was terribly poor.\u201d\u201cYou said it was the first time that a small troop crossed the Thold Mountains and attacked. Considering that it took time to cross the mountain range, they didn\u2019t just recklessly cross. Instead, they went over it and hid for a while, and then launched an attack concentrating on the Thold Gate\u2026\u2026. Two unprecedented things have happened.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cHave you ever thought about the possibility of having an insider? Since there is an exchange, someone among humans may have given information about tactics or weapons to Karam. In order to keep Lord Cedric in check or to harm Evron Grand Duchy, it is possible that someone has given the information to Karam. It\u2019s something you could do.\u201dArtizea asked to confirm. Cedric denied.\u201cI think that\u2019s unlikely. Because no one can speak the language. It is impossible for humans to enter the land of Karam and gain enough trust from the ruling class to incite a war if it is based on a simple trade or personal relationship \u201c\u201cWhat if it\u2019s a bribe? It\u2019s like giving money in exchange for threatening the Thold Gate with the right force.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a very human point of view.\u201dCedric smiled faintly.\u201cKarams don\u2019t value gold and silver. The most valuable things here are food and winter supplies. It\u2019s difficult to cross the mountain range without being noticed carrying enough resources to move Karam\u2019s ruling class.\u201dIt was what Artizea thought. If that amount of resources has moved from the mainland to the north, it will inevitably get caught in the information network.If the resource was scarce in the north, it would have been more noticeable.\u201cThen, do you think some Karam personally learned human tactics and persuaded others to do it?\u201d\u201cIn fact, it\u2019s hard to think of any possibility other than that.\u201dArtizea took a breath.If so, he must be the \u2018returned person\u2019.Evron was first defeated when Artizea plotted to oust Grand Duke Roygar.Eventually, Cedric won a miraculous victory by killing the king of Karam. However, the consequence remained.The fortress at Thold Gate, which had once collapsed, was not as solid as before. It was pierced once again after Lawrence became emperor.Lawrence was different from Emperor Gregor.Emperor Gregor wanted to use Evron Grand Duchy more thoroughly. To do that, Evron was kept alive.He spared the young Cedric to succeed the Grand Duchy and restored the predecessor Grand Duke and his wife\u2019s honor by reinstating them. He did not stop supplying supplies.However, Lawrence did not become a cool-headed politician.Originally, he hated Cedric. Not only was he temperamentally unfit, but he also unilaterally hated Lysia, obsessed with inferiority and jealousy after marrying her.After Lysia\u2019s death, the supplies to Evron Grand Duchy were completely cut off.Even the business trade was banned. Unlike Emperor Gregor, he wasn\u2019t trying to control Evron by using food as a strategic leverage, but because of hatred he intended to kill Evron.No matter how much Artizea warned, it was useless.Still, Cedric struggled for years. However, as a result, Evron perished.Cedric lost his base and wandered with the Knights. Since Lysia was also dead, he would have no more reason to come to the capital.The border was substantially re-established at the Elia Wall, the southern border of Evron. The empire became in need of enormous troops and armament.This is because Evron\u2019s know-how, which has been blocking Karam for over hundreds of years, has been lost, as well as the military key point of the Thold Gate.Protecting that border helped make the empire impoverished. Later, as the system completely collapsed, the border itself became obsolete.Karam had occupied the north.At the time, she didn\u2019t think much about the result.The north is a useless land. What Artizea was worried about at the time was the political unrest arising from Cedric becoming the centerpiece of the anti-emperor faction.In the end, it was only a matter of power struggling within the empire.However, if you look away and think about Karam\u2019s part, it becomes a completely different problem.At the time, there was no such thing as an action to evict Evron Grand Duchy\u2019s locals behind the Elia Wall.No matter how low the population density, the number of inhabitants was not small in terms of the entire territory.The fact that Karam occupied the land did not mean that it massacred the locals or created a colonial system to isolate them.If so, there would have been exchanges between those who survived and Karam.Exchanges took place even in the situation when it was blocked by the Thold Mountains. Therefore, if they live in the same land, the amount of exchange will increase and the quality will increase rapidly.In a situation where exchanges are scarce, what kind of Karam suddenly realized that he had to learn humans\u2019 technology and studied tactics? In that way, rather than thinking that something that had never before happened suddenly, it is more reasonable to think that the Karam who had learned when in contact with a new civilization has returned.It was the emergence of a variable that Artizea was most concerned about.\u201cIt was the same with retreating immediately after the first skirmish. Normally, Karam, once the battle begins, they become heated and couldn\u2019t see ahead. Since retreating is very dishonorable among them, there is hardly any strategic retreat. Rather, the commander said he had never seen such a quick retreat.\u201d\u201cThe fort commander is in his 50s, right?\u201d\u201cYes. Since he has been in the front line since his late teens, he has been fighting Karam for more than 30 years.\u201d\u201cThen, I can\u2019t say that it was a shallow experience.\u201d\u201cYes, it can be said that a Karam commander with that level of control has emerged.\u201dCedric said.\u201cI can guess who it is. I saw it on the wall.\u201dArtizea was lost in thought.Cedric continued.\u201cWhen I first heard that you were going to the capital, I thought you\u2019d take the time. If a small squadron of Karam had attacked beyond Thold, and there was even a siege weapon, even if it wasn\u2019t actually a situation here, it would be taken as a big problem in the capital.\u201dThe capital will be tense by maintaining the deadlock. The funny thing is, the Evron becomes a target that cannot be touched even more.A war is a war, even if it does not engage in active engagement and is just a sit-in. Supplies will run out quickly, and troops will be damaged.Cedric was willing to take it and expand the range that Artizea could operate.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Whether it\u2019s successful or not, it will be meaningful.\u201cOn the other hand, if we kill him, Karam\u2019s development will take a big step backwards. If failed experiences accumulate, it will be difficult to try new things again. Due to the nature of Karam, whose history is not easily accumulated, one failure remains only as a failure, and there is nothing new from it. It will take a long time for them to learn.\u201dArtizea smiled even though she said so.\u201cIt seems like you have already made a decision in your mind.\u201dCedric smiled awkwardly.\u201cYes. I want to talk to him. The only problem is with what you are doing in the mainland. Right now, domestic politics is urgent and dangerous.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t take me too lightly. Of course, if there\u2019s a war, then it\u2019s no different from starting to play poker with three aces, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t solve the problem.\u201dArtizea flicked her finger.\u201cAnd besides, the priority is wrong.\u201d\u201cThe priority?\u201d\u201cThe work I am trying to do couldn\u2019t take precedence over Lord Cedric\u2019s will. What the Emperor decides for the future of the empire is the national decision, nothing precedes that.\u201dPreviously, Cedric asked if a process without results was worthwhile.Artizea had her own answer to the question. The process without results is not worthwhile. Nor does purposeless means move circumstances. Power without the purpose does not produce.So Cedric\u2019s purpose comes first. Acquisition of power is only a means.Artizea had lived with her means and purpose reversed throughout her previous life. She knew it only before she died.Now she was a means to serve Cedric\u2019s purpose. So she was able to firmly answer him. She didn\u2019t have to put off what Cedric was trying to do for her scheme.Cedric\u2019s face turned a little red. Artizea asked with a slight smile.\u201cYou\u2019re not going to say that you\u2019re still not prepared or you\u2019re going to think about it later, are you?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like that.\u201dHe just started to feel weird about the fact that she considered him her master. He was captivated by the thought of whether he could handle it.However, she felt closer when she was held in his arms.And he knew now that feeling wouldn\u2019t be wrong.\u201cI tried to assist you, but I\u2019m going to get assistance. It\u2019s going to be a lot of political pressure. Can you stop the Great Temple?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve said it before, in the mainland, there are very few things that can\u2019t be done with money.\u201dThe Temple is corrupt. Enough to forge a trust.In fact, it was a simpler opponent than the noble family, a blood-related group, in that she could move with power and wealth.She has several cards to negotiate with the Temple.The problem was different from the Karam crop. Growing Karam crops is an active acceptance of Karam, which becomes an offensive card that allows the temple to excommunicate Evron Grand Duchy.However, it is a military issue to have a dialogue at the Thold Gate. There was not much justification for the Great Temple to intervene here.As a commander, Cedric had full control over the conflict area. The power of Grand Duke Evron in wartime is powerful.In order to slow down the war, for the operation, for the ceasefire, for the exchange of prisoners, it is natural to contact the commander of the opposing army.The Temple cannot interfere unless they have the authority to order Evron\u2019s army to throw their entire lives away.Of course, there will be backlash. Cedric will be happy to bear the political burden for the dialogue.And it will be a thrilling cornerstone of the north in the future when he wears the emperor\u2019s crown.Problem that needs to be faced head-on is different from a problem that needs to be bypassed.Instead, Artizea thought that she would have to raise a turmoil in the capital. The more she messes with domestic politics, the more free Cedric will be.Cedric nodded his head.\u201cOkay. Then I\u2019ll try to draw the wartime tension as much as possible, and try to engage in the negotiation as if it was an unavoidable crisis. I\u2019ll leave the supply of supplies to you.\u201d\u201cNow you know how to think about cheating.\u201dArtizea laughed.Cedric smiled bitterly. And he stretched out his arms.\u201cAh.\u201dArtizea was pulled to him and held in his arms. Cedric patted her head lightly.\u201cThere is no reason to overdo.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay to fail. In the worst case, Evron Grand Duchy will remain. Then you can start over. So don\u2019t let yourself, mind or body be broken.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cOkay. You\u2019re a wise person, so I\u2019m sure you understand what I mean.\u201dCedric tapped Artizea\u2019s head lightly, pressing it against his chest.At first Artizea was straining her body tightly. But she didn\u2019t want to get out of Cedric\u2019s arms.The serious conversation was over, and her thoughts stopped.In his steadfast arms, her strength soon ran out. As she leaned against Cedric\u2019s chest, she heard the beating of his heart in her ears.Hearing the sound of his heart and the sound of the crackling and burning of firewood in the fireplace made her sleepy. What she ate was already digested, and she was no longer hungry.\u201cSo now that you\u2019re here, I have to talk to you about it. About the Jordyn family.\u201d\u201cDispose of them as you wish.\u201d\u201cCan I do that?\u201d\u201cEven if I didn\u2019t come, don\u2019t you already have a plan about what to do?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cJust do it. I\u2019ve already left the stronghold to you. It seems better for you to do it yourself than getting it turned around a few days after I\u2019ve given the punishment.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s also true.\u201dCedric\u2019s hand caressed her ear.\u201cAre you sleepy?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026.. Are you going to depart for Thold tomorrow?\u201d\u201cI have to. I can\u2019t be away for long.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dArtizea tried to hold her eyes half open.With Cedric\u2019s early-morning nature, he will probably leave tomorrow before she even opens her eyes.Then she won\u2019t be able to meet him for a while. If her luck was really bad, this could have been the last time.Or even if she\u2019s really lucky, this could be the last time, too.She thought it would be better to leave without seeing his face, but she felt disappointed about it.Cedric\u2019s hand covered Artizea\u2019s cheek. Artizea grasped his top with strength in her hand as she was about to fall into sleep.Then Cedric hugged her and carried her to bed. Artizea slightly woke up from her drowsiness, as she lay her head on the pillow.Cedric said.\u201cDo you not want to fall asleep?\u201d\u201cA little bit.\u201d\u201cThen I will make you sleep well until morning.\u201dArtizea\u2019s face turned red.***The next day, as expected, Cedric wasn\u2019t there when Artizea opened her eyes.The key to the door between the two bedrooms was in the keyhole. Artizea gently touched the key.When she turned it halfway, the key was unlocked.Artizea locked it and she released it again. Then she threw the key back into the drawer.It was in the afternoon that Lysia returned home.She, too, came in with a new reddish face after greeting the cold wind. As soon as she came in, the first thing she did was complain to Artizea.\u201cPlease stop His Grace.\u201d\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u201cWe started traveling together, but he ignored all the knights and went alone. His Grace\u2019s horse is an excellent horse, so if he runs that fast, no one can catch up. What if there were more Karam troops when he went alone there could be a big commotion\u2026.\u201d\u201cI see. He\u2019s on his way back?\u201d\u201cI ran into him in the middle.\u201d\u201cOh no. The knights must have gone back without a break.\u201d\u201cYes. It would have been okay if he didn\u2019t rush so much. He could have come here slowly. I know he\u2019s doing that because he wanted to see Your Grace quickly, but if that\u2019s the case, he can be gone a few more days\u2026\u201dArtizea looked at Lysia awkwardly.However, Lysia didn\u2019t seem to care about the fact that Cedric had come to see her like that. On the contrary, she said it with a light smile.\u201cWhen Your Grace said you were going to the capital in such a hurry, I wondered if it would be okay to inform him with a letter. Of course, the two of you would have spoken enough, but it happened only a few days ago. Besides, you\u2019re a newlywed\u2026\u201d\u201cOh, well.\u201d\u201cThere is a difference when it\u2019s a distance you can go in a few days and the distance you can\u2019t.\u201dArtizea turned her head and said.\u201cI heard that the war situation is stable.\u201d\u201cYes. Unless there are more reinforcements on the side of Karam, it will be fully controllable. It\u2019s a relief. I think it would be okay if His Grace stayed here a little longer.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure there will be work for him to be done at this opportunity. So do I.\u201d\u201cYes. \u201cLysia looked at her with a slightly sad face.She didn\u2019t know Cedric\u2019s purpose, nor Artisea\u2019s purpose, but she only guessed Artizea was being chased by something. And that Cedric is trying to catch it.Both Cedric and her father would always tell her that she had eyes to see the truth.Lysia didn\u2019t believe that she had that power. If she had, she would have already understood what the thing was, and she would have been able to settle it over for Artizea.Said Artizea.\u201cGo and rest. You look tired.\u201d\u201cYou have to be angry with His Grace later. He shouldn\u2019t walk away from the knights.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dArtizea smiled.It was then. Sophie came in and asked.\u201cMadam, Dame Mel Jordyn, Dame Fiona Jordyn and Dame Haley Jordyn are here.\u201d\u201cTake them to the parlor. Tell them I\u2019ll be there soon.\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019ll pick up the tea.\u201dSophie politely greeted and went out.Lysia tilted her head.\u201cDid you call Mel?\u201d\u201cYes. Would you like to meet them with me?\u201dLysia briefly looked at herself and her outfit.She didn\u2019t change her clothes, so she wore cotton trousers, a thick sweater, and a fur leather vest. Her hair was tied tightly so as not to get in the way. Now she looked at herself, she was not like the lady-in-waiting of the Grand Duchess.Of course, she didn\u2019t care in front of the sisters of the Jordyn family, whom she knew well from an early age.\u201cIf Your Grace is not ashamed of me.\u201d\u201cThen let\u2019s go together.\u201dLysia stepped forward and opened the door in front for Artizea.As they went into the parlor, the three sisters knelt at the same time.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 94": "Chapter 94Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 94Proofreader: somniumMel was still in the knight\u2019s outfit with an epaulet. However, Fiona and Hayley were dressed in plain clothes made of undyed cotton, and their hair was tied with a headscarf.Unlike Mel, who maintains her position as a Knight, these two were now officially complete commoners. Strictly speaking, she was lower than Sophie, who works in the castle.\u201cDon\u2019t kneel.\u201dArtizea shook her hand. She then sat down and offered three people a seat.\u201cLet\u2019s sit down.\u201d\u201cHow could we.\u201d\u201cYou hope you could.\u201dThe three people exchanged glances with each other.There was no way to know what caused Artizea to call the sisters.The sisters did not blame Artizea. It\u2019s not like they didn\u2019t know what Aubrey had done.On the contrary, the third daughter, Hayley, whose age difference from Aubrey was small, expressed her hatred towards Aubrey, saying that there will be something to come.[How many times did I tell you not to pamper her around like that? I\u2019ve told you since I was a kid that she\u2019s the one who kept thinking beyond her place.]Mel couldn\u2019t say anything to Hayley, who was so angry.However, even so, there was sadness and suffering. She was anxious too.She did not have any other thoughts, as a knight of Evron.However, Fiona, who is inherently timid, had become sensitive. Aubrey\u2019s fault is wrong, but apart from that, she also had her own husband and children. She couldn\u2019t harbor a feeling of resentment.Hayley was a bit sharper in reason than the rest. It was easy to guess that the reason Artizea invited them was because of the anxiety of Evron\u2019s stronghold.\u2018She\u2019s not going to ask for responsibility, right?\u2019Aubrey was already dead, and Jordyn was punished. What else can they do with the impact left behind?In addition to their rights, their obligations disappeared. The sin ended by being punished.Mel, who is responsible for the Count\u2019s clan as the family\u2019s eldest daughter, may be a little different, but for Fiona and Hayley, they had nothing to inherit.\u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve heard the news, but in a few days I\u2019ll leave this place and return to the capital.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dMel replied as a representative.\u201cI know that it is possible that it will increase the anxiety of the people. Probably, it is not desirable to the Dames. At this time, when the Grand Duke himself guards the fortress of Thold Gate, the Grand Duchess uses the land route in winter to leave the Grand Duchy and returning to the capital would seem as if I was afraid of the conflict and abandon the people to run away.\u201d\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t dare think about it that way.\u201dMel was very serious. Artizea shook her head.\u201cI know that everyone\u2019s mind is not the same. There are rumors that I was trying to run away with the South Sea people. It\u2019s worth misunderstanding because I\u2019m leaving in the midst of that.\u201dArtizea said bitterly\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201dThe rumors were no different from what Aubrey\u2019s in the end. So all three of the sisters bowed their heads.\u201cI\u2019m not blaming the Dames. That\u2019s what the situation is.\u201d\u201cYour Grace.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have the desire to be the honorable Grand Duchess. I may never come back to this estate again, but there shouldn\u2019t be any resentment reaching the Grand Duchy or breaking the Grand Duchy\u2019s unity.\u201dEven Lysia was surprised by this.\u201cSo Dame Mel.\u201d\u201cYes. \u201cMel responded politely. She couldn\u2019t guess at all what Artizea was talking about.\u201cWouldn\u2019t you like to be my lady-in-waiting?\u201dMel opened her eyes wide. Artizea smiled without knowing it. This is because Mel\u2019s face looked more like Cedric than Aaron or Margaret.\u201cI\u2019m not going to bother you talking about Aubrey. I know that she\u2019s been guilty of a crime, but it\u2019s a personal deviant behavior. More to say, it will only hurt the hearts of the Dames.\u201d\u201cYour Grace\u2026.\u201d\u201cThe punishment imposed on the Jordyn family was decided by the Grand Duke himself, so I can\u2019t turn it over here. Besides, Margaret took responsibility and resigned, so I can\u2019t call it back. I think it\u2019s the right choice, Dame Mel.\u201dFiona and Hayley took a breath.\u201cAs my lady-in-waiting, I would like you to take the role of overseeing the Grand Duchy on my behalf.\u201dThat way, she can virtually reinstate the Jordyn family without touching Cedric\u2019s punishment.Of course, the title cannot be returned immediately. The same is true of the men that were handed down to Aaron and Margaret.However, if it was the lady-in-waiting of the Grand Duchess, the position was never lower than the count. The people of the Grand Duchy would consider this to be the return of Jordyn County.Any vassals and people who sympathize with the Jordyn family will be delighted.\u201cBut.\u201dMel stuttered a little.\u201cI am the blood relative of a great sinner.\u201d\u201cDame has washed the shame of the family and proved your loyalty. You are good at military affairs, know the situation of the Grand Duchy, and are trusted with confidence by myself and others, so there is no one but you. This does not hurt the people and honor the Jordyn family. It will be an opportunity to regain the trust of the vassals as well as to restore it.\u201dMel lowered her head.\u201cThat\u2019s more than I can say. If it is the management of the stronghold, the Grand Duke has already left it to Viscount Agate.\u201d\u201cThe Grand Duke left it to Viscount Agate because he thought I would be here. He told him to assist me because I didn\u2019t know anything about military affairs.\u201dHowever, to control not only the stronghold, but also through the entire Grand Duchy, military capability alone cannot be sufficient.\u201cDame knows the history of the Grand Duchy and has been assisting next to Aaron and Margaret for a long time. In the future, as Countess Jordyn, you are going to stand right under His Grace the Grand Duke, and as a knight, you will be able to cope with military issues. There is no one more suitable than Dame Mel.\u201dArtizea\u2019s will has been fully conveyed. Fiona and Hayley looked nervous and looked at Mel.\u201cWould it be difficult?\u201dArtizea asked again.In many ways, there was no better solution than this.But Artizea herself is Aubrey\u2019s enemy. If Mel couldn\u2019t take it emotionally, she couldn\u2019t help it.\u201cNo.\u201dMel replied with a hoarse voice.\u201cA Jordyn\u2019s daughter has committed a sin against the Grand Duchess, and Jordyn\u2019s daughter will repay it. Even if you offered for me to serve just as your lady-in-waiting, I would be willing to devote my life to it. But I\u2019m glad you offered me honor.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dArtizea said quietly. She meant it. If Mel doesn\u2019t accept the offer, she\u2019s leaving an element of anxiety on the Grand Duchy.She spoke to Fiona this time.\u201cI hope that you will help Dame Mel to take care of the Grand Duchy together. The reason I called the three together is because this is not a suggestion to the individual Dame Mel, but rather because it is a story that I wanted the entire Jordyn family to return. I hope you understand my true feelings\u2026.\u201dAnd Artizea finally looked at Hayley and said separately.\u201cDame is single.\u201d\u201cYes. \u201c\u201cIf your heart permits, I wish you would follow me to the capital as my lady-in-waiting.\u201dHayley\u2019s face instantly blushed with excitement and then turned white again.\u201cThe Jordyn family has lost its title. It is within the Grand Duchy that Mel was the lady-in-waiting, and in order to take the place, she needs the status. But in the capital, someone like me to be recognized as your lady-in-waiting. I think it is difficult.\u201d\u201cHayley, don\u2019t say that. If you put it like that, I\u2019m from\u2026\u201dLysia intervened.Artizea beckoned her not to say any more. It was because she didn\u2019t like getting the story complicated or cumbersome in that way.\u201cLysia\u2019s problem, Dame Mel\u2019s problem, after all, are within the Grand Duchy far away from the capital. It\u2019s not because the Grand Duchy is downplayed, but what\u2019s important in the end is how many of Evron\u2019s vassals go with me as my lady-in-waiting.\u201d\u201cDo you mean that it is possible to create trust by force while showing to the outside how strong the Grand Duchy and Your Grace are?\u201dHayley asked provocatively.Artizea looked at her with a slightly surprised face. It was because Hayley identified the former, but also understood the latter and had pinpointed all of her own intentions.To create trust by force. That\u2019s right. In short, taking Hayley as her lady-in-waiting included checks and hostages against the Jordyn family.Artizea smiled.\u201cNow that you say so, that makes me really want to take the Dame.\u201dHayley politely bowed her head.\u201cI will follow you.\u201d\u201cHayley!\u201dSurprised Fiona raised her voice. It also has a different meaning to follow to the capital.Whether Hayley meant to be loyal to Artizea or to follow her as a hostage, it was inconceivable for Fiona.Hayley ignored Fiona.\u201cBecause trust between people doesn\u2019t just arise. And I know how important the people who will be next to you in the future are. Thank you for giving Jordyn the opportunity to earn trust even after the betrayal.\u201d\u201cA capable and tactful person is always welcome. Like the Dame\u2019s words, there was a desire to forcibly build trust with Jordyn, but more than that, I am interested in the Dame.\u201dHayley stood up and knelt on one knee in front of Artizea.***Artizea lastly met with Margaret.Margaret was terribly haggard, but she politely greeted Artizea.\u201cI have nothing more to say, because I even brought up a foolish child and caused Your Grace to go through a terrible thing that Your Grace should not suffer. I will not be able to pay back with my life. I am sorry.\u201dIt was their first time meeting since that day.Margaret said so, dripping her tears to her knees. Artzea raised her by grabbing her hand.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201dShe couldn\u2019t say more, but Margaret washed Artizea\u2019s hands with tears, as if that was enough.All the people who heard the Dames\u2019 news were delighted.Cedric\u2019s punishment was in effect and she was still deprived of her title for three years. However, she did not believe that Mel, who became the Grand Duchess\u2019 lady-in-waiting, would not inherit the County.As a result, the punishment was diluted and the Jordyn family was forgiven. In the Grand Duchy, it was believed that Jordyn\u2019s long loyalty had been rewarded.Some people still felt anxious.But Artizea knew that once she had left, most would soon forget what had happened. Because that is human nature.If you create a familiar situation where people can feel safe, people will settle down. And it is not surprising for the people here that Mel succeeds Aaron and Margaret.Three days later, Artizea finished her preparations and left Evron\u2019s stronghold. A winter wind blew throughout her long return.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

A group of young men lifted up a woman and headed to the fountain.\u201cWait! Wait! Are you really going to put me in there?\u201d\u201cDid you not call for a bet earlier? You said you were going into the fountain.\u201d\u201cI wasn\u2019t saying I was going to get drunk!\u201d\u201cIf you fall into a fountain outside, you freeze to death.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to be drunk\u2026 kyaak!\u201dThe young men threw the woman into the fountain without hesitation.The light-colored dress sucked the liquor and turned it yellow. The woman crawled out of the fountain and threw off her shoes.\u201cSuck my toes!\u201dOne of the young men knelt in front of the woman, as soon as the words were over, and laughter burst out.No one was upset that she had ruined the alcohol. There were only victims one after another.People laughed as if it was something really funny. Then, instead of dipping a glass in the fountain, they drank alcohol that flowed from the top.Food was piled up everywhere.The sound of the band\u2019s performance was buried in laughter and promiscuous jokes. Even though it was close to midnight, the candles were lit so brightly that it looked like broad daylight.Thin silk draperies hung from the ceiling were lit up and shone like jewels. Young beautiful women wearing butterfly-shaped masks that cover only their eyes, holding the veil and dancing, went round and round. At first glance, the men were struggling by a glimpse of their appearance.Among them, the most beautiful was Miraila in a golden dress.Even if she covered half her face with a mask, her appearance was unique. The mask, decorated with gold and precious stones, was gorgeous, but the jaw line and the mouth exposed under it were much more beautiful.Her head, raised to reveal the nape of her neck, was decorated with diamonds, shining every time she moved. It looked brighter when the light of the diamond shined on the skin, which was naturally white and lively.Miraila was a beauty sitting on the lap of the Emperor. But the Emperor was not a power over her, for her beauty alone was enough to become the queen.Even by a tweak of her finger, worshipers rushed in. Behind her, there were a lot of men who would throw their bodies in front of her, even if she criticized and mocked them, if they could brush their hands on Miraila\u2019s hand, even if it robbed them of their fortune.\u201cLiquor! Sweet!\u201dAs soon as Miraila shouted in her cheerful voice, more than ten glasses of sweet rose wine and honey were served out.An anticipation-filled gaze turned to Miraila. Because she repeated twice that she would dance with the person who brought her favorite drink.With an arrogant gaze, Miraila looked at the glasses one by one.And she gently found a jewel in the last cup held from behind as the owner wrapped her body.\u201cHo.\u201dThe large ruby \u200b\u200bcontained in the white wine reflected red light, turning the glass pink. Even if the pearls were melted and made into a drink, it wouldn\u2019t have been nicer than this.\u201cOh, it\u2019s difficult.\u201dMiraila pushed the cup with her hand. She smiled at the man standing behind it.Of course it was the Emperor. He was wearing a white mask that covered his entire face, and his clothes were something plain and modest.But no one else knew who he was. Who dared to wrap up Miraila\u2019s body so naturally?However, Miraila, who pretended to not know him, slipped out of his arms. It\u2019s obvious who\u2019s who, but at a masquerade, it\u2019s a law to pretend you don\u2019t know.The Emperor followed her in a relaxed footsteps.\u201cWouldn\u2019t you dance with me when you get a pleasing drink?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t take it.\u201d\u201cI have to force myself to get it.\u201dLike a mermaid, Miraila roamed inside the banquet hall. A silk veil curled around her body like a wave of water.The Emperor stretched out his hand as if he was anxious at her moving away in a distance to not get caught.Miraila sneaked up on him. The Emperor laughed and flipped the wine glass over her shoulder. The ruby went into Miraila\u2019s clothes.The women holding the veil covered the two with it.Anyway, the banquet itself was created for the Emperor\u2019s entertainment.The Emperor held a banquet for Miraila, but all the banquets he attended became a banquet for the Emperor. Even more so if it was opened for pleasure and entertainment.Everyone looked away from the couple without knowing.Miraila\u2019s hand came out of the veil. Then she squeezed the wrist of one of the women holding the veil.The gaze from the crowd gathered, turned to the woman and then fell again. Soon the woman was dragged into the veil.***Rye sat at a table on the second floor of the banquet hall, looking down at the scene.\u2018This is a struggle.\u2019He may not be the only one who felt that way.All the luxuries and depravities of the world were in this banquet hall.Rye has lived a life that is not very clean. He killed, bought and sold people for money. If only his family and his colleagues were okay, the lives of other humans were casually thrown into the pit.It was such a degenerate banquet hall that all the corruption he had seen and suffered up to this time felt light.However, perhaps minute-by-minute, gold coins were disappearing in this luxurious depravity seemed like an impulse to live disappearing in the slums where he had lived.Last night, Miraila came to visit him with a pale face.[\u201cIs it really true that there are no spirits in this mansion, Master?\u201d][\u201cWhat are you so afraid of?\u201d]Rye said, embarrassingly.He did well as the necromancer that Artizea demanded.He did a little too well. Miraila was thinking that he was really a psychic with great powers.Once she started believing, the more Rye denied, the stronger Miraila\u2019s faith became. She called Rye a master and admired him.Rye\u2019s room was also assigned in the Rosan mansion. Even though he refused a few times to no avail, Miraila asked him to stay there.The butler who now manages the Rosan mansion was the one chosen by the Emperor\u2019s attendant. Because Miraila believed in him, he didn\u2019t drive him out. However, the butler didn\u2019t hide the sign that he would catch the trick and play along until this scammer showed a slip.Rye was anxious and uncomfortable. He didn\u2019t stop by as often as possible. But that didn\u2019t go so well.He must somehow maintain Miraila\u2019s trust until further order.Miraila was anxious. And he was afraid.[\u201cWhen my daughter was around, everything went well. Well, of course, not everything went as expected, but His Majesty didn\u2019t dislike her that much\u2026 I thought everything would go well if it was staying this way.\u201d][\u201cIsn\u2019t the Dowager Marchioness still the Emperor\u2019s most beloved one?\u201d][\u201cI\u2019m anxious. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m going crazy. Nothing goes the way I thought.\u201d]Miraila said as if clinging on to him.[\u201cI think all that happened after my daughter left. After that, nothing good happened. Is there really no evil spirits in this mansion?\u201d][\u201cNo such thing, madam.\u201d][\u201cYou said that old spirits stay in old mansions. And if the spirits here are the souls from the Marquisate Rosan, it\u2019s nothing strange that they\u2019re cursing me.\u201d]She had never thought about it when she had Artizea there.There was anxiety about her beauty fading. However, the Emperor favored Lawrence, and would not abandon her, the mother of his beloved son.It was different now. The Emperor still cared for Miraila, but the mask of family was cracked.Lawrence frequently met and greeted the Emperor. He was called to important meetings as often as before.However, unlike before, the three ceased to have meals together.It was initially Lawrence\u2019s fault. He visited the Empress\u2019 palace more often than visiting the Emperor with Miraila.And now the Emperor did not bother to call Lawrence.Miraila has lost her composure. Like her youth, she produced all sorts of splendor and tried to entertain the Emperor. The period of being a leisurely wife was over.The Emperor also knew that she was desperate. That is why he often held banquets to comfort her and bought whatever she wanted.But that was not enough. Ultimately, the favor must be received by Lawrence. Only then can she live with peace of mind that she will not be thrown away forever, but will Lawrence come back as her son just because he becomes Emperor?She wasn\u2019t sure. It would be fortunate to come back after he becomes the adoptee of the Empress and becomes the crown prince. But it seemed unlikely.Artizea left the house altogether. She left a mansion and pension, but even Miraila knew it was to cut ties without noise.Miraila was afraid that she was left behind in the Rosan mansion.[\u201cStill, my daughter is the line of the Marquis\u2019 blood. If the spirits started cursing because of her leaving\u2026\u201d][\u201cThe soul has no power to curse people, Dowager Marchioness. It is people who curse people.\u201d]The reason Miraila was in jeopardy was Artizea.But Miraila wasn\u2019t smart enough to pinpoint the cause-and-effect of all that.But she just felt that everything started to go wrong after Artizea left.And after being stuck in the Rossan mansion, she wondered if it was because the Marquisate\u2019s souls cursed her.Rye came to the banquet because Miraila asked for it. If there is someone that cursed her at the venue, or if there is an evil spirit from the imperial palace, he was to let her know.\u2018It\u2019s better to live, Rye.\u2019Rye thought so and chewed the peanuts as snacks. He drank all the luxurious spirits he would not have even smelled if it were the original standard of living.It was when he was about to get up.Miraila approached. Instead of soaking wet with alcohol, she wore a thick gown, and the mask changed to plain white covering the entire face.But Rye could recognize her right away. In the first place, Miraila wasn\u2019t a figure that could cover her face so hidden.\u201cMaster.\u201dRye didn\u2019t listen to her.\u201cDon\u2019t behave like you know me in a place like this.\u201dRye went out in a hurry. He doesn\u2019t know if Miraila left the Emperor alone or if she left him in the arms of other women. He shouldn\u2019t have known.This trust has really risen to a dangerous level.Artizea\u2019s instructions were needed. And fortunately, she was expected to return soon.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This is because Artizea reduced the load to move quickly.She moved by buying all of the necessary items, giving away or throwing away what was no longer needed.Evron was still covered in snow, but the capital was already warm. It was completely spring to those who live in the North.Artizea did not enter the capital immediately. She rented a whole inn in a nearby town and stopped for now.Before she went to the capital, she wanted to know what was going on.Upon receiving the call, Freil and Ansgar headed straight there.It was Hayley who greeted the two.\u201cNo, Dame Hayley.\u201dFreil was startled and called her. Hayley shrugged her shoulders.\u201cIt\u2019s been a while. And it\u2019s not \u2018Dame\u2019 anymore. Have you not heard the news?\u201dFreil tilted his head. Hayley sighed.\u201cWell, the Grand Duke is in his estate, but it wasn\u2019t important enough to send a messenger to the capital to inform it. Did you hear about the war?\u201d\u201cYes, I know that well. Because there was a report in the palace. Is it true that Karam made a siege weapon?\u201d\u201cYes. I\u2019ll tell you more about it later. It\u2019s not that serious.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t Dame Hayley coming here because it\u2019s a serious situation?\u201dAnsgar said to Freil\u2019s question.\u201cI think Dame Hayley came as the Madam\u2019s lady-in-waiting.\u201dHe knew that Artizea was planning to choose her lady-in-waiting from among the vassals of the Grand Duchy.\u201cYes, that\u2019s what it is.\u201d\u201cHer Grace has a vision to see people. I\u2019ve always been thinking that Dame Hayley is not just someone who will only end up as an administrator.\u201dFreil said. Hayley was one of the few who communicated well in the stuffy and uptight stronghold.\u201cBut you managed to be convinced. You don\u2019t want to deal with complicated affairs.\u201d\u201cThere was a situation where I had no choice but to do so. Go to the parlor first. Her Grace is taking a bath right now, so she will come out a little later.\u201dFreil and Ansgar looked at each other.They knew Artizea is not someone who keeps people waiting that way.That meant they had to hear about the stronghold from Hayley before greeting her.All three were the ones who could notice it.Hayley led the two to the room where it was used as the parlor. And she gave a brief summary of the news of the stronghold.The two lamented at the news of the Jordyn family.In Ansgar\u2019s case, he had seen Aubrey since birth. He even wiped away tears lightly.Freil didn\u2019t know Aubrey well because he wasn\u2019t from the stronghold.The last time he saw her was 3 years ago, at the time Aubrey was 15 years old. He thought she was an immature little girl.He simply felt sorry for the Jordyn family and the circumstances.But apart from that regret, Freil said calmly.\u201cIt was time for a generational change. Dame Mel took over at the right time. Evron is also about to change.\u201d\u201cFor the sake of Her Grace?\u201d\u201cDo you know what I\u2019m talking about, Dame Hayley? Just by showing loyalty and following quietly, it\u2019s hard to survive.\u201dSaid Freil. Having been on a mission to collect information in the capital, he fully understood the urgency of the situation.\u201cSir Aaron and Margaret are also faithful and capable, but just hearing the name of the imperial family, they tend to shrink their body. Dame Mel is highly knowledgeable and conservative, but she is younger and more flexible than Sir Aaron. In addition, Dame Mel will be more comfortable for His Grace the Grand Duke.\u201d\u201cYes. I think it was right for my father to retire first. My father has never had any other intentions, and also showed unchanging trust to the Grand Duchy, but it is to the credit of his predecessors he got to sit firmly. It\u2019s not always a comfortable existence.\u201d\u201cBesides, Sir Aaron and Margaret, both of them tended to feel like they were supposed to take care of the Grand Duke and the other children\u2026\u201dAnsgar muttered to himself. He was no exception.Freil said.\u201cWhen it comes to serving Her Grace, it is not enough to be loyal because the Grand Duchess has chosen you.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not thinking that far yet. I\u2019m a lady-in-waiting, but in reality it\u2019s close to being a hostage.\u201d\u201cDame Hayley\u2026\u201d\u201cJordyn has a betrayal history. It is natural that Her Grace wants to be prepared just in case.\u201dHayley said so, added.\u201cAnd I\u2019m going to see now whether the Grand Duchess is a loyal person.\u201dIn her view, Cedric was an emotional idealist.He had nothing wrong with his ideals, but it was unrealistic. As Grand Duke Evron, he could maintain the status quo, but anything more than that was difficult.Hayley thought that was also possible because Evron Grand Duchy stood in a special position.Hayley loved her family and wanted to make the Grand Duchy a good place. However, the trust in Cedric was partial.She had loyalty, but her loyalty was not personal and passionate, but more of a childlike instinctive level of affection for the land to which she belonged.In short, if the security of the Grand Duchy and the safety of her family are at odds, she will choose her family without hesitation. It was completely different from the loyalty of Mel or the other knights.But Artizea was a little different. What she demanded was to think and move beyond the boundaries of what is called Evron Grand Duchy.The mutual trust to the Grand Duchy, that was as blind as what a child felt, was broken. Cedric seemed to be starting to see reality as well.Hayley thought it was better. Unless the goal was only to survive while remaining subordinate to the mainland forever.There is no better means than self-preservation to let them touch and rely on their wounds to make them feel attached to each other.If they stayed as they were, they would have held each other and sank without any change or development.Hayley was giving up Evron. That is why the junior administrators were satisfied without any objection.But if it could be different, there was no reason not to change.Freil smiled. He could fully understand Hayley\u2019s mind.Both Freil and Hayley were aware of the problems of Evron Grand Duchy.However, he wasn\u2019t enough to get ahead and change Evron. Even if his status was a little higher, it would have been the same.In the end, the only thing that can make Evron different is Grand Duke Evron.\u201cAnyway, Dame Hayley is here, so I\u2019m reassured.\u201d\u201c\u2019Dame\u2019 doesn\u2019t fit her status anymore.\u201d\u201cThen, should I call you Miss Hayley now? Or Lady Hayley?\u201d\u201cAt this age, Lady is a little too\u2026\u201dHayley had an embarrassed face.While having such a conversation, Artizea came in. Lysia followed after her.The three stood up from their seats. Freil and Ansgar politely knelt on one knee to greet them.Artizea gave Lysia and the others time to greet for a moment.She sat down at the top and offered everyone a seat.\u201cSit comfortably.\u201d\u201cYou had a hard time traveling a long way.\u201d\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a very hard road. The Grand Duchy was a good place. Loyal.\u201dAt Artizea\u2019s words, Ansgar bowed his head.He had already heard the story from Hayley, so it was enough to read the meaning behind her words.He felt sorry.\u201cI want to hear about the situation in the capital city. What happened all winter. First, let\u2019s hear from Ansgar. How is the Grand Duke\u2019s mansion?\u201d\u201cWithout Your Graces, what else is there? The renovation work was completed successfully. The garden landscaping was done as you wanted.\u201d\u201cI will trust Ansgar.\u201dThe design was made by Artizea herself, and the manager was Ansgar.The purpose of the construction itself will not be hidden.However, she took the pieces and left the work be done little by little to prevent anyone from seeing the whole concept. It would not be possible to find the location of the new equipment.The landscaping had no problem as the gardener was brought in directly from Evron Grand Duchy.\u201cThe villas are also going to be renovated step by step.\u201d\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll leave it all to you.\u201dArtizea said softly. Hayley looked at her with a slightly surprised face.Although Artizea was generally gentle and generous to the people of the Grand Duchy, she never lowered her position or spoke humbly.Except for Cedric, he was only so gentle and respectful to Ansgar.\u2018It\u2019s not that he doesn\u2019t deserve such treatment, but\u2026\u2026\u2019Ansgar was Cedric\u2019s caretaker, one of the oldest and most reliable butlers, he was also a respectable person for all people in the Grand Duchy.However, Artizea was the one who would not easily open up to the maids who attended right by her side.This kind of kindness to Ansgar felt a little modest to Hayley\u2019s opinion.Well, if she thought about it, it\u2019s not like there wasn\u2019t a person like that at all. There were exceptions such as Lysia.Artizea looked at Freil this time.\u201cLet\u2019s talk about you, too.\u201dFreil took turns looking at Ansgar and Lysia for a moment. Hayley didn\u2019t know about it, but he didn\u2019t think Lysia was the right person to hear this story.However, since Artizea asked here, she must have decided that there is no reason to exclude a person.\u201cCountess Martha has opened a salon.\u201dHayley thought for a moment and then remembered who Countess Marta was.It was thanks to Artizea having her memorize the influential figures of the capital while on the way here.\u201cHer Majesty\u2019s lady-in-waiting, you mean?\u201d\u201cYes, Her Majesty gave space in the Empress\u2019 Palace.\u201dIt took the form of giving a space, but in fact there was no doubt that the salon was operating according to the Empress\u2019 will.\u201cIt\u2019s been more than three months since the Empress\u2019 palace was opened, but the only people Her Majesty has met during that time were the poor and old wives of those who didn\u2019t belong to any faction, except for young ladies who made their debut this year.\u201dFreil pulled out a list. Artizea, herself, confirmed it.There was no name to keep in mind. All of them were just people who were so insignificant that they could not belong to any faction somewhere.Even when Artizea thinks of the future, none of them has distinguished themselves.She could say that the Empress was in a very opposite direction of what she usually behaves.She opened the door of the Empress\u2019 palace and showed that she was alive and that she could meet people at any time, but she was actually living a life that is unresolved of anything.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She has all those who want to be close to Her Majesty gathering there.\u201dCountess Marta turned her salon into a thoroughly dignified cultural gathering. There was no political color at all.Scholars gathered to discuss, and poor poets visited to borrow ink and paper. A newly debuted young lady even recited a poem.There was no political color in the operation. It was to spread the taste of literature to the young ladies whose preference is in line with the hobby of their mistress, Countess Martha.These salons were usually for very small groups of friends only.Nevertheless, due to the prestige of the Empress\u2019 Palace, Countess Martha\u2019s salon quickly rose to fame.\u201cThe social circle must\u2019ve been divided into three parts.Artizea said quietly.The social gatherings that have so far divided the social world of the imperial capital have been the imperial banquet of Miraila\u2019s and the salon of Marchioness Camellia.Of course, the biggest power is Miraila\u2019s Imperial Banquet.Firstly, the Emperor was present. If the purpose, in itself, was to meet the Emperor and win his favor, receiving an invitation to this banquet was the fastest.However, this banquet was focused on prodigal play.On the other hand, the people who gathered at Marchioness Camellia\u2019s salon were great nobles.The most important information and the flow of money that controls the imperial economy casually went back and forth through small talk.It wasn\u2019t necessarily the people of the Roygar faction to go in and out of the salon.Those who want to touch the big money, those who want to gather investors with new ideas, and those who want to show their own talent and wisdom, all went to Marchioness Camellia\u2019s salon.It was also the pride of Marchioness Camellia. In her salon, strength and talent were as valuable as lineage and status.She prided herself in it being different from other gatherings where the chatter of the nobles who gathered together were about whom they would marry, and which property to send as a dowry.But now Countess Martha\u2019s salon has become a strong contender.Her salon, which featured literature, was different from that of Marchioness Camellia\u2019s.However, if the young and vibrant talents had gathered there, Marchioness Camellia\u2019s pride would have been hurt in many ways as she valued \u200b\u200bher reputation.\u201cMarchioness Camellia showed no reaction.\u201d\u201cIt would be ambiguous to respond. Since Countess Martha is Her Majesty\u2019s lady-in-waiting, Marchioness Camellia is not in a position to confront her.\u201dArtizea said to Freil, organizing the information she heard in her head.\u201cSince Her Majesty the Empress is not actively socializing, it is not so different from the reclusive situation that she has been living in, Countess Martha is not trying to exert her own influence through the salon.\u201d\u201cYes, it just feels like she really left the space open. Of course, even so, there are many people who come and go, they see it as almost the only window to communicate with Her Majesty.\u201d\u201cBrother Lawrence.\u201d\u201cYes. Thanks to this, a lot of young men and women gathered. There are many of Sir Lawrence\u2019s friends, many aristocrats from the influential family, and many of the marriage age ladies admiring Sir Lawrence.\u201dIt has become famous as a place where you can freely chat in a decent and cultured atmosphere, as no one plays prodigal play or commits hasty actions in the Empress\u2019 Palace.As young men and women gathered, the atmosphere in the salon naturally became bright. A ceramic brazier inlaid with gold reflects the light, and the jeweled harp gives off a brilliant light.\u201cIt looks like they\u2019re trying to embrace the ladies right now\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not something that can be done in a short time.\u201dArtizea was immersed in her thoughts. Not to disturb her, everyone bit their mouths.\u201cHow about mother?\u201d\u201cThe imperial palace holds banquets more often than before. Nowadays, it seems to be held almost once a week. His Majesty is spending enormous budgets to comfort the Dowager Marchioness of Marquisate Rosan.\u201dThe word Dowager Marchioness of Marquisate Rosan, was carefully pronounced by Freil.In front of Artizea, it was impossible to call her Miraila, and the title of the Dowager Marchioness of the Marquisate Rosan seemed to hint that the relationship with Artizea was not broken.Artizea did not respond to the title issue at all. Freil said quickly.\u201cBut when she actually goes to a banquet, I feel like the Dowager is trying to seduce His Majesty. Every time, the Dowager herself brings a new young woman into His Majesty\u2019s bedroom.\u201d\u201cRight.\u201dArtizea was a little surprised.She never thought that Miraila would even utilize a way that attracts other women.She wasn\u2019t expecting her to be immersed in the banquet.After settling down in Marquisate Rosan and getting older, she did not hold banquets that often. It was because her relationship with the Emperor was stable enough that she didn\u2019t have to, and she had the belief that her own position as herself would be strong enough.As Artizea knows, she also remembered the days when Miraila was dressed up and held a banquet every day.Although Artizea was very young, she didn\u2019t know what a banquet was, and didn\u2019t even understand the meaning behind it.However, she longed for her gorgeous mother because she was so pretty. Still, Artizea could vividly recall how enchanted she was when she had touched the hem of Miraila\u2019s sparkling skirt.[\u201cI\u2019m doing it all for you.\u201d]Miraila used to say that without thinking whether it was communicated properly.Little Artizea nodded her head hard. She believed that it was real, and it was partly true.She herself bought the Emperor\u2019s wrath only from her birth itself. She would have died before she could even begin to walk, if Miraila had not then, with all her might, recaptured the Emperor\u2019s heart.That wasn\u2019t what Miraila intentionally did for Artizea, but that doesn\u2019t mean that she\u2019s not survived because of it.Anyway, Miraila has gone back to that time.No, she considers her own position to be more dangerous than back then. Even so, she didn\u2019t even think that Miraila would attract other women to entertain the Emperor and win his favor with it.Miraila lost the Marquisate after the loss of Artizea and as she lost Lawrence, her position as the real wife of the Emperor was jeopardized.The only thing she can trust now is her own beauty and her position as a woman favored by the Emperor.And both of them are short-lived.Artizea asked.\u201cWhat about Brother Lawrence?\u201d\u201cHe has never attended the imperial banquet.\u201d\u201cHas he ever visited mother?\u201d\u201cNo. Rather, there have been a few occasions where the Dowager went to Sir Lawrence\u2019s house, but it wasn\u2019t a very good meeting. After returning, she drank and fell asleep all day, and she found the necromancer.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I see.\u201dAs Artizea was quietly immersed in her thoughts, Lysia cautiously called her.\u201cYour Grace.\u201dLysia had guessed that Artizea\u2019s heart must be broken because of her mother\u2019s terrible circumstances and her brother\u2019s cold attitude.But Artizea shook her head with a cold attitude.\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing.\u201d\u201cYour Grace\u2026.\u201d\u201cThere is no sign that His Majesty\u2019s favor will be taken from the Dowager.\u201dSaid Freil.\u201cIn fact, when the Dowager first began to attract other women, it is said that there were several dukes on the side of Marchioness Camellia.\u201dIt would be great to say if she could drive out Miraila and plant her own person in the place.Even if it wasn\u2019t, she would benefit from being able to share some of the favors poured out on Miraila.\u201cIt probably didn\u2019t work. His Majesty pities mother.\u201dCompassion is one of the most intense emotions that can be elicited from the Emperor.Pleasures and entertainment are for herself. For the Emperor, enjoyment was the same no matter who offered it.He can get his hand on any woman he wants and pleasure does not even need to be permitted.However, to be pitiful is targeting a specific other person.Even Miraila knows. No one can pick up the Emperor\u2019s heart as well as her. It was almost instinctive.But she will not be able to use the Emperor\u2019s compassion. To look pitiful to others was what she hated most.When Miraila becomes anxious, she dresses up gorgeously. Beauty was Miraila\u2019s pride, strength, and strongest weapon.The clothing is her armament. Whenever she felt shabby, she wore her jewels and put on her most gorgeous clothes. In order to not look ridiculous, she clenched her teeth and made the most gorgeous appearance.The Emperor considers it lovely and pitiful. No matter how much Miraila is dressed, in the end she is nothing in front of the Emperor.\u201cHis Majesty will probably continue to hold banquets and keep mother reigning like the queen because he knows how to relieve mother\u2019s anxiety.\u201dThere is nothing to worry about. Rather, the poorer Miraila is, the more likely the Emperor will hate Lawrence.And when it gets to that point, Miraila will become anxious again.\u2018The necromancer must have fueled her anxiety.\u2019Miraila needs someone to rely on. But superstition never really serves to calm the mind.Miraila knows that her own reign is nothing but a sand castle.She had an anxiety that if the castle collapsed, she would roll into the gutter that she had barely escaped. She also felt fear of getting avenged.And that anxiety became a concrete figure after meeting the necromancer.Mila was captured by the evil spirit she had created in her own mind. She will try as hard as she can if it means to be relieved even just a little.Because it wasn\u2019t her fault or wrongdoing, but because the evil spirit had cursed her, things are getting worse.Once she is obsessed with that thought, she can\u2019t get out. The anxiety and fear were created by Miraila herself.\u201cAnyway, let\u2019s watch. There is no need to rush.\u201d\u201cActually, I have something to tell you about that. It\u2019s a story of a scammer\u2026\u201dAs she was in the presence of other people, Freil turned to the door to say it.\u201cI see.\u201dArtizea cut his words, it seems like she knew the situation roughly even if she did not hear the details.Rye\u2019s story is not something to be said in front of others.Freil nodded his head.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

For the first time in a long time, she was going to serve Rye tea herself.\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time.\u201dRye took off his hat and bowed his head. And he said the first word.\u201cDid you gain some weight?\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dArtizea was stunned.Instead of responding to Rye, she looked at Freil. Freil raised a silent roar to Rye.Meeting Rye was not a priority.The role he was playing was very important. However, it was not an urgent matter that they had to meet as soon as she came to the capital.As it was, it was normal for Freil to report the situation, and for Artizea to go to see Rye after she finished her assessment.But Freil brought him to this place without prior permission.There was also a strong hope from Rye himself who wanted to meet Artizea, but Freil seemed to have a problem as well.So he decided to take a little risk and hurry to report it first.Rye also puffed his mouth. Artizea let out a sigh.\u201cA person, who does covert things, talks without having it go through his brain. I didn\u2019t know you had such a habit.\u201d\u201cNo. No, no. I\u2019m sorry, that\u2019s\u2026\u201dRye shook his hand violently.\u201cIt means you look better!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of pointing out the body shape. I didn\u2019t know that you had a habit of spitting out thoughtlessly. I should have given you poison, not gold coins.\u201dRye felt a cold sweat running through his back. She was more scary than the shouting and angry man.Artizea spoke to Freil this time.\u201cIt\u2019s quite something that you both survived.\u201d\u201cYour Grace, that\u2019s \u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cSir Freil is lax and has a habit of dropping things one at a time, and Rye can\u2019t go through the process of saying words with forethoughts, but both of you aren\u2019t dead.\u201dFreil felt wronged. It was Rye who made the mistake. Why does he have to be scolded for it?Rye was only silent. His words really did leak without going through his brain so he had nothing to say.It wasn\u2019t a lie that she had looked better. It was not with bad intentions, and he did not dare to eye Artizea.He just said it unintentionally, because he always thought it was a pity that she was too thin and her complexion was bad.Artizea sighed. Rye\u2019s chest sank down.What if he let her down? He was putting his family in his employer\u2019s hand.But that\u2019s all.\u201cSo, what\u2019s going on? Have you had a relationship with mother?\u201dRye\u2019s face rose brightly in an instant.\u201cWhat do you take me for? I\u2019m not a good guy, but I\u2019m not a guy who doesn\u2019t know what his mission is. I\u2019m not a douchebag who dared to touch the Emperor\u2019s woman!\u201d\u201cBut you must have been tempted?\u201dThen Rye bit all of his mouth.Freil, who had never heard such a story, looked at Rye in astonishment.Artizea had a nonchalant attitude, with an incredibly cold face while talking about her own mother with the mother\u2019s friend, who had been sent in secretly.Freil asked.\u201cYour Grace, is that why you said to pick a young man in advance and get ready to hide in a hurry just in case?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s how mother builds trust. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if that happened.\u201d\u201cNot me.\u201dLike a man insulted, Rye furiously swept his bangs.\u201cBut you must have been sympathetic to her, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cOf course. My mother has a passionate personality and high self-esteem, but she must have shown all of her very weakened inner side to you. Such a beautiful woman hangs with her weak inner self, the man who can think of it casually must be rare.\u201d\u201cMarchioness.\u201dRye twisted his face. But couldn\u2019t deny it.Artizea smiled a little.It is not known exactly what happened, but the state of Rye\u2019s psychology was a rough guess.Although Rye encountered a problem that he couldn\u2019t deal with alone, he couldn\u2019t consult with Freil.It is not really an urgent problem, but it is a matter of urgency. Besides, he wanted to see Artizea in person.The conclusions drawn from there were clear.\u201cI\u2019m not trying to rebuke you. I know you\u2019re not a person driven by temporary lust or impulse. You\u2019re moving with more real interests than that. That\u2019s why I chose you.\u201d\u201c\u2026..\u201d\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean that it is the movement of the mind that can\u2019t be helped. It is human nature for the mind to be weakened to an attractive opposite sex.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m ashamed of myself.\u201dRye finally confessed honestly.He was sincerely ashamed.It\u2019s not because he had compassion, knowing what kind of mother Miraila was to Artizea.It is because if it weren\u2019t for Miraila\u2019s current appearance to be a beautiful woman, he would have ridiculed her, let alone pity her.\u201cI want to get out of the way as soon as possible.\u201dSaid Rye.\u201cPractically speaking, the Dowager\u2019 trust has grown too deep. Because she even came out of the Emperor\u2019s bedroom and came to see me in a public place. If this keeps up, it will soon become dangerous.\u201d\u201cHow many requests have you received so far?\u201dRight now, Rye is Miraila\u2019s most trusted person. Even if he secretly went in and out of the Rosan mansion, it was not completely secret. Although they don\u2019t know who Rye himself is, many know that the necromancer who once ravaged the social world became the distinguished guest of Miraila.Although he thought he was an insignificant scammer, many requests poured in.He handed over the request that Freil had organized into paperwork.\u201cListen to the trivial matters. Don\u2019t touch anything that could be politically dangerous or too big, and try to get the money out as much as you can.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cEspecially, instead of accepting all kinds of proposals to disappear from my mother, ask for money. Ask the butler at the Rosan mansion for a large sum of money. Finally, it will be a bang and disappear.\u201d\u201cYou mean to be faithful to being a fraudster until the end.\u201d\u201cYes, and tell the truth before you leave.\u201d\u201cAbout being a scammer?\u201dRye widened his eyes. Artizea said.\u201cI\u2019ll tell you in detail later what to tell and in what way. Then, you can go into hiding.\u201d\u201cHowever \u2026..\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll handle it as missing, so you don\u2019t have to worry about mother retaliating.\u201dAt Artizea\u2019s words, Rye, nervously, clenched and opened his fist.\u201cAre you sure that\u2019ll do?\u201d\u201cYes, your role ends with that.\u201dArtizea said so. That\u2019s all the part Rye will take on in her idea.\u201cOnce the job is finished, it would be better to hide from the capital completely. Go to the east once.\u201d\u201cEast?\u201dRye was horrified how much she wanted him to disappear. Said Artizea.\u201cThere\u2019s one person I need you to find. Even if I give you a vacation, you wouldn\u2019t be able to go to your family in this situation, anyway?\u201d\u201cDamn, I want to, but\u2026.\u201d\u201cAfter looking for that person, make sure to visit your family at a leisurely time. You will know when it is safe when you look at thesituation in the capital city.\u201d\u201cCan I really do that?\u201d\u201cAfter this job, I\u2019m sure that money problem will really disappear, so it\u2019s okay to retire.\u201dAt Artizea\u2019s words, Rye had a slightly anxious face.\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cDo I get to keep all of that money?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the money you made with your abilities. Why? You want to share it with me?\u201d\u201cNo, not that.\u201dRye replied immediately. Then Artizea laughed.\u201cI\u2019m so anxious. I don\u2019t think Marchioness will let me go smoothly. I thought you\u2019d told me to retire and poison me on the way to my hometown.\u201d\u201cAll you have to do is hide yourself without returning to the capital again. Wasn\u2019t it your dream to live with your family?\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s what it is.\u201dRye scratched his head.\u201cIt feels a little bad being treated as a useless person already. You just came to me and went through my life.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a good way to get around your life. Are you just going to entrust the job to someone who works for money?\u201d\u201cDid you take my family hostage?\u201d\u201cThen, shall I kill them all and cover their mouths?\u201dRye has nothing to say.He didn\u2019t know exactly what Artizea was trying to do. He initially thought it was revenge against Miraila. But it wasn\u2019t just that, Rye knew now. Too many gears were moving to be counted as a revenge.He was caught up in an indescribable mood.Rye has always felt a stronger and more complex feeling to Artizea than the compassion he had for Miraila.Whether it was impulse, awe, or repulsion, it could not be clearly defined.Something boiled inside his chest. He was sad. It was also unclear to Rye himself what upset him. He knew he shouldn\u2019t feel it.He wanted to be used as a tool to the end of the dangerous things that this woman does. She\u2019s not a person with whom he fits her feet, but at best, like a little sword to wield.The person this woman is loyal to is Grand Duke Evron.Recalling that fact, Rye felt strange.\u201cIf you want to earn more, you can stay. If you want to retire, you can too.\u201dArtizea said, lifting the teacup. She looked down to hide her eyes.She didn\u2019t have to rule out Rye. He is a useful person.He had a record of betraying her, but back then the other person was already wearing the Emperor\u2019s crown.If he had his family as he is now, he didn\u2019t have to worry any more.Even if she doesn\u2019t retire Rye, she eventually has to replace the other parts.It is not common to have a substitute person, but why was she urging retirement?In the end, it is because of personal feelings.\u2018Because it would be nice to have a chance to live properly at least once.\u2019Artizea looked inside the teacup. There was no way that ugly pupils could reflect on something like a tea filled with milk, but it was like having a staring contest.\u201c\u2026.\u201dShe thought there would be a few more sarcasm, asking if the pension wasn\u2019t a reward originally given, but Rye paused for a while and said.\u201cThen, when the time comes, please give me instructions through Sir Freil.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dArtizea knew that he was troubled because she was quick-witted.Rye nodded and stepped out.As he pushed his feelings of frustration into his heart, Freil warned him as he followed him.\u201cDon\u2019t be silly, Rye.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201dBefore he even realized what Freil was talking about, Rye responded that way.Artizea is right. He wasn\u2019t interested in futile work. It was nothing more than an unclear feeling.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Being a lady-in-waiting of the Empress, it was a natural thing to do.The Empress\u2019 Palace had a slightly different atmosphere than before.There weren\u2019t any major changes physically. Even when the Empress made it the tomb of her life, the garden of the Empress\u2019 Palace was beautiful, and it is still so.But the atmosphere was quite different. This is because when Countess Martha\u2019s salon was opened, part of the garden was also open to salon guests.In the end, sprouts bloomed on the bare branches and the garden began to turn into a lighter color. The buds of magnolias formed in the early period seemed to be brighter than last year because they breathed the outside air.The Empress took Artizea and went out to the garden. It was for two purposes: to make a star of her and a show of who the Evron Grand Duchess first visited in the capital.Of course, the actual conversation couldn\u2019t be said to be a warm, affectionate one.\u201cIt\u2019s been a lot of fuss about the war at Evron Grand Duchy. Is it okay to come back alone like this?\u201dThe Empress\u2019 voice was hard and cold, not because she was worried about Evron Grand Duchy.To the Empress in the capital\u2019s imperial palace, the war in Evron Grand Duchy is nothing but a distant affair. She didn\u2019t think that even if they were defeated, the entire Evron Grand Duchy would be breached.Even if it is breached, then there is still the Elia wall. The possibility of the capital being threatened was slim.War is a very important issue for government and military personnel. However, it had nothing to do with the Empress.In fact, she did not care much even if the empire was in crisis after the Elia wall was penetrated.So what she asked is something as an investor. Not as an Empress.Artizea replied softly.\u201cBecause I\u2019m of little use in military matters. I decided that sitting on the stronghold and living with the people of the Evron Grand Duchy, was nothing more than wasting resources because they had one more person to protect.\u201d\u201cWell, your purpose wouldn\u2019t be to be a good Grand Duchess.\u201dThe Empress mumbled so, fiddling with the fox fur doll over her shoulder.Like a lifelike doll, the fox\u2019s face was reproduced almost exactly as it was, the shawl was very long. Even with the head on the nape of the Empress, it was so long that it hung on the back to her hips.She could use it as a shawl when she was cold, but today\u2019s weather wasn\u2019t cold enough to wear a fur shawl.The Empress touched the fox fur. The touch on her hand was wonderful. When she touched its ears, she felt as if she was touching a real fox or a dog.It was, of course, a genuine product from Evron Grand Duchy given by Artizea.Artizea\u2019s request for a walk also had the purpose of making it stand out.\u201cIs it true?\u201d\u201cIt is true that Karam has crossed the Thold Mountains and has a siege weapon. Probably His Majesty\u2019s spy has reported. Others will be busy checking the authenticity.\u201dArtizea replied leisurely. She had no lie, so there was nothing to manipulate or be bothered about.Evron Grand Duchy seemed quiet at first glance, but under the water it was very busy now. No less than one or two were trying to intercept or steal letters from employees.When Artizea came, she brought not a few letters to the employees and knights in the capital from those in the Evron Grand Duchy.She couldn\u2019t bring things like goods due to the heavy burden of the rush schedule, but she was able to bring letters.Artizea checked it all out without leaving any trace. This is because she was worried about secrets leaking out.It\u2019s good not to have any rumors about the Karam crop project or what Cadriol did.However, Karam did not simply pass through the Thold Gate, but crossed the mountain range to engage in raids and acquire siege weapons. The Grand Duchy employees were worried and didn\u2019t stop talking; it was something she couldn\u2019t stop with.\u201cI see.\u201dThe Empress replied, and she put her hands back, which she had been fiddling.People stood out over the garden in the warm sunshine.People might be wondering what kind of conversation they are having. But no one came near.\u201cAren\u2019t you anxious?\u201d\u201cAre you afraid Lord Cedric will lose?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe Empress glanced at Artizea.\u201cThe shield of the empire, the invincible general, is at the end still a human body. Since Cedric is at the front line, he might be at the vanguard and there might be an unexpected incident.\u201d\u201cIt is.\u201dArtizea muttered to herself.The Empress was right, but Artizea was strangely not worried.Is it because the current war situation is not actually an all-out war? Or is it because she knows he hasn\u2019t lost while confronting the enemy in a more difficult situation?Artizea said.\u201cBut if you tell him to stay behind and not do that, Lord Cedric is not a person who would listen to that. It\u2019s not just because of his youthful spirit or impulse, but Lord Cedric thinks it\u2019s his responsibility to do so.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cTo go to the vanguard, to protect his own people and subjects at the risk of his life, fulfilling his responsibilities without withdrawing from the battle, that\u2019s why Lord Cedric gained loyalty and gathered popularity, and that\u2019s what he wants to show to the people under his command. So I dare not to interrupt.\u201dAt Artizea\u2019s answer, the Empress walked away without answering anything.For a while, the two just walked in the sun. The cleanly cleared path was covered with warm soil.Artizea looked from half a step back to the side of the Empress. The Empress had a lonely expression.However, it soon disappeared.\u201cYou said you brought some of the ladies-in-waiting from Evron Grand Duchy?\u201d\u201cYes. I don\u2019t have anyone else I can trust in my family. I don\u2019t have any friends.\u201d\u201c\u2026..\u201dThe Empress gazed at the empty space for a moment.\u201cIf my daughter was alive, I would have attached you to her friend.\u201d\u201cIf the Princess had been alive, Your Majesty would not have dared let me tread on the grounds of the Imperial Palace.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, too.\u201dThe Empress smiled in vain.If the eldest daughter had been alive, the age difference would have been quite different with Artizea.And even if Artizea wasn\u2019t born the daughter of Miraila, it\u2019s unclear whether she would have decided to be loyal to the deceased princess.\u201cI\u2019ll bring my lady-in-waiting to see you soon. They don\u2019t have a high status, and they\u2019re not particularly witty, but they are good ladies with good behavior and good hearts, so Your Majesty will also think that they are lovely.\u201dArtizea politely said so.Lysia must have been able to comfort the Empress\u2019 heart. Lysia will treat her with pure heart, regardless of the benefits or things like that.\u201cThey would be reliable if they were the vassals of the Evron Grand Duchy. Unlike you.\u201dArtizea smiled.The Empress asked.\u201cNow that you\u2019ve been on your honeymoon, I think you can officially be active in the social world as the Grand Duchess of Evron. What are you going to do first?\u201dThe question is not about problems that they both already know about, such as tearing off supplies.It is not a matter of what Artizea needs to deal with personally, or about the affairs of the Grand Duchy, such as the issue of the coalition of grain merchants.The Empress asked how she would use the composition of the power she had laid out throughout the winter through Countess Martha\u2019s salon.Artizea replied softly.\u201cI\u2019d like to prepare for Your Majesty the Empress\u2019 birthday.\u201dThe Empress was not surprised. It was because she thought that is the reason why Artizea came back before March.Her birthday was around the end of March. If she prepares from now on, it will be tight, but not impossible.\u201cIt\u2019ll be my first birthday party in 18 years.\u201dThe Empress replied so.\u2014At that time, Lysia was in Countess Martha\u2019s salon.Artizea tried to separate from her as was going to the Empress\u2019 Palace. Lysia couldn\u2019t let that happen.Hayley went elsewhere on an errand, but she had no other job. So, of course, she had to do the basic practice as Artizea\u2019s lady-in-waiting.There is also something because Cedric told her not to leave Artizea\u2019s side.Maybe it was a half-formal statement, but Lysia was somehow worried about it.So she followed Artizea, but she was not allowed to see the Empress together.It is for her Mistress to see the Empress alone. There was nothing to regret if Artizea didn\u2019t take her.In fact, Lysia was a little relieved. She wasn\u2019t very confident in her court manners.The Empress\u2019 lady-in-waiting, Countess Marta, led Lysia to the salon. She then, herself, went right back to attend the Empress.Lysia is left with no one she knows in the salon.\u2018Uh\u2026.it\u2019s hard\u2026.\u2019Evron Grand Duchy\u2019s social circle meant gathering vassals to share greetings and make friendships with familiar peers.They danced and were introduced as newly appointed knights or officials, but they feel like a group of relatives or a group of friends rather than a social circle.It was the first time that there were only strangers like this.Besides, it was dazzling to see that there are only people who are so pretty and elegant. It was exciting, but it was difficult.A woman her age was playing the piano. There were several people standing and chatting together.One side enthusiastically discussed poetry. On the other side, they opened a large book and shared their impressions.It was noticeable that not all literary men or officials, but aristocrats were involved.Lysia thought she couldn\u2019t participate anywhere, she stood on the wall, and she looked at her dress for nothing.When she first got ready to go out, she wondered if it was too flashy to wear as a day dress. She had asked Sophie four times if she looked okay.But when she came here, it wasn\u2019t too flashy, it wasn\u2019t too simple, and just medium.\u2018I should say thank you to Sophie.\u2019As she decided so in her mind, she moved to the table where the refreshments were prepared.It was because it seemed to be better off eating than doing nothing.\u2018Oh, this is delicious!\u2019When she chewed a cookie, it tasted like a fragrant fruit that she had never eaten in her life.Would it be embarrassing to take one or two of these? But she also wanted Artizea to taste it.Wouldn\u2019t it be nice if she only took two and gave one to Artizea, and if she said it was delicious, she would leave the other one in the kitchen and ask them to make more?No, she has to take three. She has to give Sophie one as well.She sneaked out her handkerchief.\u201cExcuse me.\u201dA young man approached the table and looked at Lysia while trying to pick up a water pitcher.Lysia inadvertently glanced at him while attempting to wrap the cookies in her handkerchief. And she forgot to breathe without even knowing.The man had a fine line of beauty, like a statue of a boy god left in the garden.It was Lawrence.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 100": "Chapter 100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 100Proofreader: somniumLysia wasn\u2019t the only one who was distracted by the other party.The same was true of Lawrence.He came and went to this salon almost every day. None of the regular guests of the salon did not know this.He also researched and remembered all the people who came occasionally because he was wondering if it was someone who had a relationship with the Empress or other Empress\u2019 lady-in-waiting.But this bright blond girl was the first face he ever saw.It was the type he had never seen before.The appearance itself was not particularly outstanding.In fact, no matter how great you look, it was difficult to catch Lawrence\u2019s eyes.The most beautiful woman in the world was his mother. And he, himself, had a beautiful appearance that resembled his mother.However, Lysia, when seen up close, was well worth the attention of others.Usually, she wasn\u2019t the type to be interested in. Her outfit was refined, as if it was tailored in the dressing room of the capital.However, looking at her clueless attitude, she must have been a local aristocrat who made her first debut this year.But she had something more than that.Lawrence couldn\u2019t say exactly what it was. He did not notice from a distance.However, something like a sprout of light nestled inside Lysia, and each time her lively limbs moved, the surrounding air was colored with a different color.Such an aura is something that even Miraila doesn\u2019t have. Graceful movements and modest attitudes are something you can have with education, but your nature is different.No woman in the capital can imitate her.Lawrence felt a needle-like stabbing pain deep in his head.[\u201cI\u2019m not that kind of woman! Why can\u2019t you believe me? You confirmed it!\u201d][\u201cPlease, please! Your Majesty!\u201d]Screams and cries momentarily clamored in his ears and then disappeared.There was a sound of something twisting inside his chest.Lawrence hid his expression and lowered his gaze. Unrecognized hallucinations quickly disappeared.Only the remnants of strange stuffiness and headaches remained in his head.Thinking he was looking at her hand, Lysia blushed her face. She then hurriedly took her hand back.\u201cOh, so, this.\u201dLysia stuttered.She wanted to get into a mouse hole because she got caught in front of such an elegant looking and sophisticated man.\u2018Uh\u2026 I must have done no harm to Her Grace\u2019s honor, right?\u2019She was embarrassed.Lawrence\u2019s lips went down. Lysia was even more restless.\u201cIf you like the refreshments, you can tell the servant. If you are acquainted with Countess Martha, it would be better if you tell her directly.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cBecause there is no case of the host who dislikes guests who liked the prepared food, whether it is a salon, a banquet hall, or a dinner.\u201dAs he said so, Lawrence clicked his finger and called the servant. It was a familiar attitude like this is his own home.\u201cThe lady here seems to like the refreshments, so make sure she\u2019s not to be empty-handed when she returns.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe servant answered Lawrence politely. And the servant greeted Lysia as well and went back.Lysia couldn\u2019t hide her embarrassment, she said awkwardly.\u201cThank you for your kindness. It was my first time in this position, so I didn\u2019t know how to behave.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dLawrence was a little embarrassed, and he suddenly felt uncomfortable. He didn\u2019t know why he had become such a kind hearted person.And he thought this woman was stupid.Even if she was truly clumsy because it was her first time, it was foolish to tell others about it. This was because it became a weakness.If she was an aristocrat, it was natural for her to have perfect calmness and elegance on the outside, even if it was her first time entering the social world.However, even her frank attitude gave Lysia a sense of innocence. She\u2019s stupid, and, oddly enough, it didn\u2019t feel like it.He became uncomfortable facing her big, clear eyes, so Lawrence tried to turn his body away.It was rude, but it was the right thing. He wouldn\u2019t even have to greet her twice anyway.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dLysia spoke again.It was then.There was a sound of something falling behind his back.Lawrence looked behind him.\u201cOh.\u201dArtizea dropped the parasol and stared at him blankly.\u201cYour Grace.\u201dLysia bent her knees and politely greeted her.She approached Artizea and picked up the dropped parasol. It was only then that Artizea came to her senses.But she didn\u2019t look at Lysia and talked to Lawrence.\u201cBrother.\u201dArtizea was terribly anxious to see that he was talking to Lysia.She was, in fact, anxious since Lysia said she would follow her to the Empress\u2019 Palace. That\u2019s why she tried not to bring Lysia.Nevertheless, Artizea brought Lysia here because Lysia insisted that she must practice.Countess Martha\u2019s salon was the right place for Lysia to show her face out for the first time. In addition, as long as she was in the capital, she will be forced to meet Lawrence someday anyway.She believed it would be fine.Lysia was pretty, but it wasn\u2019t Lawrence\u2019s favorite type of beauty.The woman he liked was decadent, voluptuous, self-assertive and submissive. With no strong desire for power or a spirit of improvement.Lawrence was a character who could not tolerate even when one dared to open their eyes straight in front of him.It was the same even in terms of status. Something like a local Barony isn\u2019t a match in Lawrence\u2019s eyes.Lawrence would have no interest in the lady-in-waiting, until she was introduced.So even if they were in the same space, she thought they would never have a conversation.Artizea tried to pull herself together.Lawrence probably didn\u2019t think much differently after seeing Lysia.A little while ago, it seems like they had a conversation, but Lawrence was about to leave.Lawrence said.\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time.\u201d\u201cYes, how have you been?\u201d\u201cIf boredom was bad, it was bad. You must have been in trouble because something big happened during your honeymoon. Is Grand Duke Evron all right?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dArtizea replied briefly. Her heart was dizzy and her words didn\u2019t come out smoothly.Lawrence glanced at Lysia and asked.\u201cIs she your lady-in-waiting?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cI see. I thought I hadn\u2019t seen her before.\u201dIn general, it would be normal to introduce Lysia at this point. But Artizea didn\u2019t.Even if she doesn\u2019t introduce her here, Lawrence will soon know Lysia\u2019s identity.There is nothing wrong with saying that she is from Barony Morten, the vassal of Evron Grand Duchy. Such a thing is so public that it cannot even be called information.But she didn\u2019t want to say anything like introducing the two to each other with her own mouth.Looking back, Lysia bowed her head as if to apologize. Her cheeks were stained red.She didn\u2019t even think that the other person would be Lawrence. If she knew, she would have been more alert.This was Artizea\u2019s mistake.To the people of the capital, Miraila\u2019s appearance was well-known that it was common sense.Portraits and pictures were frequently published in newspapers, and many people saw their faces when riding in open-covered wagons, parades, or on the balcony of the Imperial Palace.At least the features of their appearance were known to everyone who could not even come near the imperial palace.Therefore, Artizea did not think of showing Miraila\u2019s portrait to Lysia to learn beforehand.When she encountered Miraila and Lawrence, she warned her to not talk as much as possible in a manner that wasn\u2019t contrary to proper etiquette.Seeing her with her head down, Artizea looked back at Lawrence.\u201cWould you like to take a walk?\u201dLawrence looked at Artizea with a slightly different eye.Until now, he had never walked or hung out with Artizea. He never thought of doing that. They weren\u2019t close enough to spend time together.However, it was an appropriate choice. This is because the salon\u2019s guests didn\u2019t seem to care about them, but they were listening carefully.He thought it would be better to meet up separately to have a conversation, or to go out to the garden.Lawrence reached out to Artizea. Artizea grabbed his arm and took the parasol from Lysia\u2019s hand.\u201cYou stay here. Soon, Countess Martha will be back.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dLysia stepped back.The two slowly stepped out of the salon.The sunlight was warm.There were a few more people taking a walk. It was because the Empress sometimes took a walk in the garden. People were looking forward to an encounter with her.Lawrence was one of them.Taking a walk in the garden in broad daylight was boring, but he had to do that at least to get his presence known.However, no one actually said that they had a conversation with the Empress in the garden or even met her. This is because the escorts and attendants thoroughly removed people from the area around the Empress\u2019 traffic line.\u201cI\u2019m glad you came back.\u201dLawrence said so a little sincerely.\u201cIt seems like it wasn\u2019t easy to ingratiate yourself to Her Majesty?\u201dSaid Artizea.As she moved away from Lysia, she felt a little more at ease. Her composure also returned to her voice.Lawrence replied.\u201cI thought it wouldn\u2019t be easy, but it\u2019s more tricky than I thought. Secondly, it\u2019s hard to see Her Majesty, and even the ladies-in-waiting have heavy mouths and firm guards.\u201d\u201cEven though the Empress\u2019 Palace has been erecting a high wall, they are the people who have served Her Majesty without expecting anything. It would be difficult to seek cooperation with a lot of reward.\u201d\u201cI see, no one seems to think for themselves, rather for their mistress.\u201dArtizea smiled.That is Lawrence\u2019s self-centered thinking. Objectively speaking, for the Empress, Lawrence was nothing better than Grand Duke Roygar just because Lawrence was in the position to become Emperor.The Empress herself had no desire to remain an Empress. In addition, the deeper she was involved in the political conflict, the higher the probability that her life would be in jeopardy.\u201cYou had a pretty good reputation in a short period of time. I heard you got all your girlfriend\u2019s mess in order, right?\u201dSaid Artizea. Lawrence saved his breath for a moment.\u201cThere is no need to refute because I\u2019m your younger sibling. Without that much information, I can\u2019t be a Grand Duchess in social circles.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201d\u201cI heard you moved out of Baroness Andeman\u2019s house and entered the mansion in Sabellin Estate? It must be too small for you to use, Brother.\u201d\u201cSince the salon was opened, I thought that rumors of this and that in the social world would go into the ears of the Empress.\u201dSo, he put himself in order first.He cleared up all the relationships with women, and broke the relationship with Baroness Andeman, his favorite partner. It was because he knew that the Empress was sensitive to infidelity.He called in friends because the ladies-in-waiting seldomly opened their hearts.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
