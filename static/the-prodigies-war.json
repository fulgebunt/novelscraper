This land had been known as the 'three thousand great mountains at heaven's border' since ancient times.The setting sun bathed the land with a gentle, rosy afterglow.In the far distance, trails of smoke rose in the air.Lin Xun's eyes brightened. He wiped the sweat on his forehead and released a long, drawn out breath, \u201cFinally found a place with people\u2026\u201dHe had been trekking through this inhospitable land for seven days, camping out in the open and foraging fruits for food. He had experienced numerous dangers and challenges along the way, even nearly losing his life to wild beasts several times.When Lin Xun finally discovered a sign of life, his heart shook and he felt a surge of energy through his exhausted body.He continued to advance.Before long, a neat and orderly Aeth field appeared, further adding to Lin Xun's hopes. Since a field was being cultivated here, there was most likely a village nearby.The Aeth grains in the field were clearly about to ripen, each kernel round and heavy. A gust of wind blew past, making the green field ripple like water as the light scent of vegetation spread.\u201cJudging from their condition, the grains should be ready for harvest in about ten days...eh? What's this?\u201dLin Xun seemed to have discovered something. He walked towards a stalk by the roadside and took a closer look. Sure enough, he found that although the plant was growing well, there was a problem.The ground was moist, fertile, and not lacking in Aeth power. However, the Aeth grain stems showed faint signs of wilting that were not easy to observe unless one looked carefully.Lin Xun pulled out a stalk and inspected it up close in his hand. His fingertip gently peeled open the tender green surface, only for his pupils to shrink a moment later at what he saw.<sub>The latest_epi_sodes are on_the elworld.com website.</sub>Numerous luminescent white worms could be seen inside the stalk, each as large as a grain of sand. They wiggled in the plant, feeding on its life force.Grain worms!This field was plagued by worms.If these grain worms weren't eliminated in time, the about to ripen field would begin to wilt and lose its Aeth power. When that happened, the harvest would be a disaster. In a worst case scenario, not a single grain would be reaped.\u201cIt seems that there is no rune master in the village. If not, such a disaster would not have been allowed to befall the nearly ripe Aeth grains.\u201dLin Xun pondered before silently shaking his head. There was likely no rune master who would willingly live in such a godforsaken place.After all, from what Lin Xun understood, a rune master was a very honorable profession in this world.Lin Xun suddenly heard a loud sigh.He turned his head to the source and saw a tall, well-built, middle-aged man nearby dressed in clothes made from animal skins. He was currently sitting by the edge of the field, dazedly staring at it as he sighed.The middle-aged tanned man had a worried frown on his face, and he was clearly distressed.Something clicked in Lin Xun's head. He walked forward and asked, \u201cUncle, are you fretting over this field?\u201dIt seemed that the man had been stressing over this matter for a long time. As such, he immediately complained, \u201cArgh, yeah. The wretched heavens! It's been a month since the last rainfall. If this weather continues, the twenty ares of Aeth grains I planted will be finished.\u201dHowever, when he turned around to look at Lin Xun, he blurted out in shock, \u201cLittle fellow, where did you come from?\u201dThe middle-aged man looked at the boy in front of him. Lin Xun was wearing a coarse hemp garment that had been washed until it had turned a faded-white, while his face had a slightly pale and sickly complexion.There was an old and worn wooden box on his back. The middle-aged man did not know what was in the box, but its load seemed to place a considerable burden on the boy.<sub>New novel_chap_ters are published here: elworld.com</sub>The youth looked like he was somewhere between twelve and thirteen years of age.It was honestly quite strange for a boy like this to suddenly arrive in Feiyun Village.After all, there was nothing but wilderness in a thousand miles radius around Feiyun Village. Everywhere else was rugged mountains with zero signs of human inhabitation.From what the middle-aged man could remember, not a single stranger had come to the village in more than ten years.As such, how could he not be baffled by the appearance of such a young and frail boy in his field?Lin Xun smiled, \u201cUncle, who I am isn't important. What's important is that I can help you solve your problem.\u201dHe knew that introducing himself would only draw more questions from the other party, wasting far too much time. Moreover, he was so hungry that he could barely walk.The middle-aged man jumped to his feet and said, \u201cWhat did you say?\u201dLin Xun smiled again and repeated himself, \u201cI said that I could help you solve this problem and make your subsequent harvest successful.\u201dThe middle-aged man in beast-skin-clothes frowned. He carefully observed Lin Xun's young, pale and gaunt face as he suspiciously asked, \u201cYoung man, you're bragging, right?\u201dThe words from the frail and thin youngster were far too absurd.Lin Xun chuckled and pointed towards the stalk in his hand that had been peeled open earlier. \u201cTake a look, uncle, your Aeth grains do not lack water but have been infected by worms. These worms are called grain worms and feed on the stalk of Aeth grains. If they are not exterminated in time, your field will be ruined.\u201dThese words alarmed and frightened the middle-aged man. He stared hard at the faintly glowing white worms and ground his teeth in anger. \u201cDamnit, no wonder nothing changed after using so much river water. These darn worms were the culprit! But\u2026\u201dHis expression turned distressed as he tore his hair in frustration. \u201cThese pests are hiding inside the stem. I don't have any method to kill them.\u201dLin Xun's eyes narrowed as he revealed a smile that was as bright as sunlight.<sub>Foll_ow new_episo_des on the elworld.com platform.</sub>The middle-aged man bitterly sighed for a long time. Suddenly, his eyes widened as he seemed to realize something and called out, \u201cYoung brother, since you recognize these pests, you must know a method to get rid of them, right?\u201dLin Xun nodded, his eyes gleaming with a sliver of confidence.\u201cThat's great!\u201d The middle-aged man's face flushed red with excitement. His initial suspicions towards Lin Xun had faded substantially.Upon seeing that the middle-aged man was now onboard, Lin Xun took his chance. \u201cUncle, if I help you with this problem, could you promise me one thing?\u201dThe middle-aged man immediately replied without any hesitation, \u201cAs long as you help me with this matter, I can make you ten promises, let alone one!\u201d However, he abruptly realized his words were too boastful and hurriedly corrected himself in a slightly embarrassed manner, \u201cOf course, I'll only be able to help if it is within my means. There's nothing I can do if the request is beyond me.\u201dLin Xun grinned, \u201cMy condition is simple. I wish to find a place to stay in the village.\u201dTie Shan was startled. \u201cYou wish to live in Feiyun Village?\u201dLin Xun nodded; his clear gaze indicating that he was not joking. His expression was completely serious when he needed to be, which was a habit he had acquired since he was young.Tie Shan hesitated as he awkwardly scratched his head. \u201cWait here, I'll go find the village chief and ask him. This matter is not something I can decide on but I feel that it should not be an issue.\u201dHe turned around and dashed towards the village without even waiting for a reply, giving off an aura of bubbling energy, swiftness and decisiveness.Lin Xun was speechless. He soon thought of another problem and hurriedly yelled, \u201cUncle, remember to bring back some food as well. I can't help if I have no energy!\u201d\u201cSure!\u201d Tie Shan's voice boomed from far away.\u201cWhat a simple and honest man.\u201d Lin Xun chuckled. He placed the tattered wooden box on the ground and massaged his aching shoulders. Subsequently, he turned around, walked into the field and began a careful inspection.Aeth grain contained wisps of Aeth power and was a necessary food for cultivation. However, it was not an easy task to grow them.From the moment they were planted, one needed to constantly check for insect infestations and weeds, while also being on guard for potential weather issues. Once any problems occurred, the grain's quality would drop and might even result in a complete loss of Aeth power.<sub>Visit to elworld.com discover_new novels.</sub>This field, for eNovel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",

They were filled with excitement and curiosity.Lin Xun glanced through the group before focusing on the elder leading them. The old man had white hair and a white beard. Although he was thin, he had a tall and sturdy figure and each movement he made gave off a certain feeling of power.\u201cEh!\u201dThe tall elder came to an abrupt halt when he saw Lin Xun standing in the distance. The look of excitement on his face was quickly replaced by bewilderment. He had not expected the frail-looking boy in the distance to be the 'master' mentioned by Tie Shan.\u201cWhere's the master? Tie Shan, where's the master you were talking about? Why is there only a young brat here?\u201d Skeptical looks appeared on the villagers' faces when they saw Lin Xun.Tie Shan was caught in an awkward spot and hurriedly said, \u201cEveryone, the master is this young fellow!\u201dIt might have been better if he had not explained because an uproar immediately erupted.\u201cWhat? You mean this beardless kid can help you achieve a good harvest? What nonsense!\u201d\u201cHaha. Tie Shan, ah, Tie Shan, you've clearly been tricked by this cheeky brat. How can a twelve year old kid be a master?\u201d\u201cTie Shan, we're facing a crisis. How are you still in the mood to joke around?\u201d<sub>This_content is taken from elworld.com</sub>Some of the villagers were unhappy, while others let out mocking remarks. Some other people were full of doubts and another subset were just angry. It was basically a mess. Everyone was certain that Tie Shan had been tricked.After all, Lin Xun looked far too young which was not helped by his gaunt and sickly pale face. It was difficult for the villagers to match this image to a 'master'.Tie Shan was flustered. He awkwardly waved his arms as he hopped about, \u201cI didn't lie. We'll know whether this young man can help once he tries!\u201dUnfortunately, everyone felt that they had been tricked and had no intention of listening to his explanation.Amidst the chaos, Lin Xun ignored the various looks and walked towards the tall elder. \u201cIf my guess is correct, you are the village chief of Feiyun Village.\u201d\u201cYou're right.\u201d The tall elder nodded. His wise eyes observed Lin Xun without revealing any emotions. The old man was clearly not someone who would be easily flustered.Lin Xun asked, \u201cThen will you agree to my condition?\u201dThe tall elder could sense that although the boy seemed young and immature, he had a confident and stable demeanor that did not match his age.This observation made the old man's heart stir. He nodded, \u201cIf you can accomplish what you promised, I will let you stay in Feiyun Village.\u201dSeveral of the nearby villagers were stunned by these words. Soon after, they skeptically cried out one after another, \u201cVillage Chief, you can't be seriously taking this little guy for real, right?\u201dThe tall old man displayed a charisma befitting of a village chief as he waved his hand, \u201cIn this world, how will we know if we never try?\u201dLin Xun chuckled, knowing that the matter was settled. He turned around and spoke to Tie Shan, \u201cUncle, did you remember to bring me some food?\u201dTie Shan hastily retrieved a big piece of dried meat and handed it over. In addition, he had also prepared a leather bag filled to the brim with water.<sub>The most up-to-date nov_els are published_here > elworld.com</sub>Lin Xun did not waste any more time and began to ravenously dig in right next to the field. Although the meat did not contain much Aeth power, the seasoning made it pretty tasty.The villagers could not help but laugh at Lin Xun devouring the food like a half-starved wolf as they grew increasingly doubtful. Could this little fellow be a food scamming conman?Even Tie Shan could not help but feel dazed as a feeling of apprehension rose in his heart. If Lin Xun was a conman, Tie Shan would have made a humiliating mistake.Only the tall old man watched Lin Xun with kind eyes and a sliver of surprise. If this little fellow wasn't a fearless conman, it would mean that he was the real deal.Regardless of which he was, such a display of composure and confidence was already more than sufficient proof of his boldness.Lin Xun soon consumed the entire piece of meat, washing it all down till his stomach was also full of water. He felt better than he had in days.Tie Shan could not help but inquire, \u201cYoung brother, shouldn't you begin?\u201dLin Xun looked at the sky and casually replied, \u201cWait a bit.\u201dTime flowed as night began to surge from the horizon.Just as the crowd was growing impatient, the silent Lin Xun finally moved. He opened the old wooden box by his feet and retrieved an azure blade with seasoned movements before walking into the field. The blade was nearly three feet long and three fingers wide.The tall elder's eyes instantly narrowed. He could faintly sense a familiar presence from Lin Xun. The boy's confidence, concentration and calm were clearly different from the norm and this began to tug out some vague memories buried deep in the old man's mind that had nearly been forgotten.The tall elder immediately waved his hand to quiet the grumbling villagers. \u201cStop being noisy and wait.\u201dHis voice contained a hint of authority.<sub>The latest_epi_sodes are on_the elworld.com website.</sub>All chatter instantly disappeared. Everyone looked towards Lin Xun with a tinge of skepticism in their eyes.Although they were now forbidden to speak, the villagers could still sign to each other with their eyes. They silently fanned out around the field to deny Lin Xun any opportunity of escaping.Lin Xun seemed oblivious to the slight change in atmosphere around him as he retrieved a thumb-sized broken golden bone that resembled a fang from his clothing.His right hand tightly gripped the handle and he exerted force through his wrist, causing a sharp scraping sound as the blade pushed across the broken golden bone.Faint golden powder drifted from the bone and landed on Lin Xun's ready palm. When his hand was covered in a thick layer of gold, he finally stopped and put away the broken golden bone.He took a deep breath and squatted on the ground. He then dabbed his finger on the golden powder and began to draw on the wet ground.At this distance, the villagers could clearly see everything he was doing.Lin Xun's young and slightly pale face was completely focused. His gaze was clear and calm as his finger left numerous complex strokes on the ground as if it was a calligraphy brush. His movements were natural and practiced, flowing with a natural grace akin to clouds floating through the air and water streaming across the ground.These villagers' eyes widened, and they didn't dare to blink as they watched Lin Xun's movements. Astonishment rose in their hearts when they saw faint golden symbols seeming to flow out of the ground. These symbols gave off a mysterious aura.Even the stupidest among them understood that Lin Xun was doing something that had completely surpassed their imaginations.The combination of Lin Xun's absorbed expression, his clean, proficient movements, and the rapidly growing golden pattern on the ground seemed to bathe him in a mysterious glow.The suspicions in villagers' hearts had imperceptibly vanished. Many of them were now convinced by the methods Lin Xun displayed.They might not have understood exactly what he was doing, but it did not stop them from being amazed by the beauty of his work.<sub>New_chap_ters are pub_lished on elworld.com</sub>The tall elder's body shuddered unnoticeably as he had finally confirmed his suspicions\u2014this frail-looking young boy was drawing a rune!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

His clothes were simple and shabby, an image that could never relate to the legendary rune masters.Xiao Tianren took a deep breath to compose himself and continued to observe.He suddenly felt an irresistible curiosity towards Lin Xun, who was attentively working with practiced movements. Where had this stranger come from? Would he really be able to solve the worm infestation?Amidst the silent atmosphere, Lin Xun was bent over in the field as his finger continued to nimbly draw complex patterns on the wet and rich soil.His movements were akin to a dancing snake while also bold and unrestrained like a heavenly steed galloping in the sky.The villagers could not turn their eyes away. The doubt in their hearts gradually faded as a wisp of unexplainable expectation rose within them.Twilight passed and was replaced by the ink-black night. Bright stars emerged one after another, sprinkling their gentle glow onto the land. The cold moon hung in the sky like a silver saucer with silver moonlight spilling onto the ground.Lin Xun's finger suddenly paused before he added one final light stroke to the mysterious pattern on the ground.<sub>Updated_at elworld.com</sub>Ohmmm~The pattern made from golden powder abruptly lit up as if it had come alive. A beam of golden light shot straight towards the sky!The villagers' hearts shuddered and their pupils rapidly expanded as if they were mesmerized. All of their eyes were glued on the golden light that was soaring into the heavens.Amidst the darkness of the night, strands of dazzling silver moonlight began to surge down like the tide as if something was beckoning it. The moonlight pooled together at the end of the golden ray.More and more moonlight gathered, swirling in the sky like rippling water. The ethereal and holy beauty of the sight instantly took the villagers' breaths away.As people who had spent all their lives in Feiyun Village, how could they possibly have experienced such magic?It was basically a miracle to them!Rumble!When the moonlight accumulated to a certain point, it suddenly fell with a loud rumble as if unable to bear its own weight.Hshhhh~Moonlight poured down like a heavy rain, glowing with holy light as it followed the beam of golden light and descended upon the worm infested field.The entire field was instantly enveloped by a layer of ethereal silver light, creating an exceptionally beautiful sight amidst the ink-like darkness of the night.Under the moonlight, the frail boy in the field seemed to gain a mysterious aura that garnered everyone's respect.The entire place was silent; the villagers were dumbstruck with their eyes and mouths wide open.Even Village Chief Xiao Tianren was no exception as his eyes were filled with amazement.However, Lin Xun's attention was not on them. After completing the task, he inwardly breathed a sigh of relief, his eyes finally relaxing as if a heavy burden had been lifted from his shoulders. He wiped his sweat covered forehead and carefully exited the field.<sub>Try the elworld.com platform_for the most advanced_reading experience.</sub>He had done what he could. All that was left was to see the result.\u201cYoung man, you are quite something.\u201d Village Chief Xiao Tianren had appeared beside Lin Xun without him noticing. The old man's eyes were filled with an unspoken emotion.Lin Xun chuckled, \u201cElder's praise is misplaced. I merely used a Gold Eating Rat's essence bone powder to draw an elementary tier Light Drawing Rune. It's honestly not even worth mentioning.\u201dXiao Tianren was slightly surprised by Lin Xun's honesty as a sliver of undetectable admiration flashed in his eyes. Soon after, the elder nodded. \u201cLet's go.\u201dLin Xun was taken aback. \u201cWhere to?\u201dXiao Tianran responded, \u201cTo find you some accommodation of course. From today, Feiyun Village is your home and you may stay however long you wish.\u201dAs he spoke, he turned around and began to leave with his hands behind his back, ignoring the changes that were happening to the field.This stunned Lin Xun. The elder had made the decision to accept him before waiting for this worm infestation affair to be settled. This honestly surprised Lin Xun.He smiled helplessly before quickly following without hesitation.Feiyun Village was built along a mountain and appeared quiet and peaceful under the moon's glow.Xiao Tianren led Lin Xun to the end of the village where a rundown little residence sat.The place consisted of three thatched buildings and a courtyard. A willow stood at the center of the courtyard and was surrounded by a garden that was currently filled with weeds.The thatched houses had clearly been in disrepair for many years as they were covered in cobwebs and dust.Creak~Xiao Tianren pushed open the door and lit an oil lamp. Tangerine yellow light soon illuminated the dark room.<sub>Try the elworld.com platform_for the most advanced_reading experience.</sub>\u201cIt has been many years since someone last lived here. You may stay here for the time being. I will get some people to help you tidy up tomorrow.\u201dLin Xun observed the room. Although simple, it had everything that was needed, like a bed, chairs and tables. In fact, there was even a study desk by the window, on which a few dust-covered books were scattered around.Lin Xun cupped his hands together, \u201cThank you, elder, this place is great.\u201d\u201cNo need to be courteous.\u201d Xiao Tianren looked at Lin Xun and said, \u201cYoung man, it matters not where you came from or why you wish to stay in Feiyun Village. Since you've become part of the village, you are naturally no longer an outsider. I hope that you will not do anything that will let the village down.\u201dLin Xun smiled and nodded, \u201cElder does not need to worry.\u201dXiao Tianren patted Lin Xun's shoulder, turned around and left.After making sure that Xiao Tianren had left, Lin Xun carefully placed the old and worn wooden box on the floor, resting it against the bed. He then pushed open the windows and dazedly gazed at the endless starry sky.Lin Xun finally could not resist the urge to stretch his back and yawn after a long time. \u201cI've finally arrived at the Ziyao Empire's border after three difficult months of trekking...Mister Lu, if your spirit is here, please be at ease. I will do my best to live on like you wished\u2026\u201dThe thirteen year old youth in coarse hemp clothes leaned against the windowsill; his long hair was loosely tied in a ponytail behind him. Moonlight bathed his thin frame as sorrow flashed across his young and slightly pale face before quickly returning to its usual composed look.Outside the village, the sounds of cheering mixed with gasps of surprise could be heard in the distance.Lin Xun listened as a smile involuntarily rose from the corners of his lips.He decided not to waste any more time and closed the window before returning to the bed. Under the dim lamp light, he opened the old and worn wooden box that had accompanied him for more than ten years.Meanwhile, Tie Shan was squatting in his field. His face was overflowing with excitement and happiness. His lips trembled as he muttered to himself, \u201cA miracle! It's a miracle! Those blasted worms are finally gone. God damnit, the heavens are watching after all!\u201dOne of the villagers reminded him, \u201cOld Tie, it's not the heavens but that young fellow's work!\u201d\u201cRight!\u201d Tie Shan slapped his thighs and loudly exclaimed, \u201cDidn't I say that he would never trick anyone? But you guys kept suspecting him of being a conman. You guys were so blind and muddle-headed!\u201dThe nearby crowd of villagers felt too embarrassed to speak.<sub>This_content is taken from elworld.com</sub>How could they have imagined that such a frail, shabbily-dressed thirteen year old youngster would be able to draw the moon's light to exterminate the worm infestation?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 4": "Chapter 4\nJun 11, 2022Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 4: Mine PrisonDusky yellow lamp light swayed in the simple straw house. The old wooden box was opened, revealing an azure blade, a yellowing book and a dark gray half-foot-long brush.Usually, a brush was a tool for drawing and writing.This brush resembled a calligraphy brush but had a sharp blade in place of the usual soft hairs. It was a necessary tool used by rune masters to carve runes.Hence, this brush was also known as a rune knife.Personally, Lin Xun preferred the name rune knife because it sounded similar to dao seeking. Who could vie with someone who sought the dao in every land?[1]This kind of name elicited an indescribable feeling of excitement.Lin Xun's gaze lingered on the yellowing book and the dark gray brush. These two items held extraordinary significance to him.The yellowing book was roughly three-fingers-thick and did not have a title. Its tattered pages were cut from leather and the book had clearly been made long ago. A mere glance at it would make anyone feel an ancient and historical aura.The dark gray brush was quite unique and resembled a sword more than a brush. Mysterious cloud-like patterns were etched into its dark, dull surface and its bladed tip gave off a chilling aura that reached all the way into the depths of a person's soul.They were Lin Xun's two most important treasures.Besides the book, brush and blade, there were also bones, animal skins, dried plants, rocks and other similar items. These were aeth resources that could be crafted into special tools, made into rune ink, or used as rune materials.They had been collected by Lin Xun along his journey and could be sold for quite a tidy sum.In the corner of the wooden box sat a stack of thumb-sized wooden blocks that were as solid and hard as jade.These wooden blocks were called clubmoss silver wood and normally had little value. Their only unique quality was that they were extremely tough and as hard as rocks.As such, clubmoss silver wood was an ideal material for rune apprentices to practice their rune carving.<sub>This_content is taken from elworld.com</sub>Lin Xun carefully picked up the thick yellowing book and sat in front of the desk by the window.He silently gazed at the book but did not flip it open. Instead, he fell into deep thought.In the blink of an eye, Lin Xun seemed to return to the past.He recalled a mine prison full of prisoners that was isolated from the rest of the world in the mountains.Lin Xun had been in the prison for as long as he could remember. It was a place without sky or sunlight, only darkness and dampness.The atmosphere was suffocating with prisoners dying and new ones arriving every day.In Lin Xun's memory, no one had ever managed to escape from the mine prison before it was destroyed.Strictly speaking, Lin Xun was not a prisoner but an orphan, who had nearly been eaten by the fiendish prisoners when he was found.That was what Mister Lu had told him anyway.As for how an abandoned baby had survived, he had, of course, been saved by Mister Lu.No one knew Mister Lu's origins, but he had clearly received special treatment in the mine prison. Not only the guards, but even the prisoners were also extremely respectful towards him.It was all due to Mister Lu's other identity\u2014a rune master.Lin Xun had followed at Mister Lu's side since young and had subsequently begun to help the latter with various chores once he was old enough.He became proficient at recognizing words and identifying various ingredients. In addition, he learned how to manufacture rune ink, practiced his rune carving and committed various types of runes to heart. He did all of this while also doing other mundane chores, such as preparing tea, serving water, washing clothes and cooking.Lin Xun had believed that he was Mister Lu's disciple, a sentiment shared also by the guards and prisoners in the prison mine.<sub>New_chap_ters are pub_lished on elworld.com</sub>However, Mister Lu had never acknowledged Lin Xun as his disciple. In Mister Lu's words, he did not plan on ever accepting a disciple, and Lin Xun was merely someone who was helping out with the chores.This statement had once made Lin Xun depressed for a bit, but the bad memory gradually faded with time. However, deep inside, he still treated Mister Lu as his master.Life in the mine prison was very dry and monotonous with no sun to herald the arrival of each day. As Lin Xun grew older, he slowly began to realize that there was a wider world outside.When Lin Xun was nine, Mister Lu brought him outside for the very first time.However, they returned a mere three days later.The experiences over these three days shocked Lin Xun tremendously. He had seen the outside world, sunlight, the blue sky and the clean white clouds.From then on, Mister Lu would take him out from time to time, though they would always return to mine prison within three to ten days.Their goal for each trip was simple. Mister Lu needed to collect more aeth resources for his runes.Every trip gradually increased Lin Xun's understanding of the world.The only thing that puzzled him was that Mister Lu seemed to prefer to stay in the dark, sunless mine prison instead of the outside world.Regrettably, Lin Xun was never able to find the answer to that question.Even when the mine prison was destroyed...At this thought, pain shot through Lin Xun's heart as the terrible memory from three months ago involuntarily filled his head\u2014On that day, he had been engaging in Green Wood Rune carving practice, while Mister Lu was mumbling to himself as he watched over a pot of boiling aeth ingredients.Outside the room, the guards whipped the less 'motivated' prisoners with their bloody metal whips while a cacophony of curses, shouts and wails of agony echoed amidst the dark prison.This day was no different from any other, and it was a life which Lin Xun had already long grown accustomed to. In fact, he no longer felt any sympathy for those pitiful-looking but inwardly evil prisoners.<sub>New novel_chap_ters are published here: elworld.com</sub>The only strange thing about that day was Mister Lu.Since young, Lin Xun had learned that Mister Lu had a bad temper, often appearing irritable and impatient. Lin Xun had been verbally abused countless times by Mister Lu and had long grown used to such treatment.Although Mister Lu would scold and reprimand, he never hit Lin Xun. Moreover, the lectures were always due to Lin Xun's mistakes.On that day, Mister Lu had been exceptionally irritable and had smashed numerous items in the room. Even his most beloved rune brush, Azure Sky Burning Gold, had been violently snapped into two by him.While Lin Xun was bewildered by such behaviour, he saw Mister Lu retrieve an old wooden box and furiously throw in a yellowing book, an azure blade and a dark, dull half-foot-long rune brush, before handing the box over to the stunned Lin Xun.Even today, Lin Xun could still remember Mister Lu's complicated expression\u2014conflicted, hatred, helplessness and an unwillingness to accept something. However, it ultimately turned into a solemn seriousness.Lin Xun had never seen such intensity before and knew he would never forget this sight for as long as he lived.Mister Lu then tightly grasped Lin Xun's shoulders, making him feel as if his bones were about to be crushed, and said, \u201cFrom today, you shall learn how to be independent. Hence, you must make sure that you live on!\u201dMister Lu's hoarse voice overflowed with an unshakable determination.

I can tell you that the answer lies in the Ziyao Empire! So live on and search for the answer! Don't ever forget!\u201d Mister Lu's voice turned hysterical; his expression warped and distorted. Overwhelmed, Lin Xun could only instinctively nod his head.Mister Lu grabbed Lin Xun's frail body, violently dragging him to a dark, concealed passageway that he had never seen before. \u201cGo!\u201dThe dark passageway was akin to a bottomless abyss. Mister Lu pushed Lin Xun in without any hesitation.Lin Xun was unable to even react; his mind turning blank as he felt as if he was falling from a cliff.It was also in that instant that he saw an ancient hand tear apart the darkness of the mine prison, accompanied by a loud rumbling as it descended.The hand was so enormous that it could cover the sky, every finger akin to a pillar supporting the heavens and each groove akin to a deep gorge. The hand was surrounded by terrifying purple flames and resembled a purple sea of fire pouring down from outer space. It was filled with dreadful destructive power that could incinerate darkness itself and burn the skies.<sub>Visit elworld.com, for the best no_vel_read_ing experience</sub>Never in Lin Xun's wildest dreams would he have imagined that someone's hand could...cover the sky!1.

A single hand that could envelop the sky itself, pulsing with almighty power that could destroy the world.Lin Xun had been shaken to the core. He never knew that such power could exist in this world.It was practically akin to a god of legends descending upon the mortal realm. A being of miraculous and immeasurable power, who could easily pluck the stars from the sky and refine the mighty seas.The day will come where I will be able to do so as well! For sure!Lin Xun took a deep breath as determination burned in his heart. Power was what he currently lacked the most.He desired it beyond measure!While growing up in the dark, sunless, mine prison, he had been told that his Origin Aeth Artery had been stolen. This caused Lin Xun to have an unusually strong attachment and deep thirst for power.It took a long time before Lin Xun was finally able to calm his raging emotions. He gazed at the yellowing leather book on the desk as a complicated look flitted across his eyes.After being pushed by Mister Lu into the abyss-like passage, all Lin Xun heard was a deafening boom before losing consciousness.When he awakened, he discovered that he had appeared in some deserted black plains.He subsequently spent three months trekking through the mountains and was forced to camp in the wilderness. He experienced numerous difficulties and dangers before finally arriving in the Ziyao Empire's territory.Although remote, Feiyun Village was considered a part of the Ziyao Empire.Lin Xun still remembered Mister Lu's final words\u2014the one who had stolen his Origin Aeth Artery was in the Ziyao Empire!<sub>For more_novel, visit elworld.com</sub>Lin Xun gently touched the book with a finger as he took a deep breath to compose himself.He stood up and carefully placed the yellowing leather book back into the old wooden box.The book and brush had been hastily thrust upon him by Mister Lu in their final moments. This indicated that they were his most valued possessions.Lin Xun could still clearly remember how serious Mister Lu had been when he had instructed, \u201cSafeguard them well! The success of your future cultivation will depend on them, especially the brush! I have failed to uncover the secret within it but if you manage to, you'll be able to defy the heavens and change destiny even after losing your Origin Aeth Artery!\u201dLin Xun did not know what kind of earth-shaking secret the book and brush held nor did he wish to dwell on such things before properly ascertaining Mister Lu's fate.After blowing out the oil lamp, Lin Xun climbed onto the bed and began to cultivate in a cross-legged sitting posture.Kuku~Qi circulated in his body like water flowing along a creek, bringing with it wisps of aeth power through the channels of his body.Cultivation thrived in the current era, giving rise to countless schools and inheritances. The sheer number of cultivation related texts could fill the seas, and there were too many for any one individual to count in their lifetime.One's cultivation progress was divided into five greater cultivation stages: the True Martial stage, the Spirit Dipper stage, the Spirit Sea stage, the Heaven Ascension stage and the Cyclic Derivation stage.The True Martial stage was the cornerstone of cultivation. Although there were many people in the world, it did not mean that just anyone could cultivate.The only criterion for cultivation was the ability to step into True Martial stage. This was the most basic and most important condition.True Martial stage was further categorized into nine layers: Qi Drawing, Inner Strengthening, Organ Opening, Orifice Unlocking, Essence Refining, Blood Igniting, Little Cycle, Big Cycle and Aeth Transformation.Every layer represented a complete transformation of one's power.For example, the first layer, Qi Drawing, consisted of using qi to draw aeth power through the meridian channels with the aim of slowly washing away the mortal impurities of the body.<sub>The latest_epi_sodes are on_the elworld.com website.</sub>After reaching this stage, a cultivator's impurities would be cleansed and purified. This made the person's flesh rich in vitality, bestowing the cultivator with the strength to split rocks and fight tigers.There was a common saying that everyone knew: \u201cReaching Qi Drawing is akin to opening the door to cultivation and is the first step into True Martial stage.\u201dWhether or not a person succeeded in crossing the doorway was a mark of whether that person could become a cultivator.After all, if someone couldn't even reach Qi Drawing, how could they possibly become a cultivator? Such an individual could only stay as an ordinary person; unable to become a practitioner that could fly in the sky, tunnel through the ground and summon wind and rain.Lin Xun first came into contact with cultivation at the age of ten, when Mister Lu imparted to him a cultivation method called Yuan Holding Art. The art focused on eliminating unnecessary thoughts to allow one to proceed with a calm and clear state of mind.At the age of eleven, Lin Xun successfully stepped into Qi Drawing layer. He drew qi into his body to wash away his impurities, becoming a full-fledged cultivator.Lin Xun was currently thirteen years old, but his cultivation had only recently broken through Qi Drawing to reach the second layer True Martial stage, the Inner Strengthening layer.Inner Strengthening consisted of using a special technique to breathe aeth power, directing it to temper the inner organs and strengthen the qi senses. At this level, a cultivator would be able to breathe in like a cow and their exhaled breaths would become akin to an arrow, giving the cultivator the ability to keep moving for extended periods.Lin Xun had been stuck at Inner Strengthening for two years.Compared to others, Lin Xun's cultivation progress was not too terrible, but it could only be described as ordinary. He was far from being able to match the super talented geniuses.However, Lin Xun understood that it was already a miracle he could cultivate after the terrible misfortune of losing his Origin Aeth Artery!Naturally, Mister Lu played no small part in this.Gurgle~Aeth power galloped in Lin Xun's body. It circulated for eighteen cycles before Lin Xun finally felt he had approached his limit.Phew~Lin Xun immediately stopped and spat out a breath of white qi shaped like an arrow. The qi managed to travel three feet, creating a tiny ripple in the air.<sub>Updated_at elworld.com</sub>\u201cThe Qi Drawing layer is considered complete once one is able to circulate aeth power nine times around the body. For the Inner Strengthening layer, one needs to reach eighteen cycles before attempting to ascend to the third layer, Organ Opening.\u201dLin Xun had already become capable of eighteen aeth power cycles a year ago. However, he ended up stuck at this step for a year.There were many reasons why. For instance, he lacked aeth-power-rich foods that were necessary to supplement one's cultivation, money to buy cultivation resources, proper guidance, etc.After all, Lin Xun was an orphan that had grown up in a dark, sunless, mine prison. It was already a miracle he had managed to survive and there was naturally no way he could match up to others.Most importantly, Lin Xun's channels were weak and were unable to bear too heavy a burden. He would only be able to advance to the next cultivation layer if he somehow managed to strengthen his channels substantially.However, Lin Xun did not feel frustrated or impatient. Due to his unique childhood environment, he had long cultivated a freakish amount of patience and willpower.The oldest and most veteran prisoner had once said\u2014'to survive in that dark mountain prison, one must first learn to patiently endure in silence.'It was a saying Lin Xun kept close to his heart.The next morning, Lin Xun woke up before daybreak by reflex.He was initially somewhat stunned by the unfamiliar environment, but soon regained his bearings. This was no longer the all-too-familiar mine prison.Due to the habits he had built up over the years, Lin Xun did not feel even the slightest bit sleepy and hurriedly rose from the bed.This was Feiyun Village, his first stop in the Ziyao Empire. What he needed to do now was to become part of the village as soon as possible.To do this, he needed to show his value.He needed to do something similar to what he had done the night before. If his Light Drawing Rune hadn't successfully solved Tie Shan's worm problem, Lin Xun would not have been accepted so easily by Village Chief Xiao Tianren.This was value.<sub>Try the elworld.com platform_for the most advanced_reading experience.</sub>Lin Xun believed that after yesterday's event, the villagers would at least no longer be so resistant towards an outsider like himself.After rising from the bed, Lin Xun stretched a little before proceeding to wash up. However, he was interrupted by a strange noise outside the room. Unable to hold back his curiosity, he pushed open the doors to investigate.What he saw were several figures gathered in the weed-filled yard outside.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Some of them were weeding the yard while a few strong men were repairing the broken buildings and walls.All in all, it was a busy scene. However, everyone seemed to have a certain tacit agreement; no matter what they were doing, they would try their best to keep the noise down as if they were afraid to disturb him.At the sight of this, an imperceptible smile rose from the corners of Lin Xun's lips as understanding dawned upon him.\u201cAh, Brother Lin Xun is up!\u201d\u201cDammit Old Yang, I kept telling you to be a little quieter. Good job, you've now woken up Brother Lin Xun.\u201d\u201cHmph! You're just trying to slander me because you dislike me! You've been hammering so roughly on the roof, even a dead pig would be awakened by the noise, let alone Brother Lin Xun! Ah, Brother Lin Xun, I wasn't trying to scold you by comparing you to a pig.\u201dUpon seeing Lin Xun appear, the villagers in the yard immediately dropped what they were doing and swarmed towards him in a panicked manner, as if desperate to obtain the best spot to face him.Lin Xun nearly jumped back at everyone's friendliness and hurriedly asked, \u201cEh, respected elders, may I know what this is about?\u201d<sub>The most up-to-date nov_els are published_here > elworld.com</sub>A muscular man stepped forward and grinned, \u201cBrother Lin Xun, the method you used to help Tie Shan eliminate his pest problem yesterday was truly magical. We can't help but admire you\u2026\u201dBefore he could finish, he was interrupted by a middle-aged married woman, \u201cStop beating about the bush! Can't you see that Brother Lin Xun is getting impatient?\u201dShe chided before looking towards Lin Xun with a friendly smile, \u201cBrother Lin Xun, since you're going to be part of our Feiyun Village family, we felt that you might have some difficulties living alone so we brought some daily necessities for you.\u201dAt her words, the villagers nodded one after another, \u201cRight right right! Missus Liu knows how to express our thoughts best. This is exactly what we want to say.\u201dA genuine smile from the heart appeared on Lin Xun's slightly pale face and he cupped his fists together in gratitude, \u201cThank you for the trouble, respected elders.\u201dThe crowd of villagers soon scattered and began to once more help Lin Xun tidy up the yard, even finding places to store the gifts they brought.Lin Xin originally wanted to chip in as well but was quickly stopped by Missus Liu. She prepared some hot water to help him wash up before bringing him a bowl of aeth grain porridge and a plate of salted meat for breakfast.Her overwhelming enthusiasm made it impossible for Lin Xun to reject her actions, and he could only receive it all with a smile. While they were chatting, Lin Xun gradually changed the way he addressed her, calling her Aunt Qiao, which made her beam in delight.By the time Lin Xun finished breakfast, the entire yard had changed completely. The ground in the courtyard had been swept clean and paved with limestone tiles. The garden in the corner had been weeded and replanted with vegetable seeds.The three thatched houses had been repaired and refurbished. A thick layer of golden straw covered the roofs, gleaming brightly under the morning sun.In the kitchen, pots, pans and plates had been neatly arranged while bundles of dried meat hung from the walls.Only now did the previously dilapidated residence look as if someone was living in it.Lin Xun took in everything with a smile, feeling quite moved by the villagers' gesture. This simple and warmhearted village culture was something he had never experienced before.<sub>The most up-to-date nov_els are published_here > elworld.com</sub>Just as the villagers were about to leave, Lin Xun seemed to recall something. \u201cPlease wait, respected seniors.\u201dThe crowd came to a stop and looked towards him.Aunt Qiao was a straightforward person by nature and asked, \u201cWhat is it? Is there anything else the place lacks? Feel free to let us know and we'll see if we can get it for you.\u201dLin Xun smiled and shook his head. \u201cI believe everyone has seen what happened last night. I might not have other talents, but I do have a special method to deal with worm infestations in aeth fields. If anyone needs help, do let me know\u2026\u201dBefore he could finish, Aunt Qiao slapped her forehead with a grin, \u201cI nearly forgot. Brother Lin Xun, truth be told, my family's forty acres of aeth fields has encountered the same worm infestation problem as Tie Shan. I've been so worried and anxious watching the aeth grains slowly wilting. Could you find some time to help out your Aunt Qiao?\u201dThe other villagers began to panic. Although they had come before daybreak to send gifts and help Lin Xun tidy up his residence, it wasn't just because they wanted to become familiar with him; their main goal was to seek his help.Like Tie Shan, the other villagers' aeth fields had also been infested by worms. With their annual harvest about to be ruined, everyone could not help but feel worried.Lin Xun's appearance was undoubtedly akin to a ray of hope for the villagers.After all, what happened yesterday in Tie Shan's aeth fields had been far too miraculous. A beam of golden light shot into the heavens, drawing down dazzling silver moonlight that swiftly eradicated the worms. These events had shocked the villagers like never before.\u201cBrother Lin Xun, uh...my family's 60 acres of aeth fields have also been infested by worms and the situation has become very dire. If you could lend a hand, I will definitely treat you as family!\u201d\u201cHow can your problem be as bad as mine? In less than seven days, my family's 67 acres of aeth fields will be ruined!\u201dThe villagers immediately spoke up without waiting for each other to finish, displaying pitiful expressions as they begged Lin Xun.Lin Xun was taken aback. He had not expected so many of the fields to be infested.<sub>Visit elworld.com for a better_reading experience</sub>For a time, he hesitated over his next move, not knowing who he should agree to first.At Lin Xun's current capabilities, he could draw at most a single Light Drawing Rune per day. There was no way to do more unless he advanced to the third layer, Organ Opening, which would allow him to double his output.However, that was clearly impossible for the time being.His cultivation had been stuck for two years. Even he did not know when he would progress.What should he do?Who should he promise first?Lin Xun found himself unable to make a decision under the villagers' expectant and hopeful gazes.A deep voice sounded, \u201cAll of you back down. I shall discuss this matter with Lin Xun before helping everyone solve their problems.\u201dA tall, elderly figure walked into the yard. It was Village Chief Xiao Tianren.Lin Xun cupped his hands together, \u201cUncle Xiao, you've come at the right time. I'm still new to this village and do not know the situation. This matter will definitely require your input.\u201dThe villagers immediately understood that Lin Xun had basically agreed to help them and they only needed to wait for the village chief to arrange the details. Hence, they happily departed.Before long, only Xiao Tianren and Lin Xun were left in the yard.\u201cMore than a hundred years ago, this residence was also inhabited by a rune master.

One day, however, a passing cultivator from Donglin City discovered a hidden small Feiyun Fire Copper deposit nearby\u2026\u201dAccording to Xiao Tianren, more than a hundred years ago, a hidden ore vein had been discovered in Fiery Smoke Mountain, which was a dozen miles from what would eventually become Feiyun Village. The ore vein contained Feiyun Fire Copper, which was an excellent material to craft mid-grade weapons. It was valued by people and a fist-sized chunk could be exchanged for three imperial silver coins in the city.There was no doubt that this ore vein was a giant mountain of treasure.In order to mine the ore, several prominent Donglin City cultivators collaborated and captured numerous slaves.After ten years of mining, the ore vein was dug out and abandoned, while the Donglin City cultivators happily returned with their riches.Dealing with the leftover mining slaves was too troublesome for any of the cultivators to think about, so they left them all behind in the remote mining village.Village Chief Xiao Tianren was one of the mining slaves who had been fortunate enough to survive, while the other villagers were descendents of the other abandoned slaves.Feiyun Village was named after Feiyun Fire Copper.<sub>Visit elworld.com, for the best no_vel_read_ing experience</sub>Lin Xun could not help but sigh sadly inside after hearing this story. He had lived in the sunless prison mine since young and naturally understood how miserable the lives of these mining slaves could be. Their lives were worth less than grass, and they were unable to control their own life and death.Lin Xun never would have guessed that Village Chief Xiao Tianren used to be a slave in his past. This honestly surprised him and made him admire the old man a little more.After being abandoned in the desolate mountain region, Xiao Tianran had founded Feiyun Village, creating a place for the other mining slave descendents to live in. The drive to accomplish such a feat was not something any ordinary person would possess.As if he could read Lin Xun's thoughts, Xiao Tianren waved his hand and self-mockingly said, \u201cI am not as capable as you think. Feiyun Village's current state is fully due to the work of the rune master that once stayed in this residence.\u201dXiao Tianren's voice was full of emotion as he continued, \u201cIt was that rune master who established these aeth fields and taught us how to plant aeth grains. If not for him, all of us would have starved to death on this barren land.\u201dLin Xun could not help but ask, \u201cSince the environment here is so terrible, why are the villagers still here?\u201dXiao Tianren shook his head, \u201cThis place is located deep within the three thousand great mountains at the edge of the empire's southwest border, and has been called 'heaven's border' since ancient times. How can leaving be easy? Even the nearest city is eight thousand miles away and the path there is fraught with dangers such as ferocious beasts and poisonous insects. Without a powerful cultivator as a guide, no one will be able to reach the nearest city alive.\u201dLin Xun finally understood that he still had many challenges to overcome before he could reach the populated cities of Ziyao Empire. After all, he had only reached the edge of the border.However, he was not worried. As long as he was alive, his goals would one day become reality.Xiao Tianren suddenly chuckled and patted Lin Xun's shoulder, \u201cYoung man, I know that you will not resign yourself to staying here forever. However, this old man can guarantee you that as long as you are here, we will treat you as one of our own.\u201dLin Xun nodded sincerely, \u201cDon't worry Uncle Xiao, I will also treat everyone as family.\u201d<sub>For more_novel, visit elworld.com</sub>Xiao Tianren displayed a bright smile, \u201cThat's good.\u201dLin Xun said, \u201cUncle Xiao, let's not delay any longer and start to make arrangements for clearing out the worm infestations.\u201dXiao Tianren nodded, \u201cThat will be for the best.\u201dOn that very day, under Xiao Tianren's guidance, Lin Xun arrived at Liu Dabiao's fields. Lin Xun once again drew a Light Drawing Rune using his Gold Eating Rat bone powder, which summoned light from the sun to destroy the worms.However, this also exhausted Lin Xun's small amount of aeth power, making him unable to continue.He could only wait for tomorrow to continue helping the other villagers.In the afternoon, Liu Dabiao's wife prepared a sumptuous meal and warmly hosted Lin Xun to express their gratitude.After leaving Liu Dabiao's house, Lin Xun followed the small footpath within the village. From a distance, he saw a plot of flattened, cleared-out land where a dozen kids were practicing martial forms.The cruel sun hung high in the sky while a group of bare torso children sweated under the scorching heat. There was a layer of crystal-clear sweat covering their bronze skin.Despite this, not a single one complained or grumbled. Each was focused on practicing a set of fist techniques.Each move was simple, yet also free and unrestricted while simultaneously being ferocious and forceful. Some moves gave off the image of a galloping horse, while others seemed akin to a suddenly pouncing tiger or wolf. These children were around seven or eight years of age, but their technique was clearly quite polished.<sub>The source of this_chapter; elworld.com</sub>This surprised Lin Xun, partly because he recognized the fist technique. It was called Marching Army Fist and was the most popular foundational fist art in the Ziyao Empire army.Lin Xun had not expected the children of Feiyun Village to have practiced the art to such an extent. These moves were clearly not just for show.Due to his frail body, Mister Lu had taught Lin Xun several martial arts to strengthen his body since young, which included Marching Army Fist.However, after observing a little longer, Lin Xun discovered a few more things. Although their forms were excellent, there seemed to be several mistakes on the application of force. As a result, although the moves were still powerful, the power of each strike would be somewhat scattered.As the saying went, the form did not matter if the essence was clear. The Marching Army Fist also followed this principle. The power of each punch needed to be compact and unleashed like rushing thunder. Only then would the practitioner be able to achieve a bold and powerful aura akin to an armored cavalry sweeping through the mountains and rivers, and an unstoppable army charging through the lands.There were several mistakes in the application of force by these children, making them unable to properly compact the power of their punches. Hence, their strikes did not have the bold and powerful aura akin to rushing thunder.Although such practice would still strengthen their bodies, it was nothing but harmful to their martial cultivation progress.Lin Xun pondered for a while before ultimately shaking his head. He did not know who had taught these children and naturally would not do something as presumptuous as correcting them.\u201cOh? Do you also know Marching Army Fist?\u201d Villager Chief Xiao Tianren had apparently walked over while Lin Xun had been lost in thought. He looked at Lin Xun with a thoughtful expression.\u201cYes, I've practiced it before when I was younger.\u201d Lin Xun nodded. There was no point in hiding this.\u201cI see. Then what do you think of these little ones?\u201d Xiao Tianren's interest had been piqued. He suddenly realized that this boy was growing increasingly unfathomable. It was surprising that he would not only know the intricacies of rune drawing but also be knowledgeable about Marching Army Fist.<sub>Updated_at elworld.com</sub>Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I feel that if these kids wish to pursue martial dao, their training has already started to veer off the correct path.\u201dXiao Tianren was stunned. He seemed to recall something as his elderly face changed slightly. A long while later, he took a deep breath and said, \u201cLin Xun, are you certain?\u201dLin Xun nodded. There was no need for him to lie.Xiao Tianren fell silent again as his expression fluctuated indeterminately.A clamor suddenly erupted at the village entrance, followed by the ground shaking as a cloud of dust rose in the distance.\u201cUncle Lian and the others are back!\u201d Cheers could be heard far away.Soon after, Lin Xun saw a group ride through the village entrance. Their leader was a middle-aged man in leather clothes. His long hair hung behind his shoulders like a cape and he had a stern, dignified look. The muscles on his body bulged like boulders and were filled with explosive power.He rode a scale horse that was as large as an elephant. His gaze was as cold and sharp as a blade and his aura was clearly not that of an ordinary person.A group of figures followed behind him. However, their mounts were the slightly lower ranked deer horse. Each individual had a spear or sword strapped to their backs, while several leather bags were piled up on some of their mounts.<sub>Visit to elworld.com discover_new novels.</sub>Although Lin Xun did not make any noise as he watched, he was inwardly astonished by the sight.\u201cThese are the village guards. They number nine in total and are led by Lian Rufeng, who is the leader of the village guards. His cultivation is at the fourth layer True Martial stage.\u201d Xiao Tianren explained as he led Lin Xun forward to welcome the group. The children that had been practicing martial arts had stopped their exercises and were cheering as they excitedly sprinted towards the guards.The other villagers had also been alerted by the disturbance and walked out to investigate. When they saw Lian Rufeng and the others, joy shimmered on their faces as they went to welcome the group.It was quite easy to tell that Lian Rufeng was a popular figure among the villagers.\u201cLian Rufeng and the guards just made a three thousand mile trip to Qingyang Tribe to exchange the village's harvested aeth grains for salt, cloth and other day-to-day necessities.\u201cA trip to Qingyang Tribe and back takes at least half a month. There are numerous dangers along the way and the slightest carelessness could make it a trip of no return. It has honestly been tough on them to take on this responsibility.\u201dXiao Tianren continued explaining to Lin Xun as they walked. At this point, he seemed to realize something and suddenly said in a low voice, \u201cDo not let Lian Rufeng know about what we discussed earlier regarding the Marching Army Fist. I will explain later.\u201dLin Xun nodded in understanding. He could already faintly sense that Xiao Tianren was a little on guard against Lian Rufeng.Seelooloo!The giant scale horse released a high-pitched hiss and stopped in front of Xiao Tianren while the villagers continued to crowd around.Lian Rufeng dismounted with a hearty laugh, \u201cBig Brother Xiao, we're back.\u201dThe tall, muscular man had a stern, dignified appearance and resembled a mountain. A fierce and bold aura pulsed from his body, giving him an intimidating air.<sub>Try the elworld.com platform_for the most advanced_reading experience.</sub>On closer inspection, his breathing was drawn-out and his exhalation was compact. His muscles looked extremely tough and his bones seemed to be filled with explosive, robust aeth qi. These were indeed the special characteristics of a fourth layer Orifice Unlocking expert.The True Martial third layer, Organ Opening, represented the opening of the five key organ dwellings that were linked to the five elements and was the foundation of a cultivator's five elements. At this stage, a cultivator would circulate aeth power through the five dwellings, connecting the inside and the outside, thus giving the cultivator the power to lift giant cauldrons and sprint like a tiger or leopard!In the Ziyao Empire army, a cultivator at this cultivation stage could qualify to be a commander of a hundred man army.The fourth layer, Orifice Unlocking, referred to unlocking the orifices in the cultivator's four limbs and skeleton. This amplified the cultivator's focus which in turn made the cultivator's qi and blood more robust.Upon reaching this layer, the cultivator's qi and blood would boil like smoke rising towards the sky, allowing the cultivator to be unafraid of cold, heat and evil spirits. The cultivator became more nimble and agile, with footsteps so light that no prints would be left on the snow. Even going three days and nights without food would not affect the cultivator's concentration and focus.Lian Rufeng was an Orifice Unlocking layer expert. To ordinary people, he was basically an active volcano that could erupt at any moment and gave off an aggressive, intimidating pressure.Lin Xun could not help but be surprised. He was not afraid of the other party's pressure but felt that it was rather rare for such a cultivator to appear in the remote Feiyun Village.\u201cOh? Who is this young man?\u201d asked Lian Rufeng with a slight frown. He had noticed Lin Xun's unfamiliar face among the crowd and was closely examining him.Xiao Tianren smiled, \u201cThis is Lin Xun. He recently became a member of Feiyun Village.\u201dUpon finding out that Lin Xun was a rune apprentice, Lian Rufeng narrowed his eyes a little but did not seem very surprised.However, when he was told that Lin Xun had solved Tie Shan's and Liu Dabiao's worm problems, Lian Rufeng's expression finally changed.He had travelled to numerous places over the years and had naturally seen several rune apprentices before. As such, he had more worldly knowledge than the villagers and knew that rune apprentices were, at most, unimportant helpers for the rune masters.<sub>The source of this_chapter; elworld.com</sub>However, it was rather rare to find a rune apprentice that could draw runes capable of eliminating pest problems.This was why Lian Rufeng's expression had changed.\u201cGreetings Uncle Lian.\u201d Smiling, Lin Xun walked forward and respectfully cupped his hands together.\u201cHahaha, we're already family. No need to be so polite. Work hard and our Feiyun Village might one day produce a real rune master. That would bring great honor to us.\u201d Lian Rufeng laughed heartily as he patted Lin Xun's shoulders. His loud voice sounded very friendly.However, Lin Xun could detect a tiny sliver of scrutiny and suspicion in Lian Rufeng's gaze. From this, Lin Xun understood that this fourth layer True Martial stage village guard leader was likely an extremely shrewd and sophisticated individual.Lin Xun had grown up in the sunless mine prison and had seen many of its terrible prisoners. Once, when Mister Lu was drunk, he had accidentally let slip that if these prisoners were released, they would be akin to poison flowing into the seas and cause immeasurable harm. They would certainly cause a huge commotion in the Ziyao Empire.From this, it could be judged how formidable these prisoners were. Each one was a first class evil criminal that was crafty and ruthless.Growing up in such a dark and terrible environment had naturally influenced Lin Xun, giving him a unique insight for determining a person's character. In fact, he had also learnt several effective observation techniques from the prisoners.As such, Lin Xun believed that his judgement was not wrong and that Lian Rufeng was most likely a cunning person. Although Lin Xun had yet to determine if this guard leader was good or bad, he was, at the very least, not as simple as he appeared.Sure enough, several things began to jump out at him when he observed Lian Rufeng again.For example, although Lian Rufeng was dressed in old leather clothes, there was a faint purple wooden token hanging at his waist. If Lin Xun was not wrong, this wooden token was carved from purple cloud incense sandalwood. It was a valuable item that was worth ten imperial silver coins.In addition, Lian Rufeng was wearing a pair of ash-colored boots. They might look normal to others, but these boots were made from the plume feathers of an ash falcon and even had a swift wind rune carved onto them. In battle, they would make a person's body as light as a feather, akin to giving wings to a tiger.<sub>Visit elworld.com for a better_user experience</sub>In fact, these boots were more highly valued than the purple cloud incense sandalwood.These were interesting finds. How did a cultivator from a poor and remote mountain village afford such fancy equipment?Lian Rufeng was definitely no simple person!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

As usual, they distributed the goods in the village ancestral hall.Xiao Tianren quickly called out all the villagers and the crowd surged towards the ancestral hall at the center of the village.Lin Xun was also warmly invited but he declined. He had only arrived yesterday and it did not feel appropriate for him to partake.Night arrived as the final rays of the sun faded.Lin Xun was casually seated under the hanging willow in the yard. He gripped the blue blade in his right hand as he carved a block of clubmoss silver wood.Dododo...The sharp blade swam across the surface of the wooden block with precise and strong movements like a silkworm spitting silk. Wooden flakes fell like snow, accompanied by a soft and unique rhythm.Lin Xun's long fingers and generous palm effortlessly gripped the azure blade as it fluttered about like a butterfly among flowers. There was a certain beauty to his technique that would fill a person's eyes with delight.Rune apprentices needed to first hone their technique before learning how to draw runes. As such, it was necessary for them to train their fingers.After all, agile and steady hands were the most important requirement of the rune carving process.<sub>The latest_epi_sodes are on_the elworld.com website.</sub>The art of runes was not simply blindly carving a series of patterns. The practitioner also needed to control the flow of aeth power, adjust the concentration of ink, control the thickness and strength of each stroke...and even consider the compatibility between ink and rune.For example, the most basic green wood rune required a rune brush, a saucer of green wood rune ink, and a vessel.The rune brush was the tool used to draw runes, and the ability to wield it depended on the dexterity and precision of the user's hand.It was worth mentioning that there were different grades of rune brushes. A good rune brush had high compatibility with ink and aeth power, while a bad rune brush was the opposite. Mister Lu's Azure Sky Burning Gold brush, for instance, was a rare and priceless treasure.Rune ink was the medium used to draw runes. The ink was usually made from various ingredients and different types of inks possessed different characteristics.Green wood rune ink was made from sixteen different ingredients: fragrant green wood, white spirit leaves, spirit mayfly blood, red oriole tears... Carefully calibrated quantities of each ingredient needed to be meticulously melted together in a cauldron by a rune master to ultimately bring out their essence.Using this ink to draw a green wood rune would undoubtedly maximise both the compatibility and success rate.The 'vessel' referred to where the rune was drawn. Normally speaking, such a vessel needed to be an aeth article, which was an object that could 'conduct' aeth qi. For example, the rune could be drawn on a weapon, a piece of armor, a tool, a house, a tea cup, a carriage, etc.For Lin Xun's light drawing rune, he had used his finger in place of the rune brush, Gold Eating Rat bone powder as rune ink, while the 'vessel' was naturally the field. The field contained wisps of aeth qi, allowing it to be considered an 'aeth article'.However, the light drawing rune carved into the field was honestly very crude and did not possess an 'aeth power-source'. As such, it could only be activated once and was unable to operate continuously.An 'aeth power-source' was something that could provide a continuous flow of energy to the rune. It could come in the form of aeth stones, an aeth vein or even treasures rich in aeth power.Simply put, although a rune brush, a saucer of rune ink and a vessel were all that were needed to draw a rune, the entire process consisted of extremely complex and stringent steps and was far more difficult than it appeared on the surface.<sub>This_content is taken from elworld.com</sub>To become a qualified rune master was even more challenging, which was also why rune masters were so well-respected and commanded a high status.Long ago, Lin Xun became a rune apprentice when he began to learn the craft under Mister Lu.Although he was still a rune apprentice until now, it was because his current cultivation and mastery limited him to a few foundational rune diagrams.Of course, Lin Xun had yet to come into contact with any rune master besides Mister Lu. This made it impossible for Lin Xun to gauge his current standard against others.In the past, Lin Xun had enquired about this topic more than once, but Mister Lu always gave the same reply\u2014a shake of his head and a sigh.The shaking of his head indicated disapproval, while the sigh represented disappointment.It was easy to imagine how dejected Lin Xun would feel every time he received such an answer. Fortunately, Lin Xun never gave up and gradually grew accustomed to Mister Lu's criticisms.Instead, Lin Xun's motivation surged each time. He relentlessly competed against himself, continuously improving his rune standards.This was the embodiment of growing braver with each setback.Dusk arrived as the final red rays of the setting sun dyed the small yard in a beautiful glow.A breeze blew past, ruffling thousands of willow leaves. The leaves quietly rustled, creating a serene and carefree atmosphere.The blade in Lin Xun's hand continuously danced as a life-like elderly figure rapidly took shape. Matted hair, deep gorge-like wrinkles and a body as thin as a bamboo appeared slowly. The wooden figure stood with his hands behind his back, his face slightly raised as if looking at the heavens. His eyes were filled with unyielding arrogance.<sub>This_content is taken from elworld.com</sub>It was a carving of Mister Lu.Every inch of the wooden figure was an amalgamation of numerous tiny and detailed runes; however, not a single hint was visible. It gave off a strangely complete sensation as if it was a single body instead of countless runes linked together.Lin Xun dazedly stared at the wooden figure in silence. In the end, he let out a helpless sigh before picking up the azure blade again to destroy the wooden figure an inch at a time.When he was done, Lin Xun rose to his feet. Under the setting sun, a determined look appeared on his slightly pale face.People could not live and wallow in their memories.To live was to keep looking towards the future!As the curtain of the night fell, the villagers returned from the ancestral hall with the goods they needed. Despite this, Lin Xun observed that there was a lack of joy on the villagers' faces. Instead, several of them had their brows tightly furrowed together.What's more, he could faintly hear people arguing from the ancestral hall. Lin Xun barely managed to identify Village Chief Xiao Tianren's and Village Guard Leader Lian Rufeng's voices before the arguing quickly died down.As the night deepened, the sound of hurried galloping rang out in the village before gradually fading into the distance, disappearing into the mountains.It seems that Lian Rufeng has left\u2026 Lin Xun pondered in silence. Just as he was about to return to his room for his regular night cultivation session, someone suddenly banged at his door.Bang bang bang!The knocking was glaringly loud amidst the silence of the night, giving off an air of violence and rudeness.<sub>For more_novel, visit elworld.com</sub>Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

After some consideration, he walked out of the house and opened the main gate.Outside, he found a very thin man. The man's eyes flickered as he looked around, giving off an air of vigilance and viciousness.Lin Xun recalled that the man was one of the guards that had returned with Lian Rufeng. However, he should have already left, so why had this man been left behind?Also, what was the reason for such a sudden late night visit?\u201cI am Lu Ting, one of the village guards. I've come to make a few inquiries,\u201d said the thin man after glancing at Lin Xun. His voice had a cold tone that made it hard for a person to question him.Lin Xun smiled, \u201cSo it's Big Brother Lu Ting. Is it just you?\u201dSince his youth, he had learned to always wear a smile while facing others. Not only was it a form of self-respect, but it would also subconsciously relax the other party.\u201cAlthough Big Brother Lian Rufeng has left, he is still worried about the safety of the village. Thus, he told me to stay behind to keep an eye on things and prevent any rascals from harming the village,\u201d answered Lu Ting as he stepped in without waiting for Lin Xun's invitation. The village guard's attitude appeared extremely forceful.Lin Xun chuckled, knowing that 'rascal' was clearly referring to him.However, Lin Xun was still unsure whether Lu Ting had been sent here under orders from Lian Rufeng or whether he had come on his own accord.Lin Xun pondered over this as he smiled and followed Lu Ting, \u201cWhat does Big Brother Lu Ting wish to enquire about?\u201dAs he spoke, he politely gestured to invite Lu Ting into the house.Lu Ting waved his hand to reject the offer, \u201cWe'll talk in the yard. I'm not in the mood to stay here for long.\u201d<sub>Foll_ow current_novel on elworld.com</sub>Lin Xun nodded, \u201cSure.\u201dLu Ting frowned. It suddenly occurred to him that this thirteen-year-old boy had been unusually composed since he opened the door. His smiling face seemed incapable of panicking.However, the more unflustered Lin Xun was, the more loathsome Lu Ting found him. Lu Ting hated people he could not read, especially when the person was a thirteen-year-old boy. The situation made him feel increasingly uncomfortable inside.Lu Ting could not be bothered with pleasantries and directly asked without a shred of politeness, \u201cWhere are you from and what's your goal in coming to Feiyun Village?\u201dLin Xun chuckled, \u201cI came from the barren wastelands. As for why I came to Feiyun Village, it's actually quite simple. It was along the way.\u201dAlong the way?Lu Ting glared at Lin Xun and sternly said, \u201cLittle fellow, don't try to act smart in front of me. If you don't tell me the truth today, don't blame me for not showing any courtesy!\u201dCrack crack!A wave of cracking sounded from his body as a violent and intimidating aura unfurled. The older man suddenly resembled an enraged beast.If it was any other thirteen-year-old boy, he would have likely been scared out of his wits long ago and obediently listened.However, Lin Xun did not react. His smile receded as he frowned, \u201cBig Brother Lu Ting, every word I've said is the truth. The village chief is also aware of this. If you don't believe me, you can go verify with him.\u201dLu Ting's expression darkened when he saw that the frail-looking boy seemed to be completely oblivious to his aggressive aura \u201cDon't try to use that old man Xiao Tianren to trick me! Do you think that useless old bag of bones can protect you?\u201dUseless old bag of bones...Lin Xun was now certain that Lu Ting had zero respect for Xiao Tianren.<sub>You can_find the rest of this_content on the elworld.com platform.</sub>At this thought, Lin Xun suddenly smiled. He gazed at Lu Ting's stormy face, \u201cLian Rufeng told you to come?\u201d\u201cHow did you\u2026\u201d Lu Ting subconsciously blurted out but quickly returned to his wits halfway through. Murder flashed in his eyes as he abruptly grabbed at Lin Xun's shoulder.\u201cYou piece of trash! It looks like you won't understand how powerful I am if you don't taste my power!\u201d The sudden grab was as accurate and as fast as an eagle closing in on a rabbit. If it landed, Lin Xun's shoulder would likely be torn to shreds.Lin Xun's shoulder sank as his toes gently pushed off the ground. His body shifted backwards, calmly avoiding the attack. However, the slight smile that hung from the corners of his mouth now appeared somewhat icy.\u201cIt seems that my arrival has made you guys uneasy. How interesting, could it be that you guys are hatching some scheme and are worried that I might foil your plans? Is this why you came to probe me?\u201dLu Ting's heart shook. This little rascal is sharp!\u201cBrat, don't speak nonsense!\u201d shouted Lu Ting as his grabbing hand suddenly clenched into a fist. He twisted his waist and took a big step forward as his fist rushed forth like thunder. A gust of wind accompanied the punch, causing the surrounding air to screech.Marching Army Fist\u2014\u2014Power Through A Thousand Soldiers!The blow was entirely different from the one practiced by the village children as it was infused with abundant aeth power. From how the swift and ferocious fist-winds hummed around it, the punch appeared more than capable of shattering a thousand-pound boulder or tearing apart a tiger!To achieve such power, Lu Ting would have to at the very least have reached True Martial second layer cultivation.However, Lin Xun's figure spun like a top, nimbly dodging the ferocious attack.\u201cEh?\u201d After having two of his attacks avoided, Lu Ting realized that the seemingly weak-looking thirteen-year-old boy was not simply a mere rune apprentice.\u201cLittle rascal, you've indeed been hiding your skills. Looks like Big Brother Lian Rufeng was right, you definitely have an ulterior motive for coming here!\u201dLu Ting's face was brimming with killing intent as his figure charged forward again.<sub>Visit elworld.com for a better_user experience</sub>He used his kill move this time, unleashing eight consecutive moves of the Marching Army Fist: Power Through a Thousand Soldiers, White Dragon Armor Stripper, Tiger Roar Echoing in the Mountain Forest, Iron Bridge Across the River, Mighty Mountain Suppresses the Moon, Burn the Prairie, Raging Sea Devastates the Mountain and Fight Bloody Battles On All Directions.Thump! Thump! Thump!Fist-winds roared as they were seemingly transported into a bloody desert battlefield; weapons clanged loudly against each other in the background as an extremely terrifying aura of violence spread.However, no matter how swift or sudden his attacks were, Lu Ting was unable to touch even a corner of Lin Xun's clothes, let alone injure him.Lin Xun's thin figure had become unbelievably agile, shifting here and there in the flicker of an eye on his fast and nimble feet. Although he did nothing but dodge from start to end, he would always somehow avoid each deadly strike by a hair's breadth.For a time, the two figures tangoed around the yard. Although Lin Xun did not receive any injuries, the originally clean and tidy yard was turned into a mess. Soil flew everywhere while several of the recently installed tiles were shattered one after another.After some time, Lu Ting realized that he was still unable to land a single blow, causing him to grow both alarmed and angry. It was difficult to believe that he was incapable of dealing with a thirteen-year-old kid.\u201cYou brat, come here and die!\u201dSuddenly spotting that Lin Xun had been forced into a corner, Lu Ting immediately grasped the opportunity with a roar. His fist rumbled as it thrust forth like rushing thunder.Lin Xun finally stopped dodging. As he faced the incoming punch, an all-too-familiar smile rose from the corners of his lips.He finally made his move.This was the first time Lin Xun had counter-attacked since the start of the battle.His right hand clenched into a fist as he bent his elbow, smoothly twisted his waist and arced his foot forward\u2014these three simple movements were simultaneously completed in an instant.Rumble!<sub>This_content is taken from elworld.com</sub>A punch smashed through the air.FavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

When he saw it, however, he abruptly sensed a hint of a completely different type of flavor.The fist-winds were surging too fiercely, and resembled a wildfire sweeping through the plains!A thought flashed in Lu Ting's head. Is this really the same Burn the Prairie?Thud~Two fists smashed into each other, causing a muffled explosion in the air that scattered into a screech.Thump thump thump!Intense pain shot through Lu Ting's fingers, making him feel as if they were nearly broken. He could not help but grunt in pain as his body was sent flying.If he had not used his full power in that final moment, he would likely have been seriously injured by this blow!How the hell is this rascal so powerful?Lu Ting's heart filled with horror. The frail thirteen-year-old boy should have been an easy target. Who could have imagined that this seemingly weak youngster would turn out to be such a formidable character?\u201cBrat! I'll return this favor next time!\u201dLu Ting knew that the situation no longer boded well for him and quickly turned to escape the moment he steadied his body. In a few breaths, he disappeared into the darkness of the night.Lin Xun did not give chase, but instead secretly breathed a sigh of relief as a wave of burning pain began shooting through his meridian channels.Although the earlier blow had successfully scared Lu Ting into withdrawing, it had consumed nearly half of Lin Xun's aeth power. However, this was not even the main problem. Most importantly, his meridian channels were extremely weak due to his Aeth Origin Artery being dug out, and could not endure overly powerful aeth power circulation.The Marching Army Fist was a popular basic fist technique in the army that had its own unique circulation route.<sub>Visit to elworld.com discover_new novels.</sub>The first art embodied a few main concepts: to be free and unconstrained, to strike swiftly like rushing thunder and to move like deadly lightning. When used, the practitioner needed to fully circulate his aeth power through his channels and apertures into his hands and fingers.If the practitioner's channels were too weak, they would not be able to bear such fierce circulation.With the current condition of Lin Xun's body, using Burn the Prairie's full might was his limit.The Marching Army Fist's final two moves, Raging Sea Devastates the Mountain and Fight Bloody Battles On All Directions were even more berserk and ferocious. If Lin Xun attempted to use them, he would hurt himself, doing more harm than good.Phew~~Lin Xun let out a deep breath amidst the messy yard. He could not help but fall into thought as he recalled tonight's battle.\u201cIt seems that the Lian Rufeng and the other village guards clearly do not welcome me. I wonder what they are up to.\u201dLin Xun did not understand.\u201cLin Xun, may I come in?\u201d Village Chief Xiao Tianren's voice sounded from outside the gates.\u201cUncle Xiao, please enter. It just so happens that I have something urgent to tell you.\u201d Lin Xun withdrew his thoughts and hurriedly opened the gates to welcome Xiao Tianren in.\u201cJust now\u2026\u201d Lin Xun began to speak but was stopped by a wave and sigh from Xiao Tianren, \u201cI know. You are not at fault here.\u201dLin Xun frowned, \u201cUncle Xiao, I'm a newcomer that has yet to learn the village's current circumstances. Tonight's sudden events have honestly surprised me. Could you help me understand what's going on?\u201dXiao Tianren placed his hands behind his back. Guilt colored his face as he observed the messy yard. A long time later, he finally said, \u201cI did not expect that Lian Rufeng would be so ruthless to an outsider. From this, I can see that he is determined to align himself with the Qingyang Tribe.\u201dA contemplative look rose on Lin Xun's face. Qingyang Tribe? He had heard of this place. It was where Feiyun Village exchanged their aeth grains for day-to-day necessities.Guard Leader Lian Rufeng was the one in charge of this matter. He and the other guards would protect the goods during the trips between Qingyang Tribe and Feiyun Village.\u201cLian Rufeng has the highest cultivation in the village and he has a strong reputation among the villagers. He didn't use to be like this. He only changed after his son, Lian Fei, was sent to cultivate in Donglin City.\u201dXiao Tianren slowly said, \u201cLian Fei is a very intelligent child and he is also the most talented kid in the village. As his father, Lian Rufeng paid a huge price in order to give his child better cultivation opportunities, and even begged the Qingyang Tribe leader to help recommend Lian Fei to the Donglin City's most famous martial dojo.\u201dLin Xun silently listened without interrupting. He knew that this matter was not so simple.<sub>Foll_ow current_novel on elworld.com</sub>Sure enough, Xiao Tianren soon revealed the answer, \u201cIt isn't easy for a child from a poor village to cultivate. The daily expenditure alone is already quite a huge sum. To allow his child to cultivate without worry, Lian Rufeng began to turn his sights to the village.\u201cYou should know as well that Lian Rufeng is the village guard leader and has been placed in charge of sending the village's aeth grain to Qingyang Tribe to barter for goods. Several years ago, each village harvest could be exchanged for three hundred imperial copper coins worth of goods. In recent years, however, the goods he brought back gradually decreased. In fact, there were even times where he returned empty-handed.\u201dAt this point, anger could be heard in Xiao Tianren's voice, \u201cIf it was to solve Lian Fei's cultivation problems, I'm sure everyone would have not have minded him secretly taking some of the money. However, he kept taking more and more while bringing back fewer and fewer goods. It has already begun to threaten the villagers' livelihoods. He has gone overboard!\u201dLin Xun suddenly recalled the token made from purple cloud incense sandalwood he saw hanging from Lian Rufeng's body that day. It was an expensive item that was worth ten silver coins.Ten silver coins were equivalent to a thousand copper coins!There was also the even more valuable rune engraved boots Lian Rufeng was wearing.Lin Xun had already found it strange back then. Lian Rufeng was merely a poor villager from a remote village deep in the mountains. Even if he had fourth layer True Martial stage cultivation, it was impossible for him to possess such pricey equipment.Lin Xun finally found the answer. Lian Rufeng had likely been secretly amassing wealth over the years by taking advantage of his position.Xiao Tianren suddenly sighed, \u201cI've warned him many times, advising him to exercise some restraint and don't make things look too ugly. I told him I would not step in as long as he did not threaten the villagers' livelihoods. Unfortunately, he has already been blinded by greed and can no longer return.\u201dLin Xun asked, \u201cWas this what you were arguing with him about in the ancestral hall today?\u201dXiao Tianren nodded, \u201cYes, the goods he brought back this time were the least in recent years and it has already begun to affect the villagers' lives. After today, everyone will likely have to scrimp and ration for some time.\u201dHis elderly face was filled with anger and sadness.\u201cHe has indeed gone overboard.\u201d Lin Xun frowned but did not feel it appropriate to say anymore.\u201cWhat else can we do? He has the highest cultivation in the village, is the only one familiar with the route to Qingyang Tribe and is the only person who has some relations there. Without him, it will become even more difficult for the villagers to survive.\u201d Xiao Tianren sighed helplessly.Lin Xun said, \u201cIn other words, Lian Rufeng has realized that Feiyun Village cannot do without him. That's why he dares do this.\u201dXiao Tianren nodded with a gloomy face.Lin Xun fell into deep thought. After a while, he said, \u201cBut why did he send someone to deal with me tonight?\u201d Could this have something to do with him aligning himself with the Qingyang Tribe?\u201d\u201cThat's what I'm worried about.\u201d Xiao Tianren's anxiously said, \u201cI have a feeling that Lian Rufeng has been secretly brewing some kind of scheme that will harm Feiyun Village. If he succeeds, all of the villagers will likely be implicated.\u201d<sub>Visit elworld.com for a better_user experience</sub>With this new information, Lin Xun was finally able to confirm some of his speculations, \u201cPerhaps Lian Rufeng became suspicious due to my sudden arrival and sent someone to probe me in order to prevent his plans from being disrupted.\u201d\u201cYour guess should be correct.\u201d Xiao Tianren looked at Lin Xun in surprise as he had not expected a thirteen-year-old boy to be so intelligent and perceptive.\u201cThat's it then.\u201d Lin Xun's face relaxed, \u201cAs long as we understand the reason, there's no longer any need to worry.\u201dXiao Tianren could not help but ask, \u201cAren't you afraid that Lian Rufeng will continue sending people to deal with you?\u201d\u201cI already know he will and will naturally take proper countermeasures. As long as he fails to kill me, I will one day make them pay a price they can't afford to.\u201d Lin Xun casually said. His eyes were clear and calm, while a smile hung from the corners of his lips. However, there was a cold ruthlessness in his words that made a person shiver.This was Lin Xun. Under that seemingly harmless and frail appearance was an unimaginable decisiveness and ruthlessness. Otherwise, a child would never have survived in that dark sunless mine prison.Mister Lu had taught him how to survive and had given him an unyielding heart, while the guards and prisoners had shown him the meaning of true darkness and cruelty.Xiao Tianren dazedly stared at Lin Xun for some time before he said, \u201cYou truly do not seem like a thirteen-year-old youngster.\u201dLin Xun grinned and shrugged. \u201cBut I am thirteen this year.\u201dXiao Tianren waved his hand, dismissing the topic, \u201cLin Xun, now that you know the village's circumstances, are you still certain you want to stay? You should give this matter some careful consideration. If you stay, you will likely have to face numerous dangers.\u201dLin Xun replied without hesitation, \u201cI'm staying! Why shouldn't I? This is my first residence in the Ziyao Empire and I'm not going anywhere else until I'm properly prepared.\u201dXiao Tianren did not speak any further on this topic. He patted Lin Xun's shoulders, \u201cYou are different from your peers and I don't have much advice to give. Since you've decided to stay, you are a member of Feiyun Village. Although my old bones aren't very capable, I will do my best to protect you.\u201dAs the final word left his lips, Xiao Tianren turned around and left.Lin Xun sent off the old man with his eyes. A long time later, he stretched his body and mumbled, \u201cBeing scared of everything that crops up isn't my style\u2026\u201dThat night, Lin Xun did not engage in his usual cultivation session. Instead, he pondered in the darkness for a long time. In the end, he rose to his feet and opened the old wooden box under the faint starlight that leaked in through the window.Lin Xun retrieved the yellowing book and mysterious dark gray rune brush and placed them on the study table. He took a deep breath and seated himself before them.On the very same night, Lu Ting hurriedly left Feiyun Village after fleeing from Lin Xun's residence, arriving at a small hill a dozen miles from the village.Favorite<sub>The latest_epi_sodes are on_the elworld.com website.</sub>Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He wore a scarlet-red cape and his gaze as cold as a blade. It was the Feiyun Village Guard Leader, Lian Rufeng.Upon Lu Ting's arrival, Lian Rufeng asked, \u201cHow did it go?\u201d\u201cBig Brother, that rascal is trouble. I nearly lost to him due to my carelessness.\u201d Lu Ting's face was filled with guilt as he was unable to personally accept such an outcome.Lian Rufeng and the others were shocked by these words. Lu Tong was a True Martial second layer expert. It was shocking to find out that he had failed to probe a mere thirteen-year-old boy.Lu Ting quickly described the battle and everything else that had happened. In the end, he said, \u201cBig Brother, you were right. I have a feeling that rascal is definitely a helper that old man Xiao Tianren found!\u201dLian Rufeng fell silent. A long time later, he sneered, \u201cFrom what you told us, Lin Xun is merely an Inner Strengthening small fry. That old fox Xiao Tianren is a fool if he has placed his hopes on Lin Xun.\u201dAfter a brief pause, Lian Rufeng waved his hand, \u201cHowever, since we now know that the brat only has a little cultivation, it's no longer worth paying him any attention.\u201d\u201cBig Brother, how about we take this chance to kill that rascal to intimidate Xiao Tianren?\u201d Lu Ting was clearly not willing to take things lying down. He was ashamed at his loss to Lin Xun and naturally did not wish to leave it at this.\u201cNo hurry. We can let them live for the time being. Our most important task now is to fully integrate ourselves with the Qingyang Tribe and establish a foothold for ourselves there. When we achieve this, we'll have a place to live even if we cut off all ties with Feiyun Village.\u201dLian Rufeng took a deep breath as the flames of ambition burned in his eyes. \u201cThis matter is of utmost importance. With the Qingyang Tribe's power and our abilities, we might even be able to set our sights on Donglin City!\u201dDonglin City!It was the biggest city in the vicinity of the Great Three Thousand Mountains. Highly populated, well-connected, heavy traffic\u2014all these factors made it an important trade hub along the Ziyao Empire's southwest border.It was said that anyone who could establish themselves in Donglin City would be officially recognized as a citizen of the Ziyao Empire. All in all, it was a far better place to live in than the dangerous godforsaken little mountain village.The blood of the surrounding guards boiled in excitement as they imagined such a future.\u201cLu Ting, you and Qian Qi shall stay behind. Qian Qi has reached the Organ Opening layer, and together, you will be able to easily subdue anyone in the village. Remember, keep a close eye on Xiao Tianren and immediately capture the old man the moment you feel something is amiss!\u201d Lian Rufeng stared hard at Lu Ting and another muscular middle-aged man as he instructed. His tone was filled with unquestionable authority.<sub>Visit elworld.com for a better_reading experience</sub>Lu Ting and Qian Qi looked at each other and nodded in acknowledgement.Satisfied by their response, Lian Rufeng nodded. Soon after, he shouted, \u201cThree months! Three months at the very most and all of Feiyun Village's riches will become ours! With our newfound wealth and our status as members of the Qingyang Tribe, Donglin City's gates will surely open for us brothers!\u201cLet's ride!\u201dLian Rufeng urged his scaled horse forward, leading the other guards as they swiftly disappeared into the distant mountains.Meanwhile, Lu Ting and Qian Qi returned to Feiyun Village under the cover of the night.Inside the thatched cottage, the window was open, allowing the cool night breeze to flow in.Bright starlight poured down from above, sprinkling a layer of silver on the study desk while also bathing the yellowing book and dark gray rune brush in a mysterious glow.Lin Xun gently caressed the book and brush as he mumbled, \u201cMister Lu said that these two treasures hide an astonishing secret. Discovering the secret will allow me to change my fate and fully recover from my inner injuries\u2026\u201dA long time ago, Lin Xun was made aware that he was born with an unbelievably rare Origin Aeth Artery. It was called the Grand Abyss Heaven Devourer and was a top tier heavenly bloodline that anyone would be proud to have.Such an innate talent would most definitely make its owner a natural one-in-million cultivation genius. As long as the owner worked hard, he would, without a doubt, become the pride of a generation and renowned throughout the world. Such a person would become a terrifying to the max existence who could look down on everyone else.Unfortunately, Lin Xun's Grand Abyss Heaven Devourer Origin Source Artery was dug out and stolen by someone at birth, which nearly caused him to lose his life in the process.Although Mister Lu managed to save Lin Xun, the extraction of his Origin Aeth Artery had left irrecoverable injuries on his meridian channels and apertures.This was the reason why his channels were currently weak and rough. As a result, his cultivation progress appeared ordinary, and he was still stuck at the second layer Inner Strengthening after many years.According to Mister Lu, if Lin Xun was unable to recover from his inner injuries, he would forever be stuck at the True Martial stage, unable to ascend to higher realms of cultivation.The only silver lining was the book and brush left by Mister Lu. They were akin to a tiny ray of hope in Lin Xun's almost completely dark cultivation path.It was common knowledge that all medicines, secret arts, inheritances...were unable to heal injuries left behind from the extraction of an individual's Origin Aeth Artery.However, Mister Lu had told Lin Xun that unravelling the secret hidden in the book and brush would allow him to change his fate and be reborn.<sub>Try the elworld.com platform_for the most advanced_reading experience.</sub>The book and brush silently rested on the study desk.Lin Xun gradually put aside his thoughts. With a deep breath, he flipped open the yellowing book...This was the first time he opened the ancient book after the prison mine had been destroyed.What kind of earth-shaking secrets did it hold?Lin Xun could not help but feel expectant. However, he was slightly taken aback when he saw the contents of the first page.There were no words on the page, only a single rune diagram. It was the all-too-familiar green wood rune.When Lin Xun was very young, he had begun to practise this very rune diagram under Mister Lu's tutelage. He had long memorized its structure and essence, allowing him to easily construct it with a flip of the hand.Flip~Lin Xun pondered a little before flipping to the second page. There were no words here either, only another rune diagram. This time, it was the very familiar piercing gold rune.Flip~ Flip~Lin Xun continued flipping as if he was unable to accept this. However, he found that each page contained a single rune diagram. Every rune was far too familiar and he had practised them countless times since young. They were practically imprinted into his bones and he could draw them even with his eyes closed.\u201cWhy is it like this? Could the secret that Mister Lu talked about be hidden within these basic rune diagrams?\u201dAfter flipping through half the book, Lin Xun still did not notice anything special. His brows subconsciously scrunched together as he fell into deep thought.If these were rare and highly ranked runes, Lin Xun would have at least felt them somewhat special.However, they were all the most fundamental and well-known rune diagrams, which made him very puzzled.It was an ancient leather book filled with the aura of time and had been solemnly entrusted to him by Mister Lu during their life or death farewell. So why did it not contain any earth-shaking secrets, but instead several of the most basic and commonly-known rune diagrams?Unable to accept this, Lin Xun continued to flip the pages. When he finally reached the last page, his hands abruptly froze as his eyes narrowed.The final page was different!<sub>The latest_epi_sodes are on_the elworld.com website.</sub>Instead of a fundamental rune diagram, there was a mottled, incomplete and dim mess of strokes. It was a strange diagram that seemed nothing like a rune.It resembled something that had been haphazardly drawn by a child with no semblance of a proper rune.However, it suddenly drew Lin Xun's attention. Could the secret mentioned by Mister Lu be hidden in this strange diagram?Lin Xun began to carefully inspect the diagram, meticulously studying every complex, incomplete, dim and mottled inch of it.Time flowed by without notice until Lin Xun's vision turned a little fuzzy. However, he still did not discover anything noteworthy.Lin Xun could not help but feel disappointed. He stared at the strange diagram and fell into thought.An old book that was filled with fundamental rune diagrams. Only its last page contained a strange, messy and complex diagram. This was definitely not normal.What's the hidden meaning within?Where should he start to unravel its secret?Question after question surged in Lin Xun's mind.While Lin Xun was racking his brains in frustration, he suddenly noticed something from the corner of his eye. The last page had a different hue from the others and was faintly dark red.He picked up the book and brought it up to the oil lamp to get a clearer view. On the thin page made from some unknown material, several previously unobserved things emerged.Hand prints!Extremely faint blood-colored hand prints!It was as if someone had repeatedly pressed a bloody hand onto the page long ago. Due to the passage of time, the bloody hand prints had become faded and mottled.Moreover, Lin Xun observed that these hand prints were of varying sizes and shades. Each print was clearly from a different person and era.A bold thought quietly arose in Lin Xun's head, Could it be that this mysterious book was obtained by different cultivators over the years. They tried everything to discover its secrets but were unable to make any progress. In the end, they tried to use their essence to draw out the answer within.At this thought, Lin Xun bit the tip of his finger and let a drop of essence blood fall onto the mysterious page.<sub>The latest_epi_sodes are on_the elworld.com website.</sub>FavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The mountains and rivers were so gorgeous that it felt like looking at a painting. An imposing figure stood on the tallest mountain peak, gazing above the blue dome of heaven with his hands behind his back.Strong winds blew the figure's clothes and hair, making him seem like an immortal that did not belong to the mortal realm and was ready to drift away with the wind at any moment.Rumble!The figure suddenly moved. With a wave of his sleeve, divine light converged to form a dazzling pillar. The pillar shot upwards, viciously smashing open the blue dome of heaven to crash against the endless universe outside.Dong~As the pillar of light slammed against the originally empty space, a rippling vortex-like door was forced to emerge!The vortex was akin to a space devouring abyss of immeasurable and terrifying depth. It spun crazily, giving off a frightening power that twisted the surrounding space until it shattered, a sight that would absolutely induce terror in anyone who saw it.Countless stars were pulled towards the vortex as if they were commoners bowing to their king. The vortex continued to spin, releasing a loud rumbling noise as it created a horrifying earth-shaking sight in the void of space.A single strike had broken the sky, shattered outer space, and opened a door amidst the void!Without personally witnessing this, who would believe that a single wave of a sleeve could send forth such overwhelming and godly power?Lin Xun's heart shuddered violently. This was the second time he had seen such a terrifying scene. The first was while he fled the mine prison. He had seen an ancient and mysterious giant hand burning with endless purple fire, a herald of destruction that covered the sky and land.It was also the first time Lin Xun experienced how powerful a cultivator could be, which made him increasingly determined to cultivate.However, in comparison to this scene, the sky-encompassing hand seemed much more inferior.Rumble!Before Lin Xun could return from his thoughts, a loud noise exploded in his ear. The blood in his body suddenly began to flow uncontrollably as his heart and mind were violently shaken. This unbearable sensation nearly made him cough blood.It was at this moment that he saw an unbelievable enormous beast claw suddenly reach out from deep within the vortex-like door. It tore through the void and viciously thrust towards the blue dome of the sky.<sub>New_chap_ters are pub_lished on elworld.com</sub>The claw was far too gigantic, making the mountains appear like unremarkable grains of sand in comparison. It was covered in ice-cold scales that pulsed with boundless and savage power.\u201cI've already opened the galaxis door. Who in this world can still stop me from stepping onto the eternal star road? Get lost!\u201d With an icy snort, the imposing figure atop the tallest mountain flicked his finger, causing a ray of light to suddenly appear.Before Lin Xun could clearly see what was happening, the terrifying giant claw disappeared. Blood poured from the sky, dyeing the ground a horrifying red!However, this was not the end. A majestic figure bathed in golden rays soon charged out from the galaxis door.The dazzling figure felt like a supreme existence akin to the scorching sun. It seemed to burn with golden light that could illuminate the entire world, making it appear divine and all-powerful.\u201cStar Road Divine General? Hahaha, to think that even the divine general has been dispatched to obstruct my dao seeking ambitions. How impressive!\u201d The imposing figure let out a long whistle. He gave off an aura of completely unrestrained freedom and boldness, like someone who would only look at the world's heroes with disdain.The sound shook Lin Xun until he could see stars. It made his qi and blood fall into disorder, and his thin figure to tremble violently. Although he forced himself to endure, his mind had already become a fuzzy chaotic mess, buzzing incessantly and making him unable to see anything.It was as if he was trapped in a nightmare, unable to wake up no matter what he did.An unknown amount of time passed and Lin Xun dazedly saw the sky shatter like a spiderweb, revealing black hole after hole. Flames rained down relentlessly like shooting stars, burning the mountains, rivers and land.It was a picture of doomsday itself. The sky had shattered and the flames of destruction were pouring through like a flood, turning the world into a chaotic furnace. There was desolation everywhere and all life was in a state of extreme misery.Mountains crumbled, seas were ravaged by tsunamis, plants had turned to ash, and all life was being annihilated!It felt as if the end had arrived.The imposing figure still stood on the highest peak, his hands behind his back as he silently took in everything. There was a certain melancholy and loneliness to this sight.After a long time, he let out a deep sigh as his voice boomed across the land, \u201cTime did not favor me!\u201dA complicated mix of despair, disappointment, frustration and other feelings washed over Lin Xun.A ten-foot-long copper coffin appeared beside the imposing figure with countless mysterious patterns carved upon its surface.The figure walked forward and opened the coffin.Just when Lin Xun thought that the figure was going to enter the coffin, he instead retrieved a book and a brush and casually flung them in. He then hoisted the coffin on his shoulder and took a big step forward to leave.Lin Xun's pupils abruptly shrank, realizing that the book and brush were the very same treasures Mister Lu had left him.Swoosh!<sub>Foll_ow new_episo_des on the elworld.com platform.</sub>The person who was about to leave seemed to sense something. He suddenly paused and turned his head.It was merely a single backward glance, but his gaze seemed to pierce through time and space.Lin Xun felt as if he was struck by lightning as a loud rumble boomed from deep within his soul. Everything he had seen shattered like glass and disintegrated into dust.Meanwhile, he involuntarily cried out in agony and coughed a mouthful of blood, his already slightly pale face turning sickly white.His body trembled violently, and an indescribable pain flowed through him, as if his soul was being shredded inch by inch.The pain was so intense that it felt as if he would die the next moment.All of this was caused by the single bead of blood he had dropped on the mysterious book's final page.The book was still lying open at its last page on the study desk, while the dark gray brush silently lay beside it.The blood coughed by Lin Xun splattered on the book's final page, coloring it a messy blood-red.However, Lin Xun could not afford to care about such things. He could feel his life force rapidly weakening while his soul was on the verge of crumbling. Death felt as if it was already waiting just around the corner.Why is this happening?Lin Xun's thoughts were chaotic, swirling about his head. Mister Lu had told him that if he could unravel the secret hidden in the book and brush, he would be able to change his fate and be reborn anew even with his Origin Aeth Artery stolen.However, Lin Xun had never imagined that such a series of events would occur when he tried to discover the secret.He had seen several outrageous things: an imposing figure sweeping away great terrors that emerged from the 'galaxis door', the world succumbing to destruction, everything being incinerated to ash, and the despairing picture of doomsday\u2026These sights led to his qi and blood falling into disorder and dealt a terrible blow to his soul. He was already no longer able to stop his rapidly depleting life force.Why was this happening?Could every person who had seen these scenes be unable to escape the fate of death?No!Mister Lu must have seen these scenes as well and managed to survive, so why can't I?At this thought, Lin Xun suddenly understood why he was on the verge of death. It was all because his cultivation was too weak and his body's tolerance level was too poor.<sub>Visit elworld.com for a better_reading experience</sub>The truth was exactly as Lin Xun had concluded. In the past, every individual who had obtained the book and brush was one of the most powerful existences of their time. They were existences who wielded almighty power and stood far above the mortal coil.Such people would naturally not be overly affected by these astonishing scenes.However, Lin Xun was different. He was only a True Martial second layer youngster. Moreover, his meridian channels were weak and damaged beyond recovery. As such, it was easy to imagine how shocking those scenes had been to him.If not for his astonishing willpower, he would have fallen long ago.However, although he was still alive, he was also not far from death\u2026Lin Xun did not panic as the habits he had nurtured since young allowed him to quickly recollect himself. However, he soon came to the conclusion that he was incapable of stopping the rapid loss of life force.What can I do?Lin Xun's gaze landed on the book's final page once more. As he observed the strange diagram dyed red by his blood, he could not help but raise a brow.This strange diagram does not look like a rune. It's incomplete, dim, messy, and complicated; it's difficult to describe its 'strangeness' in words.Could the scenes from earlier have originated from this strange diagram?Lin Xun did not know why he had become like this. He was clearly about to die, but he could not help but be drawn to the strange diagram.If this diagram is an incomplete rune that I cannot comprehend, who could have created it?The imposing figure on the tallest peak rose in Lin Xun's head. Soon after, his gaze shifted towards the dark gray brush.Could this strange diagram have been drawn by this rune brush?Lin Xun did not know if it was from impulse or a flash of inspiration, but he picked up the dark gray rune brush. With a deep breath, he forced himself to endure the unbearable pain and placed the brush on top of the strange diagram.However, nothing noteworthy happened when the brush's dull black blade-like tip touched the strange diagram.Just as disappointment began to well up in Lin Xun's heart, his pupils suddenly shrank. The blood he had coughed onto the page began to squirm as it was stealthily absorbed by the dark gray rune brush\u2026Shing!A clear shing akin to a sword hidden in the deep abyss being suddenly drawn from its sheath sounded.Lin Xun felt his body become rigid as if an invisible irresistible power was controlling him and he was no longer able to move.<sub>You can_find the rest of this_content on the elworld.com platform.</sub>His right hand gripped the dark gray rune brush which seemed to come alive at this moment.

The stroke glowed bright red and was filled with indescribable grace.Together, the old yellowing book, the strange diagram imprinted on its final page, and the dark gray brush which seemed to have awoken from a deep slumber created a mysterious, heart-palpitating sight.Lin Xun's eyes were bugged out as he was entranced by all of this. However, he was powerless to do anything even if he wished to.His body was being controlled by some mysterious force and his hand no longer listened to him as it continued its dance upon the strange diagram.This was the first time Lin Xun had encountered such a bizarre phenomenon and he could not help but be shocked by it.He judged that the cause of this strange affair was somehow related to the blood he had coughed out earlier.The blood must have awakened the dark gray rune brush while also changing something about the strange diagram. Clearly, there was more than what it appeared to be on the surface.It was as if an invisible hand was controlling everything, using the ancient book as the base, blood as ink and the brush as the guide to continuously perfect the incomplete, dim, and messy strange diagram.This inconceivable scene made Lin Xun unable to believe his eyes.Moments ago, he had been all but certain that he was about to die. Who could have predicted that a random action from him would result in such a peculiar change?What did all of this mean?Before Lin Xun could figure it out, he suddenly felt all the blood in his body being sucked towards his right hand.The dark gray rune brush had released a suction force and was continuously absorbing his blood through the skin of his palm.Gugu~~Lin Xun could even hear his blood gurgling in his body as it flowed into the dark gray brush.Damnit!Lin Xun began to worry. The continuous loss of blood would only speed up his death. If this was not stopped, he would soon die due to blood loss.Lin Xun frantically struggled but was still unable to move at all. The dark gray rune brush was as immovable as a mountain. It absorbed his blood as its sharp tip danced across the strange diagram, leaving scarlet-red stroke after stroke.<sub>Try the elworld.com platform_for the most advanced_reading experience.</sub>Lin Xun's face grew increasingly pale and his lips turned purple.

He had originally believed that the book and brush left by Mister Lu would help him change his fate and allow him to be reborn anew. Who could have imagined that they would instead go after his life!Seated before the desk, Lin Xun was like a wooden puppet. His right hand held the rune brush as it continuously drew on the book's final page, creating light swishing sounds.The surroundings were very quiet.Lin Xun was already no longer capable of making any noise. His face grew increasingly pale and his aura increasingly weakened as his consciousness faded little by little\u2026There was nothing he could do. Perhaps, all that was left was to wait for death.Lin Xun never imagined that the shadow of death would descend barely after he arrived in the Ziyao Empire and was starting to find his footing in Feiyun Village.Was this fate?He did not know why but he began to recall the astonishing scenes from before. In his mind, he once again returned to the moment when the imposing figure cried out, \u201cTime did not favor me!\u201dNext, Lin Xun's vision went dark before he fainted.Amidst the deep and dark night, starlight sprinkled in from the window. In the distance, the boundless mountains appeared cold and desolate.A boy dressed in thin clothes was sprawled across the study desk; his presence so weak that it was nearly imperceptible. His right hand was being guided by a dark gray rune brush as it continued its work on the old book's final page\u2026An unknown amount of time passed. The dark gray rune brush suddenly paused as wisps of glaring golden flames drifted from its sword-like body, lighting up the entire room.The brush began to burn as it disappeared into the strange diagram on the mysterious book's final page.Omm!A peculiar ripple unfurled from the book, accompanied by a cryptic sound that soon spiraled away into the air.The old book turned into a flash of light and disappeared into the unconscious Lin Xun's body.Meanwhile, in the sky above the boundless Great Three Thousand Mountains, resplendent stars eternally hung on the curtain of the ink-black night as they cycled through their never-changing paths.However, when the mysterious ancient book disappeared into Lin Xun's body, an invisible ripple suddenly emerged in the night sky, spreading throughout the heavens like a surfboard on a wave.<sub>Visit elworld.com, for the best no_vel_read_ing experience</sub>Millions of stars seemed to shudder in alarm but they instantly returned to their original positions. It would have been undetectable unless someone had been paying very close attention.That same night in the Ziyao Empire. A stargazing platform stood on the outskirts of the capital; nine thousand and nine hundred feet tall. At the top of the platform, the cold night wind roared past like a dragon. It was the tallest building in the capital and the entire city could be seen from atop it.An old man in black robes was currently standing alone on the stargazing platform. He had a head full of white hair and was hunched over due to age. It felt as if a slightly strong wind would be able to blow him away.The old man was the empire's 'Heavenly Seer'; a wiseman that enjoyed supreme status in the Ziyao Empire.The Heavenly Seer was rumored to have lived a very long time and had already been the stargazing platform's sole master when the empire was established.As he had done so many nights before, the old man arrived at the top of the tower.However, he did not sit down to meditate as usual, nor did he observe the stars. Instead, he stood before the railing and observed the bustling nightlife of the city in silence. It was rather out of the ordinary for him.\u201cAs expected, a strange phenomenon will descend tonight!\u201d After a long time, the old man seemed to sense something and abruptly lifted his head. A flash of light suddenly flitted across his ancient and wise eyes as he peered at the distant night sky.Moments later, the old man frowned and mumbled, \u201cWhy did it disappear? Impossible. The descent of such a strange phenomenon is usually an omen that something is about to happen. It could be a hidden change in the world or a secret within the cycle of celestial bodies. It could be an approaching calamity from outside the realm or an auspicious sign\u2026\u201d\u201cBut why did tonight's strange phenomenon disappear? Could my deduction have been wrong?\u201dThe old man's white hair fluttered in the wind as a grave look, which was rarely seen, appeared on his face.He knew that something must have happened tonight. However, he could not determine what it was with his power.Such an abnormal situation had never occurred before in numerous years past.Although he was old, he was the Heavenly Seer! An existence that was revered even by the Ziyao Empire's royal clan!This was a strange phenomenon that even the Heavenly Seer could not decipher. The significance behind this would utterly shock the world.After pondering over the mystery for a long time, the old man suddenly let out a long sigh. He turned around and began climbing down the stargazing platform.On the same night, an edict was sent from the Heavenly Seer straight to the imperial study, alarming the emperor, who had been resting after retiring from his daily duties.The edict's contents were thus: 'A strange phenomenon descended on the empire's southwest border near the Great Three Thousand Mountains. It was too mysterious and unfathomable, making this old man unable to peek into its contents with my power. An exceptional treasure might have appeared and I advise your majesty to approach with caution.'An exceptional treasure!It was likely that even the Heavenly Seer would not have expected that these three simple words would cause the empire's southwest border to enter the sights of the capital's highest echelons. Nor would he have predicted the storm that would soon follow.<sub>Foll_ow new_episo_des on the elworld.com platform.</sub>Lin Xun was awakened by a rooster's crow. However, he was still a little dazed when he opened his eyes.Not dead?Lin Xun lifted his body from the desk and noticed that it was already bright outside. A ray of sunshine spilled in from the window, bathing him in its warm embrace.I'm not dead!Lin Xun took a deep breath, feeling the air ripple around his body. He was finally certain that he was still among the living.He hurriedly examined his body and discovered that his qi and blood had become exceptionally robust. There was no trace of any wounds as if everything that had happened last night was merely a dream.But Lin Xun knew that it was not a dream!He could still clearly recall that his life force had been flowing away until he was near death's door. Even his blood was being sucked out and absorbed by the dark brush\u2026wait a minute!Where was the brush?Lin Xun was suddenly stunned. He looked around the desk but could not find any trace of the dark gray rune brush or the old book.Lin Xun's heart shook and he hurriedly rose to his feet to begin searching. They were the most precious treasures Mister Lu had left behind. How could he possibly allow himself to lose them?!However, he found neither treasure even after nearly overturning the entire room. Lin Xun frowned deeply as he grew increasingly anxious.Could someone have stolen them in the night?Lin Xun could not be sure. It was at this moment that he suddenly noticed a door had appeared in his previously empty mind-sea!The red door looked as if it had been soaked in blood. Mysterious and complicated patterns were densely packed together on its surface.Upon closer inspection, Lin Xun found that these patterns gave off an ancient, primal aura. Merely looking at them made him feel a slight sense of familiarity as if he had seen them somewhere before.That strange diagram on the book's last page!Lin Xun suddenly remembered. The patterns carved into the door somewhat resembled the strange diagram.However, these patterns gave off a whole and complete sensation, unlike the one that had been in the book before.The door silently hovered in his mind-sea, giving off an unspeakable feeling of mystery.<sub>The latest_epi_sodes are on_the elworld.com website.</sub>Lin Xun's expression turned strange as a certain thought arose in his head.Could the missing book and brush have something to do with the sudden appearance of this door?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He left carrying a bronze coffin, in which the book and brush were sealed. Later, for some unknown reason, the book and brush emerged in the world.Endless years had passed by since then, and many legendary figures had acquired those treasures and attempted to unravel the mystery inside. However, they all ultimately failed, as was evident by the blood-red handprints on the last page of the book.Mister Lu had also failed to understand the mystery.Those treasures had now fallen into Lin Xun's hands\u2026Lin Xun suddenly scrunched his brows as he became aware of a problem. 'Could my series of actions last night have accidentally activated the secret concealed within the treasures?'It was indeed possible. At that time, his life force was slipping away and his body was escaping his control. He seemed to recall the gray brush awakening and using his blood as ink to draw on the strange diagram on the last page of the mysterious book.Lin Xun was certain that the strange pattern was incomplete, and the mysterious door in his mind was engraved with an equally mysterious and complex pattern similar to the strange diagram.The only difference between them was that the one on the mysterious door was complete!Could it be that while he was unconscious that night, the gray brush had restored the strange diagram and triggered a change that made the book and brush transform into the mysterious door in his mind?<sub>Foll_ow current_novel on elworld.com</sub>Lin Xun felt his speculation was plausible, but he couldn't be certain.Lin Xun's detailed deduction and logic no doubt would shock many people since it was impossible for an ordinary thirteen-year-old to possess such intelligence!\u201cIt seems that to confirm the answer I must first investigate the mysterious blood-red door in my mind\u2026\u201d Lin Xun muttered, his innocent and pale face pensive.\u201cLittle Brother Lin Xun, are you up yet?\u201dA voice suddenly rang from the courtyard, waking Lin Xun from his deep thoughts. He shook his head, put the matter aside, and opened the door.Lin Xun recognized the villager waiting in his courtyard. He was called Ying Hao and his family owned two thousand odd square meters of aeth grain plantations.\u201cOh, it's Big Brother Ying. Sorry to keep you waiting.\u201d Lin Xun remembered he had agreed to help Ying Hao exterminate the worms in his family's plantations.\u201cHehe, I just arrived. Little brother, you haven't eaten yet, right? Let's drop by my house first to fill your stomach.\u201d Ying Hao enthusiastically urged Lin Xun.\u201cLet's work on the fields first. We can eat afterward.\u201d Lin Xun smiled, went back into the house to pick up the required tools, and then left with Ying Hao.The plantations in Feiyun Village totaled 46,000 square meters and were owned by different villagers. Aeth grains were grown all year round and could be harvested twice a year assuming there was favorable weather that year.Aeth grains contained traces of aeth power and were considered necessities for cultivation.As everyone knew the cultivation stages were divided into five great stages: True Martial, Spirit Dipper, Spirit Sea, Heaven Ascension, and the Cyclic Derivation Stage.But before cultivators could attempt to break through to the Spirit Dipper stage, they had to rely on materials such as aeth grains to consolidate their cultivation base.The consumption of aeth grains all year round would not only provide cultivators with the strength required but also improve their constitution and strengthen their minds.Understandably, aeth grains were considered 'food' to cultivators. They were essential, even if they seemed to be of little value.<sub>Visit elworld.com, for the best no_vel_read_ing experience</sub>There were few cultivators in Feiyun Village\u2014a total of nine people including Lian Rufeng, so not many aeth grains were needed in the village. As a result, the majority of the aeth grains harvested were either sold or exchanged for other living supplies.The gentle morning breeze blew and the blazing sun rose, shedding light like gold fragments over Feiyun Village and bringing tranquility.The range upon range of mountains in the distance looked immense with no end in sight.Undoubtedly, located in the depths of the mountains, Feiyun Village was very remote and thus given the title of the Great Three Thousand Mountains at heaven's border. It was simply like an area outside the sphere of civilization.Even the Ziyao Empire was likely unaware of the existence of such a small village in the depths of the mountain on the southwestern border.Once Lin Xun arrived at the plantations that Ying Hao's family owned, he deftly took out a short azure blade and a part of a Gold Eating Rat's essence bone and strode into the depths of the fields.Ying Hao stood anxiously in front of the plantations as he watched.Fortunately, Lin Xun quickly and smoothly finished the job. He drew the Light Drawing Rune to attract the sun's brilliance to exterminate the worms in the plantations.Seeing this, Ying Hao was so happy that he couldn't stop smiling. He even repeatedly expressed his gratitude to Lin Xun on their way back to the village.However, he failed to notice the strange expression on Lin Xun's face as they left the fields.\u201cHow could that be? Aeth Power Vortex?\u201d Lin Xun mumbled to himself. Wisps of aeth power continued to circulate through his meridians and acupuncture points, which was no different from the past.But upon a closer inspection, he noticed that his aeth power had transformed into vortexes and circulated differently as it passed the Jade Rotator, Splendid Cover, Violet Palace, and Jade Hall acupuncture points in the center of his chest.These four acupuncture points were located in the heart area and linked together to form a straight meridian. According to the distribution of meridians in the body, these four acupuncture points were along the Governor Vessel and they protected the heart from top to bottom.Therefore, in cultivation, the meridian that the four acupuncture points, Jade Rotator, Splendid Cover, Violet Palace, and Jade Hall, connected to form was also called the Heart Meridian.The Heart Meridian and the four acupuncture points together were called the four heart acupuncture points.The four heart acupuncture points weren't considered particularly important to ordinary cultivators when compared to the One Hundred Meetings acupuncture point on the crown of the head, the Spirit Courtyard acupuncture point on the forehead, and the Sea of Qi acupuncture point in the abdomen.<sub>For more_novel, visit elworld.com</sub>However, these four heart acupuncture points were special to Lin Xun because the Origin Aeth Artery he was born with was originally concealed within the four heart acupuncture points!Ever since his Origin Aeth Artery was taken, his four heart acupuncture points had become incomparably weak and lifeless. His aeth power became incredibly slow every time it neared that area as though it was sinking into a quagmire.Most importantly, the four heart acupuncture points not only were just lifeless but also extremely fragile. Lin Xun didn't dare to let it suffer any impact even during training since his heart could also be damaged and the consequences would be serious if that happened.This was the greatest scar left in Lin Xun's body when his Origin Aeth Artery was removed. It was so great that it might remain there forever.Lin Xun had lived in such a state for thirteen years and had long grown accustomed to it. However, a sudden change appeared!Lin Xun felt something strange when he was helping Ying Hao exterminate worms in the plantations. When he used his fingertips as a brush and the Gold Eating Rat's bone powder as ink to guide the aeth power in his body to draw the Light Drawing Rune, he sensed his aeth power undergoing a unique and new change as it entered the four heart acupuncture points.His aeth power was no longer as sluggish as it was in the past. Instead, it transformed into an Aeth Power Vortex as it reached the Jade Rotator acupuncture point and frantically circulated. It then resumed its original state and moved along the Heart Meridian. But it frantically circulated again at the Splendid Cover acupuncture point\u2026The same process repeated as it passed the Violet Palace and Jade Hall acupuncture points.Such circulation of aeth power was so bizarre and Lin Xun had never experienced something similar before.He felt the four tremendous vortexes created in the four heart acupuncture points, and his aeth power frantically circulated as it entered each one. It only resumed its original state once it left the four heart acupuncture points.The change initially terrified Lin Xun because he thought something had gone wrong in his cultivation. He only felt a little more relaxed when he was absolutely certain that the change had no harmful effect on him.He couldn't divert his attention to any other matter when he was at the critical juncture of drawing the Light Drawing Rune to exterminate the worms. He only had the chance to focus on this issue on his way back to the village.'Aeth Power Vortex? How are they formed?'Lin Xun pondered this for a good while. An idea flashed through his mind. 'Could it be related to the mysterious door that appeared in my mind?'It was indeed possible!That mysterious blood-red door had appeared in his mind that morning and it was shortly after its appearance that the four heart acupuncture points underwent a strange change. It couldn't be a coincidence.<sub>Updated_at elworld.com</sub>\u201cMister Lu said that my fate would change and I would be reborn when I unravel the mystery. Could that be happening already?\u201dWith this thought, Lin Xun couldn't control his excitement.He had waited for this day for far too long!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

After that, he felt a strong urge to rush home and investigate the mysterious door in his mind.Lin Xun knew very well that only by unraveling the mystery of the mysterious door would he be able to figure out the reason for the bizarre change in his four heart acupuncture points.With this thought, he quickened his pace.However, tragic wails rang from Feiyun Village the moment they returned.\u201cLittle Liu!\u201dYing Hao cried out, and his expression drastically changed.Little Liu was his son. His son's full name was Ying Liu'er and he was only nine years old. How would Ying Hao not recognize the cries of his son?What had happened?Ying Hao ignored everything and frantically sped ahead.Taken aback for a moment, Lin Xun then quickly followed after him.There was a flat open area in the middle of the village, which was often used as a training spot for children in the village and thus was known as the village's training field.Every day, the children of the village would diligently gather there early in the morning to practice martial arts under Village Chief Xiao Tianren's supervision.However, it was different that day. A group of children stood frozen with their faces blanched and eyes wide with panic.Not far from them stood Lu Ting lashing a whip at a child on the ground. The child's clothes and skin were torn as he wailed endlessly.The other children were clearly horrified as they likely had never seen such a bloody scene before.It wasn't difficult to know that the child on the ground was Ying Hao's son, Ying Liu'er.\u201cStop! What are you doing?\u201dYing Hao's hair stood up in fury as he rushed over and saw the scene.Ying Liu'er was his only son. How could he possibly be calm seeing him beaten to such a state?<sub>The latest_epi_sodes are on_the elworld.com website.</sub>Whack!Lu Ting shot a cold glance over Ying Hao and flicked his whip again. Like a dancing snake, it ruthlessly struck Ying Hao's chest. The force was so strong that Ying Hao collapsed on the ground and the whip left a red-hot scar on his chest.\u201cLu Ting, what are you doing?\u201d Ying Hao roared to his feet but he didn't dare step forward. How could he, an ordinary person, match up to Lu Ting?\u201cWhat am I doing? As a village guard, I have the responsibility to discipline the children to practice martial arts. But your Little Liu questioned my teaching and won't listen to me. Such poor behavior deserved to be severely punished!\u201d Lu Ting smiled coldly.As he was speaking, he again mercilessly whipped Ying Liu'er. It made him quiver violently and scream until his voice turned hoarse.\u201cStop! You're going to kill Little Liu!\u201dThe vessels in Ying Hao's eyes cracked and reddened.The other children were so horrified that they couldn't bear to watch and shut their eyes tight.\u201cHe deserves it even if he dies! If I don't teach him a good lesson, there will be a lot of trouble in the future!\u201dIndifferently, Lu Ting swung his whip again.As a cultivator of the second True Martial Stage, he possessed tremendous power. Even if he controlled his power well, his attack could inflict serious injury to Ying Liu, if not cripple or kill him.Shua!The long whip danced through the air, fierce and merciless.Ying Hao suddenly roared out loud. Without caring about anything, he threw himself forward to shield Ying Liu'er with his body. He clearly knew he was no match for Lu Ting and that he could only protect his son from the punishment with his body.Just as the long whip whistled through the air, it was caught by a hand. Ying Hao luckily avoided the pain of being whipped.Ying Hao lifted his head to see Lin Xun standing in front of him holding the long whip in a tight grip. The man couldn't recall when the boy had stepped in.Taking this opportunity, Ying Hao carried Ying Liu'er and hid to the side.\u201cLittle trash! It's you again!\u201dLu Ting's face darkened at the sight of Lin Xun. His gaze was cold and full of hatred. He would never forget the humiliation of losing to Liu Xun the previous night.Without a word, Lu Ting flicked his wrist and made the whip break free from Lin Xun's grip. He cracked the whip in mid-air and aimed it directly for Lin Xun's head.<sub>Visit elworld.com, for the best no_vel_read_ing experience</sub>He didn't restrain his power in the slightest and even instilled the attack with aeth power. The whip shot through the air like a snake, producing an ear-piercing sonic boom.Quick! Ruthless! Accurate!Lu Ting instantly acted when Lin Xun appeared, demonstrating his arrogance.However, although he was fast, Lin Xun was faster. With a slight clang and a flash of azure light, the whip coming head-on towards Lin Xun was sliced into two.Bang!At the same time, Lin Xun stepped forward, bending his right arm. Then, like a mountain crushing down, he brought his elbow down on Lu Ting's neck. The older man was sent flying uncontrollably across the air before being thrown pitifully to the ground.\u201cYou want to die!\u201d Lu Ting roared to the point that his lung almost erupted. He already couldn't accept his defeat against Lin Xun last night, thinking that he only lost due to carelessness.Therefore, he didn't hesitate to launch a full-strength attack when he saw Lin Xun. But who would have thought his opponent's blade was so sharp that it instantly severed his whip into two, catching him off guard and subsequently causing everything that followed to happen?Lu Ting's neck was so sore that it felt like it had almost snapped in half, but he didn't care and forced himself up to continue the battle.However, his body suddenly froze, and he dared not budge an inch.The tip of an azure blade was jabbing the front of his neck, causing goosebumps to pop up all over his skin.Lu Ting didn't believe Lin Xun would dare kill him, but he also didn't dare to take the risk. He could only glower at Lin Xun with hate-filled eyes and threatened through gritted teeth, \u201cLittle trash! Kill me if you dare!\u201dYing Hao was astonished. The children were also astonished. They didn't think a thin and weak-looking youngster who had only arrived in Feiyun Village a few days ago could instantly defeat Lu Ting, who was feared for his power and aggressiveness in the village!Lu Ting was a cultivator who possessed the strength of the Inner Strengthening, the second layer of the True Martial Stage!In Feiyun Village, Lu Ting was seen as beyond ordinary and could not be angered.However, he had been defeated instantaneously by a thirteen-year-old youngster!The air turned silent and still, and only Lu Ting's heavy breathing could be heard.In truth, Lin Xun intended to kill. He grew up in a dark and cruel environment, so he knew that he shouldn't show mercy to an enemy.But he refrained himself because Lu Ting was still a member of the Feiyun Village regardless of how strong he was as a cultivator. If Lin Xun, who had only lived in Feiyun Village for a few days, recklessly killed Lu Ting, it could lead to tension between him and the villagers.Lin Xun put away his short azure blade and curved his lips in a smile as he helped Lu Ting up. He said apologetically, \u201cBig Brother Lu Ting, I apologize for what happened just now. Little Liu was in pain so I had to stop you. I hope you forgive me.\u201d<sub>Visit elworld.com, for the best no_vel_read_ing experience</sub>Taken aback, Lu Ting didn't know how to react to the youngster bowing and apologizing to him. But he soon snorted coldly and hissed, \u201cStop pretending. Just you wait!\u201dHe flung his sleeve and stormed away.With narrowed eyes, Lin Xun watched Lu Ting's back as he gradually disappeared, and a cold light flashed across his eyes.\u201cLittle Brother Lin Xun, we must thank you,\u201d cried Ying Hao, rushing forward.Lin Xun couldn't help sighing and said with a bitter smile, \u201cIt was nothing, but I really didn't think Big Brother Lu Ting would be so heartless. Although I stopped him, he seems to hate me now.\u201dYing Hao said angrily. \u201cLittle Brother Lin Xun, everyone saw what happened. If Lu Ting dares to give you trouble, no one would let him!\u201dThe children didn't speak out in agreement but they were witnesses to what happened and as long as they told the truth, their words absolutely would help Lin Xun.Lin Xun smiled. \u201cLet's not talk about this now. We should quickly treat Little Liu's injury. Otherwise, it could be even more serious.\u201dA worried frown crossed Ying Hao's face. He quickly said goodbye to Lin Xun and hurried off with Ying Liu'er, who was struggling to breathe.Lin Xun didn't leave and stood there in deep thought.As expected, Village Chief Xiao Tianren soon appeared. It appeared he had already learned about what had happened as he comforted Lin Xun, \u201cIt's not your fault, don't think too much about it.\u201dLin Xun smiled and gave him a cupped fist salute. \u201cUncle Xiao's words make me feel much more at ease.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201dXiao Tianren hesitated before he muttered, \u201cYou have to be careful. Lian Rufeng left last night but Qian Qi stayed behind. Qian Qi possesses the strength of the third True Martial Stage and he is known for his ruthlessness. Lu Ting is nothing compared to him.\u201d'Qian Qi?'Lin Xun repeated the name in his mind, noting it carefully down.Although he possessed the cultivation base of the Inner Strengthening Stage, the second level of the True Martial Stage, he at most could suppress someone like Lu Ting. He would be no match for Qian Qi who was at the third True Martial Stage, the Organ Opening Stage.Thinking of this, Lin Xun couldn't help but sigh. He was still too weak\u2026\u201cDon't worry, as long as I am around, I won't let them mess around.\u201d Xiao Tianren clapped Lin Xun on the shoulder as he comforted him.Lin Xun smiled. \u201cUncle Xiao, is it right to say that since Lian Rufeng left Qian Qi and Lu Ting behind, he and his people won't be returning any time soon? This explains why he placed two subordinates to monitor the situation in the village.\u201d<sub>This_content is taken from elworld.com</sub>After a pause, Lin Xun continued, \u201cBut when Lian Rufeng and his people return, I'm worried\u2026\u201dBefore he finished speaking, Xiao Tianren already understood what he wanted to say.

This made him certain that Lin Xun's background wasn't ordinary.After pondering for a good moment, Xiao Tianren sighed out loud. \u201cYou're right. Feiyun Village no doubt will face a huge storm when Lian Rufeng and the others return. So, during this period of time, I will make some preparations.\u201dAs he came to the end of his sentence, his voice turned resolute.Hearing this, Lin Xun didn't say anything else. He gave a cupped fist salute and was about to take his leave.It was at that moment when a child suddenly asked aloud, \u201cVillage Chief, Uncle Lu Ting has left, are we still practicing martial arts today?\u201dXiao Tianren was a little stumped by this question. He silently thought, 'Lu Ting has suffered such a blow, how would he have the face to teach you martial arts again.'He suddenly remembered that a few days ago Lin Xun had mentioned the flaws in the Marching Army Fist Art, the technique that the children were learning.Xiao Tianren glanced at Lin Xun, hesitated, and finally said aloud, \u201cLin Xun, do you think you can spare some time every day to help train the children in martial arts?\u201dShua!The children nearby all simultaneously looked at Lin Xun. There was curiosity sprinkled with excitement on their faces.They had witnessed Lin Xun defeat Lu Ting in the blink of an eye and were utterly shocked by the scene.They were just seven to eight years old. Even if they didn't know who was right, they could identify the stronger one.Since Lin Xun defeated Lu Ting, Lin Xun was of course better.Moreover, after witnessing the tragic punishment that Ying Liu'er suffered, they were extremely terrified of Lu Ting and hoped to switch to another martial arts master.Lin Xun's glance swept across the crowd and he finally smiled bitterly at Xiao Tianren. \u201cI have only just started cultivating, so I have limited knowledge in this area. I'm not qualified to be a teacher.\u201d<sub>The most up-to-date nov_els are published_here > elworld.com</sub>Then, he immediately changed his tone. \u201cBut if it's just the Marching Army Fist, I can help a little.\u201dXiao Tianren laughed heartily. \u201cThat's already enough! I won't make you work for nothing. You will have a share in the materials that the village exchanged for in the future!\u201dThe children burst into cheers when Lin Xun agreed. They all looked forward to practicing martial arts with Lin Xun because he was only a few years older yet possessed remarkable strength.Lin Xun smiled and agreed to the request. After discussing with Xiao Tianren, he decided to wait until all the worms in the village's fields had been exterminated before taking on the role of the village's martial arts master full-time.There were no more delays after this. Lin Xun hurried home, eager to solve the mystery of the mysterious door in his mind.Feiyun Village wasn't particularly huge, so by the time Lin Xun returned to his residence, the incident that happened on the martial arts training field had already spread throughout the villagers.Many villagers were infuriated to hear what happened. They felt Lu Ting was too cruel and that if Lin Xun hadn't stepped in, Little Liu would have been crippled or beaten to death.The villagers saw a different side of Lin Xun. They learned that he was not only a rune apprentice, but his martial arts were also impressive. At the very least, Lu Ting was no match for him.The villagers couldn't help but click their tongues in amazement.Only Lu Ting felt suffocated, bitter and furious. He hated Lin Xun to the core. While the villagers were marveling at Lin Xun's ability, he was drinking unhappily at home.Opposite of Lu Ting sat a slim and fierce-looking man in gray. His skin was dark but his eyes were as bright as a falcon's.He was Qian Qi and was an expert in the village second only to Lian Rufeng. He possessed a cultivation base of the Organ Opening Stage and was known for his ruthlessness.\u201cThat kid's blade must be a treasure since it could slice your whip in half in one slash,\u201d remarked Qian Qi.Lu Ting's whip was constructed from the spine of a water leopard and a hundred strands of golden silk. Although it wasn't considered a treasure, it was extremely flexible and impenetrable by ordinary blades.From this, it was easy to deduce that Lin Xun's weapon certainly was no ordinary item.\u201cOf course I know this. If that kid's blade wasn't that sharp, how would I have suffered such a humiliating loss?\u201d fumed Lu Ting. The thought of his defeat in front of everyone made his heart blaze like fire and almost drove him into a frenzy.\u201cHe's just a youngster but not only does he know the art of rune, he also possesses a cultivation base of the second True Martial Stage as well as a treasured blade. This is indeed strange.\u201d Qian Qi said with scrunched brows. \u201cHave you investigated his background?\u201dLu Ting shook his head. \u201cI heard from Xiao Tianren that he came to Feiyun Village on his own initiative, and no one knows about his past.\u201dQian Qi snorted. \u201cYou believe that?\u201d<sub>Try the elworld.com platform_for the most advanced_reading experience.</sub>Lu Ting was taken aback before he said through gritted teeth, \u201cDo you mean that old man Xiao Tianren deliberately concealed the little trash's background?\u201dQian Qi smiled without responding.Lu Ting reddened in fury. \u201cThat old thing! It never crossed my mind that he would dare play such a move on us!\u201dQian Qi narrowed his eyes, looking like a snake hiding in the dark. \u201cIt won't be too late to deal with that old thing when Big Brother Lian Rufeng and the others return. Our priority now is to get rid of Lin Xun.\u201dLu Ting felt his spirits lift instantly. \u201cI've been waiting for you to say this. There will no doubt be trouble as long as that boy remains. When do you plan to act?\u201dQian Qi leisurely sipped the wine and whispered, \u201cIt's not the time to ruin our relationship with Xiao Tianren yet. If we want to kill Lin Xun, we have to find a good opportunity.\u201dLu Ting frowned. \u201cHow long do we have to wait then?\u201dQian Qi smiled. \u201cDo you remember Sun Mazi's aeth grain plantations?\u201dLu Ting answered without any hesitation, \u201cOf course I remember. It's at the bottom of a mountain slope just over twenty miles from the village, and on the other side of it is Fiery Smoke Mountain.\u201dQian Qi nodded. \u201cCorrect, from what I know, in about five days, Lin Xun will set off with Sun Mazi to exterminate worms in his fields.\u201dLu Ting's face lit up with understanding and he sounded pleasantly surprised as he said, \u201cYou mean you want to act that day?\u201dQian Qi smiled. \u201cIsn't that a good opportunity? We should lure Sun Mazi away first, and then kill Lin Xun together and throw his body into the abandoned mine at the bottom of Fiery Smoke Mountain. After that, who would know we did it? Even if Xiao Tianren asks us, we can say we don't know anything.\u201dLu Ting grinned sinisterly. \u201cThen I will wait another five days. In five days, I can bury his corpse with my own hands!\u201dLin Xun sat down cross-legged the instant he got home. He breathed steadily until there were no more distracting thoughts in his mind. Then, he focused on the mysterious blood-red door in his mind.Boom!Soon, Lin Xun felt his whole body quivering as if he had been struck by lightning, and his consciousness blurred as if his body no longer belonged to him.By the time he regained consciousness, he was situated in an unfamiliar space. It was pitch black and silent making it seem like time didn't pass there.At his foot was a huge path that led straight ahead. The path, which seemed to be formed from azure clouds, looked incredibly mysterious.At the end of the path stood a blood-red door.<sub>Visit elworld.com for a better_reading experience</sub>The door seemed to be standing in nothingness. Standing at over thirty meters tall, the door was entirely red like it had just been fished up from a sea of blood and resembled a portal to hell.An unfamiliar space, a straight azure cloud path, and a mysterious blood-red door\u2026Everything felt both real and illusionary!Lin Xun drew several deep breaths in an attempt to calm himself. Only then did he realize that the blood-red door at the end of the azure cloud path was identical to the mysterious door that appeared in his mind.Lin Xun vaguely had the idea that his appearance there was connected to the mysterious door in his mind.What secrets were hidden beyond there?Was there something there that could defy heaven and change his fate?Lin Xun pondered for a good while and ultimately shook his head. He stepped forward, hoping to find out after passing through the mysterious blood-red door.But a bizarre rumble and a wave of energy spread out from below.The wave was so strange and simply swept over Lin Xun and vanished without a trace.Immediately after, a light screen emerged a foot in front of Lin Xun. It glistened and emitted dazzling light as a mysterious and complicated pattern emerged within it.Startled, Lin Xun did not dare to step forward and only stared at the light screen.It was then that a clear, icy, and emotionless voice reverberated throughout the world.\u201cIf you want to get close to the Omega Door, you need to pass the nine tests of the 'Great Azure Cloud Path'.\"\u201cThe first is called Spirit Refining.

He also was worried about the consequences he would face if he were to fail.However, he was certain that his success would be rewarded with the Little Divine Meditation Art and he would be one step closer to the Omega Door, the blood-red door at the end of the Great Azure Cloud Path.'Should I do it or not?'No one was around at such a time to advise Lin Xun on what to do.

Even if he didn't know who was speaking, a polite manner was the best when asking for help.However, no one answered him no matter how long he waited. Only the light screen continued to emit dazzling light before him.\u201cIt seems that I need to make a decision myself.\u201dLin Xun sighed inwardly, but his eyes suddenly flashed a resolute glint. He was never an indecisive person.Since such an opportunity was right in front of him, he wouldn't be happy if he didn't give it a try!\u201cLet's do it!\u201d Lin Xun spat out.It was like a signal. The previous clear and icy voice rang once again, \u201cThe test now begins. Only when you comprehend and master the Flowing Light Rune will it be considered a pass.\u201d'Flowing Light Rune?''To think the test was to evaluate my skill in drawing runes?'While Lin Xun stood there puzzled, the light screen in front of him rippled like it was awakening.Soon, Lin Xun saw a complex and obscure rune pattern shining within the light screen. Each rune rippled livelily like streams of dancing light, dazzling his eyes.<sub>For more_novel, visit elworld.com</sub>Mesmerized, Lin Xun subconsciously stepped forward, staring even more intently.Lin Xun had started to follow Mister Lu from a young age and as a result, he had developed a strong understanding of the art of runes.Runes could also be called rune patterns and each one exhibited a different ability or power.They were divided into basic and advanced based on the specific rune's power.Basic runes were those with just a single rune pattern, such as the fire rune, azure wood rune, and the aged gold Rune.Advanced runes were also called rune formations and were composed of several basic rune patterns.To put it simply, rune masters tended to call basic runes and advanced runes as rune patterns and rune formations, respectively.This naming system was related to the classification between rune apprentice and rune master.In the cultivation world, a person who could skillfully control thirty-six basic rune patterns was called elementary rune apprentices, and those able to successfully master seventy-two basic rune patterns were called intermediate rune apprentices. Anyone who mastered 108 or over was considered an expert rune apprentice.As for runemasters, only those able to solely complete a rune formation were considered qualified.Of course, Lin Xun had no knowledge of such titles, but he was very familiar with various basic runes.In his years of following Mister Lu, his daily life inevitably involved drawing runes. By now, he had mastered over one thousand rune patterns.However, they were all basic runes. Given his current cultivation base, he could only draw basic runes.But even so, other rune masters' jaws would drop when they learned that Lin Xun had mastered over one thousand runes at the age of thirteen.After all, anyone who mastered 108 basic runes was called an expert rune apprentice.This clearly demonstrated Lin Xun's extraordinary mastery of basic runes.It was a pity that Mister Lu had never told Lin Xun about the different classifications. Moreover, Mister Lu acted dismissive every time Lin Xun asked about it.However, no matter how Lin Xun racked his brain, he had never heard of Flowing Light Rune in the world of basic runes!Despite that lack of knowledge, Lin Xun could tell from a glance that the rune within the light screen was a basic rune and not a rune formation.It was just that he had never heard of the name Flowing Light Rune before, nor had Mister Lu mentioned a word about it to him either.Of course, Lin Xun knew the number of basic runes in the world was as vast as the open sea, and although he had no understanding of it, it didn't mean it was nonexistent.<sub>The most up-to-date nov_els are published_here > elworld.com</sub>He organized his thoughts. Now that he knew that the first level of the Great Azure Cloud Path only involved a basic rune pattern, his heart quivered.Without any hesitation, Lin Xun began to concentrate.It was only when he started to comprehend the basic rune that he realized his mistake. A ridiculous mistake!The Flowing Light Rune was moving endlessly in different tracks like a thousand streams of dancing light.Each one was incredibly mysterious, but when the thousand tracks repeatedly crossed and overlapped one another, it was no longer mysterious, and instead looked complex and obscure!One glance at it could blur a person's vision and make it impossible to figure out anything. Looking at it longer would make the person confused, annoyed, and even vomit blood from being unable to bear the stress.Although Lin Xun was thin and frail, he had a tough mind, which was an essential quality for a rune apprentice.If a practitioner's spirit wasn't strong enough, it would be difficult to comprehend and control rune patterns.Therefore, not all cultivators were suitable to become a rune master. This was also one of the reasons for the low number of rune masters in the world.The Flowing Light Rune, however, even made Lin Xun feel like his head was swelling, and began to feel extremely exhausted.Lin Xun couldn't control his shock because he realized that he had underestimated the Flowing Light Rune.Although it was indeed a basic rune, it was extremely unique and completely different from the foundation in runes that Lin Xun had grasped.The vein lines and tracks of every basic rune he had previously encountered were traceable. Even the more complicated patterns weren't too difficult to understand.Most importantly, basic runes were always in a static state!This was common sense because every basic rune possessed unique rune veins and fixed tracks. When drawing a rune, if its vein lines and tracks deviated, it would be impossible for it to display its power and would be equivalent to failure.It was similar to writing in that each word had a different meaning and a wrong stroke expressed a different word and made the word lose its meaning.But the Flowing Light Rune broke Lin Xun's conventional thinking. It was the first time he realized that rune patterns could actually 'move'!However, even if he learned that the Flowing Light Rune's vein lines and tracks could and did change, how could he possibly draw it?Once a rune was drawn, it should have a fixed track and vein lines!Lin Xun was increasingly astonished the more he thought about it. The Flowing Light Rune was becoming progressively more unusual to his eyes. He felt that no other basic rune in the current cultivation world could likely compare to it.It was too unique. It destroyed the conventional standard and had its own new style!<sub>New_chap_ters are pub_lished on elworld.com</sub>'Is it still considered a rune pattern?'Lin Xun knitted his brows in deep thought for a good while but still couldn't come to an answer.Then, he stopped pondering over that question and focused on studying.Time flew by before he knew it. Lin Xun felt his head become increasingly swollen and heavy, and his mind was under tremendous pressure.Both his vision and heart were filled with the tracks of dancing runes, which were so concentrated, so complex, so chaotic\u2026Vaguely, Lin Xun seemed to notice streams of flowing light streaking across the dark sky, some dim, some bright, some long as a strand of silk, and some as short as feathers\u2026But regardless of what kind of flowing light they were, they vanished like fireworks in a flash.Faintly, Lin Xun grasped an idea that flashed through his mind, and subconsciously, he lifted his finger and gently drew on the light screen.Like a brush, his fingertip lightly and gracefully stroked the light screen, creating faint marks that proudly danced about as soon as they appeared.As Lin Xun continued to draw, several marks emerged one after another, each one lively and quick as they constantly fluttered on the light screen.Soon, an astonishing scene appeared. The runes that were originally dancing energetically on the light screen, like a coordinated school of fish moving together, suddenly gathered around the marks that Lin Xun made.A slight smile curled Lin Xun's lips. 'As I thought!'He continued to swirl his finger, creating more and more marks on the light screen. Soon, when he saw the light screen could no longer support anymore, he suddenly flicked his finger.Buzz\uff01Following a strange buzz, the countless rune marks began to gather and combine on the light screen.In the end, they all merged into the one under Lin Xun's fingertip.Boom!Immediately after, the entire light screen broke down into a rain of light and vanished.Lin Xun put his hand away knowing that he had comprehended the secrets of the Flowing Light Rune.The secret was that the Flowing Light Rune wasn't a basic rune, but instead, a passed down technique!It was just that someone had used the art of runes to integrate the mystery of the technique into each of the rune vein lines!<sub>Foll_ow current_novel on elworld.com</sub>The name of that technique was precisely the Little Divine Meditation Art!Lin Xun muttered, \u201cIt should be called the Inheritance Rune instead. Who would invent a new rune pattern just to pass on a technique? This person is incredible\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He swept his eyes along the Great Azure Cloud Path that led to the Omega Door and he shook his head.The first level of the Great Azure Cloud Path was called Spirit Refining and it tested a cultivator's control and mastery of runes. Lin Xun had successfully passed that level and acquired the Little Divine Meditation Art.There were still another eight levels after the Spirit Refining, all of which he had to pass before he reached the Omega Door.But he didn't have the confidence to be able to pass them all in one go.\u201cDao seeker, the next time the Omega Secret-Realm opens will be three months from now. The second test of the Great Azure Cloud Path is called Body Tempering.\u201dThe clear, icy voice rang again, detached and devoid of emotions. It was unknown where it came from.\u201cThere will be one hundred and eight chances to break through. If you fail, the secret realm will return to a sealed state until an opportunity comes to open it again in one thousand years. Please make preparations to pass.\u201dAs the voice began to fade and before Lin Xun could respond, everything before him darkened into nothingness. With a thud, his consciousness plunged into boundless darkness.The rays of the setting sun lingered.There were the sounds of someone panting for breath from Lin Xun's house.He looked like he had just been rescued from drowning. His body was drenched in cold sweat and he felt indescribably fatigued.However, his eyes were unusually bright.He quietly recalled everything he had just experienced. He only believed everything that happened to be true when he detected the presence of the Little Divine Meditation Art in his heart!The blood-red door floating in his mind turned out to be called the Omega Door!The mysterious world, the straight Great Azure Cloud Path, and the clear, icy voice...They all came from a place called the Omega Secret-Realm!Lin Xun was absolutely certain that the Omega Secret-Realm was the secret that Mister Lu had mentioned before. In other words, Lin Xun had finally found the opportunity to change his destiny!Thinking of this, Lin Xun couldn't control his excitement. His Origin Aeth Artery was removed from him at a young age and caused him to be mediocre in cultivation. This was a nightmare for him. Despite his original optimistic personality, he had felt depressed for years.<sub>Visit elworld.com, for the best no_vel_read_ing experience</sub>It was completely different now\u2014he finally saw hope!\u201cMister Lu, thank you!\u201d Lin Xun murmured after inhaling deeply. Whenever he thought about Mister Lu, whose whereabouts and status were unknown, he couldn't help feeling both grateful and upset.Soon, a pungent smell made Lin Xun scrunch up his nose and frown fiercely. It was only then that he realized he was soaked in dirty black sweat.Lin Xun sprang up and went out to wash in the well in his courtyard. He felt refreshed, and energy seemed to seep out from every inch of his skin.When he returned to his room, he carefully examined his body and found that his thin body seemed to have been refined again. His skin, muscles, bones, flesh and blood, and even his internal organs were full of life force and vitality.Bang!His heart fluttered. He lunged forward and threw his fist out, performing the move Sky Ravaging Flames. The strength of his fist was condensed, and the physical strength alone was enough to create a sonic boom in the air!\u201cAs expected, my physical strength is different from before,\u201d exclaimed Lin Xun.He deduced that his body transformation was also linked to the Omega Secret-Realm.The refining and strengthening of a practitioner's body were essential to the cultivation path.For example, physically weak cultivators would never obtain great achievements in cultivation even if their training went smoothly.The reason was very simple\u2014a weak body couldn't support much aeth power.Generally speaking, cultivators often spent a lot of effort at the beginning of cultivation to strengthen their bodies and consolidate the foundation of their martial arts.Disciples of the great sects would even consume elixirs and decoctions made from various pills and medicinal ingredients to temper their bodies. As they grew up, they would be taught body refining methods to strengthen their muscles, bones, organs, qi, and blood in order to improve their physique and body.All those preparations were necessary for cultivation!What did an expert mean?Experts were those able to go farther and higher on the road of cultivation!This was a common view shared by the whole world.Lin Xun was very frail since young due to the damage to his four heart acupuncture points, and no amount of elixirs could improve his condition.But that had changed. For the first time, Lin Xun experienced what it meant to have powerful bodily strength and vitality!Forcibly suppressing his excitement, Lin Xun sat cross-legged on the bed and began to examine his body from the inside.<sub>The most up-to-date nov_els are published_here > elworld.com</sub>Wisps of aeth power coursed along his meridians and constantly circulated around his body like streams.Huh?Lin Xun's heart trembled as he noticed a slight abnormality. His aeth power was almost half of what it was before!How could that be?Lin Xun furrowed his brows. He was now at the Inner Strengthening layer and the amount of aeth power his body could hold had long reached its peak. If his four heart acupuncture points were undamaged, he likely would have already broken through to the Organ Opening layer.Although his cultivation path had stagnated for two years, his aeth power in the second True Martial Stage was refined to an extremely solid state, and only a few people at the same level as him could match it.This was one of his strong points that he often comforted himself with.However, his aeth power had been reduced by almost half!Without time to think about other things, Lin Xun immediately performed the Yuan Holding Art and began to regulate his breathing.The Yuan Holding Art was a training technique that Mister Lu taught him. Focusing on purity and tranquility, it involved the concealment of spirit and qi and followed a gentle and peaceful approach.Lin Xun's four heart acupuncture points had been damaged since young and led to his meridians being lifeless and fragile. Although the technique wasn't one of the best, it was most suitable for Lin Xun.As he operated the technique, he soon discovered the reason for his lack of aeth power\u2014the four heart acupuncture points!Whenever his aeth power entered the four heart acupuncture points, it would transform into Aeth Power Vortex and any aeth power passed through the vortex would be refined.The amount of aeth power appeared to be reduced after refining but it was instead much more condensed, similar to an improvement in quality.The difference wouldn't be significant if it only happened once, but there were four Aeth Power Vortexes in Lin Xun's four heart acupuncture points, meaning every time he circulated his aeth power, it would be refined a total of four times.It could easily be imagined how such refining would raise the grade of the aeth power in Lin Xun's body.For example, if the aeth power in Lin Xun's body was iron, the refining was similar to tossing iron into a furnace. It would no doubt become an incomparably sharp treasured steel sword when removed from the furnace!\u201cNo wonder my aeth power has reduced. It's been refined four times. The aeth power's grade has also improved by four-fold\u2026\u201dAfter the initial shock, excitement filled Lin Xun's heart because he knew very well that the purer his aeth power got, the greater its grade and power!\u201cFrom the looks of it, I no longer have to worry about the damage in my four heart acupuncture points\u2026\u201dLin Xun's clear and bright eyes were filled with joy.<sub>This_content is taken from elworld.com</sub>This was definitely a blessing in disguise because the damage done to his four heart acupuncture points was unrepairable and almost made him unable to cultivate.Who would have thought that the damage would become four Aeth Power Vortexes and completely transform his cultivation in the future!Even Lin Xun himself felt surprised and almost couldn't believe it.It took a long time for Lin Xun to slowly calm his joy and excitement. He knew his rebirth had begun!Too many unbelievable things had happened since the previous night.First, the ancient book and brush triggered a series of shocking scenes. It then made Lin Xun watch a world-shaking battle from a long time ago.In the battle, a mighty figure broke the sky, shook the universe, and opened the galaxis door with one strike!Ultimately, he sighed, 'Time waits for no one.' His peerless bearing and aura still amazed Lin Xun.It was also at that time that Lin Xun found out that the mighty figure was the owner of the ancient book and dark gray brush.Then, the dark gray brush underwent a strange change and absorbed Lin Xun's blood to draw a strange pattern and made Lin Xun fall unconscious.By the time he had regained consciousness, the ancient book and dark gray brush were gone but the Omega Door had appeared in his mind.From then on, a series of changes began to happen to Lin Xun\u2026First, the four Aeth Power Vortexes appeared on his four heart acupuncture points and resolved his problems in cultivation. The damage resulting from the removal of his Origin Aeth Artery no longer hindered Lin Xun on his cultivation path.Then, Lin Xun broke into the Omega Secret-Realm, passed the first test of the Great Azure Cloud Path, also known as Spirit Refining, and obtained the Little Divine Meditation Art from the Flowing Light Rune.Finally, Lin Xun returned from the Omega Secret-Realm and his previous frail body underwent a complete transformation. It not only grew incredibly powerful but was also filled with life force.He couldn't believe everything that had happened.However, Lin Xun knew that regardless of how unbelievable it seemed, everything happened only because of Mister Lu!\u201cDefy the heavens, change my destiny, and be reborn\u2026The person who took my Origin Aeth Artery would never think I'm still alive, right!?\u201dLin Xun's eyes grew cold.He almost lost his life when his Origin Aeth Artery was removed. To this day, he still didn't know who his parents were.

He couldn't care about anything else at that moment and darted into the kitchen to cook something up.Only then did he realize that it was getting late and he hadn't had any food in the entire day.His kitchen had been renovated and the friendly villagers had gifted him with pots and pans as well as marinated beast meat.Lin Xun quickly cooked a pot of aeth grains, sliced some meat, and enjoyed them while squatting in the kitchen.Aeth grains contained gentle aeth power and were an essential food for cultivation. However, for the majority of the villagers in Feiyun Village who didn't cultivate, aeth grains were only used to exchange for other supplies. They were extremely precious and the villagers wouldn't treat them as food.As for the wild beast meat, they were all from wild animals in the mountains. They could satisfy a person's hunger but couldn't be compared to aeth grainsUnexpectedly, Lin Xun was still hungry even after devouring three pots of wild beast meat and ten bowls of aeth grains.His sudden increase in appetite greatly surprised him but he couldn't help feeling happy since it was a sign that his body had changed and he needed more nutrition than in the past.The more he ate, the stronger his body, mind, blood, and qi became. Legend had it that cultivators in the Ziyao Empire not only enjoyed huge amounts of aeth grains but also aeth vegetables and fruits as well as specially made pills.As a cultivator, Lin Xun naturally understood the reason behind this.However, a problem came to his mind when he finished eating and glanced at the half-filled bag of aeth grains and six chunks of beast meat left.If he continued to eat like that three times a day, he could easily consume over three kilograms of aeth grains and ten chunks of wild beast meat daily.Most importantly, Lin Xun still needed the Feiyun villagers to supply him with such foods. It would be fine if it were for a few days but it didn't seem right in the long term.\u201cI can't live without any food!\u201dLin Xun sighed inwardly. As the people said, children from poor families had no resources to cultivate and their families could never afford the materials needed for cultivation.This also aligned with the old saying that the four elements of cultivation were wealth, companionship, methods, and land. Since wealth was first, it showed how important it was in cultivation.Not only that, cultivators required huge financial power to support their need for pills, techniques, treasures, and equipment for battles.<sub>Visit to elworld.com discover_new novels.</sub>Lin Xun was now penniless. He had no other possessions other than some materials he had collected.Therefore, he had to make some money in order to solve his current problem and for his cultivation in the future!Of course, aeth grains and beast meat were equal to money in Feiyun Village.The harvest of aeth grains required a long time and so Lin Xun could only focus on the wild beast meat.Lin Xun knew the stronger members of Feiyun Village would hunt together in the mountains in the slow seasons. The fur and flesh that they obtained not only supported their daily needs but were also transported to the Qingyang tribe and exchanged for other supplies.\u201cHunting? I can give it a try.\u201dLin Xun made up his mind. He might not be able to hunt down powerful savage beasts but he could easily deal with ordinary ones.In truth, Lin Xun was thinking about his future. He had to have money to reach the city of the Ziyao Empire in the future.The night was dark.Lin Xun sat quietly in his residence, trying to comprehend the several obscure and mysterious words flashing across like strands of light.The Little Divine Meditation Art, a spirit refining technique, was divided into three great stages: Star Cycle, Moon Phases, and Sun Illumination.The name 'Little Divine Meditation Art' indicated the importance of using the mind to understand the secret of spirit refining in order to sharpen a cultivator's spirit and strengthen their soul.It was a rare cultivation art!The number of different types of cultivation arts in the world was as many as the stars in the galaxy.But 99% of them were either arts to improve aeth power or for battle.There were very few techniques that involved a practitioner's spirit. Moreover, the majority of those were only found in ancient clans and families and rarely seen on the market.Generally, such techniques were called Spirit Arts and were highly desired by all cultivators.The reason was that a cultivator had to start cultivating their spirit to consolidate their Lifewill once they broke through the True Martial, Spirit Dipper, and Spirit Sea Stages and reached the Heaven Ascension Stage!<sub>This_content is taken from elworld.com</sub>Only a cultivator who had consolidated their Lifewill and mastered the control of their aeth power could become a true Heaven Ascension expert.At that point, the practitioner could subdue cultivators below the Heaven Ascension Stage with the power of their Lifewill alone and make them tremble on their knees.However, the Heaven Ascension Stage was far too hard for many to ever reach. It was rare to see even one in one thousand people reach that stage.In the Ziyao Empire, those who possessed Heaven Ascension power could join the ranks of the top martial arts experts!This demonstrated the importance of mastering Spirit Arts since it concerned whether a cultivator could successfully break through to the Heaven Ascension Stage.The Little Divine Meditation Art, which Lin Xun obtained, could be called an unparalleled Spirit Art in the world.It was no exaggeration to even say that not even one in a million cultivators of the True Martial Stage could practice a Spirit Art!Lin Xun had followed Mister Lu everywhere since he was a child so he knew about the value of Spirit Art much better than other people.After all, Lin Xun had another identity \u2014 he was a rune apprentice!The carving of runes required the support of tremendous aeth power. Otherwise, it would be impossible to precisely control the coordination between the cultivator's aeth power, rune ink, rune brush, and the vessel.From what Lin Xun knew, the stronger a rune master, the greater that cultivator's aeth power. This was indisputable.After controlling his excitement and emotions, Lin Xun began to study the Star Cycle, the first level of the Little Divine Meditation Art.As the name suggested, Star Cycle involved the cycle of stars.Using their own self-consciousness, cultivators had to visualize the wonders of the great emptiness of the universe and the cycle of stars, and then, cross the path of stars and draw upon the brilliance of stars to refine their spirit.Once the practitioner reached the perfection stage, that person could turn their mind-sea into the vast starry sky with one thought. The illumination of stars would allow their spirit to roam freely and prevent it from being imprisoned by evil desires or restrained by distracting thoughts. Ultimately, it could form spirit roots!However, Lin Xun had only just started and naturally wasn't at that level yet.The Little Divine Meditation Art didn't just consist of three great stages, the Star Cycle, Moon Phases, and Sun Illumination, it also involved the cultivation of the cultivator's spirit. Each stage was profound and contained infinite mysteries. It was impossible to fully understand everything overnight.As Lin Xun began to study the Star Cycle, a vast night sky emerged in his mind-sea. However the night sky was far and unreachable, and the stars were blurry and dim.This was the image of the Star Cycle, and Lin Xun had to visualize this image with his mind and then explore further.<sub>Visit to elworld.com discover_new novels.</sub>This was the so-called 'visualization'.The process of visualization was similar to a mirror in that it reflected a person's self. This was the only method in the world to cultivate Spirit Arts, but there were different ways of visualization.For example, Lin Xun was visualizing the image of the Star Cycle in his mind-sea. Only when he could light up all the stars in the night sky with his aeth power would he reach the Star Cycle's perfection stage.The night was quiet and the moon was shining brightly outside the window. The mountains were bathed in pure light, and the cicadas chirped in harmony. It was extremely peaceful.Lin Xun sat cross-legged in his residence, silently thinking without any distractions. His pale and handsome face was particularly still and peaceful.Time flew by and a night quickly passed. Morning rays lit up the world, dispelling the dark night.Birds sang outside the window, a sign of a new day, and woke Lin Xun from his meditation. He got out of bed but he felt unusually energetic and his blood and qi flowed without obstruction.After a night of training, despite failing to light a single star in the mind-sea, his mood was much better than before. His eyes and ears were much sharper and more sensitive. He could distinctly hear the subtle sound of water drops rolling off leaves and onto the ground.This was a sign of his consciousness growing stronger. Lin Xun had never thought he would achieve such a visible result after only one night of practice. The Little Divine Meditation Art was indeed extraordinary.Lin Xun pushed open the door and walked into the courtyard. After stretching his body, he practiced the Marching Army Fist Art until his body was dripping with sweat. He rinsed himself with the ice-cold water from the well. Both his body and spirit were full of vitality as though they contained inexhaustible energy.However, a wave of hunger flooded his body like the tide. He couldn't help but smile bitterly. It was indeed a happy event that his body and spirit were growing stronger, but with it, his appetite had doubled. Indeed, nothing was perfect in the world.Lin Xun was even more determined to find an opportunity to hunt in the mountains! Otherwise, he couldn't fill his stomach with just the food from the villagers alone.After breakfast, Lin Xun headed straight to villager Zhou Zhong's residence. He had made plans to exterminate the worms in Zhou Zhong's plantations earlier.Zhou Zhong came out with a longbow and a huge blade on his back just as Lin Xun arrived.\u201cBig Brother Zhou Zhong, what are you doing?\u201d asked Lin Xun.\u201cTo collect some herbal ingredients that enrich blood and qi up in the mountains, and also do some hunting while I'm up there.\u201d Zhou Zhong responded without thinking.Soon he noticed that it was Lin Xun asking him. He slapped his forehead and exclaimed, \u201cHow could I forget that I'm taking you to the plantations to exterminate the worms today.\u201dHunting?<sub>This_content is taken from elworld.com</sub>What a coincidence!Lin Xun smiled.FavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He had promised Zhou Zhong to exterminate the worms in his plantations when he returned from hunting if Zhou Zhong agreed to let him join the hunt.Naturally, Zhou Zhong happily agreed.Zhou Zhong's wife had caught a cold earlier and had only just recovered, but her body was still quite weak. She urgently needed to nourish her qi and blood.Therefore, Zhou Zhong's main purpose in going into the mountains was to collect medicinal herbs with qi and blood replenishing properties. Hunting was only next in importance.As an experienced hunter in Feiyun Village, Zhou Zhong was very well aware of the dangers in the mountains, and so he asked some strong villagers to join him even if he was just going to collect medicinal ingredients.Zhou Zhong wasn't particularly worried about Lin Xun, who had insisted on participating. He had heard how Lin Xun defeated Lu Ting and knew Lin Xun was likely much stronger than all the villagers.The group set off, and it took them at least an hour to reach the foot of the mountains even with Zhou Zhong leading the way.As far as the eye could see were mountains piercing the clouds and towering into the sky. All of the mountains were shrouded in dense clouds from midway up.The roar of beasts echoed faintly in the mountains, filling people with terror.\u201cEveryone, be careful. The ancient forest in the mountains is incredibly dangerous. Not only are there fierce beasts, but also disease-carrying insects. Follow me closely and don't run off by yourself.\u201dBefore the vast forest, Zhou Zhong gripped his bow and vigilantly scanned the surroundings.The other villagers simultaneously drew their weapons with solemn expressions.Although they all had strong bodies, they were only ordinary people and not cultivators. They had to be on constant alert in such a place.After a thought, Lin Xun also took out his azure blade.The group was ready. They stepped into the vast forest and soon disappeared.The forest was enormous with ancient trees towering into the sky. Their flourishing leaves and branches created a canopy, making the atmosphere dim and humid.Vines as thick as a bucket hung all over the forest like pythons. Leaves were piled high on the ground with strange yet enchanting flowers and there were plants that were clearly extremely poisonous growing from them.<sub>Foll_ow new_episo_des on the elworld.com platform.</sub>Zhou Zhong and the others tensed up as they cautiously moved forward. No one dared to utter a word in fear of attracting attacks from poisonous insects or beasts.However, Lin Xun looked very relaxed and even had the mood to admire the scenery along the way. He occasionally crouched down to pick some flowers and plants.\u201cLustrous Purple Flower, Jade Star Plant, Three-Leaf Silver Thread Vine, Scarlet Tail Bitter Root... I didn't expect to find so many rune materials in this ancient forest.\u201dLin Xun was enjoying his time in the mountains. As a rune apprentice, Lin Xun had handled various rune materials since young. Naturally, he could identify what was good and bad with one glance.Taking advantage of his experience and sharp eyes, he spotted many rune materials along the way. Many of them could be used as medicine or refined into rune ink.Of course, he could also sell them!This was an unexpected surprise to Lin Xun. Unfortunately, it was difficult to exchange rune materials for some loose change in Feiyun Village, let alone fill up his stomach, as there was no market for them.Lin Xun carried an animal skin sack, which was at least as long as an average person, so he wouldn't have to worry about storing any rune materials he found.When Zhou Zhong noticed that Lin Xun was picking flowers and plants from time to time along the way, he couldn't help but ask, \u201cLittle Brother Lin Xun, what do you pick those things for?\u201dZhou Zhong wasn't the only one who had been curious as the other villagers had also found it perplexing.Lin Xun didn't try to conceal the value of the rune materials he found and explained each one to the villagers, making them look more confused.However, their faces immediately lit up when they heard that such things could be sold for good money, and they all asked Lin Xun for advice to point them out.Lin Xun readily agreed. Under Lin Xun's guidance, the villagers began to search for rune materials along the way.The saying 'strength lies in numbers' was indeed true. In less than the time it took to burn an incense stick, Lin Xun's animal skin sack was already filled to the brim.It was clear that the vast forest was full of various kinds of rune materials despite its remote and dangerous location.Of course, if Lin Xun hadn't come along with them, they wouldn't know about the value of those flowers and plants.While everyone was marching ahead in great spirits, Lin Xun abruptly halted and signaled everyone to stop.Under the puzzled gazes of Zhou Zhong and others, Lin Xun suddenly grabbed the bow and arrow in Zhou Zhong's hand and climbed a nearby tree. Then he took a deep breath, drew the bow, and shot the sharp arrow into the distance.The villagers didn't understand what happened, but they had a feeling that a fierce beast must be approaching!All of a sudden, their nerves tightened and they were prepared to fight.<sub>Foll_ow new_episo_des on the elworld.com platform.</sub>Roar\u2014In just a few breaths, a deafening beast roar resounded like thunder from a distance and drove the birds out of the forest.\u201cThis is bad! It's a snow spotted leopard!\u201dZhou Zhong's expression dramatically changed. Given his years of hunting experience, he could identify a snow spotted leopard from its cry!Snow spotted leopards were as huge as an ox, had a pattern of dark spots on their snow-white fur, and were known for their vicious and cunning natures.Lian Rufeng, the Village Guard Leader, had once encountered a snow spotted leopard's attack. Despite the fact that Lian Rufeng was already at the Inner Strengthening Stage, he still almost died under a ravaging snow spotted leopard's fangs. This clearly demonstrated the snow spotted leopard's power and ability.As expected, the name snow spotted leopard made all the other villagers' complexions suddenly turn deathly pale. They tightened their grip around their weapons, looking extremely nervous.They didn't think that the peaceful and pleasant atmosphere would be destroyed by a snow spotted leopard. The situation was too dangerous. The slightest carelessness could cost them their lives.Shua!All of a sudden, a snow-white figure sped through the forests like a lightning bolt towards Zhou Zhong. It was so swift that their eyes could only see a slight blur as it leapt into the air.It was incredibly quick!Even if Zhou Zhong was constantly on guard, he still would have reacted too slowly. He had only raised his blade halfway when the creature's ferocious jaws were close to snapping him up.Just as Zhou Zhong was the slightest brink away from meeting death, the snow-white figure suddenly let out a pained roar and stiffened in the air before dropping to the ground.It was only then that everyone could clearly see it was indeed a snow spotted leopard. However, it had an arrow skewered through its hind leg and blood trickling down from it.Clearly, that arrow saved Zhou Zhong's life.Roar\u2014However, before everyone recovered from the shock, the snow spotted leopard unleashed an enraged roar. Its ferocity clearly hadn't diminished as it leapt into the air again.Like a signal of death, a stench assaulted their faces and made them draw back in fear and panic.Shua!Almost at the same time, an azure blade descended from above with a force capable of splitting Mount Hua and precisely slashed at the snow spotted leopard's neck from an angle.<sub>The most up-to-date nov_els are published_here > elworld.com</sub>Pu!A fountain of blood splattered three feet high as the snow spotted leopard's head hurled into the air. The beast lost complete control of its entire body and crashed to the ground.It died like that?Zhou Zhong and others were utterly shaken with disbelief. It was a snow spotted leopard. Even Lian Rufeng, who possessed an Inner Strengthening Stage cultivation base, almost lost his life to a snow spotted leopard, yet it died instantly in a single strike!While everyone was dumbstruck, Lin Xun came to the snow spotted leopard and thrust the tip of his short azure blade into the snow spotted leopard's chest. A jet of blood wildly gushed out. He took out another bag to collect the blood.A snow spotted leopard was no ordinary beast. Its heart contained extremely abundant power, which had remarkable effects when used to concoct medicine or simply consumed as is.It was only when the bag was filled that Lin Xun gave a hand signal and shook his head. \u201cEveryone, snow spotted leopard's blood is good stuff and mustn't be wasted.\u201dAs though they had just awoken from a dream, Zhou Zhong and others scurried over and took out their water sacks.\u201cLittle Brother Lin Xun, you're amazing. That's an adult snow spotted leopard. You can exchange its skin for ten copper coins in the Qingyang tribe. Snow spotted leopard's flesh is also very popular,\u201d exclaimed Zhou Zhong.The others simultaneously nodded as they gazed at Lin Xun with admiration. A thirteen-year-old boy was able to kill an adult snow spotted leopard alone, which was something they could never imagine doing.Lin Xun smiled. \u201cLet's quickly remove the valuable parts of the snow spotted leopard. The smell of blood is too strong. I'm worried that it will soon attract other fierce beasts.\u201dZhou Zhong and others nodded in agreement and immediately acted together to dissect the snow spotted leopard's skin, flesh, bones and tendons. Then, they used the huge leaves of a rotten fish plant to wrap them up and put them away in the animal skin sack.The rotten fish plant had a pungent smell and could mask the stench of blood. Thereby, they could prevent other beasts following them due to the smell of blood.Soon, Lin Xun and his party set off again.After that sudden attack, Zhou Zhong and others became even more cautious. They stopped collecting rune materials and fully concentrated on the surroundings as they moved forward.Lin Xun was the same as before, except that he had become more picky and selective in what he picked up. He had no interest in rune materials with little value.Most importantly, the animal skin bags they were carrying had limited space and so they had to discard some rune materials that were of little use.After traveling in silence for a long while, Zhou Zhong suddenly knitted his brows and whispered, \u201cSomething is wrong. Usually, I would encounter seven or eight wild beast attacks in this forest. But this time, apart from encountering a snow spotted leopard, there's nothing else. It's very strange.\u201dThe other villagers nodded. The situation did seem unusual.At that moment, Lin Xun seemed to have discovered something. He darted forward and suddenly halted behind a huge tree dozens of feet away.<sub>The source of this_chapter; elworld.com</sub>Soon, Lin Xun's voice sounded, \u201cLook, it seems someone has been here before us.\u201dZhou Zhong and others hurried over to see a lizard-like body covered with dark green scales lying on the ground behind the tree!FavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

They were divided into three types: wild beast, ferocious beast and savage beast.For example, jackals, minks, foxes, and mongooses were only considered wild beasts. Although they were fierce, ordinary hunters could kill them.Ferocious beasts included beasts such as tigers, leopards, wild boars, bulls and bears. Their vicious aggressiveness made them able to take on and even kill beginner cultivators.Savage beasts were completely different in that they were all overlords in the mountains and possessed considerable intelligence. Even the weakest savage beast could easily kill first layer True Martial Stage cultivators, while the strongest could make even ninth layer True Martial Stage cultivators flee in terror.The snow spotted leopard that Lin Xun and the others killed was precisely a savage beast.However, compared with the one-horned lizard before them, the snow spotted leopard could only be regarded as an ordinary savage beast. The lizard, on the other hand, could take down cultivators of the fifth True Martial Stage!In all the years that Zhou Zhong had hunted, he had never seen a one-horned lizard in person despite hearing about its terror many times.Fortunately, the one-horned lizard was dead. Otherwise, everyone might have lost their lives there.Lin Xun squatted down to examine the one-horned lizard's wounds.It was as huge as a bull and had four pillar-like hooves. Dark green scales covered its entire body apart from the crescent moon shaped horn on its head. However, the horn had been cleanly sawn off and a hole that was still oozing blood was left.Its throat had also been pierced, leaving a fist-sized hole. Given the clean edges of the hole and the position of the dead beast, Lin Xun speculated that a spear-like weapon instantly took the beast's life after it skewered through its throat!Thinking of this, fear filled Lin Xun's heart. Someone who could kill an adult one-horned lizard in one strike had to possess the strength of at least the fifth True Martial Stage!Could there be another strong cultivator in the mountains besides them?\u201cThe one who killed this beast is much stronger than our Village Guard Leader, Lian Rufeng.\u201dZhou Zhong and others gasped in astonishment.Lin Xun made a prompt decision and urged, \u201cWe should leave now.\u201d\u201cLeave now?\u201dZhou Zhong and others seemed taken aback.<sub>The source of this_chapter; elworld.com</sub>\u201cIf my guess is correct, that cultivator is very powerful and we are no match against them. The cultivator must have a certain purpose to appear in this ancient forest, and if we run into the cultivator, it's hard to guarantee that nothing will happen.\u201dLin Xun said casually, \u201cOf course, the cultivator might not want to make things difficult for us, but to be on the safe side, we better leave as soon as possible.\u201dZhou Zhong and others understood and quickly agreed.Before leaving, Lin Xun and the others dissected the one-horned lizard's corpse and stored its body parts into their animal skin sack.All parts of the one-horned lizard were considered treasures, especially its scales. Ordinary blades and swords couldn't penetrate them, so they were most suitable as armor-crafting materials. The scales could be sold for good money.In addition, its tendons, bones, flesh and blood had great nourishing properties, and its teeth and claws were ideal materials for making weapons.It was just a pity that the most valuable horn had already been taken.However, Lin Xun and others were already very satisfied with their harvest. It was already an unexpected surprise to come across a one-horned lizard's corpse.Zhou Zhong did not need to search for the medicinal ingredients he set off to find because, compared to any herbal ingredient he could find in the mountains, the one-horned lizard's blood and flesh had superior qi- and blood-nourishing properties.Everyone traveled back along the same path without stopping.While Lin Xun and others were leaving, a rumble echoed from the depths of the ancient forest, followed by towering trees being set ablaze and crashing to the ground.A tremendous wolf as red as fire bolted by so quickly that if anyone was still there, they would only see a blurred image. It barged through everything without even bothering to evade any obstacles in front of it and tore down trees along the way like it was on a rampage.If Lin Xun was there, he no doubt would recognize the lava wolf!It was a savage beast with great intelligence. It swallowed the essence of the sun and moon for its cultivation and could easily kill experts of the ninth True Martial Stage!However, the giant lava wolf looked terrified, as though it was being chased by an even more terrifying enemy.Clang!Suddenly, a silver light flashed across the sky like a star and tore through the air at unimaginable speed before vanishing without a trace.Roar\u2014The giant lava wolf charging at full speed unleashed an incomparably tragic roar before its tremendous body collapsed on the ground. The flames that shrouded its entire body incinerated all trees within a ten meter radius and charred the ground.The roar quickly faded and the lava wolf was already dead before it hit the ground. If someone looked closely, they would see that a ten foot long bone spear had pierced through its back and ruthlessly nailed its body to the ground.<sub>New novel_chap_ters are published here: elworld.com</sub>Immediately after, a little figure strode out from the depths of the forest. It was a girl who looked to be around six to seven years old.Her long black hair draped over her shoulders like a shawl and a dress made of old animal skins was wrapped around her slender body. Her feet were fair and bare. She looked like the descendant of a barbarian tribe.Her pure and fair face was stunning and delicate. Her dark eyes curved like the crescent moon and her every movement exuded an ethereal charm that didn't match her age.She came straight over to the giant lava wolf, and her little slender figure looked even smaller next to the giant lava wolf.She stepped on the giant lava wolf's back, stretched out her jade-like hand, and with a slight moment and a splatter of blood, removed the long bone spear dripping with blood.The bone spear was entirely white and exuded threads of silvery light as if it was filled with stars. It added an even more mysterious aura to the six to seven-year-old girl.The little girl was clearly the one who killed the giant wolf.How shocked would other cultivators be if they saw this scene?The little girl leaned over and searched the giant lava wolf's wound. She quickly retrieved a fiery red crystal that was the size of a pigeon egg.The girl couldn't help but grin widely when she saw the crystal. That brief smile was like a blooming flower bud after the rain, and it was so beautiful that it made the world appear dim in comparison.The girl planned to leave after acquiring the fire crystal, but something made her furrow her dark and straight eyebrows. She narrowed her eyes as she gazed into the depths of the forest.She faintly sensed a unique aura far away that made her spirit feel strange.The feeling wasn't repulsion or hatred, but a kind of longing and joy. It was very bizarre because she had never felt anything similar before. While she stood there in a daze, puzzlement filled her clear and deep crescent moon shaped eyes.Dong!Suddenly, the sky and ground quaked as the ancient forest rumbled. The beasts throughout the forest crouched down trembling.Snapping out of her thoughts, the girl abruptly turned her head and saw a ten foot tall figure coming her way.It was a majestic and burly black bear, but it moved like a little hill. The trees collapsed and the ground shook as it approached her.\u201cYiyi Yaya.\u201dAs though she had thought of something, the little girl motioned her hands and made a strange sound.The black bear halted its steps, but shook its head, seemingly in refusal.The little girl looked disappointed, but she clenched her teeth, leaped up and darted like a bullet in the opposite direction.<sub>You can_find the rest of this_content on the elworld.com platform.</sub>But soon, a huge paw lifted her into the air. It clutched her so tightly that she couldn't budge at all.\u201cYiyi Yaya.\u201dThe little girl yelled, but the black bear ignored her, and headed towards the depths of the forest.The little girl sat down in disappointment in the bear's paw as she gazed at a place that seemed to move farther and farther away with her little face full of confusion.On the way back from the forest, a tragic and thunderous roar rang from the deepest part of the forest, terrifying Lin Xun and his party, and their faces paled accordingly.\u201cLava wolf!\u201d\u201cHeavens! Don't tell me the cultivator who killed the one-horned lizard has now killed a giant lava wolf?\u201d\u201cThat cultivator must be at least at the Spirit Dipper Stage; otherwise it would be impossible to do so!\u201d\u201cSpirit Dipper Stage? Impossible, I heard that there is no Spirit Dipper cultivator even in the Qingyang tribe.\u201d\u201cThe noises are coming from the direction where we were going to go. Luckily, we didn't go there.\u201dEveryone was in an uproar and utterly shocked by this development.Lin Xun also felt like he had dodged a bullet. If he had rashly gone there, he might have been killed. However, he couldn't help but be curious about who killed the one-horned lizard and lava wolf. 'Where did the cultivator come from?'\u201cLet's leave this terrifying place as soon as possible. Today's operation is too abnormal. We shouldn't stay any longer.\u201d Zhou Zhong said with worry. The others naturally did not object.After the time it took to burn an incense stick, Lin Xun and the others walked out of the ancient forest and saw the blazing sun hanging high in the clear sky. It was already past noon.\u201cThe harvest this time isn't small!\u201d\u201cLet's go! Let's quickly get back to the village. We have such a great harvest this time, we should share with the others and celebrate together.\u201d\u201cHaha, you guys just can't wait to show off.\u201d\u201cSo what? I'm so glad I'm still alive. This is the first time in my life that I brought home the corpses of a snow spotted leopard and a one-horned lizard. They aren't something everyone has the chance to encounter!\u201dZhou Zhong and others were clearly relieved to leave the dark and dangerous forest. Their faces beamed when they looked at the stuffed sacks on their backs.Lin Xun turned around, staring quietly at the forest in the distance. He muttered to himself, \u201cWhat could be hidden there that could attract an expert powerful enough to kill a giant lava wolf?

They had hunted for many years and had killed many wild beasts, but it was their first time bringing a savage beast body home. It was easy to imagine their level of happiness.Lin Xun's courtyard was piled with his goods, including various types of rune materials.But the most eye-catching among them were the skin, bones, flesh and blood of the snow spotted leopard and one-horned lizard.All of the villagers were filled with amazement and envy when they saw his harvest.Although there were cultivators in the villagers such as Lian Rufeng, who was a third layer True Martial Stage expert, no one had ever hunted down a savage beast like the snow spotted leopard, let alone a one-horned lizard.The villagers' looks towards Lin Xun changed dramatically when they heard he killed the snow spotted leopard alone.A thirteen-year-old boy killed an adult snow spotted leopard by himself!This was like a legendary story to the villagers and they couldn't help but gain respect and awe for Lin Xun.\u201cZhou Zhong, you've gathered so many treasures. What do you plan to do with them?\u201d someone suddenly asked.Lin Xun, Zhou Zhong and the others had already discussed what to do with the collected rune materials. A small portion would be kept for Lin Xun's own use and the rest would be sold or exchanged for other supplies with the Qingyang tribe.As for the two savage beasts, the snow spotted leopard and one-horned lizard, their parts would be kept for the village and wouldn't be exchanged.After all, it wasn't easy to obtain such treasures. Who would have the heart to sell them?Zhou Zhong cast a glance at Lin Xuan and seeing that the boy was smiling and nodding, he straightened himself and said, \u201cEveryone, Little Brother Lin Xun and I have discussed this already. Although we were the ones who brought back the snow spotted leopard and one-horned lizard, we are all villagers of this village and are as close as real siblings. Therefore, everyone will be given a share of the two savage beasts' blood and flesh.\u201dAll of the villagers broke into cheers of joy. They had never thought something so good would happen.It should be said that although they were all villagers of Feiyun Village, each family owned their own properties. No one had ever brought out something so rare, such as the two savage beasts, to share with others like Lin Xun did.<sub>New novel_chap_ters are published here: elworld.com</sub>\u201cHahaha, since that's the case, we will each take a share of the snow spotted leopard's skin and blood and the one-horned lizard's scales!\u201dSuddenly, the crowd parted and Lu Ting stormed through as he cast greedy looks at the snow spotted leopard and one-horned lizard.Behind Lu Ting was Qian Qi, who looked slim and fierce. He coldly scanned around with his arms folded, but his eyes blazed with excitement as they swept across the harvest.Suddenly, the atmosphere became tense, and many people knitted their brows together in a frown.The things that Lu Ting was eyeing were the most valuable parts of the snow spotted leopard and one-horned lizard. The way he demanded them directly naturally drew disgust from the villagers.Even Zhou Zhong's expression wasn't particularly friendly. He had said very clearly that he would share the blood and flesh of the two beasts and not other parts.Lu Ting didn't seem to notice other people's gazes. He stepped forward and was about to take what he wanted.Zhou Zhong couldn't stand it anymore and snapped, \u201cStop! These aren't yours!\u201dLu Ting frowned, his face ferocious. \u201cIdiot, you're not a cultivator, how would you use such treasures? They can only fully show its value in my hands.\u201dWhile speaking, he arrogantly and aggressively grabbed a piece of the snow spotted leopard skin.Clang!An azure blade flashed in front of Lu Ting, causing him to freeze and his facial muscles twitched. He straightened his body and looked ahead to see Lin Xun standing in front with eyes filled with fury. \u201cDo you want a fight?\u201dBefore his voice faded, Qian Qi strolled over from a distance with his arms folded. His expression was unpleasantly cold.The atmosphere immediately tensed further.Lin Xun smiled. \u201cI killed those beasts. Have I agreed to you taking some?\u201dAlthough smiling, he firmly pointed the short azure blade at Lu Ting.\u201cYes, these are Little Brother Lin Xun's spoils.\u201d\u201cLu Ting, you've gone too far.\u201dAn intense discussion broke out.The villagers had treated Lin Xun as part of them ever since he helped them exterminate worms in their fields. They wouldn't watch Lu Ting bully him and do nothing.<sub>Foll_ow current_novel on elworld.com</sub>Lu Ting's face darkened as he shouted violently, \u201cShut up! What right do you have to intervene? If Big Brother Lian Rufeng and I hadn't guarded the village, you would have died long ago! But you dare help an outsider instead of me. Do you not want to live anymore!\u201dThe villagers' faces blanched, but they were inwardly shocked and furious. However, they had to admit that they had indeed depended on Lu Ting to transport goods to the Qingyang tribe in exchange for the supplies they needed to live.But in the past few years, Lu Ting and the others had brought back fewer and fewer supplies, and that had long sparked dissatisfaction and complaints among the villagers.Unfortunately, the villagers had to suppress their anger and tolerate them because they still needed Lu Ting and the others to go to the Qingyang tribe to exchange for supplies to survive.Seeing that no one objected, Lu Ting grinned triumphantly, but his expression darkened when he looked at Lin Xun.\u201cBoy, give me a straightforward answer, are you going to give me it or not?\u201d Lu Ting evidently spoke in a threatening tone.Qian Qi also stared at Lin Xun, his gaze cold and terrifying.He originally didn't plan to tear into Lin Xun's face in the village so as not to arouse public anger, but when he saw the snow spotted leopard and one-horned lizard, he couldn't suppress his greed anymore and didn't care about anything else.If Lin Xun dared to refuse to back down, Qian Qi didn't mind teaching him a lesson in front of everyone!Lin Xun naturally noticed Qian Qi's unfriendly gaze, and couldn't help but sneer inwardly. 'These two are too arrogant. They even dare to snatch things so confidently and rightfully.'\u201cYou want it? It's easy, beat me first!\u201dLin Xun uttered casually, his expression relaxed and calm, and a hint of a smile played on his lips.\u201cYou want to die!\u201dLu Ting smiled sinisterly and shot an imperceptible furtive glance at Qian Qi. However, Qian Qi understood thoroughly and strolled forward, blocking Lin Xun's way of retreat.Seeing this, the villagers all fumed about how shameless and arrogant Lu Ting and Qian Qi were actingi.Worried by this development, Zhou Zhong asked Lin Xun in a quiet voice, \u201cHow about...we just give them some?\u201dWhat he intended to say was the saying 'a wise man knows when to escape from an unfavorable situation to avoid loss'. For the sake of his own life, Lin Xun should just tolerate them.Lin Xun said in a resolute voice, \u201cThere is absolutely no room for negotiation on this matter.\u201d\u201cGood!

Lin Xun's lips also curled in an imperceptible smile.Lin Xun would have chosen to tolerate them at any other time and then find another chance to settle the matter.However, it was different this time. Lin Xun dared to go up against Lu Ting and Qian Qi because he predicted that Xiao Tianren wouldn't sit and do nothing.Xiao Tianren's appearance made Lu Ting and Qian Qi frown for a brief moment, but they soon returned to normal. Clearly, they attached no importance to Xiao Tianren.Xiao Tianren wore an imposing expression as he swept his gaze over Lu Ting and Qian Qi. He then spoke in a deep voice, \u201cYou two have the guts to dare snatch others' properties in the village! Do you think I, the village chief, do not exist?!\u201dAfter a pause, Xiao Tianren continued sternly, \u201cYou dare to snatch Lin Xun's stuff today, then are you going to snatch someone else's stuff tomorrow?\u201dAll the villagers' hearts trembled. 'Yes, Lu Ting is too arrogant, what if he snatched our stuff in the future?'Suddenly, all the villagers looked at Lu Ting with the same bitter hatred.Lu Ting frowned, inwardly infuriated. He pointed to Xiao Tianren and snapped, \u201cOld man Xiao, we have respected you all these years but you won't give us any face!?\u201dThat one sentence made Xiao Tianren's expression change.Lin Xun snorted in his heart. 'Lu Ting is really an idiot. His actions will only make the villagers disgust him even more.'\u201cFine, let's leave it. We made a mistake. Let's go.\u201d Qian Qi suddenly interrupted and pulled Lu Ting away.\u201cWhat are you doing? Do you not want any snow spotted leopard skin? Do you not want the one-horned lizard's scales? They can make top quality armor!\u201d Lu Ting yelled as he resisted, but Qian Qi firmly dragged him away.Xiao Tianren's expression still didn't look too good, but he evidently was relieved. Seeing that all the villagers were looking at him, he didn't want them to worry and waved dismissively. \u201cGood, everyone's good. Go now.\u201dEveryone knew they shouldn't stay any longer and left one after another. In the end, only Lin Xun, Xiao Tianren and Zhou Zhong remained.Without any outsiders around, Xiao Tianren suddenly sighed, \u201cI didn't think they would be so arrogant.\u201dLin Xun smiled and gave an irrelevant response, \u201cQian Qi is a smart person. He knew he couldn't get anything after you arrived.\u201dXiao Tianren shook his head. \u201cThis is only temporary. Since they didn't get what they wanted, they likely will find another opportunity.\u201dLin Xun nodded, pondered for a moment and asked, \u201cUncle Xiao, what if they suddenly disappeared one day?\u201dThe meaning behind his words was that if he had the chance to kill Lu Ting and Qian Qi, would you, the village chief, object?<sub>Visit to elworld.com discover_new novels.</sub>Seeing Lin Xun's clear and calm eyes, Xiao Tianren's eyelids twitched.

Most importantly, if the villagers wanted to survive, they still needed Lian Rufeng and others to travel to the Qingyang tribe to exchange for supplies. Who would carry out that task for Feiyun Village if they died?However, Zhou Zhong was also aware that Lian Rufeng and the others had changed. They were even more arrogant than before and thought all of the other villagers were beneath them. If they were allowed to do as they please, the consequences to the villagers would be unimaginable.After pondering over it, Zhou Zhong finally sighed inwardly. 'Since the village chief has come to this decision, he must have his reasons.'After some further small talk, Xiao Tianren hurried away.Zhou Zhong also had no intention of staying longer. After dividing the harvest with Lin Xun, he asked some strong villagers to distribute them to every household in the village.Of course, Lu Ting and Qian Qi were the only ones without a share, and no one objected to that. After all, they had gone too far this time.An iron pot was set up in the middle of a courtyard. The fire blazed and the pot glowed red as the essence and blood of the snow spotted leopard bubbled inside, sending trails of smoke into the air.Standing by the pot, Lin Xun quickly tossed in rune materials: blood clotting herb, common spirit flower, vermilion-purple fruit\u2026Each one already had the properties of strengthening the muscles and bones and refining the flesh and blood but their combination with the blood of snow spotted leopard produced the most optimal effect.This was a means of extracting rune materials.A rune master must possess the ability to identify rune materials as well as extract rune ink.Lin Xun had been learning from Mister Lu since young. He had memorized the medicinal properties, uses and effects of various rune materials very well. However, he wasn't trying to extract rune ink but extract their essences for his own cultivation.A full hour had passed.The various rune materials in the iron pot had completely integrated with the snow spotted leopard's essence and blood and turned into a thick, dark-red slurry.It was called the Aeth Refining Decoction.<sub>The most up-to-date nov_els are published_here > elworld.com</sub>Lin Xun took out a water sack and carefully poured the slurry inside and put it away safely. He smiled in relief.The slurry had great beneficial effects including strengthening the muscles and bones and refining the flesh and blood. This had the end result of toughening the consumer's body.Glug\u2014Lin Xun poured himself a bowl of slurry and gulped it all down in one mouthful. A billow of warmth roamed to all his limbs and bones.Taking this opportunity, Lin Xun practised the Marching Army Fist Art once again in the courtyard. Wind blasted from his fist as his body moved vigorously and nimbly.He continued to perform maneuvers in the courtyard, whipping up clouds of dust, and even creating mini explosions in the air.Soon, Lin Xun's blood and qi bubbled in his body and steam rose from the crown of his head. His body burned like a furnace. He felt every muscle burning with inexhaustible energy and felt no trace of fatigue.Enough time passed to burn an incense stick.Lin Xun's spine twisted and turned like a dragon as he suddenly charged forward and his fist roared like a raging sea.Bang!A hole was blasted into the huge azure rock in the middle of the courtyard. Fragments from the impact pelted the wall like rainwater.The seventh move of the Marching Army Fist\u2014 Raging Sea Devastates the Mountain!In the past, Lin Xun could never bring out the true power of this move due to the damage in his four heart acupuncture points.However, he not only achieved it now, but his expression also seemed relaxed and his breathing remained the same like it didn't require much energy.On the one hand, it was because the original damage to his four heart acupuncture points was a blessing in disguise. Four Aeth Power Vortexes had now formed in his four heart acupuncture points. As a result, when he performed the Marching Army Fist, he noticed that his aeth power was no longer sluggish like before. Additionally, the grade of his aeth power had also improved.On the other hand, his body had begun to change, becoming much stronger. Additionally, he had consumed the Aeth Refining Decoction, which had begun to produce its body refining effect. Thereby, it assisted him in displaying the real power of the Raging Sea Devastates the Mountain!Lin Xun couldn't be happier about the drastic changes that happened over the past few days.Without any hesitation, his figure suddenly flashed and his fist changed. His eyes flashed like lightning and in the blink of an eye, he seemed to transform into a haughty general with years of experience on the battlefield.Boom!His fist blasted through the air with majestic and imposing force, resembling a mighty dragon.

Although Lin Xun's cultivation had stagnated at the Inner Strengthening Stage for over two years, it only consolidated his aeth power more. Additionally, the further refinement from the four Aeth Power Vortexes raised his aeth power grade by another level and his fighting strength doubled as a result.Given his current state, he would be a laughingstock if he couldn't defeat Lu Ting with ease.\u201cQian Qi\u2026\u201dLin Xun's eyes glinted coldly as he thought of that fierce and ruthless man. 'He is an expert of the third layer True Martial Stage, I must pay utmost attention when I face him.'At night, Lin Xun cooked up a pot of snow spotted leopard meat with aeth grains, quickly demolished it, and returned to practicing in his room.He knew very well that Lu Ting and Qian Qi already viewed him as a thorn in their side. Even if they wouldn't kill him, they wouldn't let him off easily.Lin Xun wasn't the type who would resign himself to fate. Since he had decided to eliminate the two troublemakers, he would do everything he could to achieve it.Lin Xun had mastered very few battle techniques. Among them, the majority were taught by Mister Lu, such as the Marching Army Fist and the Six Word Blade.The Matching Army Fist was a basic fist art widely known throughout the Ziyao Empire, and Lin Xun had now fully grasped it.The Six Word Blade was a blade art divided into six moves: ' split', 'coil', 'rotate', 'shake', 'stab' and 'strip', and each had its own mystery.Mister Lu taught Lin Xun the blade art to improve the speed at which Lin Xun dissected rune materials but he didn't mention the origins of the blade art. After all, remarkable knife skills were required to extract complex rune materials.However, ever since Lin Xun started cultivating, he found that the technique wasn't only used to dissect rune materials, but it was also clearly a technique with terrifying destructive power.For example, even the 'split' move in the Six Word Blade consisted of seventeen different types of splitting, such as heavy splitting, side splitting, straight splitting, hidden splitting...and so on. Each one targeted an enemy's vital parts, and was incredibly precise and ruthless.Given Lin Xun's current skill, although he had the Six Word Blade art, he hadn't fully comprehended the mystery and essence of each move yet. He could only be said to be at the beginner level.Even so, the blade art's power could not be underestimated.<sub>New novel_chap_ters are published here: elworld.com</sub>For example, Lin Xun had split Lu Ting's whip in one slash using the 'heavy splitting' move the other day. Its destructive power could easily be extrapolated from that.Lin Xun had long suspected that the Six Word Blade had an impressive origin and wasn't an ordinary technique. Unfortunately, Mister Lu had never explained it to him.In short, the Marching Army Fist and the Six Word Blade art were the combat techniques that Lin Xun had grasped and they were more than enough to deal with ordinary opponents.What Lin Xun valued more was his cultivation base. A cultivator's cultivation base was the basis of their fighting strength. For example, regardless of how long a practitioner practised the Marching Army Fist Art or how proficient they were in it, it would have no destructive power without a solid cultivation base.Only with the support of a cultivation base could a person's fighting strength be fully displayed.Rumble~Stream-like aeth power repeatedly circulated in Lin Xun's body. His mind was clear and peaceful without the slightest ripple.After consuming the flesh and blood of the snow spotted leopard and the aeth grains, he had circulated his aeth power eighteen times around his body. Lin Xun's aeth power, which had halved after refinement, began to show signs of growth.Lin Xun even sensed signs of advancement!This undoubtedly proved that he had gotten rid of his bad luck of being unable to cultivate after obtaining the Omega Secret-Realm and was now starting a new life of cultivation.\u201cWithin seven days, I will breakthrough!\u201dLin Xun's eyes glistened with confidence in the dark house. If he could break through within that period, Qian Qi wouldn't be a problem for him.In the evening, after Lin Xun circulated his aeth power, he continued to comprehend the Little Divine Meditation Art by visualizing the stars and refining his spirit.Dawn was breaking, and even though he hadn't slept all night, Lin Xun was full of energy and didn't have a hint of tiredness. Instead, his six senses, vision, hearing, smell, taste, touch and consciousness, became more sensitive than before.He could hear the breeze ruffling the willow leaves outside the window, silkworms squirming on the ground, dew rolling off leaves, butterflies beating their wings and the whoosh of air currents\u2026The various sounds of nature formed a scene full of life.It was so unique and so clear as it reflected in his mind and made Lin Xun a lot more relaxed and peaceful.Lin Xun had never used his six senses to perceive the world in such a subtle way.This was precisely the effect of strengthening his spirit from practicing the [Little Divine Meditation Art].Spirit!It was a treasure of cultivation. It involved the person's understanding and wisdom. It was indescribably mysterious. Even the most powerful cultivators of the Heaven Ascension Stage could only explore and understand it little by little.<sub>Visit elworld.com for a better_user experience</sub>Lin Xun, who was only at the second layer True Martial Stage and had just started his cultivation, had already begun to touch upon the mystery of spirit!FavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Given our strength, we could have easily killed that little trash, don't you agree?\u201dQian Qi scrunched his brows. \u201cXiao Tianren and others were around. Do you think they would just let us kill him?\u201dLu Ting snorted. \u201cNone of those guys know any martial arts. So what if they all charge out to help that little trash? I can deal with them all alone!\u201dQian Qi frowned even more deeply. 'This guy is so stupid. If we anger Xiao Tianren and the others, who would grow aeth grains for us?'Qian Qi couldn't be bothered to explain anymore and he said directly, \u201cDon't forget what I told you last time. In a few days, Lin Xun will go to Sun Mazi's aeth fields more than twenty miles away from the village to exterminate worms!\u201dLu Ting was quiet for a moment but he still felt a little bitter. In the end, he grumbled, \u201cFine! Then I'll wait a few more days.\u201dQian Qi smiled slightly and said leisurely, \u201cAt that time, the treasures from the snow spotted leopard and one-horned lizard will belong to us.\u201dLu Ting's heart blazed and his expression grew fierce and sinister. 'Little trash, I'll let you live for a few more days!'In the next few days, apart from helping villagers exterminate worms in their plantations, Lin Xun spent all his time on his cultivation.Lin Xun made use of every little moment to comprehend the Little Divine Meditation Art, and practiced the Yuan Holding Art, Marching Army Fist Art and Six Word Blade.Although a huge fraction of the flesh and blood from the snow spotted leopard and one-horned lizard he hunted was distributed to the villagers, the remaining was enough to last Lin Xun for at least ten days.The two beasts' flesh and blood had significantly accelerated Lin Xun's cultivation speed. He even encountered an opportunity to break through to the third layer True Martial Stage, which he decided to delay temporarily.The presence of the four Aeth Power Vortexes in his four heart acupuncture points made it appear that the amount of aeth power in his body had reduced, but it had only improved its grade by four-fold and increased its purity level!Lin Xun felt that he should wait until the aeth power within his body was refined to its peak state before making a breakthrough.His reason for doing so was very simple\u2014he wanted to go further on the cultivation road in the future!The more solid a cultivator's foundation was, the smoother the road was in the future. This had been the indisputable truth since ancient times.<sub>You can_find the rest of this_content on the elworld.com platform.</sub>However, only very few people in history could achieve this because not everyone possessed the Aeth Power Vortex to refine their aeth power like Lin Xun did.A cultivator's foundation had long been decided by their constitution and couldn't be changed. Therefore, it was impossible to create a stronger foundation.In the early morning, Lin Xun woke up from meditation. His breathing was deep and long and his body was flowing with energy and aeth power.\u201cI will breakthrough either tomorrow or the day after tomorrow!\u201dLin Xun inhaled deeply like a whale drawing in water. The air flowed into his mouth like a swift current and irrigated every limb and bone in his body before escaping from his nose as a puff of turbid vapor.This was a sign that he was breaking through the third layer True Martial Stage, the Organ Opening Stage.The Organ Opening Stage represented the opening of the five organ dwellings, which corresponded to each of the five elements. If a person could smooth their arteries and veins that led to the five organs and draw aeth power there, it would be considered as taking a huge step on their cultivation path.The 'exhaling of the old and accepting the new' prepared the cultivator for 'Organ Opening' by removing the impurities from the body and drawing aeth power to the five internal organs. In the process, the cultivator's entire body, including qi, life force and aeth force would undergo changes.Lin Xun exited his room and practised the Marching Army Fist Art and the Six Word Blade under the sun. He then quickly rinsed himself and left home.He had made plans to help Sun Mazi with his fields, which were twenty miles away from Feiyun Village, so he had to set off early in order to get there before noon.On the way there, villagers enthusiastically greeted Lin Xun, and he also politely nodded back with a smile.After the time and effort he invested in the past few days, Lin Xun had been accepted into the village and was very respected by everyone.\u201cUncle Lin Xun, when will you teach us martial arts?\u201d shouted a little kid.\u201cSoon, probably in the next few days.\u201dLin Xun smiled and patted the child's head. Then, he left the village with Sun Mazi, who was waiting in the distance.Sun Mazi's family field was the only plantation still left to be treated. Once Lin Xun had exterminated the worms in those fields, he would have time to teach the children martial arts.Sun Mazi was an honest and wooden middle-aged man. The older man didn't utter a word on the way there.It took more than an hour for them to arrive at the two thousand odd square meters of plantations near Fiery Smoke Mountain.Lin Xun couldn't help but take a closer look at Fiery Smoke Mountain when he arrived.Standing at hundreds of feet tall, the mountain looked majestic and dangerous. The rocks on the mountain were bare, unlike the green rocks on nearby mountains. Instead, they were a reddish flame-like color and extremely eye-catching.<sub>The latest_epi_sodes are on_the elworld.com website.</sub>More than a hundred years ago, a cultivator from the eastern side of the Ziyao Empire spotted a little ore vein when he passed Fiery Smoke Mountain and it turned out to contain an abundant amount of Feiyun Fire Copper.This was where Feiying Village got its name.Since then, time had passed and circumstances had changed. When the ore vein was fully excavated and the influential figures left, the remaining group of slaves was left to fend for themselves.The villagers living in Feiyun Village were all descendants of those abandoned slaves.Lin Xun had heard Xiao Tianren mention the village's origin in the past so he couldn't help but stare a little longer when he saw Fiery Smoke Mountain.From his understanding, all of the places that contained Feiyun Fire Copper ore veins were all extremely favorable geographical locations and should be further explored!'If there's a chance, I must take a look for myself. If the guys who excavated the mine back then failed to notice something even more valuable, I can take advantage of that.' An idea flashed across Lin Xun's mind.Without further delay, Lin Xun deftly took out the required tools, walked into the depths of the aeth fields and began to draw the Light Drawing Rune.Sun Mazi waited near the fields.\u201cThe little trash is here! Let's act now!\u201dAt the foot of Fiery Smoke Mountain, not far from the fields, was Lu Ting hiding behind a boulder, his face contorted in an excited grin.\u201cWait a little longer. His aeth power will be exhausted after drawing runes and that's the best time to kill him.\u201dQian Qi wore a calm and solemn expression. He was an extremely cautious person.\u201cGiven our strengths, do you think we can't deal with a piece of trash at the second layer True Martial Stage?\u201d asked Lu Ting, sounding a little annoyed.\u201cIt's best to be cautious.\u201dQian Qi was not moved at all.Helpless, Lu Ting glowered with anger. He couldn't understand why Qian Qi, a third layer True Martial Stage cultivator, would think so highly of Lin Xun.Soon, a buzz rang from the fields and a beam of golden light shot into the sky.It was the Light Drawing Rune displaying its effect. Qian Qi couldn't help but sigh at the sight. \u201cGiven the kid's ability, if he didn't go against us, he could have been useful to Big Brother Lian Rufeng. What a pity\u2026\u201d\u201cDon't cry crocodile tears!\u201d Lu Ting spat disdainfully.<sub>The most up-to-date nov_els are published_here > elworld.com</sub>Qian Qi smiled without retorting. He got up and strode towards the fields. \u201cLet's go, it's harvest time.\u201d\u201cAt last!\u201dLu Ting had been waiting impatiently. He sprang up and charged over like a bloodthirsty bull with a giant shining hammer in his hand.The Light Drawing Rune displayed its magical effect and exterminated the worms within seconds.Lin Xun didn't even need to look to know what would be the result. He turned around and walked out of the field, but he came to realize that Sun Mazi was gone.Huh?Lin Xun's eyes darted around the surroundings, and while puzzlement filled his heart, he saw two figures speeding towards him from a distance.One was slim and fierce-looking and held a spear in his hand. The other was tall and burly, and wore a sinister expression while wielding a giant hammer.They were Qian Qi and Lu Ting!They had clearly come with malicious intentions. However, Lin Xun remained calm and collected. He had already predicted that Lu Ting and Qian Qi would come to give him trouble. He just didn't expect it to be that soon.Sun Mazi's sudden disappearance made Lin Xun realize that he had colluded with Lu Ting and Qian Qi.No one was nearby and he was far from Feiyun Village, making it impossible to seek help. It was indeed a good place to kill.Lin Xun knew Qian Qi was the brains behind this operation because Lu Ting was, well, a stupid boar, aggressive and hot-headed. He would never be able to plan something so meticulously.Lin Xun simply stood there quietly as he watched Lu Ting and Qian Qi approach. His expression was calm and a hint of a smile played on his lips.\u201cYou two finally came.\u201d Lin Xun suddenly spoke.Both Lu Ting and Qian Qi were taken aback. They thought the sudden change of situation would make Lin Xun panic and flee, but they didn't expect him to stand there calmly, as if he was waiting for them to arrive.\u201cStop pretending, let's see who will save you now!\u201d Lu Ting roared. Lin Xun's calm demeanor made him even more annoyed.Qian Qi was also a little surprised by Lin Xun's composure, but his eyes were still cold and razor-sharp. 'No matter what tricks he is playing, he will die today!'\u201cThe place you picked isn't bad. I had worried over the best place to eliminate you two without any witnesses. Unexpectedly, you dug your own graves.

His figure flashed and the azure blade in his grip slashed through the air, aiming directly for Qian Qi's head.Under such conditions, there was no room for him to flee. It was best to actively launch an attack.The blade cut through the air with a rip, creating a sonic boom that stung everyone's eardrum. In that instant, the blade resembled a flowing waterfall and exploded with forcefulnessBuzz!Reacting swiftly, Qian Qi brought his iron spear up to meet the attack head-on. The tip flashed a ray of cold light. His movements were quick, skillful and ruthless.He had followed Lian Rufeng to deliver goods between Feiyun Village and the Qingyang Tribe for years. He had not only fought fierce beasts, but also many robbers. And as a result, he had developed strong combat experience.Naturally, Lin Xun's sudden attack couldn't catch him off guard.Lu Ting was similar to Qian Qi in that he had many battle experiences, even if he was reckless. He couldn't help but sneer when he saw Lin Xun daringly point his weapon at Qian Qi. 'What a fool. No normal person would want to face Qian Qi in these circumstances.'After all, even if there seemed to be only one level of difference between the second and third layer True Martial Stage, there was a world of difference in strengths!However, what surprised Lu Ting was that Lin Xun suddenly slammed his toes on the ground and turned direction just as he was about to face Qian Qi. He suddenly seemed to change his target and came charging towards him!Shua!The azure blade moved at lightning speed. Sharp and fierce as the wind, it was precisely the 'stabbing' move of the Six Word Blade!The attacker slyly caught the enemy off guard with a surprise attackThe stabbing move was unpredictable and impossible to guard against. It contained enough force and speed for a one-shot kill.Lu Ting's pupils rapidly shrank. He only just realized that Lin Xun had made a feint and his target wasn't Qian Qi!Lu Ting roared as he swung up his giant hammer to shield his body. At the same time, he frantically drew back in hopes of evading the attack.However, how would Lin Xun miss such a good opportunity? His azure blade suddenly switched from the 'stab' move to the 'coil' move.Strands of silk shot from the blade as if it had a bunch of spring silkworms in it, clinging to Lu Ting's giant hammer like a magnet!<sub>Try the elworld.com platform_for the most advanced_reading experience.</sub>Boom!The blade appeared soft and gentle but an unparalleled force gushed out upon contact with the giant hammer. Lu Ting's arm shook and crackled until he dropped the giant hammer to the ground.As though a raging bull had knocked him over, Lu Ting bled from his mouth and nose while he was sent flying across tens of meters. But before he could even scream in pain, he passed out.After succeeding in one attack, Lin Xun didn't glance at Lu Ting again. He shifted his body and narrowly evaded Qian Qi, who was charging over from the side.\u201cLu Ting!\u201dQian Qi's face grew overcast and troubled as he trembled inwardly. Lin Xun's series of movements was completed in the blink of an eye, like a falcon swooping down on a hare. It was so fast that even he couldn't do anything to help out.Qian Qi also didn't expect Lin Xun to be so cunning to change targets halfway. The boy's true objective had never been him, but Lu Ting instead!Lu Ting also didn't put up a good performance. He was defeated in one strike!\u201cWhat a cunning little thing!\u201dQian Qi's voice was icy and full of murderous intent as he stared at Lin Xun with razor sharp eyes. He was clearly enraged.As though unaware of the other man's bloodlust, Lin Xun simply smiled, raised his blade and charged over.He couldn't bother to say anything. After getting rid of Lu Ting, he had one less obstacle, and so he could fully concentrate on dealing with Qian Qi, a cultivator of the third True Martial Stage.Shua! Shua! Shua!The azure blade constantly waved around in the air, sometimes as light as a dancing butterfly, sometimes as heavy as a mountain, sometimes as powerful as a landslide, and sometimes as quick as a lightning. The Six Word Blade was displayed in it's full majesty.It could be called as quick as an angered dragon and as powerful as an avalanche! It gave Qian Qi no chance to even breathe.Qian Qi practiced the Sparrowhawk Spear, which was known for its ruthlessness and its ability to kill as easily as splitting bamboo. Additionally, he was at the Organ Opening Stage and undoubtedly possessed remarkable combat strength.He could suppress and kill ordinary second layer True Martial Stage experts in seconds!However, Lin Xun had suppressed Qian Qi to the point that he was forced to constantly retreat and was unable to strike back.With his shrewd eyes, Qian Qi could tell that Lin Xun's blade was unusually powerful!The boy's unusually powerful blade technique wouldn't ordinarily be an issue because his superiority in cultivation levels gave him an upper hand against Lin Xun. However, unexpectedly, Lin Xun's strength was in no way inferior to his!How was that possible?How could a thirteen-year-old boy at the second layer True Martial Stage possess such strong aeth power?<sub>This_content is taken from elworld.com</sub>Shocked and outraged, Qian Qi realized he had still underestimated the youngster despite his cautiousness.He had often traveled to the Qingyang tribe in recent years and had heard about many young talented cultivators who appeared to possess a weak cultivation base but could take on opponents at a superior cultivation level!Such young heroes were only seen once in a hundred years. Even if the Qingyang Tribe had a population of around 8,000, only a few had such talent and strength.Could Lin Xun be one of those geniuses?Although Qian Qi forced himself to remain calm, puzzlement surged in his mind.He originally thought that Lin Xun was just a rune apprentice and nothing to be feared. It was when Lu Ting repeatedly lost to Lin Xun that he finally began to pay attention to Lin Xun.However, it was only after they exchanged blows that he woke up to the reality that he had truly underestimated Lin Xun's strength.'This isn't good!'Kacha!Suddenly, his arm throbbed with pain and his iron spear was sliced into two!'Not good!'Qian Qi was finally fully snapped out of his thoughts. His complexion became ashen and he didn't dare to make wild conjectures anymore. With a shrill scream, he twisted around and fled for his life!He was completely horrified. His broken spear made him realize that he was no match for Lin Xun. If he didn't take the chance to flee, there might not be another.Qian Qi had made a decision. Once he escaped, he would report the incident to Lian Rufeng in the Qingyang tribe. Lin Xun was too terrifying!However, just as Qian Qi turned around, Lin Xun unhesitatingly hurled his azure blade.Wu!The short blade whistled across the air, producing screeches similar to a hungry ghost. The speed was unbelievable. The next second, with a loud boom, the blade pierced into Qian Qi's back and knocked him to the ground. Blood gushed everywhere.Qian Qi let out a tragic wail as he pushed himself up. His face was contorted with pain and fear. Lin Xun rushed over and knocked him to the ground with a kick. Then, he yanked out his azure blade on Qian Qi's back and slashed his neck!From the start to the end of the skirmish Lin Xun had wasted no time. His movements were experienced and skillful.Qian Qi's eyes almost popped out their sockets but he refused to turn his head to look at Lin Xun. In the end, he tumbled to the ground and lost his life.Blood flowed from Qian Qi's throat and stained the ground a tragic red.Lin Xun remained undisturbed. After confirming that Qian Qi was indeed dead, he turned around and came to Lu Ting in the distance. He thrust his blade down, piercing the older man's heart.<sub>New_chap_ters are pub_lished on elworld.com</sub>Lu Ting and Qian Qi were both killed within minutes.Lin Xun let out a long sigh as he stared at Lu Ting's corpse in a daze.No one knew that this was his first time killing. It was understandable for him to be a little nervous.In order to make himself less apprehensive, Lin Xun had been crazily training a few days ago. He knew he would have to face Lu Ting and Qian Qi one day, and he also didn't forget to prepare various tactics and means.Perfect preparation, after all, was sometimes the beginning of creating a miracle.Lin Xun wasn't trying to create a miracle. He did everything just to kill Lu Ting and Qian Qi.It was just that he didn't realize that Qian Qi and Lu Ting weren't as strong as he had thought.That was right. He wasn't surprised that he suppressed Lu Ting in one strike, but he was shocked by the lack of pressure he felt when he was up against Qian Qi, a third layer True Martial Stage expert!Not only that, but as the battle continued, he also realized Qian Qi posed no threat to him.Lin Xun originally thought that Qian Qi was deliberately pretending to be weak. He only came to realize that Qian Qi wasn't that good when he killed the other man.'What is going on?'Lin Xun couldn't understand what had happened.He had actually prepared other means to kill Qian Qi. This even included a possibility that it'd be a bitter fight to the death. Who would have thought that he would easily win with just his strength alone?\u201cIt seems that he's just an ordinary person.\u201dLin Xun drew a deep breath, laughing at himself a little. He had been anxious about the battle for days. In the end, he had made a huge fuss over such a minor thing.Lin Xun blamed Qian Qi for underestimating himself.Although Qian Qi wasn't an influential figure of the third True Martial Stage, he was still a ruthless fellow with substantial battle experience.However, Lin Xun didn't realize that the Aeth Power Vortexes had long strengthened his cultivation base. His Aeth Power was not just pure and solid, its grade had been raised by four times.Additionally, his diligent practice and consumption of the flesh and blood of snow spotted leopard and one-horned lizard helped temper both the inside and outside of his body.With the help of the Six Word Blade and other unique cultivation arts, it was logical that he managed to kill Qian Qi easily.Without thinking about this any more, Lin Xun scanned the surroundings and finally focussed on the Fiery Smoke Mountain in the distance.He had heard that there was a mine in the hinterland of Fiery Smoke Mountain. Although it had been abandoned, it provided a good place to dispose of corpses.<sub>Visit elworld.com for a better_reading experience</sub>Lin Xun carried the bodies of Lu Ting and Qian Qi to the foot of Fiery Smoke Mountain and found the abandoned mine.FavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

They likely had never thought this would be the ultimate outcome when they were still alive.The abandoned mine was incredibly deep with no end in sight.After checking around, Lin Xun carried the bodies of Qian Qi and Lu Ting in.The mine was dark and consisted of a network of twists and turns. The rugged and crimson walls clearly showed the many excavated places.A Feiyun Fire Copper vein ore was discovered more than a hundred years ago and all of the Feiyun Fire Copper had likely been cleanly extracted given the mine's abandoned state.However, Lin Xun didn't come for any leftover ore. After navigating around the twists and turns of the mine, he paused in front of a pit.After tossing the corpses of Lu Ting and Qian Qi into the pit, Lin Xun didn't immediately leave. Instead, he continued to explore along the mine.However, the deeper he went, the wetter and colder he felt, and the quieter the atmosphere. The dark environment made his hair stand on end.Zhi\u2014Suddenly, a sharp whistle followed by a line of flames shot out from the depths of the mine, piercing the darkness and dazzling his eyes.'As expected!'The sudden noise didn't surprise Lin Xun. Instead, a smile curled the corners of his lips.Pu!He flicked his wrist and the blade's tip flashed. The line of flames roaring in front of him split apart. It popped and crackled as it fell to the ground like a shower of flames.Lin Xun leaned forward to see that it was a bat, except its head had been severed.The bat looked extremely hideous with protruding fangs, bulging eyes and bright red wings that seemed to be formed from blood.This was a blood red bat!<sub>Foll_ow current_novel on elworld.com</sub>Lin Xun had read an ancient book in Mister Lu's library called 'The Record of All Spirits' when he was a child and had come across a record about the blood red bats.This beast was a strange species. It was nocturnal and fed solely on blood. It passed venom into its victim's bloodstream through a bite and, without timely treatment, the victim would die within three days.However, Lin Xun wasn't too concerned because according to 'The Record of All Spirits', there would definitely be Blood Essence Sand where blood red bats were sighted!Blood Essence Sand was actually the teeth shed from blood red bats. Every three years, the bats would smash their fangs into rocks to destroy them for a new set to grow after a month of rest.For cultivators, Blood Essence Sand was a valuable rune material. It could be used as medicine or as rune ink, but its greatest value lied in its ability to cleanse bones and refine essences!Blood Essence Sand could increase a cultivator's chance of successfully breaking through to the Essence Refining Stage, the fifth layer True Martial Stage, by at least 20%!Therefore, Blood Essence Sand was regarded as an extremely valuable rune material.Lin Xun was already tempted to come when he learned about the existence of a Feiyun Fire Copper mine in Feiyun Village because he knew very well that blood red bats were attracted to places where Feiyun Fire Copper were found. The natural environment of Feiyun Fire Copper formed a natural protection for blood red bats.It was because of this that Lin Xun wanted to explore the mine, but he wasn't sure whether the people back then had also discovered this secret.However, seeing that a blood red bat had knocked into his hand, he was certain that there was an abundant amount of Blood Essence Sand hidden in the mine's depths!After thinking about this, Lin Xun increased his pace.Blood Essence Sand was extremely precious and could be sold for a good price. Even a little could fetch him a considerable fortune.Since Lin Xun was currently penniless, it was impossible for him to enter the Ziyao Empire through normal channels.For his cultivation path and to progress further along in the art of runes, he desperately needed to make some money.It couldn't be helped. Cultivation required money and runes also required huge financial support.There was a saying that every rune master was born from the accumulation of gold and silver mountains.This was no exaggeration since the engraving of runes required rune brushes, rune inks and vessels. Each one was indispensable. Rune ink was the most expensive of them all because it was made from the extraction of a variety of rune materials. The higher the grade of a rune, the higher the requirements for rune ink. Consequently, the requirements for the various rune materials needed to create the rune ink also wouldn't be low.Moreover, great attention also needed to be paid to the rune brush and vessel. Thus, the engraving of runes couldn't be done without money.Additionally, it was common to fail when attempting to engrave runes. Consequently, a huge chunk of money would be wasted as a result. No rune master could have a perfect success rate.<sub>Visit elworld.com, for the best no_vel_read_ing experience</sub>Therefore, in addition to talent and aptitude, a huge amount of money was required to become a rune master.Lin Xun couldn't do without money if he wanted to progress further in the art of runes.Of course, if he truly became a rune master one day, he could make money with no difficulty.There was also an old saying in the world: the smell of money lingered between every rune master's fingertips because the runes they engraved could be sold for crazy, sky-high prices!Lin Xun had started to learn the art of runes from Mister Lu from a young age. How would he not understand this reasoning?In order to have a sliver of a chance of becoming a true rune master, he needed to crazily work at three things: making a whole bunch of money, study runes, and practice carving runes!When he became a true rune master, wealth, status and fame would come easily!In Lin Xun's view, engraving runes was his survival skill. It was only when Mister Lu was around that he was guaranteed to have the money and materials required on his cultivation path.He wasn't a young master from a wealthy family who didn't have to worry about money, nor was he a descendant of a noble who had various cultivation resources at his fingertips. He came to Ziyao Empire alone, penniless, and had no one to depend on except himself.As he moved deeper into the mine, more bats rushed out. Fortunately, they possessed little attacking power despite their vicious appearances, and Lin Xun easily dealt with them.Pu\u2014Along the way, except from the dull noises made during the killing of the blood red bats, only the sounds of Lin Xun's footsteps echoed in the mine.However, as time went by, the number of bats soared. They sometimes attacked in groups like a shower of flames. Lin Xun had to be on full alert and he constantly swung his azure blade.Speaking of which, the azure blade was a self-defense weapon that Mister Lu had gifted him when he was a child. It was constructed from several rare rune materials. It was just a pity that Mister Lu couldn't engrave it with runes.Therefore, despite the azure blade's incomparable sharpness, it wasn't a graded treasure and could only be regarded as an ordinary tool.The sign that symbolized whether a treasure was graded was whether it was engraved with runes!Treasures marked with runes were called aeth tools.According to their power, aeth tools were divided into four major grades: human, earth, heaven, and pure sun. Furthermore, each grade was divided into lower, middle, upper, and top levels.<sub>Visit elworld.com for a better_user experience</sub>Generally speaking, only those with a cultivation base above the Spirit Dipper Stage could exert the full power of an aeth tool.Lin Xun only possessed the strength of the second layer True Martial Stage and so he couldn't bring out an aeth tool's true power even if he held one.However, although the azure blade wasn't graded and was only regarded as an ordinary tool, its power was extraordinary. After all, it was constructed from various rare rune materials.Lin Xun called the blade the Skybreaker Blade to symbolize that he would one day break the sky.Clasping the blade, Lin Xun continued forward. But he was shocked to find that the mine had no end.He had been navigating inside for more than an hour and had traveled at least tens of miles.The deeper he went, the darker it became, and only the dark red glow reflected on the walls of both sides helped Lin Xun to just barely see ahead.All of this greatly affected his eyesight, and even slowed his reaction when facing the blood red bats' attack.Later, Lin Xun gave up on spotting the bats with his eyes. He held his breath in deep concentration and began to perceive the danger around him with his mind and consciousness.This was no different to fighting with his eyes closed.At first, Lin Xun wasn't quite used to it and bats almost bit his vital body parts several times. However, he soon grew accustomed to such a method of fighting and the killing of bats became easier and smoother.Additionally, Lin Xun gained a deeper understanding of martial arts through using his perception in a real battle. He began to grasp some of the more obscure and mysterious aspects of the Six Word Blade that he had yet to comprehend.Shua! Shua! Shua!The blade light fluttered like a rainbow in the darkness as it beheaded the blood red bats one by one.Lin Xun was immersed in comprehending the Six Word Blade and had completely forgotten the passage of time. His mind was completely empty and free.Under such conditions, the movements of his blade became more and more skilful and he was beginning to exhibit the true essence of the blade art.Fortunately, Lin Xun's spirit had significantly improved after learning the Little Divine Meditation Art and his perception of the surroundings became much clearer.If other cultivators of the second layer True Martial Stage attempted to fight without using their eyes, they would have been instantly killed and their bodies riddled with bat bites.After an unknown period of time, Lin Xun suddenly felt his perception was empty. His eyes snapped open suddenly as he awoke. Looking around, he saw that he had reached the end of the mine.<sub>Try the elworld.com platform_for the most advanced_reading experience.</sub>At the end of the mine stood a huge rocky wall that clearly hadn't been mined.Scanning around, Lin Xun narrowed his eyes.

He confirmed they had died from the blood red bat poisoning.Thinking about what he saw along the way, Lin Xun felt a little distressed. The slaves were ordinary people, so how could they survive the bat's attack?Without getting too emotional, Lin Xun further searched around, and as he expected, spotted several beehive-like caves.Those were blood red bat nests. Lin Xun stepped forward and, without much effort, could see heaps of white fang fragments in each nest like grains of sand.That was the Blood Essence Sand. The fragments were as small as a grain of sand and were snowy white. They emitted an icy cold air in his hand.Pa!Lin Xun picked up one Blood Essence Sand fragment and squeezed it between his fingers. The translucent white shell cracked and leaked out a trickle of the bright fiery liquid.Lin Xun couldn't control his excitement. There were no less than one thousand nests and each one was piled with Blood Essence Sand. He would amass a fortune, if he hoarded them all!Without any hesitation, Lin Xun acted. He tore pieces of clothing from the skeletons into rags and effortlessly finagled them into a bag and began to collect Blood Essence Sand.In less than the time it took to drink a cup of tea, all of the Blood Essence Sand was gathered. Lin Xun's bag had become much heavier, weighing at least two and a half kilos!Lin Xun smiled. He wouldn't have to worry about money anymore with the bag of Blood Essence Sand.Just as Lin Xun was about to leave, he inadvertently glanced around and a rocky wall at the end of the mine caught his attention. He gasped.He quickly moved towards the rocky wall and knocked a few times. Then, as though he remembered something, he gripped the Sky Breaking Blade and made a slash across the wall.Suddenly, rock fragments tumbled down to reveal a four-finger wide crevice.Lin Xun wiped his finger over the rock dust on the crevice, twirled it between his index finger and thumb and faint heat spread out from his fingertips.Lin Xun's eyes lit up. He continued to chisel a hole through the wall with his blade, until it was one foot deep and a faint glimmer of red dazzled his eyes.Lin Xun beamed with joy again and after digging another half a foot in, he removed a mottled red stone.The fist-sized stone was rugged on the outside but the fiery redness in the middle was incredibly striking.Lin Xun swiftly raised his blade and chiseled the stone into small pieces. Soon, only a thumb-sized Fire Copper ore was left in his palm!<sub>You can_find the rest of this_content on the elworld.com platform.</sub>The Fire Copper seemed to be shrouded in a beautiful bright red mist, and even if it was only the size of a thumb, it weighed as much as four kilos!As expected!The Fire Copper ore in the mine hadn't been completely excavated!Lin Xun grinned. From one glance, he noticed the wall looked a little dry, unlike the cold and humid environment it was in.That abnormality sparked his suspicion and so he started to excavate the wall. He soon found what he had speculated.What an unexpected surprise!Feiyun Fire Copper was a superb rune material for making weapons. Together with extremely fine steel, it could be used to forge razor sharp weapons that were hard and flexible at the same time. Additionally, such a weapon could exhibit even greater power if engraved with a fire-attribute rune!In terms of value, although Feiyun Fire Copper wasn't as precious as Blood Essence Sand, it was more desirable among cultivators!\u201cBlood Essence Sand, a Feiyun Fire Copper ore vein\u2026\u201dLin Xun drew a deep breath to calm himself down. He decided to not continue to dig for Feiyun Fire Copper, and instead he traveled back along the mine.He knew it was unrealistic to think he could mine all the Feiyun Fire Copper alone.Therefore, he should discuss the matter with Village Chief Xiao Tianren first.Lin Xun wasn't a greedy person. Since he now resided in Feiyun Village and had received many favors from Xiao Tianren, he should look to pay them back.It wasn't until the afternoon that Lin Xun hauled the sack of Blood Essence Sand back to the village alone.However, as soon as he showed up at the village entrance, a little kid playing nearby yelled and darted towards the village.\u201cHe's back! Uncle Lin Xun is back! He's not dead!\u201dThe young and soft voice was filled with surprise.Lin Xun was first taken aback. He then quickened his steps in puzzlement. However, it didn't take long before he saw a group of people rushing out to greet him.It was Xiao Tianren and the other villagers. In the middle of the group was Sun Mazi, who had been tied up by Zhou Zhong and the others, and was being escorted like a prisoner.Lin Xun instantly understood what happened. He stepped forward and smiled at Xiao Tianren. \u201cUncle Xiao.\u201dXiao Tianren originally had an expression filled with deep concern and worry but the sight of Lin Xun returning safe and sound made him breathe a huge sigh of relief. He smiled and said, \u201cIs the problem dealt with?\u201dLin Xun nodded with a smile. He knew Xiao Tianren was asking about Qian Qi and Lu Ting.<sub>The source of this_chapter; elworld.com</sub>Xiao Tianren let out a long sigh and vigorously patted Lin Xun on the shoulder. \u201cGood! Well done, well done.\u201dSeeing that scene, how would the other villagers not understand that Qian Qi and Lu Ting were never going to return?Suddenly, their eyes brimmed with astonishment and disbelief as they gazed at Lin Xun. 'Qian Qi is a third True Martial Stage cultivator yet he was no match for Lin Xun?''This is too shocking.'Xiao Tianren suddenly pointed to Sun Mazi who was tied up and asked, \u201cSun Mazi has already admitted to what happened. How do you plan on dealing with him?\u201dSun Mazi's face was bruised and swollen, and he looked incredibly miserable as he cried out in tears, \u201cI was forced to do it. Qian Qi threatened to kill my only three-year-old child if I didn't comply. I\u2026I had no other choice.\u201dIn the end, he started bawling.Many villagers couldn't bear to see him in such a state. Sun Mazi was an honest man. It was impossible for him to plot to harm Lin Xun without Qian Qi and Lu Ting coercing him.Lin Xun swept his gaze over everyone's expression and understood their thinking. He smiled. \u201cThis matter has nothing to do with Big Brother Sun. He was forced to do it. Uncle Xiao, can you please let him go?\u201dXiao Tianren also secretly breathed a sigh of relief. He immediately signaled the others to release Sun Mazi after he saw that Lin Xun didn't intend to pursue the matter.\u201cThank you, thank you Little Brother Lin Xun!\u201dSun Mazi was so moved that he didn't know what to do. He was about to kneel down and kowtow when Lin Xun stopped and comforted him.\u201cOkay, Lin Xun has safely returned. Everyone should go back to what they were doing.\u201dXiao Tianren waved his hand.In the courtyard of Lin Xun's home.Lin Xun recounted that day's events while eating, but he made no mention of the Feiyun Fire Copper mine.Xiao Tianren couldn't help feeling emotional and a little shocked when he learned about everything that had happened and saw the thirteen-year-old boy simply concentrating on his meal.Qian Qi had traveled north and south and had considerable battle experience. He was an expert second only to Lian Rufeng, but Lin Xun, who was weaker than him in terms of cultivation level, managed to kill him!Just how strong was Lin Xun's battle power?Most importantly, Qian Qi wasn't the only one there at the time. Lu Ting was around too. However Lin Xun still fought off a joint attack. It was easy to imagine how strong Lin Xun was from this fact alone.Could he be considered a so-called genius in the cultivation world?Xiao Tianren felt like his worldview had been shaken and was unable to calm down for a good while.<sub>The most up-to-date nov_els are published_here > elworld.com</sub>He couldn't believe this unless he confirmed it with Lin Xun.\u201cUncle Xiao, I had an unexpected harvest in the abandoned mine in Fiery Smoke Mountain.\u201dAfter the meal, Lin Xun brought over the sack nearby, and with a crash, poured out a heap of Blood Essence Sand on the table. Each one glistened white like grains of sand polished into crescent moons.Xiao Tianren uttered in confusion. \u201cThis is?\u201dLin Xun looked a little stunned, but he soon understood that Xiao Tianren had no knowledge of Blood Essence Sand. He patiently explained, \u201cThese are Blood Essence Sand, the fangs shed from blood red bats. They are extremely high-value rune materials\u2026\u201dXiao Tianren indeed had no knowledge of Blood Essence Sand, but he had heard about blood red bats. He couldn't help gasping, \u201cYou encountered blood red bats?\u201dIn Xiao Tianren's memory, they were bloodthirsty monsters that killed many slaves working in the Feiyun Fire Copper mine!The blood red bats' nests were the reason why no villager had ever been willing to get near the abandoned mine all these years.Lin Xun smiled and said, \u201cDon't worry, Uncle Xiao, those bloodthirsty monsters have all been exterminated.\u201dExterminated?Xiao Tianren's body trembled all over and he looked dumbfounded. It was only after a long while that he forced a smile and explained, \u201cPlease excuse my response, what happened today has shocked me too much.\u201dLin Xun also understood that although Xiao Tianren was the village chief, he was just an ordinary person.In his eyes, blood red bats were no different to demons.After calming down, Xiao Tianren said, \u201cHurry, put away the Blood Essence Sand. You are now the only cultivator in Feiyun Village. The others will just waste these treasures.\u201dXiao Tianren's words proved that he no longer regarded Lian Rufeng and others as his people.At the same time, the fact that Xiao Tianren did so also proved that he really cared for Lin Xun. If other people learned about the Blood Essence Sand's value, they likely would want a share.But Xiao Tianren didn't. This meant that he saw Lin Xun as one of his own.Lin Xun did not refuse, and because of Xiao Tianren's words, he made up his mind.\u201cUncle Xiao, there is actually another happy event\u2026\u201dWhile speaking, Lin Xun took out the thumb-sized piece of Feiyun Fire Copper. \u201cI found an unmined Feiyun Fire Copper ore vein.\u201dPu!Tea spurted out Xiao Tianren's mouth.

He knew what an unmined Feiyun Fire Copper mine symbolized.He knew well what sort of astonishing changes it could bring to the entire Feiyun Village!Feiyun Village had nothing of value and had to live off from selling and exchanging aeth grains for meager living supplies. They had only just barely solved the problem of food and clothing shortage in the village.But if the villagers sold Feiyun Fire Copper, they would no doubt become wealthy and wouldn't have to worry about making a living anymore.Additionally, after securing abundant materials, the children in the village could attend school, learn to read, and even embark on the path of true cultivation. They could seek success in prosperous cities, unlike their parents who had to grow up in poverty in a remote place!\u201cUncle Xiao, I want to ask you to invite all the villagers to mine the Feiyun Fire Copper together. Everyone will have a share of what we make from selling the ores,\u201d Lin Xun proposed quickly.Xiao Tianren's cheeks flushed and he seemed to quiver with emotion. It was only after a good while that he could clench his teeth and respond, \u201cNo! You discovered the ore vein. It belongs to you. I can call on the entire village to help you mine the ore but you only need to pay them for the work!\u201dLin Xun shook his head, \u201cThe wealth originally belongs to the Feiyun Village. I just happened to discover it. I absolutely can't monopolize it alone. Otherwise, I would rather not have the fortune that the ores will fetch.\u201dHis tone was calm but resolute.Xiao Tianren stared blankly at Lin Xun for a long time before he could utter, \u201cDo\u2026do\u2026you know what a Feiyun Fire Copper mine is worth?\u201dHe picked up the thumb-sized Feiyun Fire Copper on the table. \u201cEven a small piece like this could get thirty imperial copper coins more than one hundred years ago! Now, you can get even more if you sell this in the city!\u201dHe suddenly inhaled sharply. \u201cThis is the market price from more than one hundred years ago. It's worth a lot more now. Are\u2026you really sure you want to do this?\u201dAlthough the value of a Feiyun Fire Copper surprised Lin Xun a little, he still unwaveringly nodded. \u201cI've decided.\u201dHe was an orphan raised by Mister Lu since he was young.At the age of thirteen, the mine prison he had lived in all his life was destroyed and he had no idea where Mister Lu went or if he was still alive. After that, he came to the Ziyao Empire's territory alone.Feiyun Village was his first home in the Ziyao Empire, and Village Chief Xiao Tianren and the villagers treated him as one of their people.In such a situation, how could Lin Xun mind them taking a share of the wealth from the Feiyun Fire Copper mine?Compared to mere worldly possessions, Lin Xun valued more the kindness that the villagers in Feiyun Village had given him!<sub>Try the elworld.com platform_for the most advanced_reading experience.</sub>At that point, Xiao Tianren no longer regarded Lin Xun as a junior. No ordinary adult had a mindset comparable to Lin Xun's, even if he was only thirteen years old.Moreover, Lin Xun not only was a rune apprentice proficient in engraving runes, but he was also a cultivator strong in combat!Xiao Tianren compared him with Lian Rufeng. If the other man had been the one who had discovered the Feiyun Fire Copper mine, it was highly unlikely that the villagers would see a single copper of profit from it!The huge contrast between Lin Xun and Lian Rufeng made Xiao Tianren admire and even respect Lin Xun.It wasn't easy to make him, an old man who had lived most of his life already, respect a thirteen-year-old boy.Xiao Tianren didn't try to dissuade Lin Xun anymore. After Lin Xun made his decision, he began thinking about how to mobilize the villagers to dig the Feiyun Fire Copper.Lin Xun suddenly said aloud, \u201cUncle Xiao, there's no need to hurry. We should get rid of the hidden issue in the village before we announce this matter.\u201dIssue?Xiao Tianren was a little alarmed at first but he immediately understood what Lin Xun meant and his face assumed a solemn expression. Indeed, if he considered the fact that Lin Xun had killed Lu Ting and Qian Qi, Lian Rufeng would definitely not be willing to leave the matter like so when he and his people returned.This was obvious.The existence of Lian Rufeng and his people was a serious threat to the entire Feiyun Village.A few days ago, Xiao Tianren had already realized that Lian Rufeng and others were plotting something detrimental to Feiyun Village.If Xiao Tianren waited for them to return to the village then not only Lin Xun would be in danger, but even all of the villagers would also suffer!Xiao Tianren scrunched his eyebrows. \u201cLin Xun, what do you think we should do?\u201dAs someone who possessed a cultivation base of the fourth layer True Martial Stage, Lian Rufeng was incredibly powerful. Moreover, a group of bodyguards constantly followed him. The villagers were simply no match for him.Lin Xun asked quietly, \u201cUncle Xiao, I want to know what the villagers think of Lian Rufeng. After all, Lian Rufeng and his people are also members of the village. If we really plan to deal with them, we have to consider the other villagers' opinions.\u201dThis was indeed a problem. Although the behavior of Lian Rufeng and the others was increasingly outrageous and they even secretly pocketed a lot of the village's earnings, the villagers still needed their help in transporting goods to the Qingyang tribe. Otherwise, they wouldn't be able to survive.In other words, the villagers had no choice but to rely on Lian Rufeng and his people in order to live!This was the reason why Lian Rufeng and the others had dared to be so arrogant and audacious.Xiao Tianren thought the question over, but in the end he couldn't hide his disgust. \u201cIn recent years, Lian Rufeng and the others have brought back less and less materials, which made the villagers increasingly resent them. However, the villagers had to swallow their hatred and anger to continue to live.\u201d<sub>New_chap_ters are pub_lished on elworld.com</sub>Xiao Tianren couldn't help but sigh. \u201cMost importantly, everyone is worried if Lian Rufeng was gone, who would help them exchange for supplies with the Qingyang tribe?\u201dLin Xun felt a lot more relieved. He smiled. \u201cThat's easy. Once we get rid of Lian Rufeng and the others, I will help the village solve the problem of living supplies!\u201dXiao Tianren perked up. \u201cLin Xun, you want to deal with Lian Rufeng and the others? How confident are you in succeeding?\u201dLin Xun didn't answer and just smiled. \u201cUncle Xiao, leave this matter to me. You don't have to worry about it anymore.\u201dLin Xun's calm smile on his pretty and fair face and his indescribable confidence under the sunlight had unconsciously infected Xiao Tianren. The hesitation in his heart was instantly wiped away and he said unwaveringly, \u201cThen it's decided!\u201dThat night, Lin Xun sat alone at his desk, lost in thought, as he gazed at the stars outside the window.His cultivation had progressed without hindrance ever since the damage within his body was dealt with. Additionally, after obtaining the Omega Secret Realm, he had full confidence in his future cultivation.Since that was the case, it seemed that he had no other reason to stay in Feiyun Village anymore.\u201cAfter I deal with the villagers' problems, I can continue on my journey\u2026Mister Lu, who was the one who took my Origin Aeth Artery? Where are they hiding in the Ziyao Empire now?\u201dLin Xun knew for a long time that he was an orphan. He had originally thought that he would never find out who his parents were but Mister Lu's words suggested to him that he would learn about his parents if he found out who took his Origin Aeth Artery.Of course, Lin Xun wasn't particularly interested in finding his parents. He only wanted to know why his Origin Aeth Artery was taken away!He almost lost his life as a result of this, and even if he managed to survive, it almost caused him to be unable to cultivate. How could Lin Xun not bear a deep grudge?He vowed to get revenge!Even without Mister Lu's instructions, he had to find out for himself!'Why?''Why did you take away the Origin Aeth Artery that belonged to me?'Pondering quietly, Lin Xun suddenly drew a deep breath to suppress his hatred. Having grown up in a dark and bloody mine prison, he knew that revenge was never an easy task.From what Mister Lu had told him, his enemy seemed to be in the Ziyao Empire, but it still wouldn't be easy to get revenge.How huge was the Ziyao Empire? What was his enemy's name? What was his strength and cultivation level?<sub>The latest_epi_sodes are on_the elworld.com website.</sub>Lin Xun didn't know anything about his enemy.But he wasn't in a hurry. He knew that one day he would achieve his goal if he worked hard!Of course, he not only needed to survive in the Ziyao Empire first, but also become powerful!After getting rid of Qian Qi and Lu Ting, Lin Xun's life returned to its usual normal and peaceful state. Besides teaching martial arts to the children in the village, he spent the rest of his time on his own cultivation.Three days later.All the Aeth grains in the village had matured and the villagers joyfully harvested them day and night.On that day, Lin Xun finally made a breakthrough in his cultivation after more than two years and he reached the True Martial third layer, the Organ Opening Stage.His breakthrough didn't happen deliberately. Instead, it was a natural breakthrough, like a cup naturally overflowing with water as it was filled.That natural breakthrough proved that Lin Xun had developed a solid foundation that surpassed others and was out of the ordinary.The Organ Opening Stage symbolized the opening of channels that led to the five organs. Each of the five major internal organs of the human body corresponded to one of the five elements - the liver to wood, the heart to fire, the spleen to earth, the lung to metal, and the kidney to water.Therefore, this layer was also known as the Five Elements Opening Stage.At this stage, a cultivator's aeth power could circulate and cleanse the five organs, as well as nourish the meridians.Aeth power could circulate the body nine times in the Qi Drawing Stage.The Inner Strengthening Stage allowed aeth power to circulate the body eighteen times.The Organ Opening allowed aeth power to circulate the body thirty-six times!The number of aeth power cycles signified the aeth power's strength and its destructive force.Regardless, Lin Xun had finally made a breakthrough in his cultivation after two years!Lin Xun felt he had regained a new life. He knew that as long as he continued to progress, one day he could break the sky, shake the universe and open the gate of stars like the mysterious mighty figure!Favorite<sub>Visit to elworld.com discover_new novels.</sub>Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

A fresh breeze was blowing. A group of children looked incredibly serious as they diligently practiced the Marching Army Fist, their movements looking orderly and skilled.The children were much more proficient in the Marching Army Fist compared to before. They had a great opening and closing stance and their punches had much greater force!Supervising them on the sides, Lin Xun nodded approvingly.In the past, the children's Marching Army Fist was disorganized and confused, and they had neglected a lot of skills that allowed them to generate power. If they had continued to practice in that way, they, no doubt, would have gone astray.It was completely different now. After Lin Xun had guided and corrected them one by one, the children began to grasp the mystery of the Marching Army Fist.Lin Xun wondered if Lian Rufeng and other guards even properly taught the children martial arts.Otherwise, how would they fail to spot the mistakes in the children's Marching Army Fist?Four children were sitting meditating in a cross-legged posture on the other side of the training grounds. Among them was Ying Hao's son, Ying Liu'er.The four were around seven to eight years old, but they had demonstrated more aptitude for martial arts than the other children. Additionally, they had a good grasp and control of their qi and could draw qi into their bodies. With frequent training, they could soon join the ranks of true cultivators.Lin Xun wasn't selfish and even taught them the [Yuan Holding Art] one by one. He also generously shared the meat of the snow spotted leopard and one-horned lizard with them to help strengthen their bodies and replenish their aeth power.He did this in consideration of Feiyun VIllage's future.Lin Xun knew that there would be no guards left in Feiyun Village if Lian Rufeng and the others were gone.Lin Xun couldn't possibly stay in Feiyun Village forever and so he urgently needed to find some people to protect the village in replacement of Lian Rufeng and others.Ying Liu'er and the other three were the seedlings that Lin Xun chose.Lin Xun planned to impart all his cultivation knowledge to them before leaving the village. However, they had to rely on themselves in the future.Lin Xun didn't just stand there when he supervised the children's martial arts practice. Wielding an azure wooden blade, he sharpened his skills of the Six Word Blade. He did this by not using any aeth power and relied on his physical strength aloneShua!A tiny willow leaf fluttered down and was sliced into two as the blade flashed.<sub>Try the elworld.com platform_for the most advanced_reading experience.</sub>The cutting of a leaf might seem ordinary and could be done by almost all cultivators, but upon a closer look, one would notice the willow leaf didn't split in a simple manner.The blade had slashed along a curved vein in the leaf. The split wasn't straight!In other words, not only was Lin Xun's blade as fast as lightning, it accurately split a willow leaf along its vein.The willow leaf was tiny but Li Xun was able to slice it at lightning speed and only by using the strength of his wrist. Other powerful cultivators would likely heap praises on him if they saw his performance.This was because his skill was at the Elemental Realm!Martial arts were divided into four realms: Inkling, Elemental, Precise, and Perfect.For example, a cultivator who could perform each move of the Marching Army First was considered to be at the Inkling Realm.Practice made perfect. When a practitioner began to comprehend the essence of each move, they had reached the Elemental Realm.On that basis, only when a cultivator could precisely exhibit the move's essence could they be said to be at the Precise Realm.As for the Perfect Realm, it symbolized when a cultivator fully understood all mysteries of an art, such as the Marching Army Fist Art, and was able to fully exhibit its power.Once someone reached that realm, their every motion and movement was as natural and effortless as flowing water.These were the four great realms of all combat arts.Lin Xun had refined the Marching Army Fist to the Precise Realm and was only one step away from the Perfect Realm.This was normal. After all, the Marching Army Fist was a basic fist art and had few requirements for the cultivator. However, regardless of how simple the fist art was, it wasn't easy to reach the Perfect Realm.It required deep understanding.After all, the cultivators in the world all had different personalities and different aeth powers and thus each would exhibit a different style of Marching Army Fist. The cultivator needed to figure out their own style in order to reach the Perfect Realm.However, most cultivators in the world wouldn't waste time on a basic cultivation art since it only had limited powers and wasn't worth the effort.However, the Marching Army Fist was the only fist art that Lin Xun had grasped and so he had no other choice but to spend more time in refining it.In his opinion, even the most basic fist art could exhibit unimaginable power if refined to the Perfect Realm.After all, advanced cultivation arts were like iron swords and basic cultivation arts were like wooden swords. Wooden swords undoubtedly weren't as powerful as iron swords.<sub>The source of this_chapter; elworld.com</sub>However, this depended on whose hand the weapon was in!In the hands of a master, even a wooden sword could kill, whereas the sharpest iron sword would be useless in the hands of an ordinary person.To reach the Perfect Realm of the Marching Army Fist required understanding and it couldn't be rushed. Recently, Lin Xun had put most of his attention into practising the Six Word Blade.The Six Word Blade was indeed a unique and unimaginably powerful art. However, it was more difficult to practice than other arts.Even though Lin Xun managed to reach the Elemental Realm, he was still far from the Precise Realm, let alone Perfect.The long battle with the blood red bats had helped Lin Xun reach the Elemental Realm in the Six Word Blade. Otherwise, without such an experience, it would have been impossible for Lin Xun to do so.It made Lin Xun realize that it didn't matter how much he practiced on his own. A cultivator could only comprehend the essence of an art through actual combat. After all, battle experience had to be earned and couldn't be obtained from books alone; a true warrior was through blood and tears.\u201cI should find an opportunity to explore the mountains again. It would be great if I encounter some beasts to hone my blade skills\u2026\u201dAn idea flashed across Lin Xun's mind.Real-life combat not only allowed a cultivator to practice their martial arts, but also improved their perseverance, courage and experience. A cultivator without combat experience was unlikely to progress far on the cultivation path!After seven days of hard work, all the aeth grains in Feiyun Village had been harvested. From a rough estimate, the grains weighed at least three hundred kilos in total.Despite the harvest being smaller than that in previous years, the villagers were still very satisfied.They knew that they were already very fortunate to harvest that much after the insect infestation.Every household in the village gifted Lin Xun with many aeth grains to thank him for exterminating the worms. In total, he had received around fifty kilos.In the past, the harvested aeth grains were transported thousands of miles away to the Qingyang tribe in exchange for living supplies.However, no one planned to do so this time. The villagers understood that Village Chief Xiao Tianren had made a decision, and even if they were worried whether or not Lin Xun could succeed, they had no objection.The quiet and peaceful days continued. Before they knew it, nearly a month had passed since the death of Lu Ting and Qian Qi.Other than teaching the children martial arts, Lin Xun spent all his time on cultivation.<sub>For more_novel, visit elworld.com</sub>After a period of training, Lin Xun's Organ Opening Stage had become extremely solid and his fighting strength had doubled to what it was before.If he were to face Qian Qi again, he could easily kill him with one slash.He also made significant progress in the Little Divine Meditation Art. His spirit had grown more and more powerful and he was only one step away from successfully lighting a star in his sea of consciousness.Even if he hadn't quite succeeded, he enjoyed great benefits from the growth of his spirit. At least, he didn't feel any fatigue even if he had only slept for three hours that day. As a result, Lin Xun gained a lot of spare time.Moreover, as his spirit grew, it became easier for him to comprehend the Six Word Blade. Lin Xun was overjoyed with these unexpected changes. He became even more aware that the Little Divine Meditation Art was out of the ordinary.In addition to strengthening his cultivation base and refining his cultivation arts, he didn't forget to set aside some time every day to practice the art of runes, such as improving his brush power and brush skills as well as the speed of engraving runes.His only disappointment was that he still lacked a good rune brush after the dark gray brush had vanished with the ancient book.Otherwise, given the amount of rune materials he had collected, he could easily extract quality rune ink from them and engrave true runes.If he couldn't engrave runes, he couldn't deduce his level in the art of runes and how far away he was from becoming a true rune master.However, Lin Xun was in no hurry because he knew it was impossible to complete the training in the art of runes overnight. It needed consistent practice and study. There was absolutely no shortcut.Of course, Lin Xun was already very satisfied knowing that his cultivation base, martial arts, art of runes, and spirit cultivation were improving in a good way.It was just that as time went by, the villagers felt increasingly worried. They couldn't remain as calm as Lin Xun because they knew that Lian Rufeng and his people would soon return to Feiyun Village.The villagers felt incredibly tense and uneasy. Although there was a miserable and gloomy atmosphere, it was nothing compared to what it was like in the past.Lin Xun had no power to change anything. Whatever that was going to come would come and what they needed to do was think about how to deal with it when it did.In the early morning, after washing up, Lin Xun carried a huge bone bow and a bag of arrows, strapped a sharp blade to his waist, and left the village.In the past month, he had long consumed all the flesh and blood of the snow spotted leopard and one-horned lizard. It was difficult to satisfy his hunger with aeth grains alone.Therefore, to fill his stomach and for his cultivation in the future, Lin Xun had decided to make another trip to the ancient forest in the mountains.Lin Xun traveled alone and didn't bring Zhou Zhong or the other hunters with him.He did that for their safety because they had almost run into a lava wolf last time had it not been for Lin Xun's sharp senses. The consequences would be dire if that had occurred.Of course, Lin Xun had no way of knowing that a mysterious little girl had already killed the lava wolf that he saw as a huge threat\u2026<sub>The latest_epi_sodes are on_the elworld.com website.</sub>FavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 31": "Chapter 31\nJun 11, 2022Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 31 Changes Constantly AriseHu\u2014Lin Xun's silhouette sped through the morning wind.In just one month, Lin Xun's thin and frail body had grown much taller and more built. Every part of his body was flowing with energy and vitality.His young face was no longer pale, and instead was luminous and had a hint of a carefree look.All his changes were a result of his diligent practice and the daily consumption of the Aeth Refining Decoction and the flesh and blood of snow spotted leopard and one-horned lizard. He felt as though he had thoroughly remolded himself and been reborn. It was like he was a completely different person.As a cultivator at the third-layer True Martial Stage, he could run like the wind and, with the support of aeth power, travel at full speed for more than an hour without feeling tired.Basically, he had reached the point where he was as swift as a galloping horse and could leap as high as a leopard!All cultivators of the Organ Opening Stage were at this point.Now, a journey that took an hour in the past would only take a quarter of an hour.The vast ancient selike forest once again came into sight. Lin Xun removed the bone bow strung across his back and pulled an ink-colored arrow from his quiver before vanishing into the dark forest.A moment later.Bang!An arrow flew like a lightning bolt, shot into a striped tiger and sent its huge body flying across several feet. Blood sputtered everywhere. With a howl of pain, it lost its life.A figure leaped down from a tree and darted over to the striped tiger's body. He was tall and slim, had sharp facial features, and wielded a huge bone bow. It was Lin Xun.The bow was constructed from the snow spotted leopard's backbone and the bow string was from the one-horned lizard's tendon. It had been polished and refined for days, making it incredibly tough. It required vast strength from the archer to pull back the bow and aim.Lin Xun had put a lot of thought into creating the bow. The bowstring had been sharpened for seven days with a mixture of ground Feiyun Fire Copper and various kinds of rune materials. This made it extremely tough and ordinary swords and blades could not cut it.A powerful bow such as this obviously required special arrows.The four foot-long arrows in Lin Xun's quiver were all made from the one-horned lizard's leg bones. Each arrow was jet-black and weighed at least three hundred grams. They were not only sharp but also tougher than fine steel.Due to Lin Xun's weak constitution, Mister Lu had told him that ordinary weapons weren't suitable for him and advised him to choose bow and arrows as weapons.<sub>The source of this_chapter; elworld.com</sub>Archery used strength from the whole body and aimed to kill with one strike. It was ideal for those weak and unable to fight for long in battle.From then on, Lin Xun began to practice archery and he fell in love with the idea of killing with one hit.Although his body was now reborn and completely different than before, he didn't plan to abandon his archery skills.Sometimes using a bow and arrow could make it easier to kill an opponent, such as for long range and surprise attacks. Additionally, he could better protect himself as well as flee easily in unfavorable situations.In short, although Lin Xun's combat methods were simple, they were extremely comprehensive. He had bows and arrows for long-range attacks and he could use his blade and fist arts for close-range attacks.However, Lin Xun knew it would be even better if he had learned escaping body arts. Unfortunately, Mister Lu didn't seem to be good at them and so he hadn't taught Lin Xun any.PU!Lin Xun pulled the arrow from the striped tiger's body and swiftly covered the tiger's corpse with the prepared rotten fish plant to mask the stench of blood.Then, he tied the striped tiger's corpse with a long and flexible sorrow ghost vine and hid it in the nearby bushes.The striped tiger was a savage beast even more powerful than a snow spotted leopard, but it still posed no threat to Lin Xun.After marking nearby, Lin Xun continued into the depths of the forest.Soon, the ground quaked and the mountains shook. With a flash, Lin Xun darted up a tree. He quickly drew his bow, ready to shoot.From the noise it was obvious that a huge creature was heading his way!As expected, a three-horned bull was charging over, tearing down many ancient trees in its way. It looked extremely fierce and violent.Lin Xun's chest tightened. 'That beast could kill experts at the fifth-layer True Martial Stage with its incredible strength. It's so bloodthirsty that even tigers and leopards fled at the sight of it!'But Lin Xun soon noticed something was wrong. The three-horned bull seemed to be terrified and was fleeing in panic.Lin Xun finally decided to not do anything. The bull was too dangerous for his current cultivation level, so unless he had no choice, he wouldn't want to risk his life.Fortunately, the bull bolted past and didn't seem to notice Lin Xun hiding on the huge tree. It quickly disappeared without a trace.Lin Xun continued his exploration in the forest when suddenly, roars rang in every direction.The roars were all filled with terror as though all the beasts in the forest were startled by something.Rumble\u2014<sub>The latest_epi_sodes are on_the elworld.com website.</sub>The ground violently quaked, the trees shook, and the branches and leaves rattled endlessly. If a person looked down from above, they would see beasts and animals bolting in every area of the forest. The creatures resembled torrents of water as they knocked down and smashed into towering trees along the way.What had happened?Lin Xun also realized that the situation didn't look good. He abandoned his hunt and put away his bow and arrow. With a flash, he appeared on the top of the tree canopy and peered into the distance. A battle was happening in a very far place.A black bear over tens of feet tall roared skywards. Its roar echoed like rumbling thunder. The bear pulverized several ancient trees with one palm strike. It simply possessed earth-shaking power.Its eyes shined like a pair of lanterns and its fur glowed with dark light. Fiendish qi was madly rushing out from it. Lin Xun felt oppressed even from watching it from a distance.Barbarian bear!In the Record of All Spirits, the barbarian bear was said to be an overlord in the mountain and possessed remarkable strength that could devastate mountains and destroy Spirit Dipper experts!The barbarian bear's opponent was a burly and tall figure that emitted dazzling golden light. Lin Xun couldn't see his face from that distance.But what made Lin Xun's heart quiver was that the burly figure seemed unafraid of the bear's attacks. He roamed freely in the air and suppressed the barbarian bear with just his fist. It was to the point that the bear couldn't raise its head and could only roar in fury.A powerful barbarian bear that could destroy Spirit Dipper experts was being completely suppressed by that unknown figure. In fact, that person was maneuvering with ease in the air!The tall and burly figure had to be a Spirit Sea cultivator!Only Spirit Sea cultivators had the ability to fly in the air!Lin Xun's heart quivered with shock. Why would a Spirit Sea cultivator appear in a poor mountain village of the Great Three Thousand Mountains?Boom!Before Lin Xun could figure out the reason, he heard a loud thud. The ancient tree he was standing atop was knocked down and made him tumble off the tree.However, Lin Xun's reaction was undoubtedly quick. He somersaulted in the air, tapped his feet on a branch and landed safely on the ground like a sparrowhawk.\u201cHuh?!\u201dLin Xun noticed a five to six-year-old girl speeding towards him. She wore an animal skin dress and her snow-white feet were bare. Her long black hair billowed behind her as she bolted, highlighting her beautiful and perfect face.The little girl was visibly surprised to see Lin Xun, She frantically babbled, as if telling Lin Xun to run.Lin Xun also knew that the situation didn't look good. He nodded and was about to thank her when his vision suddenly blurred. The little girl grabbed him by his lapel as she rushed past.Lin Xun couldn't help but tremble. A six to seven old little girl who didn't quite reach Lin Xun's chest was able to effortlessly pick him up like a little chick.<sub>You can_find the rest of this_content on the elworld.com platform.</sub>But what shocked him the most was that she grabbed him before he could even see what happened let alone dodge!Hu\u2014 Hu\u2014The sound of the wind rushing past his ears was the only sound he heard. When Lin Xun realized that the little girl seemed to have no bad intentions towards him, he inwardly breathed a sigh of relief.Immediately afterwards, he felt waves surging in his heart. 'I am now at the third-layer True Martial Stage yet a little girl could lift me up while running. How much stronger is her cultivation compared to mine?'Rumble!Lin Xun couldn't think about it too much because he saw sections of forest collapse one after another and all kinds of beasts fleeing chaotically.It was indeed best to leave as soon as possible if he wanted to live.Soon, the little girl rushed out of the forest with Lin Xun. Then, Lin Xun couldn't help asking, \u201cLittle girl\u2026\u201dHe abruptly stopped.A shaft of golden light suddenly streaked across the sky.Boom!Almost at the same time, a fist filled with aeth power blasted down from the sky towards the little girl!As though she was able to predict the future, the little girl swiftly evaded the attack with Lin Xun, leaving the fist to smash a huge pit into the ground.The terrifying shockwaves from the impact rapidly spread across the area, causing the little girl's slim body to totter side to side until she lost her balance and fell with Lin Xun.So terrifying!Lin Xun's pupils shrank, but before he could react, another fist shrouded in dazzling golden light smashed through the air.One punch followed another. Let alone the fact that Lin Xun only possessed the strength of the third-layer True Martial Stage, even if he was at the Spirit Dipper Stage, he couldn't evade in time.The attacks were too terrifying and came too suddenly. It was impossible to strike back.However, at that critical moment, Lin Xun heard a voice explode in his ears. \u201cA mere brute dares to act so arrogantly in the Ziyao Empire's territory!\u201dEvery word echoed like thunder, shaking the world.Lin Xun felt everything blur before an unparalleled force engulfed him and the little girl. They just barely avoided the terrifying destructive punch and landed ten feet away.<sub>The source of this_chapter; elworld.com</sub>It was then that Lin Xun could clearly see that under the blue sky stood a man clad in a resplendent azure wide-sleeved robe. His hair was tied up in a bun and he hovered gracefully in the air on a blue pine patterned sword.His ethereal and graceful bearing made him resemble an immortal!FavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Every one of his muscles appeared as hard as rocks and was filled with explosive power.His hair and beard were sharp as a spear and his eyes flashed like lightning. Even just standing there, he exuded an imposing, mountain-like bearing.When the azure-robed man appeared, the blue pine patterned sword at his feet buzzed and shot into the air with incredible speed.Shua!The sword flashed like a rainbow as it slashed down from the sky!Lin Xun felt stabbing pain in his eyes. The sword qi, as strong as the scorching afternoon sun, seemed capable of wiping out the world.Almost at the same time, the mighty man acted. With a thunderous roar, he wielded his flaming golden fist through the airRumble\u2014The sky shook and the clouds were torn apart. The impact from the collision of aeth power made the world lose its color.The collision was too terrifying. Of course, how could the battle between two top Spirit Sea cultivators be trivial?There was a saying in the Ziyao Empire: once Spirit Sea cultivators acted, the impact of disaster would engulf everyone and bring unimaginable damage!Even if the battle didn't take place in a populated city, the destructive power was enough to crumble rocks and trees and cause the ground within a radius of hundred meters to crack like a cobweb. The beasts who couldn't escape in time exploded in a rain of blood and flesh.Lin Xun didn't dare to look at such a horrifying scene. He rolled the little girl under him, shielding her while he circulated all his strength to protect them.The difference in strength was too tremendous!Lin Xun was only at the third-layer True Martial Stage. It was difficult for him to even survive the impact from the battle of the Spirit Sea Stage cultivators, let alone escape.It was as though his life and death were already beyond his control!Right now, Lin Xun could only pray that the battle would quickly end.Rumble\u2014The battle continued fiercely, and the collisions echoed like thunder, quaking the surroundings. Lin Xun felt his eardrums throb with pain as his qi and blood tumbled violently within his body and his spirit shuddered endlessly. He almost coughed up blood from the discomfort.<sub>Visit elworld.com, for the best no_vel_read_ing experience</sub>He didn't dare to think too much. He subconsciously operated the Star Cycle of the Little Divine Meditation Art. Combining his heart and mind into one, he began to visualize the 'stars shining and revolving in the sky\u201d.Following that, his spirit no longer throbbed and his consciousness became empty and clear. All negative emotions faded like the tide, disappearing.Suddenly, Lin Xun realized that the outside world was clearly reflected in his mind even with his eyes closed.Under the sky, the azure-robed man's sleeve billowed around him as he wielded an ancient blue sword. The sword, fierce and swift as lightning, produced a dragon-like roar as it radiated and filled the sky with terrifying sword qi.Opposite the azure-robed man stood the mighty burly man, who looked a little discomposed. His rock-like skin was riddled with sword wounds and his muscles were flowing with blood. In particular, his fists were torn open with bone-deep wounds.Even if the mighty man was covered with wounds, he still looked fearsome and exuded the same murderous aura like he didn't notice the wounds.\u201cRuling Sword Art!\u201dSuddenly, the azure-robed man seemed a little impatient and unleashed a long roar. The ancient azure sword's aura suddenly changed.Chi!Like a streak of lightning piercing the darkness, it disappeared in a flash.This sword was unbelievably fast. Lin Xun failed to even capture a trace of it in his mind!The mighty man grunted. His arm was slashed off and blood jetted across the sky!\u201cRuling Sword Art!\u201dThe azure-robed man's aura grew stronger and stronger. Like a legendary sword immortal, his sword could turn the world upside down!It was obvious that he wanted to kill the ferocious man.Li\u2014!At that critical juncture, a giant bird swooped down and cut the clouds with its blade-like wings.Its entire body glistened with golden light, as if it was constructed from gold, and its wings spanned over tens of feet.It rescued the mighty man with unbelievable speed like a bolt of lightning as if it was a mirage!The sudden change caught the azure-robed man off guard. Just as he was about to give chase, the golden bird had already vanished into the horizon.\u201cThe golden light eagle of darkness!\u201dThe azure-robed man uttered bitterly, \u201cI didn't expect the brute warrior to come from there\u2026\u201dThe battle came to an end.Lin Xun didn't care about the brute or the golden light eagle, He couldn't help but breathe a long sigh of relief when the battle ended. It was only then that he felt the burning pain on his back. He stroked his back to find blood flowing down rapidly. He was clearly wounded from the battle.<sub>Visit elworld.com for a better_reading experience</sub>Fortunately, it was just an external wound and no bones were damaged.He pulled the little girl up and was relieved to see her unwounded.\u201cAre you two okay?\u201d asked the azure-robed man as he came over. The area was already destroyed with signs of the earth shaking battle everywhere.Lin Xun hurriedly bowed his thanks. \u201cThank you, Lord, for your help.\u201dIt was only then that he realized that the azure-robed man was young and handsome. His every movement and gesture exhibited a noble aura.\u201cI'm glad you two are okay. I didn't expect there to be brute warriors in the Great Three Thousand Mountains. Could they also be here for the peerless treasure?\u201d The azure-robed man lightly sighed, as if he was mumbling to himself.Peerless treasure?Lin Xun was taken aback.\u201cYou two should quickly leave.\u201dThe azure-robed man swept a glance over Lin Xun and the little girl. From their appearance, he guessed they were villagers from the mountains and so he gave up on asking them about the current situation.\u201cCan we ask for your name? If there's a chance in the future, I will definitely repay your kindness,\u201d said Lin Xun seriously and with a cupped fist salute.The azure-robed man looked prideful but he was a good person. At the very least, he had saved their lives. This was a huge debt.\u201cRepay me?\u201dThe azure-robed man was first taken aback as though he found it very interesting. Then, he shook his head. \u201cYou just need to take good care of yourself. As for me\u2026just think of me as a passerby.\u201dWith a flash, he soared into the air, his clothes billowing.\u201cPasserby?\u201dLin Xun's gratitude intensified. From the man's words, it was clear that he helped Lin Xun out of good will and he had never expected Lin Xun to repay him.\u201cWhat a nice guy,\u201d exclaimed Lin Xun admiringly.The little girl next to Lin Xun seemed a little strange. She had blankly stood there like a lost soul since the battle had ended. She paid no attention to everything around her and just stared dazedly into the forest. Her stunningly beautiful face was flickering with deep sorrow.Lin Xun couldn't help but ask softly, \u201cLittle girl, did you lose your parents?\u201d\u201cYiyi yaya.\u201dThe little girl shook her head while uttering some complicated and incomprehensible sound.Lin Xun was startled. What language is that?Seeing that Lin Xun didn't understand, the little girl bit her lip and sighed. She said nothing else after that.<sub>Visit elworld.com, for the best no_vel_read_ing experience</sub>\u201cBy the way, thank you for helping me just now.\u201dLin Xun remembered how the little girl carried him and fled in the forest. Although he found it strange, he still expressed his gratitude to the little girl.\u201cYiyi yaya.\u201dThe little girl raised her head and her jet-black, crescent moon-shaped eyes widened. Her expression was extremely blank as though she didn't understand what Lin Xun said.\u201cUh\u2026\u201dLin Xun scratched his head, muttering to himself, 's this little girl a child of the wild men in the mountains?He had heard from the villagers of Feiyun Village that in the depths of the Great Three Thousand Mountains were not only all kinds of monsters, demons and beasts, but also many primitive people and savages.However, the little girl's delicate and beautiful appearance made Lin Xun dispel that thought. How could a savage look so pretty?Suddenly, the little girl furrowed her eyebrows. Her eyes dropped and everything darkened. Her slender and delicate body fell forward.Lin Xun subconsciously held the little girl's body. He immediately checked her condition, and seeing that she had just passed out, he inwardly breathed a sigh of relief.Without further delay, Lin Xun hurried back to Feiyun Village with the little girl on his back.Along the way, Lin Xun couldn't help but shake his head and sigh as he recalled his experience in the mountains. He was rather speechless. He had just wanted to hunt some beasts for food. Who would have thought that he would suffer a great upheaval.First, the brute warrior killed a barbarian bear and created chaos amongst the beasts. Then, he witnessed a world-shaking battle between the brute warrior and the azure-robed man and he almost lost his life.He luckily survived in the end and he saved a little girl who couldn't even speak\u2026He had to abandon his hunt and take the unconscious little girl back home. He was between laughter and tears at the thought of his encounters.However, Lin Xun felt it was a lucky coincidence that he had the opportunity to witness a battle between two Spirit Sea cultivators. As a result of this, he realised just how powerful cultivators were and that increased his dedication to cultivation even more.If he possessed the power to destroy the world, he wouldn't be as helpless as he was today!I must become stronger! Lin Xun vowed to himself.Hundreds of miles away, the azure-robed man took out an exquisite jade edict while flying in the air.The Heavenly Seer, the empire's stargazing platform, issued the edict more than a month ago, and only the most powerful figures in the Ziyao Empire knew about it and had it.\u201cA phenomenon will descend upon the Great Three Thousand Mountains in the southwest of the empire. The phenomenon is mysterious and unpredictable. Even with my powers, I can't possibly pry into its mystery. A peerless treasure will likely appear. I hope Your Majesty will treat this matter with caution\u2026\u201dThe azure-robed man recited the edict as a ruminative expression crept into his eyes. \u201cCould the brute warrior have come for it also?\u201dHe couldn't help sighing softly, \u201cBut where is the peerless treasure?

A battle between two Spirit Sea cultivators was so shocking that he thought it was better to not let the villagers know about it.While speaking, a thought struck Lin Xun's mind and he exclaimed, \u201cVillage Chief, on my return I saw many beasts dead in the forest. It's an unexpected harvest.\u201dXiao Tianren's eyes lit up. This was undoubtedly good news! The villagers could fulfil their desire for food if they gathered the beasts' corpses.Additionally, their fur and bones could be exchanged for considerable money!Without hesitation, Xiao Tianren hurriedly set off with a dozen strong villagers.Everyone was so preoccupied that they forgot to ask Lin Xun who was the little girl on his back\u2014When Lin Xun got home, he carried the little girl to his bed and tucked her in. Then, he prepared a hot towel to clean the dust off her face.The little girl's smooth, glistening jade-like skin and her stunning yet peaceful face took Lin Xun's breath away.'Her face\u2026is too beautiful!'She was only five to six years old, but the beauty of her exquisite facial features was so ethereal. Her beauty was like a delicate lotus flower in the misty rain and it outshone everything in the world.Even Lin Xun, who had a strong mind, couldn't help feeling astonished. It was only after a good while that he muttered, \u201cShe's so beautiful already, what would she look like when she grows up? She will likely become a peerless beauty\u2026\u201dThe little girl seemed very mysterious and didn't seem like a resident of the Ziyao Empire.This was obvious from her incomprehensible language and her animal skin dress.Most importantly, even if she was only five to six years old, she concealed an extremely powerful force within her young and slim body.Lin Xun couldn't forget how the little girl carried him in her arms like a little chick when they were in the forest. At that time, he couldn't even react before he was being dragged away by her.How could an ordinary little girl do that?Moreover, although the battle happened abruptly, Lin Xun somehow felt that the brute wasn't trying to kill him but the little girl!<sub>Visit elworld.com for a better_reading experience</sub>Why would a Spirit Sea cultivator attack a little girl?This was another mystery that puzzled Lin Xun.To sum up, the little girl who was sleeping soundly had many secrets!\u201cNever mind. I shouldn't think about it too much since it has nothing to do with me.\u201dLin Xun shook his head, turned around and headed into the kitchen.The little girl had a dream.In her dream, she was frantically running amidst earth-shattering battle cries and howls of pain.Her heart was filled with grief, indignation, helplessness and panic.She didn't know where she was running but she knew that death would take her away if she stopped.After fleeing in panic for an unknown period of time, the girl sensed something and suddenly turned her head. She saw a scene that almost made her collapse.A black bear over tens of feet tall suddenly dropped to the ground, and opposite the bear stood a burly man emitting golden light all over his body.Why?Why did that happen?An indescribable pain surged in the little girl's heart and made her wail in grief.However, she felt a hand wipe her tears, and the warmth of that hand, which felt like her mother's embrace, calmed her terrifying and sad feelings.She wanted to turn her head to see who it was.But at this time, she woke from her dream.The little girl opened her eyes and saw a handsome face and a pair of bright eyes filled with empathy and warmth.She remembered the face and the scent of the person because it had made her spirit feel happy and comfortable.On the day she killed the lava wolf, she had smelled that scent, but not as clearly as she did now.\u201cYou're awake.\u201dLin Xun couldn't help smiling when he saw the little girl had awakened. He picked up the bowl of aeth grain and urged, \u201cYou should eat something first.\u201dThe little girl stared blankly at Lin Xun and then at the steaming-hot and fragrant bowl in his hands. She suddenly felt very hungry.<sub>For more_novel, visit elworld.com</sub>She got up and slurped down the bowl of aeth grains.

The little girl is so small but she has such a huge appetite.But he was glad to see her eating since it indicated that her condition wasn't serious.Lin Xun brought over the entire pot and the smile on his lips slowly froze as he watched the little girl finish one bowl after another. She eats so well.It didn't take long for her to devour the entire pot of aeth grains. The little girl licked her lips in satisfaction and babbled something at Lin Xun.Unable to understand, Lin Xun simply stared at the beautiful little foodie to figure out what she wanted to say from her expression.\u201cRest well. You don't need to thank me.\u201dLin Xun stacked the dishes and walked out of the house. He gazed at the twilight sky and felt a little worried and upset. Who are the little girl's parents? How could they be so cruel to abandon her in the forest?If she stays with me forever, I definitely won't have enough food to eat\u2014However, Xiao Tianren soon brought good news to Lin Xun.Just as night was about to fall, Xiao Tianren and the villagers finally returned with sacks of beasts!Among them were snow spotted leopards, vined pythons, blood-thorned boars...and even a rare iron-beaked mountain pheasant!A group of strong villagers, who were drenched in sweat, brought over dozens of beast bodies to Lin Xun's courtyard.Xiao Tianren was high-spirited and his excitement was evident in his voice. Before Lin Xun asked, he motioned enthusiastically. \u201cTake what you need. We will make another trip before it gets dark. We unexpectedly picked up so much this time. Thank you, heavens!\u201dBefore Lin Xun could say anything, Xiao Tianren happily left with the others. Seeing them rolling up their sleeves, Lin Xun knew they intended to go all out.Lin Xun dumbly rushed to the door and saw not only Xiao Tianren and the other strong villagers, but also the women and children of the village.

He wouldn't have to worry about food anymore!In the next few days, the villagers constantly traveled back and forth between the ancient forest in the mountains and Feiyun Village like they were celebrating a festival. They brought back a lot of prey.However, the majority of their haul were wild beasts and fierce beasts. There were rarely any savage beasts.<sub>For more_novel, visit elworld.com</sub>Even so, the beast corpses piled up like a mountain in Lin Xun's courtyard. It was a rather spectacular sight.Lin Xun had no use for the wild beasts and fierce beasts, so Xiao Tianren distributed them to other households in the village.Xiao Tianren and the villagers learnt about the little girl living in Lin Xun's house. They didn't say anything but every villager was stunned when they saw her beautifully perfect face.Xiao Tianren was no exception.As for the little kids, they went cross eyed when they saw the little girl. They looked silly but extremely funny. They originally planned to play with her, but they all chickened out as though they feared to contaminate her beauty.Lin Xun found their actions very funny, but his head ached a little. Sometimes it is very hard to approach someone too beautiful.In the end, Lin Xun asked Aunt Qiao who lived in the village to help create a hooded animal skin cloak for the little girl to cover her flawless face. He felt a lot more at ease after that.The only thing that puzzled Lin Xun was that the little girl was very withdrawn and she never wanted to socialize with other people except him.Moreover, Lin Xun noticed that the little girl's seemingly-calm gaze was always detached and indifferent.The indifference and detachedness only disappeared when she was facing Lin XunWhy was that?Lin Xun didn't understand.However, after a few days, Lin Xun finally learnt the little girl's name\u2014Xia Zhi.A very unusual and special name.He knew nothing about her except for her name. But there was nothing he could do about it since they couldn't communicate.However, what surprised Lin Xun was that, in just a few days, Xia Zhi had already understood him and even learned to say some simple words and sentences.Undoubtedly, beneath the little girl's stunning face was a remarkable intelligence and learning ability, which was by no means inferior to her beauty!Lin Xun was an orphan, and so he treated Xia Zhi, who he thought was as lonely as him, like a little sister.Another three days passed.The villagers went to the ancient forest in the mountains and found that there was no longer any prey to pick up. Their sweeping operation finally ended.The number of beast corpses piled up in Lin Xun's house was close to thirty!Lin Xun worked very hard in those days. He spent almost all his time dissecting the beast corpses because the corpses would rot.

    "Chapter 34": "Chapter 34\nJun 11, 2022Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 34 Storm DescendsGrumble\u2014In the courtyard, a pile of wood logs was burning furiously, and smoke was billowing upwards from the huge bubbling iron pot set up in the center of the courtyard.Dozens of materials were boiling in the iron pot, including medicinal herbs and the flesh and blood of different beasts.It wasn't a decoction but the extraction of rune ink.Generally speaking, rune masters required a special ink furnace to extract rune ink. Some precious ink furnaces were even engraved with runes, in the same way that aeth tools often had runes engraved on them.However, Lin Xun wasn't yet able to construct an ink furnace and so he had to use an iron pot to extract rune ink.The rune ink extracted in such a way would only have ordinary effects and it was sort of wasteful of rune materials, but it could still be used.Lin Xun was extracting a pot of scarlet fire rune ink.The formula for extracting scarlet fire rune ink was commonly known. However, if a slightly different combination of rune materials were to be used, it would have extremely different effects.For example, the violet sun flower, which was used to extract scarlet fire rune ink, had different grades. The three-leaved violet sun flower was the most common and also exhibited the most common effect. The rarest nine-leaf violet sun flower had the most optimum effect.The scarlet fire rune ink that Lin Xun refined only consisted of various average quality rune materials, but he was still satisfied with the result.Lin Xun didn't sit and do nothing while the rune ink was being refined. He repeatedly polished a half-foot-long purple bone that was around the thickness of a chopstick on a grinder.The dark purple bone, which had been removed from the leg bone of a savage beast called an ironbeak mountain pheasant, was a precious rune material.Its value was attributed to the fact it could be made into a brush!Unlike regular brushes, rune brushes were razor-sharp like blades. A rune brush was an essential tool for engraving runes and thus were also called a rune blade.The grade of a brush was determined by the quality of the materials it was constructed from. The higher the grade of a brush, the better it could communicate with a rune master's perception and aeth power.A high-grade brush allowed a rune master to precisely control the rune ink's power when engraving runes and the engraved rune would satisfy a rune master's requirement in density, thickness and straightness.Ever since the dark gray brush, which Mister Lu left to Lin Xun, had disappeared, Lin Xun had no brush available to practise the art of runes.Fortunately, among the prey that the villagers collected there happened to be an ironbeak mountain pheasant, whose leg bones were precious brush-making materials.Chi!The purple bone produced screeches and sparks as Lin Xun constantly polished it until it faintly took the shape of a brush.<sub>Try the elworld.com platform_for the most advanced_reading experience.</sub>Snow-white beast bones were stacked all over Lin Xun's courtyard and a thousand kilograms of beast meat hung across his walls like a mountain of meat.Additionally, Lin Xun had categorized the beast skins, tendons, scales, claws, and horns piled them in an orderly manner.They were all valuable treasures that could be used in medicine decoctions, rune ink extractions or exchanged for other supplies.This was all the result of Lin Xun's hard work for the past few days.Xiao Tianren and the others had brought back too much. Nearly thirty savage beast corpses were distributed to Lin Xun.There were more wild beasts and fierce beasts, but Lin Xun had little use for them and divided them amongst the households in the village.Therefore, Lin Xun wasn't the only one busy in the past few days. The villagers got up early and slept late to salt and process the beast meat to preserve them for later use.It was only several days later that Lin Xun had finally finished dissecting all the savage beast corpses, leaving all of the valuable parts.The smell of blood hung in the air for days, but Lin Xun was wholeheartedly focussed on sharpening the dark purple bone and didn't seem to notice it at all.After the time to burn an incense had passed.The rune brush was finally completed. Lin Xun got up to clean the dust off the brush with clear spring water and unveiled the rune brush's true face.Under the sunlight, the slender and straight brush was entirely dark purple. Its body was heavy and unshowy, while the tip, emitting dazzling light, was as sharp as a blade and as thin as a cicada's wings.Lin Xun silently held the brush, feeling the wisps of aeth power circulating inside and its subtle changes.The start of a satisfied smile tugged at one corner of his mouth. The rune brush would be fully completed once he refined it with rune materials using some unique methods.The iron pot suddenly sizzled and crackled as though it was about to explode.The rune ink was ready!Lin Xun couldn't take care of anything else and urgently put out the fire. He waited until the iron pot cooled down before he went over with a clean porcelain bowl.The pot of rune materials had been refined down to a bowl's worth of an amber-like liquid. The liquid was bright red and translucent and seemed to be burning and producing a refreshing aroma at the same time.Scarlet fire rune ink!It looked like an elixir used for cultivation but it wasn't for consumption.As Lin Xun carefully poured the scarlet fire rune ink into the porcelain bowl, the smile on his lips grew. By night, he would be ready to engrave runes.<sub>For more_novel, visit elworld.com</sub>Xia Zhi had appeared next to Lin Xun without him realizing earlier. She pointed to the scarlet fire rune ink and asked sweetly. \u201cCan it be eaten?\u201dBut her question made Lin Xun jump and frantically shake his head. \u201cThis isn't food, it's poisonous if eaten.\u201dXia Zhi sighed and stood to one side.\u201cI'll make you something good tonight.\u201dLin Xun rubbed Xia Zhi's little head and walked into the house.Xia Zhi scrunched up her brows, as though she disliked being touched by Lin Xun. She stood there thinking it over and finally decided not to make a fuss about it.She was indeed very unusual and completely different from the other children. She was extremely quiet and seldom spoke, but she was incredibly intelligent and learned at an astonishing speed.Lin Xun would talk to Xia Zhi when he was free but he didn't think she would learn the meaning of several phrases and even say some simple words and sentences in just a few days.For example, \u201cCan I eat this\u201d, \u201cI'm not full\u201d, \u201cI still want to eat\u201d, \u201cIs there anything to eat,\u201d and \u201cThis tastes good\u201d\u2026It was not surprising that Lin Xun regarded Xia Zhi as a beautiful little foodie. All the sentences she had learned involved food.In the evening, Village Chief Xiao Tianren came to Lin Xun's courtyard.He seemed to be in a hurry. As soon as he saw Lin Xun, he said directly, \u201cI'm ready. I can set off tomorrow.\u201dLin Xun smiled, \u201cIt's earlier than I expected.\u201dA few days ago, after a long discussion, Lin Xun and Xiao Tianren had decided to move all the villagers to a safe place before Lian Rufeng and his people returned.This was to ensure the villagers safety.Although they weren't sure what Lian Rufeng and the others were plotting, they knew it wouldn't be anything good.\u201cHaha, speaking of it, we were lucky to have that beast calamity. It allowed us to acquire a huge amount of prey, which if preserved, would last the villagers for a period.\u201dXiao Tianren laughed heartily.Lin Xun also laughed. \u201cUncle Xiao, it's decided then. Please take everyone to the abandoned mine tomorrow to hide until I get rid of Lian Rufeng and the others. After that, we won't have any more worries.\u201dXiao Tianren nodded. Then, he assumed a serious expression and asked, \u201cLin Xun, it will be dangerous. You could lose your life if you fail. We don't mind just accepting defeat. I doubt Lian Rufeng and the others would kill us all. So long as the mountains remain, there will always be firewood.\u201d\u201cUncle Xiao, the other villagers might have options to retreat, but if you and I fail, we no doubt would be killed. So, we have to succeed!\u201d stated Lin Xun. His eyes calm and didn't have the slightest hint of a ripple<sub>For more_novel, visit elworld.com</sub>His voice was resolute.Xiao Tianren knew that Lian Rufeng had endured him for a long enough time and wouldn't let him live if he had the chance.He also knew that Lin Xun had no other route to take after killing Lu Ting and Qian Qi. His only option was to kill Lian Rufeng or be killed by Lian Rufeng.Thinking of that, Xiao Tianren's heart felt heavy and he couldn't help but scrunch his brows in worry. \u201cThen, are you ready?\u201dLin Xun nodded. \u201cI have one final step to make first.\u201dXiao Tianren patted Lin Xun's shoulder and said, \u201cBe careful. If you lose, you must flee. The Great Three Thousand Mountains are very vast. Lian Rufeng can't do anything to you if you manage to run away. Remember, you have to stay alive.\u201dA warmth filled Lin Xun's heart. \u201cDon't worry, Uncle Xiao, I know.\u201dXiao Tianren gazed at Lin Xun for a good while before he turned away and left.But he reminded Lin Xun again as he walked out the door, \u201cRemember, staying alive is more important than everything.\u201dHis hoarse voice drifted in the air like blood red ink.Lin Xun smiled, then he turned around and returned to his room. Yes, I can only get revenge if I'm still alive. Everything is over when one dies.He had understood the meaning behind that statement long ago.In the early morning of the next day, a group of villagers packed their luggage and left the village under Xiao Tianren's leadership.They were just ordinary people and not cultivators. They didn't have the strength to fight back against true cultivators and so they would only be a burden to Lin Xun if they stayed in the village.Standing at the village entrance, Lin Xun silently watched them leave the village. Then, he turned and returned to the cold and empty village, his expression calm as always.The autumn wind sighed and leaden clouds covered all of the sky, creating an oppressive, suffocating feeling that made it seem like a storm was descending soon.Although Lian Rufeng and the others hadn't returned, Lin Xun knew they would soon\u2026\u201cAre you going into battle?\u201dWhen Lin Xun returned to his house, he saw Xia Zhi waiting for him at the door.Lin Xun nodded. He knew that he couldn't hide the truth from her given her intelligence.\u201cI will help you.\u201dXia Zhi raised her head, revealing her beautiful face beneath the cloak. Her bright crescent-shaped eyes that resembled black jewels assumed the most serious expression.<sub>Foll_ow current_novel on elworld.com</sub>FavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The ground quaked and clouds of dust and dirt were whirled up into the air.Two mighty scaled horses headed the group and sitting astride one of them was Lian Rufeng. The other was a thin goateed man in bright silk clothing.The stranger was dressed in beautiful luxurious clothing and oozed arrogance and superiority; the old man clearly wasn't from the remote mountain village.A group of dozen guards consisting of those from Feiyun Village and the bodyguards of the old man closely followed Lian Rufeng and the old man.\u201cElder Wu, we will reach Feiyun Village in just over an hour.\u201dLian Rufeng smiled as he spoke, his expression respectful and obsequious.Elder Wu's full name was Wu Henshui. He was the chief steward of the Wu's Apothecary in the Qingyang Tribe and he possessed a cultivation base of the Big Cycle Stage, the eighth-layer True Martial Stage. He was extremely powerful and fierce.Even in the Qingyang Tribe where merchants often gathered, Wu Henshui enjoyed a resounding reputation and could be regarded as one of the top influential figures in the Qingyang Tribe.The Wu's Apothecary was precisely where Lian Rufeng and other village guards traded for supplies in the past years.It was also through Wu Henshui that Lian Rufeng successfully sent his son Lianfei to cultivate in Donglin City.To Lian Rufeng, Wu Henshui was a master with extreme intelligence and remarkable abilities. He couldn't help but treat him with respectWu Henshui nodded indifferently, and then he suddenly asked, \u201cHave you heard of Blood Essence Sand?\u201dTaken aback, Lian Rufeng asked in puzzlement, \u201cIs that the name of a medicinal plant?\u201dLian Rufeng's ignorance was clearly shown in his one question. Wu Henshui gave Lian Rufeng a sweeping, contemptuous glance and shook his head. The villagers from a mountain village are indeed extremely vulgar and ignorant.Although Lian Rufeng was a brute, he had sharp insight and he immediately knew that he had embarrassed himself. \u201cI wonder why Elder Wu suddenly mentioned that object?\u201dWu Henshui pondered for a moment before he answered, \u201cThere's no harm in telling you. I heard that there is an abandoned Feiyun Fire Copper ore vein near your village.\u201dLian Rufeng nodded. \u201cCorrect.\u201dWu Henshui said, \u201cThen you should know that generally, places with Feiyun Fire Copper attract blood red bats because it provides an ideal environment for them to nest.\u201dLian Rufeng nodded repeatedly and exclaimed in an ingratiating tone, \u201cElder Wu is indeed knowledgeable. I remember that there are indeed blood red bats in the abandoned mine. I had always treated it as a forbidden place because I was worried about the dangers I would encounter. I would have forgotten about it if not for your reminder.\u201dWu Henshui stroked his goatee as he said smugly, \u201cIt's a coincidence. I happened to read an ancient book a while back and it recorded that Blood Essence Sand are found in places where blood red bats nest. Blood Essence Sand is valuable. One grain can be exchanged for ten copper coins.\u201dLian Rufeng immediately flattered Wu Henshui. \u201cElder Wu's eyes are as illuminating as the brightest torches. A vulgar person like me can't be compared to you. But what sort of wonderful uses does Blood Essence Sand have?\u201d<sub>Foll_ow new_episo_des on the elworld.com platform.</sub>Pleased with the compliment, Wu Henshui didn't mind giving Lian Rufeng pointers. \u201cIt's very precious because it can improve one's blood, essence and body. It can increase a cultivator's chance of breaking through the fifth-layer True Martial Stage by at least twenty percent.\u201dLian Rufeng's heart violently quivered, \u201cIt's that amazing?\u201dHe had stagnated at the fourth-layer True Martial Stage and hadn't been able to make a breakthrough.If Blood Essence Sand could refine a person's blood and essence, how could Lian Rufeng not be astounded by this fact?Wu Henshui looked at Lian Rufeng with a ruminative expression and said, \u201cYou\u2014you are still lacking.\u201dLian Rufeng suddenly asked, \u201cElder Wu, did you come for Blood Essence Sand?\u201dWu Henshui nodded. \u201cThat's one of the reasons. The other is for the aeth fields near Feiyun Village.\u201dLian Rufeng smiled and said, \u201cYou won't have to worry about that. I have been preparing for a long time. I guarantee that I will complete the task.\u201dLian Rufeng had been plotting with Wu Henshui to occupy the aeth fields of Feiyun Village!Given their contributions in that task, Lian Rufeng and his people believed they could establish themselves in the Qingyang Tribe and then carve out a territory in Donglin City through their relationship with Wu Henshui.As to whether the villagers in Feiyun Village would agree or object, Lian Rufeng didn't care. Why would he care about their opinions more than his future cultivation path?So what if they objected?To him, they were just ordinary people and no different than lowly ants.Wu Henshui said indifferently, \u201cThat would be good. When those aeth fields are planted with aeth herbs, it will fetch even more money than they do now, and I won't forget to give you a share then.\u201dLian Rufeng's face lit up. \u201cI must thank Elder Wu for taking care of me.\u201dWhile they were talking, the aeth fields came into their sights and the village outline became faintly visible.Aeth grains were sprouting in the aeth fields. Like green silk fabric, the verdant fields covered the entire area and were extremely pleasing to the eye.\u201cWe've arrived!\u201dAs Lian Rufeng gazed at the familiar village and aeth fields, his heart blazed ferociously. I will be able to continue my grand plans once I complete today's mission.The guards behind him also couldn't contain their excitement.\u201cWhat a waste. Such good aeth fields are just growing aeth grains. Isn't that wasteful for such a good place?\u201dWu Henshui ran his eyes over the aeth grains sprouting in the aeth fields and he couldn't help but shake his head.\u201cElder Wu, are there good and bad aeth fields?\u201d asked Lian Rufeng.<sub>The source of this_chapter; elworld.com</sub>Wu Henshui shot him a look of disdain and said, \u201cHow much land is there in the Great Three Thousand Mountains? How much of it could be used as aeth fields?\u201dHe pointed to the aeth fields in the distance and continued, \u201cTake a look, there are strands of aeth veins underneath each aeth field. Otherwise how would there be such rich soil? You country bumpkins really are ignorant.\u201dEven if Lian Rufeng was furious about the insult, he still put on an ingratiating smile. \u201cElder Wu is right. We are indeed too ignorant.\u201dWu Henshui snorted. \u201cWhat arrangements do you have for the residents in your village?\u201d\u201cIf they are willing to help you plant aeth herbs, then that would be best. But if they don't\u2026I have no choice but to kill them!\u201d Lian Rufeng said coldly through gritted teeth.Wu Henshui nodded. \u201cIt's indeed better to keep them alive. We are going to need many people to plant and harvest aeth herbs. I don't want to waste money to purchase another group of slaves.\u201dLian Rufeng nodded enthusiastically. \u201cElder Wu is right.\u201dWu Henshui didn't want to waste time talking nonsense. He commanded, \u201cGo, let's go to the village and take a look.\u201dSuddenly, the group of men on horseback clattered towards Feiyun Village in a blatantly mighty manner, showing their arrogance.To them, only a group of country bumpkins were living in Feiyun Village. They felt no need to draw up a strategy to deal with such people. They could just storm the village and kill them directly.Wu Henshui and Lian Rufeng shared the same thought and so did all the other guards.However, what they didn't expect was that Feiyun Village would be completely different than a few months ago.Just as they arrived at the village entrance, a sharp ear-piercing screech almost took their souls away.\u201cThis is bad! An ambush!\u201dWu Henshui's expression changed ever so slightly as he pulled back the reins and halted the horse.Lian Rufeng felt a chill in his heart and his hair stood on end. He subconsciously spun around his horse to hide.Bang!A beam of sharp black light narrowly brushed past Lian Rufeng's shoulder and pierced into the chest of a guard behind him. Blood wildly gushed in all directions.It was an arrow fired with incredible speed!If Lian Rufeng hadn't evaded in time, the arrow could have taken his life.Lian Rufeng was drenched in cold sweat, but before he could react, the arrow that shot past him into the guard's chest suddenly exploded.Boom!Like a thunderstorm, the guard's body exploded into pieces and blood sputtered everywhere. The surrounding guards were so shocked that they couldn't even dodge and were all hit with the gruesome aftermath<sub>Visit elworld.com for a better_reading experience</sub>\u201cBastard! Is this what you've been preparing these days?\u201dAlthough furious and shocked, Wu Henshui maintained his composure. He somersaulted off his horse and hid behind the horse's butt with a guarded gaze.\u201cElder Wu, please calm down.\u201dLian Rufeng clenched his teeth, his eyes glinted fiercely. He suddenly drew his blade with a slashing stroke and roared, \u201cDon't panic. Everyone, be ready to fight!\u201dYong\uff01Before his voice faded, the familiar whistle rang again. An arrow blasted over from the village like a shooting star.Boom!Another guard failed to evade in time. He, together with his horse, exploded into smithereens. His flesh and blood flew all over the place.Two arrows had taken the lives of two guards in a flash!The sudden attack threw the guards into chaos. Everyone abandoned their horses and hid far away.They couldn't locate the enemy's position and only knew that the arrows were fired from the village.Naturally, Lian Rufeng also saw that. Terrified and irritated, he turned ashen-faced. When did an expert archer come to the village?An archer who could kill a cultivator wouldn't be an ordinary one!\u201cCould it be that little bastard Lin Xun? No, it can't be. I told Lu Ting and Qian Qi to watch over the village. That kid should be dead by now...Wait, it can't be!\u201dLian Rufeng realized that he hadn't seen Lu Ting and Qian Qi.\u201cRidiculous. Quickly charge into the village. Do you want to stay here and act as live targets?\u201dWu Henshui had a wealth of combat experience and so he knew that the leveled unsheltered ground they were on was extremely dangerous and that they would be exposed to attacks.However, he also wouldn't recklessly charge into the village. Just who knew how many masters were lying in ambush?Lian Rufeng snapped to his senses and thundered, \u201cBrothers, come with me to kill that damn archer!\u201dAs he roared, he bolted into a full speed dash into the village like a panther.The guards behind him panicked, but they also knew that they could be killed next if they didn't get rid of the enemy.They summoned up their courage and followed Lian Rufeng.Yong\uff01<sub>The source of this_chapter; elworld.com</sub>Just as they acted, the familiar screech pierced their ears again like the voice of death from hell!FavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

A guard swiftly blocked the arrow with his blade, but the collision between the two led to a tremendous blast.The guard howled in pain as his entire body exploded into pieces.Color drained from the faces of Lian Rufeng and the others. The fired arrow wasn't only fast, but also contained unimaginably immense power. It was impossible to block the arrow!\u201cThe enemy is there!\u201d yelled a guard while pointing to a place in the village.Lian Rufeng instantly spotted the archer. A familiar figure flashed from a stone roof in the village.Lin Xun?Lian Rufeng's pupils shrank. Could the archer really be that thirteen-year-old boy?\u201cCharge!\u201dThere was no time to deliberate. Lian Rufeng roared and led the way into the village.The village had a very complicated layout as well as many hiding places, making it difficult for archers to fully display their power.This contrasted with outside the village, where there were few places to conceal and hide. There, a person's location would be easily exposed and be treated as a live target.The guards all had a great deal of battle experience and so they understood such logic. They didn't hesitate to charge into the village with Lian Rufeng.Wu Henshui's face turned ashen. He had never imagined such a strong archer would be hiding in a little village.\u201cElder Wu, that fired arrow was incredibly powerful and doesn't seem to be an ordinary weapon. If my guess is correct, the arrow is engraved with the explosive flame rune!\u201d exclaimed a middle-aged man.He was one of Wu Henshui's capable subordinates and was called Han Junshan. He possessed a cultivation base of the fourth-layer True Martial Stage. Most importantly, he was a rune apprentice.Although Han Junshan had no hope of becoming a rune master due to his poor aptitude, he had practiced the art of runes and could identify them.Explosive flame rune?Wu Henshui gasped inwardly and then asked, \u201cYou mean there is a rune master in the village?\u201dHan Junshan shook his head. \u201cThere shouldn't be. The explosive flame rune is just a basic rune. I also have the confidence to engrave an explosive flame rune, but\u2026\u201d<sub>Visit elworld.com, for the best no_vel_read_ing experience</sub>\u201cBut what?\u201d asked Wu Henshui hurriedly.\u201cThe quality of the rune ink required to engrave the explosive flame rune is very high. Also, the rune is engraved on an arrow. An arrow with the explosive flame rune can be sold for 30 copper coins in Donglin City. I really can't imagine how something so precious can be found in a poor mountain village.\u201d Han Junshan frowned in puzzlement.Wu Henshui's eyelids twitched. \u201cYou mean, there is a master in this village?\u201dImmediately afterwards, he shook his head. \u201cNo, if there's a master in the village, there wouldn't be a need to ambush us. The enemy is likely not that strong in combat so he chose to attack in such a way.\u201dHan Junshan nodded, \u201cI think so too. The fired arrows must have exhausted the enemy's strength already. We will win if we seize this opportunity.\u201dWu Henshui's heart fluttered. \u201cSince that's the case, maybe we can find out where the arrows came from. It might make us a fortune!\u201dHan Junshan smiled in response. \u201cCorrect, who would have thought that this poor village not only has acres of aeth fields but also a place with Blood Essence Sand and treasures such as the explosive flame arrow?\u201dWu Henshui inhaled deeply and said coldly, \u201cThat's good, when Lian Rufeng and the others get rid of those country bumpkins, everything will belong to us!\u201dHan Junshan asked, \u201cElder Wu, should we go help out?\u201dWu Henshui sneered. Surveying the village from a distance, he said leisurely, \u201cA rich person does not sit under the eaves. It's better to leave this sort of thing to those country bumpkins.\u201dFeiyun Village wasn't big but the streets were winding and complicated. The houses were disjointed and most were in disrepair.It indeed wouldn't be easy to spot someone with the intention of hiding. Only Spirit Dipper experts could exercise their powerful power of consciousness to locate any traces. Other people could only search the village with their eyes and ears.Lin Xun wasn't worried about being found.He knew that his opponents were all at the True Martial Stage. The reason he moved the villagers away from the village was to take advantage of the village's complicated layout to launch attacks at the enemies.Moreover, he wouldn't need to worry about Lian Rufeng and the others threatening him with the villagers' lives.Hu\u2014Lin Xun panted heavily inside a house. He took out a water sack and gulped down the liquid.The water sack contained Aeth Refining Liquid, which could rapidly restore one's aeth power. Although he had only fired three arrows, it had consumed more than half of his aeth power.This huge consumption of power even occurred after he had reached the third layer True Martial Stage. Furthermore, his aeth power had been refined to its peak through the Aeth Power Vortexes. Otherwise, he wouldn't be able to fire three arrows in one go.Feeling his aeth power being restored, he looked calm but he felt a little disappointed.He had intended to kill Lian Rufeng with that surprise attack but he failed to do so.<sub>New novel_chap_ters are published here: elworld.com</sub>Thinking of that, Wu Henshui's figure emerged in Lin Xun's mind. He didn't know who he was, but his intuition told him that he was much more dangerous than Lian Rufeng!\u201cWhat would they be after that would make Lian Rufeng bring back a master?\u201dLin Xun furrowed his brows. He knew that the matter had become a little troublesome. He originally thought that he only had to deal with Lian Rufeng and the other guards. The unexpected appearance of a dangerous person of unknown background gave him significant pressure.His aeth power soon returned to normal. Full of energy, Lin Xun felt refreshed. He pushed all distracting thoughts out his mind.He took off the huge bone bow and changed to the Skybreaker Blade. He drew a deep breath before he sped out the room.The battle had already begun and the outcome had to be decided. So, Lin Xun couldn't think about other things.The village had lost its usual peacefulness. Footsteps, cries and roars rang out from time to time. It was obvious that Lian Rufeng and his party were aggressively hunting for Lin Xun.\u201cI have killed three but there's another twelve. The most dangerous one is the goateed old man. I also shouldn't underestimate Lian Rufeng\u2026\u201dSneaking cautiously along the alleys of the village, Lin Xun quickly assessed his situation.As he came to the corner of an alley, he suddenly halted his footsteps and his eyes glinted coldly. Despite there not being the slightest sound, he sensed danger approaching.Lin Xun held his breath and swiftly leaned against the corner of the wall, waiting quietly.Silently, a guard walked along the alley lightly and vigilantly. He tightly clasped a blade in one hand and a shield in the other.When Lin Xun and his gaze met, the distance between the two was only one meter.Shua!A beam of green light flashed. Without any hesitation Lin Xun performed the heavy split of the Six Word Blade. The force of the blade crashed down like a mountain.The guard rapidly reacted. Instead of retreating, with a loud roar, he simultaneously brought his shield up to block the attack and he thrust out his blade.Boom!However, the guard had underestimated Lin Xun's strength. With a resounding boom, his shield shattered and a tremendous force blasted him into the opposite wall. His neck twisted and he slammed into the ground, unable to get up again.Pu!Without any hesitation, Lin Xun darted forward and slashed his opponent's throat. Blood jetted out furiously.But Lin Xun had already ducked down, and like a cheetah, tapped his toes on the ground, turned, and disappeared into the alley.Lin Xun's opponent was only a second-layer True Martial Stage expert and posed no threat to him. Their sudden fight ended with a clear result.<sub>Try the elworld.com platform_for the most advanced_reading experience.</sub>It was only until after Lin Xun vanished that someone discovered the guard's body on the ground and roared in fury.Before long, the same scene happened in another corner on the other side of the village. A guard walking cautiously was slashed across his head. He collapsed to the ground without the chance to scream.Lin Xun disappeared again like a ghost.A few days ago, Lin Xun had already checked out every corner of Feiyun Village and memorized any place that he could conceal himself in order to cope with such a situation.Lin Xun was well prepared while Lian Rufeng and the others were caught off guard.As time passed by, the expressions on the faces of Lian Rufeng and others worsened. Indescribable anger, fear and panic filled their hearts.First, arrows were fired at them at the entrance of the village, and then, as they entered the village, they were pulled into a real 'street fight'. Regardless of how stupid they were, Lian Rufeng and the others knew that their enemy had everything prepared!A quarter of an hour later.\u201cBrother Lian, the villagers aren't here. We can't threaten our opponents with their lives. This is clearly a trap.\u201dOne of the guards whispered in panic.\u201cNonsense, of course I know that!\u201dSeeing that only six subordinates were remaining, Lian Rufeng couldn't help but feel irritable. He realized that their situation didn't look good. He immediately gathered the scattered subordinates.He had never thought he would lose five of his people in just a quarter of an hour. Only seven people were remaining in the village including him.\u201cLin Xun!\u201dLian Rufeng clenched his teeth in fury. He finally realized that he was only dealing with one opponent, a thirteen-year-old boy!However\u2026Lian Rufeng couldn't believe that the boy, who he thought little of, had become another person in just a few months. Lin Xun had turned deceitful and ruthless, and he had gained incredible fighting power.Obviously, Lin Xun was the reason why Lu Ting and Qian Qi were gone!\u201cXiao Tianren, where did you find such a ruthless little thing?\u201dLian Rufeng wanted to understand.Yong\uff01Suddenly, the familiar and strange whistling sound rang again from a far away place.

They simultaneously moved aside.Boom!The arrow was as powerful as a raging waterfall and blasted a hole into the ground. Mud splattered and covered Lian Rufeng and the others with dirt.\"Wang Zhun, Xiao Shi, go ask Elder Wu for backup!\u201d Lian Rufeng roared, his face ferocious. He almost went berserk from rage. At the same time, he was infuriated that Wu Henshui was watching with folded arms.Your life is precious, but my life is worthless?What is he waiting for? Why isn't he doing anything? Is he waiting for us all to die?Wang Zhun and Xiao Shi hurried off knowing the situation was dire.\u201cBig Brother Lian, what should we do?\u201d asked someone.Lian Rufeng drew a deep breath and said coldly, \u201cWait! We can't actively attack anymore. That kid is cunning. He doesn't fight head-on. Only a master like Elder Wu can deal with him.\u201d He had decided not to risk his life anymore. Everything would end if his life was gone.As for what Wu Henshui thought about his decision, he didn't care.The others secretly breathed a sigh of relief. In truth, they were horrified to see their comrades die one after another.The atmosphere remained still and heavy as they waited for Wu Henshui to provide backup.As time passed by, the atmosphere in the village grew bleak. A sudden gust of wind whipped up a pile of fallen leaves and wafted the scent of blood around.A bad feeling crept up in Lian Rufeng's heart. There were only a few miles between where they were and the village entrance. Normally, it would only take less than a quarter of an hour to cross that distance.However, he still hadn't heard anything!Could something bad have happened?As that thought flashed across Lian Rufeng's mind, his chest tightened and indescribable panic filled his heart.\u201cLet's go. Let's go take a look!\u201d Lian Rufeng gritted his teeth and left with the remaining guards. He couldn't sit and wait anymore.This village that he was incredibly familiar with seemed so strange and eerie, like the land of the dead. It was bone-chilling.Soon, Lian Rufeng and the others halted before an alley. In the shadows of the alley lay two dead bodies. One's chest was torn open and blood wildly gushed out. The other's throat was crushed, neck twisted, and the head was limp.It was Wang Zhun and Xiao Shi, the two he sent to ask for backup.Lian Rufeng and others felt their hearts shivering, as though they had fallen into an ice cave. Another two had died!\u201cRun!\u201dUnable to take the shock, one of the guards roared like crazy and bolted out of the village.\u201cCome back!\u201d<sub>New_chap_ters are pub_lished on elworld.com</sub>Lian Rufeng thundered, his face livid.But he was one step too late. With a boom, an arrow shot out from the leaves of a locust tree and killed the guard in a split second!Another comrade had died in front of him less than ten feet away.Lian Rufeng was so furious that his eyes almost cracked. He has gone too far!\u201cKill! Kill that little bastard!\u201dRoaring like a madman, Lian Rufeng charged towards the locust tree. He had caught a glimpse of Lin Xun's figure.\u201cGo!\u201dThe remaining three guards hesitated but in the end they gritted their teeth and followed him.\u201cToo careless.\u201dAt the village entrance, Wu Henshui and Han Junshan strolled forward side by side and spotted several corpses along the way. Given the two's combat experience, they could tell from the wounds on the corpses that their enemy wasn't as ordinary as they thought.\u201cThey really are too careless. The enemy is clearly well-prepared and used the village's layout to his advantage to launch several sneak attacks\u2026The enemy wouldn't need to face Lian Rufeng and the others head-on. That is undoubtedly the best tactic.\u201d\u201cI didn't expect to find such a fierce and cunning person in this poor village,\u201d remarked Han Junshan.\u201cBut no matter what, the enemy is alone. I'm curious to see what our enemy is like and to see who would have such a strategic, ruthless and meticulous mind. In my opinion, the enemy won't be stronger than the fifth-layer True Martial Stage. Otherwise, the enemy would have killed Lian Rufeng first and not dragged the battle out till now.\u201dWu Henshui wore a calm and indifferent expression as he strolled along the village. He appeared extremely relaxed but his tensed shoulders, lightning bright eyes and his controlled breathing indicated he was prepared for battle.\u201cElder Wu, we might suffer heavy losses this time,\u201d said Han Junshan, scrunching his brows.\u201cYou are overthinking. I won't let an enemy like that escape unscathed. If we let the enemy live, I won't be able to sleep well in the future,\u201d said Wu Henshui, indifferently.Han Junshan nodded. \u201cAbsolutely.\u201dWu Henshui suddenly lifted his head, his gaze razor-sharp like an eagle's. He pointed to the distance. \u201cThe enemy is there.\u201dClang!Han Junshan drew a giant black sword and murderous intent saturated the air.Wu Henshui sighed, \u201cI have rarely needed to take care of something myself after reaching the eighth-layer True Martial Stage and becoming the chief steward of the Wu's Apothecary in Qingyang Tribe. I hope the opponent won't disappoint me by being too weak.\u201dHan Junshan said with a smile. \u201cElder Wu, leave it to me. It is not worth dirtying your hands for such an opponent.\u201dWu Henshui glanced at him and said, \u201cOkay.\u201dFrom their conversation, it was clear that they were extremely confident and they attached no importance to Lin Xun.It was understandable that they were so prideful. One was at the eighth-layer True Martial Stage and the other was at the fourth-layer True Martial Stage. Moreover, they had practiced arts that villagers such as Lian Rufeng could never imagine.<sub>Foll_ow new_episo_des on the elworld.com platform.</sub>For that reason, they believed that they could easily deal with an enemy below the fifth-layer True Martial Stage. The enemy was on a road that led to death regardless of how much cunning and intelligence that person had.However, just as the two were about to act, they saw a young and dainty figure appear dozens of meters away.The figure wore a black animal-skin cloak and a hood covered their face. Only a part of the figure's fair and delicate chin was exposed. Her skin was glistening and smooth, which looked extremely striking in contrast with the black cloak.The figure was clearly a young girl, but when she stood in the middle of the alley, Wu Henshui and Han Junshan both shuddered with terror.When they saw the little girl's long, white spear emitting an eerie glow, the expressions of the two changed dramatically.An aeth tool!Why did it seem like the bone spear was emitting an aura that was too strong and powerful to be that of an ordinary tool?Could the little girl be a Spirit Dipper cultivator?Wu Henshui and Han Junshan couldn't believe it. How could a little girl possess such a cultivation base?Perhaps the aeth tool didn't belong to her?Wu Henshui's heart trembled and his eyes blazed.The little girl simply stood there. Her slim body basking in the blood-red rays of twilight added a hint of mystery to her.She didn't move.Wu Henshui and Han Junshan knew she came to stop them.\u201cGo and test the little girl's strength.\u201dWu Henshui signaled to Han Junshan with his eyes. It clearly was too abnormal that a strange little girl wielding an aeth tool would suddenly appear.Out of caution, Wu Henshui chose to wait and watch.\u201cLittle girl, quickly move aside!\u201dHan Junshan wasn't an idiot either. He knew the situation was strange and so he first tried to talk to the little girl.The little girl shook her head and didn't say anything.Han Junshan's heart sank. The little girl indeed came to stop them. A hint of nervousness inexplicably flashed across his eyes.He couldn't tell why he would be so wary of a child, but his years of experience in battle told him that it was absolutely right to be cautious of her.\u201cIf you don't move aside, don't blame me for killing you!\u201dHan Junshan revealed his killing intent through his razor-sharp eyes. Wielding a giant black sword, he stepped forward, his bearing as imposing as a mountain.He was a master of the fourth-layer True Martial Stage, the Orifice Unlocking Stage. When his qi passed through his acupuncture points and orifices and circulated his entire body, the imposing aura he exuded was terrifying.Shua!<sub>Visit elworld.com for a better_reading experience</sub>Before his voice faded, the little girl seemed to perceive his murderous intent. She suddenly lifted her head, revealing her beautiful, dark crescent-shaped eyes that were completely devoid of emotions.Huh?As she swept her gaze over Han Junshan, Han Junshan's body uncontrollably trembled as if a sharp sword was suddenly pressing against his throat and endless fear gushed from his heart.His vision blurred, and rays of beautiful starry light suddenly shimmered, like a dream, like an illusion, like a magnificent dream.Han Junshan felt his mind was wandering. So beautiful!Almost at the same time, a thunderous yell rang in his ear. \u201cBe careful!\u201dHan Junshan seemed perplexed. Be careful?PU!Before he could respond, he felt his throat throb and his entire body felt like it had been struck by a giant mountain. He was sent flying across the air.Han Junshan finally snapped to his senses, but it was too late. Everything darkened before him and the world was instantly plunged into endless blackness.The dream-like and magnificent starry light also vanished.Wu Henshui was chilled to the bone, and his clothes were soaked in a cold sweat.In that split second, he saw Han Junshan standing there like a fool as though possessed and then the little girl's bone spear pierced his throat!It happened so fast that Wu Henshui couldn't do anything to help.Too terrifying. The scene was too terrifying!A five to six-year-old girl had killed an expert at the fourth-layer True Martial Stage with a bone spear in the most unbelievable way!Wu Henshui couldn't believe it. It was precisely because he couldn't believe it that he was utterly aghast at the scene, like he had fallen into an icy hole.Wu Henshui had completely lost his self-confidence. Even if he possessed a cultivation base of the eighth-layer True Martial Stage, it brought no sense of security to him.He forgot about the Blood Essence Sand, the Aeth Fields he wanted to snatch, and the archer he wanted to take care of.He only wanted to leave!The village was too terrifying. Unimaginable dangers lay in every corner. How is this a little remote mountain village? It's clearly a place of death!Without any hesitation, Wu Henshui turned and fled.But he suddenly felt a sharp pain run down his back. He was sent flying across the air. Everything grew dark as he slipped into unconsciousness.He couldn't react and he couldn't evade. Everything had happened in the blink of an eye!Bathed in the setting sun, Xia Zhi, who was clad in a black cloak, came over to Wu Henshui and frowned. She found that she had failed to take her opponent's life with her attack and was a little disappointed in herself.<sub>Updated_at elworld.com</sub>Just as she was about to strike again, a burst of triumphant and cruel laughter rang in the distance.Is Lin Xun in danger?Xia Zhi knitted her beautiful eyebrows and swung her bone spear.

Each one of them wore cold and fierce expressions and their eyes were filled with hatred and killing intent.Behind him was Lian Rufeng holding his long blade in a tight grip and looking ready to battle.There was no possible escape route for Lin Xun.However, he showed no hint of nervousness. Instead, a smile was playing at the corners of his mouth and his eyes were devoid of warmth.Before the battle began, Lin Xun already knew the battle would be a tough one. Fortunately, only four people including Lian Rufeng were remaining and he saw no signs of the goateed old man.Lian Rufeng laughed aloud, but his smile was sinister. \u201cLittle trash, why are you not running away?\u201dLin Xun smirked, stood on his tiptoes, and suddenly spun around. He sped towards Lian Rufeng and thereby exposed his behind to attacks.The three guards behind him were taken aback at first but then they swung their swords in joy and charged after him.Clang!A hatchet-wielding guard was first.However, Lin Xun suddenly halted as though it had frozen and then shot up like a spring. He rapidly rotated in mid-air.Shua!Lin Xun's Skybreaker Blade whistled in the air as he drew a semi circle with a slashing stroke.From afar, Lin Xun appeared to have merged with the blade. They rapidly spun like a top in the mid-air. The blade seemed capable of whipping up thousands of waves!It was the rotating move of the Six Word Blade.Rotating like a vortex with a blade, it was the most bizarre and ruthless move.Pu!As it rotated, the blade severed the hatchet-wielding guard's arm. The guard was unable to stop himself from charging forward and ended up throwing himself into the blade vortex; his head was hurled out from the vortex the next second!Blood sputtered everywhere. The scene was chilling and tragic.The other two guards, who were only one step away, trembled as they watched their comrade's death. Aghast, they threw themselves to one side to avoid the blade vortex.However, Lin Xun was already flashing across the sky like a rainbow. He repeatedly made several slashing strokes in the air, dazzling everyone's eyes.\u201cBastard!\u201dRoaring in fury, Lian Rufeng rushed forward, his face ferocious and his aura fierce. His blade resembled raging flames as he swung it with lightning speed.He had never thought Lin Xun would suddenly change targets and attack the three guards instead!Lian Rufeng didn't think highly of such a tactic but he was surprised that Lin Xun was still so fierce and brave in close combat. Lin Xun killed his subordinate in one slash and gave the subordinate no chance to fight back!<sub>The most up-to-date nov_els are published_here > elworld.com</sub>Seeing that Lin Xun was about to slay his other two subordinates, Lian Rufeng couldn't contain his anger anymore. He directly charged towards him.Wu!His long, narrow and dark blade produced a ghost-like wail in the air as it aimed for Lin Xun's back like a venomous snake.His attack was cunning. Lin Xun had to give up on his attack on the other two guards to protect his own life.However, Lin Xun didn't evade his attack as if he didn't notice it and continued to pursue one of the guards.He is seeking death!Lian Rufeng went wild with joy. How would he miss the chance to hack Lin Xun's back?Bang!However, despite striking Lin Xun, the expected bloody scene didn't happen. Instead, it created an ear-piercing clang like he struck a steel plate.No. That little bastard is wearing armor!Lian Rufeng's heart sank and his face blanched.Lin Xun borrowed the impact from Lian Rufeng's attack to launch himself forward like a cannonball. At the same time, a waterfall seemed to gush from the tip of his blade and it beheaded the guard facing him.Hua!Blood sputtered as the headless body smashed into the ground.Lin Xun's face also paled and blood pooled at the back of his throat. He almost coughed up blood but his eyes glinted fiercely and he suppressed himself. He charged towards the last guard.The last remaining guard was so horrified by the unexpected turn of events that his liver and gall both seemed to be splitting from within. Seeing Lin Xun rushing towards him, he roared and bolted at full speed.His unexpected action surprised Lin Xun but also shocked Lian Rufeng. He didn't think that his last remaining subordinate would be so spineless to flee.\u201cYou're the only one left.\u201dLin Xun gasped for breaths and looked at Lian Rufeng.Lin Xun had exhausted himself in the battle. If he hadn't occasionally supplemented his energy with the Aeth Refining Liquid, he would have collapsed long ago.After all, he was only a third-layer True Martial cultivator. Regardless of how pure and strong his aeth power was, it was still limited.Moreover, Lin Xun had suffered an internal injury when he took Lian Rufeng's attack. Under such circumstances, Lin Xun could still keep going, and that made Lian Rufeng palpitate.He knew he couldn't endure it.However, Lin Xun was still standing. Except for the blood trickling down his blade, he seemed to suffer no other injuries.How could it be possible for a young man at the third-layer True Martial Stage to achieve that?Lian Rufeng couldn't figure out the reason, but he could tell that Lin Xun had already consumed a lot of his strength. It was no exaggeration to say that Lin Xun was an arrow at the end of his flight and that calmed him a little.\u201cI can kill you alone!\u201dWith that thought, Lian Rufeng strode forward, his aura terrifying and imposing. He swung his long blade.<sub>Updated_at elworld.com</sub>Compared to Lin Xun, he hadn't consumed much strength. He dominated in terms of imposing aura.Most importantly, his cultivation level was one higher than Lin Xun's!Shua!The blade flashed blindingly bright as aeth power gathered.Lian Rufeng hated Lin Xun to the bone and he didn't want to give him a chance to breathe again.Bang\u2014The two had exchanged dozens of attacks in just one breath.Lin Xun's face worsened, but his blade moves were unaffected. His every stroke and slash was skillful and effortless.He was about to exhaust all his aeth power, but he still had physical strength remaining. Given his elemental understanding of the Six Word Blade Art, he could dispel all attacks with the coiling move of the Six Word Blade.The coiling move was an indirect way of fighting.The coiling move of the Six Word Blade suppressed the enemy using the enemy's momentum against them and used minimum strength to skillfully deflect the enemy's attack.In Lin Xun's hand, the coiling move was like silkworms producing silk threads, like uninterrupted spring rain, and like the soughing waves. The key point was that he was using the enemy's strength against them.Lian Rufeng's face darkened. He felt Lin Xun was like a slippery loach and his every attack at Lin Xun only struck mud. He couldn't accept it.What kind of blade art is that?Lian Rufeng had traveled between Feiyun Village and the Qingyang Tribe ever since he started his cultivation. He had even been to Donglin City where he had met many powerful masters and saw their techniques.However, he had never seen one as mysterious as Lin Xun's blade art.However, Lian Rufeng soon noticed that Lin Xun was growing paler and his whole body soaking in cold sweat. He clearly couldn't endure much longer.\u201cMaybe I can take the cultivation arts he has learned after killing him.\u201dLian Rufeng's heart fluttered with excitement and was even more determined to kill Lin Xun.That kid has a mysterious background. He possesses such terrifying power despite only being a teenager. Won't there be trouble in the future if I let him live?Chi!Suddenly, a bone spear thrust through space. Its body shone like stars in a clear sky.Huh?Lian Rufeng's pupils shrank. That's\u2014?Pu!Before he could react, a rush of sharp painful sensations shot through his chest. His vision went dark and he completely lost consciousness.Lin Xun was taken aback at first, and then he exhaled a long turbid breath. An indescribable exhaustion flooded his body like a tide.He bit the tip of his tongue to regain his spirit and reminded himself to not rest at such a time.<sub>Visit elworld.com for a better_reading experience</sub>\u201cEveryone is dead.\u201dA sweet voice sounded in his ear, like a spring breeze.\u201cEveryone is dead?\u201dWu Henshui's face flashed in Lin Xun's mind and he went into a trance.\u201cHuh?\u201dXia Zhi raised her fair and beautiful face to look at Lin Xun. His deathly pale face made her scrunch up her face and said seriously, \u201cYou should rest.\u201dRegardless of whether he agreed or not, she grabbed Lin Xun by his lapel and lifted him up.\u201cThe little girl is carrying me again\u2026\u201dLin Xun smiled bitterly, feeling ashamed. But a flurry of fatigue swept over him and his exhaustion took over and he drifted off to sleep.All sixteen people including Wu Henshui and Lian Rufeng were wiped out!The corpses strewn about in different corners of Feiyun Village looked even more horrifying under the blood-red glow of the sunset.Lin Xun had a dream.In his dream, he heard a familiar cold voice.\u201cDao Seeker, the Omega Secret Realm will open in three months. The second test of the Great Azure Cloud Path is called Body Tempering. There are one hundred and eight chances to pass. If you fail in the end, the Omega Secret Realm will return to a sealed state until one thousand years later when there's an opportunity to open again\u2026\"\u201cThree months? There isn't much time left!\u201dSuddenly, Lin Xun snapped awake from his dream.Seeing the familiar house layout and furniture, he pondered for a good while and finally shook his head to not think about the upcoming test. There was still some time before the Omega Secret Realm opened again. It was useless to worry about it.He got up and realized he had recovered from his fatigue and he only felt a little weak.Xia Zhi pushed open the door and didn't seem surprised to see Lin Xun getting up. She simply said, \u201cI'm hungry.\u201dLin Xun was a little taken aback. He thought Xia Zhi would warmly check on him but instead, she urged him to cook as soon as he woke up.He shrugged helplessly. \u201cI'll go cook now.\u201dHe suddenly asked, \u201cHow many days have I been asleep?\u201d\u201cFour days.\u201dLin Xun's eyes went wide. \u201cYou haven't eaten anything these four days?\u201dXia Zhi nodded.Lin Xun immediately rushed into the kitchen. His heart ached a little knowing that he had starved his 'savior\u201d for four days.While Lin Xun was busy in the kitchen, Xiao Tianren anxiously rushed into his house.

The leaves of the willow tree in the courtyard's center had turned golden yellow.The autumn weather was refreshing and the air was crisp. Lin Xun and Xia Zhi were seated opposite each other at a stone table in the courtyard. Spread out atop the stone table were five huge pots of beast meat, filling the air with its aroma.The beast meat didn't look particularly appetizing but Lin Xun had stewed them with various rune materials as well as different combinations of beast meat to create a delicious flavor.On the other side of the stone table, rested an iron pot of aeth grains.Lin Xun and Xia Zhi lowered their heads and gorged themselves on the food. They hadn't eaten in four days.Xiao Tianren sat on the other side, watching them with a smile as he briefly summarized the matters that had occurred in the past four days.It turned out that after the battle had ended, Xiao Tianren returned to the village with the villagers. Naturally, the village strewn with dead bodies horrified them but they felt more of relief and happiness.The death of Lian Rufeng and others meant trouble to the village had been eliminated. However, consequently, many problems needed to be dealt with urgently.For example, Xiao Tianren found that in addition to Lian Rufeng and other guards, there were another five or six unfamiliar-looking people, including Wu Henshui, who had died. Their appearance and clothing indicated they weren't ordinary people.It was hard to guarantee that the death of all those people in Feiyun Village wouldn't lead to more trouble.Another problem was that Feiyun Village had no guards after the death of Lian Rufeng and the other village guards, which meant no one would help the villagers deliver and exchange goods with the Qingyang Tribe.That matter also needed to be resolved.Lin Xun felt much more comfortable after devouring four bowls of aeth grains and one pot of beast meat.After making himself a cup of herbal aeth tea, Lin Xun organized his thoughts and responded to Xiao Tianren. \u201cUncle Xiao, do you know the people who came with Lian Rufeng?\u201dXiao Tianren suddenly sprang up and said, \u201cCome take a look and you will know.\u201dLin Xun glanced at Xia Zhi, who was only concentrating on eating, and nodded. The two left together.On the empty martial arts ground in the village's center.<sub>The most up-to-date nov_els are published_here > elworld.com</sub>Many miscellaneous items were stacked together, including weapons and accessories such as armor, boots, belts and jade pendants.In addition to this, there were also six bodies!When Lin Xun and Xiao Tianren arrived, Zhou Zhong and other hunters of the village were guarding the items and corpses.\u201cThese were found on Lian Rufeng's corpse. Also, since those six aren't from our village, I didn't let anyone touch them. We were waiting for you to come and investigate to see if there is anything important,\u201d explained Xiao Tianren.Lin Xun inwardly complimented Xiao Tianren for his attentiveness. Without any hesitation, he squatted down by Wu Henshui's corpse and began his investigation.When Lin Xun met the goateed old man four days ago, he had sensed a dangerous aura around him.However, the old man had died a violent death. The chilling hole that split his chest suggested a sharp weapon killed him.Lin Xun thought of Xia Zhi. He couldn't help but feel astonished. The little girl was stronger than he had imagined.Xiao Tianren, Zhou Zhong and the others gathered around, their gazes curious but also filled with reverence.Four days ago, when they saw the bodies of Lian Rufeng and others, they were paralzyed with shock for a good while. They realized just how terrifying the thirteen year old Lin Xun really was.He had killed dozens of cultivators including Lian Rufeng and other fourth-layer True Martial Stage experts, something unimaginable to the villagers.Therefore, their image of Lin Xun had unconsciously changed. Beneath his delicate and gentle appearance were awe-inspiring and terrifying powers.Unaware of the villagers' thoughts, Lin Xun continued to search Wu Henshui's body, but there was nothing else except a black ring.\u201cCould it be\u2026\u201dLin Xun examined the ring closer. It was entirely black and was made from something that was neither metal nor jade but it weighed heavily and emitted a cold air.With one thought, Lin Xun released a wisp of aeth power from his fingertip and into the ring.A little space appeared in his mind. It looked like a little shed and had many objects stacked everywhere such as piles of copper coins, tokens, aeth herbs, and some bottles and jars. Apart from these items, there was nothing else.It was indeed an aeth storage tool!Lin Xun was ecstatic. From what he knew, aeth storage tools were very precious because they were constructed from a rare kind of material called spatial aeth crystals. There was a saying that the tiny mustard seed can accommodate the huge Buddha's mountain. The storage aeth tool had the same wonderful feature.<sub>This_content is taken from elworld.com</sub>It was impossible to own such a treasure unless one was from a wealthy family!Lin Xun muttered, \u201cIt seems that guy isn't an ordinary person\u2026\u201dWith one thought, he took out a badge from the storage ring. The palm-sized badge was constructed from a warm jade-like material called wood stone, and the pattern on the front seemed to be some sort of symbol.A line of characters was engraved in the empire's seal script on the back of the badge\u2014Chief Steward of Wu's Apothecary in the Qingyang tribe!Lin Xun instantly knew that the man was from the Qingyang tribe and was a chief steward of a branch of the Wu's Apothecary!Soon, Lin Xun made another discovery. Housed in the storage ring was a badly damaged book that had information regarding Blood Essence Sand.Additionally, there was an animal skin bag containing various seeds of aeth herbs and weighed over five kilograms. The seeds could cover acres of Aeth Fields!\u201cSo they came for that reason,\u201d said Lin Xun pensively.Xiao Tianren couldn't help asking, \u201cWhat did you find?\u201dLin Xun casually answered, \"If my guess is correct, Lian Rufeng and his people colluded with the chief steward of Wu's Apothecary and plotted together to occupy the Aeth Fields in Feiyun Village so they could plant aeth herbs.\u201dThey wanted to occupy the Aeth Fields!Xiao Tianren, Zhou Zhong and the others reddened with fury. The entire village depended on the Aeth Fields to live. Who would have thought that Lian Rufeng would be so greedy and cruel to collude with an outsider to take their Aeth Fields? Clearly, they didn't care whether the villagers would survive or not!At the same time, they rejoiced that Lin Xun decided to eliminate Lian Rufeng and the others, and stopped their plan from succeeding. Otherwise, the consequences would be hard to imagine.Lin Xun didn't tell Xiao Tianren about the Blood Essence Sand. He took out his Skybreaker Blade, applied strength to his palm and sliced open Wu Henshui's stomach. Blood wildly gushed out.What is he going to do?Xiao Tianren and the others were all startled. They almost vomited when they saw the bright blood and organs spilling out the corpseLin Xun didn't seem uncomfortable. He knitted his brow in concentration and focused as he ran his palm along the meridians and organs of the corpse. His hands were quickly covered in blood.The scene was so horrifying that Xiao Tianren and the others couldn't bear to watch. They all turned their heads away and didn't dare to take another look.Fortunately, Lin Xun soon got up and cleaned his hands in the pond on the other side of the martial arts field. Then, he said, \u201cThis guy is indeed very powerful. He possessed a cultivation base of the Big Cycle, the eighth-layer True Martial Stage!\u201d<sub>Updated_at elworld.com</sub>He appeared relaxed outwardly, but he couldn't maintain calm inside. The reason why he opened up the old man's stomach was to confirm his cultivation level.After all, the old man hadn't quite reached the Spirit Dipper Stage, as demonstrated by the absence of dipper qi around his body. Therefore, it was impossible to determine his cultivation level from the outside.After the inspection and verification, Lin Xun was clear that the old man not only had an impressive background but also an extraordinary cultivation base. Lin Xun felt he would have died in his hands if not for Xia Zhi.Then, what about Xia Zhi?She killed a cultivator of the eighth-layer True Martial Stage with one move. Didn't that mean her cultivation base was more impressive?Xiao Tianren assumed a solemn and worried expression. \u201cWould the death of such an important man bring trouble to our village?\u201dLin Xun shook his head. \u201cI can't be sure yet. Later, I will personally pay the Qingyang Tribe a visit and inquire there. Maybe I can make a judgment then.\u201d\u201cYou are going to the Qingyang tribe?\u201d exclaimed Xiao Tianren.Lin Xun shrugged and smiled. \u201cOf course, without Lian Rufeng and the other guards, I have to help everyone exchange for living supplies in the Qingyang Tribe.\u201dXiao Tianren couldn't help feeling emotional. \u201cLin Xun, I\u2026\u201dLin Xun interrupted him with a wave of his hand. \u201cUncle Xiao, you don't have to say thank you. I am also a part of Feiyun Village. It's something I should do.\u201dXiao Tianren inhaled deeply, trying to control his emotions. \u201cGood! Lin Xun, you must tell us if there's anything you need in the future. Although our Feiyun Village is poor, we will do our best to help you even at the risk of our lives!\u201dZhou Zhong and the others nodded vigorously.Lin Xun smiled and turned around to investigate the other spoils elsewhere on the martial arts grounds.The other items were nothing good. The majority of the items on Lian Rufeng and others were of low value. The only thing that caught Lin Xun's attention was a pair of boots engraved with the swift wind rune.He removed the boots from Lian Rufeng. It was considered a piece of aeth tool equipment, but the swift wind rune was rough and ordinary, and thus was not of great value.Lin Xun took the storage ring and boots and left the other items for Village Chief Xiao Tianren to deal with.Zhou Zhong and the others transported the corpses of Wu Henshui and others out of the village and incinerated them to destroy all traces.Before leaving, Lin Xun suddenly remembered something. He said to Xiao Tianren, \u201cBy the way, Uncle Xiao, since the trouble has been eliminated, how about we mine for the Feiyun Fire Copper in a few days?\u201d<sub>Foll_ow new_episo_des on the elworld.com platform.</sub>The mention of Feiyun Fire Copper made Xiao Tianren's heart blaze with excitement. He nodded. \u201cIt's up to you. It is indeed best to have the wealth in your hands earlier, so you won't have to worry about it anymore.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The giant rugged hammer looked very unharmonious in her fair and slender hands.However, the way she repeatedly struck the armor in a unique and relaxed rhythm made it obvious that the giant hammer was as light as an embroidery needle in her hands.Lin Xun recognized the armor. He had personally constructed it a few days ago using the one-horned lizard's scales. It was the armor that weakened the attack from Lian Rufeng when they fought a few days ago, but it had been damaged as a result.Lin Xun was surprised to see Xia Zhi taking the initiative to repair his armor.Lin Xun went over to take a closer look at the giant hammer and his eyes widened in shock. The head of the hammer looked like a lump of iron and was covered with several fingerprints.\u201cYou made this?\u201d asked Lin Xun.Without stopping, Xia Zhi nodded and said casually, \u201cI don't have a hammer so I made one by myself.\u201dLin Xun let out a gasp of amazement. That's iron! She molded a giant hammer with just her hands?!He stared at Xia Zhi in a daze while muttering inwardly, Could there be an ancient beast concealed in her delicate and beautiful body?Xia Zhi suddenly dropped the giant hammer and handed the armor to Lin Xun. \u201cI've repaired it. Try it on.\u201dSurveying the newly constructed armor, Lin Xun couldn't help smiling. He complimented, \u201c I didn't expect you to have such good skills.\u201dXia Zhi ignored him and strode into the house. \u201cI'm going to sleep. Lin Xun, remember to prepare something for me to eat. I will be hungry when I wake up.\u201dBang!She closed the door.Lin Xun shrugged his shoulders. He had grown used to Xia Zhi's independent personality, which was completely different from other children.His gaze drifted down to the giant hammer. He tried to pick it up but it was so heavy that it wouldn't budge an inch!Lin Xun was astonished. He gripped the hammer tight and gathered all his strength as well as aeth power to barely just lift the hammer. It had to weigh at least two hundred and fifty kilos!Boom!<sub>This_content is taken from elworld.com</sub>Lin Xun relaxed his grip and the giant hammer dropped and smashed a hole in the ground.\u201cShe really is a little monster!\u201dAs Lin Xun thought of how Xia Zhi molded the giant hammer with her hands, his face lit up and he grew curious of Xia Zhi's background.\u201cI'll ask her when she wakes up.\u201dLin Xun stopped thinking about the hammer and went into the kitchen to prepare food. Then, he seated himself in the courtyard. He flipped his hand and a copper coin emerged in his palm. He moved it closer and examined it.It was his first time seeing a real copper coin. The coin, which was around the size of a baby's palm, was entirely dark yellow and gave off a warmth in his hands.From what Lin Xun knew, the Ziyao Empire's money was made from a special mixture of ground Cloud Aeth Stone, a special ore, and dozens of other materials such as gold, silver and copper. It was then subjected to a number of complex and strictly-monitored refinement processes. It was impossible for the outside world to grasp the empire's unique money-making method.The currency of the Ziyao Empire was divided into gold coins, silver coins, and copper coins, and the exchange ratio was one to one hundred.All coins were engraved with a symbol unique to the Ziyao Empire on both sides.For example, the front of the copper coin in Lin Xun's hand was composed of three parts.The cluster of violet glory flowers burning like flames represented the imperial family of the Ziyao Empire.The majestic azure deer looking up into the sky represented the best academy in the empire, the Qinglu Academy.The sacred sword overflowing with vigor as it pierced the sky represented the military of the Ziyao Empire.In addition, on the fringe of the three parts were beautiful cloud-pattern branches and leaves, which represented the upper-class nobles, aristocratic families and clans who had made outstanding contributions to the Ziyao Empire.The other side of the copper coin was engraved with a landscape consisting of misty mountains and mighty waves, which held an unfathomable meaning.Lin Xun didn't know what the landscape on the back of the coin represented but he knew it was undoubtedly meaningful.Yong!Lin Xun blew at the copper coin, producing a unique but pleasant noise. This is a Ziyao coin. I will need the support of Ziyao coins if I want to continue to live or cultivate in the Ziyao Empire.From Wu Henshui's storage ring, Lin Xun had unexpectedly received a total of 1,500 copper coins, which was equivalent to fifteen silver coins.The empire's money was worth a lot. For example, three copper coins could buy two hundred and fifty grams of aeth grains. The thumb-sized Feiyun Fire Copper that Lin Xun had shown Xiao Tianren could be exchanged in the Qingyang tribe for thirty copper coins, which was equivalent to the value of 2.5 kilos of aeth grains!However, Lin Xun had little knowledge about the exchange value of various items in the Ziyao Empire, and of course he didn't know what 1,500 copper coins could buy.<sub>Try the elworld.com platform_for the most advanced_reading experience.</sub>In addition to copper coins, Lin Xun also acquired a bag of aeth herb seeds from the storage ring. The majority of the seeds weren't particularly valuable but were essential for cultivation.Lin Xun had no intention of planting them because the process of growing aeth herbs was very complicated and required a special aeth plant master. These herbs had a long growth and maturation time and could only be harvested in three to five years. Some rare aeth herb seeds took hundreds or thousands of years to mature.If Lin Xun's guess was correct, an aeth plant master was among the subordinates who Wu Henshui brought with him.The bag of seeds had no importance to Lin Xun and so he intended to sell it for money.What made him happy was the aeth herbs in the storage ring. All of them were rare varieties. Some could be used to strengthen one's body and some for improving one's cultivation base. Additionally, Lin Xun found bottles of medicinal pills.They were all valuable treasures. Wu Henshui was an eighth-layer True Martial Stage cultivator and so the items in his collection wouldn't be ordinary.Lin Xun organized the items in the storage ring, and seeing that there was still a lot of space inside, he also stored the Skybreaker Blade.\u201cNow that I have this storage ring, it will be easier when I deliver goods to the Qingyang Tribe. At the very least, I won't be robbed.\u201dLin Xun carefully hid the ring. He knew that many people would recognize the ring given the fact that Wu Henshui was the chief steward of the Wu's Apothecary in the Qingyang Tribe. He didn't wear it on his hand since it would draw too much attention.\u201cThese swift wind boots are of poor quality but they're still considered a type of aeth tool equipment. Too bad it's too big for me. I should sell it instead.\u201dAfter some deliberation, Lin Xun removed the boots on Lian Rufeng and decided to sell them. He tossed them into the storage ring.After sorting out all the items, Lin Xun stretched for a long while and felt much more relaxed.His next priority was to train. As for the matter about the Feiyun Fire Copper mine, he decided to leave it to Village Chief Xiao Tianren.Lin Xun counted the days and realized that more than two months had passed since the last test of the Great Azure Cloud Path. In less than half a month it would be the time to take the second test in the Omega Secret RealmLin Xun didn't dare to neglect that matter.After all, he had received a Little Divine Meditation Art as reward for passing the first level. He wondered what sort of benefit he would receive when he passed the second.He was filled with anticipation.When evening came, Xia Zhi woke up and sat down at the stone table in the courtyard. Soon, Lin Xun brought over the food that he had prepared earlier in the day.A few days ago, the village had a good harvest of aeth grains and many villagers gifted Lin Xun with bags of aeth grains as well as the meat of over thirty beasts. He didn't need to worry about food for some time.The only thing that troubled Lin Xun was Xia Zhi's increased appetite. She had to eat an extra bowl of grain and meat almost every day.<sub>Foll_ow current_novel on elworld.com</sub>Her little stomach was almost like a bottomless abyss.At the rate of her appetite growth, Lin Xun couldn't guarantee how long the food at home would last.Fortunately, he didn't have to worry about it for now.While eating, Lin Xun casually asked, \u201cXia Zhi, where are your parents?\u201dChewing a chunk of aromatic meat, Xia Zhi just shook her head.Lin Xun continued to ask, \u201cWhat about your home? Do you remember?\u201dXia Zhi thought for a while and shook her head again. \u201cFor as long as I can remember, I've lived with Uncle Bear in the mountains.\u201dShe spoke with a calm and serious tone, but Lin Xun assumed a complicated expression. This little girl has been living in the mountains since she was a child.\u201cWho is Uncle Bear?\u201d\u201cYou met him the other day.\u201dLin Xun's mind quivered. The barbarian bear that he saw in the ancient forest the other day flashed in his mind. He couldn't help exclaiming in shock, \u201cYou mean the savage beast that the brute warrior killed?\u201dXia Zhi frowned, raised her head to look at Lin Xun and said seriously, \u201cYou can't say that about him.\u201dLin Xun quickly apologized. \u201cI didn't mean to be disrespectful.\u201dIn truth, perplexed feelings crept into his heart. Xia Zhi was actually brought up by a bear. No wonder she said something so complicated and obscure when I first met her in the mountains... Wait!No!Xia Zhi wasn't speaking animal language but a completely different language.\u201cI don't know who the brute warrior is, but one day I will kill him to avenge Uncle Bear,\u201d vowed Xia Zhi, her bright jewel-like eyes unwavering.After saying that, she quickly buried her head in the food again.Interrupted, Lin Xun forgot to ask Xia Zhi how she learned the language she used to speak. Instead, his mind drifted back to the battle between the Spirit Sea cultivators.The battle was between an azure-robed, sword-wielding expert who was clearly from the Ziyao Empire and an expert called a brute warrior who likely wasn't from the Ziyao Empire.Lin Xun still remembered that the brute warrior wanted to kill Xia Zhi and not him!<sub>This_content is taken from elworld.com</sub>The brute warrior's action, coupled with the fact that Xia Zhi spoke an unfamiliar language made Lin Xun conjecture that Xia Zhi was from somewhere outside of the Ziyao Empire.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She rested her head on Lin Xun's pillow, covered herself with Lin Xun's blanket, and, of course, she slept on Lin Xun's bed.Xia Zhi was direct and straightforward, and, when she did speak, she always spoke in a forthright manner. She was very quiet and seldom spoke, which made her seem very unusual.She only looked like a little girl when asleep. Her eyelashes curved like a fan; her breathing was light and her beautiful-near-perfect face was sweet and innocent.As Lin Xun gazed at Xia Zhi, who was deep asleep, a smile formed at the corners of his mouth. He felt the little girl had shown only him kindness, goodwill and even dependence.Lin Xun no longer cared that he couldn't find out about Xia Zhi's past because he realized that Xia Zhi had made his life no longer lonely. She added a sense of steadiness and stability to his life, which he had never felt before.Perhaps this was a feeling of dependency?Lin Xun wasn't sure what it was but he felt that Xia Zhi had integrated into his life.Sitting cross-legged on the bed, Lin Xun held his breath in deep concentration and began to cultivate.The Organ Opening Stage, the third layer of the True Martial Stage, put importance on drawing aeth power to circulate into the five internal organs and consolidating a cultaivator's foundation, for the next stage was the Orifice Unlocking Stage.The so-called Orifice Unlocking Stage was to unlock the acupoints and orifices in the entire body. The unlocking of orifices would strengthen the practitioner's spirit and resulted in abundant vital energy, qi and blood.After reaching that stage, a person's cultivation base would undergo transformation once again. Not only would their strength double, their entire body would be further tempered and the impurities inside would be removed.After Lin Xun experienced the fierce battle four days ago, he had distinctly felt his cultivation base further consolidating and being refined. With diligent practice, it wouldn't be long until he could make another breakthrough!This was the benefit of real-life battle. Being tempered through the flames of combat would not only significantly improve a person's combat techniques, skills and experience, but also their cultivation base.The time it took to burn an incense stick passed by.Lin Xun circulated his aeth power thirty-six times around his body before and began to visualize the Star Cycle phenomenon.The Little Divine Meditation Art was undoubtedly mysterious and profound. Despite it only having three great stages, the Star Cycle, the Moon Phases and the Sun Illumination, each one was broad and all-encompassing. The more a cultivator comprehended, the more they would notice how unfathomable it was.In Lin Xun's mind-sea, a starry sky spectacle began to emerge. The starry sky was vast, mysterious, and stippled with millions of stars. However, every star was dim and unreachable.Lin Xun felt embarrassed to say that he hadn't been able to break through the Star Cycle despite daily practice of the Little Divine Meditation Art.Regardless, Lin Xun's spirit had been refined and strengthened after each training session. The benefits it had brought were evident.Hu\u2014Lin Xun exhaled long and slow. In his mind-sea, he was fully concentrated on illuminating the billions of stars in the starry sky.<sub>This_content is taken from elworld.com</sub>Only when he could perceive and cross the star paths to trigger a star to shed its light would he be truly considered to have touched upon the Star Cycle.That step was called Illuminating the Stars.Undistracted by any other things and devoid of any desires, Lin Xun silently meditated. Suddenly, he felt he had drifted up thousands of miles into the sky. Despite flying thousands of miles, he didn't feel tired. A natural force was pulling him upwards.He passed the sky, went beyond the nine heavens, and flew into the vast boundless starry sky.Countless stars came into his sight, but he came to realize that the stars were not fixed in position and were constantly changing. They were orbiting along different paths.It was as though an invisible hand was controlling their movements. The cycle and path of each star was indescribably mysterious and they resembled heavenly steeds soaring across the sky,As far as the eye could see was the chessboard-like starry sky. The stars were chess pieces dotted on the chessboard while the star paths were where the chess pieces would move.Lin Xun quietly watched and observed. As time passed, a perplexed feeling crept to his heart.If the starry sky is the chessboard and the stars are the chess pieces, who is the one playing the game of chess?It's me!Lin Xun felt a flash of realization. His perception spread like a ray of light rushing into the starry sky, and lit up one of the stars!It was as though an invisible hand had placed a piece on the chessboard!The stars, which were the chess pieces, would light up, and the chess pieces would be brought to life. When it did, the real journey would begin.Hua\u2014At the same time, the originally dim starry sky in Lin Xun's mind-sea changed. A blurry star suddenly turned incredibly bright and shed rays of light. The rays passed vast nothingness and into his mind-sea.Lin Xun snapped to his senses. He felt an indescribable refreshing feeling both inside and outside his spirit field. It was so comfortable that he felt like he was soaking in a hot spring and almost even groaned out loud.The Star Cycle Realm!He had finally touched upon the Star Cycle Realm!Lin Xun was brimming with excitement. After two months, he had finally inadvertently lit up the first star in his mind-sea.At that moment, his perception felt like a delicate cobweb spreading out and enveloping the courtyard.Everything in the courtyard was vividly presented in his mind. The grass swayed by the night wind, the crickets perched on the window, a drop of dew forming on the side of the well, the weeping willow illuminated by the moonlight\u2026Everything was so clear, vivid and ethereal.This was perception!<sub>Visit elworld.com for a better_user experience</sub>A power from his spirit.It was also known as the spirit from the orifice reflecting all things in the mind.Generally, only when a cultivator had broken through the True Martial Stage and had reached the Spirit Dipper Stage would they possess such power of perception.But now, Lin Xun, who was only at the third-layer True Martial Stage, had managed to achieve that step!Naturally, this had to be credited to the Little Divine Meditation Art!He had already possessed such powers when he had just touched upon the Star Cycle Realm. Thus this Spirit Refining Art was incredibly mysterious and profound.From what Lin Xun knew, reaching the perfect realm of the Star Cycle only happened when he could control his power of perception to light up all the stars in the starry sky of his mind-sea and illuminate everything.Lin Xun found that he could perceive everything within a radius of ten feet.Huh?Lin Xun was about to get up to engrave a rune with his rune brush to check the changes brought about by his strengthened spirit but when he opened his eyes, he found that Xia Zhi was resting her head on his lap and curled up sleeping. A trace of a longing flickered over her beautiful and peaceful face.A rare and almost imperceptible smile touched the corners of her lips.Lin Xun thought for a while and carefully moved Xia Zhi's head away. But she scrunched her brows and mumbled, \u201cNo\u201d while hugging Lin Xun's leg.Lin Xun smiled wryly. He had no choice but to test his new powers in the morning to avoid disturbing the little girl.Lin Xun lay down and gazed at Xia Zhi who was lying beside him. He pondered about how to face the upcoming second test of the Omega Secret Realm.After an unknown period of time, Lin Xun also drifted off into deep sleep.The next morning.Lin Xun got up early and repeatedly practiced the Marching Army Fist in the courtyard until he was drenched in sweat and his blood was bubbling. Then, he rinsed himself with the cold water from the well, changed into some clean clothes, and started to prepare breakfast in the kitchen.Lin Xun felt much more energetic, spirited and stronger, and all his senses felt renewed.Xia Zhi immediately woke up when she smelled the aroma wafting from the kitchen. It was as though sleeping and eating were the most important things in her world and mustn't be neglected.While eating, Lin Xun suddenly remembered something he wanted to ask the little girl. \u201cXia Zhi, have you ever learned any body tempering arts?\u201dXia Zhi blankly shook her head. \u201cNo.\u201dLin Xun pointed to the giant hammer tossed to one corner of the courtyard. \u201cThen how did you mold that hammer?\u201d<sub>Foll_ow new_episo_des on the elworld.com platform.</sub>\u201cI just used my hands.\u201d Xia Zhi casually replied.Lin Xun: \u201c\u2026\u201dXia Zhi frowned and studied Lin Xun for a while before saying, \u201cAre you going to strengthen your body?\u201dLin Xun nodded. He had given it a deep thought overnight. Given that the second test of the Omega Secret Realm was called Body Tempering, it had to be related to the tempering of the body.Additionally, since there were 108 chances to pass, it suggested it was very difficult and the rate of failure was extremely high.In that case, Lin Xun had to be prepared. It would be even better if he could strengthen and improve his body beforehand.However, Lin Xun knew no methods of doing so except for consuming the flesh and blood of rare beasts and the decoctions of various aeth ingredients.There were many methods in the world that specifically aimed to temper the body but Lin Xun knew none and it was impossible to find any in Feiyun Village.In truth, based on the cultivation stages, the nine layers of the True Martial Stage was a kind of refinement of a cultivator's body.The first layer, Qi Drawing, trained a cultivator's awareness of their body of qi.The second layer, Inner Strengthening, toughened a cultivator's muscles, bones and limbs.The third layer, Organ Opening, tempered the five organs in a cultivator's body.The fourth layer, Orifice Unlocking, strengthened the acupoints and orifices in a cultivator's body.The fifth layer, Essence Refining, purified the marrow and essence of a cultivator's muscles and bone.The sixth layer, Blood Igniting, improved the blood in a cultivator's body.The seventh layer, Little Cycle, and the eighth layer, Big Cycle, were the same in that they were a comprehensive refinement of a cultivator's flesh, blood, tendons, bones, acupoints, orifices and organs.The Little Cycle was a preliminary refinement and the Big Cycle was a further refinement.The ninth layer, Aeth Transformation, refined the aeth power inside and outside the cultivator's body to initiate a transformation.All nine layers of the True Martial Stage helped a cultivator to establish a solid foundation in order to successfully form Dipper Qi from Aeth power at the Spirit Dipper Stage!However, Lin Xun was only at the third-layer True Martial Stage and it was impossible to further improve his body in such a short time without resorting to other means.Xia Zhi pondered for a moment and said, \u201cHow about we fight?\u201dLin Xun repeated in puzzlement, \u201cFight?\u201dXia Zhi seriously nodded. \u201cYes, fighting with pure physical strength is one of the most direct ways of strengthening your body.\u201d<sub>For more_novel, visit elworld.com</sub>Lin Xun exclaimed in surprise, \u201cHow do you know this?\u201dXia Zhi's eyes looked dazed and confused. She shook her head after thinking for a long time. \u201cI can't remember it, but I know it can't be wrong.\u201dLin Xun clenched his teeth and decided to trust Xia Zhi. \u201cWe should give it a try.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She calmly and unhurriedly rolled up her sleeves and revealed her fair and spotless arms.Then, she lifted her little face, and her bright jewel-like eyes sparkled as she looked at Lin Xun. \u201cYou attack.\u201dLin Xun looked a little taken aback. In truth, he couldn't bring himself to attack an exceptionally beautiful little girl who was only five to six years old and who barely reached his chest.Even if he knew what sort of unbelievable strength Xia Zhi possessed, it felt wrong to bully a little girl.However, when Lin Xun saw the serious and solemn look on Xia Zhi's face, he clenched his teeth and gathered power to his hand. He slammed his fist forward like a roaring tiger.Hu\u2014The physical strength from his fist generated wind blasts that shook the air, and the force was so tremendous that it felt like a fierce tiger emerging from the mountains.This clearly demonstrated that Lin Xun's mastery of the Marching Army Fist had reached the Precise realm. He could precisely exhibit the essence and wonders of the fist art.However, Xia Zhi didn't move or dodge as the punch flew towards her. She simply lifted her slender and fair arm and clutched Lin Xun's wrist like a pair of iron tongs.Shocked, Lin Xun frantically struggled to break free but Xia Zhi simply flicked her wrist.With a loud thud, Lin Xun's entire body violently quivered like a flapping cloth and he dropped to the ground. It was so painful that he thought his bones were crushed. He grimaced as he inhaled sharply.The shock in Lin Xun's heart was far greater than the pain in his body. Xia Zhi's attack was so quick that he was already blasted to the ground before he had time to react!Lin Xun could distinctly feel that Xia Zhi didn't circulate any aeth power earlier, which meant she defeated him with a simple flick of her wrist.Lin Xun pulled himself up and looked at Xia Zhi with embarrassment. The hint of leniency in his eyes had faded and was replaced by utmost solemness.However, Xia Zhi furrowed her delicate eyebrows and said in puzzlement, \u201cYour control of physical strength is very bad. The fire mane boars in the mountains are better than you.\u201dLin Xun's face immediately darkened. A five to six year old little girl dared to compare him to a pig!What an insult!Boom!Lin Xun exhaled, expelling the rage. Then, he balled his hands into fists and charged over with the move \u201ca mountain crushing the moon\u201d.That move was both offensive and defensive. Lin Xun believed that he wouldn't lose to the little girl again.However, his vision suddenly blurred and his wrist was being held in a tight grip again. WIth a loud thud, he again slammed into the ground like a meteorite and whipped up a cloud of dust. His face was bruised and swollen.So embarrassing!<sub>You can_find the rest of this_content on the elworld.com platform.</sub>Regardless of how shrewd Lin Xun was, he was still only thirteen years old. How could a youngster full of potential endure such humiliation?\u201cAgain!\u201dLin Xun didn't care about anything anymore. WIth a thunderous roar, he charged forward again.He had learned his lesson. This time, he lifted his arms and his fists were akin to a stretched bow. It was the Iron Bridge Across the River move from the Marching Army Fist.Given Xia Zhi's height, she couldn't touch Lin Xun's wrist anymore.As he expected, Xia Zhi frowned. Then, she suddenly trotted forward and charged into Lin Xun's line of defense like a rising dragon. Like a drill, she kicked Lin Xun's knee.Lin Xun suddenly felt his right leg go numb and immediately lost sensation there. Then, he stumbled forward and almost planted his face in the ground.At the same time, Xia Zhi tightly gripped his wrist once again. She gently flicked it again.The familiar scene happened again. Lin Xun once again embraced the ground head-on. The ground shook and dust and dirt whirled into the air.Lin Xun got up. His face was dirtied, his hair disheveled, his nose bruised, his face swollen, and his clothes were covered with dirt and dust. He looked extremely miserable.His eyes were fixed intently on Xia Zhi and his heart was a vortex of complex emotions\u2014 shock, disbelief, confusion, anger, and humiliation.Xia Zhi seemed totally unaware of what Lin Xun was feeling. She frowned, perplexed. \u201cLin Xun, you really are worse than the fire mane boar. I wonder if you're more stupid than them too.\u201dBoom!Her words made Lin Xun's blood boil and rush to his forehead. An indescribable sense of shame and humiliation spread all over his body like fire.She said I'm worse than a pig!She said I'm more stupid than a pig!Lin Xun was seething with rage that smoke almost rose from his seven orifices. Then, his eyes widened, and with an enraged roar, he charged forward again.Bang!Xia Zhi curled her lips, unenthusiastically raised her hand and blasted Lin Xun to the ground once again.\u201cAgain!\u201dLin Xun looked like a cockroach that couldn't be killed. He pushed himself up and charged at Xia Zhi without any hesitation.The strong feeling of humiliation had ignited his fighting spirit. He had completely forgotten everything and put aside all the distractions and restraints in his heart.He was like a youngster refusing to admit defeat.It was also only then that Lin Xun resembled a real thirteen-year-old.

The noises not only made people panic but scared away the skylarks perched on the willow tree.Village Chief Xiao Tianren hurried to Lin Xun's house and saw Xia Zhi lift Lin Xun up like a sack and tossed to the ground.Dumbfounded, Xiao Tianren repeatedly rubbed his eyes, thinking it was an illusion.However, he quickly realized it wasn't an illusion. The youngster who saved Feiyun Village from the abyss of suffering and was respected by all villagers was miserably beaten beyond recognition by a five to six-year-old girl. Xiao Tianren uncontrollably fell into a trance. This is too crazy. When did the world become like this\u2026?I don't understand anything anymore!Xiao Tianren came to discuss with Lian Xun about the matters regarding the Feiyun Fire Copper mine but he unhesitatingly left after seeing that scene.He felt that he needed to first calm down. The scene was so shocking that anyone's eyes would glaze over in a hypnotic trance.It wasn't until the sun had set that the courtyard returned to its usual peaceful state.Lin Xun gritted his teeth and hobbled over to the wooden bathtub. He took off his tattered and dirty clothes and jumped into the prepared bath.Various aeth ingredients with significant body-repairing effects had been prepared into the wooden barrel.Hu\u2014Feeling the warmth from the medicinal bath caress the numerous scars all over his body, Lin Xun couldn't help exhaling a long breath of turbid air.But when he saw Xia Zhi, he unconsciously twitched and a look of shame and bitterness washed over his face.Lin Xun had lost count of how many times he was defeated that afternoon. Every time his bones almost broke apart like he was being crushed by Mount Tai.His body had long become numb and his strength was almost exhausted. Every inch of his skin, flesh, muscles and bones throbbed with unbearable pain.He could have endured if it was only pain that he suffered.However, he couldn't accept the fact that he lost so many times to the same trick!It made Lin Xun begin to wonder if he really was more stupid that the fire mane boar.Lin Xun firmly shook his head, unwilling to admit that he was worse than an animal.\u201cI'm going to sleep.\u201dXia Zhi got up and walked into the room. \u201cOh, yes, I'll be very hungry when I wake up. Don't forget to cook for me.\u201dLin Xun was stumped for words. He was so angry that he almost cursed out loud. I have become like this and you still want me to cook! Do you not have any sympathy?!<sub>Visit elworld.com for a better_reading experience</sub>Immediately afterwards, Lin Xun smiled bitterly and sighed like he was accepting his fate. Resting in the wooden barrel bathtub, he raised his head and watched night descend on the village. His eyes gradually restored their usual clearness as all emotions faded from them.He reflected on the battle in the afternoon. He thought over every little detail and gradually immersed himself in it.Xia Zhi adopted a very simple fighting method. She simply grabbed him and tossed him to the ground.Her grip was unbreakable like an iron hoop.Her flick was as swift and direct as an experienced hand sifting chaff from wheat.But upon a deeper thought, there was a lot to learn from it. For example, her grip was lightning fast, precise and flawless. Like a goshawk catching a rabbit, her every move directly struck its target!That ability required remarkable eyesight and speed. It wasn't considered particularly profound and could be achieved by anyone with painstaking practice.What truly amazed Lin Xun was the power of her flick. The flicking motion of her wrist produced a tidal-like force that shook and almost shattered every muscle and bone in the body.It was too terrifying!How did Xia Zhi achieve that with mere physical strength?Lin Xun fell into deep thought.Night fell and stars dotted the vast and boundless sky.Lin Xun had soaked up the medicinal effect of the bath and his numbness and exhaustion had been swept away. Without any hesitation, he put on some clean clothes and began to prepare dinner.His battle with Xia Zhi in the afternoon wasn't as simple as it seemed. He appeared to be miserably beaten, but he had only suffered superficial wounds and his internal tissues were undamaged.When Lin Xun thought of this, he knew Xia Zhi held back her strength. But he didn't know what fraction of her powers she had used.Xia Zhi appeared immediately when dinner was prepared and served on the table.Lin Xun smiled as he ladled rice into the little girl's bowl. \u201cI roughly understand now.\u201dXia Zhi looked surprised. While chewing on a chunk of meat that was as thick as an arm, she remarked, \u201cIt's so simple. If you don't understand, you really are stupid.\u201dLin Xun: \u201c\u2026\u201dLin Xun took a deep breath, trying to ignore Xia Zhi's inadvertent insult. He then changed his tone of voice to a serious and firm one. \u201cLet's continue tomorrow!\u201dHis words were resounding, but Xia Zhi felt a hint of resentment and bitterness in his voice. She couldn't help but raise her eyes to look at Lin Xun. She tilted her head and said ruminatively, \u201cDiligence can make up for one's lack of talent. A dumb sparrow needs to make an early start. I just learned these two sentences. I think they fit you very well.\u201dLin Xun's face suddenly darkened. Is this little girl addicted to abusing me now?What do you mean by lack of talent?What do you mean by dumb sparrow?Do I have such a bad image in her mind?<sub>Updated_at elworld.com</sub>\u201cLet's eat dinner!\u201dLin Xun gritted his teeth and glared at Xia Zhi. He sullenly ate dinner, venting all his emotions on his food. He ended the conversation that made him feel crushed.The night was calm as usual, but when they recalled the night in the future, they would understand the preciousness of it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He was overflowing with fighting spirit this morning.He had barely slept last night. After his aeth qi and spirit cultivation sessions, he had spent the rest of the time revisiting Xia Zhi's battle techniques.It had been a battle of pure physical prowess with the aim of tempering his body. However, after Lin Xun's tragic loss yesterday, he suddenly understood a certain principle. Strength paired with technique could also be an effective killing method!Xia Zhi was a prime example. Her combat capabilities were absolutely terrifying despite not using any aeth power.\u201cLet's begin.\u201dXia Zhi's expression was tranquil. The gentle rays of the morning sun bathed her face in a dazzling holy aura.Huu!Lin Xun stepped forward without hesitation. He moved like a galloping horse, his presence compact and heavy.On closer inspection, the muscles on his body had swelled like an undulating ripple, concentrating all of their power. His entire being was akin to a fully pulled back bow, ready to strike with full power.Tiger Roar Echoing in the Mountain Forest!The punch had a completely different feel from yesterday: simple, clean, and direct. Power flowed from his arm to his shoulder and finally submerged into his spine, drawing along the core muscles near the ribs. All the tightly wound muscles abruptly sprang up like a spring.Boom!His fist blasted through the air, creating a muffled boom.Xia Zhi was completely unfazed as she twisted her hand and trapped Lin Xun's wrist like before. However, before she could exert any force, she felt his wrist muscles vibrate at an extreme speed, making his wrist as slippery as a mudfish.He instantly escaped from her vice-like grip.Lin Xun's eyes brightened. Sure enough, by applying the proper technique and force through his muscles, he could move every muscle, bone, and joint in his body as if they were his hands and fingers!Previously, he had only known a fighting style that centered around aeth power. It was only after a night of reflection did he understand that every inch of muscle, tendon, skin, and joint in his body contained great power. Once he mastered how to move them all in harmony, he would be able to display unimaginable power.<sub>For more_novel, visit elworld.com</sub>To better elaborate, the body could be likened to a battlefield. The muscles and joints were the soldiers deployed at various positions across the battlefield. If the commander was able to direct them as a single harmonious unit, an unstoppable army would be created!However, before Lin Xun could celebrate, Xia Zhi's fingers suddenly moved like a hissing snake. Her fingertips lightly brushed his wrist, causing him to lose all feeling around the area.Almost immediately after, his body was once again flung by the arm, smashing painfully into the ground.Lin Xun gritted his teeth, flipped to his feet, and charged forward once more.Xia Zhi's fingers had precisely found Lin Xun's wrist joint, disrupting his flow of power. This was why he had lost feeling in his wrist.Lin Xun understood what had happened immediately. As such, he was now on guard against this possibility.However, he was beaten back to the ground again two moves later!This time, he was defeated by an unexpected wrist lock. Xia Zhi's arms had clamped around his wrists like metal hoops. She then pushed forward with her left hand and pulled her right hand back, creating an opposing force that dislocated his wrists.The clean and effective maneuver caused Lin Xun's wrists to fall limp with a crack. He only felt the intense pain after his body kissed the ground again.This was the art of separating tendons and dislocating bones!After reconnecting his wrists, Lin Xun looked toward Xia Zhi again. However, there was no trace of dejection in his gaze but instead a burning fighting spirit.Although he only lasted two moves, it was a huge improvement from yesterday. This allowed Lin Xun to feel how rapidly he was progressing.\u201cContinue!\u201d With a low shout, Lin Xun moved. He had already abandoned the Marching Army Fist's forms. Since he was no longer fixated on the forms, his movements had become much more agile.Thud! Thump! Thud!Subsequently, a slew of goosebump-inducing sounds rang out from the yard.At some unknown time, the residence's main gates had been opened and a group of young kids dashed in. The village children could not help but gasp in shock when they saw their most respected martial instructor Lin Xun being repeatedly defeated by Xia Zhi.Xia Zhi was only six-years-old and she was no bigger than several of them. In fact, she was younger than most of them. Despite this, she was inconceivably crushing Lin Xun time and time again.The village children's hearts shivered each time Lin Xun was smashed into the ground. They were secretly relieved that they had not slighted Xia Zhi before, and did not dare to imagine what kind of fate would await them if they had.The uncles and aunties of the village were soon drawn over, keen on partaking in the excitement as well.<sub>Visit elworld.com, for the best no_vel_read_ing experience</sub>Although they likewise felt pained by the beating Lin Xun was receiving, they were even more shocked by how kick-ass Xia Zhi was.Only now did they find out that this unbelievably beautiful little girl possessed combat capabilities that could overwhelm even Lin Xun!Was this still a five-year-old?With so many people watching, even a thick-skinned person like Lin Xun could not help but feel embarrassed. He gritted his teeth and tried to ignore them as he cast his entire being into the fight.Xia Zhi, on the other hand, was completely unaffected. She countered each attack that came at her, sending Lin Xin to the ground time and time again in a merciless fashion.In her view, everything was for the sake of helping Lin Xun temper his body and thus needed to be treated with the utmost seriousness. Moreover, concepts such as dignity did not exist in Xia Zhi's dictionary.After watching Lin Xun's face kiss the ground numerous times, even Xiao Tianren was no longer able to continue watching. He glared at the surrounding villagers and waved his hand, \u201cIs everyone so free? Then follow me to Fiery Smoke Mountain!\u201dHe swiftly scattered the crowd and shut the gates, leaving Lin Xun and Xia Zhi to focus on their sparring.Only when night fell did Lin Xun finally drag his battered body into the wooden tub and began to review the details of the sparring.As for Xia Zhi, she went straight to sleep.This routine continued for five days.Over these five days, all Lin Xun did was eat, spar with Xia Zhi, and recover from his injuries using medicine soup while reviewing the details of the fights. Although monotonous, the training regime was extremely effective.Lin Xun gradually became familiar with the technique of controlling his body, and could skillfully maneuver every muscle, joint, and tendon.In addition, his body had undergone a remarkable transformation. Although it still looked like the same thin body on the outside, every inch of muscle, skin, and bone had been refined thousands of times, becoming as hard as a rock while also pliable like a steel wire; every inch had been repeatedly polished like jade and tempered like steel.Moreover, his qi and blood had also grown more robust!Although five days of nonstop defeats seemed soul-crushing, the benefits were clearly visible; Lin Xun's physical abilities had entered a whole new level.This was something that undoubtedly raised Lin Xun's spirits.However, his supply of beast meat, aeth grain, and various aeth resources was also being depleted at an alarming rate.<sub>Visit to elworld.com discover_new novels.</sub>Not only were they used for his recovery, both of their food intakes had also risen.Now, Lin Xun could eat half an adult snow spotted leopard and ten pounds of aeth grains!As for Xia Zhi, she never ate less than him and would often eat much more.At this rate, the supply of meat would be finished in less than half a month, while their stock of aeth grain would not last beyond a month.Lin Xun had no choice but to begin thinking about how to replenish their supplies.Fortunately, the villagers had already started mining operations under Xiao Tianren's leadership and had already collected over a hundred pounds of ore. Once the ore was refined, there should be around fifty pounds of Feiyun Fire Copper.If sold, it could fetch a small fortune.Lin Xun planned on making a trip to the Qingyang Tribe soon. Besides the Feiyun Fire Copper, he had several other valuables which could be traded for a tidy sum.On the morning of the fifth day, Lin Xun was surprised to find Xia Zhi missing. There was only a single strip of paper in the room on which a simple sentence had been scrawled\u2014'I'll be back soon.'Relieved, Lin Xun felt like chuckling as he gazed at Xia Zhi's message. The characters resembled crawling earthworms and were so ugly that he was barely able to recognize them.Since Xia Zhi said she would be back soon, there was no need to worry. Lin Xun walked into the kitchen and began preparing breakfast.When Lin Xun placed the steaming breakfast on the table, the residence's main gates were opened with a loud thump. A calf-like creature that was covered in a flame-like mane was thrown into the yard, shaking the surrounding ground.It was a fire mane boar!The boar was bound by thick and tough vines, and its mouth was gagged with mud. All it could do was lie there on the ground and try to growl, its scarlet-red eyes filled with rage and hatred.Meanwhile, Xia Zhi's tiny figure walked in. She washed her hands, sat at the table, and began to eat.Lin Xun dazedly stared at this scene. He pointed at the fiery mane boar, \u201cYou went out to catch this brute?\u201dXia Zhi nodded, \u201cAfter breakfast, you will fight this pig. Only through bloody battle will you learn how strong your body has grown.\u201dLin Xun's expression turned somewhat conflicted, \u201cIf I lose, won't it mean that I'm less than a pig?\u201dXia Zhi pondered before she earnestly answered, \u201cIndeed.\u201d<sub>The source of this_chapter; elworld.com</sub>Lin Xun's heart felt stuffy. It had merely been pure talk before. To think that she would actually capture a fiery mane boar. This was putting him in a difficult spot!\u201cDon't worry, I won't lose to a pig!\u201dLin Xun viciously glared at Xia Zhi. He also sat at the table and began to eat with gusto as if pumping himself up to slaughter the pig.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It was covered in flame-like fur that seemed soft but was actually tough to the extreme. Even a sword would have difficulty getting through.It had an aggressive, violent nature and was blessed with unparalleled strength. The pair of sinister tusks which grew from its mouth were deadly weapons that even a True Martial fourth layer expert would prefer to avoid.Compared to this savage, the snow spotted leopard and one-horned lizard were akin to docile farm animals.Rumble!In the yard, Xia Zhi removed the vines that bound the boar. The savage beast abruptly howled and slammed its four hooves into the ground causing dust to fill the air. Its enormous, bull-like body was akin to a small moving mountain as it ruthlessly charged at Lin Xun.Its sharp sinister tusks were akin to a pair of sharp razor-sharp blades, flickering with a bloodthirsty gleam.Thud!Lin Xun moved immediately. Power flowed into his hand and a fist smashed into the side of the savage beast's neck. However, the boar easily shook it off, completely unfazed. It suddenly spun around and thrust its sharp tusks through the air, stabbing toward Lin Xun's stomach.Lin Xun's eyes narrowed as he sidestepped, feeling quite astonished. Although his earlier blow had consisted of purely physical power, any True Martial fourth layer expert who took it would not be unscathed.However, it was completely ineffective against the boar.Rumble!The fiery mane boar was exceedingly barbaric. Its scarlet-red eyes glared at Lin Xun as its enormous body charged again.Lin Xun realized that it was impossible to dodge this time, leaving him no choice but to face the brute head-on. He immediately felt as if a boulder had slammed into his body, causing his qi and blood to churn erratically as he was pushed back.What overwhelming power!Lin Xun's expression darkened as his muscles tensed up like steel threads. He crouched like a cheetah and suddenly leaped forth, hooking his hand around one of the boar's tusks. Power gushed through his wrist, and his arm muscles rapidly expanded as he abruptly hoisted up.The thousand-pound fiery mane boar was raised off the ground.Lin Xun's shoulder muscles rapidly rose like the tide as power rapidly accumulated in his wrist. The force finally erupted with a ruthless jerk.Rumble~The boar's giant body was shaken like a sieve as its bones emitted cracking noises. The boar was mercilessly smashed into the ground by Lin Xun, creating a giant crater.Lin Xun had learned this technique from Xia Zhi. With a single jerk, power would ripple forth like the tide, shaking and disrupting the opponent's power. In serious cases, it could even rupture a foe's inner organs.<sub>Foll_ow current_novel on elworld.com</sub>Before Lin Xun could celebrate, however, the boar shook its body and stood up again. Its scarlet-red eyes overflowed with endless savagery as it charged at him again with a howl.Lin Xun's eyes nearly popped from their sockets. Was this brute invincible?He quickly dodged to the side and scanned the boar's body. The fiery mane boar had not sustained a single injury and had only become increasingly savage.Its four hooves seemed to fly as it charged about in the tiny and narrow yard. Dust clouds rose into the air and the ground was cracked in several places.If not for Xia Zhi, the charges would have destroyed all three of Lin Xun's thatched houses.\u201cBastard!\u201d Lin Xun's qi and blood roared, showing that he had also been angered. He was absolutely not going to admit that he could not even beat a pig. Otherwise, how would he ever raise his head in front of Xia Zhi in the future?Thud!Lin Xun no longer took any evasive maneuvers and faced the charge directly. He raised his arms in front of him and dashed into the incoming fiery mane boar, catching its tusks and forcibly stopping it in its tracks.The boar bellowed, clearly enraged to the max. Its four hooves pushed madly as its body violently twisted in an attempt to force off Lin Xun's hands.However, Lin Xun's arms suddenly squeezed like a noose. Two clear cracks rang out and the boar's tusks were snapped into two. Blood poured out as the boar frantically howled in pain, nearly shaking off Lin Xun's body.Lin Xun immediately dropped to his feet and locked the boar's leg joint with his arms. With a brutal twist and a crack, the boar's front right leg was dislocated, causing its body to crash into the ground.However, this was not the end. Lin Xun took advantage of the opportunity and did the same to the fiery mane boar's remaining three legs. In the span of a few breaths, its body lost all support and it could only miserably wail on the ground.Only then did Lin Xun finally stand up, dust off his hands, and let out a long, drawn-out breath.He looked at the subdued boar. Although he was exhausted, he could not help but feel a sense of pride flow out in his heart.Several months ago, he had been weak and pathetic. Now, he was able to subdue a savage beast comparable to a True Martial fourth layer cultivator with only physical force. It was impossible for Lin Xun to not be excited by such a tremendous transformation.It was all attributed to his relentless hard work and Xia Zhi's help.The constant sparring with Xia Zhi had made his body stronger with each passing day. His skin, muscles, and bones were now as hard as steel and filled with explosive power.At the same time, the continuous sparring also taught Lin Xun the secrets of properly utilizing his body. He was now capable of perfectly gathering every inch of power in his body!\u201cEven without aeth power, my raw physical might should allow me to challenge a True Martial fourth layer expert.\u201d Lin Xun pondered for a moment before shaking his head.A cultivator was different from a beast. A cultivator possessed equipment, weapons, techniques, and, most importantly, battle tactics and experience. There was no way to compare such an existence to a mere beast.Hence, it would not be so simple to defeat a True Martial fourth layer expert with physical power alone.<sub>New novel_chap_ters are published here: elworld.com</sub>Xia Zhi walked over and lightly tapped the fiery mane boar's head with her tiny hand. The beast immediately fell unconscious as if it had been struck by lightning.Xia Zhi looked at Lin Xun. \u201cYou're a bit stronger than this pig.\u201dThe pride in Lin Xun's heart instantly vanished. He helplessly shrugged and smiled bitterly, \u201cCan't you praise me just once?\u201dXia Zhi frowned as she earnestly considered, \u201cIs there any part of you that's worth praising?\u201dLin Xun was speechless.While they were eating lunch, Lin Xun thought of a question, \u201cWhen compared to aeth power, physical power seems to only be suitable for close combat. No matter how strong the body becomes, the power I gain will not be as great as focusing solely on aeth power cultivation.\u201dXia Zhi did not say a single word. Instead, she lightly swung her finger as if it were a blade.Ch!An arc of blade-like qi flew out and sliced off a willow branch that was more than a hundred feet away.Lin Xun was stunned while Xia Zhi shifted her focus back to the food.A long time later, Lin Xun said with a complicated expression, \u201cYou\u2026how do you cultivate?\u201dHe had seen everything clearly earlier. There had been no trace of aeth power in Xia Zhi's attack and it was created purely from her physical power!In other words, this was hard proof that when physical power reached a certain level, it could break free from the restrictions of 'close-combat'!From what Lin Xun knew, only Spirit Dipper stage and above aeth power cultivators were able to release their aeth power externally and kill their enemies from a distance away.With this comparison, Xia Zhi's external force release appeared even more extraordinary.Xia Zhi puzzledly said, \u201cIt's easy to achieve. I could do it once I remembered it.\u201dLin Xun was not as devastated by her unreasonable explanation this time and accepted it as the truth. After these few days of observation, he had discovered far too many inconceivable things about Xia Zhi. She was basically a born genius that knew everything from the start!How else could anyone explain why a five-year-old girl possessed such terrifying battle power?After a long session of thinking, Lin Xun ultimately gave up on getting to the bottom of the matter and instead asked Xia Zhi what the technique was called.In his view, the technique was very similar to martial arts and should not have appeared out of nowhere.<sub>Visit to elworld.com discover_new novels.</sub>Xia Zhi shook her head. \u201cIt has no name.\u201dLin Xun let out a bitter chuckle, \u201cThen let's give it one.\u201dXia Zhi offhandedly agreed.In contrast, Lin Xun was full of zest. After some thinking, he said, \u201cShall we call it Joint Disruption Art?\u201dHe had learned several close-combat techniques over the past few days, such as the shock ripple disruption, the double arm-twist, the bone-locking art\u2026etc.All of these techniques were simple, straightforward, and clean. They specialized in targeting the opponent's weak points such as joints and required a certain combination of ruthlessness and decisiveness.Xia Zhi half-heartedly nodded, not stopping Lin Xun's enthusiasm.His eyes shined as he confidently said, \u201cAlthough this art has yet to be perfected, I believe that through our combined intelligence, this art will become increasingly powerful. Who knows, it might even become famous one day and leave its mark in history.\u201dXia Zhi looked as if she wasn't even listening as she continued to eat.Lin Xun's passion soon dulled upon seeing that he was not getting any response. He shook his head and said, \u201cNever mind, this matter isn't urgent. We can discuss more next time.\u201dXia Zhi suddenly raised her head and looked at Lin Xun, \u201cDidn't you say you will be going to the Qingyang Tribe in a few days?\u201dLin Xun nodded, \u201cYeah. If everything goes smoothly, I should be leaving in five days.\u201dThe reason he said this was because according to his estimation, the Omega Secret-Realm's second attempt should arrive in three days. He intended to first deal with this matter before heading to the Qingyang Tribe.Lin Xun had gained some confidence over the past few days of training and was now somewhat expectant towards the Omega Secret-Realm's second trial.At this point, Lin Xun suddenly realized something and asked, \u201cWhy are you asking?\u201dXia Zhi responded, \u201cI find it a little hard to see you leave.\u201d\u201cIt's okay, I'll be back soon.\u201d A warm feeling flowed in Lin Xun's heart. Although the little lass had repeatedly pummeled him over the past few days, she at least had some conscience.However, Xia Zhi quickly shook her head, \u201cI'm just wondering who will be making my meals if you suddenly leave.\u201dLin Xun's face froze. So that's her concern\u2026He spitefully said, \u201cDon't worry, I'll definitely make sure you don't starve to death even if I leave!\u201dXia Zhi acknowledged with a peaceful expression, \u201cThat's good.\u201d<sub>Visit elworld.com for a better_user experience</sub>After which, she returned to her food\u2026Meanwhile, a dazzling streak of light suddenly flew over the old mountain forests a dozen miles from the village.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The runes rhythmically breathed in the surrounding aeth qi, creating a magical and extraordinary sight.The flying carpet was evidently an extremely valuable tool!There was a man and woman standing on the carpet.\u201cFirst Young Master, why have we stopped?\u201d The woman was puzzled. She wore a black dress, had a slender waist, and had an amazing figure. She had a beautiful oval face and nice black eyebrows. However, a sharp, blade-like aura spread from between her brows.She was like a wild rose, beautiful yet thorny.If any influential figure from Donglin City was present, they would certainly recognize this woman. She was Mu Wansu, who was also known as the 'Black Rose'.At the same time, she was also the manager of Donglin City's number one merchant association, Stone Cauldron Alms.Stone Cauldron Alms was one of the few merchant associations in the Ziyao Empire which had a far-reaching and extensive network. It had branches all over the empire's territory and boasted wealth that could rival a country.Stone Cauldron Alms' boss, Fortune God Shi, was a legendary figure in the empire. The wealth he possessed was rumored to have reached an astronomical number that even the powerful imperial clan members envied him.As someone who could become the Stone Cauldron Alms Donglin City branch manager, Black Rose Mu Wansu was clearly no ordinary person.However, this very individual was being respectful and deferential towards the man beside her.\u201cCan't you tell? A great battle occured here not too long ago.\u201d The man looked down with his hands behind his back.He had a tall figure with shoulders as broad as a mountain. The lines of his face were strong and bold. When his eyes opened or closed, an aura of disdain would unwittingly flow out which gave a heavy feeling akin to looking at a deep abyss.The mere sight of him standing there made a person feel an intimidating pressure as if they were looking up at a great mountain.\u201cA battle\u2026\u201d Mu Wansu's eyes focused as she took a closer look. Sure enough, she discovered that the mountain forest below had been struck by terrifying destructive power and traces of an earth-shaking battle were revealed one after another.Amazed, Mu Wansu commented, \u201cFirst Young Master has excellent observation skills.\u201d<sub>Visit elworld.com for a better_reading experience</sub>The man she called 'First Young Master' did not seem to care about such flattery. He mumbled to himself, \u201cIf my guess is correct, the capital's Black Cloth Alley Xie Clan's ninth son was one of the fighters. His opponent, however, is quite interesting.\u201d\u201cThe Xie Clan's ninth son?\u201d A carefree sword-wielding figure in a blue jade gown. appeared in Mu Wansu's head.Shocked, she asked, \u201cThe capital's recent rising star who has been praised as the Little Sword Lord, the Xie Clan's ninth young master?\u201d\u201cWho else can use the Ruling Sword Art? This sword art has great origins. Despite being rumored to be incomplete, it possesses astonishing and terrifying power that can subdue ghosts and slay gods.\u201dThe first young master's eyes shone brightly at the topic of martial arts, \u201cIt's a pity that we arrived a little late. We could have had the chance to admire the Ruling Sword Art's might.\u201dThere was regret in his voice.Mu Wansu was taken aback as waves churned in her heart. To think that it was the Little Sword Lord Xie Yutang\u2026The Ziyao Empire was extremely vast. In its capital, which was also known as the Forbidden City, was a very famous alley called Black Cloth Alley.Practically all of the empire's most powerful and influential noble clans could be found in Black Cloth Alley.The Xie Clan was a martial clan with a thousand years of history. It was a powerful clan that had always maintained its territory in Black Cloth Alley.As one of the Xie Clan's descendants, Little Sword Lord Xie Yutang was extremely famous and was said to be a first-class cultivation talent. He had shaken the entire Forbidden City when he successfully learned the Ruling Sword Art, turning him into one of the city's rising stars.After all, no one had managed to comprehend the Ruling Sword Art in nearly a hundred years!Although Mu Wansu was not from the Forbidden City, as a Stone Cauldron Alms manager, she had naturally heard of this matter. Hence why she was so shocked by the revelation.\u201cIn other words, the Xie Clan's ninth young master reached the Three Thousand Great Mountains earlier than us?\u201d After Mu Wansu returned to her senses, she soon realized the crux of the issue.\u201cHe must have.\u201d The first young master nodded. \u201cThere's currently no one in the Forbidden City who does not know that the stargazing platform's Heavenly Overseer has observed a strange phenomenon in the Three Thousand Great Mountains. Rumor says that an exceptional treasure has likely appeared and I believe Xie Yutang has come because of it.\u201dAs he spoke, he frowned and said, \u201cI'm only curious about the identity of Xie Yutang's opponent.\u201dMu Wansu contemplated for a while. She took out a map, checked it, and pointed in a certain direction, \u201cThere's a village called Feiyun Village a dozen miles from here. We might be able to find out something there.\u201dThe first young master was surprised, \u201cThere are people living in this remote place?\u201dMu Wansu smiled, \u201cBefore we left, I specially researched anything related to the Three Thousand Great Mountains. That's how I stumbled upon information that a small Feiyun Fire Copper vein was discovered here years ago.\u201d<sub>Visit elworld.com, for the best no_vel_read_ing experience</sub>As they conversed, the flying carpet was steered towards the direction she had indicated.Along the way, Mu Wansu explained the history of Feiyun Village, allowing the first young master to understand the village's origins.Moments later, the two appeared above Feiyun Village.\"No wonder these villagers survived. They've managed to cultivate aeth fields.\" The first young master displayed a thoughtful look as he observed the fields below.Soon after, his gaze paused and he pointed towards the eastern side of the village, \"There are aeth power undulations there which should belong to a cultivator. Come, let's go over and take a look.\"It was evening time. Lin Xun had already prepared dinner, which consisted of six large steaming plates of meat and a pot of crystal-like aeth rice.Lin Xun and Xia Zhi were seated at a table under the willow tree in the yard and were busily eating their dinner.Only three days remained before the Omega Secret-Realm's second trial. Lin Xun had no plans to continue training his body. Instead, he was hoping to use these final three days to rest and recover so that he would be in the best condition to take on the trial.Lin Xun swiftly explained as he ate, \"I've roughly summarized the Joint Disruption Art into five main principles: shake, twist, lock, pinpoint and crumble. Of course, this is only an initial organization. As we create more techniques in the future, we will be able to further perfect the art.\u201dHe did not know if Xia Zhi was listening. She was focused on her food as if Lin Xun's words were far less interesting than her meal.Lin Xun did not appear to be angered by her actions and continued to talk to himself. Learning and summarizing was a habit Lin Xun had picked up from Mister Lu.It was because Mister Lu never explained anything. Whenever Lin Xun encountered any problems or new findings, he would need to understand, study and make his own conclusions.Although the martial path was different from runes, it followed the same logic.As he was speaking, Xia Zhi suddenly put down her chopsticks and looked towards the distant sky. Graveness flashed across the pitch-black gem-like crescent eyes. \"Someone is coming.\"Lin Xun's heart shivered. A visit from the villagers would never elicit such a reaction from Xia Zhi.This meant that an outsider had arrived in Feiyun Village!\"Continue eating.\" Lin Xun considered their options and ultimately decided to meet whatever came at them with an unwavering will.Xia Zhi made a noise in assent and lowered her head to continue her meal.<sub>Updated_at elworld.com</sub>\"How fragrant.\" Moments later, a tall, stalwart figure pushed open the gates and invited himself in. He was followed by a lady wearing a black dress. It was the first young master and Mu Wansu.The first young master scanned the beast meat and skins that were hanging on the walls, before turning to the boy and girl seated at the table located in the center of the yard.\"May I ask who our two guests are?\" Secretly shocked, Lin Xun stood up and cupped his hands together. The man's and woman's presences were as immeasurable as a bottomless abyss. They were evidently very powerful individuals.Merely facing them made Lin Xun feel an oppressive pressure.\u201cEh, we're just passing by.\u201d The first young master arrived at the table and lowered his head to look at the six plates of meat. \u201cBlue vine python, jade plume mountain sable, striped tiger\u2026these dishes are nutritious, and it's been a long time since I've last tasted them. No wonder something smelled so fragrant.\u201dLin Xun's eyes narrowed and he suddenly grinned, \u201cSince that's the case, if the young master doesn't mind, please sit down and have a taste.\u201d\u201cI won't hold myself back then.\u201d The first young master chuckled and sat down. He picked up a pair of chopsticks and began to gorge himself. He certainly was not holding anything back and was treating the place as his own home.Even Mu Wansu was slightly taken aback, completely not expecting the first young master to show such great interest in the dishes.What delicacies had someone of his status never eaten before?Mu Wansu could not understand. She glanced at Lin Xun and relaxed when she saw that he was merely a boy at the True Martial third layer stage.Although Lin Xun did not know the couple's goal, he remained calm and did not attempt any little tricks.However, he would not let his guard down before figuring out their intentions.\u201cI'm going to sleep.\u201d Xia Zhi suddenly stood up and left.She had already covered her face with a hat at some unknown time and did not draw much attention from Mu Wansu. She merely took the girl as Lin Xun's younger sister.The first young master, however, shot a glance at Xia Zhi's leaving figure, his brows furrowing almost unnoticeably as if sensing something. In the end, he shook his head and continued to gorge himself on the meat.Lin Xun took in all of these little details. Upon seeing that there was no special reaction from Xia Zhi, he breathed a sigh of relief inside.\u201cYoung brother, shall we share a cup of wine?\u201d The first young master invited Lin Xun with a smile. A wine pot had appeared in his hand, giving off an intoxicating fragrance.\u201cGladly.\u201d Lin Xun smilingly walked forward and sat down. He looked happy and completely at ease.Mu Wansu could not help but look at Lin Xun again as surprise flashed in her eyes. Only a handful of people could maintain such composure in front of the first young master.<sub>Visit elworld.com, for the best no_vel_read_ing experience</sub>It was even more incredible for someone like Lin Xun, who was merely a boy from a poor and remote village, to act like this.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He lifted the wine pot and poured a cup for Lin Xun.The dark blue wine was translucent like amber, giving off a simple, elegant, and refreshing fragrance.Lin Xun's eyes shone when he looked at the cup, \u201cGood wine!\u201dHe had seen Mu Wansu's expression and could roughly guess that the wine was either poisonous or an extremely valuable and rare brew.In Lin Xun's opinion, the second possibility was more likely. After all, based on their terrifying auras, it was unnecessary for the man and woman to resort to such measures to kill him.Lin Xun downed the entire cup and his eyes soon brightened again.As the wine entered his mouth, it gave off a sensation of the never-ending spring rain. Warm and gentle aeth power soon began spreading to his entire body.Lin Xun felt his aeth power gradually boil as it slowly saturated. It flowed in a lively manner as if cheering.Lin Xun could not help but compliment it again, \u201cIt is indeed an excellent wine!\u201dAt the sight of Lin Xun's carefree attitude and straightforward wine mannerisms, the first young master could not help but look at him again in surprise. Soon after, the first young master chuckled, \u201cThis wine is called Four Seasons, and was personally brewed by Qinglu Academy Heavenly Workshop's Grandmaster Mei. The first cup tastes like a spring breeze in the night and focuses on bringing out the 'moistness' of spring.\u201dAs he explained, he poured Lin Xun another cup, \u201cTry the second cup.\u201dLin Xun did not hold back this time either and downed the second cup in a single gulp. He seemed to feel rumbling as a fiery torrent was poured down his throat. A surge of unbearable and fierce qi began to run amok inside his body, causing him to tremble uncontrollably. His skin began to turn red inch by inch and his face instantly flushed red as well.It felt like he was amidst the scorching heat of summer. Fire burned in his body like a furnace, evaporating the moisture outside while every aperture on his body spouted abundant aeth qi.Lin Xun opened his mouth and stuck out his tongue, \u201cTo think that the same pot of wine would have two such unique and distinct flavors. Qinglu Academy's Grandmaster Mei is definitely an amazing grandmaster brewer.\u201dMu Wansu was speechless. This kid was so ignorant. Grandmaster Mei was a first-class grandmaster alchemist in the empire!His Four Seasons Brew was considered a priceless treasure even in the Forbidden City, and was enjoyed by only the most powerful and influential figures!Although Mu Wansu was considered an influential figure, even she did not dare to hope for a taste of the Four Seasons Brew.<sub>New novel_chap_ters are published here: elworld.com</sub>Despite this, the first young master was using this precious wine to entertain a boy from a poor and remote village. This made Mu Wansu dumbfounded and envious, feeling that this ignorant boy really had some unbelievable luck.However, no one else would know of Mu Wansu's thoughts. The first young master let out a hearty laugh and said, \u201cThe second cup feels like a scorching sun down the throat and will make your organs feel as if they're burning. Its focus is intensity.\u201dHe looked at Lin Xun's bright red face and asked, \u201cYoung brother, would you like a third cup?\u201dLin Xun could not seem to properly gather his thoughts. It was not because he had a low alcohol tolerance, but because a mere two cups of the brew had caused his aeth power to grow drastically. It was as if a raging river was flowing into a tiny pond and was about to overwhelm its capacity.The Four Seasons Brew was clearly an aeth wine! Moreover, it must be extremely rare and valuable!Lin Xun forcefully circulated his cultivation, using his qi to cycle the rapidly increasing aeth power in his body in an effort to digest its potent energy.Meanwhile, he smiled and said, \u201cSince it's called the Four Seasons Brew, it would be far too regretful to not have a taste of the third and fourth cups.\u201dThis kid is so shameless!Mu Wansu cursed inside. She could roughly tell that Lin Xun had already experienced the benefits of the Four Seasons Brew. Logically speaking, he should have been panicking as he tried to decline. After all, who would be so shameless as to voluntarily ask for such a valuable wine?However, this kid was clearly trying to take a mile after being given an inch!The first young master was also taken aback. He did a quick doubletake of Lin Xun again and said, \u201cTo be honest, you have somewhat surprised me. An ordinary True Martial cultivator would have fallen drunk on the ground after the first cup, unable to bear the aeth power in the wine. However, you are clearly different from others.\u201dLin Xun squinted as if he was drunk. His cheeks were flushed as his mouth seemed to loosen, \u201cEh, I might be quite a good drinker.\u201dThe first young master chuckled and poured Lin Xun a third cup. The first young master suddenly pointed to the meat and skins hanging around the yard and asked, \u201cWere these savage beasts hunted by you?\u201dLin Xun shook his head, \u201cNope, there was a battle in the mountain forest some distance from here a few days ago. Most of these savage beasts were unlucky victims that were caught in the aftershocks of the battle. I was just lucky enough to take advantage of the situation.\u201dA battle!The first young master's and Mu Wansu's eyes suddenly became focused.Lin Xun continued to talk to himself as if he was drunk, \u201cYou might not know this, but the two combatants were Spirit Sea stage experts. One of them traveled on a flying sword like a sword immortal\u2026\u201dSo it was Xie Yutang!The first young master and Mu Wansu were now certain.Mu Wansu could not help but ask, \u201cWho was his opponent?\u201d<sub>Visit to elworld.com discover_new novels.</sub>\u201cHe seems to have been called\u2026a brute warrior.\u201d Lin Xun frowned in thought. \u201cI can't really remember.\u201dWhile answering, he downed his third cup of wine. The taste this time was fresh, cool, and cleansing like a flowing stream. It gave him a broad sensation like he was high up in the autumn sky, alone in the vast emptiness.Rumble!The aeth power in his body erupted like a volcano, rushing and crashing through his channels with increasing ferocity.Even the repeated refining by the aeth power vortex at Lin Xun's four heart acupuncture points was unable to restrain the rapidly rising momentum.At this rate, instead of benefiting him, the violent aeth power would do irreversible damage to his body.Lin Xin gritted his teeth and cast away all unnecessary thoughts. With a deep breath, he got into a cross-legged sitting posture and began to attack the next cultivation level!His unusual actions were not much of a surprise to the first young master and Mu Wansu, who instead felt it normal.After all, the Four Seasons Brew was made for Spirit Dipper stage and above cultivators and contained a tremendous amount of aeth power. It was unimaginable for a True Martial third layer youngster like Lin Xun to have finished three entire cups without passing out immediately.However, what currently drew the two guests' attention was the brute warrior Lin Xun had mentioned.\u201cTo think that the Darkness Kingdom's experts have also come to the Three Thousand Great Mountains. Could they have also heard the news about the exceptional treasure that might have appeared?\u201d The first young master frowned as killing intent spread from between his brows.The Darkness Kingdom was located deep within the wastelands and was the Ziyao Empire's mortal enemy!\u201cIt should not be wrong since it was said by Xie Yutang. I never expected the Darkness Kingdom would become restless again after a thousand years.\u201d Mu Wanyu pursed her lips as worry appeared in her eyes.\u201cPutting aside this matter for the moment, I'm curious whether Xie Yutang managed to find the treasure.\u201d Iciness flowed in the first young master's eyes.Mu Wansu did not know what to say. There were still far too few clues. There was no way to get any reliable information unless they found Xie Yutang and asked him.The first young master also understood this and shook his head. His gaze turned towards Lin Xun.Mu Wansu also shifted her attention to the boy and could not help but ask in a low voice, \u201cFirst Young Master, why did you bring out the Four Seasons Brew to entertain such a person? Isn't this far too wasteful?\u201dThe first young master shook his head to tell her not to speak any further on this topic.Although Mu Wansu was still confused, she ceased her questioning.The time it took to brew a pot of tea passed.<sub>For more_novel, visit elworld.com</sub>Lin Xun opened his eyes as abundant aeth power pulsed strongly around him. His entire aura had changed in a short span of time, now possessing a certain sharpness akin to a sword leaving its sheath.Inside his body, pure and rich aeth power swam through his channels, apertures, and the four heart acupuncture points; it made a round through his five organs before returning to his channels.In contrast to before, faint light now flowed in his many apertures, creating better harmony in his qi and blood.This was the True Martial fourth layer, Orifice Unlocking!By unlocking the orifices, the flow of qi and blood would improve. Upon reaching this cultivation stage, the cultivator's qi and power would undergo a complete transformation.\u201cCongratulations on advancing another step on your cultivation journey.\u201d The first young master smiled and cupped his hands together.Lin Xun hurriedly rose to his feet and returned the gesture, \u201cIt was thanks to the young master's generosity. How else would I have obtained such a blessing?\u201dThe first young master chuckled and waved his hand, \u201cNo need to be courteous. It was only a few small cups of wine. Please sit down.\u201dLin Xun happily obliged.Although this cultivation advancement had been far too out of the blue and had caught him off guard, when he thought about it, he realized that he now unknowingly owed the other party a debt of gratitude.However, Lin Xun would not say this out loud. After all, who knew whether the other party had done so intentionally? He would return the favor if he found an opportunity to do so in the future, but if no chance came by, he would take it as if it had never happened.Lin Xun was not a stubborn and old-fashioned person. He would not try to desperately repay a debt of gratitude.Upon seeing Lin Xun sit down in a cool and relaxed manner, Mu Wansu could not help but increase her opinion of him. Would another person have been able to maintain such a delicate balance between knowing when to advance or retreat?\u201cTo be frank, I've come to the Three Thousand Mountains in search of a special treasure. I've heard that a strange phenomenon occurred here three months ago. Do you know anything about this matter?\u201d The first young master casually asked as he poured Lin Xun a fourth cup.\u201cI don't recall anything.\u201d Lin Xun shook his head. \u201cI would definitely remember if anything special happened over the past few months, but nothing really comes to mind. The villagers can verify this.\u201dThe first young master acknowledged this and fell into deep thought.Mu Wansu frowned, \u201cAre you certain?\u201dBefore Lin Xun could reply, the first young master waved his hand and said, \u201cIt's alright. No need to probe any further. I already have my answer.\u201dMu Wansu was clearly unsatisfied and viciously glared at Lin Xun. Never mind that the brat did not know how to be grateful after drinking the Four Seasons Brew, but he could not even give them any useful information. This was truly infuriating.However, she also understood that a youngster from a poor and remote village like Lin Xun most likely would not know any details about the treasure.<sub>This_content is taken from elworld.com</sub>It was at this moment that the residence's gates were pushed open as Village Chief Xiao Tianren excitedly rushed in, \u201cGood news, we had an excellent haul today\u2026\u201dHis words came to an abrupt halt.Xiao Tianren's expression changed slightly when he suddenly discovered that there were two strangers in the yard with Lin Xun.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

When he subsequently saw the crowd of villagers behind Xiao Tianren, Lin Xun could not help but feel a little nervous.Every villager was carrying a large sack on their back. There was no need to guess. The sacks obviously contained the Feiyun Fire Copper ore they had mined.In addition, two young kids had followed along, each holding a fiery-red Feiyun Fire Copper ore. There was basically no way to hide it now.Various thoughts flashed in Lin Xun's head as he moved forward to meet the group with a smile, \u201cUncle Xiao, leave the items here.\u201dXiao Tianren dazedly nodded his head and quickly set about the task, ignoring the two strangers in the yard.The other villagers could also sense that something was amiss. Although they were puzzled, no one asked any further questions. Even the two kids were tightly hugged by the adults to prevent them from saying something wrong.In the end, Lin Xun gave Xiao Tianren a look. The latter quickly understood and hurriedly departed with the group of villagers.\u201cFeiyun Fire Copper ore?\u201d Mu Wansu finally spoke after silently watching the entire process. \u201cWasn't that small copper vein already mined out?\u201dLin Xun did not hide anything and calmly explained, \u201cBig sister might not know this but I stumbled into the abandoned mine a few days ago and discovered a yet to be mined vein deep in the mine.\u201d\u201cThat's quite a fortune you've discovered.\u201d Mu Wansu shot a meaningful glance at Lin Xun.The first young master was likewise rather surprised. \u201cAeth fields, savage beasts and Feiyun Fire Copper ore. Your village is quite a money-earner.\u201dLin Xun shrugged with a bitter smile, \u201cYoung master, Feiyun Village is located deep in the Three Thousand Great Mountains, and even the 'nearest' Qingyang Tribe is more than two thousand miles. Although we have some ore, aeth grain, and hunting grounds, it is honestly not easy for us to exchange them for money.\u201dThe first young master chuckled. He could tell in a single glance that Lin Xun was worried they would have designs on these riches. However, the first young master did not expose Lin Xun's thoughts. \u201cThat is quite a problem indeed.\u201dLin Xun sighed, \u201cExactly.\u201dThe first young master revealed a thoughtful look. He retrieved a token and casually tossed it to Lin Xun. \u201cThere's a merchant group in the Qingyang Tribe called Stone Cauldron Alms. If you're looking to exchange your produce, you can try heading there with this token.\u201d\u201cFirst Young Master, you absolutely cannot!\u201d Alarmed, Mu Wansu said, \u201cThis token is your personal artifact, and is too valuable and important. How can you give it away so easily?\u201dLin Xun had originally intended to decline, but could not help but change his mind upon seeing this scene. His fingers tightly clutched the token.\u201cIt serves no purpose to me anyway, so why not give it away? Moreover, how can something that I, Shi Xuan, give away be taken back?\u201d The first young master calmly said with a hint of pride.<sub>Visit to elworld.com discover_new novels.</sub>Mu Wansu was still deeply worried, \u201cBut this\u2026\u201dThe first young master waved his hand, \u201cIt's settled, so don't say anything more.\u201dHe turned his head towards Lin Xun, \u201cYoung brother, I believe fate has brought us together. If you ever come to the Forbidden City, feel free to seek me out at Stone Cauldron Alms. Farewell.\u201dAfter speaking, he turned around and left.Mu Wansu reluctantly glanced at the token in Lin Xun's hand before venomously glaring at him, hoping to intimidate him into voluntarily giving the token up.However, Lin Xun acted oblivious and ignored her. He turned his head and solemnly said to the departing first young master, \u201cI will repay the young master's kindness in the future.\u201dUpon seeing this, Mu Wansu knew that the shameless youngster was determined to keep the token. She gnashed her teeth and said in a low voice, \u201cBrat, I'll settle this debt next time!\u201dLin Xun immediately displayed a terrified expression as he intentionally said in a loud voice, \u201cBig sister, what debt are you referring to? Are you resenting me because I wasn't a good enough host?\u201dAt these words, Mu Wansu cursed inside.Sure enough, the first young master's voice soon sounded from afar, \u201cHahaha, don't be angry young brother, Mu Wansu was only joking with you. Wansu, come quickly. We're leaving.\u201dMu Wansu felt vexed and angry. She had not expected the youngster to be so shameless.Despite this, she maintained a lovely smile on her face. Her beautiful eyes seemed to swirl in thought as she sweetly said, \u201cLittle brother, big sister has suddenly recalled that the Qingyang Tribe is quite close to Donglin City. We'll definitely be meeting again if there's a chance.\u201dAfter which, she left with a twirl of her black dress.Grinning, Lin Xun replied in a loud voice, \u201cDon't worry big sister, I will definitely come to visit you in Donglin City if there's a chance. When that time comes, I hope that you will help stand up for me if I get bullied!\u201dMu Wansu's figure paused for a moment at the doorstep. She could not help but feel annoyed when she recalled Lin Xun's shamelessness and crafty appearance.Brat, since you dare to call me big sister, I'll make sure to let you have a taste of your big sister's methods in the future!Mu Wansu silently cursed as she quickened her footsteps. If she stayed a second longer, she was worried that she would not be able to hold herself back from beating up the repulsive brat.Mu Wansu was not being petty. In fact, she clearly understood the weight of the first young master Shi Xuan's token. It not only represented him but also possessed an unimaginable authority!How could Mu Wansu not feel anxious when such a token was so casually thrown to a backwater village youngster?However, spilled water was difficult to recollect and Mu Wansu had no choice but to concede on this matter.<sub>New_chap_ters are pub_lished on elworld.com</sub>After sending the two guests away with his eyes, Lin Xun silently stood on the spot for a long time. Only after seeing a streak of light soar into the sky did he let out a long, drawn-out breath as he collapsed into the chair.The earlier events might have seemed smooth-sailing on the surface, but to Lin Xun, it had felt more exhausting than a desperate battle.Both the first young master Shi Xuan and the woman called Wansu were extremely formidable characters. This not only described their cultivation but also their intelligence and cunning.Although Lin Xun had seemed composed while sitting with them, he was extremely tense throughout, not daring to show the slightest bit of carelessness.Although everything was now over, Lin Xun still had a few questions.First young master Shi Xuan was likely an expert with high status and his goal for coming here was easy to guess: the exceptional treasure he had mentioned.This was the key. If Lin Xun's guess was not wrong, the strange phenomenon Shi Xuan talked about had coincidentally occurred three months ago when he unraveled the secret of the Omega Secret-Realm!Was there some relation between these two events?Lin Xun did not dare to speak carelessly and would never tell anyone what he knew.However, it puzzled him that someone like Shi Xuan would bring out such a precious wine to entertain Lin Xun and ask a few completely unnecessary questions. Moreover, Shi Xuan had given his token to Lin Xun right before their farewell!Why had he done this?Lin Xun did not believe there was such a thing as a free meal in this world. Even if there was, it would never happen to him.However, he could not decipher Shi Xuan's thoughts no matter how long he mulled over the various possibilities. In the end, he could only put the matter aside. It was enough that the other party did not display any ill intent.There was still a cup of wine on the table; the Four Seasons Brew's 'winter cup'. Lin Xun picked up the cup and downed it in a single gulp. Bone-piercing cold stabbed its way down his throat, turning into countless tiny cold flows which spread throughout his body and made him shiver uncontrollably.This wine was amazing.A single pot of wine yet four distinct flavors. Additionally, there was even an extremely terrifying amount of aeth power concealed within. At Lin Xun's current cultivation, he could only assimilate twenty percent of its power. As for the rest, most of it was firmly suppressed and stored in his body.A rapid increase in power might not always be a good thing. If a cultivator advanced too quickly, he could very easily end up with an unstable foundation which would in turn affect his future cultivation.Lin Xun pursued a state known as 'flawless perfection akin to water overflowing from a full cup'. He was extremely serious about building a solid foundation.He did not seek rapid cultivation level advancement because it would instead make his future path increasingly narrow. That would be akin to climbing a tree to search for fish, a completely fruitless endeavor.<sub>Foll_ow current_novel on elworld.com</sub>Meanwhile, on a flying carpet that was whizzing about among the clouds.Since there were no longer any outsiders around, Mu Wansu could finally ask the question that had been plaguing her heart, \u201cFirst Young Master, why did you do that earlier?\u201d\u201cI knew you would not be able to resist.\u201dShi Xuan stood with his hands behind his back, his mighty figure akin to an unmovable mountain. \u201cWould you believe me if I said it was merely on impulse?\u201dMu Wansu was taken aback. She soon shook her head.\u201cBut I do believe in fate.\u201dShi Xuan nonchalantly said, \u201cThe boy should be of similar age to my third brother. It's rare to find someone without any trace of the pride that should accompany a person of his age. That's not all; his boldness, intelligence, and adaptability are very remarkable. A person like him will never be content to stay in a tiny place like Feiyun Village.\u201dMu Wansu sneered, \u201cTo me, he looks like a shameless and crafty little thief. He's nowhere near as outstanding as you make him out to be.\u201dShi Xuan chuckled as he calmly gazed at the distant mountains and rivers. \u201cYou don't understand. There's a type of person in this world who will shine gloriously the moment he's given a chance. Although it's still too early to say anything about the boy, we'll know whether he's a dragon or a snake in the future.\u201dMu Wansu never imagined that the first young master would view a country bumpkin so highly. The revelation made her expression subconsciously turn serious.When she thought about it more closely, the mannerisms and speech Lin Xun had displayed since their sudden entry were indeed not something a youngster from a backwater village should possess.However, the crafty appearance Lin Xun had shown right before she left made it very difficult for her to view him as an outstanding individual with amazing potential.Mu Wansu sighed, \u201cI'm only worried that he does not understand your kind intentions. There are far too many ingrates in this world.\u201dA carefree smile rose from the corners of Shi Xuan's mouth, \u201cIt's just some wine and token which has little use. How much can they be worth? It doesn't matter even if he forgets me in the future. Do you think that I would obsess over a youngster's gratitude?\u201dMu Wansu answered without hesitation, \u201cOf course not!\u201dWhat a joke, who did they think Shi Xuan was?He was the first-born of Stone Cauldron Alms' boss, Fortune God Shi, and a top-tier shining star even among the Forbidden City's younger generation!Most importantly, Shi Xuan was a Spirit Sea expert who could go toe to toe with the Little Sword Lord Xie Yutang!It might perhaps be as Shi Xuan had said. Everything he had done was merely akin to an inconsequential passing glance.There were all kinds of strange and bizarre things in this world. Truth and lies, reality and illusion. Some truths were actually simple and not as complicated as one would imagine.<sub>The most up-to-date nov_els are published_here > elworld.com</sub>Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

An intricate rune array had been carved onto its surface.On the other side were three ancient gilded words\u2014\u2014Stone Cauldron Alms.If Lin Xun's guess was correct, the rune array was a symbol unique to Stone Cauldron Alms.\u201cSeveral problems could be solved with this token\u2026\u201dLin Xun carefully kept the token in his storage ring as he began to ponder about his trip to the Qingyang Tribe and the bartering he would have to do.A few days ago, Xia Zhi had killed the Wu Apothecary's chief steward, Wu Henshui. According to Lin Xun's understanding of the world, the other party would not take this lying down.The Stone Cauldron Alms token he now had might hold a clue to resolving this problem.\u201cNo matter what, I still have to make a trip to the Qingyang Tribe.\u201dLin Xun's eyes were deep in thought.In the Three Thousand Great Mountains region, the Qingyang Tribe was the closest location to Donglin City. From what Village Chief Xiao Tianren had described, it was comparable to a bustling town.It was a place Lin Xun needed to visit regardless of whether it was to solve the problem of the villagers' livelihoods or for his future cultivation progress.Before all that, however, Lin Xun had one more matter he needed to attend\u2014the second trial of the Omega Secret-Realm!At night, Xia Zhi woke up and walked out of the room. She observed Lin Xun's busy figure in the kitchen in silence for a long time, before she said, \u201cLin Xun, I wish to become stronger.\u201dLin Xun was stunned. He swiftly brought out the cooked dishes one by one before earnestly looking at Xia Zhi, \u201cWhy do you wish so?\u201dXia Zhi pursed her lips, \u201cNo reason.\u201dThe young girl's expression was as serene as usual. However, there was a never-before-seen determination in her pitch-black pupils.Lin Xun was silent for a moment. As he recalled the events in the day, he seemed to understand something. \u201cThat man and woman aren't bad people.\u201dXia Zhi shook her head, \u201cI don't know who is good or bad. I only know that if I don't become stronger, the initiative will never be mine when I encounter someone stronger than myself. I do not like that feeling.\u201dLin Xun nodded, \u201cI understand.\u201dHe did understand. Xia Zhi's views might be simple, but she could naturally see things very clearly and knew what she needed.<sub>New novel_chap_ters are published here: elworld.com</sub>Like how Xia Zhi had to abandon her most beloved food and hide in the room when the first young master Shi Xuan and Mu Wansu arrived.At that moment, she had definitely sensed that she was not Shi Xuan's match and had no choice but to retreat for the time being.Lin Xun filled Xia Zhi's bowl as he asked, \u201cHow do you plan on growing stronger?\u201dXia Zhi picked up her chopsticks and thought for a long time. In the end, she answered, \u201cBattle! As long as I fight strong people, I will be able to rapidly grow stronger.\u201dLin Xun's eyes narrowed, not expecting this answer. It made his heart ache because it felt like a last resort to grow stronger.If only they had a teacher's or elder's guidance. If only they had some kind of great inheritance. If only they had an abundance of cultivation resources. Who would voluntarily choose battle in order to grow stronger?Unfortunately, Lin Xun and Xia Zhi were all alone in this world, like a pair of orphans who could only rely on themselves.Lin Xun ultimately made his decision, \u201cWe can discuss this matter at a later date. I will give you a proper answer after a few days.\u201dXia Zhi nodded.She had never doubted or objected to Lin Xun's decisions because she had complete trust in him.It was this very trust that made Lin Xun secretly resolve himself to leave Feiyun Village with Xia Zhi after finishing their affairs here. He intended to head to Donglin City and find her the best cultivation venue no matter the cost or method!Lin Xun absolutely did not wish to see Xia Zhi fighting against powerful enemies. It was just far too dangerous.Three days passed in a flash.At night, Xia Zhi was slumbering peacefully. Starlight sprinkled onto her fair and beautiful face from the window, bathing her in a pure and sacred glow.Lin Xun was seated in a cross-legged posture with a calm and peaceful expression.In his mind-sea, wisps of consciousness surged towards the silently floating mysterious blood-red door.Omm~A familiar feeling washed over his body as if he was strolling through time and space. Stars swirled around him and, when he returned to his senses, he found that he had already appeared in a mysterious domain.The straight Great Azure Cloud Path stretched out into the distance, ending at the mysterious and majestic Omega Door.Lin Xun stood on the path and took in everything, unable to stop himself from feeling overwhelmed. This was the Omega Secret-Realm. What kind of person could have created such an amazing thing?A cryptic undulation stealthily approached and scanned Lin Xun in the blink of an eye. A split second later, a cold emotionless voice sounded.\u201cDao Seeker, the Great Azure Cloud Path's second trial is called body tempering and you will be given a hundred and eight attempts. There will be three days of rest between each failure, and if you fail all hundred and eight times, this trial will be considered a failure and the Omega Secret-Realm will return to a sealed state.\u201d<sub>You can_find the rest of this_content on the elworld.com platform.</sub>\u201cI understand. Let's begin.\u201d Lin Xun's expression was calm. His clear and deep eyes shone with determination.\u201cThe trial shall begin.\u201d As the voice echoed, a light screen surged out from the Great Azure Cloud Path. Within it was a sea where endless waves raged violently, even reaching all the way to the sky.Before Lin Xun could react, a giant vortex suddenly swept out from the screen and instantly swallowed his figure like a black hole.Body tempering trial will start.Venue: rune battle realm\u2014Thousand Heavy Wave Sea!Pass condition: break through the waves and ascend the peak.In the dark room, the sleeping Xia Zhi suddenly opened her eyes. When she saw Lin Xun's seated figure, she could not help but close her eyes again.However, she opened them a split second later as frustration emerged within them. Within her senses, Lin Xun seemed to have completely vanished, not even leaving a sliver of his presence behind.However, when she opened her eyes, she found that Lin Xun was still seated in front of her. This confused Xia Zhi. Her pitch-black eyes widened and concentrated on Lin Xun. After she was certain that he was real, she shut her eyes again to sleep.However, she immediately lost Lin Xun's presence again. This made Xia Zhi feel an unexplainable frustration for the very first time.It was a long time later before the little girl fell asleep again.Rumble~~The thunderous sound of rapidly flowing water boomed in Lin Xun's ears, nearly bursting his eardrums.When he opened his eyes again, he discovered that he had appeared in an endless sea. The sky-blue waters stretched out into the horizon, seemingly merging with the sky itself.Less than ten thousand feet away stood a mountain that reached straight into the heavens. It was an extremely unique mountain; giant white-dragon-like waves poured down its peak and crashed into the sea below, lifting numerous waves.From a distance, it looked like a water mountain made from hundreds and thousands of waves falling from the sky. It was magnificent.At the same time, information about the trial appeared in Lin Xun's head, allowing him to instantly understand that he had to push through the falling waves and ascend the peak!Lin Xun's expression turned exceedingly grave. He was currently at the True Martial fourth layer. Although it was not difficult to climb the mountain, the challenge lay in how he would overcome the torrential downpour!It was unavoidable.Lin Xun carefully observed the mountain. It was tall, likely reaching ten-thousand-feet in height. An endless waterfall poured down from its peak, roaring like water dragons. There was essentially no way to avoid the powerful force of the falling water to ascend the mountain.Although a hundred and eight attempts seemed a lot, Lin Xun understood that this only proved the insane difficulty of the trial.<sub>Visit elworld.com, for the best no_vel_read_ing experience</sub>He decided that he would not waste a single attempt.\u201cThe key likely lies in how to face the battering force of the waves because stability is required to climb. Being washed away will probably result in failing the attempt. Since the trial is called body tempering, it likely means that I'll have to challenge it using only my physical power. As for aeth power\u2026it'll likely be of no use here.\u201dLin Xun began walking and discovered that although he was unable to fly, he could walk on the surface of the sea as if it were land. There was no sign of him sinking into the water.This was probably some special rule of the rune battle realm and Lin Xun did not dwell on it. He did not immediately rush to climb the mountain either and instead spent two hours circling the mountain as he closely inspected each inch of it.There was no shortcut!After ascertaining this, Lin Xun extinguished all thoughts of trying some kind of bypass and cautiously advanced towards the foot of the mountain.The surging waterfall roared like an angry dragon, crashing down with a terrifying force that raised thousands of waves on the sea.Although he was only at the mountain's foot, Lin Xun could already feel a suffocating pressure. He tried to circulate the aeth power in his body and, sure enough, he found that his aeth power seemed to be restricted, making it impossible to use.This further proved that the trial was a test of his physical power!With a deep breath, Lin Xun raised his head to gaze upon the magnificent scene before him and could not help but feel confidence rising within him. How exhilarating would it be to conquer such a mountain?There was no more hesitation. Lin Xun's muscles tightened like a bowstring, swelling as he concentrated his physical power to the max. He pushed a foot back as his other foot stepped onto a protruding rock.Rumble!The wave of water mercilessly slammed into Lin Xun's body, causing him to stagger as he was nearly sent flying.It was more powerful than the full-power blow of a True Martial third layer cultivator!Though alarmed, Lin Xun executed the thousand catty drop[1] technique with his toes, firmly gripping the rock as if he had metal claws to stabilize his body.However, he still had to endure the constant battering of the falling water. It felt as if someone was ruthlessly smashing a giant hammer into his body again and again, inflicting unbearable pain.Lin Xun knew that he could not stop here. If this continued, it would be over sooner or later.He gritted his teeth, stretched his arms in front of him, and pushed against the falling water. His fingers dug into the stone wall, his body hugging the rocks as close as possible as he began to climb.Thud! Thud!Moments later, however, two consecutive waves slammed into his body, sending him flying before he could respond.\u201cF*ck! Isn't this way too difficult?!\u201d Lin Xun could not help but curse in the air. A split second later, he returned to the Omega Secret-Domain's Great Azure Cloud Path.At the same time, the robotic ice-cold voice rang out, \u201cDao Seeker's first attempt: fail.\u201d1. a technique of the plum-blossom martial art that makes it very difficult to lift the user from the ground\u2014https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meihuaquan) \u261c<sub>This_content is taken from elworld.com</sub>Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

His clothes were already drenched in sweat.\u201cThe second trial was much crazier than expected\u2026\u201d mumbled Lin Xun. However, he was not discouraged. He had already predicted that he would not have a high chance of passing the trial on the first try.The only surprise was that he would fail so quickly. He was honestly still a little unable to come to terms with it.He glanced at the soundly sleeping Xia Zhi. Since he was not feeling the least bit sleepy, Lin Xun walked out of the room to take a cold shower.As he left, Lin Xun was completely oblivious to the faint smile that rose from the corners of Xia Zhi's lips.She had sensed Lin Xun's presence while asleep. Although she did not understand what had happened, feeling his presence gave her an unprecedented peace of mind.It was late at night. Stars flickered in the dome of the sky, sprinkling their faint light onto the land.In the yard, Lin Xun was soaking in the wooden tub. The ice-cold sensation of the water over his skin soothed the piercing pain, making it slowly recede.\u201cThe second attempt will begin in three days, but I'm afraid that I'm certain to fail at my current level of physical power.\u201dLin Xun leaned against the side of the tub as he blankly stared at the night sky.The water mountain was ten-thousand-feet tall, and the water flow was rapid and powerful; the battering force had wildly surpassed his imagination. It was basically impossible to ascend the peak against such a torrential flow.Lin Xun suspected that even if his physique reached the True Martial ninth layer, he would still have little hope of passing the trial.\u201cWhat a headache.\u201d Lin Xun was unable to find a solution no matter how hard he racked his brains. In the end, he let out a deep sigh.Eh?Lin Xun suddenly discovered that his energy was recovering at an unimaginable speed. Every inch of his skin, muscles, blood, and flesh were giving off a slightly numb sensation as if they were growing.Lin Xun's attention was immediately drawn and he took a closer look. Sure enough, he discovered wisps of peculiar power continuously fusing with his body.Not only was his energy rapidly recovering, but his body was also growing stronger!This unexpected change made him feel a surge of excitement, causing him to suddenly recall what happened several months ago when he first left the Omega Secret-Realm.<sub>Visit elworld.com for a better_reading experience</sub>Back then, he had originally assumed his only prize for passing the Great Azure Cloud Path's first trial was the Little Divine Meditation Art. Who could have imagined that the injuries at his four heart acupuncture points would also disappear and even allow him to create four aeth power vortexes!Furthermore, his originally weak physique had been improved tremendously!\u201cCould entering the Omega Secret-Realm have some kind of secret beneficial effect on my physique? Or perhaps the changes have something to do with the body tempering trial?\u201dVarious possibilities began to swirl in Lin Xun's head. The Great Azure Cloud Path's second trial had sent me into a rune battle realm called the Thousand Heavy Wave Sea.Could what have initially seemed to be punishing pain left by the torrential downpour of water actually be a kind of training?It was possible!The name of the trial was body tempering. Aeth power was forbidden and I can only use physical power.The more he thought about it, the more he was certain that the wisps of peculiar power in his body originated from the Thousand Heavy Wave Sea!This discovery immediately excited him and swept away all his earlier disappointment. He hurriedly wiped his body dry, changed into a set of clean clothes, and began to practice the Marching Army Fist in the yard.Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!Fist winds rippled through the air. As he closely examined his physical power, Lin Xun discovered that it had grown substantially!Previously, only a full-power punch could shake the surrounding air and make it howl. Now, even an ordinary strike could achieve the same impact.\u201cHmm, it seems that I can't give up on any trial attempts even if I have no chance of passing. If each trial improves my physique, I will grow stronger with each attempt. Correspondingly, the trial will gradually become easier than before.\u201dThe more he thought about it the clearer it became. \u201cSo that's how it is! The second trial's true goal is to train my physique. There will be hope even if I fail repeatedly!\u201cLike how the first trial might have appeared to test the examinee's ability to understand the secrets of the flowing light rune, but the true secret of the flowing light rune was actually the Little Divine Meditation Art?\u201cIt seems that I've underestimated the Great Azure Cloud Path's trials design. Who could have imagined that there would be an unimaginable secret behind each trial?\u201dLin Xun felt as if the clouds had cleared and he could see the sun. Everything had suddenly become so clear. His eyes shone like stars as he stood amidst the darkness of the night.Three days passed.At night, Lin Xun entered the Omega Secret-Realm and attempted the Thousand Heavy Heavy Wave Sea trial again.<sub>Visit elworld.com for a better_user experience</sub>Due to his strengthened physique, Lin Xun managed to climb twenty feet higher this time before he was ultimately flung away by three torrential waves.Rather than focus on his failure, Lin Xun was more concerned about the changes in his physique this time. Sure enough, after some careful inspection, he discovered that his hypothesis was correct. After the attempt, his physical power had grown again!Lin Xun did some calculations: if the trial could be attempted once every three days, 108 trials would take 324 days. This was nearly a year!If he could raise his physical power each time, the benefits were practically immeasurable.This was not all. While the trial was awesome, his daily training was also an alternate method that trained his body. With these two superimposed together, it was exciting to imagine how strong his body would become.All of this reignited Lin Xun's fighting spirit, making him more determined than ever to conquer the Great Azure Cloud Path's second trial.\u201cWhat a pity. If only I didn't accumulate so many resources and be forced to make a trip to the Qingyang Tribe. I rather spend all of my time on training.\u201d Lin Xun sighed. He had already promised Village Chief Xiao Tianren he would head out tomorrow and begin his long trip to the Qingyang Tribe.The next morning.At the village entrance, Lin Xun waved goodbye to the villagers from atop a majestic scaled horse.\u201cI'll be waiting for your return.\u201d Besides the scaled horse, Xia Zhi raised her face, revealing a serious expression, \u201cIf you don't return, I'll go find you.\u201d\u201cGood.\u201d Lin Xun grinned. His smile seemed more dazzling than usual under the morning sun.Neigh!The scaled horse neighed as it kicked out a cloud of dust and galloped away with Lin Xun.Xia Zhi watched until Lin Xun's figure completely disappeared from sight. Only then did she withdraw her gaze and silently return home, her tiny figure appearing exceptionally lonely.Some of the villagers wanted to invite Xia Zhi to stay with them. After all, with Lin Xun gone, there would be no one to prepare her meals. It was far too heart-wrenching for a little girl to live all alone.However, they were stopped by Xiao Tianren. He shook his head and said, \u201cThere's no need to do so. Xia Zhi is different from others. We only need to keep watch from afar.\u201dThe villagers understood after some thinking. Xia Zhi was very unique and completely different from the other children; even Lin Xun was not her match. Moreover, she gave off a very distant and indifferent aura that made the villagers afraid of approaching her rashly.\u201cWe can only hope that little brother Lin Xun will return as soon as possible.\u201d Xiao Tianren sighed deeply.<sub>This_content is taken from elworld.com</sub>Boundless mountains rose and fell like the earth's spine with rivers and creeks flowing among them. At a glance, all a person could see was the endless wilderness.This was the Three Thousand Great Mountains, located at the Ziyao Empire's southwest border and was also known as heaven's border since ancient times.The Three Thousand Great Mountains was home to numerous sinister and terrifying savage beasts and was filled with countless danger zones. Any ordinary person who stepped into this place would be faced with almost certain death.Rumble~~~The scaled horse galloped across the land, raising clouds of dust from its four hooves. A leather bag that was more than ten-feet-tall sat on the scaled horse's back, weighing at least several hundred pounds.Inside it was many savage beast skins, fur, bones, claws, and other ingredients. The bag also contained aeth herbs and plants which grew deep in the mountains.Of course, the valuable goods were stored in Lin Xun's storage ring\u2014three hundred pounds of Feiyun Fire Copper!These were not ores but pure processed Feiyun Fire Copper that would fetch a shocking price.Lin Xun chose not to rush at full speed. The Three Thousand Great Mountains was far too dangerous, and any negligence might lead to disaster.In addition, it was the first time Lin Xun was journeying to the Qingyang Tribe and he only roughly knew that he should reach his destination in three days if he headed north. The detailed path, however, was a mystery to him.Under such circumstances, Lin Xun naturally intended to practice a little more caution.Fortunately, besides meeting a few ferocious beasts, he did not encounter any danger all the way till noon.The hot sun burned the land, the scaled horse panting heavily under its merciless rays. Lin Xun decided that it was not wise to continue and nudged the horse to slow down. He soon found a lush mountain forest where he dismounted to take a break.He retrieved some jerky to replenish his energy as he made plans for his eventual arrival at the Qingyang Tribe.An incense stick of time later.Lin Xun saw that the scaled horse was rested and ready. He quickly flipped himself back onto the horse to continue their journey.Rumble!The ground violently shook as if there was an earthquake while giant boulders tumbled down a mountain in the distance.Animal cries sounded from the forest, filled with panic and terror.Even the scaled horse below him grew agitated.<sub>The most up-to-date nov_els are published_here > elworld.com</sub>Lin Xun's heart shivered as he felt intense danger. He rapidly scanned the surroundings but he failed to discover anything.What was going on?A beam of dazzling golden light suddenly erupted from an extremely faraway mountain. Amidst the glaring light, Lin Xun could just barely make out what seemed to be a giant golden claw!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

What the hell was that?However, the giant golden claw disappeared a moment later. The golden light vanished, the sky returned to its original blue and the ground stopped shaking.It had been far too sudden. Lin Xun could not fathom why such an astonishing scene had suddenly occurred.Only after regaining his composure did Lin Xun steer the scaled horse forward. However, he was now even more cautious than before.The Three Thousand Great Mountains was full of immeasurable dangers as expected. He had already encountered such a frightening scene less than a thousand miles from Feiyun Village. Lin Xun guessed that it was likely some kind of unimaginable savage beast.After a dozen miles, he found the mountain's remains. Numerous rocks were scattered about, and they ranged from ten thousand pounds to several tens of thousands of pounds.The surrounding area was horrifying. The ground had been scorched black and not even a single blade of grass remained. It was a huge contrast to the lush mountain forest some distance away.One side was abundant with life and flourishing flora, while the other contained only the aura of death and destruction. There was basically nothing here, making the place appear eerie and desolate.Lin Xun recalled that the giant golden claw had risen from somewhere around here. However, he could not ascertain exactly where it had come from.After reaching this location, the scaled horse began to grow restless again. Its legs nervously trembled as if it was about to crumple to the ground.Lin Xun's heart also began to beat faster as the hairs on his body stood on end. He did not dare to stay a moment longer and immediately began to return from the path he had come from, before carefully making a detour around the area.After creating a distance of more than ten miles, Lin Xun's throbbing heart finally calmed down. The scaled horse also returned to its docile and composed self.\u201cHow bizarre.\u201d Lin Xun could not come up with an explanation despite mulling over it for a long time. In the end, he shook his head and continued on his journey.Night began to approach as a river appeared within his sights. Water raged ferociously in the vast river as it rushed through the mountains.The setting sun dyed its waters orange like burning blood, creating a spectacular sight.Lin Xun dismounted and walked to the river bank where he found a safe spot near some rocks. He planned to rest for the night and set off again the next morning.<sub>The latest_epi_sodes are on_the elworld.com website.</sub>He caught two fish from the river, started a bonfire, and began to prepare dinner for himself. The scaled horse was already lazily lying beside the bonfire, snoring in its sleep.The atmosphere was exceptionally silent.Meanwhile, a dozen miles from Lin Xun's location, a group was rushing through the area. They were led by a young man in embroidered clothes, who had narrow eyes, an aquiline nose, and a sinister aura.There were roughly ten experts following him, each one an extraordinary individual. The most prominent among them was an elder in gray clothes. Although he looked shriveled and thin, purple lightning flowed in his eyes and his aura felt oppressive to the extreme like an abyss or a prison.However, the elder's face was somewhat pale, and there was a glaring, horrifying wound on his shoulder. His flesh was mangled, revealing the white bone within.Although the wound was not bleeding, wisps of golden light burned within it, making recovery impossible.\u201cHaha, it's mostly thanks to Elder Xing Teng that we managed to steal the supreme treasure from that animal. When we return, I will definitely tell father to reward you properly!\u201dThe young master suddenly laughed gleefully, sounding very pleased and excited.\u201cYoung master praises me too highly, this old man does not dare to accept.\u201dThe elder in gray forced a smile. From his waxy pale face, the golden flames burning the wound on his shoulder, and his tightly knit brows, anyone could see that he was clearly suppressing the pain.The young man asked in concern, \u201cElder Xing Teng, is your injury really okay?\u201d\u201cAlthough the mythic freckle's true flame is incomparably vicious, I am confident of erasing its power given some time. However, it also causes me to be incapable of flight for the time being and I am ashamed to have delayed my young master's journey as a result.\u201dThe elder in gray, Xing Teng, was extremely respectful and deferential towards the young man.\u201cSome delay is no matter. What's more, we'll likely be found by that animal if we fly. If it pursues us, there will only be endless trouble.\u201dThe young man suddenly recalled something and smiled in a pleased manner again, \u201cElder Xing Teng, do you think this supreme treasure is the treasure mentioned by the stargazing platform's master?\u201dXing Teng thought for a moment and replied, \u201cYoung master, the supreme treasure's origins are fishy and it likely did not belong to that animal. From what I can deduce, you might be correct.\u201dThe young man laughed, \u201cRegardless, this treasure affair has drawn numerous powerful individuals from the Forbidden City, and it could even be called a gathering storm that has drawn the world's attention. But since we're the ones who succeeded in obtaining the treasure, all of them are fated to have wasted their time and effort!\u201dXing Teng frowned and reminded, \u201cYoung master please watch your words. No one else can ever know of this or others might begin to have certain unsavory thoughts.\u201d<sub>Try the elworld.com platform_for the most advanced_reading experience.</sub>The young man nodded repeatedly, \u201cRight, right. Elder Xing Teng is extremely correct.\u201dIciness suddenly flashed in his eyes as he looked over at his other followers, \u201cHave all of you heard what Elder Xing Teng said? No one shall speak of this matter. If I find that it has been leaked, don't blame me for being merciless!\u201dThe followers hurriedly acknowledged.A vast river soon appeared in their sights.Xing Teng suddenly suggested, \u201cYoung master, it's getting late. Shall we rest here and set off again tomorrow?\u201d\u201cSounds good.\u201d The young man agreed after some thought. Xing Teng's cultivation was the highest in their group and he possessed Spirit Sea level fighting power. However, he had received substantial injuries today and since he suggested resting, there was naturally no way the young master could object.\u201cYoung master, there seems to be someone else here!\u201d One of the followers pointed towards the opposite bank of the river, where they could see a bonfire far away.A tense atmosphere immediately enveloped the group. Those who dared to travel in the Three Thousand Great Mountains were definitely no ordinary people.Moreover, there were currently many powerful individuals in the Great Three Thousand Mountains. The situation did not bode well in the off chance they encountered any of these individuals.Xing Teng's eyes scanned the opposite bank, instantly finding several hints that led him to nonchalantly declare, \u201cDon't panic everyone, it's only a True Martial fourth layer youngster.\u201d\u201cOh, then let's go over and take a look.\u201d The young man immediately relaxed and led the group across the river using qigong.Sure enough, it was exactly as Xing Teng had said. They found a thirteen-year-old youngster dressed in a worn hemp garment. Although he looked clean and tidy, he appeared beggarly in the group's eyes.The youngster was naturally Lin Xun, who had also just sensed the other party. When he saw them approach, he could not help but feel shocked and alarmed.If he was not wrong, nearly everyone in the entire party had Spirit Dipper stage cultivation. Wisps of spirit dipper qi diffused from their bodies, showing that they were genuine Spirit Dipper experts.Moreover, there was an old man in gray who gave off an even more terrifying aura!Such a group appearing in the desolate mountains immediately put Lin Xun on full alert.\u201cHeh, it's a little native of the Great Thousand Great Mountains.\u201d The young man chuckled in amusement after doing a quick scan of Lin Xun. Disdain appeared on the young man's face as he waved his hand, \u201cLittle fellow, we're going to rest here for a while. If you have nothing to say then get lost at once. This young master is feeling good today so I shall not make your life difficult.\u201dThe young man's followers laughed.<sub>The most up-to-date nov_els are published_here > elworld.com</sub>The elder frowned but ultimately said nothing. There was no need to be overly concerned over a mere kid.\u201cTha\u2026thank you everyone,\u201d stammered Lin Xun with a terrified appearance. He quickly pulled the scaled horse with him and fled.His fearful appearance made the young man and his group roar with laughter again.\u201cHe truly is a country bumpkin that has never seen much of the world. A single sentence from the young master has made him flee in fear. Hahaha.\u201d One of the followers immediately took the chance to flatter the young man, causing him to laugh as well. \u201cAt least he was smart and knew he would suffer if he didn't leave. Although\u2026he really is too cowardly.\u201d\u201cNo matter how courageous he is, he can only wag his tail and hide when he sees our young master.\u201d The flattery made the young man chuckle gleefully.Only Xing Teng continued to frown, although there was nothing he could do about this. Their young master was the pampered eldest son of the southwest district city governor, Liu Wudiao. However, the young master was extremely domineering and even Xing Teng did not dare to say too much.No one noticed that the anxiously fleeing Lin Xun suddenly stopped a dozen miles away and climbed onto a big tree. His eyes glimmered like cold stars as they were cast towards the riverbank.There was no longer any fear on Lin Xun's now cold and calculating face as his fingers grasped a giant bone-white bow.Lin Xun might have seemed to have fled in terror after being humiliated and chased away, but he was actually furious inside.However, he had no choice. Compared to the group, his current cultivation was really nothing to look at. If he chose to go against them, it would only be akin to smashing an egg into a rock and he would likely lose his life for nothing.\u201cHow unfair\u2026\u201d mumbled Lin Xun. He understood that there was most likely no chance to teach those people a lesson even if he camped here. However, he could not bring himself to just swallow this humiliation and leave.The land and sky in the distance suddenly shook as a dazzling flash of gold soared into the sky, arcing through the darkness.It was the sky-covering claw he had seen previously!Lin Xun's eyes immediately shone as a strange smile rose from the corners of his lips. The claw seemed to have appeared at the riverbank!Misfortune was going to befall those fellows!Lin Xun nearly laughed out loud. The heavens were watching after all.He swiftly jumped off the tree and approached the riverbank like a gust of wind.Lin Xun wanted to see what was going to happen to those guys. At the same time, he was also curious to find out what kind of terrifying creature the giant claw belonged to.<sub>Visit elworld.com, for the best no_vel_read_ing experience</sub>He soon came to a stop once again as shock flooded his face.Lin Xun finally saw an incomparably enormous golden beast swooping down from the darkness like a mountain.

It seemed to gallop through the air like a mythic beast from ancient times, an existence that could cover the moon and sun and part the mountains and rivers with a roar!Even from a far distance, Lin Xun could feel a stabbing pain in his eyes. Every fiber of his being trembled uncontrollably as an oppressive pressure suffocated his soul.The creature resembled a deer but was not a deer, like a horse yet not a horse. It had the head of a dragon, a tail like a flowing rainbow, and was covered in golden fur while intense light seemed to burn from its four hooves.It galloped through the sky, leaving a trail of flowing golden light. Divine flames rolled through the air, sweeping towards the land like a tsunami. Mountains burned and forests were turned to ash, creating a fear-inducing scene of destruction.Its opponent wielded a spear that danced in the sky and shot out frightening spear shadow after shadow. However, he was clearly outmatched and was repeatedly forced to dodge during each exchange.Lin Xun instantly identified the giant creature's opponent. It was the old man in gray from the group he had met earlier.So it is them!A strange smile hung from the corners of Lin Xun's lips. It would be a lie if he said he wasn't gloating.Despite this, the elder's aerial battle power still astonished Lin Xun. The old man was clearly another Spirit Sea expert.Together with Xie Yutang, the brute warrior, and the Stone Cauldron Alm's first young master, Shi Xuan, this was the fourth Spirit Sea expert Lin Xun had seen.From this, it was obvious that many powerful experts had been drawn to the Three Thousand Great Mountains for the so-called 'great treasure'.However, none of this mattered to Lin Xun at the moment. His cultivation was still insignificant to Spirit Sea existences and it was impossible for him to be part of the brewing storm.Lin Xun's attention was soon drawn by the giant golden creature again. Was the old man and his group the ones who elicited the golden claw in the afternoon?But what did they do to make the giant creature so angry?Rumble!The land shook as light rained from the sky like a meteor shower and smashed into the ground. Forests burned, mountains were pushed over, and the ground was turned to scorched earth inch by inch.It was a horrifying sight. Only death awaited anyone who was caught up in it.Lin Xun did not dare to stay a moment longer and immediately turned around to leave.His anger had already been dispelled after ascertaining that disaster had befallen the elder and his group. If he didn't leave now, he would be gambling with his life.Thud!<sub>New_chap_ters are pub_lished on elworld.com</sub>Before Lin Xun had made a mile, he heard the rustle of rushing wind. Soon after, the sound of something heavy hitting the ground was heard from the forest nearby. A groan soon followed.Lin Xun was taken aback. What a familiar voice.He cautiously approached and discovered a bloody figure miserably lying on the ground.Despite this, Lin Xun immediately recognized the figure from his clothes. It was the young master from the earlier group!Lin Xun was overjoyed. It seemed that the heavens were heavily favoring him today. Not only had a giant creature been dispatched to trample over the group to avenge him, but even the main offender had been sent straight to him!Of course, Lin Xun understood that this was merely delusional thinking from him. He turned his head to check that the battle was still ongoing.If Lin Xun was not wrong, the young master had been thrown out of the battlefield by the elder in gray to prevent such an important person from being caught up in the battle and dying.However, the unlucky fellow just had to land right in front of him.\u201cYoung master, we meet once again.\u201dSmiling, Lin Xun walked forward. The other party was heavily injured and was no different from a cripple in spite of his Spirit Dipper stage cultivation.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d The young man struggled to open his eyes. When he finally saw Lin Xun, he yelled, \u201cPeasant! Quickly take me away from here. When I'm safe, I will guarantee you a life of endless riches and glory!\u201dHis hoarse voice was filled with urgency. Towards the end, he even coughed out a few mouthfuls of blood.\u201cYoung master, I don't want glory or riches.\u201d Lin Xun shook his head, still smiling as he said, \u201cSeeing you like this has already satisfied me. Goodbye.\u201dAfter speaking, he turned around to leave.\u201cPlease wait!\u201d The young master called out, \u201cLittle brother, what can I do to make you promise to help me this one time? Say your conditions. I, Liu Yukun, will agree to all of them!Lin Xun turned around. He looked into the young master's desperate eyes and sighed, \u201cYoung Master Liu, you chased me away earlier like a magpie occupying another bird's nest. It's already generous of me to have not killed you. Are you really going to push your luck?\u201dLiu Yukun cried out, \u201cLittle brother, I was at fault earlier and apologize to seek your forgiveness. Please be magnanimous and save me this once.\u201dHe was already begging at this point.Towards the end, he coughed violently and his entire body trembled before going limp on the ground. Even his presence was growing increasingly weak.Lin Xun was silent for a while before he walked forward and said, \u201cFine, there was no major grudge between us anyways. I shall save you this once.\u201dHe bent down and reached out toward Liu Yukun.Swoosh!<sub>You can_find the rest of this_content on the elworld.com platform.</sub>A cold and ruthless glint suddenly flashed in Liu Yukun's eyes as his originally limp body suddenly sprung up. His arm thrust forward, trapping Lin Xun's neck. A short sword appeared in Liu Yukun's hand and was placed at Lin Xun's throat.Liu Yuxun smiled sinisterly, \u201cLittle mongrel! You'd better obediently listen or this sword will take your life!\u201dLin Xun remained still, but there was no trace of panic in his expression. Instead, he smiled and said, \u201cAs I expected. I knew that someone like you would be up to no good even while seeking help.\u201dLiu Yukun coldly said, \u201cWhat are you trying to say?\u201dThud!Lin Xun's shoulder muscles suddenly expanded, releasing a huge ripple force that instantly blew away the arm Liu Yukun had placed on Lin Xun's neck.At the same time, he pulled his head back as his wrist flipped in a strange manner to firmly trap Liu Yukun's arm, before giving it a forceful twist.With a crack, Liu Yukun's arm was dislocated, causing him to lose his grip on the short sword and it fell to the ground.Piak!Lin Xun slapped the other party's face, causing him to cry out in pain. Several teeth had been dislodged and fell from his mouth.\u201cHow is this possible, you\u2026\u201dLiu Yukun was alarmed and frightened. How was it possible for the person he had already subdued to turn the tables on him in an instant?All of this was thanks to the Joint Disruption Art Lin Xun had learned from the battles with Xia Zhi. In close combat situations, this technique was definitely far too enigmatic and near impossible to guard against.Unfortunately for Liu Yukun, he had assumed that Lin Xun was only an ordinary True Martial fourth layer practitioner. As a result, Liu Yukun had only been on guard against Lin Xun's aeth power, completely ignoring the terror of his physical prowess.\u201cYoung Master Liu, I was kind enough to try and save you and this is how you repay me?\u201dLin Xun sighed and picked up the short sword. He pierced Liu Yukun's throat without hesitation, causing blood to spurt out.Lin Xun observed the shock and resentment in the other's eyes and smiled, \u201cYoung Master Liu, although I'm just an unremarkable little peasant, I know how to distinguish between love and hate. Once given the chance, I can also kill scum like you without any hesitation. If you want to blame someone, you can only blame yourself. Isn't that right?\u201dAll Liu Yukun could do was make gurgling noises as he slowly choked on his blood. In the end, he unwillingly collapsed to the ground and died.Lin Xun withdrew his smile and turned his head again to check on the battle. His heart immediately shivered when he realized the battle had already ended at some unknown time.His hands swiftly scoured Liu Yukun's corpse, but only managed to find a purple jade belt.It was likely some kind of storage artifact. Lin Xun did not look at it and hurriedly turned to flee.The scaled horse soon began to gallop away, carrying Lin Xun as they swiftly disappeared into the night.<sub>New novel_chap_ters are published here: elworld.com</sub>He needed to leave as soon as possible!Lin Xun clearly understood that Liu Yukun, who had a Spirit Sea expert bodyguard, absolutely did not have an ordinary identity. As such, his death would most certainly result in a lot of trouble.Roar~~An earth-shaking roar suddenly thundered from far away, alarming and agitating the scaled horse as it neighed in fear.Lin Xun twisted his neck and saw an enormous golden creature roaring in the sky. Its roar was filled with rage.Endless flames poured down in streams, turning the land into a burning hellscape.Too terrifying!Lin Xun secretly rejoiced. If he had left just a little later, he would have been caught up in the destruction and met his end.However, Lin Xun could not ascertain whether the elder and the rest of the group had died in battle.\u201cNo matter what, I need to leave this place as fast as possible.\u201dLin Xun took a deep breath and urged on the agitated and uneasy scaled horse.\u201cGolden flame beast!\u201d\u201cTo think that it's that creature, could it be that\u2026\u201d\u201cHow many years has it been? Who could have expected that a golden flame beast has been hiding in the Three Thousand Great Mountains? It's a variant that has a sliver of the ancient divine beast, fire qilin, bloodline!\u201d\u201cThis place is not simple at all. It seems that we've underestimated the Three Thousand Great Mountains. This is the first time such a creature has been discovered in nearly a thousand years.\u201d\u201cQuickly go over and take a look. The creature's appearance might be related to the prophesized treasure.\u201dMeanwhile, at various areas in the Three Thousand Great Mountains, the golden flame beast's earth-shaking howl drew the attention of the many peak experts that had come searching for the prophesized treasure.The Xie Clan's ninth young master, Little Sword Lord Xie Yutang, the Stone Cauldron Alms' first young master Shi Xuan\u2026It was certainly not going to be a peaceful night for Lin Xun and the many cultivators that had gathered in the Three Thousand Great Mountains.However, Lin Xun would remain unaware that Liu Yukun's burnt corpse would soon be discovered and cause a giant ripple.That was the southwest city governor, Liu Wudiao's, eldest son!Liu Wudiao was a Heaven Ascension stage expert and was well-known in the empire's cultivation world.<sub>Foll_ow current_novel on elworld.com</sub>He was a cold-blooded and heroic military man, who had been stationed at the empire's southwest province for nearly fifty years. He was a famous cultivator with great influence.With Liu Yukun dying in the Three Thousand Great Mountains, how could his father, Liu Wudiao, ever leave this matter alone?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

All four hooves staggered and it crumpled onto the ground, panting heavily.Lin Xun flipped off the horse and stably landed on the ground. He could not help but feel a wave of shame wash over him when he gazed at the profusely sweating scale horse. His single-minded focus on escaping had left the scale horse exhausted, making him feel somewhat indebted to it.\u201cSorry, brother horse.\u201d Lin Xun retrieved some aeth resources and shoved them towards the scale horse, finally smiling a little as he watched it happily chomp down.The scale horse was a ferocious beast, but it became extremely docile after being tamed. It was also absolutely necessary for any future trips between the Qingyang Tribe and Feiyun Village.Lin Xun also found a spot to rest, took out a bottle of aeth-infused water, and gulped a big mouthful. Only then did he retrieve the purple jade sash he had taken from Liu Yukun's corpse.It was a valuable storage artifact. Not only were there numerous elegant runes carved onto its surface, but it also had pearl and jewel fragments embedded all over it. It was definitely more luxurious than the usual high-end product.However, in Lin Xun's opinion, such decorations felt very hollow. If it was him, he would never make his storage artifact so eye-catching because it would only end up drawing the wrong attention.He opened the purple sash, revealing the storage space inside. Lin Xun was surprised to find only a single foot by foot square copper chest in the large space. There was nothing else besides it.Although slightly disappointed, his gaze could not help but be drawn to the copper chest.The chest had an age-old luster and four runes had been inscribed onto its four corners: a cloud rune, a landscape rune, a mythic beast rune, and a sun moon rune. Mysterious rune arrays had also been drawn onto its four sides which gave off cryptic and heart-palpitations auras.\u201cIt seems to be a rune array that specializes in sealing.\u201dSurprise flew across Lin Xun's eyes. Although he could not fully decipher the runes at his current level, he could roughly tell from their auras that they possessed sealing power!Only rune masters could carve rune arrays. Who would invest such a gargantuan effort to carve a specialized sealing rune array on a mere bronze chest?The costs involved would be insane!However, this also told Lin Xun that the bronze chest must have been constructed to seal an extremely valuable treasure.At this thought, Lin Xun's heart stirred. Anyone could tell that Liu Yukun was no ordinary person at a glance, and his group had been frantically pursued by the giant golden beast last night. Could the bronze chest's contents have led to this chase?<sub>Visit elworld.com for a better_reading experience</sub>What was hidden in the bronze chest?Lin Xun continued to inspect the chest and gasped moments later. He had discovered an extremely frightening rune restriction around the chest's lid.A rune restriction was an array used to forbid things, and was something only those called rune grandmasters could set up!A rune grandmaster was a more respected and superior existence than a rune master.Not only did the bronze chest have a specialized sealing array, but there was also a rune restriction around its lid. The value of this chest alone had reached an astronomical number!What kind of treasure was sealed in this bronze chest?Unfortunately, Lin Xun had no way to open it. Let alone him, even a rune grandmaster would be powerless without knowing the true essence of the rune restriction.\u201cNever mind, I can always wait for an opportunity to open it in the future.\u201d After contemplating for a long time, Lin Xun ultimately gave up. He might currently be a little better than a regular rune apprentice, but he was still not a proper rune master. It was a tall order for him to open the box.It was actually rather simple to be acknowledged as a rune master: single-handedly complete a rune array. However, a rune array was not easy to draw. It was very difficult without at least Spirit Dipper stage cultivation.A True Martial stage cultivator just didn't have sufficient aeth power and spirit sense to draw an entire rune array.Of course, this only applied to ordinary cultivators. There were always special existences in this world that surpassed common sense.For example, Lin Xun had once heard a drunk Mister Lu let slip that he was already able to proficiently draw a complete rune array at the True Martial eighth layer, allowing him to become one of the youngest rune masters back then.Since Mister Lu could do it, Lin Xun believed that he could also achieve the same as long as he worked hard.Lin Xun quickly put aside his thoughts and took the bronze chest out of the sash.Thud!He was immediately shocked by the chest's insane weight, which was at least ten thousand pounds. The moment he tried to take it out, it heavily slammed into the ground, creating a slight depression.This only made Lin Xun increasingly certain that some amazing treasure must be sealed in the chest.<sub>Visit elworld.com for a better_user experience</sub>He then shifted the chest into his storage ring without any hesitation and breathed a deep sigh of relief.After resting for two hours, the scale horse recovered its strength. Lin Xun checked their bearings before beginning the journey again.The pair did not encounter any dangers this time. When they passed by a volcano, Lin Xun made a special pitstop to throw the purple jade sash into the churning lava.He would never keep the sash on him and did not touch a single jewel on it. He did this to prevent potential repercussions.Although it was a valuable treasure, it was, after all, something that had belonged to Liu Yukun and might contain some lingering trace of him. If this was somehow discovered by the faction behind him, endless troubles would surely follow.Sunset Plain.This was a plain in the Three Thousand Great Mountains, which was surrounded by mountains on three sides. If a person headed north from the plain, he or she would eventually reach Donglin City, which lay on the Ziyao Empire's southwest border.A river flowed down from the mountain range, snaking through the plain like a jade sash as it irrigated numerous rich aeth fields.The Qingyang Tribe was located on the Sunset Plain.If someone researched the tribe's origins, they would discover that it was originally a tribe of mountain people. However, as the Ziyao Empire expanded its borders, the Qingyang Tribe was colonized and became part of the empire's territory. It was now rare to find any descendants of the original Qingyang Tribe mountain people.Rather than a tribe, it was more apt to call the place a bustling town. It was also a foothold that connected the Ziyao Empire, Donglin City, and the Three Thousand Great Mountains.Most of the beast skins, fur, bones, spirit medicine, aeth resources, and other produce of the Three Thousand Great Mountains would first gather in the Qingyang Tribe before flowing into Donglin City.Due to its unique location, numerous merchant groups from various places in the empire and adventurers would select the Qingyang Tribe as their base of operations.This was how the Qingyang Tribe had reached its current state.In the evening, the setting sun bathed the land in a beautiful glow.A travel-weary scale horse arrived in front of the Qingyang Tribe.<sub>The source of this_chapter; elworld.com</sub>Tall and thick walls were built around the Qingyang Tribe to defend against savage beast attacks from the mountains. There were city gates on the north and south sides of the walls which allowed people to enter and exit.As the scale horse approached, the guards stationed on the two sides of the gates were finally able to see the thirteen-year-old youth in gray clothes and the sack which was as tall as a person.One of the guards walked forward and said, \u201cIt costs three copper coins to enter.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Lin Xun dismounted. Smiling, he retrieved three copper coins and handed them over.The guard nodded and waved his hand to permit Lin Xun entry.The Qingyang Tribe was a messy mix of characters and there were no strict rules or laws. It was akin to a temporary accommodation where new and old faces would appear and disappear every day.No one would be satisfied staying here their whole lives. After all, the Qingyang Tribe in the Three Thousand Great Mountains was a far cry from the flourishing Ziyao Empire. It was too backwater and dangerous; anyone who lived here always had to be on guard for savage beast attacks from the mountain.Lin Xun led the scale horse through the city gates and disappeared into the busy streets.The guard watched Lin Xun leave and suddenly waved his hand to call over a man dressed in black, who had a protruding mouth and cheeks. The guard instructed in a low voice, \u201cGo inform the Wu Corporation manager that Feiyun Village's Lian Rufeng's steed has appeared. Tell him exactly what you saw just now.\u201d\u201cSure.\u201d The man nodded and hurriedly left.\u201cWu Corporation has waited so many days only for a single boy to show up. It seems that he will be the only way they can find out what happened to Wu Henshui.\u201d The guard contemplated for a while before shaking his head. These matters had nothing to do with him. He was only tasked to report some news.Lin Xun was unaware that someone had already taken notice of his entry into the city. He walked along the street, advancing through the busy crowd.There were many people and it was very lively.Strong men dressed in leather were doing manual labor, transporting various goods. Several peddlers were lined up on both sides of the street, selling unique produce from the mountains such as plants, herbs, animal skins, ores, and other similar products.Well-dressed merchants could also be seen from time to time, riding their carriages through the streets. There were also weapon-carrying cultivators hurriedly traveling through the crowds.Row upon row of stone buildings lined both sides of the street: restaurants, medicine stores, weapon shops, inns, merchant associations, brothels\u2026and all kinds of businesses.As the saying went: though the sparrow was small, it still had all its vital organs. Although the Qingyang Tribe was not large by any standards, it definitely won in the busy aspect. Various people moved amongst the crowd, painting a picture of a bustling town.<sub>The latest_epi_sodes are on_the elworld.com website.</sub>This was the first time Lin Xun had entered such a populated place and a mixture of feelings involuntarily surged within him. There was curiosity, amazement, excitement, and many others.Lin Xun had grown up in a prison mine, and the first place he entered in the Ziyao Empire was the poor and remote Feiyun Village. No matter how mature he was, Lin Xun was still a thirteen-year-old boy. As such, the vibrance and hecticness of the town overwhelmed him for a time.If a mere Qingyang Tribe was already this lively, what kind of grand sight awaited him if he were to enter one of the Ziyao Empire's cities?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

An experienced veteran would only need a single glance to identify what was hidden within it. A few sniffs would tell anyone the quality of the items and their value.In addition, he appeared to be all alone, which naturally made him seem like an easy target.A disturbance suddenly spread in the distance, drawing many people's attention. When Lin Xun arrived, he saw a man in leather clothes fail to avoid a fatal swing from a cultivator. The man's head was lopped off, causing blood to spurt out from his neck.Instead of panicking, the watching crowd cheered as if wishing there was more action.\u201cHow dare you steal from me. You're basically asking for death! Puih!\u201d The cultivator kept his blade and viciously glared at the corpse before swaggering away.This was murder on the street!However, no one moved to stop it. Evidently, the people here were already accustomed to such things.Two figures, who looked like guards, soon arrived and hurriedly cleaned up the mess. The street quickly returned to its usual busy atmosphere as if the earlier murder had never happened before.Lin Xun could not help but narrow his eyes. He could already tell that there were no laws in the Qingyang Tribe. Strong martial force was definitely one of the necessary conditions to establish a foothold here.It did not take long for him to come across another two people who seemed to be fighting over some goods. However, they were soon stopped by a cultivator. The cultivator's method was very simple and violent: kill the two individuals which instantly resolved the dispute while also working to intimidate the crowd.There is always murky darkness hidden under the vibrance of a place.Lin Xun suddenly recalled what a prisoner had said in the mine prison, which he had been too young to comprehend back then.As he moved through the Qingyang Tribe and observed the many hidden greedy gazes amidst the bustling atmosphere, Lin Xun instantly understood the true meaning of the prisoner's words.However, Lin Xun was not afraid. After observing the crowds so far, he was quite certain that there were far fewer cultivators than ordinary folk. In addition, most of them were at the True Martial stage, and he would rarely catch sight of Spirit Dipper stage cultivators.If someone was ballsy enough to have designs on his merchandise, Lin Xun did not mind giving them a memorable lesson.Regretfully, Lin Xun's luck seemed to be pretty good today. Although he felt several avaricious gazes, no one came forward to cause trouble.The sky soon darkened as night descended.Lin Xun found himself standing in front of a building called the Old Crow Inn. He tossed two copper coins to an attendant to let him take care of the scale horse before stepping into the inn. Lin Xun planned on heading to the Stone Cauldron Alms branch the next morning to exchange his wares.<sub>Updated_at elworld.com</sub>There were numerous tables in the inn and it was exceptionally busy at this time. Many figures were reveling in their food and drink and conversing in loud voices, making the place extremely noisy.The owner was a one-eyed giant of a man. He had a scary face and was currently lazily enjoying his alcohol.Several pairs of eyes in the tavern brightened at Lin Xun's entry, their gazes darting towards the giant leather sack in his hands.Greed began gleaming in their eyes when they did a double take on Lin Xun.However, there was also a portion who tactfully withdrew their eyes. This was a thirteen-year-old boy who dared to appear alone with a hundred-pound sack despite how attention-drawing it would be. Any half-wit could guess that he was certainly no pushover.The one-eyed man behind the counter nonchalantly asked, \u201cLooking for lodging?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Lin Xun smiled and nodded.\u201cTwenty copper coins a night.\u201d The one-eyed man glanced at Lin Xun, his words immediately drawing unrestrained laughter from the room.\u201cOne-eyed Dragon, have you started slaughtering guests again? Don't you remember how you lost your eye?\u201dThe one-eyed man ignored the laughter. He only stared at Lin Xun without explaining anything.\u201cAlright.\u201d Lin Xun retrieved twenty copper coins and passed them over, \u201cWhere's the room?\u201d\u201cThat room is yours tonight.\u201d The one-eyed man pointed at the corner of the second floor before resuming his drinking.Lin Xun smiled, \u201cThank you.\u201dHe turned around, picked up his sack, and walked up the stairs.As Lin Xun headed towards the room, a half-drunk fatty suddenly walked to the counter, \u201cWhat a rare little fat sheep. He has many nice things on him which are at least worth this much.\u201dHe extended four fingers and wiggled them in front of the one-eyed man.The one-eyed man seemed unconcerned and continued to focus on his alcohol. After a long time, he finally glanced at the fatty and said, \u201cFatty Xiao, it's been roughly six years since you've come to the Qingyang Tribe, right? Do you plan on staying here your whole life?\u201dFatty Xiao's expression abruptly changed, \u201cWhat are you trying to say?\u201dThe one-eyed man sighed, \u201cHeed my advice and forget this matter. That young man is not someone you should mess with.\u201dAfter some consideration, he added in another sentence, \u201cNo, he's definitely someone you should not mess with at all.\u201d<sub>New novel_chap_ters are published here: elworld.com</sub>Fatty Xiao's expressions rapidly fluctuated. A long time later, he smiled bitterly and said, \u201cI understand.\u201dHe then turned around and left.The one-eyed man narrowed his eyes as he watched Fatty Xiao walk out of the inn. He had already said what he could, whether or not the fatty listened was not his business.The old-eyed man picked up his cup. He stared at the rippling amber liquid and mumbled, \u201cIt hasn't been peaceful recently\u2026\u201dMeanwhile, at the Wu Corporation.As one of the leading merchant groups in the Qingyang Tribe, the Wu Corporation was known to be a rich and overbearing faction with solid foundations. The boss of the corporation was said to be one of Donglin City's influential figures.Amidst the darkness of the night, the Wu Corporation rear hall was brightly lit.Wu Deyong silently sat in the head's chair with a stormy face.He was the chief manager who had been dispatched to the Qingyang Tribe to oversee the Wu Corporation for the past four years and was currently in his prime. He hailed from the Dongling City Wu Clan, possessed True Martial seventh layer cultivation, and was well-known in the Qingyang Tribe.The corporation managers sat below Wu Deyong. All of them were silent, not daring to make even the tiniest noise.\u201cThree days have passed since the deadline given by Chief Steward Wu Henshui, but not a single piece of news has been sent back. May I ask about everyone's thoughts on this matter?\u201d Wu Deyong's deep voice broke the stifling atmosphere in the hall.A person cautiously answered, \u201cFeiyun Village is more than two thousand miles away. The chief steward might have met with some delays.\u201dWu Deyong icily said, \u201cHumph! Even if he encountered some delays, someone as meticulous as the chief steward would have sent a subordinate back here to report. However, there has been zero news till now. Do you feel that this is normal?\u201dAnother person could not help but ask, \u201cChief Manager, do you think that something has happened to the chief steward?\u201dWu Deyong was silent, his expression dark and stormy. That was precisely what he was thinking.At this moment, a servant rushed into the hall and reported, \u201cReporting to the managers, the city guard has informed us that they saw a youngster riding Lian Rufeng's scale horse in the evening, and he has already entered the Qingyang Tribe.Wu Deyong's eyes immediately brightened at these words. He remembered Lian Rufeng; he was the Feiyun Village's guard leader.Wu Deyong asked, \u201cWhere is that youngster now?\u201dThe servant swiftly replied, \u201cAccording to our informants, the youngster is lodging at the Old Crow Inn.\u201d<sub>Updated_at elworld.com</sub>One of the men in the hall frowned and said, \u201cSomething is amiss. If the youngster was dispatched by the chief steward, he should have headed straight to the Wu Corporation. However, he instead went to the Old Crow Inn. There's clearly something fishy about this.\u201dWu Deyong's eyes flickered in thought. After some consideration, he waved his hand and commanded, \u201cSend a few of our men to the Old Crow Inn and bring back the youngster at any cost!\u201dThe servant immediately accepted the order and left to give instructions.Wu Deyong pondered for a while before he changed the topic, addressing the managers present, \u201cEveryone, the Three Thousand Great Mountains have not been peaceful recently, and numerous powerful figures from the empire have gathered here. Make sure to be extra careful over this period and don't cause any problems. Otherwise, even I won't be able to save you!\u201dThe group solemnly nodded.They naturally understood the importance of this matter. Many unfamiliar faces had arrived in the Qingyang Tribe recently, with several extremely powerful and noble figures among them. In such circumstances, local powerhouses like them had no choice but to keep their heads down for the time being.Wu Deyong waved his hand, \u201cAlright, dismissed. When the youngster is brought back, I will find out what happened and inform everyone.\u201dSince they now had a lead, there was naturally no need for everyone to be gathered.Most importantly, Wu Deyong was certain that dispatching a few men would easily deal with a mere youngster from Feiyun Village.The second-floor room of the Old Crow Inn.Lin Xun immediately began inspecting the room after entering. After making sure that there was nothing suspicious, he threw the leather bag into his storage ring.He had to show the bag outside as a cover for his storage artifact. Since there was now no one else present, it was no longer necessary.He would take out the bag again when he left the inn.Lin Xun crossed his legs on the bed and fell into thought.I wonder if the Wu Corporation has noticed that I rode Lian Rufeng's scale horse into the Qingyang Tribe. No matter, this problem will have to be resolved sooner or later.He knew that the Wu Corporation would not let him off due to Wu Henshui's death. Rather than give them the initiative and allow them to head to Feiyun Village, he would prefer to settle the issue here in the Qingyang Tribe.This was why Lin Xun had so openly rode Lian Rufeng's steed into the Qingyang Tribe. I hoped to draw all of the Wu Corporation's attention.Although it was a dangerous move, Lin Xun had his own plans and did not feel nervous.While he was contemplating this matter, a few men in gray walked into the Old Crow Inn.<sub>The most up-to-date nov_els are published_here > elworld.com</sub>Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 54": "Chapter 54\nJun 11, 2022Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 54 Mad Dog Wu JieThe one-eyed man behind the counter narrowed his eyes when the group of five entered the Old Crow Inn. A flash of nearly undetectable resentment flitted across his eyes as he looked towards a certain young man.The young man looked slim and capable. He had a pair of long and narrow eyes, wore a leather robe, and gave off a prideful but sinister aura.The one-eyed man said in a low voice, \u201cWu Jie, what do you want?\u201dThe noisy atmosphere in the hall instantly fell silent; the guests fidgeted uncomfortably as if they were afraid of the young man called Wu Jie.Mad Dog Wu Jie was a well-known individual in the Qingyang Tribe. He was a cruel, blood-thirsty, and crazy man who was backed by the Wu Corporation.At least a hundred people had lost their lives to Wu Jie over the years, and he had offended far more. He could only live so freely because of his backer, the Wu Corporation.For example, the Old Crow Inn's boss, One-eyed Giant, had his eye dug out by Wu Jie two years ago!Wu Jie giggled and said, \u201cOld One-eye, you'd better obediently sit there. I'm only here to take someone away.\u201dHe turned his head towards one of his companions and asked, \u201cWhich room is the kid in?\u201d\u201cSecond floor, southwest corner!\u201d\u201cGo.\u201d Wu Jie placed his hands behind his back and leisurely walked toward the second floor.The one-eyed man's expression fluctuated indeterminately as he watched the group swagger past him. In the end, he restrained himself and did not say anything.The one-eyed man soon recalled something, causing him to suddenly jerk his head upwards as the image of a gentle-looking youngster appeared in his head.It seems that the youngster is not ordinary after all. However, offending the Mad Dog Wu Jie will likely be the end of the road for him.The one-eyed man downed a cup of alcohol as he sighed inwardly.Mad Dog Wu Jie's cultivation was at the True Martial fourth layer. Although such strength was not considered top-tier in the Qingyang Tribe, he had the backing of the Wu Corporation. He also made sure to only kill ordinary folk and never offend anyone he could not afford to. As such, no one could do anything about him.The guests in the tavern also realized that Mad Dog Wu Jie seemed to be after the unfamiliar youngster, causing them to break out into whispers.\u201cFrom what I can see, it's the youngster's first time in the Qingyang Tribe, and that giant sack he carried was clearly filled with valuable goods. What a pity, he's dead for sure now that he's being targeted by the infamous Mad Dog.\u201d<sub>Visit elworld.com for a better_reading experience</sub>\u201cA pity? You're referring to yourself, right? I saw that you couldn't stop thinking about that little fat sheep earlier and was constantly on the lookout for an opportunity to act!\u201d\u201cHumph! Don't point your finger at me, look at the others in the tavern. Who wasn't thinking about that little fat sheep?\u201dVarious expressions could be seen in the crowd, but the majority were regretful. They did not feel bad for Lin Xun but instead found it a pity that the little fat sheep was going to be eaten by a mad dog.Amidst the discussions, the second floor southwest corner room door was opened. Wu Jie and his group entered and closed the door, stopping anyone from seeing what was going on inside.\u201cFatty Xiao, why have you come back?\u201d The one-eyed man suddenly caught sight of Fatty Xiao returning with four others.When the one-eyed man was finally able to make out their appearances, he couldn't help but display a strange expression. These four individuals were known to be vicious, dangerous and cruel characters in the Qingyang Tribe.However, they were a far cry compared to Mad Dog Wu Jie.Fatty Xiao grinned in a pleased manner and explained in a hushed voice, \u201cAfter thinking about it, I couldn't just let such a fat sheep pass by without trying to take a bite. Hence, I invited some friends over to help out.\u201dThe one-eyed man chuckled, \u201cYou're late, someone else has already swooped in.\u201dFatty Xiao's expression changed, \u201cWhich disrespectful bastard?\u201dBefore the one-eyed man could reply, they all heard a loud thump. The second floor southwest corner room door flung open as a shadowy figure was thrown out. The figure crashed into one of the tables, shattering the cups, plates, wine pot, and even the entire table itself. The drunkards at the table jumped back in shock, nearly falling to the ground.Numerous shrieks rang out as the place descended into chaos.The figure was one of Mad Dog Wu Jie's subordinates. However, his neck had been twisted, turning him into a corpse whose eyes were still filled with fear and panic.The entire tavern fell deathly silent.That's Wu Jie's subordinate!Fatty Xiao's expression changed drastically, finally realizing who had beaten him to the punch. However, he would never have foreseen that he would be seeing the corpse of someone else instead of that little fat sheep!The one-eyed man was utterly shocked and could not help but look toward the second floor.Thud!Another body was thrown downstairs and was revealed to be another of Wu Jie's lackeys. Several people shrieked in alarm as everyone's expressions changed.<sub>Try the elworld.com platform_for the most advanced_reading experience.</sub>The second person had died an even more grisly death. His arms had been twisted together like twisted bread and his chest was caved in as if a bull had viciously trampled over him. It was a miserable sight.Fatty Xiao's face twitched violently as he gasped. He finally realized how right the one-eyed man's warning had been. That youngster was no sheep but a ferocious wolf in sheep skin!Fatty Xiao could not help but ask, \u201cIs Wu Jie also up there?\u201dStill in shock, the one-eyed man numbly nodded. It was definitely not normal to kill two of Wu Jie's underlings in succession while he was present.Thud! Thud!Two figures were soon thrown down again. One had his head split open with his blood and brain juices still spurting out. The other's throat had been cut; blood gurgled out, quickly creating a pool of blood on the ground.The guests' bodies trembled uncontrollably at the gruesome and bloody sight, and the greed originally in their hearts vanished completely.This is too horrifying!Despite the obvious results, not even a single sound of battle had been heard from start to end. Mad Dog Wu Jie's four underlings had been turned into corpses and thrown out. This was a feat that no ordinary person could possibly achieve.Although they were horrified, not a single person left. Everyone turned towards the second floor southwest corner room one by one as if waiting for something.The one-eyed man was no exception. Mad Dog Wu Jie and the boy should be the only ones left in the room. Everyone wanted to know: who was ultimately going to lose this clash?As for Fatty Xiao and his group, they had long been scared silly. They were also secretly glad that Mad Dog Wu Jie had beaten them to the punch. If it had been them instead, they would now be cold corpses on the ground.No more bodies were thrown out. As the crowd grew increasingly uneasy and anxious, they finally saw a young figure walk out of the room.He was dressed in simple gray clothes, with his long hair casually tied up behind him. He had a good-looking and friendly face, black and clear eyes, and a straight raised nose. There was a hint of immaturity between his brows which was unique to young people, while a slight smile hung from the corners of his lips. All of this paired with his thin figure made him look completely harmless.A huge sack had been slung over his shoulder while a bloody bag hung from his hand. Pearls of blood oozed out from its surface and dripped on the ground, creating a strangely horrifying sight.There was no need to guess. The youth was Lin Xun and the bag in his hand contained a human head.The entire tavern was so silent that you could even hear a needle drop on the ground. The only sound was that of Lin Xun's unhurried footsteps.The one-eyed man's hand trembled, spilling the alcohol in his cup. However, he was oblivious because his heart was drowning in shock.Although he had already determined that Lin Xun was no ordinary person, the one-eyed man had not expected Mad Dog Wu Jie to die at Lin Xun's hands!<sub>Visit elworld.com for a better_reading experience</sub>Fatty Xiao, his group of four, and the other patrons of the tavern were dumbstruck as unconcealable fear flowed out in their eyes.There were many formidable individuals in the Qingyang Tribe. If a person was not strong, it was impossible to survive in this lawless place.That was precisely why after witnessing Lin Xun's swiftly massacre Wu Jie and his lackeys, everyone present understood that there was a new person in the Qingyang Tribe to look out for, one who was far more formidable than the norm.Lin Xun arrived at the counter and smiled helplessly, \u201cBoss, I'll have to return the room.\u201dThe one-eyed man's entire body shivered. He immediately retrieved twenty copper coins and passed them over, \u201cThis is the room fee.\u201dLin Xun took fifteen, leaving five behind, \u201cThere were some accidents today which destroyed quite a few things in the tavern. Take the money on the corpses as compensation.\u201dSoon after, Lin Xun thoughtfully looked at Fatty Xiao and chuckled, \u201cBrother, you've wet your pants.\u201dFatty Xiao was taken aback and instinctively looked down, finding warm liquid flowing down his legs and a puddle at his feet. His face burned with embarrassment, and he wished he could hide in a hole.Lin Xun left and the stifling atmosphere in the tavern swiftly dissipated. The crowd quickly noticed Fatty Xiao's embarrassing situation which caused them to burst into laughter. Fatty Xiao actually wet himself in fear!The one-eyed man, on the other hand, had no smile on his face. He knew that since Mad Dog Wu Jie and his lackeys had been murdered, it would not take long to incite the Wu Corporation's wrath. The consequences were dire!\u201cI can only hope that youngster can somehow turn this perilous situation around.\u201d The one-eyed man sighed. Lin Xun's act of killing Wu Jie was equivalent to avenging the one-eyed man. As such, he naturally did not wish for Lin Xun to be destroyed by the Wu Corporation.Unfortunately, the one-eyed man understood that the youngster would likely not live the night given the Wu Corporation's influence in the Qingyang Tribe.I did not expect them to be so impatient and act tonight. It seems that I'll need to change my plan and head to the Stone Cauldron Alms tonight. Lin Xun thought as he led the scale horse through the street.Killing Mad Dog Wu Jie had essentially focused all of the hatred on himself. However, this was precisely what Lin Xun wanted to see.Grievances must be avenged and debts must be paid. Since Wu Henshui did not care about the Feiyun villagers' survival and sought to take everything from them, there was already no room for mediation.Lin Xun would not sit by and watch the Wu Corporation unleash its rage on the Feiyun villagers due to Wu Henshui's death.However, Lin Xun did not expect the other party to act so quickly, leaving him no choice but to make last-minute adjustments to his plans.He knew that Wu Corporation would quickly find out about Mad Dog Wu Jie's murder the moment he left the Old Crow Inn.<sub>Visit to elworld.com discover_new novels.</sub>Hence, he needed to settle this affair tonight or he would be in danger.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Although it was not as busy as the day, there were still numerous people passing through the streets.Stone Cauldron Alms was located in the Qingyang Tribe's central district and occupied more than two hectares of land. Constructed from cut limestone blocks, the majestic building was three stories tall. It towered over the nearby buildings, making it particularly attention-grabbing.When Lin Xun arrived, contrary to his expectations, he found the entrance rather busy as the store wasn't closed. Numerous carriages were parked nearby and several cultivators could be seen entering and exiting.Lin Xun tied the scale horse to a corner and walked into Stone Cauldron Alms with his giant leather sack.The building's interior was luxuriously designed and very spacious. Row after row of white stone exhibits stretched into the distance, and the place was divided into various sections such as medicines, ingredients, weapons, equipment, and other cultivation necessities.Many attendants shuttled between the visitors in a respectful and professional manner.There were also several guards scattered throughout the premises, calmly breathing as their sharp eyes vigilantly watched the surroundings. Their cultivation ranged between the True Martial fourth layer and sixth layer. An elder seated behind a counter in the hall stood out the most; a faint but oppressive dipper qi flowed around his body, showing that he was a Spirit Dipper stage existence!This only emphasized the Stone Cauldron Alms' foundations and how formidable they were.Lin Xun silently took everything in as he inwardly sighed in amazement. He did not know that Stone Cauldron Alms was considered a first-class merchant group even in the Ziyao Empire, nor was he aware that its boss was a legendary figure known as Fortune God Shi.However, from the many details Lin Xun had gleaned, he could tell that Stone Cauldron Alms was no ordinary merchant group.An attendant soon approached and after some inquiries, brought Lin Xun to an exchange section. The section was comparatively empty and there were only a dozen figures scattered about the place.\u201cMay I ask what the young master wishes to sell?\u201d A middle-aged man in an embroidered gown stepped forward with a smile. He did not look down on Lin Xun or brush him off due to his age. However, the middle-aged man was also not very friendly, only showing courtesy where he needed to like a professional.Lin Xun smiled and said, \u201cI want to see your manager.\u201dThe middle-aged man frowned, \u201cApologies, the manager is busy at the moment and can't come out to meet with the young master.\u201dA thirteen-year-old boy who was wearing simple hemp clothes wanted to see their manager? This felt a little too arrogant and ignorant. Did the boy think just anyone could easily meet a Stone Cauldron Alms manager?\u201cOh, that's fine. I can wait.\u201d Lin Xun casually said as if he was oblivious to the change in the middle-aged man's attitude.The middle-aged man's frown grew deeper and his attitude became colder, \u201cYoung master, may I enquire what kind of rare treasures you have that require our manager to come personally?\u201dLin Xun chuckled, \u201cYou feel that I don't have the qualifications to meet your manager?\u201dThe middle-aged man indifferently replied, \u201cHow would I dare to. I merely feel that the young master's goods aren't that valuable. If you wish to sell them, there's no need for our manager to come personally.\u201d<sub>New novel_chap_ters are published here: elworld.com</sub>As he spoke, he pridefully pointed at Lin Xun's large sack, \u201cIf my observation is correct, your bag contains thirty-one pieces of savage beast skin, some bones, claws, and other similar articles. There are also a dozen types of aeth resources, am I right?\u201dSurprised, Lin Xun said, \u201cGood eye!\u201dThe middle-aged man nonchalantly said, \u201cYoung master, those in our line of work have excellent eyes and sharp noses. You might feel these goods have high value, but in our Stone Cauldron Alms' eyes, these goods will only add up to four thousand copper coins, an amount that could buy an ordinary aeth tool.\u201dAfter a slight pause, he continued, \u201cSo have you changed your mind young master?\u201dLin Xun shook his head, \u201cI feel that it will still be best for you to notify your manager. It's not that I don't believe you, but I have another matter to discuss with him.\u201dUpon seeing that the youngster appeared completely unteachable despite his patient explanation, the middle-aged man immediately became unhappy. With an icy snort, he said, \u201cPlease leave, we will not be sending you off!\u201dThis was essentially chasing Lin Xun away.Lin Xun was taken aback. He helplessly said, \u201cUncle, I don't know why you must become so angry, but isn't it a little too petty of you to do this?\u201dThe middle-aged man in embroidered robes laughed in anger, \u201cA mere youngster dares to call me petty?\u201dThere was now a certain intensity in his voice.Lin Xun smiled, \u201cI just think that you can try to inform the manager first. If it turns out that I was really here to cause trouble, you guys can chase me out then. Isn't that right?\u201dThe middle-aged man was clearly out of patience. He ignored the proposal and waved his hand, \u201cSomeone come and escort this young master out!\u201dTwo cultivators, who were stationed nearby, immediately began walking toward them.Lin Xun felt helpless. He had already expressed his sincerity and did not expect the other party to completely ignore his request.Lin Xun sighed, \u201cUncle, I feel that you'll definitely regret this.\u201dThe middle-aged man's expression darkened and he raised his voice, \u201cWhat are you waiting for? Throw this arrogant brat out!\u201dThe two cultivators exchanged a look before abruptly lunging at Lin Xun from the left and right, their arms reaching out to grab him.Thump!Although they were fast, Lin Xun was faster. He suddenly stepped forward, hooked his arm around the middle-aged neck, and shouted, \u201cI'll snap his neck if anyone dares to try anything!\u201dThe two cultivators immediately hesitated.<sub>For more_novel, visit elworld.com</sub>Despite being taken hostage, the middle-aged man was unafraid. Instead, he angrily roared, \u201cSomeone has come to cause trouble in our Stone Cauldron Alms!\u201dAn uproar swept through the neighboring sections as numerous guards began to rush over. They surrounded Lin Xun, but no one dared to approach because of the hostage.\u201cYoung man, this old man advises you to stop now and don't make things worse for yourself!\u201d An elder split the crowd and approached. It was the Spirit Dipper cultivator, who had been stationed in the main hall.Lin Xun's expression remained composed. He even chuckled and said, \u201cWill you believe me if I said this was a misunderstanding?\u201dThe elder was clearly taken aback, \u201cEh? What misunderstanding, let us hear about it.\u201dThe middle-aged man swiftly cut in, \u201cThis punk only had some lousy goods but he wanted the manager to come out and meet him. Is this not trying to cause trouble?\u201dThe elder's eyes scanned the giant sack beside Lin Xun and frostily said, \u201cYoung man, is this the misunderstanding you were referring to?\u201dLin Xun earnestly said, \u201cIs wishing to meet your manager trying to cause trouble?\u201dThe elder was stunned. \u201cRegardless, let him go first.\u201dLin Xun shook his head, \u201cI cannot agree unless your manager comes.\u201dMurder flashed in the elder's eyes, \u201cIt seems that you're determined to reject my kind intentions?\u201dLin Xun smiled, \u201cApologies old uncle, I'm not the type to be scared by threats.\u201dHis fingers tightened around the middle-aged man's throat, choking him till his face turned red. The threat was clear.The middle-aged man urgently shouted, \u201cNo need to care about me, kill this punk!\u201dA stern and dignified voice rang out, \u201cMaking such a din, aren't all of you ashamed of yourselves?\u201dThe manager is here!Respect immediately appeared on everyone's faces, and even the elder was quiet.\u201cIt seems that there's really no way to meet the manager without creating a big enough commotion\u2026\u201d Lin Xun muttered to himself before looking in the direction the voice had come from.He saw a man in a long navy-blue gown approaching. He had a mustache that pointed downwards and a beard, forming the shape of a trident. His face was scholarly and there was a certain dignity in every movement he made.This was the Stone Cauldron Alms manager, Yan Zhen.<sub>The source of this_chapter; elworld.com</sub>\u201cYoung man, let him go.\u201d When Yan Zhen appeared, he indifferently said, \u201cI will give you an opportunity to explain.\u201d\u201cThat works.\u201d Lin Xun understood when to back down and released his hostage, making it seem as if he was not the least bit worried he would be killed immediately without one.This surprised Yan Zhen. He waved his hand to tell everyone to withdraw before he said, \u201cI hope your explanation will not disappoint me.\u201dLin Xun chuckled. Instead of explaining, he tossed the manager a token, \u201cHave a look.\u201dYan Zhen frowned but his eyes immediately widened when he saw the token. An almost unnoticeable change occurred in his expression as he asked, \u201cWhere did you get this token?\u201dThe nearby crowd was stunned. Did the token have some kind of astonishing origins?Lin Xun's reply was simple, \u201cIt was a gift.\u201dYan Zhen was silent for a long time. He suddenly took a deep breath as sternness flashed in his eyes, \u201cA gift? Do you think I'll believe that? This token is not something a youngster like you can possess! Quickly tell me the truth or I will no longer be so civil!\u201dYan Zhen was certain that the token was real because the unique symbol on it could not be faked. However, he did not believe this token would be given to a mere teenager.Evidently, Yan Zhen already viewed Lin Xun as a despicable scammer.Lin Xun could not help but feel somewhat angry. First, the middle-aged man had declared he had no right to see the manager and had come here to cause trouble. When Lin Xun was finally able to meet the manager, the other party suspected him of being a swindler. How could Lin Xun possibly remain composed?Despite this, he maintained his smile and sighed, \u201cIt seems that Shi Xuan lied. His token is completely useless.\u201dShi Xuan!That's the First Young Master's name!Yan Zhen's expression changed slightly again and he began to doubt himself, \u201cYoung man, did the First Young Master send you?\u201dEveryone present was also shocked. This shabby boy knew their First Young Master Shi Xuan?Impossible!He must be trying to trick them!Who was their First Young Master? How could he possibly be friends with a poor youngster?Lin Xun was speechless. Did he look like some kind of messenger boy in their eyes?<sub>You can_find the rest of this_content on the elworld.com platform.</sub>Although they were not looking down on him, they clearly were not treating him seriously!However, Lin Xun could understand their perspective. There were many people like this in the world and it was not something he would get angry about.Lin Xun fell silent for a moment.

Could it merely be to witness the uniqueness of the Ruling Sword Art?Or perhaps the First Young Master believed that Xie Yutang had already found the prophesized treasure?Regardless, it was something Mu Wansu needed to do. It had already been two days since she arrived in the Qingyang Tribe, but she had yet to find any news about Xie Yutang.This made Mu Wansu feel rather helpless. It was almost impossible to even catch a glimpse of someone like Xie Yutang, so how could it possibly be easy to find news about him?Fortunately, Mu Wansu received news tonight that a golden flame beast had appeared at a river that was a thousand miles from the Qingyang Tribe. Such a creature had never appeared in the past hundred years and was likely related to the prophesized treasure.Moreover, the empire's southwest city governor's first son, Liu Yukun, had lost his life to the beast!This was an astonishing piece of news that could create giant waves.Mu Wansu had already decided to go searching for the golden flame beast's whereabouts the next morning.However, before she could discuss some matters with the Stone Cauldron Alms manager, Yan Zhen, as she had originally planned, Mu Wansu was surprised to find a certain hateful, shameless, and despicable youngster had appeared!Mu Wansu had been watching from afar. At the sight of Lin Xun being suspected by Yan Zhen and surrounded like a lamb waiting for slaughter, Mu Wansu suddenly felt an unexplainable surge of glee.Little bastard, to think this day had finally come for you.Mu Wansu could not wait for Yan Zhen to teach the shameless youngster a lesson on behalf of her.The moment this thought appeared, however, she noticed the little bastard looking toward her.<sub>Visit elworld.com, for the best no_vel_read_ing experience</sub>Mu Wansu's heart jumped and she quickly tried moving out of sight, but it was already too late.The little bastard's face practically lit up as he waved his hand and called out, \u201cBig Sister Wansu, your timing is great. Quick come and tell them about the token. Big Brother Shi Xuan never said that taking this token into the Stone Cauldron Alms would make them treat me so coldly.\u201dMu Wansu was speechless as she placed a hand on her forehead. To think that he would so shamelessly call out to her in such an intimate manner. Others might actually believe that they were well acquainted!She really wanted to pretend she did not know him and leave. However, when she thought about how the token was indeed a gift from First Young Master Shi Xuan, she knew that she would not be able to explain this if he were to somehow find out.What should I do?Mu Wansu hesitated. If possible, she really wanted to go over and yank that little bastard's ear. This is far too infuriating. Why does he look so righteous when he is the one asking for help?!Another wave of confusion washed over Yan Zhen and the others as they looked around only to immediately catch sight of Mu Wansu.She was dressed in a black dress and her beautiful hair was tied up in a bun. She had pretty and delicate features, an excellent figure, and a pair of straight black brows that gave off a fierce and sharp aura. She resembled a wild rose blossoming on a cliff, beautiful but thorny.Yan Zhen's pupils abruptly shrank as he stammered, \u201cMiss Wansu, do you\u2026know this young man?\u201dThe others were also doubtful.Mu Wansu sighed inwardly. She could only walk over and try to downplay as much as possible, \u201cThis token was indeed given by the First Young Master.\u201dShe did not answer directly but the meaning behind her words was obvious.All of Yan Zhen's doubts disappeared in an instant. Mu Wansu was the person in charge of the Donglin City Stone Cauldron Alms branch, and even Yan Zhen was far below her in status.Most importantly, Yan Zhen was well aware that Mu Wansu had been helping the First Young Master with some matters over the past few days. How could she possibly be lying?It seemed that they had wrongly accused this youngster.With such thoughts in mind, Yan Zhen's gaze changed when he looked toward Lin Xun again. He did not know why their First Young Master would give such an important token to the young man, but since he had done so, there must definitely be a reason.The expression of the middle-aged man in an embroidered gown rapidly fluctuated. This youngster is the First Young Master's friend? If the First Young Master found out what happened today\u2026He did not dare to complete the thought.The middle-aged man felt regretful. His earlier actions did seem a little too rude, but how could he have known that this shabby-looking youngster would have such an astonishing relationship?<sub>The most up-to-date nov_els are published_here > elworld.com</sub>The middle-aged man suddenly noticed Lin Xun turn around and look at him, causing his heart to jump in his chest; he was under the impression that Lin Xun was preparing to take revenge.Who could have imagined that Lin Xun would cup his fists together in apology, \u201cI was too rash earlier and was indeed the one at fault. Sorry uncle, I hope that you can forgive me.\u201dThe middle-aged man was stunned and instinctively replied, \u201cNo matter, no matter. It was merely a misunderstanding earlier. The young master need not concern himself over it.\u201dLin Xun smiled and did not say anything else.Upon seeing this, Yan Zhen waved his hand and said, \u201cAll of you are dismissed.\u201dAs he spoke, he led Lin Xun and Mu Wansu along a long corridor that ended at an elegant room where everyone quickly took a seat.\u201cMay I ask for the young master's name?\u201d Yan Zhen's attitude had become proper and friendly. His scholarly appearance with his gentle tone paired with his perpetually smiling face was akin to a spring breeze.\u201cElder is too courteous. This junior's surname is Lin and my name is Xun.\u201d Lin Xun smiled and cupped his hands together.Mu Wansu was seated to the side, absently-mindedly playing with an exquisite teacup as if she did not wish to be part of the conversion.Her attitude felt odd to Yan Zhen, but he maintained his smile and said, \u201cSo it's Young Master Lin Xun. Today's matter was due to the inadequacy of my Stone Cauldron Alms. I hope the young master does not take it to heart.\u201dHis words were courteous but Lin Xun was even more polite. He hurriedly rose to his feet and cupped his hands together, displaying an ashamed and apologetic appearance, \u201cElder is too polite, I was the one who was originally at fault. How can I possibly blame others?\u201dYan Zhen found himself unable to read Lin Xun's intentions. The kid had been so forceful and unyielding earlier, so why had he suddenly become so accommodating?With such thoughts in mind, Yan Zhen asked, \u201cIf I may be so bold as to ask if the young master had immediately shown the token earlier, wouldn't we have avoided this misunderstanding\u2026\u201dBefore he could finish, Lin Xun embarrassedly said, \u201cElder might not know but it was an emergency situation earlier. In addition, I was not certain of the token's effectiveness. Hence, my plan was to make a big enough commotion to draw the elder's attention.\u201dYan Zhen was at a loss for words. The kid was honest and had come clean about everything, making Yan Zhen feel that the kid's character was not bad.He had unwittingly begun to view Lin Xun in a slightly more favorable light. It was honestly rare to find such a wise thirteen-year-old youngster nowadays.Most importantly, he knew when to stand his ground or back down. If Yan Zhen had not personally witnessed the earlier affair, he would have suspected Lin Xun to be a very shrewd adult.\u201cWas that really what you were thinking back there?\u201d Mu Wansu suddenly asked, her eyes staring at Lin Xun like knives.She could tell at a glance that the little punk had been talking rubbish since he entered the room. He made himself seem meek and truthful, making it impossible to find any fault with him. This brat is way too devious.<sub>You can_find the rest of this_content on the elworld.com platform.</sub>Given Lin Xun's intelligence, Mu Wansu knew that he definitely would not have made such a huge commotion in public just to draw out Yan Zhen. There was likely some other goal behind these actions!Lin Xun chuckled bitterly and sighed, \u201cBig Sister Wansu, this is the first time in my life that I've left the mountain village and I have no knowledge or experience about the outside world. If there's anything I've done wrong, I hope that you will be generous with your guidance.\u201dHe bowed at Mu Wansu with a sincere and earnest attitude, making it impossible for her to find any fault with him despite knowing that it was all an act. Otherwise, it would only make her appear petty.This punk is becoming more and more crafty!Mu Wansu was fuming inside, but she retained a lovely smile on her face, \u201cAlright, since the matter has passed, we shall not bring it up anymore. Moreover, you're someone who the First Young Master thinks highly of. Even if you made a mistake, it can be forgiven.\u201d\u201cHaha, Miss Wansu is right. We shall not mention this matter again.\u201d Yan Zhen laughed heartily, \u201cRight then, we still do not know why the young master has come to our Stone Cauldron Alms.\u201dLin Xun's expression immediately turned solemn as he cupped his hands together, \u201cTruth be told, I came here because of two matters.\u201dYan Zhen stroked his mustache and smiled, \u201cFeel free to tell us.\u201d\u201cFirst, I'm here to sell some goods and exchange some living necessities for our Feiyun villagers. At the same time, I'm also hoping to sign a trade contract with Stone Cauldron Alms.\u201dLin Xun swiftly explained, \u201cElder probably does not know yet, but Feiyun Village is currently able to produce some Feiyun Fire Copper, which I believe is a resource needed by Stone Cauldron Alms. I plan to sign an exclusive trading contract with Stone Cauldron Alms to collect the Feiyun Fire Copper and secure a long-term trading route for the village.\u201dYan Zhen raised his brow, \u201cFeiyun Fire Copper?\u201dLin Xun smiled, \u201cCorrect, Big Sister Mu Wansu and the First Young Master saw it when they were guests at Feiyun Village.\u201dHe instantly implicated Mu Wansu, causing her to glare at him. In the end, she nodded, \u201cHe's right.\u201dYan Zhen immediately put aside his worries and smiled, \u201cGreat, I can agree to this contract. After all, it's mutually beneficial.\u201dLin Xun chuckled, \u201cThank you, elder, for allowing it.\u201dOnce this matter was settled, anyone who dared to have designs on the Feiyun Fire Copper in the future would have to first get past Stone Cauldron Alms.At the same time, Stone Cauldron Alms would not dare to try and cheat the villagers on account of his relationship with Shi Xuan. Hence, Lin Xun would not need to worry about this after he left Feiyun Village in the future.Moreover, selling Feiyun Fire Copper would create income for the village and gradually improve the villagers' lives. They would no longer need to fret over their livelihoods.This was called killing two birds with one stone. Lin Xun had already begun to plan this when he arrived at Feiyun Village and finally seeing it succeed made him breathe a sigh of relief inside.<sub>Visit to elworld.com discover_new novels.</sub>Yan Zhen asked, \u201cYoung master, may I inquire about the second matter?\u201dLin Xun glanced at Mu Wansu before looking back to Yan Zhen and suddenly revealed a bitter smile.Before Lin Xun spoke, Mu Wansu's heart sank as she cursed inside. This punk is full of evil thoughts, he's most definitely going to use this chance to raise some troublesome matter!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

What's the matter?He had always had the impression that Mu Wansu would rarely lose her temper. She was beautiful, intelligent, capable, and was well-known in Donglin City. She didn't earn her nickname \u201cBlack Rose\u201d for nothing.Ever since Mu Wansu had met Lin Xun, she came to realize that all the abilities and skills she possessed were useless. She felt doomed every time she saw Lin Xun and she had been used by him repeatedly. She couldn't vent her indignation and had to suppress her anger.Mu Wansu felt greatly aggrieved and so she couldn't contain her anger anymore when she saw Lin Xun putting on a pitiful look and trying to deceive people again.However, Lin Xun seemed to not notice her fury as he turned around and sighed. \u201cOlder Sister Wansu, Elder Yan Zhen must know about the matter. Otherwise, I'm worried it will lead to misunderstandings.\u201dMu Wansu was dumbfounded. What does that mean? Does he think I already know what he wants to say?However, Mu Wansu very quickly understood Lin Xun's purpose in saying those words.Yan Zhen assumed a serious expression and said, \u201cSince Miss Wansu already knows then I respectfully ask you to tell me directly. Don't worry about creating any misunderstandings. Even if it's a major problem, we can always discuss a countermeasure.\u201dMu Wansu was utterly speechless at Yan Zhen's complete cooperation with Lin Xun.Solemnly, Lin Xun drew a deep breath, and he was about to speak when someone knocked on the door.Lin Xun couldn't help but frown, but Mu Wansu raised her brows in surprise and beamed with joy. Even the heavens are on my side!Yan Zhen got up, saying, \u201cIt must be an urgent matter for someone to knock at this hour,\u201d and he opened the door.Standing at the door was a panicked attendant.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Yan Zhen bluntly asked.\u201cManager Yan, Wu Deyong from the Wu Corporation brought a large group of people here and demanded we hand someone to them,\u201d explained the attendant urgently.Confused, Yan Zhen's face darkened. \u201cHand over who? Did Wu Deyong come to pick a fight?\u201dLin Xun got up and said helplessly, \u201cElder, they must be here for me.\u201dMu Wansu's smile froze on her lips. How could she not realize that the second matter that Lin Xun wanted to speak about was related to the Wu Corporation.That bastard tricked me again!<sub>Try the elworld.com platform_for the most advanced_reading experience.</sub>Mu Wansu gnashed her teeth.Yan Zhen exclaimed in shock, \u201cFor you? What for?\u201dLin Xun quickly ran through the matters between him and Wu Henshui. He firmly claimed that Wu Henshui forcibly tried to occupy all the aeth fields and Feiyun Fire Copper in Feiyun Village so he was killed by the villagers who were pushed to the dead end.He also mentioned how the Wu Corporation had hunted him down when he first arrived at the Qingyang Tribe and he had no choice but to turn to the Stone Cauldron Alms for help.Yan Zhen frowned. \u201cI see.\u201dHe realized that the matter was a little tricky to handle because the master of Wu Corporation was an influential figure in Donglin City and even the Stone Cauldron Alms was reluctant to become on unfriendly terms with the local tyrant.Yan Zhen knew that he had to help Lin Xun due to Lin Xun's relationship with the first young master, Shi Xuan, but they no doubt would have to pay a huge price to do so.Suddenly, Yan Zhen couldn't help but feel hesitant. His gaze shifted over to Mu Wansu.Mu Wansu felt her head throb with pain. That little bastard is so good at creating trouble. He stirred up such trouble when he just arrived at the Qingyang Tribe. If the First Young Master learns about this matter, would he regret giving him his badge?Mu Wansu hated the fact that she couldn't just hand over Lin Xun, the troublemaker, to Wu Corporation. That way, she could also vent her pent-up anger.But the current situation didn't allow her to do so.Mu Wansu sighed inwardly. Fine, I will help him this one last time. If that bastard continues to push his luck, I will draw a line with him even if the eldest young master disapproves!Mu Wansu's eyes suddenly glinted fiercely and her face bore a look of determination. \u201cYan Zhen, go tell them that Lin Xun is part of the Stone Cauldron Alms and tell them that they should watch what they do!\u201dYan Zhen nodded and hurried off.\u201cSister Wansu, my safety doesn't matter.\u201d Lin Xun couldn't help but interject when he saw what was happening. \u201cIt's the safety of the villagers in Feiyun Village that I'm worried about. If they are going to vent their anger on Feiyun Village instead, then I would rather not accept this help.\u201dHis expression became resolute.Mu Wansu stared at him for a long moment and eventually nodded. \u201cAlthough I don't have a good impression of you, I can promise you that this matter won't affect Feiyun Village.\u201dLin Xun gave her respectful cupped fist salute. \u201cThank you very much, I will remember your kindness and repay you tenfold in the future!\u201dMu Wansu found Lin Xun's serious and honorable attitude a little uncomfortable. She waved dismissively, saying, \u201cI don't need you to repay me, just stop giving me trouble.\u201dLin Xun nodded.He knew it was wrong to demand a great favor from a mere acquaintance and that he was burdening the other person, but he had no other choice.<sub>Visit elworld.com for a better_user experience</sub>It was for the villagers in Feiyun Village and for the sake of finding a temporary shelter for himself.Not long afterward, Yan Zhen returned with a smile. \u201cThe matter has been resolved. Given Wu Deyong's courage, even if he has the great influential person in Donglin City behind him, he has to tolerate our Stone Cauldron Alms.\u201dLin Xun stood up again and repeatedly thanked Yan Zhen. Soon after, he took his leave.As soon as Lin Xun left, Yan Zhen couldn't help but ask, \u201cMiss Wansu, what is the relationship between that young man and the eldest young master?\u201dMu Wansu looked distracted as she explained, \u201cFirst Young Master said that the kid has a very promising future. Besides that, he didn't say anything else, and I still don't understand what he means.\u201dYan Zhen was a little taken aback. He originally thought that Lin Xun and the eldest young master had a deep friendship but it turned out to be such a bizarre relationship.Mu Wansu drew a deep breath and instructed, \u201cLet's not talk about him. In two days, First Young Master might return to the Qingyang Tribe. You should make preparations.\u201dShe got up and left, but Lin Xun's face inexplicably flashed in her mind. I wonder if that kid understood what I meant. I hope he won't ever use First Young Master's name to intimidate people. Otherwise, I won't spare him!By the time he left Stone Cauldron Alms, it was already late at night and the pedestrians on the street were sparse. The glow of faint yellow light illuminating the street made it appear even quieter and deserted.Lin Xun left on his scaled horse and encountered no ambushes along the way. It seemed that the Wu Corporation really had retreated a step after receiving a warning from the Stone Cauldron Alms.The clash between two top forces was resolved seemingly silently, and it made Lin Xun realize the importance of top forces.In the Old Crow Inn.When Lin Xunzhong returned to the inn, the innkeeper, One-Eyed Giant, was sleeping behind the counter.However, he jolted awake upon Lin Xun's return and his expression was a mixture of shock, fear, and awe.\u201cExcuse me, sorry to disturb you again but can I book a room?\u201d Smiling, Lin Xun handed him twenty copper coins.\u201cNo, no, it's only five copper coins.\u201d One-Eyed Giant hurriedly declined.The matter that happened that night had stirred the entire Qingyang Tribe. Everyone was waiting to watch the youngster put up a good show but the result astounded everyone \u2014 Wu Corporation admitted defeat!One-Eyed Giant realized that Lin Xun had some sort of deep relationship with Stone Cauldron Alms and the reason that Lin Xun dared to kill Mad Dog Wu Jie and the others was because he had a strong backing.Lin Xun happily took back the fifteen copper coins and was led to a room by an attendant, who seemed eager to please Lin Xun.Lin Xun's smile faded from his lips the second his room door was closed. He stood in a daze in front of the window, gazing at the vast night sky. A rare trace of loneliness crossed his gentle and pure face.<sub>Foll_ow new_episo_des on the elworld.com platform.</sub>After a long while, he shook his head, blew out the candles, and lay on the bed in the dark.That night, it was the first time that Lin Xun didn't practice his cultivation arts.Early in the morning, when Lin Xun left the Old Crow Inn, his usual warm smile was on his lips again. He was in glowing spirits.During the day, the Qingyang Tribe was bustling with people shuttling in and out. The noises and activity from everywhere created a clamorous atmosphere.As Lin Xun strolled along the streets, he drank a bowl of milk made from green aeth beans and devoured ten steamed buns filled with wild bull meat. Rubbing his full belly with a satisfied face, he headed towards Stone Cauldron Alms.The person who welcomed him this time was the same middle-aged man in silk robes. He was called Xue Liang and was an experienced treasure appraiser.Xue Liang was much more friendly and enthusiastic compared to the last time. After appraising the goods in Lin Xun's animal-skin bag, he personally handed Lin Xun forty-three silver coins, which was equivalent to 4300 copper coins.Xue Liang was not only giving him a fair price but it was also borderline on the excessively generous side. Lin Xun obviously knew the reason.However, Lin Xun didn't decline the offer, but when he brought out the 150 kilograms of Feiyun Fire Copper concealed in his storage ring, he insisted that the appraiser pay the market price.Xue Liang wasn't only surprised by Lin Xun's insistence, but it also changed his impression of Lin Xun. The ill-feeling he had towards him had completely vanished.In the end, the 150 kilograms of Feiyun Fire Copper were exchanged for 550 silver coins, which was equivalent to 55,000 copper coins.It was an astonishing amount!Lin Xun only finally understood the purchasing power of such an amount when he went shopping afterward.The amount he had spent on living supplies for the villagers totaled to 1,500 copper coins, which was only fifteen silver coins.The batch of living supplies that he bought was enough to last the villagers around half a year!In addition, Lin Xun ordered a batch of aeth concoctions from Stone Cauldron Alms, including qi-drawing pills, inner strengthening pills, organ opening powder, and orifice unlocking liquid. Although the aeth concoctions were ordinary, they were essential for True Martial Stage cultivators.He bought them to prepare the children in the village for their cultivation paths.Additionally, Lin Xun bought some rune ink, which was necessary to engrave rune patterns, and also bought clothes for Xia Zhi and himself.All the items totaled to only four hundred silver coins, which clearly demonstrated the astonishing purchasing power of the empire's money.However, making money was extremely difficult.<sub>Visit elworld.com for a better_user experience</sub>For example, if Lin Xun hadn't sold the 150 kilograms of Feiyun Fire Copper, he couldn't possibly have bought so much stuff.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The items required for cultivation were all costly and simply unaffordable to ordinary people.Lin Xun had heard that many gifted people failed to set foot on the cultivation path due to their poor background and lack of financial support. In the end, they remained as ordinary people among the mass of common people.Fortunately, Lin Xun had no such worries yet.When noon neared, Lin Xun decided to set off to return to Feiyun Village. Xue Liang sent two guards to escort Lin Xun and help transport his goods back.The two guards were also given the task of purchasing Feiyun Fire Copper, and so they came with Lin Xun to scout out Feiyun Village beforehand since they would need to go there to purchase Feiyun Fire Copper every month.With that arrangement in place, Lin Xun wouldn't have to worry that no one would help the villagers of Feiyun Village deliver and exchange goods even when he left the village.Lin Xun knew that was Yan Zhen's arrangement, which indicated that the people in Stone Cauldron Alms indeed kept their promises.As long as Stone Cauldron Alms remained in the Qingyang Tribe, and as long as Lin Xun was still alive, he wouldn't need to worry about someone breaking the agreement.Moreover, now that he had the Stone Cauldron Alms as a backer, he could guarantee that no one would dare touch the wealth that belonged to Feiyun Village.Xue Liang personally saw Lin Xun out of the Qingyang Tribe, drawing countless attention along the way. But they all retracted their gazes when they recognized him to be part of Stone Cauldron Alms.\u201cYoung Master Lin Xun, given your age and cultivation level, why don't you participate in the district examination in Donglin City?\u201dAs they exchanged conversations along the way, Xue Liang learned that Lin Xun was only thirteen years old and, besides feeling surprised, he couldn't help but encourage him to take the examination.Lin Xun exclaimed, \u201cDistrict examination?\u201dXue Liang patiently explained, \u201cEvery other year, the empire will conduct a selection process to recruit outstanding talents from all over the world.\u201dAccording to Xue Liang, the Ziyao Empire had established a series of examinations to select the best talents: district examination, prefectural examination, provincial examination and national examination.<sub>This_content is taken from elworld.com</sub>It was understandable given the Ziyao Empire's vast territory. Besides the Forbidden City, the empire's capital, the other land was divided into a further thirty four provinces, and each one was further divided into prefectures. Each prefecture was also further divided into districts.In short, the districts, prefectures, provinces and the imperial capital made up the vast territory of the Ziyao Empire.The district examination, prefectural examination, provincial examination and national examination corresponded to different levels of assessment and selection.The district examination was the lowest level and the conditions to participate was very simple: Participants had to be under fifteen years old and possess a cultivation base.Those who met those two conditions would successfully pass the district examination.The prefectural examination was more strict in that participants would have to undergo an assessment of their qualifications, power of understanding and foundation. Only the most outstanding could pass the examination.The provincial examination could no longer be described as strict, but harsh instead. Even Xue Liang didn't know about the specific details of the examination, only that those who passed were considered one of the best in the world!As for the national examination, it was too distant. It could be classified as the top assessment in the Forbidden City. Anyone able to participate was a superb cultivator selected from a million people. It was not an exaggeration to call them the pride of heaven.It was worth mentioning that the district examination, prefectural examination, provincial examination and national examination were a series of selections.An examinee not only had to be less than eighteen years old to participate in the national examination but also had to pass the district examination, prefectural examination and provincial examination!Lin Xun couldn't help but marvel at this. He wondered how many peerless cultivators would emerge in each year's examination. The ones able to rise above the others in the series of examinations would undoubtedly become the pillars of the Ziyao Empire and display their splendor.However, Lin Xun realized a problem. He asked, \u201cUncle Xue Liang, are there any specific benefits in participating in the examinations?\u201dXue Liang was struck dumb for a minute before he answered Lin Xun, \u201cThere are many. Besides fame, successful participants would encounter many opportunities to climb and be promoted to a higher position. Most importantly, it brings great benefits to their cultivation path.\u201dAfter a pause, he continued, \u201cFor example, those who pass the district examination would be noticed by many sects, clans, chambers of commerce and even the military and top academies. They would try to draw them over to their side with various means and even provide them with money and cultivation resources.\u201dLin Xun said in puzzlement, \u201cWhy is that?\u201dXue Liang smiled. \u201cIt's simple. Although it's only the district examination, many participants are under fifteen years old and possess a strong cultivation base. They are akin to good seedlings with huge potential and thus, in the future, could bring huge benefits to the sects and forces that drew them to their side.\u201dLin Xun nodded thoughtfully. \u201cI see, then there's no other benefit if one doesn't want to join any sects or forces?\u201d<sub>The most up-to-date nov_els are published_here > elworld.com</sub>\u201cOf course not. The empire would reward those successful with a prize and grant them the eligibility to participate in the prefectural examination. Those who pass would receive even greater benefits. For example, greater sects and forces would focus their attention on them.\u201d\u201cIt's even better to pass the provincial examination. Even if you don't have the opportunity to participate in the national examination in the future, you can enjoy an extremely high status, endless wealth, and cultivation resources. As for the national examination\u2014those who pass would be able to step into the halls of Qinglu Academy! It is the most famous academy in the empire and also the sacred cultivation place that countless cultivators dream to study in!\u201dXue Liang's voice trembled with emotions and admiration.He only restored his calm state after a while. He smiled bitterly. \u201cBut it's not easy to enroll into the Qinglu Academy because it only accepts one hundred students every year and 99% of participants in the national examination would fail.\u201dLin Xun slowly digested what Xue Liang said. In the end, he couldn't help but sigh emotionally. \u201cThe Qinglu Academy is indeed amazing. At least, its symbol is engraved on the imperial coins circulating around the empire.\u201dXue Liang had the same thought. \u201cI can't agree with you more. Anyway, each of the series of examinations for the selection of talent isn't simple. A cultivator must possess deep knowledge to pass each one. If you're interested, you can find out more in Donglin city. I heard that the district examination in Donglin City will begin in two months.\u201dLin Xun nodded. \u201cI will seriously consider it.\u201dWhile they conversed, they arrived on the outskirts of the Qingyang Tribe.There, Lin Xun bid farewell. \u201cUncle Xue Liang, you don't need to walk me any farther.\u201dXue Liang nodded. \u201cOkay, take care of yourself on the way.\u201dLin Xun smiled, mounted the scaled horse, turned the horse around and clattered away. The two guards from Stone Cauldron Alms, who were responsible for escorting goods, also followed after him.\u201cThat little guy seemed to have acted recklessly last night, but he's actually quick witted and intelligent. Also, he's far-sighted. Unless something unexpected happens, he surely will achieve success in the future. It's a pity that he was born in a remote and poor place. He lacks knowledge and experience, and as a result could run into many twists and turns in his life\u2026\u201dXue Liang stared into the distance until Lin Xun and the others vanished from his sight. He then withdrew his gaze and returned to the Qingyang tribe.At the same time, at the Wu Corporation.Wu Deyong sat dully in the main hall, his eyes bloodshot and his face overcast.He couldn't understand how a kid from Feiyun Village could become a distinguished guest of Stone Cauldron Alms, and why the Manager of Stone Cauldron Alms would stand up for him. And because of that, Wu Deyong couldn't vent his anger and had to swallow it.<sub>New novel_chap_ters are published here: elworld.com</sub>The power of Stone Cauldron Alms was too terrifying. Let alone Wu Deyong, even the Wu clan behind Wu Deyong wouldn't dare to offend the Stone Cauldron Alms.Compared with Stone Cauldron Alms, they were akin to tiny ants before a towering tree. If the Stone Cauldron Alms wanted to give them trouble, they could effortlessly crush them between their fingers!Therefore, they had to tolerate Lin Xun.An attendant urgently rushed over to report to him. \u201cBoss, the kid has left the Qingyang Tribe accompanied by two guards from Stone Cauldron Alms.\u201dThe last trace of stubborn refusal to accept defeat finally vanished from Wu Deyong's heart. His face clouded over. The Stone Cauldron Alms actually sent guards to accompany him?! It's clearly a warning to the Wu Corporation!\u201cManager, do we really just leave the matter at that? That kid killed Mad Dog Wu Jie and the others. Who in the Qingyang tribe doesn't know about that incident? If we don't teach him a lesson, how can we lift our heads high in the Qingyang tribe?\u201dA middle-aged man on the side of the hall fumed, drawing the others to nod their heads in agreement.Wu Deyong thundered, \u201cDon't tell me you want to get revenge? Do you want the Stone Cauldron Alms to find an easy excuse to get rid of us all?\u201dEveryone fell silent.After several breaths, Wu Deyong restored his calmness and said, \u201cThis matter has ended. Don't bring it up again!\u201dSomeone couldn't help saying, \u201cBut we still haven't heard any news about Chief Steward Wu Henshui. Do we have to forget about that matter too?\u201dThe mention of Wu Henshui made Wu Deyong's lips twitch. He hissed through gritted his teeth, \"Idiot, that boy single-handedly carried out a massacre in the Qingyang tribe. Do you think Wu Henshui would still be alive?\u201dEveryone fell silent again. They had already known that Wu Henshui's situation looked grim but they were unwilling to let Lin Xun go so easily.That matter not only concerned their faces, but also the Wu Corporation's reputation within the Qingyang Tribe!After a while, someone suggested, \u201cIt might not be inconvenient for us to act, but we can find someone else to take care of it. Why don't we hire someone to do it?\u201dHowever, Wu Deyong slammed the table and smoke almost rose from his head. He snapped, \u201cHave you forgotten what Yan Zhen said last night? If something happens to the kid, the Stone Cauldron Alms will get rid of us whether or not we did it! Do you know what that means? Even if the kid dies in the jaws of a beast, the Stone Cauldron Alms will take revenge on us! You bunch of idiots!

His heart tumbled with complex feelings.He felt at ease but also somewhat uneasy.However, what happened was in the past. He had decided to leave Feiyun Village with Xia Zhi once he had everything settled.He knew that there would be a broader world in the cities of the Ziyao Empire and that the move would be beneficial to them both!He couldn't stay in Feiyun Village his entire life; he had to move for his cultivation path and to find the enemy who stole his Origin Aeth Artery.\u201cEarly this morning, I heard that Little Sword Lord, Xie Yutang, had killed the Golden Flame Beast and took its Life Aeth Crystal inside its body.\u201d\u201cLife Aeth Crystals are extremely valuable and rare. It is said to be a core treasured material in making rune armaments.\u201d\u201cRune armament? What is that?\u201d\u201cIt's a kind of powerful equipment required in battle and can only be made by a rune master. But unfortunately, the construction of such a powerful and peerless armament also has a strict requirement of rune materials. Also, the process is extremely complex and difficult, so the rate of failure is very high. Even rune masters will require ample luck and opportunity to successfully construct one.\u201d\u201cIf that's the case, wouldn't a rune armament be extremely powerful once successfully refined?\u201d\u201cOf course, it's a rune armament! Its power is undoubtedly earth-shattering and unfathomable!\u201dSuddenly, a conversation caught Lin Xun's attention and made his heart flutter.The conversation was between the two guards who were escorting Lin Xun to Feiyun Village. They were from Stone Cauldron Alms and were both at the fourth-layer True Martial Stage. One was called Gao Guiyong and the other was called Zhou Quan.\u201cLittle Sword Lord killed the golden flame beast?\u201d asked Lin Xun.He had heard stories about the golden flame beast when he was in the Qingyang Tribe and had long deduced that the so-called golden flame beast was the giant golden beast he had seen a few days ago.\u201cThat's right.\u201d Gao Guiyong quickly answered.<sub>The latest_epi_sodes are on_the elworld.com website.</sub>Naturally, he didn't dare to treat Lin Xun with any disrespect given Lin Xun's relationship with Yan Zhen.Zhou Quan added, \u201cAlthough the golden flame beast has been slaughtered, Liu Yukun couldn't be saved.\u201dLin Xun's eyes narrowed imperceptibly. Then, he exclaimed, \u201cLiu Yukun?\u201d\u201cYes, the eldest son of Liu Wujun, the governor of the southwestern province of the empire. It is said that Liu Yukun and his people all met their death at the jaws of the golden flame beast. I heard that Liu Yukun's corpse was burned to charcoal. He suffered such a tragic end.\u201dZhou Quan sighed. \u201cThis matter will likely spread to Governor Liu Wujun within the next few days. I wonder how many storms it will stir up.\u201dOnly then did Lin Xun learn about the remarkable background of Liu Yukun who had died in his hands. He couldn't help but feel a little strange and in disbelief that he killed the son of a governor.However, Lin Xun wasn't particularly worried. At least no one knew that he was the one who killed Liu Yukun.As night quickly descended, Lin Xun and the two guards found a cave to rest for the night.Gao Guiyong and Zhou Quan ate some rations and then acted according to their plan. They had decided to take turns to guard the cave. One of them was responsible for the first half of the night and the other took care of the other half. Many beasts were found in the barren mountains so they had to be vigilant.Seeing that the two had such an arrangement, Lin Xun was able to relax and concentrate on his training.First, he practiced the Yuan Holding Art and guided his aeth power seventy two times around his body. Once he completed the cycles, he immediately moved on to practice the Little Divine Meditation Art.He meditated until it became late at night. He opened his eyes and scanned the surroundings for danger. Only then did he gather his perception and enter the Omega Secret Realm. He wanted to challenge the Thousand Heavy Wave Sea for the fourth time.In the end, Lin Xun failed without any suspense.Lin Xun had already predicted such an outcome, and so compared to that, he was more concerned about the improvements to his physical strength.As expected, after a careful examination, he found that his skin, flesh, blood, muscles and bones had been tempered once again. In addition, his strength had tripled.All his improvements were attributed to the rune battle realm\u2014Thousand Heavy Wave Sea. Although he had failed every time, it still had a tremendous body-tempering effect.However, Lin Xun found that his physical strength had reached its limit. His body strength had to undergo a complete transformation if he wanted to increase it further.\u201cIt seems that I have to start from my cultivation base.\u201d<sub>The most up-to-date nov_els are published_here > elworld.com</sub>Lin Xun fell into deep thought. Despite his little knowledge in body tempering, he speculated that a cultivator's physical strength was closely linked to their cultivation base.A cultivation breakthrough was an internal transformation, while a physical breakthrough was an external transformation. Now that his physical strength had reached a plateau, he had to target it from the internal to the external in order to initiate another breakthrough.Lin Xun's aeth power had reached the Orifice Unlocking layer, the fourth layer True Martial Stage, and he was one step away from reaching the pinnacle to break through to the Essence Refining layer, the fifth layer True Martial Stage.However, Lin Xun wasn't too worried. He estimated that he likely could smoothly break through to the fifth-layer True Martial Stage with the help of the power from the Blood Essence Sand and the Four Seasons Brew.At that time, his internal cultivation base would undergo a breakthrough, and subsequently break the limit of his physical strength. As a result, his physical strength would reach a new height.He had little worry about his physical strength and cultivation base, but he was concerned about his cultivation of runes and spirit.He had been relying on the Star Cycle of the Little Divine Meditation Art for the cultivation of his spirit but the progress wasn't as fast as he had hoped. He still hadn't illuminated the second star in his mind-sea.He had only touched upon the door of the Star Cycle, one of the three great stages of the Little Divine Meditation Art.Moreover, his cultivation in runes had stagnated for several months due to the lack of rune ink.Fortunately, he had purchased many different varieties of rune inks from the Qingyang Tribe to solve that problem.In addition to body tempering, cultivation base, spirit cultivation and the art of runes, there was also martial arts training.His grasp of the Marching Army Fist had stilled at the Precise Realm, and despite him being only one step away from the Perfect Realm, he had repeatedly failed to break through.Additionally, his grasp of the Six Word Blade had only reached the Elemental Realm.A cultivator could only fully master a combat art after the art progressed through the four realms, Inkling, Elemental, Precise and Perfect.Lin Xun had to admit that he still hadn't fully mastered the two arts, Marching Army Fist and the Six Word Blade, to the Perfect Realm.What Lin Xun didn't know was that although the Marching Army Fist seemed to be a basic art, only very few people in the world could grasp it to the point of precise, let alone perfect.Similarly, Lin Xun didn't know about the Six Word Blade's origin, but Mister Lu would be deeply astonished if he knew he had learned the blade art to the Precise Realm.In short, Lin Xun thought this was due to his lack of knowledge and martial arts experience.<sub>The latest_epi_sodes are on_the elworld.com website.</sub>After all, he grew up in a dark mine prison and had almost solely focused on the art of runes his entire life. Mister Lu had never taught him any martial arts, and even if he imparted him with the Marching Army Fist and the Six Word Blade, it was with the intention of tempering Lin Xun's body and improving the flexibility of his wrist to better engrave runes.Moreover, Lin Xun had little chance to learn more about martial arts ever since he moved to Feiyun Village as he had only encountered ordinary people there.All that contributed to his misunderstanding in martial arts training.After Lin Xun had truly set foot into the Ziyao Empire and entered the vast world where cultivators were as many as clouds and where powers stand in great numbers, his misunderstandings would be swept away.Experience and insight couldn't be taught, imparted or learned. A cultivator had to explore and comprehend them on their own.As the saying goes: those who travel ten thousand miles know more than those who read ten thousand books.When Lin Xun opened his eyes, dawn was breaking and a morning breeze whistled into the cave, bringing a refreshing feeling to the spirit.After the night-long practice, Lin Xun felt energetic and refreshed. As he walked out of the cave, he saw Gao Guiyong and Zhou Quan were all packed and sitting on the horse waiting for him.Lin Xun didn't dither. He immediately leaped onto the scaled horse and continued the journey.It was just that Gao Guiyong and Zhou Quan wore puzzled expressions mixed with a hint of awe when they looked at Lin Xun.Perplexed, Lin Xun found an opportunity to ask them. \u201cGuys, did something happen last night?\u201dGao Guiyong shook his head, but Zhou Quan hesitated for a moment and replied, \u201cYoung master, during your training last night, you suddenly stopped breathing and we couldn't detect your existence. We were so frightened that we thought an enemy had come to attack. It turned out to be just a false alarm.\u201dGao Guiyong interrupted, \u201cYes, it was indeed a false alarm. It seemed that the young master was practicing some extremely unique art that has the mysterious effect of concealing his breathing.\u201dHis voice was filled with amazement and admiration. No ordinary person could possess a cultivation art that could cover up one's breathing!Lin Xun's eyes were suddenly filled with a realization of what happened. He was challenging the Omega Secret Realm then. However, he didn't explain much to the two guards.What Zhou Quan said made Lin Xun realize something\u2014If he encountered an enemy he couldn't defeat, he could find a hiding spot and enter the Omega Secret Realm to prevent the enemy from detecting his presence.The only drawback was that he would also lose his perception of the outside world, and even if he was discovered, he could die without himself knowing.<sub>Visit elworld.com for a better_user experience</sub>Therefore, it was best to avoid resorting to such a method.While Lin Xun and his people hurried on with their journey, in a secret chamber of Stone Cauldron Alms in Qingyang Tribe, Shi Xuan set down the tea cup in his hand and said with a smile, \u201cAs soon as I came back, I heard that Lin Xun single-handedly took down four subordinates of the Wu Corporate and caused a sensation. Is that right?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He is so hateful.\u201dShi Xuan was surprised by her response. \u201cHow can you say that?\u201dMu Wansu didn't conceal the matter that happened that day. She briefly recounted the events and afterwards, she smiled coldly. \u201cFirst Young Master, don't you think that kid is particularly hateful? He's just a fox exploiting the tiger's might!\u201dShi Xuan appeared lost in thought, and it was only after a long moment that he clapped his hands and laughed aloud. \u201cLin Xun, nice one. I only thought he was a good seedling, but I seemed to have underestimated him. He's only around thirteen to fourteen but he's so shrewd and capable already. It's hard to find someone like him!\u201dHis voice was filled with admiration.Mu Wansu almost thought that she had heard him wrong, and couldn't help but ask, \u201cFirst Young Master, that kid has no sense of shame. He's so crafty and deceitful, why do you always blindly praise him?\u201dShi Xuan's smile faded from his lips and he sighed. \u201cLet me ask you a question. Was it his first time in the Qingyang Tribe that day?\u201dMu Wansu said, \u201cIndeed.\u201d\u201cLet me ask you again. Do you know why he killed Mad Dog Wu Jie and the others in public rather than keep a low profile when he just came to the Qingyang Tribe?\u201d\u201cWe don't need to make guesses. He must have long decided to force our Stone Cauldron Alms to stand up for him. This is why he dared to be so arrogant.\u201d Mu Wansu sounded indignant.Shi Xuan smiled. \u201cYes, but you made a mistake. I gifted him that badge. If he doesn't use it, what's the value of the badge in his hands?\u201dMu Wansu looked taken aback, but she immediately frowned and said, \u201cBut even if he wanted to ask the Stone Cauldron Alms to help him, he could have let us know first. Instead he took action before thinking about the consequences and made our Stone Cauldron Alms fall into a passive position. How ridiculous is that?\u201dAfter a pause, she hissed through gritted teeth. \u201cThe most hateful thing about him is that he didn't try to humble himself when he came to the Stone Cauldron Alms. Instead he got into a huge fight and created a huge scene. If I wasn't present, it would have turned into a huge mess.\u201dShi Xuan sighed. \u201cThat was his intention.\u201dMu Wansu's frown deepened. She realized that no matter what she said, it didn't change the first young master's view of Lin Xun. Instead it made him admire Lin Xun even more.<sub>The latest_epi_sodes are on_the elworld.com website.</sub>Mu Wansu responded with an aggrieved tone. \u201cI know he did it intentionally and his goal was to attract the attention of Manager Yan Zhen!\u201dShi Xuan shook his head. \u201cThat's only one of his goals. What's more important for him was to tell everyone that he was in the Stone Cauldron Alms!\u201dMu Wansu was utterly perplexed. \u201cWhy would he do that?\u201dShi Xuan asked, \u201cIf Lin Xun had suddenly turned up and asked our Stone Cauldron Alms to deal with Wu Corporation for him, would you and Yan Zhen agree?\u201dMu Wansu was hesitant to answer. She knew she wouldn't agree, and she had to admit it. \u201cI don't think I would. He's just a country boy. Even if he held your badge, it wouldn't benefit the Stone Cauldron Alms to be on unfriendly terms with Wu Corporation just for him. We would have at most protected his life.\u201dShi Xuan nodded. \u201cYan Zhen no doubt would have done the same as you. This was why Lin Xun played an unexpected move. His move drew the people from the Wu Corporation to the Stone Cauldron Alms and forced you to make that decision.\u201d\u201cIf the people of the Stone Cauldron Alms had retreated, we would have become the laughingstock of the Qingyang Tribe and that would tarnish the entire Stone Cauldron Alms' reputation. If our Stone Cauldron Alms had chosen to quiet down the matter so as to avoid any trouble and protected only Lin Xun, we would appear weak. If people think our Stone Cauldron Alms are afraid of the Wu Corporation, it would be detrimental to our reputation.\u201dShi Xuan couldn't help but laugh. \u201cYou all saw the result. Wu Corporation was forced to admit defeat and Lin Xun became the final winner.\u201dMu Wansu recalled Lin Xun's actions that night and she matched them up with Shi Xuan's explanation. Inexplicably, a slither of terror crept to her heart. \u201cFirst Young Master, would you have overestimated him?\u201dShi Xuan said calmly, \u201cI know you are biased against Lin Xun, but if you calm down and think about it, you won't think the same.\u201dMu Wansu fell silent, but she couldn't calm down for a good while. She quietly pondered over Lin Xun's actions but she still found it difficult to approve of them.\u201cDon't forget that he's just a kid from a remote mountain village. He's only thirteen to fourteen years old yet he managed to cause a storm the first time he arrived at a place like the Qingyang Tribe. He achieved that by just relying on a useless badge that I gifted him,\u201d Shi Xuan marveled, \u201cHe's not ordinary.\u201dMu Wansu clearly looked frustrated and unconvinced. \u201cIt's a badge from you, First Young Master, how could it be useless? He would have been hacked into eight parts if he didn't have your badge.\u201dShi Xuan glanced at Mu Wansu, frowning. \u201cIf Lin Xun didn't have that badge, he would have thought of another way given the ability and intelligence he had demonstrated. At least, he wouldn't expose his identity to Wu Corporation so soon. Remember, never let your emotions affect your decisions. Otherwise it could lead to huge mistakes.\u201dA look of fear washed over Mu Wansu's face. She nodded, saying, \u201cI will remember First Young Master's lesson.\u201dShi Xuan thought for a moment and suddenly he asked, \u201cWansu, have you been to the Forbidden City?\u201dMu Wansu shook her head. \u201cThat's the empire's capital. I likely won't ever have the chance to go there in my lifetime.\u201d<sub>The source of this_chapter; elworld.com</sub>Shi Xuan continued, \u201cIf you have the opportunity to enter the Forbidden City one day, but your enemies, who were much stronger than you, saw you enter the city and they want to kill you, what would you do then? \u201dMu Wansu pursed her lips. \u201cEither run away or seek the help of others.\u201d\u201cBut if others don't want to offend your enemies, what would you do?\u201dMu Wansu's expression changed dramatically.She realized that Shi Xuan was comparing her with Lin Xun.Indeed, the circumstances in which Lin Xun, who was from a remote mountain village, came to the Qingyang Tribe would be similar to Mu Wansu entering the Forbidden City from Donglin City. If she were to face a similar situation to that of Lin Xun, what would she do?Understanding dawned on Mu Wansu's face as she drew a deep breath. She then bowed respectfully, \u201cThank you, First Young Master, for your lesson.\u201dBut in her heart, her prejudice towards Lin Xun remained. He had taken advantage of her too many times and had humiliated her time and time again. How could she forgive him completely?Mu Wansu had come to a decision \u2014 First Young Master may admire Lin Xun, but if I run into Lin Xun again, I won't give him the chance to take advantage of me!Shi Xuan smiled while waving his hand. \u201cThis is just a small matter. Just pay more attention to it in the future. After all, Lin Xun is still very young and lacks experience. It will take a long time for him to rise to the top. If he could set foot into the Forbidden City someday, I might personally ask him to join Stone Cauldron Alms. As for now, we should maintain a good relationship with him. Whether he becomes a dragon or a snake will depend on him.\u201dMu Wansu nodded repeatedly. \u201cQuite right.\u201dShi Xuan glanced at her and couldn't help shaking his head. He knew that it would be difficult to resolve Mu Wansu's prejudice towards Lin Xun so he didn't try any more.Suddenly, Shi Xuan remembered something and said ruminatively, \u201cNow that Xie Yutang had slaughtered the golden flame beast and likely took the Origin Aeth Crystal, he will ask the elders of his family to help him construct a rune armament. If he succeeds, his strength will become even more terrifying. At that time, the ranking of the top thirty in the empire will no doubt change\u2026\u201dMu Wansu exclaimed, \u201cA rune armament is that powerful?\u201dShi Xuan nodded. \u201cIt's the secret skill of the Xie Family from the Black Cloth Alley. A Rune Armament can produce unbelievable power with the Xie Family's skill.\u201dHe suddenly stood up and his face bore a look of determination. \u201cI should make a trip home. Xie Yutang has found his opportunity, but I won't just give up.\u201dMu Wansu quickly asked. \u201cFirst Young Master, what about the peerless treasure? Are we just going to give up like that?\u201d<sub>The latest_epi_sodes are on_the elworld.com website.</sub>Shi Xuan shook his head. \u201cThere is no need to investigate anymore. If my speculation is correct, the treasure might not exist at all. Even if it does, it most likely has been taken already. Don't forget that the peerless treasure was originally just a conjecture from the Heavenly Seer, the imperial stargazing platform. If it's not true, it isn't worth us wasting more energy.\u201dWhile speaking, he had already pushed open the door, and he then left.On that day, not only Shi Xuan gave up the search, many top influential figures in the Great Three Thousand Mountains were also discouraged to have found nothing and left as a result.This storm brought about by the peerless treasure silently came to an end after Xie Yutang killed the golden flame beast.But the storm in the Great Three Thousand Mountain hadn't ended because the huge waves brought about by Liu Yukun's death had only just begun.But for now, all of that seemed to have nothing to do with Lin Xun.After traveling for around another day, Lin Xun finally saw the familiar outline of Feiyun Village in the evening. It was only then that he could completely relax.Other than a few attacks from wild beasts along the way, he had encountered no more obstacles.\u201cUncle Lin Xun is back!\u201dThe children playing at the village entrance broke into cheers upon seeing Lin Xun's figure, and a kid rushed into the village to spread the news.Not long afterwards, Village Chief Xiao Tianren came out with a group of villagers. They all beamed with excitement and joy.Lin Xun felt a warmth in his heart. Perhaps only in Feiyun Village would he feel such precious warmth.Lin Xun somersaulted off his horse and introduced Gao Guiyong and Zhou Qian to Xiao Tianren. After a brief chat about the goods, he hurried home alone.He didn't see Xia Zhi among the villagers. Even though he was only gone for around four to five days, he was deeply worried about how the little girl was doing.When he pushed open the courtyard door, he saw Xia Zhi eating alone at the stone table under the weeping willow tree.The setting sun sprinkled onto the little girl's body, bathing her in a tranquil and sacred glow.When Xia Zhi saw Lin Xun, she got up and retrieved a pair of chopsticks from the kitchen. Then, she scooped Lin Xun a bowl of rice and set it on the opposite side of the table and said, \u201cLet's eat.\u201d<sub>You can_find the rest of this_content on the elworld.com platform.</sub>There was no excitement and no cheering, and she didn't even ask how he was doing.However, Lin Xun smiled and warmth filled his heart. If he remembered correctly, it was the first time that Xia Zhi got him a bowl and served him food ever since she came into his life.This was how Xia Zhi welcomed him, which was as unique as herself.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

In addition, there were aeth grains, aeth vegetables, and aeth herb seeds as well as farming tools.The villagers buzzed with excitement when all the items were divided. Back when Lian Rufeng was the guard leader, the items he brought back could barely sustain their lives. In contrast, the items that Lin Xun brought back were not only generous but there was also a wide range of items.Most importantly, each household was given a share of three imperial silver coins, which was equivalent to three hundred copper coins!This was an unimaginable fortune to the villagers who had never left the Great Three Thousand Mountains.What Lin Xun had done made the villagers even more grateful to him and raised his prestige to an unprecedented level.It wasn't until late at night that the villagers began to disperse one after another, leaving only Lin Xun and Village Chief Xiao Tianren in the ancestral hall.\u201cSilly, what's the use of giving money to the villagers? They will always stay in Feiyun Village, how will they have the chance to spend the money?\u201d Xiao Tianren sighed. He felt Lin Xun had spent too much money and he didn't have to do so.\u201cThey might not use it now, but it might be useful in the future.\u201d Lin Xun smiled. \u201cBesides, the money was from selling Feiyun Fire Copper, so just see it as wages for everyone.\u201dXiao Tianren sighed, \u201cThirty copper coins would be enough for wages, but they each received three silver coins.\u201dLin Xun smiled and said nothing. He had previously promised Xiao Tianren that the villagers would only receive payment for mining Feiyun Fire Copper and he shouldn't share his profits.However, how could Lin Xun treat the villagers as his employees? In his view, Feiyun Village was no different from his home and the villagers were his relatives. Naturally, he had to share his earnings with them.Based on that fact alone, Lin Xun would never be stingy to them.\u201cAi, you\u2014you\u2014I really don't know what to say about you,\u201d Xiao Tianren sighed helplessly. In truth, Lin Xun's action had greatly touched him. And seeing that Lin Xun had no intention of changing his mind, he left the matter at that.\u201cUncle Xiao, I believe Feiyun Village will only become better in the future. We should set our sights high. We should first make everyone become wealthy, then perhaps, in the future, all of the villagers can enjoy life in the city.\u201d Lin Xun said seriously, \u201cDon't you want your descendants to escape a life of poverty and live a better life in the city?\u201dXiao Tianren was visibly moved. He fell silent, touched by Lin Xun's words and his beautiful vision for the village.He's right. The villagers have been poor their entire lives. Would they want their next generation to be just as poor?Of course not!<sub>You can_find the rest of this_content on the elworld.com platform.</sub>Lin Xun didn't say anything else, bowed, and took his leave.He knew that the change wouldn't happen overnight. They would think deeper about the long term when the villagers from Feiyun Village become rich from selling Feiyun Fire Copper.Surviving and living were completely different.In the past, the villagers of Feiyun Village only had to deal with the problem of surviving. The most important thing for them was to survive.However, once they dealt with the survival problem, they would think about their quality of life and how to raise their next generation.Right now, the Feiyun Fire Copper Mine provided Feiyun Village with a solution to their survival problem and the ability to live a desirable life.Lin Xun firmly believed that the villagers' lives would only get better when he left.Of course, that was only if nothing bad happened.However, given the Stone Cauldron Alms' credibility, he shouldn't have to worry.Early next morning, Gao Guiyong and Zhou Quan said goodbye and left. They had completed their mission and also reached an agreement with Xiao Tianren\u2014They would personally come to purchase Feiyun Fire Copper every month as well as bring living supplies for the villagers.This could be regarded as a mutually beneficial deal, only that the transaction would take place in Feiyun Village and, as a result, remove a lot of unnecessary risks and problems for the villagers.The same morning, Lin Xun asked Ying Liu'er and the other three children, who had reached the first layer True Martial Stage, to gather together so he could distribute the aeth decoctions, including qi-drawing pills, inner strengthening pills, organ opening powder and orifice unlocking liquid, he had purchased among them.There were over twenty children in the village but unfortunately, only four were able to draw qi into their bodies.In other words, among the twenty-odd children, only Ying Liu'er and the other three managed to set foot on the cultivation path. The other children only had a slim chance of doing so.This was the reality. After all, only very few people in the world could become true cultivators.From that day on, Lin Xun was relieved of the responsibility of martial arts master in the village. He had imparted everything he could to the children and could only leave the children to train on their own.As they said, the master could lead you to the cultivation door but one's cultivation depends on oneself.<sub>Visit elworld.com for a better_user experience</sub>Lin Xun had done everything to help eliminate troubles for Feiyun Village, whether it was eradicating Lian Rufeng and his people or suppressing the Wu Corporation with the help of the Stone Cauldron Alms.Moreover, the mining of Feiyun Fire Copper and teaching martial arts to the children in the village were for the future development of Feiyun Village.Lin Xun could finally free himself from those mundane affairs now that they were progressing as he wanted.However, Lin Xun couldn't completely relax. During the day he practiced martial arts and engraving runes and at night he tempered his cultivation base and spirit. He didn't need to worry about food or cultivation problems now that he had massive resources.Every three days, he entered the rune battle realm\u2014Thousand Heavy Wave Sea to attempt to break through. He fully utilized every second he had.Occasionally, he would train with Xia Zhi to improve his combat skills and temper his body. The insights he gained from those battles were used to invent and perfect his own fighting techniques.On the other hand, Xia Zhi lived a carefree life, doing nothing apart from eating and sleeping.Half a month later.Lin Xun had successfully broken through to the Essence Refining layer, the fifth layer True Marital Stage, with the help of Blood Essence Sand and the Four Seasons Brew.Shua! Shua! Shua!Lin Xun's figure was akin to a lightning bolt as he darted across the air and left blurred shadows in the courtyard. The Skybreaker Blade slashed through the air, performing various moves with ease.Multiple blade shadows swiftly sliced a huge boulder thrown into the air into neat strips like dicing tofu.Each stone strip was the same thickness of his thumb and three inches long.Bang!Each one exploded to smithereens before it touched the ground and dissipated in the air.That move alone demonstrated the incredible speed and accuracy of Lin Xun's blade. The blade not only contained razor sharp qi but also an internal force that shattered the huge boulder to smithereens.\u201cAs expected, my control of power has improved after breaking through to the Essence Refining layer.\u201dLin Xun withdrew his sword and stood still, quietly analyzing the subtle differences of his blade.The Essence Refining layer was the fifth layer of the True Martial Stage. A cultivator's bones and essence would be tempered thousands of times upon breakthrough to the fifth layer and sparkle in a silvery shimmer. This was the reason why people said that blood refining resembled syrup and essence refining resembled frost.<sub>Foll_ow new_episo_des on the elworld.com platform.</sub>At the same time, Lin Xun's aeth power underwent another transformation after the breakthrough. It became twice as strong as before. His body of qi had surged and he radiated a terrifying and fierce bearing even when he was merely standing and doing nothingThis was a sign of a further upgrade to the qi inside and outside the body.The next layer was the blood igniting layer, the sixth layer True Martial Stage, and in that layer, as the name indicated, a cultivator would need to make their blood boil until it ignited and then vigorously course around the body.Once a cultivator reached that layer, their skin membrane, muscles, bones, blood, essence, organs and the qi inside and outside their body would enter a state of true gold and could withstand even fire. Their life span would be extended beyond one hundred years!However, Lin Xun, who had just broken through to the fifth layer, was still far from the Blood Igniting layer and his top priority now was to consolidate his foundation.After all, a cultivator who had just undergone a breakthrough would need to go through an accustoming process to fully grasp their new powers.\u201cAre you going to keep practicing like this every day?\u201d asked Xia Zhi. She was the one who tossed the huge boulder.\u201cOf course not.\u201d Lin Xun withdrew his Skybreaker Blade, sat at the stone table, took a cup of iced tea, and gulped it down. A refreshing feeling washed over his body.\u201cIn another month or so, we will leave here and head to Donglin City in the Ziyao Empire. I have thought about it for a long time. If you want to become stronger, you should follow a powerful martial arts master or study at a powerful academy.\u201d Lin Xun said casually, \u201cWhen we reach Donglin City, I will help you find out more about this.\u201dXia Zhi shook her head. \u201cI don't want to follow a master.\u201dLin Xun was taken aback at first then he said with a smile. \u201cThen I'll find an academy for you to study at.\u201dThere were different academies across the city in the empire. The majority was for cultivation but some taught courses such as the art of runes, forging tools, decocting medicines, law of sound, aeth planting, raising beasts and military affairs. There were all kinds of courses.\u201cWill you be going?\u201d Xia Zhi raised her little face and stared seriously at Lin Xun with her clear and dark eyes.\u201cMe?\u201d Lin Xun thought about it and shook his head. \u201cI'm not sure yet.\u201d\u201cIf you're not going then I also won't go,\u201d stated Xia Zhi.Lin Xun said helplessly, \u201cLet's talk about it then.\u201d\u201cNo matter what happens, you can't leave me behind.\u201d He couldn't tell what Xia Zhi was thinking, but her beautiful and tranquil eyes became unwavering and stubborn.Then, she turned around and went into her room.Lin Xun fell into deep thought while he watched Xia Zhi leave the courtyard.<sub>For more_novel, visit elworld.com</sub>Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The letter was short and concise. It mainly notified Lin Xun that there was only one month until the district examination in Donglin City and that he should set off as soon as possible if he wanted to participate.Lin Xun knew that the district examination was generally held in December and the prefectural examination was set for March of the following year and the provincial examination was three months after that, which would be in June.The national examination was held in September.Violet glory flowers were said to bloom in the Forbidden City every September and wrapped around every part of the city like a sea of flowers. Such a stunning spectacle was known as the Violet Glory Flower Festival.Cultivators who successfully passed the national examination were hailed as the talent of Ziyao and the pride of the empire. They would be arranged to walk down the most famous imperial street in the Forbidden City in the midst of a sea of flowers and receive cheers and praises from million citizens.This tradition was also called the Walk of Heaven Prides.Lin Xun held the letter in his hand and stared at it for a long time. It was only when twilight descended that he came to a decision.Three days later.Before dawn, Lin Xun had already packed his bags. Holding Xia Zhi's little hand, he pushed open the door and walked into the courtyard.\u201cHave you really decided not to tell the others?\u201d Xia Zhi asked a rare question.\u201cYes, we are not parting forever. It's better not to disturb them.\u201d Lin Xun shook his head. In truth, he couldn't bear to see the villagers send him off.However, their footsteps halted at the village entrance.The sky was still dark and all mountains were shrouded in darkness but the village entrance was strangely lit up in firelight.All the villagers including Xiao Tianren, the elderly and children, were quietly standing there and lifting a flame torch.Every face was filled with reluctance to part with Lin Xun, and some people were forcing back their tears.No one spoke and the atmosphere was still and silent; only the sound of the wind sighing could be heard.<sub>Foll_ow current_novel on elworld.com</sub>Lin Xun was completely stunned. His emotions roiled uncontrollably and he was unable to calm down.\u201cLet's go!\u201dXiao Tianren took a deep breath and said in a deep voice, \u201cYou don't need to say anything. We just want to see you off.\u201dLin Xun nodded and somersaulted onto the scale horse with Xia Zhi in his arms. The horse hooves clattering against the ground was particularly evident in that quiet atmosphere.Many children couldn't help but rush forward, but were stopped by the adults near them. Some women had their heads bowed and were weeping from indescribable sadness.Under the firelight, Lin Xun took furtive glances at everyone. He realized that he had lived in Feiyun Village for over half a year already.Half a year!Not only did Feiyun Village change during that time, but he also had changed a lot. Now, he had to leave and he didn't know when he would return to see everyone again.\u201cLin Xun!\u201dSuddenly, a loud voice rang in Lin Xun's ears, snapping him out of his rambling thoughts. He turned his head around to see Village Chief Xiao Tianren wearing a solemn expression. \u201cRemember, Feiyun Village will always be your home. If it's too tiring in the outside world, don't force yourself to stay there. Feiyun Village will always welcome you back!\u201d\u201cWe will wait for your return!\u201dThe villagers could no longer contain their emotions. They simultaneously wailed, their voices filled with hope as they echoed endlessly in the darkness.Lin Xun drew several deep breaths, smiled broadly and waved his hand. Then, he immediately turned his scale horse around and galloped into the distance.Dawn broke, and the first ray of light pierced through the darkness, illuminating the mountains and rivers as it spread across the world. It bathed the young man on horseback with a dazzling glow.The villagers would never forget that scene.The villagers didn't leave until Lin Xun disappeared into the boundless horizon. Countless memories and past events with Lin Xun uncontrollably flashed to their minds as they watched him.When Lin Xun first arrived at Feiyun Village, who would have imagined that he would be the one to help them resolve one crisis after another?Who would have thought that Feiyun Village would undergo earth-shaking changes as a result of his arrival?The villagers knew that Lin Xun truly regarded Feiyun Village as his home. They also regarded Lin Xun as one of them.However, they all understood that Lin Xun couldn't stay in Feiyun Village his entire life. The outside world was his stage!<sub>This_content is taken from elworld.com</sub>\u201cLin Xun, will we come back in the future?\u201d\u201cDefinitely.\u201d\u201cThose people are nice.\u201d\u201cOf course, from now on, it may be difficult for us to meet people who treat us as nice as they did.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cXia Zhi, the outside world is huge with many unexpected dangers. I will do my best to not let you suffer.\u201d\u201cAs long as you don't abandon me, I won't suffer.\u201d\u201cHaha, how would I abandon you?\u201dIn the vast endless mountains, Lin Xun spurred his horse into a gallop. The biting cold morning wind brushing against his face made his handsome and sharp face appear extraordinarily resolute.Xia Zhi sat in Lin Xun's arms with a faint smile on her beautiful and tranquil face. Her world was very small, so small that it could only fit Lin Xun.Three days later.Lin Xun came to the Qingyang Tribe, paid Xue Liang a visit, and received a map with a route to Donglin City drawn out. He left the Qingyang Tribe that afternoon and headed north.Just as Lin Xun left, Yan Zhen, the manager of Stone Cauldron Alms in the Qingyang Tribe sent a letter to Donglin City, which was thousands of miles away.The letter was written to Mu Wansu, who was in charge of Stone Cauldron Alms in Donglin City. Only one sentence was on the letter: \u201cLin Xun has left for Donglin City and is expected to arrive in two days.\u201dThis letter was delivered by an azure feather falcon and reached Mu Wansu's hands in just three hours.Mu Wansu was taking a bath when the letter came to her. She immediately shredded it apart. \u201cCome if you want. I have the final say in Stone Cauldron Alms in Donglin City so don't even think about coming to Donglin City and have anything to do with our Stone Cauldron Alms!\u201dAs she got up from the bathtub, her graceful and enviable body glistened with water droplets, a seductive sheen that could make one lost in wild thoughts.Mu Wansu put on a loose bathrobe, stood in front of a huge bronze mirror, and dabbed her wet hair with a clean towel. There was an indescribable sense of beauty in her lazy manner.<sub>Visit elworld.com for a better_user experience</sub>Suddenly, as though she thought of something, her dark eyebrows were raised, and were as sharp and fierce as a blade.\u201cNo, the Stone Cauldron Alms shouldn't even purchase items from that little bastard. We must cut off all contact with him. Didn't First Young Master say that he will achieve greatness in the future? Let's see how he will establish himself in Donglin City without the help of the Stone Cauldron Alms!\u201dThinking of this, Mu Wansu's red and plump lips broke into a smile. Her eyes suddenly dimmed as she murmured, \u201cLin Xun, Lin Xun, don't blame your older sister for being merciless. It's your fault for making your older sister so angry. From now on, remember that if a woman is thinking about you, the consequences will be terrifying\u2026\u201dMeanwhile at the Wu Corporation in the Qingyang Tribe.\u201cManager, I have sent someone to investigate Feiyun Village. Chief Steward Wu Henshui and his subordinates, including Lian Rufeng, have all disappeared. They likely had met with a fatal accident like you suspected.\u201cIn addition, this evening, a scout came to report that Lin Xun had set off for Donglin City with a little girl,\u201d a subordinate reported to Wu Deyong.Wu Deyong's expression changed indefinitely as he listened, and he suddenly gritted his teeth. \u201cHe could have gone anywhere but he came to Donglin City. He walked right into our snare. Donglin City is our Wu Clan's base! Although the Stone Cauldron Alms also has a property in Donglin City, if we grasp this chance well, we can get rid of that kid!\u201dFor a whole month, Wu Deyong couldn't sleep or eat every time he thought of Wu Henshui, Mad Dog Wu Jie and the others. He felt a thorn pricking his heart.This was especially true after the Stone Cauldron Alms interfered in the matter. The Wu Corporation's reputation within the Qingyang Tribe had fallen to rock bottom and they had become laughingstocks.That only deepened Wu Deyong's hatred towards the boy. Wu Deyong immediately smelled an opportunity when he heard that Lin Xun had left home and was heading to Donglin City.As he said, Donglin City was the base of their Wu Clan and they had a complex network of forces working for them in Donglin City. Although the Stone Cauldron Alms was powerful and was one of the most formidable forces in the empire, it was still regarded as an outsider in Donglin City.Even the mighty dragon couldn't crush a snake in its territory. Wu Deyong was well aware of the thousand ways to kill and he knew that they didn't have to deal with Lin Xun in the open. If they planned a little and acted cautiously, they could silently get rid of Lin Xun!At that time, even if the Stone Cauldron Alms learned about what the Wu Clan had done, the consequences would be less severe as long as they refused to admit to it.The more that Wu Deyong thought about that, the more that he couldn't hold himself back. He left the Qingyang Tribe in a hurry with several guards that night and headed for Donglin City.In Stone Cauldron Alms, Xue Liang frantically searched for Yan Zhen and said worriedly, \u201cManager, it's not good. Wu Deyong is rushing to Donglin City with a group of people. He must have heard about Lin Xun and wants to do something to him!\u201d\u201cNo problem, I've already delivered a message to Miss Wansu.\u201dYan Zhen said calmly, \u201cWith Miss Wansu around, how would the Wu Clan dare anger the Stone Cauldron Alms because of Lin Xun?\u201dXue Liang felt relieved when he heard that.However, neither Yan Zhen nor Xue Liang knew that Mu Wansu had already decided to draw a clear line with Lin Xun.<sub>Visit elworld.com, for the best no_vel_read_ing experience</sub>On the other hand, Lin Xun likely didn't expect so many things to have secretly happened after he went to Donglin City.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Due to its isolated location, it was often quiet and deserted.Behind the counter, the owner, an old man with the surname Li, propped his head up with one hand and was dozing off.Only a youngster was browsing the store, and so the atmosphere was quiet and peaceful.The boy looked around thirteen to fourteen but he was tall and slender. He had a handsome and gentle face and he looked refreshing and well-kept in his rough grey robe.It was Lin Xun.Very quickly, Lin Xun picked out four books, went to the counter and whispered. \u201cGrandpa.\u201dThe old man awoke abruptly and smiled. \u201cWell, let me see\u2014'The Records of the Empire Landscape', 'The Official History of the Empire', 'The Handbook of Cultivation Basics', and 'The Collection of Runes'...\u201dThe old man raised his head and exclaimed in astonishment, \u201cIt's rare to see youngsters interested in these kinds of books nowadays and there aren't many people who like to read like you.\u201dLin Xun gave a slight smile. \u201cGrandpa, how much for these four books?\u201d\u201cIf you want them, I will take twenty copper coins for them,\u201d the old man said, quite casually.After Lin Xun paid, he picked up the books and hurried out of the bookshop.The night was dark but the row upon row of buildings in the distance were brightly lit. They were so beautiful that they resembled stars descending onto the secular world.A cool night breeze blew as Lin Xun hurried along the streets. He turned into a store called 'Ahu Fruit Puree' and took out five copper coins to purchase a large cup of tasty sweet and sour fragrant fruit puree.It was the signature product of Ahu Fruit Puree and it was a blend of several aeth ingredients such as root fungus leaf, violet floating radish and fragrant fruit. It had a sweet taste but most importantly, it had no impurities, which made it an ideal drink for cultivators.Carrying the books and fruit puree, Lin Xun constantly threaded his way through the streets and alleys until he came to an extremely bustling street.Crowds constantly weaved through the streets and there was an endless stream of horses and carriages. Bright and colorful lights as well as dizzying signs dotted the buildings on both sides.Many people on the streets were dressed in luxurious clothes and were traveling back and forth with carts of expensive items. Additionally, cultivators riding scale horses and horned deer occasionally sped past.Street vendors had set up street stalls and constantly advertised their products by yelling. The clamor and lively noises echoed ceaselessly on the bustling street.This was the most famous street in Donglin City and was at least eight hundred feet long. Hence, it was called the Great Eight Hundred Street.The center of this street consisted of several major businesses in Donglin City such as restaurants, inns, apothecaries and rune material stores.<sub>Visit elworld.com for a better_reading experience</sub>Every shop was a famous money squandering establishment in Donglin City and was supported by major forces. Naturally, the customers were valuable cultivators and ordinary people simply couldn't afford anything there.At the east end of the Great Eight Hundred Street stood an academy called Donglin Academy, which was managed by the empire. It would recruit students every year and anyone who passed the entrance assessment could study there after paying the tuition fee.For cultivators in Donglin City, it was an honor to study at Donglin Academy.The route that Lin Xun took happened to pass the Donglin Academy, and as he passed the academy, he couldn't help taking a closer look. The academy extended across a huge section of land and the campus was full of interesting architecture. And from time to time, he saw students walking past.After silently surveying the academy, Lin Xun turned around and left.It was then that a group of young girls walked over from the opposite side. Each one was dressed in fine clothes and looked radiant and spirited. They were extremely distinctive.\u201cIn another month, I can take the district examination. I am already at the third layer True Martial Stage so I can easily pass the examination!\u201d\u201cHahaha, which of us isn't under fifteen years old and which one of us doesn't possess a cultivation base above the third layer True Martial Stage? This district examination is a piece of cake for all of us.\u201d\u201cYes, the district examination isn't worth our time to think about. What we need to really consider is whether or not we are directly going to the Qingfeng region to participate in the prefectural examination in March after we pass the district examination!\u201d\u201cIt's not certain. This time, at least three thousand people from Donglin Academy intend to participate in the district examination and there are only one thousand admission places in the district examination. This means that two thousand people will be eliminated before it starts. We shouldn't be careless.\u201d\u201cYes, I'm also worried about that.\u201dAs the young girls walked, their conversations were centered around the district examination.Lin Xun wanted to listen closer but the girls entered the Donglin Academy together. They turned out to be students there.Lin Xun didn't follow them.\u201cI didn't expect there to be so many people participating in the district examination and two thousand people would be eliminated. In other words, even if they meet the conditions of passing, they might not qualify for admission.\u201dLin Xun pondered while walking. The so-called admission was the certification of the district examination, which was one of the conditions needed to participate in the upcoming prefectural examination.Soon, Lin Xun's figure disappeared from the Great Eight Hundred Street. he continued walking for another hour before he came to a dark, cold and dilapidated alleyway.This was the slums of Donglin City. Compared to other prosperous areas in Donglin City, the slums were in a state of disrepair and the majority of the people living there were considered at the bottom of society. The slums were inhabited by all sorts of people, including a mix of good and bad.The crime rate was very high and the environment was very chaotic with thieves, hooligans and murderers passing through the area every day.Lin Xun wouldn't have decided to live there if he had another choice.As Lin Xun made his way down a dark alley with puddles of grimy water covering quite a bit of the ground, he heard cats fighting and dogs barking.<sub>Visit elworld.com for a better_user experience</sub>A man suddenly jumped out from the corner of the alley and greeted Lin Xun with a smile, \u201cHey, buddy, are you alone?\u201d The man's mouth protruded out and his chin was pointy like an ape's.Crack!The moment that the man raised his hand, Lin Xun clutched it tight, applied force to his fingers, and twisted his wrist.The man loosened his grip and a little glinting blade clattered to the ground.In deep pain, the man was about to scream out when Lin Xun struck him unconscious with a palm strike. He was left lying on the stream of filthy water.From the start to finish, everything happened in a flash.As though he was used to such attacks, Lin Xun still wore a calm expression as he strolled forward.Not long after Lin Xun left, two suspicious figures emerged in the corner of the alley.When they saw the unconscious man on the ground, one of the two gloated. \u201cHow many is it now?\u201dThe other man counted with his fingers. \u201cThat little young master came to live here seven days ago and this is the nineteenth person who has fallen in his hands.\u201d\u201cHaha, the man on the ground is a clever person but why did he stupidly think to target that little young master? Doesn't he know how Boss Serpent died?\u201d\u201cHe has eyes but he failed to see properly. Who in this area doesn't know about the ruthless little young master in the no. 49 courtyard and how he kills without hesitation?\u201d\u201cOkay, it's time for us to act.\u201dWhile speaking, the two stooped down and searched the unconscious man, who was called Rotten Head Zhang, and found a dozen of copper coins. Then, they left happily.Deep in the alley, Lin Xun pushed open the door into the No. 49 courtyard.Boom!A fist thrust through the air, generating a terrifying force and gust of wind that caused the air to boom and crackle.Lin Xun didn't move and only said helplessly, \u201cIt's me.\u201dSuddenly, the wind subsided and calmness was restored. Xia Zhi's delicate and slender figure appeared before Lin Xun.\u201cI know it's you, if it's someone else they would have died already.\u201d Xia Zhi stepped forward, instinctively took the cup of fragrant fruit puree from Lin Xun's hand, and turned around.<sub>Visit to elworld.com discover_new novels.</sub>Lin Xun smiled, shrugged helplessly, and entered the courtyard.The courtyard wasn't particularly big but in the center stood a huge locust tree. The treetop was lush green and dense, and spread out like an umbrella. On the other side were two rooms and a kitchen. After a deep clean and some tidying, it was rather neat and beautiful.In a room, a Nanling joss stick was lit. The light flamed brightly, producing wisps of calming aroma.Lin Xun hunched over the desk, flipping through the books he just bought, while Xia Zhi sat quietly on a stool and sipped the fragrant fruit puree.The two had arrived at Donglin City seven days ago, but they realized that the three hundred silver coins that Lin Xun had weren't enough to rent a good place to live in the city. Not only was it expensive to live in an inn but it was also crowded and not suitable in the long term.With no other choice, Lin Xun could only rent a courtyard in the slums, which was surprisingly cheap\u2014only thirty silver coins a year.It was only after seven days of living there that Lin Xun finally understood why the rent was so cheap. The area was too rough and chaotic, and was inhabited by all kinds of people.On their first day, a man nicknamed Snakehead came with a gang of scoundrels to collect protection fees.On their second day, when Lin Xun returned home from buying basic necessities, he discovered three dead bodies in their courtyard. When he asked Xia Zhi about them, it turned out that they were three burglars who tried to enter their house.On the third day, a group of people ambushed Lin Xun in the streets and tried to rob him.On the fourth day, Lin Xun saw a group of thugs trying to rob a woman and he immediately stepped forward to save her, only to find she was with the thugs.On the fifth day\u2026In short, in the seven days that Lin Xun had lived there, thieves, hooligans, thugs and murderers appeared like wild dogs smelling blood.Of course, all those people suffered miserable fates. Many had even vanished from the world. But Lin Xun knew that he couldn't deal with such people everyday and guarantee that nothing would happen to him and Xia Zhi.Most importantly, he didn't want Xia Zhi to grow up in such a dirty and dangerous environment.The reason was very simple\u2014He grew up in the dark environment of a mine prison. He had witnessed many cruel and deceitful tricks and violence since a young age and he had met many vicious and bloodthirsty people.Compared to those fierce people, the thugs who controlled the slums were as pure as a white lotus and as well-behaved as an innocent baby.Lin Xun knew that without Mister Lu, he would have been heavily influenced by the environment he grew up in. He would have been led onto a dark path and lost his human nature.Due to his experience growing up, he didn't want Xia Zhi to live in such a filthy and dark environment.However, he needed a large sum of money to move, which was impossible for him to achieve in the time being.So, the thing that Lin Xun was most concerned about was how to make money fast, not passing the district examination!<sub>The most up-to-date nov_els are published_here > elworld.com</sub>FavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 64": "Chapter 64\nJun 11, 2022Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 64 The Meaning of BattleIt was difficult to move an inch without money!Lin Xun deeply understood the meaning of this sentence after coming to Donglin City.Money was needed for clothing, food, housing and transportation. Additionally, as a practitioner, his spending was much higher than that of ordinary people.For example, ordinary people would be happy as long as they had something to eat, but practitioners must consume aeth grains and aeth vegetables as well as the blood and flesh of beasts to maintain their bodies' purity. And the cost of such items were terrifyingly high.Some cultivators from wealthy backgrounds would even solely consume aeth herbs and aeth pills to supplement their bodies' needs as to constantly sharpen and improve their cultivation base. Those valuable materials were not something that an ordinary practitioner could afford.Moreover, the clothes that cultivators wore, the horses and other animals they rode, the combat equipment they used and the cultivation techniques they required, all required huge amounts of money.Why else would there be the saying that children of poor families could only read while the rich learned martial arts?Only the descendants of wealthy families could concentrate on martial arts without having to worry about money and afford the items necessary for martial training.In contrast, even if poor people had the talent and constitution to cultivate, the lack of financial support and cultivation resources meant they wouldn't progress far on the cultivation road.Why did the district examination held in the empire attract so many cultivators to participate every year? Why would cultivators from poor backgrounds treat the district examination as an opportunity to leap over the dragon gate?It was because anyone who passed the district examination would be favored by many chambers of commerce, sects, clans and wealthy families and they would try to draw them to their sides by providing them with cultivation resources.Cultivators did everything possible for their cultivation but cultivation was absolutely impossible without money.In the seven days that Lin Xun had been in Donglin City, he had often gone out to familiarize himself and integrate into the life of the city as soon as possible.Those seven days made Lin Xun deeply realize the importance of money.Donglin City was different from the Qingyang Tribe in that it was far more bustling. Even if there were unimaginable cultivation resources in the city, it was extremely difficult to obtain them.This was especially the case for Lin Xun given that it was his first time stepping foot into a city. It wasn't easy for him to settle in this densely populated place where cultivators were as common as trees and the countless sects and forces were intricately and complicatedly linked.I need to make money!This is my top priority!Lin Xun thought to himself. Only when he had earned enough money could he move to a different place with Xia Zhi and obtain more cultivation resources. Then, he could live better in the Ziyao Empire.<sub>Visit elworld.com, for the best no_vel_read_ing experience</sub>Hunched over the desk, Lin Xun suddenly sighed.Xia Zhi raised her head and asked, \u201cWhat's wrong?\u201dLin Xun closed the book in his hand and shook his head. \u201cNothing.\u201dThe book was 'The Record of the Empire Landscape', which he had purchased from the Li's Bookstore. It was a book about the mountains, rivers and landscape of the Ziyao Empire.Lin Xun originally intended to investigate where the mine prison that he used to lived in was located but he could only find the Great Three Thousand Mountains. Further south of it was the territory of the Ziyao Empire's enemy\u2014Darkness Kingdom.Lin Xun remembered that he lost consciousness when Mister Lu pushed him into a mine of unfathomable depths and when he regained consciousness, he was already in the Great Three Thousand Mountains.This made him speculate that the mine prison was likely located somewhere in the Great Three Thousand Mountains.Unfortunately, the Great Three Thousand Mountain was too vast with mountains stretching endlessly. Even the 'Record of the Empire Landscape' had no detailed description of the area.However, the book was pretty useful because Lin Xun learned that he was living on the vast and boundless Cangtu Continent.The Ziyao Empire was only one of several empires on the Cangtu Continent.\u201cAre you still thinking about moving?\u201d Xia Zhi suddenly asked, frowning.\u201cYes.\u201dLin Xun nodded casually and opened another book. It was the 'Handbook of Cultivation Basics' and, as the name indicated, it provided knowledge on cultivation basics. The content was very simple but the sections were very well thought out.The book was divided into five parts based on the five great cultivation stages: True Martial, Spirit Dipper, Spirit Sea, Heaven Ascension and Cyclic Derivation.For example, the nine layers of the True Martial Stage from the first Qi Drawing Layer to the last Aeth Transformation were all explained.However, books could only provide theoretical knowledge and not training experience. They could help readers roughly understand the changes expected in that stage and what were the specific signs of breakthrough.Although the content was very simple, Lin Xun read it with great interest.\u201cThere's no need to move, I like it here,\u201d Xia Zhi stated as she picked up a book called 'The Official History of the Empire' and flipped through it.Lin Xun raised his head and glanced at Xia Zhi in surprise. \u201cDo you like it here?\u201d<sub>You can_find the rest of this_content on the elworld.com platform.</sub>Without looking up at Lin Xun, Xia Zhi responded, \u201cYou can fight anytime here. If you move places, it will be hard to find people to battle with. It will be boring.\u201dShe suddenly lifted her head and looked at Lin Xun with a serious expression. \u201cDo you know how I felt in Feiyun Village?\u201dLin Xun smiled bitterly as he could roughly guess what Xia Zhi was about to say.As expected, she continued, \u201cBored. I have analyzed my strength and came to the conclusion that my strength will gradually weaken without any battles.\u201dLin Xun was a little taken aback by her answer and he gazed intently into her eyes. \u201cDo you mean that your strength won't weaken with constant battles?\u201dXia Zhi nodded. \u201cMore than that, only battles can make me stronger. I don't need to practice, I don't need any cultivation arts. I only need to fight.\u201dLin Xun was flabbergasted. He suddenly realized a problem. He had always subconsciously treated Xia Zhi as a little girl and had always done everything he could to protect her despite knowing that she was entirely different to other children. But had he ever thought about what Xia Zhi actually wanted?At such a young age, she could effortlessly kill Wu Henshui who was at the eight layer True Martial Stage and could survive in the deep mountain forests where fierce and savage beasts roamed. Lun Xun had to admit that he wasn't as strong as her.So what does she actually need?Lin Xun had never thought about that question. He only knew that Xia Zhi liked to eat and sleep, and that she lived a simple and carefree life. But after hearing Xia Zhi's words, he realized that she had her own thoughts and a cultivation path that she wanted to follow. She had a life that she desired!Lin Xun pondered for a long moment and said, \u201cI understand\u201d, and then he scratched his head. \u201cIt's just that fighting means killing, do you know what this means?\u201dXia Zhi nodded. \u201cI only kill enemies.\u201dLin Xun smiled bitterly. \u201cBut we don't have many enemies.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dLin Xun thought again and fell silent. Do I really have no enemies?Of course I do!The person who took his Origin Aeth Artery and the owner of the giant hand that destroyed the mine prison and made Mister Lu's whereabouts unknown could be considered his enemies.It was just that Lin Xun was still far from getting revenge.\u201cYour enemy seems to be the brute warrior.\u201d Lin Xun suddenly remembered a Spirit Sea cultivator was trying to kill Xia Zhi when he first saw her.\u201cI remember him. When I become stronger, I will personally kill him.\u201d Xia Zhi's expression was calm and her voice was calm as though she was destined to do that.<sub>Visit to elworld.com discover_new novels.</sub>\u201cBattles\u2026battles\u2026\u201d Lin Xun hesitated. If what Xia Zhi needed was to battle, he currently couldn't help her.\u201cYou don't need to worry, I like to fight, but it doesn't mean that I can't survive without fighting,\u201d Xia Zhi stated seriously.Lin Xun let out a sigh of relief and he smiled. \u201cThat's good.\u201dXia Zhi suddenly raised the book 'The Official History of the Empire' in her hands and pointed to the paragraph on the last page. \u201cI fight to become stronger, and this person was born to fight. This is the difference between me and him.\u201dLin Xun curiously took the book to take a closer look and saw that the last paragraph read, \u201cI am born from the qi of heaven and earth and I live to battle. My glory is built on the blood of the enemy!\u201cIf I die, the battlefield will be my burial mound and the enemy's bones will be my coffin. I will rest my head on the mountain of corpses, lay in a sea of blood, face the sky and sleep with the earth. This way, I have no other regrets!\u201d\u2014\u2014The Iron Blood King of the Ziyao Empire.Those few sentences made Lin Xun's blood rush around his body and battle intent surged to his chest. He couldn't help but marvel, \u201cThe Iron Blood King has such a bold vision. His brilliance could compete with the sun and the moon, and he could vie for eternal supremacy!\u201dHe looked at Xia Zhi, who was sitting quietly, and said thoughtfully, \u201cYou are indeed different from him.\u201dA slight smile lifted the corners of Xia Zhi's lips and her beauty lit up the entire house.Fortunately, the smile disappeared in a flash.But even so, Lin Xun couldn't help reminding her. \u201cXia Zhi, you shouldn't show your face outside in the future.\u201dShe was only five to six years old, but her beauty was already too dazzling and could draw many unexpected disasters.Xia Zhi lifted her face and made an acknowledging sound.Lin Xun smiled and said nothing else. He turned around to face the desk, took out a rune brush, a swallow-winged blade, and a dish of completed rune ink.The rune brush was polished from the leg bone of an iron-beaked mountain pheasant. It was perfectly straight, slender and entirely pale purple. The body of the brush was heavy and simple and the tip was sharp and thin like a cicada's wings. It emitted a wondrous light and was named Violet Pheasant by Lin Xun.Lin Xun had bought the swallow-winged blade from a weapon shop in the city. It was entirely made from a rune material called rosy cloud steel but it was only considered an ordinary tool due to the absence of any engraved runes.That dish of rune ink was precisely scarlet fire rune ink, one of the more common rune inks on the market.

It constantly took in rune ink.His wrist nimbly moved as the tip of the brush dipped into the dish of bright red rune ink. All rune ink was absorbed into the brush.At the tip of the violet pheasant brush, the ray of light blazed like a flame, producing bright, blood-like beams of light.Those two steps were called drawing aeth into the brush and absorbing ink as the source!It tested the compatibility between a person's aeth power and the rune brush. The higher the quality of a rune brush, the more sensitive it was in drawing aeth power and the more ink it absorbed.Lin Xun wore an extremely solemn expression as he sat at the desk. His back was straight as a spear and his deep, dark eyes were completely focused on the swallow-winged blade on the desk. His mind was calm without the slightest ripple.Unhesitatingly, he lifted his brush from the ink. The razor sharp tip suddenly scraped the swallow-winged blade, producing a subtle but pleasant rustle.Strands of slender hair-like scarlet lines flowed out from the brush's tip and spread like ink blooming in a clear river. It was a mysterious and beautiful spectacle.Lin Xun's wrist constantly twisted and moved like a slithering snake as he made brush strokes in a precise, clean, and smooth manner.Despite it being Lin Xun's first time to truly engrave a rune pattern, he didn't feel a hint of nervousness.He had practiced it countless times in the past months and he had familiarized himself with the littlest details of each rune pattern as well as the key to each brushstroke.This was what he had learned from Mister Lu from a young age. He had to tackle various basic rune patterns every day during that period and so he had long observed and grasped the mysteries hidden beneath those complicated rune patterns.The explosive flame rune he was engraving was one of those basic runes. The arrow that killed Lian Rufeng and the others at Feiyun Village entrance was also engraved with the explosion flame rune.However, the explosive flame rune he was engraving was a little different because he was trying to create a true aeth tool!What was an aeth tool?A treasure that could fully coordinate with a cultivator's aeth power to display its mighty powers!The only difference between ordinary tools and aeth tools was that aeth tools were engraved with runes and, as a result, contained unbelievable powers.The explosive flame rune engraved on Lin Xun's arrow was only semi-completed and the quality of rune ink used was at most mediocre. The arrows had to be scrapped after one use and were only considered to be semi-aeth tools.<sub>Try the elworld.com platform_for the most advanced_reading experience.</sub>This time, Lin Xun specially purchased a swallow-winged blade and a plate of high quality scarlet fire rune ink so that the engraved explosive flame rune would be complete and integrated with the swallow-winged blade.Only then would it be called a true aeth tool and display its mighty powers in a cultivator's hands.Although Lin Xun had already grasped the mysteries of engraving the explosive flame rune and had practiced countless times in the past, he still dared not be careless.The reason for him being cautious was very simple. The process of creating an aeth tool seemed simple\u2014it only needed a vessel, which was the tool for which the rune pattern would be engraved on\u2014but there were strict requirements in each stage of the process.It had been universally acknowledged that a rune master had to possess a Spirit Dipper cultivation base to be able to support the engraving of a complete rune pattern and forge an aeth tool.Otherwise, the lack of aeth power would leave the rune engraving unfinished and it would be impossible to create a true aeth tool.Now, Lin Xun only possessed a cultivation base of the Essence Refining Stage, the fifth layer True Martial Stage, and was still a distance from the Spirit Dipper Stage.Fortunately, the engraving of rune wasn't a test of a practitioner's cultivation level but instead the amount of aeth power within a cultivator's body. Lin Xun's strong aeth power foundation made up for his shortcoming in cultivation level.As a matter of fact, the aeth power within Lin Xun's body was indeed tremendous, strong and incredibly pure. It was the product of the four rune vortexes within Lin Xun's heart.After Lin Xun's aeth power underwent refining as it passed the four Aeth Power Vortexes, his cultivation level was no different from other fifth layer True Martial Stage. But the purity and strength of his aeth power was far superior to those of other people.This was why Lin Xun had the confidence to attempt to create an aeth tool despite only possessing a cultivation base of the fifth layer True Martial Stage.Chi\u2014The blazing flame-like brush tip constantly drew across the surface of the swallow-winged blade, leaving several fine marks.As time passed, Lin Xun's spirit perception and aeth power reached a perfect harmony with the violet pheasant brush, unrestricted and unhindered by anything.His aeth power was constantly consumed with time but it was still far from being a problem.Lin Xun, who was fully concentrated on engraving runes, failed to notice the beam of light flash across the Omega Door standing silently in his mind-sea.Lin Xun had completed the last mark of the explosive flame rune. As he lowered the brush tip down, an imperceptible aura silently gathered within the tip.At that moment, Lin Xun felt as though a giant invisible hand had clutched his wrist and he subconsciously rotated the tip of his brush. The last rune mark slipped out his hand without any obstruction.But when he lifted his hand and studied the completed explosive flame rune pattern, he couldn't help but feel astonished. It looked familiar but there was a hint of unfamiliarity that he couldn't put his finger on.Could there be a problem?<sub>The most up-to-date nov_els are published_here > elworld.com</sub>Before Lin Xun could investigate further, a buzz caught his attention. Millions rays of dazzling flame-like light roared to the sparkling clean surface of the swallow-winged blade. Then, everything immediately returned to normal.When Lin Xun looked at the blade's surface again, it had become a faint scarlet color and the tip was much sharper than before. It seemed to have gained a spiritual nature.Endless joy filled Lin Xun's heart. He picked up the blade without any hesitation.Boom!As he instilled aeth power into the swallow-winged blade, a blinding fire light shot out and illuminated the entire house. As he waved the blade around, it boomed and crackled like lava was erupting.He succeeded!Lin Xun's eyes lit up and his mind wandered.He was certain that the swallow-winged blade had been transformed from an ordinary tool into a true aeth tool. There was no doubt about it.But Lin Xun had never expected to succeed on his first attempt!Mister Lu had once said that rune masters would inevitably suffer failure when forging aeth tools and that even experienced rune masters wouldn't be able to guarantee success on their first attempt.In other words, failure was normal when refining aeth tools and non-failure wasn't normal!Why else would aeth tools be worth so much on the current market?Aeth tools were a product of repeated failures, which would not only waste rune materials and rune ink but also a rune master's effort!In general, rune masters would think it was impossible for a rune apprentice like Lin Xun, who possessed only a cultivation base of the fifth layer True Martial Stage, to create an aeth tool.However, Lin Xun not only refined it, but he succeeded at one go!Lin Xun was also perplexed by his own success. He had prepared three sets of ink and a blade in case he failed.Who would have thought that he didn't need to use the backups?It was too unexpected!Lin Xun stared intently at the swallow-winged blade in his hand, and all sorts of emotions welled up in his heart. No, it should be called the Explosion Blade now.Who would have thought that he, a rune apprentice at only the fifth layer True Martial Stage, could create an aeth tool and also succeed at his first try?<sub>Foll_ow new_episo_des on the elworld.com platform.</sub>How would other rune masters feel when they learned about his feat?As Lin Xun thought about it, a ruminative smile crept to his lips. In the end, he shook his head and decided to never reveal this matter to anyone unless he was threatened with death.The taller the tree, the more likely its top would be damaged by the wind. Lin Xun had understood this saying long ago. He realized that his feat would undoubtedly bring him unexpected disturbances.\u201cI'm going to rely on you to become rich\u2026\u201dLin Xun muttered as he gazed at the Explosion Blade. He had decided to sell the blade tomorrow!In order to create an aeth tool, Lin Xun had purchased three sets of swallow-winged blades and scarlet fire rune ink, costing him sixty silver coins in total.After renting the house for thirty silver coins and buying necessities and food over the past seven days, Lin Xun only had one hundred and thirty silver coins left from the three hundred silver coins he had brought to Donglin City.If he didn't make money as soon as possible, he might become penniless.Fortunately, the Explosion Blade, an aeth tool, could be sold for a good amount.Although Lin Xun didn't know about the specific price, he knew that even the most damaged aeth tool was worth more than fifty silver coins!\u201cThis blade is better than the one you have, are you really going to sell it?\u201dIt was Xia Zhi's voice.Lin Xun was surprised to find Xia Zhi still awake at midnight and had been sitting next to him all that time.\u201cThis is an aeth tool and it can only display its full power in the hands of a Spirit Dipper cultivator.\u201dLin Xun casually said, \u201cOf course, my strength will still no doubt be greater with the Explosion Blade compared to the Skybreaker Blade. After all, it's an aeth tool and ordinary tools can't be compared to it.\u201dLin Xun couldn't help but sigh, \u201cIt's a pity that we need money now, so it's best to sell it first. I will make another one when I have the chance.\u201dXia Zhi said thoughtfully, \u201cBut I think the materials that make up your blade are very strange. It's best that you keep your blade.\u201dLin Xun couldn't help feeling moved. Of course he knew that the Skybreaker Blade was extraordinary. Mister Lu had personally gifted him the blade as a weapon for self-defense. Mister Lu had mentioned that the blade was made from incredibly rare and special materials so even he couldn't engrave a rune pattern on it.This fact alone demonstrated the uniqueness of the Skybreaker Blade.It was also because the Skybreaker Blade hadn't yet been refined into an aeth tool that the unique materials that made it up remained buried.<sub>New_chap_ters are pub_lished on elworld.com</sub>What astonished Lin Xun was that Xia Zhi was able to identify the extraordinary features of the Skybreaker Blade.FavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

His fist repeatedly whistled through the air and created shock waves.Although the Marching Army Fist was an art widely known throughout the empire, very few people had mastered it to the extent that Lin Xun had.It was just a pity that he still hadn't reached the perfect realm.He had skilfully grasped the essence of the fist art, but he lacked a unique martial arts spirit and style that belonged to him.Lin Xun knew well that he had to further sharpen his skills through real battles if he wanted to make a breakthrough. Only the flames of combat could temper the spirit of a fist art.He practiced for a full hour and only stopped to rinse himself when his blood and qi were roaring and rumbling like boiling water. After eating breakfast with Xia Zhi, he left with a sack.He was planning to sell the Explosion Blade that he had made last night.Xia Zhi was left alone at home. She had no interest in anything in Donglin City except for reading so Lin Xun had bought her several books that would last her days.Even in the morning, the slum area was dark as usual, and the dilapidated buildings that were randomly built formed several long and narrow cobweb-like alleys.Walking through the alleys felt like being a labyrinth.Fortunately, Lin Xun had a good memory and didn't get lost once. But before he got far into the labyrinth, he felt something was wrong and halted slightly. \u201cFriends, if you don't come out now, don't blame me for being rude.\u201dBefore his voice died away, two figures frantically rushed out from a corner of the alley.It was two men\u2014one fat and one skinny. \u201cLittle young master, please don't be angry. We were waiting here to discuss something with you.\u201d The fatty cried out as hurried over to Lin Xun.Lin Xun raised his brows. \u201cWhat is it?\u201dThe fat man hesitated and glanced at the thin man beside him.The thin man rolled his eyes and gave an ingratiating smile. \u201cLittle young master, to tell you the truth, ever since you killed Boss Snake a few days ago, some people have begun to disregard the rules and many despicable things have happened lately. Many brothers and sisters who live nearby also don't dare to voice their anger.\u201dLin Xun didn't know whether to laugh or not. He could immediately tell the two men weren't good people yet they dared to complain to him about the despicable things that other people had done.\u201cWe were thinking that this area can't continue without a leader, so we want to ask you, little young master, to come forward and take control of this area.\u201dThe thin man quickly added, \u201cOf course, we won't let you work for nothing. According to the usual practice, anyone who works in our area will have to present you with money or things of value every month. What do you say?\u201d<sub>Visit elworld.com for a better_user experience</sub>Lin Xun finally understood that the two men wanted him to play the role of 'boss', but he wasn't interested. Moreover, he didn't want to be connected with hooligans, thieves, thugs and that kind of people.\u201cSorry, I'm not interested,\u201d Lin Xun stated as he walked away.\u201cLittle young master\u2014little young master.\u201dAnxious, the fatty tried to stop Lin Xun, but when he met Lin Xun's gaze, he shuddered all over like he was threatened by a knife and dared not to make any other movements.\u201cLeave. I told you already that I'm not interested and I don't want to interfere in those affairs,\u201d Lin Xun said indifferently before he vanished into the depths of the alley.Both the fat and thin man slumped and sighed out loud.\u201cFatty Diao, what should we do? I don't want to turn to Boss Xiong. I had once offended one of Boss Xiong's relatives because of Boss Snake.\u201dThe thin man scrunched up his face bitterly.\u201cAfter Boss Snake died, Boss Xiong has been eager to act. He is going too far if he stretches his hand into our area as well.\u201dFatty Diao gritted his teeth. \u201cIt's a pity that the little young master doesn't want to get his feet into the muddy water. I really don't know what to do now.\u201dThe slums were very large. It covered over tens of miles and was inhabited by at least one hundred thousand people, most of whom were insignificant people considered at the bottom of society. Among them, there were many people of the Three Religions and Nine Schools as well as thieves, thugs, murderers and prostitutes.Naturally, criminal gangs emerged from them.The underground world in the entire slum area was completely controlled by over twenty criminal gangs and each one managed a specific area but territorial disputes still arose.For example, Boss Snake, who Lin Xun had killed a few days ago, was a gang leader in one of the areas and Boss Xiong was the gang leader of another area, but following Boss Snake's death, Boss Xiong had been looking for opportunities to rule the entire underground world.\u201cDamn it, we might really have to go seek refuge with Boss Lu,\u201d the thin man said through gritted teeth. \u201cBoss Lu is now one of the strongest forces.\u201d\u201cBeanpole Ma, are you stupid? Boss Lu is ruthless and greedy. If you work for him you are putting your life on the line.\u201dFatty Diao shook his head.The thin man was called Beanpole Ma. He muttered bitterly, \u201cThen what should we do?\u201d\u201cWhy don't you take refuge with me,\u201d a gentle voice sounded from a distance.A delicate little figure clad in a black wind-proof robe emerged. A hat concealed the figure's face.Naturally, it was Xia Zhi who Lin Xun had asked to stay at home and read.<sub>New novel_chap_ters are published here: elworld.com</sub>\u201cYou\u2014\u201dThe fatty looked startled. Despite the figure appearing mysterious, he could tell it was a little kid. His face darkened and he grinned sinisterly. \u201cLittle kid, you dare play a joke on me. Do you not want to live?\u201dBefore his voice even faded, a hammer slammed into his chest and sent him flying uncontrollably into the distance. He smashed into the ground so hard that his bones almost shattered but he could only scream in pain.Beanpole Ma froze with terror. Fatty Diao was sent flying before he even saw what happened.Xia Zhi stepped forward. Her indifferent and calm voice was filled with unyielding coldness as she said, \u201cFrom now on, I am the boss of this area and you are my lackeys. Do you have a problem?\u201dBeanpole Ma quivered uncontrollably. Even if he was possibly facing a child, fear gripped his heart, and he repeatedly shook his head. \u201cNo, no\u2014\u201d\u201cWhat about you?\u201d Xia Zhi shot a glance at Fatty Diao.Fatty Diao immediately stopped howling in pain and scrambled from the ground. \u201cI absolutely have no objection. From now on, we will be your loyal subordinates and will not hesitate to go into boiling water or walk on fire for you.\u201dXia Zhi lifted her hand and made a slapping motion in the direction of Fatty Diao. With a tragic scream, he tumbled to the ground like a gourd.Then, Xia Zhi uttered, \u201cI don't like to hear nonsense. If you want to stay on my side, obey my orders and you will be rewarded. If you make a mistake, you will be punished. Do you understand?\u201d\u201cUnderstood.\u201dTerrified, the fat man and thin man repeatedly nodded.\u201cGood, go tell all your comrades in the area that I am your boss from now on.\u201dXia Zhi nodded, turned around and left.Fatty Diao exhaled a breath of turbid air, his face contorted with fear. Then, he remembered something and cried out, \u201cBoss.\u201dXia Zhi halted her steps. \u201cIs there a problem?\u201dFatty shuddered as he mumbled, \u201cI just want to know what to call you from now on.\u201dXia Zhi pondered for a long while before she replied, \u201cChopstick.\u201d\u201cChopstick.\u201dFatty Diao and Beanpole Ma exchanged a glance with each other and kept the name in mind.It wasn't until Xia Zhi had completely disappeared from their sight that Beanpole Ma whispered, \u201cDo we really have to work for Boss Chopstick?\u201d<sub>The most up-to-date nov_els are published_here > elworld.com</sub>Fatty Diao rubbed his swollen and bruised cheeks and inhaled sharply. \u201cIdiot, didn't you see the slap I suffered just now. She only slapped the air but I already sustained such injuries. Only Spirit Dipper cultivators could achieve this and there are now at most six people in the slums who can do that.\u201dBeanpole Ma's eyes widened and he exclaimed in joy, \u201cWe are saved. Boss Xiong is only at the True Martial Stage. How can he be compared to our Boss Chopstick?\u201dA smug expression crossed Fatty Diao's face. \u201cOur Boss Chopstick may look like a child but she's a martial arts master. We might even become famous if we work for her.\u201d\u201cThen what are we waiting for? Hurry up and tell the others that we have a new boss,\u201d exclaimed Beanpole Ma.Fatty Diao nodded.What would Lin Xun think if he saw what had happened?In the most central location of Great Hundred Street.This was the most bustling core area of Donglin City. Magnificent buildings rose to the sky and the architecture had an ancient charm with the gray bricks, yellow tiles, painted pillars and carved beams.Bustling crowds endlessly passed the core area and every person was gorgeously dressed and emanated elegance.Dressed in coarse linen and lugging around a bag on his shoulder, Lin Xun inevitably was a bit of an eye sore.Occasionally, he would even receive disgusting and disdainful gazes. Many young and beautiful women immediately moved away when they laid eyes on him.This was not an exaggeration. The bustling Great Hundred Street consisted of the most money squandering establishments in the city. The shops, restaurants, inns and other stores set up on the street were completely unaffordable to ordinary people. Therefore, the majority of people strolling about were well-off or from wealthy families.Lin Xun's simple and clean style of dressing naturally was a symbol of poverty in other people's eyes.Lin Xun didn't seem to be aware of this. He raised his head and peered into the distance, where a dozen-foot high building stood.Stone Cauldron Alms.Lin Xun thought for a moment and finally decided to walk in.Although Mu Wansu had a poor attitude towards Lin Xun when he was in the Qingyang Tribe, she still helped Lin Xun with a huge favor. Lin Xun wanted to sell an aeth tool so the Stone Cauldron Alms was naturally his first choice to sell to.Moreover, Lin Xun didn't plan to sell just one aeth tool, he planned to make and sell more in the future. He believed that the Stone Cauldron Alms would be extremely interested and would perhaps even start a long term cooperation with him.After all, which merchant would refuse such a beneficial deal?In any case, Lin Xun offered such a beneficial deal to the Stone Cauldron Alms to repay their kindness and not because he was greedy for more benefits.Favorite<sub>Foll_ow current_novel on elworld.com</sub>Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

They all wore a warm smile and their manner was neither overbearing nor humble.Even Lin Xun, who was dressed in simple and plain clothing, was treated with courtesy. Their manners were excellent in every respect.A maid led Lin Xun to the treasure exchanging zone.Not long afterwards, a treasure appraisal master came out, chatted with Lin Xun and took the Explosion Blade for evaluation.After a long while, Wang Lin raised his head and exclaimed. \u201cThis Explosion Blade isn't bad. The condition and appearance is excellent. It's a top quality item among lower human grade aeth tools. Young Master, do you really intend to sell this treasure?\u201dLin Xun nodded with a smile.Wang Lin thought for a moment and then said, \u201cThis treasure is worth forty silver coins. Would you be satisfied with this price.\u201dLin Xun had just checked the Stone Cauldron Alms' aeth tools sales counter and noted that, in general, lower human grade aeth tools were roughly between ten to thirty silver coins.The price that Wang Lin quoted him was neither high nor low.But Lin Xun didn't particularly care about the price. The main purpose of his trip to the Stone Cauldron Alms was to establish a long term cooperation with them.However, a maid suddenly rushed over and gestured Wang Lin to one side. She whispered something to him and Wang Lin quickly went back over to apologize to Lin Xun. \u201cYoung Master, please wait a minute, I have an urgent matter to attend to.\u201dLin Xun nodded.Wang Lin hurried away. Lin Xun didn't have to wait long before he returned. Though he seemed a little distracted after his return.After a thought, Lin Xun directly asked, \u201cBig Brother Wang, about the aeth tool\u2014\u201dBefore Lin Xun could finish his sentence, Wang Lin waved dismissively and said, \u201cApologies, the Stone Cauldron Alms will not be making the transaction. Young Master, I hope you understand.\u201d\u201cYou won't?\u201d Lin Xun raised his eyebrows, looking a little surprised. Why did this guy's attitude change so drastically after he came back?\u201cI'm sorry. Young Master, please understand.\u201dWang Lin's attitude also turned lukewarm. Lin Xun's heart sank. As though he had speculated something, he forcibly suppressed his discontent, sprang up and said out loud, \u201cIf that's the case, I won't bother you anymore.\u201d<sub>The most up-to-date nov_els are published_here > elworld.com</sub>\u201cYoung Master, take care.\u201d Wang Lin's voice sounded cold and detached.\u201cDid Mu Wansu tell you to do that?\u201d Lin Xun suddenly asked.Wang Lin froze and his countenance changed. \u201cYoung Master, what do you mean?\u201dLin Xun took in his expression and came to an answer in his mind. He shook his head. \u201cNever mind.\u201dWithout any hesitation, he walked out the store in large strides.Wang Lin sat dazed for a while. Then, he let out a long sigh and got up.As Lin Xun walked along the bustling street, he turned his head back to look at the grand building of Stone Cauldron Alms. The corners of his lips quirked upwards in one corner.Lin Xun knew that Mu Wansu had always seen him as an eyesore, especially after he used Yan Zhen to suppress the Wu Corporation.But no matter what, he owed the Stone Cauldron Alms a favor. The favor could be regarded as the Stone Cauldron Alms and could also be regarded as Mu Wansu's.Therefore, Lin Xun wouldn't resent them just because he had received the cold-shoulder treatment. He just wanted to do business with them. He could just sell his blade to other people.\u201cMu Wansu is too petty. Is she not worried that I could shamelessly use Shi Xuan's badge to bother her again and again. What can she do to me then? Unfortunately, I'm not that thick-skinned.\u201dLin Xun shook his head in disappointment. \u201cNever mind. From her attitude, it seems that she intends to draw a clear line with me. If that's the case, I should keep away from the Stone Cauldron Alms in the future.\u201dLin Xun didn't worry too much about his situation. He strolled along the Great Hundred Street, surveying the various shops on both sides of the street.Very soon, someone called out to Lin Xun. He was an average-looking man but he exuded capability and steadiness.\u201cYoung Master, if I'm correct, you just offered your treasure for sale to the Stone Cauldron Alms.\u201d The man smiled as he gave a cupped fist salute. His voice, gentle and clear, gave a comfortable and refreshing feeling.The ordinary-looking man's amiable bearing, which was inadvertently revealed from his words and mannerism, made him seem very approachable and likable.\u201cCorrect.\u201d Lin Xun nodded.\u201cLet me guess again, you must have disagreed with the price that the Stone Cauldron Alms gave you so the transaction didn't go ahead in the end, is that right?\u201d the man continued, speaking clearly and smiling kindly.\u201cCorrect.\u201d Lin Xun nodded again. He had just carried a sack into the Stone Cauldron Alms and then came out with the same sack. Anyone who paid attention to his movements would have guessed what had happened.The man introduced himself with a smile. \u201cI am called Gu Yanping. I have just opened a store called the Golden Jade Hall. If you don't mind, why don't you take a look at my shop.\u201dLin Xun also smiled. \u201cShopkeeper Gu is so enthusiastic, I don't dare to decline your offer.\u201d<sub>You can_find the rest of this_content on the elworld.com platform.</sub>The two smiled broadly.The Golden Jade Hall was located on the west end of the Great Hundred Street and was relatively quiet compared to the bustling central core area.The Golden Jade Hall wasn't particularly huge and only consisted of a two-storey tiled building. But even if it couldn't be compared to the Stone Cauldron Alms in size, it was tidy, elegant and every part was original and unique.The only embarrassing aspect of the Golden Jade Hall was that Lin Xun saw not a single customer besides himself.Gu Yanping calmly smiled. \u201cThe store only opened less than ten days ago so we still have a small customer base. Please don't laugh.\u201dIt not only had few customers, but the number of items in the store could also only be described as sparse.Some counters were empty and had only the name tags of some items.Anyone who walked into the shop would wonder if it was just an empty shell.Those observations made Lin Xun deduce that the Golden Jade Hall couldn't be compared to the other businesses in terms of financial resources and background. The only benefit it had was that it was located on the Great Hundred Street.However, Gu Yanping's next sentence surprised Lin Xun.\u201cYoung Master, I know you have a lot of doubts in your mind. To tell you the truth, I rented this store, and the money I currently have could at most pay half a year's rent,\u201d confessed Gu Yanping.Lin Xun was stumped for words and could only respond a good moment afterwards. \u201cShopkeeper Gu, why did you tell me that?\u201dGu Yanping said righteously. \u201cHonesty is of utmost importance in business and my strongest point is my honesty. Honesty is a must if I want to expand the Golden Jade Hall so I don't want to hide anything from you.\u201dLin Xun nodded. He suddenly realized that Gu Yanping was a wonderful person. From the moment Lin Xun met him, he had shown an extraordinary power of observation. He treated people and served customers very well. He was sincere but careful, and nothing about him was unlikeable.\u201cIn that case, Shopkeeper Gu, can you take a look at my blade?\u201d Lin Xun handed over the Explosion Blade.Gu Yanping received it happily, carefully examined the blade and nodded. \u201cA superior aeth tool of the lower human grade. It should be worth between two hundred and three hundred silver coins.\u201dLin Xun remembered Wang Lin's appraisal from earlier, and so he couldn't help but nod. It seems that Gu Yanping's treasure appraisal skills are pretty good.He said casually, \u201cForty silver coins and the blade is yours.\u201dGu Yanping didn't expect Lin Xun to be so direct and straightforward. After a little thought, he said unwaveringly, \u201cThank you Young Master, but business is business. If I were to make an offer, it would be at least fifty silver coins.\u201dHe took out his coin purse and handed fifty silver coins to Lin Xun. \u201cYoung Master, please accept this.\u201dLin Xun silently put the money away and said, \u201cShopkeeper Gu, I believe that you are sincerely doing business with me. If I have another aeth tool to sell, I will think of the Golden Jade Hall right away.\u201d<sub>New novel_chap_ters are published here: elworld.com</sub>Gu Yanping smiled with a cupped fist salute. \u201cThen I have to thank you, Young Master, for taking care of the store.\u201dLin Xun nodded and bid farewell.\u201cFather, we don't have much money.\u201dAs soon as Lin Xun left, a young man came out and said helplessly, \u201cWhy are you still spending money like that? It won't be long before we have to close our shop.\u201dThe young man was called Gu Liang and was the only son of Gu Yanping. \u201cLiang'er, remember that business is not only about boldness and long term-vision but you also have to have the courage to burn your boats.\u201dGu Yanping disagreed with his son's view.After a pause, Gu Yanping continued unwaveringly, \u201cThe resources we currently have can't maintain our business through normal means. So we must take a risk. If we succeed then our Golden Jade Hall can establish a firm foothold on the Great Hundred Street.\u201dGu Liang couldn't help but argue, \u201cWhat if we don't succeed?\u201dGu Yanping fell silent for a moment before he calmly replied, \u201cThen we close up and leave. Ever since the old guys of Zijing City expelled me from the house, I have thoroughly understood one thing\u2014I have to rely on myself to do anything.\u201dHe picked up the Explosion Blade and went into the inner room.The mention of being expelled from the house made young Gu Liang's eyes suddenly blaze with fury. But it was only for a split second, and he very quickly restored tranquility to his features.Inside the inner room.Gu Yanping was focused and calm. He stood tall as he drew the blade with his left hand. As though he had become another person, his eyes glinted with absolute confidence like everything was under his control. A strange charm came to his average-looking face.Suddenly, Gu Yanping's hand opened up like a lotus flower and he folded his fingers together in a bizarre hand seal and pressed on the Explosion Blade.With a clear ring, flames bubbled up to the blade's surface like molten lava. They blazed brightly and dispelled the darkness within the inner room and made Gu Yanping's face glow red.\u201cWhat an amazing blade.\u201dAlthough it was a compliment, his expression remained calm and indifferent, without the slightest ripple. It was as though he had witnessed such a scene in the past.At the same time, he changed hand seals. He tapped his fingers against the Explosion Blade's surface in a unique rhythm.From the sharp tip of the blade, a shaft of gorgeous light burst forth like a sun pillar at sunset. It emitted an extremely dangerous aura as it flashed endlessly.\u201cWhat an amazing blade!\u201dGu Yanping marveled out loud, his usual calm and composed expression changing drastically.Favorite<sub>This_content is taken from elworld.com</sub>Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 68": "Chapter 68\nJun 11, 2022Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 68 Traces of EnemyGu Liang quietly waited.An hour had passed but there was a lack of movement and noise in the inner room. Gu Liang couldn't help but feel perplexed.Since the Golden Jade Hall had opened, his father Gu Yanping had already purchased seven items of treasures such as aeth armor, aeth spear and aeth sword...All were aeth tools for combat.However, the quality of those aeth tools were barely passable. Additionally, they were all common aeth tools on the market and so they still weren't sold now.Gu Liang couldn't help but worry whether his father's approach was feasible.But what worried him the most was the rent for the store and the money spent on purchasing the seven aeth tools because it had already drained his family's money.It wouldn't be long before the Golden Jade Hall would close down if they didn't change!At that time...I'm afraid we would have to pack up and leave, right?Gu Liang sighed. He had admired and looked up to his father since a young age and so even if he doubted his father's approach, he had never strongly opposed him.At worst, we will close up the store. As long as we don't die from starvation, there will be a chance to bounce back!Gu Liang drew a deep breath, dispelling the distracting thoughts in his mind. He had inherited many of Gu Yanping's good points and so he knew that sometimes it was best to do his best and leave the rest to the heavens. If he worried too much it would only make himself stressed and uneasy.The door to the inner room was suddenly pushed open and Gu Yanping came out.What surprised Gu Liang was that his father seemed to have become another person. His face was glowing and radiant like he had become years younger.\u201cLiang'er, the time has come for us to change our fortune!\u201d Gu Yanping laughed heartily.\u201cFather, what do you mean?\u201d Gu Liang frowned in puzzlement.\u201cThe Explosion Blade from the Young Master just now is extraordinary!\u201dAs Gu Yanping thought about when he verified the blade, his heart fluttered with excitement. \u201cIts power is twenty percent stronger than other Explosion Blades! Twenty percent! A lower human-grade aeth tool actually has the power of a mid human-grade aeth tool. In the entire world, is there another Explosion Flame Blade that can compare to it?\u201dGu Liang shuddered in surprise. \u201cIt really has twenty percent more power?\u201dFrom what he knew, Explosion Flame Blade was a very common kind of aeth tool on the market. It was impossible to increase its power by twenty percent even if the highest quality of materials were used to refine it!<sub>This_content is taken from elworld.com</sub>Explosion Flame Blade was created by a rune master and so its materials and rune pattern were fixed and couldn't be changed.In other words, the power of an Explosion Flame Blade couldn't be changed! Otherwise, it wouldn't be called the Explosion Flame Blade!This was the reason why Gu Liang was flabbergasted by what Gu Yanping said.Gu Yanping was also well aware of it, which was why he was astonished by the result and thought he saw it wrong when he tested the blade.But it turned out that it was all true!\u201cLiang'er, when I appraised the treasure, I used the Flying Aeth Treasure Inspection Art, you should understand what this means,\u201d Gu Yanping casually explained.Gu Liang froze. The Flying Aeth Treasure Inspection Art was a secret art handed down from generation to generation and there had never been any mistake in appraising treasures.\u201cThen it's actually true\u2026\u201dGu Liang muttered, \u201cIt's an ordinary Explosion Blade, but its power is twenty percent higher than normal. If this matter spread to other rune masters, it would no doubt create a sensation!\u201dGu Yanping sighed emotionally. \u201cI don't know who made this treasure. It's a pity that the young man left in a hurry, otherwise we could have found out more.\u201dGu Liang said with a smile, \u201cFather, the person who made such a treasure is likely an extraordinarily accomplished rune master. How would it be so easy to meet such a remarkable person?\u201dGu Yanping pondered for a long moment and shook his head. \u201cDon't mention this matter to anyone. Go and gather some people to spread the news that the Golden Jade Hall had acquired a peerless blade. Which hero would get their hands on such a treasured blade? Remember to chant this slogan!\u201dGu Liang rolled his eyes and then smiled like a little fox. \u201cPeerless blade?\u201dGu Yanping laughed. \u201cIsn't it? The slogan is a tactic commonly used by businesses to draw discussion and attract more attention.\u201dGu Liang nodded. \u201cI will take care of this matter.\u201dGu Yanping's eyes gleamed with confidence and he felt a sense of pride wash over him. \u201cWhether or not our Golden Jade Hall can establish itself in Donglin City depends on whether this move can start a huge momentum!\u201dThe Stone Cauldron Alms.After Lin Xun left, Wang Lin rushed towards the depths of the hall and made many turns and came to a secluded and quiet courtyard.In the courtyard stood a waterside pavilion and a little bridge over the flowing stream. Dressed in a black dress, Mu Wansu sat lazily in the pavilion flipping through an account book.<sub>You can_find the rest of this_content on the elworld.com platform.</sub>Her jet black hair tied up in a bun accentuated her fair neck and her soft, creamy skin, and the warm sunlight highlighted her flawless curves.Mu Wansun was undoubtedly a rare beauty.However, Wang Lin dared not glance at Mu Wansu as he walked into the courtyard. He bowed his head low and said respectfully, \u201cMiss Wansu, Lin Xun has left. I think he understood what our Stone Cauldron Alms wanted.\u201dMu Wansu closed the account book as a smile curved her plump and red lips. She said leisurely, \u201cI thought he would at least last a few days in Donglin City but it turns out that he has to come here to sell his aeth tools so soon. He seemed to have learnt that it isn't so easy to gain a foothold in Donglin City!\u201dMu Wansu suddenly asked, \u201cWhat was his reaction to all this?\u201dIn Mu Wansu's eyes, Lin Xun was a cunning and shameless little bastard. She didn't believe that he would obediently leave after receiving the cold shoulder.Wang Lin said in surprise, \u201cHe seems to know that it was all your arrangement. He didn't show much of a reaction when he left.\u201dMu Wansu strangely felt something was wrong, but she immediately shook off her worry with a toss of her head.She had been watching Lin Xun's every movement ever since he came to Donglin City.She knew that Lin Xun had to live in a filthy, dangerous and orderless place known as the slums due to financial constraints. She also knew that he seemed to be thinking about how to gain a foothold in Donglin City.Mu Wansu originally thought that Lin Xun was quite impressive despite him being cunning and shameless and that he might really be able to survive in Donglin City with his own means.However, when she learned that Lin Xun came to the Stone Cauldron Alms with an aeth tool, she knew he was in a desperate situation. Otherwise, how would he, a True Martial Stage cultivator, be willing to sell an aeth tool?Mu Wansu was not only delighted but she also gloated over his predicament. Is this the person who First Young Master regards highly of? Without the help of the Stone Cauldron Alms, it would be difficult to step anywhere in Donglin City. He's too useless. If First Young Master hears about this, I wonder what he would think.\u201cMiss Wansu, the treasure that Lin Xun came to sell seemed pretty good. It likely is remarkable and it would be a pity to pass on the opportunity.\u201dWang Lin couldn't understand what Mu Wansu was thinking. He was a treasure appraisal master, and so what he cared about was also related to his expertise.\u201cIt's just a lower human grade aeth tool, what's so special about it?\u201d Mu Wansu didn't think much of the item.\u201cBut from my examination, although the grade of the Explosion Flame Blade seemed ordinary, its appearance is different from other Explosion Flame Blades,\u201d Wang Lin quickly explained.Mu Wansu frowned, \u201cNo matter how different it is, it's still an Explosion Blade. Why are you so persistent? You're dismissed now.\u201dWang Lin inwardly sighed, shook his head and left.\u201cLittle bastard, I wonder what else you will sell after you sell the aeth tool. I won't let you take advantage of the Stone Cauldron Alms anymore\u2026\u201d<sub>New_chap_ters are pub_lished on elworld.com</sub>Mu Wansu grinned and continued to review the accounts.To her, what happened just now was a trivial matter and didn't deserve her attention. She was most interested in how long Lin Xun could survive in Donglin City.Lin Xun was unaware of what happened in Stone Cauldron Alms after he left, nor did he know that Gu Yanping and his son were elated and eager to act.After Lin Xun sold the Explosion Flame Blade and obtained fifty silver coins for it, he browsed the Eight Hundred Street in a joyful mood.A swallow-winged blade and a dish of scarlet fire rune ink were worth twenty silver coins, but the Explosion Blade that Lin Xun put some effort into to refine had been sold for fifty silver coins. His profit was more than double his cost!More importantly, he could continuously refine aeth tools in the future!This was the key reason that Lin Xun was in a good mood. He felt he was setting foot on a dazzling golden path of fortune.\u201cWhen I have enough money, maybe I should buy some blood refining pills and prepare to break through to the sixth layer True Martial Stage.\u201dLin Xun quickly calculated the cost. He had seen blood refining pills, which was a type of extremely precious aeth medicine, in the Stone Cauldron Alms of the Qingyang Tribe. They were worth around ten silver coins each.It was extremely expensive but it was normal because as a person's cultivation increased, the quality of the aeth medicines required also increased and so did the price.A cultivator at the first-layer True Martial Stage only needed to consume aeth grains and aeth vegetables, but such grains and vegetables wouldn't be effective once a cultivator broke through to a higher cultivation level.Moreover, aeth medicines didn't simply replenish aeth power but had other effects at different cultivation stages.Huh?A strange feeling suddenly surfaced in Lin Xun's heart, snapping him out of his rambling thoughts.His eyes darted around his surroundings but he only saw pedestrians moving along the street like flowing water. The street was bustling as usual and he didn't notice anything unusual.Suddenly, Lin Xun shook his head, turned around and walked into the depths of the alley on the side of the street.Just shortly after Lin Xun disappeared, two ordinary-looking men in ordinary clothes suddenly walked out of the crowd.They looked no different from the passers-by on the street, but their gaze simultaneously shifted to the alley that Lin Xun entered.\u201cOld Blade, the target seems to be aware of us. Should we continue to follow him?\u201d a dark-skinned man asked with a frown.<sub>Visit to elworld.com discover_new novels.</sub>FavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The alley was long and extremely narrow, being no more than ten feet wide. They ran into no one on their way and it was dark and humid even during the day.\u201cOld Dog, we should be extra careful. Although we work for money, once we lose our lives we will lose everything,\u201d Old Blade reminded. He still couldn't help but feel that something didn't feel right.\u201cHaha, he's just a kid from a remote village. Also, we are just following our target and not doing anything else.\u201d Old Dog disagreed.\u201cNo matter what it's better to be cautious,\u201d said Old Blade with a frown.\u201cOf course.\u201dOld Dog didn't think so but the next second, he immediately exclaimed, \u201cHow could that be? The target's scent suddenly disappeared...\u201dOld Blade was stupefied. His heart sank and he groaned inwardly.Bang!A dark shadow suddenly descended from above with incredible ghost-like speed.Old Blade could only see everything before him blur and then Old Dog violently shook and collapsed to the ground like lightning had struck down on him.\u201cHe wants to die!\u201dOld Blade swiftly reacted with a fierce roar. He drew his blade and charged forward.The shadow was, of course, Lin Xun. Before Old Blade could launch an attack, Lin Xun had already blasted towards Old Blade like a cannonball. At the same time, he extended his fingers, tightly clutched Old Blade's wrist and violently shook.Boom!A terrifying force slammed Old Blade's body like a torrent of water, causing his limbs and bones to vibrate to the extent that they almost shattered. And when the force finally subsided, blood wildly flowed from his nose and mouth.<sub>New novel_chap_ters are published here: elworld.com</sub>Then, he smashed to the ground with a loud thud and his vision blurred. Every part of his body ached with indescribable pain to the point that he couldn't push himself up from the ground.The fight broke out abruptly and ended in a flash. It was too unbelievably fast, direct and ruthless.Only then did Old Blade see his attacker and realized that it was the target they had been following.Old Blade had never thought that a thirteen to fourteen year old youngster would fight so fiercely and mercilessly. His combat methods didn't resemble a teenager's.Lin Xun stepped forward and said with a smile, \u201cTell me what I want to know. If you don't tell me, I'll ask him. If you cooperate, I can let you die happily.\u201d He pointed to Old Dog who had lost consciousness.With just one sentence from Lin Xun, Old Blade had realized that the youngster before him was no child!However, Old Blade refused to admit defeat and hissed through gritted teeth, \u201cDo you know who we are?\u201dKacha!Lin Xun smiled and said nothing. He stepped on Old Blade's hand with his toes until blood oozed out, flesh crushed and bones crumbled. Old Blade wanted to scream out in pain but a stone was stuffed into his mouth.As Lin Xun watched Old Blade make a painful grimace, he remained calm and composed. He whispered, \u201cBelieve me, I have learned a lot of torturing methods since I was a child. At least one thousand. Don't tell me anything if you want to try them.\u201dOld Blade's expression dramatically changed and his body violently trembled from severe pain. His eyes were on the verge of cracking and oozing blood. As he stared intently at the youngster before him, his heart pounded.Kacha!Lin Xun was still smiling but Old Blade's hand had been crippled under his foot. Old Blade was in so much pain that he whined and hissed, and his face contorted fiercely.The youngster appears warm and gentle and seems like he would never hurt any living creatures but his ruthless means are more ruthless than those used by executioners!How is he a mere boy? He is clearly a little devil!When he saw Lin Xun crouch down and take out a short azure blade to torture him, he almost collapsed as fear drowned his head. It made him nod frantically.Lin Xun smacked his lips in slight disappointment. \u201cI thought you were pretty tough. Who would have thought that you would yield before the torture even began?\u201dOld Blade's entire body twitched violently. He hadn't started the torture yet?Lin Xun's smile faded from his lips as he studied Old Blade calmly. \u201cIn that case, I will no longer make things difficult for you. I will ask you questions and you will answer. Understood? I hope you won't deceive me. I will ask your companion to answer these questions again later. If your answers are different, you know what the consequences are, right?\u201dOld Blade had completely given up putting up resistance and nodded.When Lin Xun walked out from the other end of the alley, two dead bodies had appeared in the dark alley and it wouldn't be long before they would be devoured by wild dogs.<sub>This_content is taken from elworld.com</sub>Lin Xun didn't care.Carrying the preserves, aeth fruits, roasted meat and all sorts of snacks he bought from the street vendors, he strolled home.The warm sunset light brushed past the top of the alley. A ray of light squeezed into the alley and dispelled the darkness and bathed the thin figure of the youngster in a warm glow.Anyone who saw such a handsome and gentle young man would never have thought that he was the one who ended two people's lives in such a cold and ruthless way.The young man was Lin Xun.Having been brought up in a dark environment, Lin Xun was destined to be different from his peers.\u201cLian Fei\u2026the Wu Clan\u2026\u201dLin Xun organized his thoughts as he walked.Old Blade and Old Dog had already disclosed everything and so he knew that the Wu Clan had been targeting him from the first day that he came to Donglin City.This surprised Lin Xun a little. The Wu Clan was the family of Wu Henshui and also the force behind the Wu Corporation in the Qingyang Tribe.After the Stone Cauldron Alms' warning, Lin Xun thought that the Wu Clan wouldn't dare to bring him trouble even if they hated him, but it seemed like the Wu Clan hadn't given up.According to Old Blade, the Wu Clan contacted Lian Fei and they plotted together on the first day that Lin Xun entered Donglin City.Their plot was very simple\u2014get rid of Lin Xun!Only that the Wu Clan didn't act in person and gave Lian Fei full control while they stood behind him and provided him with all financial support and resources.This was what surprised Lin Xun. Lin Xun didn't think that the Wu Clan would ask Lian Fei, who was the son of Lian Rufeng, to deal with him.But after a deeper thought about it, Lin Xun understood why Lian Fei agreed\u2014Lin Xun had killed his father!Would Lian Fei not want to avenge his father?\u201cPush the wolf out to swallow the tiger? What a good plan the Wu Clan has!\u201dLin Xun smiled coldly. He could clearly tell that the Wu Clan was afraid of the Stone Cauldron Alms and wanted to avoid dealing with him in the open so they used Lian Fei's hands instead.Old Blade and Old Dog were intelligence gathers hired by Lian Fei. They were ordered to follow Lin Xun and provide him with information for his next operation.According to Old Blade, Lian Fei had hired many desperate criminals with the financial support from the Wu Clan. Those criminals only cared about money and would not hesitate to assassinate Lin Xun with the right opportunity!Lin Xun wasn't afraid of Lian Fei and the others, but when he thought about how they had been plotting to kill him and that assassins could appear at any time, he felt his head throb with pain. It's hard to prevent thieves forever.<sub>Visit elworld.com for a better_reading experience</sub>However, Lin Xun learned that Lian Fei was only fifteen years old and already possessed a cultivation base of the fifth layer True Martial Stage. He was a student at Donglin Academy and had been focusing on the district examination for the past month. This was why he hadn't personally acted already.Based on this information, Lin Xun speculated that if Lian Fei really wanted to kill him, he would wait until after the district examination was over in a month.But that was just Lin Xun's speculation. If Lian Fei knew that Lin Xun had seen through his plan, he might decide to take action early.\u201cIt seems that I have to hurry up and gather some information about the Wu Clan and Lian Fei\u2026\u201dMurderous intent surged into Lin Xun's heart. He hated being targeted and being plotted against. Since the Wu Clan hadn't given up, how could Lin Xun just sit and do nothing?However, the enemy was hiding in the dark while he was exposed. He knew little about the Wu Clan and so his priority now was to first understand the real situation and plan carefully before taking action.While contemplating, Lin Xun arrived at the door to his house. He shook his head, dispelling the distracting thoughts. Then, he pushed open the door.Huh?Lin Xun immediately saw two figures in the courtyard, one fat and one thin. Suddenly, his eyes turned chilling and murderous intent filled them.The fat man and thin man both turned their heads and saw Lin Xun. An ingratiating smile simultaneously came to their faces. However, when they met Lin Xun's icy blade-like gaze, their faces stiffened and they couldn't help but shudder with terror.\u201cWhat are you two doing?\u201dLin Xun recognized the two men. It was Fatty Diao and Beanpole Ma. He immediately calmed down and his killing intent subsided.Fatty Diao and Beanpole Ma breathed a sigh of relief. They respectfully bowed together and said loudly, \u201cPaying respect to Master Chopstick!\u201dBoss\u2026Chopstick?The title stupefied Lin Xun. Isn't this title really bad?Lin Xun swept a glance over the two and then looked at the tightly closed door. A thought came to his mind and he headed straight towards the doorHe pushed open the door and, as expected, saw Xia Zhi sitting at his desk and reading quietly.\u201cWhat is happening?\u201d asked Lin Xun.He knew that the two men couldn't possibly break into their house if Xia Zhi was around, which meant that Xia Zhi was the one who let them in.\u201cThey are your subordinates.\u201dXia Zhi set down the book in her hand, thought for a moment and said, \u201cI originally wanted to be their master but I found it too troublesome so I passed the role of master to you instead.\u201dLin Xun's face grew overcast when he saw the serious look on the little girl's face.<sub>This_content is taken from elworld.com</sub>He was most worried about Xia Zhi being influenced by the dark and filthy environment but she came into contact with the dark world on her own accord!How would she not follow their bad examples if she became connected to ruffians, hooligans, gangsters, criminals and the underworld?FavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She refused to yield an inch.It was only when the atmosphere within the room became a little suffocating that Lin Xun sighed out loud and said, \u201cLet's eat dinner first.\u201dHe turned around and started to set the table, spreading out the preserved fruits, aeth fruits, roasted meat and a variety of snacks.Then, the two ate in silence.The very sumptuous meal felt tasteless to Lin Xun as if he was eating wax .

We have to solve the problem ourselves this time.\u201dA cold intent flashed deep in Xia Zhi's eyes, but vanished immediately. Then, she nodded.After dinner, Xia Zhi got up and told Lin Xun that she was going for a walk.Lin Xun was hesitant to ask what she was going to do, but he could somehow guess what she intended to do and so he could only sigh inwardly.However, Lin Xun wasn't worried about Xia Zhi encountering any danger because she was stronger than the average person and even he was no match for her. He believed that, as long as she was careful, she wouldn't run into any danger against the bad people in the slum area.Lin Xun shook off such thoughts with a toss of his head, took out a swallow-winged blade and a dish of scarlet fire rune ink, and fully focused on making an Explosion Blade.Lin Xun had found a good way to make money after his profits today at the Golden Jade Hall. His top priority now was to quickly make money to improve his cultivation level.Three hours later.The swallow-winged blade suddenly lit up on the desk as wisps of blinding flames surged upwards and rumbled like molten lava.He had succeeded once again!Lin Xun couldn't help nodding in satisfaction as he studied the Explosion Blade in his hand.\u201cIf Mister Lu hears about how I successfully made lower human grade aeth tools on the first try when I'm just at the fifth layer True Martial Stage, he would surely be delighted.\u201dInexplicably, when Lin Xun thought of Mister Lu, he also thought of the giant hand that destroyed the mine prison.After a while, Lin Xun suddenly picked up the violet pheasant brush again and on the Explosion Blade's handle engraved a rune marking that looked like the ancient character \u201cXun\".Lin Xun remembered that every time Mister Lu engraved a rune pattern, he would leave a similar mark, which, according to Mister Lu. represented him and was also a unique symbol that belonged to a rune master.The mark identified the owner of the engraved rune.The character \u201cXun\u201d that Lin Xun had engraved wasn't only his name, but in a sense it represented his will. He was determined to find the enemy who took his Origin Aeth Artery!<sub>Visit elworld.com, for the best no_vel_read_ing experience</sub>It was late at night but Xia Zhi still hadn't returned. Lin Xun was sitting cross-legged on the bed, circulating aeth power around his body, but he was a little worried.Fortunately, Xia Zhi had returned just as Lin Xun finished his training.As usual, she was wearing a black wind-proof robe and her stunningly beautiful face was covered.Lin Xun carefully looked up and down at Xia Zhi and after confirming that she was uninjured, he said, \u201cYou should come back earlier in the future.\u201dXia Zhi acknowledged him, went to wash up, and then she lay quietly on the bed.Lin Xun blew out the candle, plunging the room into darkness. Only a little faint starlight penetrated through the window and sprinkled dim patches of light into the room.Occasionally, the barking of dogs sounded from the alleys and made the atmosphere in the house quieter.\u201cLin Xun, I killed a gang leader from another area.

I have told them to exchange them all for money. Aren't you short on money? They will directly deliver the money over here tomorrow.\u201dLin Xun was training and visualizing his spirit, and so he didn't hear what Xia Zhi had said.Xia Zhi didn't seem to care if Lin Xun heard her or not.

Fatty Diao has confidently promised to find out everything about them tomorrow.\u201dHer eyes were as clear as cleanly washed black jewels and her voice was particularly pleasant and clear in the quiet and dark night.\u201cNo matter what, you don't have to worry about anything anymore as long as I am around. Do you think I couldn't tell that Mu Wansu's attitude towards you wasn't good? She's so narrow-minded. One day, I will teach her a good lesson. But before then, you mustn't get as angry as you did today\u2026\u201dXia Zhi's voice turned a little low and she seemed a little downcast.After a long silence, a faint, imperceptible voice floated in the darkness. \u201cMy name is Xia Zhi. My world has always been dark but you made me see a glimpse of light\u2026\u201dLin Xun's mind-sea was equally dark and only a bright star was hanging in the sky.It was the first star that he lit up in his mind-sea. It sprinkled down a pure, shining, silvery light that nourished his spirit.The star was also called the spirit star.The more spirit stars illuminated, the more beneficial it was to a person's spirit cultivation.Only when the spectacle of the great emptiness of the universe and the cycle of stars emerged in the mind-sea would the first Star Cycle be regarded as cultivated to the perfect realm.<sub>You can_find the rest of this_content on the elworld.com platform.</sub>However, Lin Xun's spirit had only barely touched upon the Star Cycle. Only one spirit star had been illuminated; it was too early to even mention reaching the perfect realm.Swiftly and silently, strands of starlight fluttered like ripples and nourished the spirit.At that moment, Lin Xun's spirit felt light, pure and untainted. Additionally, he could distinctly feel his perception power constantly recovering.Lin Xun had not only consumed his aeth power but also exhausted his spirit perception power to make an aeth tool and during his daily training.In general, a rune master would need to rest for two to ten days after completing an aeth tool to restore their perception power.This wasn't a huge problem for Lin Xun because he could easily recover after a night of rest by visualizing the Star Cycle.Moreover, Lin Xun found that the constant consumption and recovery of his perception power turned out to be a kind of tempering on his spirit. The tempering effect even doubled when he trained after heavily exhausting his perception power.This was similar to breathing out stale air and breathing in fresh air. His spirit was constantly tempered and improved through the repeated consumption and recovery of his powers.Lin Xun distinctly noticed that when his perception power was restored, he somehow felt a sensation of fullness and was eager to move.He didn't suppress this impulse, and almost naturally, his perception power suddenly soared. In the blink of an eye, it flew to the distant starry sky.When Lin Xun awoke, he found that another dim and blurry star in the night sky had become bright and clear and was resonating with the first bright star.Lin Xun had illuminated another spirit star after more than two months since the first one!Buzzzz~At the same time, he felt his spirit numb and shudder. Like a new window had been opened, his spirit power was steadily climbing.He could only perceive things within a ten feet distance, but now, everything within twenty feet of him was accurately reflected in his mind!Furthermore, his eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind had become much more sensitive, and was able to detect even subtle changes within the surrounding air and dust.The entire world seemed to have suddenly changed with the addition of multiple layers to everything. Lin Xun couldn't help but feel enthralled.This was the awareness through subtle details. The reason why cultivators were strong was because they could see things invisible to ordinary people, perceive the mystery of the heaven and earth that ordinary people couldn't detect, and master the power that ordinary people couldn't grasp!By the time Lin Xun awoke from his meditation, the sky was turning bright and a new day had come.On that day, news that the Golden Jade Hall was selling a peerless treasured sword rapidly spread through the streets and alleys of Donglin City like leaves in a storm and created a sensation.Favorite<sub>For more_novel, visit elworld.com</sub>Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This itself was already abnormal.In Wang Lin's view, the \u201cpeerless treasured blade\u201d was just a promotion tactic but no ordinary businessmen could think of something like that.So, Wang Lin had to check out the Golden Jade Hall.The Golden Jade Hall had announced that they would reveal the true face of the \u201cpeerless treasured blade\u201d at noon, and so, Wang Lin wanted to find out who the owner of the store was and whether the rumors regarding the blade were true.A gorgeous, jewel-adorned carriage pulled by four golden-mane white deer clattered across the street and came to an abrupt halt next to Wang Lin.The curtains inside the carriage were lifted up, revealing a kind-looking middle-aged man. He said with a smile, \u201cAren't you Brother Wang Lin from Stone Cauldron Alms?\u201dWang Lin indifferently gave him a cupped fist salute. \u201cNice to see you here, Manager of Boundless Treasure Pavilion.\u201dThe kind-looking middle-aged man was called Xiao Yuanzhong and he was the boss of Boundless Treasure Pavilion, one of the largest mercantile businesses in Donglin City. He was known for being shrewd and unscrupulous.In addition, Boundless Treasure Pavilion and Stone Cauldron Alms were competitors, and so Wang Lin and Xiao Yuanzhong weren't on friendly terms.\u201cHaha, could Brother Wang Lin also be making a trip to check out Golden Jade Hall?\u201d Xiao Yuanzhong said with a smile.\u201cYes.\u201d Wang Lin nodded calmly. \u201cGolden Jade Hall has caused quite a stir yesterday and even I couldn't help but feel a little curious.\u201dXiao Yuanzhong agreed. \u201cThat's right. I heard that Golden Jade Hall only opened a few months ago. I thought it was just a little shop. Who would have thought that the owner would be that extraordinary?\u201dXiao Yuanzhong continued meaningfully, \u201cEveryone of the same trade in Donglin City has been alarmed. Brother Wang Lin, you should know that having one more powerful competitor is equivalent to competing with one more hungry wolf. I wonder what Miss Wansu would think about this situation?\u201dWang Lin shook his head. \u201cI can't read Miss Wansu's mind.\u201d<sub>The source of this_chapter; elworld.com</sub>Xiao Yuanzhong acknowledged his response with a nod and then he smiled and bid farewell.\u201cIt seems that Golden Jade Hall has already made other merchant businesses increase their vigilance. It likely won't be easy for Golden Jade Hall to gain a foothold in the future,\u201d uttered Wang Lin ruminatively.Today, Great Eight Hundred Street was particularly bustling. In addition to ordinary people, cultivators were also flocking to Golden Jade Hall.All that Wang Lin heard along his way were discussions about the peerless treasured blade. It seemed that not everyone believed in the rumors and some were doubtful, but that only made people more curious.Besides Xiao Yuanzhong of Boundless Treasured Pavilion, Wang Lin also ran into many influential figures of other trading businesses, all of whom were well-known in Donglin City.For example, Wu Yongtai from the Wu Corporation and Shi Wenfeng of Profound Gold appeared to be mere business owners on the surface but a strong clan was supporting them both from behind.In addition to businessmen, Wang Lin also saw many Spirit Dipper cultivators, some of whom were high-ranking figures in Donglin City, such as Lei Qigong, a senior teacher of Donglin Academy, and Sun Zhan, the chief instructor of Violet-Gold Martial Arts Hall.Wang Lin sighed inwardly. The boss of Golden Jade Hall is indeed impressive to manage to attract so much attention with a little promotion tactic. He must be an expert businessman.However, Wang Lin also knew that there would be consequences if the so-called \u201cpeerless treasured blade\u201d turned out to not exist.The foundation of a business was credibility. If Golden Jade Hall dared to deceive the public in front of everyone, it would be impossible for them to gain a foothold on Great Eight Hundred Street!Wang Lin soon arrived at Golden Jade Hall.Everywhere was packed with people, and impenetrable crowds had long surrounded the store and filled the street with ceaseless clamor like the roaring of waves.\u201cPeerless treasured blade? What grade could it be? Human, earth or heaven? It can't be a pure yang aeth tool because that's a supreme treasure that only Cyclic Derivation cultivators could control!\u201d\u201cI think the peerless treasured blade can't be classified according to the known grades. The reason why it's called peerless may be that it has a very unique mysterious effect and power.\u201d\u201cHmph, it's too early to say. The Golden Jade Hall isn't huge, but the people there talk big. The peerless treasured blade is most likely a lie!\u201d\u201cHow is that possible? Which business would dare to joke around with that kind of thing? If it turns out to be a lie, Golden Jade Hall wouldn't be able to bear the consequences.\u201dStanding on the periphery of the crowd, Wang Lin intently listened to the discussions and he grew increasingly curious about how the owner of Golden Jade Hall would deal with the situation.The Golden Jade Hall had soared to fame but would it gain a foothold in Dongling City or did it stage a farce and end up packing up in embarrassment?<sub>Foll_ow current_novel on elworld.com</sub>Meanwhile, Lin Xun left his house and navigated the twists and turns of the dark alleys, leaving the chaotic slums.He was planning on stocking up on ordinary tools and rune ink to pave the way for him to continue in making aeth tools.The profit margin in making tools was tremendous. Additionally, the process of making aeth tools could help Lin Xun hone his rune art skills, which was extremely beneficial for him as he hoped to become a true rune master. It could be said that he was killing two birds with one stone.From what Lin Xun knew, some rune masters would choose to take refuge with major forces because they could hone their rune art skills while making aeth tools for them and get paid at the same time.Along the way, Lin Xun had heard news about the Golden Jade Hall's upcoming sale of a peerless treasured blade and he couldn't help but feel a little baffled.He had seen that Golden Jade Hall had limited financial powers and a weak foundation, and it was akin to an empty shell, so how would it have a peerless treasured blade for sale?Lin Xun was still perplexed after thinking about this deeply. Although he had sold an Explosion Blade to the Golden Jade Hall yesterday, it was just a lower human grade aeth tool and couldn't possibly be related to the \u201cpeerless treasured blade\u201d.Lin Xun shook his head. He had no interest in wasting time in following the crowds.Moreover, given Lin Xun's current financial situation, there was no way he could purchase the peerless treasured sword even if Golden Jade Hall had one for sale.Lin Xun walked into a shop on the corner of the street that specialized in selling ordinary tools.Meanwhile, inside Golden Jade Hall.Gu Liang was restless. It wasn't due to nervousness but excitement. The street outside their store was packed with people and the buzz in the street was sweeping into the store like waves. It made his blood bubble and he all fired up.He clenched his fists.

He couldn't help but shake his head when he saw his son's expression.\u201cUh\u2014\u201d Gu Liang scratched his head in embarrassment.\u201cWhen you gain more experience in the future, you won't lose your composure so easily. As they say, sages are calm even in major events. A qualified business cultivator must also possess such a character.\u201dGu Yanping wore a calm expression on his average face and said leisurely.Business cultivator!<sub>New_chap_ters are pub_lished on elworld.com</sub>The title for a cultivator who entered the Dao through business and pursued the cultivation path with wealth!This title stunk of money and was often despised and spurned by true cultivators, but in the young Gu Liang's eyes, business cultivation was the most sacred path!His father was a business cultivator and also the person he admired the most.In Gu Liang's view, only one person in the entire empire could be compared to his father\u2014the renowned master of Stone Cauldron Alms, Fortune God Shi!\u201cLet's go, don't let our customers wait too long.\u201d Gu Yanping turned around and strode out of the shop.Gu Liang hurriedly followed him.\u201cThey came out!\u201d\u201cIs that the boss of Golden Jade Hall? I thought he would be very capable. He's just an average middle-aged man.\u201d\u201cLook at the jade box in his hands. Could it be housing the peerless treasured blade?\u201dWhen Gu Yanping and his son emerged from the shop, the crowd that had been waiting in front of Golden Jade Hall for ages broke into clamor.Wang Lin narrowed his eyes and carefully studied Gu Yanping, only to find that he was very unfamiliar looking. He didn't recognize him.However, his relaxed and calm bearing was indeed superior to that of ordinary people.Wang Lin was also full of anticipation. Could the boss of Golden Jade Hall really have a peerless treasured blade?It wasn't only Wang Lin, Xiao Yuanzhong and other influential figures from major businesses in Donglin City were also furtively watching the scene.As Gu Yanping waved his hand, the buzzing atmosphere immediately calmed down.Without any opening remarks, Gu Yanping directly opened the jade box and took out an aeth blade glistening all over with a scarlet luster.The blade was three feet and four inches long and around three fingers wide.Shua!All eyes were fixed on the blade, but when everyone saw the blade and the aura around its edge, the atmosphere instantly stilled. Many people's expressions changed, turning to surprise and disbelief.<sub>This_content is taken from elworld.com</sub>Before Gu Yanping could say anything, someone thundered, \u201cWhat an unscrupulous businessman!

They thought the peerless treasured blade would be magnificent but it turned out to be an Explosion Blade, which were commonly seen on the market. The Golden Jade Hall not only lied to them but played them like monkeys!Even the bosses of major businesses were a little surprised. The owner of Golden Jade Hall doesn't look stupid, so why would he do something so stupid and dig his own grave?However, some influential people were shrewd enough to realize that the situation wasn't as simple as it seemed. Therefore, they didn't get angry and simply watched on.If Golden Jade Hall disappeared from Donglin City, they would lose a competitor.However, what if that wasn't the case?It was best to not express an opinion until a definitive conclusion was reached.Wang Lin was also among those people, but he was different in that he was struck dumb when he saw the Explosion Blade.It wasn't because the blade was magnificent but that he had personally appraised it in the past!The blade was precisely the Explosion Blade that Lin Xun brought to Stone Cauldron Alms for sale. He was certain that he wasn't mistaken because when he appraised the blade, it exuded a unique aura despite it being an Explosion Blade.Unfortunately, before Wang Lin could examine the blade further, Mu Wansu had ordered him to turn Lin Xun away.Although reluctant, Wang Lin had to follow Mu Wansu's orders, particularly since she was unyielding in her decision.Who would have thought that the Explosion Blade would reappear in Golden Jade Hall?! Furthermore, the owner of Golden Jade Hall was promoting it as a peerless treasured blade!Thinking of this, Wang Lin felt humbled. He was certain that the owner of Golden Jade Hall was not an ordinary person or an unscrupulous businessman as everyone had said. He came to such a conclusion based on the buzz that the owner had created through impressive means.The fact that he dared to bring out the blade in public suggested it differed from other Explosion Flame Blades and had an extremely unique effect!What wonderful effect could it have?Besides feeling humbled, Wang Lin grew increasingly curious.<sub>Visit elworld.com, for the best no_vel_read_ing experience</sub>The shouting rang like waves, and all sorts of foul words came out. The situation had become extremely chaotic and was almost spiraling out of control.Gu Liang was standing on the steps and saw the entire scene. He suddenly reddened with fury and indignation as he had never experienced such a situation.Those short-sighted guys started to scold and curse without learning the specific details. They have gone too far!Gu Liang was about to refute when his father Gu Yanping stopped him.Gu Yanping remained calm and without a ripple of expression on his face. It was as though he was unaffected by the situation.His bright and sharp eyes swept the crowd like a knife as he said in a deep, \u201cWhether it's real or not and whether or not it deserves the name of peerless treasured blade will be clear after examination.\u201dAlthough his looks were exceedingly average, when he spoke, it was akin to a thunder striking down upon the world. His voice reverberated across the street and halted the clamor. Many ordinary people felt their ears buzz and blood bubble. Their expressions subsequently changed.The atmosphere also instantly stilled.That guy has a strong aeth power cultivation base\u2014he is clearly a Spirit Dipper cultivator!Many cultivators present were utterly dumbfounded. They suddenly realized that Gu Yanping was extraordinary. It was rare to see a shop owner with such an impressive cultivation base.His one sentence overawed the crowd and even Gu Liang was filled with admiration.\u201cFriend, dare I ask how you plan to verify the blade?\u201d asked someone. It was a cultivator who exuded dipper qi from all over his body. He was clearly someone powerful.Gu Yanping smiled and said confidently, \u201cIt's very simple. I know there are many people present that are in the same trade as I am. I want to invite them to take a look at the blade and then tell everyone the truth. I believe that no one will doubt my words after that.\"Many people couldn't help but nod. The suggested method was indeed pretty good.At the same time, many people cast glances to different areas, where the owners of major businesses stood such as Xiao Yuanzhong from Boundless Treasure Pavilion and Wang Lin.Wang Lin stood forward and was the first to speak. \u201cIf that's the case, we will accept your suggestion.\u201dMany people recognized Wang Lin as a well-known treasure appraiser from Stone Cauldron Alms and agreed that it would be fair if he came forward to appraise the Explosion Blade.\u201cI also don't mind taking a look to see what's so magnificent about the peerless treasured blade.\u201d A chubby, friendly-looking, middle-aged man stepped forward.It was Xiao Yuanzhong, the owner of Boundless Treasure Pavilion!Everyone was stirred once again when he stood forward.\u201cHow can our Wu Corporation be missing from such an event?\u201d\u201cHaha, our Profound Gold also don't mind helping out to find the truth for everyone!\u201dMore and more people came out, all of whom were well-known figures from major businesses in Donglin City.<sub>New_chap_ters are pub_lished on elworld.com</sub>Everyone felt much more at ease when they saw so many experts coming forward to verify the treasure.

You want to use us to help you solve your predicament?Impossible!As the representatives of major businesses in Donglin City, they naturally didn't want any more competitors.They had already decided to use the chance to make Golden Jade Hall disappear from Donglin City if they weren't satisfied with the result from the verification!The area outside of Golden Jade Hall was packed with people eagerly anticipating the result.As Gu Liang stood in front of Golden Jade Hall's entrance, his heart pounded strongly. He somehow felt that his father's approach wasn't quite right. How would the businessmen in Donglin City help us? They keenly hope to see Golden Jade Hall become a laughingstock.However, out of respect and confidence for his father, Gu Liang didn't panic in such a situation.Time passed bit by bit, but there was still no movement within Golden Jade Hall, and that made the crowd a little restless.Why would it take so long to examine an Explosion Blade?While everyone was losing their patience, movements were heard from within Golden Jade Hall and the first to step out was Xiao Yuanzhong, the owner of Boundless Treasure Pavilion.However, his mind seemed to have drifted away and his brows were furrowed. His usual kind face had changed into a solemn one.He walked out the store without uttering a word, squeezed his way through the crowd under the protection of guards, got into his carriage, and left in a hurry.Everyone stood dumbstruck. What happened inside Golden Jade Hall?Not long afterwards, the manager of Profound Gold, the manager of Wu Corporation, and a few other people came out. Every person wore strange expressions\u2014overcasted, perplexed and pensive.Like Xiao Yuanzhong, they also left without a word.Many intelligent people were able to guess what happened from their actions, though they couldn't be certain. But the majority of people were a little perplexed by the verification's result.At that moment, Gu Yanping and Wang Lin walked out side by side. Gu Yanping looked relaxed and was talking cheerfully while Wang Lin shook his head from time to time.\u201cI really didn't expect it. You have such discerning eyes to have obtained such a remarkable treasure,\u201d exclaimed Wang Lin.\u201cThank you for the compliment.

It's worthy of the name 'peerless'\u201d. With that, he turned around and left.The crowd broke into an uproar.An ordinary Explosion Blade could actually be called peerless?Gu Liang couldn't help but smile when he saw the look of astonishment and confusion on everyone's faces. The indignation and anger in his heart were instantly swept away and replaced by delight.Gu Yanping was as calm as always. Such a disposition was incredibly rare.Clang!A blade's cry rang throughout the streets as Gu Yanping drew the Explosion Blade. The blade was flowing with a dazzling fiery light.It drew the attention of everyone present. They were all eager to see how magnificent the blade was and whether or not it deserved the title of 'peerless'.\u201cThe mysteriousness of this blade can't be easily described but I can assure you that it is twenty percent stronger than other Explosion Blades and is even comparable to aeth tools at the intermediate human grade!\u201d Gu Yanping stated confidently.Twenty percent more powerful!His one sentence stunned the many cultivations present. As cultivators, they knew what it meant when an ordinary lower human grade aeth tool was twenty percent more powerful than usual.Most importantly, the blade was a lower human grade aeth tool yet it contained power comparable to that of an intermediate human grade aeth tool!This was indeed a rare sight to see, especially since the Explosion Blade was only an ordinary aeth tool. Yet, it could paradoxically exhibit unique powers. It undoubtedly deserved to be called peerless.At the very least, no similar aeth tool could be found in the entire empire!But everyone was more curious about who could create such a unique aeth blade.It was impossible for ordinary rune masters to achieve that. Rune masters could make high-grade aeth tools but it was extremely difficult to create an ordinary aeth tool of the lower human grade that was more powerful than others.Could this Explosion Blade be the work of a rune master?Only someone of a supreme level could possibly create a completely different kind of Explosion Blade?Many people thought to themselves.However, the thought that the creator of the Explosion Blade was an unknown rune apprentice had never crossed their minds.<sub>The latest_epi_sodes are on_the elworld.com website.</sub>FavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Some people were even willing to purchase the blade for eight hundred silver coins but a Spirit Dipper cultivator successfully bought it for three hundred silver coins in the end.Three hundred silver coins was already a ridiculous and unbelievable amount for a lower human-grade aeth tool.After all, aeth tools of that grade were generally worth around thirty to eighty silver coins on the market. Three hundred silver coins were enough to buy a high human-grade aeth tool.But anyone who understood the magnificence of the blade would know that the price of three hundred silver coins was worth it because the blade was unique and another one couldn't be found in the entire empire.Things that were rare were more precious. When an ordinary aeth tool possessed unique attributes, it would no longer be considered ordinary.Eight hundred silver coins was an enormous amount to Gu Yanping. After all, the Explosion Blade was an ordinary aeth tool and he was happy enough to sell it for three hundred silver coins.His action won praise from everyone present and built a good impression of him. The credibility of Golden Jade Hall also increased as a result.After today's incident, Golden Jade Hall had opened up new prospects in Donglin City, but if it wanted to truly stand firm, it had to carry on.All that was thanks to the Explosion Blade.As Gu Yanping sat in the inner room of Golden Jade Hall, he couldn't help but think about Lin Xun again. He muttered, \u201cStone Cauldron Alms had made an error of judgment and made me obtain a treasure that reversed my situation in Donglin City.\u201d\u201cFather, I have contacted the suppliers and they decided to sign an agreement with us!\u201d Gu Liang exclaimed as he rushed in.\u201cUh-huh.\u201d Gu Yanping nodded in a distracted manner and then he said, \u201cLiang'er, although we have opened up our paths, troubles will undoubtedly follow.

The young master is our savior, I will definitely complete the mission.\u201d<sub>The source of this_chapter; elworld.com</sub>Gu Yanping nodded. Then, he suddenly sighed, \u201cA treasure can only bring us temporary popularity. We have to have more treasures if we want to carry on our business and compete with people in the same trade. But things are easier said than done.\u201dAlthough the matter had come to an end, everything that had happened in Golden Jade Hall had only just started to ferment.In almost a few hours, the entire Donglin City had learned that the so-called peerless treasured blade that Golden Jade Hall sold was an Explosion Blade.However, it was that common Explosion Blade that made the representatives of top businesses, including Boundless Treasure Pavilion, Profound Gold and Wu Corporation, speechless and return in low spirits.The Explosion Blade had sparked fierce competition between cultivators and was finally sold for an astonishing price of three hundred silver coins!Golden Jade Hall had risen to fame!In just one night, its name resounded throughout Donglin City and sparked countless discussions and caused a commotion.The discussions about the uniqueness of the Explosion Blade even ran rampant, and many cultivators who knew the truth about the blade were full of praise. They even gave the unique Explosion Blade a name\u2014Flame Blade!As for the major businesses in Donglin City, they were more concerned about whether or not it was a rune master who created the Flame Blade and whether or not the rune master was working for Golden Jade Hall!If they could find the answers, then they could get to the bottom of Golden Jade Hall's foundation and perhaps could prepare precautionary suppression measures against Golden Jade Hall.Some businesses even planned to spend a huge amount of money to invite the mysterious rune master in Golden Jade Hall to work for their business instead!In the afternoon of the same day, the businesses each sent out their own spies to find out more about the mysterious rune master who made the Flame Aeth Blade. Although the investigations were carried out secretly, it still attracted much attention.As a result, discussions about the mysterious rune master became a popular topic in Donglin City.As for the initiator of this incredible situation, Lin Xun had no idea of everything that was happening.He had just purchased a dozen rune inks and aeth tools. He still had to pay one hundred and twenty coins in total despite negotiating heavily with the boss.Lin Xun only had nine silver coins left on him when he came out of the store.

He pointed to the beast skin scroll in his hand and then to the beast's skin bag containing silver coins. \"Where did these come from?\"Xia Zhi thought about it and immediately realized that Lin Xun was training last night and might not have heard what she said.Xia Zhi explained to him.The corners of Lin Xun's lips twitched uncontrollably. Not only did Xia Zhi go out late at night to kill a gang leader but she also took in a group of underlings, obtained a lot of booty, and sent Fatty Diao to help him collect information about the Wu Clan!It was only after a long while that Lin Xun could digest the information. \u201cBe careful for your safety.\u201dXia Zhi nodded and said, \u201cI'm hungry.\u201d\u201cI'll go and cook.\u201dWith complex emotions swirling in his heart, Lin Xun turned around and walked into the kitchen. Xia Zhi had once again done something unexpected so he didn't know what to say.As Xia Zhi watched Lin Xun busy away in the kitchen, her lips quirked into a smile that faded the next second.She went back into the room while muttering a name in her mind \u201cAzure Wolf\u201d, which was the nickname of a gang leader in another area of the slums.After dinner, Xia Zhi left again.Lin Xun didn't stop her. He had changed his views and no longer treated Xia Zhi as a child.Lin Xun sat down at the desk and opened up the beast skin scroll, which listed information about the Wu Clan.<sub>Visit elworld.com, for the best no_vel_read_ing experience</sub>In Donglin City, there were three local forces, namely the Wu Clan, the Xiao Clan and the Jin Clan.The Wu Corporation, Boundless Treasure Pavilion and Profound Gold were the top businesses in Donglin City and took almost half of the commercial profits in the city.According to the intelligence, the Wu Clan consisted of hundreds of clansmen and thousands of guards. They owned thousands of acres of aeth fields and dozens of mines. It firmly controlled the trade of aeth grains, and almost all aeth grain merchants in the city had to get goods from the Wu Corporation.Additionally, three Spirit Dipper cultivators watched over the Wu Clan!Spirit Dipper cultivators were perhaps not the most outstanding existences in the entire Ziyao Empire; however, they could be called top influential figures in a city in the southwestern province.The current clan leader of the Wu Clan was Wu Chaoqun, a cultivator of the Aeth Transformation, the ninth layer True Martial Stage. He was shrewd, capable and cunning, and so was considered an extremely powerful character.The First Elder of the Wu Clan was Wu Yunshan, an expert of the intermediate Spirit Dipper Stage.The second elder, Wu Yushan, was an expert at the initial Spirit Dipper Stage.The third elder, Wu Lanshan, was also an expert at the initial Spirit Dipper Stage.Lin Xun quickly learned the power and foundation of the Wu Clan, which surprised him a little.He didn't expect the Wu Clan to possess power of that scale. The Wu Clan could be called an overlord-level existence in Donglin City.In addition to such information, the beast skin scroll also contained intelligence on Lian Fei, but the majority of that wasn't useful to Lin Xun.\u201cWu Clan\u2026Lian Fei\u2026\u201dLin Xun fell into deep thought.After a long ponder, the only thing that Lin Xun could confirm was that he couldn't possibly threaten the Wu Clan. However, the Wu Clan feared the Stone Cauldron Alms due to its power and thus could only deal with Lin Xun in the dark. Because of that, it could only mobilize limited powers.Lin Xun made an important assessment of his situation. He knew he shouldn't panic because there was enough time and opportunity to prepare countermeasures.However, if the Wu Clan found out that Mu Wansu had drawn a line with Lin Xun, he would be in great danger.\u201cIt seems that I can't waste any time!\u201d Lin Xun took a deep breath, and the bright candlelight cast a warm glow of light on his handsome and shapely face, making him look even more determined.Favorite<sub>New_chap_ters are pub_lished on elworld.com</sub>Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Only the leaders of the top chamber of commerce in Donglin City had received the invitation.Mu Wansu was under the impression that something huge had happened but who would have thought that the conversations in the banquet centered around Golden Jade Hall?The previously unknown shop had created a sensation in the city over the past two days. However, today, many business leaders couldn't maintain their composure anymore and gathered together to discuss countermeasures.Donglin City wasn't particularly huge and the local territory had long been cleanly divided but Golden Jade Hall had suddenly emerged to compete with them. The other businesses naturally couldn't tolerate this.Unfortunately, the business leaders couldn't come to a unified countermeasure at the banquet. They each had their own plans and there weren't enough benefits for them to unite. How could they stand on the same side?Most importantly, Golden Jade Hall had emerged too suddenly. It had managed to create such a huge sensation in just two days, making it difficult for other businesses to effectively guard against it. It was already too late to stop Golden Jade Hall from rising.However, Mu Wansu had no interest in suppressing Golden Jade Hall. She knew very well that Stone Cauldron Alms was only regarded as an outsider in the eyes of the three local great forces, Wu Corporation, Boundless Treasure Pavilion and Profound Gold, and they had a cruelly competitive relationship.Therefore, Mu Wansu was in no mood to get involved.When she returned to Stone Cauldron Alms and came to her residence, she was surprised to see someone waiting for her.\u201cWang Lin, what happened?\u201d asked Mu Wansu.It turned out the man who had been waiting was Wang Lin. His expression turned complicated when he saw Mu Wansu. \u201cMiss Wansu, have you heard about what happened in front of Golden Jade Hall today?\u201dWhy is it about Golden Jade Hall again!?Mu Wansu frowned, looking a little distracted. \u201cYes. What's wrong?\u201dWang Lin took a deep breath and asked tentatively, \u201cMiss Mansu, do you know about the Flame Blade's origin?\u201dMu Wansu's face suddenly lit up with interest. She invited Wang Lin into her room and asked, \u201cDo you know who the owner of the aeth tool is?\u201dAfter what happened at the banquet, Mu Wansu began to grow curious about who could make such a unique blade.The blade was given a new name\u2014Flame Blade because of the power upgrade. This was a great honor for a certain rune master.Just like the owners of other businesses, Mu Wansu was planning to do everything possible to make the rune master join Stone Cauldron Alms!<sub>New novel_chap_ters are published here: elworld.com</sub>Wang Lin shook his head. \u201cI don't know who made the Flame Blade, but I do know who sold it to Golden Jade Hall.\u201dMu Wansu's spirits were lifted and her eyes glistened as she said, \u201cOh, let's hear it.\u201dSeeing her response, Wang Lin hesitated for a moment before whispering, \u201cMiss Wansu, do you remember that Lin Xun came to Stone Cauldron Alms yesterday?\u201dMu Wansu looked displeased. \u201cWhy are you mentioning that boy at such a time? Wait, could it be\u2014\u201dHer beautiful face abruptly changed. \u201cDon't tell me it's that bastard Lin Xun?\u201dWang Lin nodded bitterly.Mu Wansu's mood instantly changed. Her bright and beautiful face grew overcast. It was only after a long while that she said out loud, \u201cYou mean that the aeth tool he came to sell to Stone Cauldron Alms yesterday is the Flame Blade that stirred the entire city?Although Wang Lin could tell that Mu Wansu wasn't in a good mood, he finally nodded, \u201cYes, I personally examined the blade yesterday. I can confirm that it is the same as the one I appraised in Golden Jade Hall. It is absolutely the one that Lin Xun brought to Stone Cauldron Alms yesterday.\u201dBang!Mu Wansu crushed the teacup in her hand. Her full, seductive chest heaved up and down, which showed how great her emotions were fluctuating.Indeed, she had never expected such a coincidence. She had smugly driven Lin Xun out of the store and drew a line with him.However, she learned that the little bastard in her eyes was the one who helped Golden Jade Hall rise to fame!The thing that annoyed her the most was that the Flame Blade would have belonged to Stone Cauldron Alms if she hadn't made that decision yesterday!\u201cWhy didn't you say so earlier?\u201d Mu Wansu gave Wang Lin a cold-eyed stare.Wang Lin smiled wryly. \u201cI came to an agreement on price with Lin Xun yesterday but Miss Wansu\u2014you were very determined so I\u2014\u201dMu Wansu snapped, \u201cYou didn't tell me the Explosive Aeth Blade was that amazing!\u201dIndignant from the reprimand, Wang Lin retorted, \u201cI told you yesterday but you said that it's just an Explosion Blade and is worthless no matter how unique it is.\u201dMu Wansu suddenly remembered that she did indeed say something along those lines yesterday. She couldn't help but feel humiliated.She didn't care about the Flame Blade, but she was more concerned about the rune master who made the Flame Blade!<sub>Foll_ow new_episo_des on the elworld.com platform.</sub>If they could hire the rune master to work for Stone Cauldron Alms, it would bring immeasurable benefits to Stone Cauldron Alms!Since Lin Xun was the one who sold the blade, he had to know the blade's origin but Mu Wansu had ruined everything with her own hands.Mu Wansu was full of regret. She wouldn't have drawn a line with Lin Xun yesterday if she had known about this.That bastard is so annoying! Mu Wansu cursed in her mind. She found that she always suffered bad luck when she ran into Lin Xun. She originally thought that she had gotten revenge for previous issues but who would have thought that karma would come back to her?Could that little bastard be my nemesis?Mu Wansu felt a headache coming on, and with nowhere to vent her fury, her bright and beautiful face reeked with anger.Wang Lin couldn't help but say, \u201cMiss Wansu, this might be a good thing. In Donglin City, likely only Golden Jade Hall and we know that the Flame Blade came from Lin Xun. This works to our advantage. As long as we can find Young Master Lin Xun, we can find the mysterious rune master who made the Flame Blade. Then, we can immediately invite the rune master to work in Stone Cauldron Alms. It would be a great blessing!\u201dMu Wansu said hesitantly, \u201cYou mean you want me to clear the air between that kid and I?\u201dWang Lin said in surprise, \u201cMiss Wansu, do you have some deep-rooted hatred towards Young Master Lin Xun?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Mu Wansu shook her head. There is no deep hatred, just...personal grudges!Wang Lin smiled. \u201cIn that case, I will pay Young Master Lin Xun a visit on behalf of Miss Wansu. I believe that as long as we show sincerity, Young Master Lin Xun wouldn't mind about the past.\u201dMu Wansu felt flames of fury surging in her heart at the thought of bowing her head to Lin Xun. She suddenly raised her eyebrows and waved her hand. \u201cNo!\u201dWang Lin froze.Mu Wansu said coldly, \u201cLin Xun is only at the fifth layer True Martial Stage and he came from the remote Feiyun Village. Given his identity, how could he have anything to do with the mysterious rune master? He must have gotten his hands on the Flame Blade by accident. It's not worth wasting any effort on him.\u201dWang Lin disagreed. \u201cBut what if\u2014\u201dMu Wansu continued, \u201cEven if he knows the mysterious rune master, we can deal with this matter in the future. Our priority now is to watch the situation and see whether Lin Xun played a role in all this.\u201dMu Wansu had long regained her self-confidence. You want to make me, Mu Wansu, bow my head? Impossible!Wang Lin sighed inwardly. He got up and was about to take his leave.\u201cSend someone to watch Lin Xun's movements tomorrow and note down who he comes into contact with him every day. Perhaps we can obtain clues about the mysterious rune master that way.\u201d Mu Wansu ordered.<sub>Foll_ow current_novel on elworld.com</sub>Wang Lin nodded and left.Everything they talked about revolved around the mysterious rune master but they would have never expected the mysterious rune master to be Lin Xun.In truth, how could Lin Xun, who only possessed a fifth layer True Martial Stage cultivation base, create an aeth tool?In the history of the Ziyao Empire, there had been rune masters at the True Martial Stage able to make aeth tools but only a very few existed. Only one was seen in hundreds of years.How could Lin Xun possibly be one of those unrivaled rune masters?Neither Mu Wansu nor Wang Lin believed he could.Furthermore, the Flame Blade was particularly unique in that its power was twenty percent higher than that of ordinary lower human grade aeth tools. How could an ordinary True Martial Stage boy make it? It was impossible for even ordinary rune masters!Therefore, not only Mu Wansu and Wang Lin, but even Gu Yanping from Golden Jade Hall had also thought that Lin Xun and the mysterious rune master were two separate people.Wang Lin had left, but Mu Wansu was inexplicably irritable. Lin Xun's figure constantly flashed to her mind like a ghost haunting her.Mu Wansu bit her plump red lips, and her beautiful and delicate face changed indefinitely. Sometimes, she gritted her teeth, sometimes she frowned in worry, and sometimes she spaced out.\u201cThat little bastard is sent here to torture people!\"In the end, Mu Wansu let out a faint sigh.At night, Lin Xun successfully made another Flame Blade, but he wasn't as surprised as he was compared to the first two times he tried.The only thing now was that he was very pleased and satisfied with the fact that his perception power had increased a level after illuminating the second spirit star. It was much sharper and more sensitive compared to before, and it was much easier to control when he was engraving rune patterns.Soon, Xia Zhi returned home and saw Lin Xun sitting quietly and cultivating on the bed. She didn't disturb him and boiled water by herself. After washing herself, she lay on the bed gazing deeply at Lin Xun's sharp and angular face.Xia Zhi also had looked at the intelligence about the Wu Clan from Fatty Diao. She knew that the matter was a little tricky for Lin Xun to handle so she had decided to do something.Lin Xun's eyes suddenly snapped open and he said, \u201cI don't object to you fighting in this area but I already have a plan regarding the Wu Clan. I won't let you take any risks.\u201dHis expression was unusually serious and even a little stern.<sub>You can_find the rest of this_content on the elworld.com platform.</sub>Xia Zhi's huge black, crescent-shaped eyes widened before she stared at Lin Xun for a long moment. She hummed gently and closed her eyes. But there was a strange feeling in her heart. What was she actually thinking?Xia Zhi didn't even realize that there was an imperceptible smile on her lips.

The cold air made people shudder.Shua!Blades flashed across the courtyard, rolling up waves of snow.Lin Xun's upper body was bare and his swift movements made his figure appear like temporary illusions. His Skybreaker Blade glinted as it constantly swung about and not a splash of water could pass through.He had become slender and tall, and the muscles on his upper body resembled tempered blocks. He didn't look bulky and instead exuded a well-balanced sense of beauty.More than half a year had passed since Lin Xun left the mine prison. He had been thin, weak, and pale but now he had become much more elegant and even exuded a tranquil calmness.His originally handsome and sharp face now had an extra glow.Shia!A bone spear drilled out from the ground and charged straight into the shadows of blades. Direct, simple, and swift, it struck the weakest point of the blade shadows.With a loud bang, Lin Xun stumbled and staggered while the Skybreaker Blade was buzzing in his hand.\u201cThat blade technique is amazing but you haven't quite mastered it and you are unable to show its essence.\u201dXia Zhi was standing in the snow afar. She was dressed in a black windproof robe and was wielding a bone spear with a calm and peaceful expression.\u201cI know.\u201dLin Xun withdrew his blade and exhaled. Then, he went to wash up.He was practicing the Six Word Blade, which he had only reached the Elemental Realm in. Although he was beginning to grasp the blade art's essence, it was still difficult to bring out the true power of the essence.Lin Xun knew that he had to further practice this blade art and that he should practice it in real fights and battles.\u201cAre you not going out today?\u201d asked Xia Zhi as she put away the bone spear.\u201cNot now.\u201d Lin Xun put on clothes to cover his bare upper body and went to prepare breakfast.He had made two more Flame Blades in the past two days, but because Golden Jade Hall had stirred the city from selling the blade, he noticed that many people were searching for the mysterious rune master who made the blade. He felt it wasn't a suitable time to sell the two newly made aeth tools.However, Lin Xun believed that Golden Jade Hall wouldn't let the matter end after selling a Flame Blade for three hundred silver coins. Sooner or later, Gu Yanping would come to find him.Furthermore, Lin Xun finally realized that his current situation didn't look favorable after reading the intelligence that Fatty Diao brought back.<sub>This_content is taken from elworld.com</sub>Lin Xun felt he had to do something whether it was in dealing with the Wu Clan or being vigilant of revenge from Lian Fei.Lin Xun had analyzed his current situation for a long time and had decided to take advantage of all available resources to improve his strength!Lin Xun told Xia Zhi about his plan over breakfast. \u201cWe can't sit and do nothing. We must make some preparations and act soon.\u201dXia Zhi listened quietly.\u201cThe Wu Clan wants to borrow Lian Fei's hand to get rid of me because they're worried about angering the Stone Cauldron Alms. But Stone Cauldron Alms will no longer help us, so we have to depend on ourselves now.\u201dXia Zhi suddenly lifted her head and said seriously, \u201cYou've already said this a few days ago. Just tell me what to do.\u201dLin Xun looked embarrassed. \u201cDid I say that already?\u201d\u201cUh-huh.\u201d\u201cWell, I plan to find an opportunity to get rid of Lian Fei and his men.\u201dXia Zhi asked, \u201cAnd then?\u201dA ruminative expression crept into Lin Xun's dark eyes. \u201cOnce Lian Fei dies, we can see how the Wu Clan regards this matter, and if they still won't hesitate to deal with us, we will have to go into hiding.\u201dXia Zhi frowned. \u201cHide?\u201dLin Xun nodded. \u201cYes, they likely already know where we are living so it's incredibly dangerous.\u201dAfter a pause, he continued. \u201cThe Wu Clan has a huge household and a huge business. There are thousands of guards under the Wu Clan's command. The Wu Clan is a tyrant in Donglin City. If we want to fight against them, we have to use tactics such as sneak attacks. As long as we don't get caught, we can definitely wear the enemies out.\u201dHe then added, \u201cBut such tactics are extremely dangerous and if we are caught or exposed, we would have to fight to the death.\u201dAfter a thought, Xia Zhi said, \u201cIf it's a sneak attack, I can at most kill cultivators at the initial Spirit Dipper Stage.\u201dLin Xun was dumbstruck. It was the first time that Xia Zhi spoke about her true strength. But what shocked him the most was that Xia Zhi could kill initial Spirit Dipper experts!The Spirit Dipper Stage!An extraordinary existence in many people's eyes!At that cultivation stage, where a cultivator refined one's spirit to stars of the Big Dipper, they could absorb the aeth qi of heaven and earth and could open up a mysterious aeth power reservoir in their sea of qi. A True Martial Stage cultivator's strength simply couldn't be compared to a Spirit Dipper cultivator's.There was a saying that only when a person reached the Spirit Dipper Stage would they truly step upon the cultivation path. Not only would their strength exceed the limit of the human body, but their life, spirit and entire body would also undergo transformations!In the eyes of true cultivators, the nine layers of the True Martial Stage were nothing more than laying the foundation to embark on the cultivation path.<sub>This_content is taken from elworld.com</sub>But Xia Zhi was confident that she could kill cultivators at the initial Spirit Dipper Stage. Even if she needed to rely on sneak attacks, it was still incredibly shocking.Who would believe that a little girl around five to six years old could possess such powerful combat strength?It was only after a long moment that Lin Xun could calm down from his shock and say, \u201cThat's even better.\u201dXia Zhi said with a frown, \u201cIs that good? Give me three months and I can kill a cultivator at the initial Spirit Dipper Stage head-on.\u201dHe originally thought that he was improving at an incredible speed in the past half a year since he had made several breakthroughs and had progressed from the second layer True Martial Stage to the fifth layer True Martial Stage.Who would have thought that Xia Zhi was even more impressive?This little girl\u2014I really don't know what to say about her\u2026Lin Xun rubbed his forehead. \u201cWe don't have much time. We are just preparing for the worst. If we are forced into a desperate situation, we could just leave Donglin City. There will always be an opportunity to come back.\u201dXia Zhi lifted her head and said in a serious voice, \u201cBut I don't like to tolerate others and run away.\u201dLin Xun shrugged his shoulders. \u201cThat's just in the worst-case scenario. The chance of it happening is slim.\u201dWhile they were discussing, there was a knock at the door with a unique rhythm.Xia Zhi seemed to know who it was and continued to eat.Very soon, the courtyard gate was pushed open. Fatty Diao and Beanpole Ma rushed in, each carrying a huge box.\u201cPaying respect to Master Chopstick!\u201dFatty Diao and Beanpole Ma were taken aback when they saw Lin Xun. They immediately put on an unctuous smile and bowed respectfully.Lin Xun's lips twitched imperceptibly. It seemed that he still couldn't reject the bad nickname\u2026\u201cLeave the stuff there and you can go,\u201d instructed Xia Zhi.Fatty Diao quickly nodded and placed the two boxes in the corner before leaving respectfully.\u201cWhat is that?\u201d asked Lin Xun.Xia Zhi got up, saying, \u201cI led some people to wipe out another gang last night. That's the spoils from that.\u201dShe opened one of the wooden boxes and saw it was filled with around five hundred shining silver coins.<sub>Visit elworld.com, for the best no_vel_read_ing experience</sub>Xia Zhi just took a glimpse and then opened another box, which contained some bottles and jars of aeth decoctions. Evidently, they were very valuable.Lin Xun couldn't help but exclaim when he saw the box of silver coins and aeth decoctions. \u201cThe spoils is a little too much, isn't it?\u201dXia Zhi said indifferently. \u201cGangs have been operating in the slums for years, and they often rob, blackmail and steal other people's property. Do you think they would be short of money? These spoils are only a part of it. The rest have already been distributed to the other gang members of the Chopstick Gang.\u201dChopstick Gang!Lin Xun could only say helplessly, \u201cSo, now the...Chopstick Gang has also become a criminal gang?\u201dXia Zhi nodded and then immediately added, \u201cThere is a foul atmosphere in the slums and there are all kinds of people. It's impossible to eradicate all underground forces. However, under my control, the Chopstick Gang will not operate shady businesses such as stealing, robbing and murdering.\u201dLin Xun asked in puzzlement. \u201cWill they agree? This is the same as destroying the means they rely on to survive.\u201dXia Zhi said, \u201cThey have already agreed because I took them to take over other gangs' territories and gave them unimaginable benefits.\u201dDumbstruck, Lin Xun didn't ask any more questions.\u201cI told my underlings to select these aeth decoctions. They are very beneficial to cultivators at the fifth layer True Martial Stage.\u201dXia Zhi continued, \u201cThere are also five hundred silver coins in the box, which we can use for daily essentials. You don't have to work so hard to make aeth tools to earn money anymore.\u201dShe turned around and went into the room. She was going to sleep again.Complex emotions surfaced in Lin Xun's heart. Fighting and robbing are indeed one of the most effective ways to gain money!In just two days, Xia Zhi had wiped out two major gangs in the slums and pocketed a total of seven hundred silver coins and a load of aeth decoctions. Compared to that, the profit that Lin Xun made from selling aeth tools wasn't worth mentioning.However, Lin Xun didn't plan to give up on making aeth tools. After all, robbing and taking over other territories were only temporary, and also too dangerous. The spoils obtained also reeked of blood.Making aeth tools was different because it not only brought money but more importantly, he could also hone his rune skills!From this day on, Lin Xun didn't go out and made full use of his time to engrave rune patterns, create aeth tools, temper his cultivation, sharpen his spirit, and practice martial arts\u2026Every three days, he would enter and challenge the rune battle realm\u2014Thousand Heavy Wave Sea. Although he failed every time, he could see visible improvements in his physical strength.As for Xia Zhi, she slept during the day and disappeared at night. Every other day, she brought back abundant loot, either silver coins or aeth decoctions, that were very useful to Lin Xun's cultivation.If it weren't because of the Wu Clan, Lin Xun would even have loved his rare peaceful life.Unfortunately, his life was destined to be not peaceful forever.Ten days later, an assassination plot on Lin Xun was quietly happening\u2026<sub>The latest_epi_sodes are on_the elworld.com website.</sub>FavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

After ten days of painstaking training, coupled with the benefits from various aeth decoctions, he had reached the perfection of the fifth layer True Martial Stage. The aeth power within his body was not only as pure as clear liquid, but also contained incomparably terrifying power.Although the four aeth power vortexes in the four heart acupuncture points could continuously improve the grade of his aeth power, it came with one problem\u2014his aeth power would become sparser as it was tempered.Therefore, if Lin Xun wanted to raise his cultivation base to perfection, he needed more aeth power and had to put in more effort than his peers.Fortunately, the spoils delivered to him every day consisted of huge amounts of aeth herbs and decoctions that improved cultivation base; Lin Xun didn't have to worry about that problem.\u201cI'm close to a breakthrough\u2026\u201dLin Xun ended his training and assessed the changes in his body of qi. He knew he was one step away from reaching the sixth layer True Martial Stage.In addition to his diligent and painstaking training, there was another reason that contributed to him reaching the sixth layer True Martial Stage so quickly. His physical cultivation was growing stronger with each day!The so-called ninth layer True Martial Stage was originally a process to temper a cultivator's body and to accumulate aeth power. The tempering and improvement of a cultivator's body weren't independent but related with the inner body cultivation base.Similarly, the improvement in a person's inner body cultivation base had an effect on physical cultivation.For example, at the fifth layer True Martial Stage, the improvement in a cultivator's physical strength tempered a cultivator's muscles and bones and unblocked a cultivator's muscles and marrow. This was all to allow a cultivator's inner body cultivation base to smoothly improve.In the same way, the improvement in a cultivator's inner body cultivation base would open up more potential in the body, thereby removing the obstacles in physical cultivation.In short, body tempering was external and aeth power was internal. The two complemented each other and not a single one could be omitted.The descendants of some large clans often practiced body tempering arts when cultivating aeth power. It could be said to kill two birds with one stone since it consolidated their foundations and benefited their cultivation.Although Lin Xun had no body-tempering art, he obtained immeasurable body-tempering benefits from entering the rune battle realm every three days.Naturally, all of that had an enormous positive effect on his aeth power cultivation.Lin Xun suddenly awakened.He saw Xia Zhi, who was lying on the bed, open her eyes as she whispered. \u201cPeople are lurking in our courtyard.\u201dLin Xun felt a chill in his heart. He quickly got up and hid.It was already late at night, and the area around Courtyard No. 49 was completely still and silent except for a few wild dogs barking.\u201cHow many?\u201d Lin Xun asked quietly. At the same time, his perception spread out, but he found no traces of the enemy. Clearly, the opponents were either masters of stealth or that they weren't that close to them yet.\u201cThree.\u201d Xia Zhi got up and methodically got dressed. When she got out of the bed, she was already clasping a two-meter-long bone spear.<sub>Foll_ow new_episo_des on the elworld.com platform.</sub>The bone spear was very special. It emitted a lustrous shine that resembled starlight in the dark. It looked particularly mysterious and chilling.Lin Xun looked at it closer and was certain that it was an aeth tool. However, he couldn't see any traces of a rune pattern on the spear.According to Xia Zhi, the spear had been with her since she could remember and she also knew nothing about its origin.This made it even more mysterious. Lin Xun couldn't imagine what kind of aeth tool in the world would give off such a mysterious and rare effect.\u201cThey're approaching now. I'll go out and take a look.\u201dBefore Lin Xun could stop Xia Zhi, she had already opened the door and silently disappeared into the darkness. Even her aura had completely vanished.Lin Xun frowned and drew a deep breath. Like an agile leopard cat, he darted out of the room and concealed himself in the shadows of the courtyard.Outside the courtyard.\u201cGuys, we are just dealing with a child at the fifth layer True Martial Stage. Do we need to be this careful?\u201d A sloppy man with sunken cheeks smiled frivolously.\u201cDu Xiao, then why don't you act alone?\u201dIn the darkness of the alley stood a woman in a tight black leather dress. Her snow-white legs were long and shapely, and her slim waist highlighted her ample bosom. Her plump and bright red lips looked particularly dazzling in the dark.Next to the woman stood an old man who was wearing a troubled look and had his hands clasped behind his back. He glanced at the sky from time to time. He didn't look particularly astonishing.The man called Du Xiao chuckled. \u201cI'm not interested in children. I only like coquettish women like you.\u201d He licked his lips and his eyes glinted with a crazed lust.\u201cOh really, do you want to play now?\u201d The woman smiled seductively and deliberately puffed out her chest but there was an icy chill in her eyes.\u201cWell, I don't want to die. Who doesn't know that you won't see the sun tomorrow if you get into the Black Widow's bed?\u201dDu Xiao shook his head and brazenly glanced at the woman's ample bosom. He looked captivated as he said, \u201cHey, I haven't seen you for a few days but your breasts seem much bigger than before. I see you have harmed many men again.\u201dAnnoyed, Black Widow said disdainfully, \u201cYou don't have the guts to go into the bed but you dare look, are you a man?\u201d\u201cYou think I don't dare to?\u201d Du Xiao's face darkened.\u201cHave you two argued enough?\u201dThe frowning old man said aloud. His voice was hoarse, but there was an unquestionable authority. \u201cIf the target is so easy to deal with, there wouldn't be a need to ask all three of us to handle the operation.\u201dThe two felt a chill. The old man never spoke nonsense, so the operation had to be quite difficult if he said so.\u201cLet's go!\u201d<sub>Try the elworld.com platform_for the most advanced_reading experience.</sub>The old man's figure flashed in mid-air like a bat. He glided across the air and silently stepped on the courtyard wall before vanishing.He was extremely skilled in Qinggong and landed without the slightest noise. He evidently had mastered it for years.Black Widow waved her hand and a whip swung out in mid-air. It wrapped around a corner of the eaves as she suddenly bounced up and into the courtyard.Du Xiao seemed to be fooling around, but once he acted, he was extremely vigilant. He climbed up the wall like a gecko. Although he seemed slow, he disappeared in the blink of an eye.The courtyard was pitch-dark, and the cold wind was howling. The old locust tree in the courtyard swayed and rattled, creating an even more chilling and still atmosphere.It was unknown when the barking of wild dogs had disappeared. It was as though the wild dogs had sensed danger lurking and fled with their tails between their legs.The three entered the courtyard and moved forward in a triangular formation. All three had rich combat experience and had carried out various assassination operations, but they felt a tinge of fear when they stepped into the dark courtyard.It was as though someone was watching them in the dark.\u201cIt doesn't feel right. My spirit sensing power can detect things within a radius of five feet. I can confirm that the target isn't in the room,\u201d Black Widow suddenly said. Her voice was as quiet as a mosquito's cry but it rang clearly in the other two's ears. \u201cIn other words, I haven't been able to locate the target's position yet.\u201dHer face grew overcast. Assassins were supposed to kill opponents by surprise, but she failed to even locate the target. Their situation was a little serious.\u201cCould there be something wrong with the intelligence?\u201d Du Xiao's eyes flashed with a cold blade-like light.\u201cNo, the source of the intelligence is trustworthy. The target hasn't gone out in ten days.\u201d The old man's expression was dark and there was a hint of puzzlement in his eyes. \u201cIn my opinion, the target has discovered us and avoided our investigation.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Du Xiao's heart trembled. Black Widow abruptly halted.Chi!Amidst the cold wind, a sound pierced the air.\u201cBe careful!\u201dThe old man's complexion suddenly changed. He mobilized all his strength and reached out to grab the bronze shield in front of him.The other two also weren't too slow to react. They simultaneously drew their weapons and defended their bodies.Bang!A thunder-like impact reverberated and almost burst everyone's eardrums. The bronze shield in the old man's hand suddenly exploded into pieces as if it were only a piece of paper while he was propelled into the distance.The old man's fierceness was fully demonstrated in that moment. He suddenly leapt up and glided to one side like a frightened bat.Black Widow and Du Xiao also realized that something was wrong. One of them swung a whip and wrapped it around a branch of the old locust tree and then somersaulted across the air. The other swiftly rolled across the ground.Boom!<sub>Foll_ow current_novel on elworld.com</sub>A spear blasted a huge hole into the place where the three were standing.They were all struck with terror. How could a youngster at the fifth layer True Martial Stage possess such power?A trap!We've fallen into a trap!The same thought flashed in all of three of their minds. The power from one strike had struck fear into their hearts. The opponent's strength is too terrifying.Evacuate!The three had worked together for years and so they coordinated very well with each other. They decisively gave up on the operation and rushed out the courtyard.The pitch-dark courtyard and the piercing cold wind had become terrifying in their eyes. A bone chilling coldness was spreading uncontrollably in their hearts.The endless murderous intent lurking in the darkness turned out to be a trap!Bang!Suddenly, a miserable scream rang out. The old man's body shot across the darkness as though he had been struck by a cannonball. The wall crumbled down and there was no more movement.\u201cQuickly run!\u201dDu Xiao felt as if his soul had left his body. It was then that an azure blade emerged in the darkness, dazzling his eyes.\u201cAs I thought, it's an ambush and there is more than one enemy!\u201d Du Xiao roared as he thrust forward the slim awl in his hand.Bang! Bang!

But she didn't care. The old man was already dead and Du Xiao was about to die.

Her fair chin glowed with a lustrous sheen under the dim starlight.Could the opponent be a little girl?Black Widow was in disbelief.Shua!Her vision suddenly blurred and a pain shot through the back of her neck. She felt as if a pair of iron clamps had gripped her neck and she lost all the strength in her body. Then, she was lifted up.She couldn't react at all!A wave of terror surged in her heart. She possessed a cultivation base of the seventh layer True Martial Stage and was a well-known assassin in Donglin City. She had rich combat experience but it was the first time that she was so easily defeated. Moreover, her opponent was just a little girl!How is that possible?Black Widow was full of dread.Soon, Xia Zhi returned home carrying Black Widow. She casually tossed Black Widow to the ground and cast her gaze to the courtyard's center.There, Lin Xun was fighting with Du Xiao. The battle was incredibly fierce; the air was constantly buzzing and dust whirled in the air.Lin Xun swung the Skybreaker Blade vertically and horizontally. The gorgeous azure blade glowed a fierce light as it performed the Six Word Blade to its peak. It was ruthless, swift, and direct.But his opponent Du Xiao clearly wasn't an ordinary person. He was much fiercer and more ruthless than Lin Xun like he was unafraid of death.Wielding a thin awl, Du Xiao used moves that were fast and sly, which were extremely difficult to deal with. Lin Xun was forced to constantly dodge and take a defensive stance.Xia Zhi stood at the courtyard's side and watched quietly, showing no intention of helping.Black Widow stood next to her and had completely given up on the thought of running away. Her expression changed indefinitely as she watched the battle.\u201cWho do you think will win?\u201d A voice rang in Black Widow's ears, which terrified her. She glanced at Xia Zhi, and even if she couldn't see her face clearly, she somehow felt the little girl was like a mountain suppressing her to the point of suffocation and made her dare not to move a finger.Black Widow drew a deep breath, gritted her teeth, and said, \u201cDu Xiao is at the seventh layer True Martial Stage, and he has reached the precision realm of martial arts with the combat technique Cirrus Cloud Thorn. The kid is only at the fifth layer True Martial Stage. Although he has a deep mastery of the blade, he clearly lacks experience. If everything goes as expected\u2026\u201dBlack Widow didn't dare to say anything else.In her opinion, even if Du Xiao won the battle, he wouldn't be able to escape death because there was the mysterious but powerful little girl standing next to her!<sub>Updated_at elworld.com</sub>Black Widow couldn't help but feel despair. Not only would Du Xiao die, but she also wouldn't be able to stay alive.She unwittingly glanced at the corpse in front of a collapsed wall in the corner of the courtyard.It was her other comrade, \u201cFrowning Oldy\u201d.This made Black Widow's heart tumble again. Frowning Oldy was at the eighth layer True Martial Stage and possessed tyrannical strength. He wasn't an ordinary person and had even successfully assassinated a cultivator at the ninth layer True Martial Stage, which made him rise to fame. Everyone's faces usually paled at the mention of this veteran assassin in Donglin City.But now...Frowning Oldy, who had made countless people feel uneasy, had turned into a corpse!How could this little girl possess such terrifying strength?Uncontrollable confusion filled Black Widow's heart.\u201cIf everything goes as expected, your comrade will lose this battle.\u201dXia Zhi stated calmly as she fixed her eyes on the battlefield. \u201cCan't you see that Lin Xun has gradually adapted to the battle, and he is about to break through?\u201dBreakthrough?Black Widow's heart trembled violently. She shifted her gaze to the battlefield and found that, although Lin Xun was suppressed, his blade skills were becoming increasingly concise as the battle continued. Furthermore, his bearing was more and more imposing.In particular, the qi around his body rushed into the sky like smoke signals and then tumbled down like torrents. A clap of thunder reverberated every time he exerted strength.Wisps of white mist spiraled around his body, a sign that his blood and qi were about to ignite and he would soon break through to Blood Igniting, the sixth layer of the True Martial Stage!\u201cHe is actually making a breakthrough in battle. This can only be achieved when a person has developed an extremely deep cultivation foundation!\u201d exclaimed Black Widow.She had only noticed Xia Zhi's terrifying strength and didn't pay much attention to Lin Xun. She only now realized that she had underestimated Lin Xun when she saw such a scene.He was only at the fifth layer True Martial Stage yet he was able to survive against Du Xiao until now. This fact alone was already incredible. Other ordinary fifth layer True Martial Stage cultivators would have been killed already.From the fighting spirit he had demonstrated, it seemed that he was about to breakthrough in battle. Almost all those who had done the same were regarded as unparalleled geniuses in the world!Black Widow had heard that Wu Lingcong, who came second in the imperial national examination three years ago, also broke through to the Spirit Dipper Stage in battle. Even the current emperor of the empire had praised Wu Lingcong. He said, \u201cThe second best in the examination is destined to occupy a place in the martial arts world.\u201dIn that year, the champion of the national examination was Little Sword Lord Xie Yutang and the third was Song Xinglie. Both were well-known in the world but only Wu Lingcong received such praise from the emperor!Although Lin Xun possessed only a cultivation base of the fifth layer True Martial Stage and he couldn't be compared to a pride of heavens such as Wu Lingcong, the fact that he showed signs of breakthrough in battle was already enough to shock the world.Black Widow's heart rose and fell in waves. The boy and girl are both terrifying. She couldn't help but feel defeated when she compared herself to them.I really can't compare to them!\u201cYour comrade is about to lose.\u201d<sub>Visit to elworld.com discover_new novels.</sub>Xia Zhi suddenly spoke and made Black Widow snap to her senses. When she looked at the battlefield, she saw that Du Xiao's attacks were still extremely fierce but he was gradually failing to suppress Lin Xun.Du Xiao constantly roared in fury. His sunken cheeks reddened with shock and anger, as though he couldn't believe that his opponent was that tenacious and difficult to deal with.Boom!Du Xiao made a long cry into the air as he thrust the awl forward in his hand like he was making a final desperate struggle.Lin Xun's entire body suddenly glowed a dazzling red like a blazing furnace had suddenly erupted in his body.Instantly, the aura around him rose dramatically, as if he was being reborn and turned into another person.He broke through!Black Widow gasped in her heart, and her soul almost left her body. The youngster actually achieved it\u2026\u201cImpossible! You\u2026you\u2026\u201dAs though terrified by the scene, Du Xiao's fierce face contorted with endless bitterness.Bang!At the same time, Lin Xun's blade flashed like lightning in his hand as it struck the awl in his opponent's hand. Du Xiao's wrist cracked and snapped from the tremendous power. Then, he let out a tragic scream as he was sent flying across the air.Pu!Lin Xun stepped forward and directly pierced Du Xiao's throat. Bright red blood sputtered everywhere in the dark night. It was both beautiful and terrifyingly sad.Hu\u2014Lun Xun's breathing was labored and rapid. He looked at Xia Zhi and sat down cross-legged on the ground.The battle had not only gone on for a long time, but it was also full of danger. It had simply been a battle of life and death.Even Lian Xun had to admit that Du Xiao was the strongest opponent he had faced since he started his cultivation journey. Not only was Du Xiao's strength two levels above his, but he also had rich combat experience. Ordinary cultivators couldn't compare to him.Near the end of the battle, Lin Xun had almost exhausted his aeth power and he fell into an extremely dangerous situation.Fortunately, he grasped the opportunity to make a breakthrough at the critical juncture and turned his situation around.Now, Du Xiao was dead and he had made a breakthrough in battle, but his blood was blazing and bubbling like a stove in his body and his aeth power was soaring and rampaging around his body like a wild horse that refused to be bridled. If he didn't soon regain control, he would be at risk of losing himself.Under the night sky, Lin Xun's expression was serious and calm. He was completely absorbed into the cultivation world.Black Widow ignored him and just stared dazedly at Du Xiao's corpse. Her beautiful face looked particularly dispirited and helpless in the darkness.<sub>This_content is taken from elworld.com</sub>Frowning Oldy and Du Xiao are both dead\u2026If I had known about this, I wouldn't have accepted this assassination request!Black Widow thought bitterly. It's my turn next, isn't it?\u201cIf you tell us who sent you here, I will let you go immediately.\u201d Xia Zhi said softly, her voice as ethereal as before.But Black Widow felt a chill run through her body when it fell in her ears. She knew death was approaching.\u201cI'm just an assassin who helps the employer to assassinate the target. We don't know about our employer's identity. Kill me if you want.\u201d Black Widow's face was deathly pale and her voice was low.She indeed knew nothing about the employer's identity. She had nothing to say if Lin Xun and Xia Zhi didn't believe her. From the moment she became an assassin, she was ready to accept death after the failure of a mission.This was the test that every qualified assassin must face.Xia Zhi pondered for a moment and said, \u201cYou can go.\u201dFor a moment, Black Widow almost thought that she had heard it wrong. She stared at her blankly and finally cried out, \u201cYou want to let me go?\u201d\u201cThere's no point in killing you,\u201d said Xia Zhi indifferently.Black Widow thought that Xia Zhi was softhearted but when she heard the reason, she came to realize the bitter truth that Xia Zhi attached no importance to her.What do you mean no point?In other words, even if you die, it's worthless to others!\u201cThank you.\u201dBlack Widow was silent for a long moment before she got up and bowed to Xia Zhi. Then, she pointed to the corpses of Du Xiao and Frowning Oldy, asking, \u201cThey're already dead, can I bring their bones back and bury them?\u201dXia Zhi cast a surprised glance at her and then nodded. \u201cThat would be good.\u201dBlack Widow bowed deeply at Xia Zhi again and swiftly disappeared into the darkness with the two corpses.\u201cThe Wu Clan? Or could it be Lian Fei?\u201dXia Zhi quietly guarded Lin Xun. She stood there silently in the darkness, her jet-black eyes were filled with coldness and indifference.In the past ten days, she and Lin Xun had been waiting for an opportunity to kill Lian Fei, but unfortunately, according to the intelligence brought back by the spies sent by Fatty Diao, Lian Fei had never left Donglin Academy.However, unexpectedly, before she and Lin Xun had acted, the enemies couldn't hold back and sent assassins for them.\u201cWhoever it is must pay the price of death!\u201d<sub>New_chap_ters are pub_lished on elworld.com</sub>As the little girl raised her head, a few strands of jet-black hair under the hat's brim escaped into the cold wind and fluttered over her forehead.

Students in navy blue school uniforms rushed to the cafeteria in groups of twos and threes.When Lian Fei stepped out of his dormitory, his eyes were bloodshot and his brows were furrowed together.He had stayed up all night waiting for a message, but he still hadn't received any.Could something unexpected have happened last night?This question struck Lian Fei's mind from time to time and tormented him the entire night.\u201cLian Fei, how are the preparations going?\u201dA pretty girl in a perfectly tailored uniform came over from the distance. Her footsteps were light and she seemed to be in high spirits.\u201cPrepare for what?\u201d Lian Fei was perplexed. The girl was called Yao Susu and was Lian Fei's classmate. She had admired him for a long time.\u201cHave you forgotten that the district examination is in ten days?!\u201dLian Fei hummed and slapped his forehead. He then said with a smile, \u201cWhat is there to prepare for? It's just a test of age and cultivation. I can definitely pass.\u201dYao Susu and Lian Fei walked side by side. She explained, \u201cDon't be so careless, you are fifteen years old this year, so you won't have an advantage in age. I heard that there are 3,000 people alone from Donglin Academy who want to participate in the district examination. However, there are only 1,000 people admitted. The elimination rate is even higher if you also consider the other applicants in Donglin City,\u201dLian Fei responded in a distracted manner, \u201cMy age is definitely my weakness but I am already at the fifth layer True Martial Stage and that's undoubtedly an advantage over the others. I believe I won't be eliminated at the district examination.\u201dYao Susu giggled. What she liked most about Lian Fei was his confidence.While the two were talking, they arrived at the cafeteria. The huge cafeteria was already full of students, and the breakfast also looked fine. It was a vegetarian dish that consisted of a special eight treasure aeth porridge and was paired with several kinds of aeth vegetables. It also tasted pretty good.The students in Donglin Academy were all very young, with the youngest at five and the oldest fifteen years old.Donglin Academy was an official school and not a local force. It was established to select talents for the empire's district examination.Students over fifteen years old were not allowed to participate in the district examination and so wouldn't be accepted into Donglin Academy.Many students in the cafeteria were talking while eating breakfast. The cafeteria was very lively, and almost all topics centered around the district examination that would begin in ten days.<sub>The source of this_chapter; elworld.com</sub>Uninterested in the topics, Lian Fei lowered his head and ate quietly.Yao Susu noticed that something was wrong with Lian Fei and couldn't help but ask, \u201cDo you have something on your mind?\u201dLian Fei hummed and then patiently explained, \u201cDon't worry, it's just a small matter.\u201dYao Susu had an impressive family background. Her family controlled a lot of power in Qingfeng County. Qingfeng County ruled over twelve prefectures and Donglin City was one of them.In other words, Donglin City was also under the rule of Qingfeng County.Lian Fei planned to participate in the prefectural examination in Qingfeng County in the future. Given Yao Susu's infatuation with him, he naturally would be well-treated there.Yao Susu said in a concerned voice, \u201cLian Fei, if you have trouble, you can tell me. Although my family isn't in Donglin City, we still have many connections here.\u201dLian Fei smiled. \u201cDon't worry. Don't you believe in the man you like?\u201dYao Susu's pretty face blushed, and she softly spat out, \u201cYou're a smooth talker.\u201dAfter being interrupted like that, Yao Susu forgot what she wanted to ask.The two finished breakfast and walked out of the cafeteria when a middle-aged man rushed in anxiously.When he saw Lian Fei, he wanted to say something but Lian Fei stopped him with an eye signal. Lian Fei smiled at Yao Susu. \u201cA friend is looking for me, why don't you wait for me inside?\u201dYao Susu nodded and left.The smile on Lian Fei's face instantly faded when the girl disappeared. He said to the middle-aged man, \u201cWhy are you here now?\u201dWhile asking, he brought the middle-aged man to a quiet corner.The middle-aged man was called Xue Yong and was an informant sent by the Wu Clan to pass a message to Lian Fei.\u201cI just received a message.\u201d Xue Yong sighed. \u201cThis morning, Black Widow returned twice the deposit and confirmed that the mission had failed.\u201dHis one sentence made Lian Fei freeze and his expression changed indefinitely. The worst result had come!\u201cHow is that possible?\u201dLian Fei forcibly suppressed his worry. \u201cThat kid is only at the fifth layer true Martial Stage. We have spent so much money to invite Black Widow, Du Xiao, and Frowning Oldy to take on the mission together. They could kill a ninth layer True Martial Stage cultivator let alone deal with a kid. How could they fail the mission?\u201dXue Yong's face was overcast as he explained, \u201cThis matter is no doubt true.

He stood there in a trance for a long while and then, a thought flashed across his mind. \u201cCould that kid have a master helping him?\u201d\u201cAlthough Black Widow didn't say so, that should be the case.\u201dLian Fei asked anxiously, \u201cCould it be Stone Cauldron Alms?\u201dHe was most afraid of the Stone Cauldron Alms since it was one of the strongest powers in the empire and no one in the entire Donglin City would dare to anger the Stone Cauldron Alms.From what he knew, Stone Cauldron Alms didn't hesitate to ruin their relationship with the Wu Clan in order to protect Lin Xun. And as a result, the Wu Clan didn't dare to act recklessly.If it weren't because of them, then the Wu Clan wouldn't have pushed Lian Fei out to take the lead to deal with Lin Xun!Lian Fei knew that the Wu Clan was using him, but he had no other choice in order to avenge his father. Moreover, he needed help from the Wu Clan. As a little student of Donglin Academy, he couldn't possibly shake the great mountain that was Stone Cauldron Alms.Xue Yong's pupils shrank when he heard the name Stone Cauldron Alms.Lian Fei pondered for a moment and then he coldly snorted in his mind. Given the Wu Clan's usual way of shirking responsibility, I would have to bear the consequences alone if the people from Stone Cauldron Alms got mad.This was an agreement that Lian Fei had already reached with the Wu Clan.However, Lian Fei was unwilling to be used. After taking a few deep breaths, he gritted his teeth and said, \u201cThe matter has already happened, and so they must be on the alert. If it was up to me, I will immediately send more people to end the matter once and for all!\u201dWhen Xue Yong heard this, the overcast expression suddenly faded from his face, and he laughed. \u201cI heard that Wu Deyong, the manager of the Wu Clan, also thinks the same way. So it's true that heroes see the same thing.\u201dLian Fei snorted again in his mind. What nonsense that heroes see the same thing. It's obvious that they have already figured out a countermeasure, but they just want me to come forward and take care of it!Lian Fei said bluntly, \u201cSince that's the case, what else did Shopkeeper Wu Deyong say?\u201d\u201cWe can no longer hire assassins. The death of Du Xiao and Frowning Oldy have stirred up many waves. Assassins won't dare to take part anymore.\u201dAfter a pause, he changed the topic. \u201cHowever, although we can't use assassins, we can use some gangsters.\u201dLian Fei asked thoughtfully, \u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201dXue Yong smiled meaningfully. \u201cLin Xun is now living in the slums, where there are many underground gangs. Coincidentally, the leader of one of the biggest gangs is Old Tiger Lu. I heard that he is a ruthless character who only cares about money. What's especially good is that Old Tiger Lu is a true initial Spirit Dipper expert!\u201dLian Fei's heart trembled. \u201cWe are going to ask a Spirit Dipper expert to act? This is going to cost a lot of money, right? Is it worth it?\u201dXue Yong's face grew fierce and ruthless. \u201cDu Xiao, Frowning Oldy and Black Widow acted together, but they failed to get rid of the boy. We have no choice but to ask Old Tiger Lu. This matter must be quickly ended. The longer it drags on, the more disadvantaged we are.\u201dHe suddenly realized something and said with a smile, \u201cOf course, it depends on whether you, young master, agrees or not.\u201d<sub>Foll_ow new_episo_des on the elworld.com platform.</sub>Would Lian Fei dare not to agree? He said coldly, \u201cIt's the best option given the circumstances. It depends on whether Old Tiger Lu is a real tiger or not!\u201dXue Yong immediately left with a smile.Lian Fei's lips curved in a mocking smile as he watched Xue Yong leave. What bullshit is the Wu Clan? They are afraid of the Stone Cauldron Alms' power and are just using me as their knife. When I rise to the top, the first thing I will do is get rid of the Wu Clan!He returned to the academy and saw that Yao Susu had already saved him a seat. Lian Fei couldn't help but smile brightly when he saw her pretty face.Whether or not he could rise to the top would depend on Yao Susu\u2026Courtyard No. 49 in the slums.Clasping a cup of warm tea, Lin Xun sat under the old locust tree. He exclaimed in surprise, \u201cYou let Black Widow go?\u201dXia Zhi was sitting quietly opposite him, flipping through the book \u201cRecords of the Empire's Past Conquests\u201d. The warm winter sun shone on her tranquil and beautiful little face and cast her in a sacred aura\u201cWell, they are just assassins who work for money. It doesn't make sense to kill them,\u201d Xia Zhi casually explained.It indeed didn't make sense.Lin Xun thought it over. He really admired Xia Zhi's approach. She knew that there were things that must be done and things that must not be done. Her decision clearly showed her nature.\u201cThe district examination is in ten days.\u201d Xia Zhi suddenly raised her head and looked at Lin Xun.\u201cYes.\u201d Lin Xun said with a smile, \u201cI will be fourteen years old this year. Also, I broke through to the sixth layer True Martial Stage last night. I don't think there would be a problem in passing the district examination.\u201dHe suddenly asked, \u201cBy the way, do you want to participate too?\u201dXia Zhi shook her head. \u201cI have no interest.\u201dLin Xun acknowledged her decision and didn't try to force her. Xia Zhi always had her own opinion. Although she would listen to him, he didn't want Xia Zhi to go against her own heart.\u201cWhat are you going to do with the Wu Clan? They must be the people behind what happened last night?\u201d asked Xia Zhi.\u201cLian Fei hasn't left Donglin Academy these days. He's extremely smart. I'm afraid we can't get rid of him first.\u201dLin Xun looked a little surprised. He was the one who killed Lian Fei's father and so he was Lian Fei's enemy. Lin Xun was surprised that Lian Fei could suppress his hatred and obediently stay in Donglin Academy. His patience and intelligence wasn't simple.While they were talking, someone came to visit. Lin Xun opened the door to see a beautiful woman with a hot figure standing in front of him.

If you believe me, please leave here as soon as possible.\u201dBlack Widow left in a hurry after saying those two sentences.Her appearance surprised Lin Xun. He closed the door and said emotionally, \u201cThis woman knows how to repay a favor. It's a shame that she became an assassin.\u201dXia Zhi said seriously, \u201cIt seems that their failure yesterday didn't make them exercise some restraint, but instead made them more determined to eradicate us.\u201dLin Xun's expression turned serious, and he frowned. \u201cI'm curious who this Old Tiger Lu is?\u201d\u201cI know.\u201dXia Zhi said casually, \u201cHe's one of the few Spirit Dipper cultivators in the slums and also the leader of Black Tiger Gang, the largest gang in the slums. He has thousands of gang members under his command and among them, there are over three hundred cultivators.\u201dShe took a sip of tea before she continued, \u201cI originally planned to swallow up the Black Tiger Gang. I didn't expect them to come to my door on their own initiative.\u201dLin Xun raised his eyebrows. \u201cI see. In order to deal with us, the Wu Clan has hired a gang leader who is also at the Spirit Dipper Stage. They think so highly of us.\u201dXia Zhi said disdainfully, \u201cOld Lu Tiger is nothing, I heard that he only broke through to the Spirit Dipper Stage in his fifties, which clearly shows his poor aptitude in cultivation. He is known to only care about money and not his life so it's not unexpected that the Wu Clan hired him.\u201dFor the first time, Lin Xun realized that Xia Zhi's decision to establish the Chopstick Gang and swallow up two nearby gangs wasn't a mistake. She had not only obtained abundant loot but also gained access to various related information.The information made Lin Xun learn about the specific forces of the Wu Clan in the shortest time and also provided background information on Old Tiger Lu.\u201cDo you believe in Black Widow's intel?\u201d Lin Xun asked.Xia Zhi stood up and said, \u201cI'll send someone to check on Old Tiger Lu's area, and we'll know whether she told the truth or not.\u201d She was already walking out of the courtyard as she spoke.After just the time it took to burn one stick of incense, Xia Zhi had returned. The news was confirmed to be true. Old Tiger Lu was mobilizing and gathering people. Clearly, he was going to carry out a huge operation. Anyone who wasn't blind could tell.When Lin Xun learned about that, he urged, \u201cIt seems that it's best to leave this place soon. There will be a fierce battle here tonight.\u201dXia Zhi asked, \u201cAre you scared?\u201dMurderous intent flashed in Lin Xun's dark eyes. \u201cThey've come one after another. If I don't strike back, I'll be seen as too useless!\u201d<sub>Foll_ow current_novel on elworld.com</sub>Xia Zhi nodded. \u201cI think so too.\u201dThat evening, Lin Xun was fully prepared.He was still dressed in a coarse hemp garment, but it was another story inside!Under his outer garment, he wore a pair of dark gray shoulder guards called Cloud Mountain, which were engraved with an earth guarding rune and had incredible defensive power.A pair of azure wristbands called Ton Breaker were attached to his wrists. They were engraved with a water current rune, which not only protected the wrists but also allowed a person to mobilize the aeth power in their body much more effectively when used with a suitable weapon. Additionally, it increased the aeth power released.A flexible armor called Stacked Scales protected his upper body. The layers of fine iron fully covered him, and coupled with the thousand whirlpool rune, he could easily absorb and neutralize an opponent's attack. It was also a defense aeth tool.On his feet were the Flying Spirit Boots, which were engraved with the swift wind rune. They could greatly improve a person's flexibility and speed.Additionally, Lin Xun was carrying a huge bow. Its entire body was jet-black and rough. It was made from more than ten kinds of metals, while the bowstring was constructed from the backbone of a thorn-tailed mammoth.This bow was called Spirit Arm and was engraved with a gold splitting rune!In addition, Lin Xun had thirty Blazing Sun Arrows engraved with the Explosive Flame Rune hidden in his storage ring.Finally, strapped at his waist was the Flame Blade!These pieces of equipment were all standard aeth tools that were commonly found on the market, but since they were aeth tools, they naturally were valuable.However, Lin Xun had made all those aeth tools himself in the past ten days and so he didn't need to spend much money for them. He only had to consume a large quantity of aeth tools and rune ink.It was worth mentioning that Lin Xun only failed once in making those tools, and the reason for the failure was that a mouse suddenly ran into the room and distracted him. That resulted in a little mistake in the rune engraving.If other rune masters knew about his near-perfect success rate, they would likely go crazy.But Lin Xun was used to it and wasn't surprised by the result.The sun was beginning to set, and Lin Xun was ready to set off. He had armed himself from head to toe.Xia Zhi was dressed much simpler. She carried a bone spear as always and was wearing a black wind-proof robe and a hat that covered her stunning face.\u201cLet's go.\u201d Lin Xun took a deep breath and walked outside.\u201cWait a minute, someone is coming,\u201d Xia Zhi said, frowning. Her ethereal voice was filled with killing intent.<sub>Foll_ow new_episo_des on the elworld.com platform.</sub>Gu Liang walked along the narrow and dark alley, feeling a little annoyed.A few days ago, his father Gu Yanping had instructed him to find the young master who sold them the Flame Blade. He thought it would be an easy task but he hadn't made much progress despite traveling all over the prosperous areas of Donglin City.Gu Liang didn't dare to ask anyone for help because he knew that all major businesses in Donglin City were watching movements from Golden Jade Hall. Even Xiao Yuanzhong, the owner of Boundless Treasure Pavilion, had said that he was willing to spend a huge amount of money to find the mysterious rune master!Under those circumstances, Gu Liang was certain that many spies in the city had fixed their eyes on Golden Jade Hall because only they knew who the Flame Blade came from!Therefore, Gu Liang was extremely careful to avoid being followed whenever he went out. But it was only today that he realized that he used the wrong searching approach!This was thanks to his father's reminder. According to Gu Yanping, Lin Xun was clad in the most ordinary hemp garments and clearly wasn't from a wealthy family.Moreover, as a cultivator, Lin Xun showed no hesitation when he sold the Flame Blade, which suggested his living must be somewhat difficult.Those little details indicated that Lin Xun wasn't residing in a prosperous area but the slums!Sure enough, based on his father's deduction, Gu Liang soon found out that a new tenant, also a youngster, had recently moved into Courtyard No. 49 deep in a certain alley in the slums!This confirmed Gu Liang's speculation but it was also the reason why he was annoyed. If he had paid more attention to little details, he wouldn't have had to work so hard for nothing these days.Very quickly, Gu Liang expelled the annoyance in his heart. He came to Courtyard No. 49 and immediately knocked on the door.The door was opened and a familiar face made Gu Liang lit up with joy and excitement. It's indeed right!\u201cI am Gu Liang, the owner of Golden Jade Hall is my father. I pay respects to Young Master.\u201d Gul Liang bowed respectfully.Lin Xun looked at him blankly. He never thought the son of the owner of Golden Jade Hall would come looking for him at such a time.He immediately understood what Gu Liang had in mind and said, \u201cYou must be here to buy aeth tools, right?\u201dGu Liang was a little taken aback by Lin Xun's directness. He immediately smiled. \u201cYoung Master,You have sharp eyes. My father has entrusted me to come here regarding that matter.\u201dLin Xun said after a thought, \u201cI'm not free now. I have an urgent matter to deal with today. How about I pay your Golden Jade Hall a visit another day?\u201dIt wasn't easy for Gu Liang to find Lin Xun, so how would he be willing to leave? \u201cOh, why don't I just stay here and wait for Young Master to return?\u201dLin Xun frowned. \u201cI advise you to quickly leave. It won't be long before many changes happen at this place. There are likely going to be fatal disasters here.\u201d<sub>Visit to elworld.com discover_new novels.</sub>Gu Liang's heart trembled. Lin Xun didn't seem to be joking from his expression so he finally nodded after a long thought. \u201cIf that's the case, then I'll come back tomorrow.\u201dHe turned around and left.The moment he left, Lin Xun closed the door and leaped over the backyard wall with Xia Zhi. They sped along an alley and quickly disappeared.It was dusk and the setting sun was red as blood like the sky was ablaze. A murder of crows was cawing in the air, their voices piercing and chilling.As night was about to fall, the area around Courtyard No. 49 became completely deserted. Not even the barking of wild dogs could be heard.Only the biting cold wind that was as cold as a blade whimpered like it was complaining.Before long, the sound of footsteps broke the deathly silence. If one looked down from above, one would see a dense crowd of people rushing towards Courtyard No. 49 from all directions like a tide.There were a lot of people, and every single one of them was in armor and wore fierce expressions. There were around five to six hundred people and among them many were cultivators!There was no need to guess to know that those people were members of the Black Tiger Gang!As night fell and darkness shrouded Courtyard No. 49, Old Tiger Lu also appeared.Although Old Tiger Lu was in his sixties, he was tall and burly. His long gray hair was neatly combed but the numerous scars on his face made him look extremely ferocious and his hazel eyes were as fierce and cunning as a wolf's.The Black Tiger Gang was the most powerful among the underground forces in the slums. Old Tiger Lu had the highest status within the Black Tiger Gang and he could even be called the king of the underground forces in many people's eyes!Old Tiger Lu clasped his hands behind his back as he surveyed the closed door of Courtyard No. 49. The corners of his lips curled in a cold and cruel smile.Someone had offered him the finest aeth tool and a thousand silver coins to kill a young man called Lin Xun.Old Tiger Lu readily agreed, but he wasn't stupid so he knew that the target was no doubt difficult to deal with given the remarkable price.Therefore, he didn't come alone, but brought five hundred gang members with him!Old Tiger Lu believed that he could demolish the entire slums with such force, and so it had to be more than enough to deal with a teenager.\u201cGang Leader, the brothers who are watching nearby have reported that the target hasn't left the house today. He must still be at home.\u201d A scout came forward and quickly reported.Old Tiger Lu nodded and motioned his hand, \u201cLet's act!\u201dHis chilling and cruel voice was like a signal that lifted the curtain of the battle on this dark night.Favorite<sub>Updated_at elworld.com</sub>Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Even a fly couldn't escape, let alone a person.Old Tiger Lu nodded in satisfaction. His subordinates were all elites within the gang. They were shrewd, ruthless, and sharp-witted, and so they always handled matters efficiently.Old Tiger Lu didn't charge into the courtyard. Although the target was only a teenager, he knew the target wasn't easy to deal with given the fact that the employer offered the enormous price of one thousand silver coins and an aeth tool.Based on the circumstances, Old Tiger Lu naturally wouldn't take any risks before he understood the situation.Time passed by.Old Tiger Lu suddenly frowned. His subordinates had already stormed the target's house, but there still wasn't any noises of fighting.Could something unexpected have happened?As this thought flashed through Old Tiger Lu's mind, one of his subordinates darted over to him and reported, \u201cLeader, the target isn't at home!\u201dOld Tiger Lu's face darkened. \u201cHave you searched carefully?\u201dThe subordinate said irritably, \u201cI've looked everywhere. There isn't even a single coin let alone a person! The target must have heard and fled the moment the situation looked bad!\u201dAll the people who charged into Courtyard No. 49 returned with disappointment across their faces.A tinge of bad feeling surged in Old Tiger Lu's heart. His voice turned ice-cold as he fumed, \u201cWhat a bunch of useless trash. Go and kill all the spies who were supposed to keep watch here. How dare they ruin my great plan!\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dA dozen of experts immediately accepted the orders.\u201cLeader, it seems that the target has indeed left long ago. We are going to have to return without accomplishing anything,\u201d someone sighed.Old Tiger Lu's face was dark and unpleasant. He had brought hundreds of people with him and stormed the courtyard in a mighty and murderous manner. But he failed to achieve what he wanted to so it was natural that he felt disgruntled.Do we have to admit defeat?Old Tiger Lu felt extremely bitter.\u201cLeader, it's not good! It's not good!\u201dSuddenly, a panicked voice rang from the distance. A scout staggered over, making many people restless.The target has already escaped, could there be worse news than that?<sub>For more_novel, visit elworld.com</sub>Fury surged in Old Tiger Lu's heart. He lashed out at the scout with a kick and scolded, \u201cWhy are you so flustered? Are you here to report or announce death?\u201dVisibly in pain, the scout writhed on the ground and wailed, \u201cLeader, it's really bad!\u201dOld Tiger Lu was so furious that he wanted to kill the useless trash with one slash of his blade. He hissed through gritted teeth, \u201cWhat the hell is so bad?! Do you want to find out what death is like?\u201dThe scout grimaced and said trembling, \u201cOur... our den has been attacked!\u201dWhat?!Old Tiger Lu's face changed dramatically as if he had been struck by lightning.The other gang members' faces also blanched. The same thought came to their minds, Someone dared to take advantage of the situation to attack our den?Who in the slums ate the guts of a bear and attacked the Black Tiger Gang?\u201cDamn it. It seems that someone is tired of living! They want to take advantage of the chance that we are away from the den to pick up a huge bargain!\u201d\u201cCould it be Barbarian Hu from the Green Bamboo Gang? He has always made things difficult for our Black Tiger Gang. It might be him!\u201d\u201cBarbarian Hu wants to die!\u201dRoars of anger rang out from the crowd and turned the scene chaotic. That moment revealed that those gangs were, after all, a group of outlaws who couldn't be seen in public. They couldn't be compared with the military which had strict discipline. They were nothing more than a group of individual mobs.\u201cShut up!\u201d A thunder-like roar resounded in all directions and frightened everyone.Old Tiger Lu was ferocious and a murderous rage covered his face. He hissed through gritted teeth, \u201cWhat are you waiting for? Hurry up and come with me! Don't tell me you want to wait until our den is completely taken over?Everyone was jolted to their senses.The time before Old Tiger Lu led his subordinates to Courtyard No. 49.In a spacious area in the southwest of the slums stood a grand building like a castle rising from the ground. Compared with the cramped and dilapidated houses nearby, it was incredibly eye-catching akin to a crane in a flock of chickens.It was the den of the Black Tiger Gang. Ordinary people wouldn't dare to take a step near there.It was getting dark, and the lights in the Black Tiger Gang's den were brightly lit making it seem like daytime. Although Old Tiger Lu had brought five hundred gang members with him, there were still hundreds of guards guarding the den.Lin Xun carefully concealed himself on the roofs of the houses opposite the old den. He surveyed the Black Tiger Gang's den from several dozen meters away and whispered, \u201cHave you hid away all the valuable things in the house?\u201d\u201cUh-huh.\u201dXia Zhi's voice sounded in the dark. It sounded so ethereal that even Lin Xun couldn't locate her exact location with his current spirit power!The way she concealed her breathing and made herself invisible was astonishing.Lin Xun even felt that Xia Zhi belonged to the darkness\u2014She was ethereal, elusive, and impossible to predict.<sub>Foll_ow current_novel on elworld.com</sub>\u201cWe don't have much time. We should act now,\u201d Xia Zhi reminded.As Lin Xun took a deep breath, a murderous intent flashed in his dark eyes. \u201cLet's do it!\u201dShua!Before his voice faded, he drew the Spirit Arm Bow, crouched down, gathered strength in his arms, and pulled back the bowstring until the bow bent into a half-moon shape.His series of actions was as smooth as flowing water and completed in one breath!In an instant, a figure that was standing guard by the second floor window collapsed to the ground and died on the spot as if he had been struck by lightning.At the same time, a blaze of fire exploded at the same location. The fire blazed up. It was the power from the explosion of a Blazing Sun Arrow. The flames could spread across tens of feet and was an extremely vicious attack.The fire flared up and many people cried out in panic. The guards scattered around the Black Tiger Gang's den broke into an uproar.On the roof of a house in the distance, Lin Xun was still very calm. He didn't stop after shooting the first arrow. He waited for an opportunity to quickly follow up with another ten arrows.Beng! Beng! Beng!The Blazing Sun Arrows screeched across the night sky like meteors, almost bursting many people's eardrums. The arrows all took different routes and instantly penetrated the Black Tiger Gang's den.There, everything fell into chaos. Numerous figures scampered about like headless flies. They were at a loss on what to do without Old Tiger Lu leading them.That gave Lin Xun the best chance to kill.Each Blazing Sun Arrow produced a loud thunderous boom as it struck someone with one hundred percent accuracy. It was as though the raging sun was wreaking havoc!In the blink of an eye, the Black Tiger Gang's den had become a sea of flames. Everywhere were tragic cries, furious roars, and raging flames.The majority of the Black Tiger Gang members were ordinary people and only a small number were cultivators. Moreover, Old Tiger Lu had brought all the elites in the gang with him; consequently, the den was left in an extremely vulnerable state.One round of a shower of arrows had thrown them into disarray and made them flee in panic. However, a small number of cultivators remained calm in comparison. They had encountered an enemy attack in the past.Those cultivators hid, ready to strike back.They knew that Gang Leader Old Tiger Lu would surely return as quickly as possible after receiving the news. They only needed to persist for a while, and when he returned, regardless of how many enemies there were, they would be struck with the most brutal attack!\u201cListen! Carefully hide, and if you encounter any invading enemies, kill without mercy!\u201d roared a burly middle-aged bearded man.He looked muscular and fearsome as he clasped a double ax and stood behind a giant stone pillar like an iron tower.A fire raged around the main entrance and flames danced in the air but a young figure in black strode through the inferno.She was holding a bone spear and was wearing a black wind-proof robe. The brim of her hat covered most of her face, and only a small part of her beautiful and fair chin was exposed, making her look particularly mysterious.A little girl?The burly man frowned, not expecting the enemy to be a little girl.<sub>This_content is taken from elworld.com</sub>But soon, he controlled his emotions and assumed a fierce look. It doesn't matter who it is. Anyone who dares to break in must die!Xia Zhi seemed unconcerned about everything around her as she only walked straight ahead. Her pace seemed slow but she arrived at the hall in the blink of an eye.When she came to a stone pillar, a roar suddenly boomed out\u2014\u201cDie!\u201dAmidst the roar, a bright and sharp giant double ax swung down. But just as it was about to strike, Xia Zhi was no longer there.The burly man's pupils rapidly shrank. He realized the situation was very bad but it was already too late.With a pop, a bone spear skewered right through his chest from behind and pulverized even his heart.The burly man dropped to the ground with a loud thud, his eyes bulging, and he couldn't rest his eyes even in death.\u201cHall Master Liu is dead!\u201d\u201cWho was that little girl? Why is she so terrifying?\u201d\u201cWhere is she? Where did she go?\u201dThe cultivators hiding in different places in the hall were frozen with terror and their hair stood on end when they saw the burly man being killed in a single attack.It was too terrifying!They would have thought that it was an illusion if they hadn't witnessed it with their own eyes.They didn't dare to move rashly. Instead, they increased their vigilance and just prayed that their gang leader would hurry back. Otherwise, they likely wouldn't be able to survive.\u201cAh\u2014\u201dSuddenly, a tragic scream rang out and a cultivator hiding on the roof beam tumbled to the ground. His throat had a hole pierced through it and it was spewing out blood.That scene again filled the other cultivators with terror and left them trembling. Before they even saw what happened, another comrade of theirs had been slain!Is she a ghost?Boom!Very soon, one side of the main hall crumbled down, whipping up dust and smoke. A cultivator's body lay among the collapsed wall. His bones were crushed and his flesh mangled. It had been a miserable death.Seeing this, the cultivators, who were hiding in other places, were unable to bear the terror anymore. They jumped out screaming. They had decided not to scatter around the hall but gather together.The enemy was too terrifying. They could neither see nor perceive what happened. The enemy seemed able to disappear without a trace and their comrades were instantly killed one after another.Who could bear this?A dozen cultivators huddled together, their eyes blazing wild with fear. Although trembling in fear, they were extremely vigilant of their surroundings.

The fire had already spread to an uncontrollable state.Some people were still defending to the end, hoping that Old Tiger Lu would return in time. But many more people chose to flee. It had become a scene of complete chaos.These criminals who were considered at the bottom of society would rather choose their lives over loyalty.As Lin Xun walked into the Black Tiger Gang's den, he saw many people fleeing in panic. They raced past the hall and completely ignored him.Soon, Lin Xun saw dozens of cultivators ready in battle formation and waiting for his arrival. This was completely different from what he expected.Do these guys not know how to hide?\u201cI leave these people to you. I have another affair to deal with.\u201d By the time Xia Zhi's voice entered his ears, she had already vanished.Lin Xun narrowed his eyes and then smiled. He drew out the Flame Blade and charged toward the dozens of cultivators!Armed with just his blade, he planned to take on dozens of cultivators by himself!Even the Black Tiger Gang cultivators gathered in the hall couldn't help but find it absurd. Most importantly, he was only a youngster!But when they thought of the little girl's terrifying ability, that absurd feeling instantly faded and they went on alert. The youngster might even be more powerful than the little girl.Boom!Seeing Lin Xun speed towards them, someone couldn't help but pick up a spear and thrust it forward. The spear moved like lightning and the tip was incomparably sharp; it contained astonishing aeth power.It's a fifth-layer True Martial Stage expert!This thought flickered in Lin Xun's mind. Without the slightest hesitation, he brought his buzzing blade down at the opponent's spear!Bang!A terrifying landslide-like force blasted his opponent and his spear across the air and sent them smashing into a stone pillar. Spurting blood from both his nose and mouth, his opponent fainted on the spot.At the same time, all sorts of weapons\u2014blades, swords and hammer\u2014were launched from different directions at Lin Xun. The moves were tricky, ruthless, and precisely timed.Lin Xun leaped into the air and his blade started to rotate, turning into a whirlwind. Waves of flames exploded as they rolled like the flowing ocean.With a loud boom, the enemy's blade snapped into two along with the person's right arm. Screaming, he frantically drew back.Whereas the sword and hammer were sent hurling across the air, leaving the other two cultivators exposed. Taking advantage of this opportunity, Lin Xun changed attacks once again. He suddenly slashed down.With a sickening thud, the hammer-wielding cultivator's head was crushed and tumbled to the ground.<sub>Try the elworld.com platform_for the most advanced_reading experience.</sub>The sword-wielding cultivator had evaded in time and narrowly escaped, but he was so frightened that his face was deathly pale and his soul had almost left his body.Three people had been slaughtered in seconds!Lin Xun had only performed three moves of the Six Word Blade. His blade skills might not be comparable to Xia Zhi's but it was more than enough to deal with the cultivators present!Moreover, he was equipped with all sorts of rune armaments and had a Flame Blade. He was simply armed to the teeth and his strength was at least thirty percent stronger than usual.On the flip side, very few of his opponents had seen cultivators at the eighth layer True Martial Stage. Most of them were only around the fifth layer True Martial Stage and posed no threat to Lin Xun.After all, when Lin Xun was only at the fifth layer True Martial Stage, he was already evenly matched with Du Xiao, a seventh layer True Martial Stage expert. Now that he had broken through to the sixth layer, his strength was, of course, superior to before.After witnessing several comrades being killed in the blink of an eye, the Black Tiger Gang cultivators in the hall all turned ashen-faced, and shock filled their hearts.\u201cQuick! Let's join hands to kill that kid!\u201dFollowing a loud roar, the cultivators simultaneously charged forward. No one dared to hold back anymore. Every one of them looked ferocious as they surrounded Lin Xun.Fighting cries rang endlessly in the hall. The walls collapsed, the ground cracked, and various items in the hall had been crushed to powder.Die!Lin Xun fought with his blade. His figure was as vigorous and nimble as a flying monkey. The Flame Blade swung in all directions and crimson blade light shot out with terrifyingly destructive power.Although it was Lin Xun's first time up against dozens of cultivators, he didn't panic at all. His dark eyes were deep and calm, and his handsome and warm face didn't ripple at all.But beneath his calm exterior, fighting intent and murderous intent were blazing.Fight!The smell of blood and fire, as though by magic, opened up a desire in Lin Xun's heart that he had never felt before.Kill! Kill! Kill!This young man, who was from a mine prison, clasped his blade like a frightening dragon and stirred up a storm of blood. His long hair billowed wildly around his face.The miserable screams of the enemy as they fell vitalized Lin Xun's fighting spirit and made it become even stronger like stirring music.The blood poured out from the enemy was like the strongest wine in the world and made Lin Xun experience a joy that he had never felt in the past.At that moment, Lin Xun had completely forgotten himself. He was fully immersed in the battle. He had forgotten everything about mundane life and all the compromises and plots needed to live in the world!In his eyes, there were only enemies!Bang!A cultivator failed to evade in time, and his head was severed off.<sub>The source of this_chapter; elworld.com</sub>Hua!On the other side, a cultivator's legs were slashed off and left burning in the flames while he collapsed into a pool of fire and blood.Boom!A bronze mace suddenly swung down behind Lin Xun and struck his shoulder. Fortunately, the Cloud Mountain shoulder armor engraved with an earth guarding rune had absorbed most of the impact. But he still broke his shoulder blade.But Lin Xun didn't seem to notice. He wildly drew back, spun around and lunged his blade into his attacker, tearing his stomach open!This was a close-quarters fight. It was fierce, cruel, and there was no room for hesitation. Life and death could be decided in a split second.At that moment, Lin Xun wasn't only ruthless towards the enemies, he was even more ruthless towards himself. He would rather fight and get injured to seize every opportunity to kill the enemy.Enemies constantly fell, and Lin Xun was riddled with scars and soaked with blood.But his gaze never wavered once, and the Flame Blade was even more precise, ruthless and steady in his hand. He resembled a god of war who would never fall. He launched his blade among blood and flames, playing out the changes of life and death.It seemed like a long time had passed but it also felt like a split second. He suddenly felt his body become light and when he looked around, only seven or eight opponents were left.Around his feet lay mangled corpses in pools of blood that were still burning in raging flames. A charred smell stung his nose and filled every corner.More than half of the enemies had been slaughtered!Lin Xun awakened from the battle and realized that he had become incredibly powerful\u2026Lin Xun was perhaps still at the True Martial Stage and there was still a distance until he reached the Spirit Dipper Stage, but the present him was eons away from the thin and weak youngster that had just arrived at Feiyun Village!The seven or eight cultivators opposite him were evidently aghast. Their expressions were full of undisguisable terror. The teenager opposite them was like a demon bathing in blood and made their entire bodies tremble uncontrollably.They were scared out of their wits.Not only could they not do anything to a teenager at the sixth layer True Martial Stage but even after they joined forces, the majority of them had also been killed!What sent a chill to their hearts was that Lin Xun's killing method was extremely direct. He didn't utter a word from beginning to end, yet that silence and unwavering will made them feel suffocated.What kind of teenager is he?!Da!Lin Xun moved again. He stepped into a pool of blood, making a dull sound.No one would notice that sound in the past, but in this silent and suffocating hall, it was like the death knell!The eight cultivators' bodies stiffened, and then, they immediately roared in panic and bolted out of the hall.They were already terrified and their fighting spirit was already completely gone. They had no desire to struggle in the slightest when they were on the verge of death.<sub>This_content is taken from elworld.com</sub>Flee!Must flee!That youngster is a demon who kills without batting an eye. He's too terrifying!Lin Xun was first taken aback but then he shook his head. He was too lazy to chase after them. He scanned the hall and walked towards its depths.The pain all over his body pounded his mind like the tide. It was only after the battle ended that he realized that despite being armed with various aeth tools he had still sustained a lot of injuries\u2014blade wounds, sword wounds and internal injuries\u2026These weren't important to Lin Xun. As a criminal in the mine prison had once said, scars were the most glorious feat of a man!The only thing that made Lin Xun frown was that his aeth power had been exhausted after a round of fighting and killing, and he couldn't endure much longer.He urgently had to find Xia Zhi!Soon, Lin Xun disappeared into the depths of the hall.The walls of the hall crumbled down behind him; the stone pillars were destroyed, and a sea of bodies was burning in pools of blood. The scene resembled hell.Outside the main hall, the great fire surged to the sky and illuminated the night. Everything was an indication that the Black Tiger Gang's den had completely fallen!Old Tiger Lu saw a towering inferno by the time he returned with a group of subordinates. The den that he had worked so hard to build for many years was completely shrouded in flames.In an instant, Old Tiger Lu's face turned livid and his eyes almost cracked.Behind him, his subordinates couldn't help but cry out loud. Their faces blanched. When we left, there were still many people in the old den. Could they have all met with disaster?\u201cLeader! Leader, you're finally back!\u201d A cultivator with a dirty face and disheveled hair rushed over and burst into tears.\u201cWho did this?\u201d Old Tiger Lu's voice seemed to be squeezed out from between his teeth and was filled with endless coldness.\u201cIt's a teen and a little girl!\u201dA man hissed through gritted teeth. \u201cNot only did they kill many of our brothers, but they also set our territory on fire! Leader, you have to avenge our brothers!\u201dEveryone was in an uproar. The attacker isn't from another gang, but turned out to be just a teenager and a little girl!And they destroyed our den with just two of them? How is that possible?\u201cWhere are they?\u201d Old Tiger Lu grew livid and his eyes were red and bloodshot.He suddenly remembered that the target they were going to kill was a teenager called Lin Xun. Could it be that Lin Xun didn't run away, but took the opportunity to destroy our Black Tiger Gang?Old Tiger Lu's heart sank again. He had fallen into a trap!<sub>The source of this_chapter; elworld.com</sub>\u201cThey're inside!\u201d The cultivator pointed inside the Black Tiger Gang's den.Old Tiger Lu was boiling with rage.

It was a scene of complete devastation.As Old Tiger Lu walked forward in big strides, his heart ached like it had been slashed by a knife when he saw the devastating sights. Those were his subordinates. All of that was his hard work!How could Old Tiger Lu not be furious to see everything completely destroyed?His face was ashen, his eyes bloodshot and he emitted a terrifying aura like he was about to swallow someone as he quickly went into the hall.All his subordinates had already begun the search for traces of the enemy, but Old Tiger Lu was more concerned about something else.Before long, he came to the end of the hall.There should have been a stone wall there, but now a huge hole had split it open, revealing a spiral staircase that led to the underground.\u201cDamn it!\u201dOld Tiger Lu's cheeks twitched uncontrollably. He motioned with his hand, gritted his teeth and commanded, \u201cYou all stay here and wait!\u201dAs he issued the command, he was already rushing into the hole and then he disappeared down the spiral staircase.The Black Tiger Gang subordinates glanced at each other in puzzlement.\u201cThat seems to be our Gang Leader's treasure trove?\u201d whispered someone.\u201cIt's more than a treasure trove. The wealth that our gang leader has accumulated over the years and all the properties that our gang have plundered are stored there!\u201d\u201cBut from the looks of it\u2026the enemy has already discovered it.\u201dThere was a clamor of discussion everywhere, and everyone's face grew overcast. If Old Tiger Lu hadn't given an order, they would have charged in to find out what was going on.However, they also knew that, regardless of whether the treasure trove had been looted or not, Old Tiger Lu wouldn't let them near the treasure trove given how he loved money more than his life.\u201cAh, we clearly have come back too late. The thief has likely escaped already,\u201d someone sighed, and it made the others even gloomier.The bottom of the spiral staircase was a basement room with moonstones embedded into all the walls. The soft glimmer around them dispelled the darkness.<sub>Visit elworld.com for a better_user experience</sub>This was the Black Tiger Gang's treasure trove!When Old Tiger stepped into the basement and saw the situation inside, his vision flashed black and he almost vomited blood.In the huge space, the dozens of giant bronze boxes that were originally packed with gold, silver, jewelry and aeth medicines were now in disarray, and the copper locks on them were all destroyed. The boxes had been completely emptied and not a single copper coin was left behind!All of that was the wealth that Old Tiger Lu had spent decades to accumulate. The suffocation, anger, and madness that Old Tiger Lu felt made him look malevolent. The veins on his forehead throbbed and burst, and he finally couldn't help but roar in fury, \u201cDamn it!\u201dHis voice was like a clap of thunder, shaking the walls.Boom!Suddenly, the corner of the innermost wall suddenly crumbled, revealing a bronze door; however, a crack had split the door open and there was enough space for a person to squeeze through.Old Tiger Lu was so infuriated that his entire body trembled and his eyes almost split apart and bled.It was a door that he personally made as an escape route for himself. If any unpredictable danger were to happen, he could safely run away with all his wealth.In order to create the door, Old Tiger Lu had hired a rune master to engrave a rune lock on it.In the end, Old Tiger Lu even killed the rune master to prevent him from leaking his secret. Who would have thought that the escape door would be discovered and even damaged?!Old Tiger Lu's beard and hair were bristling and crackling from anger. His qi pulsed and raged around him and his ashen face was incredibly terrifying. How would he not know that the enemy had already taken all his wealth and left through the escape door that he made?His decades of hard work had only helped something else in the end. Old Tiger Lu was so furious that he almost went berserk and his heart was about to explode.\u201cCurse you, bastard! Don't let me catch you, otherwise I will slash you thousands of times until you bleed to death!\u201d he thundered.Shua!A blade flashed in the corner of his eyes like a bolt of lightning. It was aiming to kill Old Tiger Lu from behind.Hm?Though Old Tiger Lu was immersed in wrath, his fighting instinct remained. He immediately sensed danger approaching, but instead of evading, he spun around and thrust his palm forward!Rumble!Instantly, the terrifying Spirit Dipper Qi transformed into a tangible form and tumbled like raging waves, scattering even the air.Before the blade even neared, it was whipped away like a little boat in a vast ocean.Bang!<sub>Try the elworld.com platform_for the most advanced_reading experience.</sub>A black shadow slammed into the wall in the distance and let out a grunt: it was Lin Xun.However, at this moment, his face was deathly pale, his pupils constricted, and his heart rapidly palpitating. Is this the power of a Spirit Dipper cultivator?He originally thought that the timing of his sneak attack was perfect, and that, even if he couldn't kill him, he could at least severely wound him.Who would have thought that he only found out that he was wrong when they exchanged attacks? And he was ridiculously wrong!As a cultivator at the Spirit Dipper Stage, Old Tiger Lu's entire body was shrouded in a forcefield formed from his Spirit Dipper power. It was impossible for Lin Xun to break this layer of Spirit Dipper power let alone get near him!Just now, Lin Xun felt like a fish pushed into the sea and before he could react, he was swept away by a huge wave, unable to struggle or defend!That was the terror of a Spirit Dipper cultivator.Once someone reached this cultivation stage, their body would be shrouded in spirit dipper qi like an iron wall full of destructive power. It was impossible for a True Martial cultivator to even get close to a Spirit Dipper cultivator!Even though there was only one level between the True Martial Stage and the Spirit Dipper Stage, there was a world of difference in power. It was akin to an ant trying to shake a mountain.\u201cLittle bastard! You didn't run away! Hahaha!\u201dOld Tiger Lu wasn't surprised but delighted to see that Lin Xun hadn't escaped because it meant that there was a chance of retrieving his treasures.At that moment, Old Tiger Lu's mood was like a rollercoaster, alternating from sorrow to joy. He could barely control his emotions any longer.While speaking, he was already speeding across the air and folding his fan-like hand into a claw. He firmly aimed for Lin Xun.Rumble!The dazzling black spirit dipper qi transformed into a giant claw that looked real and shrouded space.This was the ability of Spirit Dipper cultivators. They had the ability to release Spirit Dipper Qi outside the body and kill from a distance! A True Martial Stage cultivator simply couldn't achieve this.However, as Old Tiger Lu was hovering in midair, his expression dramatically changed, as if he had noticed something. His years of fighting experience made him subconsciously twist his waist and limbs strangely, like a snake coiling up from the ground. But he had to suddenly forfeit his attempt to grab Lin Xun and instead slammed hard to the other side.At the same time, a bone spear suddenly appeared. Its smooth, jade-like body was glistening with strands of silvery starlight, making it appear illusory and mysterious.It seemed slow, but by the time that Old Tiger Lu had noticed it, the tip was already piecing in between his eyebrows!Boom!With a loud boom, terrifying aeth power rapidly spread like a storm wreaking havoc. The dozens of bronze boxes were instantly swept up and smashed against the walls, producing dull collision noises.Lin Xun's expression abruptly changed. Unexpectedly, Old Tiger Lu was clasping the bone spear in his hand and Xia Zhi, who was holding the spear, was held up in the air!<sub>Visit elworld.com for a better_reading experience</sub>\u201cAs I thought, there is another person. I knew that kid can't possibly break into my territory with his strength. So, the mastermind behind today's incident is you, little girl!\u201dOld Tiger Lu roared with laughter, his face sinister and cruel, and his hazel eyes filled with deceit. He had moved unhindered in the slums for tens of years and was still standing tall, so how would he be an ordinary person? The opponents who had underestimated him were all now buried underground!The way that Lin Xun failed to withstand even a single blow made Old Tiger Lu suspect that he had a helper. Sure enough, he only needed to use one move to expose his real opponent!The pleasure of revenge filled Old Tiger Lu's heart.But an uncontrollable chill surged in Lin Xun's heart. Old Tiger Lu is too cunning. Xia Zhi and I have underestimated him!Without any hesitation, Lin Xun sprinted out to save Xia Zhi.However, Xia Zhi suddenly raised her head, revealing her beautiful face hidden beneath the hat. At that moment, the entire basement seemed to have dimmed. An indescribably stunning face that seemed to not belong to this world had suddenly appeared.Lin Xun was mesmerized. Xia Zhi's beauty seemed more dazzling than before, and even gave off a charm that could sink one's soul.Her beauty also took Old Tiger Lu's breath away as he stared in astonishment.Pu!After a muffled sound, Old Tiger Lu's thunderous roar resounded in Lin Xun's ears, completely snapping him to his senses.When he looked up, he saw that the bone spear, which Old Tiger Lu was clasping, had somehow pierced through Old Tiger Lu's chest.At the same time, Xia Zhi was sent flying with a palm strike!\u201cF** your mom!\u201dLin Xun was so furious that his eyes almost popped out and an uncontrollable anger surged in his heart. He suddenly charged forward and slashed his blade down at Old Tiger Lu.Seeing Xia Zhi sent flying felt like a stab to his heart. That feeling was so strong that Lin Xun went berserk.Lin Xun didn't realize but when his rage took over and he lost himself, blood-like vortexes were reflected in the depths of his eyes. And at the bottom of the vortexes was an endless abyss.Pu!With a single slash, Old Tiger Lu's head split from his body and hurled across the air. It had been unusually easy to kill him because Xia Zhi had already pulverized Old Tiger Lu's heart and completely severed his life force.Lin Xun's slash only instantly ended his process of death.However, Lin Xun seemed to have gone mad. He didn't care about anything, and after severing Old Tiger Lu's head, he continued to slashed his body repeatedly dozens of times with the Flame Blade until his corpse became a bloody mangled mess.\"Lin Xun, we should go.\u201d<sub>You can_find the rest of this_content on the elworld.com platform.</sub>Xia Zhi's voice sounded. Although it was a little weak, it woke Lin Xun up, who was in a frenzy of rage. He rapidly gasped for breath and rushed over to Xia Zhi.He saw the little girl curled up on the ground, her little face a rare pale and weak shade and her dark jewel-like crescent eyes also were incredibly dull and lifeless.Lin Xun's heart ached again. He didn't care about anything else, so he picked up Xia Zhi, yanked the bone spear out from Old Tiger Lu's body, and darted towards the bronze door that had already been broken open.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

In the dark and complicated alley that seemed to extend and twist endlessly like a cobweb, a youngster was frantically running with a little girl in his arms.The biting cold wind felt like a knife stabbing into his wounds. But compared to the worry in his heart, it was nothing.Lin Xun didn't know when it had started, but for the first time, he realized that Xia Zhi had somehow occupied an irreplaceable place in his heart.He felt his entire world collapsing when he saw her wounded and sent flying. All his thoughts, all his willpower were gone at that moment, leaving him with only uncontrollable anger and madness.That feeling made Lin Xun's heart tremble because, for the first time, he saw that he had an irrational side.Xia Zhi, who was held in his arms, opened her eyes and silently gazed at Lin Xun's face. She said nothing but there seemed to be an imperceptible smile on her pale little face.He saw that Courtyard No. 49 was within sight, but before he could breathe a sigh of relief, he saw someone waiting by his door.At the same time, the figure turned around and met Lin Xun's gaze. It turned out to be Gu Yanping, the owner of Golden Jade Hall.He swept a glance over Lin Xun and, as though realized something, he assumed a serious expression and said, \u201cIf you believe in me, I can stand guard here.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d Lin Xun's voice sounded hoarse.While expressing his gratitude, he was already rushing into the house with Xia Zhi in his arms. He was too occupied to think about why Gu Yanping would appear at his door at this hour.Gu Yanping watched Lin Xun disappear into the house and then turned around and stood silently in front of his door like a gate guardian.His appearance was average, but when he stood there, he exuded an unshakable might.Not long afterwards, a young man was hurrying along the alley in the distance. It was Gu Yanping's son Gu Liang. \u201cFather, we have already investigated carefully. The Black Tiger Gang's den had been set aflame. It is said that a powerful enemy broke in, but the specific details aren't clear now.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d Gu Yanping nodded. \u201cLin Xun has returned. You should get ready. I don't think it will be peaceful tonight.\u201dA chilling murderous look flashed in his eyes.\u201cFather, I heard that the Black Tiger Gang is working for a Spirit Dipper cultivator. We\u2014\u201dBefore Gu Liang could finish his sentence, Gu Yanping interrupted. \u201cNo matter who it is, no one can step through this door tonight.\u201dHis voice was resolute.<sub>Visit to elworld.com discover_new novels.</sub>Gu Liang was taken aback at first, but he then nodded silently.\u201cLiang'er, remember that a business cultivator isn't a deceitful and sly person, and even more isn't a lowly person who takes advantage of a situation.\u201dAfter a moment of silence, Gu Yanping suddenly said calmly, \u201cWe owe Lin Xun a debt of gratitude and we have to repay him with kindness. It has nothing to do with whether he will work with us in the future.\u201dGu Liang was shocked by his father's words, but he nodded solemnly. \u201cI understand.\u201dGu Yanping nodded, peering into the deep night sky. Tonight will likely be very long.In the room, Lin Xun carefully set Xia Zhi down on the bed. While he was worried about what medicine to use to treat her, she suddenly said aloud, \u201cI just need to cultivate for a while to recover. You don't need to worry.\u201dLin Xun breathed a sigh of relief. \u201cYou really don't need to take medicine?\u201dXia Zhi shook her head. \u201cWe've killed Old Tiger Lu and so it will inevitably lead to chaos within the Black Tiger Gang and attract the other gangs' attention. The Chopstick Gang will no doubt be impacted so you have to be extra careful.\u201dLin Xun understood what she meant.After the death of Old Tiger Lu, the Black Tiger Gang would fall into chaos without a leader. It was the perfect opportunity for other gangs to attack, and so the other forces in the slums, of course, wouldn't miss such an opportunity.This had nothing to do with Lin Xun, but he still had to be on guard in case the other gangs wanted to take the opportunity to deal with him and Xia Zhi.Everyone in the slums knew that Lin Xun was the brain of the Chopstick Gang, and the Chopstick Gang was constantly expanding and had already seriously threatened the survival of other gangs.If the other gang members learned that he and Xia Zhi were wounded, they would be delighted to take advantage of the situation to kill him and Xia Zhi.When the snipe and the clam fough, only the fisherman profited.Given the circumstances, the other gangs would no doubt act when they clearly understood the situation.Xia Zhi was already beginning to cultivate on the bed. Her method was extremely unique. She sat on her knees, straightened her back, and pulled her shoulders back. Then, she put her hands together, intertwined her fingers to form a strange hand seal, and placed it in front of her chest.An invisible force was released from her, and her entire body started to float in the air.It was unknown when the bone spear began to rest on her knees. Wisps of clear and bright silvery light floated up from the spear's surface and seeped into Xia Zhi's body. Her breathing was long and quiet like she had sunk into a mysterious cultivation training.In the past, Xia Zhi only ate and slept. She didn't seem like she had to cultivate and this was also the first time that Lin Xun saw her cultivate.So mysterious!<sub>Foll_ow new_episo_des on the elworld.com platform.</sub>This was the strongest feeling in Lin Xun. He quietly stared at her for a long while until he saw that her breathing was stable, and then, he breathed a sigh of relief and quietly walked out the room.Lin Xun had long known that Xia Zhi was very mysterious so he wasn't too surprised.Night dropped its curtain and the sky was covered with thick clouds and not a star or the moon was visible, making the night particularly dim and dull.Lin Xun came to the courtyard and started to treat his wounds.He took off his shoulder armor, wrist guards and inner armor, exposing his body to the air. A criss-cross of bloody scars and bruises peppered his body. He also had sustained internal injuries to his shoulders, ribs and waist.Each injury represented unbearable pain. Hence, the sum of all of them together could only be incredibly agonizing.However, Lin Xun didn't seem to notice. His brows didn't furrow once.He had to quickly recover because tonight was undoubtedly going to be tough.\u201cYoung Master, if you don't mind, I can help you.\u201dIt was unknown when Gu Yanping had walked into the courtyard. He studied the wounds on Lin Xun's body and couldn't help feeling aghast.\u201cNo need. I'll treat them myself.\u201d Lin Xun smiled and went to clean each wound with clean water.Gu Yanping said regretfully, \u201cIf my son hadn't come back to tell me in time, Young Master, you might have been in a bit of trouble. I'm afraid I still don't know how you suffered such serious injuries.\u201dIt was only then that Lin Xun remembered that Gu Liang had come by in the evening. It was obvious that what he told Gu Liang caught Gu Yanping's attention and made him make a trip to his house in the middle of the night.\u201cIt's nothing. The people from the Black Tiger Gang wanted to kill me, so I have to kill them first.\u201dAfter Lin Xun cleaned his wounds, he took out the medicine that he had prepared and carefully applied it to each wound. He suddenly smiled. \u201cFortunately, I have killed Old Tiger Lu and I can relax a little.\u201dOld Tiger Lu is dead.Gu Yanping gasped in shock and his gaze towards Lin Xun started to change. He was certain that Lin Xun didn't lie.That meant that Old Tiger Lu, a Spirit Dipper cultivator, was no longer in this world.Gu Yanping couldn't calm his emotions when he thought about how Lin Xun could possibly kill a Spirit Dipper cultivator. This youngster is indeed incredible.However, Gu Yanping didn't question Lin Xun. By the time he finally calmed down, he remembered another thing he wanted to tell Lin Xun. \u201cThe death of Old Tiger Lu will inevitably tear his gang apart. And when such a situation arises, other gangs will cast covetous eyes at the Black Tiger Gang.\u201d<sub>New novel_chap_ters are published here: elworld.com</sub>Lin Xun interjected. \u201cShopkeeper Gu, you might not know that those forces will likely be coming to find me tonight.\u201dHe frankly recounted the sequence of events to Gu Yanping and hid nothing about the Chopstick Gang.Hearing this, Gu Yanping seemed to see through Lin Xun's intention. He nodded sincerely. \u201cThe Flame Blade that you sold us last time had helped greatly Golden Jade Hall. Tonight, let me help you guard the door.\u201dLin Xun got up and respectfully bowed. \u201cI'm sorry to trouble Shopkeeper Gu. If you have anything you need me for in the future, just tell me.\u201dGu Yanping chuckled. \u201cAlright, but don't call me Shopkeeper Gu, it sounds too distant.\u201dLin Xun also laughed. \u201cThen I'll take the liberty to call you Uncle Gu.\u201dGu Yanping chuckled again, seemingly quite happy. \u201cDon't worry and rest well. I will go outside to take a look now and see how many people will come to die tonight.\u201dHe turned around and left.Lin Xun overflowed with emotions as he watched him disappear out of the door. Uncle Gu isn't ordinary.Gu Yanping was indeed not ordinary. He had created a sensation in Donglin City with just a Flame Blade and made Golden Jade Hall rise to fame.This surely wasn't something that ordinary people could achieve.Now, based on a sentence from his son Gu Liang, he paid Lin Xun a visit and helped Lin Xun a great deal. The man wasn't just gilding the lily; he was providing much needed coal during a cold snow. But even so, Gu Yanping had never made any demands from Lin Xun. He simply didn't seem like a businessman.However, Lin Xun knew that he owed him a huge favor. If Gu Yanping had any request in the future, Lin Xun wouldn't refuse.This is intelligence and capability. He not only made me feel extremely grateful but also handled the matter beautifully.Lin Xun was thoroughly impressed.Meanwhile, Gu Yanping, who was standing outside the door, was also feeling quite emotional. He had lots of life experience and had met many talented young people with remarkable cultivation aptitudes. There were all sorts of people. Some had abnormal intelligence and some had abnormal skills. Compared to those people, Lin Xun wasn't that great yet there was something unique that made him completely different from the others. Gu Yanping couldn't put his finger on what it was, but he was certain that, without any accident, Lin Xun would no doubt reveal his brilliance and amaze the world in the future.Would there be such a day?Gu Yanping's mind drifted off and he recalled a lot of past events.Suddenly, footsteps from the alley snapped him out of those thoughts and made him narrow his eyes vigilantly.He was still standing there motionless, but a terrifying aura was faintly gathering and circulating around his body. Although his appearance was average and his face honest-looking, he exuded a threatening and imposing presence.<sub>Visit to elworld.com discover_new novels.</sub>Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

In the past, the Black Tiger Gang had constantly expanded its territory and controlled many sources of ill-gotten gains due to Old Tiger Lu, a Spirit Dipper cultivator, overseeing the gang.But after his death, the Black Tiger Gang had lost its sharp fangs. It was akin to an attractive piece of meat that everyone wanted to take a bite of.There was only one opportunity. If they couldn't grasp it, it would be too late to regret it later.So that night, almost all the gangs in the slums took action, including the Green Bamboo Gang, the Black Water Gang, and the Venomous Scorpion Gang.Suddenly, all the alleys in the slums were full of fierce-looking gang members. Like packs of hungry wolves smelling blood, they instantly pounced on the territory that belonged to the Black Tiger Gang.Soon, the sounds of fighting, yelling and cursing rang in various areas. The glint of blades and the shadows of swords criss crossed in the dark night. The foul wind and rain of blood was an indication of the tragic battles of life and death.That night wasn't peaceful at all.The dark sky that shrouded the slums also seemed to be bleeding.Before long, someone found out that the leader of the Chopstick Gang killed Old Tiger Lu and it was said that the leader of the Chopstick Gang was seriously wounded in the fight.Regardless of whether the information was true or not, many gang leaders saw another opportunity and were tempted.The Chopstick Gang was seen as a rising star in the slums. It had risen strongly in less than a month and swallowed up five to six nearby gangs. It was seen as a serious threat to other gangs.Now, when the other gangs heard that the death of the Black Tiger Gang leader was related to the Chopstick Gang, they immediately realized that they could make this situation in front of them into one where they were the fisherman taking advantage of the fight between the snipe and the clam.Perhaps, we can take this opportunity to swallow up the Chopstick Gang's territory too.It wasn't long before a group of people arrived at the entrance of Courtyard No. 49.They were from the Venomous Scorpion Gang and they worked for Chai Shao, who was the second most important person in the gang and was nicknamed Poisonous Sparrow Hawk.Chai Shao was at the eighth layer True Martial Stage and was notorious for his ruthless means and viciousness. Countless people had died in his hands over the years.Behind Chai Shao stood a group of gang members, around a dozen people, and all of whom were cultivators.According to the brain of the Venomous Scorpion Gang, such a strong elite force was more than enough to get rid of the severely wounded gang leader of the Chopstick Gang.<sub>Updated_at elworld.com</sub>Of course, it didn't matter even if the leader escaped because they wanted to take over their territory and so it might be even better.\u201cDon't let other gangs get ahead of us. Once we kill the leader of the Chopstick Gang, this area will be our Venomous Scorpion Gang's territory.\u201d Chai Shao shouted, urging everyone. Inside his heart, he was quite pleased with himself and eager to act.Most of the other gangs were racing to take a chunk of the Black Tiger Gang's territory, and the Venomous Scorpion Gang was the first to eye the Chopstick Gang.However, when Chai Shao arrived in front of Courtyard No.49, the person standing in front of the gate took him aback.The person was average-looking and just stood there modesty like an ordinary person. But Chai Shao panicked when he saw the man.That's definitely not the leader of the Chopstick Gang.But who is it?Chai Shao was very cunning. His eyes glinted and he motioned his hand as he commanded, \u201cLet's charge in together!\u201dInstantly, all the cultivators from the Venomous Scorpion Gang were dispatched. Every one of their faces were ruthless and sinister. But as for Chai Shao, he quietly hid behind them and didn't charge forward.Even until now, his heart was still palpitating. He had sensed danger and decided to wait and see what happened.Gu Yanping's lips twitched in disdain when he saw the cultivators charge over. He folded his arms and lightly flicked the air.Hua!The sound of rushing water suddenly rang in the air and a wave of dazzling azure spirit dipper power soared like a real water dragon and wandered back and forth between Gu Yanping's palms, making whistling sounds that resembled a dragon's roar.The Secret Art of the Water Dragon Roar!The cultivators who were charging towards him suddenly felt their vision blur before they flew across the air and smashed into the surrounding walls. Their muscles and bones snapped and they lost consciousness instantaneously.Gu Yanping's attack seemed very relaxed but it had suppressed dozens of people at once. He made it look as easy as crushing dry weeds and wood.How powerful was the attack to be able to achieve that?In the distance, Chai Shao seemed to have been struck by lightning, He inhaled sharply. A Spirit Dipper cultivator?He is able to unleash aeth power and kill enemies from a distance. Also the means of turning spirit dipper power into a water dragon is no ordinary skill.Why would a guy like him be willing to stand at the gate of Courtyard No. 49?A chill ran down Chai Shao's body and he subconsciously spun around and bolted.However, the water dragon leaped across the air and instantly drowned Chai Shao's entire body. He frantically struggled while screaming before his body plunged to the ground and he died on the spot.<sub>New novel_chap_ters are published here: elworld.com</sub>The sudden battle ended in seconds. Gu Yanping had simply used one move to suppress everyone present.His ability astonished Lin Xun, who was watching at the door. He didn't expect Gu Yanping to be a Spirit Dipper expert.Moreover, Lin Xun had a strong feeling that Old Tiger Lu would be no match for Gu Yanping if he was still alive.His attack was too unbelievable. The man's spirit dipper power had transformed into a water dragon and its roar shook the universe. Its light was so dazzling that it tore apart the night. Gu Yanping's power was too terrifying and it made Lin Xun wonder whether he could even survive the attack just now.\u201cFather, why did you kill him?\u201d Gu Liang hurried over from a distance and asked in puzzlement.Gu Yanping didn't answer him but looked at Lin Xun who was standing by the gate inside. \u201cLin Xun, do you know why I left them here?\u201d\u201cKill the chicken to warn the monkey.\u201d Lin Xun answered briefly with a smile.\u201cI see.\u201d Gu Liang's face lit up with understanding.The gang members in the slums were frequently dispatched tonight because of the Black Tiger Gang. They were like flies smelling blood. It no doubt wouldn't be peaceful.Likewise, the situation was extremely unfavorable and dangerous for Lin Xun.The elites of the Venomous Scorpion Gang had just come but other members of other gangs would also appear soon. If they didn't demonstrate their powers, even if Gu Yanping was around, it would be quite troublesome.\u201cCan I ask why I don't see members of the Chopstick Gang tonight?\u201d Gu Yanping suddenly asked.Lin Xun said casually, \u201cI ordered them to hide and not get involved no matter what they hear.\u201dGu Yanping understood right away. He generously complimented Lin Xun. \u201cWhat a good strategy of watching the tigers fight.\u201dGu Liang looked at Lin Xun in surprise. \u201cDid you already predict that so many things would happen tonight?\u201dLin Xun patiently explained, \u201cI made these preparations just in case. Once Old Tiger Lu dies, the other gangs would no doubt try to take over the Black Tiger Gang and tragic battles would inevitably happen when a group of hungry wolves fight for the same piece of meat. The Chopstick Gang can't avoid the other gangs if we participated so I thought it would be better to lie low and watch the tigers fight.\u201dAfter a pause, he continued, \u201cThe other gangs might occupy a lot of the Black Tiger Gang's territory after the battles, but they will also lose a lot of power. It will be easy to swallow up those gangs in the future.\u201dAfter listening to Lin Xun's logical and calm analysis, Gu Liang marveled, \"No wonder my father admires you so much. You are indeed different from others.\u201dHe previously didn't think much of Lin Xun because he was only thirteen to fourteen years old, which was just a few years younger than him. But his impression of Lin Xun had tremendously changed after hearing the younger boy's logical analysis and about his amazing feat in slaughtering Old Tiger Lu.Lin Xun smiled, turned around, and walked into the courtyard.The brawl between the gangs continued throughout the night and disturbed the peace in the entire slums. Many residents couldn't sleep as a result.After the Venomous Scorpion Gang left, many more gangs sent people to come to take the Chopstick Gang's territory.<sub>Visit elworld.com, for the best no_vel_read_ing experience</sub>However, when they saw the corpse of Chai Shao and the bodies of dozens of Venomous Scorpion Gang cultivators, they all retreated without any hesitation. They hurried away with all sorts of perplexed, shocked and complicated feelings.That night was particularly long.However, Lin Xun was especially calm. He sat alone in the courtyard, meditating and recuperating like he had completely forgotten that their situation was still very dangerous.However, his calm state of mind made Gu Yanping think even more highly of him.Meanwhile, in a dormitory of Donglin Academy, Lian Fei was pacing back and forth. His eyes were bloodshot but he had no intention of sleeping.Why is there still no news?The Black Tiger Gang's work efficiency is so low.Lian Fei was restless. He was very worried because if he failed to kill Lin Xun this time, he wouldn't have a better chance to get revenge in the future.Suddenly his door was pushed open and a gust of cold wind poured in through the door. The biting coldness made Lian Fei shiver all over before he saw that it was Xue Yong who came.It was just that Xue Yong looked extremely bad. He said through gritted teeth as he came in, \u201cThe operation failed.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Lian Fei cried out in disbelief. How is that possible?He suddenly became visibly agitated. His face was malicious and ruthless as he reached out to grab Xue Yong by the collar. \u201cOld Tiger Lu is an expert at the Spirit Dipper Stage. He has thousands of members under his command. How could he lose?\u201dXue Yong pushed Lian Fei away and said coldly, \u201cI'm not afraid to tell you that Old Tiger Lu not only lost, but is dead. The murderers are Lin Xun and a little girl.\u201d\u201cThink about it yourself. I still have to return to the clan to report this.\u201d Xue Yong flung his sleeve and stormed away.Wu\u2014The cold wind howled and the door creaked.However, Lian Fei seemed unaware. His expression was blank as he murmured, \u201cA cultivator at the fifth layer True Martial Stage slaughtered a Spirit Dipper expert\u2014how is that possible?\u201dLian Fei only regained his composure after a long while, though the cloudy expression remained on his face.He knew that his repeated failures and Old Tiger Lu's death would make the Wu Clan re-evaluate Lin Xun's danger level and they wouldn't act rashly after this.This indicated that Lian Fei had lost the power to support his revenge. Even if he couldn't accept it, he had to endure it.\u201cLin Xun, don't be so smug. Sooner or later, I will take your little life as an offering for my father.\u201dLian Fei's handsome face was awe-inspiring yet sinister, as though there was a savage beast roaring in his heart.<sub>This_content is taken from elworld.com</sub>Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 85": "Chapter 85\nJun 11, 2022Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 85 Reactions of the Various PartiesIt was currently the wee hours of the morning with daybreak soon approaching.Lin Xun was currently immersed in his cultivation training. His injuries were not severe and should fully recover in three to five days with the help of some medicine.This was mostly thanks to the rapid growth in his physique. Ordinary injuries were no longer a problem as long as they weren't fatal.Lin Xun was currently visualizing the Six Word Blade Art in his head.He had single-handedly slain a dozen True Martial cultivators in the battle at the Black Tiger Gang's base. However, he had no chance to properly analyze each detail in the heat of the battle.As he slowly recalled the fights, numerous things soon became clear.Battle was never just about theoretical discussions. Although the Six Word Blade Art only had six moves, each move contained numerous subtleties. It was a unique blade art that combined both viciousness and difficulty.At the end of the day, the Six Word Blade Art was a technique that was made for fighting. There was no way to properly understand its essence without battle.In the past, due to Lin Xun's lack of battle experience, he was only able to reach the elemental level despite his efforts, finding himself stuck and unable to make further progress.After being tempered and polished by blood and battle, Lin Xun realized that he had learned plenty from his experiences. Many subtle key points he could never understand before were gradually becoming clear in his mind.\u201cI should be able to push the Six Word Blade Art to the precise level after a few more battles.\u201dLin Xun knew that tonight's battle had deepened his understanding of the Six Word Blade Art, raising his control and knowledge of its power to whole new levels.The sound of people conversing outside suddenly drew Lin Xun's attention. He immediately got up and walked out.It was already the wee hours of the morning with dawn fast approaching. The fighting in the slums district was also gradually dying down.Gu Yanping, a powerful Spirit Dipper stage expert, was stationed at the entrance to Lin Xun's residence, eliminating the possibility of other gangs attacking.Who would come at this time?When Lin Xun walked out of the courtyard, he saw an unexpected person: the Stone Cauldron Alms treasure appraiser, Wang Lin.<sub>The latest_epi_sodes are on_the elworld.com website.</sub>Lin Xun was especially surprised to find that Wang Lin was not alone. He had brought a group of subordinates, who were holding bloody heads in their hands.Could Mu Wansu have heard of what happened and sent Wang Lin as reinforcements out of kindness?However, this thought was immediately denied the moment it emerged.Mu Wansu was a decisive woman who made clear distinctions between love and hate. If she wanted to help, she would have already made arrangements while the Black Tiger Gang was preparing to deal with him. It was impossible for her to have waited till now.Then why is Wang Lin here?Lin Xun was unsure of why Wang Lin, who had indifferently driven him out of Stone Cauldron Alms just a few days prior, was here. Although Lin Xun knew it was Mu Wansu's idea, he still held a small grudge against the man.On that day, he had personally sent the Flame Blade into the Stone Cauldron Alms' hands with the belief that they would understand his good intentions while also hoping to repay their help. Who could have predicted that he would instead be chased out, which did not feel good at all.Wang Lin was conversing with Gu Yanping, but immediately smiled and called out when he saw Lin Xun appear, \u201cYoung Master Lin Xun, I hope you won't blame me too much for disturbing you so late at night.\u201dLin Xun smiled, \u201cUncle Wang Lin is too polite.\u201dHis attitude was neither cold nor friendly, neither servile nor overbearing. There was zero indication that he was going to invite Wang Lin in.At this observation, Wang Lin could not help but sigh inwardly. Looks like the little guy is still somewhat resentful.Despite this, Wang Lin's smile grew friendlier as he said, \u201cI heard some crooks wanted to cause trouble for Young Master Lin Xun and immediately hurried over to provide assistance. Along the way, I encountered some crooks who were going to pick a fight with the young master. Hence, I decided to take matters into my own hands and take them down.\u201dAs he spoke, he pointed towards the string of heads carried by his subordinate, \u201cPlease have a look, young master, there seem to be a few big shots from the Green Bamboo Gang among them.\u201dLin Xun immediately understood. Wang Lin was here to express his goodwill. He had evidently found out about Lin Xun's relation to the Chopstick Gang and sought to express his sincerity by attacking the Green Bamboo Gang.Why had Wang Lin done so?It was clearly related to the Flame Blade he had sold to Golden Jade Hall a few days ago. Wang Lin had likely connected the dots and made the decision to try and make up for before and gain Lin Xun's favor.\u201cMany thanks Uncle Wang Lin.\u201d Lin Xun cupped his hands together.\u201cHaha, this is nothing. I'm happy as long as you are safe.\u201d Wang Lin laughed heartily, his voice booming loudly.<sub>New_chap_ters are pub_lished on elworld.com</sub>Gu Yanping suddenly said, \u201cLin Xun, it will be morning soon. Since the situation has stabilized, I shall not disturb you any further and will take my leave.\u201d\u201cPlease wait Uncle Gu.\u201d Lin Xun suddenly recalled something and hastily returned to the room. He returned with a package, which he handed to Gu Yanping, \u201cThis is a small gift, please accept it.\u201dGu Yanping raised his brow, \u201cPlease take it back if it's just money, I did not help you for such things.\u201dLin Xun chuckled, \u201cUncle Gu should open it and take a look.\u201dGu Yanping contemplated a little before ultimately opening the package. His eyes immediately narrowed when he saw the Flame Blade lying within, gleaming with an icy light.Wang Lin's heart violently shook at this sight. As expected, Lin Xun had more than one Flame Blade and most definitely had some relation to the mysterious rune master.Gu Yanping swiftly kept the blade and glanced at Wang Lin. Gu Yanping then nodded at Lin Xun, \u201cGolden Jade Hall does need such a treasure to keep up appearances at the moment. I will accept this gift, but when it is sold, Golden Jade Hall will give you a fair cut of the profits.\u201dLin Xun wanted to say something but was stopped by a wave of the hand from Gu Yanpang. He smiled and said, \u201cLet's do things this way. Alright, I'll be leaving now.\u201dHe turned around and left with Gu Liang. The professionalism and discretion Gu Yanping displayed were clearly different from other merchants.This was a merchant cultivator.After Gu Yanping left, Wang Lin also bid his farewells and swiftly departed with his subordinates.Lin Xun did not urge Wang Lin to stay a while and watched him leave. Lin Xun knew that Wang Lin would definitely tell Mu Wansu everything when he returned to Stone Cauldron Alms.Lin Xun wondered what Mu Wansu would think when she found out he had more than one Flame Blade.Some mischievous ideas popped in his mind but he soon shook his head.He and Mu Wansu were not enemies, and he did owe Stone Cauldron Alms. Although Lin Xun had some criticisms about her, he would not resort to such tricks just for some petty revenge.The Flame Blade he had allowed Wang Lin to see was a signal for Mu Wansu to review her attitude towards Lin Xun.He did not dwell on the matter and closed the gates before returning to the room. He found Xia Zhi was still in meditation with no indication that she was about to awaken. After today's affair, Lin Xun felt that as long as the Wu Clan and Lian Fei were not fools, they should restrain themselves somewhat.The Wu Clan.<sub>Visit elworld.com for a better_user experience</sub>The brightly lit discussion hall was filled with the sounds of arguing.The bickering had not stopped ever since the Black Tiger Gang's Old Tiger Lu had been killed. Seated in the hall, Clan Leader Wu Qun, First Elder Wu Yunshan, Second Elder Wu Yushan and Third Elder Wu Lanshan wore dark and stormy expressions.Everyone was quarreling over whether to continue going after Lin Xun's life.Some pinned Wu Henshui's, Wu Jie's and the others' deaths on Lin Xun and demanded his death to preserve the clan's dignity.Others argued that Black Widow, Du Xiao and Frowning Oldy and even the Black Tiger Gang's Old Tiger Lu had already been killed, causing their Wu Clan to pay a huge price for nothing.This proved that Lin Xun was no easy target. They felt that it would be better to take a step back and reassess their plans instead of continuing the operation.Both views had their justifications. Hence, the room could not come to a consensus no matter how long they debated.Right before daybreak, an informant came with news that finally put an end to the long debate.The news was simple: the Golden Jade Hall Manager, Gu Yanping, had stepped forward to support Lin Xun.Stone Cauldron Alms' Wang Lin had also led a team of guards to Lin Xun's residence, signalling that Stone Cauldron Alms had also decided to stick their hand into this matter.When the Wu Clan higher-ups heard the news, they finally realized the severity of the matter. In the end, they agreed to temporarily take a step back and reevaluate the situation.They did not fear a youngster like Lin Xun, but had to consider the threat of Stone Cauldron Alms. The Golden Jade Hall Manager, Gu Yanping, was also not simple and was a powerful Spirit Dipper stage cultivator. This level was considered top-tier even in Donglin City.Under such circumstances, the Wu Clan could do nothing no matter how sullen they felt or how much they didn't want to take this lying down. They had no choice but to change their strategy.Dawn broke, chasing away the darkness of the night as the world welcomed a new day.The curtain had long fallen on the bloody chaos in the slums Although there were still some undercurrents, the situation had stabilized for now.The night's events had been limited to the commoner district and had not really affected the rest of Donglin City. It was normal, after all, for gangs to be wiped out and new gangs to be born in the slums each year. As such, the city's residents were long used to such happenings.On this new morning, Golden Jade Hall announced again that they would be selling a new Flame Blade, causing a huge uproar and drawing many people's attention.Wang Lin walked in the deepest courtyard of Stone Cauldron Alms and prepared to report the night's events to Mu Wansu.<sub>You can_find the rest of this_content on the elworld.com platform.</sub>In the slums' 49th residence, Lin Xun hurriedly finished his bath and began training in the messy and badly damaged courtyard.In the room, Xia Zhi was still silently cultivating; her peaceful, beautiful little face like a painting under the morning light.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

A beautiful woman would never allow her sloppy side to be seen by outsiders.Mu Wansu was undoubtedly extremely beautiful, mature and enchanting, like a ripe honey peach that would make anyone's imagination run wild.When Wang Lin arrived to seek an audience, Mu Wansu had already completed her morning ritual with her pretty face now glowing beautifully.She asked with a slightly surprised tone, \u201cWhat's so important that you had to come so early to report?\u201d\u201cIt's related to Lin Xun.\u201d Wang Lin did not hide anything and told her everything he had seen last night.As he spoke, he did not notice Mu Wansu's originally glowing face turn somewhat cloudy.When Wang Lin came to the part where he helped Lin Xun take down several key figures of the Green Bamboo Gang, Mu Wansu could no longer stop herself and interjected, \u201cWho told you to help him?!\u201dHer tone was cold and accusatory.Wang Lin was silent for a moment before he answered, \u201cMiss Wansu, you instructed me to keep track of Lin Xun's activities a few days ago. I found out yesterday that Golden Jade Hall's Gu Yanping had moved long before me. Do you know what he did?\u201dMu Wansu frowned and impatiently said, \u201cSpit it out.\u201dAny mention of Lin Xun made her mood turn extremely sour for some unknown reason, leaving no trace of her usual elegance and composure.\u201cGu Yanping is a Spirit Dipper stage expert, but he willingly became a door guard for Lin Xun and even his son, Gu Liang, was dispatched as well.\u201dWang Lin sighed and said, \u201cI could not understand his intentions initially, but I subsequently realized that the key lay with Lin Xun.\u201dMu Wansu was confused and her black brows furrowed even deeper, \u201cWhat exactly are you trying to say?\u201dUpon seeing that Mu Wansu had clearly lost her patience, Wang Lin stopped beating about the bush, \u201cLin Xun has more than one Flame Blade and I am certain he has some connection to the mysterious rune master.\u201dMu Wansu's heart trembled, \u201cHow do you know?\u201dShe was indeed very concerned about the mysterious rune master. After all, Donglin City's many merchant groups were all searching for this individual.Everyone knew that if they could get their hands on the mysterious rune master, he would definitely bring them immeasurable wealth in the future.Although Stone Cauldron Alms was a giant merchant group which could call itself a top-tier faction even in the empire, Mu Wansu could only depend on herself to expand the Stone Cauldron Alms branch in the remote Donglin City.<sub>New novel_chap_ters are published here: elworld.com</sub>\u201cI personally witnessed Lin Xun hand a Flame Blade to Gu Yanping yesterday. Moreover, Gu Yanping has already announced news about the blade this very morning, causing a substantial commotion. Miss Mu Wansu can easily verify this with a simple check.\u201dMu Wansu became silent. Wang Lin had no reason to lie to her. However, she could not fathom how a youngster like Lin Xun had established such close relations with the mysterious rune master in less than a month since he left Feiyun Village and entered Donglin City.This is far too inconceivable!After a long while, Mu Wansu asked, \u201cIn other words, we can only find the mysterious rune master through Lin Xun?\u201dWang Lin nodded, \u201cIt is exactly as you say.\u201dAfter a slight pause, he continued, \u201cMiss Wansu might not know this yet but the boss of the slum district's biggest gang, the Black Tiger Gang, was killed by Lin Xun last night.\u201d\u201cOld Tiger Lu?\u201d Mu Wansu was abruptly alarmed, \u201cLin Xun is only a True Martial fifth layer cultivator. How can he possibly kill a Spirit Dipper stage expert?\u201dWang Lin nodded, \u201cI initially found this absurd as well. But it subsequently occurred to me that it might be related to the mysterious rune master. An existence who can create the Flame Blade is definitely no ordinary person!\u201dSuch an explanation made sense and even Mu Wansu could not help but waver.The two, however, were still unaware that they were already going down the wrong track\u2026However, it wasn't surprising for them to reach such a conclusion. Xia Zhi's existence had always been overlooked because she was too young and very seldom showed herself. Moreover, no one would believe that a True Martial stage cultivator like Lin Xun could craft something like the Flame Blade. Hence, they could not help but surmise that there must be a master acting from the shadows.This series of misunderstandings resulted in numerous deviations from the truth.Under such circumstances, even if Wang Lin's information clearly told him that only Lin Xun and Xia Zhi had attacked the Black Tiger Gang's base, Wang Lin would still ignore Xia Zhi and attribute everything to the mysterious rune master behind Lin Xun.Because, in his mind, this was the only logical explanation.Mu Wansu's heart churned. Her rationality told her that everything Wang Lin said was true. However, she felt a wave of depression when she thought of Lin Xun's loathsome face.Do I really have to lower my head to that devious and shameless brat?Mu Wansu suddenly asked, \u201cRight, didn't you help Lin Xun last night?\u201dThis single sentence told Wang Lin that Mu Wansu's attitude had changed. He hurriedly nodded and said, \u201cI wouldn't really call it help. It's more like trying to make amends.\u201d\u201cDid the kid show any gratitude?\u201d Mu Wansu continued her questioning.Wang Lin poured himself a cup of tea and said, \u201cAt the very least, he didn't reject or show resistance.\u201d<sub>This_content is taken from elworld.com</sub>Mu Wansu nodded as a thoughtful look surged in her clear eyes, \u201cLin Xun should have come to Donglin City to participate in the district examination. If that's the case, invite him to meet me after the district exam is over.\u201dWang Lin immediately hesitated, \u201cMiss Wansu, I'm afraid that it'll be better if you went\u2026personally.\u201dMu Wansu was taken aback but soon understood Wang Lin's meaning, causing her to feel another wave of frustration and sullenness. After a long silence, she took a deep breath and said, \u201cAlright, I will take the initiative and pay him a visit when the time comes!\u201dShe felt agonized. So I ultimately have to bow my head to that punk\u2026However, Mu Wansu quickly regained her energy. If that little punk thinks that he has won because of this, he's underestimating me too much!Three days later.When Lin Xun finally completed repairs on the badly damaged residence, Xia Zhi awoke from her meditative state.The first thing she said when she opened her eyes was: \u201cI'm starving!\u201dDespite this, Lin Xun was overjoyed and the final remaining worry in his heart vanished. He hastily dashed into the kitchen and unleashed all of his talents to cook Xia Zhi a sumptuous meal.While eating, Lin Xun discovered that Xia Zhi seemed to have changed slightly after awakening. She now gave off an additional unfathomable aura of superiority.Lin Xun could not help but ask, \u201cYour power has grown?\u201d\u201cMm.\u201d Xia Zhi continued to eat as she vaguely answered, \u201cThe battle was quite beneficial to my cultivation. If I have to face someone like Old Tiger Lu again, it will not be as troublesome as before.\u201dLin Xun gasped. How is this only quite beneficial? It is a universally-shocking improvement!Xia Zhi casually asked, \u201cWhat about you?\u201dLin Xun immediately shut his mouth, finding himself unwilling to answer. He had only deepened his comprehension of the Six Word Blade Art, and it was indeed hard to raise his head if he compared himself to Xia Zhi.Fortunately, Xia Zhi was clearly more interested in her food than Lin Xun and did not pursue the question.Lin Xun secretly breathed a sigh of relief, \u201cSince you're awake, I no longer have to worry. I will probably go to Donglin Academy soon. The district exam will take place in six days and registration has already started at Donglin Academy.\u201dXia Zhi acknowledged this and said, \u201cRemember to bring back some books. I don't want any of those random strange novels where the protagonist only fights and kills. They are so boring.\u201dLin Xun chuckled and promised her he would.<sub>The most up-to-date nov_els are published_here > elworld.com</sub>Donglin Academy.The usually peaceful academy had become extremely busy for the past two days. There were pedestrians everywhere and the streets were filled with horse-drawn hansoms.Some of the students in navy-blue uniforms acted as guides, helping to give directions in the academy.The district exam registration period lasted for two days and it was the grandest annual event in Donglin City!Anyone who passed the district exam would obtain recognition from the empire. The passer would not only be rewarded with a substantial sum of money but also receive the qualifications to participate in the prefectural exam.In addition, those who passed the district exam might catch the eye of powerful factions; this was an opportunity which might help them soar into the sky and obtain numerous cultivation resources!Hence, although everyone knew the contents of the exam were simple, no one dared to underestimate the empire's method of selecting talent.After all, the cultivators who passed the exam were at most fifteen. They possessed excellent cultivation potential and would definitely grow into true experts if nothing unexpected happened!In fact, the more outstanding individuals would have unlimited cultivation prospects.They were a group of seedlings with potential in the cultivation world. Although they were not remarkable now, they would definitely not be ordinary in the future.Hence, when the yearly district exam began, it would draw the focus of the entire Donglin City. Everyone wanted to see which lucky souls would pass the exam.At the same time, it was also a very attractive chance to recruit talent for the many Donglin City factions, and no one would willingly miss it.When Lin Xun arrived at Donglin Academy, he found a bustling scenery sprawled before his eyes, a sea of people rushing here and there.Some of the young registrants were even accompanied by their entire clan, a sight that deeply moved Lin Xun and made him feel for all the parents in the world.The status and privileges of cultivators in the Ziyao Empire were indeed incomparable to the ordinary folk.However, becoming a cultivator was still far from enough. Only cultivators who were acknowledged by the empire would bring glory and honor to themselves and their ancestors.The district, prefecture, provincial and national exams were excellent tools to select talent. The person who came up with these exams was most certainly far-sighted and wise.Every year of exams would give a huge batch of potential future pillars to the empire, replenishing new blood which would gradually strengthen the empire!Of course, Lin Xun did not see so far, but he understood that it was no simple feat to create such talent selection methods.<sub>Visit elworld.com, for the best no_vel_read_ing experience</sub>He felt rather expectant as he wondered how far he could go.The district exam?

The ones in charge of these booths were students of Donglin Academy.Despite such arrangements, there were still too many registrants, creating long lines behind each booth.Lin Xun could only start queuing behind one of the booths and silently wait for his turn.The registration process was very simple. A person only needed to pay a fee of ten copper coins in exchange for a district exam participation token.While he was queuing, some discussions suddenly drew Lin Xun's attention.\u201cAmazing, I've heard that the chief examiner for this year's district exam is Lord Yao Tuohai of Qingfeng County!\u201d\u201cWho is he?\u201d\u201cIdiot, thirty years ago, Lord Yao Tuohai was fifteen. At this age, he should have already been a little too old for the district exam, but Lord Yao Tuohai successively passed the district exam, prefectural exam and provincial exam in a single year!\u201d\u201cThat's not even all. When Lord Yao Tuohai participated in the national exam, he displayed unrivalled power which allowed him to stand out amongst countless amazing talents!\u201d\u201cAlthough Lord Yao ultimately came a little bit short in the national exam and failed to enter Qinglu Academy as he hoped to, his outstanding performance managed to catch the prime minister's eye. In the end, Lord Yao was recommended for a post in the empire's central district, making him very famous for a time!\u201d\u201cYou must know that no one from our southwest province has managed to pass the national exam for many years. The fact that Lord Yao managed to climb so high is proof of his capabilities. In the entire southwest province, the only person who can compare to Lord Yao is the Great Commander Liu Wujun, who holds the highest authority in the southwest province!\u201d\u201cMy god! Since Lord Yao Tuohai is so amazing, why has he chosen to oversee the district exam in Donglin City? A bigshot like him is more than qualified enough to oversee the provincial exam!\u201d\u201cNo one knows why Lord Yao has come, but his presence has definitely drawn numerous cultivators to this year's district exam. In fact, I heard that cultivators from nearby cities have also rushed here after hearing the news. Nearly everyone is hoping to be recognized by Lord Yao during the exam and subsequently obtain a successful career for themselves!\u201d\u201cDespicable! These guys are dreaming!\u201d\u201cAh, regardless of everyone's motives, the competition is sure to be fierce with so many cultivators. Since only a thousand people will pass in the end, many cultivators who could have originally met the mark will be eliminated.\u201d<sub>The source of this_chapter; elworld.com</sub>Lin Xun was shocked by this information. He never imagined that this year's district exam would be so different.It was also the first time he had heard of Yao Tuohai. After hearing about his many achievements, Lin Xun understood that this individual was an extremely formidable character.Why has such an illustrious person personally come to oversee the district exam in Donglin City?There must be some important reason!However, Lin Xun couldn't care less about this mystery at the moment and was quite speechless after hearing these conversations. Due to Yao Tuohai's presence, the number of registrants had drastically increased and there would most certainly be several talented individuals amongst them. It was easy to imagine how competitive the final selection would be.\u201cI currently have True Martial sixth layer cultivation and I've yet to reach fourteen years of age. I wonder if this will be enough to pass the district exam\u2026\u201dLin Xun was originally filled with confidence but he now became somewhat uncertain.The district exam's contents were simple: the first was that the participant had to be no older than fifteen years old and the second was to possess cultivation.One could say that any cultivator who dared to register would definitely fulfil these two conditions. However, due to the limited number of passing spots, the district exam would only choose the cream of the crop. Ordinary cultivators were destined to be eliminated!It soon came to Lin Xun's turn.Two Donglin Academy students were seated behind the booth: a girl and a boy. One was in charge of collecting the registration fee, while the other's duty consisted of giving out the participant token and recording the registrant's information.After handing over ten copper coins, the female student seated behind the booth raised her head and asked, \u201cPlease report your name and birthplace.\u201dLin Xun casually answered, \u201cLin Xun, from Donglin City Feiyun Village.\u201dThe male student's head jerked upwards at these words, \u201cYou're Lin Xun?\u201dThe male student had an upright appearance and looked like a capable person. However, his expression was currently a little dark, a slight contrast to his bored, lethargic and unconcerned appearance from earlier.His gaze had become as sharp as a knife as he stared at Lin Xun; clearly somewhat unable to control his emotions.However, the male student quickly realized he had lost self-control. He immediately withdrew his gaze and regained his composure.<sub>New novel_chap_ters are published here: elworld.com</sub>Lin Xun raised his brow, \u201cYou know me, friend?\u201dHis keen senses had picked up faint killing intent leaking out from the student earlier. Although it had been well hidden, it was impossible to conceal from Lin Xun.\u201cI mistook you for someone else.\u201d The male student shook his head, his voice now somewhat cold.Lin Xun acknowledged and smiled, \u201cWhat a coincidence then.\u201dThe male student expressionlessly handed Lin Xun a token, \u201cThere are many coincidences in this world and sometimes unfortunate happenings. You should leave quickly so as to not obstruct others from registering.\u201dLin Xun rubbed the token in his hand for a while before suddenly lowering his upper body. Smiling, he looked at the male student behind the booth, \u201cCoincidences are always the result of karma. Friend, I believe we will be meeting again in the future.\u201dHis words seemed to hold a deeper meaning. After speaking, he turned around and left with a chuckle.Only after seeing Lin Xun's figure disappear did the male student's face darken again as iciness flowed in his eyes.\u201cLian Fei, is there something wrong?\u201d The female student asked in surprise. Lian Fei's expression had become far too ugly and this was definitely not normal.\u201cIt's nothing.\u201d The male student shook his head. With a deep breath, he recollected himself and smiled, \u201cDon't worry Susu. Let's continue our duties. Many people are here to register today and we need to work as quickly as we can.\u201d\u201cMhm.\u201d The female student nodded. She was no fool and had already sensed something was up during the earlier interaction.She secretly wondered to herself, Was that the enemy Lian Fei wanted to deal with for the past few days? He's just a kid, and here I was thinking he was some three-headed six-armed monster. Lian Fei doesn't like me interfering in his affairs but since I now know who this enemy is, how can I possibly do nothing and watch him swallow his anger in silence? After all, he's\u2026the man I, Yao Susu, has chosen!\u201dLian Fei!As Lin Xun walked out of Donglin Academy, he recalled the appearance of the male student. Lin Xun had already roughly guessed the student's identity.Lin Xun had very few enemies in Donglin City. Lian Fei was the only enemy he had in Donglin Academy.Lin Xun had not been able to recognize Lian Fei at a glance because they had never met before. It was honestly a stroke of fate to finally meet this foe today. In fact, Lin Xun had already felt the impulse to kill Lian Fei earlier.<sub>Visit elworld.com for a better_user experience</sub>Lin Xun ultimately restrained himself. Donglin Academy had tight security and there were many experts stationed nearby. He could not afford to act so recklessly.However, he had committed Lian Fei's appearance to memory. There would always be a chance to eliminate him in the future!Lin Xun also understood that Lian Fei would love to avenge his father. Hence, Lin Xun would absolutely not give Lian Fei any chances.Pedestrians seemed to be knitted together on the busy street, brushing shoulders as they traversed through the crowd. Various noises rang nonstop, creating quite a din.Numerous people were talking about Yao Tuohai. He could be said to be the hottest topic in Donglin City.News of his arrival to oversee the district exam was akin to a storm that shook the entire city. Many were trying to guess Yao Tuohai's true goal for coming here.After all, it felt like a huge waste for someone of Yao Tuohai's status to oversee the district exam.Lin Xun did not pay much attention to this. No matter how famous Yao Tuohai was, it had nothing to do with him.Lin Xun soon arrived at Liji Bookstore, walked in, and greeted the owner, Old Uncle Li, whom Lin Xun was already reasonably acquainted with. He then began selecting books for Xia Zhi.The sky was still bright when he left Liji Bookstore and Lin Xun found himself with some rare free time to relax. He leisurely strolled along the street, stopping from time to time to purchase sweet foods, fruits, and roasted meat.Due to the threat from the Wu Clan and Lian Fei, Lin Xun had been pretty tense for the past few weeks. He had used every last second he had to make various preparations and had not stepped out of the slums for nearly half a month.Since the threats were mostly resolved for the time being, Lin Xun was naturally not going to push himself too hard. The road of cultivation was not a race, and too much focus on cultivation training would instead be less effective.It was not long before Lin Xun's gaze was drawn towards a place by the roadside called Donglin Martial Training Hall and he soon found himself stopping in front of it.\u201cYoung hero, would you like to have a try? There are aeth testing stones installed in our Martial Training Hall which can accurately gauge a cultivator's aeth power. This knowledge will be a huge help to your future cultivation.\u201dAn errand boy swiftly approached, his eyes shining as he warmly invited Lin Xun in, \u201cBesides aeth testing stones, our Martial Training Hall also has specialized practice rooms for cultivators which contain copper skin puppets of various levels. You can freely test the power of your martial dao without risking injuries.\u201d\u201cOh? I can also train my martial dao here?\u201d Lin Xun immediately became a little interested.Upon seeing that Lin Xun seemed to be interested, the errand boy hurriedly struck while the iron was hot, \u201cIf the esteemed sir is not interested in these things, our Martial Training Hall also has a martial arena where you can spar with other cultivators. You can even win prizes for each victory!\u201d<sub>Visit elworld.com for a better_reading experience</sub>Lin Xun had no interest in the arena but was somewhat tempted by the aeth testing stone and the martial practice rooms. He was curious to find out his current power level.After some consideration, Lin Xun tossed five copper coins to the errand boy, \u201cBring me to aeth testing stone first.\u201dThe errand boy kept the tip with a wide smile, \u201cOf course! Please follow me, young hero!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 88": "Chapter 88\nJun 11, 2022Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 88 Steel Blooded YoungsterDonglin Martial Training Hall occupied a huge space that was divided into three areas: the martial practice rooms, the aeth testing hall, and the arena.As the errand boy led Lin Xun through the place, he would occasionally see various kinds of cultivators. There were even students wearing the Donglin Academy uniform amongst them.However, most of these cultivators only had True Martial cultivation, and it was very rare to find any Spirit Dipper stage experts.Evidently, although the Martial Training Hall was huge, the main customers it drew were True Martial stage cultivators.It did not take long for Lin Xun to be led into the aeth testing hall.He found himself in a large, spacious hall. Dark golden stone tablets that were over a hundred feet tall towered at the center, giving off wisps of aeth power undulations.These were aeth testing stones, which were aeth artifacts rumored to have been created by a great master from the empire's Divine Workshop. The stones could perfectly measure a cultivator's aeth power level.At closer inspection, Lin Xun found that the aeth testing stones were covered in runes. Each rune represented a different meaning.Lin Xun observed that there was a corresponding number to each rune: 100 catties, 400 catties, 600 catties, 800 catties, 1000 catties, etc.The errand boy began to explain, \u201cYoung hero, normally speaking, a True Martial first layer cultivator possesses a 100 catties of aeth power, while a regular True Martial second layer expert possesses 400 catties and so on. Different cultivators will also have different levels of aeth power.\u201dOnly then did Lin Xun understand. Catty was a type of measurement unit for aeth power.The errand boy continued, \u201cYoung hero, you only need to pay ten silver coins to measure your aeth power.\u201dTen silver coins was equivalent to one thousand copper coins. This was a substantial amount.Lin Xun thought about it for a while before ultimately handing over ten silver coins. For the sake of his future cultivation, he needed to know what level his aeth power cultivation had reached.The errand boy accepted the money and carefully withdrew, leaving the giant aeth testing hall to Lin Xun. This was to maintain the customer's privacy.After all, cultivation was the root of a cultivator's power and no one would willingly allow others to see their power level.Lin Xun was quite satisfied on this point.He stepped forward and inspected the aeth testing stone. After a long time, he took a deep breath, circulated all the aeth power in his body and pressed his hand onto the notch at the bottom of the stone.Omm!A strange power rippled from the aeth testing rock. Lin Xun felt as if he was being enveloped by flowing water on both the inside and the outside. Other than this odd sensation, he did not feel any discomfort.Meanwhile, light suddenly emerged on the aeth testing stone's surface and began shooting upwards. It quickly passed the 100 catties, 400 catties, 600 catties and 800 catties rune indicators.<sub>Updated_at elworld.com</sub>It continued to climb from 800 catties.800 catties to 1000 catties represented the regular range of True Martial fifth layer aeth power levels. Where a particular cultivator stood depended on where the light stopped between the 800 to 1000 range.If the light stopped at 800 catties, it would mean that this True Martial fifth layer cultivator's power was relatively weak and could only be considered ordinary.If it stopped at the 1000 catty position, the power in the cultivator's body had already reached the peak of the True Martial fifth layer stage.Normally speaking, most True Martial fifth layer cultivators would range between 800 and 1000 catties.One thing worth mentioning was that the standards were based on the power levels of the average cultivator in this world. No matter how precise the measurements were, it only represented the quantity and quality of aeth power, and did not say anything about how strong a cultivator was compared to others of the same stage.The light soon rose to the 1800 catties mark. This meant that Lin Xun's aeth power cultivation had reached the peak of the True Martial sixth layer.However, it was not over yet!After reaching the 1800 catties mark, the light continued to climb without slowing.Lin Xun could not help but feel surprised.1800 catties to 3000 catties belonged to the True Martial seventh layer aeth power level!Was the power he possessed already enough to match a True Martial seventh layer expert?Before Lin Xun could regain his calm, he saw the light reach the 3000 catties position in a few breaths.However, it was still not over yet!The light soon charged into the 3000 to 5000 catties range. This was the power level which belonged to True Martial eighth layer experts!However, after reaching this range, the climbing light gradually began to slow down.Lin Xun forcibly composed himself and focused on the light.In the end, it stopped at the 4900 catties mark and did not rise any further.This position represented the current level of Lin Xun's aeth power. He only needed a little more to reach the peak of the True Martial eighth layer, Big Cycle!Of note, Lin Xun's cultivation was only at the True Martial sixth layer, Blood Igniting. This meant there was a difference of two entire lesser cultivation stages!From this, it could be seen that Lin Xun's aeth power was already comparable to a peak True Martial eighth layer cultivator!Lin Xun could not help but feel skeptical about the results. Is this aeth testing stone broken?<sub>Updated_at elworld.com</sub>If the result was true, wouldn't it mean that his aeth power was superior to ordinary True Martial eighth layer cultivators?An ordinary True Martial eighth layer expert and a peak True Martial eighth layer expert were two completely different entities!After mulling over it for a long time, Lin Xun ultimately reasoned that it was because of the four aeth power vortexes at his four heart acupuncture points.His aeth power became purer and of higher quality after being refined by the four vortexes. The power contained within naturally also grew extremely terrifying.\u201cSince I already have 4900 catties worth of power, I wonder how much my aeth power will grow after reaching the True Martial seventh layer.\u201d Lin Xun was still thinking about his aeth power as he left the aeth testing hall.When he stepped out of the entrance, however, he saw a flurry of activity in the main hall.He soon saw a group of soldiers in empire-manufactured heavy armor marching toward him. An aura of sternness swirled around them and the few cultivators who were unable to get out of the way in time were thrown aside by the soldiers.In the blink of an eye, the group opened a path in Donglin Martial Training Hall and a tall, soldierly young man wearing a scarlet-red cape strode in.The young man had a broad forehead, tiger-like eyes which seemed to flash with lightning, and a tall, imposing figure. Each movement he made gave off a strong feeling of boldness and disdain.The soldierly young man asked in a commanding voice, \u201cWhere's the aeth testing stone?\u201d\u201cTh\u2026th\u2026there.\u201d An intimidated worker stammered as he pointed behind Lin Xun.The soldierly youngster flicked a sparkling gold coin to the worker, \u201cThis is the fee, use the leftover to buy some alcohol for the brothers behind me!\u201dAfter which, he headed towards the aeth testing hall.Lin Xun silently moved to the side, giving way to the soldierly youngster. With such a grand entrance, the soldierly young man was definitely no ordinary person. He had to be extremely rich to so casually spend a gold coin.The youngster glanced at Lin Xun and suddenly thought of something, \u201cYou just used the aeth testing stone?\u201dLin Xun nodded.\u201cYou look like you're about thirteen or fourteen-years-old. What cultivation stage have you reached?\u201d The young man had a deep voice and was very direct, making him seem rather rude. After all, it was an unspoken taboo to ask about someone else's cultivation level.However, his gaze only contained curiosity and did not appear to be trying to cause trouble.Lin Xun thought for a moment and said, \u201cI just reached the True Martial sixth layer, Blood Ignition. I am far inferior to the esteemed sir.\u201dHe was trying to be modest but the young man did not seem to realize this point, \u201cYou're quite self-aware. I already possessed True Martial ninth layer cultivation when I was nine, but due to concerns about my future, my cultivation was suppressed for four years by my grandfather. Otherwise, I would have advanced to the Spirit Dipper stage four years ago! You definitely can't compare to me in terms of cultivation speed.\u201dLin Xun was taken aback. This fellow is a strange one. Did he really just tell a stranger such things?Moreover, he looked completely serious when boasting. He really is\u2026a marvel.<sub>Visit elworld.com for a better_reading experience</sub>However, Lin Xun also found out that the youngster was the same age as himself: thirteen.However, the young man seemed to have matured rather quickly and looked nothing like a thirteen-year-old. He looked much closer to eighteen or nineteen.While Lin Xun was lost in thought, the soldierly young man had already pushed open the doors and walked into the aeth testing hall.The soldiers in heavy armor were left outside, intimidating everyone in the main hall until no one dared to speak.Several people had already left the place.Lin Xun did not linger for long either and began walking towards the exit.He originally intended to have a look around the martial practice rooms and test the power of their copper skin puppets. However, due to the unexpected encounter and because he was starting to worry about Xia Zhi, who was all alone at home, Lin Xun did not dare to stay any longer.\u201cJudging from the slightly bloody aura around them, they are clearly battle-hardened elites who have been baptised by the fires of war. Moreover, from the insignia on their armor, they seem to be from the empire's famous Steel-Blood Army.\u201d\u201cThe empire's Steel-Blood Army? Oh my god, are you referring to the Steel-Blood Army under the Steel-Blood King who are stationed at the empire's west border?\u201d\u201cWho else would dare to wear the heavy army specially crafted for the Steel-Blood Army?\u201d\u201cBut who is that youngster? Who could have a squad of Steel-Blood soldiers as his guards?\u201d\u201cHe's definitely no simple individual and is likely related to the Steel-Blood King!\u201d\u201cWhat piques my curiosity is that the Steel-Blood Army is stationed at the Blue Sand Province near the empire's western border and is several tens of thousands of miles from Donglin City. Why have Steel-Blood Army troops appeared in Donglin City? Could something big have happened?\u201dBefore he could walk out of Donglin Martial Training Hall's main entrance, Lin Xun overheard some conversations.Steel-Blood King?Was that the same Steel-Blood King Ning Bugui who lived only for battle, preferring to die on a mountain of corpses and lie in a sea of blood, so his body could eternally face the heavens and slumber with the land?Lin Xun could not help but stop and turn his head to glance at the soldiers.Sure enough, he found that the soldiers seemed brave and capable and killing intent leaked from their bodies. They gave off a hardened, steel-blooded aura, as if they were ready to conquer every land under the heavens.\u201cIf these are soldiers under the Steel-Blood King, that youngster's origins are definitely even more astonishing\u2026\u201d A thoughtful look arose on Lin Xun's face, but he soon shook his head and disappeared into the bustling streets outside Donglin Martial Training Hall.Meanwhile, the soldierly youngster angrily roared in the aeth testing hall, \u201cThat little liar. His power is clearly at the peak True Martial eighth layer level, but he lied to me and said he had only had True Martial sixth layer cultivation. Since when has anyone dared to lie to me? How detestable!\u201dIf Lin Xun returned, he would realize that he had forgotten to erase the record on the aeth testing stone when he left because he had been lost in thought about his aeth power cultivation\u2026Unfortunately for him, the record had caused a misunderstanding with the soldierly youngster called Ning Meng.<sub>Visit elworld.com for a better_user experience</sub>Nevertheless, even Ning Meng would not have imagined that Lin Xun was indeed at the True Martial sixth layer\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It had become as busy as a marketplace with a constant flow of visitors.Gu Yanping was capable, trustworthy and principled. He swiftly established a foothold for himself in Donglin City as his business grew day by day.Lin Xun could not help but feel impressed. Gu Yanping was already a Spirit Dipper stage expert, so who could have expected that he would also be so amazing in the merchant ways?When Lin Xun left Golden Jade Hall, he was accompanied by Gu Liang.After slaying Old Tiger Lu three days ago, all the treasures in the dead man's secret underground storehouse had been emptied out by Lin Xun.There was gold, silver, pearls, herbs, pills, and other resources like ores. The entire collection had been painstakingly accumulated by Old Tiger Lu over the past dozen years and could fetch an astonishing price.However, after sieving through everything, Lin Xun found that most of the treasures were of little use to him. He had paid a visit to Golden Jade Hall to sell off the things he didn't need.After being told about it, Gu Yanping cheerfully agreed and sent his son, Gu Liang, with Lin Xun to appraise the value of the goods.Slum district 49th residence.It took Gu Liang an entire incense stick of time to go through all of the articles. His final calculated value was 116 gold coins!Lin Xun was surprised. This sum was equivalent to 11,600 silver coins and 1,160,000 copper coins!It was definitely an astronomical sum to Lin Xun as it could purchase nearly forty Flame Blades priced at 300 silver coins.From this, it could be seen how much wealth the slums' number one faction, the Black Tiger Gang, had plundered over the years.More importantly, these only included the things Lin Xun was unable to use.The herbs, money, aeth resources and other things Lin Xun had already taken out would add up to at least another 100 gold coins as well!<sub>The latest_epi_sodes are on_the elworld.com website.</sub>Lin Xun could only sigh deeply. Conquering and looting were indeed one of the most effective means of obtaining wealth.Under Lin Xun's insistence, 116 gold coins were rounded down to 100 gold coins, completing the exchange with Golden Jade Hall.Lin Xun's act of voluntarily giving up 16 gold coins made Gu Liang feel both admiration and gratitude. He now saw Lin Xun as a person truly worth befriending.Gu Liang promised Lin Xun that he would personally deliver the agreed amount once all of the goods were sold.Gu Liang had no choice. Given Golden Jade Hall's finances, they could not take out 100 gold coins on such short notice.Lin Xun did not mind as he was not in a rush. After settling the details, he began chatting with Gu Liang.Lin Xun soon found out that the second Flame Blade he had given Gu Yanping had ultimately sold for a price of 200 silver coins, an entire 100 silver coins fewer than the first blade.This was quite understandable since scarcity meant value. Any treasure would be at its highest price if it was the only one on the market. Likewise, the price would drop once the second and third pieces appeared.According to Gu Liang, however, the Flame Blade's price would never drop below 160 silver coins no matter how many appeared. After subtracting Golden Jade Hall's share, Lin Xun would earn 110 silver coins.Lin Xun did some calculations; it cost him around thirty silver coins to craft a Flame Blade. If so, selling a Flame Blade would triple his initial investment!Why did rune masters have superior statuses and be so well-respected?It was because rune masters could create astonishing wealth that would make many people jealous. It was as the saying went: what flowed from a rune master's fingers were not runes but endless gold!At the present, Lin Xun was still not a rune master because he could not singlehandedly complete a rune array. He was still considered a rune apprentice.However, the ability to craft aeth tools at the True Martial stage was incomparable talent and the first of its kind!Fortunately, only Lin Xun and Xia Zhi knew of this secret. Otherwise, it would give a big scare to the other rune masters in the world.After all, who would dare to believe a mere thirteen-year-old youngster, who was still far from the Spirit Dipper stage, would already possess the ability to craft aeth tools?If the other rune masters were to find out that Lin Xun could not only craft aeth tools but also have a 100% success rate, who knew what they would think?Of course, if rune masters were to also find out that his Explosion Blades were 20% more powerful than normal, what would they think?<sub>The source of this_chapter; elworld.com</sub>Lin Xun was no greenhorn and deeply understood the concept of keeping a low-profile while amassing wealth. He would naturally not divulge such secrets.However, it was not an easy task to keep these secrets.For instance, Gu Liang suddenly asked, \u201cLin Xun, the second Flame Blade has an extra old 'Xun' word on it which resembles its maker's unique signature. As long as this signature is present, people will know the item is the work of a certain rune master.\u201dAt this point, Gu Liang suspiciously looked at Lin Xun, \u201cCould this 'Xun' word be\u2026\u201dLin Xun answered with a question, \u201cDo you think it's possible given my capability?\u201d\u201cEr\u2026\u201d Gu Liang hesitated for a long time before shaking his head, \u201cIt can't be you. Although there are True Martial stage rune apprentices who are exceptional enough to craft aeth tools, it is very rare to find one. Moreover, all of these rune apprentices hail from old and powerful factions and you would normally never see any.\u201dAfter a pause, he continued, \u201cMost importantly, these two Flame Blades are special. Although they are made from the same materials and rune arrays as ordinary Explosion Blades, the Flame Blade's power is substantially higher, making it a completely new kind of aeth tool. A treasure like this can only be created by great rune masters with amazing ability.\u201dFrom his words and tone, it was clear that Gu Liang would not believe it even if Lin Xun admitted the two treasures had been crafted by him.However, this was good for Lin Xun. At least he didn't need to waste more saliva trying to make his lie convincing.Lin Xun grinned, \u201cGu Liang, no need to keep guessing. I might not be able to promise anything else, but I can guarantee that as long as I'm in Donglin City, I will be able to provide Golden Jade Hall with some aeth tools.\u201dGu Liang had originally wanted to ask about the Flame Blade's creator, but after hearing Lin Xun's words, Gu Liang immediately understood that Lin Xun was not going to divulge this secret.On the other hand, Gu Liang could also tell from Lin Xun's words that he likely had a special relationship with the mysterious rune master. Otherwise, he would not dare to make such a promise.Gu Liang could not help but envy Lin Xun's luck. Who wouldn't envy someone who could maintain a relationship with a rune master?However, Gu Liang did not know that a mere sentence from Lin Xun would veer him so far from the truth\u2026They chatted some more before Gu Liang bid farewell and left.Lin Xun was left alone in the courtyard, his eyes narrowing slightly as he fell into thought.Although it had been less than a month since he arrived at Donglin City, far too much had already happened. In addition, most of it was related to the Wu Clan.First, Black Widow and two assassins had gone after his life, followed by the Black Tiger Gang threatening him and Xia Zhi. Lin Xun's days had not been peaceful.<sub>Foll_ow new_episo_des on the elworld.com platform.</sub>Fortunately, all of it was now in the past. After two painful back-to-back lessons, the Wu Clan should not dare openly take action for a while.However, the threat was still there and Lin Xun would not let his guard down. He knew that the Wu Clan would come after him sooner or later as long as he lived.Thankfully, he had established a strong relationship with Golden Jade Hall and had sent a message to Mu Wansu through Wang Lin a few days ago which should make her reevaluate her attitude towards him.All in all, there was not much Lin Xun needed to worry about before the district exam and he could spend more time training.Compared to these petty matters, Lin Xun was more concerned about his cultivation path. As long as he was strong enough, all these plots and schemes would become jokes!Since Lin Xun had recently advanced to the True Martial sixth layer, it was very difficult to have another cultivation breakthrough any time soon.At the True Martial sixth layer, aeth power could be circulated 108 times in the body which was also known as a single cycle of power. The blood in the body would boil like a furnace, burning with power.The True Martial seventh layer was known as the Little Cycle level. Upon reaching this stage, aeth power could be continuously cycled nine times! The cultivator's aeth power would also undergo rapid development and begin to touch the true essence of circulation.At the present, there were still some ways to go for Lin Xun to reach the Little Cycle level. A breakthrough was unachievable for the time being.For his spirit cultivation, Lin Xun's senses were growing rapidly due to the Little Divine Meditation Art. It would not take long for him to light the third spirit star in his mind-sea.This area was not something Lin Xun needed to worry about at all.Similar to his spirit cultivation, his physique power was constantly growing under the tridaily tempering of the Omega Secret-Realm's trial. Lin Xun's physique was currently at the copper skin iron bone level and ordinary weapons could not hurt him.Lin Xun had changed his destiny and been reborn ever since his four heart acupuncture points had recovered. He had shown unimaginable potential in all areas of cultivation, which had enabled him to reach his current heights.Lin Xun's only regret was that he was still unable to find any news about the arch-enemy who had stolen his Origin Aeth Artery years ago.Since he first entered Donglin City, Lin Xun had visited the library many times to research information about the Grand Abyss Heaven Devourer.However, he had ultimately found nothing.The Grand Abyss Heaven Devourer was a type of Origin Aeth Artery, also known as an innate cultivation talent!There were many cultivators in the world, but only a small handful were born with Origin Aeth Arteries. Such cultivation talents were as rare as phoenix feathers or unicorn horns.<sub>Visit to elworld.com discover_new novels.</sub>Due to these circumstances, there were naturally almost no records about Origin Aeth Arteries.Donglin City was merely a remote border city in the empire's southwest province. It was easy to imagine how impossible it would be to find any information about the Grand Abyss Heaven Devourer here.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Lin Xun continued his daily training routine: polishing martial dao in the day and working on aeth power cultivation, spirit cultivation, and rune studies at night.He did not make any adjustments to his schedule due to the upcoming district exam and was the picture of calm and confidence.Ever since she woke from her heavy injuries, Xia Zhi slept in the day as she did in the past and went out alone at night. Lin Xun did not need to guess where she went. An unlucky gang in the slums would be destroyed every time the lass went out.All in all, life was as normal as it could be at the 49th residence. In contrast, Donglin City experienced numerous big events that shook the entire city.First and foremost, Yao Tuohai had finally arrived in Donglin City to oversee the forthcoming district exam as an examiner.Due to Yao Tuohai's arrival, the number of participating cultivators this year exploded and more than 8000 people had already registered!Only half of those were local Donglin City cultivators. The other half were cultivators that had rushed over from other cities due to Yao Tuohai's fame.This made Donglin City far busier than before. The entire city was abuzz with conversations about Yao Tuohai, discussing why he had come to Donglin City.Meanwhile, news of a squad of Steel-Blood Army soldiers escorting a mysterious youngster to Donglin City created another big splash in the city which was already buzzing with gossip.The Steel-Blood Army!An elite army that was renowned in the empire and was commanded by the Steel-Blood King Ning Bugui!Ning Bugui was one of the empire's legendary experts, and his Steel-Blood Army was equally as legendary amongst the empire's armies. As such, it was easy to imagine how big of a commotion resulted when people heard that a squad of Steel-Blood Army soldiers had escorted a youngster to Donglin City.Why had soldiers from the Steel-Blood Army appeared in the city?Who was the youngster they were escorting and why were they escorting him here?Everyone made guesses and engaged in discussion but no one could give a proper answer.Even the various well-informed Donglin City factions did not know what to make of this.Although Yao Tuohao was officially here to oversee the district exam, everyone knew that his true motive would not be so simple.<sub>Visit elworld.com for a better_user experience</sub>The Steel-Blood guards had escorted a youngster here, but no one knew what they were up to.A layer of mystery was cast over Donglin City, causing the city's atmosphere to turn somewhat strange.Stone Cauldron Alms.Mu Wansu was blankly staring into space, her brows tightly furrowed as if something was weighing heavily on her mind.In her hand was an urgent message which had arrived several hours ago. It was sent from the Stone Cauldron Alms' headquarters in the Forbidden City and contained an unexplained message\u2015 \u201cA bigshot will arrive in Donglin City during this period, please be careful!\u201dThe message made Mu Wansu uneasy. Who is this bigshot? What could have alarmed headquarters so much that they would send such a message?Why did they not dare to put the bigshot's name or give any hints?Mu Wansu's intuition told her that this was no simple matter!She suddenly thought of Yao Tuohai and the youngster escorted by Steel-Blood soldiers.Were they here because of the bigshot?This possibility made Mu Wansu gasp. Yao Tuohai was already someone of amazing status and there was only one person in the entire southwest province who could stand shoulder to shoulder to him: the southwest city governor, Liu Wudiao.The Steel-Blood youngster was likely even more extraordinary. The Steel-Blood guards accompanying him belonged to the Tiger Wolf Division under Ning Bugui! How could someone who could obtain the escort of these guards be an ordinary person?If they had indeed come because of the unknown bigshot, wouldn't the bigshot's identity be even more shocking?Moreover, why was this bigshot coming to Donglin City?The more Mu Wansu thought, the more uneasy she grew. For the first time, she felt that she could no longer properly judge the situation in Donglin City.In the morning four days later.<sub>Try the elworld.com platform_for the most advanced_reading experience.</sub>Lin Xun ate his breakfast but did not begin training today. He had sensed that his physique cultivation had hit a bottleneck and planned to make a trip to Donglin Martial Training Hall in order to test the current power level of his physique.Lin Xun left the slums and walked into the bustling streets. He could feel a clear difference in Donglin City. Cultivators could be seen everywhere, and everyone was talking about the district exam.Because tomorrow morning marked the start of the district exam!Lin Xun was not worried about the exam. He had already done his preparations and only needed to wait for it to begin.He soon arrived at Donglin Martial Training Hall and was respectfully led into a martial practice room after paying ten silver coins.The martial practice room was extremely big; it resembled a small-scale plaza which was filled with copper skin puppets.Copper skin puppets were aeth tools with mechanical parts. The puppet's body was first forged from hard ores before a rune master would be commissioned to carve special rune arrays on the interior. The end product utilized a combination of mechanisms and an aeth power source to move.Some formidable copper skin puppets were even able to engage in battle like real cultivators!However, the Donglin Martial Training Hall puppets were ordinary products that could only execute simple movements. Their greatest function was to measure a cultivator's martial power.When Lin Xun entered Donglin Martial Training Hall, a bizarre procession suddenly appeared in the sky several thousand miles away deep in the Three Thousand Great Mountains.A group of men dressed in the empire's ceremonial palace attire led the procession. However, their clothes were not light purple but deep night-black.There were a total of sixteen men who were split into two rows. They maintained a solemn and dignified air as they marched in the sky, making sure their movements were coordinated and perfect to the tee.It was as if they were not walking on air but on a wide, solid road. Every step and every minute movement they made followed a unique rhythm, neat and orderly as if they were of one mind!Only Spirit Sea stage cultivators could fly in the sky, but not all Spirit Sea stage cultivators had the control and power needed to walk in the air.Even if there were cultivators who could, they might not be able to move at the same speed while maintaining a precise distance between them like the sixteen men in black ceremonial attire!Although these sixteen men had clearly reached the Spirit Sea stage and possessed terrifying power, they were merely vanguards in the procession.There was a single carriage behind them.<sub>New_chap_ters are pub_lished on elworld.com</sub>The entire carriage was black and made from some unknown material. Numerous cryptic rune arrays were carved upon its surface, densely packed together like a vast sea. Under the blue dome of heaven, the carriage seemed to be covered in a layer of eternal night-black.The carriage was pulled by six black horses. The horses' eyes seemed to glow a bluish-jade as if ghost fire burned within them. A single horn rose from their heads like the legendary unicorns. However, unicorns were white while these horses were pure-black, making them look like netherworld ghost horses that had escaped from hell!The sudden appearance of such a procession amidst the wilderness was shocking to say the least, and anyone who witnessed it would definitely doubt their eyes.Liiiiii!The piercing cry of a bird sounded from far away, rippling the clouds. A black shadow flew towards the procession in a flash and arrived beside the carriage.It was a strange black bird that had four claws, pitch-black steel-like wings, and glowing golden eyes. Although it was on the smaller side, it gave off a terrifying aura of savagery.However, the strange black bird suddenly exploded, turning into a tall and imposing old man. The old man was also dressed in black ceremonial attire and his long hair was perfectly combed such that not a single strand was out of place!\u201cMy Lady, I've searched for a long time but did not find a single clue. It is likely that someone has intentionally erased all traces. We might have arrived a little too late.\u201dThe elder bowed slightly, his voice strong and rich. His bearing and mannerisms were refined and courteous, so perfect that there was nothing to nitpick.\u201cMmm.\u201d A uniquely magnetic and husky feminine voice sounded from the black carriage, \u201cIt is within expectation. I'm honestly surprised they waited so long to act.\u201dThe elder was silent.After a long time, the husky voice sounded from the carriage again, \u201cThe Heavenly Seer said that an amazing treasure will appear in the Three Thousand Great Mountains. Have you heard of this?\u201dThe elder bowed, \u201cI have. I've also heard that the Little Sword Lord Xie Yutang has already proved that it does not exist.\u201d\u201cOh? The little fellow from the Forbidden City's Black Cloth Alley Xie Clan?\u201d\u201cCorrect.\u201d\u201cHe's a lucky boy.\u201d The husky voice suddenly paused. Soon after, the carriage window opened as a beautiful fair hand reached out.The hand was slender and flawless. On her perfect dainty little finger was a strange black gemstone ring which looked like an open eye, a sight that would make anyone shiver inside.The beautiful finger pointed forward, \u201cWhat lies ahead of us?\u201d<sub>The latest_epi_sodes are on_the elworld.com website.</sub>The elder answered, \u201cMy Lady, to our front, lies Donglin City, which is one of our planned stopovers. At our current speed, we should arrive in six hours.\u201d\u201cDonglin City\u2026how interesting\u2026\u201dThe husky voice seemed to quiver as if sensing something but was near impossible to read.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The stone measured a cultivator's aeth power, while the puppets were used to measure a cultivator's martial power.It was quite simple: a cultivator with a certain level of aeth power might not be able to exhibit a matching level of battle power. The reason behind this was usually related to a cultivator's martial arts, martial understanding, and mastery.After all, cultivation was merely a power source in battle and martial arts were needed to properly bring out a fighter's power.Lin Xun walked to a True Martial sixth layer copper skin puppet and lightly tapped its chest.The puppet buzzed and its eyes flashed red as if awakening from slumber and every inch of its body glowed.Lin Xin took a deep breath as all of his muscles contracted like highly compacted steel threads. Power gathered in his body, surging through his spine as it roared throughout his body like a dragon.At this moment, Lin Xun's breath felt like a brewing thunderstorm, ready to unleash its unstoppable wrath!Rumble!His right arm suddenly shot forward like lightning and grabbed the puppet's wrist. The long accumulated power poured out like a tsunami, creating a terrifying rippling force!It was one of the Joint Disruption Art's moves that could instantly dislocate an opponent's joint and scatter their power, rendering them incapable of combat. If sufficient force was released, it could even shatter the target's inner organs and instantly kill them!Boom!The full-powered blow of the True Martial sixth layer stage struck the copper skin puppet, causing it to explode as if it was as weak as paper. Broken parts fell to the ground, leaving a single arm in Lin Xun's hand.Lin Xun was stunned by this scene. Isn't it a little too weak?Lin Xun had originally estimated that his physical power alone was enough to go toe to toe with a True Martial sixth layer cultivator.After all, he had been entering the Omega Secret-Realm to attempt the trial every three days. Although every try ultimately ended in failure, it greatly strengthened his physique.Even Xia Zhi had remarked that Lin Xun's physique tempering progress was far swifter than his aeth power cultivation.However, Lin Xun had not expected a single blow would shatter a True Martial sixth layer stage copper skin puppet.<sub>Foll_ow current_novel on elworld.com</sub>Although it was merely a measure of martial power, the resulting power from his physique combined with the Joint Disruption Art had exceeded his expectations.After some thinking, Lin Xun walked to another copper skin puppet. It was a True Martial seventh layer puppet this time.He changed his approach and threw a simple punch, using the most basic move.Thud!The copper skin puppet was blown away, a clear fist imprint on its now caved-in chest.At the same time, a voice sounded from the puppet with a ding, \u201cCongratulations customer, your martial power can threaten a True Martial seventh layer expert!\u201dLin Xun stared at his fist in thought for a long time before turning around and walking out of the room.However, because he had destroyed a copper skin puppet, he had no choice but to compensate the hall a hundred silver coins.Although Lin Xun had become quite rich, a hundred silver coins was still a substantial expenditure, making him curse in silence. If he had known, he would have gone straight to the True Martial seventh layer puppet instead!Despite this, Lin Xun was quite pleased to find out that his physique power could threaten a True Martial seventh layer expert.Of course, this was merely a measurement of force and real combat was a completely different ball game. A cultivator's battle experience, equipment, combat arts were important factors which would affect the fight.\u201cMy aeth power is around 4900 catties, which is comparable to a peak True Martial eighth layer cultivator. While my physique power can threaten a True Martial seventh layer cultivator. As long as I continue to train, there might be surprising benefits when I advance to the Spirit Dipper stage.\u201dLin Xun walked out of Donglin Martial Training Hall, evaluating his overall power as he rushed home.The district exam was tomorrow and he was not in the mood for any leisurely strolls.When Lin Xun arrived at the 49th residence, he heard people cursing inside.\u201cHow horrible! I'm the Donglin City Xue Clan Martial Dojo's young master. How dare you bully me! You're asking for death!\u201d\u201cQuickly release us!\u201d\u201cJust wait, you're already in big trouble. No one in Donglin City can save you!\u201dLin Xun raised his brows and pushed the door open. He immediately saw a dozen youths dressed in luxurious clothes tied up on the ground. Their faces had been beaten black and blue and their hair was messily scattered, displaying miserable appearances.<sub>Updated_at elworld.com</sub>Xia Zhi was seated at the center of the courtyard. She was silently reading a book as if she was unable to hear the threats.Fatty Diao and Beanpole Ma were also standing by the side. However, they had agonized expressions as if they were mulling over a difficult problem.\u201cWhat's going on?\u201d Lin Xun frowned.\u201cYou two tell him. I'm tired and am going to sleep.\u201d After instructing the fatty and beanpole duo, Xia Zhi closed the book and walked into the house.Lin Xun glanced at Fatty Diao. He immediately approached and worriedly explained everything.It turned out that not long after Lin Xun left in the morning, these dozen youths came knocking, claiming they were from Donglin Academy. They had heard from somewhere that Lin Xun was an amazing fighter and wouldn't stop yammering about wanting to spar with him to see who was better.Xia Zhi originally wanted to ignore them but who could have expected that they would not relent and instead turn to verbal humiliation and name-calling. In the end, they managed to anger Xia Zhi, who swiftly began to teach them their place.If Fatty Diao and Beanpole Ma had not rushed over in time, Xia Zhi would have probably killed the Donglin Academy students.Lin Xun's eyes narrowed upon hearing about what had transpired. The district exam was tomorrow and a dozen Donglin Academy students had come all the way to his house to challenge him. This affair seemed fishy.Could it be some kind of scheme?Lin Xun recalled Lian Fei, who was hiding in Donglin Academy. Lin Xun was certain that even if it wasn't Lian Fei's idea, it definitely had something to do with him!\u201cYou're Lin Xun? Quickly release us! The consequences are not something a brat from the countryside like you can bear!\u201d\u201cRelease me from these bindings!\u201dAt Lin Xun's return, not only did the dozen Donglin Academy students not cease their cursing, they instead grew increasingly bold and arrogant. Curses endlessly flew from their mouths as if they were unafraid that Lin Xun would dare to touch them.Iciness flashed in Lin Xun's eyes. A dazzling smile rose from the corners of his lips as he walked over.\u201cPlease calm your anger, Boss!\u201d Fatty Diao hastily followed and cautioned in an anxious voice, \u201cWe've already done a background check. These people might seem to be Donglin Academy students, but they also have other identities. Nearly all of them are pampered young masters of various factions and clans in Donglin City. If such people are killed, endless trouble will follow.\u201d\u201cMm.\u201d Lin Xun was silent.Upon seeing this, youngsters grew even more fearless and pleased with themselves.\u201cOh? Are you scared now? I knew you wouldn't dare to do anything to us!\u201d<sub>New novel_chap_ters are published here: elworld.com</sub>\u201cHumph! You ignorant trash, what are you still standing around for. Hurry up and untie this Young Master!\u201dThe youngest among the group was only twelve, while the eldest was not even fifteen. Each one was extremely arrogant and had clearly never experienced any difficulties. It was clear that all of them had been spoiled.Smiling, Lin Xun walked forward and squatted in front of one of them, \u201cWho sent you?\u201d\u201cWhat a joke! Who dares in Donglin City dares to command this Young Master? You'd better stop with the nonsense. If you don't release us, there will be endless problems for you in the future!\u201dThe youngster raised his head like a proud little rooster. However, his swollen pig-like face and black eyes made him look rather comical.Piak!Lin Xun slapped the boy, eliciting a scream before his head fell to the side, now unconscious.This scene made the group turn rigid. They never imagined that Lin Xun would dare to use violence at this juncture.Was he not afraid of their vengeance?\u201cBoss, this\u2026this\u2026\u201d Fatty Diao and Beanpole Ma were taken aback.\u201cThis guy's foul mouth is filled with bullshit. He's really lacking in manners.\u201d Lin Xun shook his head as if it was a small matter.Still smiling, he turned towards another youngster, \u201cYou there, tell me who sent you guys.\u201dThe youngster was clearly scared by Lin Xun's methods and fearfully answered, \u201cWe\u2026we really came by our own will. I'm definitely not lying!\u201dLin Xun frowned and looked towards the other youngsters, only to find that they all had the same terrified faces. He knew that pampered young masters like them, who had never experienced any difficulties, were not likely to lie.From their expressions, he could see that they could not even hide their emotions. It would be high praise to even say that they wore their hearts on their sleeves.Lin Xun stood up and thought for a while. He then turned around, called over Fatty Diao and Beanpole Ma and asked in a low voice, \u201cCall some of your subordinates over later and bring these people to Donglin Academy's doorstep.\u201dFatty Diao gasped, \u201cThis is a big no-no! If the matter grows too big, the consequences will be unthinkable!\u201dLin Xun's friendly face was full of smiles as he unhurriedly said, \u201cWe have to make it as big as we can. If we let them go just like this, uncountable troubles will follow.\u201dHe thoughtfully stroked his chin and said, \u201cAt that time, I need you guys to help act out a little play. If we don't manage to kick up a big enough fuss until the whole city knows, there will no longer be any peace in the future.\u201d<sub>Foll_ow current_novel on elworld.com</sub>From Lin Xun's serious appearance, Fatty Xiao and Beanpole Ma finally realized that their Chopstick Gang Boss wasn't joking!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Was this your doing?\u201dYao Susu seemed unconcerned as she casually nodded, \u201cAlthough I didn't directly tell them to do so, I did have a hand in this matter. I merely told Yang Qun that Lin Xun is a gifted youngster who constantly looks down on our Donglin Academy students and belittles us. It didn't feel nice hearing such things.\u201dLian Fei's expression darkened, \u201cAnd then Yang Qun couldn't take it and went to find Lin Xun to spar with him?\u201dYao Susu chuckled, \u201cYeah, Yang Qun is easily provoked. I didn't even need to say much and he quickly gathered up a group and left in a huff to find Lin Xun.\u201d\u201cFoolish!\u201dLian Fei had a headache. He was genuinely angry but could not direct it at Yao Susu. Flustered, his expression turned ugly, \u201cSomeone who killed Old Tiger Lu is definitely no ordinary person! Yang Qun and the others will not be his match! Won't they be seeking their own humiliation?\u201dYao Susu said, \u201cI don't expect them to teach Lin Xun a lesson. It's the opposite, the more they suffer the better.\u201dLian Fei was taken aback, suddenly realizing that this matter was not as simple as he had imagined.Sure enough, Yao Susu swiftly explained, \u201cAlthough Yang Qun and the others are boastful and domineering, they are also from various powerful factions in Donglin City. Offending them is equivalent to offending these factions. Isn't this great? It's better than you trying to face Lin Xun alone, right?\u201dLian Fei's rage began to dissipate as he connected the dots, \u201cYou're trying to sabotage Lin Xun?\u201dThe corners of Yao Susu's lips curled downwards, \u201cIf not for you, I would never do such a lowly thing.\u201dLian Fei hurriedly consoled her, touched by her intentions, \u201cSusu, I was only worried about you. Lin Xun is so ruthless, how can I bear to see you earn his ire?\u201dYao Susu smiled, \u201cYou need not worry about me, I'm not afraid of Lin Xun. If not for you, I wouldn't even know such a person exists.\u201dSomething suddenly occurred to Lian Fei, \u201cHow did you find out about Lin Xun and me?\u201dA pleased smile arose on Susu's face, \u201cNo one can hide anything from me if I wish to know about it. Alright, that's enough. Don't think too much about this and just wait for the entertainment to start. The district exam is tomorrow. If Yang Qun and the others are heavily injured and unable to participate, it will most definitely incur the wrath of several factions. When that happens, Lin Xun will only be able to keep hopping around for a few days more.\u201d<sub>Try the elworld.com platform_for the most advanced_reading experience.</sub>Lian Fei was a little shocked. Yao Susu appeared to be an innocent young lady, so who could have imagined she would possess such cunning?However, Lian Fei also could not help but feel a surge of excitement at the thought of Lin Xun falling into a dangerous predicament. After all, Lian Fei had not forgotten the sullenness and defeat he had felt a few days ago.An uproar suddenly sounded from far away, causing Lian Fei and Yao Susu to instinctively look over.A group of students were running towards the academy entrance and people were shouting along the way.\u201cCome quickly, our fellow students have been beaten up by someone, tied up and delivered to the academy entrance!\u201d\u201cHow horrible! Who dares to bully our Donglin Academy? I'm interested to find out which arrogant bastard is the culprit!\u201dThe shouts stunned Lian Fei and Yao Susu. How had things reached this stage? To think that Lin Xun would be that ballsy; not only did he beat up Yang Qun and the others, but he even brought the conflict to the school.The couple exchanged a glance before heading towards the academy entrance as well to find out more.Although it was the afternoon, the entrance to Donglin Academy was exceptionally lively. Heads bobbed up and down as numerous busybodies crowded around, creating such a tight blockade that even water wouldn't be able to seep through.A dozen figures were lying on the empty ground in front of the academy, their arms tied up together behind them and linked to their necks like criminals. Their faces were swollen and bruised, their hair messily scattered, and dirty rags had even been stuffed into their mouths, creating a very pathetic sight.They were naturally the pampered young masters who had tried to cause trouble at the slum's 49th residence today.There were also a dozen shabbily dressed white-haired elders kneeling beside them, who looked as if they had half a foot in the grave. The grandpas and grannies were currently wailing loudly.Fatty Diao and Beanpole Ma could also be found amongst the group.Fatty Diao took a deep breath and angrily hollered, \u201cMy fellow citizens, we've been left with no choice but to come here and demand justice! Some things need to be said even if we end up being beaten to death by Donglin Academy!\u201cThe Donglin Academy degenerates on the ground went to the slums today to wreak havoc, saying they wanted to polish their martial arts and cultivation in preparation for tomorrow's district exam. They beat anyone they came across, injuring many of our family and friends. They were cruel, vicious and had zero regard for the people. I'd like to ask right here and now: are there no longer any laws in this world?\u201dFatty Diao appeared as if he was filled with indignation and passion. Everyone in the vicinity could clearly hear his words, eliciting several gasps from the crowd.<sub>New_chap_ters are pub_lished on elworld.com</sub>\u201cTheir bullying has gone too far this time!\u201dTears began to gather in Fatty Xiao's eyes as he pointed towards one of the old grannies who was toothless, \u201cEveryone look, that's my neighbor's, Gou Sheng, mum. Although she's already so old, she was nearly sullied by someone!\u201dThe entire place exploded at these words. Sullied? Which blind idiot would try to touch an old granny?However, Fatty Diao was clearly overwhelmed by grief. He gritted his teeth, walked to one of the tied-up youngsters on the ground and emotionally said, \u201cEveryone might not believe me, but I swear to the heavens that this imp\u2026he might be young, but his tastes are\u2026repulsive! If I didn't arrive at Gou Sheng's house in time, his mother would have been raped by this pervert!\u201dThe youngster's eyes bulged from their sockets as he struggled to try and say something. However, he had been gagged and could only make whimpering noises.The old granny very cooperatively began to bang her head against the ground until it began to bleed. It was a heart-stirring sight that made the crowd begin to suspect that it was real.Without giving anyone time to think, Fatty Xiao thumped his chest and wailed at the sky, \u201cMy fellow citizens, we're already the lowest class citizens who live in the slums. If these degenerates didn't leave us with no other option, how could we possibly have the courage to come to Donglin Academy's doorstep to shout our grievances?\u201dThe crowd secretly nodded in agreement. That was right, these people were clearly from the lowest level of society. Normally speaking, such people would never dare to cause a fuss at Donglin Academy even if you gave them the courage to.There is definitely a reason for this!By this time, several students had already gathered at the entrance. Anger rapidly filled their faces when they saw their fellow students bound up and lying on the ground.However, they were just too young and had never experienced something like this. After hearing Fatty Diao's bitter and despairing cries, the students could not help but suspect his story was true.Some students tried to go forward to save Yang Qun and the others but were doggedly obstructed by the granny and grandpa group, making it seem as if the only way to get past was over their dead bodies.The grannies and grandpas had no cultivation and were just ordinary people. Moreover, they already had half a foot in the grave. Things would become very troublesome if they were injured while the crowd was watching.It would also hurt Donglin Academy's reputation and people would say the students only knew how to bully the elderly. That would be far too shameful.Fatty Diao began to shout again, \u201cI demand justice even if I lose my life today!\u201d\u201cRight! We want justice!\u201dBeanpole Ma also began to yell, \u201cI heard these degenerates mention that they were sent by a student called Lian Fei to cause trouble in the slums. He said those who live in the slums are less than human and their pathetic lives are worth less than papers so no one cares if they're killed. Isn't this a complete disregard for human life?\u201d<sub>Visit elworld.com for a better_reading experience</sub>The fact that Beanpole Ma could even name the mastermind convinced the crowd even more.Lian Fei and Yao Susu arrived just in time to hear this, which immediately stunned Lian Fei. Since when have I ever said such a stupid thing?Lian Fei's expression darkened. He knew at a glance that this was Lin Xun's revenge!\u201cDespicable!\u201d Lian Fei felt as if he was about to explode from anger. He hadn't even done anything but he was receiving all the blame. Worst of all, he didn't know how to explain himself on the spot. This was probably what public opinion obscuring the truth was like.Yao Susu's expression was also rather ugly. She never imagined that Lin Xun would be so devious and respond so quickly. Not only had he given Yang Qun and the others a beating, but Lin Xun had also weaved a convincing lie and brought the mess all the way to Donglin Academy.Even if they somehow proved in the future that it was just a bunch of lies, who would believe them then?In fact, Yao Susu could already foresee many people adding on to the story once it spread!Rumors were often grown from groundless accusations. As more and more people added their own little tidbits into the story, it would swiftly be spun into an unimaginable tale. The more you tried to explain, the more the people would suspect it was real.Fatty Diao and Beanpole Ma were still angrily crying out their grievances. At this point, they knew that the bigger the commotion, the safer they would be. Hence, they used every bit of talent they had to continue pouring shit onto Lian Fei.More and more people gathered as time passed.Lin Xun watched everything transpire a thousand feet from the academy. In the end, he silently chuckled and turned to leave.The matter was already blown up enough. Regardless of the outcome, the controversy caused by this affair was sufficient to give the factions behind the pampered young masters a headache for a long time.If they still dared to go after him regardless of the cost, it would instead prove that everything was true. This result was certainly not what the influential figures behind the spoiled young masters would want.Fatty Diao's and Beanpole Ma's acting skills are pretty good. It's a stroke of genius that they also came up with the idea of finding some elderly to play along as well. The Donglin Academy cultivators have no choice but to hold back and act with caution. However, the acting duo will definitely be hated in the future and will no longer be able to stay in Donglin City. It looks like I need to plan an escape route for them\u2026Lin Xun pondered as he walked, feeling very composed.Today's skit had indeed been his work. Although it had temporarily staved away the danger, the truth that he was the mastermind would be found out sooner or later.However, Lin Xun could care less about such things. When the district exam was over, he would naturally leave Donglin City and head to Qingfeng County where he would begin preparations for the prefectural exam.<sub>For more_novel, visit elworld.com</sub>Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He immediately declared to the crowd that he would seek justice for Fatty Diao and the others.Fatty Diao knew that they had to back down now because it would only be detrimental if they continued. Hence, he quickly left with the granny and grandpa group.Yang Qun and the other pampered young masters were quickly untied and brought into Donglin Academy.Although the affair was finally over, news of it swiftly spread across the entire city, drawing several uproars and plenty of laughs.Lian Fei, Yang Qun and the others had become a topic of laughter in the city.Of course, no one cared about the validity of the rumors. Even if it wasn't true, rumors were rumors and why would the unconcerned majority care enough to find out the truth?Golden Jade Hall.When Gu Yanpeng heard the rumor, it only took a brief moment for him to figure everything out.

Overall, the disadvantages outweigh the benefits.\u201dGu Yanping praised his son, \u201cLiang'er, it's good that you managed to take these things into consideration. However, if you were Lin Xun, what would you do to neutralize the danger?\u201dGu Liang instantly understood that this was a test for him. His thoughts swiftly swirled as he answered, \u201cIf it were me, I would definitely not fight those young masters. I can always avoid them first and find a chance to even things in the future.\u201dGu Yanping nodded, \u201cAlthough your method is reserved, it is the most appropriate approach. However, you've overlooked one problem. These young masters are arrogant and unreasonable bullies. If they are determined to find you, it will be impossible to avoid them.\u201dHe paused for a moment before continuing, \u201cThat's why although Lin Xun's method was a little extreme, it was the wisest option to resolve the matter. Only by creating a big enough commotion until the entire city knew about it would his enemies be forced to hold back for the time being. No matter how much they hate him, immediately going after him would only prove everything was true and hurt their reputation.\u201d\u201cEven if these Donglin City factions do bad things in secret, they are still very concerned about their image.\u201dGu Liang frowned, \u201cBut what about the future? Once the storm passes, the people will no longer care. What will stop the factions from going after Lin Xun then?\u201dGu Liang suddenly froze as if he had realized something. He slapped his hands together and excitedly blurted out, \u201cI understand! Lin Xun does not plan to stay in Donglin City! After passing the district exam, he will definitely be going on to participate in the prefecture exam. Since that's the case, no matter how big of a commotion he creates today, he can just leave and no one will be able to do anything.\u201d<sub>Visit elworld.com for a better_reading experience</sub>Gu Yanping smiled and praised, \u201cNot bad. That's Lin Xun's decision. The fact that you managed to figure it out shows that you've matured.\u201dGu Liang felt ashamed as he shook his head, \u201cI'm nothing compared to him.\u201dGu Yanping sighed, \u201cLin Xun already has superhuman intelligence despite his young age. It's pointless to compare yourself with someone like him.\u201dGu Liang suddenly said, \u201cFather, if Lin Xun leaves, it will become very difficult for our Golden Jade Hall to obtain more aeth tools from that mysterious rune master.\u201dGu Yanping seemed to have considered this problem long ago. \u201cLiang'er, a true merchant group will never place all of their hopes on others. If you wish to become a well-known merchant cultivator, you must possess sufficient capital and power to establish a place for yourself in this world!\u201dGu Liang's heart shook. He took a deep breath and said, \u201cI understand.\u201dGu Yanping chuckled, \u201cYou're of similar age to Lin Xun and currently have a good relationship. If he encounters any difficulties in the future, you should try to help him out. Friends are also something you need to invest in. Don't always wait to receive but learn to take the initiative and be the one to give first.\u201dGu Liang nodded.He did admire Lin Xun and desired to be good friends with such a person.However, Gu Liang also had his own views. He did not wish to maintain a relationship based on mutual benefit with Lin Xun. Gu Liang wanted to use his capability and power to gain Lin Xun's acknowledgement!After all, Gu Lian was fifteen this year. He was also a proud young man who was filled with aspirations!Stone Cauldron Alms.Mu Wansu's expression turned stranger and stranger as she listened to Wang Lin's report. In the end, she could not help but break out into laughter, making her beautiful face even more enchanting.She laughed until tears were nearly streaming down her face. After a long time, she finally bit her lip and said, \u201cThat brat Lin Xun is so bad. To think\u2026to think he would accuse a youngster of trying to rape an old granny. Only he could think of such a thing!\u201dAfter a pause, she suddenly frowned, \u201cHe's already decided to leave Donglin City?\u201dWang Lin regretfully said, \u201cYes. Once he leaves, I'm afraid it will be impossible for us to build relations with the mysterious rune master in the future.\u201dMu Wansu blankly stared into space. Rationally speaking, she should be celebrating if Lin Xun left. After all, she was always wishing for the little punk to disappear.However, when it did happen, Mu Wansu suddenly felt an unexplainable sliver of melancholy. It wasn't a good feeling.<sub>Foll_ow current_novel on elworld.com</sub>A little bastard who had repeatedly made her suffer was going to leave all of a sudden. It somehow made her feel a little sad, but what was she sad about?Mu Wansu frowned. After a long time, she gently bit her lip and softly mumbled, \u201cHumph! Even if he leaves, there's still unfinished business between us! I will make sure to one day subdue that little punk!\u201dShe suddenly saw Wang Lin's strange expression and immediately returned to her senses. She looked slightly dejected, seemingly unconcerned about the mysterious rune master as she waved her hand, \u201cYou are dismissed.\u201dConfused, Wang Lin cupped his hands together and took his leave.The Wu Clan.Clan Leader Wu Qun inwardly gasped as he read the report in his hand. His expression slightly fluctuated, \u201cWhat a vicious little thing. To think he has learnt how to incite the majority and counterattack with slander!\u201dWu Qun was thankful that the Wu Clan had held back from targeting Lin Xun over the past few days. Otherwise, being implicated in this matter would be a huge loss of face.Someone said, \u201cClan Leader, that little trash's methods were too extreme this time and he has completely offended many factions. This is good news for us.\u201d\u201cWrong!\u201d Wu Qun's eyes flickered in thought as he coldly said, \u201cThe district exam is tomorrow. Do you think that little shitbag will wait for his death in Donglin City after passing? Since he dares to do such a thing, he clearly plans on leaving!\u201d\u201cSo that's why. We cannot let that shitbag leave like this! Otherwise, how will we regain our pride?\u201d\u201cAgreed, we're only holding back for now and will slowly deal with him in the future. But what's the point if he leaves?\u201dThe crowd grew agitated.Wu Qun took a deep breath and rose to his feet, \u201cCalm yourselves. I will go visit the Donglin Academy Principal later. Didn't that little shit want to participate in the district exam? I'll make sure he fails to achieve his goals. It won't be so easy for him to have his way!\u201dDonglin Academy.Lian Fei and Yao Susu stood in a long corridor which led to the principal's office.Lian Fei had an ugly expression as he recalled everything that happened in front of the academy. He felt as if his heart was about to burst from rage and sullenness.So ruthless!<sub>You can_find the rest of this_content on the elworld.com platform.</sub>Lin Xun's slander counterattack had made Lian Fei lose face and hurt his reputation. Moreover, no one would believe him even if he tried to explain.This was the terror of rumors.For instance, the youngster who had been accused of trying to rape an old granny had been given the nickname 'perverted granny lover'. It was malicious to the max and shook the entire academy.The only consolation was that there was no proof until now that Lian Fei was the mastermind.Unfortunately, an academy instructor had already found out that Yang Qun and the others had been manipulated by Yao Susu, leading to everything that had happened today!Lian Fei could not help but look at Yao Susu, only to find that she was calm as could be. It was as if she was not worried about any punishment.In fact, Yao Susu even tried to console Lian Fei, \u201cDon't be too stuck up on this. Lin Xun is too vicious and crafty. If there's a chance, I will not let him off!\u201dLian Fei chuckled bitterly. He had nothing to say in response.The door at the end of the corridor was pushed open and a stern middle-aged man in a long purple robe walked out.Donglin Academy Principal Yu Canglin!Lian Fei's body turned rigid as his expression tensed. Yu Canglin was a famous Spirit Sea stage expert, and one of the few Spirit Sea stage experts in Donglin City!Lian Fei and Yao Susu had been summoned here to wait, and he was surprised that the matter had alarmed the principal. Was the principal going to personally mete out his punishment?If that was so, the consequences would be far too dire!Hence why Lian Fei could not help but worry when he saw Yu Canglin appear.To Lian Fei's surprise, the usually old-fashioned, strict and never-smiling Principal Yu Canglin smiled and beckoned towards them, \u201cSusu, come over. Your father is waiting for you.\u201dLian Fei's eyes nearly popped from their sockets as his mind went blank.Yao Susu seemed to have anticipated this long ago. She smiled and nodded before dragging Lian Fei towards the end of the hall.From start to end, Yu Canglin smilingly watched them approach and did not try to stop them. This made Lian Fei feel increasingly shocked as a certain question finally dawned upon him.Principal Yu Canglin's behavior seems to be related to Yao Susu's father\u2026<sub>Visit elworld.com for a better_user experience</sub>But who is Yao Susu's father?Lian Fei frantically tried to figure it out.

Although he had merely been casually sitting there, facing him had made Lian Fei feel like an ant looking up at a majestic mountain.This was the invisible pressure produced when a person's cultivation reached a certain level and was not something Lian Fei could neutralize.Yao Susu asked in concern, \u201cAre you alright?\u201dLian Fei shook his head and tried to smile, his face still a little pale, \u201cI never imagined that your father would be Lord Yao Tuohai. It's honestly a surprise.\u201dYao Susu offhandedly replied, \u201cI never hid it from you. You just never asked.\u201dLian Fei chuckled bitterly. When he recalled his conversion with Yao Tuohai, Lian Fei's heart began to beat faster in excitement. If he married Yao Susu in the future, wouldn't that mean he could borrow Yao Tuohai's influence and power to fly all the way to the sky?Yao Susu suddenly asked, \u201cDid you mean what you said earlier?\u201dLian Fei was taken aback but immediately returned to his wits and responded with a determined expression, \u201cSusu, how will I be worthy of you if I can't personally avenge my father's death?\u201dIn the earlier conversation, Yao Tuohai had said that he already understood the grudge between Lian Fei and Lin Xun and clearly expressed that he would not help Lian Fei.Lian Fei was even more direct. He immediately swore that he would personally take revenge, earning a little admiration from Yao Tuohai.Yao Susu acknowledged his reply and said, \u201cAlthough my father said he will not help you directly, you should know that the Yao Clan can provide you with various types of support. Don't waste this opportunity. You must pull yourself together and try to earn my father's acknowledgement.\u201dLian Fei took a deep breath and solemnly said, \u201cDon't worry Susu, I will not only earn Uncle Yao's acknowledgement but also make you my wife!\u201dYao Susu smiled sweetly and did not say anything else.Lian Fei was overjoyed and proud. With Yao Tuohai backing him, what was there to worry about?As for Lin Xun, he was merely an ant in Lian Fei's path which would be easily crushed once he rose to power!\u201cLook, that seems to be the Wu Clan Leader.\u201dYao Susu suddenly stopped and turned her head.Lian Fei followed her gaze and saw Principal Yu Canglin walking toward them with a middle-aged man wearing a black hat. The middle-aged man was the current Wu Clan Leader, Wu Qun.<sub>New novel_chap_ters are published here: elworld.com</sub>Lian Fei's expression immediately turned frosty. He didn't have a good impression of the Wu Clan.\u201cSusu, you guys are done?\u201d Yu Canglin also caught sight of them and approached with a smile.Yao Susu nodded and bowed, \u201cWe're done.\u201d\u201cLian Fei, you're here as well.\u201d Wu Qun called out to Lian Fei, displaying a friendly expression.Wu Qun had just found out about Lian Fei's and Yao Susu' relationship from Yu Canglin, who had also revealed that Yao Susu's father was the famous Yao Tuohai.Wu Qun was rather surprised by this revelation. Lian Fei must be the luckiest son of a bitch in this world. Life really is fickle.Lian Fei's expression was slightly cold as he acknowledged him before leaving with Yao Susu.Wu Qun's expression instantly turned somewhat ugly as he inwardly ground his teeth. What an arrogant brat, if not for my support, you won't even be here today!Meanwhile, Lian Fei was also sneering inside. You old dog Wu Qun, you can keep dreaming if you're thinking of using me as a spearhead again!Yu Canglin spoke up at this moment, \u201cI have mostly understood your matter. With Lord Yao Tuohai personally overseeing this, I believe you will receive a satisfactory answer.\u201d\u201cI'll have to trouble Brother Yu.\u201d Wu Qun smiled and cupped his hands together as he inwardly breathed a sigh of relief.Yu Canglin waved his hand and disdainfully said, \u201cNo need to be courteous. Since Lin Xun tried to bully Donglin Academy, as the principal, I naturally will not allow such a vile person to continue running amok.\u201dThe next morning.Lin Xun got up at dawn. After washing up, he had breakfast with Xia Zhi.Today marked the start of the district exam. However, Lin Xun seemed the same as usual, displaying no hint of excitement or anticipation.Xia Zhi asked, \u201cAre we leaving after the district exam is over?\u201dLin Xun nodded. After some thought, he added, \u201cI've offended many people in the city and it's become a problematic place. It would be best to leave as soon as possible.\u201dXia Zhi regretfully said, \u201cOnly half a month more and I'll have devoured all the gangs in the slums.\u201dLin Xun was speechless.He finished his breakfast and was just about to leave when Xia Zhi suddenly said, \u201cI want to go with you.\u201d<sub>Foll_ow new_episo_des on the elworld.com platform.</sub>Lin Xun was stunned, \u201cYou're worried?\u201dXia Zhi nodded. She opened her pitch-black, crescent-shaped eyes and earnestly said, \u201cI feel that your enemies will not let you pass the district exam so easily.\u201dShe knew what had happened yesterday in front of Donglin Academy and understood how big of a commotion Lin Xun had caused.Lin Xun chuckled. \u201cThe district exam is a very important event in the empire. Who would dare to cause trouble during the exam? Not to mention a bigwig like Yao Tuohai will be overseeing the exam. There shouldn't be anyone who would dare to obstruct me from participating.\u201dXia Zhi said, \u201cI want to go and watch. I've not left the slums since we arrived in Donglin City.\u201dLin Xun's heart softened and agreed without hesitation.Indeed, Xia Zhi very seldom showed herself. Even when wiping out the gangs in the slums, she only did so at night.Since she requested to accompany him to Donglin Academy, how could Lin Xun possibly turn her down?As such, Lin Xun left holding Xia Zhi's small hand. They walked out of the slums and headed to Donglin Academy.The streets were busy despite the early hour and numerous people could be seen converging in a certain direction.The district exam was today and it was one of the biggest events in Donglin City. It drew the entire city's attention and was naturally exceptionally electrifying.When Lin Xun arrived at Donglin Academy, he found the place already flooded with people. A black mass of heads bobbed up and down like the sea, creating a majestic scene.The majority was here for the entertainment, but there were also families here to support the participants.Lin Xun retrieved his participation token and smoothly brought Xia Zhi into Donglin Academy. They did not encounter any obstructions.They followed a wide paved path and their view soon opened up to reveal a giant plaza which could hold ten thousand people.The plaza was already filled with figures, nearly all of which were teenagers. There were several thousand participants, their faces filled with anticipation.There was a tall stage at the front of the plaza which had an excellent view of the entire place. When the district exam officially began, the examiners would be stationed on the stage, accompanied by various VIPs.Two stone tablets stood a hundred feet away. Each tablet was a hundred-feet-tall and gave off different aeth power undulations.These two tablets were the Bone Measurement Tablet and the Cultivation Measurement Tablet which measured a person's age and cultivation respectively.When the exam began, the participants would go measure their age and cultivation in front of the two tablets. No one could cheat under the crowd's watching eyes, making it fair for everyone.Xia Zhi chose a spot on the outer perimeter and softly said, \u201cI'll wait here for you.\u201d<sub>Visit elworld.com for a better_reading experience</sub>Lin Xun nodded. He was not worried about Xia Zhi. The little girl possessed exceptional intelligence and knew not to cause trouble in such a place.Xia Zhi silently stood in a remote corner as a gentle breeze blew past, ruffling her clothes. No one noticed the peerless and breathtakingly beautiful face concealed under the little girl's hat.Although the world was huge, her gaze only had room for Lin Xun alone.As she watched Lin Xun walk into the giant plaza, Xia Zhi's brows furrowed as a sliver of unexplainable irritation surged in her heart.She had been feeling this irritation since last night and strongly believed in her intuition. Hence why she had specially followed Lin Xun today.She did not know what was going to happen but she would be watching. She feared nothing as long as she was with Lin Xun.There was still an hour until the district exam started, but the plaza was already filled with numerous cultivators, who were conversing with each other.Lin Xun stood by himself, gazing at the empty stage in the distance. He knew that the district exam was the last chance for his enemies. All that was left was to see whether or not they dared to cause trouble under the watching crowd.The district exam was an important event for the empire and was simultaneously held in all the cities today. No one in their right mind would dare to cause mischief because the consequences would be dire if the empire's higher-ups found out.Lin Xun was not worried about his safety but whether or not certain people would allow him to pass smoothly.After all, the nine thousand participants would ultimately be culled to a thousand. All it took was the examiner to make up some excuse to eliminate him!Did they dare?Lin Xun was not certain.Lin Xun suddenly sensed something and turned his head to find Lian Fei coldly staring at him with unconcealable hatred.Beside him was a well-dressed Yao Susu.Lin Xun helplessly chuckled and approached them, \u201cWe meet again, friend. Didn't I say a few days ago that there's always a reason behind coincidence? I feel that we are quite strongly bound by the strings of fate.\u201dLian Fei was slightly stunned, seemingly not expecting Lin Xun to approach at this juncture. Lian Fei's expression swiftly darkened, \u201cIs that so? Well, I don't feel the same!\u201dYao Susu curiously looked Lin Xun up and down. Soon after, she softly chuckled and said, \u201cI can see a lingering darkness between your brows. I'm afraid that you will be quite unlucky today.\u201dShe then pulled Lian Fei's arm and led him away.Lin Xun's eyes narrowed, falling into thought as he watched them leave.Favorite<sub>Foll_ow new_episo_des on the elworld.com platform.</sub>Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

That must be the famous Yao Tuohai, who is highly regarded by the prime minister!\u201d\u201cThirty years ago, Lord Yao passed the district, prefecture and provincial exams in a single year. Such an unrivaled demeanor is something we should all strive towards.\u201d\u201cAgreed, I've heard Lord Yao has already reached the Heaven Ascension stage. That makes him a top-tier individual even in the empire!\u201d\u201cLook, even Donglin Academy Principal Yu Canglin, Wu Clan Leader Wu Qun, Stone Cauldron Alm's Black Rose Mu Wansu and other influential figures are merely supporting actors to Lord Yao. This is the embodiment of true power and influence!\u201dOn the plaza, the nine thousand participants excitedly gushed over Yao Tuohai.Lin Xun also looked up and saw a scholarly man seated at the center of the tall stage. He wore a long black robe with wide sleeves and had a well-groomed fu manchu style moustache and beard. He was the very picture of a dao practicing immortal.Although he was merely sitting there, he gave off an invisible pressure and made others feel he was connected to the heavens. His eyes seemed tranquil and kindly, but when his gaze swept across the crowd, it made everyone feel a heart-palpitating oppression.This was Yao Tuohai!An influential figure who rose to fame thirty years ago during the national exam! The only person in the southwest province who could rival the Southwest City Governor Liu Wudiao!The Heaven Ascension stage huh. I wonder how much power such a cultivator wields\u2026 Lin Xun sighed deeply.The more he cultivated, the more he understood how difficult it was. It was akin to climbing a mountain with only your bare hands, with each successive mountain growing taller and more dangerous.An ordinary cultivator would be lucky to reach the Spirit Dipper stage, let alone the amazing Spirit Sea and Heaven Ascension stages.Meanwhile, Lin Xun also took notice of the Wu Clan's Wu Qun. The middle-aged man wearing a black hat seemed like an honest person at first glance and had no outstanding features. However, the more ordinary someone of his status looked, the more extraordinary they usually were.The fact that he was the Wu Clan Leader and a VIP at this event were clear indicators of his status. After all, ordinary people would never have a chance to ascend this high stage.Mu Wansu was also present but Lin Xun only glanced at her before withdrawing his gaze.Clang!<sub>The most up-to-date nov_els are published_here > elworld.com</sub>The clear ring of a bell echoed in the sky, like a signal which announced the start of the district exam.The atmosphere grew solemn as all the chattering died down.Donglin Academy Principal Yu Canglin rose to his feet. He explained the significance of the district exam in a loud and clear voice before giving a simple description of the rules. He then passed the time over to Yao Tuohai.As the chief examiner, Yao Tuohai got up with a chuckle. His gaze swept across the place as he said, \u201cEveryone present will eventually become pillars which support the empire so I hope to see you guys perform well today. Fight for the chance to serve the empire and create your own glorious success!\u201dHis voice contained a power that made others feel respectful as it clearly echoed in every corner of the plaza.Thunderous cheers and clapping immediately followed.The young participants felt their blood boil with excitement, but Lin Xun found this rather meaningless. Such clich\u00e9 words could only trick immature youths.The district exam was certainly an important event to the empire, but in the end, it was merely the most basic test among the empire's exams. Even if someone passed, it would only mean that they had some talent and could not possibly have anything to do with glory or honor.There were thirty-four provinces in the empire and countless cities in each province. Countless talented youths would pass the district exam each year, but only a small handful would be able to reach even greater heights. The majority, on the other hand, would soon fade back into mediocrity.Fortunately, the boring introductory phase quickly passed and Donglin Academy Principal Yu Canglin finally announced the start of the district exam!The exam was simple. Each participant would go forth to be probed by the Bone Measurement Aeth Tablet and Cultivation Measurement Tablet which would reveal their age and cultivation.Subsequently, the top one thousand performing participants would pass while the others would be eliminated.It was honestly very simple. There was no sparring, no life or death trials, and no other strange tests. It was merely a simple measurement of age and cultivation.\u201cFang Xuanzhong, age fourteen, True Martial second layer!\u201d\u201cLiu Gangshan, age fifteen, True Martial fourth layer!\u201d\u201cShi Hong, age eleven, True Martial first layer!\u201dThe results of every participant would be announced after the measurement. No one could cheat with everyone watching.<sub>Updated_at elworld.com</sub>The exam progressed rather quickly: more than three hundred participants had their measurements taken in fifteen minutes. The results were varied but none were attention-drawing.Lin Xun could not help but feel somewhat bored and decided to do some calculations: there were 9300 participants; at a rate of 300 per 15 minutes, it would take nearly 8 hours!At the thought of having to stupidly stand around for eight hours, Lin Xun felt a wave of helplessness. Why is there only one set of measuring tablets? It would be much more efficient if there were more.Regretfully, Donglin City was a remote city on the empire's southwest border and could not have more sets of measuring tablets.\u201cWu Feichong, age nine, True Martial fifth layer!\u201dWhile Lin Xun was thinking about random things, a certain result drew his attention.He was not the only one. The entire place seemed to stir at this announcement as an uproar quickly swept through the crowd. Nine-years-old! True Martial fifth layer cultivation! This was basically an extremely rare cultivation genius!With such results, there was no need to wait for the final outcome. This outstanding participant was obviously going to pass.\u201cWu Feichong? I heard he's a genius from the Wu Clan who was born with strong spirit power. He's the hope of the Wu Clan and they've declared their intention to nurture him into an excellent rune master at all cost!\u201d\u201cThe Wu Clan is so lucky. When Wu Feichong grows up, the Wu Clan's status in Donglin City will definitely increase!\u201dAmidst the discussions, Wu Qun's face was practically glowing with pride on the tall stage because Wu Feichong was his grandson.Wu Qun felt especially happy when he heard Yao Tuohai praise 'what a rare talent'.Oh, so he's from the Wu Clan. I wonder how much it will hurt them if I cripple him.Lin Xun rubbed his chin in a thoughtful manner. If Wu Qun were to know the teenager's thoughts, he would have immediately murdered the kid!The testing continued. It was not long before an eleven-year-old boy called Xiao Hen and a ten-year-old girl called Yu Miao caused uproars again with their True Martial seventh layer and sixth layer cultivation.Although they could not compare to Wu Feichong, their talent was already considered top-notch.One thing to note was that Xiao Hen was Boundless Treasure Pavilion Manager Xiao Yuanzhong's nephew, and had been enrolled into Donglin Academy at a young age.Yu Miao's identity was even more impressive. She was the Donglin Academy Principal Yu Canglin's granddaughter!<sub>Foll_ow current_novel on elworld.com</sub>Lin Xun was not surprised by any of this.Although Wu Feichong, Xiao Hen and Yu Miao might be quite talented, they were, more importantly, from powerful factions. They had teachers to guide them from a young age and had access to plentiful cultivation resources. Their cultivation education was far better than any of the underprivileged disciples.At the very least, although nearly four hours had passed and more than four thousand participants had been tested, not a single underprivileged cultivators' results had caused a stir in the crowd!It was not that Lin Xun looked down on the underprivileged. After all, he also came from a poor background.He knew that even if these underprivileged cultivators had amazing talent, due to the lack of cultivation resources, it would already be too late for them once they formally began their cultivation journey. This was undoubtedly burying their talent.This was the cruel reality. It might be unfair to say the poor could not produce talent, but compared to the privileged disciples, it was honestly much more difficult for the underprivileged to succeed.Moments later, Lin Xun put aside his thoughts. His turn had finally arrived!Swish!When Lin Xun arrived in front of the measuring tablets, Mu Wansu, who had been bored out of her mind, suddenly sat up. Her eyes were tinged with conflicting emotions as she looked over.Upon observing Mu Wansu's reaction, several influential figures on the stage secretly wondered if this boy had some relation to Stone Cauldron Alms.Wu Qun's eyes narrowed as an almost undetectable hint of iciness flashed in his eyes, Little shitbag, you won't be able to escape this time no matter how well you do!There was no reaction from Yu Canglin and Yao Tuohai.Meanwhile, Lian Fei and Yao Susu also looked over. Lian Fei's expression darkened while a sneer rose from the corners of Yao Susu's lips.In a lonely corner far from the plaza, Xia Zhi, who had paid no attention to the exam since the beginning, abruptly raised her gaze to look at Lin Xun.A familiar feeling of irritation soon rose in her heart, making her instinctively shift her gaze to the academy entrance. However, there was nothing noteworthy there besides a few guards.This frustrated Xia Zhi, causing her to frown.Lin Xun was oblivious to all of this. He stepped forward and did his measurements before returning to the plaza. He remained composed from start to end, not even glancing at the tall stage.\u201cLin Xun, age thirteen, True Martial sixth layer!\u201d<sub>Foll_ow current_novel on elworld.com</sub>The announcement of the results immediately made several people gasp.FavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It was merely better than average and thus did not cause a commotion.However, those that knew the name Lin Xun were unable to keep calm. It was not because Lin Xun's results were amazing but because they knew this name!To many people present, Lin Xun was an unfamiliar name. However, those that knew him felt hatred and resentment at the mention of his name.For example, some of the gasps in the crowd had come from Yang Qun and his group. They were known pampered young masters in Donglin City who had been beaten up and captured by Xia Zhi yesterday. They were subsequently brought to the entrance of Donglin Academy and made into the most miserable clowns. How could they not hate Lin Xun after all that?Donglin Academy Principal Yu Canglin suddenly raised his head and thoughtfully glanced at Lin Xun, who was returning to the plaza, as he recalled the talk he had with Wu Clan Leader Wu Qun yesterday.However, Principal Yu Canglin also recalled the commotion in front of the academy yesterday, causing him to frown and fall into thought.Yu Canglin did not notice Yao Tuohai also quickly scanning Lin Xun's figure. Yao Tuohai's expression remained unchanged but he could not help but feel a little skeptical. What was so special about this True Martial sixth layer stage youngster for his daughter and Lian Fei to have suffered at his hands?The corner of Wu Qun's eyes twitched without anyone noticing. He clearly remembered the report stating that Lin Xun had been at the True Martial fifth layer a month ago when he entered Donglin City. Who could have anticipated that the kid would advance to the next cultivation stage in a single month?With such potential, cunning and ability at this young age, he will certainly become a huge threat once he grows up!Wu Qun's expression remained composed but he had already begun thinking about killing Lin Xun.Mu Wansu had an even more complicated expression on her face. If her memory was right, Lin Xun was only at the True Martial third layer the first time they met in Feiyun Village. In fact, it was through First Young Master Shi Xuan's four seasons brew that Lin Xun managed to step into the True Martial fourth layer.It had only been a few months since then but Lin Xun's cultivation had already reached the True Martial sixth layer. Such rapid progress shook Mu Wansu's heart. For the first time, she realized that she had been too focused on making sure she would not lose out to the brat and had failed to notice his amazing cultivation talent.Lin Xun was unaware of everyone's thoughts. He returned to his original position, lowered his head, and silently waited for the exam to be over.He knew that announcing his name was akin to drawing blood in the woods, instantly drawing the attention of all the hidden hungry wolves.<sub>Visit elworld.com for a better_user experience</sub>However, he was not worried about them causing trouble during the exam.Sure enough, it was exactly as Lin Xun had predicted. His appearance did not cause any interruptions and the exam proceeded as usual. One by one, each hopeful participant nervously went forward to get measured, obtain their results and return.Some were happy with their results, some sighed in sadness, and some did not know what to make of it; each person displayed various emotions.When it was nearly noon, all 9300 participants were finally done with their measurements. However, no one left since the final results had yet to be announced. In contrast to the boring waiting from before, the atmosphere of the plaza turned tense.Everyone braced themselves and looked towards the tall stage; their faces were filled with desire, nervousness and hopefulness.The final results would soon be announced. Those who were eliminated and those who passed would be known shortly!On the tall stage, the chief examiner Yao Tuohai did not let everyone wait for long. He rose to his feet and his gaze swept across the crowd, \u201cThis district exam has been an eye-opener for me and I've discovered several good seedlings. Regretfully, only a thousand people will be able to pass. I hope that the young friends who fail will not be discouraged but work harder and participate again next year. As for those who pass, do not become proud and satisfied. The district exam is only the first step and there are still many challenges awaiting you\u2026\u201dAfter giving his speech, Yao Tuohai's expression turned solemn as he instructed, \u201cDao Friend Canglin, please announce the results.\u201dAs he spoke, he passed a scroll to Yu Canglin.Yu Canglin felt a surge of energy and accepted with a smile. However, his expression quickly changed to a serious one when he got up and unfurled the scroll.\u201cAge fifteen and cultivation lower than True Martial fifth layer, eliminated!\u201cAge fourteen, cultivation lower than True Martial fourth layer, eliminated!\u201cAge thirteen, cultivation lower than True Martial third layer, eliminated!\u201cAge twelve and below, cultivation lower than True Martial second layer, eliminated!\u201dHe did not speak too quickly or too slowly. Each word boomed across the plaza like thunder, especially the word 'eliminated', which made several participants' hearts jump and made them unable to compose themselves.The eliminated youths' faces paled as misery and an unwillingness to accept the results was revealed. Several of them even began to cry.<sub>New novel_chap_ters are published here: elworld.com</sub>Although others might laugh at them for crying, this showed that these boys and girls were still children who had yet to properly experience life and its hardships. An experienced adult would not show tears no matter how badly he or she was unable to accept the result.\u201cIt is time for the eliminated cultivators to leave the plaza!\u201dThe mood in the plaza was heavy and filled with emotion, making it very easy for things to spiral out of control. If the eliminees did not leave, they might cause a ruckus upon hearing the names of those who had passed.More than seven thousand disappointed people soon left, disappearing from the plaza.Many felt pity for these eliminees. After all, quite a number of them had pretty good results and would have easily passed the past year's district exam.Regretfully, this year's district exam was different because of a single Yao Tuohai. His presence had caused a massive influx of participants, with many cultivators even making a special trip here from other cities. As a result, the competition was crueler and the passing requirements much stricter than previous exams.Lin Xun did not feel this was a big deal but he could not help but ponder at this juncture. The exam results are already being announced, are those fellows still not going to act?Of course, it would be best if he could smoothly pass the district exam. However, Lin Xun did not believe such a thing would be allowed to happen.There were roughly two thousand participants left in the plaza. In other words, at least a thousand more would soon be eliminated!It was not long before Yu Canglin began to speak again, \u201cThere are now two thousand participants left. Most of you are of similar ages and possess similar cultivation levels, making it very difficult to make a decision. For the sake of fairness, Lord Yao Tuohai has decided to add in another round of testing!\u201dAnother round of tests!The entire place erupted. No one had expected that there would be another stage of selection at the most critical juncture. This was far too rare.Of course, similar situations had occurred before in the empire's district exams and had ultimately been resolved through an additional round of tests.However, it was the first time something like this had happened in the Donglin City district exam!Lin Xun's eyes narrowed. He suddenly had a feeling that the additional round would not go smoothly for him.\u201cOf course, I have a list of names to announce before the additional round. The cultivators whose names appear on this list have the most outstanding results and need not go through this second round to pass!\u201d<sub>Visit elworld.com, for the best no_vel_read_ing experience</sub>Yet another uproar swept through the plaza. However, it did seem fair after thinking about it. Top performers like Wu Feichong, Yu Miao and Xiao Hen, who had caused big commotions earlier, would definitely pass anyways. It was meaningless and a waste of everyone's time for them to go through another round of selections.As the commotion died down, everyone in the plaza could not help but hold their breaths and look up in anticipation. The remaining participants hoped that their names would appear on the list so they need not go through the second round.Yu Canglin quickly began to announce the names, \u201cWu Feichong, Yu Miao, Xiao Hen\u2026\u201dAbout six hundred names were announced one after another, drawing wave after wave of reactions. Some were envious while others sighed in disappointment.When Lin Xun ascertained his name was not on the list, he could not help but inwardly sneer. As expected, they will not let me pass so easily!Although Lin Xun had seemed inattentive during the exam, he had actually memorized every cultivator's name and age. Hence, he had a rough idea about his relative performance.Quite a number of participants on the name list were of similar age and cultivation to Lin Xun. There was clearly something fishy going on since they were given a pass and Lin Xun was not.After all, there were only six hundred names on the list, meaning there were still about four hundred unfilled slots. So why was his name not there?Lin Xun did not expose this because he knew it would be useless. No one present would help him seek redress for this injustice anyways. Moreover, although the list might seem biased, strictly speaking, it did not break any rules.It was not the final list of passers but a portion of them! Yu Canglin still had more than sufficient room to explain everything!In Lin Xun's opinion, this might be an attempt to incite and provoke him into giving them a valid reason to eliminate him.Lin Xun would not allow them to have their way.However, something unexpected soon happened. Lin Xun did not plan to expose this, but someone else stood up for him. Moreover, it was a very unexpected person\u2015Mu Wansu!However, Lin Xun's heart could not help but sink at this scene as he inwardly swore.Favorite<sub>Visit elworld.com, for the best no_vel_read_ing experience</sub>Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

After briefly hesitating, she spoke up to point it out, \u201cPrincipal Yu, Lin Xun seems to also fit the passing criteria.\u201dHer words were sufficiently courteous and she believed Yu Canglin could tell.However, Yu Canglin's expression turned strange. He glanced at Mu Wansu and said, \u201cI know.\u201dMu Wansu was taken aback. A sliver of unease rose in her heart as she observed Yu Canglin's expression.Her gaze scanned the surroundings and immediately discovered that there was something off about Wu Qun's and some of the nearby influential figures' expressions. They seemed to gloat as if they had long waited for this moment.Mu Wansu's heart sank, realizing she had not only failed to help Lin Xun but instead caused some trouble for him.Sure enough, Yu Canglin's expression turned solemn and cold as he said in a deep voice, \u201cI believe everyone is curious about why Lin Xun is not on the list despite his notable results.\u201dThe other VIPs on the stage silently nodded.Seated at the center, Yao Tuohai displayed an interest in hearing the reason.On the plaza, the waiting participants could not help but be stunned and puzzled by this development. What is going on with this Lin Xun person?They did not understand the reason behind this.However, Lian Fei, Yao Susu, Yang Qun and the others instantly knew, causing them to feel a surge of excitement. They looked toward Lin Xun with pleased gazes as if waiting for the show to begin.Lin Xun inwardly sighed. Sure enough, his enemies' revenge had begun!He did not blame Mu Wansu and even felt a little happy when she tried to stand up for him. Although she detested the sight of him, it was still rare for her to do such a thing when it came to a matter of principles.At this time, Yu Canglin had already stood up and righteously said, \u201cI shan't hide the truth from everyone. Although Lin Xun is pretty talented, he has numerous questionable qualities. Not only does he have bad conduct and no sense of morality, but his methods are also vicious and sinister. Someone as evil as him does not deserve to participate in the district exam!\u201dYu Canglin's words were blunt. Although no foul language was used, these words seemed especially biting and oppressive when they came from the Donglin Academy Principal.<sub>Visit elworld.com for a better_reading experience</sub>The entire place erupted.The bigwigs of Donglin City were not the only ones who were present, there were also numerous academy instructors and the two thousand remaining participants. It was easy to imagine how shocked they were upon hearing Yu Canglin say such atrocious things about a mere youngster.This must be true. Why would someone of Yu Canglin's status and position need to slander a mere youngster?No sense of morality; vicious and sinister methods? What an excellent choice of words!If not for the inappropriateness in this setting, Lian Fei would have praised the principal out loud. It was as if Yu Canglin had taken the words straight from Lian Fei's mouth, nearly making him pump his fist in excitement.Yao Susu also had a wide grin on her face. She said in a low voice, \u201cI did say there was a lingering darkness between his brows and disaster will definitely befall him today!\u201dLian Fei could not help but laugh, feeling extremely pleased with this development. As the Donglin Academy Principal, Yu Canglin's words were worth their weight in gold while Lin Xun was merely a small fry from the slums. This was basically akin to the death penalty for him in the district exam.Lin Xun did not say anything and ignored the uproar around him. He looked towards the tall stage and could not help but seethe with hatred upon seeing the loathsome appearances of Yu Canglin and the other influential Donglin City figures around him, who were showing various expressions. Using these pathetic excuses to tag me with unfair labels, these old bastards are vicious!Once these insidious comments spread, Lin Xun's image would be affected even if he manages to participate in the prefectural exam in the future!In other words, if he failed to debunk the slander, even if he achieved success in the future, others would use this slander to mock and ridicule him. He would have to carry these vile labels for life!\u201cPrincipal Yu, what do you mean by these words? It is inappropriate to so harshly criticize a participant in this public setting.\u201d Mu Wansu could help but question before Lin Xun could react. She had already made a mistake earlier and naturally refused to make a second one.However, Yu Canglin merely waved his hand and said, \u201cMiss Wansu, please calm yourself.\u201dHis sharp gaze scanned the crowd and ultimately locked onto Lin Xun, \u201cSince I dare to make such statements, I have sufficient evidence to prove them. Someone of my status has no need to frame a mere youngster.\u201dThe noise immediately died down. From the crowd's expressions, they seemed to be convinced even before Yu Canglin brought out any evidence.This was the power of influence. Unlike Lin Xun, who was not known by many, Yu Canglin was one of the most well-known figures in Donglin City. He was not only the Donglin Academy Principal but also one of the city's few Spirit Sea stage experts!Who would dare to doubt the words of such a person?\u201cLin Xun, let me ask you this. Are you the boss of the Chopsticks Gang?\u201d Yu Canglin's shout boomed like thunder.<sub>Updated_at elworld.com</sub>Chopsticks Gang?Many people were bewildered but those who knew the name felt their hearts shake and quickly spread the information. Everyone was quickly made aware that it was a gang in the slums. Moreover, the Chopsticks Gang had become rather famous recently because it had successively devoured a dozen underground societies!These underground societies were usually known to engage in activities which could not see the light of day and they were naturally not good people.Several people present understood how chaotic and dirty the slums were. Although everyone was aware that there were many of these underground societies, there was a difference when the topic was openly talked about.Under the crowd's eyes, Lin Xun was silent for a moment before he nodded, \u201cIndeed.\u201dThe entire place stirred as if unable to believe that Lin Xun had actually admitted it! Wasn't this proof of Yu Canglin's words?Even Yu Canglin had not expected Lin Xun to admit it so easily. However, Yu Canglin did not give this much thought.In his view, Lin Xun was far too young and naive. He had responded truthfully because he had been intimidated and no longer dared to resist. At least the kid understood his current circumstances.\u201cThen let me ask you again, were you the one who secretly instigated those gang members to cause a huge ruckus in front of Donglin Academy yesterday?\u201d Yu Canglin loudly shouted again. His piercing stare and oppressive aura made it seem as if he was questioning a criminal.Numerous people, who had not known the truth, could not help but gasp. Yesterday's commotion in front of Donglin Academy had spread to the entire city. Who could have imagined that the mastermind was such a young boy?If this was true, didn't it mean that the charade was actually part of a ploy?No panic was visible on Lin Xun's face. He looked Yu Canglin in the eye and said, \u201cThat's right.\u201dUpon seeing Lin Xun admit again, even Mu Wansu could not sit still any longer and became very worried. The punk is usually so cunning, why has he suddenly become such an idiot today? Doesn't he know that once he admits to everything, let alone passing the exam, he won't even be able to walk out of Donglin Academy today!The flustered Mu Wansu did not know what to do. There were many influential figures present, making it impossible to suppress the situation even with Stone Cauldron Alms' backing.In contrast to Mu Wansu, although Wu Qun's expression was still strict and serious, there was an unconcealable look of satisfaction in his eyes. Lin Xun was still far too young, how could he possibly match wits with veteran individuals like them?Yu Canglin withdrew his gaze from Lin Xun and said, \u201cEveryone, I believe all of you now understand why I said those things earlier. This is why I objected to putting his name on the passing list.\u201dThe other influential figures with the exception of Yao Tuohai in agreement. Although he did not express anything, his silence was in itself a form of acknowledgement.<sub>New novel_chap_ters are published here: elworld.com</sub>Yu Canglin suddenly sighed deeply, \u201cOriginally, Lord Yao and I were going to allow Lin Xun to participate in the additional round, and would have given him a chance if he performed well. After all, he is still young and has a chance to repent in the future. Regretfully, I think many people present will no longer agree.\u201dA strong feeling of disgust rose in Mu Wansu's heart. Yu Canglin had clearly planned everything but was now acting as if he was so magnanimous and righteous. The fakeness of it all was just too nauseating. She honestly never expected the Donglin Academy Principal to be such a person.It didn't matter what Mu Wansu thought. After Yu Canglin's speech, an angry clamor burst from the crowd.\u201cAbsolutely not! He clearly has no morality and is full of evil thoughts. We cannot allow him to continue participating in the district exam!\u201d\u201cThat's right! What an evil imp. To think he's already so vicious at this age. If he grows up, he will definitely spread his poisonous influence and bring disaster to everyone!\u201d\u201cWe cannot let him continue participating in the district exam. In fact, we should capture him and make him pay for his crimes to set an example for others!\u201dThe young were easily incited after all. Their shouting grew increasingly bold and unrestrained since it was someone who had no relation to them.Endless curses and scolding flooded the plaza.The youths in the plaza quickly moved away from Lin Xun as if they found it disgraceful to be anywhere near him, creating an empty space where he stood all alone.At this sight, Mu Wansu felt both powerless and hopeless as she inwardly sighed. Why has Lin Xun become so stupid today?!What should have originally been a district exam had devolved into an angry mob. Who would believe that this was a coincidence?It must have been all planned in advance. How could someone as smart as Lin Xun not see this?Lian Fei laughed excitedly while Yao Susu proudly stuck out her chest. This outcome is far too perfect.On the stage, Wu Qun and Yu Canglin looked at Lin Xun as if he was already dead. Yao Tuohai remained silent and stoic, making it impossible to read his thoughts.On the plaza, the angry mob continued to lash at Lin Xun.It felt as if the world was against him.Favorite<sub>Foll_ow new_episo_des on the elworld.com platform.</sub>Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He looked at the crowd's angry faces, then at the smug and righteous old fellows on the stage and suddenly smiled.It was a very dazzling smile.The smile on his friendly face looked ever so glaring under the sunlight; as if he was laughing at everyone.\u201cWhy are you smiling!\u201d Yu Canglin suddenly shouted as his expression turned frosty.In his mind, Lin Xun should be like a prisoner walking to the gallows. He should have been angrily shouting to try and refute everything or weeping and kneeling to beg for forgiveness. Yu Canglin couldn't have imagined that Lin Xun would still be able to smile in such circumstances.Moreover, his smile was so carefree, so fearless and so offensive! Yu Canglin could not help but fume and bellow at this sight.Why are you smiling!?His voice echoed across the plaza, stunning the crowd who were just moments ago still furiously scolding, ridiculing and blaming Lin Xun. Their gazes pivoted towards the boy.Sure enough, they found the youngster smiling!The sight gave everyone a bizarre and absurd feeling, which was soon replaced by endless boiling rage. The evildoer dares to smile at such a time?Although Lin Xun was all alone in the large empty space around him, he seemed completely unfazed. His gaze swept across the crowd and ultimately landed on Yu Canglin, \u201cI'm amused by how blind and ignorant all of you are; unable to tell right from wrong or differentiate between black and white. You hear a few baseless rumors and judge me as an evil, unscrupulous person. If this were to spread to the Forbidden City, all of you here will be viewed as jokes and disgraces of the district exam!\u201dHis voice was clear and his words were ruthless; he was directly scolding everyone present!The entire place flew into a rage. This little bastard isn't showing even an ounce of repentance at death's door. He definitely deserves death!The faces of the influential figures on the stage also darkened substantially. Being scolded by a youngster in front of everyone was undoubtedly an infringement upon their dignity.Even Yao Tuohai, who had been watching like a bystander since the beginning, frowned slightly.<sub>Updated_at elworld.com</sub>In contrast to the others, Mu Wansu was utterly shocked and alarmed by Lin Xun's gall. Is the punk's counterattack finally beginning?\u201cHow dare you?!\u201d Yu Canglin's expression was stern, cold and oppressive. His eyes shined with an intense light as if he wished he could incinerate Lin Xun on the spot.An ordinary thirteen-year-old would have been intimidated and scared witless, but Lin Xun was the picture of calm and displayed no fear.His expression did not even waver as he looked straight at Yu Canglin without backing down, \u201cHow dare I? Well said! Dare I ask Principal Yu Canglin what crimes have I committed?\u201dWhat crimes have I committed?Everyone found this ridiculous. Lin Xun had clearly admitted to everything earlier. Is he planning to take back his words? How despicable!Before Yu Canglin could reply, Lin Xun continued, \u201cI admit that I'm the boss of the Chopsticks Gang, but have any of you seen me bully the innocent? Has anyone seen me do anything evil?\u201d\u201cNever!\u201dLin Xun stepped forward, his voice charged with emotion, \u201cInstead, after I established the Chopsticks Gang, I restricted my subordinates from doing any more wicked things. Feel free to go and verify this in the slums! If I said a single lie, I will take my own life as an apology to the world!\u201dThe entire place was silent as everyone watched Lin Xun finally retort with an unyielding spirit. Several people's expressions changed slightly as they began to waver.This was a vicious oath to make!Of course, mere verbal promises weren't worth much. However, Lin Xun looked far too composed and did not try to take back his admission of being the Chopstick Gang's boss. Instead, his words seemed to hold a convincing power.On the stage, Yu Canglin's expression darkened, realizing Lin Xun's earlier silence was not a sign of him giving up but instead accumulating his power for the counterattack.However, before Yu Canglin could say anything, the Wu Clan Leader Wu Qun could no longer hold himself back and shouted, \u201cPreposterous! To think the leader of an underground society would dare to try and make himself look innocent. What a joke!\u201dLin Xun's gaze shifted towards Wu Qun. Instead of showing any timidity, a sneer rose from the corners of Lin Xun's mouth, \u201cThis must be the Wu Clan Leader. I actually have something to ask you. Who contacted the Black Tiger Gang Boss Old Tiger a few days ago to arrange a night raid on me with a few hundred men?\u201dAn uproar erupted. The crowd was in disbelief.Lian Fei's expression turned gloomy, a stark contrast to the smugness he was feeling earlier. He had already realized that Lin Xun was planning to drag the Wu Clan down with him. Once that happened, Lian Fei would not be able to escape either!He could not help but become somewhat anxious and agitated. Why were these influential figures still childishly bickering with Lin Xun? Couldn't they capture him to prevent further complications?<sub>Visit to elworld.com discover_new novels.</sub>\u201cRelax, there is no evidence.

It doesn't matter if I die, but the Wu Clan will not have an easy time either once the empire hears of this!\u201dKill me to hide the truth!The corners of Wu Qun's mouth twitched at this phrase. He had finally experienced Lin Xun's cunning wit. The way he randomly pinned crimes on others was devious to say the least.If Wu Qun did kill Lin Xun, it would only validate everything the boy had said!Numerous people's expressions also turned strange when Lin Xun said he was a future pillar of the empire.It was such an arrogant thing to say and more importantly, it had been taken directly from Yao Tuohai's speech before the district exam. No matter how much they didn't want to, the crowd had to admit that Lin Xun's results were pretty good. Hence, no one could dispute it no matter how uncomfortable it made them feel.The corners of Yao Tuohai's lips also twitched at these words but he ultimately did not say anything.Upon realizing that the situation was beginning to spiral out of control, Yu Canglin frowned and solemnly said, \u201cSilence! Today is the district exam, not a criminal proceeding!\u201dHis words returned the crowd to their senses. How did the topic suddenly shift to the Wu Clan? Lin Xun is so devious, this was clearly his intention!Lin Xun immediately said, \u201cPrincipal Yu is right, today is the district exam! Dare I ask what everyone's earlier criticisms of me have to do with the exam?\u201dYu Canglin's expression darkened, \u201cHow can there be no relation? Your questionable character, lack of morality and treacherousness are huge causes for concern.

Fine, allow my sacrifice today to show everyone in the empire how twisted and evil all of you are!\u201dHe acted as if he would rather die than lower his head.This was called advancing through retreating. Go ahead and kill me if you guys have the balls. As long as news of what happened today spreads, none of you will be able to escape either!Lin Xun's reaction made the crowd begin to doubt. Could there really be something more to this matter?Yu Canglin's heart sank. Lin Xun's words were far too sinister and put Yu Canglin between a rock and a hard place.He couldn't help but feel regretful. If he knew this would happen, he would have ordered Lin Xun to be taken away earlier and deny him any chance of speaking!However, it was useless to regret at this juncture.Wu Qun's and the other influential figures' expressions also turned ugly. The district exam was an important matter to the empire. There would certainly be repercussions if it was known that they had forced a participant to his death.Lian Fei's teeth itched as hatred swelled in his chest. Lin Xun's undaunted appearance looked far too disgusting in Lian Fei's eyes!The atmosphere turned stiflingly silent.Every gaze directed at Lin Xun contained a mixture of feelings: confusion, bitterness, hatred, bewilderment, gloating and admiration, although most were filled with hatred.Lin Xun seemed completely unconcerned because it was already do or die for him.

But the fact that Lin Xun's name didn't appear on the list of those who successfully passed stirred up another storm.No one expected something like that to happen.However, Lin Xun knew that this was unavoidable. The people who he had formed enemies with wouldn't easily let him pass the district examination and leave Donglin City.And everything that had happened demonstrated that his prediction was correct.Lin Xun had no time to be angry, had no time to hate anyone, and had no time to feel upset or indignant. He had to do everything he could to save himself.His reasoning told him that anger, hatred, sorrow, and indignation were useless in such a situation. His priority now was to save himself.His present situation had become extremely tense, and even though there were no swords or spears in sight, there was great danger laying low everywhere. The slightest carelessness could lead to a serious accident.It was just that, although Lin Xun was gambling everything, he had overlooked one person\u2014Yao Tuohai!At that moment, Wu Chaoqun and Yu Canglin were weighing up the pros and cons of slaughtering Lin Xun, but Yao Tuohai, who had been watching on the side, finally spoke up.As he sat up straight, his graceful expression was still as gentle as before, but his voice was full of majesty and entered straight to the heart. \u201cThis district examination had been dragged on for far too long. Let's capture this boy first and take him out of the examination venue. I will report the matter to the empire later.\u201dThe sentence that he said in a nonchalant manner was simple and direct. It was as though he was saying that it didn't matter who was right or wrong. He would take Lin Xun away first and he would personally explain to other people if anything happened in the future.

Once he opened his mouth and spoke, it was akin to a devastating thunderbolt\u2014there was no room to turn around at all.Lin Xun's heart suddenly sank to the bottom of his chest. He had been in constant conflict with Yu Canglin and Wu Chaoqun, fighting battles of wits and courage. But the only person who he couldn't see through was Yao Tuohai, who hadn't uttered a word.He originally thought that since Yao Tuohai was an external chief examiner and he was well-known, he didn't want to be dragged into the storm and he showed this through his silence. Who would have thought that he launched a fatal blow at Lin Xun the moment he opened his mouth!He had completely caught Lin Xun off guard!Upon hearing Yao Tuohai's final decision, Yu Canglin and Wu Chaoqun immediately breathed a sigh of relief and a mocking and cold gleam came to their eyes as they glanced at Lin Xun.

Everyone knew that Lin Xun was at the end of the road and couldn't reverse the situation!Lian Fei also smiled. He was so excited that his face was flushing. He hated the fact that he couldn't throw his head back and roar to the sky. After all, it hadn't been easy to get rid of Lin Xun!\u201cWhat did I say just now? He can't escape death as long as my father is around!\u201d Yao Susu said smugly and the corners of her lips curled upwards.\u201cHurry up and capture that boy!\u201d Yu Canglin roared on the platform.A teacher of Donglin Academy who was already called out and was waiting on the side assumed a chilling murderous look upon hearing those words.\u201cWait!\u201dMu Wansu sprang up, her beautiful face bore a look of panic but also a hint of determination. She gritted her teeth and said, \u201cEveryone, please calm down. Lin Xun is someone who the First Young Master of my family regards highly of. He is definitely not a bad person.\u201dEveryone on the platform was dumbstruck. They immediately realized who the First Young Master that Mu Wansu spoke of was and their expressions uncontrollably changed.Shi Xuan!The son of Fortune God Shi!Lin Xun actually caught Shi Xuan's attention!Would Mu Wansu dare to lie? She wouldn't dare to. At least she wouldn't dare to lie using Shi Xuan's name. So what she said is definitely true.It was also because of this that Yu Canglin and Wu Chaoqun felt aggrieved. The boy is about to be captured, how could there be such a sudden change?However, Yao Tuohai furrowed his eyebrows and said displeasedly. \u201cIt doesn't matter who is behind this boy. He has to be severely punished for today's matter. As the chief examiner of this district examination, I don't need anyone to tell me what to do!\u201dWhat kind of person was Yao Tuohai? He was already highly regarded by the minister of the empire thirty years ago. In the entire empire's southwest province, only Liu Wujun could be compared to him. Although he didn't have absolute authority, he was a leading figure and wouldn't be frightened by one sentence.<sub>Foll_ow current_novel on elworld.com</sub>No matter how powerful Shi Xuan was, he was still just the son of Fortune God Shi. Yao Tuohai would only give him face if he came in person.However, they shouldn't even think about it if they wanted Yao Tuohai to take back what he said!Mu Wansu's beautiful face turned deathly pale. She was out of her wits and had lost all hope. It indeed bode ill rather than well for Lin Xun. It would be difficult for him to reverse the situation.However, Yu Canglin and Wu Chaoqun were completely relieved. They incessantly smiled coldly. It's useless even if you bring out the name of Fortune God Shi. Lin Xun, Lin Xun, who in the world can save you now?Boom!Suddenly, Mister Xi, a teacher of Donglin Academy, took action. He was a stern middle-aged man but also a Spirit Dipper Stage expert. Without a word, he made a move. He took a step forward and charged straight towards Lin Xun like an exploding rainbow. His movements were swift, fierce and imposing.As for Lin Xun, he drew a deep breath, and determination filled his eyes. He knew that he had been driven to a desperate situation, but he wouldn't give up so easily.However, just when Lin Xun was about to do something, a sharp whistle pierced the air and stung everyone's eardrums.A bone spear appeared out of nowhere. It was flowing with fine silvery starlight that reacted with the air to release a terrifying power. It aimed straight for the middle-aged man.The stern middle-aged man's face suddenly changed as he fiercely swatted it away.Boom!A terrifying collision instantly rang out and indescribable shock waves swept out like hurricanes in all directions. The nearby cultivators were blasted away before they could even react, and a sudden commotion broke out.The stern middle-aged man reeled back a few steps, his face alternating between blue and white. He was both shocked and furious that someone dared to use violence in Donglin Academy!Not only did the stern middle-aged man act that way, but Yao Tuohai, Yu Canglin, Wu Chaoqun and others on the platform also all simultaneously shifted their gaze to next to Lin Xun.There stood a little girl in a black windproof robe. A wave of qi during exchange had lifted the hat that covered her face, revealing her beautiful little fair face that made the world dim in comparison.She held a two-foot bone spear in a tight grip as she stood quietly beside Lin Xun. If one hadn't seen it with their own eyes, one would find it impossible to imagine how such a little girl could take on the stern middle-aged man at the Spirit Dipper Stage!However, soon, everyone's attention was shifted elsewhere. They couldn't help but feel captivated by the little girl's stunning face.The clamorous square suddenly fell silent and still, and even Yao Tuohai looked stunned.Too beautiful!She was perfect like a masterpiece from heaven. Her beauty seemed to not belong to the human world, yet she was only a little girl of around five to six years old. That impact of her beauty was enough to turn all living beings upside down!<sub>Visit elworld.com, for the best no_vel_read_ing experience</sub>Lin Xun sighed. He could see no one else but Xia Zhi. \u201cYou should leave first. Even if I unfortunately die here, you can avenge me in the future.\u201dXia Zhi shook her head. \u201cIf you're gone, my world will be dark forever. I won't even have any meaning to live.\u201dShe didn't say anything about dying together, but her words still made Lin Xun's heart tremble and complex emotions swirled in his heart.\u201cYou have to go!\u201dLin Xun suddenly gritted his teeth and uttered in a voice that only Xia Zhi could hear. \u201cYou say you won't have any meaning to live? Remember the faces of everyone on the platform except Mu Wansu and kill them all. Then, I can die content!\u201dXia Zhi frowned, lifted her head and ran her eyes over everyone on the platform. A coldness flowed out her clear and dark crescent-shaped eyes.Before Xia Zhi said anything, Yao Tuohai fumed, \u201cYou broke into the examination venue without authorization and disrupted the district examination. Don't even think about leaving here today!\u201dHis voice quaked the entire place.Lin Xun could no longer contain the anger that he had suppressed for so long. It flooded his body like bubbling lava and burned his whole body to the point it was about to erupt.He didn't care about himself but when Yao Tuohai said he wouldn't let Xia Zhi leave, he lost control of his rage and it made all the indignation that he suffered today burst out from the bottom of his heart.He had also gone berserk when he saw Xia Zhi suffer severe wounds while slaughtering Old Tiger Lu. This time, an endless rage burned like a flame in his heart and made him completely lose his rationality.No one noticed, but blood-colored vortexes as deep as an abyss emerged in his eyes.Only Xia Zhi noticed it. Panic-stricken, a rare nervousness surfaced on her little face. She subconsciously reached for Lin Xun's hand as she urged, \u201cDon't.\u201dLin Xun's heart trembled and he snapped awake from his endless rage. He looked perplexed at Xia Zhi and then glanced around to see smug and cold looks on everyone's faces. \u201cI will do everything I can to create a chance for you to escape. You must run away and not care about anything else. This is an order! Do you understand?\u201dXia Zhi stared blankly at him for a long moment. Then, her eyes misted over and she nodded.On the platform, Yao Tuohai couldn't help but frown. He sprang up and uttered coldly, \u201cYou want to escape? As long as I am around, don't even think about it!\u201dNo one knew why Yao Tuohai would be filled with murderous intent. He had lost the calmness and composure that he usually had.Only Yao Tuohai knew that a desire to possess suddenly surged in his heart when he saw Xia Zhi and he couldn't control or suppress it at all!It was an instinctive desire.

Yao Tuohai was a well-known expert in the southwest province of the empire. Thirty years ago, he had already made a name for himself in the empire's national examination and since then the current minister had treated him respectfully.A few years ago, someone had speculated that Yao Tuohai had already set foot into the Heaven Ascension Stage and the only one who could compete with him in the entire southwest province was Great Commander Liu Wujun!The fact that such a prestigious expert had come to Donglin City to preside over the district examination had already caused a great sensation. But now, he wanted to personally deal with Lin Xun and the little girl. This undoubtedly made the people even more excited.Would it be a great honor to see a top expert in action?The countenance of Yu Canglin, Wu Chaoqun and others on the platform had also changed. They were a little surprised and didn't understand why Yao Tuohai did that.Given his identity, how would he need to personally take action?But regardless, no one could stop him.Yao Tuohai clasped his hands behind his back, his manners akin to strolling idly in a courtyard. But his scholarly face was full of disdain like a king patrolling his territory.Everyone was still and the atmosphere was somber. Everyone fixed their eyes on Yao Tuohai; their faces filled with excitement and anticipation.No one cared about whether Lin Xun and the little girl would live or die. They only wanted to see how Yao Tuohai, who was well-known all over the southwest province, would capture the two!Lin Xun felt a terrifying pressure. The suppression came from Yao Tuohai, who was strolling towards him. Every step that Yao Tuohai took made Lin Xun feel as though a boulder from Mount Tai was crushing down on him and his spirit, blood, flesh and aeth power were imprisoned.Lin Xun's face blanched but there was a fierce glint in his eyes. He felt a huge weight bearing down on him that made him unable to budge an inch and almost sank to his knees.Xia Zhi's black robe billowed wildly around her. Her transcendently beautiful face had a detached indifference and only her crescent-shaped eyes were shimmering with pale silvery light.She was also bearing the terrifying pressure.After all, Lin Xun, who only possessed a cultivation base of the sixth layer True Martial Stage, and Xia Zhi, who could at most go up against Spirit Dipper Cultivators, were far inferior to Yao Tuohai, who was strolling towards them.Suddenly, Lin Xun quivered and a streak of blood overflowed his lips. His face had also turned deathly pale.Xia Zhi's heart throbbed with pain when she saw him like that. She subconsciously reached to grab his hand to share the pressure with him.<sub>You can_find the rest of this_content on the elworld.com platform.</sub>Yao Tuohai's eyes lit up, and he lifted his right hand and made a grabbing motion in the air.Buzz!A giant invisible hand suddenly took shape in the air. It was bright and blazing with raging black flames, resembling a claw emerged from hell to absorb the life of the world!The entire world seemed to be quaking at that moment and an indescribably terrifying power was released from black flame hand. It stifled even the audience and made their blood run cold like they had fallen into an ice cave.But to Lin Xun and Xia Zhi, it resembled a sea of black flames descending upon them and drowning them. They couldn't evade or escape no matter what they did.Too terrifying!Such a mysterious and terrifying power was beyond imagination. It was the power unique to the Heaven Ascension Stage\u2014the power of imagination!The two of them will no doubt be finished!Everyone shared the same thought. Even a Spirit Sea cultivator would find it difficult to survive such a terrifying attack.A look of shock washed over the face of Yu Canglin, one of the few Spirit Sea cultivators present, and his eyes went wide with fear.It seemed slow but everything happened in the blink of an eye. The speed was so fast that it would make a person feel despair.Lin Xun subconsciously exhausted all his strength to wrap his arms around Xia Zhi to protect her.Xia Zhi instinctively struggled but she instantly calmed down when she felt Lin Xun's warmth. Only the terrifying silvery light continued to burn in her eyes.Suddenly, the world suddenly plunged into darkness. It was so abrupt and so fast that it felt like eternal night had come.Almost at the same time, a drop of crystal-clear water silently emerged before the giant black flame hand.The seemingly insignificant tiny drop of water caused Yao Tuohai's pupils to constrict and an intense feeling of unease surged to his heart.Bang!The drop of water suddenly disintegrated and gathered to form a black flower. Its pure black color made it seem like it was picked from the eternal night and the cold petals exuded the aura of death through its beauty.Yao Tuohai lost his usual calmness and composure when he saw the black flower bloom. His scholarly face dramatically changed and a cold stream rose in his heart.The Black Glory Flower!Why would it appear here?<sub>New novel_chap_ters are published here: elworld.com</sub>Could it be\u2026Boom!As the black flower blossomed, the beauty and glamor of the world went away. Yao Tuohai felt pain shoot through him like he had been severely wounded before he was sent flying across tens of feet and was slammed into the ground.At the same time, the eternal night that shrouded the world faded and the black flower was gone. The heaven and earth restored its brightness and clearness, dazzling the eye.Everyone looked perplexed. At that moment, they had experienced the darkness of eternal night, which felt like a fleeting nightmare, and they inexplicably shuddered with fear and panic.What just happened?Everyone peered around and saw Lin Xun protecting Xia Zhi with his body. But to their surprise, Lin Xun and Xia Zhi hadn't been captured.Their gaze shifted further and they saw Yao Tuohai fall on his buttocks more than tens of feet away. As though struck by lightning, they almost couldn't believe their eyes.Disheveled and ashen-faced, Yao Tuohai was filled with fear and panic. His imposing manner was completely gone and instead he looked distressed.What actually happened?The entire audience was dumbstruck and the atmosphere had become even more still. Even Yu Canglin, Wu Chaoqun and other influential people in Donglin City looked blank and their minds seemed to have drifted from them.Lin Xun slowly lifted his head and glanced around. A hint of puzzlement came to his eyes. I'm not dead?Xia Zhi also raised her little face and surveyed the surroundings. It was unknown what she had noticed but a rare nervousness crossed her beautiful little face and a familiar fretful feeling reappeared in the depths of her heart, only that it was much stronger than before.At that moment, footsteps rang from afar, sounding particularly clear in the still and silent atmosphere.Everyone subconsciously looked up and saw sixteen men in the empire's black court attire. They were lined up in twos and bore solemn expressions as they came their way.Even if they were walking, they maintained an extremely disciplined stance. Their every little movements were coordinated and orderly!As they assembled on the square, everyone felt a terrifying pressure assaulting their faces. It was as though they weren't facing sixteen people but an invincible army.The people in their way seemed to be shrouded by an invisible force and moved aside without them realizing. It wasn't until a good moment later that they noticed that they had changed spots and they trembled all over and sweated profusely.Shua!Meanwhile, Yu Canglin, Wu Chaoqun and other influential people from Donglin City got to their feet at the same time, aghast by the scene.Yao Tuohai's gaze turned complex when he saw the scene. He pushed himself up but his heart felt incomparably heavy.<sub>Updated_at elworld.com</sub>Black Glory Envoys!Which important person has come?Lin Xun and Xia Zhi turned their heads at the same time.Behind the sixteen men in black was a black carriage pulled by four mysterious black one-horned beasts.The black carriage seemed to be constructed from the curtains of the eternal night. A complex starry sky scene akin to a rune pattern was floating on its surface.The moment the peculiar army of people appeared, an invisible force stilled and silenced everyone.No one knew how they entered Donglin Academy, why they came, or why no one stopped them.An old man got up in the carriage, slowly opened the door, and bowed slightly. His manners were flawless.A woman came out of the carriage. Her hair was tied up in a high bun and secured with a black hollowed-out phoenix wood hairpin. She looked very young, and her fair and silky skin seemed very delicate. Her sky-blue eyes gave off a coldness and detachedness unique to those who were superior.She wore a perfectly tailored gorgeous black set of robes that highlighted her slim figure. On her slender and fair pinky was a ring with black gems embedded. The ring was shaped like an open eye and was extremely frightening.She was a traditional, graceful, noble and beautiful woman, but she exuded an aura of solitary, darkness, coldness and majesty that belonged to the superior.However, almost no one could see her. They only saw a graceful and slender figure that seemed like a figure from the endless darkness. Apart from that, everything else was boundless darkness.That kind of darkness seemed capable of devouring the soul and drowning everything in the world!At that moment, fear surged in everyone's hearts and everyone was as silent as cicadas in winter. The atmosphere grew increasingly deathly still and even the people on the platform felt a chill run down their spines like they had fallen into an ice cave.Yao Tuohai's expression was extremely complicated. He came to Donglin Academy to act as an external examiner of the district examination but his real purpose was to wait for the arrival of an important person!However, he didn't expect the important person to stop him when he was trying to capture Lin Xun and Xia Zhi!Why?He couldn't understand.But it was enough to make his heart pound with fear and unease.As though she sensed that Yao Tuohai's emotions were fluctuating, she swept a glance over him after getting off the carriage and said in a unique, charming husky voice, \u201cGiven your strength, you don't deserve to touch what doesn't belong to you.\u201d<sub>New novel_chap_ters are published here: elworld.com</sub>Yao Tuohai's face blanched.The woman paid no more attention to him but she shifted her gaze to Xia Zhi\u2026FavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
