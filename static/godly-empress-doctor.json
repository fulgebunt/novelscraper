    "Chapter 1": "Chapter 1: Abandoned CrippleMartial Lord Empire.Zuo Qing Yun and Feng Wu were both only eight years old.Puttt__________The cold violet double-edged sword in Zuo Qing Yun's hand thrusted at the space between Feng Wu's eyebrows!A drop of amber colored true phoenix blood was dug out by the point of the sword, suspended in midair.Zuo Qing Yun's left hand grabbed that amber colored bead of blood. With a 'puchi' sound, it was immediately squeezed and exploded!A handful of blood, yet, a strange cold smile bloomed on Zuo Qing Yun's face.Watching the little girl in so much pain that she curled up on the ground, Zuo Qing Yun laughed coldly.\"Feng Wu! In this world, there can only be one person possessing true phoenix blood! Since there's already me, then why did you have to exist!\"\"Who wants to be joined with you as a pair of phoenixes in the capital? What qualifications do you have to be mentioned on equal terms as me? !\"\"So what if you were betrothed early on? The crown prince consort's position is mine, Jun Lin Yuan is also mine!\"\"Surprisingly, the one who Jade Palace's Empress favored was you? Heh heh, now, you're already a cripple! The goddess of Jade Palace can only be me! You can go die now!\"The cold violet sword in Zuo Qing Yun's hand immediately thrusted at Feng Wu's heart! Both of Feng Wu's hands held firmly to that cold violet sword, the palms of her hands were cut by the sword's edge, blood flowed profusely, yet it seemed as if she couldn't feel the pain.At the space between her brows, spirit qi vaporized unceasingly. The entire body of one said to be a heaven defying cultivator, at this moment, was fading away at a rate visible to the naked eye.Her gifted cultivator's body was fading away because of the disappearance of her true phoenix' blood!Feng Wu's pair of pitch-black, deep eyes rigidly stared fixedly at Zuo Qing Yun!\"Go die!\" Zuo Qing Yun exerted force. In an instant, the cold violet sword pierced through Feng Wu's heart, 'pllkkch' sounded, the force penetrated, bright red blood spurt and splashed like mist, spraying on Zuo Qing Yun's face.Zuo Qing Yun's bloodstained face smiled eerily. \"From now on, my name is Zuo Qing Luan*! Noble Luan fire phoenix, the ruler of all birds. I, Zuo Qing Luan, is the only phoenix ordained by heaven in all of Martial Lord Empire!\"Feng Wu fell on the ground. Her originally clear pupils gradually became hazy. She saw the Zuo family's leader support Zuo Qing Yun and gradually move further away. She could feel her own consciousness slipping away. She could feel her own life gradually fading\u2026\u2026Zuo Qing Yun, you took advantage of the time my master, Master Meiren, is condensing his corporeal body to destroy my true phoenix blood. Wait until my master appears, your entire family, your entire clan, even all of Martial Lord Empire, will they be able to endure his fury? !Her Master wasn't human, it's more accurate to say that he's a soul connected to her Dragon Phoenix Spirit Ring.They say that fate determined our incarnation and that having a good father was better than anything.Feng Wu expressed pride. Even though she hadn't seen her father before, she had the most, most, most awesome beautiful master in all of the continent!She still remembered the first time she triggered the Dragon Phoenix Spirit Ring, her beautiful master slowly appeared from the spirit ring's space.She was three years old at the time, naive and pure as she looked up at the young man dressed in dirt free white clothes. \"Are you\u2026\u2026very strong?\"Both of her master's hands were placed behind him as he replied casually. \"It's acceptable, I used to dominate this continent.\"During these years, beautiful master, who existed as only a soul, was finally able to condense divine phoenix blood, then prepared to refine a corporeal body. That way, he would no longer merely exist as a soul within the Dragon Phoenix Spirit Ring.Was it a hallucination that emerged at death's door? Feng Wu's eyelids became heavier and heavier and seemed to see a person dressed in white, whiter than snow, whose entire body was graceful, a beautiful master who's just like a god.A voluminous pure white jade flower, just like a pure and holy white snowflake that's been purified.He tread gently on the breeze appearing from within the Dragon Phoenix Ring.When Feng Wu was conscious again, she discovered that she was already lying in the crook of his warm arms.On his body was the world's cleanest breath, the fresh and clean essences which lingered on plants.\"Master\u2026\u2026\" After Feng Wu saw her loved one, her nose tingled as the truth was revealed.Master could hold her, Master succeeded in condensing his body! He finally fulfilled his long cherished wish!Master's snow white loose robe spread in layers upon layers of folds on the ground, that pair of deep, self-controlled beautiful eyes fixed at the wound between Feng Wu's eyebrows. He didn't express any fluctuations in his emotions.\"Master, will I die?\" The little girl's pupils were as clear as water.His eyebrows were as calm as still winds and light winds. \"No.\"After he spoke, his jade like slender fingers pointed, very quickly, a drop of gold colored blood flew out from the space between his eyebrows.Feng Wu's eyes shrunk violently! That was divine phoenix blood! Master's divine phoenix blood! It was much more powerful than true phoenix blood!Master spoke coldly and apathetically. \"Don't move around.\"He forced the drop of divine phoenix blood into the area between Feng Wu's eyebrows.\"No!\"Feng Wu felt a very bad premonition from her heart. \"Master! I won't die, but how about you? ! Divine phoenix blood is the source of life essence for your soul, without it, your body\u2026\u2026\"His eyes were mysterious and profound. \"The divine phoenix blood will serve as a temporary seal, a Nine Spirit Reversal Pill is needed for you to cultivate again\u2026\u2026\"Before finishing his sentence, his body gradually disappeared.\"No!\" All of the veins on Feng Wu's body, which was covered in blood bulged. 'Hiisss', all of the strength in her body was exhausted!She did all she could to extend her hand and hold onto him!\"Master!\"But her master, who seemed as pure and holy as an immortal still faded away between her fingers\u2026\u2026\"Master!\" Feng Wu, whose strength was exhausted, kneeled on the ground with a bang, covered in red, blood soaked clothes from head to toe, her fair complexioned face mottled with blood stains, even more red were her eyes sobbing blood!Her heart was so distressed, she couldn't breathe!Heart to pained her whole body twitched!She blamed herself and wished that she could kill herself!Zuo Qing Yun destroyed her true phoenix blood, yet she didn't hate like this!She'd rather die than to have her pure and holy, faultless master receive the slightest bit of injury, so unwilling was she to part with him!Hate, loathing!Feng Wu angrily clenched her fists tightly, her fingernails practically stabbed into her flesh, her fingertips were dripping blood!Zuo Qing Yun, this enmity is absolutely irreconcilable.

As her head cleared bit by bit, she finally recalled how Zuo Qing Yun destroyed her true phoenix blood. In order to save her, master exhausted himself once more and lost consciousness\u2026\u2026this wasn't a dream, but was instead something that truly happened five years ago!Since her true phoenix blood was destroyed, she, who previously was a genius, fell from grace, and became the Feng clan's shame, even her beautiful mother and brother were thrown out together to the empire's border city of the Northern Territories\u2014\u2014\u2014-the Feng family's old home.Qiu Ling fetched a pair of shaggy slippers, placed them in front of Feng Wu, and supported her to the front of the dressing table to help dress and groom her.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\"Sister! Older Sister! There's a letter from the Imperial Capital!\"The sound of hurried footsteps transmitted, very quickly, a very small youngster rushed in like a gust of wind.The little youngster appeared to be twelve years old and was very good-looking.His skin was better than snow, his features were refined, especially that pair of eyes, long and dense eyelashes turned up slightly, the dark eyes were large and exceptionally bright.Not waiting for Feng Wu to ask, Seventh Little Feng stuffed the letter in his hand into Feng Wu's hand.\"Older Sister, hurry and read it!\" This was a red envelope, which represented an early warning, it's not surprising that Seventh Little Feng was this anxious.Bystanders were anxious, yet Feng Wu's expression was as calm and collected as before, her slender fingers as fair as jade opened the envelope, while her eyes scanned the contents once.\"Sister!\" Little Seventh Feng looked unblinkingly at Feng Wu, saw her knit her brows, and became even more anxious. \"Did something happen at the capital? Was there some misfortune?\"Qiu Ling was also a face full of curiosity and nervousness.Feng Wu held up the letter in her hand and faintly smiled. \"It's nothing, Jun Lin Yuan is carrying out an inspection of the border cities, that's all.\"Qiu Ling cried out in surprise. \"That powerful as the heavens, unsurpassed crown prince wants to come?\"Feng Wu 'hm'ed. \"Him, we just need to avoid him. It's just that the Feng family had continuously attempted to cling to this crown prince, so I'm afraid people from the clan will be coming again.\"\"Ah! Then what should we do? !\" Seventh Little Feng was almost jumping up and down. \"We've already been thrown out to this old home at the border, what else do they want? Do they want to eradicate us? !\"Feng Wu shot an unhappy glance at Seventh Little Feng. \"What are you worried for?\"Seventh Little Feng was so worried he nearly cried. \"Older Sister! How can I be calm! If you were like before, no matter who came, you could send them flying easily, but now, you\u2026\u2026your cultivation has already been crippled!\"\"Seventh Young Master!\" Qiu Ling's expression was unprecedentedly strict!Seventh Little Feng also realized he'd misspoken as his hands covered his mouth, and two eyes guiltily opened wide as they stared at Feng Wu. For a period of time, he didn't know what to do.Feng Wu smiled indifferently. \"So what if my cultivation has been crippled. Does it mean that your older sister can never cultivate again?\"Seventh Little Feng's eyes instantly shined. \"Sister! You have a way? Did you find a way to cultivate again? !\"Feng Wu spread out her hands. \"Not yet.\"In a flash Seventh Little Feng's shoulders collapsed defeatedly.At an angle that others couldn't see, a mysterious deep thought appeared within Feng Wu's eyes.Master had said that in order to cultivate again, she'd need to refine a Nine Spirit Reversal Pill.She knew the remedy and also knew how to refine the pill. It's just that she's still one medical ingredient short \u2014\u2014 Immortal Spirit Fruit.This Immortal Spirit Fruit, Feng Wu had been watching it attentively for five years, and could tell that it's going to ripen soon\u2026\u2026Feng Wu also understood well that the Feng family's Eldest Feng and Sixth Feng will be arriving very soon. Based on these two people's aggressive personality, without protection, her beautiful mother and sweet brother will undoubtedly be bullied miserably. That's why she needed to quickly obtain the Immortal Spirit Fruit and start to cultivate!Feng Wu clenched her fists tightly: Jun Lin Yuan, are you really merely inspecting the Northern Territories, that simple? !From the author: PS: Beg that you bless this new book \u2014 mua mua \u2014You May Like UndoUndoUndoUndoUndoUndoUndoUndoPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 3": "Chapter 3: Meeting at Cloud Gathering PavilionNorthern Territories, Cloud Gathering Pavilion.Cloud Gathering Pavilion was the nearest restaurant to Icebound Forest, many cultivators who entered Icebound Forest would stop at Cloud Gathering Pavilion. That's why customers came like the clouds here, prosperous and thriving.It's just that those who ordinarily came were mostly male, but today, some strange wind was blowing. Practically all of the people sitting at the restaurant were beautiful young ladies who were dressed up.Today, Feng Wu's vivacious beautiful face was disguised with makeup, turning into a common, ordinary young lady, that dazzling charm and spirited bearing was also mostly covered up.Qiu Ling was also disguised as a very unremarkable little maid.Feng Wu and Qiu Ling just sat down when the voices of a conversation clearly transmitted over.\"Will the crown prince really come to Northern Territories?\"\"Based on reliable news, the crown prince already arrived at Northern Territories. I used quite a bit of money to purchase this news, you can't tell others!\"\"This time, I can finally glimpse at the crown prince's elegant manner! He's actually an exceptional young genius at the top of the rankings! To be able to see him up close, I haven't lived in vain.\"Feng Wu: \"\u2026\u2026\"Qiu Ling pouted as she inwardly ridiculed them, these young ladies truly haven't seen the world. Was meeting the crown prince enough for them to not have lived in vain? Her own young miss was even betrothed to the crown prince before!\"Eh? There's even an empty seat here, no offense if I sat here, right?\" A voice pleasant to the ear sounded by Feng Wu's ear.Feng Wu raised her head and faced a quick-witted, pretty pair of eyes.Feng Xun? With a single glance, Feng Wu instantly recognized the figure before her, a youngster whose body exuded an unordinary cultivator's aura.Recalling back then at the capital, they even fought before. It's just that right now, her appearance had been modified. In addition to five years having passed, it's normal that Feng Xun was unable to recognize her.If she hadn't remembered incorrectly, Feng Xun and Jun Ling Yuan were actually friends who grew up together, companions who got along the best.With a 'paa', his fan opened and covered most of his face, after which he faced Feng Wu and smiled. \"You guys can act as if I'm not here.\"Not disturb each other? How's that possible, Feng Wu thought inwardly. She came out to ask about Jun Lin Yuan and to find out if he came because of the Immortal Spirit Fruit. By chance, Feng Xun ran right into them, how could she let him go?Feng Wu pondered inwardly as she thought about how she should go about getting the information she needed from Feng Xun without alerting him.Feng Xun loved excitement. His pair of round eyes spun around the entire restaurant.Suddenly, he used the folding fan to jab at Feng Wu. \"You know who that is?\"Feng Wu followed the direction of shaft of his fan and looked over. It was a woman at the prime of youth who wore a hat with a veil. Looking through the hazy white thin cloth, it was possible to see a little bit of an outline.\"Who?\"\"Fairy Mu Yao.\" The corners of Feng Xun's mouth curved.Feng Wu's eyes were slightly alarmed. Jade Palace's holy lady, Fairy Mu Yao?\"\"Precisely.\" Feng Xun complacently raised his brows. \"Did she think that she could escape my eyes by wearing a hat with a veil? You should know that these eyes of mine are discerning eyes.\"Even Jade Palace's Holy Lady is secretly pursuing the crown prince? She didn't expect that Jun Lin Yuan was now so surprisingly popular.Voices of discussions continuously transmitted from within the crowd.\"Right, did you guys hear, that fifth daughter of the Feng family was abandoned by the clan five years ago. I heard that during these years, she's been living at this border city.\"\"The one you mean shouldn't be Feng Wu, right?\" A voice entered the conversation.\"Besides that Feng Wu, who could it be? Speaking of which, I feel vexed whenever I hear this name. What do you guys think, how could she still have the face to continuing using this name. Why hasn't she changed her name, yet?\"\"This, is there a story behind this?\"\"Surprisingly, you don't know?\"You May Like UndoUndoUndoUndoUndoUndoUndoUndoPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Yet whenever anybody mentioned him, their first thought was that he was the crown prince's childhood friend and attendant.

No more notes about 'spit blood' from now on.)Just how unlucky was that?Clearly, the first to be alerted was her, the first to turn around and run was also her, yet the Flaming Cloud Hawk especially chose her to bully. One could only say, her luck was really\u2026\u2026If he was that young girl, he probably would've spit blood by now, right?Feng Xun looked at Qiu Ling, who was so worried she's getting dizzy and patted her thin shoulders. \"Sigh, young lass, your mistress appeared to be quite frail and will die for sure, you also shouldn't have excessive expectations that she'd return alive, just accept fate. That's right, if you really have nowhere to go, seeing as we are sharing the same table, how about I buy you a meal?\"\"Get lost!\" Qiu Ling was so angry she stomp her foot. \"My mistress is quite awesome! In this world, there isn't anything that can stump her! Definitely, nothing will happen to her!\"Those spectating young girls were all terrified, one after another, they pat the center of their bellies and rejoiced with lingering fears. Fortunately, the one who was captured wasn't them.And just at this time, Jun Lin Yuan also changed to another direction as he rushed after the Flaming Cloud Hawk!\"Heavens! Look you guys, it's the crown prince! He's chasing the Flaming Cloud Hawk!\"\"I envy that young common girl so much! It'd be so great if I was captured by the Flaming Cloud Hawk! I can then get close to the crown prince!\"\"Not only being able to see him clearly up close, but also being saved by the crown prince, this is the scene of a hero saving the beauty, he just happens to be the one I can give my heart to! !\"\"That's right, why didn't the Flaming Cloud Hawk capture me? Really! That ordinary girl, why did she run to the very front! Otherwise, the one to be captured would've been me!\"\"That girl must've done it on purpose! She looks ordinary, but is so crafty, she must've done it on purpose!\"Qiu Ling really was so angry that she trembled from head to toe!These girls\u2026\u2026these girls\u2026\u2026just for the sake of meeting the crown prince, do they not even want their lives? ! To go this far? !Feng Xiu stroked his nose a bit, in regards to these girls's way of thinking that ignored their own lives, he was already used to it, having frequently been together with Jun Lin Yuan, he's very much used to it\u2026\u2026\"Don't be upset, it'll harm your health\u2026\u2026\" Feng Xun sympathized as he shot a glance at Qiu Ling. \"Alrighty, seeing as your mistress is so out of luck, I will personally go to Icebound Forest and look around. If I can fish her out, then I'll fish her out of there.\"His voice hadn't dropped when Feng Xun's figure already disappeared.And at this moment, Feng Wu, who hung from the Flaming Cloud Hawk's fang like a strip of meat fluttering freely out in the sun to dry\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-The inside of her heart was truly was already falling apart\u2014\u2014- \u2014\u2014\u2014Current Schedule: 5 regular happy dose a weekCan't wait for your next dose?

She couldn't let go of her hands! Her entire body was fixed by the freezing sword intent, her pair of hands even more so felt as if someone used a powerful adhesive to glue her to the Flaming Cloud Hawk's talon!Feng Wu's heart truly was breaking apart!At this critical juncture of what's known as 'opportunity only knocks once'!This kind of altitude won't come around again. This was probably her only chance to flee for her life!Thinking of this, Feng Wu exerted all of the strength on her body, and attempted to use both hands to separate herself from the hawk's fang\u2026\u2026It's a hopeless struggle. Feng Wu then straightforwardly did a pull-up, brought her chin up, and used her head to smash against those thick layers of iced frost.Bang bang bang!The Flaming Cloud Hawk watched Feng Wu engrossed in knocking her head incessantly as puzzlement covered it face. \"What're you doing?\"Feng Wu wasn't in a good mood as she shot a glance at it. \"I'm just having trouble figuring something out, ok?\"It's impossible for her to tell the Flaming Cloud Hawk her plan to escape.

    "Chapter 9": "Chapter 9: Violent CollisionThe Flaming Cloud Hawk's pair of bloody eyes angrily glared at the young human in front of it at the moment.Borrowing the Flaming Cloud Hawk's light, Feng Wu saw Jun Lin Yuan again.His flawless beautiful countenance unequalled in the world!Dark eyes hidden in depth, straight and high bridge of the nose, thin lips with deep contours, a body's build that's quick and slender, and abundant spirit as graceful as jade, causing winds and clouds to change color, overshadowing the sun and moon's splendor.However, when looking at his person, what's most noticeable had always been his pair of deep eyes!That pair of eyes as sharp as a falcon's, cold, tyrannical and powerful, noble and dignified, making people heart's grow apprehensive, not daring to look straight at them.At this moment, the young man's handsome face was focused and stern, the sleeves of his robe fluttering in the wind.He tread on the air and stood, his sword pointing to the heavens.His earth shattering sword intent approached, the spherical cloud layers were fragmented! A blast wave directed at the giant Flaming Cloud Hawk shot forth!With a look, Feng Wu's heart immediately sank!At present, all of her spiritual force had been lost, if she was hit by the blast wave, it'd really kill her!A full grown living person like her, hanging from the Flaming Cloud Hawk's fangs, even swaying to and fro in the wind. Crown Prince Jun Lin Yuan, are you truly looking, yet, can, not, see? !However, during Jun Lin Yuan's attack of fine ice needles, a torrential rain of pear flower needles aimed at the huge Flaming Cloud Hawk's body's critical acupuncture points. Feng Wu emotionally discovered that Jun Lin Yuan's vision was quite good. He simply chose to ignore her, that's all.In his eyes, was she merely an unknown stranger?So callous in severing all relations with her, so devoid of human emotions!Bang!As Jun Lin Yuan raised his hand, an enormous, incomparable spirit force rose like a storm from the palm of his hand and transferred to the Heaven Slaying Sword!He brandished the sword at the sky then chopped down!Feng Wu's eyesight was still able to follow. What she saw was the Flaming Cloud Hawk's huge body. Its latter half was completely cut by Jun Lin Yuan!The giant Flaming Cloud Hawk roared and bellowed in pain, the sound of that bellow was just like that of a maelstrom, a tornado!Hanging from its talon, Feng Wu only felt a frantic air wave engulfing her entire body!Her eardrums practically vibrated into pieces!Her internal organs nearly became displaced!Without exception, her nose, ears, mouth, were all seeping blood, her entire body appeared bloodstained and mottled. In that split second, Feng Wu truly thought that she'd died.Before she had a chance to catch her breath, the enraged giant Flaming Cloud Hawk and Jun Lin Yuan engaged each other in combat again!The fight was intense, space seemed as if it was crushed by them!Feng Wu was jolted around just like someone sitting in an airplane encountering the worst possible air turbulence. Her body was like a sack that was being thrown back and forth crazily!Slam slam slam!This wasn't the sound of Jun Lin Yuan and the Flaming Cloud Hawk fighting hand to hand, rather, it was the sound of Feng Wu's fluttering body striking against the Flaming Cloud Hawk's face\u2026\u2026Really, even her bones were falling apart\u2026\u2026Feng Wu had always been strong, but at this time, she really had an urge to cry.It wasn't because of the pain, rather, it's because of her back luck.What's even worse luck was that \u2014\u2014\u2014-Jun Lin Yuan's sword was returned to its scabbard while his eyes were brimming with ice-cold killing intent!Boom\u2014\u2014\u2014A fist exploded forth!

    "Chapter 10": "Chapter 10: Of What Use Are You?After the giant Flaming Cloud Hawk transformed into berserk mode, its drooping wing opened, its huge shadow hid the sky and covered the earth, an entire mountain could seek shelter from its shadow. It could be seen how enormous its body was!How were its feathers anything like feathers, the glossy luster was just like armor!Feng Wu grabbed at empty air and her body fell straight down!The situation was extremely urgent!Life or death decided in an instant!During the most critical juncture, she finally was able to grab that Flaming Cloud Hawk's sharp fingernail.Its talon was as sharp as a knife, the palm of Feng Wu's hand was cut deeply, blood rushed forth like a water spring!Pain\u2026\u2026however, Feng Wu's brows didn't crease, she borrowed the force in the middle of her hand to nimbly flip her body gracefully upside down and climbed once more inside the Flaming Cloud Hawk's huge talon.At this time, she finally relaxed a little.During the time her life was hanging by a thread just now, if she'd reacted a split second later, she would've died for sure!Thinking of this, Feng Wu pair of as black as ink, beautiful eyes, shot like lighting at Jun Lin Yuan!In this crown prince's eyes, was everyone else crickets and ants!He was calm and noble, whereas she cut a sorry figure and was falling apart.Anger\u2026\u2026ignited like a blaze in Feng Wu's chest!Strength\u2026\u2026an unprecedented thirst to have exceedingly powerful strength!Feng Wu breathed in a deep breath, Immortal Spirit Fruit, she must get her hands on an Immortal Spirit Fruit and refine it into a Nine Spirit Reversal Pill. Only after that could she cultivate once more\u2026\u2026The road to the future is still very long, Jun Lin Yuan, we'll wait and see!And right now, what's most important was to survive.The Flaming Cloud Hawk's frightened eyes stared at Jun Lin Yuan!How could there be such a powerful young man in the world!How old could he be? Yet his strength exceeded someone already half a step into the emperor realm!It had already transformed! Yet unexpectedly, it couldn't defeat him even after it transformed!In a few years, after he matured, would that most formidable existence at the center of Icebound Forest also be afraid of going against him?Thinking to this point, a wisp of despair appeared in the Flaming Cloud Hawk's eyes!However, since it's unable to flee, then even at the cost of its life, it'd stake everything against this irreconcilable enemy!Feng Wu saw the manianical blaze inside the Flaming Cloud Hawk's eyes as her heart chilled to the lowest possible temperature!She didn't care about the hawk's life and death, but if it was going all out against Jun Lin Yuan, then that'd be disastrous to a small fish in the pond like her, moreover, she'd die for sure!It's not that she didn't want to beg Jun Lin Yuan, it's just that she knew it'd be of no use.Because right now, in Jun Lin Yuan's eyes, she was merely an insignificant stranger.This person had always been so indifferent and heartless, it made people's hair stand up in anger!His life creed is: Survive if you have the ability, don't waste the air you breathe if you don't have ability.In his heart, there were only two kinds of people: The first kind people was his people, the second kind of people was other people.He'd shield his own people to the end, and turn a blind eye to anyone else.It's quite clear that Feng Xun was considered one of his people, whereas Feng Wu\u2026\u2026 she's 'other people'.Even though this made people angry and dispirited, it was still a fact.That's why Feng Wu placed her hopes of surviving on the giant Flaming Cloud Hawk!Feng Wu's gaze was directed once more beneath her body \u2014\u2014\u2014Icebound Forest was divided into five regions altogether. The center of Icebound Forest was ruled by the most frightening overlord!Indeed, even the empire's most powerful experts were fearful of this region.During these years, because it's vital for her to follow the Immortal Spirit Fruit, Feng Wu gained an extremely detailed understanding of Icebound Forest.That's why with only a glance, she recognized that this was the east region.In merely a split second, a detailed map of this and the surrounding areas appeared in her mind!\"If you fight it out with him, not even one of his hair would be touched, yet you would've fallen and died. How about we work together?\" In spite of the wounds on her hands, Feng Wu grabbed at the Flaming Cloud Hawk's talon as her nimble body quickly moved inside the Flaming Cloud Hawk's ear.\"Work together?

Without cultivation, one could only be this miserable. \"\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026fine.\"Feng Wu sat inside the Flaming Cloud Hawk's ear and told it Jun Lin Yuan's weak point. \"This guy, Jun Lin Yuan, possesses heaven defying cultivation, which you have no way of defeating. Escaping is also out of the question, however, there's one method that could be used to temporarily distract him.\"Thinking to this point, the corners of Feng Wu's mouth curved into a smile. \"He has severe mysophobia!\"This idea was actually inspired by the Flaming Cloud Hawk's drop of saliva.While Feng Wu was speaking, she was leaning her head towards that black robed young man facing them.His right hand curled into a fist, spiritual qi billowed outward, lingering around his clenched fist, which warped this area of space!An incomparably huge spiritual force erupted between heaven and earth!\"Hurry!\" Feng Wu sat inside the Flaming Cloud Hawk's right ear and shouted!The Flaming Cloud Hawk was skeptical, but it was holding on to the last ray of hope in a desperate situation, its body rushed towards Jun Lin Yuan at high speed!Just as both sides got ready to face off \u2014\u2014- \u2014\u2014-rumble rumble\u2014\u2014\u2014 \u2014\u2014- a dense white sticky substance the Flaming Cloud Hawk glued together bubbled up like a geyser and spit at Jun Lin Yuan!It could clearly be seen that this godly, exceptionally impressive young man's face \u2014\u2014\u2014 \u2014\u2014\u2014became ashen in an instant!His body stiffened in a flash!He retreated continuously, retreat, retreat, retreat\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\"Run!\" Feng Wu shouted while sitting crossed-legged inside the bird's ear.The Flaming Cloud Hawk also was surprised that the result would be this good!It flew at high speed at once and dashed away!The bird exerted all of its strength to rush out front, speed rising rapidly to its maximum!Sitting inside its right ear, Feng Wu continually reminded it. \"Go left ahead, lean at a forty-five degrees angle, speed up, faster faster faster!\"The Flaming Cloud Hawk originally looked down on Feng Wu, but just a moment ago, after their success, it unexpectedly discovered that she was surprisingly effective, that's why it subconsciously listened to Feng Wu's advice.\"Reduce your altitude! Rush forward! Increase speed!\" Feng Wu clenched her fists tightly.Ten kilometers, five kilometers, three\u2026\u2026that waterfall over the overhanging cliff will be appearing soon!Right at this moment, suddenly, the Flaming Cloud Hawk lifted Feng Wu out of its right ear, holding her in the palm of its talon.Feng Wu saw the saliva drip, drip, dripping down, alarming her as she shouted. \"What are you doing?\"The Flaming Cloud Hawk lifted up its talon and directly threw Feng Wu into its own mouth!Very much like how a person usually tossed peanuts into their mouth!Feng Wu immediately felt disaster approaching!This bird hadn't even escaped while still being chased to be killed and it already wanted to go back on its promise with her!Feng Wu was so angry that she immediately fetched an incomparably hard mysterious bone fossil from her Dragon Phoenix Ring.At the same time, her body nimbly flipped and grabbed at the Flaming Cloud Hawk's nose, and directly jumped to the space above its forehead.Crrackk!A clear and loud sound!That bird's big mouth bit on the mysterious fossil that Feng Wu abandoned. At once, its mouthful of teeth nearly fell out!It was so upset it screamed one loud 'WAH'!The Flaming Cloud Hawk was so angry that it cursed. \"Are you human? How can you be so cunning!\"Feng Wu stood on top of the bird's head with both hands on her hips, so angry that she directly stomped her foot. \"You still shamelessly say that of me!

If I eat you, wouldn't I also grow a brain? If you were useless like you were in the past, would I even want to eat you? You're so skinny that you're a pile of bones, I'm even afraid of hurting my teeth!\"Feng Wu inhaled a deep breath.But she's still very angry as she harrumphed. \"Then how about you wait for Jun Lin Yuan to beat you to death! I'm not playing with you anymore!\"From the start, Feng Wu already planned an escape route and decided on the place she'd be leaving to.At the moment, she purposefully picked a fight with the Flaming Cloud Hawk, so that she could draw its attention.Right at this time, Feng Wu turned and looked around.She saw that dark eyed, ice-cold, black robed young man, his face brimming with killing intent!His footsteps were extremely light, quick and slender body leaped high up, and suddenly skimmed over in midair.Heaven Slaying Sword flew as it chopped down!Ice-cold killing intent wreaked havoc as it burst forth, engulfing everything as it approached, vertically chopped at the Flaming Cloud Hawk's enormous wing that seemed like it could shade a mountain!Feng Wu knew that after this exchange, this silly, stupid bird was going to be done for.Five hundred meters\u2026\u2026three hundred meters\u2026\u2026one hundred meters\u2026\u2026however, at present, Feng Wu's distance from the waterfall over the cliff reaching to the clouds was not far!After she calculated the height to the ground once more, the wind speed and direction, the speed of the drop and other related factors, Feng Wu finally spit out a mouthful of impure air, as her body jumped and front flipped towards the waterfall over the cliff!When she was doing the somersault previously, she passed before the Flaming Cloud Hawk's eyes, Feng Wu even leisurely waved at it.The Flaming Cloud Hawk stared blankly.Right at the time Feng Wu was leaping, Jun Lin Yuan's Heaven Slaying Sword was already chopping down from the sky.The hawk's silhouette that was has huge as a mountain, its wing hanging in the clouds was unexpectedly directly cut off!\"Oww! ! !\" The Flaming Cloud Hawk's painful and fierce appearance faced upwards as it roared mournfully.Its right wing shattered to pieces, fresh blood splattered.Its enormous body violently raged in midair, shaking like a leaf!Jun Lin Yuan saw a person's figure jumped and rolled out from the Flaming Cloud Hawk's right ear and vertically dived down.He didn't care about an insignificant person's life and death at all.Just when his sights opened up, out of the corner of his eye, he glimpsed at that quick and agile figure, both hands wrapped around her legs, her body rolled into a ball \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-Afterwards, her posture tilted at an angle to enter the waterfall over the cliff, that contact reduced part of the force of the impact.Right after that, her body curled into a ball headed downwards with the help of the waterfall's force!Finally, she rolled straight down close to the waves at the bottom of the pond.Jun Lin Yuan's eyes were used to being ice-cold and apathetic, appearing serene and deep, a handsome silhouette, yet a slight surprise streaked within that countenance hidden in depth.Jumping out of the hawk's ear, falling from a high altitude, perfectly entering the cliff, following the stream of water down.All of these things involved too many factors, elevation, wind speed, wind direction, gravity, force of impact, the cliff's angle, and also the uncontrollable Flaming Cloud Hawk\u2026\u2026 any slightest amount of miscalculation could result in all efforts ending up for naught.He never thought that an ordinary girl without any spirit qi would unexpectedly dare to do this, which was a bit interesting.However, Jun Lin Yuan also merely felt that Feng Wu was a little interesting, that's all. He certainly didn't have any superfluous thought of saving her life.If he knew that in the future he'd love her that much, Crown Prince Jun Lin Yuan absolutely wouldn't have looked on while her life was in danger, but at the moment, they way he viewed Feng Wu\u2026\u2026was truly just like looking through air.Feng Wu was battered by the majestic stream of water falling down from the high cliff!Ultimately, she fell vertically down into the deep pool!Thump!Feng Wu accurately calculated everything, yet didn't figure that there was a huge rock at the bottom of the pool.That's why after her body fell straight into the bottom of the pool, her forehead directly struck the rock with a loud 'thump'.OW!Current Schedule: 5 regular happy dose a weekCan't wait for your next dose?

    "Chapter 13": "Chapter 13: Destiny's CoincidenceFeng Wu covered her forehead with her hand, hurting so much that tears almost gushed forth.However, Feng Wu didn't have time for tears, because there was an astonishingly powerful whirlpool at the river's bottom, trying to suck her into it.How could Feng Wu so easily allow herself to lose the life she preserved with so much difficulty?She pieced together all of the strength left in her body to swim towards the surface!At last, just before her strength was exhausted, she eventually was able to grab a withered round tree branch. She turned over to sprawl on top of the tree branch, gasping for breath, no longer wanting to move at all.If this was the body she used to have, what would this amount to? However, her condition at present\u2026\u2026Feng Wu laughed bitterly as the corners of her mouth pulled upward. The series of actions just now nearly depleted all of her available strength.Fortunately, even though she temporarily didn't possess any spirit force, her special agent's instincts weren't lost, allowing her to sufficiently preserve herself.Lying down on top of the floating wood branch, Feng Wu rested for awhile. After some of her strength had been restored, she then started to take measure of her surroundings.This was Icebound Forest's east quadrant, Feng Wu was still quite familiar with this area.Originally, for the sake of the Immortal Spirit Fruit, Feng Wu had entered Icebound Forest many times. In addition, she'd studied countless numbers of maps, that's why she knew that at a not very distant place up ahead was Icebound Great Canyon.Icebound Great Canyon contained a cold poison. Her current body wouldn't be able to resist it, therefore, she'd need to first climb ashore before thinking about it again.At the bend, Feng Wu looked for an opportunity. Nimbly, her body dived into the large river, sparing no effort to swim for the shore.Because the distance to the waterfall wasn't far, the water flowed rapidly. Also because it's flowing perpendicularly, Feng Wu was almost flushed away quite a few times.Feng Wu bitterly focused on swimming before her strength became exhausted and eventually climbed up the bank. It's just that at the moment, she was gasping for breath and her complexion turned pale.She looked up to survey her surroundings.And only saw flowers everywhere, brightly colored, their fragrance pervading the air\u2026\u2026This was\u2026\u2026The map in Feng Wu's brain woosh woosh woosh flipped over. Very quickly, she targeted an area of the map. Her complexion also consequently became even paler.This was the giant Horned Blood Bee's territory!How could she be so unlucky, to have charged in here? !Icebound Forest was dangerous everywhere, but this was the most dangerous location within the four regions!Feng Wu previously already saw with her own eyes that after a troop of people entered here, within a minute, they were bitten and devoured into a big pile of bones. Their condition was terribly frightening!It was a shockingly ghastly sight!There was a queen bee within the hive of Horned Blood Bees. Feng Wu had always wanted to possess her, because refining her into a Nine Reversal Spirit Pill would allow its effectiveness to double. However\u2026\u2026thinking about that big swarm of densely packed giant Horned Blood Bees, Feng Wu subconsciously shook her head.It's still better for her to replace it with white jade. In regards to the Horned Blood Bee's queen bee, she really couldn't afford to provoke it.Because she didn't want to alert this swarm of terrifying giant Horned Blood Bees, Feng Wu prepared to suppress her presence, as she noiselessly left this area.As a matter of fact, while she was doing this, from a not distant place came the buzzing sounds of the Horned Blood Bees. Feng Wu hid behind a huge tree trunk and raised her head to take a quick look.She saw a red robed silhouette!Eh!There's someone there?Moreover, even wearing a red robe? !This person's guts was really not small!Feng Wu's hands quickly moved to climb up the big tree. A few moments later, she leaped to the summit of the tree and looked down at her surroundings. This one glance made delight abruptly emerge on the tips of her brows!Because she saw a red gowned silhouette up ahead at a place not far away, which attracted the attention of the majority of the Horned Blood Bees!Current Schedule: 5 regular happy dose a weekCan't wait for your next dose?

    "Chapter 14": "Chapter 14: The Depths of her Heart Was CollapsingWhat made Feng Wu even more surprised was that the giant Horned Blood Bees actually converged at that not so distant place!Feng Wu's originally extinguished hope instantly re-ignited again, flames reborn and raged in her heart!Ah, the giant Horned Blood Bee's queen bee\u2026\u2026right now, there's no one guarding her!Feng Wu understood very clearly that this was opportunity knocking. If this chance passed by, there wouldn't be another one!\"Danger comes with treasure.\" Feng Wu immediately made her decision, this queen bee was going to be hers!Feng Wu's body was as agile as a small leopard as she danced between the tree branches. Even though she hadn't cultivated spirit force, her body's basic essence was still the same. That's why, within a short time, she spiraled to the side of the beehive.While Feng Wu was moving previously, she tied some branches together. So that when she stood in front of the beehive, there was already a hook-shaped wood tool in her hand!No sooner said than done.The long hook entered the beehive!In the next second, a sharp, ear-piercing blood-curdling screech sounded, pervading heaven and earth!It's the the sound of the giant Horned Blood Bee's queen bee summoning her people!Feng Wu didn't have time to think much as she threw the queen be into her Dragon Phoenix Ring's domain. At the same time, her body exploded lightning quick as it rushed forth into another direction.Feng Wu held her breath with rapt attention, her footsteps moving lightly, like a cat in the jungle running rapidly.Quickly, quickly, very quickly, she'd be able to leave the Horned Blood Bee's territory.Right at the moment Feng Wu almost heaved a sigh of relief, suddenly, a braggart's voice sounded right behind her.\"Eh? Little girl, you're here, too? Isn't this too coincidental!\"This voice seemed to be very familiar.Feng Wu subconsciously turned her head around, and saw him with a glance, Feng Xun. The young man's defined silhouette, delicate and handsome, facial appearance glowing with health and vigor, his cordial and carefree smiling expression was warm like the noonday sun, lifting people's mood when they see it.However, at the moment, Feng Wu really found it difficult to smile.Behind Feng Xun was a swarm of densely packed Horned Blood Bees, as far as the eye can see, thousands and tens of thousands, a dense swarming cloud!That buzzing sound came from behind him.So it turned out that the person who attracted the swarm of Horned Blood Bees earlier was Feng Xun!She avoided that swarm with great difficulty as she secretly stole their queen bee\u2026\u2026yet Feng Xun unexpectedly brought along this big swarm of Horned Blood Bees!They'd be able to detect the queen bee's fragrance on her body.Thinking of this, Feng Wu's face instantly turned green!She pretended to not recognize Feng Xun, and with a speed akin to flying, she continued to rush forward.Don't come over here, don't come over, I'm begging you a thousand times, don't come over here, brother ~ Feng Wu loudly shouted in her heart, hoping that Feng Xun could hear the loud entreaties in her heart.However, Feng Xun didn't have any empathic nor telepathic connection with her as he rushed towards her brimming with enthusiasm while he brought the huge swarm of Horned Blood Bees to her. \"Young girl, so it turns out that you haven't died? I even thought that you're dead.\"Feng Wu deadpanned: \"\u2026\u2026\"How would she dare to stop? At once, she frantically let loose her pace as she ran!Feng Xun shouted behind Feng Wu. \"Young girl, why're you running, wait for me!\"While he was yelling, he even extended his hand to grab Feng Wu.And at this moment, that swarm of bees behind Feng Xun suddenly sank into a crazy frenzy, the entire swarm was endlessly agitated, as it buzzed and hummed constantly.The huge swarm of bees which originally circled around Feng Xun now, without exception, ferociously changed its direction towards Feng Wu!Feng Wu's hairs instantly stood on ends!Oh no\u2026\u2026stealing the queen bee had definitely been discovered!Everything, had, come, to, naught!Thinking to this point, Feng Wu was so angry that she glared at Feng Xun.Feng Xun was unable to make heads or tails of Feng Wu's glare. \"What's up? Are your eyes feeling unwell? Are the muscles twitching?\"Twitch? This woman even wants to thrash you!The depths of Feng Wu's heart was collapsing. It was originally possible for her to escape. If only she wasn't dragged back by Feng Xun\u2026\u2026.Current Schedule: 5 regular happy dose a weekCan't wait for your next dose?

    "Chapter 15": "Chapter 15: Let Go of Me!\"Hurry and let go of me!\" The back of her collar was grabbed. Feng Wu brandished both hands, as if she was splashing in the water.Feng Xun's handsome, clear and bright face appeared helpless. \"Young girl, what are you worried about? These giant Horned Blood Bees aren't stupid. They've chased after me for half a day now, yet they haven't bit me.\"Feng Wu was weeping in the depths of her heart. They naturally wouldn't bite you. They'd die if they bit you, OK? But the problem right now was that she'd stolen their queen bee, and the queen bee's unique smell had been detected. It'd be strange if they didn't go into a frenzy!\"Eh? That's strange, why are they all circling around you, they're even frantically targeting you!\" Feng Xun felt that something's strange.Feng Wu glared at him irritably. Brother, did you finally discover this now?\"Ah!\" Feng Wu lost her concentration for a second and got stung by a giant Horned Blood Bee. It hurt so much, she painfully let out a sound.Feng Xun anxiously pat his own forehead. \"It's my fault, all my fault. If it wasn't for me dragging you back, you would've escaped previously. Looking at your constitution, it would seem that the giant Horned Blood Bees find you appetizing?\"How could Feng Wu dare to expose that she'd stolen their queen bee? Therefore, she did her best to nod, mm hm, mm, mm.Feng Wu herself didn't know, that her innocent appearance really looked extremely adorable.Feng Xun's face was full of self blame, as he picked Feng Wu off the ground and in the next split second, his body already rushed outward like a shooting star.When Feng Xun became serious, his speed was practically as fast as the wind, or a streak of lightning.He ran for approximately the amount of time it took to burn a stick of incense before he finally stopped. He then lowered Feng Wu to the ground. \"It's alright now. Those giant Horned Blood Bees won't be able to chase us, you don't need to worry. If I say it's fine, then it's fine.\"Feng Wu couldn't help but take another look at Feng Xun. She didn't expect that after separating for five years, Feng Xun's strength would've increased so much. If her phoenix blood wasn't destroyed by Zuo Qing Yun five years ago, right now, would she\u2026\u2026Feng Wu promptly dispelled any fantasy from her mind, keeping herself from thinking about such distracting thoughts.On account of wanting to know Jun Lin Yuan's real purpose in entering Icebound Forest, she asked probingly. \"There's danger everywhere within Icebound Forest, I just escaped from one calamity, should we leave?\"This was Feng Wu's way of retreating in order to advance. Indeed, the result was good.Feng Xun looked at Feng Wu incomprehensibly. \"Leave? Us brothers travelled a long distance from the capital to Icebound Forest. We haven't yet acquired what we seek. How can we leave?\"Feng Wu's heart palpitated!As expected!They said the crown prince came to patrol the border. This was but an excuse. His true objective was Icebound Forest!Feng Wu secretly clenched her teeth, feigning inquisitiveness on her face, a face filled with innocence, as she continued to probe. \"You rushed over from the imperial capital far away? What are you guys looking for within Icebound Forest? Actually, I've seen many maps of Icebound Forest. Maybe I might just happen to know where the thing you want to look for is.\"Having heard what was said, Feng Xun laughed in a clear voice. \"Oh my, young girl, you really like to joke. The thing we want to find is something you definitely don't know the location of. It's a treasure inside Icebound Forest!\"Treasure? There were very few things which could be considered treasures inside of Icebound Forest\u2026\u2026the Immortal Spirit Fruit was one of them!A bad premonition appeared in Feng Wu's heart.Feng Wu prepared to ask further, when suddenly, an ice-cold voice transmitted from a short distance away. \"Third Feng, you're actually so idle.\"As soon as the words stopped, a blue robed youngster holding a sword in both hands dropped from the sky.The young man's facial features were hidden in depth, the sleeves of his robe fluttered in the breeze, a slender figure, arrogant and proud, coldness permeated from his entire body.Current Schedule: 5 regular happy dose a weekCan't wait for your next dose?

    "Chapter 16": "Chapter 16: Did You Bring Your Brains? !What was special was that pair of eyes that resembled the cold edge of an unsheathed blade, penetratingly sharp, a formidable aura, second only to Jun Lin Yuan.\"Oh my, Second Xuan? !\" Feng Wu patted this blue robed youngster's shoulder.During her childhood, Feng Wu lived at the imperial capital. Even though it's been five years, however, when she left that year, these youngsters before her were already more than ten years old. That's why she could recognize them at a glance.Xuan Yi, Xuan family's second young master, one of Jun Lin Yuan's childhood friends. As a child, his face was already solemn, akin to a stiff wood plank. She didn't expect that after he grew up, he became even more severe and reserved.This pair of Xuan Yi's penetrating and bitingly cold eyes examined Feng Wu closely for a second as he wrinkled his handsome sword shaped eyebrows. \"Who's she?\"\"This is a young girl I just saved. That's right, young girl, what's your name? Also, he's \u2014\u2014\u2014\" Feng Xun was an enthusiastic and cheerful good hearted young man, but Xuan Yi certainly wasn't.\"Little Fifth Feng*\u2014\u2014-\" Feng Wu was just about to introduce herself.(*TN: 'Fifth Feng' means 'fifth wind', which is also pronounced the same way as 'Feng Wu', but means Phoenix Dance/Dancing. Feng Xun's last name 'Feng' also means 'wind'.)Xuan Yi icily arrogantly raised his hand to interrupt, his voice cold and indifferent. \"I don't have any interest in knowing who she is, it's time, let's go.\"This temper of Xuan Yi's was indeed the same as it was in the past, not showing any mercy. Feng Wu sighed in her heart.Feng Xun angrily glared at Xuan Yi and coldly harrumphed as he pulled Feng Wu and responded. \"I really can't stand his personality. Let's go together.\"Xuan Yi stopped after taking two steps and frowned as he turned his head around, his gaze cut like a knife as it swept over Feng Wu's body.Feng Wu could feel Xuan Yi's gaze fix on her radiating quite an impressive aura. It was clear that this was a warning for her to quickly take a hike.Feng Wu coldly humphed in her heart. He seemed to think that she liked to be with them so much. If it wasn't for Feng Xun having carried her over in his arms, she definitely wouldn't have wanted to stay with them by any means!Thinking to this point, Feng Wu proudly cupped her fist in her other hand and spoke to Feng Xun. \"Third Brother Feng*, good things don't last forever, let's separate at this point, see you later.\"(*TN: Chinese people call each other brothers out of respect. It doesn't necessarily mean they're related.)Having spoken, Feng Wu passed him and was just about to leave.Feng Xun reached out to detain Feng Wu. \"This place is already near the center of Icebound Forest. You don't possess any spirit qi inside your body, how can you leave? I also don't have time to send you out. You shouldn't go anywhere. Little Fifth, just follow me, it's fine!\"Xuan Yi didn't pay any attention to Feng Xun as his pair of ice-cold eyes directly fixed on Feng Wu. \"Will you choose to leave on your own, or should I send you out?\"The implication was that he'd send Feng Wu away with a kick from his foot!\"\"Xuan Yi!\" Feng Xun was quite angry, his eyes full of fury. \"Aren't you being too unreasonable? She isn't a bad person. In fact, she's the one who's been quite unlucky. At first, she was implicated by Boss Jun when she's captured by the Flaming Cloud Hawk. After that, she was again led by me into trouble and was almost bitten to death by Horned Blood Bees. With great difficulty, her life is now safe, yet you want to kick her away! !\"\"Whether she's a good person or bad person, does that have anything to do with me?\" Second Xuan stared at Feng Xun, his gaze as sharp as a knife's edge as cold air burst forth. \"Did you forget about Boss Jun's character?\"That person indeed was a lord no stranger could approach, a face fierce with self control, causing everyone to keep quiet out of fear.Moreover, he was strict both on the inside and the outside!Feng Xun was fuming as he bit on his lower lip!Xuan Yi continued. \"What's more, our assignment this time is so important, what if she's a spy?\"Feng Xun was nearly angered into laughter. \"Do you really feel that this girl who doesn't even have the strength to defend herself can snatch away the Immortal Spirit Fruit from us? !\"\"Young, Third, Feng!\" Xuan Yi was truly angry!

    "Chapter 17": "Chapter 17: You're Not Dead?Feng Xun considered Feng Wu to be one of his own people, but Xuan Yi certainly did not. On the contrary, he clearly treated Feng Wu as someone to eliminate.Feng Wu already could no longer stand Xuan Yi's hostility. Right now, her brain was only filled with thoughts of the Immortal Spirit Fruit! Only after the Immortal Spirit Fruit had been refined into medication could she start to cultivate again and reach the pinnacle of strength!Originally, Feng Wu was even laughing coldly inside. You guys won't let me follow you. Heh, it's not like I'd be happy to follow you!But now she'd changed her mind.Based on Jun Lin Yuan's intelligence and wisdom and also his cultivation, in addition to the young companions helping him, their probability of being able to obtain the Immortal Spirit Fruit was ninety percent, if not a hundred percent.If she left like this, it's very possible that she won't have another opportunity to obtain an Immortal Spirit Fruit in this lifetime. In that case, she could only be a mediocre Feng Wu all of her life, bullied by others, despised by others.Would she be willing? No way!That's why, she must follow these people and play it by ear! Seize any opportunity to obtain the Immortal Spirit Fruit! No matter what happened, this time, she must follow them!\"Arguing again?\"In the midst of this awkward atmosphere, a cold voice spoke.\"Boss Jun!\" Feng Xun saw the young man descending from the air. His eyes instantly shined. Running and hopping vivaciously as he rushed over.Feng Wu also subconsciously turned to that direction.The young man's exceptionally meticulous appearance, a charming, godlike body, a unique temperament.His aura was extremely powerful. The moment he appeared, he unconditionally commanded the leading position. Everything around him was eclipsed by his splendor and radiance.Behind him, a ramrod straight figure followed, his silhouette was like an unsheathed cutlass, a profound middle aged butler. However, because of Jun Lin Yuan's powerful aura, he was practically ignored.It's unknown when Jun Lin Yuan had arrived. It's also unknown how much he'd heard.Feng Xun waited anxiously as he turned to Jun Lin Yuan. \"Boss Jun, Little Fifth Feng* was trapped by you into Icebound Forest, then was taken by me again into Icebound Forest's interior. Right now, there's simply so way she could survive in Icebound Forest by herself, so she won't be able to leave. How about we bring her along? !\"(*TN: Feng Xun took Feng Wu to have the same last name as his, the Feng (\u98ce) which means 'wind', rather than the Feng (\u51e4) which means 'phoenix'.)Xuan Yi sneered as he held onto his sword. Young Third Feng was bound to be disappointed. What kind of person was their Boss Jun? An unfeeling, heartless person who wouldn't take another glance at other people dying in front of him. Hoping that he could arouse some sympathy? Simply ridiculous!Jun Lin Yuan's bitingly cold pair of eyes shot a glance at Feng Wu. \"You're not dead?\"Leaping out of the Flaming Cloud Hawk's ear and diving into the cliff, followed by charging into the deep pond, all of these motions were performed smoothly and naturally. Jun Lin Yuan couldn't help but have a deep impression of her.Feng Wu inhaled deeply!Sure enough, Jun Lin Yuan did see her previously. He merely chose to be completely indifferent to her existence, that's all.Feng Wu knew, if at this time, she coldly laughed in a way that conveyed 'you seemed to hope that I'd died', Jun Lin Yuan absolutely wouldn't show any mercy as he threw her out. What did your life or death have anything to do with me?That's why, she couldn't let her emotions affect her decisions! For the sake of the Immortal Spirit Fruit, she had better let feelings pass when she could!Feng Wu breathed in a big mouthful of air, as she squeezed out a smiling expression on her face. \"This is exactly what's called 'bound for good fortune after surviving a great disaster', I believe that my luck will be very good after this.\"Jun Lin Yuan's pair of bitingly cold, soul stirring eyes fixed on Feng Wu as if examining her from head to toe.His gaze was serene and hidden in depth like an unsheathed sword, making people shudder.The more Jun Lin Yuan was silent, the more the surrounding atmosphere became grave.Xuan Yi smiled coldly. He knew it. It's impossible for Boss Jun to allow them to bring an outsider along.Right when Feng Xun thought that the matter was hopeless, Jun Lin Yuan actually creased his dense eyebrows, and turned to Feng Xun to say indifferently. \"You're responsible for the people you bring along.\"Current Schedule: 5 regular happy dose a weekCan't wait for your next dose?

Oh my god! ! !\"\"It's best you don't bring her.\" Jun Lin Yuan suggested extremely seriously.Xuan Yi, who's always been labeled as being aloof, at this moment, was staring with eyes wide open!This couldn't be right!How could Boss Jun have agreed? This wasn't his usual way of handling things! He subconsciously glanced at Jun Lin Yuan.\"That won't do! The young girl is someone I'm protecting!\" Feng Xun complacently answered. \"I'm Third Young Feng, she's Little Fifth Feng, if I don't take care of her, who's going to take care of her?\"Jun Lin Yuan didn't pay anymore attention to the joyfully satisfied Feng Xun, as his gaze turned to Xuan Yi.Without any unnecessary words, Xuan Yi immediately thoroughly understood. \"We've already looked into it carefully, the Immortal Spirit Fruit grew in Mysterious Iceberg Valley. It's just that we need to look further to find the exact location.\"Feng Wu's heartbeat speeded up instantly!Mysterious Iceberg Valley\u2026\u2026that's correct! The Immortal Spirit Fruit was precisely located in that area!Immortal Spirit Fruit, her Immortal Spirit Fruit! As long as she could obtain the Immortal Spirit Fruit, she would be able to cultivate again. She would no longer be a crippled Feng Wu!On this continent where martial ability was regarded with respect, strength represented everything! Thinking to this point, Feng Wu clenched her fists firmly.Jun Lin Yuan nodded indifferently, and immediately led his companions to start on their journey.In order to reach Mysterious Iceberg Valley, they needed to go through Flaming Mountain Ridge. Everyone's speed was very quick on this journey.Streams, forests, mountain peaks\u2026\u2026were unable to hinder their fast, forward moving footsteps.Along the journey, Feng Xun looked after Feng Wu from time to time. \"Young girl, are you really doing ok?\"In terms of their team, only Feng Wu didn't possess spirit force and could only count on her physical stamina to support her.Feng Wu stared at Jun Lin Yuan and Xuan Yi's cold and aloof backs as she squeezed out a sweet smiling expression on her face. \"There's naturally no problem, what kind of problem can there be? My body's quite strong.\"Feng Xun saw that her complexion was pale, but because she's afraid of being abandoned, she pretended to be strong and optimistic. He couldn't help but feel sorry for her. \"How about letting me carry you on my back?\"Feng Wu hadn't replied when at the front, Xuan Yi suddenly turned around. \"If you're unable to persevere, then quickly get out of here and avoid implicating the entire group.\"Xuan Yi fixed his gaze on Feng Wu, his voice cold and detached. \"Especially as we move forward, there'll be stronger demonic beasts. At that time, even if you wanted to run, you wouldn't be able to run!\"Feng Xun glared at Xuan Yi. \"I say, Young Second Xuan, even if this is a fact, can't you speak more tactfully?\"Feng Wu. \"\u2026\u2026\"Xuan Yi harrumphed coldly, and, without consulting anyone, moved to the front to walk alongside Jun Lin Yuan.Feng Xun saw Feng Wu's head hanging low and thought that she felt hurt, so he rubbed her little head. \"Young girl, don't worry, Young Second Xuan is like this. Just don't pay any heed to him. Isn't there still me? Come, let older brother carry you.\"Feng Xun saw how Feng Wu had been unlucky all along so he sympathized and felt sorry for her. He couldn't help taking care of her a bit more.Yet Feng Wu didn't mind.An indifferent attitude, the malicious tongue, what did they matter?As long as she could obtain the Immortal Spirit Fruit, as long as she could cultivate again, these things didn't count as much.Thinking up to this point, Feng Wu then rather guiltily glanced at Feng Xun.Feng Xun treated her well sincerely, yet she was taking advantage of his kindness to get close to their team\u2026\u2026she only hoped that in the future, she wouldn't cause any harm to this utterly sincere, optimistic, sunshiny young man.Thinking up to this point, Feng Wu smiled bitterly as she shook her head. \"You don't need to treat me so well\u2026\u2026\"\"Silly girl, if I don't treat you well, don't tell me I should treat Young Second Xuan well? Speaking of which, you truly have no luck.\" Feng Xun rubbed Feng Wu's head for a bit.This group didn't rest along the way for Feng Wu's sake at all.

    "Chapter 19": "Chapter 19: Strong Little GirlFeng Wu watched the scene before her, suddenly, it became bright in front of her.The sky was dark blue, birds flew by in flocks.The terrain was level before her, an inviting green grass meadow, the lawn seemed soft and cozy, like a patch of expansive, boundless green carpet. A small brook flowed gently and sluggishly passing through the meadow.On the light green colored turf, a fine and soft simple wool rug was spread out, noble and refined, with even a nomadic flavour.On top of the thick wool carpet, a classic wood dining table was arranged, simple yet elegant, however, looking at the wood, one could tell that it's extremely valuable.On top of the dining table, delicate placemats and tableware were arranged.White jade chinaware, amber colored goblets, also silverware, the metals were so polished they shined, clean and brilliant, with one look one could tell that these regularly used tableware were maintained extremely meticulously.In the middle of the meadow was an old tree so wide three people together couldn't wrap their arms around it. The ancient tree stood perfectly straight upward, thick and solid, with branches extending over the overhanging cliff.Yet these branches extending over the cliff were the very ones which supported a small cabin. Looking from the distance, it was shrouded in mist, a vague immortal aura, seemed as if it floated in the air, giving people a kind of simple and unadorned, yet elegant and also mysterious feeling.Feng Wu's heart was instantly taken back!How was this a countryside lodge? It clearly was a scenic spot in an old forest deep in the mountains to spend one's vacation.To think that she passed by Icebound Forest everyday, yet on which occasion was she not in mortal danger, cutting a sorry figure, battered about, fleeing from the east to the west side?Then seeing how the days passed for somebody else. How meticulous. How respected.Right at this time, a mild colored silhouette emerged from behind the ancient tree.Feng Wu's gaze paused. It's the man who previously followed by Jun Lin Yuan's side, yet disappeared half way through, Butler Feng*?(*TN: The Butler Feng's (\u5c01) last name means 'grant', which is written differently than Feng (\u98ce) Xun and Feng (\u51e4) Wu's last name, which means 'wind' and 'phoenix', respectively. All three 'Feng's are pronounced exactly the same way in Chinese.)Feng Xun was used to being cheerful and enthusiastic. He raised his hand to greet the butler. \"Butler Feng, this journey has been so tiring. Fortunately, you've set out in advance to make arrangements, otherwise, we'll be eating air and sleeping outdoors.\"Butler Feng was graceful and noble as he nodded to Feng Xun, while a white hot towel was handed to Jun Lin Yuan.Right at this time, Feng Xun undoubtedly saw the way Feng Wu walked with a limp. His eyebrows creased at once as he patted the chair next to him. \"Hurry and sit down.\"Feng Wu shook her head in refusal.However, at the next second, Feng Xun already pressed her into the chair.Feng Xun half kneeled by Feng Wu's feet, raised his hand and was going to take off Feng Wu's black calf leather boots. \"I've seen the way you limped, you must be injured. Take off your boots, and I'll look at the wound for you.\"However, as his hand moved, Feng Wu screamed 'ouch' at once, tears almost gushed out! So painful!So severe? ! Feng Xun hurriedly stayed his hand as his eyebrows furrowed and reproachfully glared at Feng Wu. \"Why didn't you say that you've been injured? Why insist on enduring on your own? How painful this must be!\"It was clear that this was caused by blood from the soles of her feet which moistened the bottom of her boots. After the blood dried, her foot stuck to her boot and could no longer be separated.Feng Wu shot a glance at Jun Lin Yuan.For the sake of the Immortal Spirit Fruit, right now, she's doing all she can to stay close to this team. She certainly didn't want to lag behind due to not having sufficient physical strength.At present, Jun Lin Yuan was also facing Feng Wu. Two people and four eyes faced her.Feng Wu felt somewhat anxious, yet Jun Lin Yuan seemed as if he didn't see her, as his gaze moved from her face and played across the sky and landscape without a trace.Feng Wu's heart shivered, he shouldn't unhappily want to kick her out, right?Thereupon, Feng Wu hurriedly restrained Feng Xun's hand. \"I'm fine. I'm fine, really, don't worry about me.\"How could Feng Xun not care about Feng Wu? How unlucky was this girl? From the moment he saw her until now, he hadn't seen the tiniest bit of good luck come to her. She's already so wounded, yet still told others not to care about her, how strong did she need to be?Current Schedule: 5 regular happy dose a weekCan't wait for your next dose?

    "Chapter 20": "Chapter 20: Sim, ply, Laugh, able!Thereupon Feng Xun turned around. \"Butler Feng, Butler Feng!\"Ever since he was young, Butler Feng had attended to Jun Lin Yuan's predecessor******when Jun Lin Yuan was born, he retired from his office as the chief steward and had accompanied Jun Lin Yuan since then. That's why these few companions were very familiar with Butler Feng.No one knew what Butler Feng's cultivation was, because no one had ever seen him make a move.No one dared to provoke Butler Feng, because those people who'd provoked Butler Feng before were already dead.Butler Feng slowly walked over and brought hot water and herbal plasters at the same time.After the blood had dried on the soles of her feet, the leather boots adhered to it. If they forcefully pulled her foot out then opening new flesh wounds would be inevitable.Originally, Feng Xun wanted to cut off her boots, but he was firmly rejected by Feng Wu.That's why Feng Xun could only first use hot water to wash over Feng Wu's small boots. When the hot water seeped in, he could clearly perceive Feng Wu brows tensing up.\"It won't hurt, it won't hurt, it'll be better in a moment. But if the wounds on your feet aren't properly treated, you won't be able to get on the road tomorrow.\" Feng Xun was like a young older brother as he coaxed Feng Wu.After he waited for the hot water to soak through, Feng Xun then gently and cautiously removed the cloths wrapped around Feng Wu's feet from within her boots with difficulty.Because of the swelling, he almost couldn't remove them.When Feng Wu's feet came out of her boots, the complexion of everyone at the scene became somewhat unsightly.That pair of feet was drenched in blood and was utterly swollen. They looked especially\u2026\u2026ghastly.Feng Xun immediately felt his heart ache.Yet Xuan Yi knit his brows. \"If it's like this, how can she walk tomorrow? How about we leave her behind?\"At this kind of moment, he could still talk like that?Feng Xun turned his head around to glare at Xuan Yi. \"Young Second Xuan!\"\"What?\"\"Raise your right hand, touch your conscience, and tell me if it aches or not?\"Xuan Yi: \"\u2026\u2026..I don't feel like talking to you, I'm going hunting!\"From start to finish, besides taking a glance at Feng Wu and furrowing his brows a bit, Jun Lin Yuan didn't have any other additional expression at all.Feng Xun very carefully applied medicine for Feng Wu's sake. After he finished, he warned her to obediently sit still on the chair and not to move randomly.And at this time, Xuan Yi returned carrying a Hooting Blood Elk. There was even a cute young lady who looked just like an elk following behind him.\"Fairy Mu Yao?\" Feng Xun saw the young lady behind Xuan Yi, and uttered at once. He stared at Xuan Yi. \"Why did you bring her back? !\"How could Feng Xun not know Fairy Mu Yao? When they were at Gathering Cloud Pavillion previously, Fairy Mu Yao was also present. Even though she was wearing a hat with a veil which covered up more than half of her countenance, she was still unable to escape Feng Xun's experienced, discerning eyes.Xuan Yi brought the Hooting Blood Elk and dropped it in front of Butler Feng, then shot a glance at Feng Xun. \"If you're allowed to bring a young girl, why can't I?\"Feng Xun felt stifled and choked on air as he pointed at Xuan Yi. \"You you you, you come here!\"Feng Xun dragged Xuan Yi to an unoccupied corner, lowered his voice, and spoke with clenched teeth. \"Xuan Yi, are you insane? What kind of person is Fairy Mu Yao? She's a girl who actually always admired Boss Jun. Don't you know that Boss Jun dislikes this kind of women the most? ! Yet you still brought her back? !\"Xuan Yi also did it for lack of a better option. \"When I was hunting the Hooting Blood Elk, I accidentally injured her, moreover, she is my cousin, we're blood related.\"Feng Xun sucked in a mouthful of air. \"\u2026\u2026you brought her, you take responsibility!\"While Xuan Yi and Feng Xun were muttering by the side, Fairy Mu Yao's gaze already fell on Feng Wu's body.Because she'd seen her previously at Gathering Cloud Pavillion, Fairy Mu Yao had a very deep impression of Feng Wu. This young girl looks ordinary, but her scheming was especially deep, pretending to be captured by the Flaming Cloud Hawk, thus relying on Jun Lin Yuan to be the hero saving a maiden, after which she had the justification to stay by his side!Did she think that she'd catch Jun Lin Yuan's eyes because of this?

    "Chapter 21": "Chapter 21: Zuo Qing Luan?Fairy Mu Yao's autumn eyes contemptuously swept over from Feng Wu's face, scanning her head to her feet, hardly concealing the look of malevolence in them.Jun Lin Yuan was cultivating inside the wood cabin. Butler Feng was busy with making dinner. Feng Xun and Xuan Yi were muttering by the side. No one paid attention to this area.Consequently, Fairy Mu Yao unhurriedly arrived before Feng Wu, stared at her from on high, lowered her voice and leaned close to her while speaking disdainfully. \"You're, really, ugly.\"Feng Wu was lost in thought thinking only about the Immortal Spirit Fruit and was woken up by Fairy Mu Yao's words. She dazedly turned towards this elegant looking young lady in front of her. \"Huh? What did you say?\"Fairy Mu Yao laughed coldly and lowered her provoking voice again. \"I said, you look very ugly! It's not your fault that you're ugly, however, scheming of giving your affections to someone who's uninterested is. This face of yours is not qualified to even be a servant girl by Jun Lin Yuan's side!\"\"Huh?\" Feng Wu was somewhat unable to respond.\"Ohh.\" Feng Wu finally slowly became aware what Fairy Mu Yao meant by her scheming to give her affections and sticking to an uninterested Jun Lin Yuan.Feng Wu subconsciously raised her hand and rubbed her own face.Before she left her house, Feng Wu used yellow waxy cosmetics to conceal her devastatingly beautiful appearance, altering the contours of her brows, eyes, and nose. Therefore she currently indeed looked the part of merely an ordinary, commonplace girl.Mu Yao was presently incensed by this response of Feng Wu's!She'd provoked her like this, yet the ugly girl surprisingly still didn't get angry? Did this girl have a brain or not?Just at this moment, Feng Xun's voice transmitted. \"What are you guys chatting about? How come I hear something about ugly and beautiful?\"Fairy Mu Yao saw Feng Xun and her attitude immediately made a 180 degrees turn. On that originally elegant complexion, a perfect, sweet smiling expression appeared instantly. \"Young Prince Feng, I was just saying that my Senior Martial Sister is very, very beautiful.\"Feng Xun harrumphed coldly and walked to sit down next to Feng Wu.Fairy Mu Yao lifted her head and glanced at the primary colored wood cabin, because Jun lin Yuan was residing not more than tens of meters away. As a result, amorous feelings rippled through her whole heart, and thought it'd be great if by speaking more, she could attract Jun Lin Yuan's attention.Thereupon, Fairy Mu Yao pulled out a chair and sat down in a familiar manner, then smilingly asked Feng Xun. \"Young Prince Feng, do you still remember my Senior Martial Sister?\"\"Zuo Qing Yun?\" Feng Xun asked without much thought.Fairy Mu Yao waved her hand. \"My Senior Martial Sister hates it the most when other people mentions her former name. Her current name is Zuo Qing Luan, emerald luan fire phoenix, the emerald luan that's the king of all birds.\"Nobody noticed Feng Wu sitting by the side resting her chin on her hands with her mind at the horizon, creasing her eyebrows at this moment, her body slightly stiffened.Zuo Qing Luan? How many years had it been since she heard this name mentioned?Feng Xun was apparently quite interested in Zuo Qing Luan as he asked. \"This name is actually quite domineering. Does her current strength compare with this name?\"Xuan Yi also pulled out a chair and sat opposite Fairy Mu Yao.Jun Lin Yuan also slowly walked out from the log cabin.Butler Feng waiting by the side had already pulled out a chair and waited until after Jun Lin Yuan took his place before he pushed the chair back in.After that, he began to serve the food, one plate after another.Once Jun Lin Yuan arrived, Fairy Mu Yao's attention was completely focused on Jun Lin Yuan, her deep black eyes stared at Jun Lin Yuan, as if her soul was sucked out and couldn't be shifted away.\"Cough cough \u2014\u2014\u2014-\" Feng Xun coughed softly a couple of times.Only then did Fairy Mu Yao's senses returned, a pink blush spread on her face as she awkwardly fiddled with a strand of hair bordering her forehead. \"What was I saying?\"\"Zuo Qing Luan?\"Current Schedule: 5 regular happy dose a weekCan't wait for your next dose?

    "Chapter 22": "Chapter 22: Mm Hm!\"Right! My Senior Martial Sister Zuo Qing Luan is quite powerful now!\" Fairy Mu Yao's eyes shined, containing a complacency derived from pride. \"She entered Jade Palace at the age of eight and joined the Spirit Expert ranks by the age of nine. At ten years old, she placed first on the Spirit Expert ranks, at eleven years old, she entered the Spirit Ancestor ranks and by twelve years old she obtained third place in the Spirit Ancestor ranks. Now, she's already thirteen years old and our princess had already said that my Senior Martial Sister could very well obtain first place in the Spirit Ancestor rankings this year!\"\"Wow, that's certainly incredible, she's actually the same level as some of us. Feng Xun admiringly said. \"She's going to be a top figure. Looks like we'll need to put in more effort, so that she won't pass us by one day.\"Fairy Mu Yao complacently raised her chin. \"My master said Senior Sister Zuo is the most perceptive, most gifted disciple among her disciples. Master even frequently lamented that it's a good thing the one she accepted that year was Senior Sister Zuo, and not the other person.\"\"The other person?\" Feng Xun was curious. \"Who?\"Fairy Mu Yao sneered. \"Who else can it be but Feng Wu? It's precisely the gifted young girl from the capital during that time. Now, she's North Border City's famous young cripple.\"Xuan Yi frowned as he glanced at Fairy Mu Yao.Fairy Mu Yao smiled again. \"I didn't grow up in the capital when I was younger, so I don't know, but didn't you guys grow up in the capital? Can it be that you weren't acquainted with Feng Wu at the time?\"\"How could we not be acquainted?\" Feng Xun wasn't happy as he said. \"Speaking of which, at that time, Feng Wu, that girl\u2026\u2026her rise was truly cut short. She was already a beauty at a very young age. That appearance was exquisite like she was carved out of fine jade, her skin looked better than cosmetics, it's as creamy as snow reflecting the sun, so beautiful! One couldn't help but want to kidnap her home to be their beloved younger sister!\"Feng Wu sitting by the side lowered her head, and silently scooped rice into her mouth.She didn't hear anything\u2026\u2026didn't her anything\u2026\u2026Who didn't talk about other people behind their backs? Who wasn't talked about by others behind their backs? But you people are gossiping about someone right in her face, was this truly gentlemanly? Fortunately, she was currently disguised as a common, ordinary girl, otherwise\u2026\u2026sigh.Feng Wu attempted to change the subject. \"The Hooting Blood Elk's roasted legs are especially flavorful, Butler Feng's skills are outstanding. You guys want a taste?\" After that, please don't continue to gossip about me, ok?However, the table full of people all ignored her as they continued to talk about Feng Wu in those days.Fairy Mu Yao was somewhat unhappy as she propped her chin in her hands. That pair of phoenix eyes* stared at Feng Wun. \"Was Feng Wu very beautiful as a child? Do you think that after she grew up, she's as beautiful as me?\"(* TN: phoenix eyes are eyes that slant upwards at the ends.)In regards to her appearance, Fairy Mu Yao was very confident about it. As Jade Palace's Holy Lady, her looks was second only to the goddess like Zuo Qing Luan. Other people could not compare to her.Feng Xun quickly scanned over Fairy Mu Yao as he raised his brows devoid of good opinions and asked. \"Do you really want to know?\"\"Mm hm! Please speak Young Prince, I want to hear the truth!\" Fairy Mu Yao requested seriously as her pair of watery sparkling eyes stared wide and round, looking expectantly for Feng Xun to compliment her.Feng Xun thought to himself, since you're not afraid to hear it, then I'd certainly tell it like it is. \"I don't know if Feng Wu's current appearance's been destroyed now. In any case, based on her complexion in those days, this appearance of yours, I'm afraid it's not even qualified to serve as her maid.\" While Feng Xun shook his head, he recalled what the young maid by Feng Wu's side at that time looked like. She was also quite pretty.\"You!\" Fairy Mu Yao had truly been, angered, now!She was so angry her eyes turned red and tears almost violently gushed forth.Feng Xun didn't know that it turns out that when girls want to cry, tears actually just flowed. He was actually frightened off. \"Hey! It's you who wanted me to tell the truth, so I told it as it is. I didn't lie to you. If you don't believe it, ask your cousin. Xuan Yi, don't you play dead. Why don't you speak up, when Feng Wu was a child, was she not very beautiful? That's right, Young Second Xuan, if I remembered correctly, at that time, you actually praised her. You said that when Little Feng Wu grows up, she'd surely be very beautiful, right?\"Feng Wu inhaled a deep mouthful of air. \"\u2026\u2026.\" These people, how could they love gossiping so much? How could the guy whose face was as stiff as a board since he was young say this kind of thing? This is simply\u2026\u2026\"Mm hm.\" Xuan Yi nodded his head.Author's note.

    "Chapter 23": "Chapter 23: The Young Genius Feng Wu\"Mm Hm.\" Yuan Yi nodded his head.Everyone momentarily became quiet, not a sound could be heard.Jun Lin Yuan was gracefully eating, as before, however, his eyes took a profound glance at Xuan Yi, his appearance uniquely charming and godly, frowning slightly.Fairy Mu Yao stared at Xuan Yi, wanting to cry, but had no tears. \"Even though Young Prince is bullying me, you're still my cousin, why would even you bully me boo hoo hoo\u2014\u2014\u2014-\"Feng Xun complacently raised his brows. \"You see? I wasn't wrong, right? Second Young Xuan actually complemented her before!\"Fairy Mu Yao was fuming with rage between gritted teeth, she turned her head panting with rage, and caught the silent Feng Wu off guard.Was Feng Wu ridiculing her? !Fairy Mu Yao glared at Feng Wu extremely angrily. \"What are you looking at! Even if I'm not as good looking as Feng Wu, I'm still a thousand times, ten thousand times better looking than you, you mud duck!\"Feng Wu was gnawing on a piece of beef bone in her mouth, and couldn't help but look at Fairy Mu Yao who suddenly flipped out on her, remaining silent and looking at the sky\u2026\u2026who did she provoke?Looking at Feng Wu's innocent appearance, Feng Xun unhappily glared at Fairy Mu Yao. \"You're attacking her personally? Even though my Little Fifth isn't that good-looking, she's kindhearted, pure and harmless, much more lovable than you.\"Feng Wu was embarrassed as she met Feng Xun's gaze.He sees her as being kindhearted, pure and harmless?She clearly was a wolf in sheep's clothing, a little thief currently waiting for an opportunity to take the Immortal Spirit Fruit from right under their noses.Fairy Mu Yao made a fist, that pampered face was so angry it turned red. \"Then what you mean to say is that I'm not kindhearted, I'm not pure and harmless, I'm not lovable?\"Feng Xun put on a smile that's not a smile. \"Would a kindhearted person criticize other people for being ugly?\"He heard it! It turned out that he heard it from the beginning! Fairly Mu Yao was alarmed as she stared at Feng Xun, her body stiffened all at once!The young girl's temper flared, fearless round eyes glared. \"So because you heard me call her ugly, in order to help her vent her anger, you then deliberately mentioned Feng Wu, deliberately say that she's prettier than me, right? Young Prince, you actually also don't know what Feng Wu looks like now, right?\"Feng Xun unhurriedly tore off a piece of fresh, tender, succulent roasted Hooting Blood Elk***curving up his lips mindlessly. \"Her mother is Martial Lord Empire's most beautiful woman, how far can the apple fall from the tree? I say, girl from the Mu family, you shouldn't doggedly continue compare yourself with her. She'd simply feel it's beneath her dignity to compare herself to you.\"\"You\u2014-\" Mu Yao was especially angry as she fiercely slapped the table. \"Fine! Nobody leaves after we descend the mountain, we'll go visit the Feng family's old residence. I still don't believe that I, Mu Yao, can't compare with a little trash!\"Feng Wu: \"\u2026\u2026\" It could be said that she now knew what was meant by 'disaster strikes when you least expect it'.But fortunately, the topic about her has been concluded. She can finally eat dinner in peace.However, Feng Wu was clearly celebrating too early\u2014\u2014Feng Xun raised his head, saw the stars glistening bright, shining through the heavens and sighed. \"Alas, speaking of which, Feng Wu was dazzling at that time, stories about her spread throughout the capital during those years. She broke all kinds of cultivation records. I remember that she was already a level three Spirit Expert by the time she was four years old, right?\"\"Level four.\" Xuan Yi seemed to not have paid attention, yet was accurate.\"A four years old level four Spirit Expert, my, when we were four years old we merely stood outdoors. We hadn't even entered the door to the Spirit Expert levels.\"Feng Xun sighed again and again. \"Of course this excludes Boss Jun.

    "Chapter 24": "Chapter 24: Don\u2019t Want To Talk To Elder Brother Feng Xun AnymoreFeng Wu rolled her eyes discreetly.When she crossed over from the 21st century, she became a baby. When she was three years old, she triggered the Dragon Phoenix Ring\u2019s spiritual world and discovered her beautiful master\u2019s existence by chance. At the age of eight, she was targeted by Zuo Qing Yun, who ambushed her. Her True Phoenix Blood was destroyed. She was kicked out of her clan to the old residence in the Northern Territories ever since and she was now thirteen years old.During the five years when she was three to eight years old, she was indeed regarded as a genius by others.Many cultivators were stuck between levels one to nine of the Spirit Expert realm for their entire lives, finding it too difficult to break through.Yet now, Zuo Qing Luan already broke through the Spirit Expert realm and entered the Spirit Ancestor realm at such a young age. Furthermore, she\u2019d already attained such high achievements in the Spirit Ancestor realm.While Feng Wu\u2026\u2026presently, she wasn\u2019t even a level one Spirit Expert.Thinking of this, Feng Wu felt that the food in her hands became a bit tasteless.\u201cAt that time, you weren\u2019t even a match for her.\u201d Feng Xun made fun of Xuan Yi. \u201cI remembered when you lost to Young Feng Wu at that time, you pulled a long face all day long. Everyday, you stood under her door with your sword to rechallenge her. The result was that she was so aloof, she simply didn\u2019t remember you, and instead asked you who you were, and what you\u2019re doing here. Ha ha ha ha ha\u2014\u2014-\u201dXuan Yi remained silent as he glanced at Feng Xun then turned his face away, did this person know how to chat?Feng Wu turned and started at Xuan Yi, did this kind of thing happen at the time? How come she didn\u2019t have any impression of it?But that\u2019s also possible, because she\u2019s especially busy at the time. Besides her daily cultivation assignments, she even had to learn a lot of things, inscription, spirit spells, engraving, painting, music, history, geography\u2026\u2026in addition to the enormously difficult to understand medical expertise. Her beautiful master demanded perfection\u2026\u2026in those days, her little body worked non-stop everyday. Her studies were prearranged from early morning until evening\u2014\u2013in the morning, she truly got up earlier than the roosters and went to sleep later than the pigs. She slept immediately the moment she lay down in bed.It\u2019s fortunate that she was a special agent in her previous incarnation, regardless of whether it\u2019s willpower or endurance, she\u2019d already passed through the fire for shaping and refining. Otherwise, her very young age indeed couldn\u2019t have withstood it.Also, she truly wasn\u2019t acting high and aloof at the time, she was just very busy, very very busy\u2026\u2026That\u2019s why, Feng Wu tried to rectify herself. \u201cThat Feng Wu that you\u2019re talking about, was she truly that aloof? Could it be that she was just very very busy, so she couldn\u2019t attend to it\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cCertainly not!\u201d Feng Xun replied resolutely. \u201cBesides cultivating, what else could she be busy with? She was as straight faced as a plank, very reserved and cold.\u201dFeng Wu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Don\u2019t want to speak with Elder Brother Feng Xun anymore.Feng Xun had a friendly personality, the kind of person who could enliven a table at a party. When Feng Wu ignored him, he simply looked at Xuan Yi and continued to gossip. \u201cXuan Yi, at the time, you liked Young Feng Wu, right? If not, why would you chase after her everyday and even blocked her door?\u201dWithout waiting for Xuan Yi to deny it, Feng Xun complacently lifted his eyebrows. \u201cIt\u2019s a pity though, that Young Feng Wu didn\u2019t like you. The person she liked was our Boss Jun.\u201dFeng Wu was originally drinking a cup of tea. When she heard this, she spurted a mouthful of tea on the spot. \u201cCough cough\u2026\u2026cough cough cough\u2026\u2026\u201dFeng Wu coughed so much, she was having trouble breathing!What the hell was this? Who said she liked Jun Lin Yuan? At the time, she was barely eight years old, hey, eight years old. At that age, what kind of understanding could she have about \u2018like\u2019? Feng Xun was basically just spreading rumours!Feng Xun was busy picking up a spotlessly white silk cloth to help Feng Wu wipe away the droplet at the corner of Feng Wu\u2019s mouth. While he was dabbing, he was even happily saying. \u201cI\u2019m saying that Feng Wu liked our Boss Jun and wasn\u2019t talking about you. What are you anxious for?\u201dFeng Wu was shouting in her heart: She, is, Feng, Wu!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

While he was taking care of Feng Wu, he was continuing to gossip. \u201cAt the time, Feng Wu certainly liked our Boss Jun. One time, she even especially dillydallied as she waited at the door to the imperial school until we came out before she tenderly and bashfully approached and handed over a Three Lives Stone before running away, ha ha ha \u2014\u2014\u2014\u201dFeng Wu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d[It\u2019s a misunderstanding!

How did it become a gift from her?Could it be that at the time, Feng Xun\u2019s group of people in the whole room was loud with laughter, their laugher covered up her words?Besides, how was she dillydallying, or tender, or bashful? At that time, she\u2019s constantly practicing the Phoenix Steps martial arts taught by her master and her legs were wounded all over, how could she walk quickly?Feng Xun was speaking while smiling, once he bowed his head, he discovered Feng Wu\u2019s fist tightly clenched as she knitted her brows and became very curious. \u201cYoung girl, why are you so keyed up? It couldn\u2019t be that you also like our Boss Jun and is feeling jealous, right? Don\u2019t worry, our Boss Jun\u2019s engagement with Feng Xun has already been annulled. They\u2019re no longer related.\u201dFeng Wu nearly choked on her own saliva!Jun Lin Yuan? Jeez please, she\u2019d politely decline this name, alright?Feng Wu hurriedly gestured with her hand. \u201cNo, no, I won\u2019t like your Boss Jun, absolutely improbable\u2014\u2014-bang\u2014\u2014\u2014-\u201dFeng Wu urgently explained. While she was waving, because her motion was too wide, the amber goblet on the dining table was knocked over by her slim arm. Feng Wu anxiously extended her hand to grab it, resulting in her forehead banging on the corner of the table. It hurt so much her tears instantly gushed forth\u2014\u2014This accident happened too quickly\u2026\u2026so quickly that everyone couldn\u2019t react in time.Feng Xun: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dXuan Yi: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dMu Yao: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dJun Lin Yuan raised his head, his face\u2019s handsome deep contours, his deep eyes glanced at Feng Wu, his thin lips opened. \u201cThe engagement wasn\u2019t annulled.\u201dFor a moment, everybody still hadn\u2019t reacted. All of a sudden, Feng Xun fiercely slapped the table as he stared at Jun Lin Yuan. \u201cBoss Jun, what\u2019re you saying? The engagement wasn\u2019t annulled? ! You and Feng Xun\u2019s engagement hasn\u2019t been annulled? !\u201dJun Lin Yuan replied \u2018mm hm\u2019.\u201cThis isn\u2019t possible!\u201d Feng Xun\u2019s attention was immediately distracted. \u201cHow can the engagement not have been cancelled? At the time, didn\u2019t everybody say that the two of you annulled your engagement?\u201d\u201cNo signature.\u201d Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s pupils were as clear as water, the depths of his eyes were hidden and restrained.No matter what, he gave people a kind of noble, dignified, alien, distant feeling.Feng Wu\u2019s whole body was stunned.The annulment contract wasn\u2019t signed? What\u2019s the meaning of this? Did this mean that she was still Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s fiancee? Oh my god ~ that can\u2019t be? !Feng Wu\u2019s eyes opened wide in astonishment. She wished she could dash forward and grab Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s collar and shake him why why why!Feng Xun was also entirely stirred up.\u201cSo you didn\u2019t sign in the end? What!\u201d Feng Xun seemed as if he\u2019d discovered the New World, ferociously slapping the table. \u201cBoss Jun! Don\u2019t tell me, you actually like Feng Wu? ! Is it really because you like Feng Wu that you didn\u2019t sign at the final juncture? ! Right right? Heavens, how did I not realize that you actually like Feng Wu? !

Is it, is it, is it? Oh oh oh oh! ! !\u201dJun Lin Yuan completely ignored Feng Xun and frowned. \u201cIt\u2019s reversed.\u201dReversed? Reversed? Feng Xun was highly intelligent. Crossing his arms, he complacently snapped his fingers and wore an enlightened expression. \u201cI know! Boss Jun, what you mean is that Feng Wu\u2019s head over heels over you and became insane. You didn\u2019t have the heart to see her hurt herself, so you reluctantly didn\u2019t annul the engagement?\u201dWho was head over heels over Jun Lin Yuan and became insane? Feng Wu nearly hopped up.However, what Feng Wu found hard to believe was that that naturally kingly, noble and dignified crown prince, actually declined to comment and merely uttered an \u2018mm\u2019.He, actually, uttered, an, \u2018mm\u2019!How, could, he, just, \u2018mm\u2019?Feng Wu\u2019s pair of pitch black eyes glared until they practically fell from their sockets.This one \u2018mm\u2019 from him actually hid just how many meanings?From the side, Fairy Mu Yao really could no longer sit still as she bit her lower lip. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you annul the engagement? Feng Wu is a useless person now, she can\u2019t cultivate, and will only be an ordinary person in the future. She\u2019ll turn old with time. In a short few tens of years, she\u2019ll become a gray-haired old woman. Crown prince, you\u2019re like a god. How can she be a match to be together with you?\u201dWith regards to this subject, immediately, everyone sunk into silence.Feng Xun was also somewhat emotional as he said. \u201cAt the time Feng Wu (Phoenix Dance) became Fei Wu (Crippled Dance)*, she was only eight years old. It\u2019s truly a pity.\u201dFeng Wu raised her head and gave Feng Xun a quick glare: Fei Wu (crippled dance)? Fei Wu (useless person)*? What a surprise, her nickname had now become Fei Wu (crippled dance)? Truly unpleasant to the ear.(*TN: Feng Wu \u51e4\u821e means \u2018phoenix dance\u2019, whereas Fei Wu \u5e9f\u821e \u2018crippled dance\u2019, while Fei Wu \u5e9f\u7269 \u2018useless person/trash\u2019 is also pronounced similarly to \u2018crippled dance\u2019 with only one tonal difference.)How could Feng Xun know that person he spoke of was sitting across from him? Not only that, she\u2019s cursing him in her heart at the moment? That\u2019s why his innocent face was being glared at by Feng Wu.Fairly Mu Yao smiled coldly as she spoke. \u201cThe Feng family spoiled everything by being overly eager, causing Feng Wu\u2019s cultivation to accidentally go out of control. She greedily ignited her True Phoenix Blood, but in the end, became a useless person who can no longer cultivate. Who can they blame? Shouldn\u2019t they blame Feng Wu for being too greedy?\u201dFeng Wu made a fist discreetly, laughing coldly twice in her heart.So it turned out that the Zuo family released rumors like these to hide the truth? Overly eager? Accident? Greedily igniting her True Phoenix Blood? Huh huh!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 27": "Chapter 27: Change in CircumstancesFeng Xun unexpectedly even uttered \u2018mm hm\u2019. \u201cIf someone\u2019s to be blamed, then only the Feng family can be blamed for being too greedy. Their family seldom produced an exceptional talent, yet was destroyed in this way, also truly pitiful\u2026..sigh.\u201dFeng Wu inhaled deeply: Zuo Qing Luan, ah, Zuo Qing Luan, you destroyed my True Phoenix Blood, and even cried thief while being the real thief, spreading slandering rumors, wanting both the fame and the benefit. You\u2019ve truly obtained every advantage, you\u2019re truly extraordinary!Thinking of this, Feng Wu clenched her fists once more, Immortal Spirit Fruit, she must hurry and obtain the Immortal Spirit Fruit!This evening was destined to not be a tranquil night.Feng Wu wrapped herself in the thick blanket provided by Butler Feng and slept the entire time it took to burn an incense\u2014\u2014all of a sudden, a danger which she couldn\u2019t define caused her to open her eyes.Feng Xun saw Feng Wu waken, which was actually somewhat unexpected. \u201cYou woke up?\u201d\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Feng Wu gathered her blanket and sat up, how could she still be drowsy-eyed? Her eyes were as clear and cold as water, like an unsheathed sword.Feng Xun was somewhat stunned as he watched. He surprisingly saw an ice-cold aura that\u2019s geniuses possessed within Feng Wu\u2019s eyes, like a corpse which climbed out of a mountain of corpses and a sea of blood? No no no, his eyes must be deceiving him.When Feng Xun took another look, he discovered that indeed, this feeling was no longer present.\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201dFeng Wu wonderingly asked.Feng Xun rubbed his eyes. \u201cMy vision was just blurred. I unexpectedly saw a trace of an ice-cold murderous aura within your eyes? I surprisingly have this kind of misperception? I also couldn\u2019t help it.\u201dWhile Feng Xun was watching Feng Wu stand up nimbly, he also saw Fairly Mu Yao soundly asleep wrapped in her blanket not far away.\u201cJust who\u2019s actually the useless person and just who\u2019s the fifth level Spirit Expert?\u201d Feng Xun shook his head.Xuan Yi saw Feng Wu following behind them, that handsome face hidden in depth wrinkled into the word \u2018\u5ddd\u2019 between his brows. His ice-cold gaze scanned over Feng Wu\u2019s body, then finally fixed at Feng Xun, his tone ice-cold. \u201cWatch your person carefully, don\u2019t burden the entire team.\u201dFeng Wu thoroughly understood that Xuan Yi\u2019s words clearly were spoken to Feng Xun, but was in fact spoken for her ears. Xuan Yi had always felt in his heart that she was dead weight that implicated the group.Feng Xun stroked his nose, his pair of pretty pitch black eyes looked towards Feng Wu. \u201cHow about you\u2026\u2026\u201dIn the pitch-black night, Feng Wu\u2019s pair of eyes was very dark yet very bright, just like bright stars shining bright in the sky. Feng Wu was just about to speak, but saw Jun Lin Yuan shoot a glance at her.Feng Wu\u2019s heart stopped, her back subconsciously stiffened, to the point the words in her mouth were swallowed at once.Originally, she was going to say if they were attacked by a pack of Black Luminary Wolves, she had on hand, a drug that could expel the Black Luminary Wolf pack, so they could get rid of the wolf pack without expending any effort. However, she was suddenly aware that she couldn\u2019t reveal her own strength. Especially in the presence of Jun Lin Yuan, she wanted to pretend to be terrified, pretend to be weak, pretend to be a useless individual\u2026\u2026showing the enemy that you\u2019re weak, disguised as a pig to eat a tiger, only in this way could there be an opportunity to catch the crown prince off guard and snatch the Immortal Spirit Fruit from his hands. Otherwise, it was simply impossible for her to succeed.Thinking of this, Feng Wu\u2019s originally sharp, cold as the edge of a blade eyes instantly changed to alarm and at her wits end. \u201cI\u2026\u2026what should I do? Will I die? I don\u2019t want to die\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cJust follow me and don\u2019t run around.\u201d Feng Xun earnestly advised Feng Wu. \u201cThere\u2019s not one bit of spirit force in your body. It\u2019s easy to lose your life in a moment of carelessness!\u201dFeng Wu conscientiously nodded. \u201cMm, ok.\u201d\u201cEh? Where\u2019s Crown Prince Jun?\u201d She looked all around, but found that the scene, there\u2019s only her, Feng Xun, Xuan Yi, and also Fairy Mu Yao who\u2019s soundly asleep.Jun Lin Yuan and Butler Feng were already gone.Feng Xun stilled Feng Wu from behind as a trace of gravity entered his expression. \u201cWe\u2019re being watched.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 28": "Chapter 28: Go Die!Feng Wu asked curiously. \u201cWe\u2019re being watched? In this Martial Lord Empire, is there still someone who dares to spy on Crown Prince Jun? Do they not want their lives anymore?\u201dWho\u2019s Jun Lin Yuan? A ruler who changed the world, the empire\u2019s crown prince whose power overflowed the heavens. Who dared to spy on him?\u201cHave you heard of the Dark Court?\u201d Feng Xun asked.\u201cI\u2019ve heard slightly.\u201d Feng Wu nodded her head. \u201cSeems to be the surviving members of the evil previous dynasty?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right?\u201d Feng Xun\u2019s smiling expression vanished, within his pair of moist and bright eyes, there contained a trace of hurt. \u201cThe Dark Court has always devoted their efforts to overthrowing Martial Lord Empire, they previously set themselves against the current government. This time, we also don\u2019t know how they obtained the news and actually secretly tailed us. Moreover, they even brought a group of experts.\u201dIn the darkness, Feng Wu\u2019s eyes were very deep, very bright. \u201cAre they even stronger than we are?\u201dFeng Xun said. \u201cBased on our investigation, this time, they brought many elders whose strength are quite formidable. There\u2019s even one who\u2019s equally as famous as Boss Jun, the Dark Court\u2019s heir, Yu Ming Ye, \u2026\u2026this time we\u2019re in big trouble. Look at those packs of wolves. They\u2019re coming out!\u201dWhile speaking, the Black Luminary Wolf pack already arrived!Feng Xun\u2019s smiling expression vanished as his face was flushed with a somber expression!He leaped up high, sword light sweeping below, a group of at least five Black Wolves\u2019 heads flew out and tumbled on the ground, smashing above Fairy Mu Yao\u2019s head.\u201cAah!\u201d The originally sound asleep Fairy Mu Yao was instantly awoken, and abruptly jumped up from the ground!Her whole face was covered in blood and she shrieked ever louder. \u201cAah ah ah ah ah! ! !\u201dHer scream immediately attracted the entire pack of Black Luminary Wolves\u2019 attention, without exception.Consequently, the pack of Black Luminary Wolves divided into ranks and squads, as they viciously faced and dashed towards Fairy Mu Yao!And at this moment, Feng Xun and Xuan Yi were both already stuck within the Black Luminary Wolf pack, which was covering the earth, too busy to look after her!When he heard this scream which broke through to the skies, Feng Xun unhappily shot Xuan Yi a glance. \u201cMy Young Fifth hasn\u2019t made a noise, what\u2019s a fifth level Spirit Expert like her screaming for? If she can\u2019t fight them, can\u2019t she run?\u201d Feng Xun lost a bit of patience with her.Xuan Yi\u2019s face was like crystalized ice, his complexion stern and bitingly cold, not saying a word.\u201cYou even say my Young Fifth is deadweight, I think that cousin of yours is the one who\u2019s actually the biggest deadweight.\u201d While Feng Xun was beheading a group of Black Luminary Wolves, he\u2019s jabbering and ridiculing nonstop.Xuan Yi was powerless to retort even if he wanted to, because of this.And at this moment, that small squad of Black Luminary Wolves already charged at Fairy Mu Yao!Fairy Mu Yao\u2019s face revealed alarm!If there was only one or two Black Luminary Wolves, she\u2019d still have the strength to handle them, but there were at least twenty or thirty of them now leaping towards her\u2026\u2026what\u2019s to be done\u2026\u2026she didn\u2019t want to die!When she raised her head, she saw Feng Wu.At once, a sinister look appeared in her eyes.This unexpectedly being the case, then why not have this annoying, ugly person go to hell. To be able to stop her from dying once, could be counted as this little girl\u2019s lifetime\u2019s biggest honor.With this in mind, Fairy Mu Yao\u2019s long, clever body was seen moving as quick as lightning as she rushed towards Feng Wu.Meanwhile, she yelled loudly. \u201cAah, save me! Aah, save me! Aah, save me!\u201dJust when she was rushing towards Feng Wu, Feng Wu spotted the sinister look in Fairy Mu Yao\u2019s eyes!Not good! Feng Wu used the Phoenix Steps martial skill under foot. Right when Fairy Mu Yao rushed over, her figure turned and avoided Fairy Mu Yao\u2019s vicious grip.How could Fairy Mu Yao be willing? !She hadn\u2019t caught Feng Wu, yet during the time she and Feng Wu missed each other, she lifted her hand and pushed at the ferocious wolf pack headed for her. \u201cGo to hell!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 29": "Chapter 29: Why Was She Not Bitten!However, Fairy Mu Yao could guess the beginning, but did not guess the ending.Just as she abruptly aimed to push the middle of Feng Wu\u2019s back, Feng Wu\u2019s right hand craftily moved in an obtuse angle, and pulled at her hand!Fairy Mu Yao hadn\u2019t even reacted when Feng Wu already beautifully rotated from her original spot, \u2018bump\u2019, both she and Fairy Mu Yao fell in the wolf pack and was surrounded by them!Even though Fairy Mu Yao possessed Spirit Qi, and was moreover a fifth level Spirit Master in strength, however, Feng Wu\u2019s success was based of catching her off guard, furthermore, she even used a powerful skill, what she totally depended on was her body\u2019s strength.Actually, Feng Wu could\u2019ve turned around and throw Fairy Mu Yao into the wolf pack, while she then could borrow that force to climb up a tree, to escape unscathed.However, she couldn\u2019t do so.Because Xuan Yi had always used a suspicious gaze to watch her every movement.Fairy Mu Yao\u2019s heart hated enough to die as she angrily glared at Feng Wu!Unexpectedly, this repulsive girl plotted against her!Indeed, without waiting for Fairy Mu Yao to scold her outloud, Feng Wu already screamed miserably screamed again and again. \u201cFairy Mu Yao, you already couldn\u2019t outrun the wolf pack. Why did you want to throw me towards the wolf pack? Aah! Save me aah, save me aah, save me aah\u2014\u2014\u201dThat slim and frail body belonging to Feng Wu rolled around on the ground as if she\u2019d lost her mind, and appeared to cut an extremely sorry figure.Fairy Mu Yao wanted to justify herself, but she didn\u2019t have time to make a sound, because practically every Black Luminary Wolf rushed towards her!Fairy Mu Yao was so angry she almost spit out a mouthful of blood!Why?Why did she and that ugly girl fall into the wolf pack together, but the result was that these twenty to thirty shiny furred, well built, vicious Black Luminary Wolves purposefully focused on attacking her?For what reason did those bloody mouths with sharp fangs only aimed to tear at her? Why why why!What made Fairy Mu Yao now want to vomit blood even more was that ugly girl surprisingly was still crazily rolling around on the ground while yelling \u2018save me aah, save me aah, save me aah!\u2019Save you my ass, even though you were surrounded by the wolf pack, the fact was that there wasn\u2019t a single Black Luminary Wolf who cared about you at all, ok? They\u2019re all after me, they\u2019re all biting at me, ok? !Fairy Mu Yao wanted to cry\u2026\u2026For, what, reason?Feng Wu naturally knew for what reason.Because on her body was the chemical compound made especially to repel the Black Luminary Wolves. When she fell within the wolf pack just now, she had already deliberately smeared the chemical on her arms. That smell was an odor that the wolf pack utterly detested, that\u2019s why they kept their distance from Feng Wu.But Fairy Mu Yao didn\u2019t know this and almost went insane as she was forced back by the wolf pack.Her clothes was torn into shreds, her legs were bitten till they were filled with holes, her hair was as messy as a lunatic\u2019s\u2026\u2026how miserable was that, how wretched\u2026\u2026simply wasn\u2019t much different from an insane old woman.While she was avoiding the Black Luminary Wolves\u2019 bite with all of her strength, she was sobbing out loud. \u201cWhy do they all want to bite me, why don\u2019t they go bite her, why do all of you want to bite me boo hoo hoo~ ~\u201dAnd at this moment, Feng Xun and Xuan Yi already disposed of the majority of Black Luminary Wolves. Once the remaining Black Luminary Wolves saw that there wasn\u2019t an easy meal, they turned tails and left at once.\u201cAre you ok?\u201d Feng Xun looked at the laughable figure before him, rolling around kicking her legs with her eyes closed while yelling loudly \u2018don\u2019t bite me, don\u2019t be me\u2019, and\u00a0 loomily said. \u201cHurry and stop yelling, all of the Black Luminary Wolves are already done.\u201dOnly then did Feng Wu open her eyes as her body sprung into a sitting position, pleasantly surprised written across her face. \u201cIs everything ok now? Is it going to be alright? Oh my god! Can\u2019t believe I\u2019m still alive!\u201dFairy Mu Yao already couldn\u2019t even produce a yell, her entire body was injured, covered in cuts and bruises, drenched in blood, the top of her head looked like a bird\u2019s nest, as she blanked out\u2026\u2026that figure was simply dismal, miserable, wretched, distressed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 30": "Chapter 30: She\u2019s Lying!Xuan Yi half squatted on the ground as he looked at the battered and exhausted cousin before him. That eternal iceberg face also revealed some helplessness at present.\u201cYou\u2026\u2026\u201d Xuan Yi didn\u2019t know what to say.Suddenly!Fairy Mu Yao\u2019s pair of lifeless, soulless eyes fiercely changed direction as her eyes directly shot at Xuan Yi!That glance was just like a resurrected zombie. Even someone as courageous as Xuan Yi was spooked!\u201cCousin!\u201d Fairy Mu Yao ferociously grabbed Xuan Yi\u2019s clothes. \u201cCousin, she\u2019s lying! She\u2019s not a useless person. She can cultivate, she\u2019s got some tricks up her sleeve! She\u2019s not a good person! She\u2019s a spy! Kill her quickly! Hurry and kill her!\u201dXuan Yi remained silent, he wondered if his cousin had been overly terrified, that\u2019s why her brains became overly imaginative.Right at this time, Jun Lin Yuan and Butler Feng arrived late.Their clothes were clean, untainted by even a speck of dust, how did they even appear like they\u2019d been in a fight at all? They only seemed like they\u2019d been going out for a stroll in the garden before leisurely returning in a relaxed manner.Fairy Mu Yao was currently looking at Jun Lin Yuan as she practically pushed Xuan Yi away. Her figure was as fierce as wolves and tigers as she threw herself over!Jun Lin Yuan frowned as he avoided Fairy Mu Yao\u2019s hand. On that incomparably picky silhouette hidden in depth, dark eyes as sharp as a knife\u2019s blade, a cold chill suddenly appeared!Fairy Mu Yao\u2019s momentum was too great, directly took a fall on the ground, and was both in pain and angry, felt wronged as well as broken-hearted, and \u2018wah\u2019 wept loudly. \u201cI\u2019m not lying! I truly saw her used martial force, it\u2019s she herself who pushed me into the pack of wolves! You guys look, she clearly fell together with me within the pack of wolves, but she hasn\u2019t been injured at all, all of those Black Luminary Wolves came to bite me! All of them came to bit me ~ hoo hoo hoo~\u201dIn the beginning, everybody didn\u2019t believe Fairy My Yao\u2019s words, however, when they turned around and saw what a good condition Feng Wu was in\u2014\u2014-They both fell into the pack of wolves\u2019 grip, yet currently, all four limbs on Fairy Mu Yao\u2019s body, even her face, bore marks where the Black Luminary Wolves had bitten her and scratched her. However, as for Little Fifth, besides bits of grass and mud dirtying her, she unexpectedly didn\u2019t receive the slightest bit of injury.This just didn\u2019t make sense.Xuan Yi was originally already suspicious of Feng Wu. At present, his suspicious attitude upped another notch as he grabbed hold of Feng Wu\u2019s hand, his eyes frigid, like crystalized ice. \u201cYou\u2019re truly a spy? !\u201dXuan Yi moved, Feng Xun also moved!Xuan Yi had just grabbed Feng Wu\u2019s hand when Feng Xun also grabbed Feng Wu\u2019s other hand.Feng Xun stared at Xuan Yi. \u201cWhat\u2019re you doing? ! You know my Little Fifth can\u2019t cultivate, yet grabbed her so forcefully, you\u2019re hurting her!\u201dFeng Wu felt a warmth in her heart as her gaze subconsciously moved towards Feng Xun. At this time, what he\u2019s concerned about was whether she was getting injured, and not suspicious whether she was a spy\u2026\u2026didn\u2019t she already say don\u2019t treat her so well?\u201cYoung Prince, things having reached this stage and you\u2019re still protecting her, she personally pushed me towards the wolf pack! She wanted to have me die, she simply isn\u2019t a good person!\u201dFairy Mu Yao rushed up and yelled.Yet Feng Wu smiled faintly, her gaze coldly fixed at Fairy Mu Yao. \u201cI personally pushed you into the wolf pack? Fairy Mu Yao, raise you head three times with gods as witness, as fellow human beings, feel your heart, it\u2019s easy to be struck by thunder when you distort the truth deliberately like this.\u201dXuan Yi\u2019s gaze coldly fixed at Feng Wu as he exerted more force on her hand.\u201cAah\u2026\u2026\u201d Feng Wu suffered pain, and uttered a muffled harrumph.The veins on Feng Xun\u2019s forehead were about to explode. When he was getting angry, an apathetic and aloof voice arrived\u2014\u2014\u201cLet her go.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 31": "Chapter 31: Luck That Defies Heaven\u201cLet go of her.\u201dThis voice, imposing and noble, ice-cold and aloof, resolute and powerful, causing people to feel a kind of reverence deep in their hearts.Those present at the scene, without exception, subconsciously turned towards the direction the voice came from.They saw the young man\u2019s abstruse silhouette, clear pupils, noble appearance, an aura that\u2019s even more incomparably formidable.\u201cBoss Jun.\u201d Xuan Yi creased his brows. \u201cEven though Mu Yao\u2019s words shouldn\u2019t be believed completely, however, the question she raised was still very reasonable, this girl, Little Fifth, is very questionable. \u201cFeng Xun glared at Xuan Yi and strengthened his voice. \u201cBoss Jun said let, her, go.\u201dXuan Yi stared at Feng Xun with an expression that\u2019s not easily dismissed, but no one dares to disobey Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s command, even though he\u2019s Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s close childhood friend.That\u2019s why he let go of his hand and returned Feng Wu\u2019s freedom to her.Feng Xun was busy pulling at Feng Wu, asking with a deeply worried face. \u201cAre you ok? Does it hurt?\u201dFeng Wu indeed wanted to pretend to be weak, pretend to be terrified, pretend to be innocent within their ranks\u2026\u2026maybe she wouldn\u2019t have been good at acting out another character, however, she\u2019d interacted with her beautiful mother for so many years, acting as a white lotus flower which attracts a person\u2019s tender affection was something she had perfected.The rims of her eyes were red, yet resisted tears with great difficulty. Dense mist revolved within the eyes, yet the tears stubbornly didn\u2019t roll down\u2026\u2026The image of an ordinary, unbending, innocent, girl who suffered grievances immediately appeared before everyone.Xuan Yi accidentally took a glance at Feng Wu and felt a sense of guilt emerge from the depths of his heart\u2026\u2026could it be that he\u2019d accused this girl wrongly?Feng Xun was even more distressed, unceasingly glaring daggers at Xuan Yi.Xuan Yi unhappily said. \u201cWhat I suspect isn\u2019t wrong anyway. For what reason did those Black Luminary Wolves only bite Mu Yao without biting her? Don\u2019t tell me that it\u2019s truly because her luck defies the heavens? I don\u2019t believe it!\u201d\u201cWhat she depends on, is truly still her luck.\u201d Jun in Yuan\u2019s thin lips pursed slightly, his voice dark and deep, yet carried an unquestionable certainty.\u201cHuh?\u201d Xuan Yi turned towards Jun Lin Yuan, unable to utter a single sentence.Jun Lin Yuan didn\u2019t talk at all, he only nodded a hint to Butler Feng.Butler Feng\u2019s year round cold iceberg face, thin lips slightly opened and said. \u201cMiss Fifth Feng carries the smell of Floating Frost Night Grass\u2019 juice on her body. Second Young Master Xuan, do you know Floating Frost Night Grass is the main medicinal ingredient used to make the chemical to expel the wolves?\u201dOf course Xuan Yi didn\u2019t know and also didn\u2019t understand the method for refining medicines.Butler Feng walked forward, pointed at the area of ground that Feng Wu rubbed against until nothing remained the same, he spoke neither quickly nor slowly. \u201cWhen Miss Little Fifth fell down, she happened to fall on top of this clump of Floating Frost Night Grass and absorbed some of its juice. The Black Luminary Wolves are very sensitive to this kind of smell, that\u2019s why they won\u2019t touch Miss Little Fifth.\u201dMu Yao was dumbstruck as she listened. \u201cButler Feng, so what you mean to say is that Little Fifth isn\u2019t a spy? She\u2019s only lucky?\u201d\u201cMm Hm.\u201d Butler Feng replied with a cold and detached face.\u201cI don\u2019t believe it, how can there so coincidentally be a clump of Floating Frost Night Grass here, and even was so coincidentally squished by Little Fifth? What kind of luck must this be? I don\u2019t believe a word of it! She\u2019s a spy! She\u2019s the one who pushed me into the wolf pack!\u201d How could Mu Yao accept this explanation? !Feng Wu discreetly shot a glance at Mu Yao.As a matter of fact, of course it\u2019s impossible to merely depend on luck.When Feng Wu pulled Mu Yao and rolled into the wolf pack, she already made successive arrangements. She grabbed a clump of Floating Frost Night Grass from her Dragon Phoenix Ring and crushed them under her, that\u2019s all.But this matter was something that, besides Feng Wu herself, nobody else could know about.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 32": "Chapter 32: She\u2019ll Come Back.Butler Feng\u2019s ice-cold gaze fixed at Mu Yao and walked to the patch of ground not far away.Feng Wu\u2019s heart trembled!The place Butler Feng arrived at, was exactly where she pulled Mu Yao and both of them tumbled amidst the wolf pack!Butler Feng\u2019s eyes drew back calmly, as if he saw through everything in the world. Nothing in the world could affect his state of mind. He spoke indifferently. \u201cHere, this first footprint is Miss Mu\u2019s, the second footprint belongs to Miss Feng.

The second time, Miss Mu wanted to push miss Feng into the wolf pack\u2026\u2026\u201dButler Feng stared at the footprints left on the ground, serenely opened his mouth and declared, just the same as if he saw it with his own eyes.Feng Wu turned towards Butler Feng\u2019s gaze, her pupils constricted slightly\u2026\u2026She always knew that Jun Lin Yuan wasn\u2019t to be trifled with, but didn\u2019t expect that the butler by his side was also so formidable\u2026\u2026when she did things in the future, she silently vowed to be more careful than careful, more cautious than cautious.Feng Wu\u2019s heart was on guard as she discreetly clenched her fists.Fairy Mu Yao\u2019s complexion was deathly pale, like snow, the color of her lips also completely lacked any trace of red, her body on the verge of collapse.Every sentence from Butler Feng was like a slap on her face, ruthlessly struck at her face, struck such that her cheeks were painfully hot.Fairy Mu Yao raised her head and saw Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s cold and detached, godlike, exceptional face: She saw cousin Xuan Yi\u2019s completely unconcealed disappointment towards her: She saw Feng Xun\u2019s anger towards her: She saw Feng Wu\u2026\u2026\u201cAah!\u201d Fairy Mu Yao fell apart. She wrapped her head and screamed loudly. \u201cI admit that Butler Feng is right! I indeed deliberately wanted to pull Little Fifth into the wolf pack! Because I wanted to probe her cultivation! Because I suspect that she\u2019s a spy!\u201d\u201cShut up!\u201d In the end, even Xuan Yi also could no longer tolerate her and snapped at her.\u201cCousin, even you don\u2019t believe me? You guys will regret it, you guys will regret it for sure!\u201d Fairy Mu Yao lost so much face before her Prince Charming, how could her pride allow her to continue to stay with them and act as if nothing happened? Therefore, she wrapped her hands around her head and wailed while she ran away.Feng Xun glanced at Xuan Yi. \u201cYou\u2019re not chasing?\u201dXuan Yi was somewhat at a loss, his brows furrowed.Jun Lin Yuan, who\u2019d always treated words like gold, suddenly spoke. \u201cShe\u2019ll return.\u201dEverybody doubtfully turned towards Jun Lin Yuan.Feng Xun stroked his nose. \u201cI feel that if she still has any self-respect, she shouldn\u2019t reappear for a short time.\u201dJun Lin Yuan didn\u2019t bother to argue and merely turned and stood up, the sleeves of his robe fluttered in the wind.The outline of the side of his face was absolutely gorgeous, like jade, luxuriously handsome, his mannerisms were even more exceptionally godlike, unrivalled, there\u2019s also a kind of indescribable profound mysteriousness, making people unable to see through him.Feng Wu also couldn\u2019t figure out, why was Jun Lin Yuan so sure that Mu Yao would come back on her own right now?Feng Wu found out why very quickly.Because just when they were preparing get on their journey, a panicked voice approached from the distance.\u201cSave me aah! Save me aah! Save me aah!\u201dFairy Mu Yao dashed towards their direction with a speed akin to flying. Behind her was a dense mass composed entirely of Black Luminary Wolves.The quantity of these Black Luminary Wolves was a hundred times more than previously!Thousands upon thousands of Black Luminary Wolves came this way from all directions, their howls shook the earth and the heavens!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Seeing one after another incomparably strong and muscular Black Luminary Wolf, seeing their deep green wolf eyes, simply made a person tremble with fear!\u201cHow\u2019s there so many Black Luminary Wolves?\u201d Even Feng Xun was shocked by this scene before him!He could handle eighty or a hundred of them, but these thousands or tens of thousands of Black Luminary Wolves, this was going to be a fierce, blood-soaked battle!\u201cYou\u2026\u2026\u201d Feng Xun turned his head around towards Feng Wu, his expression grave and apprehensive. \u201cThe present circumstance is too grim compared to before, always stay by my side, got it? !\u201dFeng Wu had never seen Feng Xun so solemn and grave.Thousands to ten thousands of Black Luminary Wolves\u2026\u2026Feng Wu smiled bitterly, even if she had the repelling chemical compound, it\u2019d also be useless. Looks like this time, they\u2019re truly in trouble.Xuan Yi knit his brows. \u201cHow\u2019s there so many Black Luminary Wolves? Looking at their appearance, it seems all of them are going berserk?\u201dJun Lin Yuan\u2019s pair of bitingly cold, keen eyes, dangerously narrowed, he voiced an \u2018mm\u2019.Everyone simultaneously turned to Jun Lin Yuan.Furthermore, Feng Xun subconsciously asked aloud. \u201cThese Black Luminary Wolves couldn\u2019t be\u2026\u2026manipulated by people from the Dark Court, right? Yu Ming Ye?\u201dA cold chill appeared in Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s pair of malicious black eyes. He calmly again voiced an \u2018mm\u2019.\u201cIt\u2019s indeed Yu Ming Ye. It\u2019s rumored that he can control tens of thousands of beasts. I previously thought that it\u2019s a lie. I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s actually true! At present, he surprisingly can already manipulate such a large number of Black Luminary Wolves, this is simply too scary!\u201d Feng Xun repeatedly sighed, deeply moved.However, Feng Wu clearly perceived that Jun Lin Yuan shot Feng Xun a glance filled with pity. That was pity for Feng Xun\u2019s IQ.\u201cTherefore, that rumored Yu Ming Ye controlled the leader of this pack of wolves. After that, he controlled the entire Black Luminary Wolf pack through the lead wolf?\u201d Feng Wu provided further details to the clueless Feng Xun.Jun Lin Yuan shot a glance at Feng Wu.Feng Xun excitedly rubbed the palms of his hands together. \u201cRight! That must be it! That certainly must be it!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Jun Lin Yuan didn\u2019t waste any words. His voice was deep and low, steady and powerful.Go?Black Luminary Wolves spread as far as the eyes could see, how were they to go? Confusion appeared within Feng Wu\u2019s mind.\u201cDong\u2014\u2014\u2013\u201dFeng Xun knocked at Feng Wu\u2019s bright and clean forehead forcefully, Feng Wu painfully buried her face, and glared at Feng Xun in a puzzled manner.Feng Xun responded. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, based on my many years of experience, as long as Boss Jun has spoken, no matter how outrageous something sounds, it\u2019ll still be accomplished in the end, let\u2019s go.\u201dFeng Wu followed by Feng Xun\u2019s side, after that, she saw a scene that amazed her to no end.Jun Lin Yuan walked forward as if he was taking a stroll through the garden, treating the Black Luminary Wolves as if they were air.The leader at the very front of the Black Luminary Wolf pack, whose ruthless scarlet eyes unwaveringly stared at Jun Lin Yuan, was prepared at all times to rush forward and fight him to the death!The entire Black Luminary Wolf pack also howled \u2018awoo awoo\u2019 provocatively, yet they were forced back by Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s imposing manner and couldn\u2019t help but retreat step by step.The wolf eyes staring at Jun Lin Yuan were brimming with both reverence and dread.They didn\u2019t understand why their wolf leader wanted to force them to provoke this young human who made their entire body tremble, they didn\u2019t want to die\u2026\u2026All of a sudden, the Black Luminary Wolf leader\u2019s gaze moved, that pair of originally ruthless bloody eyes regained its clarity.Suddenly, the wolf leader\u2019s voice echoed in the desolate night air.\u201cHowl awoo awoo~~~~\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Swish woosh woosh, they all ran away like rays of light!Feng Xun, who was ready for a blood-soaked fight at any moment: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dMeanwhile, Yu Ming Ye, who\u2019s already set himself up within a mysterious ice canyon, only felt a moment of sweetness well up in his throat before blood oozed out at the corners of his mouth.\u201cHeh heh, Jun Lin Yuan, oh, Jun Lin Yuan. I didn\u2019t expect that you\u2019d break my beast control arts so quickly, and even forced this backlash on me, deserving of a crown prince whose anger could cause the world to change!\u201d Yu Ming Ye was holding a piece of straw in his mouth as the corners curved into an unruly demonic sneer. He turned towards the faintly discernible stars above the sheer cliffs complacently. \u201cHowever this time, you\u2019re already too late, the Immortal Spirit Fruit\u2019s destined to be mine!\u201dDone talking, Yu Ming Ye hands grabbed at the cliff, as his body leapt upwards rapidly. Very quickly, he disappeared into the boundless night sky.At the present moment, Jun Lin Yuan was with their group as they hurried in the dark.The more Feng Xun thought about it, the more worried he became, he ran to Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s side to ask. \u201cBoss Jun, what\u2019s the situation now? Don\u2019t tell me that Yu Ming Ye already arrived at the Mysterious Iceberg Valley.\u201dJun Lin Yuan\u2019s gaze was serene and hidden in depth. \u201cMm.\u201d\u201cThat can\u2019t be? !\u201d Feng Xun was so anxious, he almost jumped up. \u201cYu Ming Ye already arrived in the Mysterious Ice Canyon? The Immortal Spirit Fruit grows in Mysterious Ice Canyon, my dear Boss! You\u2019re not worried that he\u2019s going to take the initiative in removing the Immortal Spirit Fruit? How can you still be so calm?\u201d\u201cImprobable.\u201d Jun Lin Yuan cherished words like gold, but his voice contained a kind of imposing might.\u201cWhy are you so sure?\u201d Feng Xun was a bit worried. \u201cThat Yu Ming Ye is as famous as you are, the Yu Ming Ye who\u2019s a match for you in all respects, the Dark Court\u2019s esteemed heir, he\u2019s not simple at all!\u201dJun Lin Yuan knitted his brows, that pair of impressive eyes shot a glance at Feng Xun.Feng Xun speechlessly supported his forehead in his hand. \u201cFine fine fine, he\u2019s the Yu Ming Ye who doesn\u2019t deserve to be as famous as you are, the Yu Ming Ye whose strength is a level lower than yours, but this Yu Ming Ye is truly very difficult to handle!\u201dFeng Wu was somewhat curious. \u201cIs Yu Ming Ye very scary?\u201dThe minute Feng Wu asked, Feng Xun\u2019s switch turned on. He unhappily said. \u201cYu Ming Ye is supported by a group of elders willing to sacrifice their lives. He already possessed outstanding innate skill, powerful strength second only to Boss Jun. Furthermore, these people\u2019s conduct are sometimes nefariously demonic, uninhibited, sometimes rampant and overbearing, sometimes they even ignore all worldly conventions, never acting according to reason. What\u2019s most despicable is that no matter what our Boss Jun does, Yu Ming Ye would come out to mess things up, just like this time with the Immortal Spirit Fruit. He may have no use for it, but because our Boss Jun wanted it, he\u2019ll insist coming out to wreck it! He\u2019s simply too annoying!\u201dFeng Wu rubbed her chin. \u201cHearing this, it seems this Yu Ming Ye\u2026\u2026is attached to Boss Jun?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that so?\u201d Feng Xun unhappily said. \u201cObsessively attached and even always wants to make his existence known, tell me, is that annoying or not?\u201dFeng Wu rubbed her chin. \u201cWhy do I feel\u2026\u2026that it\u2019s a bit cute?\u201d\u201cYeah, right! Cute my ass!\u201d Feng Xun flicked Feng Wu\u2019s forehead fiercely. \u201cThat\u2019s right, if you happen to face this Yu Ming Ye later, run as far as you can.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d Feng Wu was full of curiosity.\u201cHis pair of romantic, demonically enchanting, soul hooking, soul absorbing eyes, any young lady who\u2019s seen them will fall one by one. This simply can\u2019t be overstated, otherwise, how do you think he can be as famous as our Boss Jun? If it weren\u2019t for his ability to arouse the ladies? That\u2019s why for your own safety, run as fast as you can if you see him. Understand?\u201d Feng Xun earnestly instructed.\u201cOh.\u201d Yet Feng Wu didn\u2019t take his words to heart at all.While they were talking, everyone already arrived at the border to Mysterious Ice Canyon, but at this moment, they saw\u2014\u2014-Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

That\u2019s right!\u201d Feng Xun was so excited that he almost jumped up. \u201cHahaha! That spot is where the fruit grows. If we\u2019ve guessed right, that flash of light is our Immortal Spiritual Fruit!\u201d\u201cBut what\u2019s going on here?\u201d Xuan Yi frowned a little. \u201cThe place looks ransacked. It must have been quite the battle.\u201dAt that very moment, Feng Wu\u2019s unblinking bright eyes were fixed on that towering cliff and the dot of light on it.They were right. That was exactly where that Immortal Spiritual Fruit was.Feng Wu had kept a close watch on that Immortal Spiritual Fruit for the past few years, for once she obtained it, she would be able to refine the Nine Transformation Spirit Restoration Pill, and with the pill, she would be able to resume her cultivation!Resume her cultivation\u2026 She would be that genius teenage girl again\u2026 The temptation was so great that she could hardly stand still.Eyes shining, she clenched her fists under her long sleeves.The next moment, Feng Wu realized that something wasn\u2019t right.Based on her past observations, a formidable, blood-curdling Sacred Emerald Python always hovered around the fruit.All her attempts to get closer to the fruit were rendered futile by the bone-chilling energy the python gave off\u2026 There was nothing she could do about it.However, she neither saw the python nor sensed its energy now, which was rather unusual.Jun Linyuan\u2019s thin lips moved and he said quietly, \u201cThe guy isn\u2019t completely useless.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Feng Xun was bewildered at first, but soon, his eyes lit up. \u201cBoss Jun, this is your doing, isn\u2019t it? You set Yu Mingye up again! That Sacred Emerald Python was lured away by his elders, wasn\u2019t it?\u201dJun Linyuan gave another indifferent \u201chm.\u201dFeng Xun couldn\u2019t help but pity Yu Mingye a little in her head.That teenager\u2026 had fallen into Boss Jun\u2019s trap every single time, but he just kept coming back for more.Feng Xun said, \u201cThis is strange. If Yu Mingye\u2019s people have lured that python away, why hasn\u2019t he taken the fruit already?\u201dThe tiniest smile emerged on Jun Linyuan\u2019s charming face, but he didn\u2019t say a word.The next second \u2014Jun Linyuan leapt up, stepped on the cliff wall, and swiftly dashed upward.In a matter of seconds, he was a long way off the ground already.Feng Xun watched enviously. He then exchanged looks with Xuan Yi and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201dAfter that, both guys kicked the cliff wall with the tips of their feet and they were off like shooting arrows.They were so quick!Feng Wu kept her unblinking gaze on the three teenagers, who were getting smaller and smaller in her sight.

That\u2019s right!\u201d Feng Xun almost jumped up and down excitedly. \u201cHa ha ha, that should be where the Immortal Spirit Fruit is, if I\u2019m not mistaken, that flash just now was clearly the Immortal Spirit Fruit!\u201d\u201cHowever, what\u2019s going on with the surroundings?\u201d Xuan Yi\u2019s brows wrinkled slightly. \u201cSeems as if it\u2019s been ransacked. It appears that an unprecedented battle had taken place.\u201dAnd at present, Feng Wu\u2019s pair of star like eyes were currently staring unblinkingly at that overhanging cliff reaching to the heavens, fixed at that bit of star cluster on top of the precipice. That\u2019s correct, it was precisely the Immortal Spirit Fruit\u2019s location. These past few years, Feng Wu has always been watching the Immortal Spirit Fruit attentively, because as long as she obtained it, she could refine the Nine Spirit Reversal Pill, as long as she swallowed it, she could then start her cultivation anew! To restart her cultivation, sigh\u2026\u2026to recover her identity as the heaven defying Young girl, to Feng Wu\u2026\u2026this enticement was too great, so great she almost could not stand still as excitement filled her entire being.Her eyes shined as the hands concealed within her sleeves clenched into fists.But in the next second, Feng Wu realized that something wasn\u2019t right.According to what she\u2019d observed previously, next to the Immortal Spirit Fruit, there was supposed to be an incomparably large, Saint Jade Python that was capable of making people tremble with fear.Everytime that Feng Wu wanted to approach closer, she\u2019d always been thwarted by the Saint Jade Python\u2019s cold qi, so that she had no choice but to retreat\u2026\u2026to simply return empty handed.However, at present, she surprisingly didn\u2019t see even a shadow of Saint Jade Python, nor did she sense its breath\u2026\u2026this was too strange.Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s thin lips opened slightly. \u201cHe\u2019s actually not completely useless.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Feng Xun started to be puzzled, but very quickly, his eyes then shined. \u201cBoss Jun! It\u2019s you, right? This time you schemed against Yu Ming Ye again? It\u2019s the elders he brought who met with that Saint Jade Python and drew it away, right? !\u201dJun Lin Yuan again uttered \u2018mm\u2019d indifferently.Feng Xun\u2019s heart couldn\u2019t help but observe a moment of silence for Yu Ming Ye.This young man\u2026\u2026.each time he crossed with Boss Jun, he\u2019s been dizzyingly played running in circles, only to suffer defeat in the end, yet kept on fighting despite setbacks.Feng Xun said. \u201cThat\u2019s quite strange, if Yu Ming Ye\u2019s people led the Saint Jade Python away, why hasn\u2019t he picked the Immortal Spirit Fruit?\u201dA faint smile appeared on Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s charming, godlike, unique features, without speaking at all.In the next second\u2014\u2014Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s figure already rose steeply, his feet stepping on the overhanging cliff, his figure quickly rose vertically towards the moon.In merely a moment, his figure already dashed up a great distance.Feng Xun watched enviously. He and Xuan Yi glanced at each other. \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201dFinished speaking, the two of them light footedly also stepped upon the overhanging cliff. Their bodies rapidly ran vertically towards the moon just like arrows which left their bowstrings.Such fast martial arts!Feng Wu\u2019s eyes stared unblinkingly at their silhouettes getting smaller and smaller.

However, what did worry her was how to snatch the fruit away from Jun Linyuan once he had it.Suppressing her excitement, Feng Wu forced her brain to turn.Meanwhile, Jun Linyuan almost reached the top of the cliff!The cliff was a rather special one, for instead of bare rock, the cliff wall was covered in leafy vines from top to bottom.In the dark, with the help of the rock protrusions on the cliff wall, Jun Linyuan twirled and turned, nimbly making his way up the cliff.Just before Jun Linyuan landed, one of the protuberances he stepped on shifted under his weight and let out a cry of pain.However, Jun Linyuan didn\u2019t seem to notice the sound at all. With a leap, he was on the top of the cliff.Feng Xun was right behind Jun Linyuan and heard the cry. Hence, upon landing, he said to Jun Linyuan in bewilderment, \u201cI think you stepped on someone back there.\u201d\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t.\u201d Jun Linyuan didn\u2019t give it another thought.Right now, all his attention was on the Immortal Spiritual Fruit in front of him.Moonlight poured down through the clouds like water and an Immortal Spiritual Flower that was as white as a magnolia slowly blossomed under the moon. It was fruiting as they watched.Gleaming and translucent, the Immortal Spiritual Fruit was as flawless as a piece of white jade. Its beauty was breathtaking.All their orifices seemed to open up at the dense spiritual essence the fruit gave off.Around the plant was a long strip of glistening snake skin.\u201cThat\u2019s the skin the Sacred Emerald Python shed. Judging from its color, the python has completed all nine transformations already\u2026 It must be terrifyingly powerful now. If we had to fight it head-on\u2026 Boss Jun, what chance do we stand?\u201dFeng Xun had forgotten all about the person Jun Linyuan had stepped on, and all he could think of now was this splendid python skin.Jun Linyuan\u2019s nice straight eyebrows creased a little. \u201cWe\u2019d be just as severely injured as it.\u201dPatting his chest, Feng Xun rejoiced. \u201cHahaha! Luckily, Boss Jun tricked Yu Mingye into luring that python away, or even if we could defeat it, it\u2019d be at great cost.\u00a0Sigh\u00a0, I wonder how pissed Yu Mingye will be after he realizes that we\u2019ve stolen his prize.\u201d\u201cYu Ming\u2026\u201d Jun Linyuan frowned, looking confused.Feng Xun said in resignation, \u201cYu Mingye, Yu Mingye, the guy\u2019s name is Yu Mingye\u2026 Come on, Boss Jun, Yu Mingye thinks of you as his number one enemy and he\u2019s been trying to get your attention whenever he has a chance. You don\u2019t even remember his name?\u201dJun Linyuan was still frowning. \u201cThat won\u2019t be necessary.\u201dFeng Xun couldn\u2019t help but say a silent prayer for Yu Mingye. \u201cPoor guy. If he finds out that the person he\u2019s deemed as his archenemy can\u2019t even remember his full name \u2014 and wasn\u2019t planning to, for that matter \u2014 how mad would he be?\u00a0Sigh\u00a0, it\u2019s good that he\u2019s not here, or he\u2019d explode.\u201dJun Linyuan forgot about the subject right away. With a flick of his fair, slender fingers, the Immortal Spiritual Fruit automatically flew toward the white jade box in his hands.Once the fruit was inside, the lid closed on its own and the box locked with a click.Jun Linyuan turned around swiftly, his robe flapping in the wind. His foot pushed down on the cliff wall, and with the momentum, he jumped off.On his way down, he stepped on that round, black protuberance again, but paid no attention to it whatsoever.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

From the bottom to the summit, the way was completely covered with vines, lush branches and leaves, without a patch of bareness.In the dark, Jun Lin Yuan borrowed a dark protrusion against the cliff and rotated his body to move up top as his entire body leapt to the summit.Just when Jun Lin Yuan leapt up, that dark protrusion that he used to brace himself on, suddenly swayed a bit before a miserable scream sounded out!However, Jun Lin Yuan didn\u2019t pay any attention to this blood-curdling scream at all as he threw himself above the overhanging cliff.Feng Xun had been following behind Jun Lin Yuan, that\u2019s why he paid attention to that miserable scream, that\u2019s why after he flew over the cliff, he had some misgivings and said to Jun Lin Yuan. \u201cJust now, it seems you\u2019ve stepped on someone.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d Jun Lin Yuan didn\u2019t admit it.

Even the naked eye could see the speed at which it bore the Immortal Spirit Fruit.The fruit was as fair as jade, sparkling and translucent, so beautiful it made a person hold their breath.That dense spirit qi even more so, made every pore in a person\u2019s body open because of it.Encircling the Immortal Spirit Fruit was a sparkling and translucent snake skin\u2014\u2014\u2013\u201cThis snake skin\u2014\u2014this is the Jade Saint Python\u2019s molted skin, moreover based on the color, it\u2019s already molted nine times\u2026\u2026what a frightening strength. If we\u2019re to face it\u2026\u2026Boss Jun, do you have the confidence of winning?\u201d Feng Xun already completely forgot about the matter of stepping on somebody. Right now, his mind was filled with this as pure as jade, ninth evolution Saint Jade Python skin.Jun Lin Yuan pair of sword shaped eyebrows moved slightly. \u201cBoth sides suffer.\u201dFeng Xun patted the center of his stomach in joy. \u201cHa ha ha, fortunately, Boss Jun set Yu Ming Ye up and had their people lead the python away. Otherwise, even if we won by luck, it\u2019s inevitable that we\u2019d have to pay a painful price. Sigh, if Yu MIng Ye knew that he\u2019s the mantis that stalks the cicada while we\u2019re the oriole behind, wonder if he\u2019d go insane with anger.\u201d\u201cYu Ming\u2026\u2026?\u201d Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s slightly puzzled.Feng Xun was dumbfounded. \u201cYu Ming Ye, Yu Ming Ye, Yu Ming Ye\u2026\u2026Boss Jun, are you for real? Yu Ming Ye indeed can be considered your greatest rival, all day long he jumps up and down in front of you to make his existence known, yet you surprisingly can\u2019t even remember his name?\u201dJun Lin Yuan\u2019s handsome brows knitted slightly. \u201cNot necessary.\u201dFeng Xun couldn\u2019t help but observe a three second moment of silence in his heart on Yu Ming Ye\u2019s behalf. \u201cPitiful little guy, Yu, if he knows that the one he considers as his greatest rival surprisingly can\u2019t even remember his name, moreover, he simply doesn\u2019t plan to remember it\u2026\u2026will he go insane from anger? Sigh, fortunately, he\u2019s not here, otherwise, he might explode.\u201dJun Lin Yuan disagreed as his as fair as jade fingers lightly plucked. The Immortal Spirit Fruit automatically flew into a white jade box in his hand.After the Immortal Spirit Fruit flew in, \u2018patta\u2019 sounded, the white jade box closed and automatically locked.Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s body turned, robe fluttering in the wind, borrowing the cliff\u2019s potential energy, his body headed down.As he descended, he again stepped on the black ball which previously stuck out from the cliff, but he ignored it\u2014\u2014Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Immortal Spirit Fruit! The Immortal Spirit Fruit that would allow her to cultivate again!Feng Wu\u2019s heart was in ecstasy, moved, so excited that her whole body couldn\u2019t keep itself from trembling violently\u2026\u2026Feng Wu was afraid that her eyes would reveal too much, so she purposefully kept her head down, not wanting the sharp minded Jun Lin Yuan to decipher any clues.However, Feng Xun had always been very concerned about Feng Wu. He saw Feng Wu trembling, and at once was worried. \u201cWhy is your whole body shaking? Are you feeling ill? Could it be that you\u2019ve caught a cold from the night wind?\u201dFeng Wu always constantly lowered her own presence, but with Feng Xun caring for her like this, once again she had became the focus of everyone.Fairy Mu Yao unhappily said. \u201cCaught a cold? In my opinion, she\u2019s probably so excited from seeing the Immortal Spirit Fruit that her whole body\u2019s trembling? Didn\u2019t I say already, she\u2019s a spy!\u201dFeng Xun was so angry he glared at her. He didn\u2019t scold Fairy Mu Yao, rather, he warned Xuan Yi. \u201cI\u2019ve never beaten a woman before, but that doesn\u2019t mean at all that I won\u2019t beat a loathsome woman.\u201dXuan Yi silently threw a glance at Feng Xun, he really couldn\u2019t figure out, what ability did this Little Fifth have that she could make this Young Prince from the Northwind Prince\u2019s Mansion protect her this way.Thinking of this, Xuan Yi patted Fairy Mu Yao and admonished her. \u201cDid you hear that? You understand? Have you remembered it?\u201dThis attitude, clearly showed that he was avoiding responsibility. If Fairy Mu Yao was beaten by Feng Xun, he wouldn\u2019t get involved in it.Fairy Mu Yao wanted to cry but had no tears\u2026\u2026other family\u2019s cousin defended their family member in all kinds of ways. Why was it that her cousin didn\u2019t protect her even a little!At this moment, however, Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s eyes moved slightly. He ignored the surging undercurrents in front of him, and only indifferently said one sentence. \u201cThe ninth evolution Jade Saint Python is coming back soon, let\u2019s go.\u201dThereupon, the people under Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s guide rapidly evacuated.Not long after this group departed, at that overhanging cliff, the head that was concealed by that lush vegetation, at this moment, finally moved.Crack crack crack\u2014\u2014once that young man\u2019s hand was set loose, his body immediately tumbled from the cliff!Crash crash crash\u2014\u2014fortunately, the entire way down was completely covered by vines and leaves. He fell the all the way down to the ground, and fell on top of a pile of light yellow dried grass.\u201cPtooey pah pah\u2014\u2014\u201dAn enchanting and exceptional demonically charming young man, crawled out with difficulty from a pile of grass.His head, his body, his clothes were all totally dirtied with straw, especially on his head. Because he rolled all the way down from the cliff, his entire head became like a bird\u2019s nest and looked to be a terrible mess with weeds sticking out everywhere.This originally exceptionally enchanting young man who now looked battered and exhausted was indeed none other than the one Feng Xun previously mentioned, Yu Ming Ye.This young man could be said to have been chased by bad luck\u2026\u2026From the start, he indeed held the advantage, and arrived at Mysterious Ice Canyon a step before Jun Lin Yuan.Because he used a special method to control the Black Luminary Wolf pack, attempted to use these thousands of Black Luminary Wolves to hinder Jun Lin Yuan.However\u2014\u2014Yu Ming Ye had no way of knowing, that when he was on the verge of reaching the peak, just when he was only ten meters away from the Immortal Spirit Fruit\u2014\u2014That eight evolutions Jade Saint Python, finally cultivated to the ninth evolution and attained an immortal body!An ice-cold poisonous ray shot forth from the Jade Saint Python\u2019s forehead!Whoosh!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He rushed towards the direction Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s group headed off to with a rallying cry!However, as far as who answered him, besides the rustling wind, there wasn\u2019t any other sound.\u201cYou stepped on my head aah aah aah arrgghh! ! ! !\u201dYu Ming Ye was so angry he nearly spit blood!He unexpectedly said he didn\u2019t step on anybody, and even couldn\u2019t say his full name, so annoying, so upsetting!Truly, was, very, infuriating!Whether there was the Immortal Spirit Fruit or no Immortal Spirit Fruit, in fact, Yu Ming Ye didn\u2019t really care about that. After all, the reason why he appeared here was merely to choke Jun Lin Yuan. Because Jun Lin Yuan wanted to obtain the Immortal Spirit Fruit, his goal then was to prevent Jun Lin Yuan from obtaining it.\u201cIt\u2019s been unexpectedly obtained by you\u2026\u2026Jun Lin Yuan, do you think that this matter will conclude like this? No way!\u201d Yu Ming Yuan clenched his fist tightly. \u201cYou\u2019ll very quickly realize how incredible I, Yu Ming Ye, am!\u201dJust at this time, a burst of undulations arrived in front of him.Yu Ming Ye\u2019s heart gladdened. His elders had returned!Indeed, the three elders arrived simultaneously, following behind them was even the wounded Jade Saint Python.Yu Ming Ye coldly laughed. \u201cJun Lin Yuan, do you think that the Immortal Spirit Fruit is so easy to obtain? Just wait and see!\u201dFinished talking, Yu Ming Ye then led the Jade Saint Python towards Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s direction!At the front, their group was currently moving rapidly.Even the always delicately pretty Fairy Mu Yao was presently completely focused on hurrying at high speed.Just at this time, behind everyone came an explosive hissing roar!\u201cThievesss of the Immortal Spirit Fruit, where will you run!\u201dThe Jade Saint Python spit out a very long serpent\u2019s tongue from its mouth, the python\u2019s tongue was just like a strip of red ribbon, streaking across the sky in an arc!The direction the python launched its tongue towards was unexpectedly Feng Wu\u2019s!From the start, Feng Xun haven\u2019t had a chance to notice.

Based on Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s character, this isn\u2019t something he\u2019d do. Why would he save someone?\u201dAs an enemy of Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s ever since their childhood until now, Yu Ming Ye was shocked.Hearing a sound, Feng Wu subconsciously turned her head around.Many years later, Yu Ming Ye still couldn\u2019t forget the image of Feng Wu from the first time he saw her.Her totally dumbstruck face turned around, that very less than ordinary young girl\u2019s bewildered face, with a mouthful of dirt, within the dirt, there were even a few pieces of straws\u2026\u2026that appearance cut a sorry figure beyond a sorry figure, yet also was cute beyond cute.\u201cHa haha haha \u2014\u2014\u201d Yu Ming Ye very sincerely faced upwards and laughed.Feng Wu was full of complaint as she glared at him!Two people, four eyes faced each other, in the next instant, Yu Ming Ye became aware that he was exposed, as he wailed loudly and ran away. It wasn\u2019t known which tree he leapt up.Feng Wu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dJust when Feng Wu was a faceful of confusion, Fairy Mu Yao viciously glared at her again. \u201cDon\u2019t think just because Crown Prince Jun saved you, that you\u2019ve entered his sights, I\u2019m telling you, that was completely because he did it in passing, don\u2019t think much on it!\u201dFeng Wu: \u201c\u2026\u2026woah\u201d\u201cWhat kind of an attitude is that? Humph! Crown Prince Jun wouldn\u2019t like you! It\u2019s also absolutely impossible that he\u2019ll like you! He only saved you out of convenience!\u201dFairy Mu Yao seemed as if she was convincing herself as she clenched her fists.Feng Wu simply was unable to make heads or tails of it, she \u2018ptui ptt\u2019 spit out the mud from her mouth and asked in response. \u201cThen has he ever saved you out of convenience before?\u201dOnly one sentence, yet it hit right at the bull\u2019s eye.Fairy Mu Yao\u2019s heart met with a \u2018thump\u2019, then she completely stiffened. She stared at Feng Wu unmovingly, unable to utter a single word.In the next second, she finally reacted, so angry she turned and left!Thump thump thump, the sounds of footsteps were especially loud, giving vent to the rage in her heart.Feng Wu made a face behind Fairy Mu Yao, so rampant, the hell?On top of a branch not far away, Yu Ming Ye bit his lower lip, that pair of attractive, romantic, watery eyes rolled.You don\u2019t say, Jun Lin Yuan pulled away this commonplace girl, could it be, Jun Lin Yuan surprisingly truly treated this girl differently?Yu Ming Ye\u2019s eyes looked up and down as he sized up Feng Wu.An ordinary face easily lost in the crowd and not easily distinguished.A slim and flimsy appearance easily blown away by the wind.A body as good as a cripple without the slightest bit of cultivation of spirit qi.If one insisted on finding something positive, then that pair of clean, crystal clear, big eyes could considered to be a bit of a redeeming feature.Jun Lin Yuan \u2026 had this kind of taste? Yu Ming Ye awkwardly rubbed his chin, those sword shaped brows and starlike eyes creased very tightly.And at just this time, the elders by Yu Ming Ye\u2019s side already arrived, one after another, they jumped onto the trunk of an ancient tree which ten people couldn\u2019t wrap their arms around.

Hadn\u2019t the Young Master made plenty of promises, how could he remember each and every single one of them?Yu Ming Ye again sighed a long sigh, and talked to himself. \u201cI wore two things before. Anything that belongs to Jun Lin Yuan, I want them all.

If worst comes to worst, I\u2019ll just close my eyes!\u201dThe head elder was somewhat sympathetic as he watched Yu Ming Ye. \u201cYoung Master, how about you just\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cNo!\u201d Yu Ming Ye glared at the head elder, that pair of limpid, beautiful big eyes glared big and round. \u201cYou weren\u2019t here just now, you simply can\u2019t understand that kind of humiliation! ! !\u201dThe head elder\u2019s expression was one of a big question mark.\u201cJun Lin Yuan stepped on my head and even stepped on it two times!\u201d\u201cIn addition, he even failed to recall my name, he surprisingly, doesn\u2019t- remember- my- whole-name, argh argh argh! ! !\u201d Yu Ming Ye was so angry that the veins on his forehead violently palpitated!He considered Jun Lin Yuan as the greatest rival of his life, however, the other party unexpectedly couldn\u2019t even recall his whole name\u2026\u2026Yu Ming Ye instead drew a breath of cold air, his expression was of being humiliated.The head elder watched the Young Master jumping about like a little child. \u201c\u2026\u2026alas.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t care!\u201d Yu Ming Ye was so angry that he slapped the gigantic tree. \u201cThis time, I must have Jun Lin Yuan remember my name! He has to remember it!\u201d\u201cDo you think I\u2019m good looking or not? Handsome or not?\u201d Yu Ming Ye made a face against the head elder and smiled, the soul and spirit bewitching romantic eyes that stirred the heart and brought confusion. That kind of flavor overflowing with demonic charm, to gorgeous it moved a person\u2019s soulThe head elder helplessly looked at his Young Master. \u201c\u2026\u2026Very handsome!\u201dYu Ming Ye was immediately filled with confidence and complacently flipped his dark fine black hair. He then declared with a smirk on his face: \u201cThat\u2019s why, as long as I snatch that young girl and have her love me, Jun Lin Yuan will have no option but remember my name!\u201dThe head elder silently heaved another sigh.In the presence of other people, his Young Master was considered a high and almighty figure in the world, so scary that others trembled with fear, however, in front of the other youngster Jun Lin Yuan\u2026\u2026he was like a little child who caused all kinds of rackets in order to get his attention.And at this moment, in a blink, Feng Wu could no longer see Yu Ming Ye as her brows creased faintly. Could it be that she saw wrongly just now?That\u2019s not right, her impression was quite deep. She was dazzled by that pair of watery, demonically charming pair of romantic eyes. Bewitching and enchanting eyes that hooked onto one\u2019s soul, the kind of glamour that couldn\u2019t come from simple imagination, therefore that absolutely wasn\u2019t an illusion.But right now, since he already disappeared, Feng Wu also didn\u2019t find it necessary to continue to dwell on it.She turned her head towards the area of violent disturbance.A loud rumbling sounded.The Jade Saint Python dropped to the ground from the skies, creating a violent noise.Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s figure was as fast as lightning, the sword in his hand chopped to behead as a red curve broke out!In the next split second, the ninth evolution Jade Saint Snake\u2019s body split open!It was divided in two!Blood spurted and sprayed out into a fine mist!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Several small black dots disappeared in the boundless dim of night.As Jun Lin Yuan descended, Feng Xun and Xuan Yi already flew upwards, one to his left and one to his right, escorting him with pleasantly surprised expressions.\u201cBoss Jun!\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s face was nevertheless like an iceberg, his expression as unmoving as a mountain.\u201cThe Ninth Evolution Jade Saint Python is dead?

It\u2019s ultimately still your work, hahahaha the Immortal Spirit Fruit, the Immortal Spirit Fruit finally is in our hands!\u201dOn that exceptionally godlike face of Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s appeared a faint arc.This is the first time Feng Wu had seen the corners on Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s mouth curve up ever since she met him.Feng Wu\u2019s heart skipped a beat\u2014\u2014It seemed that the Immortal Spirit Fruit was also quite important to Jun Lin Yuan, otherwise, why would he rushed from the capital to such distant parts?And even revealed such a satisfied smiling expression when he saw the Immortal Spirit Fruit?However\u2026\u2026Feng Wu clenched her fists tightly!The Immortal Spirit Fruit was hers, and could only be hers!What could she do in order to snatch the Immortal Spirit Fruit from Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s hands?Feng Wu thought about it until her brains almost cracked, yet she couldn\u2019t think of a good method.Because Jun Lin Yuan was too smart, vigilant and observant, and his strength was also at such a terrifying level\u2026\u2026Feng Wu discovered distressfully that it might\u2019ve been better off for the Immortal Spirit Fruit to remain in the Jade Saint Python\u2019s grasp, that way, she might\u2019ve still had a chance. As it is, she completely didn\u2019t know how to make a move now?What could she do\u2026\u2026? What could be done\u2026..? Feng Wu thought until her brains were in knots, yet still didn\u2019t think of a good method.Very quickly, they arrived at their previous campsite.Feng Xun said. \u201cEvening is approaching, it\u2019s not good to take to the road at night. Everyone\u2019s tired, let\u2019s rest for the night once again.

This made her feel a suffocating sense of defeat.Could it be that she\u2019d need to make use of the honey trap?Feng Wu smiled bitterly, Jun Lin Yuan certainly wouldn\u2019t take the bait, then how about\u2026..While Feng Wu tossed and turned, suddenly, an ice-cold figure approached by her side and firmly covered her mouth.Feng Wu\u2019s two eyes glared fiercely at the covered face.A black clothed human figure sealed Feng Wu\u2019s mute acupoint, rolled her up in the blanket, carried her on his shoulder and ran!\u201cYou\u2026\u2026\u201d Feng Wu wanted to yell, however, she tragically found out that she surprisingly couldn\u2019t make a sound.She wanted to twist her body loose yet helplessly discovered that her acupoint had been sealed, therefore, she couldn\u2019t move when she tried.And at this moment, Feng Xun and the others were cultivating. None of them realized that she had disappeared.It was unknown how much time had passed. Thump. Feng Wu and the blanket both fell onto the ground, as it unrolled continually as her body was finally hurled out of the blanket.Feng Wu hadn\u2019t even gotten up when her gaze locked with the other person\u2019s pair of enchanting and romantic eyes.

Yo hey~\u201cYou\u2019re not afraid of death?\u201d Yu MIng Ye curiously turned his gaze towards this young girl. Before even considering anything else, just her calm as the wind demeanor alone, in spite of having been reduced to a prisoner, could in fact make a person look at her a few more times. Those mediocre facial features instead seemed to be a little tiny bit refreshing to the eye.Feng Wu remained curt. \u201cYou won\u2019t kill me.\u201d\u201cWhy are you so sure?\u201d Yu Ming Ye asked curiously.Feng Wu rolled her eyes. \u201cYou captured me in the dead of night, is it just so you could kidnap me to kill me? Excuse me, what enmity and what hate is there?\u201dYu Ming Ye actually took a few more looks at Feng Wu.This young girl\u2019s appearance was quite ordinary, yet her courage truly made a person have no choice but look at her a few more times. Sigh, if it wasn\u2019t for her face that\u2019s really too commonplace, can\u2019t say for sure, he might truly grow fond of this girl.Because this temperament was to his liking.\u201cYou\u2019re actually intelligent, no wonder Jun Lin Yuan would treat you differently.\u201d Yu Ming Ye glanced at Feng Wu with a smile that\u2019s not a smile. \u201cHowever, what that girl said just now was right, it\u2019s impossible for Jun Lin Yuan to marry you!\u201dFeng Wu was dumbfounded: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s true, you should believe me, everyone said that the Jun imperial clan and the Feng clan\u2019s engagement was annulled, when in fact, that marriage agreement has truly not been removed, Feng Wu is still your Crown Prince Jun\u2019s unmarried wife.\u201d Yu Ming Ye attempted to drive a wedge between them.Feng Wu speechlessly faced the sky and indistinctly said. \u201cI don\u2019t need you to remind me of it again\u2026\u2026\u201dPreviously, when Feng Wu and Jun Lin Yuan conversed, she already knew it. Why did he still bring up this matter again?Feng Wu\u2019s heart almost collapsed, therefore, she cried without tears.Yu Ming Ye noticed that Feng Wu looked to be quite like who\u2019s alive but who\u2019s heart was dead, because Feng Wu seemed broken-hearted, he therefore continued to instigate her. \u201cWhat\u2019s so good about Jun Lin Yuan? He held onto Feng Wu without annulling their marriage yet is also not marrying her, there\u2019s also that Zuo Qing Luan eyeing him covetously. You tell me, your looks are so mediocre, even if he treated you a bit well, he also couldn\u2019t possibly marry you.\u201dFeng Wu. \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cLook at me, hurry and look at me\u2014\u2014\u201d Yu Ming Ye\u2019s hands held onto Feng Wu\u2019s lower jaws, that pair of watery rippled soul stirring eyes blinked. \u201cLook at me, I\u2019m pretty good looking, aren\u2019t I? I\u2019m no way inferior to Jun Lin Yuan, right?\u201dFeng Wu speechlessly placed her hand on her forehead, this young man\u2026\u2026is there really nothing wrong with his brains?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Feng Wu could only nod silently as she dispiritedly shot a glance at him.\u201cAm I beautiful? Am I more good-looking than Jun Lin Yuan?\u201d Yu Ming Ye winked at Feng Wu.This ambly experienced expression of his, in the past, with merely with a curl at the outer corners of his eyes and all the other young girls would absolutely be mesmerized into a giddy state, no longer aware of what day or night is. With one look, he could tell that the girl before him was easy to hook.Feng Wu. \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d With regards to men, wasn\u2019t saying that a man was beautiful a derogatory remark?\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Feng Wu uncomfortably asked.\u201cIt\u2019s impossible for Jun Lin Yuan to give you a position, but I can give one to you! Jun Lin Yuan won\u2019t marry you, but I can marry you!\u201d The young man made a fist, and appeared to vow solemnly. \u201cI\u2019m actually the Dark Court\u2019s heir, therefore, as long as you place yourself in my hands, I will certainly provide you with a lifetime of riches and honor\u2026\u2026\u201dThe young man proudly made a vow, but at the moment, Feng Wu\u2014\u2014She stared at Yu Ming Ye, her gaze lifeless, because actually, her soul had already left her early on. Her entire brain was only obsessed with contemplating about the matter of the Immortal Spirit Fruit, Immortal Spirit Fruit, Immortal Spirit Fruit\u2026\u2026What in the world did she need to do to be able to snatch it from Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s hand and land it in her own hands? Using force to fight for it certainly won\u2019t work, therefore she could only outwit him.However, Jun Lin Yuan watched over the Immortal Spirit Fruit closely. What kind of method could she possibly use to be effective?Feng Wu\u2019s brain was filled with these thoughts. She thought about it so much her brain even hurt.Yu Ming Ye watched Feng Wu\u2019s lifeless face, and his eyes became even more delighted.This young girl was starry-eyed with infatuation for him!Ha haha\u2014\u2014Didn\u2019t he say it before!His looks was universally viewed to be incomparably beautiful in the world. It\u2019d be strange if the young girl wasn\u2019t smitten with him into a confused and disoriented state, ha haha. This was Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s woman, heh! From this, couldn\u2019t it be proven that he\u2019s more attractive than Jun Lin Yuan? Ha haha\u2014\u2014The young man couldn\u2019t help but face the sky and laughed.Feng Wu was startled by this unrestrained laughter and regained her senses in an instant as her pair of bright, lively eyes, turned towards Yu Ming Ye in confusion.Without waiting for her to ask for an explanation, the young man took a hold of Feng Wu and said with a heart full of excitement. \u201cYoung girl, betray Jun Lin Yuan and work for me in the future, our Dark Court surely won\u2019t treat you unfairly!\u201dBetray Jun Lin Yuan? Feng Wu was stupefied. When did she say she wanted to betray Jun Lin Yuan?Without waiting for Feng Wu to explain, Yu Ming Ye\u2019s entirely excited and emotionally stirred face continued. \u201cTherefore, the Immortal Spirit Fruit\u2019s mission will be given to you! Steal the Immortal Spirit Fruit from Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s hands and give it to me and I\u2019ll give you status!\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Feng Wu completely ignored the second half of Yu Ming Ye\u2019s words, as her brain rumbled intensely as if a sudden clap of thunder passed by!Help Yu Ming Ye steal the Immortal Spirit Fruit from Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s hands? !Right at this split second!Originally caught in a dilemma, Feng Wu\u2019s brain seemed as if a dose of medicine has been poured into it. In a flash, her head cleared up and became abundantly inspired. She became totally excited!Her pair of eyes became clear and full of life. At present, she actually stared unblinkingly at Yu Ming Ye!Yu Min Ye\u2019s heart was stunned by Feng Wu\u2019s stare as it shook!However, he quickly surmised that this girl became so excited to this extent, because she heard that he would give her a position?Sigh, didn\u2019t he say it already, how could this kind of ordinary girl restrain herself when the position of Yu Ming Ye\u2019s wife was offered to her?\u201cImmortal Spirit Fruit?\u201d Feng Wu recovered as much of a mild tone of voice as possible before she turned towards Yu Ming Ye.

It\u2019s Jun Lin Yuan we\u2019re talking about, Jun, Lin, Yuan!\u201d Feng Wu said without a trace of joy.Yu Ming Ye curled his lips. \u201cYou think I\u2019m dead or something?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cSo what if it\u2019s Jun Lin Yuan? He may be intelligent and very strong but am I very stupid and very weak?\u201d A provoked Yu Ming Ye rolled his eyes at Feng Wu.Feng Wu wanted to nod her head very much, but was afraid she\u2019d be killed, so she could only shake her head in silence\u2026\u2026\u201cSo?\u201d Feng Wu asked distractedly. \u201cWhat are your thoughts on the matter?\u201dIt\u2019s the Immortal Spirit Fruit\u2026\u2026her Immortal Spirit Fruit! After she cultivated again, she could then wake her beautiful master, the strongest man in the continent.Thinking of this, Feng Wu\u2019s heart shook. A piece of her heart practically jumped out of her throat.Yu Ming Ye wouldn\u2019t be able to read Feng Wu\u2019s heart at all. He shot a glance at Feng Wu, while throwing an object at her.Feng Wu caught it and looked, to discover that it was a bottle of raw liquid.\u201cThis is the Inverse Needle.\u201d Yu Ming Ye complacently turned towards Feng Wu. \u201cYou should think of a way to steal the original fluid from Immortal Spirit Fruit in Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s possession, then replace it with the liquid in the Inverse Needle.\u201dFeng Wu pointed at the Inverse Needle along with a transparent bag Yu Ming Ye gave her. \u201cThere couldn\u2019t be poison inside this bag, right?\u201dYu Ming Ye glared at Feng Wu as if looking at an idiot. \u201cPoison? What kind of a person do you think I am? Of course there\u2019s a very poisonous liquid in here!\u201dFeng Wu. \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Ming Ye stared at Feng Wu. \u201cSigh, sigh, sigh, little girl, it can\u2019t be that you can\u2019t bear to make the move, right? You should know that as of now, you\u2019re my, Yu Ming Ye\u2019s woman! You want to regret it? It\u2019s too late!\u201dAfter saying this, Yu Ming Ye used a kind of very strange, very conflicted look to gaze at Feng Wu.Conflicted? What\u2019s Yu Ming Ye feeling conflicted about? Feng Wu didn\u2019t understand.Yet at the moment, Yu Ming Ye grabbed his own head and stood up, then walked quite a few steps around Feng Wu!He looked up at the stars filling the sky. After that, he again looked at Feng Wu with great distaste, not saying anything the whole time.Feng Wu was dumbfounded by his gaze. What kind of a situation was this?What was Yu Ming Ye thinking? He was thinking about whether or not he should take advantage of this moonless, windy night and do this young girl on the spot. If he did that, then this young girl really, truly, would be considered his woman. She\u2019d be mesmerized and head over heels in love over him.However, what Yu Ming Ye really felt conflicted about was\u2026\u2026as a highly attractive man, he looked at that girl\u2019s ordinary face and he could, not, bring, himself, to, do, it!\u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d Feng Wu looked at him in puzzlement.\u201cI can\u2019t make myself suffer such a grievance!\u201d The young man clenched his fists as he talked to himself, and even fiercely let out an \u2018Mn\u2019!Feng Wu silently watched this young man, whose heart already finished developing these emotions, and asked in confusion. \u201cSo, what the heck do you plan on doing?\u201dYu Ming Ye raised his hand. In the palm of his right hand rested a small little pink pill.Without waiting or Feng Wu to respond, Yu Ming Ye already stuffed the pink pill into Feng Wu\u2019s mouth!The tip of Feng Wu\u2019s tongue licked it, so she was then able recognize that this unexpectedly was a laxative.Without waiting for Feng Wu\u2019s reaction, he already knew what to say to her.\u201cDo you know what medicine that was?\u201d Yu Ming Ye\u2019s threatening voice sounded!Feng Wu lifted her head, saw the young man pretending to be serious, grave, cold, and she smiled.However, before she even said anything, Yu Ming Ye very solemnly, very grimly, stared at her as he stood up high. \u201cThis is a Ten Thousand Ants Body Devouring Bone Breaking Heart Poisoning Pill!\u201d\u201cHuh?

Even though she hadn\u2019t been officially ranked, however, her pill making techniques were the best within the entire Martial Lord Empire, you know?

Moreover, don\u2019t you know that the pill\u2019s formula originated from me and I can easily neutralize it?That\u2019s why Feng Wu very silently, speechlessly looked up at the sky, but the vast sky full of stars was unable to read her mind.How could Yu Ming Ye know that this young girl before him was a true poison expert?He half squatted down poker faced, and quite gravely, quite seriously, threatened Feng Wu. \u201cI\u2019m asking you one thing, are you scared or not? !\u201dFeng Wu. \u201cScared\u2026\u2026\u201d Your ass!Yu Ming Ye observed Feng Wu\u2019s \u2018alive but as good as dead\u2019 face and thought that she\u2019d been frightened. He immediately felt extremely proud of himself!\u201cHa haha haha\u2014\u2014\u201d The young man put his hands on his hips, immensely proud of himself as he looked at the sky and let out a long laugh. \u201cThat\u2019s right, you should be scared! Therefore, you absolutely shouldn\u2019t think of betraying me, otherwise, you will die by the Ten Thousand Ants Soul Devouring Bone Breaking Heart Poisoning Pill!\u201dFeng Wu. \u201c\u2026\u2026woah.\u201dYu Ming Ye smugly and complacently harrumphed. \u201cAfter you return, make sure to steal the fluid from the Immortal Spirit Fruit for me, then fill it with poison, otherwise, \u2018humph\u2019!\u201dFeng Wu ground her teeth and pretended to look awkward. \u201cBut the Immortal Spirit Fruit has always been personally kept by Jun Lin Yuan, how can I get close to it?\u201dYu Ming Ye looked at Feng Wu as if he\u2019s looking at an idiot and flicked her as fair as jade forehead. \u201cYou think I\u2019m dead or something?\u201dFeng Wu retreated a step. \u201cBut\u2026\u2026but have you fought Jun Lin Yuan before? He\u2019s incredibly strong\u2026\u2026\u201dThis manipulative method of questioning was very effective. Feng Wu already sounded him out thoroughly.As expected, the minute Feng Wu brought this up, Yu Ming Ye became hopping mad as he pointed at Feng Wu. \u201cIs Jun Lin Yuan strong, is Jun Lin Yuan incredibly strong? Humph! I will become the man who\u2019s even stronger than him! Don\u2019t you believe me? !\u201dFeng Wu looked at him innocently, her eyes crystal clear and transparent. \u201cReally?\u201d\u201cOf course!\u201d Yu Ming Ye harrumphed. \u201cTen Thousand Ants Soul Devouring Bone Breaking Heart Poisoning Pill, don\u2019t you forget it!\u201dFeng Wu. \u201cOh\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cCome over here!\u201d Yu Ming Ye waved to Feng Wu.Feng Wu hesitated somewhat and didn\u2019t move forward, seemingly awfully terrified.\u201cI won\u2019t hurt you!\u201d Yu Ming Ye watched Feng Wu\u2019s terrified appearance as he beckoned impatiently. \u201cHurry and come over here, I\u2019ll tell you a plan!\u201d\u201cOh!\u201d Feng Wu\u2019s pair of as clear as water eyes immediately shined and ran over quite eagerly.Yu Ming Ye saw Feng Wu acting like an excited little puppy, and suddenly, his mouth twitched with curiosity. \u201cI thought that you\u2019d be more devoted to Jun Lin Yuan, tch tch, after you became my woman, your heart\u2019s indeed turned towards me now.

Even though Yu Ming Ye seemed to her to be both dumb and silly, when it came to serious business, his brains still worked very well. He deserved to be as equally well-known as Jun Lin Yuan. Actually, his reputation wasn\u2019t completely undeserved.\u201cCome here.\u201d Yu Ming Ye lifted the blanket with his foot, impatiently glaring at Feng Wu. \u201cStop dilly-dallying, the sun\u2019s about to come up.

Jun Lin Yuan, Feng Xun, and the rest were all sitting together. Judging by their expressions, Feng Xun was apparently arguing with them.Feng Wu and Yu Ming Ye immediately looked at each other in dismay!\u201cThey\u2019ve discovered that I\u2019m gone.\u201d Feng Wu glared at Yu Ming Ye and spoke seriously.If this is the case, then Yu Ming Ye\u2019s previous plan had become totally useless, because if Feng Wu disappeared, it\u2019d be very easy for her to be doubted and she wouldn\u2019t be able to get close to Jun Lin Yuan.Yu Ming Ye\u2019s eyes opened wide and unblinkingly glared at Feng Wu!He\u2019d wasted so much time on this girl, but the result was that his kidnapping of this girl was exposed? !Then wouldn\u2019t all of the time he\u2019d spent on this girl completely go to waste? !Yu Ming Ye panted with rage as he glared at Feng Wu. \u201cYou\u2019ve unexpectedly been found out? !\u201dFeng Wu discreetly rolled her eyes. \u201cAre you blaming me?\u201dYu Ming Ye angrily responded. \u201cSo what if I\u2019m blaming you? I am blaming you! Tell me, of what use are you now? !\u201dFeng Wu was dumbfounded. \u201cJust a trivial matter and it can make you this angry already?\u201d\u201cA trivial matter?\u201d Yu Ming Ye was almost angry enough to laugh. \u201cIs this really a trivial matter?\u201dJun Lin Yuan already discovered that she\u2019s missing, and already suspected her. She already could no longer get close to the fruit. All of his plans had fallen through at the final stretch\u2026\u2026\u201cWhen I raise my right hand, you guys can start the attack in accordance with our previous plan.\u201dCompared to the raging Yu Ming Ye, Feng Wu\u2019s expression was cool and collected. Her eyes were even more unperturbed and without any ripple, shining in the azure night sky.With one look, Yu Ming Ye\u2019s heart suddenly skipped a beat.This little girl\u2026\u2026this pair of eyes was too calm, too unperturbed. How\u2019s this like the terrified steamed bun (the wimp) she was before? Furthermore, her eyes were surprisingly so pretty, just like the brightest star in the sky, they simply made a person\u2019s heart extremely moved!Pah pah pah!Yu Ming Ye slapped his head. He unexpectedly was moved by this young girl with such ordinary looks? It must be an illusion! Illusion!The girl he was to like must not have looks inferior to him! Yu Ming Ye discreetly made a fist.And during this time, Feng Wu was rolling her body in the dew for awhile. After she wet all of her hair and clothes with some dew, she then left quickly with the blanket.In front of her, Feng Xun and Xuan Yi were arguing.Xuan Yi smiled coldly. \u201cAnd you\u2019re still saying that there\u2019s no problem with the little girl you picked up?

Where the hell did you go? Why did you disappear just now? Was it to go and pass on information? !\u201dFeng Wu turned towards Fairy Mu Yao with a confused and bewildered look, blinking those contrasting black and white, crystal clear eyes. \u201cI just went out for a bit.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you went to relieve yourself! We searched everywhere in the surrounding area, yet we didn\u2019t see you! Did you need to travel that far to go to take a leak?\u201d Fairy Mu Yao repeatedly questioned.Feng Wu was a faceful of innocence. \u201cI went to take a bath at the waterfall over the precipice located five kilometers from here.\u201dFairy Mu Yao didn\u2019t believe one word of it. \u201cThen why was it that when we yelled for you everywhere, you didn\u2019t respond?\u201d\u201cMaybe because the noise from the waterfall was too loud, so I couldn\u2019t hear you.\u201d Feng Wu replied with an innocent face. \u201cDid you really go to the waterfall and yell for me?\u201dFairy Mu Yao. \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dWhen facing Fairy Mu Yao, Feng Wu was relaxed and smooth. Facing Xuan Yi\u2019s gaze, she also could keep a hold of herself and stay cool-headed, but\u2014\u2014When that scorching hot gaze, just like an eagle fixing its gaze on her\u2014\u2014Feng Wu only felt that her mind suddenly shook as her heartbeat instantly sped up. Her brain blanked out even more and didn\u2019t know where her hands and feet should be placed\u2026\u2026Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s gaze was too penetrating.Looking straight through a person\u2019s heart!Feng Wu discreetly let out a breath and turned her head around. That pair of eyes as clear as water met with Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s.Four eyes facing each other flared just like a series of flames. Sparks flew as light rays shot out!Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s pair of sharp as eagle eyes looked straight at Feng Wu. Then he stood up, one hand placed behind his body, as he walked towards Feng Wu step by step.Finally, he stopped and stood before her, looking down at her from high above.Ever since she was little, Feng Wu had been taught by her master and had seen much more of the world compared to most people, yet when Jun Lin Yuan used this oppressive gaze to fix his attention on her, she still felt the palm of her hands sweating.What a scary, powerful pressure!It seemed as if in the next second, he could twist and \u2018kacha\u2019 break her neck.Shivers ran down Feng Wu\u2019s back.\u201cCrown Prince\u2026\u2026 Jun.\u201d Feng Wu fiercely ordered herself to calm down, as she raised her head to look straight at him.Jun Lin Yuan looked at Feng Wu attentively but didn\u2019t speak, however, his pair of eagle-like sharp eyes focused on Feng Wu. Suddenly, that as fair as jade right hand of his stretched towards her\u2014\u2014Feng Wu felt a kind of deadly aura, she only felt the hairs on her whole body stand up!Fine beads of sweat percolated her forehead!She couldn\u2019t retreat!If she retreated, then that proved that she lacked confidence. Therefore, not only could she not retreat, she must also face Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s gaze head on without evading.This was very difficult, very difficult\u2026\u2026Feng Xun wanted to step forward many times, but he was held back by Xuan Yi.Just when Feng Wu thought that Jun Lin Yuan was going to clutch her throat\u2014\u2014Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s clearly jointed fingers pinched a white magnolia flower petal.From Feng Wu\u2019s hair.Feng Wu stared blankly at Jun Lin Yuan, slowly letting out a breath\u2026\u2026There was a split second just now when a chill emitted from her neck. She really thought that Jun Lin Yuan was going to strike downward.Feng Wu glimpsed the pear-sized fragrant Immortal Spirit Fruit suspended from Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s waist\u2014\u2014This was the fruit that her heart longed for, the Immortal Spirit Fruit that she\u2019d watched over attentively for five years!(Blue Blossoms (BB): JLY took the fruit out of his locked jade box?)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Once she missed this chance, there wouldn\u2019t be a second one!That\u2019s why she must grasp it!Thinking of this\u2014\u2014Feng Wu\u2019s feet staggered and her body bumped into Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s. At the same time, she cried out in alarm. \u201cAah!\u201dBecause he was knocked against too suddenly, Jun Lin Yuan retreated several steps, and was surprisingly finally knocked to the ground by Feng Wu. Moreover, Feng Wu\u2019s body pressed on top of Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s body!Feng Wu didn\u2019t merely press on top of his body, their lips also collided.Two people, four eyes, faced each other\u2014\u2014Everybody around them stared blankly!Feng Xun\u2019s mouth opened wide. \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dXuan Yi\u2019s eyes stared wide. \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dFairy Mu Yao\u2019s entire body was stunned as she fell.Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s******iceberg like face, at this moment, also somewhat froze in place! For a period of time, he actually didn\u2019t react!Without any warning, his ears became pink. In an instant, his complexion turned red through and through!The first person to react was Feng Xun.Feng Xun saw this expression of Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s, and thought that he\u2019d become so angry that his face turned red. Feng Xun\u2019s heart was so spooked it nearly jumped out!A \u2018woah\u2019 escaped from his mouth as he rushed over and lifted Feng Wu, pulling her up abruptly. after which he then pushed her behind him!After that, everybody then reacted.Feng Xun rushed at Jun Lin Yuan and stammeringly tried to persuade him. \u201cBoss Jun, Little Fifth, she didn\u2019t mean it!

I know you\u2019ve always had mysophobia, but, but, but\u2026\u2026Little Fifth truly didn\u2019t do it on purpose, she, she, she\u2026\u2026how about you just forgive her. Boss\u2026\u2026\u201dThose dark red thin lips of Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s, along with his impenetrable expression and gloomy eyes, thinned even further as they were pursed slightly. His expression remained aloof and unfathomable.At precisely this time, Feng Wu raised her right hand!Boom\u2014\u2014A violent sound rocketed upwards!\u201cEnemy attack!\u201d Feng Xun cried out in alarm.Everybody turned to look towards the direction of the loud sound\u2014\u2013they only saw a blaze soar there, as a berserk power attacked towards them.\u201cYu Ming Ye\u2019s people!\u201d Feng Xun cried out in alarm.Yu Ming Ye brought three elders who charged at them in flight!Yu Ming Ye was like an artillery shell as he rushed straight towards Jun Lin Yuan, shouting loudly. \u201cJun Lin Yuan! Today, I\u2019ll have you know just who the hell I am!\u201dAfter he spoke, he and Jun Lin Yuan engaged each other!As soon as they saw each other the both of them would fight.Feng Wu was thinking of escaping, but Feng Xun was holding her hand the entire time. \u201cYou should stay behind me to hide and avoid being injured by them!\u201dFeng Wu\u2019s heart. \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dJust now, she\u2019d deliberately fall on Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s body and caught Jun Lin Yuan off guard.

As long as Feng Wu escaped, she will have succeeded!But for the sake of protecting her, Feng Xun grasped her hand tightly, using so much strength that the veins on the back of his hand popped.At this moment, Feng Wu\u2019s pair of contrasting black and white, clear, penetrating eyes looked complicatedly at Feng Xun\u2026\u2026Things having reached this point, yet Feng Xun still didn\u2019t know that she already stole the fluid from the Immortal Spirit Fruit.Yu Ming Ye was slowly, step by step, beaten into retreat by Jun Lin Yuan. Out of the corner of his eye, Yu Ming Ye shot a glance at Feng Wu\u2019s hand being grasped by Feng Xun. At once, his expression became abnormally unsightly!That ugly girl was actually his woman!Feng Xun surprisingly dared to grab her hand!Simply a blasphemy against the heavens!Yu Ming Ye promptly commanded the head elder who was rushing forward to save him. \u201cGo over there!\u201dThe head elder saw his Young Master getting beaten by Jun Lin Yuan, couldn\u2019t help but shake his head, yet he still turned to rush towards Feng Xun!Feng Xun was targeted by the head elder, making it difficult for him to keep protecting Feng Wu.\u201cRun!\u201d Feng Xun yelled loudly at Feng Wu!Feng Wu used a very complicated gaze to look at Feng Xun\u2026\u2026Within this entire team, the person she felt most apologetic towards was Feng Xun. [Once I\u2019ve recovered my strength, I\u2019ll certainly repay you, Elder Brother Feng Xun.] Feng Wu clenched her fists tightly. In the next second, her figure charged out as quick as lightning.No one noticed Feng Wu\u2019s disappearance. Even if they noticed it, they probably wouldn\u2019t have cared about it.Feng Wu ran, she ran the whole way through!Her goal was to descend the mountain, she must immediately descend the mountain!The Immortal Spirit Fruit\u2019s juice had already been drawn out, its spiritual qi was dissipating very quickly. She was afraid that before she could reach the foot of the mountain, its spiritual qi would\u2019ve already completely dissipated.Thinking of this, Feng Wu suddenly had a bright idea. Without delay, she transferred the fruit juice from the bag into the bottle. At the same time, within the Inverse Needle\u2019s bag, she introduced a kind of gluey, dense, aniseed aloe vera like juice.Judging from its appearance, the aniseed aloe vera juice and the Immortal Spirit Fruit\u2019s juice seemed the same, gluey, and dense, transparent and clear.Only after she\u2019s done making these preparations did Feng Wu relax somewhat.Looking at the thumb sized white jade bottle in her hand, Feng Wu exposed a knowing smile for the first time, her features bright and vibrant, in high spirits.Immortal Spirit Fruit, Immortal Spirit Fruit, once I descend the mountain with you and refine you into a Nine Reversal Spirit Pill, I could then restore my cultivation once more. The Feng family\u2019s fifth young lady\u2019s crippled cultivation is about to stage a comeback!And just at this time, a cold voice transmitted over. \u201cUgly girl, you actually run quite fast.\u201dFeng Wu\u2019s heart immediately badumped!Yu Ming Ye? !Her speed absolutely wouldn\u2019t be able to exceed Yu Ming Ye\u2019s. Since she was aware of this, how could Feng Wu dare to keep running? She silently turned her body around, directed a flattering smile towards Yu Ming Ye. \u201cSir Yu\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cSir Yu\u2026\u2026\u201d On Yu Ming Ye\u2019s pair of demonically charming romantic eyes appeared a sinister sneer as he picked up Feng Wu by her collar. \u201cYou dare to call me Sir Yu? !\u201d\u201cYoung, Young Master\u2026\u2026\u201d Feng Wu was lifted until both of her feet left the ground, struggling wildly.\u201cHumph!\u201d Yu Ming Ye\u2019s pair of vicious eyes glared at Feng Wu! His pretty eyes directly, directly focused on her. At the center of his pupils, two peaks of flames soared, burning violently!Looking towards Feng Wu\u2019s tender and beautiful, moist light red lips, the more Yu Ming Ye looked, the angrier he became!Suddenly, he lifted the sleeve of his robe and waved it at Feng Wu\u2014\u2014Was he going to hit her? ! Feng Wu\u2019s felt alarmed!However, before she had a chance to react, Yu Ming Ye\u2019s enchanting pink sleeve directly aimed at Feng Wu\u2019s mouth and wiped with astonishing strength.

I only did that for the sake of obtaining the Immortal Spirit Fruit\u2019s juice.\u201d Feng Wu was confident since reason was on her side. Moreover, who\u2019s Yu Ming Ye\u2019s girl? Wasn\u2019t that a title he gave her unilaterally?Yu Ming Ye smiled coldly. \u201cCouldn\u2019t you have used another method? Was this the only possible method?\u201dFeng Wu fiercely glared right back. \u201cThen wasn\u2019t this method the most simple and effective? Look, as a matter of fact, hasn\u2019t the juice been obtained?\u201dYu Ming Ye was so angry his complexion ashened. \u201cSince you wanted to kiss Jun Lin Yuan, that means that you like him. Even now, you still have him on your mind, isn\u2019t that right? Speak!\u201dFeng Wu was utterly exasperated as she looked from top to bottom, taking measure of Yu Ming Ye. Suddenly, an unbelievable question came out of her mouth. \u201cYu Ming Ye, you can\u2019t have truly fallen for me, right?\u201dOnce Yu Ming Ye heard that, his face flushed with redness, he then glared at Feng Wu panting with rage. \u201cWould I fall for such a fickle woman like you? ! What kind of a joke is that? !\u201d\u201cThen that\u2019s good, then that\u2019s good.\u201d Feng Wu comforted the pit of her stomach, gladness bursting forth.Yu MIng Ye was so angered his veins popped out as the pit of his stomach violently undulated.Yet Feng Wu was a picture of calm. \u201cSince you haven\u2019t fallen for me, and I also haven\u2019t fallen for you, then too bad there\u2019s no time now, let\u2019s not meet again~\u201dHaving said this, Feng Wu\u2019s figure leapt away as quick as lightning!Yu Ming Ye didn\u2019t expect that Feng Wu would surprisingly simply leave after saying that. At once, he was so enraged that his complexion was all the more ashen. \u201cYou dare to run? Come back!\u201dYu Ming Ye was so angry he wanted to give chase, however he miserably discovered that the base of his feet were apparently stuck to the ground like they were superglued. He simply couldn\u2019t raise his feet!Moreover, at present, the incomparably sticky substance already permeated the soles of his shoe, Yu Ming Ye originally wanted to take off his boots, but now, what was stuck wasn\u2019t merely his boots, but also both of his feet.This ugly girl! She actually schemed against him!When did she plant that unparalleled superglue? He surprisingly wasn\u2019t aware of it? !Yu Ming Ye felt a kind of humiliation from having been severely made a fool of by someone. He dashed behind Feng Wu and loudly bellowed. \u201cUgly girl! You still dare to run? ! Can it be that you\u2019ve forgotten about the Ten Thousand Ants Soul Devouring Bone Breaking Poisonous Heart Pill? Your heart will be penetrated by ten thousand poisons and die!\u201dHaving run away approximately a hundred meters, Feng Wu remained silent before she turned her head around and pulled a face at Yu Ming Ye. \u201cActually, Sir Yu fed me a starched laxative pill yet gave such a tyrannically overbearing name for it.\u201dA starched laxative pill? This ugly girl surprisingly already knew! She unexpectedly already knew early on that this was a medicine to clear the bowels? Therefore, she previously deliberately pretended not to know?Yu Ming Ye thought about how he previously threatened the other person in deadly earnest and suddenly felt a kind of feeling of himself having been super, super stupid\u2026\u2026simply destable!Yu Ming Ye was so angry he punched a tree. \u201cLittle Fifth, stop right there. When I catch you later, you\u2019ll be better off dead than alive!\u201dShe unexpectedly dared to trick him? This ugly girl borrowed her guts from the heavens!The soles of Feng Wu\u2019s feet smoked as she slipped away even more quickly! How could she dare to stop!\u201cArrgghh!\u201d Yu Ming Ye raged, face ashen, his wrath made him explode with two hundred percent of his strength as both legs struggled free from the unparalleled superglue, but at the same time, it also made his internal organs sustain injuries.

Feng Wu\u2019s gaze turned downwards and saw Yu Ming Ye\u2019s pair of bare feet and indistinct blood. Feng Wu\u2019s heart was immediately startled!Damn it! How much did Yu Ming Ye actually hate her? For the sake of overtaking her, he actually ignored internal injuries in order to regain unobstructed mobility!Stop?

Her pair of claws were even floundering as if she\u2019s parting waves.Yu Ming Ye watched the twisting, continually struggling Feng Wu while feeling quite smug inside.

She could be flexible with Yu Ming Ye, however, facing Jun Lin Yuan and Feng Xun\u2026\u2026once she thought of this, she felt a kind of confused awkwardness.That\u2019s why, Feng Wu psyched herself up to use her full strength to deal with Yu Ming Ye, in order to escape quickly.Thereupon, she very naively, very innocently asked. \u201cYoung Elder Brother Yu\u2026..is it possible\u2026\u2026to first put me down?\u201dThe little person in Yu Ming Ye\u2019s heart put his hands on his hips and laughed his head off.

Her body streaked across as quick as lightning, twisting her hips agilely from Yu Ming Ye\u2019s hand and leaped up towards the expansive river like a swimming fish.\u2018Splash\u2019 sounded\u2014\u2014At this time, Yu Ming Ye finally regained his senses.\u201cCough cough cough\u2014\u2014\u201dWhile he\u2019s coughing, he used some strength to wipe his face.But the chemical powder that Feng Wu scattered was too poisonous. His pair of eyes were poisoned such that they became red and swollen. Yu Ming Ye couldn\u2019t see clearly at present, however, he heard that splash sound out.It\u2019s too late to think about anything as Yu Ming Ye also jumped into the large river immediately after!Once the head elder saw this scene, he immediately felt anxious and lifted hand to grab Yu Ming Ye!However, Yu Ming Ye swatted away the head elder. \u201cDon\u2019t stop me! Today, I insist on overtaking that ugly girl no matter what!\u201dYu Ming Ye cursed in his heart!This ugly girl appeared so terrified and even called him Young Elder Brother Yu, yet the outcome! What a sinister mind! He, Yu Ming Ye, had never been swindled so badly by anyone before in his life!But once Yu Ming Ye entered the water, he knew it was bad!He didn\u2019t know what kind of poison the fine white powder that the ugly girl poured on his eyes was, but once they encountered the water, his eyes became scorchingly painful!The originally swollen eyes, swelled even more awfully at present. He simply couldn\u2019t open his eyes. Add to that his two constantly bleeding feet and the multitude of internal injuries\u2026\u2026Yu Ming Ye was immediately so angry he sobbed \u2018wah wah\u2019!In spite of the pain from his body, he rushed straight towards Feng Wu like an arrow!Feng Wu saw Yu Ming Ye coming towards her at high speed. Her heart became alarmed as she raised her hand and a white jade bottle smashed towards Yu Ming Ye\u2019s head. \u201cThe Immortal Spirit Fruit\u2019s juices, is that what you wanted? Take it!\u201dAs the white jade bottle smashed against Yu Ming Ye\u2019s forehead, Yu Ming Ye\u2019s mind already sensed its shadow, and he subconsciously dodged.Just like this, Feng Wu took advantage of this chance and instantly dived towards the river\u2019s bottom.From above the river, her figure couldn\u2019t be seen anymore, and just at this time, Jun Lin Yuan and company quickly arrived.\u201cYu Ming Ye!\u201d Feng Xun saw little Fifth sink into the water. He saw that Yu Ming Ye still even wanted to run away. He was so angry that his eyes became all red as he furiously roared. \u201cYu Ming Ye! You made my Little Fifth die!

As his whole face was splashed with the frothy water, his eyes stung so bad he couldn\u2019t even open them!Originally, he actually still had the chance to grab Feng Wu, but when he was interrupted by Feng Xun like that, the chance slipped away.Yu Ming Ye\u2019s heart screamed with anger!But what made him even angrier was!Feng Xun lifting his hand to grab Yu Ming Ye\u2019s collar without any trace of politeness and saying while grinding his teeth. \u201cYu Ming Ye, you bastard! What enmity did my Little Fifth have with you! You go so far as to kill her! I\u2019m going to kill you!\u201dHis voice hadn\u2019t dropped when Feng Xun lifted his hand, directly made a fist aimed at Yu Ming Ye\u2019s nose, and let loose at once!Pow!Pitiful Yu Ming Ye. He was already too miserably harmed by Feng Wu, both feet wounded, eyes wounded, internal injuries still quite serious\u2026\u2026to the extent that he couldn\u2019t dodge. That high and straight bridge of his nose was immediately met with a fist.It wasn\u2019t that the head elder didn\u2019t go to save him. The head elder was barred by Jun Lin Yuan.Yu Ming Ye was furious!That ugly girl swindled him to suffer such bitterness. He hadn\u2019t been able to do anything, yet now, Feng Xun, this little bastard, unexpectedly said that he made that ugly girl die? That ugly girl clearly had escaped, ok? !Yet, could Yu Ming Ye speak the truth?He couldn\u2019t!Because he would rather die than be willing to have three people know that he\u2019d been tricked so embarrassingly, because this concerned his dignity as a man!Thus, Yu Ming Ye didn\u2019t say anything further and fought back against Feng Xun.\u201cYou\u2019re fighting me? What big nerves!\u201d\u201cYou dared to kill my Little Fifth. Pay with your life!\u201dSlam slam slam!Originally, Feng Xun wasn\u2019t a match for Yu Ming Ye, but Yu Ming Ye\u2019s strength had been reduced by Feng Wu\u2019s tricks, to the extent that the two surprisingly fought to a draw.Afterwards, it was Jun Lin Yuan who angrily shouted. \u201cStop!\u201dThus, everybody stopped in the next second. Furthermore, after rapidly retreating, two big groups of people took shape.Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s faction and Yu Ming Ye\u2019s faction.After Feng Xun separated himself from Yu Ming Ye, the first thing he did was to enter the river to look for a body, however\u2026\u2026how was there even a shadow of Feng Wu left? Even a strip of cloth was nowhere to be found. The rim of Feng Xun\u2019s eyes suddenly became red!During this time, Yu Ming Ye\u2019s eyes became much better. He saw Feng Xun\u2019s expression and coldly smiled and harrumphed!At this moment, Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s pair of good-looking sword shaped eyebrows slightly knitted as he looked at the Immortal Spirit Fruit in his hand, deep eyes, profound and unfathomable\u2026\u2026Yu Ming Ye\u2019s mouth curved like a smile yet did not smile. \u201cCrown Prince Jun, you finally now see that there\u2019s a problem with the Immortal Spirit Fruit? Tch tch tch, that power of observation of yours is no longer so great.\u201dJun Lin Yuan\u2019s dark eyes half narrowed dangerously.The fruit was inside the white jade box. Jun Lin Yuan indeed was never aware that something was wrong with it, until just a moment ago when he saw Feng Wu\u2019s figure disappear\u2026\u2026he felt it to be strange and examined the Immortal Spirit Fruit a bit, before discovering that there was a problem.Feng Xun saw Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s complexion become unsightly and asked at once. \u201cBoss Jun, what is it? Isn\u2019t the fruit in your hands? What problem can there be?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a good question, ha haha\u2014\u2014\u201d The anger caused by Feng Wu immediately faded away after Yu Ming Ye heard this question from Feng Xun. He put his hands on his hips, immensely proud of himself, as he shot Jun Lin Yuan a glance. \u201cAren\u2019t you the omnipotent Crown Prince Jun? Can there still be something wrong with the Immortal Spirit Fruit while it\u2019s in your hands? Ha ha ha\u2014\u2014\u201dJun Lin Yuan\u2019s complexion became more and more difficult to look at.\u201cBoss Jun?\u201d Feng Xun stared blankly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

My words weren\u2019t wrong, right? There\u2019s something wrong with the Immortal Spirit Fruit, right? Ha haha\u2014\u2014\u201dFeng Xun was just about to step forward and argue with Yu Ming Ye, but saw Jun Lin Yuan restrain his own complexion as he stared at the Immortal Spirit Fruit which looked like white jade, dense brows knitting slightly. \u201cThere\u2019s indeed a problem with the fruit.\u201d\u201cWhat? Feng Xun was alarmed, and almost jumped up. \u201cHow can there be a problem with the Immortal Spirit Fruit? This fruit\u2026\u2026could it be that the fruit we picked from the cliff was fake?\u201dEveryone turned towards Jun Lin Yuan.However, Jun Lin Yuan faintly shook his head, his eyes cold and severe. \u201cThat\u2019s not it.\u201dFeng Xun anxiously said. \u201cBut, ever since it was plucked from the top of the cliff, the Immortal Spirit Fruit has always been in your hands, you\u2019re Jun Lin Yuan, is it possible that this thing could be stolen by someone, can that be? This is simply an impossibility.\u201dJun Lin Yuan\u2019s silhouette hidden in depth, clear pupils, the cold light in his eyes just like an unsheathed sword, he coldly stated. \u201cNot stolen away.\u201d\u201cNot stolen away? Then what is it?\u201d The bewildered Feng Xun didn\u2019t understand.Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s pure thin lips curved into a mysterious arc as he threw the Immortal Spirit Fruit towards Feng Xun.Feng Xun\u2019s pair of hands caught it without delay, he looked at it left and right, yet didn\u2019t discover anything wrong with this Immortal Spirit Fruit. Wasn\u2019t this the fruit they plucked at the top of the overhanging cliff?Until Feng Xun used his hand to pinch, sss\u2014\u2014A stream of water squeezed out from inside the fruit!As he was caught off guard, Feng Xun\u2019s face got sprayed.\u201cHa haha\u2014\u2014\u201d At the moment Yu Ming Ye saw Feng Xun face wet from being sprayed, he put his hands on his hips at once, haha ha his laughter sounded out. He pointed at Feng Xun and laughed so hard he had difficulty breathing. \u201cHa haha, you\u2019re done for\u2026\u2026you\u2019re dead for sure\u2026\u2026you\u2019ve been poisoned\u2026\u2026ha haha\u2014\u2014\u201dPoisoned? ! Feng Xun was frightened and threw the Immortal Spirit Fruit to the ground without delay, jumping quite a few meters away!However, when he felt his own face, there seemed to be no difference\u2026\u2026He looked at the wetness in his hand, furrowing his eyebrows. \u201cIsn\u2019t this water? What\u2019s with the poison? Yu Ming Ye, you tricked me!\u201dFinished speaking, Feng Xun again wanted to charge over and pit his life against Yu Ming Ye!Yu Ming Ye haha howled with laughter. \u201cWater? Ha haha\u2014\u2014Feng Xun, are you an idiot? This is water? Haha ha, this is clearly the Wail Like Ghosts and Howl Like Wolves Soul Breaking Corpse Poison! After being poisoned, your skin will fester and corrode until you die. Haha ha\u2014\u2014\u201dHowever, it was exceptionally peaceful all around as everyone used a kind of very strange gaze to look at Yu Ming Ye.Yu Ming Ye\u2019s laughter then became silent and he seemed to appear quite awkward.He saw Feng Xun\u2019s totally clear face and his laughter spontaneously came to an end.That\u2019s not right!\u201cInside this Immortal Spirit Fruit, could it be, it ought to have been the Wail Like Ghosts and Howl Like Wolves Soul Breaking Corpse Poison, right? Why are you\u2026..you\u2019re fine? !\u201d Yu Ming Ye\u2019s complexion became ashened in an instant as he disbelievingly stared at Feng Xun.Feng Xun faced him and rolled his eyes. \u201cWail Like Ghosts and Howl Like Wolves Soul Breaking Corpse Poison? Your brain must be ill!\u201d\u201cNo, it clearly should\u2019ve been\u2026\u2026\u201d Yu Ming Ye attempted to explain, however\u2014\u2014At this moment, Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s pair of clear eyes half narrowed dangerously, that pair of eagle like sharp and bitingly cold eyes, darkly fixed on Yu Ming Ye.Yu Ming Ye\u2019s brains clattered at once\u2014\u2014He instantly became aware of the things he shouldn\u2019t have said, subconsciously, he covered his mouth as widely opened eyes stared at the ground!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s greatest rival, how could he retreat? Thinking of this, Yu Ming Ye kept his head high and chest out, and with great effort, glared back at Jun Lin Yuan!Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s gaze was serene and hidden in depth, dangerously and maliciously fixed on Yu Ming Ye.Yu Ming Ye was taken back and shivered from those bitingly cold, sharp, deep eyes, his throat chilled, he forced himself to be calm. \u201cRight! That\u2019s right! Don\u2019t tell me that there isn\u2019t poison inside? ! It should be poison!\u201dYu Ming Ye looked immensely proud of himself. \u201cInside there, actually, I had the ugly girl insert the Wail Like Ghosts and Howl Like Wolves Soul Breaking Corpse poison, haha ha\u2014\u2014Jun Lin Yuan, hah, Jun Lin Yuan, you didn\u2019t know? That ugly girl has already been instigated by me to rebel! She\u2019s already mine! I wanted her to steal the fruit juice, so she quickly obediently did so. I wanted her to put poison inside, so she inserted poison inside the Immortal Spirit fruit. She listens to me so well!\u201dYu Ming Ye placed his hands on his hips. \u201cYou guys want to know how I instigated her? Ha haha, actually it\u2019s very simple, I only had to tell her one thing, as long as she follows me, Yu Ming Ye, I will marry her, make her my concubine, and give her status, this ugly girl couldn\u2019t resist the attraction, and immediately rushed to my side, not hesitating to \u2018go through water and tread on fire\u2019 on my behalf, ha haha\u2014\u2014\u201dThe head elder silently shot a glance towards Yu Ming Ye who\u2019s laughing as he faced the sky. The elder couldn\u2019t bear looking at Yu Ming Ye\u2019s face\u2026\u2026did the wound on Young Master\u2019s eyes truly not hurt? Yu Ming Ye was still full of himself. \u201cThis kind of spy costing nothing, why wouldn\u2019t I want her, therefore, I reluctantly accepted her, and after that, I had her steal the fruit juice. Furthermore, I had her inject the poison back into the fruit, ha haha. Feng Xun, hey, Feng Xun, this life of yours is indeed held within the palm of my hands!\u201dFeng Xun\u2019s dark eyebrows were knit tightly at the moment as he rushed forward and once again grabbed Yu Ming Ye\u2019s collar. \u201cWho are you calling the ugly girl?\u201d\u201cFeng Xun, you idiot, things having reached this stage and you\u2019re still deceiving yourself? Who\u2019s the ugly girl? The ugly girl\u2019s that Little Fifth you keep yelling about.\u201d Yu Ming Ye was extremely pleased with himself as he beamingly watched Feng Xun attentively. \u201cDo you understand now? Little Fifth Feng is one of my people! Mine, Yu Ming Ye\u2019s girl!\u201d\u201cPow!\u201d Feng Xun raised his hand and punched Yu Ming Ye!Yu Ming Ye retreated a step, and avoided that violently strong wind, however, his brows slightly pursed. \u201cHow can you still move? You truly haven\u2019t been poisoned? That\u2019s impossible!\u201dAll of a sudden, Yu Ming Ye stared rigidly at Jun Lin Yuan. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you already discovered something wrong with the Immortal Spirit Fruit early on, and changed out the poison inside?\u201dJun Lin Yuan\u2019s thin and pure lips slightly curved upwards. \u201cI did not.\u201d\u201cThen how? !\u201d Yu Ming Ye suddenly felt a very uncomfortable feeling.Jun Lin Yuan didn\u2019t answer him, on the contrary, as the waves of light moved in his eyes, he suddenly levelly asked a question. \u201cYour wounded eyes, what happened?\u201dYu Ming Ye was feeling immensely proud of himself, yet this question was like a basin of cold water thrown at his face, the cold penetrating into his heart.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Look, what\u2019s this!\u201dYu Ming Ye smugly raised the white porcelain bottle in his hand.Previously, when that ugly girl was nearly captured by him, in order to escape, she took the bottle of Immortal Spirit Fruit and smashed it towards him. At once, it was caught in Yu Ming Ye\u2019s hand.Yu Ming Ye was immensely proud of himself as he spoke. \u201cJun Lin Yuan, hey, Jun Lin Yuan, don\u2019t you usually consider yourself to be omnipotent, with unequalled strength? Ha haha, the result is that you\u2019ve been tricked by an ugly girl, not merely tricked, you\u2019ve even been kissed ha haha\u2014\u2014\u201dYu Ming Ye laughed and laughed. Abruptly, he couldn\u2019t laugh anymore, because he suddenly realized that the ugly girl kissed Jun Lin Yuan, she-kissed- Jun- Lin-Yuan!And at this moment, Feng Xun\u2019s entire body was as if it\u2019s been struck by lightning, expressionless, staring blankly on the spot.Little Fifth\u2026\u2026Little Fifth was unexpectedly\u2026\u2026at the time, she, she was deliberate? She purposely knocked over Boss Jun, kissed him, caught him off guard in order to steal the Immortal Spirit Fruit\u2019s juice?Feng Xun\u2019s entire body was stupefied!He thought about how he treated Little Fifth with concern throughout this entire journey, thought about how he defended her, thought about how he justified her in all sorts of ways\u2026\u2026\u201cDidn\u2019t I say it! Little Fifth was a spy, Little Fifth was a spy, Little Fifth was a spy!\u201d This important point was stated three times. Fairy Mu Yao was finally able to blow of steam as she glared at Feng Xun panting with rage. \u201cHow many times did I say it? During this entire journey I\u2019d repeated it, Little Fifth is a spy! Yet you guys, each and everyone of you believed her and didn\u2019t believe me! Is the outcome clear now? You\u2019ve been tricked by her, right? !\u201dFairy Mu Yao accusingly glared at Feng Xun. \u201cEspecially you, you defended her so much throughout this whole journey, yet how did she treat you? She betrayed us. Was she even kindhearted in the slightest? Feng Xun, it turns out that there\u2019s also a time when you\u2019re this stupid!\u201dFeng Xun already blamed himself inwardly. Add to that the rebuke and condemnation from Fairy Mu Yao, and he was suddenly his anger exploded!\u201cArrgghh! ! !\u201d Feng Xun was so angry his clenched fist punched at the tree beside him that was so large three people together couldn\u2019t wrap their arms around it!Kapow\u2014\u2014The ancient tree cried out as it fell.Yu Ming Ye watched Feng Xun\u2019s unbearable anger, and became increasingly satisfied. \u201cHaha ha, Feng Xun, hey, Feng Xun, so what if you\u2019re angry now? Little Fifth is actually my person, but in the end, you surprisingly said that I caused her death? Ha haha how stupid can you be?\u201dFeng Xun\u2019s pair of scarlet eyes fiercely glared at Yu Ming Ye. \u201cWhen I came previously, what I saw was that you chased after her to kill her in the river, I was absolutely not mistaken!\u201dYu Ming Ye was naturally talking big, Little Fifth was instigated into rebelling by him, he couldn\u2019t just slap himself now. Even if it was a needle, he currently still had to swallow it.Consequently, Yu Ming Ye, who\u2019s sensitive to how others regarded him, coldly laughed. \u201cThose eyes of yours saw that I was chasing to kill her in the river? Indeed, I knew that you guys were arriving, therefore, I let her escape first! Feng Xun, you\u2019re really dumb!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fake.\u201d Jun Lin Yuan suddenly opened his mouth.Yu Ming Ye glared at Jun Lin Yuan and spoke panting with rage. \u201cHehe, you think that I\u2019m lying? Jun Lin Yuan, I\u2019m telling you! Every single one of my statements are true, Little Fifth is indeed mine\u2026\u2026\u201dWithout waiting for Yu Ming Ye to finish, Jun Lin Yuan pointed at the white porcelain bottle in Yu Ming Ye\u2019s hand, and calmly said. \u201cIt\u2019s fake.\u201dYu Ming Ye\u2019s expression stiffened in a flash and became extremely unsightly!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However within the group, there\u2019s still Fairy Mu Yao\u2014\u2014The pitiful Fairy Mu Yao. Originally, on account of Feng Wu\u2019s matter, she was so happy she clenched her fist, unable to verbally express her excitement, her mind was stuffed to the max with accusations to weave against that ugly girl.She was engrossed with her thoughts.

In the end, he still fell for the same, identical trick again!Falling once was bad luck. Falling twice, that\u2019s just plain stupidity!Yu Ming Ye\u2019s complexion alternated between red and green, covered in a dark cloud, exceptionally unsightly!Fairy Mu Yao\u2019s face rapidly became inflamed into a lump. That symptom was very much identical to the symptom on Yu Ming Ye\u2019s face, to the extent that, Feng Xun instantly blurted. \u201cYu Ming Ye, your eyes were also injured by this white fine powder, right? !\u201dYu Ming Ye. \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAt this time, Feng Xun\u2019s brain started operating especially well as he slapped his thigh. \u201cThat\u2019s right!

It\u2019s just too funny haha haha ha\u2014\u2014\u201dYu Ming Ye really wanted to beat somebody up!Xuan Yi, who\u2019d always maintained a straight face, knit his brows, and spoke in deadly earnest. \u201cJust now, didn\u2019t you say that Little Fifth is your girl?\u201d\u201cPffft\u2014\u2014\u201d Feng Xun laughed until tears flowed, he held his belly \u2018owwy ow\u2019 and continued to laugh. \u201cThis is killing me, ow my god, how am I going to stop?

However, after finding out about Yu Ming Ye\u2019s experience, he unexpectedly felt that his mood became much better.\u201cFeng, Xun, you, shut, up!\u201d Yu Ming Ye\u2019s eyes were congested with blood, scarlet glaring at Feng Xun!One of Feng Xun\u2019s hand was holding his painfully throbbing belly, the other was wiping away the tears from the corners of his eyes. \u201cOwwy, Yu Ming Ye, hey, Yu Ming Ye, tell me why you\u2019re so sensitive about how others regard you? You\u2019ve clearly been tricked by that girl, yet you surprisingly still lied to us saying that you let her escape first? I pfft\u2014\u2014\u201dIt wasn\u2019t merely Feng Xun who\u2019s laughing, almost everyone on his side were roaring with laughter.Yu Ming Ye flew into a rage out of humiliation. \u201cYou guys laugh your asses off!

The victory fruit was seized by Little Fifth, that lone girl\u2014\u2014Everyone became quiet, taciturn, silent\u2026\u2026Yu Ming Ye glared at Feng Xun. Feng Xun glared at Yu Ming Ye, the two of them were mutually hostile, ready to fight at any time.Finally, it\u2019s still Feng Xun who stood down first.He glared at Yu Ming Ye. \u201cIf I wasn\u2019t anxious to find Little Fifth, I\u2019d no doubt insist on fighting you today!\u201dYu Ming Ye harrumphed coldly. \u201cCome then, come then, come fight then.\u201dFeng Xun impatiently waved his hand. \u201cNo time!\u201dSoon after, Feng Xun then turned towards Jun Lin Yuan and made a fist seriously and gravely. \u201cBoss Jun, I must find Little Fifth Feng! I must find her!\u201dFeng Xun just wanted to personally ask her one thing, did she have a conscience? !Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s expression was profoundly mysterious. With his usual ice-coldness, he uttered an \u2018mm hm\u2019. \u201cGo.\u201dFinished speaking, he took the lead and left.Feng Xun shot a ferocious glare at Yu Ming Ye, and also quickly left.Xuan Yi blocked Fairy Mu Yao, whose face was wounded, his expression ice-cold. Follow closely behind me.Looking at their quickly departing figures, Yu Ming Ye made a fist panting with rage. \u201cThis Little Fifth, wait until I catch her, I must ruthlessly give her a spanking for sure! She surprisingly dared to play tricks on this master!\u201d\u201cYoung Master\u2026\u2026don\u2019t tell me that you don\u2019t want to kill her?\u201d The head elder was somewhat puzzled.This wasn\u2019t like his young master\u2019s usual style. Their young master\u2019s character, in fact, was the vicious and merciless type who smiled demonically charmingly and enchantingly while the point of his knife entered the enemy\u2019s heart. Presently, he\u2019s been tricked in this way by that girl, yet surprisingly only harrumphed menacingly twice?It\u2019s unlikely that he\u2019d been angered dumb by that girl, right? Thinking of this, the head elder couldn\u2019t help but take another glance at Yu Ming Ye.\u201cStop loitering!\u201d Yu Ming Ye glared at the head elder. \u201cLet\u2019s go already! Why don\u2019t you guys psych yourselves up for me, and don\u2019t let Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s people find that ugly girl first! Even if it\u2019s to kill her, I\u2019ll be the one to personally kill her!\u201dSeeing their young master roaring fiercely while his heart was soft, the head elder silently ridiculed him. \u201cYoung Master shouldn\u2019t be reluctant to allow Young Master Feng Xun to reach that ugly girl\u2026\u2026right?\u201d\u201cShut up!\u201d Yu Ming Ye flew into a rage out of humiliation and glared at the head elder, very angrily!\u201cWoah\u2026\u2026\u201d The head elder took a step back.As Yu Ming Ye panted with rage while following along the river and searching its lower reaches, he stroked his chin ponderingly, sinking into a profound silence.It\u2019s rare to see such an expression from their young master, thus, the meddlesome head elder, who cared greatly for his young master, couldn\u2019t help but stretch his neck out again and ask fearlessly. \u201cIs the Young Master thinking of something again? How about you say it out loud and allow us lend you a helping hand?\u201dThe eighth and ninth elders standing by the side simultaneously nodded.\u201cThat\u2019s strange.\u201d A baffled Yu Ming Ye rubbed his chin, a face full of suspicions. \u201cI\u2019ve been feeling that there\u2019s something odd about Jun Lin Yuan\u2026\u2026but I can\u2019t figure it out, what in the world\u2019s odd about him\u2026\u2026\u201dThe head elder quietly said. \u201cCrown Prince Jun\u2019s used to being calm and self possessed, an iceberg face even after ten thousand years, profoundly mysterious.

I was also angered to the point of crying \u2018wah wah\u2019, but Jun Lin Yuan, he surprisingly didn\u2019t get angry! Was this not odd? !\u201dThe head elder silently glanced at his young master, teasing him in his mind [So it turns out the Young Master also knew that he was angered to the point of crying \u2018wah wah\u2019?]\u201cHead Elder! Answer me!\u201d Noticing that he head elder\u2019s mind wandered, Yu Ming Ye was very angry.Head elder. \u201cEh.\u201dYu Ming Ye was pleased and continued to rub his chin, speaking as he walked. \u201cLet us hypothesize why Jun Lin Yuan isn\u2019t angry. Firstly, this person may be furious, but won\u2019t show it, to the extent of Gods and Buddhas. Be it any person or matter, they won\u2019t stir any waves within him. However, this isn\u2019t right.\u201dThe head elder, eighth elder, and ninth eder simultaneously turned towards their young master, looking at each other in dismay again. Their young master surprisingly wanted to use his brain?Yu Ming Ye inspected the area before him, eyes half narrowed, as he very seriously shook his head. \u201cNot right, not right, if Jun Lin Yuan truly was completely calm without a ripple like Gods and Buddhas, without desires and without demands, then why did he rush over to such distant parts from the capital, to these Northern Territories to fight over an Immortal Spirit Fruit? It could clearly be seen that the Immortal Spirit Fruit was extraordinarily important to him!\u201dAs Yu Ming Ye was speaking, he shot a glance at the elders.The head elder uttered several \u2018mm mm mm\u2019 as he nodded wildly.Yu Ming Ye was very pleased and continued to rub his chin as he analyzed. \u201cIn addition, the method that the ugly girl used to seize the Immortal Spirit Fruit\u2019s juice was so shameless, she went so far as to forcibly take away Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s kiss! On the basis of Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s obsession with cleanliness, don\u2019t tell me that he shouldn\u2019t have slapped that ugly girl into minced meat. Yet he didn\u2019t at all! Moreover, who\u2019s Jun Lin Yuan? He\u2019s actually the Crown Prince Jun who\u2019s never been defeated before! He unexpectedly isn\u2019t angry? Tell me, isn\u2019t that quite strange?\u201d\u201cTherefore, Young Master, your conclusion is?\u201d The three elders simultaneously turned towards Yu Ming Ye.Yu Ming Ye raised his chin and coldly harrumphed once. \u201cTherefore, my conclusion is, Jun Lin Yuan likes that ugly girl!\u201dThe head elder was so disgusted he shivered. \u201cYoung Master, you shouldn\u2019t joke around, what kind of a person is Crown Prince Jun? He\u2019s the gifted, outstanding beyond compare, heaven defying genius whose power overflows the heavens, Crown Prince Jun. Can he fall for that\u2026\u2026ugly girl? Is he blind?\u201dYu Ming Ye furiously glared at the head elder, clenched his fists tightly, and wanted to retort, but. \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d He couldn\u2019t find a single word to say.\u201cLook for her. Look for her!\u201d Yu MIng Ye impatiently waved his hand.\u201cBut Young Master, Icebound Forest is so big, where should we go to find her?\u201d\u201cFollow Jun Lin Yuan!\u201d Yu Ming Ye said without cheer. \u201cDoesn\u2019t he have a very smart brain? Follow him and we\u2019ll inevitably find that ugly girl!\u201dAnd at this moment\u2014\u2014After Feng Wu kicked Yu Ming Ye flying, she speedily dived into the river floor, followed the undercurrent at the river floor and charged towards its lower reaches straight through.Feng Wu understood very clearly that Jun Lin Yuan and Yu Ming Ye will undoubtedly go all-out to chase and kill her. Therefore, she didn\u2019t dare to stop. Hugging a floating block of wood, she drifted down\u2026\u2026When she reached the mouth of a three way fork, Feng Wu quickly climbed ashore.\u201cImmortal Spirit Fruit, at last, Immortal Spirit Fruit.\u201d Feng Wu looked at the transparent juice within the white jade bottle as the corners of her mouth rose faintly. The corners of her eyes and tip of her brows both carried a smiling expression. \u201cThere\u2019s no way to refine pills on the mountain. Once I reach the base of the mountain, I\u2019ll immediately refine the Nine Spirit Reversal Pill.

Out of everyone, Feng Wu only felt guilty towards him.\u201cBrother Feng Xun, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Feng Wu grasped the spirit juice tightly, silently apologizing in her heart. \u201cI want to restore my cultivation, and want to see my beautiful master wake even more. That\u2019s why, this Immortal Spirit Fruit\u2019s spirit juice, I have to have it!\u201dFeng Wu rubbed the Dragon Phoenix Spirit Ring on the forefinger of her right hand, her soul automatically entered inside.Inside the Dragon Phoenix Spirit Ring, Feng Wu only partitioned a very small corner for storing her own things, most of the rest of the space was empty.In the center was a very spacious ice-cold white jade bed.On the white jade bed lay a snowy white clothed statuesque, fair and tall, cold and solitary, out of this world, godlike silhouette.Feng Wu came before the bed in a few steps, both knees kneeled on the ground, her back straight and erect, gazing unblinkingly at that exceptional appearance almost within reach.\u201cMaster\u2026\u2026\u201d Feng Wu gazed at the beautiful master\u2019s tightly closed eyes.His flesh was brighter than snow, smooth and soft, graceful and noble, pure and holy like an immortal from heaven.Outside, no matter how arduous, no matter how dangerous it was, her tears hadn\u2019t ever fallen, however, the moment she saw her beautiful master, Feng Wu\u2019s eyes became red and shed grievous tears.\u201cMaster, wait for me.\u201d Feng Wu allowed her teardrops to fall as she clenched her fists tightly. \u201cAfter I\u2019ve descended this mountain, I\u2019ll surely be able to refine the Nine Reversal Spirit Pill, wait for me to cultivate again, wait for me to activate my True Phoenix Blood. You\u2019ll then be able to wake, right?\u201dIn reality, Feng Wu\u2019s main reason for stealing the Immortal Spirit Fruit wasn\u2019t to enable her own cultivation, but rather, only by regaining her cultivation could there be a possibility for her to bring back her master.That\u2019s why, not to mention offending Jun Lin Yuan, or feeling sorry towards Feng Xun, even if she offended everyone in the whole world, she\u2019d still have to obtain this Immortal Spirit Fruit!Feng Wu believed that in this life of hers until death, she wouldn\u2019t be able to forget that uniquely captivating and stunning scene when her beautiful master appeared!When she was three years old, their destinies crossed by chance when she triggered the Dragon Phoenix Spirit Ring.White magnolia petals floating profusely, just like purified, holy floating snow.Beautiful master tread gently on the breeze, stepping slowly out of the Dragon Phoenix Spirit Ring.White clothes whiter than snow, sleeves fluttering naturally.Long body graceful as jade, out of this word solitary coldness.Azure sky, tall green trees, petals fluttering profusely like floating snowflakes, birds spiraling joyfully in the sky.Certainly, once he appeared, heaven and earth\u2019s, sun and moon\u2019s brilliance converged on him, everything else lost its luster, withered, dried out. Only he was the center of the entire world.He crouched down, snow white wide sleeves on the snow white robe folded layer upon layer on the ground as that pair of deep and profound, self-controlled breathtaking eyes gazed at the little girl before him.A three year old with short hair gathered into two small ponytails by each ear, with delicate and exquisite facial features yet to mature. Her tender snow white skin, with two white pouting, pudgy round cheeks, like steamed buns that would deflate if jabbed.Mu Jiu Zhou was accustomed to being high and cold, pure and noble, yet at this moment, he couldn\u2019t help but extend a slender, distinctly jointed forefinger and poke at the little stuffed-bun-like face.Who would\u2019ve thought that the chubby little girl would utter an \u2018ow\u2019 as the soft and squishy round little body, as if in slow motion, fell on her butt.Unlike other children who might\u2019ve wailed, the little girl\u2019s mochi like little fleshy hand rubbed her buttocks as that pair of limpid, pure pretty big eyes turned unblinkingly towards him, emitting magical rays of light!So adorable. The elevated and cold Mu Jiu Zhou laughed gently.This one laugh of his, seemed as if made the entire world brighter.Little Feng Wu was blown away by his expression and regained her senses only with much difficulty.

He, who was used to being reserved and dignified actually laughed softly. \u201cThen is this little girl willing to pay respect to me as your master?\u201dHis body gave off the world\u2019s cleanest smell, so noble that he couldn\u2019t be defiled.On his entire body lingered the sweet scent of plants, fresh and clean. It made a person can\u2019t help but want to approach him and approach closer.Little Feng Wu excitedly clenched her little fists, but she still very reservedly asked. \u201cAre you, very powerful?\u201dMu Jiu Zhou stood up, his long body graceful as jade, his pair of hands held behind him, as the wide sleeves on the flowing robe hung by the side of his body filled with transcendent vast qi, just like the gods.With her short legs, Little Feng Wu found it difficult to look up at his face, and only felt that this young man was noble and dignified, boundlessly powerful, as if the entire world was within his control.Mu Jiu Zhou lowered his head and looked at little Feng Wu, speaking absent-mindedly. \u201cLittle girl, my name is Mu Jiu Zhou, Jiu Zhou as in \u2018Nine States\u2019, the same as Nine States Continent.\u201dLittle Feng Wu. \u201cWow, you have the same name as our continent! How domineering!\u201dMu Jiu Zhou crouched down, his hands supporting the little short girl\u2019s lotus root like arm, as his dazzling bright star-like eyes gazed at her levelly. \u201cNine States Continent\u2019s name, was named after your master, understand?\u201dAt the time, little Feng Wu didn\u2019t understand, however, she understood later.Her beautiful master once was this continent\u2019s supreme ruler. However, he fell and became a soul inside her Dragon Phoenix Spirit Ring.Feng Wu had previously asked how this happened, but master mysteriously told her to wait and she\u2019ll know after she grew up.Feng Wu knew that there certainly was a heart-rending story involving a thousand wounds behind this. However, her strength needed to be acknowledged by her master before she could learn of this secret past.Suddenly, Feng Wu laughed bitterly, how did her thoughts wander so far away? The top priority now was to descend this mountain, refine the Nine Reversals Spirit Pill, then wake her master, then afterwards\u2026\u2026\u201cMaster\u2026\u2026\u201d Towards that noble and pure, spiritless, solitary figure on the cold icy white jade bed, Feng Wu kowtowed, kowtowed again, and consecutively kowtowed a third time, banging her head on the ground before she reluctantly got up, turning her head around with each step she took, she left the Dragon Phoenix Spirit Ring.After she left the ring, Feng Wu then sped along rapidly down the mountain!She understood extremely well that Jun Lin Yuan and Yu Ming Ye\u2019s people would surely look for her, and would spare no effort, regardless of everything, to hunt her down!If she was any other person, it\u2019d certainly be difficult to run away from their net, however, since Feng Wu could snatch the fruit juice from their hands, she naturally wouldn\u2019t be captured by them so easily.During these five years, Feng Wu had already thoroughly familiarized herself with the Icebound Forest region, as a result, she noiselessly searched for a small meandering trail, and quietly exited Icebound Forest\u2026\u2026Feng Wu finally returned to Northern Territories\u2019 city walls!Seeing the lofty, grand city wall, seeing the three words on the city gate tower: Northern Territory City, Feng Wu excitedly clenched her fists.She\u2019d returned!She\u2019d finally returned safe and sound!After she entered the city, Feng Wu actually didn\u2019t immediately return home, she nimbly changed her clothes and restored her looks to that of the Feng family\u2019s fifth daughter.\u201cEh? Miss Fifth Feng\u2014\u2014\u201d Just when Feng Wu walked out from the alley corner, someone waved their hand to greet Feng Wu.It was Younger Uncle\u2019s wife (father\u2019s younger brother\u2019s wife) carrying a basket in her hand.\u201cAunt Wang, are you returning home after buying groceries?\u201d Feng Wu smiled as she greeted Aunt Wang.Feng Wu lived five years in this northern border city.

I\u2019ll carefully provide you with some medicated cream that\u2019ll improve your health.\u201dGrandma Zhang was all smiles as she looked at Feng Wu, then turned her head to a middle aged man by her side as she praised. \u201cOur Miss Feng isn\u2019t merely beautiful, even more so, she is kindhearted.

None of the doctors in the city could do anything about it, advising me to make funeral arrangements. At the time, I was almost angered to death! A neighbor told me to find Miss Feng, to go find our Fifth Young Miss.\u201dStanding by the side, Feng Wu chuckled, wanting to leave. However, her hand was held back by Grandma Zhang and actually couldn\u2019t pull away.She wanted to leave and return home to refine the Nine Reversal Spirit Pill\u2014\u2014-The middle aged man passionately continued. \u201cHowever, I carried my little one to the Feng residence. As the Fifth Young Miss exercised her skills, several of those silver acupuncture needles \u2018woosh woosh\u2019 were inserted. Unexpectedly, the little one was brought back to life! That medical mastery is simply godlike!\u201dThe middle aged man spoke like this while Feng Wu forced a smile and hurriedly waved her hand. \u201cUncle Zhao, please please don\u2019t say that, I merely put in a small effort that\u2019s all, you don\u2019t need to be like that.\u201dUncle Zhao replied. \u201cBut, from my perspective, this isn\u2019t a small favor, nor a small kindness. You\u2019ve saved my whole family!

Miss Feng dislike it for not having a container, right? This large wicker basket is clean, I\u2019ll put the elk leg in there. You just need to carry it back home and cook it for the Seventh Young Master to eat.\u201d\u201cFifth Young Miss, this is the Golden Eyed Beast\u2019s breast meat. It most suitable for making meat jerky and giving it to the Seventh Young Master as snacks.\u201d\u201cFifth Young Miss, this is green orchid vegetable. Leafy green vegetables are still fresh this season, quickly take some home and allow the Seventh Young Master to taste them fresh.\u201dFeng Wu facepalmed. Had Young Seventh Feng\u2019s fame as a chowhound spread so far and wide already?She actually wanted to decline them, but these people in town were too passionate. Under Grandma Zhang and Uncle Zhao\u2019s lead, they continuously stuffed Feng Wu\u2019s wicker basket full of food. In but a short period of time, they already stuffed the large wicker basket completely full.Feng Wu. \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cAlright, I\u2019ve taken note of everyone\u2019s kind intentions.

When the moment comes, all off Northern Territory City\u2019s people will be able to bear witness.Feng Wu carried the bamboo basket while taking large strides, as she turned her head around behind her.The townspeople waved goodbye to her while they talked excitedly.\u201cJust now, that Lin Ling was the one who was almost captured last year by that Winter Tiger* to become his girl.\u201d(*TN: This is a nickname most likely given by the townspeople to Wang Family\u2019s Little Tiger reflecting how ferocious he is. A tiger that\u2019s so active even in the winter.)\u201cIsn\u2019t that right? It\u2019s really her. At that time, Grandma Lin and Grandma Lin risked their lives to stop Lin Ling from being captured. Due to this, they were even almost kicked to death by Wang Little Tiger and his people at the scene. At the time, this matter caused a huge commotion.\u201d\u201cThanks to the fifth young lady, if it wasn\u2019t for her rushing there in time to intervene, the three people from the Lin family would\u2019ve been buried underground, their burial mounds overgrown with weeds by now.\u201d\u201cThe fifth young lady didn\u2019t only save their lives, she even taught them skills for their entire family to support themselves. We really don\u2019t even need to mention it. With a taste, people instantly fall for these Lin family wontons.\u201d\u201cThose of us at Northern Territories City are so lucky to have Fifth Young Miss. Ever since she came back, don\u2019t know how many lives she\u2019s saved, she\u2019s simply a living Buddha!\u201d\u2014\u2014Feng Wu didn\u2019t hear the discussions behind her. At this moment, she was walking home as quickly as possible.One ought to know, three days ago, when she was captured by the Flaming Cloud Hawk and flown away, Qiu Ling indeed became unbearably anxious. It\u2019s also unclear right now what state of confusion her home might be in right now.Moreover, at that time, when she was held between the Flaming Cloud Hawk\u2019s beak and flown into the air, she saw with her own eyes that the Feng clan had come!One was Feng Yi Ran and the other was Feng Liu. In terms of seniority, they were the First Feng and the Sixth Feng, Feng Wu\u2019s Older Uncle\u2019s* children. One was an older male patrilineal cousin, the other was a younger female patrilineal cousin.(*TN: Feng Wu\u2019s Older Uncle is her father\u2019s older brother.)These two were certainly not two people who were easy to get along with. One was sinister and hypocritical, the other was crafty and unruly.During the time when Feng Wu fell from grace and became an abandoned individual, these two people proved to be the ones who stepped on Feng Wu most happily.Thinking of this, Feng Wu\u2019s footsteps became increasingly quicker!Because her home still housed her beautiful weeping mother and her simple, good and honest younger brother.She also didn\u2019t know how disordered her home might\u2019ve become now, and even more so, she didn\u2019t know how her mother and brother are doing.Because of these unknowns, the dread in Feng Wu\u2019s heart grew as she was thinking these things. Wings grew on her feet as her speed became lightning quick.Very soon, Feng Wu arrived at the door to her house.At the doorway stood two guards.Their bodies ramrod straight, expressions grave, gaze ice-cold\u2026\u2026with one look, she knew they were well trained.Feng Wu\u2019s eyes narrowed.She didn\u2019t recognize these two people at all. Therefore, she could conclude that they surely came from the capital.As expected, when Feng Wu walked inside, these two Iron Blood Guards who stood facing each other crossed the long blades in their hands in their hands barring her way. \u201cStop!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The look they gave Feng Wu was clearly as one looking at a stranger.Feng Wu\u2019s expression was as cold as frost, that pair of clear, penetrating, quick-witted eyes emanated chilliness!Without waiting for her to speak, a taunting female voice transmitted from inside.\u201cOh my, who is this, standing at our Feng Clan\u2019s door and making noise.\u201dAs she was speaking, a pale pink clothed young lady approached from within. That pair of sharp eyes swept up and down over Feng Wu\u2019s body.Feng Wu\u2019s eyes narrowed dangerously.Feng Liu was sixth among the Feng clan\u2019s daughters, so she was known as Sixth Young Miss Feng.At that time, when Feng Wu was still a unique genius, Feng Liu acted sweet and smilingly. Everyday, she revolved around Feng Wu and repeatedly wandered by her side, as if she\u2019s Feng Wu\u2019s tail. Later on, after Feng Wu became crippled, Feng Liu was the first one to throw stones at her when she was down.Feng Liu looked at Feng Wu before her.They hadn\u2019t seen each other for five years, the genius young girl who was like a sun in the sky in those days. Nowadays, she\u2019s only a plainly clothed crippled girl carrying a wicker basket. It\u2019s just that this face truly made a person so envious they wanted to destroy it!Thinking to this point, the corners of Feng Liu\u2019s mouth squeezed out a ridiculing sneer. \u201cOh my, where did this beggar girl come from, arriving at our Feng clan\u2019s door with such bad manners? Why haven\u2019t you quickly gotten rid of her already!\u201dArrogant, domineering, contemptuous, taunting\u2026..as if righteousness was on her side.A sneer emerged in Feng Wu\u2019s heart. In this world where strength is king, martial strength is truly still the most important thing.However, fortunately, she\u2019s already grasped the Immortal Spirit Fruit juice in her hands. As long as she had a bit of time, she\u2019d be able to refine the Nine Reversal Spirit Pill. When that time comes, all problems would be solved easily.Feng Wu didn\u2019t exchange any words with Feng Liu, rather, she quickly indifferently nodded her head, and immediately just stepped through the door.Feng Liu didn\u2019t expect that she had provoked Feng Wu like that, yet Feng Wu was actually still indifferent!Moreover, the expression on Feng Wu\u2019s face as she looked at her was as if she\u2019s looking at a little girl who\u2019s making needless trouble! Infuriating!Feng Liu made a fist, charging at Feng Wu while yelling. \u201cFeng Wu, stop right there!\u201dHowever, Feng Wu didn\u2019t stop at all, and didn\u2019t give her any other response, either. Her slim, spirited, refined manner and ramrod straight figure took steady, blithe strides as she walked all the way inside.Feng Liu was so angry she clenched her fists tightly. \u201cFeng Wu, you surprisingly dare to ignore me!\u201dShe charged forward wanting to make a move against Feng Wu. However, a slender, strong hand pulled her back.\u201cBrother!\u201d Feng Liu turned towards her elder brother, as her face exposed an indignant expression. \u201cOlder Brother, let go of me, this ugly girl surprisingly dared to ignore me. Who does she think she is? Does she think that she currently is still that exceptionally talented genius from those days? Bullsh*t!\u201dThe Feng clan\u2019s oldest son, Feng Yi Ran, was already eighteen years old. His facial features were good-looking and his lengthy body stood gracefully. Ordinarily, he seemed to be a noble young lord who could cause young girls to scream.However, at present, his face exposed a taunting faint smile.\u201cOlder Brother!\u201d Feng Liu glared at Feng Yi Ran. \u201cDon\u2019t forget, during that time, Feng Wu was famed as a genius exceeding all others. Everyone valued her innate talent, and she nearly snatched your position as successor!\u201cRight now, you\u2019re helping her instead? !\u201dFeng Yi Ran looked at his blood-related sister as if he\u2019s looking at an idiot. Her character was revealed in this way and it wasn\u2019t any good thing. Their family indeed pampered this girl too much.\u201cLiu Er, intelligent people never would personally make a move to kill their enemy.\u201d Feng Yi Ran rubbed Feng Liu\u2019s head as he gazed at her with a pampering look. \u201cThis temper of yours will cause you to suffer losses in the future.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Humph! Who does Feng Wu think she is? No matter what, I\u2019ll bully her for sure!\u201dFinished speaking, Feng Liu shook off Feng Yi Ran\u2019s hand, patta patta, quickly rushing inside, sneering as she charged. \u201cI want to see, when she sees her mother and brother, can she still be so calm and collected!\u201dFeng Wu carried the wicker basket and reached the courtyard. She saw this scene before her, her eyes ignited into flames instantly!Within the big courtyard, she saw her naive, innocent younger brother. At present, his bare upper body, on that tender, fair body were added a few lash marks, body dripping with sweat, puffing hard while doing hard physical labor!Moving from one side to the other side of the courtyard.Doing hard physical labor? Feng Wu\u2019s stared wide!The servant girl who\u2019d accompanied Feng Liu ever since she was a child, Cai Yue, was even holding a pitch-black whip in her hand at the moment, she swung the whip and \u2018crack crack\u2019 echoed angrily just like a foreman. \u201cHurry! Work faster! Don\u2019t think of being lazy! The Oldest Young Master and Sixth Young Lady already said that if you don\u2019t finish moving these ten thousand bricks by today, don\u2019t bother resting!\u201dHer beautiful mother\u2019s heart was in so much pain she cried incessantly, her tears were like raindrops on peach blossoms. \u201cLittle one, little once\u2026\u2026why has your sister still not returned, little one\u2026\u2026how\u2019re you doing\u2026.does it hurt\u2026\u2026\u201dFeng Wu\u2019s beautiful mother was truly gorgeous, she was formerly indeed Martial Lord Empire\u2019s most beautiful woman, superb skin like snow, delicate as if boneless, lithe figure, so breathtaking a person\u2019s heart trembles, adding to that her crying, so beautiful the heavens and earth pales in comparison, the sun and moon losing their brilliance!Beautiful other wanted to rush forward and beg for young Seventh Feng\u2019s sake, however, her hands were restrained by Feng Liu\u2019s other servant girl, Qiao Mo, unable to move.Qiao Mo saw the Second Madam\u2019s tear stained face and silently turned her head away.This face was really good-looking, when she\u2019s crying, it made a person\u2019s heart wrench even more.Even though she was a girl, furthermore, she\u2019s even the Sixth Young Lady\u2019s servant girl, yet at this moment, her heart shook quite a bit. She wished that she could immediately let go and help the madam.Feng Wu put down the basket she carried on her back and shouted loudly. \u201cStop!\u201dFor a moment, all of their gazes charged towards Feng Wu\u2019s direction!\u201cOw ow ow\u2014\u2014\u201d The first one to respond was little Seventh Feng, the Feng family\u2019s Seventh Young Master, Feng Wu\u2019s blood brother.\u201cSister! Sister! Sister!\u201d Little Seventh Feng had been protected by Feng Wu since childhood. During these three days when he was mistreated, he prayed continually his sister, who\u2019s like their family\u2019s goddess to him, to come and save him from calamity!Even though his sister\u2019s cultivation was crippled, however, little Seventh Feng still resolutely believed that in this world, there\u2019s nothing that could confound his gifted sister!Little Seventh Feng wailed an \u2018ow\u2019 which charged towards Feng Wu like an artillery shell, that high velocity simply made a person unable to react in time.\u201cElder Sister, they\u2019re bullying me!\u201d Little Seventh Feng wrapped himself around Feng Wu\u2019s neck as he complained loudly.\u201cLittle Wu, boo hoo hoo\u2014\u2014\u201d Her beauty of a mother also threw off Qiao Mo\u2019s hand, or rather, it\u2019s more accurate to say that Qiao Mo purposely loosened her grip.Her beautiful mother\u2019s uniquely pretty crying face that could turn the world upside down, that slim figure staggering delicately as it rushed towards Feng Wu, finally flung itself upon Feng Wu, lovely and pitiful. \u201cHoo hoo hoo~~Little Wu~~Little Wu~~~You finally come back~~\u201dOnly with Feng Wu did this family truly have a pillar of support.The corners of Feng Wu\u2019s mouth twitched slightly as she supported her forehead somewhat helplessly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Feng Wu\u2019s heart felt unbearably pained.Not so far away, Cai Yue gripped the whip in her hand. She wanted to move forward and berate them, however, thinking of the Feng family\u2019s fifth young lady\u2019s glorious incomparable strength during those years, she could only stand still and didn\u2019t dare to act blindly.Just at this time, Feng Liu rushed from outside towards them in a rage, seeing her crying extended family hugging each other into a lump, the corners of Feng Liu\u2019s mouth curved into a sinister cold smile. \u201cWhat is this? Crying so miserably? Is the whole family going to be swept away out the door to become beggars?\u201dLittle Seventh Feng saw Feng Liu and immediately became so overbearingly angry that all of the veins on his jadelike fair little face popped out. \u201cYou! You! How can you be so evil! I hate you!\u201dFeng Liu snatched the black whip from Cai Yue\u2019s hand, and closed in on the as she sneered. \u201cTell me, how am I evil?\u201dLittle Seven Feng ground his teeth. After he met his sister, he immediately gained confidence, hence he straightened his body and coldly reprimanded. \u201cYou deliberately tormented me again and again! Had me move ten thousand bricks everyday. Yesterday, you forced me to move them all to this side, today you forced me to move all of these bricks again to the other side of the courtyard. If this isn\u2019t you deliberately tormenting me, then what is it!\u201dFeng Liu smiled a smile that\u2019s not a smile while fiddling with the black whip in her hand, casting sidelong glances at little Seventh Feng. \u201cIt\u2019s because you first shattered my sparkling glasslike purple jade, my dear seventh brother, that\u2019s why I punished you by having you do a bit of manual labor. So what?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t break it! You clearly threw that purple jade on the ground yourself!\u201d Little Seventh Feng was terribly, terribly angry for being wronged.\u201cHe he.\u201d Feng Liu returned two words as she swung the whip in her hand, laughing especially arrogantly. \u201cAll of the bricks hasn\u2019t been moved today, hurry and get to work, if the work\u2019s not done, double tomorrow!\u201d\u201cElder Sister\u2026\u2026\u201d Little Seventh Feng was clearly frightened as that pair of limpid, transparent eyes miserably turned towards Feng Wu.Feng Wu scratched her head as her gaze moved from Feng Liu to Feng Yi Ran\u2019s body.Feng Liu was unreasonable, was Feng Yi Ran was similarly shameless?Feng Wu\u2019s clear as water eyes calmly turned towards Feng Yi Ran. \u201cWhat does Elder Brother think of this matter?\u201dFeng Yi Ran\u2019s face was as peaceful as water, just like the son of nobility as his left hand rested on his back while sword shaped eyebrows faintly knitted, reproachful gaze fixed at Feng Wu. \u201cFifth Sister, your own body\u2019s crippled, so be it, why also have Seventh Younger Brother raised as a cripple?\u201dFeng Wu\u2019s eyes narrowed dangerously.Feng Yi Ran criticized Feng Wu sounding dignified and uprighteous. \u201cAlthough Little Seventh\u2019s aptitude can\u2019t be said to be superb, nevertheless, it\u2019s also not useless. Originally, when he resided at the imperial capital, he already started to cultivate. Why is it that after five years, he\u2019s still only a first level Spirit Master? Fifth Sister, even if you\u2019re envious of Seventh Brother, you can\u2019t be this heartless and raise him as a cripple? !\u201dThose severe, righteous words blamed, boldly and confidently condemn with the demeanor of the head of a family, immediately setting Feng Wu up as unrighteous!Worthy of being Feng Yi Ran, driving a wedge between them with such a skillful move!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

My sister treats me extremely well! Even better than what you guys can imagine. You guys wouldn\u2019t understand!\u201d\u201cExactly!\u201d Her beautiful mother angrily glared at Feng Yi Ran.A gratified feeling appeared in Feng Wu\u2019s heart.Because of her beautiful mother and Little Seventh Feng\u2019s wholehearted trust and love, her formerly steeled blood became warm as it bathed in familial love. That\u2019s how she could survive these five years after having fallen from a goddess-like stature.They needed her, yet how could she not need them?Feng Yi Ran knitted his brows, somewhat displeased.Actually, during these three days, he\u2019d put in some effort.He attempted to defame Feng Wu, to break the sibling love between Feng Wu and young Seventh Feng, to break the mother daughter love between the Second Madam and Feng Wu. However, these two people were like idiots, no matter what kind of lures were placed before them, without exception, they shook their heads, shook their heads, shook their heads, declined, declined, declined, simply nothing could enter their ears.Feng Yi Ran really couldn\u2019t understand, Feng Wu\u2019s already become a useless person, why did they still have such confidence in her, and feel that she could protect them from wind and rain? What kind of charm did she possess?Feng Wu smiled a smile that\u2019s not a smile as she glared at Feng Yi Ran. \u201cElder Brother has nothing left to say now, right?\u201dFeng Yi Ran frowned as he pompously said. \u201cSince you\u2019re not teaching him, then leave it to me to teach little Seventh Feng. Having him do physical labor looks like a punishment on the surface, but it\u2019ll actually hammer his willpower into shape and toughen his body, allowing his strength to advance another step.\u201d\u201cTemper his willpower, toughen his body? Sounds quite dignified, does Elder Brother believe your own words?\u201d Feng Wu wore a mocking expression.A hand clenched firmly into a fist was hidden behind Feng Yi Ran\u2019s back!This Feng Wu! Clearly, she\u2019s already become a useless person, yet the totally forceful, imposing attitude coming from her body was as overbearing as before, still able to plant fear in people\u2019s mind, birth awe in the heart, truly made a person feel dislike!Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s group didn\u2019t know about this scene taking place at the Feng family at all.At this moment, they were coming out from Icebound Forest.Feng Xun was very angry throughout the journey, so angry he jumped up a tree and \u2018Ah Ah Ah\u2019 roared quite a few times, startling the surrounding demonic beasts into thinking enemies were attacking, scattering all over the place, escaping without a trace.However, there\u2019s something positive about Feng Xun\u2019s personality, and that was that his temper came quickly, but also left quickly. Therefore, his current mood was already much better than it was previously.A cool-headed Feng Xun started to feel ashamed and uneasy.From time to time, he stole a glance at Jun Lin Yuan, walking for a while, then stole another glance.Could it be that Jun Lin Yuan wasn\u2019t aware of these glances? Merely, his\u2026\u2026motionless, iceberg like face, didn\u2019t show any fluctuation in his mood whatsoever.Feng Xun didn\u2019t dare to look at Jun Lin Yuan as he pulled Xuan Yi and moved to the side. \u201cYoung Second Xuan.\u201d Feng Xun lowered his voice, speaking furtively.\u201cWhat\u2019re you doing?\u201d Xuan Yi\u2019s face was solemn.Feng Xun replied quietly. \u201cLittle Second Xuan, look at Boss Jun, isn\u2019t he a bit strange?\u201d\u201cHow\u2019s he strange?\u201d Xuan Yi\u2019s totally stiff face frowned.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Maybe very strange?\u201dFeng Xun impatiently searched for a sense of agreement, therefore his pair of clear, pretty big eyes stared unblinkingly at Xuan Yi very earnestly.However, Xuan Yi shook his head. \u201cNot strange.\u201d\u201cHow can it not be strange!\u201d Feng Xun anxiously raised his voice. However, after he gathered his wits, he hurriedly covered his mouth again and lowered his voice. \u201cHow can it be not strange? ! It\u2019s very strange, alright? Moreover, have you discovered?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cBoss Jun surprisingly seemed lost in thought! Previously, when I looked carefully at him, his mind surprisingly was also wandering in space! My god\u2014\u2014\u201d Feng Xun only felt that this world became mysterious and unbelievable.Xuan Yi remained dumbfounded. \u201cWhat\u2019s strange about that?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not strange on someone else, but he is Jun Lin Yuan! Jun- Lin-Yuan! He unexpectedly became absent-minded!\u201dXuan Yi still couldn\u2019t agree as he shook his head. \u201cI think you\u2019ve been overly provoked by that Little Fifth, now, you\u2019re looking at everything suspiciously.\u201d\u201cIs it truly not strange?\u201d Feng Xun was unwilling to give up.\u201cNot strange.\u201d\u201cAm I truly overly suspicious?\u201d\u201cMm hm.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cGet moving!\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u2026\u201dAfter they\u2019d walked for a short while, Feng Xun fixed his gaze on Xuan Yi. \u201cBut I still feel that it\u2019s really strange\u2026\u2026based on Boss Jun\u2019s astuteness and knowledge, it\u2019s impossible for him to fail to chase after little Fifth Feng, but yet, on this entire way, we surprisingly haven\u2019t found even a trace of a clue? This doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201dWe\u2019re talking about Jun Lin Yuan, the Jun Lin Yuan who could singlehandedly pursue the enemy troop\u2019s commander-in-chief when he was seven years old. Could he not find a young girl? Doesn\u2019t make sense, truly doesn\u2019t make any sense.Xuan Yi ignored him, walking in large strides.Feng Xun scratched his head repeatedly, could it be that it\u2019s truly just him being overly suspicious? Alas, it\u2019s all because of Little Fifth! Thinking of this, Feng Xun\u2019s mind once again turned towards Little Fifth. \u201cThis bad girl, if I ever see her again, humph humph!\u201dThe chattering Feng Xun was unable to stay idle for a single second as he eagerly ran to Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s side, asking lightheartedly. \u201cBoss Jun, Boss Jun, where are we going now?\u201dJun Lin Yuan didn\u2019t speak at all, instead it was Fairy Mu Yao by his side who spoke loudly. \u201cDidn\u2019t we previously agree to visit the Feng residence? You guys already said we\u2019re going to see Feng Wu! Young Prince Feng, you haven\u2019t forgotten about this matter, right?\u201dFairy Mu Yao didn\u2019t feel anything for the Immortal Spirit Fruit and also didn\u2019t feel threatened by Little Fifth. However, her heart actually had always felt like it\u2019d been secretly stabbed by the memory of what Feng Xun said previously.He said Feng Wu was beautiful, he said Boss Jun and Feng Wu still hadn\u2019t annulled their engagement.Feng Xun slapped his head once. \u201cJeez, look at this memory of mine! Boss Jun, then are we really going to the Feng residence?\u201dEverybody turned to Jun Lin Yuan, waiting for his decision.To go or not go to the Feng residence, it\u2019s useless for anybody else to say it, even if they were to say it a hundred times, the authority to decide rested on Jun Lin Yuan alone.On the Crown Prince Jun\u2019s resolute and daring, cold, strict, iceberg-like face, who\u2019s gaze was serene and hidden in deep, unfathomable depths, there seemed to be a brightness within those depths, or maybe it was everybody\u2019s misperception.Jun Lin Yuan didn\u2019t express an opinion as he shot a glance at Feng Xun. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It\u2019s with great difficulty that we\u2019ve come to Northern Territory City. If we didn\u2019t take a look at the current Feng Wu, I won\u2019t resign myself to it.\u201dFairy Mu Yao secretly said in her heart, she also wouldn\u2019t be reconciled to it!Consequently, Fairy Mu Yao raised both hands in approval. \u201cRight right right, let\u2019s go to the Feng residence! Let\u2019s go see what Feng Wu has grown up to look like now.\u201dOnce it\u2019s been declared that they\u2019re visiting the Feng residence, the group\u2019s strained, ice-cold atmosphere was immediately swept away, and a light, cheerful atmosphere took its place. Especially Feng Xun, he revolved around Jun Lin Yuan and made eyes at him. \u201cBoss Jun, heh hehe, Boss Jun, ha haha\u2014\u2014\u201dThe corners of Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s mouth twitched slightly as he looked away.Therefore, when a group of people stood outside the doorway\u2014\u2014Feng Wu and Feng Yi Ran were still confronting each other.Just at this moment, Feng Yi Ran\u2019s personal servant, He Chen, quickly ran in from outside, expression tense and gave, however, his eyes radiated an excited light!\u201cEldest Young\u2014\u2014\u201d He Chen arrived before Feng Yi Ran, muttering something in a quiet voice by the side of his ear.\u201cWhat? !\u201d The Feng Yi Ran from a moment ago, who carried himself as a noble and composed young lord was no longer calm and collected at this moment as he cried out in alarm. \u201cCrown Prince Jun and a group of people are at the door? ! The young prince, also young Marquis Xuan\u2026\u2026they\u2019ve all come? !\u201dFeng Liu\u2019s eyes instantly shined, blossoming into the most glittering radiance, her voice quivering with excitement. \u201cCrown Prince\u2026\u2026Jun, Jun, Crown Prince Jun is coming? Moreover, he\u2019s already at the door? !\u201dHe Chen nervously trembled and nodded repeatedly. \u201cYes! Precisely at the door.\u201dHow\u2019s Feng Yi Ran still in the mood to bother with Feng Wu\u2019s trio at the moment? He charged outside at once, taking quick steps, unable to wait, basically so excited he\u2019s unable to keep his cool!It\u2019s actually Jun Lin Yuan, whose anger can shake the world, the Feng family had always wanted to cling to this out of reach existence.This time, he and Feng Liu came here from the imperial capital thousands of miles away. Their purpose was precisely to have an opportunity to cling to Jun Lin Yuan, and now such a big chance had come their way, how could Feng Yi Ran not be moved? !The clan elders actually had already spoken, as long as he could bring the Feng clan and Crown Prince Jun together, then he\u2019d be granted the position of the clan\u2019s successor!Feng Yi Ran completely disregarded appearances as he rushed out like a gust of wind!Feng Liu was even more stirred up as her entire body trembled, eyes shining in excitement, no longer interested in Feng Wu. Her biggest idol was Jun Lin Yuan!Feng Yi Ran\u2019s speed was fast, Feng Liu\u2019s speed was also not slow. The two brother and sister disappeared without a trace in a flash.In the blink of an eye, in the courtyard, there remained only Feng Wu\u2019s group of three people.And at present, Feng Wu\u2019s heart practically collapsed!Jun Lin Yuan? Feng Xun? Xuan Yi? They, why did they come to the Feng Residence?Don\u2019t tell me, could it be that they knew that little Fifth is Feng Wu?Did they know that she\u2019s the one who snatched away the Immortal Spirit Fruit\u2019s juice?Thinking of this, Feng Wu only felt the pit of her stomach violently moving up and down, her heart pounding forcefully, so quickly it practically jumped out of her throat.\u201cElder Sister, Elder Sister, why is your hand so cold?\u201d Little Seventh Feng nervously turned towards Feng Wu. \u201cElder Sister, are you ok?\u201dCould Feng Wu be ok? She had disguised herself as a pig to eat a tiger, hiding within Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s group, and finally even took advantage of Yu Ming Ye\u2019s strength, to cause confusion and snatch the spirit juice, furthermore, she even, even kissed Jun Lin Yuan\u2026\u2026OH MY GOD!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Are you ok?\u201d Little Seventh Feng was very nervous and worried.Feng Wu inhaled deeply. She was going to speak, but little Seventh Feng spoke first. \u201cElder Sister, is Crown Prince Jun the crown prince who was engaged to you at that time?\u201dFeng Wu. \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dLittle Seventh Prince\u2019s pair of clear big eyes blinked, turned to Feng Wu and asked suspiciously. \u201cIs that why you became nervous when you think of him? Can it be that Elder Sister, you\u2019re actually\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cNo!\u201d Feng Wu answered resolutely and decisively, moreover, she even made a fist to express her firm attitude.Little Seventh Feng gazed at Feng Wu doubtfully.At their side, her beautiful mother had been pulling at Feng Wu, eyes gleaming with tears, lovely and pitiful, made a heart extremely pained to see it.\u201cMother, what is it?\u201d Feng Wu looked at her mother\u2019s red-rimmed eyes, and her heart pained.Her mother\u2019s snow-white, jadelike hands pulled at Feng Wu, stroking her hair, skin, and clothes as pearl like tears rolled down, tears spilling on her jacket.Feng Wu\u2019s heart wrenched. \u201cMother, what is it?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s all because mother is useless.\u201d Her beautiful mother choked with sobs. \u201cIt\u2019s all because mother hasn\u2019t taken care of you well, look at your hair, so dirty to this extent, even stinking with perspiration, look at your skin, a layer of filth has grown on it, also these clothes\u2026\u2026you\u2019re the Feng family\u2019s fifth young lady, how can you wear these coarse long skirts? These are humiliating you~~\u201dHer beautiful mother spoke while choking with emotion. \u201cYou should be wearing embroidered clothes, jade, gold, pretty, magnificently dressed, bearing dignified, smiling gracefully, yet now, you\u2026\u2026you\u2019re similar to a live monkey, living in such a crude way, mother feels sorry for you~~\u201dFeng Wu massaged her forehead.Mother had always put all of her efforts into turning her into a gracefully smiling, delicate, magnificently dressed, dignified, precious lady in her chamber, feeling that only this kind of delicate life would suit her daughter, but the truth is\u2026\u2026how could it?\u201cLet\u2019s go, let\u2019s go, let\u2019s go, we\u2019ll go and get dressed, we can\u2019t be so crude anymore.\u201d In beautiful mother\u2019s eyes, Crown Prince Jun certainly didn\u2019t exist at all. There\u2019s only Feng Wu in her heart, of course there\u2019s also a little bit of a space set aside for little Seventh Feng.Feng Wu also was thinking about quickly washing away the traces of Icebound Forest from her body, or else, based on Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s sharp eyesight, there\u2019d absolutely be a problem.Thus, for the first time, Feng Wu nodded cheerfully. \u201cYes!\u201dHer mother\u2019s greatest pleasure was to dress up Feng Wu. As a result, in all of these years, she didn\u2019t do much else. All of her time was spent on personally making clothes for Feng Wu.One had no choice but to say, with respect to dressing up, her beautiful mother\u2019s skill was super outstanding.Feng Wu didn\u2019t want to get dressed up at all, however, she couldn\u2019t take her beautiful mother\u2019s tears, so she could only helplessly bear with it\u2026\u2026in any case, she already thought of a way to have Jun Lin Yuan reject her!When a fresh and cool, clean bodied, groomed and made up Feng Wu walked out\u2026\u2026the first one to be stunned was little Seventh Feng.\u201cOh my god! You\u2026\u2026\u201d Little Seventh Feng covered his mouth in shock, his expression extremely exaggerated. \u201cYou you you, are you sure you\u2019re my sister? ! Are you my sister? !\u201dFeng Wu ordinarily was very casual, her mother wanted to grab her and dress her up, but she couldn\u2019t catch her. Therefore, that gorgeously beautiful face was without makeup and unadorned most of the time, her clothes were also as simple as they come.However, right now, after she\u2019s dressed in rich attire, Feng Wu was simply so beautiful that\u2014\u2014Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She knew that what Jun Lin Yuan hated most was a slow-witted beauty. Since she couldn\u2019t escape this face of hers no matter what, then she\u2019d just make an issue with her character. When the moment came, she\u2019d surely have Jun Lin Yuan reject her and walk away!And at this moment, Feng Yi Ran and Feng Liu already charged towards the front door\u2014\u2014Seeing the group of people standing outside the door, Feng Yi Ran was so excited his hands and feet didn\u2019t know where to arrange themselves.After all, at present, the Feng family had declined so much that they couldn\u2019t even be considered one of the nine great clans anymore, and Jun Lin Yuan, he\u2019s their great empire\u2019s future sovereign!\u201cPaying respects to Crown Prince\u2014\u2014\u201d Feng Yi Ran lifted up his robe at once, kneeling down extremely respectfully.Feng Liu was even more so, holding her breath, eyes lowered, as gentle as water, quickly kneeling down along with Feng Yi Ran.Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s pure and cold, noble gaze scanned over them.Feng Liu\u2019s heart was just like a running deer\u2019s, violently palpitating endlessly. She was truly unable to hold back, stealthily raising her eyes to look at Jun Lin Yuan, whose dense brows and deep eyes were just like the sharp and cold edge of a blade, making people tremble all over.Handsome straight nose, thin and lovely lips, exquisite contours that were like carved to perfection.His noble identity, influence that overflows the heavens, formidable aura, unapproachable by human beings! Simply made a person\u2026\u2026feel a rush of excitement!Feng Liu\u2019s gaze and Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s crossed in midair.Jun Lin Yuan subconsciously knitted his brows as Feng Liu\u2019s heart rose to her throat, so emotional her whole body was trembling!Crown, Prince, Jun, Lin, Yuan looked at her? Crown Prince Jun\u2026\u2026did he have, a very slight trace of a favorable impression of her? Thinking of this, Feng Liu only felt as if an electric current flowed through her entire body, and yet was also **** saturated with sweetness as the corners of her mouth almost couldn\u2019t hold back.How could bystanders know that Feng Liu went through so much psychological drama?Jun Lin Yuan indifferently glanced at Feng Yi Ran as he dropped his head slightly.Without waiting for Feng Yi Ran to get up, Jun Lin Yuan already took steps to head inside, as if Feng Yi Ran simply wasn\u2019t in his line of sight.Feng Yi Ran also didn\u2019t feel that there was anything wrong with Jun Lin Yuan acting coldly and detachedly towards him as he hurriedly straightened his robe and quickly walked behind him.Jun Lin Yuan exuded a noble aura, cold faced as he walked in front, and attitude that looked at everything with disdain, as if this wasn\u2019t the Feng residence, but rather another courtyard of his.Feng Yi Ran followed closely behind him. He didn\u2019t dare to speak with Jun Lin Yuan, hence he cupped his hands towards Feng Xun, smiling apologetically and lowering his voice. \u201cAh, Young Prince Feng, after leaving the capital, it\u2019s been a long time since we\u2019ve seen each other.\u201dFeng Xun was a young attendant in Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s presence, however, before Feng Yi Ran, he was indeed quite severe, completely an attitude of a Young Prince.He shot a glance at Feng Yi Ran and unenthusiastically uttered an \u2018mm\u2019.Feng Yi Ran flatteringly smiled as he stepped forward apologetically. \u201cYoung Prince, Young Prince, is it possible for you to tell me the reason Crown Prince Jun is visiting the Feng residence?\u201dFeng Xun smiled a smile that wasn\u2019t a smile. \u201cYour Feng clan\u2026\u2026it seems that it\u2019s possible for it to rise one position higher.\u201dHuh? The meaning behind this \u2018rise one position higher\u2019 is\u2026\u2026Suddenly, his eyes shined brightly!The Feng clan was previously one of the nine great clans, even though they were ranked last, they were still one of the nine great clans. However, ever since Feng Wu became a cripple, the Feng clan lost their position as one of the nine great clans.\u201cCould it be that Young Prince Feng\u2019s meaning is\u2026\u2026\u201d Feng Liu\u2019s emotions were so stirred up, she cried out in surprise, covering her red lips.The corners of Feng Xun\u2019s mouth rose, smiling mysteriously, profoundly mysteriously. \u201cBuddha said, the mysteries of heaven must not be revealed~\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Jun Lin Yuan and Feng Wu\u2019s engagement still hadn\u2019t been annulled, which meant that the Feng clan had a very big chance of rising in standing, unless\u2026\u2026Feng Wu herself courted disaster.That\u2019s why, Feng Xun thought himself clever as he supplemented with. \u201cThe Feng clan produces a female phoenix*, there\u2019s some meaning to these words.\u201d(*TN: Feng Xun\u2019s statement contained several potential meanings. Feng means phoenix, so 1) \u2018The Phoenix clan produces a female phoenix.\u2019 2) Female phoenixes may also symbolize an empress, so \u2018The Feng clan produces a queen.\u2019)However, Feng Liu\u2019s understanding was completely different. Her greatest skill indeed was her imagination, and most awesome of all was the ability to deceive others as well as herself. That\u2019s why, when she heard these words from Feng Xun, her heartbeat instantly sped up!The Feng clan produced a female phoenix\u2026\u2026female phoenix? Moreover relying on this female phoenix, the entire Feng clan would rise in position again?It\u2019s already an impossibility for Feng Wu, then currently, the Feng clan\u2019s most capable daughter\u2026..Thinking of this, Feng Liu only felt the blood in her entire body rushing to her forehead!Oh my god, Crown Prince Jun regarded her\u2026\u2026Crown Prince Jun surprisingly regarded her\u2026\u2026with some feeling!Feng Liu excitedly clenched her fists, her entire body shivering with excitement.No one knew that Feng Liu\u2019s thoughts were in a complete mess.Feng Yi Ran saw Jun Lin Yuan walking straight into the courtyard. Recalling that Feng Wu was in there, he heart \u2018bathump\u2019ed\u2014\u2014Feng Wu, that d*mned girl with a stubborn personality. She must still harbor hard feelings against Jun Lin Yuan from the time their engagement was annulled, so let\u2019s not have her resentment skyrocket from colliding with Crown Prince Jun. Thinking to this point, Feng Yi Ran hurriedly ran forward and stooped at the side. \u201cCrown Prince, the reception area is this way\u2014\u2014\u201dFeng Xun frowned. \u201cFeng Yi Ran, are you not letting us enter the main courtyard? What do you intend by this?\u201dHow could Feng Yi Ran dare to cover up the truth in front of the crown prince. He faced his hands up and smiled awkwardly. \u201cTo be quite honest, the main courtyard is in front of us. There\u2019s an unlucky person in there, I\u2019m afraid she would dirty Your Highness and everyone\u2019s eyes, that\u2019s why\u2014\u2014\u201d\u201cUnlucky person, who\u2019s that?\u201d Feng Xun inquisitively asked.\u201cHe hehe, Young Prince, you also know her, our Feng clan\u2019s family misfortune. Besides that unlucky comet, who implicated the entire Feng clan causing it to fall from a position as one of the nine great clans, and who, as a result, was released to this old residence in the Northern Territories\u2026\u2026\u201dFeng Xun\u2019s eyes blinked. \u201cThe unlucky person that you\u2019re referring to, the one you\u2019re pointing to shouldn\u2019t be\u2026\u2026Feng Wu, right?\u201dFeng Yi Ran was very embarrassed. \u201cAlas, our clan\u2019s misfortune, our clan\u2019s misfortune, sigh\u2026\u2026\u201dTo the side, Fairy Mu Yao covered up her mouth and smiled, appearance brimming with delight.Before coming to the Feng residence, her heart had been unconvinced, and even more so, was unreconciled. A good-for-nothing like Feng Wu, who\u2019s fallen from grace, why did she still feel pressured by her?Now that she knew the Feng clan\u2019s people evaluated Feng Wu in this way, she was naturally glad, happiness overflowing in waves.But at this moment, Feng Xun used an awfully strange gaze to glance at Feng Yi Ran. This one glance, made Feng Yi Ran\u2019s back shiver, scared from the bottom of his heart.\u201cFeng Wu? It\u2019s actually been five years since we\u2019ve seen her, and we also don\u2019t know what she\u2019s grown up to be like. It should be good for us to meet her.\u201d The corners of Feng Xun\u2019s mouth curved up. \u201cLead the way forward.\u201dFacing Feng Yi Ran, Feng Xun exhibited a young prince\u2019s authority, and wasn\u2019t polite at all.Feng Yi Ran took a look at Jun Lin Yuan, this Crown Prince Jun\u2019s dense eyebrows and deep eyes were profoundly mysterious. No one could guess his thoughts, nor opinions.He didn\u2019t oppose and also didn\u2019t approve. His manner of declining to comment, made a person have even more difficulty seeing through it.\u201cLet\u2019s go, lead the way up front.\u201d Feng Xun unpleasantly glared at Feng Yi Ran.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It\u2019s just that Feng Wu\u2019s personality is arrogant, with resentment to the skies and embittered. If she were to commit an offense, I still hope that everyone will please show forgiveness as great as the sea.\u201dFeng Wu didn\u2019t know at all that Feng Yi Ran was bringing Jun Lin Yuan and company over.At the moment, she was feeling somewhat uncomfortable as she clutched at the dress on her body. It was a bit too grand and wasn\u2019t a style that she normally liked to wear.However, her mother and silly brother continuously revolved around her, light radiating from their eyes.Feng Wu felt somewhat uncomfortable by their gazes as she pulled her mother\u2019s snow white exquisite hand and implored pitiably. \u201cHow about we just change to something else?\u201dThe pink dress looked like a forward, pink bubbly little girl, Feng Wu felt that it really didn\u2019t suit her.In a flash, her beautiful mother\u2019s face smiling as brightly as the moon, instantly transformed into a torrent of rain ready to pour down from the clear and boundless sky. That pair of uniquely pretty eyes were swollen with suspended tears which hadn\u2019t fallen, appearing innocent and extremely pitiful\u2026\u2026Apparently, Feng Wu only needed to say another word and that pair of eyeballs inside those pretty eyes would surge and fall.\u201cFine fine fine, no changing, no changing\u2026\u2026\u201d Feng Wu\u2019s hand supported her forehead. She\u2019s truly frightened by her.Her mother\u2019s tearful eyes were gorgeous when smiling, breathtaking.\u201cThis pearl hairpin of a phoenix spreading its wings is a bit\u2026\u2026\u201d Really quite pretty, attracting people\u2019s gaze, but was truly too ceremonious.The current Feng Wu only wanted to withdraw and be a plank of wood on stage, and didn\u2019t want to be high-profiled, or ostentatious.Her beautiful mother pouted her cherry red lips, looking greatly wronged as she turned to Feng Wu.Feng Wu. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, it\u2019s fine\u2026\u2026not changing, not changing it either, I\u2019ll just wear this for a day. We\u2019ve already agreed that it\u2019ll be for a day.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d Her mother smiled very happily.Feng Wu thought to herself, for today, she\u2019ll just continue to stay in this backyard. If nothing special occurs, she shouldn\u2019t be meeting Jun Lin Yuan. In that case, she also wouldn\u2019t need to exhaust herself putting on a play. There couldn\u2019t be anything better than that.However, she didn\u2019t know why her heart had been feeling somewhat restless.\u201cElder Sister, you\u2019ve dressed up so elegantly and prettily, but you feel uncomfortable like this?\u201d Little Seventh Feng sized Feng Wu up and down. \u201cElder Sister, if you were to go out dressed like this, I guarantee that Crown Prince Jun will be enchanted to the point he\u2019ll fall head over heels.\u201dFeng Wu displeasedly shot a glance at him. \u201cDon\u2019t spout nonsense, hurry and go out to see if there\u2019s anything going on outside. Jun Lin Yuan is not a vulgar skirt chaser, this person is aloof and extremely icily arrogant.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d Little Seventh Feng responded with one sound and ran away, but before he even reached the door, he wailed loudly and ran back around\u2014\u2014\u201cElder Sister, Elder Sister, not good, Crown Prince Jun is coming\u2014\u2014\u201d Little Seventh Feng made a big fuss as he charged back!Not good? Crown Prince Jun is coming?Without exception, everyone from Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s party entering the courtyard heard these words.Feng Yi Ran\u2019s complexion instantly became dark!What\u2019s the meaning of this? ! Did this mean that they don\u2019t like Crown Prince Jun? But even if you don\u2019t like him, you shouldn\u2019t say it outloud! It\u2019s Crown Prince Jun we\u2019re talking about, Jun Lin Yuan! It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re courting your own death, don\u2019t bring the clan, misfortune, heavens!Feng Yi Ran wished that he could choke Feng Wu to death!

At once his complexion paled overwhelmed with shock, unable to utter another word\u2014\u2014Feng Wu looked up towards the door\u2014\u2014While a walking Jun Lin Yuan was also looking up towards Feng Wu inside the back yard.These pairs of eyes\u2014\u2014Rumbling, pounding\u2014\u2014Seemed like a sudden clap of thunder on level ground, all of the people present were shocked into staring blankly!Silence, all around\u2026\u2026Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s pair of hidden in depth, handsome eyes instantly unblinkingly stared at Feng Wu before him, his gaze burning hot and forgetting himself!Feng Xun looked at the Feng Wu before him, stupefied, eyes staring perfectly round, eyeballs almost fell out!The solemn, rigid Xuan Yi also became stunned at the scene\u2026\u2026Fairy Mu Yao only felt rumbles and drums echoing in her brain, as the sky in her brain flashed with lightning and rolled with thunder, sparks flew everywhere, rain bucketing down, the downpour extinguishing all of her vain delusions.Feng Yi Ran and Feng Liu were also stunned in place, their souls left for a very long time.At present, Feng Wu was\u2026\u2026too enchanting!Dazzling to this degree?Picturesque facial features, bright eyes and white teeth, illuminating appearance, one that could cause the downfall of a country, turn all living things upside down, absolutely splendid heavenly beauty, simply defy conventions\u2026\u2026All words of praise added together, were still insufficient to completely describe her alluring, ravishing appearance!Beautiful, exceptionally beautiful, incomparably beautiful!\u201cOh my god!\u201d Feng Xun was the first one to regain his wits as he kneaded his eyes, and kneaded his eyes again. \u201cIs this truly not a figment of my imagination?

No way!At the moment, Feng Wu\u2026\u2026Her heart practically fell apart.Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s eyes were too deep, too bright, also penetrating as if he clearly understood everything.Having his eagle like, sharp eyes fixed on her like this, Feng Wu only felt like the tips of blades were piercing her, her heartbeat sped up, bewildered.She needed to stay calm, needed to stay cool-headed, if any mistake was discovered, the consequences would be too horrible to contemplate\u2026\u2026thinking to this point, Feng Wu inwardly made a fist!The reason why she indulged her mother and allowed her to dress her up like this was precisely to remove any trace of the ugly girl, Little Fifth. This moment was a crucial point in time, she certainly couldn\u2019t make any mistakes.Thinking of this, Feng Wu inhaled deeply, lifted her skirt, each step taken was as if it had been measured, as dignified as a noble, precious daughter, her manners perfectly conforming to established standards.She stood still before Jun Lin Yuan, performed a bow per propriety, fully prostrating herself. \u201cThis young woman from the Feng clan pays her respects to the crown prince, ten thousand fortunes and peace.\u201dA greeting ceremoniously carried out, exactingly, without taking one single extra step, and also without speaking a single extra word, just like a blockhead of a beauty who\u2019s been trained with a ruler, spirits weighed down. Where was there still the high spirits and lively aura present during those days?Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s dense brows and deep eyes knitted slightly.Feng Xun\u2019s mouth dropped wide open and was even more shocked\u2014\u2014Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They were two polar extremes. Even if the others harbored any suspicions previously, all of their doubts should\u2019ve been cleared by now, right?Feng Xun rubbed his eyes, and rubbed them again\u2014\u2014He was a bit startled.What the hell? Was this the same Feng Wu who he remembered that was always glowing with health and vigor from those days?\u201cWhat happened to you during these five years? How did you turn out this way\u2026\u2026so strangely?\u201d Feng Xun stared at Feng Wu, he even walked around Feng Wu\u2019s body again and again. As he walked, he examined her closely.Feng Wu clenched her fists tightly as her face remained as stiff as before, a wooden and slow-witted beauty, as she paid her respects to the rest of the people. \u201cThis young woman is just a precious daughter in her chambers, and have never met with visitors before. This young woman will excuse herself now.\u201dAfter saying so, Feng Wu delicately, as if there were no bones in her body, prostrated herself and just withdrew.\u201cStop right there!\u201d Feng Xun raised his hand to grab Feng Wu\u2019s sleeve.Feng Wu could feel a scorchingly hot gaze focused on her hand, a pain stabbing her right hand like a pincushion. Very clearly, that came from Jin Lin Yuan\u2019s gaze!Before her was Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s suspicions, behind her was Feng Xun inquisitiveness. Feng Wu inhaled deeply as she continued to act out this play, otherwise, the consequences would be unthinkable.Feng Wu raised her head, that pair of watery, bright, pretty eyes stared at Feng Xun, stiffly and woodenly answered. \u201cYoung Prince, men and women should maintain their distance, if Young Prince still won\u2019t let go, this young woman can only crash myself against this metal pillar and kill myself, to maintain my purity.\u201dThis sentence scared Feng Xun into releasing his grip at once.However, his eyes still stared at Feng Wu, except that there\u2019s a trace of displeasure in his expression as he frowned, and muttered. \u201cCould it be that five years time could truly change so much?\u201dThe Feng Wu from those days, when she scuffled with him, she was rough, bold and powerful. Her younger self indeed could lift her leg!But now, it\u2019s always \u2018this young woman\u2019 this, \u2018this young woman\u2019 that, always prostrating herself, simply made a person lose all of their appetite. Feng Xun wondered if the soul in her body had been switched out, how could she become so colorless?Feng Wu faced Feng Xun and kowtowed fully again.Feng Xun waved his hand with displeasure. \u201cStop moving, don\u2019t keep bowing her and there, you\u2019re not a slave nor a servant, what\u2019s the point of being so servile? ! Watching you makes disgust grow in a person!\u201dThe more one looked forward to something with expectation, the more the disappointment was.In Feng Xun\u2019s eyes, Feng Wu had always been a noble and virtuous girl, icily arrogant, yet full of vigor and spirit, as lively as the morning sun. How was she the least bit like the monotonous, pedantic, archaic person that she was currently?Therefore, Feng Xun swung his sleeves and somewhat boredly and disinterestedly turned around and left. His heart felt both disappointed and angry at himself.As Xuan Yi watched this Feng Wu, his brows also deeply furrowed, expression brimming with disappointment.Fairy Mu Yao was originally stunned by Feng Wu\u2019s remarkably beautiful appearance, however, seeing this spiritless, stiff and mechanical appearance of hers, her heart immediately became boundlessly delighted!Ha haha, Feng Wu, heh, Feng Wu, you\u2019re lucky to have a remarkable appearance, but your personality\u2026\u2026after one look and disgust grows, therefore, what good is it to be beautiful? !Feng Yi Ran and Feng Liu glanced at each other. That\u2019s strange, just now, Feng Wu was even acting arrogantly, how did she suddenly turn into\u2026\u2026this way?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Now, after he\u2019s been thoroughly disappointed, he felt extremely gloomy.\u201cLet\u2019s go, let\u2019s go, what meaning is there still in remaining here?\u201d Feng Xun waved his hand, turned around and left.Feng Wu\u2019s heart stirred, clenching her fists tightly in excitement!Want to leave? That\u2019s great! Hurry and leave! Not to mention Feng Xun, she pretended to be stiff and wooden, acted to the point even she herself felt like she wanted to throw up, alright?However, after Feng Xun walked a few steps away, she discovered that Jun Lin Yuan still stood motionless in his original spot.Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s gaze was threatening, deep and profound, as he dangerously narrowed his eyes. In that pair of good-looking, deep eyes, was a profound mystery, no one could guess what he\u2019s thinking.\u201cBoss Jun, you\u2019re not leaving?\u201d A disappointed sigh spread over Fen Xun\u2019s entire face. Is there any reason to remain at this Feng residence anymore?That\u2019s right, why\u2019re you still not leaving! Feng Wu felt somewhat anxious.She already planned it all. As soon as Jun Lin Yuan and the rest left, she\u2019d immediately enter the pill refining room to refine the Nine Reversal Spirit pill as quickly as possible and start to cultivate!She, really, was, dying, to, start!However, currently, Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s gaze was burning and fervent, his eyes hidden in depth, restrained and submerged, as if the most dangerous, most dreadful, demonic beast king from Icebound Forest was staring at Feng Wu!Stared attentively by Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s pair of dangerous eyes, Feng Wu only felt her heart thumping and beating wildly. Her nervous heart was jumping out of her throat.Jun Lin Yuan moved forward step by step.Feng Wu\u2019s heart abruptly skipped a beat!What did Jun Lin Yuan want to do? !Right at this time, Feng Xun stared at Jun Lin Yuan again.\u201cBoss Jun, you shouldn\u2019t be interested in her, right?\u201d Feng Xun used a kind of incredulous gaze to stare at Jun Lin Yuan. \u201cThis girl is indeed pretty, however, you surprisingly like that lifeless, wooden, rigid, pedantic slow-witted beauty?\u201dJun Lin Yuan sucked in a mouthful of air as his cold gaze stared at Feng Xun.Feng Xun quickly raised his hands in surrender. \u201cFine fine fine, Boss Jun, if you like her\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cAre, this, Highness\u2019, eyes, defective?\u201d Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s words seemed to contain an anger stemming from humiliation.Jun Lin Yuan had always used his words sparingly, that\u2019s why he\u2019d almost never exceeded four words at a time. However, just now, don\u2019t know if it was because he was provoked by Feng Xun, but his sentence surprisingly contained five words!After he spoke this sentence, Jun Lin Yuan flung his sleeves, turned, and left!Feng Xun patted his stomach. \u201cDidn\u2019t I say it, how can this kind of girl enter Boss Jun\u2019s sights? If she\u2019s brought home as a wife, isn\u2019t this the same as hugging a block of wood to bed everyday? Feels awful just thinking about it.\u201dWhile Feng Xun spoke, his quick footsteps kept pace with Jun Lin Yuan.Xuan Yi profoundly shot a glance at Feng Wu, then turned and left in the same way as the others.Fairy Mu Yao\u2019s pair of hands rested behind her as she complacently walked a full circle around Feng Wu and disdainfully glanced at her. \u201cIndeed beautiful, but without any spirit, too pitiful\u2014\u2014\u201dAfter she spoke, Fairy Mu Yao turned to leave. She waved her hand at Feng Wu behind her, no longer considering Feng Wu as a threatening rival in love at all.Feng Yi Ran glared at Feng Wu very fiercely before stepping quickly to overtake Jun Lin Yuan.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Our Feng clan\u2019s face has been thoroughly lost by you!\u201d Feng Liu glared at Feng Wu scornfully. \u201cDo you think that dressing up in rich attire makes you a lovable model wife. What\u2019s more, will playing hard to get cause Crown Prince to be moved? Simply ridiculous!\u201dFeng Liu rejoiced in Feng Wu\u2019s misfortune and after she took a quick glance at the latter, she quickly rushed out the door!Watching these people who rushed in like a flock of black crows disappearing instantly without a trace, Feng Wu felt quite excited!Success!She\u2019d surprisingly succeeded in deceiving them!This implied that no one knew she was little Fifth Feng, and also nobody knew that the Immortal Spirit Fruit juice was in her hands!Simply couldn\u2019t be more perfect!Feng Wu excitedly clenched her fists.She could finally start to refine the Nine Reversal Spirit pill now!Just when Feng Wu prepared to rush headlong into the pill refining room, beautiful mother held Feng Wu\u2019s hand in place. Her pair of lovely, pitiful, pretty eyes turned towards Feng Wu. \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dFeng Wu could resist anyone\u2019s pleading, but when beautiful mother miserably turned to her, how could she say even half a word of protest?\u201cMother, what is it?\u201d Feng Wu lowered her voice, speaking gently.Her mother stroked her stomach, in a miserable fashion. \u201c\u2026\u2026hungry.\u201dFeng Wu. \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cVery hungry\u2026\u2026\u201d Her mother\u2019s pair of star like, pretty eyes became increasingly pitiful.What Feng Wu normally couldn\u2019t resist the most, was beautiful mother\u2019s pleading eyes and tone of voice.Was the Nine Reversal Spirit pill important? Very important!However, compared to her mother\u2026\u2026Feng Wu let out a sigh. The Nine Reversal Spirit pill can wait, but mother\u2019s stomach was too hungry to wait.\u201cTherefore?\u201d Feng Wu helplessly turned towards her adult mother.Sometimes, she even wondered whether her and her mother\u2019s roles had been reversed? Why did she have a feeling that she\u2019s raising a daughter? Thinking to this point, Feng Wu couldn\u2019t bring herself to cry.\u201cElder Sister, Elder Sister, are you going into the kitchen? You\u2019re really cooking?\u201dAt the sidelines, little Seventh Feng was listening for quite awhile as his two eyes shone with excitement. \u201cElder Sister, it\u2019s been a very long time since you\u2019ve personally cooked for us.\u201dFeng Wu watched little Seventh Feng\u2019s eyes shining bright, and looked again at her mother\u2019s equally bright eyes. She was speechless. \u201cIs my cooking truly that tasty?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d Little Seventh Feng answered excitedly. \u201cElder Sister, don\u2019t tell me you didn\u2019t know? The fine food you cook simply makes a person lick their fingers in their mouth, makes a person wish that they can swallow their tongue along with the food!\u201d\u201cMm hm!\u201d Beautiful mother\u2019s naive to the world face, that pair of innocent, guitless eyes, pure and artless, at present, was also usually excited. She didn\u2019t merely nod, she even grasped Feng Wu\u2019s arm without letting go.Little Seventh Feng continued to flatter. \u201cIn addition, there also a kind of healing flavor in the food, making us feel extremely warm!\u201d\u201cYes yes yes!\u201d Beautiful mother\u2019s little deer like, clear eyes looked towards Feng Wu and nodded very seriously.In her previous incarnation, besides being a secret agent, Feng Wu also had another identity, and that was China\u2019s gourmet cook. She once spent three years at a Chinese professional cooking academy, and mastered seven regional cuisines as well as eight major countries\u2019 culinary styles.Feng Wu helplessly responded. \u201cFine, since you like it, then let\u2019s celebrate.\u201d\u201cWhat are we celebrating?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Of course it\u2019s to celebrate her success at obtaining the spirit fluid from the Immortal Spirit Fruit, of course it\u2019s to celebrate her ability to cultivate soon. However, none of these words escaped Feng Wu\u2019s mouth, because this brother of hers talked too much.During the time Feng Wu was busy in the kitchen\u2014\u2014Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s group of people already left the Feng residence.Although Feng Yi Ran apologized endlessly, Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s pair of deep eyes was always profoundly mysterious, making it impossible to guess what he was thinking.Feng Xun\u2019s thoughts were written on his face. His thoughts, therefore, were very obvious.He grabbed his head as he continuously and repeatedly muttered. \u201cYou guys tell me, how can Feng Wu turn out this way? How can she\u2026\u2026how did she become so colorless?\u201dFairy Mu Yao shot Feng Xun a glance. \u201cWhat\u2019s so strange about that?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dFairy Mu Yao laughed coldly. \u201cYoung Prince, think about it, what kind of situation is Feng Wu facing currently? She\u2019s a cripple now. Moreover, she\u2019s a useless person abandoned by her clan, exiled to Northern Territory City. It\u2019s impossible for her to cultivate in this lifetime, therefore, her best option now is\u2014\u2014\u201dEverybody turned towards Fairy Mu Yao, brows slightly creasing.Fairy Mu Yao continued with an air of complacency. \u201cTherefore the best option for her right now is to obtain a reputation as a virtuous and graceful girl, then get married off to a good family to live through this short lifetime. Therefore, she lost her former liveliness and became a pedantic and dull girl, anything strange about that?\u201dFeng Xun wanted to refute, but discovered that he couldn\u2019t find a single word to say. He could only dazedly look at Fairy Fu Yao\u2026\u2026was it really like that?\u201cShe\u2019s basically living in a different world than ours. She\u2019s become an ordinary person now, but we\u2014\u2014\u201dFairy Mu Yao continued, immensely proud of herself. \u201cWe are cultivators and have boundless prospects, our futures are bright. We\u2019re standing on the other shore that Feng Wu couldn\u2019t reach in her dreams! That\u2019s why, we don\u2019t have to think of Feng Wu\u2019s matters anymore in the future, just let them float away with the wind.\u201dFairy Mu Yao already completely no longer considered Feng Wu a a rival, because she didn\u2019t deserve it.Feng Xun kneaded his temples and wondered why he felt that something wasn\u2019t right. At present, they were standing at a main street.A pair of young girls walked past them. \u201cElder Sister Lin Ling, did you really send some wontons to the fifth young lady? Did she really take them home? My god, how blessed!\u201dLin Ling smugly raised her eyebrows and smiled. \u201cNaturally, what kind of person is our fifth young lady? Sincere, kindhearted, lively, quick-witted, cordial\u2026\u2026all of the words in this world added together doesn\u2019t do justice in describing her goodness.\u201d\u201cDid the secret recipe for your family\u2019s wonton shop come from Fifth Young Lady?\u201dLin Ling also didn\u2019t avoid the topic as she smiled and replied at once. \u201cIndeed, at the time, the fifth miss saw the plight that our family was in, solitary and impoverished. That\u2019s why she immediately imparted to us the technique for making the wontons without reservations, allowing our family to have a skill to rely on for our survival. In the future, be it scaling a mountain or plunging into a sea of flames on her behalf, I, Lin Ling, will never hesitate to do it.\u201d\u201cThe fifth miss is such a good person, but I heard that two people came from the imperial capital. One is the Feng family\u2019s oldest young master, one is the Feng family\u2019s sixth young lady. These two people are brimming with hostility towards our fifth miss. One can tell that they\u2019re malicious and duplicitous immediately!\u201dWhile Lin Ling and her young companion were chatting as they walked\u2014\u2014Feng Xun\u2019s several people were staring blankly at the scene!Fifth young lady? People from the imperial capital?

Lin Ling has already lived many years yet had never seen such a good-looking young man in her life. She immediately blanked out a bit when looking at him.Feng Xun was ordinarily quite intelligent. He knew that asking normally may not necessary be the best method to get information, hence, he laughed coldly. \u201cYou guys shouldn\u2019t be speaking of Feng Wu, right? That crippled Fifth Young Lady from the Feng family?\u201dThe minute Lin Ling heart these words, her complexion immediately became unsightly! She fiercely threw off Feng Xun\u2019s hand, anger floating on her face, furiously glaring at Feng Xun. \u201cWhat do you mean? What crippled Fifth Young Lady? ! Our Fifth Young Lady is incredibly awesome, how\u2019s she crippled? !\u201dThe girl named Song Yu Xin standing next to Lin Ling was also one of the girls in Feng Wu\u2019s fan club. Therefore, this seemingly mild, gentle and soft, tender young girl, also angrily glared at Feng Xun!Feng Xun was somewhat dizzy due to the scolding he received from these two young girls.It ought to be known, he was Feng Xun, Young Prince Feng, the Prince Charming how many girls from the capital yearned for. Right now, unexpectedly, people were pointing at his nose as they scolded him?Feng Xun was angered and said unhappily. \u201cWhat? Can it be that I\u2019m wrong? It goes without saying that Feng Wu is a cripple. Moreover, she seems to resemble a blockhead, dull, foolish, dumb, extremely colorless\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cHey!\u201d Lin Ling was truly angry now, her hands on her hips as she glowered at Feng Xun. \u201cAre you sick or something? ! You look handsome, but why do you say such offensive things. Has our Fifth Young Lady provoked you or irritated you? Why are you defaming her?\u201dFeng Xun pointed at his own nose. \u201cWoah woah woah, how have I defamed\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cYou still dare to say you haven\u2019t defamed our Fifth Young Lady?

Our Fifth Young Lady is vivacious, cheerful, passionate, amiable, devoted to others, how is that like a blockhead? !\u201d Lin Ling\u2019s words certainly flowed smoothly as she angrily glared at Feng Xun. In Lin Ling\u2019s eyes, Feng Wu wasn\u2019t merely their family\u2019s life saving benefactor, she was also her most admired, most sacred idol. How could others be allowed to criticize her? Simply intolerable!\u201cIndeed!\u201d The slightly younger Song Yu Xin was just like Lin Ling, both hands at her hips, fiercely agreeing with the latter!Feng Xun was told off by Lin Ling so fiercely, how could a youngster\u2019s temperament like his endure it?He laughed coldly. \u201cFeng Wu\u2019s not slow witted? Ha ha ha, I saw it with my own eyes, how can it be false?\u201dThe one who\u2019d currently become a mistress who only walks through the main door and refuses the side door, following customs like a ruler, systematic, stuffy, unbearably pedantic, her entire person radiating a stubborn and dull odor\u2026\u2026Lin Ling also burst out laughing coldly. \u201cOur Elder Sister Feng Wu is amiable, passionate, lively, carefree and takes pleasure in helping others. We\u2019ve also seen it with our own eyes!\u201d\u201cExactly right!\u201d Song Yu Xin fiercely agreed!Feng Xun sneered. \u201cDo commoners, young girls like you, even have the opportunity to see her? What kind of a joke is that.\u201dIt\u2019s not that Feng Xun looked down on them. Actually, Feng Wu currently seemed too confined, too guarded, too strait-laced. It seemed impossible for her to walk in the street.\u201cPff, cheh\u2014\u2014\u201d Lin Ling scoffed and used a kind of very contemptuous look to glance at Feng Xun. \u201cUnbelievable, you look like a model but act like a dog. Didn\u2019t expect that you\u2019re so arrogant, putting on airs! That\u2019s right, you\u2019re a young master, a young lord, you\u2019re aloof and on high, you look down on common people like us, but based on what do you say that our Fifth Young Lady is also like this?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The two old people looked to be quite old, but their speed was very fast, their faces seemed even more anxious.\u201cGrandpa, Grandma\u2014\u2014\u201d Lin Ling rushed forward without delay, two hands supporting the two old people.\u201cLittle Ling, who\u2019s denouncing our Fifth Young Lady? Tell me quickly, who dares to criticize our Fifth Young Lady! Watch me beat him to death!\u201d Grandpa Lin held a vegetable knife, gasping for breath as he ran, a face full of righteous indignation.Next to him, Grandma Lin was also greatly angered. The old one had always been gentle and kindhearted and even had never been so angry before. She grabbed Lin Ling and angrily said. \u201cLittle Ling, tell me how there can be such a person in the world, so bereft of conscience. The Fifth Young Lady is such a good person, yet surprisingly was denounced by someone? Tell me quickly, who is it!\u201dFeng Xun. \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dNo matter how, he didn\u2019t expect that merely a few sentences of ridicule became a matter that had presently reached this level!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They all pretended they didn\u2019t know him.With great difficulty, he struggled free from the sea of people. The clothes on his body were already wrinkled shapeless.\u201cYou guys are simply too rotten!\u201d Feng Xun denounced his companions.\u201cWho told your mouth to\u2026\u2026\u201d Fairy Mu Yao spread her hands out without any good intentions.\u201cDon\u2019t you hate Feng Wu a lot?

Who can imagine what got into these old commoners. They\u2019re all crazily defending Feng Wu, as if speaking a single bad word about her was an offense. These people are simply insane.\u201dSeeing Fairy Mu Yao\u2019s extremely glad appearance, a fit of depressed anger bursted forth. Feng Xun was so angry he flung his hands. \u201cIt won\u2019t do, this anger can\u2019t be negated in this way!\u201dA beam of light appeared on Xuan Yi\u2019s taut face as he suddenly said. \u201c\u2026..Feng Wu, what in the world is Feng Wu like?\u201dOnce these words were spoken, the hearts of everyone at the scene shook.Feng Wu, what in the world was she like?Was she that stiff, wooden Feng Wu?Or the masses\u2019 lively, cordial, kind and charitable Feng Wu?Xuan Yi continued. \u201cIt\u2019s possible for one person to be an accomplice, it\u2019s possible for two people to be accomplices, but so many people in the entire street all love and respect Feng Wu like that, do you guys feel that all of this can be a set up?\u201dFairy Mu Yao stepped forward, walked a few steps forward. She wanted to speak, however, on the verge of speaking what\u2019s on her mind, she swallowed those words back down.True\u2026\u2026seeing how these commoners were brandishing their vegetable knives and rolling pins\u2026\u2026how could it be faked?\u201cIf they\u2019re not accomplices, then Feng Wu was pretending to be stiff and dumb!\u201d Feng Xun was so angry that his face deformed, complexion ashen. \u201cLet\u2019s go, let\u2019s return to the Feng residence to kill the horse that\u2019s turned around (to catch someone off guard). I actually want to see what the hell Feng Wu\u2019s really like!\u201dFeng Xun furiously turned back around.Everyone turned their heads to look at Jun Lin Yuan. After all, the authority to decide whether or not they returned rested on Jun Lin Yuan, not Feng Xun.Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s gaze had been profound and reserved from start to finish, seemingly pensive. At present, he actually nodded his head slightly while walking towards the road they came from.A strange thought appeared in Xuan Yi\u2019s mind. Based on Boss Jun\u2019s personality, he surprisingly accompanied the willful Feng Xun? This matter was too strange.Feng residence.After Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s group of people departed, Feng Wu immediately let loose happily.In order to wash away Icebound Forest\u2019s bad luck, and also in order to celebrate her success at obtaining the Immortal Spirit Fruit, Feng Wu personally stepped into the kitchen, and orderly produced for her beautiful mother and little Seventh Feng a table full of fine food.Feng Wu\u2019s cooking skills truly couldn\u2019t be criticized. After all, she\u2019s formerly one of China\u2019s ranked master chef.Within an hour\u2014\u2014Ten different dishes were already served, one after another.This time, the cuisine Feng Wu made was fresh and fragrant, spicy and numbing, making a person\u2019s forefinger twitch*, a set of Szechuan cuisine.Palace filled shrimp balls.Stewed elk.Ants climbing a tree.Sweet and sour tenderloin.Tiger skin green peppers.Braised meat with white radish.Small basket steamed beef.\u2026\u2026An entire nine courses of fine cuisine, after that was added Xuanwei ham rice casserole\u2026\u2026Once the dishes were placed on the table, as far as the eyes can see, a field of fresh red.(TN: red peppers: Szechuan food is famous for being spicy)Whoosh, tears quickly fell.However, beautiful mother and little Seventh Feng\u2019s eyes shined.It\u2019s actually difficult to imagine how a person whose lifestyle was as delicate as Beautiful Mother\u2019s, surprisingly could be so fond of such fresh and savory, intensely hot and spicy, tongue numbing food, it\u2019s actually amazing.Just when everybody was about pick up their chopsticks, suddenly\u2014\u2014(*TN: Making \u2018one\u2019s forefinger jumps\u2019, or, as I prefer it, \u2018one\u2019s forefinger twitch\u2019 is a Chinese idiom that refers to when someone anticipates that a delicious, sumptuous meal is coming his/her way. I prefer \u2018twitch\u2019 to \u2018jump\u2019, because twitch calls to mind the idea of how eye twitching is believed by some people to be some kind of premonition.)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

With great difficulty, a long wished for opportunity to cling to Crown Prince Jun arrived, but was spoiled by Feng Wu just like that.Therefore, Feng Yi Ran and Feng Liu, these two brother and sister, were preparing to find Feng Wu and settle the account when they saw the crown prince\u2019s band of people return before their eyes.Feng Yi Ran was again pleasantly surprised and was going to speak, but Feng Xun directly charged inside at an astonishingly fast speed!Jun Lin Yuan and Xuan Yi\u2019s group of people also didn\u2019t even look sideways as they directly headed towards the courtyard where Feng Wu was.Feng Yi Ran and Feng Liu glanced at each other, this is\u2026..what happened? Could it be that after Feng Wu provoked Jun Lin Yuan to anger, she again provoked Young Prince Feng?Feng Liu was both worried and angry, so angry she clenched her fists. \u201cThis Feng Wu, truly good at causing trouble!\u201dAlthough Feng Yi Ran hadn\u2019t spoken, in his heart, he also had the same thoughts.It\u2019s too late to think about it. The brother and sister duo could only hurriedly follow them.Therefore, just when Feng Wu\u2019s family of three was preparing to covetously enjoy the gourmet food, the sound of hurried footsteps transmitted. Thumps loudly sounded as the door to the courtyard was directly kicked flying!Beautiful Mother and little Seventh Feng was so spooked they nearly jumped up.Feng Wu took one step forward, protectively pushing her spooked pale Beautiful Mother and little Seventh Feng behind her. Her dangerously narrowed eyes were deep and cold as they sharply focused at the place in front of the doorway.Therefore, the instant that Feng Xun entered, he directly faced Feng Wu\u2019s pair of eyes\u2014\u2014for that one split second Feng Xun\u2019s heart abruptly shook!This pair of eyes\u2026\u2026this pair of eyes seemed to be very familiar, seemed like he\u2019d seen them before somewhere!With great effort, Feng Xun tried to flip through his memories. However, this sudden revelation faded away quickly, like a flash of lighting. No matter how he racked his brains, he was able to recapture it\u2014\u2014-at this moment, Feng Wu\u2019s stunned eyes looked at the group of youngsters before her.Shoot!They, they\u2026\u2026how could they leave and return? !What happened?Feng Wu saw Feng Xun\u2019s shocked face and immediately knew that things were not good.For the sake of cooking conveniently, she changed her grand, fine clothes earlier into an extremely simple, plain dress.The exquisite phoenix jade hairpin was also removed a long time ago. Her delicate, painting like look was naturally already erased thoroughly cleanly.The current Feng Wu had washed away her flowery image in entirety and regained her former tranquility and calmness. Her appearance surprisingly hadn\u2019t suffered by any means. On the contrary, there was an additional fiery quality that made people increasingly unable to look away.Feng Xun pointed at Feng Wu. \u201cYou, you, you\u2026\u2026\u201dThis girl, those sharp, bright eyes when they faced each other, and also those rolled up sleeves. How did this resemble the dull, slow-witted beauty? !Where was the resemblance? !This was clearly still the same Feng Wu from five years ago!\u201cFeng Wu! You actually deceived us!\u201d Feng Xun aggressively arrived in front of Feng Wu, towering above and glaring at her.Ashened complexion and angry eyes indicated a kind of indignance for having been duped.\u201cHuh?\u201d Feng Wu\u2019s innocent looking face was at a loss, \u201cwhat do you mean by deceived?\u201dFeng Xun smiled coldly. \u201cStop pretending to be naive! That appearance of yours, your posturing just now, dare you say it wasn\u2019t on purpose? !\u201dFeng Wu replied innocently. \u201cHow was I posturing?\u201d\u201cYou still dare to say you weren\u2019t? Weren\u2019t you pretending to be a pretty blockhead?

Truly returning kindness with ill will.\u201dFeng Xun smiled coldly. \u201cReturning kindness with ill will? I heh heh! You surprisingly still dare to say these kinds of words. Feng Wu, you\u2019re indeed really interesting!\u201dWhile Feng Wu was pretending to be naive to distract and mislead Feng Xun, she was racking her brains for a way to escape this quandary.The reality was\u2026\u2026who knew they would attack when she was off guard!Little Seventh Feng was longingly looking at the table full of fresh, savory dishes as he rubbed his hungry, rumbling tummy, his heart in pieces.Who understood this kind of torture of being able to look, but not eat?That\u2019s why, in order to be able to quickly sit down at the dinner table, little Seventh Feng said. \u201cWasn\u2019t it because of you guys that my elder sister dressed up and made herself up!\u201dOnce these words came out, everybody looked at this fair and pretty youngster.Little Seventh Feng said. \u201cYou guys are the real deal, the crown prince\u2019s band. Especially since even the crown prince came, can\u2019t my sister dress herself up? Is there a girl in the world who can refrain from dressing herself up under these circumstances? !\u201dFeng Xun immediately blanked out\u2026\u2026he wanted to retaliate, but discovered that he was unable to argue\u2026\u2026Beautiful Mother was originally going to say that she was the one who wanted to dress up Feng Wu, but seeing Feng Xun\u2019s savage appearance, Beautiful Mother let it go, thinking it\u2019s better to forget about it. In any case, this wasn\u2019t some important matter.But though Beautiful Mother felt it wasn\u2019t important, Feng Wu actually felt that this matter was extremely important!Because the gaze with which Feng Xun and the rest looked at her with\u2026\u2026was simply too intense and provocative!Jun Lin Yuan also!This person was also acting strangely.The impression he gave off was that he\u2019d never liked any girl\u2019s name to be linked with his. However, ever since he entered this room, Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s gaze was as passionate as a burning fever, making Feng Wu\u2019s heartbeat speed up! Bewildered, at a loss for where to place her hands and feet!\u201cFeng Wu, it shouldn\u2019t be that you like our Crown Prince Jun, right?\u201d Fairy Mu Yao, who\u2019d been quiet all along suddenly gave voice.This question was like a sudden clap of thunder, smashing down on everybody\u2019s head.Shzz shzz shzz!Together, all of their gazes were like electricity shooting towards Feng Wu!Even Jun Lin Yuan, he also looked at Feng Wu\u2026\u2026Feng Wu was startled and jumped. She jumped a step away, busily waving her hands and anxiously replying. \u201cNo way? How could I? ! Isn\u2019t it the most basic courtesy to be dressed in my best? How can there be so many reasons?\u201d\u201cExcuses!\u201d Feng Xun sneered. \u201cI think you indeed like our Boss Jun, that\u2019s why you purposely wore such beautiful clothes. You deliberately pretended to be a virtuous, tender, and noble beauty to seduce our Boss Jun that way! Answer quickly, is that true?\u201dFeng Wu could clearly feel Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s gaze focusing on her. She was becoming so hot, she nearly set her own body on fire!That pair of eyes\u2026\u2026were as sharp as needles and also seemed like burning hot blazes.Feng Wu only felt her scalp go numb\u2026\u2026Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s going to get angry. What he hated most was to be liked by girls. He\u2019d kill people when he flipped out!Thinking of how she hadn\u2019t refined the Nine Reversal Spirit pill. Thinking of her weak beautiful mother with teary eyes and her naive younger brother, Feng Wu hurriedly waved her hands. \u201cNo! Absolutely not? How can I like him! What kind of a joke is that!\u201d\u201cTrying to hide it only makes it more obvious.\u201d Feng Xun saw Feng Wu getting anxious. In contrast, he was neither anxious nor impatient. His hands placed behind him, calm and composed while speaking. \u201cTo explain is to cover it up, to cover it up is to make up a story.

That blockheaded beauty\u2019s image is what our Boss Jun dislikes the most, don\u2019t you know?\u201dFeng Wu very much wanted to say that it\u2019s exactly because she knew that she deliberately dressed up as a slow-witted beauty, OK?But did she dare to say these words in front of everyone, especially in Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s presence?Feng Wu was both without choice and at a loss. \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dBeautiful Mother watched their conversation shifting back and forth endlessly. She quite unhappily pulled discreetly at Feng Wu\u2019s sleeves.Her mother was urging her to start the meal. Feng Wu understood, however, the power to take action was no longer in her hands, and she also felt quite helpless.\u201cHungry\u2026\u2026\u201d Beautiful Mother saw that Feng Wu hadn\u2019t responded. That enviable appearance that could extinguish an era biting at the light pink cherry lips very softly spoke, her voice containing a tinge of grievance.Although her voice was soft, what kind of ears did Feng Xun and the rest of them have? Naturally, every single one of them heard her.Thereupon, everyone\u2019s gaze turned towards Beautiful Mother. After that, their gazes collectively turned to the dining table.A table full of delicious fine food, fresh, savory, hot and numbing scents pervaded the whole room, simply made a person\u2019s forefinger twitch.However, Feng Xun examined Beautiful Mother, and also examined the table full of tasty, oily, flavorful food as a puzzled expression appeared in his eyes.This kind of unique beauty capable of causing the downfall of a country\u2026\u2026along with this table full of food\u2026\u2026doesn\u2019t seem to go well together.Mother poked at Feng Wu, and poked Feng Wu again\u2026\u2026there surprisingly was still no reaction. Consequently, her mother could only helplessly step forward while that pair of limpid pretty eyes swept thoroughly over everyone and suddenly asked. \u201cHave you guys eaten?\u201dFeng Xun hadn\u2019t spoken before Fairy Mu Yao laughed coldly. \u201cIs this food fit for humans? You go so far as to suggest we eat this? Eldest Young Master Feng, don\u2019t tell me that you don\u2019t think that this is a kind of offense to our Crown Prince Jun?\u201dFeng Yi Ran\u2019s heart skipped a beat as he glared at Beautiful Mother, admonishing her!Beautiful Mother ignored Feng Yi Ran. After she heard that Fairy Mu Yao wasn\u2019t interested in these dishes, she immediately became delighted!How could Feng Wu be willing for her mother to suffer any grievance. She also ignored Feng Xun and the rest as she pulled out a chair and had her mother sit down.Little Seventh Feng\u2019s eyes instantly shined as he quickly, like a little monkey, in a swoosh, leapt to Beautiful Mother\u2019s side, pulling out a chair to sit down for himself.Feng Xun. \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dFeng Yi Ran. \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dFeng Wu saw everyone blanking out and pretended to politely call out. \u201cSimple home cooking, how about we all sit down together and eat?\u201dIn all honesty!Feng Wu knew well that the crown prince\u2019s band of people were accustomed to a life of luxury. How could they be used to these chilli oiled, hot and numbing dishes?Especially Jun Lin Yuan, he\u2019d absolutely uproot himself and run away.As expected, Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s handsome, incomparably picky face wrinkled his brows, his eyes restraining in a strong aversion. \u201cHeavily oiled, hot and numbing, coarse vegetables, simple cuisine, uncomplicated, crude.\u201dFairy Mu Yao instantly rejoiced having heard what was said.She knew it!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Having grown up in a kind of place like the imperial palace, what kind of culinary delicacy had he not tried? What kind of quality of life and upbringing was that? Could he eat this kind of heavily oiled, very spicy, crude food?Simply ridiculous!Originally, when she saw the lively Feng Wu, Fairy Mu Yao\u2019s heart instantly took precautions. However, seeing how she courted disaster\u2026\u2026Fairy Mu Yao shook her head in her heart, how could Feng Wu be her opponent?However, Feng Xun watched Feng Wu\u2019s practiced care of her mother, even hanging a nice-looking bib on her\u2026\u2026he didn\u2019t know why, but his heart itched.Seeing also how quickly Feng Wu\u2019s mother and her silly brother was eating\u2026\u2026Feng Xun was astonished.These two people\u2019s speed when eating was very fast, but there was still quite a difference.Little Seventh Feng didn\u2019t care about anything as he threw everything he picked up into his mouth stuffed with food, eyes shining while he ate to his heart\u2019s content.However, Feng Wu\u2019s mother had a completely different style as the manner in which she used her chopsticks was very graceful, the motions with which she ate was extremely graceful, even the way she spit out bones was outrageously graceful\u2026\u2026Yet, during that short minute, how did that plateful of bones and shrimp heads come about?Could it be that it\u2019s really that delicious?Feng Xun suddenly felt his heart itching to do something.At once, he turned his head to tell Jun Lin Yuan. \u201cBoss Jun, if you guys want to go, then leave first, I want to stay here instead and give this a try. After all, I\u2019m really hungry after our long journey coming out of Icebound Forest.\u201dJun Lin Yuan. \u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dFeng Xun didn\u2019t see the slight change in Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s expression as he eagerly ran to face Feng Wu, both hands idle, looking down at Feng Wu from his high position.Seeing Feng Wu\u2019s confusion, Feng Xun quickly urged. \u201cHelp me put it on.\u201dFeng Wu clenched her fist discreetly. \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHowever, the one who extended the invitation previously was her. If she refused him now, then she\u2019d be too fake. Hence, Feng Wu could only helplessly squeeze out a smile towards Feng Xun and help him put the bib on.\u201cHee hee hee\u2014\u2014\u201d Feng Xun cheerfully looked for a place to sit down. Onto his chopsticks was added a palace shrimp ball which was promptly thrown into his mouth.Honestly speaking, he originally did not expect much from these foods. The reason why he sat down was merely because his heart itched to, that\u2019s all. However, once this palace shrimp ball entered his mouth and he bit down\u2014\u2014\u201cEh? !\u201d Feng Xun\u2019s limpid, beautiful startled eyes instantly shined!\u201cOh wow!\u201d Feng Xun cried in surprise, and didn\u2019t waste time saying anything more as he picked up the second red colored shrimp ball and stuffed it into his mouth. That motion was so quick, practically only a shadow was seen.Once Beautiful Mother and little Seventh Feng saw such a strong competitor, they immediately became anxious. They angrily glared at Feng Xun, this foreign fighter for food, as they also sped up.Xuan Yi was originally knitting his eyebrows. He\u2019d wanted to block Feng Xun from eating this unhealthy food, however, watching Feng Xun\u2019s appearance as gorged himself\u2026\u2026he hesitated a moment, but still asked. \u201cHow\u2019s the taste?\u201dThey\u2019re indeed eating with too much relish. Xuan Yi\u2019s stomach was already rumbling with hunger, and now his craving had been aroused.\u201cNot tasty, not tasty, not tasty at all!\u201d Feng Xun\u2019s pair of chopsticks were moving at lightning speed, mouth stuffed full of food, eyes rigidly focused on the dishes before his him.

Glistening teardrops even floated in his eyes, so much so that even steam puffed out from inside his nose!Feng Xun tricked him!This was Xuan Yi\u2019s first thought. At once, he thought of throwing down his chopsticks and leaving, however\u2014\u2014After the first hot and numbing sensation passed, an unprecedented tasting experience occurred, which prevented Xuan Yi from standing up\u2026\u2026what a strange sensation. Clearly, hot and numbing tears had all flowed out, yet he actually couldn\u2019t bear to cast the chopsticks aside. What the hell was going on?Embracing a researcher\u2019s attitude, Xuan Yi grabbed a second piece, a third piece, a fourth piece\u2026\u2026even he himself didn\u2019t realize that the speed at which he picked up food was actually getting faster and faster, faster and faster\u2026\u2026until he finally was almost going shoulder to shoulder with Feng Xun.Fairy Mu Yao became stupefied as she watched. \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d She must be mistaken?Feng Xun saw Jun Lin Yuan standing with knitted brows and at once said. \u201cBoss Jun, if you don\u2019t like it, how about you leave first?

Yes, it\u2019s true I and Xuan Yi can eat the crude food you\u2019ve cooked, but are these foods suitable for us to have Boss Jun eat? That would be blaspheming him!\u201dJun Lin Yuan. \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThat originally already dark enough expression, instantly darkened to the point\u2026..black ink could almost drip from it.Feng Wu. \u201c\u2026\u2026understood.\u201dFeng Yi Ran glared at Feng Wu. \u201cWhat kind of foods have you cooked, yet you still unapologetically called out to Crown Prince Jun? Do you want to die? !\u201dHaving spoken thus, Feng Yi Ran nodded his head and bowed towards Jun Lin Yuan, respectfully and politely flattering him as he approached. \u201cCrown Prince Jun, the resident cook is actually somewhat skillful, don\u2019t know if you\u2019ll follow me to the main hall\u2014\u2014\u201dJust when everybody thought Jun Lin Yuan would turn around and leave, he just directly pushed Feng Yi Ran away and without warning, walked to the dining table and sat down. His entire body continued to emit cold air.Feng Wu stroked her nose. Why did it seem to her that Crown Prince Jun was apparently throwing a temper, somewhat resembling little Seventh Feng\u2019s childishness when her little Seventh Feng threw a temper tantrum.Wait, wrong wrong, who was Jun Lin Yuan? He\u2019s indeed an extraordinary presence whose anger could change the heavens, how could he be throwing a tantrum?Wouldn\u2019t that be too ridiculous?Feng Xun saw Jun Lin Yuan sitting down and also blanked out, following which he reacted and smilingly said to Jun Lin Yuan. \u201cThe flavors of this meat braised in white radish is a bit lighter, suitable for you.\u201dBut Feng Wu discovered\u2014\u2014Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After that, he walked straight to Feng Wu.His figure was tall, handsome, and energetic looking. That pair of eyes stared at Feng Wu from above as he stood before her, giving her a kind of oppressive feeling.Their distance was very close, so close that there was some nervousness in Feng Wu\u2019s heart\u2026\u2026What in the world was Jun Lin Yuan thinking?The people originally eating ravenously now simultaneously turned their heads and looked at Jun Lin Yuan with a blank gaze\u2026\u2026What did he want to say to Feng Wu?But in the next second, Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s arms spread open. That pair of eyes hidden in depth focused on Feng Wu in a hawk like way. The light in his eyes was hidden, profoundly impenetrable.Feng Wu subconsciously recoiled one step. \u201cYou\u2026\u2026what do you want to do?\u201dJun Lin Yuan\u2019s expression was cold, detached, and arrogant as his gaze fixed on Feng Wu. \u201cPut it on.\u201dFeng Wu looked at the bib in her hand. It was personally made by Beautiful Mother, but the design on it came from Feng Wu.On the bright red bib was a chubby little yellow duck, both soft and cute, which suited her mother and sweet brother\u2019s personality very much. Feng Xun\u2019s personality also barely fit, however, Jun Lin Yuan\u2026\u2026Feng Wu raised her head, looked at that reserved, proud and pampered handsome face of Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s, then looked again at the cute, soft, adorable bib\u2026\u2026surprisingly, Jun Lin Yuan wanted to put this on? There\u2019s nothing wrong with his brains, right?There was clearly aversion expressed as Jun Lin Yuan looked at the bib, but he just stared at Feng Wu, just rigidly stared at Feng Wu.\u201cFine fine fine, you\u2019re the one who wants to wear this, so you can\u2019t blame me for it.\u201d Feng Wu cleanly cast away any blame, after which she passed the bib to Jun Lin Yuan.However, Jun Lin Yuan didn\u2019t take it. His voice was as ice-cold as before, attitude similarly arrogant, only speaking three words as if giving a command. \u201cPut it on.\u201dFeng Wu secretly clenched her fists. Doesn\u2019t this crown prince have hands? Asking others to serve him for a simple thing like putting on a bib?But Feng Wu didn\u2019t have the nerve say these words out loud. Currently, her greatest desire was for Jun Lin Yuan and company to leave after they finish eating this meal, to go very far away, so that she could refine the Nine Reversal Spirit pill in peace.Therefore, Feng Wu secretly swore and made a fist as she put on a humble appearance. She squeezed out a smile, curving her mouth and eyes. \u201cSince Crown Prince Jun has commanded it, I dare not disobey.\u201dJun Lin Yuan stood bolt upright energetically. He was an entire one and a half head taller than Feng Wu. Therefore, she needed to stand on tiptoe in order to be able to tie the bib around him.In order to save time, both of Feng Wu\u2019s hands quickly wrapped themselves around Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s powerful waist, then her hands nimbly tied a bow.Jun Lin Yuan looked down and saw a small head, as if a small deer was nudging back and forth against his chest. He felt it to be somewhat cute. Moreover, a kind of desire also birthed, a kind of impulse to poke at this head.And at this moment, Feng Xun was watching this scene before him.From the angle that he was looking at, it seemed as if Feng Wu took the initiative to throw herself into Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s arms. Hence, Feng Xun clicked his tongue twice and said. \u201cLittle Feng Wu, and you still say that you don\u2019t like our Boss Jun? If you don\u2019t like him, why would you throw yourself into his arms? Tut tut, untruthful women are the most annoying!\u201dFeng Wu. \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dShe glared at Feng Xun, so angry she nearly charged at him!In what way did she like Jun Lin Yuan? How did things become this way?Thinking of this, Feng Wu shot a glance at Feng Xun displeasingly. \u201cAm I not tying a knot at his waist? Is it not necessary to fasten it at the waist?\u201dFeng Xun replied in a righteous tone. \u201cWhen you tied it at the waist for me earlier, you actually eagerly ran around behind me and took care of it in one second. But now, look at you \u2014\u2014\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It hurt so much that tears came to her eyes. As if this wasn\u2019t disastrous enough, what\u2019s worse was that her body involuntarily collided forward\u2014\u2014Thump!Feng Wu\u2019s head bumped into Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s abs!From other people\u2019s viewpoint, this was clearly\u2014\u2014\u201cWah! Little Feng Wu, and you even said that you\u2019re not throwing yourself into his arms? You untruthful girl!\u201dFeng Xun was throwing meat into his mouth while he watched this scene.Feng Wu was so angry that her face turned red as she hastily supported herself against Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s powerful and strong waist, taking a step back without delay!Jun Lin Yuan watched Feng Wu attentively from his high vantage point. His eyes were very deep, very bright, just like the myriad gloriously bright stars.Feng Wu\u2019s gaze met Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s, caught off guard. Sparks brought lightning~~The two people subconsciously turned their faces away!For a time, the situation\u2026\u2026was somewhat awkward.\u201cCough cough.\u201d Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s right hand curled into a fist as he coughed gently. He clenched his fist and returned to his original position.A piece of meat remained unchewed in Feng Xun\u2019s mouth, his cheek bulging. Just like that, he watched dazedly as Jun Lin Yuan returned, then muttered. \u201cBoss Jun\u2026\u2026he\u2019s just going to let himself get hugged for free like that?\u201dFeng Wu dumbfoundedly held onto her forehead and emphasized to Feng Xun. \u201cIt, really, was, an, accident!\u201dFeng Xun\u2019s pair of handsome eyes blinked and replied. \u201cAccident? Heh heh, then does this accident of yours happen frequently? I really want to know\u2026\u2026\u201dFeng Wu didn\u2019t answer as she directly picked up the dish in front of Feng Xun. \u201cYour mouth\u2019s unable to stop even when eating, so don\u2019t bother eating anymore.\u201dFeng Xun\u2019s hands immediately anxiously protected the food in front of him. \u201cDon\u2019t don\u2019t don\u2019t! Little Great Aunt, I was wrong, is that ok? Right right right, it was accidental, everything was just an accident, you didn\u2019t deliberately get close to Boss Jun. You didn\u2019t create an accident on purpose. You don\u2019t like our Boss Jun, is that alright now?\u201dFeng Wu. \u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dWhy was it that after Feng Xun said these things, it seemed to only make things worse? It was clearly an accident!\u201cHumph!\u201d This group of chowhounds almost caused Fairy Mu Yao to die of anger.Could Feng Xun have a bit more of a moral backbone! As the Feng Prince\u2019s Mansion\u2019s most respected young prince, what kind of good food had he not eaten before? Yet he surprisingly became hypnotized by these few dishes of spicy, chili oiled food?Even Jun Lin Yuan also unexpectedly lifted his chopsticks to pick up food. What happened to the healthy foods they mentioned before?Feng Yi Ran\u2019s line of sight had always remained on Jun Lin Yuan. When he saw Jun Lin Yuan pick up a bright red piece of meat, then knit his brow as he picked up a second piece\u2026\u2026he knew that Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s not leaving for the time being.At once, Feng Yi Ran raised his hand to call out. \u201cAlright, alright, everybody\u2019s hungry, let\u2019s sit down and eat first. It\u2019s not too late to say what we need to say after everybody\u2019s finished eating.\u201dAfter speaking, Feng Yi Ran then sat down next to Jun Lin Yuan on his own accord.Feng Yi Ran felt excited because an opportunity to sit next to Jun Lin Yuan like this was incredibly rare!It was easiest to relax around a table full of food and drinks, as well as easier to decrease the distance between one another. Therefore\u2026\u2026he must take hold of the opportunity this time.However, just as Feng Yi Ran was going to call out to Feng Liu and Fairy Mu Yao to sit down\u2014\u2014Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The speed at which they used their chopsticks became increasingly quicker.Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s brows also couldn\u2019t help but creased slightly.Feng Xun, Xuan Yi, little Seventh Feng, Beautiful Mother\u2026\u2026each hand was faster than the other!Especially Beautiful Mother. Feng Wu already helped her refill two cups of water and changed three plates, yet her stomach actually still looked flat and slim. Don\u2019t know where all the stuff she ate went.Feng Yi Ran was constantly paying attention to Jun Lin Yuan.Whichever dish Jun Lin Yuan picked food from, he would pick up food from the same dish.Regardless at what speed or frequency Jun Lin Yuan was eating, he would immediately also follow suit.Feng Yi Ran was thinking that if he followed Crown Prince Jun\u2019s pace closely, if he followed Crown Prince Jun\u2019s example all the way through, Jun Lin Yuan would be able to see his sincerely for sure.However\u2026\u2026Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s brows were creased more and more deeply as he clearly became a bit annoyed.After Jun Lin Yuan picked up a piece of steamed beef, there was only one final piece left.Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s speed then accelerated a little, he originally was going to\u2026\u2026However, in the next moment, before he could pick up that last piece, Feng Yi Ran\u2019s chopsticks followed closely behind and took away the last piece of steamed beef.Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s face immediately darkened!Feng Yi Ran totally wasn\u2019t aware of this as he stuffed the beef into his mouth while he praised. \u201cMm, the flavor of this steamed beef is pretty good, fresh, flavorful, full-bodied, its aroma lingering on the lips and palate, making people forget its crudeness when eating it\u8ba9\u4eba\u98df\u4e4b\u5fd8\u4fd7.\u201dWhile Feng Yi Ran was singing praises, he was also narrowing his eyes intoxicatedly.Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s profound eyes streaked over the half piece of steamed beef remaining in Feng Yi Ran\u2019s bowl before he expressionlessly changed the direction of his gaze towards the piece of sweet and sour pork not far away.Fairy Mu Yao and Feng Liu glanced at each other, as they laughed simultaneously.Fairy Mu Yao proudly raised her chin. \u201cThese dishes looks so crude yet surprisingly, you guys are able to eat them? You guys really aren\u2019t picky, but someone like me is quite picky.\u201dFeng Yi Ran called out to Fairy Mu Yao. \u201cMu Jun Zhu, these dishes look crude, but are somewhat special in some respects when they\u2019re eaten. Try it if you don\u2019t believe me.\u201dWhile Feng Yi Ran was speaking, he was using his chopsticks to pick up a piece of sweet and sour pork from the plate right in front of him. He gave it to Fairy Mu Yao, who turned her back on it.There were only two pieces left on that plate. One piece was given to Fairy Mu Yao\u2026\u2026In order to show that he also loved his sister, Feng Yi Ran then used his chopsticks to pick up the last piece of sweet and sour pork and placed it in Feng Liu\u2019s bowl, enthusiastically calling out. \u201cSixth Sister, hurry and try this, a bit sour, a bit sweet, there\u2019s actually a special taste.\u201dIn order to show Jun Lin Yuan that he\u2019s an older brother who took such good care of his younger sister, he completely didn\u2019t notice that Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s chopsticks had already extended halfway towards the sweet and sour pork dish\u2026\u2026Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s face\u2026\u2026was already so dark that black ink could drip from it.In actuality\u2014\u2014When Mu Yao thought about Jun Lin Yuan sitting right in front of her, how could she eat this kind of greasy sweet and sour food? Moreover, it\u2019s easy for that crude red color to stain the corners of her mouth and her teeth. Thus, Fairy Mu Yao said with notable aversion. \u201cI won\u2019t eat it even if I die. Don\u2019t force me, Brother Feng!\u201dIf Fairy Mu Yao could think of this point, how would Feng Liu not think of it?Thus, she also immediately put aside her chopsticks and shook her head. \u201cNot eating, I\u2019m not eating even if you kill me!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If it weren\u2019t for the fact that outsiders were in their presence, at this moment, he certainly would\u2019ve immediately flicked Feng Liu\u2019s head and taught her a lesson. This is a difficult to come by opportunity to perform in front of Crown Prince Jun, yet she unexpectedly couldn\u2019t see it? She\u2019s simply too stupid!Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s gaze swept across Fairy Mu Yao\u2019s plate, but Fairy Mu Yao didn\u2019t react unusually.However, when Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s gaze swept across Feng Liu\u2019s face\u2014\u2014Feng Liu only felt her heartbeat speed up as her face turned crimson! Her fingers subconsciously played with the hair which hung down as she bashfully dared not raise her head.Feng Xun and company devoured their food ravenously. How were these nine plates enough for them to eat? Very quickly, only red sauce was left over.\u201cYou\u2019re really not eating?\u201d Feng Xun stared at Fairy Mu Yao.Fairy Mu Yao barely nodded her head when \u2018woosh\u2019 that piece of sweet and sour pork on her plate quickly entered Feng Xun\u2019s mouth.\u201cYou\u2019re also not eating?\u201d Feng Xun asked Feng Liu also.Feng Liu simply didn\u2019t know what response she should give. It\u2019s but a piece of meat, how could Young Prince Feng\u2026\u2026he\u2019s actually the Feng family\u2019s young prince, the young prince who walked arrogantly at the capital. Right now, he\u2019d unexpectedly shown this kind of mannerism?\u201cReally not eating? !\u201d Feng Xun was somewhat impatient.Feng Liu finally responded as she hurriedly nodded. \u201cNo\u2014\u2014\u201dHowever, the one word barely left Feng Liu\u2019s mouth when Xuan Yi\u2019s chopsticks were already in the air as the piece of sweet and sour pork quickly flew towards him.\u201cYoung, Second, Xuan!\u201d Feng Xun really felt like fighting it out with Xuan Yi!Xuan Yi spread out his hands as he leisurely ate, making Feng Xun so angry he wanted to charge over again.Fairy Mu Yao simply couldn\u2019t bear to continue looking at them. \u201cIsn\u2019t it only a piece of meat? Isn\u2019t it only a meal? Are you guys really going to go that far?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t understand!\u201d Feng Xun impatiently glared at her.Fairy Mu Yao truly didn\u2019t understand\u2026\u2026why did she feel as if Feng Xun despised her?Seeing that everyone had eaten to their heart\u2019s content, various urges appeared in Feng Wu\u2019s heart. Since everyone had eaten their fill, why don\u2019t they hurry and leave. Why was it that each and every one of them sat on their chairs without standing up as if they\u2019re paralyzed? How much longer were they going to sit there? She still needed to refine the Immortal Spirit Fruit\u2019s essence fluid!Feng Xun noticed how Feng Wu was continually staring at everyone. He said in a displeased manner \u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201dFeng Wu\u2019s mind was busy thinking to herself about the Immortal Spirit Fruit. Consequently, she spoke subconsciously without thinking. \u201cI\u2019m wondering about when you guys are leaving.\u201dAfter she finished saying that, Feng Wu suddenly woke with a start, and eventually became aware of what she\u2019d just said. She immediately became horrified!How could she just say what was on her mind? ! My god! Wasn\u2019t she obviously driving people away? Was she going to be killed by Crown Prince Jun? !Feng Xun was stunned all at once. Everyone at the scene also froze in place\u2026\u2026Feng Wu. \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d What\u2019s to be done? How\u2019s she going to remedy this situation? She\u2019s indeed a cripple right now, yet she offended the crown prince\u2019s band of people!However, what Feng Wu didn\u2019t think of no matter what was that Feng Xun unexpectedly said \u2018woah\u2019 as an ambiguous smile appeared on his face. \u201cTsk tsk tsk, little Feng Wu, oh little Feng Wu, you untruthful girl, you\u2019re finally going to be truthful now? !\u201dFeng Wu. \u201c\u2026\u2026what?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re reluctant to part with our Boss Jun.

In her mind, she was saying [You guys should leave quickly, I want to refine my Nine Reversal Spirit Pill, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\u2026\u2026] Therefore, her expression appeared extremely complicated.Feng Xun thought that he\u2019d truly exposed Feng Wu\u2019s inner thoughts, so he immediately became very proud of himself. \u201cHaven\u2019t I said it. She likes our Boss Jun, this girl\u2019s always liked to be untruthful.

In this way, he can move forward with the marriage if he wanted to, and can sign the annulment at any time whenever he felt like it. The power is completely within his hands, truly despicable!Feng Wu truly felt helpless as she begged Feng Xun to let her go. \u201cSo\u2026\u2026when in the world are you guys leaving?\u201dFeng Xun\u2019s gaze swept across the shiny plates on the tabletop, thinking if they left now, he didn\u2019t know when he\u2019d eat these again next time\u2026\u2026that won\u2019t do, he must think of a way to stay here!Feng Xun glanced at Feng Wu with disdain. \u201cSince you\u2019re so reluctant to part with us, we\u2019ll then\u2026\u2026\u201dJust at this time, distinct sounds of footsteps transmitted from outside.The Feng clan\u2019s butler quickly entered. He looked at Feng Wu, then looked at Feng Yi Ran\u2026\u2026he finally still walked to Feng Wu\u2019s side, lowered his voice, and spoke softly by Feng Wu\u2019s ear.Feng Wu still hadn\u2019t reacted when little Seventh Feng cried out in alarm and jumped up. \u201cWhat? The City Lord came? ! He shouldn\u2019t be making things difficult for us again, right? !\u201dFeng Xun frowned. \u201cIsn\u2019t Bi Yun Fei the Northern Territory City\u2019s city lord? Isn\u2019t this old Bi\u2019s character very good? Why would he make things difficult for you guys?\u201dLittle Seventh Feng was dumbfounded. \u201cYou\u2019re a young prince, of course he\u2019d treat you well, but in regards to the way he treat us, he\u2019s not the least bit polite. Originally, he was even going to have his retarded son marry my older sister forcefully!\u201d\u201cLittle Seventh!\u201d Feng Wu shouted softly.\u201cWhat? !\u201d Once Feng Xun heard these words, he immediately became dissatisfied! If little Feng Wu became the daughter-in-law of another family, who\u2019s going to cook for him again in the future? If he wanted to eat, could it be that he\u2019d have to run all the way to the Northern Territory City Lord\u2019s home, how\u2019s that going to work? Did Bi Yun Fei have such a big face? ! (Was he that distinguished?)Feng Wu sighed in her heart.She originally thought that after this meal, she\u2019d be able to happily refine that pill, but she didn\u2019t expect one hindrance to appear after another. Truly made a person overwhelmed\u2026\u2026if it was possible, Feng Wu wouldn\u2019t have agreed to cook this meal no matter what.Feng Wu waved her hand at the Feng family\u2019s butler. \u201cTell the City Lord we\u2019re currently entertaining honored guests. It\u2019s not convenient to see him, have him return first\u2014\u2014\u201dFeng Wu\u2019s voice hadn\u2019t dropped when Feng Yi Ran frowned and coldly stopped her. \u201cFeng Wu, have you asked for my opinion? Yet you already directly arranged for him to go back?\u201dFeng Wu frowned as she looked at Feng Yi Ran.Feng Yi Ran laughed coldly. \u201cThe City Lord of Northern Territory City was invited by me for a visit.

Feng Wu feared nothing in heaven or earth, but when Jun Lin Yuan used that pair of profoundly mysterious, beautiful eyes to focus on her, her heart would involuntarily constrict.Feng Xun saw Feng Wu turn her head and ignore him. He again couldn\u2019t stand the alienation as his finger poked her, and poked her again.\u201cWhat\u2019re you doing?\u201d Feng Wu wasn\u2019t in a good mood as she turned her head around and shot a glance at Feng Xun.\u201cDid Bi Yun Fei really want to force you to become his family\u2019s daughter-in-law?\u201d Feng Xun asked inquisitively.Feng Wu took in a deep breath. \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dJust at this time, Feng Yi Ran smilingly came in along with City Lord Bi.City Lord Bi looked to be a middle aged man who\u2019s smiling from ear to ear, facial features handsome and bright, all smiles, appearing quite warm and affable, very much like a harmless, domesticated animal.However, the corners of Feng Xun\u2019s mouth curled a little.To be able to become a city lord, especially the city lord of a city like Northern Territories City, Bi Yun Fei was certainly not a simple character.Sure enough, Bi Yun Fei came forward and deferentially paid his respects to Jun Lin Yuan.Jun Lin Yuan aloofly and cryptically sat at the seat of honor, his gaze as cold as the chilly frost, without paying much attention to the smiling City Lord Bi.Of the people at the scene, no one felt that Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s attitude was bad, because he had always been this ice-cold.City Lord Bi again took the initiative to greet Feng Xun. \u201cYoung Prince Feng, after I left the capital, it\u2019s been awhile since we\u2019ve met. At that time, the young prince was only seven years old, yet now, you\u2019ve already grown up.\u201dFeng Xun looked up and down as he sized up City Lord Bi, examining him closely.City Lord Bi\u2019s hairs stood on ends somewhat as he was scrutinized by Feng Xun. \u201cIn regards to this humble one, the young prince\u2026\u2026is there something you\u2019re displeased with?\u201dFeng Xun rubbed his chin and spoke unhurriedly. \u201cI heard that City Lord Bi has a son?\u201dCity Lord Bi\u2019s heart bathumped, only he knew that his son had cerebral palsy since birth. After his son grew up, his IQ, his intelligence continued to remain the same as a five year old\u2019s. However, what he liked the most were beautiful women. Without a beautiful woman before him, he simply didn\u2019t feel like eating. That\u2019s why City Lord Bi developed the intent towards Feng Wu.City Lord Bi took measure of Jun Lin Yuan and Feng Wu.At the time, the whole world knew about Jun Lin Yuan and Feng Wu\u2019s engagement. After that, the whole world also knew about Feng Wu becoming a cripple. Everybody knew that the imperial family spurned Feng Wu, that Crown Prince Jun abandoned Feng Wu.City Lord Bi discovered that the gaze with which Jun Lin Yuan looked at Feng Wu was brimming with fury, and he immediately became delighted!The reason why he took advantage of this opportunity to come, firstly, was to fawn on Jun Lin Yuan, secondly, it was to observe Crown Prince Jun\u2019s attitude before deciding whether he could take the step to force Feng Wu into marriage.Just now, it would appear that Crown Prince Jun was quite disgusted with Feng Wu\u2026\u2026Thinking this way, City Lord Bi\u2019s amassed a smile across his whole face. \u201cYes yes yes, this official indeed has a son, it\u2019s just that he failed to live up to expectations. He\u2019s already so old, yet still hasn\u2019t taken a wife. This indeed makes a person\u2019s heart break down.\u201dFeng Xun smiled yet wasn\u2019t smiling. \u201cSo, what do you think about Feng Wu?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In those days, the Feng clan indeed started out from here. That\u2019s why the Feng clan had always wanted to form an alliance with the city lord of Northern Territories City.Feng Yi Ran\u2019s goal in coming back this time was precisely to form a relationship with this City Lord.Immediately, Feng Yi Ran put on a smile. \u201cLittle Wu? Did the young prince push Little Wu and the City Lord family\u2019s Young one into a marriage? There\u2019s truly no need to say anything else. When combining the names of the two of them, it becomes \u2018Marvelous Dance Moves\u2019 (Wu Dong Qi Ji). This is such a good omen!\u201dFeng Liu originally quite loathed Feng Wu, jealous and fearful of Feng Wu. Of course she knew the City Lord Bi family\u2019s retarded son, that\u2019s why her eyes immediately shined. \u201cBi Liang Dong, I\u2019ve also heard of this name. Reportedly, he looked like a model genius, incomparably bright and handsome, oh my, Fifth Elder Sister, really, congratulations to you.\u201dWith this one sentence, she directly turned Feng Wu\u2019s marriage into a reality.City Lord Bi originally was still a bit worried at heart, after all, Feng Wu was someone whom Jun Lin Yuan rejected. If his heart still held some feelings then wouldn\u2019t the whole matter be ruined? Therefore, he discreetly observed Jun Lin Yuan.This grandpa like crown prince was cold, strict, and unapproachable, aloof and mysterious. In fact, one can\u2019t discern any other state of mind from him\u2026\u2026Feng Xun had always been Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s spokesperson, since he said that, then that meant that Jun Lin Yuan didn\u2019t care about this matter at all!Thinking up to this point, City Lord Bi smiled at once and responded. \u201cIt would seem that everyone looks quite favorably upon this marriage?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s of course!\u201d Feng Yi Ran scrambled to say. \u201cThis is a huge happy occasion! Don\u2019t tell me that there\u2019s still someone who\u2019s opposed to this, is that possible? A planned date can not compare to a fortuitous date. How about we make today the day to write the marriage contract?\u201dJun Lin Yuan\u2019s eyes were deeply hidden, so deep, the depths could not be seen.City Lord Bi burst into laughter. \u201cWon\u2019t this be a bit too rushed? Is it not necessary to return to the capital and ask your old father about it, or ask the clan elders?\u201dThe current chief of the Feng clan was Feng Wu\u2019s father\u2019s elder brother, uncle Feng Huan Yu, who is also Feng Yi Ran\u2019s father.Feng Yi Ran and City Lord Bi had their arms around each other\u2019s shoulders, smiling from ear to ear. \u201cNot an issue, not an issue, I\u2019m the eldest brother. This is the so-called eldest brother takes father\u2019s place*. As the older brother, I can indeed be in charge of this marriage. Moreover, today, even His Highness the Crown Prince is here. I invite Crown Prince Jun to sign as the witness. This matter will become a somewhat glorious matter, right?\u201d(TN: In Chinese culture, the eldest brother can take a father\u2019s place when father isn\u2019t around. Furthermore, during ancient times, marriage was often determined by the parents. In addition, the emperor had the highest authority in bestowing marriages.)Once City Lord Bi heard this, he immediately became elated!These words from Feng Yi Ran were simply too agreeable with his intentions!As long as Jun Lin Yuan signed his name as the witness, then what else was there to worry about? Thinking about how his own retarded son had been lovesick ever since he saw Feng Wu once before, City Lord Bi wished that he could push Feng Wu into marriage immediately.\u201cThat\u2019s great, that\u2019s great, congratulations Elder Sister, good tidings to you, Elder Sister\u2014\u2014\u201d Feng Liu grabbed Feng Wu\u2019s hand. It was difficult to cover up the excitement in her heart.Feng Wu laughed coldly to herself, these people truly even thought that she\u2019s so easy to bully, right?Feng Wu hadn\u2019t even spoken before Feng Xun already laughed coldly. \u201cHold on!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He originally thought this man wasn\u2019t foolish, yet he didn\u2019t expect that the man truly was an idiot after all, a huge dumbass.\u201cThis cup of wedding wine, hah, won\u2019t be drinkable, I think.\u201d Feng Wu smiled but wasn\u2019t smiling.City Lord Bi and Feng Yi Ran spoke in unison. \u201cCan it be that Young Prince Feng, all of you are planning to return to the capital?\u201dFeng Xun glanced at Jun Lin Yuan, even though there\u2019s not much change in his expression, however, people who truly understood Jun Lin Yuan all knew that his current mood was not very good. Also, when His Highness the Crown Prince\u2019s mood wasn\u2019t good, he liked to kill.\u201cReturn to the capital?\u201d Feng Xun touched his mouth and glanced at Feng Wu. In light of this meal, he was currently reluctant to leave the Northern Territories.\u201cOf course?\u201d Feng Yi Ran asked inquisitively.To a young prince like Feng Xun, merely a single sentence from him was enough to block this matter. However, he didn\u2019t plan on blocking this matter at all, because\u2026\u2026why would he help this dishonest young girl? He won\u2019t do the work if he\u2019s not going to gain anything from it.Feng Xun complacently shot a glance at Feng Wu. Currently, the one who\u2019d encountered trouble was little Feng Wu, it had nothing to do with him. That\u2019s why he was planning on being an onlooker sitting on the wall. He\u2019s going to see if this girl was still the bright, farsighted girl she was five years ago, able to move unobstructed through obstacles.However, right at this time, Feng Wu\u2019s hand grabbed onto Feng Xun and pulled him to one side.\u201cWhat\u2019re you doing? A gentleman uses his mouth and not his fist, don\u2019t pull and tug at me, you\u2019ll tarnish my innocence!\u201d Feng Xun earnestly glared at Feng Wu.Feng Wu stared at Feng Xun as if she\u2019s looking at a mental case then lowered her voice. \u201cHelp me settle this matter.\u201dSeeing that Feng Wu had begged him, he became pleased with himself at once as he proudly raised his chin like an elder. \u201cIn any case, the one forced into marriage isn\u2019t me, what relation do I have with you that I should help you?\u201dFeng Wu\u2019s expression was tranquil and calm. \u201cLet\u2019s make a business deal?\u201dFeng Xun was curious. \u201cWhat kind of business deal?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you like eating these savory, hot and numbing, delicious food a lot?\u201dFeng Xun stomped his feet. \u201cWho likes to eat? !

Tut tut, you truly can act!\u201dFeng Wu\u2019s mood wasn\u2019t the least bit good as she glared at Feng Xun. She didn\u2019t have time to pick a fight with him and spoke directly. \u201cOnce you help me settle this matter, I\u2019ll cook for you a meal of fragrant, hot and numbing cuisine, an entire table full of dishes, all yours, only yours!\u201dOnce Feng Xun heard this, his eyes shined like stars, fiercely wiping away saliva, he almost agreed right away!But he shook his head in a customary manner. \u201cOne meal?

This Feng Wu unexpectedly still had such good fortune? !Feng Liu and Fairy Mu Yao also glared at Feng Wu extremely enviously! How did such good fortune come to her? !Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s pair of profoundly deep eyes also stared at Feng Xun, the depths of his eyes were deep and unfathomable\u2026\u2026Once Feng Xun heard that, he shivered from head to toe. \u201cWhat the hell? Me, marry her? Are your eyes lame!\u201dCity Lord Bi immediately became bewildered. \u201cThen\u2026\u2026\u201dFeng Xun placed his right hand on Feng Wu\u2019s shoulder as he arrogantly raised his chin and declared complacently. \u201cLittle Feng Wu is my, Second Feng\u2019s exclusive lady chef, no one\u2019s allowed to approach her. You, City Lord Bi wants to take her as your daughter-in-law? Have you asked for my opinion, yet?\u201dCity Lord Bi. \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dEverybody. \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dNo one at the scene anticipated that Feng Xun would step up. Even more so, they didn\u2019t anticipate his intense, protective attitude towards Feng Wu.Feng Yi Ran smiled bitterly as he responded. \u201cYoung Prince, don\u2019t joke around, whether good or bad, Feng Wu is our Feng clan\u2019s fifth young lady. How does it make sense for her to be someone\u2019s kitchen lady? This marriage is one that our Feng clan and Bi family mutually consented upon. It\u2019s a done deal.\u201dFeng Xun laughed coldly. \u201cYour Feng clan\u2019s consent? Have you asked for young Feng Wu\u2019s opinion?\u201d\u201cMy Elder Sister doesn\u2019t agree! My Elder Sister definitely doesn\u2019t want to get married with the city lord\u2019s retarded son! He\u2019s an imbecile! A retard! An idiot who only knows how to drool!\u201d Little Seventh Feng yelled loudly!Everyone at the scene, without exception. \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dEven though everybody knew about the city lord\u2019s retarded son, nobody exposed it. Now that the matter\u2019s exposed by little Seventh Feng\u2019s speech, it\u2019s practically impossible to continue pretending.Feng Wu still hadn\u2019t spoken yet when Feng Yi Ran responded. \u201cEven though Master Bi\u2019s intelligence is a bit flawed, everything else about him is still quite good.\u201dSo it turned out that you, Feng Yi Ran, also knew that there was a problem with Bi Liang Dong\u2019s brain?Feng Yi Ran laughed again as he said. \u201cActually, right now, Little Wu, she is also a cripple who can no longer cultivate. Speaking of which, this is also equivalent to a deformity. Therefore, her current value is also only based on her good looking face. It\u2019s already her enormous good fortune that she can marry into the Bi family. How can she not agree to it?\u201dFeng Wu still hadn\u2019t spoken when Feng Yi Ran waved his hand to say. \u201cWhat\u2019s more, the Eldest Brother is akin to a father, since Second Uncle is no longer alive, the matter of her marriage can be decided by me, this eldest brother of hers. It\u2019s not necessary to ask for her opinion.Feng Wu. \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dFeng Xun was stunned upon hearing that. He didn\u2019t expect that the Feng Yi Ran who normally flattered and curried favor with him surprisingly could have such an overbearing attitude when facing Feng Wu. This simply put a person\u2026\u2026in a bad mood!\u201cIf I insist on opposing this, then?\u201d Feng Xun laughed coldly.\u201cYoung Prince, don\u2019t joke around\u2026\u2026\u201d Feng Yi Ran laughed bitterly.\u201cI\u2019m not joking with you, I, Feng Xun, am against this, completely against this, using my life to oppose this!

However, Jun Lin Yuan unexpectedly directly spoke the words \u2018get out of here\u2019\u2026\u2026Bi Yun Fei\u2019s originally beaming face immediately looked like he\u2019d been slapped by someone, red on one side, green on the other.Feng Yi Ran also didn\u2019t expect that Jun Lin Yuan surprisingly didn\u2019t give the City Lord any face as his own face became paler than pale. \u201cYour Highness Crown Prince\u2026\u2026.don\u2019t you\u2026\u2026.dislike Feng Wu?

Stand up.\u201d In any case, he wouldn\u2019t be able to snatch her from him.Wah! Feng Xun was so moved his cheeks suddenly streamed with tears! As it turned out, Boss Jun shielded him so much! Boss Jun actually was so good to him!

With merely a few words from Jun Lin Yuan and Feng Wu\u2019s position was reduced from being a precious young lady from the Feng family into a kitchen lady. It\u2019s unknown how she offended Jun Lin Yuan.If other people said these words, City Lord Bi felt that there\u2019d still be room to maneuver. Even if the emperor opened his mouth, City Lord Bi could still say a few words in response.\u2026.however, now that Jun Lin Yuan had opened his mouth, City Lord Bi didn\u2019t dare to utter another word. He knew that in this lifetime, Feng Wu was doomed to only be a kitchen lady.Thinking of this, the City Lord\u2019s enthusiasm came to an end. On behalf of Feng Wu, and also on behalf of his retarded son, he sighed a long sigh.Merely, he was a calculating man to begin with. In the blink of an eye, a smiling expression again spread across his face. \u201cHis Highness Crown Prince ought to remain at Northern Territories City for a period of time, right? This humble official already commanded people to make preparations at Lingering Gardens. If His Highness isn\u2019t against it, how about staying at Lingering Gardens?\u201dJun Lin Yuan\u2019s people arrived quietly, so the City Lord didn\u2019t have a chance to receive him. With great difficulty, he presently met with him. How could he let go of this opportunity?Once Feng Yi Ran heard this, his heart immediately became a bit worried.So it turned out that the marriage the City Lord spoke of was fake, but snatching away the crown prince was the real thing!Bi Yun Fei wanted to curry favor with Jun Lin Yuan, could it be that Feng Yi Ran didn\u2019t also want to? He actually came carrying a mission from their clan!Thinking up to this point, Feng Yi Ran\u2019s face also squeezed out a smiling expression. \u201cYour Highness, even though our Feng residence is somewhat old, nevertheless, it\u2019s located in a quiet and secluded environment, elegant and peaceful.

Push!Just when Feng Wu was about to explain, Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s pair of scorching, deep eyes focused on her face.Feng Wu only felt a numbness radiate through her scalp while her back shivered\u2026\u2026Feng Wu summoned up her courage. \u201cHow was I grabbing you? I was clearly pushing you away!\u201dFeng Xun laughed heartily. How could someone as narcissistic as him believe these words from Feng Wu?\u201cThis girl is indeed saying one thing while feeling something else. Is it possible for me to fail at understanding you? Tch tch\u2014\u2014\u201d Feng Xun immediately waved his hand to indicate that Feng Wu need not speak anymore. After that, he smugly ran to Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s side.\u201cBoss Jun\u2026\u2026\u201d Feng Xun muttered something for awhile.Jun Lin Yuan\u2019s eyebrows were originally creased. It\u2019s unclear whether he was unwilling\u2026\u2026after all, no one could really guess Crown Prince Jun\u2019s profoundly impenetrable thoughts.Everyone only saw Jun Lin Yuan finally nodding his head slightly.\u201cYeah!\u201d Feng Xun was especially happy as his eyebrows jumped while he shot a glance at Feng Wu. \u201cYou should be happy now.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Feng Wu was confused.Feng Xun\u2019s pair of hands clasped behind him as he turned his head and focused on City Lord Bi, speaking complacently. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to be staying at Lingering Gardens, save it for your son to live in.\u201d\u201cThen you\u2019re all\u2026\u2026\u201d Profound regret appeared within City Lord Bi\u2019s eyes.\u201cWe\u2019re staying here.\u201d Feng Xun pointed to the feng residence as aversion tinged the tone of his voice. \u201cEven though it\u2019s old and worn out and cramped, can\u2019t be helped that my little kitchen lady lives here. Good grief, it\u2019ll do, if just barely. We\u2019ll just stay here then.\u201dOnce Feng Yi Ran and Feng Liu heard that the crown prince\u2019s band of people are staying, they became excited at once, eyes wide and shining, their bodies trembling with excitement!But when Feng Wu heard these words, she immediately became stunned\u2026\u2026what? ! Staying here? ! Staying at the Feng residence? !\u201cNo no no, can\u2019t do that\u2014\u2014\u201d Feng Wu subconsciously cried out in alarm!If they\u2019re staying here, then when would she ever be able to refine the Nine Reversal Spirit Pill? The essence fluid from the Immortal Spirit Fruit was stolen from their hands, how would she dare to take, it, out, and, refine, it? !What kind of a joke was this!\u201cNo no no, it\u2019s just as Young Prince Feng has said, our Feng residence is too small, too worn out, too old, too unpresentable, how can it be used to entertain such honorable and noble guests as you are? Therefore\u2014\u2014\u201d Feng Wu shook her head with all her might.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
