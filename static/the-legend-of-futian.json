Over half of the strongest individuals from the wealthiest families and most prominent clans had attended this academy. Thus, citizens of Qingzhou took pride in being able to develop themselves there. If the opportunity presented itself for one to attend the academy, they would undoubtedly study with the utmost diligence.However, it seemed that not everyone felt this way. In a classroom in the academy, there was a young man fast asleep at his desk.Lecturing at the front of the room was a young woman, clothed in a long teal dress. She took notice of this. A wave of anger flashed across her face as she made her way towards the young man, who was in a deep slumber.Qin Yi was seventeen, and an official disciple of the academy, as well as a lecturer for outer sect disciples. She was blessed with a beautiful face and an alluring body. In the classroom, all eyes followed Qin Yi as she moved. Even when she was mad, every move she made was elegant.\"This guy again! I can't believe he fell asleep during Senior Sister Qin's lecture again.\" It seemed as if the rest of the class had not noticed their sleeping classmate u[ until that point. Many of them did not know what to say. It was obviously not their first time witnessing this.\"Senior Sister Qin is serious eye candy. I don't know how that guy could have fallen asleep,\" whispered a fellow classmate.Among all the lecturers, Qin Yi was without a doubt the most popular. The reason as to why was evident as soon as one laid eyes on her. She was considered a goddess by many. Her lectures were always made to a packed classroom. Falling asleep in Qin Yi's classroom was seemingly impossible.Qin Yi's steps were light. She arrived at the young man's side without making a sound. Standing in front of the desk as she eyed his face in deep slumber, her beautiful face frosted over.\"Ye Futian,\" a soft voice said. The voice was not Qin Yi's, however; it had come from behind Ye Futian.As if he had heard his name called, Ye Futian's body moved slightly. With his hands holding up his head, he slowly opened his eyes. Through his blurry vision he was able to make out two round peaks.\"So big,\" Ye Futian muttered unconsciously. His voice was very soft, and he had only murmured to himself, In a quiet environment like this, however, his unexpected comment was heard loud and clear by the entire class. In an instant, everyone froze, then immediately grew angry again.\"I can't believe it! How can he be so openly disrespectful to Senior Sister Qin?!\"\"This shameless bastard.\" Everyone's gaze was fixed on Ye Futian, piercing him as sharp swords would, which caused him to shiver. He could feel that something was wrong. He shifted his gaze upward and away from the glorious view in front of him. His eyes landed on a face as exquisite as jade, but also filled with anger.\"Uh...\" Ye Futian was dumbfounded. It was Qin Yi! Had it not been Qingxue calling him?Turning around, he saw the glaring eyes of a seemingly innocent 15-year-old girl.Ye Futian took a glance at the young girl and immediately cursed under his breath. He had been played; no wonder the cup size had been wrong.\"Senior Sister Qin, I...\" Ye Futian attempted to explain.\"Ye Futian,\" Qin Yi coldly interrupted him. She asked, \"What is the history behind the establishment of Qingzhou Academy?\"It was obvious Qin Yi wanted to avoid the awkwardness by changing the subject, but Ye Futian could clearly feel her anger radiating towards him. He could even feel the Will of Sword flowing through her body. It was as sharp as a knife, cutting into every inch of his body.\"Three hundred years ago, the Great East Phoenix united the Divine Prefectures of the East and commanded all dukes to establish martial arts academies in order to promote martial arts. This was the reason behind the establishment of Qingzhou Academy,\" Ye Futian answered. Of course, what he had said had come straight out of the history books. In the unofficial history books of his clan, another name was connected to this event. However, this tabooed name must not be brought up.\"What types of occupations are involved with development?\" Qin Yi continued her questioning.\"Development can be divided into martial arts and the art of divination,\" Ye Futian replied. \"Development in martial arts is associated with occupations such as warriors, knights, swordsmen, and so on. Development in the art of divination involves occupations such as mages, alchemists, armorers, and so on. Mages can also be divided into subcategories. Of course, there are also people who are naturally gifted and choose to work on both arts.\"\"It seems like you missed one type of occupation,\" Qin Yi stated solemnly.\"I couldn't have possibly missed anything,\" the young man said with a radiant look on his face. \"The Divine Prefecture acknowledges Mandate Sorcerers as the most powerful occupation of all, as they possess a gift from the Heavens. Most of those who possess rare gifts are Mandate Sorcerers; conjurers, beastmasters, and astrologers, for example. No matter which artform they decide to pursue, they are able to surpass all others.\"Everyone in the classroom was focused on Ye Futian's words. \"Being a Mandate Sorcerer is a legendary occupation. They operate on the will of the heavens and are blessed by the heavens as well. Not only that, but even the most ordinary Mandate Sorcerers possess an innate capability for both martial arts and divination arts.\"Qin Yi glanced at the young man in front of her, impressed. However, she was still angry. She said, \"I didn't expect you to know so much about this.\"\"Well of course,\" said Ye Futian as he looked at Qin Yi. \"I am a Mandate Sorcerer.\"Pfft! Not far away, a young man began choking on his water, and was now coughing up a storm. Many pairs of eyes looked at Ye Futian as if he were crazy.Everyone began to think that it was possible to be that shameless. Ye Futian was a legendary character at school, and his notoriety was well-deserved. Not only had he disrespected Senior Sister Qin in public, but he was now falsely claiming to be a Mandate Sorcerer. Could it be that he was doing this to attract the attention of Senior Sister Qin?Who did he think he was? In his three years developing at the academy, he had been stuck on the Collection Plane of the first level of development, Awakening. His body was weak. It was clear that he had yet to reach the Enhancement Plane. How could this loser claim to be a Mandate Sorcerer? How could he be so blatantly shameless?Qin Yi's chest puffed out again; it was truly a magnificent sight. She looked at Ye Futian angrily. \"Since you're a Mandate Sorcerer, you must have spirit in your Life Palace. Set the spirit of your Life Palace free and prove your words to be true.\"\"My Life Spirit is still in a deep slumber, it cannot be summoned. It is also the reason why I fell asleep in class,\" Ye Futian answered calmly.\"Ye Futian!\" Qin Yi called out abruptly. Her beautiful eyes pierced into those of the young man facing her. \"Three years ago, you arrived at the academy as a 12-year-old boy. Back then, I observed the entrance talent inspection as an outer sect disciple. Your ability to perceive Spiritual Qi was at the highest level, shocking the academy. Despite the care of many instructors, you have not made any improvements in surpassing the first level of Awakening for the past three years. Having spent your days lazing around, not paying attention during class, have you developed at all? And now you even dare to falsely claim to be a Mandate Sorcerer, going as far as using it as an excuse for sleeping in class.\"In these three years, whether it be the Spring Quarter Examinations or the Fall Quarter Examinations, you always drop out of testing, automatically making you last in ranking throughout the entire academy. Ye Futian, do you really not feel ashamed?\"Following Qin Yi's enraged outburst was a silent classroom. It was so quiet that you could hear a pin drop. Everyone watched Qin Yi as she fumed; it seemed to be the first time any of them had seen her like this.Ye Futian was frozen in shock as well. His dark, black eyes stared at the delicate face in front of him, which was now red with anger.Has it already been three years? he thought to himself. Unknowingly, three years had passed, but the commotion in his Life Palace was still the same, unchanging. He was also a bit surprised because Senior Sister Qin, a goddess to many, was usually an ice beauty. However, it appeared that she had been keeping tabs on him, and doing so since the entrance talent inspections at that.The room was filled with a dead silence. Qin Yi carefully looked over the young man before her eyes. He had a handsome face with sharp features, with eyes as clear and deep as the night sky. At the young age of fifteen, his only shortcoming was his thin frame. In a few years, he would definitely grow to become an attractive man.Qin Yi silently questioned herself: Was her tone too harsh? She noticed the slight sadness in Ye Futian's eyes. Her anger dissipated slightly.\"There is still one month before this year's Fall Quarter Examinations. If you fail or give up again, no one will be able to save you from being expelled. The academy is not going to let you stay, do you understand that?\" Qin Yi continued. The class watched. It seemed that the academy had reached its limits with this guy.Was he finally going to be expelled? If it did happen, it would be one for the history books. After all, it was not easy to get expelled from Qingzhou Academy.\"If he goes, I go.\" From the back of the room, someone spoke up rather indifferently. Many looked over to the young man, who was sitting in a corner. There were looks of envy, jealousy, worship, and worry as well.\"The academy has already decided that Yu Sheng doesn't have to participate in next year's Spring Quarter Examinations,\" Qin Yi said. \"He can choose to develop at the academy Battle House, with the society of knights, or in any of the divination schools. His future can't be tied to you. You will only hold him back.\" Qin Yi looked at Ye Futian and sighed. Yu Sheng and he were destined to head in two separate directions.\"Hold him back?\" The corners of Ye Futian's mouth curled into a soft smile, revealing a hint of cynicism.\"Shut up,\" Yu Sheng said from the back of the room. He stood up, his eyes shooting daggers at Qin Yi.\"Sit down,\" Ye Futian said lightly, not turning to look at Yu Sheng. Yu Sheng's gaze dulled as he looked at the silhouette in front of him. He then took his seat quietly, as if Ye Futian's words were absolute orders to him.\"I've decided...\", Ye Futian had a frivolous smile on his face. He continued as he looked at Qin Yi, \"I am officially participating in this year's Fall Quarter Examinations.\"In the back, Yu Sheng's eyes sparkled.After three years, was he finally going to take things seriously?Over his three years of development at Qingzhou Academy, everyone knew of Yu Sheng's exceptional talent. His ability to perceive the element of metal was of the highest level. He was also highly gifted in martial arts. He could continue developing in either of the arts. Even though he was an outer sect disciple, his Plane was higher than many lecturers at the academy.But even so, who could really understand Ye Futian?\"Your body is frail, plus you're still stuck in the first plane of Awakening, the Collection Plane. Even if you were to participate in the Fall Quarter Examinations, how do you expect to pass?\" Qin Yi eyed Ye Futian, inwardly releasing a deep sigh. Even if he were to start working hard now, it might already be too late.\"And what if I pass?\" It seemed that Ye Futian did not have a clear understanding of his own abilities. His voice was filled with confidence.\"If you pass, then you are free to do as you please in the classroom,\" replied Qin Yi.A peculiar light flashed in his eyes as he took in the captivating figure standing in front of him. His eyes unconsciously made their way to a place where he should not have been looking. He asked weakly, \"Is it really okay for me to do anything I want?\"This guy...what does he mean by that? many wondered as they stared at Ye Futian.\"You shameless *sshole, where do you think you're looking?\" The other students had finally realized what his eyes were trained on. Oh, how they all wanted to hit him. How could he still be saying such disrespectful things to Senior Sister Qin?Naturally, Qin Yi was aware of Ye Futian's gaze as well. The little pity she had for him died in an instant. Her beautiful eyes glared at Ye Futian with rage once again. She bit her lip and answered his question\"Whatever you want!\"Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 2": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Legend of FutianCH 2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayQin Yi stared at Ye Futian fiercely. Seeing the smile on his face, she was reminded of what had happened three years ago at the Academy Entry Talent Inspection. Ye Futian had only been 12-years-old at the time. In front of all the masters at the Academy, his smile still remained natural and proud, completely different from the nervousness of the other youngsters.The test had finally determined his talent to be of the highest level, which meant that his perception of Spirit and Qi was great. This made him a natural at martial arts.Now that three years had passed, his perception had not changed, unfortunately, nor had his plane. He had remained casual, lazy, and frequently absent from classes. However, his eyes were still bright and clear.\"What if you can't?\" Qin Yi asked.\"It's your call,\" Ye Futian said.\"Please, do not put Mr. Yu Sheng's future in jeopardy.\" Qin Yi looked up at the resolute boy sitting behind Ye Futian.Yu Sheng's metal-element perception was of the highest level. He was already in the eighth Awakened Plane, the Metamorph Plane, and was even stronger than Qin Yi, who was at the seventh Awakened Plane, the Mystery. His future should not be tampered with.\"Sure,\" Ye Futian promised. But was this possible?Qin Yi walked back to the podium. Her beautiful eyes looked around at all the students, then she said, \"There is only one month before the Fall Quarter Examination. Please use this time wisely. If you wait until next spring, another batch of new students will join and compete. Especially you, Ling Xiao. You are on the sixth Awakened Plane, the Invincible; and Feng Feng Qingxue, you have stayed on the fifth Awakened Plane, the Juggernaut, for too long. I want you guys to make progress on the Spring Quarter Examination next year.\"The first level of development was Awakening, which was then divided into nine planes: Collection, Enhancement, Venation, Adamance, Juggernaut, Invincible, Mystery, Metamorphosis, and Unmaker.To become an official student in Qingzhou Academy, one had to reach the seventh Awakened Plane, the Mystery, before the age of eighteen, and perform accordingly in the Spring Quarter Examination.\"I will, Ms. Qin,\" Ling Xiao nodded. Feng Qingxue made a fist, feeling more determined to reach his goal.\"You are dismissed,\" Qin Yi murmured. She then began to walk outside, her graceful figure followed by the eyes of the boys in the room. Finally, after the figure was gone, they all viciously looked at Ye Futian, the bastard who, in their eyes, had just been disrespectful toward their Goddess.\"Ye Futian, turn around,\" a cold voice said in Ye Futian's ears, attracting a lot of looks. It was Feng Qingxue, who was seated behind Ye Futian.Even at just fifteen-years-old, she was already a beauty, with delicate eyes and exquisite facial features. Her body was full of youthfulness, endowing her with a sense of purity and attractiveness. When she stood up, her legs appeared slim and graceful.\"How could you do this?\" Feng Qingxue stared at Ye Futian with anger.Ye Futian suddenly realized what had happened and laughed. \"You are jealous, aren't you?\"Feng Qingxue suddenly froze, speechless. A little while later, she continued, \"How will you explain this to your father?\"\"Explain what?\" Ye Futian blinked, then remembered his father having spoken about Feng Qingxue and how she would be a good mother because of her childbearing hips. He couldn't take his eyes off of her curves.\"Stop thinking of weird stuff. We are still young; it's not time to be talking about having kids yet.\"Ye Futian's words suddenly brought silence upon the class. The other boys felt nothing but anger. They believed this bastard was shameless. Just minutes ago he had been flirting with Ms. Qin Yi, and now he was talking dirty to Feng Qingxue, who was so gorgeous and young. What was wrong with this guy?Feng Qingxue completely froze. She suddenly remembered that Ye Futian's dad had made an inappropriate joke to her dad about her and Ye Futian having kids together. She blushed badly, thinking this shameless bastard was intentionally making fun of her.\"I meant if you were to be expelled from the Academy after the Fall Quarter Examination. How would you explain that to your dad?\" Feng Qingxue was breathing hard. Her chest heaved She was confused about what Ye Futian was even thinking about. Apparently she did not believe Ye Futian would pass the Fall Quarter Examination with only the first Awakened Plane.\"I will pass,\" Ye Futian said as he looked at her, shaking his head a bit.\"Come on, you have been stuck on the first Awakened Plane for three years, yet you are still confident? Seriously, Ye Futian, please spell the word 'shame' for me,\" another cold voice said from behind him. People looked back and saw that it\u00a0was Ling Xiao, the boy sitting behind Feng Qingxue.Ling Xiao had already reached the sixth Awakened Plane, the Invincible. He was such a talented wind-element mage that he was considered extraordinary in the 15-year-old class of Qingzhou Academy. He would hopefully become an official cultivator after passing the Spring Quarter Examination next year.While he was speaking, he did not look at Ye Futian for even a moment. His eyes were drawn to Feng Qingxue. He continued, \"Ye Futian, you are the worst in this class, yet you are talking nonsense to a talented girl like Feng Qingxue. You are obviously getting your confidence from nowhere. No wonder people say 'he who knows not, fears not.'\"Ling Xiao was actually speaking on behalf of the rest of the class, who were now looking at Ye Futian. They believed that he was definitely the most shameless in the class.Yu Sheng walked beside Ye Futian without any attention. His mere existence gave him an aura of power, which suddenly demanded the respect of the others' eyes.\"Brother Yu,\" Feng Qingxue mumbled.\"Hi,\" Yu Sheng casually nodded, his eyes locked onto Ling Xiao. He was giving him such a powerful look.\"'He who knows not, fears not?'\" Ye Futian did not seem agitated by Ling Xiao's words. In fact, he had heard so many insults over these last three years that it was no longer a big deal. It was common for people to insult others in an effort to make themselves look superior, especially when someone beautiful was present.\"You think you are the doctor, don't you?\" Ye Futian said.\"For development? That's not even a question, especially compared to you, loser.\" Ling Xiao was confident because Ye Futian had been stuck on the first Awakened Plane for so long, and he was always absent from class.\"Okay, then tell me how a warrior could beat a double-element fire/metal mage?\" Ye Futian suddenly asked.Ling Xiao hesitated for a second, then answered sarcastically, \"Are you kidding me? Even a single-element mage would easily defeat a warrior unless the mage were such an idiot that he let the warrior get into melee range. In a one-on-one battle this would be the only way, let alone a double-element mage.\"The spells of a mage could attack a warrior from a far distance, which could cause a clear advantage for the mage over the warrior in battle.\"You idiot. A warrior wins when he is on a higher level plane,\" Ye Futian said satirically. Ling Xiao looked gloomy. People looked at Ye Futian and wondered how shameless he really was to have asked such a question.\"You raised a question about battle between different classes without telling me they were on different planes. Is this question even meaningful at all?\" Ling Xiao fired back.\"Same plane, huh? What if the warrior had increased strength and enhanced agility?\" Ye Futian asked again. People suddenly realized that he was making some sense. A warrior that had increased strength would be good at blitzing. With enhanced agility, the warrior would be able to get in close range quickly.\"Come on, you are talking about a double-element fire/metal mage. He would have a fire shield spell and enhanced armor from metal-element spells. Even in close range combat, there is no chance the mage loses,\" Ling Xiao sneered.\"Then what if this warrior knew rampage cleavage? This is a specialized armor-breaking technique. With the power from Strength-concentration, metal-element armor would be nothing more than a piece of paper,\" Ye Futian continued, \"As for the attack from the mage, you know it is nothing.\"Ling Xiao became gloomier. In fact, a Strength-concentration warrior with enhanced agility would surely evade the attacks of a mage. Ye Futian was making a good point.\"This conversation is nothing but strategy on paper. Just stop it.\" Ling Xiao was reluctant to admit his loss in the debate.\"Right, how could a mage ever lose to a warrior?\" someone followed.\"You are just repeating what you know from books, pretending you know everything and that everyone else is ignorant. Okay, then answer this simple one: How do people differ in development over the first Awakened Plane, the Collection?\" Ye Futian kept asking.\"A cultivator feels the Spiritual Qi from the universe and collects them in this plane. A mage possesses better perception over the Qi of a certain element, thus more pure power is gained from the collection. Therefore, if we are talking about collection of a certain Qi element, there is a major difference. However, for general development, there would be little difference. For mage collection, each mage definitely differs in their respective Collection Plane because of their different elements,\" Ling Xiao answered slowly, confident that he was including every possibility.\"Idiot.\" Ye Futian glanced at Ling Xiao with scorn, then turned his back and walked away.\"What do you mean?\" Ling Xiao said, frowning at Ye Futian's back. \"Pretending to have the last word by walking away when you can't answer? You loser.\"\"Ye Futian is a douche,\" people murmured.Suddenly, a piercing glow burst out from Ye Futian's back. It was a cloud of Qi, spreading all around him like a brilliant rainbow. The students dropped their jaws in amazement, completely shocked.Ye Futian was trying to make a statement. Even people in the Collection Plane could be different; some could be superior, like he was.Ling Xiao seemed upset about this scene. The glow from Ye Futian was so brilliant that he could not believe he was only on the first Awakened Plane, the Collection. Could it be true?Yu Sheng followed Ye Futian and they left. After they had disappeared, the class was still blown away by what they had just seen.\"I gotta admit, this douche is unique in the Collection Plane.\"\"So what? He has been stuck on this plane for three years, of course there is going to be a difference. If we ever got trapped on the first plane we would be the sam.\"\"That's right. He has been stuck for three years already. How the hell does he have the nerve to be so arrogant?\"\"And how dare he talk dirty to Ms. Qin and Feng Qingxue like that? Damn this scumbag.\"\"Ling Xiao, take it easy. No matter how much he talks, you would beat him in an instant if he ever dared to challenge you,\" someone told Ling Xiao. Others mumbled in agreement.Ling Xiao hesitated for a while, then felt confident again. The others were right; a low level cultivator like Ye Futian was not going to confuse him.\"Feng Qingxue, that boy is a prodigy. I know you have known each other since you were very young, but still. Stay away from him,\" Murong Qing said. She was Feng Qingxue's friend, and was trying to persuade Feng Qingxue to stay away from Ye Futian. She had always looked down on Ye Futian, mostly because she believed Ye Futian was always showing off when he had no actual ability at all.\"He is out of line, isn't he?\" Feng Qingxue also seemed mad.Murong Qing noticed that Feng Qingxue seemed distracted. She began speaking seriously. \"Wake up, girl. You are going to be an official cultivator soon. It's time for you to seriously think about your future. Even being around him will ruin your reputation, but you don't seem to care about this at all. Can you imagine what people will think of you in the future? Is it even worth it for a guy like him?\"Feng Qingxue frowned. She was speechless. She had not thought that far ahead yet.\"Time to grow up. Stay away from him, forever,\" Murong Qing said.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Even an outer sect disciple would be able to have a personal residence on campus.Ye Futian returned to where the residences of the outer sect disciples were located. With Yu Sheng trailing quietly behind him, Ye Futian walked into his own residence.\"Yu Sheng, I want to give up,\" he said slowly as he stopped in his tracks.\"Even if the Mandate has yet to awaken, you're still incredibly gifted.\" Yu Sheng looked at the youth in front of him. When Ye Futian had identified himself as a Mandate Sorcerer, everyone had laughed at him, but only Yu Sheng knew that it was no laughing matter.Ye Futian was indeed a Mandate Sorcerer.\"I know that. It's just that I've worked so hard.\" Ye Futian smiled bitterly. \"It's been three years. If this goes on I really will get left behind by you. It looks like I'll have to work harder.\"\"Come on, let's go train.\" Ye Futian turned to look at the young man behind him. Yu Sheng was a head taller than him, with a frame larger than most. He naturally had a strong aura about him.The two walked into the designated development area inside the residence. Ye Futian sat down cross-legged, instantly closing his eyes. A bright airflow surrounded him. The Spiritual Qi in the small area he occupied was going crazy, and began rushing towards Ye Futian. Yu Sheng watched all of this from behind without a word. At that moment, Ye Futian was like a formidable vortex, engulfing all the Spiritual Qi. If the others were to witness this scene, they would be rendered speechless out of fear.The frightful flow of air drifted through his body, his inner mind its destination. This was the location of his Life Palace.Possessing a spirit in your Life Palace, also known as the Life Spirit, was an attribute of a Mandate Sorcerer.Currently, in Ye Futian's Life Palace, there was a large ancient tree thick with jade-green leaves. However, the land around the tree was barren. As the Spiritual Qi drifted into the Life Palace, the tree greedily absorbed it all. The crisp green leaves rustled, moving without the help of wind.An apparition appeared under the tree. It was Ye Futian. He looked at the magnificent tree in front of him and said quietly, \"Three years of absorbing Spiritual Qi, yet it hasn't made any difference. You only know how to take. If you're going to be like this, then I'm no longer going to transfer any of the Spiritual Qi I absorb to you.\"He had said everything that he needed to say. The apparition he had created with his consciousness disappeared. The Spiritual Qi that was flowing through his body was no longer headed in the direction of his Life Palace, but travelled to the rest of his body instead.A great wave of Spiritual Qi washed over his body. He was ready for the Enhancement Plane. Right at that moment, however, a strong force emerged, pulling all the Spiritual Qi backward. It began rushing straight back into the Life Palace.The sudden change caused Ye Futian to shudder. Boy, he was pissed. For the past three years he had sent every last bit of Spiritual Qi he had collected to the Life Palace, but saw no results. Now it was forcefully taking it away, keeping him from developing.Just the thought of this made Ye Futian want to fight. The forceful energy ignored his feelings, however, and continued its crazed absorption of all the Spiritual Qi. The force then began to absorb all the energy in Ye Futian's body. In only a few moments, Ye Futian's complexion began to turn pale.*sshole! Ye Futian cursed. Accompanying the raging rush of Spiritual Qi into the Life Palace, he felt a violent shaking in his head. It seemed as if there was a drastic change going on in the Palace. His consciousness attempted to interrupt it, but was destroyed by a wild force.Ah...! A deep growl escaped his lips. Yu Sheng stood up abruptly, witnessing the change in Ye Futian's body. Not only was his body changing, but all the Spiritual Qi he had previously collected from around him was rushing towards him as well. Even more, the flowers, grass, and trees in the surrounding area all began to wilt at an alarming rate. Yu Sheng's eyes lit up as he realized what was happening. He stepped closer to Ye Futian and took a seat right behind him. When he placed both of his hands on Ye Futian's body, he immediately felt an enormous force. It absorbed the Spiritual Qi Yu Sheng had in his own body, just as he thought it would.Was it finally awakening?......When Ye Futian woke up, all he knew was that his body felt extremely weak. The sunlight pierced his eyes as he opened them. A night had passed.\"What...happened?\" Ye Futian sat up and saw the withered plants. Seated beside him was a weakened Yu Sheng.Thinking of the events of the previous day, Ye Futian closed his eyes, his consciousness entering his Life Palace. Ye Futian jumped at the sight of his previously barren Life Palace. There was now a moon in the sky, shining down on the vast land, as well as mountains and streams. The ancient tree the Life Spirit had resided in stood as tall as ever, looking greener than ever before. It was full of Spiritual Qi.The World Tree. The apparition of Ye Futian, created by his consciousness, appeared under the ancient tree once more. Could it be that his old man had lied?His father had once told him that his ancestors were Mandate Sorcerers who had gone against Heaven's will. The World Tree could take the spirit from anything on Earth. However, it had failed to be passed on, and Ye Futian was the only one who had inherited their ancestors' innate abilities.Could it be that Freedom Meditation is real? Ye Futian thought of the Freedom Meditation mantras he had repeated over and over as a child. He was excited, With his eyes closed, the mantras flowed from his mouth. He quickly became focused, controlling all his thoughts. It was as if he was galloping between Heaven and Earth.Just as quickly, a dense force of Spiritual Qi appeared in his meditative mind. Within that dense force, he was able to see different colored Spiritual Qi. Those were the purest kinds of elemental Spiritual Qi. Each color represented a different type of element.Flames. Ye Futian's thoughts locked onto the blazing red Spiritual Qi. It was the fire-element Spiritual Qi. The World Tree Life Spirit took on the blazing red color; it was truly a dazzling sight. Suddenly, outside the Life Palace, the fire-element Spiritual Qi flowed feverishly into Ye Futian's body. It wandered into every organ, giving him a strong burning sensation.Wood-element. Ye Futian shifted his focus to the green Spiritual Qi using the Freedom Meditation. His body flooded with wood-element Spiritual Qi, instantly replenishing the energy that had been taken from him.Metal, Earth, Wind, Water... Ye Futian played around with this for quite a while. Finally, he stopped, opened his eyes, and stared blankly into the space in front of him.\"Is this...real?\" Ye Futian looked down at his hands in disbelief.\"Of course it's real! You're a Full-Attribute Sorcerer.\" Sitting behind him, Yu Sheng had clenched his fists in excitement, to the point that the veins in his arms were clearly visible. He stared straight ahead at Ye Futian. \"Plus, you're a Full-Attribute Mandate Sorcerer, who is able to develop in both martial and divination arts.\"\"Then, isn't my gift...\" Ye Futian's eyes shimmered.\"Against the will of Heaven,\" Yu Sheng finished. \"There's no one else like you in the city of Qingzhou.\"His face cracked into a big smile. So many of the elders in his family had been unable to inherit their ancestors' great gift, yet he had. Was this the Mandate of Heaven? A Mandate Sorcerer, operating on the will of the Mandate?\"Let's go.\" Ye Futian stood up suddenly, heading outside the residence.\"Where to?\" questioned Yu Sheng.\"To the back of the mountains,\" replied Ye Futian. The mountains he was referring to were the Mount Tianyao mountains behind Qingzhou Academy.\"Demons scour the back mountains. Why do you want to go there?\" Yu Sheng asked.\"We'll just go near the border. Besides, what do I have to be afraid of with you next to me?\" He was out the door before he finished his sentence. Yu Sheng did not have much to say, so he followed after him.Mount Tianyao was an extensive chain of mountains. The terrain was steep, and demons walked the land. Not many people knew exactly how deep the mountains were. It was said that the reason for building Qingzhou Academy in front of the mountains was to prevent the demons from coming out and causing harm to the citizens. At the same time, it also provided a place for the academy's disciples to train.At noon, the two youths climbed up Mount Tianyao and stood on a boulder that was resting on top of a cliff at the border of the mountain range. Looking down at the massive academy grounds, Ye Futian exhaled.It had been three years. Knowing his identity as a Mandate Sorcerer, how could he have possibly been satisfied developing in only martial arts? There had been no change in his Life Spirit, creating a hint of disappointment under his proud exterior. It had finally come to an end; he was going to keep reaching for his dream of becoming a powerful Mandate Sorcerer.The scorching sun beamed on Ye Futian as he looked up at its rays. His squinted eyes gave off a powerful sense of confidence. The Freedom Meditation's key points were observation and thought. Right now, he was observing and thinking about the sun.As Ye Futian observed and thought about the scorching sun, he stood atop the large boulder. The rays of the sun turned into flames and permeated his surroundings. They then pierced Ye Futian's body. The forceful blaze of fire flowed around him, reaching every internal organ and each of his limbs, filling his entire body.Yu Sheng watched as Ye Futian turned into a man on fire in front of his very eyes. Those same firm eyes showed happiness. The sleeping dragon had finally awakened.Crackling sounded as Ye Futian's skin burned red from the blazing flames. Under the incineration of the sun's flames, his body continued changing.After a long while, Ye Futian's skin glistened like crystals, but also bright, like a fire. Within his body, fiery dragons rushed into every vessel, causing a loud rumble. There was a lot of activity, and many loud, frantic noises. Luckily, there was no one else at the top of the mountains, so Yu Sheng was the only one that heard them.It was shocking that entering the Enhancement and Venation Planes could cause such a ruckus.In the blink of an eye, it was already dusk. The sun was setting, and Ye Futian's entire body was engulfed in flames. It felt like a storm was raging inside his body. His bones were crackling continuously. He finally stopped when the sun disappeared below the horizon. Slowly, he opened his eyes. Unexpectedly, a beam of fire shot out from his pupils.\"You broke through three planes in a day,\" Yu Sheng stated in shock. After having been suppressed for three years, he had broken out in one day. Borrowing the power of the sun for the calcination of his body, he had powered through both the Enhancement and Venation Planes in one go. He was now in the fourth plane of Awakening, the Adament Plane. He now possessed an impenetrable iron body.\"This is too cool,\" Ye Futian muttered. It would have taken at least a few months for an ordinary person to achieve an iron body. To become a Mandate Sorcerer, he had used Freedom Meditation to observe and think about the flames of the sun, and with some help from his Life Spirit, he had been able to achieve it in half a day.At that moment, he felt completely energized. He stood up and walked over to an ancient tree at the top of the mountain. With a quick wave of his fist and a loud snap, the large tree that had once stood in front of him split into pieces. The area where his fist had landed on the tree trunk was now burned black.\"Even those in the Juggernaut Plane wouldn't be able to handle a punch from you,\" Yu Sheng gasped, seeing the result of Ye Futian's work. Those in the Juggernaut Plane had immense strength, but the force of that one punch from Ye Futian definitely surpassed the strength one would normally possess in the Juggernaut Plane.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 4": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Legend of FutianCH 4Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayYe Futian was shocked by the power of his punch. Delighted by what he had just accomplished, something suddenly slipped into his mind. He closed his eyes, and his consciousness went into the Life Palace.The apparition of Ye Futian appeared under the World Tree. His eyes filled with excitement. At that moment, the jade green tree was faintly covered in flames, looking radiant with fire-element Qi. What shocked Ye Futian even more was the bright, sun-shaped matter that hung in the sky. It exuded a breathtaking flame, though it was far from the dazzling effect of the real sun.The mind of an actual cultivator always had some kind of artifact in their Life Palace. For some, it would be a mountain or river. For Ye Futian, it was a bright sun.This power felt so strong that it almost absorbed the essence of the universe. Ye Futian was shocked as he stared at the sun in his Life Palace. Suddenly, he felt as if he were the sun himself. The Spiritual Qi of the entire universe had flowed inside him, then into his constellation and the World Tree.The World Tree now had flames, and the sun above had grown even brighter.Oh my, this scorching feeling. Ye Futian felt like he was in the middle of the sun; his joints, muscles, and bones were continually being forged by the flame of the sun.My spirit lies in my Life Palace\u2026 Ye Futian mumbled to himself. Suddenly, he remembered something\u2014something that could possibly be happening. He began to focus, and soon after the glow of the sun had burst out of his head and shone all over the place. It gave his face a sense of holiness.\"Your spirit in your Life Palace\u2014is it a sun?\" Yu Sheng asked, standing beside him.Ye Futian suddenly opened his eyes. The glow was now gone. He looked at Yu Sheng, slightly confused, then mumbled, \"I seem to be able to make spirit in the palace\u2026\"He realized the sun in his Life Palace was obviously the spirit. It had boosted his cultivation, and even showed increased improvement on his body.Yu Sheng was thrilled; his eyes opened wide. He stared at Ye Futian and asked sincerely, \"Then please, create one for me?\"Ye Futian was speechless. Yu Sheng was so out of line. How could he even think to ask Ye Futian to make him a spirit in his palace after having been thrilled like this?\"Keep an eye on your imagination, buddy,\" Ye Futian nodded, turning away.Yu Sheng was confused again. \"Where to?\"\"Time for cultivation. We have to observe some animals.\" Ye Futian laughed, seemingly in good spirits. The sun was pushing him through planes so fast that it would be entirely possible to reach the Juggernaut Plane from the Adamant Plane. Though it would require the extreme coordination of strength and spirit, once he arrived at Juggernaut, he would be able to integrate his mind, strength, and spirit. Every technique and move would evolve into a new level of power in the Juggernaut Plane for him.\u00a0He had to put in the effort.Mount Tianyao was surrounded by herds of demons, even on its perimeter. Soon after they marched into the mountain area, Ye Futian and Yu Sheng were met with a level four Swift Demon Panther.\"Yu Sheng, go wait to intercept her; I will chase after her.\" Ye Futian commanded Yu Sheng. Hearing the order, Yu Sheng flew like an arrow, with a momentum that somehow shook the earth. The Panther sensed the threat, and suddenly tried to run away like a bolt of lightning.\"Soul generates mind, mind guides strength; creator of the universe, break your limit and unleash all your power...\"Ye Futian mumbled out the spells of unleashed cultivation power. As he ran, the Panther created a shadow figure, sprinting in his mind. It seemed that almost every single one of Panther's moves were being repeated and slowed down in his mind.Gradually, his body had unconsciously copied the gestures of the Panther. When he lept into the air, his right leg curled a bit to burst harder into the next step. It was almost as if he were the Panther himself. Though he ran fast, he was still not proficient enough for the Panther's moves, so the Panther was almost able to get away from him. Fortunately, Yu Sheng managed to cut off its escape.It's not just strength; it's the power of the wind. Ye Futian could perceive the wind-element power surrounding the Panther. He began to feel that his body had also absorbed energy from the wind; his clothes rustled, and his movements became even more fluent. Half an hour later, he merged with the wind, just as the Panther had.\"Yu Sheng, leave her alone. I'm done.\" Ye Futian stopped running, and Yu Sheng let go of the Panther.\"You are such a great imitator,\" Yu Sheng complimented. He had watched Ye Futian gain the essence of the Panther's moves in only half an hour.\"I have a sense of wind-element power. As long as I practice my techniques as the Panther has, I will have her speed. It's still not enough though. It looks like you have more work to do for me these days,\" Ye Futian laughed. Yu Sheng did not say anything, but followed him in silence.The following few days, Ye Futian developed in Mount Tianyao. He observed and imitated the movement patterns of monkeys, tigers, lions, and even birds. He progressed every single day.On the tenth day, he made it to the fifth plane of awakening, the Juggernaut. That day, Ye Futian and Yu Sheng walked deep inside the forest. The earth began to shake lightly, as did the trees around them. A terrible voice came roaring in their ears.They looked at each other to make a decision, then walked towards the source of the voice. The shaking became even worse. Finally, they saw a giant, furious monster, which was over five meters tall.\"Wow, that is a level nine demon; Ape the Furious.\" Yu Sheng's eyes looked sharp. The giant demon was a real threat to him. What was surprising, however, was seeing a graceful beauty standing right in front of the Ape.The girl was dressed in all white. Her hair danced along with the wind, as did her skirt. Her facial features were so perfect that she would definitely be considered a \"Helen of Troy\" when she grew older.\"It's Hua Jieyu. I know her.\" This girl was a legend at Qingzhou Academy. Ye Futian marveled at her beauty.\"Should we help?\" Yu Sheng asked.\"Wait, the Ape is injured.\" Ye Futian noticed that the Ape had wounds all over, while the girl looked safe.\"Hua.\" The Ape suddenly stepped towards the girl with a loud roar. Because of the size difference, it seemed clear that the girl could not withstand one attack. However, Hua Jieyu swiftly flew towards a tree to evade the attack.The Ape knocked down the tree, then picked it up as a weapon to swing at Hua Jieyu. The strength of the throw was terrifying.The girl remained calm. She bounced all over the air. She also used leaves as her weapon. The leaves charged towards the Ape as if they were blades, and each one made a sound as they flew through the air.The Ape tried to block the leaf blades with the tree in hand. The leaves were everywhere, and after a while, the tree had almost been cut into pieces.Gravel and boulders flew all around. Hua Jieyu fell behind another tree and closed her eyes. Suddenly, all the flying rubble charged towards the Ape. Each piece of debris was like a small blade; together, they were eroding the defense of the Ape by cutting into his skin bit by bit. Even more horrifying was the extreme razor-like lance of rubble that had been formed by Hua Jieyu's Qi, and was pointed right at the Ape.Such a powerful spell. Ye Futian was completely shocked. A moment later, he witnessed the lance pierce right through the eye of the Ape. The giant monster growled in extreme pain and began to run away. He knocked down every tree on his way.The girl did not chase after the Ape. She slowly descended to the ground, as if she were a Goddess gracing the planet with her presence.\"Enjoyed the show, didn't you?\" Hua Jieyu smiled softly. Ye Futian and Yu Sheng walked out of their hiding spots and looked at the girl, who was their age, in shock.\"You are a multiple-element mage? Are you serious?\" Ye Futian asked.\"I know you.\" Hua Jieyu didn't answer Ye Futian's question, instead choosing to look at him.\"Sounds like I am famous.\" Ye Futian also smiled. He seemed genuinely honored to be known by the legendary beauty of the academy.\"It was three years ago at the Entry Test of the academy. I overheard what you said when we first met.\"\"Huh\u2026.\" Ye Futian sensed the awkwardness in the air, but he soon calmed down and asked, \"What did I say?\"Hua Jieyu gave him a sweet smile that nearly took his soul away.\"You asked if I was a fairy.\" She kept smiling, then turned back into the forest.Of course. Ye Futian was paralyzed for a second, then nodded at the figure as she left.\"Looks like you remember it.\" Yu Sheng also watched her as she left.Ye Futian thought back to three years ago. When he had first met the then 12-year-old Hua Jieyu, he had told Yu Sheng, \"She's too beautiful to be a human. In a few years she's going to be a fairy, and dangerous for men.\"\"People say that she has reached the ninth plane of awakening already, and that she majored in both strength and spells. I cannot imagine how awesome the spells she used were; most people in the ninth plane of awakening cannot do the same things she did. Rumor also has it that she is a Mandate Sorcerer. Some great master in the academy already made her their private disciple. Guys are going after her, but none of them could even remotely match her beauty and talent,\" Yu Sheng mumbled.\"She's caught your heart. Am I right?\" Futian mocked him.Yu Sheng shook his head, then said in a serious tone, \"I think she's here for you.\"\"Come on,\" Ye Futian said as he patted the top of Yu Sheng's head, \"Just stop thinking, then.\"He turned back and suddenly smiled like a child. \"To be honest, though, I do want to marry her. She's definitely qualified to be a wife candidate,\" Ye Futian chuckled.Yu Sheng stumbled upon hearing this. He stared at Ye Futian from behind. Just a candidate? What a rude joke.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 5": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Legend of FutianCH 5Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIn the blink of an eye, over twenty days had passed. Two silhouettes were seen leaving the back mountains, returning to Qingzhou Academy.There had been a significant amount of change to Ye Futian's body. His eyes had never been filled with such energy, and his physique was better than ever. As he walked on the academy's cobblestone road, it all felt like a dream, as if he had been gone for a long time.\"This rascal is finally back after hiding for so long.\"\"He probably couldn't hide any longer; the Fall Quarter Examinations are only eight days away.\"People in the academy whispered amongst themselves upon seeing Ye Futian. The events of Qin Yi's lecture twenty some days ago had already spread. This \"infamous character,\" who hadn't broken through a single plane in three years, disrespected their goddess, Senior Sister Qin. Then he turned around to flirt with Feng Qingxue. Ye Futian was now the talk of the academy.\"Seems like people are looking for trouble.\" Ye Futian's hearing had sharpened quite a bit; he could now hear even the lowest of whispers.\"How do you feel about that?\" Yu Sheng eyed him with pity. Qin Yi and Feng Qingxue were both extreme beauties. The two were very popular in Qingzhou Academy and had countless suitors, especially Qin Yi. At the ripe age of seventeen, she had the looks and the body to captivate any man. So, when this guy flirted with both ladies in a day, he irritated many people.\"It's nothing. I know you have my back,\" shrugged Ye Futian.\"Shouldn't you be able to handle it by yourself now?\" Yu Sheng asked confusedly. Ye Futian was already on the brink of breaking through the Juggernaut Plane; his power might have been able to surpass someone on the sixth Awakening Plane, the Invincible.\"I have to keep a low profile.\" Ye Futian walked away arrogantly, with his hands behind his back. Yu Sheng looked at the hateful figure ahead, completely speechless. Was this the same person who had announced his identity as a Mandate Sorcerer to the world, despite being stuck on the first plane? Now that he really was a Mandate Sorcerer, he wanted to keep a low profile? How could he be any more contradictory?Not long after, the two returned to the dorm where they resided together. As expected, there were many other people making their way over there as well. What's more, it was not just one group of people, but two. The two groups met along the way and exchanged wary looks, ready for a fight. Putting their differences aside for the time being, the two crowds became one as they walked towards Ye Futian's residence.\"It's people from the Society of Knights of the School of Martial Arts and people from the School of Divination Arts,\" said a bystander. Many people were headed in Ye Futian and Yu Sheng's direction. These individuals were all official disciples of Qingzhou Academy. It did not seem like they were there out of jealousy from what had happened with the two girls, things were not that simple.The School of Martial Arts within Qingzhou Academy consisted of the Battle House, the House of Swordsmen, and the Society of Knights. The School of Divination Arts was made up of the seven Great Elemental Pavilions. One of the two groups was dressed in silver. These people were from the Society of Knights, where the strongest knights were groomed.On the other hand, the second group of visitors was donned in gold. The two metallic colors reflected off one another. This group was from the Metal Pavilion.\"Senior Brother Mo Lanshan, a three-star Glory Knight, and Senior Brother Han Ye, a Metal Element two-star Glory Sorcerer. I can't believe they're here at the same time,\" someone recognized the leaders of the two groups, their intentions were now clear to everyone.Wow, what an honor!If both schools were there, then it couldn't possibly be for Ye Futian.Inside the dorm, Ye Futian stood off to the side and looked at Yu Sheng, who was standing in front of the two parties. He smiled lightly. Yu Sheng had always stood behind Ye Futian, but even then, he still shone brightly. His future would only be brighter, Ye Futian believed in him, just as Yu Sheng had for him.Senior Sister Qin had previously mentioned that Yu Sheng would be exempt from next year's Spring Quarter Examinations and that he would be free to choose whether to join the School of Martial Arts or the School of Divination Arts. Back then, Ye Futian thought that there might be a possibility the higher ups would take action first and recruit him instead of waiting for him to pick. Just as predicted, they were here now.\"You should step outside,\" Mo Lanshan said. Naturally, Ye Futian understood this was directed at him, so he smiled and stepped outside, not minding too much.Outside the dorm, a rather large crowd had gathered. Of the thousands of outer sect disciples attending Qingzhou Academy, only a handful were personally recruited as official disciples each year. For this reason, many people would be jealous.\"Yu Sheng is about to be an official disciple while he's about to be expelled, what a joke.\" The people noticed that Ye Futian was alone and so, they felt no need to lower their voices. There were many others in the academy that did not like him anyway.\"He only made it this far because of Yu Sheng, without him, Ye Futian would've been kicked out of the academy ages ago.\"\"I'm really looking forward to seeing his performance during the Fall Quarter Examinations.\" Everyone around laughed at Ye Futian.\"Instead of worrying about me, why don't you worry about yourselves. If you mess up during the exam, it'll be really embarrassing,\" Ye Futian replied as he leaned on the wall nonchalantly.\"How arrogant.\"\"Fits his reputation.\" Everyone stared and discussed Ye Futian. Even though Yu Sheng always followed Ye Futian, he was going to become an official first. Shouldn't Ye Futian be ashamed?Ye Futian closed his eyes and tried to block out the noise. Not long after, the Society of Knights exited the dorm. As they walked past Ye Futian, their leader halted.\"I heard that Yu Sheng's father works as a manager for your family clan,\" Mo Lanshan said, without a single glance at Ye Futian.\"Yeah.\" Ye Futian nodded.\"People are indeed often blinded by others' family backgrounds; but, as they grow older, they'll come to understand that people from different worlds should not collide. The more arrogant you are now, the more petty you will be later in life. The people you once knew will soar so high above your head that you won't even be close enough to reach out and touch them,\" Mo Lanshan said coldly and walked away.From the very beginning, Mo Lanshan never spared a glance at Ye Futian, he was worthless in his eyes.Ye Futian was confused, his eyes followed Mo Lanshan as he departed. Ye Futian was sure Yu Sheng would not have made a choice without asking for his opinion first, and Mo Lanshan knew that. So, why did Mo Lanshan say all those things to mock him? Were they not complete strangers?The group from the School of Divination Arts also started to leave. Han Ye glanced at Mo Lanshan's figure ahead of him, his eyes then landed on Ye Futian. \"You've got some guts, flirting with a senior sister like that.\"\"Uh...\" Ye Futian was speechless. Had the gossip reached the official disciples?\"Mo Lanshan is from the Society of Knights of the School of Martial Arts, and even though Qin Yi is from the House of Swordsmen, they're still from the same school.\" Han Ye left this for Ye Futian to think about as he walked away. Ye Futian thought about that for a while and his eyes lit up. He finally understood Mo Lanshan's cold attitude towards him.Yu Sheng looked as if he had something to say when he saw Ye Futian re-enter the dorm.\"Don't waste your time thinking about this. How can they ask you to just decide like this? Isn't this a mockery of your abilities? Don't choose either school; if nothing happens, they'll be able to see what a genius you are at the Fall Quarter Examinations.\" Yu Sheng was dumbstruck by what Ye Futian said. It didn't seem like Ye Futian wanted to discuss this situation, so even though Yu Sheng already had his thoughts on the topic, he simply nodded.Yu Sheng trusted Ye Futian more than he trusted himself.......It was seven days before the Fall Quarter Examinations. Early in that morning, a bell rang all across the Qingzhou Academy campus.People left the dorms and all headed in the same direction.Around this time every year, the academy would gather all the outer sect disciples and make announcements regarding the Fall Quarter Examinations. It was also a time for pre-examination inspections.The outer sect disciple gymnasium was enormous, able to accommodate tens of thousands of people with ease. Even though the outer sect disciples filed in continuously, the gymnasium remained unfilled.The outer sect lecturers had arrived early on. Qin Yi was wearing something tight-fitting that showed off her curvaceous figure and attracted the attention of all those around her.\"He's here.\" The news had come from a small group in the crowd. They were all making a fuss while looking in the same direction. From that direction, came two people.\"I heard that senior brothers from both schools went to recruit Yu Sheng yesterday. That sort of treatment isn't for just anyone. How dare that loser walk in front of Yu Sheng like that?\" Everyone watched the school's \"infamous character\", and they were not too happy with him. Yu Sheng was going to be someone important in the future, but what was Ye Futian going to amount to? Probably nothing.None of this bothered Ye Futian though. Others could not possibly understand his relationship with Yu Sheng.\"Senior Sister Qin,\" Ye Futian greeted her with twinkling eyes. With a face and a body like that, it was no wonder that a Glory Knight like Mo Lanshan wasted his time getting mad at a nobody like him.Qin Yi's face fell when she saw Ye Futian. \"Where have you been these past days?\"\"I went cultivating, of course!\" he replied. \"Since I made a promise to you, I should give it my all.\"It did not seem like he was lying, so her expression warmed up a bit. As long as it was possible to encourage him to develop, and he did not do too badly during the Fall Quarter Examinations, maybe it would be possible to persuade the academy to give him some time.\"Have you progressed into the Enhancement Plane?\" Qin Yi asked.\"Senior Sister, I've already stepped into the Juggernaut Plane,\" he said with a serious look on his face.After she heard his words, her face fell once again and she glared at Ye Futian. She couldn't believe that she actually trusted him, and that she was even considering putting in a good word for him.\"Haha...!\" Everyone around began to laugh. Ling Xiao walked close to the two and questioned Qin Yi while staring at Ye Futian, \"Senior Sister Qin, what should we do about this guy?\"\"You're running out of time, Ye Futian! If you want to stay in the academy, you have to pick up the pace and try harder to reach the Enhancement Plane.\" Qin Yi was a bit disappointed. Thinking back on the entrance talent inspections three years ago, it seemed like such a waste.Ye Futian seemed to understand how she felt, his face broke out into a warm smile. Even though she didn't seem to believe him, he knew she truly cared about his well-being.\"Don't worry, Senior Sister. I won't let you down.\" His smile was a display of his pride, the morning sun shone off his handsome face.Qin Yi's heart warmed at his words, but just as she began to feel this way, Ye Futian said, \"Don't forget what you promised, Senior Sister.\"\"You...!\" She stomped her feet and turned to walk away. She was only a young seventeen-year-old, she did not know how to deal with this type of thing.Many people were dumbfounded. They glared at Ye Futian furiously, but also with a bit of jealousy. Even though it was quite shameless of him, they were jealous that he could joke with Qin Yi without worry.\"Why waste your time on a person like him?\" A male lecturer stepped beside Qin Yi and asked.She spared him a glance and said, \"He is actually quite gifted. I still don't understand why he couldn't manage to break through the Collection Plane over the span of three years. Maybe a miracle will really happen at this year's Fall Quarter Examinations.\"\"I really don't understand why you have such high hopes for him.\" The fellow lecturer beside her shook his head and looked at Ye Futian with disdain.At that moment, Ye Futian wondered and questioned Yu Sheng, who was standing beside him, \"How come no one believes me when I tell the truth?\"Yu Sheng had no answer for him. Who would believe that anyone could make it from the Collection Plane to the Juggernaut Plane in less than a month?\"We'll become official disciples in the Spring of next year. Should we give Feng Qingxue a hand as well?\" Ye Futian asked.Yu Sheng took a quick look at Feng Qingxue and nodded. If she was able to develop with Ye Futian, then she could definitely make it to the Mystery Plane by the Spring Quarter Examinations.Ye Futian located Feng Qingxue and began to make his way over. The crowd made way for him unwillingly. Of course, this was because he had Yu Sheng behind him.Before he could get close enough to her, someone stepped out in front and blocked his way. It was Feng Qingxue's best friend, Murong Qing.\"What do you want?\" Murong Qing asked emotionlessly.\"I want to speak with Feng Qingxue.\" Ye Futian gave out a smile.\"I know. You can say what you need to from here,\" she said.Ye Futian lifted his head, ignoring Murong Qing, as he looked towards Feng Qingxue and said, \"I have to talk to you.\"\"It'll be the same if you said it from over there.\" Feng Qingxue was avoiding his eyes.\"Feng Qingxue, what do you mean by all of this?\" Ye Futian was confused by this situation.\"You don't understand? It means that Qingxue doesn't want to be near you. So, mind yourself,\" Murong Qing answered.Ye Futian's gaze sharpened and he turned serious. However, Feng Qingxue continued to avoid meeting his eyes.\"Forget it.\" His eyebrows unfurled and he spoke softly.\"Ye Futian wanted to ask you to train together from now on,\" Yu Sheng spoke out abruptly from his spot off to the side, his gaze sharp as always.Ye Futian was shocked as he turned towards Yu Sheng. He was never a man of many words, but the Yu Sheng that Ye Futian was looking at now looked extremely mad.At this point, Feng Qingxue lifted her head and noticed the look in Yu Sheng's eyes. She then greeted him timidly. \"Yu Sheng.\"Their interactions attracted the attention of others. Ye Futian wanted to invite Feng Qingxue to train together? That's rich. Was he dreaming? However, it was Yu Sheng who brought this up, so no one dared to interfere.\"I know that Feng Qingxue really looks up to you, but do you really think that Ye Futian is worthy enough to have her train with him?\" Murong Qing asked Yu Sheng.Yu Sheng paid her no attention, his eyes were still focused on Feng Qingxue. \"I want to know what think.\"Feng Qingxue clenched her small fists. She was shaking. She looked at Yu Sheng, then at Ye Futian. Shaking her head, she replied, \"Yu Sheng, we're all grown up now, I think it would be best for us to keep our distance.\"After saying this, she let go of the breath she had been holding in. A rock had finally been lifted off her shoulders, and she was feeling much more relaxed now. However, she knew that she had just lost something.Ye Futian finally got the answer he had been waiting for, although it was not the answer he had hoped to hear. He smiled bitterly and shook his head. She really had grown up.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 6": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Legend of FutianCH 6Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayFeng Qingxue's answer met the expectations of her peers. They believed Ye Futian was too bold asking Feng Qingxue to cultivate together, which seemed like poorly disguised flirting. How rude was that?Even though people knew they had some history together\u2014mostly friendship over the years since they were young\u2014it still meant nothing, especially when it came to boundaries. When Feng Qingxue had said they were both adults, she had apparently been making her point.\"Rejected, huh.\" People mocked Ye Futian seeing him in this position.In fact, Ye Futian had been so bold that he had left himself no leeway. Seeing their expressions, Ye Futian soon realized what the others were thinking of him. What a cheap novel show he was creating. He shook his head and left.I am such a fool for asking her in public. It was my fault, pushing her into a place where she had no choice, Ye Futian sighed.\"Can't you tell that she was obviously making a point when she let Murong Qing stand between you? Come on, man, you've known each other for so long. She told you to keep your distance; what does that mean? Cutting off all ties?\" Yu Sheng seemed angered by Feng Qingxue's attitude. He looked like a ferocious lion.\"It's okay. She is only fifteen; she is still young, and easily persuaded by others.\" Ye Futian did not seem ashamed by what had just happened. In fact, he was still trying to stand up for Feng Qingxue.\"Don't forget what she just said,\" Yu Sheng said with authority, \"She was throwing those words right in your face. Why can't you understand your friendship with her is O-V-E-R.\u00a0She made her choice.\" Yu Sheng knew Ye Futian better than anyone else. He looked cynical, but deep inside he was warm and understanding, especially towards people he knew well. He knew that Ye Futian was trying to forgive Feng Qingxue and give her another chance.However, Yu Sheng was not going to just let it go. He felt that he must protect Ye Futian's pride and self-esteem for him. He knew what Feng Qingxue had just missed out on.He never forgot what his father had told Ye Futian; people saw things the clearest when they were down in their lives. It was not a big deal, because one day, when you became a king, the world would kneel before you.\u2026A noise in the crowd came from the battle arena, drawing the attention of the students. Ye Futian and Yu Sheng looked back and saw several people flying over the arena. They had wings that held them suspended in midair.\"They are seniors from the College of Sorcery; wind-element mages, who can actually condense air to create wings with wind-element spells and fly with them.\"The crowd watched in admiration, as they were still in the Awakening Planes, trying their best to break out of their physical constraints and combine their spirits and bodies in perfection. These mages were in the Glory Plane, which meant they were proficient in all kinds of spells.In the Divine Prefectures, mages outranked ordinary cultivators. Only the wind-element mages were able to fly in the Glory Plane.\"We are here to inform you that a certain area of Mount Tianyao has been cleared,\" a flying mage said, \"In this area, there will only be demons and monsters within the Awakening Plane levels. The following seven days will be the hunting season before the Fall Quarter Examination. You may hunt in this area to test your own gains from the past year, as well as hone your techniques in real combat and imminent danger.\"Another flying mage began speaking, \"You'll leave this place sooner or later. Without being seriously tested by real situations, you will never become a true cultivator. However, safety must be your priority. We suggest you partner up with other people to look out for each other.\"People nodded to show that they understood what was happening. Every hunting season before the Fall Quarter Examination, the academy would clear the area to make sure that it was safer than usual. However, some daredevils would still go into Mount Tianyao, even when it had not been cleared.\"During the Fall Quarter Examination, the academy will hold a homecoming event. People from the City of Qingzhou will come to watch, possibly even your parents. Make sure you perform well during the event, and do not let them down.\" The mage continued giving information most students already knew. The Fall and Spring Quarter Examinations were remarkable events for both the Qingzhou Academy and the city as a whole.The Fall Quarter Examination was bigger than the Spring Quarter Examination because the latter was for the selection of official students, and focused only on a few people.\"Okay, now go and prepare yourselves.\" The mage waved goodbye, then the group flew towards Mount Tianyao.The arena buzzed with excitement. People gathered around for the Fall hunt. This was an opportunity no one should miss.\"Ye Futian, what's your plan?\" Qin Yi asked Ye Futian from a distance.\"What do you mean by 'plan,' Ms. Qin?\" Ye Futian looked at her.\"It's a great opportunity, especially for you. You could go with Yu Sheng. It will be safe. Also, you may reach a new plane during the hunt,\" Qin Yi said.\"Nah, not this time,\" Ye Futian shook his head. After all, he had just come back from the mountain. He figured he should save himself the trouble.Qin Yi stared at him and said, \"You are still young. Relationships are not everything. Do not give up on yourself after being turned down once.\"Qin Yi was worried about Ye Futian feeling defeated after the apparent rejection he had received from Feng Qingxue.Ye Futian blinked, and realized Qin Yi misunderstood what had happened. He scanned the shapely body of Qin Yi and mumbled, \"You know, I'm not that young.\"Qin Yi fell speechless for a second. Soon she realized that Ye Futian was hitting on her and became angry. She turned around and said, \"You're hopeless.\"Seeing she was mad, Ye Futian laughed even more. \"My pleasure, Ms. Qin.\"Qin Yi stopped, then kept walking.\"She's nice, you better consider her,\" Yu Sheng said. Ye Futian looked at him with confusion. \"Consider what?\"\"She could be a wife candidate.\" Yu Sheng looked serious.Ugh, this guy\u2026 Ye Futian rubbed his head. One could really be influenced by his friends....The academy was full of activity these days. Endless groups of people were marching towards Mount Tianyao, most of whom looked high-spirited. It happened every year; but in a few days, they would return frustrated, defeated, and injured.During the hunting season, the academy cleared the area for students, making sure the monsters were safe to deal with. However, some level seven, eight, or even level nine monsters would still be a nightmare for some unfortunate students.This hunt served as a trial, but also as a purgatory.Under the mountain, students entered in groups. Some of them looked familiar.\"Look, it's Feng Qingxue.\" People noticed the girl in this particular group. She was dressed in scarlet. She looked even more attractive and charming than usual in such a beautiful dress.\"The guy next to her, who's that?\" Some people were surprised to see a charming young man next to Feng Qingxue, in addition to her friend Murong Qing.\"He's Murong Qiu, Murong Qing's cousin. He is the pride of the Murong family. He's already in the highest plane of awakening, the Unmaker. He's with Feng Qingxue for the hunt? No wonder she...\"People thought of that some poor guy who had experienced a harsh rejection at the hands of Feng Qingxue. They shook their heads and sighed with pity.Keep their distance? Then why the heck was Murong Qiu here?They could not help imagining how frustrated Ye Futian would be if he saw this.\"He was rejected so badly. I guess he's going to quit the Fall Exam.\" After seeing Murong Qiu accompany Feng Qingxue into the mountain, people began to gossip.Ye Futian soon heard about this from the others. He was a bit confused as to why he had somehow become the main character. Even though he had never thought about pursuing Feng Qingxue, he still felt slightly pissed off. It was not out of love, but pure agitation.Still, he did not mind much, anyway. He had a more important job to do before the Fall Quarter Examination, which was to further cultivate into a new plane.Days later, in the dorm, Ye Futian was cultivating quietly. The burning flames of the sun were all over his body. It forged his joints, muscles, and bones. He owned the life spirit of the sun, which indicated that he was supposed to major in fire-element techniques.While he was on Mount Tianyao, he had perceived wood-element Qi from plants, and water-element Qi from waterfalls. However, they did not compare to the power from his life spirit, the sun. He wondered whether he was being too greedy. It had only come about by accident.Someone was approaching. Ye Futian stopped his work and looked at the approaching figure.\"Yu Sheng, what happened?\"He knew that Yu Sheng would not bother to come in unless something terrible had happened.\"People were evacuating the mountain recently, and some of them brought back terrifying news,\" Yu Sheng said.\"What is it?\" Ye Futian was caught in curiosity.\"Some claimed that they saw a dragon in the cleared area.\" Yu Sheng's eyes were lit up with excitement.\"A dragon?\" Ye Futian's eyes also shined brightly. He was shocked that even after being cleared, the hunting grounds still had a dragon.The mere presence of a dragon would bring the entire city of Qingzhou into a panic. They only ever seemed to show up in the restricted area. The dragon was a sign of pure power; the emperor of demons and monsters.\"Do you believe it?\" Ye Futian asked.\"Some swore that it was true. The academy should have evacuated the whole place already. If the academy actually had, it could possibly be true,\" Yu Sheng said.\"Let's go for a walk.\" Ye Futian stood up and walked towards the yard. By now, many students had returned. Some students refused to go into the mountain, knowing that they were incapable of ensuring their own safety.When the two arrived at the mountain, they saw people fleeing in groups, which seemed unusual. They looked at each other, then someone in the crowd asked, \"What's going on?\"\"Some true evil broke out of the restricted area. The masters are now demanding that everyone leave the area as soon as possible,\" someone answered.\"A true evil? Is it something that cannot be killed by the masters?\" People were shocked.\"I heard it was a giant Thunder Boa, thousands of years old, with a threatening sense of demonic power. No one can do anything to her for now.\"The crowd bubbled with excitement. Ye Futian and Yu Sheng felt slightly confused. What was it exactly? A Boa, or a Dragon?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 7": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Legend of FutianCH 7Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayHordes of people were making their way out of the mountains. Some felt lively, while others were drained of energy; almost all of them, however, had discussed the topic of the demon boa as they traveled.The instructors had already made a decision. Those who claimed to have witnessed the demon boa must have been mistaken. After all, demons in cultivation may have a similar appearance as a dragon.Ye Futian saw a familiar figure making her way down the mountain road. Although Feng Qingxue's bright red clothing was covered with a thin layer of dust, her beautiful face remained clean and radiant. She seemed to be in a good mood, chatting with Murong Qiu, who remained at her side.After seeing Feng Qingxue and Murong Qiu together, many people peeked unconsciously at Ye Futian. Their actions confused Ye Futian.When Feng Qingxue noticed this, she could not help but take a look at him herself. However, when her eyes landed on him, she quickly looked away, not wanting to make eye contact. Her conversation with Murong Qiu halted.Beside her, Murong Qiu took notice of her sudden quietness. His eyes followed the descent of road and found Ye Futian a distance ahead of them. Even his side profile oozed with pride; his smiling eyes showed his carefree nature. After a quick glance, Murong Qiu looked away.Ye Futian paid little to no attention to his classmates. Turning to Yu Sheng, he asked, \"Do you think the academy would keep it from us if it was a dragon?\"Yu Sheng stayed quiet for a little bit, then nodded slightly. \"Yes.\"\"Let's go check it out before they place the entire mountain on lockdown.\" As soon as the words left his mouth, Ye Futian's legs carried him up the mountain in a sprint once again.Bystanders stopped to take everything in. Feng Qingxue stood in shock. She stared as he made his way up, getting closer to her. Did her actions finally break him?She continued to stare as he came closer, her lips twitched. Just as she was about to speak, he breezed right past her. So, he wasn't coming for her.Yu Sheng brushed past Feng Qingxue and Murong Qiu, but not without a chilling glance.\"What are they doing?\" It seemed that everyone else had thought the same as Feng Qingxue, but they were all mistaken. Why were the two of them going back up into the mountains at a time like this?\"Is he crazy? He didn't want to go before, but now that a demon boa had been sighted, and everyone had to be evacuated, he wants to go back up?\"People were unable to understand Ye Futian's logic, but even Ye Futian did not know what he was doing. However, this was a dragon they were talking about, a creature from the legends. If it was beneficial to observe animals under the Freedom Meditation, what would happen if it was a dragon?Yu Sheng wanted to know what dragons looked like, too.The main road leading to the top of the mountain was blocked off, senior brothers of the Qingzhou Academy stood guard at the blockade. Only people leaving the mountains were allowed to pass through. It was good that Ye Futian and Yu Sheng were prepared for this. They took a small side road far from the main, a shortcut of sorts.They passed by several blockades on their way up, but these obstacles only heightened their curiosity and at the same time confirmed their suspicions of a cover-up.\"We can't keep wandering blindly, which direction should we head in?\" Yu Sheng had enough of sneaking around in the mountain forest.\"We should go where there the largest amount of people is being evacuated,\" Ye Futian said with determination. Yu Sheng immediately understood, they began to travel towards the most heavily regulated area.Time passed little by little, the sun had descended and the night had come, making it easier for the two to continue unnoticed.\"There seem to be fewer and fewer people around. We must be in the center of the lockdown zone. Let's test out our luck and wait here.\" Ye Futian leaned his back against a nearby tree, resting his tired eyes. The sky got darker; the area had a strange silence. No demon activity was detected.Suddenly, a flash of lightning brightened up the night sky, casting a light on the tightly knit forest. Presently, everyone on guard in this area looked up with a solemn look on all their faces.Was it here?Thunder rumbled, flashes of lightning appeared more and more frequently. Ye Futian felt excited, but also nervous at this strange sight.\"A Dragon, it's really a dragon!\" a voice rang out from somewhere in the area.Ye Futian jumped up from the ground he was sitting on, eyes locked on the sky ahead of him. There, he saw it, a dragon dancing in the night sky. This creature, a couple thousand feet long, disappeared into thin air and reappeared in a different location. The rumblings got louder and louder. The whole area was engulfed in lightning and thunder.\"Dragon....\" Yu Sheng stared at the sky. It was impossible to put into words what he was feeling.From above came multiple figures, their aura brighter than anything else. A simple look at their silhouettes was enough to let people know that they were individuals with extreme power. They must be the best of the best.Another figure appeared in midair. This person looked to be middle-aged, and was extremely handsome. In his presence, the men from before retreated slightly. It was obvious that this man was greatly respected.\"That is not a dragon.\" The middle-aged man watched the creature in the sky with his hands resting behind his back. His first words sent shivers down everyone's spines.\"It only looks and acts like a dragon. This creature was purposely released here,\" the man continued, \"to create a creature that replicates a dragon so perfectly, they must have been in contact with a real dragon. How could this be and why have they come to Mount Tianyao?\"\"So that's why it hasn't caused any harm since its appearance. If it were a real dragon, we'd all be goners,\" said one of the men in the group.\"Even though it's not real, we still don't know what its appearance at Qingzhou Academy means.\" The middle-aged man floated in midair, looked down at the group of youths, all of them had come from a different direction. \"You guys have quite some guts.\"Below him, were Ye Futian and Yu Sheng. It turned out they were not the only ones who didn't leave the mountain, others were probably curious about this legendary creature as well.\"These rascals.\" Someone in the group of men scolded the youngsters. How dare they break in during a lockdown?Ye Futian thought of nothing but the dragon in the sky. He kept recalling the movements of the dragon.The Freedom Meditation was in progress, lightning and thunder went off within his Life Palace, a dragon appeared as well.Thunder Spiritual Qi rushed to gather around Ye Futian as the lightning coursed through his body, his consciousness was faltering. In his eyes, only the mystical dragon existed.Every scene was engraved deep in his mind.A flash of lightning abruptly struck him between his eyes. The image of the dragon bored into him.The fearful vibrations of thunder took over Ye Futian's entire body, causing him to growl deeply at the sheer power. He was no longer able to break free from this state, every movement of the dragon was engraved deeply in his mind.Upon the sight of the magnificent dragon approaching him, Ye Futian shuddered slightly, but was unable to move away.\"Watch out!\" Yu Sheng shouted when he felt something amiss, but it was too late. The dragon charged at Ye Futian at a crazed speed and entered his body through the spot in between his eyes. Ye Futian let out an ear-splitting scream with the thundering pain, it was as if a real dragon had entered his mind.\"Boom!\" His mind shook and his consciousness scattered.\"You've finally...grown up.\" A voice sounded in his mind, his body fell straight back. The anomalies in the area disappeared.\"What's this?\" The group of men wanted to know. Their eyes focused on Ye Futian's fallen body. \"What just happened?\"\"What an unlucky guy. It looks like he was attacked by the fake dragon,\" someone said.\"That was so gutsy, let's check to see if there's anything wrong with him,\" said someone else.\"He's fine.\" The handsome, middle-aged man spoke. By Ye Futian's side, Yu Sheng looked up to the man and heard him say, \"Entrust him to me for now, I'll bring him back and have him examined.\"Everyone nodded in agreement. However, Yu Sheng had something to say about this, \"Elder, may I come along?\"\"Don't worry; nothing will happen to him. I'm just going to be at the academy,\" said the middle-aged man. There was something strange about his eyes that made people willing to trust him and thus, Yu Sheng nodded. \"Please take care of him, Elder.\"......When Ye Futian finally awoke, he did not feel a single shred of pain, which he thought was strange.His consciousness slipped into his Life Palace. Just as he thought, above the Word Tree was an area of lightning and thunder. A dragon flew around the sky, a truly majestic sight.\"I can't believe it actually came into my Life Palace.\" He was shaken up. After fainting, he could hear something, but he couldn't recall what it was.He had already fainted twice since officially beginning to develop. When he thought of how unlucky he was, he could only smile bitterly. If he could benefit from it somehow though, he wouldn't mind fainting a couple more times.As if he could feel that something was out of place, he shot up and realized that the clothes he was wearing were not his own. It was also obvious to him that he was not in his own dorm.Standing up, Ye Futian pushed open the door, and was able to see that he was in a quiet, elegant residence. Ahead was a pavilion, and quietly seated there was a young lady. It looked like she was drawing, beside her was a middle-aged male, sipping on tea. It was such a peaceful scene.With a light foot, Ye Futian made his way to the pavilion. His gaze fell on the young lady's drawing. She was using a special type of paper, and she wasn't drawing; she was continuously inscribing lines and streaks. From those inscribings seeped a bit of Spiritual Qi.\"This, it's an amulet.\" Ye Futian was shocked. This young girl in front of him knew how to inscribe scrolls?Then wouldn't that make her an Inscriber? That's so awesome!\"Have you seen one before?\" The middle-aged man put down his teacup and looked towards Ye Futian.\"Not in person, I've only seen them in books,\" Ye Futain replied. \"A shield is inscribed on the scroll paper with Metal Spiritual Qi. This must be a defense spell.\"\"You can see it?\" The middle-aged man was surprised.\"Yeah.\" Ye Futian nodded. Through Freedom Meditation, his ability to perceive Spiritual Qi had improved greatly.The man smiled and asked, \"Do you want to learn?\"\"Yes!\" He nodded again and immediately bowed to pay his respects. \"Disciple, Ye Futian, would like to pay formal respects to Master.\"He worked fast.Ye Futian understood the importance of being an Inscriber. It was a more rare occupation than being a Sorcerer. It was also a high-status occupation. An Inscriber also had to be a gifted Sorcerer.\"You're as shameless as they all say.\" The young girl put down the pen in her hand and looked at Ye Futian.Ye Futain didn't care, he just smiled. Seeing her amazing looks, he said, \"Hey, beautiful. So we meet again.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was apparent to him that there was some relationship between the professor and Hua Jieyu, which made the compliment necessary.\"Okay. Sounds like you know how to talk.\" The professor smiled and sipped his tea, then looked at Ye Futian. \"Everyone in this academy could be your master. If you want to learn more in the future, come see me; I would be okay with you calling me master.\"Hua Jieyu was confused by her father. He had stopped accepting students for so long; how talented would Ye Futian have to be to get him to make an exception?\"Greetings from Ye Futian, your humble student,\" Ye Futian saluted.The professor nodded and said, \"I never cared about these unnecessary and over-elaborate formalities. The Fall Quarter Exam is about to start. Go prepare yourself.\"\"What? Today?\" Ye Futian was shocked. He had not realized how long he had slept.Ding, ding, ding. As if responding to him, the academy bell rang, the sound reverberating all over the place. Ye Futian looked off towards the distance. It was finally time.\"Jieyu, send him out,\" the professor told her. Hua Jieyu noticed that Ye Futian looked a bit proud.\"Come on, let's go.\" Hua Jieyu began leaving.\"I haven't changed yet.,\" Ye Futian said. The clothes on him had to have belonged to the professor.\"Then go change.\" Hua Jieyu was giving him the cold shoulder. Ye Futian caught up to her and asked, \"So, what should I call you? Ms. Hua Senior or Ms. Hua Junior?\"\"Neither.\"\"Well then, fox it is,\" Ye Futian shrugged, \"What plane are you in now, fox?\"Hua Jieyu ignored his questions.\"People say that you are a Mandate Sorcerer, is that true?\" Ye Futian kept asking still without a response.\"Have you ever dated anyone?\" Ye Futian would not not let her go. \"No comment means yes.\"\"No.\" Hua Jieyu slightly bit her lips as she stared at him with anger.\"Me neither; what a coincidence.\" Seeing her angry actually made him smile.Hua Jieyu suddenly stopped. When Ye Futian looked back at her, he noticed that her young and delicate face was shining in the rays of the early morning sunlight. This made him forget everything he had had on his mind.\"You are seriously shameless.\" Hua Jieyu turned around and left. A smile appeared on Ye Futian's face when he saw her gradually disappear.The academy was busier than ever today. Crowds of people were continually entering the academy.Every Fall Quarter Exam, the big local chiefs of Qingzhou would join the event, as would the parents of the current students. They were all qualified for entry. Those who could not enter would wait outside, looking forward to finding out which students had stood out this time.Although all the exam participants were kids, the eldest of whom were still under eighteen, the stars of this exam would definitely be prominent chiefs of Qingzhou in the future. Most of the big chiefs that watched this event were also former students of the academy. The exam drew attention from all over the city.\"The legendary girl of Qingzhou Academy, Hua Jieyu, has aced the written test all three years. I bet she will take our breath away this time.\"\"Yang Xiu has been right behind her in second place for the past three years. He might outperform her.\"\"Murong Qiu, the son of the remarkable Murong family, is already in the Unmaker Plane; in fact, he has already qualified to be an official student. Rumor has it he wanted to be official along with the unquestioned No.1 of the Fall Quarter Exam, so he refused to be official without the exam. This might be his last try.\"\"Don't forget the son of the chamberlain for the Ye family, Yu Sheng. He would have been an official student last Spring if it weren't for Ye Futian. Remember, he is only fifteen.\"The crowd outside spoke as if they knew everything about the academy. It showed how influential the academy was around the city.Ye Futian returned to his dorm. Yu Sheng was reassured seeing him back, and asked him, \"Are you alright?\"\"I'm better than alright,\" Ye Futian laughed. Suddenly, his body started cracking with the sound of thunder. Thunderbolts ran through his body with absolute control from his mind.\"Wow, amazing; that is the power of the Invincible Plane.\" Yu Sheng was surprised that Ye Futian had it made into another plane with the power of thunder. It seemed the interaction with the dragon had made him even stronger.\"You can try some basic spells now,\" Yu Sheng said.\"Not enough time, buddy. The Fall Exam has started,\" Ye Futian said.\"Your father is coming to the event to watch you.\"\"He's coming?\" Ye Futian was shocked for a moment, then smiled. He realized that this time might be a big surprise for his father.Ye Futian changed, then he and Yu Sheng left the dorm for the battle arena.The arena was equipped with three thousand desks, all lined up in rows. In the front, over the staircases, there were many official students and professors from the academy. The stands on the sides were filled with people, including the big chiefs of Qingzhou and parents of the students.Ye Futian's presence drew some attention, most of it out of confusion. The story of him being rejected by Feng Qingxue, and Feng Qingxue being accompanied by Murong Qiu during the hunt, had spread all over the city. Then there was the story of his altercation with the demon boa in Mount Tianyao. He was only adding to his notorious reputation; in fact, he looked tough. Few would survive after being attacked by a demon boa.\"The academy officially announced it was a demon boa that attacked you,\" Yu Sheng told Ye Futian. Ye Futian nodded and scanned the far corner of the stand, then smiled.\"Come on,\" he said, running towards the corner.There was a small group sitting there. Ye Baichuan was chatting with another middle-aged person. He saw Ye Futian coming and called out, \"Listen, I am only here for you, do you understand? If you perform horribly, never tell anyone that you are my son again.\"Ye Futian felt humiliated. \"Seriously, dad? Not in public. Can you at least try not to embarrass me?\"\"Now you know you have a reputation to protect?\" He was surprised at Ye Futian's response, as he had heard how shameless his son could be.\"I feel so sad,\" Ye Futian said, patting his own forehead.\"Stop pretending. Did you offend my future daughter-in-law?\" Ye Baichuan just would not let him off the hook. Ye Futian soon found that Feng Qingxue was sitting quietly next to Mr. Feng. She avoided making eye contact with him.\"Ye Baichuan, when the hell did I promise you that my daughter would be your daughter-in-law? Stop that nonsense,\" Feng Ruhai told Ye Biachuan.\"Uncle Feng...\" Ye Futian was disturbed by what was happening.\"Boy, how are you doing in your cultivation recently? Any better?\" Feng Ruhai asked him.\"Of course. There has been some progress. Otherwise I would not have shown up for the exam,\" Ye Futian told him.\"Good for you. You are still young; you should focus on your cultivation. Do not think and talk about nonsense like your father.\" Feng Ruhai stared at Ye Baichuan.\"Roger that,\" Ye Futian laughed.\"Yu Sheng, we really have some expectations for you this time,\" Feng Ruhai said, looking at Yu Sheng.\"Okay.\" Yu Sheng seemed indifferent.\"Go prepare yourselves for the exam,\" Feng Ruhai said. They nodded, then Ye Futian and Yu Sheng turned around and left. Later, Feng Qingxue left in another direction.\"What's wrong with these kids? Do you have any idea?\" Ye Baichuan frowned, feeling confused. Ye Futian and Feng Qingxue had quarreled with each other all the time when they were young. Something must have been wrong if they were just staying silent.People spoke casually amongst themselves. Even though it was only the written test today, the audience still showed high interest. Knowledge was as crucial as talent, and served as the foundation for their futures. The weaker students with profound experience could beat out those who were stronger than them in the future.The students entered and took their seats. There were three thousand of them. How grand it was!Ye Futian and Yu Sheng entered and sat down in a row. Ye Futian took a deep breath. This was his first time taking the Fall Quarter Exam. It was impossible not to be nervous.\"It's her! Hua Jieyu!\" A girl entered and suddenly drew all the attention from the crowd.She was in a light-colored suit, but she was so beautiful that she seemed to shine over everyone.\"God, such a beauty.\" The students were amazed.\"She is so gorgeous, and she is only fifteen. I bet three years from now she will be a 'Helen of Troy' for the boys.\" People believed that with her beauty and talent, she would definitely be a troublemaker in the future. Even some of the big chiefs knew that she had quite a history.\"People say that Murong Qiu was rejected by her?\" In the stands, a member of the Murong family seemed disappointed by these words.\"It's okay. With such talent, how can you expect her to accept any boy in this city? It's a pity for Murong Qiu, though. He would have been an official last year if not for her,\" someone said to the member of Murong family, trying to comfort them.Yep, she is a fox. Ye Futian also noticed her and the fact that she had drawn everyone's attention. No one else could ever manage to do this except her.Hua Jieyu stood for a while, scanning the rows for a spot. Soon she began walking again. All the students that had already sat down were praying to themselves that she would stop next to them.However, none of their fantasies came true. She finally stopped and picked a seat. People stopped praying, and began to wonder who was the lucky bastard she had chosen to sit next to.Suddenly, they all froze in shock, completely baffled by her choice.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 9": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Legend of FutianCH 9Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayHua Jieyu sat down beside Ye Futian. This was the same Ye Futian who had opted out of exams for three years, gotten rejected by Feng Qingxue, and was about to be kicked out of Qingzhou Academy.\"What a lucky dog.\" Many people were very jealous. How come he got to sit next to Hua Jieyu his first time joining the Fall Quarter Examinations?Furthermore, Hua Jieyu was sitting in an aisle seat, which meant that only one person had the privilege of sitting next to her. Seeing this opportunity given to Ye Futian, one could only imagine how the others felt about this.Ye Futian could feel the hateful stares directed at him. He took a glance at the girl sitting beside him; she was sitting there silently, elegant and natural. It was as if she had no idea who he was.This fox, she definitely did this on purpose, Ye Futian thought to himself. He had originally planned to participate in the exams quietly, but now he had become the center of attention for all the wrong reasons.As more and more people gathered around, the area surrounding Hua Jieyu became the most sought-after seats. People glared at Ye Futian as they passed by. Then, a delicate-looking youth approached him and asked, \"Can we switch seats?\"Ye Futian looked up, his eyes meeting with a boy about the same age as himself. His delicate face glowed with pride, his voice natural.\"It's Yang Xiu.\" Many people's attention was still on where Ye Futian's was. Yang Xiu had placed second in the written examinations for the past three years. He had always wanted to surpass Hua Jieyu and a lot of people knew he had a crush on her.Yang Xiu had not only done extremely well in the written examinations; he was also extremely gifted. He was already on the seventh Awakening Plane, the Mystery Plane, his ability to perceive Fire Spiritual Qi was also at the highest level. He truly was a genius. Losing to Hua Jieyu only in the slightest bit, he was still one of the best outer sect disciples.Ye Futian looked at Yang Xiu and thought, Wow, now that's rude.\"Of course...\" said Ye Futian. The people around him were stunned. Was he really just going to give up that easily?\"...not,\" he finished. Hearing these three words, the smile on Yang Xiu's face was now frozen. He saw Ye Futian's smile; it looked like he was mocking him.\"I know you. You gave up on participating in any examinations for three years and are about to get kicked out of the academy. A person like you shouldn't be wasting time here.\" Yang Xiu was not mad; he was simply trying to mock Ye Futian back.\"But I want to.\" Ye Futian was still smiling.\"Then I hope that it won't be too embarrassing for you after the written exam,\" Yang Xiu laughed lightly. \"But then again, it wouldn't be the first time.\"After mocking Ye Futian, Yang Xiu gave Hua Jieyu a look before he headed back to his seat. He sat back down and got extremely serious, like a warrior before a battle.\"What a sad life.\" Ye Futian looked at Yang Xiu's silhouette with great pity.Ye Futian's rejection did not shock anyone. This was what he really was: a legendary, arrogant loser. However, his legend would come to an end after this year's Fall Quarter Exam. Ye Futian was going to be expelled.As the outer sect disciples entered, the official disciples surrounded the entire gymnasium.There were three thousand tables, but only a little over one thousand people were participating in the Fall Quarter Examinations. After all, a lot of the first-year outer sect students lacked the confidence to get a decent grade. They knew it was difficult to do well, so they chose to opt out of the examination and keep a clean slate than to have a bad grade on their permanent record. However, to give up participating in the examination for three years like Ye Futian had done was simply unheard of. This was why he was a legend. Even the academy had had enough of him.At the front of the gymnasium, many of the official disciples were present. Qin Yi stood there and glanced in Ye Futian's direction. After three years, he was finally here. He wasn't giving up on the exams again. Let's hope for a miracle.\"Yang Xiu already made a deal with the School of Divination Arts. After the Fall Quarter Examinations end, he's going to be admitted into the school as an official disciple. I don't even know where that useless loser, Ye Futian, got the guts to talk to him like that,\" said Mo Lanshan. He was chuckling lightly beside Qin Yi.Qin Yi's eyebrows furrowed. Ye Futian did have some problems, but she still wouldn't call him a useless loser. \"Do you have something against him?\" she asked Mo Lanshan.\"Of course, I do!\" Mo Lanshan felt no need to hide his feelings. \"How dare he say those things to you in class. I really don't understand why you have such high hopes for him. Why do you waste your time on him?\"Qin Yi did not know what to say to defend herself. Maybe it was because she could not forget the amazing results he had achieved during the entrance talent inspections three years ago. He should not have ended up like this.\"It's time, hand out the test papers,\" said an elder seated behind the two. Official disciples rose out of their seats and began to distribute the written examinations. This meant that the Fall Quarter Written Examinations had officially begun.The enormous crowd was in complete silence. The people who came to observe the examination process consisted of parents and family, as well as many well-known individuals of the city of Qingzhou. They understood that they had to stay quiet too.As everyone got their test papers, Feng Qingxue took a deep breath. She hoped to rank well in this year's Fall Quarter Examinations and gain the privilege to access the second-floor of the Qingzhou Academy library. This way, she would have unlimited access to some of the most powerful spells.Ling Xiao glanced at Ye Futian before looking down at his test paper. When he noticed the beautiful Hua Jieyu seated beside Ye Futian, he could not hide the look of jealousy on his face. Ling Xiao had always had a crush on Feng Qingxue, and Hua Jieyu was the girl of his dreams, unreachable. How was Ye Futian worthy of sitting next to her?Hua Jieyu remained quiet after receiving her test papers, probably because she was just that confident. Somewhere near the front of the room, Yang Xiu's fists clenched tight and then relaxed, in preparation for the exam.As for Ye Futian, he looked through the test questions once and a smile appeared on his face. He then picked up his pen; his very first Fall Quarter Examination was finally here. He knew many people were waiting for him to make a fool out of himself and looked forward to seeing him be expelled. What a pity; they were about to be disappointed.The test questions went from easy to difficult, starting with basic questions about cultivation. Most students were able to answer these questions.Ye Futian's pen danced across the test paper. He answered the questions with ease.\"Interesting,\" said Ye Futian as he read one of the test questions. During a battle between a knight and a sorcerer, the sorcerer's elemental Spiritual Qi runs out. If you were the knight, what would you have done? What if you were the sorcerer?He scribbled down his answer quickly.Time was passing by quickly. Some students were now sweating. Towards the back of the test packet, the questions got more abstract and more difficult to answer.Unknowingly, Ye Futian was already on the last question. This question seemed easy enough.The question was: A group of martial arts cultivators and a group of divination arts cultivators on the same plane and level fought. Which side won?This was a freebie. In a group battle, the martial arts cultivators would have people from a variety of occupations. Naturally, the divination arts group would also consist of a variety of elemental sorcerers. If the sorcerers worked together, the amount of power they possessed could destroy the opposing group. There wouldn't be much fighting.Ye Futian thought of this and smiled. After writing down his response, he put his pen down.Coincidently, Hua Jieyu had also just placed her pen down on her desk beside him.The two looked at each other. Ye Futian gave her a provoking smile. All Hua Jieyu did in response was glare at him, but no matter what she did, she remained breathtakingly beautiful.Nobody amongst the test-takers noticed their little exchange, but at the front of the room, someone took notice of Hua Jieyu.\"She's still the same, always the first one to finish,\" said an elder at the academy. She was always the focus of the room, even if she just sat quietly, focused on her exam.\"That's not true, the young man next to her finished just before her, but his responses are probably rubbish,\" said another elder. He smiled and shook his head thinking of how hard it must have been for Ye Futian to focus with Hua Jieyu sitting next to him.\"Wow, look how quickly he finished. You worked so hard to give him a fighting chance, but all he's thinking of is how to put on a show to attract a girl's attention.\" Mo Lanshan's words were directed at Qin Yi. Her eyes went to Ye Futian and she felt a twinge of disappointment.Slowly, more and more people finished up their exams, some excited, some not so excited.Finally, an elder stood up on the stage and signaled the end of this year's Fall Quarter Examinations.The official disciples were waiting. Once the elder stood up, they moved forward to collect test papers.Even though the test papers had been collected, everyone remained seated in the gymnasium. Qingzhou Academy's Fall Quarter Written Exams had always been graded on the spot, and the results were announced the same day.A group of academy elders and outer sect lecturers graded the exams together with great speed. As they graded, the students looked on nervously, while the audience chatting lightly.When the lecturers began to separate the test papers by score, the atmosphere intensified.After a while, one of the lecturers walked up to face the students, holding a list. Everyone knew that the list of people who had passed this year's Fall Quarter Examinations would be announced first.\"Li Yu, Fang Yun, Mo Hanjiang....\" With every name the lecturer announced, students began to relax one by one. Of course, there were also many who looked very disappointed, as they had hoped for better results.Other than the list of those who passed, there were also lists of Rank 3, Rank 2, and Rank 1 students yet to be announced.After the names on the first list were announced, it was revealed that there were seventy-two people in Rank 3, thirty-six in Rank 2, and only three in Rank 1.Qin Yi listened carefully. After the list of rankings was announced, her disappointment heightened. If he could not even pass the written exam, then he was destined to be kicked out of the academy.Her eyes drifted toward Ye Futian and she let out a deep sigh.Seated in front of Ye Futian, Yang Xiu laughed coldly. \"Just as expected. You were going to fail regardless, why embarrass yourself like this?\"Feng Qingxue also looked at Ye Futian. Her eyes reflected her disappointment, but it disappeared shortly. Wasn't this what everyone expected?\"Ye Futian, remember what you said in class last time? Now that you're about to be expelled, doesn't it feel like a big slap in the face?\" Ling Xiao asked loudly from far away, causing many people to avert their attention towards Ye Futian. Secretly, they were all happy that this shameless bastard was about to be expelled.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, Ye Futian seemed calm as usual.\"This list only contains those who merely qualified; why are you laughing like that?\" Ye Futian spoke slowly, then glanced around to see that other people were also chuckling.\"Come on, seriously,\" Ling Xiao laughed even harder and stared at Ye Futian. \"You don't think you made it onto the List of Excellence, do you? You have been daydreaming for three years, and you are clearly not going to stop now. You know what? You are just hopeless.\"\"Look at your face. Stop that outrageous laugh, please. I doubt you will be able to keep it when I make it onto the list of the highest rankings.\" Ye Futian frowned at him. He knew Ling Xiao had always looked down on him, but how severe was his hatred that Ling Xiao was excited about his failure?\"Sounds like you will not shed a tear until you see the coffin, right? Then keep waiting.\" Ling Xiao sounded cold. Ye Futian shook his head and ignored him.The lecturers were still busy organizing the test papers and lists. After a while, Qin Yi came onto the stage to announce the names of 72 students who had made it onto the List of Perfection. Of course, a remarkable student like Ling Xiao was on the list. He was now behaving even more arrogantly towards Ye Futian. He was waiting until the end of the list announcement to throw every insult right in Ye Futian's face.Feng Qingxue felt excited because her name had not shown up on the List of Perfection. She had definitely passed the test, which meant that her name was possibly on the List of Brilliance. Once she performed well after the written test, she would have achieved her goal.\"Feng Qingxue.\" The List of Brilliance was being announced, and Feng Qingxue was first. Her eyes shined as she smiled with ecstasy. She definitely deserved her spot.\"Yu Sheng.\" The announcements continued. Every name on the list really meant something at the academy.\"Murong Qiu.\" This was the last name on the list. The announcer lowered their hands.Murong Qiu suddenly turned pale, and looked as if he were truly frustrated.There were 36 names on the List of Brilliance. For most ordinary people, it would be glorious; but sadly for him, this was not the case. Anything other than the List of Excellence meant failure to him.Last time, he had ranked third on the List of Excellence. He had participated in the exam this time to challenge the legendary girl, but he had failed again, and by an even worse margin. In the stands, a member of the Murong family also looked pretty gloomy.\"Murong Qiu only made the List of Brilliance. There's not even a rank for this list,\" the Murong family member mumbled. They were right, as only the top three could be ranked for being on the List of Excellence.Other people were also wondering and discussing to themselves. There should be three on the List of Excellence. Common sense said that the legendary girl and Yang Xiu would be the top two. But if that was the case, who had taken Murong Qiu's place and forced him onto the List of Brilliance?It was even more mysterious because the famous students had all already been listed on the List of Brilliance. People could not find anyone that was missing.\"Looks like we have a dark horse; but who is it?\" People started looking around to figure out who they were missing for this possible honor.This mystery had nothing to do with Ling Xiao. He watched Ye Futian intently, believing he was just bluffing and pretending to be calm after the first two lists had been announced.In the very front, several masters of the academy were having a debate over the ranks of the last three tests. Yang Xiu took a deep breath; he was not sure whether he would beat Hua Jieyu this time. He had already promised the College of Sorcery that after this Fall Quarter Exam that he would join the college and become an official student, which meant that this was his last chance to beat Hua Jieyu.Finally, the masters reached a consensus. Someone recorded the decision, and a master went towards the crowd, prepared to give the final announcement. The whole place was suddenly cloaked in silence. Everyone's ears perked up for the final decision.\"Yang Xiu, number three on the List of Excellence,\" the master gave the first name. Everyone immediately began gossiping.Yang Xiu was only number three? For real?Yang Xiu, someone who had always ranked under Hua Jieyu, was suffering the same tragedy as Murong Qiu? Who had caused that?Impossible! Yang Xiu had gotten nothing but disappointment from the wait. He seemed lost. This has to be impossible\u2026.His entire mind had been fixated on being ranked over Hua Jieyu. However, this time, it had turned out even worse. How was he supposed to accept this reality?\"Who is it, for god's sake?\" People were becoming even more curious. They began focusing on the master announcing the list.\"Number two on the List of Excellence, Hua Jieyu.\" Another name came out, and it bewildered the entire crowd.Hua Jieyu had consecutively ranked number one for three straight Fall Quarter Exams. Now she was number two? How could that have happened?What was even more strange was that neither Yang Xiu or Murong Qing had beaten her. There was only one thing on the minds of everyone in the building: who was this John Doe?Hua Jieyu was even a bit surprised herself. She subconsciously looked at Ye Futian, and suddenly realized that something unusual might have been happening.The tension was at an all-time high. Everyone waited in suspense to find out who it was.He made it. Yu Sheng tightened his fists. He was kind of excited. No one knew why he was suddenly behaving like this, or whether there was anything worth being excited about. However, he was the only one who knew what was coming.The eyes of the master passed all over the crowd, eventually stopping on a boy. The master seemed astonished and surprised. For three years he had been a nobody at the academy, but now he was going to be the superstar?\"The number one ranking on the List of Excellence for the Qingzhou Academy Fall Quarter Examination is\u2026\" the master paused, then said slowly:\"Ye\u2014Fu\u2014Tian!\"The crowd immediately shut down and became silent upon hearing this name. It was as if the entire building was muted.Every possible expression was showing on the crowd's faces. They had considered every possibility, but not Ye Futian. How could their imagination have been that wild? This guy had abandoned the exams for three years, and had been stuck in the Collection Plane. Ye Futian, champion of the written test, sounded like the worst joke ever.However, people soon realized that the masters of the academy would never pull a prank like that for this exam. Suddenly, they were even more shocked by the decision.\"Ye Futian, champion of the test? Tell me I am dreaming, please.\" Some were doubting whether they had heard the announcement correctly.\"Ye Futian?\" Qin Yi was next to the master. She repeated the name, seemingly dumbfounded. Nobody had thought that his name would show up on the List of Qualification; they thought he wouldn't have done well enough to even accomplish that. It was incredible that he had performed so well that he had made it onto the List of Excellence.Ling Xiao's face turned to stone. He had believed Ye Futian would be expelled from the academy soon, and had prepared a long, humiliating speech for Ye Futian. Now, Ye Futian was number one. How could that have even happened?Feng Qingxue was in such awe that she could not speak. Her eyes moved from the master who had announced the list slowly to where Ye Futian was sitting.Ye Futian sat in his spot quietly. The smile on his face was the same as usual; calm and light. It seemed like he knew he deserved this honor, and that nothing was shocking about the outcome to him. What strong confidence he had.Could it be possible that the last three missed years had only served to make this moment more glorious?Hua Jieyu was sitting next to Ye Futian. She observed this boy with her beautiful eyes. This boy had broken her record, but she did not seem too disappointed; it was not like the bitterness that was on the faces of Yang Xiu and Murong Qiu. Instead, she felt curious and surprised.Her father had told her that Ye Futian was as talented as she was. At first she had refused to admit it. Actually, she had looked forward to this Fall Quarter Exam, because Ye Futian would not have been able to conceal his talent anymore. She was eager to know why her father had broken his rule and accepted him as his student. She was quite surprised by the results.\"Something must be wrong,\" someone yelled all of a sudden. All the eyes were suddenly drawn to the shouter, Yang Xiu, who was standing in front of Ye Futian.It was already disappointing enough to be listed as third place on the List of Excellence, but it was even more humiliating to see that it was Ye Futian who had made this happen. Ye Futian had been humiliated by him moments before the lists were announced. How could this have happened? Had he made himself look like a total fool?\"What's the problem, Yang Xiu?\" The master looked at him.Yang Xiu paused for a second, then glanced at Ye Futian with contempt. \"He sat next to Hua Jieyu. He must have cheated off of her to earn that score.\"\"Yes, plagiarism, that's definitely it,\" Ling Xiao followed. Many others seemed to be in agreement about this reasonable explanation.\"Who do you guys think we are? Professors, or just a bunch of old blind folks?\" It was like cold water was being thrown right in their faces. The test papers of the top three had gone through the strict review of multiple masters. How could plagiarism have gone unnoticed by them?Ye Futian slowly tapped on the desk with his fingers. He was casual and relaxed; he believed that all the doubt would be silenced by the truth.\"You are all honorable masters, but people just have different preferences. I cannot accept the fact that I am listed as number three and that Ye Futian is number one because you preferred his viewpoints.\" Yang Xiu was completely agitated. He was desperately trying to pull Ye Futian off his throne.The master looked at Yang Xiu with disappointment. It seemed that this student had little patience for failure. Without ever enduring failure, even a talented student like Yang Xiu could never make significant achievements in the future.Ye Futian looked at Yang Xiu. He was so persistent, even when it only brought shame onto himself.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 11": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Legend of FutianCH 11Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayEveryone's eyes were on Ye Futian and Yang Xiu. Another one of Qingzhou Academy's elders walked up on the stage and asked Yang Xiu, \"Could it be that you want to grade the exams yourself?\"\"I would not dare to have such thoughts.\" Yang Xiu shook his head. \"I only want to know why he scored higher than me, what was I lacking?\"The Qingzhou Academy elders sat in silence. Finally, one of them nodded and said, \"Alright. Since you have your doubts, then we will let you know the reason why.\"All of the students and everyone observing from the stands remained quiet. They too were curious, what responses could Ye Futian have given to surpass Yang Xiu?\"The first question: During a battle between a knight and a sorcerer, the sorcerer's elemental Spiritual Qi runs out. If you were the knight, what would you do? What if you were the sorcerer? How did you answer this question?\" the elder asked Yang Xiu.Yang Xiu's eyes lit up as he said with confidence, \"If I were the knight, I would continue my attacks until the sorcerer's Spiritual Qi ran out, and end them with a final blow. If I were the sorcerer, I would try to find my opponent's weak point and attack at full force once the opportunity presented itself.\"Many people began to nod. To them, Yang Xiu's response was well-rounded, many people would have answered the same. So where did he go wrong?Even the VIP guests onstage were intrigued. This question was given to test the students' ability to adapt to an emergency situation. In their eyes, Yang Xiu's answer was not bad. How would Ye Futian answer this question?\"Ye Futian, please tell us your response.\" The elder looked at Ye Futian, who in turn, stood up and looked at Yang Xiu. He then said, \"If I were the knight, I wouldn't give my opponent a chance to retaliate. I would attack continuously until he falls. If I were in the sorcerer's position and collected the Wind Element, then I would escape. If I was a sorcerer of any other element, I would pretend to be completely drained of power. If needed, I would even take a hit from the offense and then when they're least prepared, attack with my last remaining power.\"\"Why did you respond in this way?\" asked the elder.\"In a battle between the two, if the knight can drain the sorcerer of his power, then that means that his foundation is probably already stronger. Under continuous attack, the only person making any mistakes would be the sorcerer. The bug in Yang Xiu's response is if the sorcerer was able to find the knight's weakness, then he would have done so during the previous exchanges. If you want your opponent to trip up, you must pay the price,\" Ye Futian answered slowly. Upon hearing this seamless response, Yang Xiu paled.Everyone on stage began to nod in agreement. In comparison, there truly was a big difference between the two.The elder nodded as well, then turned to look at Yang Xiu again. \"The last question: In a group battle between martial art cultivators and sorcerers, who would win? How did you answer this question?\"\"It would be difficult to determine the results if everyone was on the first few planes of Awakening. If everyone was in the same higher plane and if both sides were equal in number, of course, the victory would go to the sorcerers.\" Yang Xiu did not waver in his response. He himself was a sorcerer, so he believed that sorcerers were better than martial art specialists. He was very prideful.\"Ye Futian, and your answer?\" asked the elder.\"At Awakening, the martial art cultivators have a higher chance of victory, anything above this level, sorcerers would have a higher chance,\" he replied calmly.\"Ridiculous. How could martial art cultivators win against sorcerers, even at the Awakening level? Furthermore, sorcerers wouldn't have a 'higher' chance at a more advanced level; they would have a complete victory, no questions asked,\" Yang Xiu said coldly.\"Explain it to him,\" the elder made his request to Ye Futian.Ye Futian looked at Yang Xiu and asked, \"Between martial art cultivators and sorcerers, who has the better fitness, stamina, and speed?\"\"Indeed, those are a sorcerer's weaknesses, but martial art cultivators wouldn't even be able to get close to the sorcerers.\" Yang Xiu stared at Ye Futian.\"At the Awakening level, sorcerers cannot cast their spells from a far distance. If the martial arts cultivators choose to surround without attacking, what do you plan to do?\"\"That's a stupid question. Then I would obviously choose to attack first. Even at the Awakening Plane, sorcerers have more powerful attacks,\" Yang Xiu retorted.\"You attack, I recede. You retreat, I surround,\" said Ye Futian.His words gave shivers to many of the honorable guests. He was able to calmly deliver his battle plans. If a person with a lot of battle experience had said this, no one would have been surprised, but these words came from an inexperienced youngster still in the academy. This was what made it so impressive, but chilling at the same time. His battle tactics showed his detailed understanding of strengths and weaknesses of both martial art cultivators and sorcerers and he was able to incorporate this knowledge into his plans.His tactics were extremely passive aggressive. Martial art cultivators were stronger, have better stamina, and were faster than sorcerers. Sorcerers in the Awakening Plane cannot attack from afar, so all you had to do was wait for them to deplete themselves of power.Yang Xiu did not look well at this point. He stared at Ye Futian and said, \"The Awakening Plane leads to overall enhancement, if sorcerers focused on the enhancement of their spiritual powers, then they might not lose to the martial art cultivators in strength, stamina, and speed.\"\"You already said to disregard the first couple planes of Awakening. Once sorcerers reach the sixth plane, the Invincible Plane, they would have to focus on learning to control their elemental spiritual powers as well as other spiritual powers between Heaven and Earth. They would have to focus on training in sorcery, as the amount of energy they can exert for enhancement is very limited. Martial art cultivators, on the other hand, don't have this problem. Your ideal situation right now is edging closer to cultivation in both arts,\" Ye Futian slowly explained, \"Even though the cultivators in the two groups do not have that much of a difference in the Awakening Plane, the comparison is still there. Naturally, it would be most beneficial to cultivate in both martial and divination arts.\"\"That's enough,\" the elder spoke once again. \"As for the reason behind why it would be possible for martial art cultivators to win at higher levels, we'll leave that for you to think about yourself. Remember, understanding yourself and others is the key to victory. The strong are strong, regardless of which art they cultivate. Yang Xiu, if we placed you against Ye Futian in a fight under fair circumstances, you would be fated to lose.\"Since the start of Qingzhou Academy, the Spring and Fall Quarter Examinations always included a written test. These youngsters have had no actual battle experience, so the most important thing to do is to engrave basic knowledge into their brains.\"Fated to lose?\" Yang Xiu was now in a somber mood. He then lifted his head toward the elder and said, \"I acknowledge my defeat.\"The elder looked at Yang Xiu and knew he had yet to accept this reality. It was not easy to change the mind of a youth.\"The Fall Quarter Written Examinations will end here for today, the most important portion of the test will continue tomorrow,\" announced the elder. Students began to stand one by one, wanting to go up to the stage and greet the VIP guests.This was the end of this quarter's written exams, however, so students had yet to settle into their feelings. Countless pairs of eyes fell on Ye Futian. For the past three years, he had been ridiculed numerous times for being a legendary loser, but now he had thoroughly shocked everyone. Who would believe that he could be ranked first on his first written test?Yang Xiu turned to face Ye Futian. He said coldly, \"I take back what I said to you before. I guess you have learned a lot in the three years you wasted. But even if that's the case, everything written on paper is useless. There is no use in having all of this knowledge if you are physically incapable. With no powers, it would be as easy as stepping on an ant to defeat you.\"\"Are you trying to make yourself feel better after all that embarrassment? How disgraceful. Do you want me to step on you like an ant?\" Yu Sheng stood up, his large physique shadowing over Yang Xiu. His aura was enough to suffocate the latter. In the blink of an eye, Yang Xiu's expression looked even worse than before. Of course, he had heard of Yu Sheng. This psycho knocked out all the teeth of a senior brother two years ago just because the brother had insulted Ye Futian. After punching out his teeth, Yu Sheng picked him up by the collar and tossed him outside the academy gates. Since then, no one has dared to insult Ye Futian in his presence.Even though many people had forgotten about this incident in the passing years, Yang Xiu remembered. He cowered in front of Yu Sheng.\"SCRAM!\" The thunderous shout from Yu Sheng scared Yang Xiu to no end. He quickly looked at Ye Futian and said, \"See you tomorrow.\"Before leaving, he did not forget to take a look at Hua Jieyu, who remained seated beside Ye Futian during all the drama.He could not believe that he was made to look like such a fool in front of her. His mood worsened at the thought.Ye Futian just smiled, not saying anything. A quick glance at Ling Xiao revealed that he was also looking at Ye Futian. Ye Futian could not help but to give a sarcastic smile, thinking of all the things Ling Xiao had previously said to him.Just one smile was enough for Ling Xiao to know that Ye Futian was taunting him.Ling Xiao's fists tightened as he stared at Ye Futian. \"Three years, you're pretty good at hiding secrets. Even though you haven't developed at all, you gained quite a lot of book smarts. This doesn't change a thing though. Even if you got first today, you're going to drop back down to your loser status tomorrow. You might still have a chance of being expelled. Can you imagine how interesting that would that be?\"\"Idiot.\" One word from Ye Futian was enough to wipe the smirk of Ling Xiao's face. He was reminded of the last time Ye Futian had insulted him in the classroom. That bastard.Ye Futian looked around him. He was full of pride. He had just ranked first after all. There were already a lot of people who looked at him less harshly than before. There were even some people who could not look him in the eyes.At this time, Hua Jieyu got up slowly from her seat beside him. As she walked towards the exit, Ye Futian watched her. Hua Jieyu took a couple of steps and suddenly turned back with a smile. Nothing could compare to her beauty in that second.\"I look forward to your performance tomorrow.\" She smiled brightly. People's gazes froze on her smile, their hearts melting at the sight of it. However, this smile was not for them, but for Ye Futian.Leaving her smile imprinted in everyone's minds, Hua Jieyu turned to leave once again. Ye Futian blinked and quickly realized that people were shooting daggers at him with their eyes. Those who did not dare look in his eyes just a minute ago were now looking at him with pure hatred. Everyone seemed like they were out for blood.After seeing those looks, Ye Futian could imagine what was waiting for him tomorrow. In that split second, Ye Futian finally understood the purpose of Hua Jieyu's smile. He could not help himself and cursed her in his mind. \"That fox set me up!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 12": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Legend of FutianCH 12Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayYe Futian was upset. The others were just jealous.Was Hua Jieyu smiling at him? Did they already know each other?It was impossible. How could this legendary loser have gotten the chance to know the real legend of the academy? It must have been that his performance on the written test had made her a bit curious about him. People tried to justify why Hua Jieyu knew none of them, yet she knew Ye Futian.\"Yep, that must be true. Ye Futian will fail tomorrow anyway. What happened today is just another part of his daydream.\"The crowd was dismissed. Ye Futian and Yu Sheng walked towards the stands, where Ye Baichuan was waiting for them. When he saw the boys, he laughed. \"Good job boy. You really are my blood.\"\"Good job? Who was gloating about having an excellent son minutes ago to everyone? Where are those big words now?\" Feng Ruhai was also laughing. \"You are impressive; congratulations.\"\"Sure, so is Qingxue. She made it to the List of Brilliance,\" Ye Baichuan said.\"Come here son, I have to ask you something.\" Ye Baichuan walked away, his son following him. Ye Baichuan stopped and showed a sly smile to Ye Futian. \"Tell me, are you being mean to Qingxue because you are going after someone better? Be honest with me.\"Ye Futian felt so awkward. It seemed that the smile Hua Jieyu had given him had also caused some silly misunderstanding for his father.\"This is really complicated. Leave me alone; I will deal with it.\" Ye Futian shrugged his shoulders.Ye Baichuan gazed at his eyes and said, \"Okay, you take care of this; it's none of my business anymore. Now that you have aced the written test, what about tomorrow?\"Ye Futian looked serious, and showed a curious face to Ye Baichuan. \"In our family ancestry, were there any great Mandate Sorcerers with cultivation specialized in Freedom Meditation?\"\"Of course. I take it you have awakened already?\" Ye Baichuan immediately realized what had happened.\"Yes,\" Ye Futian nodded.\"Good!\" Ye Baichuan suddenly slapped his son on the shoulder. He was so excited that his palm made a cracking sound when it hit Ye Futian's head. He retracted his palm when he saw the painful expression on his son's face.\"What are you doing, Dad?\" Ye Futian stared at his father. \"So, if we have great family ancestors, why am I the only one who awakened with that special talent?\"\"That's definitely because of my efforts.\"Ye Baichuan was taking this for granted. Ye Futian frowned. His father must have been even more shameless than he was at his age.\"I'll tell your godfather the good news. He will be so happy for you, son. Maybe he will come and watch tomorrow by himself,\" Ye Baichuan said. Ye Futian's eyes suddenly lit up with hope. Ever since he was a child, his godfather had told him that one day he would be awakened, and it had finally happened. He could not wait to see the happiness on his godfather's face.As the two were talking, Feng Ruhai also began to speak with his daughter. He asked, \"When did Ye Futian meet Hua Jieyu? Has he been mean to you since then?\"Apparently both fathers believed that Ye Futian had betrayed Feng Qingxue for another beautiful girl. Feng Qingxue realized the misunderstanding and shook her head to deny it.\"Then what's going on? Tell me the truth.\" Feng Ruhai wanted to know what was going on.Feng Qingxue hesitated for a second, then slowly told her father the whole story.\"That is stupid.\" Feng Ruhai seemed angry about what she had said. \"That's not how you deal with relationships. You have known Futian for years. You guys have been arguing and joking forever. There should be nothing that you cannot just sit down and talk about. How rude of you to let someone step in between that! It was not a rejection of pursuit, it was a farewell. Not to mention that this boy has always loved to joke. There is a clear difference between asking you to cultivate and asking you out on a date. As for Yu Sheng, how could he not be angry enough to be unfriendly to you in public? You even hung out with Murong Qiu after all this happened. Have you ever stopped to think about Futian? How is he supposed to deal with the aftermath of your inappropriateness?\"\"Nothing is going on between Murong Qiu and me. We only went hunting together because of his cousin, Murong Qing. I needed some extra help from someone powerful.\" Feng Qingxue began to defend herself stubbornly. \"I know he likes to make jokes, but come on dad; we are both grown-ups. He definitely crossed the line with a joke like that. I believe what Murong Qing said about keeping some distance makes sense.\"\"I know that nothing is going on between Murong Qiu and you, but hanging out with another guy after turning down Futian? That is humiliating. Can't you understand that?\" Feng Ruhai sounded more serious as he stared at his daughter. \"You have known each other since birth, and your Uncle Ye is my best friend. We respect your choices in handling the relationship between yourselves, but you have embarrassed me.\"Feng Qingxue tried to be strong and keep herself from crying because she seldom saw her father being strict like this. She felt uncomfortable. She looked at her father and said, \"I hope what I did is not getting in between you and Uncle Ye. We are both grown-ups, and we will never regret our choices.\"\"Come on, girl.\" Feng Ruhai shook his head. \"Don't you realize that all you did was mask your feelings? You rejected him in such a terrible way because you think that you are way out of his league. You believe that you are mature enough to make these decisions, but a pure friendship without interest and calculation is the most beautiful thing in this world. You would not regret it if Futian kept being laid back as he has always been, but what about today? He just became the new star of this academy. Please tell me you don't regret your actions even a little bit now.\"She reluctantly acknowledged to herself that she did regret what she had done, especially after seeing the new Ye Futian, but she remained silent.\"I have seen Futian grow up over the years. He looks lazy and casual, but deep inside, a tiger is waking up,\" Feng Ruhai continued, \"He has been bearing the insults from others for three years at this academy. Can you think of anyone else with as much tolerance as he has? He is not just some normal guy that you'd never regret missing, trust me.\"After his speech, Feng Ruhai shook his head and left, leaving Feng Qingxue dumbfounded.A tiger\u2026waking up inside. Her eyes turned to a figure in the distance. Soon she turned back and went to the dorm.Ye Futian also said goodbye to his father. He looked towards the arena and found that Qin Yi was staring at him from far away.He pointed his forefinger towards the sky and smiled at Qin Yi with a strong sense of confidence. This gesture conveyed a simple message: Just wait.Qin Yi eyed him, then walked away. She was also disturbed by what he had done. She had never imagined that this guy could ace the written Fall Quarter Exam. She had a faint feeling that another miracle would happen tomorrow. Suddenly, she realized that she had a weird sense of hope and expectation.The crowd was finally gone, and the arena became quiet. However, tomorrow this place would be even more busy. The Fall Quarter Exam had always been the annual focus of the city. After the lists had been announced, the crowd waiting outside the academy soon heard about what Ye Futian had done. It was absolutely fantastic for someone to win over Hua Jieyu and Yang Xiu on the written test. Those who knew this infamous boy before felt even more thrilled by this miracle.......During lunch, the restaurants of Qingzhou were full of customers. Inside a fancy restaurant next to Qingzhou Academy, a group was hatching a plan.Murong Qiu, student of Qingzhou Academy, now sat in a private room. Beside him were the elders of the Murong family. They were led by the current head of this big family, Murong Yunshan, Murong Qiu's father.\"The Fall Quarter Exam today reminded me of our past, decades ago. Brother, we were both big shots in the academy, do you remember?\" Murong Yunshan looked at the middle-aged man sitting opposite him, feeling a sense of nostalgia.\"How could I ever forget that you were the champion and I was in second place for so many years,\" the middle-aged man laughed.\"I can't believe you remember. It's been decades. Sometimes I still want to go back to being careless youth, but it's impossible now. I have been glued to mundane business, and the passion I once had is gone. Your life looks way easier than mine, I must say.\" Murong Yunshan laughed.\"Are you serious? You are the head of an influential family. Why are you so modest when you have so much power? Me? I just hang around in the academy and teach my students some spells to kill time. That's all.\" The middle-aged man shook his head. Actually, he did not just hang around. He was Shi Zhong, the director of the Earth Element Hall, which was one of seven branches in the College of Sorcery. He was one of the academy's true masters.\"Modest?\" Murong Yunshan kept laughing, \"Okay, let me be honest. I do have some business that I need your help with.\"Shi Zhong got down to business. \"Just lay it out.\"\"I am sure you know the situation of our family. Competition is fierce for the leader position. My son has so many of his own cousins and brothers competing against him that he cannot afford to lose the test tomorrow. He may not have performed well today, but I have to help him prepare better for tomorrow. You know that his talents and power are among the top,\" he continued, \"He is already seventeen, and he is taking the exam after reaching the highest Awakening Plane, the Unmaker. Rumors and criticism will surround the family if he does not ace the test tomorrow.\"Shi Zhong did not seem affected by what he said. He knew that Murong Yunshan was making the plea for his son's sake.\"You know that those who are in this exam have mostly been stuck under the seventh Awakening Plane. Just make sure Murong Qiu performs well enough in the debate tomorrow to beat the others. If he does, I might have some solid reasoning to persuade the panel to name him the champion.\"\"Hua Jieyu is too proud to attend the debate. If she does, she will do so well that she will be the champion and end the rumors anyway. If she does not show up, my son will have his best shot tomorrow. Then it is you who will decide his future.\" Murong Yunshan then tried to bribe him, saying, \"If you need anything in the future for cultivation, and I mean anything, just tell me; I'll take care.\"\"Of course; your business is my business.\" Shi Zhong definitely understood what was going on.\"After Qiu enters your Hall, he's going to need a lot of help from my brother. Cheers! To our friendship!\" Murong Yunshan took his cup and drank. A conspiracy was forming harmoniously inside this room.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 13": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Legend of FutianCH 13Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayQingzhou Academy was home to the largest library collection in all of Qingzhou.After the written exam, Ye Futian returned to his dorm to cultivate. Sometime in the afternoon, he arrived at the academy library alone.He only had access to the first floor of the library. On this floor were books and scrolls containing the most basic of martial art exercises, battle strategies, and simple divination spells. These books were perfect for outer sect disciples in the Awakening Plane.The second floor of the library was only accessible to official disciples and outer sect disciples who ranked during the Spring or Fall Quarter Examinations. It was every sorcerer's dream to be able to view all these powerful spell books. Feng Qingxue was one of those dreamers and therefore it was her goal to be ranked at the Fall Exam.However, the second level of the library was not the reason why Ye Futian was here today. He had begun properly cultivating. Aside from the Freedom Meditation, he had not done any martial art exercises, nor had he practiced any spells. Tomorrow's exam might require him to participate in a battle. If he showed up tomorrow with mediocre fighting skills, it would be a huge embarrassment. He could not let that happen; after all, he had ranked first on the written exam. Many people were waiting for him to make a fool out of himself.The library was split in half, with a martial arts section and a divination arts section. Ye Futian made his way toward the martial arts section.The sixth level of Awakening was a point of division. Before the Invincible Plane, martial and divination art cultivators had essentially trained in the same way. The difference was that one used Worldly Essence to enhance the body in order to break through the different planes and the other used Elemental Spiritual Qi. The planes were all the same until the division of the Invincible Plane.When martial art cultivators were able to understand the artistic conception of the exercises, they could break into the Mystery Plane. Sorcerers, however, had to seek out hidden Elemental Spiritual Qi using their abilities to perceive these energies. They had to create harmony between these new energies and the Spiritual Qi they had previously collected in the Collection Plane. Then, and only then, were sorcerers able to break past the Invincible Plane.Therefore, Qingzhou Academy had a requirement to become an official disciple.\u00a0If you could make it into the Mystery Plane before your eighteenth birthday, you had the advantage of joining the school of your choice. Or if you were like Yu Sheng, capable of cultivating in both martial and divination arts, you could pursue both.Even though there weren't many people in the library, there was the still a fair amount of attention on Ye Futian. His results from the written exam put him in the spotlight but in conjunction with the smile he got from Hua Jieyu, the amount of attention this ex-loser got was through the roof.Rumor had it that he was stuck on the Collection Plane, so why was he here picking out books on martial arts exercises? Everyone was asking themselves this question as they observed Ye Futian quietly.They watched him as he wandered around the library, stopping here and there. It looked like he was trying to find some suitable cultivation exercises for himself.A while later, Ye Futian stopped again. He flipped through the book in his hands with great concentration.The Release of the Dragon Power, studied by warriors, it was an exercise of immense power. The body of the cultivator became like that of a dragon, uncontrollably powerful and fierce.\"The exercise may be harsh, but also powerful.\" Ye Futian was satisfied with what he had found.\"This is it.\" He closed the book and was ready to leave.\"You're going to cultivate the Release of the Dragon Power?\" an observer asked with a face ridden with curiosity.\"Is there a problem with that?\" Ye Futian asked chuckling.\"No problem, it's perfect for you,\" said the observer, trying to hide their laughter.Ye Futian could not be bothered. He turned to leave and a round of laughter and gossip ensued behind him.\"Did he come to the library just to put on a show for us?\" people questioned his true intentions for coming to the library.\"What do you know, the Release of the Dragon Power is so domineering, fit for someone who ranked number 1 on the written test. Oh, how could I forget, that's Ye Futian!\" said another person.\"That's right. First place really is different from the rest of us.\" The mocking comments and laughter came from behind Ye Futian. The Release of the Dragon Power was very well-known amongst the outer sect disciples. Indeed, it was a powerful exercise, but it required the cultivator to mimic the movements of a dragon, how could that be possible? There had been people who tried but none that had succeeded.Since Ye Futian came all the way to the library just to take out the Release of the Dragon Power, it was only right to have a little fun.Ye Futian did not care about what they said. He headed for the divination arts section of the library when he saw two figures headed in his direction, causing him to stop in his tracks.After being scolded by her father, Feng Qingxue was in a sour mood. So, she decided to look around in the library to get her mind off of it. Plus, after the Fall Quarter hunting practice, she had officially stepped into the sixth level of Awakening, the Invincible Plane. She was finally ready to cultivate the divination arts properly, so it would be perfect for her to find something useful at the library. Feng Qingxue had not even thought about the possibility of running into Ye Futian here.Her beautiful eyes shone bright, no longer avoiding Ye Futian. She looked right at him and said, \"Are you here to pick out some exercise books?\"\"Yeah,\" Ye Futian smiled and nodded lightly.Feng Qingxue did not know what to say. The atmosphere had become awkward.\"Feng Qingxue, didn't you want to go look at the spell books?\" Beside her, Murong Qing pulled Feng Qingxue into the divination arts section after glancing at Ye Futian.Ye Futian walked in that direction as well. Seeing him in the same section of the library, Murong Qing furrowed her brows and whispered, \"Feng Qingxue, I don't think he's given up on you.\"Feng Qingxue froze. She then snuck a peek at Ye Futian, only to see him browsing through book labels.\"What a fake.\" Murong Qing could not help but call him out when she saw what Ye Futian was looking at. Even though he ranked first, it was just a written exam. What did he know about actual cultivation?Even if he did cultivate, he should be in the martial arts section.\"Maybe he just wants to get an understanding of the divination arts,\" Feng Qingxue lowered her voice. Ye Futian's performance on the Fall Quarter Written Examinations had truly left an impression on her. To rank first on the written exam required a deep knowledge and understanding of every class in both arts.\"Martial Divination?\" Murong Qing saw the book in Ye Futian's hands. Her sarcastic smile widened and unrelentingly opened her mouth, \"If you're going to be a poser, can you try a little harder? You're not fooling anyone holding that baby book.\"Everyone around heard her words and looked at Ye Futian. Most of them began to laugh when they realized what she said was true. He was, indeed, holding a book which contained the most basic of spells. Martial Divination were spells that you would only use to trick children.Ye Futian closed the book and put it under his arms with the Release of the Dragon Power. He then turned to look at Murong Qing quizzically. \"Do I even know you?\" Ye Futian asked and walked away, not taking a second look at Murong Qing.\"You...\" Murong Qing pointed her finger at Ye Futian's back, not knowing what to say, then she finally mustered, \"Seems like you got quite cocky after ranking first on the written test. You even have the nerve to come to the library and try to look good in front of us while holding a book like Martial Divination. Forget the fact that you're a complete loser; even if you were a proper cultivator, a martial art cultivator like you would never be good enough for Feng Qingxue!\"Feng Qingxue was a sorcerer, as was Murong Qing. Sorcerers all think that they are better than martial art cultivators. After all, in some sense, all sorcerers had the innate ability to cultivate in martial arts. All they had to do was cultivate Elemental Spiritual Qi as they would Worldly Essence, but other than those who were truly gifted in cultivating both arts, no sorcerers would waste their time on martial art development.Ye Futian did not want to be bothered with what she said, but nothing could stop Murong Qing as she went on, \"Besides, you'll be back to where you started after tomorrow. First rank? What a joke. Once a loser, always a loser. I can't wait to see how you'll make a fool out of yourself tomorrow.\"Ye Futian took his two books to be registered then left the library. Inside the library was overtaken by a wave of gossip. People mostly whispered about the two books he had taken out, the Release of the Dragon Power and Martial Divination. How ridiculous was that?Feng Qingxue quietly listened on. She had nothing to say. Even though Ye Futian had smiled at her, she still felt an invisible line separating them. He did as she asked and kept his distance from her but Feng Qingxue did not know why there was discomfort in her heart.......\"The Release of the Dragon Power and Martial Divination,\" Yu Sheng was surprised upon seeing the two books. He looked at Ye Futian. \"Are you cultivating in both arts and starting with martial arts?\"\"Yeah, Mandate Sorcerers are called sorcerers because we're innately gifted with the elements. However, Mandate Sorcerers are also extremely suited for the cultivation of the martial arts. Naturally, I can't put Heaven's gift to waste!\" Ye Futian nodded and continued, \"As for my reason for starting in the martial arts, that's because at my level the sorcery I can cultivate is still not powerful enough. It's all the basics. I can't unleash my full potential as a sorcerer yet.\"\"Then what about Martial Divination?\" Yu Sheng was very curious.\"It's better to be prepared for everything.\" Ye Futian gave him a mysterious smile. \"Besides, cultivation of Martial Divination is super easy, it won't take up much of my time.\"Yu Sheng nodded his head, not having any more questions. Ye Futian spoke again, \"That fox probably has no interest in the debate as usual and will not participate. If she doesn't then I will try to get ranked first in the Fall Quarter Examinations overall.\"\"Okay.\" Yu Sheng nodded, if this was what Ye Futian wanted, then this was what he was going to do. He had already gotten on the List of Brilliance; if he was able to stand out above everyone tomorrow, then he could definitely get first place for the entire exam.\"I'm going to cultivate,\" said Ye Futian. He then made his way to the designated cultivation area and flipped through the Release of the Dragon Power. Looking at the words and diagrams in the book, he closed his eyes. Seconds later, a rumbling noise began. He was surrounded by flashes of lightning, which intensified by the second.The fearful lightning roamed across his body. Ye Futian observed the dragon in his mind as it roared and danced. Its aura was powerful.In his body, the Thunder and Lightning Spiritual Qi slowly shaped itself until it was in the form of a dragon. It looked just like the dragon in his Life Palace, incredibly realistic.Others who had tried to cultivate the Release of the Dragon Power failed to replicate the form of a dragon, but to Ye Futian, this was no problem at all.Using the exercises from the book, the dragon formed by the thunder and lightning charged recklessly throughout his body. It passed through his nerves, organs, limbs, and bones. It was everywhere. Instantly, Ye Futian's face turned bright red, then white. It seemed like he was in great pain. A groan slipped out every now and then.The Release of the Dragon Power was immensely powerful and took a huge toll on one's body. It was all to create the image of a dragon within one's self, allowing your own body to become like that of a dragon.This one session went from day to night. When the sun rose the next day, a figure was dancing in the yard of the dorm. It was Ye Futian. He was still cultivating the tactics in the Release of the Dragon Power, his movements big and powerful. His surroundings were brightened with a curtain of light. Circling his body was a faintly formed dragon, at times it almost looked like a real dragon.A loud roar sounded with a single punch from Ye Futian. It sounded like a dragon had broken free. Another loud noise sounded from a distance away; a wall had collapsed.Someone ran onto the scene. It was Yu Sheng. Upon witnessing the crime scene, his eyes fell on Ye Futian.\"You've achieved the artistic conception of martial arts. You're in the Mystery Plane of martial art cultivation,\" stated Yu Sheng.\"The seventh plane of Awakening.\" Ye Futian smiled. \"Looks like we'll have to get someone to fix that wall. Tell them you broke it while cultivating.\"\"You're throwing me under the bus?\" Yu Sheng stared at him in disbelief.\"Of course!\" Ye Futian laughed and headed back to his room. He was dripping with sweat and needed to shower in preparation for the beginning of today's Fall Quarter Examinations.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 14": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Legend of FutianCH 14Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe morning sun shined on Qingzhou Academy, giving the historic academy a golden glow. Outside the academy, a crowd began forming again. There were even more people today than there had been yesterday.The Fall Quarter Examination was separated into two sections; one day for the written test, and the next day for the debate.The written test examined the students' knowledge learned over the past year, while the debate tested their talents and planes. There would also be combat to evaluate their cultivation status. Although knowledge was essential for cultivators, power would be the primary texting criteria. Therefore, people considered the debate more crucial than the written test.Boom, Boom\u2026 The ground outside the academy suddenly began to shake as a group of knights began approaching.\"Look! The Dark Qilin Knighthood!\" The news quickly made itself through the crowd when everyone saw the knights. The knights were all riding on monsters, Dark Qilins. The monsters' bodies were completely dark, which gave them a very ominous vibe. Rumor had it that the Dark Qilins carried blood from the ancient Qilin, the true lord of the monsters in this world.\"It's General Qin Shuai!\" When people saw the middle-aged general of the knights, they voluntarily cleared the way for the riders with ultimate respect to these knights.The knights were the guardians of the city. People in Qingzhou respected the Knighthood even more than the Lord of the city.\"Did General Qin Shuai come here to see his daughter?\" people asked each other. The fact that General Qin Shuai's daughter was an academy student was not a secret.\"No, he is here to check out the future talents of this city,\" someone said. Others nodded agreement. The young students in the academy would become the pillars of the city in the future, and some would even join the Knighthood. General Qin Shuai had actually once been a student here.After drawing the attention from the crowd outside, the knights entered the academy. Soon, another group of people arrived with a well-decorated coach in the middle.\"The lord of the city is coming.\" Every year, the lord of the city would attend the Fall Quarter Exam in an effort to show how much he valued the school. This year was no exception.\"Looks like today more than half of the big chiefs in the city are coming.\"\"Yep. Today, some of the students will be noticed by them,\" people outside said to one another.Meanwhile, inside the arena, the stands were packed to capacity. There wasn't a single empty seat. Most of the students were here, but many of them could only watch the debate. It was a strict rule at the academy that only those who had qualified on the written test could join the debate. It was designed to signify the importance of knowledge.In the stands, Ye Futian found his father. He looked around and asked, \"My godfather didn't come?\"Ye Baichuan shook his head. \"He isn't here, but he had some words for you.\"\"What are they?\"\"The first thing is that you have to stay calm under any possible circumstance; The second is not to show all your power until you are cornered into desperation,\" Ye Baichuan told him plainly.\"Okay, got it.\" Ye Futian nodded attentively, then looked at Yu Sheng, who was standing next to him. \"Did godfather have any words for Yu Sheng?\"Ye Baichuan smiled at Yu Sheng and said, \"After you become an official in the academy, you do not have to be stuck here and study all the time. We welcome you to come home often.\"\"Sure.\" Ye Futian nodded again, but he seemed a bit disappointed for a second.\"Let's go boys. It's your time to shine today.\" Ye Baichuan laughed and let them go. They left together for the arena. Seeing them leave, Ye Baichuan felt happy that they had finally grown up.Feng Ruhai was also talking with his daughter. \"You made it to the List of Brilliance on the written test, and you have the second highest level of perception over fire-element power. Besides, you are already in the sixth Awakening Plane, the Invincible. Don't be nervous; just fight for yourself.\"\"Okay, Dad.\" She nodded slightly and looked at Ye Futian from far away. As she started walking, she suddenly got a small feeling that Ye Futian was very different than he had always been. She thought some miracle would happen to him today.The Murong family members were also sitting together. Murong Yunshan looked at the host of the debate and told Murong Qiu, \"Few people in this debate have reached the Unmaker plane. If Hua Jieyu does not participate, you have to do your best and beat everyone else. Do you understand?\"\"Yes, Father\" he nodded. He was confident that he would win.There were two hosts for this debate: Leng Qingfeng, the Director of the Hall of Swords at the College of Martial Arts, and Shi Zhong, the Director of the Hall of Earth Element at the College of Sorcery. They walked to the center and glanced around the crowd. Suddenly, Shi Zhong said, \"Those who qualified in the written test will take part in the debate today. I believe you guys know the rules clearly enough. Now, all participants, please enter.\"The students began to enter the arena from various directions.When Hua Jieyu showed up, she automatically drew the attention of the majority of the crowd. She was so gorgeous and talented at the same time. Unfortunately, she always refused to fight in the Fall Quarter Exam. She only took the test on her talent and level, but never joined the combat.\"She had aced three straight years of written tests until her first failure yesterday, and she still refused to join the debate?\"\"I guess she just believed she was too good to be challenged by the others. An incredible honor like the champion of the Fall Quarter Exam seemed to draw little interest from her. What arrogance.\"Then many started to look at Ye Futian. Those who were not official students were expecting him to fail this time, believing he had no way of excaping.Among those people, of course, were Ling Xiao and Yang Xiu. They both looked forward to his failure.Feng Qingxue was standing next to Murong Qing. They also noticed Ye Futian, which made Murong Qing sneer at him. \"Yesterday he was the champion with all the glory, but today he will be the failure again. How hilarious would it be if he got expelled from the academy for being stuck in a low plane even after acing the written test.\"Most people were thinking the same thing Murong Qing was. They believed that even though Ye Futian had aced the written test, he was still useless because he had been stuck in the Collection Plane for three years. For a cultivator, their plane was almost everything.Feng Qingxue remembered seeing Ye Futian at the library yesterday and how she had felt something strange about him. However, she pushed the thought out of her mind.\"Ye Futian, a little bird told me that you went to the library yesterday and checked out two books. One for martial arts, The Release of the Dragon Power, and another one for sorcery, Grand Meteor?\" Ling Xiao said as he walked towards Ye Futian, laughing. In fact, the news of Ye Futian checking out these books had already spread around the academy.\"That's our champion of the written test. His taste is so distinguished.\" Some began to laugh with Ling Xiao. Students in both the College of Martial Arts and the College of Sorcery all sneered when they heard the names of these books. It would be impossible for Ye Futian to learn such profound material. What a fool!\"I would like to experience the power of these two books, but I'm afraid you will have to quit before you use them.\" Ling Xiao was cold because Ye Futian had aced the written test and humiliated him yesterday; but today, Ye Futian would be the one being humiliated.Most of them were looking forward to Ye Futian quitting. How humiliating would it be for the champion of the written test to abandon the debate session; but what if he did not quit? It didn't matter regardless, as he would be defeated and expelled from the academy anyway. This meant that no matter what, this guy who had stolen the thunder yesterday was definitely going to be put to shame today. This ironic contrast would be inevitable.\"Ye Futian,\" someone called him with a cold tone. People looked towards the voice, finding that it was Yang Xiu.Yang Xiu was also ashamed of what had happened yesterday. He was writhing in anger, and was ready to tear Ye Futian to pieces at any moment.\"Today people are going to know that you are nothing more than a daydreaming talker.\" Yang Xiu still sounded bitter about what had happened. In fact, many people were looking at Ye Futian with a combination of jealousy and viciousness.Ye Futian knew how complicated his situation was and involuntarily looked towards the \"fox.\" Almost all the hatred for him had come from the smile she had given him yesterday. In the past, people had only made jokes about him. Now, he was public enemy number one, and it felt as if everyone would spit on him if they had the chance.\"He was the champion of the written test yesterday, Ye Futian. Looks like he has earned all the hatred pointed at him.\" Some people in the stands were also looking at him with slight smiles.\"People say that he has been stuck in the Collection Plane for three years. He is talented, but has bad methodology. He skipped the last three Fall Quarter Exams, but suddenly aced the written test this year. How strange is that?\"\"Yeah, he's good, but he's also in trouble. Other participants are going to kill him.\" People were still talking about how bad things would go for him. The pressure was pretty high.Right in the middle of the stage, there was a Spiritual Qi testing matrix inscribed by the masters. It would accurately test the talents of the participants and their perceptions of Spiritual Qi. The students had already been put through this process before, but because their ability would change with cultivation, it was necessary to retest at the Fall Quarter Exam.A master was standing beside the matrix. He said to the students, \"You know the rules. Time for our first challenger.\"\"I'm ready,\" someone shouted, walking towards the matrix. It was Ling Xiao.He stepped onto the matrix and closed his eyes. Soon, the matrix began to shine brightly with the wind whistling through his body. It was the intense power of wind-element flowing all over Ling Xiao. His shirt was drifting with the wind, which gave the audience a sense of his youthfulness and authority.\"Perception of wind-element at the second highest level and sixth Awakening Plane, the Invincible,\" the master announced, judging his ability. \"Who will you challenge?\"\"Ye Futian!\" Ling Xiao said, looking directly at Ye Futian. He had only volunteered to be first because he wanted to humiliate Ye Futian!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 15": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Legend of FutianCH 15Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayNot even Ling Xiao himself knew why he hated Ye Futian so much. Maybe it was because Ye Futian did not seem to know just how much of a loser he was. He even had the nerve to tease the goddess lecturer, Qin Yi, in class and bickered daily with Feng Qingxue. These were all things that Ling Xiao would never be able to do. In addition, Ye Futian got to sit next to Hua Jieyu during the written exam. She even turned back to smile at him afterward.All of these things added to Ling Xiao's hatred of Ye Futian. Just looking at that handsome and confident face of his was enough to start a fire in Ling Xiao's heart.Perhaps this was jealousy. Ling Xiao was jealous that Ye Futian was confident enough to do all these things he never had the guts to do.The good news was that the shameless bastard was about to crawl back down to where he came from and go back to being a loser. He was also going to be expelled from the academy.Everyone watched with heated eyes as Ye Futian walked to the center of the gymnasium. They anticipated what was to come.Ranked first in the written exams? That meant nothing in the world of cultivators.\"This rascal...\" Qin Yi was speechless looking at Ling Xiao. He was purposely trying to make things difficult for Ye Futian by calling him out first. Ling Xiao was not going to show him any mercy.She tried to hide her worry for Ye Futian. If Ye Futian was too afraid to accept the challenge and forfeited the exam, then being ranked first on the written exam was useless.\"I didn't think anyone was going to make a move for him before I did, but this is good, too. Let's see how he's going to try to keep up his fa\u00e7ade,\" Yang Xiu said coldly.\"Watch closely, Feng Qingxue. You'll realize soon that your decision was correct. That disgraceful loser is not worthy of standing beside you,\" Murong Qing said to Feng Qingxue.Murong Qiu was also looking ahead. He scowled at the sight of Ye Futian, as if he could not have cared less about him. However, it was also because of Ye Futian that Murong Qiu was pushed down from the List of Excellence, where he once belonged, onto the List of Brilliance.The first round of the debate had already stirred up so much tension, but not because of how strong the competitors were; it was because of how \"legendary\" Ye Futian was.Ye Futian walked to the center of the gymnasium step by step, finally stopping in front of Ling Xiao.\"Ye Futian, do you accept the challenge?\" an elder questioned him. Everyone's eyes were frozen on Ye Futian, awaiting his response.A huge smile spread across his face. Under the sun, his youthful face looked exceptionally appealing.\"I accept,\" he replied. A look of surprise immediately spread across the faces of many in the audience, but it quickly turned into amusement. Had he finally realized that there was no escape?\"When I was accepted into the academy, my perception ability was tested to be of the highest level, Sky. I am also about to participate in the debate. I should not have to go through the matrix inspections, then, right?\" Ye Futian asked the elder. If he rejected the debate, he would have to go through inspections, and everyone would know what plane he was in; but, if he accepted the challenge, everyone would find out during the battle anyway.\"That is correct,\" the elder agreed.Out of the blue, Ling Xiao laughed and said while looking at Ye Futian, \"You're about to drop back into reality. How does it feel?\"\"After the written exam, I asked you one thing. What are you going to do if the results turn out differently from how you imagined?\" Ye Futian said, shaking his head at Ling Xiao. \"If you forfeit now, maybe you won't have to experience the shock and humiliation that's to come. Otherwise, with your state of mind, I know you won't be able to withstand it.\"Everyone was stunned. How could Ye Futian say something so absurd at a moment like this? Has he gone completely insane?\"How can you still be pretending when everything is about to end for you?\" Ling Xiao's rage was through the roof. The Wind Spiritual Qi in his body was bursting at the seams. One foot landed on the floor ahead. His body was moving as fast as the wind as ran toward Ye Futian.Ling Xiao was a Wind Element Sorcerer in the Invincible Plane. He was in front of Ye Futian in the blink of an eye. He could have easily used the Spiritual Qi within himself to cast a simple spell on Ye Futian, but he was not worthy enough for Ling Xiao to use sorcery. A simple punch would suffice.\"Look out!\" shouted Qin Yi from afar. She could not help being nervous after seeing Ling Xiao's attack toward Ye Futian. If Ye Futian was really still in the Collection Plane, he would not be able to handle this punch. Ling Xiao was too much.Even though almost everyone in the vicinity disliked Ye Futian, they could not help but feel pity for him. He was about to get seriously hurt by this single attack.Murong Qiu, Murong Qing, and Yang Xiu watched without a worry in the world.It was as if they had been waiting for this to happen.There was a loud boom. An unexpected scene unfolded. Ling Xiao halted, his fist did not land on Ye Futian's body. Instead, it was engulfed by Ye Futian's hand.\"This....\" Everyone's eyes widened and froze on the scene in the middle of the gymnasium. As Ling Xiao's fist had gotten close, Ye Futian had lifted his hand and stopped the powerful punch like it was nothing.Could a complete loser in the Collection Plane do that?Qin Yi, Feng Qingxue, Yang Xiu, Murong Qing, and countless others, all focused on Ye Futian. They were all so surprised and rendered speechless. To easily stop Ling Xiao's punch, Ye Futian had to, at the very least, be in the same plane as him.That would mean that Ye Futian was a martial art cultivator in the Invincible Plane or higher.\"How...is this possible?\" Ling Xiao looked ahead. The only thing he knew was that his fist had been stopped by a powerful force, making it nearly impossible to advance any further.\"I gave you a chance.\" Ye Futian looked at Ling Xiao. Afterward, a strong intent for battle emitted from his entire being.The artistic conception of martial arts. He's in the seventh plane of Awakening, the Mystery Plane. Everyone watching Ye Futian shuddered at the sight of him. The infamous loser of the academy was actually a martial arts cultivator in the Mystery Plane.Furthermore, his gift of martial art perception was of the Sky level and he also ranked first on yesterday's written exam.He was without a doubt, worthy of being called a 'genius' at the academy.How many people have mocked, laughed at, and insulted this genius in the past?\"Gosh, this guy really pisses me off!\" Qin Yi was conflicted. On the one hand, she could not believe he had kept this from her. Thinking about the bet they made in the classroom, her face flushed red with rage. This rascal had always been shameless. What if he came up with an inappropriate request? Was she really going to have to accept it?On the other hand, she felt happy. The boy she had seen at the entrance talent inspections all those years ago was still here; he had not given up on his wonderful gift.However, it was still very puzzling When had he reached this plane?Feng Qingxue was completely dazed by Ye Futian. She suddenly felt a little lost. A loser? She thought back to what her father had said. After hiding his abilities at the academy for three years, he had emerged from his shell despite all the negativity he had received. Ye Futian really was special.Standing beside her, Murong Qing did not look too well. Neither did Yang Xiu. Everyone was completely focused on what was going on. Ye Futian looked at Ling Xiao with the slightest of smiles.\"What do you think?\"Ye Futian was repeating Ling Xiao's words back to him.Ling Xiao broke through the shock and instantly retracted his fist, wanting to back away. Fighting close range with a martial arts cultivator really was a poor choice. He had to widen their distance. He still had a chance.BOOM! Ling Xiao was not expecting an attack. The powerful force from Ye Futian's kick to the chest caused Ling Xiao to propel backward. He landed on the ground far away, groaning, with blood in his mouth. It looked like he was injured pretty badly.Ling Xiao managed to pull himself up. He was as pale as a ghost. He glared fiercely at Ye Futian.\"This is what you've always wanted to do to me. How does it feel to get a taste of your own medicine?\" Ye Futian did not pity him. He had never done anything to Ling Xiao, yet Ling Xiao had always seen him as an enemy. He was constantly looking for ways to insult Ye Futian. Ling Xiao had made it his goal to see Ye Futian be expelled. Plus, the punch he had delivered earlier had showed no mercy for Ye Futian, either.Therefore, just as Ye Futian had said, this was simply to give Ling Xiao a taste of his own medicine.\"I'll get you back for this!\" said Ling Xiao. He stood and walked toward the crowd looking dejected.Everyone was still focused on Ye Futian. So, yesterday's written exam wasn't just a fluke.\"Even if you are in the Mystery Plane, do you have to be that arrogant? Aren't you thinking a little too much of yourself?\" asked Yang Xiu. He stared right at Ye Futian and continued, \"Plus, since you're a martial arts cultivator in the Mystery Plane and I'm a sorcerer in the same plane, this is the perfect chance for us to settle our little dispute from yesterday's written exams. I challenge you to a duel.\"During yesterday's written exam, Ye Futian and Yang Xiu fought over the power of martial arts and sorcery cultivators in the Awakening Place. Ye Futian thought that martial arts cultivators had a higher chance of victory in a battle between the two and even the academy elder agreed. As Yang Xiu brought up, this would be the perfect chance to test out each of their theories.\"Do you accept?\" Yang Xiu asked Ye Futian.Ye Futian took a quick look at Yang Xiu. Calmly, he said, \"You lost to me during the written exam, and you're definitely going to lose to me now. Haven't you been embarrassed enough?\"Isn't this guy being a bit too cocky? Everyone thought Ye Futian was crazy. How could a martial arts cultivator mock a sorcerer like this?\"Do you accept?\" Yang Xiu asked once again.\"Why don't you guys ever listen to what I have to say?\" Ye Futian was a little dispirited by this. He then shrugged his shoulders and said, \"Fine. If you want it so bad, I'll have to comply.\"\"He really is crazy.\" Everyone in Qingzhou Academy was speechless at the Ye Futian's carefree attitude. Even if you were a genius, you still couldn't mock a sorcerer in the same plane! Since when had martial arts cultivators become so arrogant in front of sorcerers?This boy is really asking to get beat. Even the special guests and instructors on the stage were speechless.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 16": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Legend of FutianCH 16Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayYang Xiu slowly walked to the matrix in the center of the stage. All of a sudden, he lit it up. Bright flames with strong fire-element power were raging all around him. He was at the highest level of fire-element perception; the seventh Awakening Plane, the Mystery.It seemed that the surrounding flame aura was binding with Yang Xiu. The Spiritual Qi wrapped around his body, gradually converging on him. People were thrilled by the scene, as the flames turned into fire serpents. They spat out fire in the direction of Ye Futian.Such strong spell power. People were staring at Yang Xiu. For a powerful mage like he was, it would be easy to absorb the elemental power from the universe and combine this power into spells to attack the enemy. In general, the power of spells was stronger than the techniques of a martial arts cultivator.\"Come on, prove yourself. You said the martial arts cultivators could prolong the fight to exhaust a mage and win. Now it's time for you to eat your words; I will make you suffer.\" Yang Xiu's pride was typical of almost all powerful mages.\"Yesterday on the written exam, I remember a professor told you that you need to respect the powers of others to become powerful yourself. I guess you just never learned that lesson,\" Ye Futian said, smiling gently at Yang Xiu. \"What I said yesterday was for general situations. But I do not have to waste my time with you.\"While speaking, Ye Futian stepped forward to Yang Xiu. He began to be surrounded by the power of martial arts warriors; the power seemed to combine into one form.\"He's going to clash head-on?\" People were speechless at what Ye Futian said. This guy was in the Mystery Plane of martial arts, yet he had directly pounced on a mage who already had powerful spells?\"He is going to regret this ridiculous confidence,\" someone sneered.Yang Xiu was also laughing, finding Ye Futian's comments amusing. He pounced on Ye Futian. All the fire snakes converged to create their final form, which appeared to be a giant fire python. This fire python was in such a frenzy that the space around Yang Xiu looked contorted, as the python would engulf everything in its way.Is he insane? Qin Yi realized how terrifying this spell was and looked nervously at Ye Futian. She knew that this spell could be lethal.\"If that's the case, I'll teach you a lesson today,\" Yang Xiu said coldly as he began charging faster. Ye Futian also sped up with all the power surrounding his body. They were approaching the middle of the arena like two thunderbolts.Right at that moment, the power around Ye Futian turned purple. Suddenly, this purple power formed into a new shape. It was a dragon!Ye Futian's body was now cracking with the roaring sounds of a dragon. The crowd was stunned at what was happening right in front of them. The two finally reached each other and struck at the same time. Yang Xiu shouted with rage. The fire python charged right at Ye Futian.With a roaring sound, Ye Futian became the incarnation of a dragon. He stretched out his arms and a purple dragon burst out of them, going straight into the fire python.The thunder dragon and fire python crashed. The python could not handle this dragon power. It soon disappeared, but the thunder dragon still charged until it struck Yang Xiu's body. Yang Xiu was knocked backwards by Ye Futian's power.\"This is a technique of martial arts, Release of the Dragon Power! How could he ever manage to do that?\" All the students were shocked. They knew Ye Futian had checked out the book yesterday, but they had thought it would mean nothing. They didn't believe that Ye Futian could ever learn the techniques, especially in just one day.Now the joke was on them. Those who had sneered at Ye Futian now felt ashamed. Who had said the Release of the Dragon Power was beyond their abilities? Ye Futian proved to them that just because they couldn't do it, didn't mean no one else could.\"The Release of the Dragon Power, in just one day? What kind of joke this is?\" The students still could not accept what was happening.\"The power of thunder is real. Not only is he a warrior, but he is also dominant in the power of thunder.\"At this point most official students and professors were staring at Ye Futian. Ye Futian had combined the power of martial arts techniques and the thunder element. He had successfully fused the power of thunder into his moves as a warrior in the Mystery Plane.\"Why didn't you believe me?\" Ye Futian sighed at Yang Xiu, who looked miserable. He stepped into the matrix, looked around the arena, then began to talk, saying, \"Have I ever told you that I'm not only in the highest level of martial arts power, but that I'm also in the highest level of thunder-element power?\"As soon as he stopped talking, the matrix shined with thunder. Thunderbolts surrounded Ye Futian, making him look like Zeus.People were staring at him in shock. To them, Ye Futian had been a symbol of youth and frivolousness. He had been the joke of the school for three years. Even though he had kept calm and acted like he was not mistreated, deep down, he had felt upset. Now, in the middle of the stage, he had broken the shackles that had been holding him back for three years.Ye Futian was no longer the loser. Now, he was the champion of the written exam, had the highest level of perception in martial arts and thunder-element power, and was in the seventh Awakening Plane, the Mystery.Feng Qingxue could not take her eyes off of him. She seemed gloomy. She finally understood that when Ye Futian had asked her to cultivate, he had only been trying to help her. He knew he could help her cultivation. Ye Futian hadn't been trying to hit on her. But how did she respond? She had let Murong Qing get between them, and told him to keep his distance.All of a sudden, the image of Ye Futian leaving and sighing came into her mind. It gave her a feeling of sorrow. She kept asking herself, Have I really grown up? Will I ever regret my decision? She had been lying to herself.Maybe she had kept a distance from Ye Futian only because she had thought she was out of his league, just as her father had said\"What a punk.\" Murong Qing looked dismal. She was also staring at Ye Futian, refusing to admit that she was wrong. However, these words sounded harsh to Feng Qingxue. She began to remember all the advice Murong Qing had given her, and now doubted why she had believed her unconditionally in the past.While Ye Futian was still in the matrix, he turned around. His eyes were drawn to a beautiful girl.Hua Jieyu noticed Ye Futian was looking at her. She faintly sensed that something was wrong behind that weird smile Ye Futian was giving her.\"Hey Fox, I didn't let you down, did I?\" Ye Futian began to laugh again. His eyes seemed to speak to her. Suddenly, the crowd was silenced again.Fox? What a flirtatious nickname that was. Plus, he had used the phrase \"didn't let you down.\" People began wondering if something was going on between these two, especially when they also remembered that yesterday, after the written exam, Hua Jieyue had sat next to Ye Futian and smiled at him when she had left. She had said, \"I have some expectations for you tomorrow.\" Now people were genuinely petrified. They were thinking, Come on, it can't be how it seems\u2026.Being looked at in that way, Hua Jieyu became speechless, again realizing how shameless Ye Futian was.The way she had spoken to Ye Futian had apparently made him public enemy number one, and now Ye Futian was getting back at her. He was doing it intentionally, of course; how could he stay silent when this girl had tried to set him up.Now almost everyone was looking at Hua Jieyu. They waited to see if she would deny or ignore him.Her eyes glittered. With all the attention on her, she suddenly smiled back at Ye Futian. The smile looked like the most beautiful star on a clear night.\"Yeah, I'm satisfied,\" she said.Her voice was soft and gentle. This, combined with her perfect girlish smile, made the students' hearts melt. At that moment, they were falling in love. However, their hearts were bleeding, because that smile was not for them, but for another boy.Hua Jieyu, the legend and goddess of almost all the students, had never been seen speaking or smiling to someone like this. They felt like Ye Futian was doing something unheard of. Yang Xiu and Murong Qiu had both failed to make her behave like that, yet Ye Futian was able to.Looking at what was happening, Feng Qingxue became even more upset. She now knew that even though she was also a 15-year-old beauty of this academy, she had still been overshadowed by Hua Jieyu.Ye Futian was also enamored by the smile Hua Jieyu gave him, as it was too perfect a smile for Ye Futian to keep his heart defiant. He was so overwhelmed and befuddled.\"Ye Futian, accept my challenge!\"\"How dare you do this to my Goddess! Accept my challenge!\"Angry people were yelling at him from all over the place. It gave Ye Futian chills. Only a few of the participants today were in the eighth or ninth plane of awakening, but all of them were eager to kick his *ss now.You are a bad*ss. Ye Futian said to himself as he looked at Hua Jieyu, still speechless. However, she kept smiling at him with that unique softness. This smile was making the crowd even angrier.\"This is the Fall Quarter Exam, be respectful and silent!\" Ye Futian suddenly yelled at the crowd, turning back around to address them. People were shocked for a moment, then became silent, continuing to stare at him.\"Okay, now, who wants to challenge me?\" Ye Futian began asking.\"I do, I do, and I\u2026.\" Many people rushed to the stage and answered. Ye Futian looked at them, trying to remember their names.Ye Futian began talking again with his hands in his pockets, saying, \"I have fought twice in a row. It's time to rest.\" He then turned around and left the arena.\"What, are you kidding?\" People began swearing at him.\"You can run, but you cannot hide,\" a student in the eighth Awakening Plane started to say.\"Yu Sheng, it's your turn. Take care of them.\" Ye Futian had made the crowd speechless again.Seriously, how could someone be that shameless\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 17": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Legend of FutianCH 17Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWhen Yu Sheng arrived at the center of the gymnasium, the expansive space was once again filled with silence.His fit physique made it easy to forget that he was merely a fifteen-year-old.He walked into the matrix. Almost immediately, a bright golden light shone over his body. The intent of battle and his powerful aura embraced his entire being.His perception of Metal Spiritual Qi was of the Sky level. He was in the eighth plane of Awakening, the Metamorph Plane, for both arts.\"Come here.\" Yu Sheng was pointing at the person who had clamored the loudest. They were now shaking, pale-faced, but he somehow still made his way forward.He was gifted. His perception of Worldly Essence was of the second highest level, Earth Level. He was also in the Metamorph Plane, but he had no confidence standing in front of Yu Sheng.\"Are you ready?\" asked Yu Sheng.\"Yeah...,\" the challenger's voice was shaking. Hearing his response, everyone in the gymnasium became riled up. Yu Sheng took a giant step toward his opponent.\"Let's go!\" yelled the opponent. His jaw was clenched tightly, and he was ready to take on Yu Sheng, but his determination disappeared as soon as he saw the ring of golden light around Yu Sheng. It made Yu Sheng look like the God of War.Boom! Everyone saw the challenger sailing through the air after one attack. Yu Sheng did not use any special battle tactics, nor did he use sorcery. He was able to send his opponent flying using the pure force of his body.\"Next, you,\" ordered Yu Sheng. The person at the other end of his pointed finger was another individual who had wanted to challenge Ye Futian. He was no longer interested in battle though. \"I admit defeat!\" he said in fear.\"You are still required to step into the matrix to show everyone your power ranking even if you forfeit,\" said an elder. They were not impressed by the cowardice of this student, though they were very impressed by Yu Sheng. He was indeed unique.Ye Futian's challengers were not looking too good. Was Yu Sheng really going to fight all of them? If he did, they would have no chance in today's debate portion of the Fall Quarter Examinations.\"Ye Futian.\" The challengers were not too happy with him at the moment. They only stood up because they wanted to challenge him, but now Ye Futian has handed them all off to Yu Sheng. They felt scammed.Ye Futian smiled as he watched the events unfold. His attention shifted to Yu Sheng who was still standing at the center of the gymnasium. He was the true star of this year's Fall Quarter Examinations.Not surprisingly, all of Ye Futian's challengers were picked off by Yu Sheng one by one. None of them stood a chance against him, despite the fact that many of them were in the Metamorph Plane. There were even some in the ninth plane of Awakening, the Unmaker Plane.All of these people could have been official disciples already. They purposely put it off to impress officials at the Fall and Spring Quarter Examinations in hopes that their brilliant performances would make their lives easier as official disciples. Furthermore, rumor had it that the top performing students from the Fall and Spring Quarter Examinations had a chance of being chosen as the disciple of very high ranked academy officials. It was because of this that many people participated in the exams to test their luck.It was such a pity. All of their hard work only made Yu Sheng look better and shine brighter.\"He's not human,\" the people on the observation deck shared with one another.Even General Qin Shuai of the Dark Qilin Knighthood saw Yu Sheng in a different light. This boy was naturally strong. His gifts in martial arts and sorcery were both of the Sky Level. If he became a knight, he would be a force to reckoned with on the battlefield.\"Yu Sheng, that's enough,\" Ye Futian finally spoke. Yu Sheng returned to his original position beside Ye Futian and a lot of people let out a sigh of relief.Now, other people finally had a chance to show off their talents. Many students came forth and put their powers on display. However, no matter how interesting the duels got, nothing possessed the same shock factor as Yu Sheng's previous displays of power.Time passed and it was finally time for Murong Qiu to step up. Things were finally going to get interesting. After he stepped up, Murong Qiu challenged numerous high-level cultivators. When he had defeated all the Unmaker Plane students, he moved down to the Metamorph Plane. He was in the spotlight.He even looked over at Yu Sheng but gave up on the thought of fighting him. It seemed that Murong Qiu had no confidence that he would be able to beat Yu Sheng.Ye Futian recognized the determination in his eyes. Of course, Murong Qiu was also aiming for first place. The only way for him to place first would be to get rid of his biggest obstacle, Yu Sheng. He did not do this, though, because he lacked the confidence.Both Yu Sheng and Murong Qiu are on the List of Brilliance, and both have had excellent performances in today's exam; but in terms of age, Yu Sheng has the upper hand. First place will most likely go to Yu Sheng, Ye Futian thought to himself as he patiently waited for the exam to be over.The sun was setting in the sky, but everyone in the gymnasium was still just as energetic as they had been at the beginning of the day. Hundreds of students did their very best to showcase their abilities and shine above all. Even though Hua Jieyu was not participating in the exams, she still stepped forth into the matrix to have her power ranking determined. Seeing her beautiful face, the hearts of her admirers began to ache. Please don't really be dating that shameless douche!Finally, the debates had come to an end and everyone waited for the closing statements.Eyes diverted to the front of the gymnasium where the academy's elders sat. When Cabinet Master Leng Qingfeng of the House of Swordsmen and Pavilion Lord Shi Zhong of the Earth Pavilion came to an agreement on the results of today's exams, this year's Fall Quarter Examinations would finally be over.Leng Qingfeng and Shi Zhong were in a serious discussion about the results while someone stood beside them and kept a record of what they were saying.An elder beside Shi Zhong took the recorded list and walked to the front of the stage. He looked at all the hopeful students and explained, \"As usual, the results from both the written exam and the debate will be taken into consideration and the outcome will be the overall rankings for the entire Fall Quarter Examinations.\"At the end of the Fall Exams, there would only be one list, the Ranking List. Similar to the written exam, only the top three would be informed of their placement on the list.The top three garnered great glory and honor. In addition, everyone on the Ranking List would have the privilege to access the library's second floor.Everyone waited excitedly for the results. Who were the top three going to be?Ye Futian watched the elder with bright eyes. First place belonged to Yu Sheng.\"In first place, Murong Qiu,\" announced the elder. Ye Futian's gaze froze. He could not comprehend what had just been said.First place? Murong Qiu?Others were just as shocked but the shock dissipated quickly. After all, Murong Qiu was in the ninth plane of Awakening and his performance was quite outstanding as well. However, they still felt that it was a pity for Yu Sheng.\"Second place, Yu Sheng,\" the elder continued with his announcement.\"Why?\" Ye Futian interrupted the elder as he prepared to announce third place.Everyone waited for a response, feeling mixed emotions. The elder, as well as other academy elders, scowled in disapproval. Interrupting the result announcements was extremely disrespectful towards the elders.\"Why is Murong Qiu first and Yu Sheng second?\" Ye Futian wanted to know.\"You're getting out of line here!\" the elder scolded. \"The results have already been decided and they are this way for a reason.\"\"I refuse to accept this,\" said Ye Futian.\"Murong Qiu, seventeen, Earth Elemental Sorcerer, Sky Level, cultivating in the ninth plane of Awakening. Yu Sheng, fifteen, cultivating in both arts, Sky Level for both. In comparison, Yu Sheng is obviously more outstanding. In the written exam they were both on the List of Brilliance and did not receive placement, so I can count that as a tie. However, in today's exam, Yu Sheng defeated cultivators in the ninth plane despite only being in the eighth. No matter how you look at it, Yu Sheng has the upper hand. So, why is Murong Qiu in first place?\" reasoned Ye Futian.He took a step closer to the elders on stage and bowed down. \"Please reevaluate their performances and decide on the results carefully.\"This guy... Qin Yi looked at Ye Futian. Even though, she objected the results as well, how could Ye Futian question the decisions made by the cabinet master and the pavilion lord? He was obviously a smart guy, but why was he acting so dumb now?Outer sect disciples standing in the gymnasium were all watching Ye Futian, and began to whisper about him. Murong Qiu's face frosted over as he glared at Ye Futian.The honorable guests sitting on the stage were all speechless as well. They too felt that it was a pity for Yu Sheng, but they would never have thought that a disciple would stand up to question the results.\"Stop talking! Do you know what you're doing right now?\" asked an elder standing by the matrix. He liked Ye Futian, but it was also because of this, that he could not let him continue his outrageous actions. You may do crazy things in your youth, but you should know your limits.Ye Futian knew exactly what he was doing. He also knew that his actions might not change a thing. His actions were not being made logically right now. He only knew that he had to speak up. If he had been in this situation, he would not have cared; but this was Yu Sheng's honor they were talking about. Why should he let Yu Sheng miss out on first place because of the judges' mistake?The rankings for the Fall Quarter Examinations were based on the grades of both days. Just as he had said before, Yu Sheng did not lose to Murong Qiu in any aspect, so why was he ranked below Murong Qiu?There really was not that much of a difference between first and second place, but to Ye Futian, first place could only be Yu Sheng. Why should it be taken away?I know that what I'm doing may be disrespectful, but I really cannot accept these results. He was set on his decision, and he could not have been more serious. Ye Futian could handle being insulted by the world, but he could not and would not sit by and do nothing as they took what rightfully belonged to Yu Sheng away.\"Ye Futian,\" Yu Sheng called out to him. His hand was on Ye Futian's shoulder as he shook his head, trying to get Ye Futian to forget about it.Ye Futian looked right back at Yu Sheng and he shook his head as well.\"Continue announcing the results and cross his name off the list,\" said Shi Zhong coldly. They had anticipated some disagreements with the final results. However, they also thought that there would not be too much of a problem since Murong Qiu's performance was more than good enough. They never expected that Ye Futian would stand up and question the results in front of everyone.The elder announcing the results nodded. He took a look at the name listed for third place and skipped over it. \"Third place, Hua Jieyu,\" he announced.Even though Hua Jieyu had not participated in the debates, she had ranked second in the written exam, possessed outstanding talents, and was in the Unmaker Plane. No one questioned the decision to give her third place, but everyone had assumed that third place would have gone to the stubborn youth, Ye Futian.\"I still refuse to accept these results,\" Ye Futian repeated himself once again, but his words were ignored as the elder went on to announce the next name on the Ranking List.Then, for the first time ever, a great disturbance interrupted the announcements of the Fall Quarter Examinations' results. Yu Sheng stared at Ye Futian's small frame, clenching his fists tightly. His determined eyes now shone red.BOOM! Yu Sheng took a step forward. No one could diminish Ye Futian's pride, not even Qingzhou Academy.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was Yu Sheng who was stepping forward slowly.\"What is he doing?\" People were looking at Yu Sheng and wondering whether these two young men were going to defy the authority of the academy.The final decision of the Fall Quarter Exam was being announced, and the decision had been made by two masters who were Hall Directors. It definitely could not be easily overridden. How insane was it that they were trying to make the masters change their minds?\"Yu Sheng, get back here.\" Ye Futian could feel Yu Sheng's anger, and somewhat believed he was going to do something horrible. He tried to yell and stop him, but this time it did not work.The List of Excellence was still being announced, but Yu Sheng entered the middle of the arena and interrupted the announcement. Many of the masters looked mad because of the fuss Ye Futian had already made, which had brought shame to the academy. The masters did not hold him responsible only because they thought he was still young, and that it was a mistake. However, Yu Sheng was now right in the middle of the arena, about to make an even bigger one.\"Yu Sheng, back off,\" Leng Qingfeng, the Cabinet Master of the Hall of Swordsmen commanded him. He had planned to list Yu Sheng as the champion of the debate, but Shi Zhong had insisted that Murong Qiu should get first place. He had given in because he had not wanted to make his working relationship with Shi Zhong awkward over such minor issues. But these two young men were just stubborn.\"I want to challenge Murong Qiu,\" Yu Sheng said, staring at Leng Qingfeng.\"How dare you say that. The Fall Quarter Exam is over. There is no way you can change the results, especially in such a rude manner. You better respect the rules of this academy and back off now,\" Shi Zhong yelled at Yu Sheng as he stood up.Yu Sheng looked up to the masters of the academy. There was an aura of fury coming from his body that made the air dense. Ye Futian could feel something dangerous coming from the furious body of Yu Sheng and began yelling at him even louder, \"Yu Sheng, seriously; come back here!\"His godfather had told him that no matter what happened, no one should ever witness the Yu Sheng's true talent.\"No!\" Yu Sheng shrieked horrifyingly. There was now a scary stream of energy around his body. The power formed a dark golden glow that armored Yu Sheng in a suit that almost looked demonic. Some of the masters began to take this seriously. Their gazes sharpened. They were staring right at Yu Sheng and could foresee the looming danger.\"No I'm mad. Come back!\" Ye Futian also sounded truly angry. He was trying to stop the imminent danger by threatening him. Yu Sheng seemed to wake up hearing his voice. His blood-red pupils trembled, and the dark energy around his body was gone. He looked back at Ye Futian.Yu Sheng's father had told him that he should never allow anyone to stomp on Ye Futian's pride. Whenever a violation happened, he was supposed to stand up for Ye Futian with everything he had.\"Hey, big boy, you know what? Just forget about it; time will show that we are right.\" The voice of Ye Futian turned gentle and soft. It was Yu Sheng who had been trying to persuade him before; now, he was trying to talk some sense into Yu Sheng. Even though Yu Sheng was still stubborn, he walked away as he was told. This gesture relieved the tension on the faces of the masters.However, the looks on people's faces in reaction to these two had become even weirder. These guys had a complicated relationship. They looked towards the perfect girl, Hua Jieyu, and began to worry about this girl's future.The masters continued announcing the List of Excellence. Despite expectations, Ye Futian's name did not get called. Surprisingly, some people began feeling upset about this.Before the debate, lots of people had been expecting Ye Futian to make a fool of himself. It had not been personal until it had come to Hua Jieyu, the goddess of their dreams. But no matter what, Ye Futian's talent was top-notch. He should be at least in the top three.Of course, it did not mean that they now felt empathy for Ye Futian. The hatred for him flirting with their goddess was still real and intense. Besides, this guy was so shameless.Ye Futian seemed calm about the fact that that he had not made it onto the List of Excellence. He now felt indifferent about the situation. However, he was doubting whether the masters were acting justly by ranking Yu Sheng as second on the List of Excellence.As for most of the big chiefs of this city, they were still racking their brains about the darkness around Yu Sheng. They could not figure out what it was exactly. They had a feeling that in the future, the boy who had performed so flawlessly on this exam would be renowned all over the city. They believed it was worth it to come watch, just for him.This concluded the Fall Quarter Exam. After Leng Qingfeng and Shi Zhong announced the end of the event, they went into the stands to greet General Qin and the Lord of the City, who had spent their time supporting the event.The disturbance inside the hearts of the students did not end with the event, however. Murong Qiu had Ye Futian in his sights. He looked calm but his heart was cold. He was listed as the champion of the Fall Quarter Exam, but Ye Futian had questioned the decision in public so outrageously that Murong Qiu felt ashamed. Now people actually believed that he was not as good as Yu Sheng. Even worse, he felt angry about Hua Jieyu's reaction. She had never even talked to him, but she had kept smiling at Ye Futian the entire time.Something evil quickly flashed in his eyes, then he walked towards the stands. Feng Qingxue was also looking at Ye Futian. She seemed hesitant about something.\"What did he just do? He was defying the authority of the masters in public!\" Murong Qing said.Feng Qingxue seemed absent from the conversation. She was still looking at Ye Futian. In fact, Ye Futian sensed that he was being watched. He turned his head to look at Feng Qingxue. Feng Qingxue noticed that there was a moment of confusion in his eyes, then he smiled at her, and looked away.There was no grudge in his smile; it was like any regular smile between friends\u2014 natural and peaceful. But it made Feng Qingxue feel even worse. In the past, when Ye Futian had smiled at her, there was a feeling of inappropriateness behind the smile; but not this time. She realized that she had finally gotten the distance she had requested. Friendship was something you lost, and lost forever.After turning away, Feng Qingxue was on the verge of tears. She controlled herself and walked toward her dad.People were leaving in groups. In fact, most of them were still paying attention to Hua Jieyu, and were surprised to notice that she left alone instead of with Ye Futian. This gave them some hope. They tried to convince themselves that nothing special was going on between them.\"Ye Futian!\" A beauty suddenly showed up in front of Ye Futian and stared at him with anger. \"How could you act so stubbornly? You had the chance to be listed in the top three on the List of Excellence and become an official student just like Yu Sheng. You know what? You just ruined that chance.\"Seeing the fuming beauty before him, Ye Futian smiled teasingly. \"You still look so beautiful even when you're angry, Ms. Qin, did you know that?\"\"What, you\u2026\" Qin Yi was dumbfounded. How could he transform so fast from that brave person who had stood up for Yu Sheng to a shameless playboy? Was this really the same person?\"You were in the first plane of awakening for so long. How did you do that?\" Qin Yi asked confusedly.\"Remember our bet? It motivated me so much that I jumped directly over from that low plane.\" Ye Futian looked at Qin Yi and said, \"You do remember your promise, don't you?\"Qin Yi rolled her eyes. As for the promise\u2026 Qin Yi asked, \"Did I make a promise?\"\"Uh\u2026\" It was Ye Futian's turn to be dumbfounded. Looking at this beauty right in front of him, Ye Futian said with humor, \"You told me I can do whatever I want as long as I passed the exam.\"\"Really? Did I? I don't remember that.\" Qin Yi was suspicious about this. Then she turned to a student who was in that class and asked, \"Did I ever make a promise?\"The person was caught off guard, then looked serious and said, \"Nope, definitely not.\"Then he glanced at Ye Futian with a chuckle. This shameless bastard was flirting with Ms. Qin now? No, that was not going to happen.\"You liar\u2026\" Ye Futian realized he was being set up. He then yelled, \"Yu Sheng, come here!\"The student ran away as fast as he could. It had only been a joke. Why was Ye Futian so serious that he would he ask Yu Sheng to beat him up?Ye Futian felt wronged. He looked at Qin Yi. \"Ms. Qin, seriously, you can't do this.\"Qin Yi sounded content and smiled, \"Shameless, of course; that's your style.\"She was surprised at how fun it was to act shamelessly once in a while.Looks like Ms. Qin misunderstood my point. Ye Futian felt bitter. His reckless plan had gone awry.\"What are you guys talking about?\" someone suddenly interrupted. Both of them turned around, and Ye Futian looked respectfully at the newcomer. \"Greetings, General.\"\"Dad?\" Qin Yi said cutely. It was exactly how you would imagine a seventeen-year-old young beauty like her to act. Ye Futian was surprised that the serious Ms. Qin also had this side to her.\"Are you bullying him again?\" Qin Shuai patted the head of his daughter and then nodded at Ye Futian. \"You did well today.\"\"Thank you for the compliment, General.\" Of course Ye Futian knew who he was--everyone in the city knew.\"You are Yu Sheng, right?\" Qin Shuai looked away from Ye Futian. Yu Sheng answered with a nod.\"You are a talented mage, of course, but deep inside you are a natural born warrior. Do not only focus on becoming a mage and ignore your talent as a warrior.\" Qin Shuai sounded serious. He really appreciated this boy because he was one of the most talented warriors he had ever seen. Years from now, this boy would be just as powerful as he was.Yu Sheng nodded again. He understood this naturally.\"You are more than welcome to join the Dark Qilin Knighthood. It will be open to you at any time.\" Qin Shuai was making a serious proposal. Yu Sheng was surprised, as was Ye Futian. He was only fifteen, yet he had been invited by General Qin in person.\"Sure,\" Yu Sheng answered.\"Let's go home.\" Qin Shuai left with Qin Yi. She looked back at Ye Futian and smirked.\"You've changed.\" Ye Futian sighed, feeling upset. She had promised him that he could do anything he wanted!Ye Futian walked to the stands. His father was there talking with someone else. \"It is such a shame that he did not make it onto the List of Excellence.\"\"I know, he is powerful enough,\" the person answered. In fact, Ye Baichuan had said this about a hundred times already.\"Can't be compared to how good I was at that age though,\" Ye Baichuan said.Ye Futian was ashamed. He confronted his father, saying, \"Come on, Dad, that was totally unfair to me. Isn't it time for you to comfort me instead of blame me?\"Ye Baichuan felt confused. \"Does this failure even mean anything to you at all?\"Ye Futian was speechless. \"Just go home. I won't see you off.\"He turned back to the dorm and sighed the entire way about how unlucky he was to have a father like that.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

People dispersed, and the gymnasium returned to its usual emptiness.However, everyone was still shaken up. Ye Futian's performance in this year's exam was too eye-catching. He went from an infamous loser to a genius in martial arts and sorcery. Even more, his gift was of Sky level for both arts; but what had really made everyone jealous was his strange and mysterious relationship with Hua Jieyu. You could say that the entire Fall Quarter Examinations had gone his way, with the exception of his little argument with the elders about Yu Sheng's final ranking.Besides Ye Futian, Yu Sheng also caught everyone off guard. Nobody knew what a monster he could become. All in all, Murong Qiu who was in first place, had nothing on these two.The autumn nights brought about a cooling breeze; it seemed like winter was just around the corner.In the following days, Qingzhou Academy buzzed with the newest information. Murong Qiu and Hua Jieyu were becoming official disciples and had caught the attention of high-level personnel at the academy. The same was true for Yu Sheng. It had been said that a couple of the elders from the School of Martial Arts as well as the Metal Pavilion Lord had fought over him.So many outer sect disciples were jealous of this treatment. As expected, the ones who stood out the most during the Fall Quarter Examinations were being sought after by the best of the best.Other than that, many of the other students on the Ranking List had begun to visit the second floor of the library. They now had unlimited access to some of the most powerful martial art exercise books and spell books.As for Ye Futian, who had been removed from the Ranking List for disrespecting academy elders, he seemed to be in a bit of a slump. Rumor had it that the elders were extremely unhappy with him, and were preparing to punish him.Yu Sheng had stood out during the exams as well, but he was being fought over by the elders. Who would be daring enough to punish him? Besides, all of Yu Sheng's wrongdoings had been attributed to Ye Futian. That guy was really unlucky.However, Ye Futian and Yu Sheng had been cultivating for the past few days and paid no attention to the news.Senior Sister Qin Yi had another lecture today. Ye Futian was prepared to be a good student, so he arrived in her classroom once again.However, as soon as he stepped into the classroom, he received strange stares from his classmates. Ye Futian really had great timing. The final verdict on his punishment had just been announced, and he had come in right on time.Qin Yi also noticed Ye Futian's arrival and stared at him as well. She felt that Ye Futian had been wronged.\"I know I'm good looking, but you guys don't have to stare,\" said Ye Futian. His classmates could not help but roll their eyes. They should have known; once a shameless jerk, always a shameless jerk.Qin Yi took a few steps toward Ye Futian and looked upset when she said, \"Ye Futian, the academy has decided to temporarily ban you from lectures, but don't worry; I'm going to talk to them. I believe they'll lift the ban soon.\"When Qin Yi had found out about this news, she was extremely unhappy. Everyone had seen just how gifted Ye Futian was. Even if he had created a little conflict with the elders, why should he be punished like this? Weren't the Fall Quarter Examinations supposed to be one hundred percent fair?To be honest, Qin Yi had yet to tell Ye Futian the whole story. Not only was the academy banning Ye Futian from the class, but he was also going to be placed on probation, where they were going to keep a close eye on him. This meant that Ye Futian still had a chance of being expelled.It was for this reason that everyone stared. Ye Futian had just proven himself not to be a loser but a top-notch genius in the cultivation of both arts. None of that could help him escape the fate of being kicked out of the academy. What a shame. Maybe this was the price you had to pay to be young and stubborn.It still made no sense though. According to his performance at the Fall Quarter Examinations, he should still be considered one of the best in the academy.The look on Ye Futian's face fell and his expression told the world that he felt wronged.\"Senior Sister,\" his voice was sunken. He walked up to Qin Yi with his head hung low. She could not bear to see him like this. Qin Yi smiled and tried to comfort him, saying, \"Don't worry. Everything's going to be okay.\"Ye Futian gave a quick hum and nodded his head. He then stepped forward and embraced Qin Yi.What is he doing? Everyone around was frozen in shock. What the hell was this *sshole doing? Was he actually hugging her?\"Thank you, Senior Sister,\" Ye Futian said softly, as if he was filled with gratitude.Qin Yi blinked. Something was not right.Hadn't she only mentioned that he was being banned from class? This guy didn't come to class often anyway so why was he having such a strong reaction?She abruptly backed away from him, her face flushed red. Qin Yi was no longer feeling any pity for Ye Futian, she was furious! She seemed to have finally realized his intentions and glared at him hard. \"YE...FU...TIAN!\"\"Senior Sister, I just remembered I have prior commitments. I have to go now!\" His words slurred together because of his quick speech. His feet were moving just as fast. You would not have been able to tell that he was \"upset\" just a second ago.\"Don't let me see you again!\" Qin Yi yelled at his fleeing figure.Some of the male students stood up, finally breaking free from their frozen state.\"He...he\u2026*sshole!\" one of them shouted.Ye Futian had actually embraced their goddess.\"That shameless *sshole! His punishment is too light; the academy should have just expelled him on the spot,\" said another student.\"Yeah! He should be expelled and never be allowed to step foot on academy grounds ever again!\" Everyone was fuming. Their goddess had been taken advantage of!Ye Futian and Yu Sheng were walking around the campus when Yu Sheng asked, \"Did you feel anything?\"\"What are you saying? I just couldn't help myself; Senior Sister is too good to me,\" Ye Futian answered. He gave a Yu Sheng a look of disdain for thinking that he had had impure intentions towards Qin Yi. He was not that type of person.\"Okay,\" Yu Sheng nodded, looking like he understood. Ye Futian could only sigh. Even Yu Sheng had changed.\"I can't believe the academy is really going to punish me,\" said Ye Futian. The dispute he had started during the Fall Quarter Examinations was all for naught. Yu Sheng's first place title had been wrongfully stolen, and now the academy was going to punish Ye Futian for standing up against them. Ye Futian was pissed.Yu Sheng furrowed his eyebrows and gave his thoughts, \"Maybe they're punishing you because the cabinet master and the pavilion lord felt that you damaged their reputations.\"\"I don't care anymore. It's not like they can really kick me out,\" said Ye Futian.\"Who said they can't?\" Someone had spoken up from behind them. Ye Futian halted and turned to look at the speaker. His eyebrows lifted in recognition.It was Murong Qiu. He threw Ye Futian a look of mockery and said, \"You're not actually na\u00efve enough to believe that your gifts will be able to solve all your problems, are you? If it were so, then why is it that Yu Sheng lost his first-place title?\"At the sound of his voice, Ye Futian's eyes shot up. Could it be that Yu Sheng lost his title to Murong Qiu not because of the judges' bias or misjudgment, but because of a conspiracy?\"What you're thinking right now is probably correct. Not only that, the academy's punishment for you is because of me as well.\" Murong Qiu stepped toward Ye Futian and lowered his voice, \"Are you surprised?\"Yu Sheng's knuckles cracked as he clenched his fists. He was fighting a strong urge to fight.\"You want to hit me? Do you have the guts to do it? Idiot.\" Murong Qiu glanced at Yu Sheng. He was looking down on him. Ye Futian's chilling eyes squinted.\"I heard that you are childhood friends with Feng Qingxue. She's very beautiful. Fifteen, a tempting age, a budding flower,\" Murong Qiu continued. Yu Sheng took a step forward.\"Yu Sheng!\" Ye Futian called out. The ice in his gaze disappeared and then he smiled.Murong Qiu's words were getting even more unbearable now. He only had one goal, to trigger Ye Futian.If Ye Futian and Yu Sheng actually made a move on him, Murong Qiu might not even defend himself. Then the academy would have one more reason to legitimize their punishment for Ye Futian.\"Murong Qiu, I'll remember this,\" said Ye Futian with a smile. He then turned to leave. \"Let's go, Yu Sheng.\"Yu Sheng glared at Murong Qiu one last time, then walked away to follow behind Ye Futian. Murong Qiu was surprised. He was watching the two of them leave when his demeanor cooled. Weren't they super arrogant during the exams, why were they acting so cowardly now?\"Why didn't you let me make a move on him?\" Yu Sheng was very angry.\"And then have me take the blame for it?\" asked Ye Futian. After what happened during the Fall Quarter Examinations, Murong Qiu had his sights set on Ye Futian.\"You can head back without me. I have business to attend to,\" Ye Futian said out of the blue.\"Where are you going?\" asked Yu Sheng.\"The fox's den.\" Ye Futian turned away and left Yu Sheng standing there staring at his back. Yu Sheng muttered under his breath, \"Meeting the parents already?\"It seemed like they hadn't even known each other for a month, weren't they moving a little too fast? Yu Sheng could not understand, so he shook his head and began to make his way back home alone.Hua Jieyu's place was in a very nice area within Qingzhou Academy. It was a large private residence, separated from other buildings.\u00a0Ye Futian was not surprised. That day on Mount Tianyao, even the academy elders had to pay respects to the middle-aged man. It was easy to tell that he must have been highly ranked within the academy. Besides that, Hua Jieyu has always been a person of high status and mystery in Qingzhou Academy.Outside the residence, Ye Futian saw a young man. The young man saw Ye Futian as well and couldn't help but be confused. \"Ye Futian?\"\"Senior Brother,\" greeted Ye Futian. He vaguely recalled seeing this young man before. He had been sitting by the elders during the Fall Quarter Examinations. He must have been an official disciple.\"What are you doing here?\" asked the young man. How could Ye Futian have found his way here?\"I came to look for my master,\" said Ye Futian.\"Your master?\" the young man asked Ye Futian. \"Who is your master?\"\"Not too sure, but he lives here,\" answered Ye Futian as he pointed to the residence.\"Senior Hua?\" the young man asked weakly.\"Yeah...\" Ye Futian was a bit embarrassed. He did not even know his master's family name. Then he thought about the master's relationship to Hua Jieyu and what the young man said seemed to be correct, so he nodded in agreement.The young man thought of Ye Futian and Hua Jieyu's interactions during the Fall Quarter Examinations and immediately understood the situation. He grabbed his chest in pain. Then, he turned and walked away bleakly.The young man also thought of the academy's punishment for Ye Futian. There were even some people who wanted to facilitate his expulsion from the academy. The world sure was a messy place. Who would dare to expel Senior Hua's disciple? The Pavilion Lord of the Earth Pavilion?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 20": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Legend of FutianCH 20Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayYe Futian stepped into his professor's home. He heard someone playing a delightfully moving melody on the guqin. There was a unique softness in the sound, which indicated that the player might be a woman.However, Ye Futian was surprised to find that it was Hua Jieyu's father who was playing the guqin in the pavilion. He looked gentle and peaceful with the instrument. Seeing that face, Ye Futian truly understood why his daughter was such a beauty. His master's handsomeness was almost comparable to his own...Ye Futian stepped gently into the pavilion, trying not to make any noise. However, the sound stopped gradually, the musician apparently noticing his approach. The master looked at Ye Futian and smiled. \"You're here.\"\"Greetings, Professor Hua.\" Ye Futian bowed to him.\"Come grab a seat,\" Mr. Hua told him. Ye Futian walked forward and sat down, facing the master.\"How much do you know about spell scrolls?\"\"A spell scroll is a scroll with a certain spell inscribed on it. Only mages that are extremely talented in power perception can manage to do that, hence why they are called scroll inscribers,\" Ye Futian said, \"The Spirit and Qi that a mage is able to release in a fight is limited, and sometimes the mage has to release the power really fast. In that case, the power of his spell is proportional to his plane. However, in a non-battle status, a mage can actually take a lot more time to inscribe more powerful spells on a scroll so that he can release the power instantly during a fight.\"\"You are correct. If you are a good enough scroll inscriber, the spell inscribed can be much more powerful than those you can use during a fight. Therefore, the scroll inscribers can sometimes surprise their enemies with spells way beyond their ability range. In fact, people seldom want to fight against a good scroll inscriber,\" Mr. Hua continued.\"There are more benefits to being a good scroll inscriber. Inscribers are generally very wealthy because the scrolls of good quality are expensive. In addition, the status of this profession is very high.\"\"I know.\" Ye Futian smiled.\"This profession is very talent-oriented. Mages with normal ability can never become scroll inscribers. You do, however, have this talent within you.\" He looked at Ye Futian, stood up, and began exiting. \"This way.\"Ye Futian followed him to a small library. Even though it was a tiny space, there were thousands of books stored inside. He pointed to a shelf and told Ye Futian, \"Browse the books on that shelf. They are the introductions to spell scrolls.\"\"Sure,\" Ye Futian nodded without asking any questions. The master was pretty satisfied with this reaction. He left Ye Futian alone to read.He roughly scanned the books, then chose one of them to start reading seriously. He understood that the foundation of a knowledge system was critical, and that no matter how talented he was, the basics were still necessary. In fact, he was well-influenced by his godfather, and he thoroughly understood the importance of fundamentals. He was extremely focused on the materials.Unknowingly, dusk had already arrived. Hua Jieyu came in from outside and greeted her dad.The man smiled at her and asked, \"How was your performance today.\"\"I took down three level nine demons,\" Hua Jieyu smiled back at him.\"Nice job.\" He nodded and told her, \"Go prepare some pens and scrolls for scroll inscribing.\"\"Another practice session?\" Hua Jieyu was confused.\"It's not for you. It's for Futian,\" he smiled again.Something flashed through her eyes when she heard that name. That guy had come? He was so...driven!When Ye Futian came out, he saw Hua Jieyu preparing the desk for him. She was tall and slim, with an elegant aura that could not belong to someone her age. Her mother must also be a pretty woman. What a pity that Ye Futian had never seen her.Ye Futian sneaked towards her and smiled. \"What a virtuous woman I'm looking at.\"Hua Jieyu stiffened. Virtuous? Was he kidding?\"This is my house; mind your language.\" Hua Jieyu looked back and smiled at Ye Futian. The smile was breathtaking, but Ye Futian was could not enjoy it anymore. He knew how calculative and cunning this fox could be.\"Futian, are you done reading?\" The master came out of his room with a book in his hand.\"Yep, I'm done,\" Ye Futian slightly nodded.\"Okay, so which plane are you in now for sorcery?\" he asked\"The sixth Awakening Plane, the Invincible.\"\"Have you ever practiced any spells?\"\"No.\" Ye Futian thought something like The Grand Meteor was not the answer he was looking for.\"That's good for you.\" The master seemed quite satisfied, which made Ye Futian really curious. Never practicing spells before was a good thing?\"There are major differences between the inscribed spells and the spells you directly cast during a fight. In fact, a lack of experience makes you better at perceiving these differences,\" Mr. Hua explained to Ye Futian as he gave him a book. \"This will teach you some inscribing methods of basic spells. Let's start with the first one.\"Ye Futian nodded and took the book. The first spell was Thunder Blast, a spell for a basic level of awakening. It induced a thunderstorm used to attack the opponent.\"I'm done,\" he said as he closed the book.\"Now, try to inscribe,\" the master nodded. Ye Futian picked up the pen, looking really serious about this first try. Suddenly, he was surrounded by the power of thunder flowing from his body to his hand, which finally converged on the end of his pen. At the same time, it looked like the thunder power was being engraved on the scroll. Ye Futian began using the pen slowly and thoughtfully. However, a thunderbolt suddenly cracked, and all the power diffused immediately.\"I failed.\" Ye Futian was kind of disappointed.\"It's okay. Keep going, try another one,\" the master told him. Ye Futian picked up a new scroll, feeling sad. He was wasting something very costly.His second attempt was a failure, as was his third attempt, and so on with his ninth effort. He still could not do it, but every time he made some progress by hanging on for longer period of time.\"Jieyu, show him, please,\" the master asked his daughter. She nodded, and her hands reached out for the pen that Ye Futian was holding. Ye Futian was stunned for a moment, then gave her the pen.Hua Jieyu took a scroll and began inscribing. The power of thunder was all over her body.Wow, that thunder-element talent of hers is amazing. Ye Futian was awed by this. He had seen her incredible metal- and wind-element talent on Mount Tianyao\u2026 This fox was just as multi-talented as he was.She looked focused while she was inscribing, yet somehow still seemed to be at ease. Her entire body was glowing with not only the power, but also her unique beauty from concentrating. She finished the scroll soon, then smiled at Ye Futian. Ye Futian smiled back but felt awkward.\"Okay now, take your time,\" the master told him. He then left the pavilion with his daughter. He was leaving intentionally so Ye Futian could focus.\"Sure,\" Ye Futian answered. He began genuinely focusing on the inscribing. Even though he continued to fail, he did make some progress after every failure.Dusk settled over the academy. Mr. Hua sat on the couch and asked his daughter, \"How long did it take for you to make your first scroll?\"\"A day,\" she answered.\"He will make it soon, even without my instruction,\" Mr. Hua told her, \"In fact, he is the most powerful mage I have ever seen in perceiving and controlling Spiritual Qi in the Awakening Plane. He is even better than you.\"Hua Jieyu stared at the boy. Suddenly, a shining thunderbolt burst out, the storm striking the pavilion directly.\"I made it!\" Ye Futian was so excited. Hua Jieyu winced. She could not believe that he had made his first success this fast.\"He used the scroll right after making it. What a waste.\" Mr. Hua felt a little sad, but he kept smiling at Ye Futian. He had not expected to have someone as talented as Ye Futian in this city. This boy was a mage of all-elemental talent, and a natural born scroll inscriber. This meant that he would be an all-elemental scroll inscriber, which was pretty rare.\"I made it!\" Ye Futian ran to the master. He was so excited that he had not only successfully inscribed a spell, but that he had learned it as well.\"Nice job. You have a lot more to work on. In fact, you need to be able to inscribe all the spells in that book.\" The master knew why he was so excited; no matter how talented he was, he was still a fifteen-year-old, an age meant for being simple and naive.\" Okay,\" Ye Futian nodded.\"It's already night. Are you\u2026?\" Hua Jieyu smiled at Ye Futian, implicitly telling their guest that it was time to leave.\"Ah, time flew by so fast.\" Ye Futian looked to the sky, then continued, \"It's too dark and dangerous outside. Do you have a spare room here Mr. Hua? Is it okay if I stay for tonight?\"\"What\u2026?\" Hua Jieyu was caught off guard. Dark and dangerous? What lame excuses. Ye Futian ignored her, looking to his master with expectancy.\"Okay, then stay. Jieyu, go prepare the guest room for Ye Futian,\" Mr. Hua smiled.\"Uh...\" Hua Jieyu blinked. Why was she being asked to prepare the room for this shameless guy? Ye Futian looked at her with a grin. His gaze was full of anticipation. In his eyes, a fox was making a bed for him. What a dream.\"Nope,\" Hua Jieyu refused after she saw the expression on Ye Futian's face.\"Jieyu, mind your manners,\" her dad told her. She stood up, feeling wronged, then reluctantly went to the room.\"I'll go help her, professor.\" Ye Futian followed her to the room. Soon, it began to sound like they were bickering. Mr. Hua looked to the sky full of shiny stars and showed a smile of nostalgia. We used to be such a beautiful age.Ye Futian had refused to go back to his dorm after his stay. Hua Jieyu believed that her father had just invited a wolf into their house.Time passed by, and Ye Futian was able to inscribe even more spells. Some of them were actually of the seventh Awakening Plane.One day, Ye Futian was working alone in the pavilion. All of a sudden, he felt something vague and intriguing going on in his mind. Later, he found that his body had resonated with the Spiritual Qi of the universe. The power was all over his body; the feeling was so different from the mere act of collecting.Okay, now I am in the seventh Awakening Plane, the Mystery. He smiled. During the inscribing these days, he was making progress on the perception and control of elemental power. In fact, the inscribing was also a form of cultivating!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His days passed by comfortably and carelessly. Other than inscribing scrolls daily, he treated himself to the eye candy that was Hua Jieyu. He had been so happy that Yu Sheng was almost the last thing on his mind. Two months passed and he had only gone back to their dorm to visit Yu Sheng twice. This had Yu Sheng's imagination running wild as to what Ye Futian could be doing at the Hua residence.The academy's ban on Ye Futian was still in place. When everyone was looking forward to Ye Futian's reaction, he completely vanished from their sights. His disappearance had everyone thinking if he would have come to class if there had not been a ban. Maybe if it was Senior Sister Qin Yi's lecture.Without any warning, the first snow arrived. The snow was coming down hard, covering everything in a blanket of white overnight.In the morning, Ye Futian stepped out of his room. He looked up at the sky, full of snow flurries, and rubbed his hands together. A hot breath escaped as he smiled.The pavilion up ahead looked lonely, standing alone in the white, while everything around it was completely hidden by the snow. One figure stood out in the midst of it all. She seemed to have lost herself in the beautiful view. The snow was too beautiful.Ye Futian picked up his feet and headed towards her. Another set of footprints appeared in the snow on the ground.Standing next to the young woman, Ye Futian snuck a glance at her, but it seemed she had not taken notice of him. Her eyes were closed as she enjoyed the serenity.Ye Futian closed his eyes as well and continued to stand beside her quietly. The white snow fell nonstop until the both of them were covered in a layer of it.\"What are you doing?\" Hua Jieyu had opened her eyes and smiled at Ye Futian when she saw that he was mimicking her.Ye Futian opened his eyes and looked at Hua Jieyu tenderly. Smiling, he replied, \"Accompanying you until our hairs turn white.\"Hua Jieyu blinked speechlessly. She then looked at Ye Futian's head, covered in the white snow. Her heart twinged with disappointment. She could never take his words too seriously.\"It's already been two months, you don't really think this is your home now, do you?\" Hua Jieyu teased Ye Futian.\"Master is more than just my teacher; he has become like a father to me. So his home would be like home to me,\" Ye Futian said. He sounded quite serious.\"You two little rascals,\" a voice said, causing the two to turn their heads. They saw a handsome figure smiling at them, and heard him say, \"Flirting so early in the morning, you guys really don't think of me at all.\"Ye Futian sighed to himself. Master knew him too well.\"Father,\" Hua Jieyu called out, feeling wronged. She stared at her father. \"Am I really your child?\"He always took Ye Futian's side. What kind of father did that?\"Who else but I could have birthed the most beautiful daughter in all of Qingzhou City?\" the middle-aged man replied in a joking manner. Hua Jieyu looked at her father. In a mere two months, her father's tone and manner of speech had already adopted that of Ye Futian's. This was just...\"You really are a master.\" Ye Futian was impressed. Master was on a completely different level than he was in every aspect.After spending so much time together, Ye Futian had finally found out his master's name, Hua Fengliu.Even his name was impressive. He could not even hope to compete with Master.\"Ye Futian, over the past days your cultivation in scroll inscribing has become so well-developed that you no longer need guidance. As your power level increases, you will naturally be able to inscribe more powerful scrolls,\" said Hua Fengliu. He eyed Ye Futian unwaveringly. Even though Ye Futian was only in the Mystery Plane for sorcery cultivation, he was able to inscribe some of the highest-level Awakening Plane scrolls in the short span of two months.\"It's all thanks to your guidance, Master.\" Ye Futian bowed with gratitude.Hua Fengliu waved his hand in denial. \"You are naturally talented. You would have yielded the same results even with a different teacher. However, you must remember, you cannot be overly prideful. The outside world is far more complicated than you can imagine. Your journey has only just begun. You can come to me for help when you have any questions, not just for inscribing, but for anything about cultivation as well.\"I shall keep Master's words at heart.\" Ye Futian nodded in response.\"Alright, go on now,\" said Hua Fengliu.Ye Futian nodded again before dropping down to both knees and gave Hua Fengliu three deep bows. His forehead came into contact with the cold ground.\"I have been under your guidance for months now and have not yet paid my respects to you properly. Even though I like to joke around, I was serious when I said that you are like a father to me. I will always keep Master's words in mind,\" said Ye Futian.When he was done, Ye Futian stood up slowly and said, \"I shall be on my way now.\"He then turned towards Hua Jieyu for a farewell, \"Bye Fox, don't miss me too much.\"He walked out of the residence before she could reply.\"That rascal, it's going to take some time to get used to things without him here,\" Hua Fengliu laughed as he shook his head.\"Why do you like him so much?\" Hua Jieyu could not understand her father. She could feel that her father genuinely liked Ye Futian, but why? Was it just because of his gift?\"Initially, it was because of his gift, but after hearing your stories about him and what happened during the Fall Quarter Examinations, I realized that under his playful demeanor was a pure heart. After receiving three years worth of insults, any normal person would have been resentful, but he remained cheerful and bright, like the sun. Furthermore, he was willing to stand up to the academy just for Yu Sheng's placement, it is easy to determine that he is an extremely loyal person,\" explained Hua Fengliu. \"After these past two months with him, I'm starting to like his personality more and more.\"\"So, you would sell-out your own daughter?\" Hua Jieyu rolled her eyes at her father. She said, \"Even if he does have all those good qualities, you can't deny that he's a shameless pervert.\"\"Don't you think his little antics are cute?\" laughed Hua Fengliu.Hua Jieyu did not know what to say. Her world was in a messy situation. Her respected father had fallen under a certain person's spell.The snow continued to fall until the entirety of Qingzhou Academy was covered in white, adding beauty to this sacred place. However, the students of Qingzhou Academy were not interested in the beautiful sight. Early in the morning, a group of powerful individuals arrived at the academy. When they arrived, all the instructors of Qingzhou Academy prepared for combat, calling upon the most powerful people at the academy. Leaders of the martial arts and sorcery schools readied themselves. The atmosphere across campus was very tense.Many outer sect disciples did not understand the situation, but the older official disciples knew exactly where this group of people had come from, and their purpose for coming. They knew that their prestigious academy was about to fall victim to some serious provocation.All of Qingzhou Academy was a mess. Disciples rushed toward the same direction in a frenzy.Ye Futian witnessed this sight and found it weird, not knowing what had happened. It seemed like something big was about to take place at the academy.\"Ye Futian!\" Ye Futian heard someone call his name before he could reach his dorm. Shifting his gaze in the direction of the voice, he saw a beautiful face and a soft smile spread across his own face.\"Where are you going?\" asked Feng Qingxue.\"Going back to look for Yu Sheng,\" answered Ye Futian.\"The academy is gathering all the students, Yu Sheng should also be there,\" said Feng Qingxue. Something flashed in Ye Futian's eyes as if he had just had a thought.Feng Qingxue pulled at her sleeve. She looked nervous. She asked, \"Why don't we go check it out...together?\"Ye Futian stared blankly at the beautiful girl in front of him. The snow was falling on her body. She looked a little nervous and unsettled.\"Sure,\" Ye Futian nodded with a smile.\"Okay.\" Feng Qingxue took the initiative to stand beside him, and the two of them headed towards the crowd.Ye Futian was not joking or teasing her like he had used to, but Feng Qingxue knew that things could never go back to the way they were before. Of course, she would have liked everything to be as it had been in the past. However, she had matured, and understood that things did not always go the way you wanted. Despite knowing what had been lost was gone for good, she still did not want to be complete strangers.\"I'm sorry,\" said Feng Qingxue suddenly. Ye Futian stared at her blankly once again. He could see that she was trying to be as courageous as she could. She looked at him and smiled. \"Ye Futian, I'm sorry.\"Her eyes were getting red. These days, she had been thinking a lot about what her father had said, and she knew that her actions had hurt his pride.\"I have forgotten about it already,\" replied Ye Futian. He understood perfectly why she was apologizing.\"There's nothing going on between Murong Qiu and I. He came to look for me after the incident, but I ignored him, and I haven't gone near him since.\" Feng Qingxue tried to explain herself, even though she knew it wouldn't make a difference; but it was best to make some things clear.\"That's all in the past now,\" Ye Futian replied. \"Oh yeah, what's going on at the academy?\"Feng Qingxue could tell that Ye Futian was trying to change the subject and felt slightly disappointed. She replied to his question anyway, \"I heard that aces from the City of Heiyan led the people of Heiyan Academy here.\"\"The City of Heiyan,\" muttered Ye Futian as his expression darkened. Heiyan and Qingzhou were both cities of East Sea Island. To Ye Futian, who grew up reading history books, history was something he knew quite a lot about. Before Emperor Ye Qing and Donghuang the Gret united the world three hundred years ago, there was an age of separatism led on by the nobility. During this complicated period, it was very common for cultivators to loot resources. At the time, the City of Heiyan was controlled by the Heiyan Clan. This clan was very aggressive, and repeatedly invaded the other cities of the East Sea Island for resources.After the world had been united, Emperor Ye Qing and Donghuang the great set up new laws, and the world became much more peaceful. However, they still lacked control of the East Sea Island cities. The Heiyan Clan became Heiyan Academy, and took complete control of the city. All these years had passed, and they had still not given up on the invasion of Qingzhou City.With this background, Heiyan Academy and Qingzhou Academy were natural enemies. Every couple of years, they would lead a group of their most powerful individuals to provoke Qingzhou Academy, as well as to test the power of its students.\"Looks like Heiyan City is getting overly ambitious once again,\" said Ye Futian. The peace in Qingzhou was about to be disrupted. However, this matter did not involve Ye Futian, since the city had its own special protectors, the Dark Qilin Knighthood.But Qingzhou Academy was still in trouble!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In fact, some of the big chiefs had also heard about the situation, and were arriving as well.They just blocked the entrance to the lecture area. Ye Futian was shocked by how rude these people from Heiyan Academy were.The fact that Ye Futian and Feng Qingxue had showed up together surprised a lot of people. Just two months ago, there were rumors this bastard had hugged Qin Yi; now he was hanging around Feng Qingxue. They believed that the academy should absolutely expel him, but not now, as they were facing an imminent external threat.They knew why the Heiyan Academy students were here. The intruders had terrible intentions to stir up some trouble.\"The directors of the halls are here.\" People made way for the group of big chiefs to let them through. They were from the College of Martial Arts and the College of Sorcery. They looked very serious about the group from Heiyan Academy. They knew these troublemakers had been planning to come to this place days ago when they had first arrived in the city.It was snowing heavily now. People were cold, not only from the snow, but from the danger being posed by the intruders.\"This is the sacred lecture hall of Qingzhou Academy. You have come a long way to be here, so why don't we pick a quiet space to have a word?\" a director said to the Heiyan group.\"No need for that. This is going to be quick. Just say what you need to here.\" The leader of the Heiyan group had dark skin, and his face was chiseled. His eyes looked exactly like those of an eagle. He was insulting Qingzhou Academy with the way he spoke. He did not need to be polite, as they were only here to show off their power.\"Bring it on.\" Leng Qingfeng, the Director of the Hall of the Sword, understood what was happening. He wanted to get down to business.\"It's been years since the last time we came here. Over the years, many young students in our academy have shown their talents. They are always trying to get some new experiences with people from other places. Therefore, I have brought them here to be challenged by your young talents, who have been nurtured in this sacred place,\" the Heiyan leader said in a cold voice. He then looked back to the young students standing behind him. \"You asked for a challenge. Now, come here and accept the challenges.\"All the young students looked to be under eighteen, and the youngest of them looked about thirteen. However, they were staring at the students of Qingzhou Academy with disdain.Bastard. The students of Qingzhou Academy were pissed off. They clenched their fists, looking forward to teaching these intruders a lesson.A boy stepped forward from the Heiyan group. He appeared to be around sixteen-years-old, and was tall and slim. In fact, he looked like a student from a regular academic school, not a kung fu academy.\"Mu Jiang, from the Heiyan Academy, in the ninth Awakening Plane, the Unmaker, will accept any challenge.\" He spoke politely. However, he was so calm that it appeared he was actually very proud, and that he did not take any possible challenges seriously.A student stepped forward from the Qingzhou Academy group.\"Qiu Yan, the Unmaker Plane,\" he began introducing himself, also peacefully. He had been outstanding in the Spring Quarter Exam this year and had become official. He had always been a powerful and famous mage at this academy.\"Bring it on,\" Mu Jiang nodded to accept. Qiu Yan suddenly started charging. He was fast, to tsay the least. The power of martial arts was all around his body, but there was a faint flame bursting out. Apparently, he had double cultivation in martial arts and sorcery, and sorcery was the major.Mu Jiang seemed indifferent. He just stood still and waited.The masters of Qingzhou Academy saw the danger coming. Mu Jiang was calm, to the point where he seemed to prepared for the attack.Qiu Yan was approaching his opponent fast. The fire-element power around him became frenzied, and turned into lotuses. The lotuses burned the air with a sizzling sound. Suddenly, the snow from the ground gathered around the body of Mu Jiang. His body was covered with snow, looking almost as if he was frozen.The attack from Qiu Yan landed. The flaming lotuses suddenly burst into an ocean of fire, engulfing Mu Jiang's body completely. This made the students of Qingzhou Academy really excited, as such a powerful attack from a mage of the highest Awakening Plane could destroy anyone who dared to take them without evading.However, the excitement ended in seconds. A freezing breath permeated through the flames and drove them away from Mu Jiang. Soon after, people found that Qiu Yan's hands were frozen, and that the ice was traveling up his body.\"What the\u2026.\"\"He's frozen.\" People in Qingzhou Academy soon realized that Mu Jiang was a water-element mage. He countered Qiu Yan's element..Qiu Yan was now trembling with frostbite. Half of his body was already frozen, and the other half was soon to be as well. In fact, he could be entirely encased in ice in seconds.\"Stop!\" a master of Qingzhou Academy yelled. Mu Jiang listened to the command and stopped. He reached his hand out to pat the head of Qiu Yan. Qiu Yan fell to the ground, entirely immobilized.People from the Qingzhou group soon took him to the medical room. His life had been endangered by the frostbite already.\"He just attacked without a backup plan, not even knowing the elemental attributes of his opponent. Is that what your masters teach you to do, losers?\" Mu Jiang was still peaceful and arrogant. He returned back to the group once he finished speaking. People in Qingzhou Academy were chilled by his power, as they seldom saw a mage that was able to freeze another mage at only the Awakening Plane level.Once Mu Jiang was back in his group, another young man stepped forward. His eyes were as sharp as the sword on his back. He was apparently a powerful swordsman.\"Eighth Awakening Plane,\" he began saying. He was too lazy to say his name; he was more arrogant than Mu Jiang.\"I'll accept the challenge,\" someone responded.\"Wow, it's senior Li Qingshan.\" People held high expectations for the responder. Li Qingshan had ranked third on the List of Excellence for the Spring Quarter Exam this year. He was now cultivating in the Hall of the Sword.\"I'll take you down with only three strikes,\" the young man from Heiyan Academy bragged.What a presumptuous bastard. Li Qingshan was angry.\"Please.\" Li Qingshan unsheathed his sword; it whistled through the air.The power of the sword was a specific martial arts power, and a great one at that. The Spiritual Qi in the universe was condensed into the sword to attack the enemy. This power was not less than the element power of a mage; the attack from a swordsman would be terrifying.Li Qingshan had learned his lesson from Qiu Yan. He remained cautious and still. However, the young man began to laugh. He said, \"So obedient.\"Right after he spoke, he charged towards Li Qingshan. He was almost as fast as the wind, so fast that the snow covering the ground was disturbed by his speed.\"Be careful, he's a wind-element mage.\" The Qingzhou Academy group was shocked; a wind-element mage with sword cultivation would be dangerous.Li Qingshan looked serious about this attack. He was anticipating the attack, and countered it in a moment with a lightning-fast strike. His enemy was faster, however. The sword took a curve around his body with the wind-element power, so fast that Li Qingshan could not even detect its direction.Li Qingshan's sword began shaking to condense its power. Soon, Li Qingshan took his first strike at his enemy. However, his opponent dodged the attack quickly, sidestepping the blade.\"Senior!\" People were really nervous about the situation on the battlefield, as the combat between the two swordsmen could be life-threatening to both of them.Li Qingshan directed the power of the sword to his left palm and used its power to block the attack from his side. His enemy used the same tactic again, and rushed behind him for a strike he could never anticipate. The sword was swung, and Li Qingshan fell down with a shriek. His back was severely wounded by the blade; it would not stop bleeding.\"Third strike it is.\" His enemy sheathed his sword and went back to his group. The people of Qingzhou Academy now felt even worse because they now knew that Heiyan Academy had sent some compelling figures to cause serious trouble this time.\"To be honest, it's a waste of time if the students of Qingzhou Academy keep performing so poorly like this.\" Another young man came forward from the Heiyan group. His complexion was bright, and his eyes were shining with arrogance. His ego could be sensed by everyone there.\"Hey, why do you want to waste your time on these losers?\" someone behind him asked.He shook his head and answered, \"I am here to make sure these losers know how horrible they are. I am in the seventh Awakening Plane, the Mystery, and I will accept challenges from students in any Awakening Plane.\"The students of Qingzhou Academy were shocked. This guy was only in the Mystery Plane, yet he was asking for challenges regardless of plane limitation? How arrogant was that?\"I'll challenge you,\" Yang Xiu responded. He had been humiliated during the Fall Quarter Exam. He needed to prove himself again.\"I'll challenge you as well.\" Some other people also responded and stepped forward.The young man took a glance at them and said, \"Bring it on all at once, you fools.\"Right after he spoke, he stomped hard on the ground, and the snow was removed by the aftershock. A pattern began to show up on the ground. The challengers began their attacks, but the young man seemed to ignore them. He kept stomping, and more complicated patterns appeared on the ground, with ancient letters engraved on them.\"That's a matrix.\" The big chiefs of Qingzhou Academy were in awe of this young man. In fact, he looked like he was not even fifteen yet. He looked too young to build a matrix, let alone build one this fast.The Spiritual Qi was now centering on the middle of this matrix. The young man was standing on the powerful matrix, looking at the opponents with contempt. The challengers began to realize something was wrong, but it was already too late. They looked at each other, then launched their attacks together.Seeing the incoming attacks, the young man did nothing but laugh. He soon responded to the attacks, another matrix showing up behind his body. His body was now radiant with the glow from this new matrix, surrounded by the power of fire.\"Go, pythons,\" he commanded. All of a sudden, giant flaming pythons rushed out of the matrix behind him and began attacking the enemy. In fact, the flame python summoned by Yang Xiu was so small and weak compared to the giant monsters that the challengers could not hold off the attack for even a moment.The Director of the Hall of Water Element stepped out and cast a spell. The temperature dropped, and a freezing bite attacked the giant flaming pythons. They quickly dissipated in the snowstorm summoned by the director.The challengers were now lying on the ground, injured and in pain. They could have died if not for the snow storm summoned by the director.\"Oh my gosh, he's a Mandate Sorcerer!\" The Director looked shocked. But it was the truth. This young man who wasn't even fifteen-years-old was a Mandate Sorcerer!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 23": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Legend of FutianCH 23Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"Mandate Sorcerer,\" the students of Qingzhou Academy discussed in shock. That formation, it was a Life Spirit, no wonder he was able to create the matrix so quickly.This young fellow was not even fifteen years old, yet his matrix was so powerful that it could be a threat even to aces in the ninth Awakening Plane, the Unmaker Plane. Qingzhou Academy students were feeling threatened. With the two people before, they could still confidently say that Qingzhou Academy had students who were able to stand up to them but with this fellow, it would be difficult to find someone on his level.\"I heard that your academy just had Fall Quarter Examinations, who took first place?\" the youth asked arrogantly. He did not even spare a glance at the students; they were not good enough to be his opponents. He stared straight at the important figures of Qingzhou Academy.\"Murong Qiu,\" someone answered him. Everyone immediately shifted their gaze towards Murong Qiu but his fellow schoolmates did not hold high hopes for him. Even though he came in first during the exams, everyone knew that Yu Sheng and Hua Jieyu were both much stronger than him.Murong Qiu had no confidence in himself either. Everyone was looking at him, but he just stood there having no intentions of stepping up. Even Qiu Yan, who had been defeated earlier, was more capable than Murong Qiu.The important figures of Qingzhou Academy were also watching Murong Qiu but they were quickly disappointed when it became clear that he was not going to participate in the duel.\"Yu Sheng,\" Cabinet Master Leng Qingfeng of the House of Swordsmen called out. It was rumored that Yu Sheng had broken into the Unmaker Plane not long ago. Plus, Leng Qingfeng had already witnessed his power at the Fall Quarter Examinations. To have him battle increased their chance of victory.Yu Sheng glanced at Leng Qingfeng once and did nothing. He did not move, nor give a response. His expression was as cold as ice; it was like a silent protest.\"Seems like Yu Sheng is still pissed. I don't think he plans on fighting,\" someone said. Everyone shuddered at the expression on Yu Sheng's face. Not once did they think Yu Sheng was afraid of fighting like they thought Murong Qiu was. They felt that he was unwilling.In the past two months, Murong Qiu had become an official disciple. Even Yang Xiu joined the School of Divination Arts but not Yu Sheng. No matter how many times the schools of martial arts and divination arts tried to recruit him, he never once accepted. Qingzhou Academy knew exactly why. It had something to do with the ban they had placed on a certain student. They knew this made Yu Sheng very angry. Some people even hypothesized that as long as the ban existed, Yu Sheng might ever choose to leave the academy altogether.The higher ups of Qingzhou Academy had argued over this topic many times but there were still some individuals that refused to give in and lift the ban.It was because of this that Yu Sheng refused to battle, even if the academy's reputation was on the line. In Yu Sheng's eyes, the academy's punishment on Ye Futian was incredibly insulting. Until the academy was able to provide him with a satisfying result, Yu Sheng was unwilling to do anything for the academy.Leng Qingfeng was furious upon seeing Yu Sheng's reaction, but his anger was not directed at Yu Sheng. It was directed at Shi Zhong. He was extremely ticked off as he looked over at Shi Zhong. It was Qingzhou Academy that was in the wrong for being unjust; he had no right to punish Ye Futian for the way he had questioned the academy.\"Yu Sheng is still angry about what happened to you,\" said Feng Qingxue after witnessing this scene. Ye Futian nodded in agreement. Of course he knew how stubborn Yu Sheng was. If the academy had punished Yu Sheng, Yu Sheng would not have cared one bit; but because it had been Ye Futian, Yu Sheng was bound to hold a grudge. There was no way he would stand up for the academy. Ye Futian would do the same if it had been Yu Sheng who had been punished.Feng Qingxue was disappointed. If Yu Sheng was not going to forgive the academy, there was a slim chance of him forgiving her.\"Is Hua Jieyu here?\" asked one of the school's leaders. Everyone looked around in search of her. One part of the crowd moved to make a path for Hua Jieyu.With something big like this happening at Qingzhou Academy, it did not take long for Hua Jieyu to find out. She had to have come.\"So beautiful,\" said the fellow from Heiyan Academy. His eyes glistened at the sight of such a beauty.\"Hua Jieyu, looks like it's up to you,\" said the school leader from before. All of Qingzhou Academy anticipated her reaction. In three years, no one had ever seen Hua Jieyu in action. Would she be able to defeat this genius from Heiyan Academy?\"How can I possibly fight such a beautiful lady?\" The prideful youth was smiling as he looked at Hua Jieyu. \"We're not too familiar with the City of Qingzhou, why don't you keep us company, beautiful? I can let Qingzhou Academy off the hook for today.\"Hearing his words, his companions from Heiyan Academy began to laugh. Someone chimed in, \"Junior Brother has a point. Being accompanied by a beauty is a great thing. It could turn into a beautiful story for both academies.\"\"How presumptuous,\" said someone from Qingzhou Academy.\"This group of *ssholes,\" everyone from Qingzhou Academy joined together to curse at their rivals. They were furious, Hua Jieyu was the perfect being to all of them and she was now being insulted by these jack*sses from Heiyan Academy.\"Shut up, you group of losers. If you don't like the things we say then come stand up to us,\" said the young fellow. He was dripping with pride. The students of Qingzhou Academy felt deeply insulted but they knew that they could not fight against him.On the other hand, Hua Jieyu seemed to be at peace; she did not step up like the elders had hoped she would. She smiled and turned, her gaze falling on a certain someone. It was Ye Futian.Not only did she see Ye Futian, she also took notice of Feng Qingxue beside him. She smiled and said softly to Ye Futian, \"They're picking on me!\"When she turned toward Ye Futian, everyone was confused. The moment she spoke to him, their hearts broke.They're picking on me... It was such a gentle voice. Their perfect goddess was whining so cutely to Ye Futian. It was a cute, flirtatious whine. If she had said this to any of them, they would have fought to their deaths; but her words were sadly not for any of them.\"My heart hurts,\" someone said. Everyone saw Feng Qingxue standing beside Ye Futian. First he had teased Senior Sister Qin Yi. Now, he was with Feng Qingxue. He was surrounded by so many beauties. Why him?Feng Qingxue was shocked by Hua Jieyu's words. Feeling the countless pairs of eyes on herself, Feng Qingxue lowered her head and began to pick at the corner of her clothes. This was Hua Jieyu that she was up against.Ye Futian could feel all the gazes on him. He rubbed his forehead. It really was impossible for him to keep a low profile.Everyone from Heiyan Academy looked at him as well. They were trying to figure out what made Ye Futian so special that a beauty like Hua Jieyu would act that way towards him.Ye Futian took a step forward. The people of Qingzhou Academy thought that he was really going to try his best to stand up for Hua Jieyu; but then again, any of them would have done the same had they been in his shoes. However, their results would probably have been much worse.The prideful youth watched Ye Futian's figure. The corners of his lips lifted in a smirk as he said, \"I think it would be best for you to rethink your choice. Standing up for a girl; how corny. You better be prepared for the consequences.\"Ye Futian pretended not to hear him and said, \"First, slap yourself a couple times and then apologize. Maybe after that I'll decide to let you guys leave Qingzhou Academy unscathed.\"This.... Everyone's eyes widened. They couldn't believe what they had just heard. Even if you were trying to stand up for a girl you liked, you didn't have to be so arrogant. When he was completely defeated by their rivals, all of Qingzhou Academy was going to look so bad.The hearts of the Qingzhou students continued to ache. How could a person like this get a girl like Hua Jieyu? What was wrong with the world?Even the important figures of the academy could not bear to listen to Ye Futian. This rascal was exaggerating a little too much. Even though his gifts were not bad, his opponent was a Mandate Sorcerer.\"And if I refuse?\" The prideful youth was looking at Ye Futian as if he were a moron. There was definitely something wrong inside this guy's head.\"Well then...\" Ye Futian took another step forward. Everyone was still watching him. Just when they thought he was about to make a move, Ye Futian called out loudly, \"Yu Sheng!\"Dead silence.Wide-eyed, everyone continued to stare at Ye Futian. This was so like Ye Futian....Even Hua Jieyu was wide-eyed. This was embarrassing for her.The ground shook; snow flew around on the ground as Yu Sheng's large body approached the center of the crowd. His arrival was a threat in itself. It did not matter whether you liked Yu Sheng or not; there was no way you could deny that he was a natural born warrior.The expressions on some of the faces from Heiyan Academy darkened upon Yu Sheng's arrival. Just from his aura one would feel suffocated by his power. He was definitely stronger than any of the other Qingzhou Academy students.The important figures of Qingzhou Academy felt embarrassed. They could not get Yu Sheng to budge, yet two simple words from Ye Futian had been enough. It was really a slap in the face for them, but at the same time, they were relieved that he was finally stepping up for battle.Yu Sheng looked at Hua Jieyu and said, \"Leave it to me, sis-in-law.\"\"Huh?\" Everyone was confused.Smart guy! Ye Futian complimented him in his mind. Yu Sheng had changed; he had become so understanding.Yu Sheng pointed at the prideful fellow from Heiyan Academy and said emotionlessly, \"Scram. Let someone of a higher level come out. I don't want people to say that I pick on the weak.\"He's so cool. Everyone from Qingzhou Academy complimented him. This was crazy.Not long ago, someone else had also done something crazy like this, but everyone had thought it was embarrassing. It was the complete opposite with Yu Sheng. A shameless jerk like Ye Futian could never compare to Yu Sheng.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He was already arrogant enough about being a Mandate Sorcerer that he didn't expect there to be someone more arrogant than him.However, the truth was, these two new challengers were the source of this feeling.\"Fools,\" Yun Tianhao spoke in a cold voice. The Spiritual Qi started to surround his body, but Mu Jiang stepped up and stopped him. \"Let me take care of him,\" Mu Jiang said.He then moved directly towards Yu Sheng to challenge him. He faintly felt that Yu Sheng was a threat, and he wanted to take matters into his own hands to prevent Yun Tianhao from a sudden failure. Yun Tianhao was the pride of Heiyan Academy, and they couldn't afford to lose this pride.\"Sure, take him down for me,\" Yun Tianhao nodded and stepped back. Mu Jiang started to control the frost energy from his surroundings, and he vibrated with all the power around him.\"Yu Sheng, make sure he has to be carried out.\" Ye Futian was mad about being called a fool by Yun Tianhao.\"Of course,\" Yu Sheng nodded, then stepped forward firmly. The earth was shaking from his sheer strength. Mu Jiang stared at the huge guy in front of him and started to get concerned. He could feel a horrifying mass of coldness flowing in front him, forming a storm to attack his enemy.Yu Sheng stomped the ground and started to attack. Mu Jiang also initiated his spell. All of a sudden, an ice storm appeared out of nowhere, and Yu Sheng's body was covered with frost. Mu Jiang was trying to confine his enemy by trapping him in a prison of ice.That was the spell, Ice Imprisonment.\"Look how powerful he is.\" People noticed that the ice on Yu Sheng's body was growing thicker. Mu Jiang was still in the Plane of Awakening, but he could already convey Ice Imprisonment without physical contact. This ability usually belonged to those in the Glory Plane.However, a golden glow burst out of Yu Sheng's body, and suddenly, the ice shell started to shatter. He now looked like the Almighty in this golden glow, and he was unstoppable as he reached closer to Mu Jiang.\"Imprison him!\" Mu Jiang shouted, and another, stronger, ice storm burst out from his body. Yu Sheng was engulfed by the storm in a second. Qiu Yan had been defeated by the same tactic.Yu Sheng was not affected at all. He got rid of the ice on his body by merely shaking his hand. A golden glow flowed down his arm. Mu Jiang tried to retreat. As a mage, when he let a warrior into his melee range and failed to attack, he could do nothing but retreat.Unfortunately, he was just not fast enough. Yu Sheng's hand had already clamped onto his neck, and Mu Jiang's entire body was lifted into the air. People were in awe to see that Yu Sheng did this with such ease.\"Let him go,\" Yu Tianhao shouted at Yu Sheng. However, Yu Sheng ignored his words. He threw Mu Jiang to the ground and smashed his whole body. After a booming noise, Mu Jiang was screaming in extreme pain, and it sounded like his bones had been shattered.Futian wanted the guy to be lifted out so he obviously couldn't be allowed to walk.People were awestruck and fell silent. All eyes were drawn to the young man who was just as strong as the Almighty himself.\"That is some real power.\" The Qingzhou Academy students felt excited.\"So hot!\" some girls exclaimed.Mu Jiang, one of the arrogant intruders from Heiyan Academy who had defeated Qiu Yan in a second and intimidated Murong Qiu, the first place student in the Fall Quarter Exam, had just lost to Yu Sheng in such an embarrassing way. He was smashed with one hand. What an overbearing gesture Yu Sheng had made.\"Yu Sheng is going to attend my college. Whoever tries to take him away is going to be my enemy, for sure.\" The Director of the College of Martial Arts glanced at the other directors around him. He liked this young man so much that he believed he was meant to go to his college.\"So count me as your enemy. I want him.\" The Director of the Hall of Metal Element ignored his threat. He also believed that Yu Sheng would be a perfect student.Ye Futian seemed to be the only one that was not shocked by Yu Sheng's performance. In fact, Yu Sheng had been able to defeat those who were even in the higher planes of cultivation.\"Who else?\" After seeing the Heiyan Academy medical team take Mu Jiang away, Yu Sheng began to invite challengers again pridefully. Yun Tianhao was going to step up, but right at that moment, a hand landed on his shoulder and stopped him.The head of Heiyan Academy group, the man with eagle eyes, had keenly perceived the immeasurable power of Yu Sheng. He had told Mu Jiang to challenge Yu Sheng and test his power. Now he had the answer. He just could not risk the future of Yun Tianhao. Even though Yun Tianhao was a Mandate Sorcerer and able to defeat those in higher planes of cultivation, Yu Sheng was a monster. Even a powerful mage like Yun Tianhao did not have a one hundred percent chance of winning against him.\"Okay, we concede,\" the eagle-eyed leader said. Yun Tianhao felt reluctant to concede, but did not say anything.\"Then get out of here,\" a director at Qingzhou Academy uttered.\"We only lost one after you had lost three. You have thousands of students in the planes of awakening in your academy, but only one of them can fight?\" the eagle-eyed leader taunted them.\"At least that one's enough to sweep you all,\" Yu Sheng responded.\"You arrogant fool,\" Yun Tianhao said angrily. \"If I ever reach the ninth plane of awakening, you will bow down to my power.\"\"Seriously, who allowed challenges regardless of planes? What now? You want to change your mind?\" Ye Futian asked sarcastically.Yun Tianhao glanced at Ye Futian and said, \"If you want to challenge me, just step up and fight. Otherwise, stay a coward and shut up.\"People were now looking at Ye Futian. They didn't believe he was as powerful as Yu Sheng, so he was going to humiliate himself.Ye Futian frowned a little at the provocation. He laughed at the words \"be a coward\" and then stepped forward.This humiliation would not be tolerated.\"Yu Sheng!\" Ye Futian yelled.\"Yep,\" Yu Sheng responded.\"It's my turn.\" Ye Futian stepped forward.Suddenly, Yu Sheng started laughing and pointing at Yun Tianhao and said, \"This one's for you.\"Actually, he had let Yun Tianhao stay in the arena intentionally for Ye Futian to show off.However, why did he believe that Ye Futian would win?Besides, how dare Ye Futian challenge the pride of Heiyan Academy?The students had witnessed in person how powerful Yun Tianhao was. He was a Mandate Sorcerer who specialized in matrices, and he had defeated multiple challengers with only one strike from his matrix.Ye Futian continued stepping forward until he was standing in the middle of the arena. Feng Qingxue looked at him, and she experienced a moment of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. The exact same thing had happened during the Fall Quarter Exam. He had been the underdog of all the students, but he had ultimately defeated Ling Xiao and Yang Xiu, the top-ranked students.However, he was now challenging someone even more powerful, a Mandate Sorcerer from Heiyan Academy and the pride of all the students there.Ye Futian made a peaceful introduction. \"I am in the seventh plane of awakening, the Mystery.\"\"Only Seven?\" Yun Tianhao was surprised for a moment, then responded, \"You are too weak to challenge me.\"He had a strong enough talent to say that. After all, he was a Mandate Sorcerer who had never lost a challenge from anyone in the same plane or lower.\"I feel the same way about you, but since you're asking for it, I'll give you the humiliation you deserve.\" Ye Futian peacefully conversed with him. \"I don't mind if you take the challenge or not. All of you can take this challenge. You can take me on one on one, or you can take me on all at once.\"\"What the\u2026\" The Qingzhou Academy students were shocked. He didn't have to show off in such a dangerous way, did he?Ye Futian had repeated the intruders' own words.But, what if he lost? The students of Qingzhou Academy dared not think further.\"That's not funny at all.\" Yun Tianhao believed that Ye Futian was imitating him to mock him.\"Words are just words. Now you're the one acting like a coward,\" Ye Futian kept speaking, with an odd sense of confidence. He had his hands in his pockets and looked like he despised all of the Heiyan Academy group.Yun Tianhao was incredibly mad at this gesture. He had never seen anyone act so arrogantly in front of him. However, he had seen two arrogant fools today, and the one talking now was only in the seventh plane of awakening. How dare he talk like that to a Mandate Sorcerer!\"I'll take him on.\" The swordsman who had defeated Li Qingshan with three strikes stepped up. Yun Tianhao nodded and backed down. \"Take him down. Remember, never let him forget this fear.\"\"For sure, I will.\" The swordsman unsheathed his sword and pointed it at Ye Futian. \"Three strikes\u2014no more, no less.\"He had made the same statement before while defeating Li Qingshan.\"I don't need three. You'll be down after one strike,\" Ye Futian said calmly. The students of Qingzhou Academy were already used to his arrogance.They were just curious as to how this would eventually end.The swordsman started laughing, and wind gathered over his body. He had specialized in both sorcery and martial arts, and was in the eighth plane of awakening, the Metamorph. How could he ever lose to a cultivator in the seventh Plane of Awakening?The swordsman took the form of a shadow and disappeared. Snow was raging, and the attack was initiated. At the same time, Ye Futian closed his eyes.The students of Qingzhou Academy were dumbfounded. Had he lost his mind? He had just closed his eyes while facing an imminent attack?Even though most of the students hated Ye Futian, they didn't actually want to see him die. They had had a faint hope that this guy would save the pride of their academy, but it seemed that Ye Futian had just given up.Thunder started gathering around Ye Futian's body, and a roaring sound burst out of him. The sound was almost like a dragon. He stayed still and let his power take care of the fight.The blade was fast approaching his neck. However, Ye Futian seemed to be ignoring this attack. His eyes were still closed, and his body had not even moved an inch.The blade came within inches of Ye Futian without actually hurting him. This attack was a diversionary attempt to draw away his attention, but Ye Futian just didn't move at all.\"Die, you fool.\" The swordsman was agitated by Ye Futian. He had been counting on him to flinch and move to the side so that he could make the second attack, which was solid. However, the arrogance of Ye Futian made him change his mind. Now, the blade was rushing right toward Ye Futian's throat.Right before the blade touched his throat, Ye Futian started moving. He turned a little bit to his left, so subtly that the sword came through the air in front of his face. The audience was holding their breath at this evasion. How had he done that? Was it a reaction or merely luck?The swordsman frowned. His attack combo had been changed, and there was no way he could further adjust his attacks. In other words, he could no longer win this fight. However, right after Ye Futian turned away, his hand reached for the neck of his opponent. A thunder dragon was roaring and burst out of Ye Futian's palm. The dragon wrapped around the neck of swordsman and lifted his body into the air.\"Seriously\u2026.\" People were shocked by what they saw. Ye Futian had not touched his opponent at all, but he was in complete control of the thunder dragon that was totally overtaking the swordsman.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 25": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Legend of FutianCH 25Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"The Hand of the Dragon from the Release of the Dragon Power book of battle tactics, formed from the artistic conception of martial arts!\" said someone in the crowd.The elders shuddered. Having the artistic conception of martial arts meant that sorcery had started blooming outside of his body. Cultivators in the Unmaker Plane were able to do this, but nobody expected Ye Futian, who was two planes behind, in the Mystery Plane, to be able to do this as well. What was even more shocking was the fact that he was using the Hand of the Dragon.At that moment, many people were reminded of the Fall Quarter Examinations when Ye Futian defeated Ling Xiao and Yang Xiu with great ease. It seemed now that Ye Futian did not give it his all. He stepped off the battlefield and made Yu Sheng fight. This seemingly shameless move was not because he was afraid, but because he wanted to let Yu Sheng shine. It was also because of this that Ye Futian reacted the way he had when it was announced that Murong Qiu had gotten first place over Yu Sheng.Almost everyone had underestimated Ye Futian.Ye Futian took a look at the young swordsman in training who had fallen into the grasp of the Hand of the Dragon and spoke lightly, \"Heiyan Academy came so far to pick a fight but is this all you guys have?\"All the disciples of Qingzhou Academy looked at Ye Futian. Even though he was still being as pretentious as always, it did not bother them as much as usual.After the three previous losses, Qingzhou Academy was utterly humiliated. Now, they were going to gain back some honor with the help of Yu Sheng and Ye Futian.The young swordsman gave Ye Futian a dead stare. He still could not understand how Ye Futian managed to have such quick reflexes despite having his eyes closed.\"Next!\" shouted Ye Futian. The loud roar of a dragon accompanied the movement of his arm. With one quick, simple swipe, the young man was thrown back into the group of his peers from Heiyan Academy.Nobody in that group looked too good. They had sent out three people and gotten three consecutive wins, but now, two of those three people had been defeated in the blink of an eye. If this was the result they left with after having come such a long way, it would be really embarrassing.Yun Tianhao stepped up, looking more serious than before. He looked at Ye Futian and said, \"You're worthy enough for me to step in personally.\"Worthy enough? Ye Futian looked at him in disbelief. Yun Tianhao was more arrogant than Ye Futian.\"Make your move,\" said Yun Tianhao.\"You should make the first move. If I go first you won't have a chance to do anything.\" After hearing Ye Futian say this, Yun Tianhao's expression darkened. He then released his Life Spirit and took a step forward, a matrix forming underneath him. It was a Fire Matrix, able to endlessly absorb the world's Fire Elemental Spiritual Qi. Frightening fire boas revolved around the matrix. Yun Tianhao stood at the center pompously.\"How dare you act so presumptuously in front of a Mandate Sorcerer?\" asked Yun Tianhao. As he finished speaking, a fire boa broke free from the matrix and raged toward Ye Futian.Everyone from Qingzhou Academy had a change in expression. Yun Tianhao was able to control his sorcery outside of his body in the Awakening Plane. What's more, his spells were very powerful, perhaps even one of the most powerful in the Awakening Plane.Despite what everyone thought about Yun Tianhao's powers, Ye Futian walked up to the fierce fire boa nonchalantly. No matter how strong Ye Futian was, wasn't he being a little too cocky disregarding its powers?The fire boa approached, ready to engulf Ye Futian in flames. There seemed to be something clutched in his hands, and the next moment a force enveloped Ye Futian. Lightning and thunder surrounded him. When it collided with the fire boa, they both dissipated into the air.\"It's a spell scroll,\" said someone in the audience.\"Shameless, how can he use spell scrolls in a battle?\" the people of Heiyan Academy complained. Yun Tianhao continued to control his matrix, more fire boas danced through the air and charged at Ye Futian.Ye Futian charged head-on at the boas with multiple spell scrolls in his hand. With a sly smile on his face, he threw the scrolls into the air, and more of the boas disappeared in the cloud of lightning.Yun Tianhao growled in anger and continued to manipulate the matrix. More and more fire boas appeared in a frenzy. Suddenly, Ye Futian was holding a handful of scrolls on each side. People from both academies were dumbfounded. I guess that's one way to go about the situation...\"Stop.\" Yun Tianhao was not impressed.Ye Futian stopped what he was doing and looked at Yun Tianhao who was still standing in the middle of the matrix. \"You finally realized that you can't beat me and want to give up?\"Yun Tianhao had no words for Ye Futian. He stared at the spell scrolls in Ye Futian's hands and felt an urge to curse him out. Was this even a battle? How could Ye Futian be so shameless? How were they supposed to have a fair fight when he had fistfuls of top-grade spell scrolls?How did Ye Futian even have the nerve to ask if Yun Tianhao wanted to give up because he was unbeatable?\"As a disciple of Qingzhou Academy don't you think it's disgraceful to use spell scrolls in a battle?\" asked the eagle-eyed leader from Heiyan Academy. He could no longer stand what Ye Futian was doing.Others from Qingzhou Academy felt ashamed of Ye Futian. Their opinion of him had changed not long ago, but now they realized that he truly was just...shameless.However, Ye Futian did not seem to notice anything wrong. He remained arrogant as he stared at the eagle-eyed leader. \"If he can use a matrix in a battle, why can't I use spell scrolls? If you guys know that you can't win, then just leave. Stop throwing a tantrum.\"\"He created the matrix himself. It's one of his abilities, so of course he's allowed to use it in battle,\" reasoned the eagle-eyed leader.\"Well, I also inscribed these spell scrolls myself, so it's part of my abilities as well. If he can use a matrix, then why can't I use spell scrolls?\" Ye Futian retorted. Eagle-eye's expression darkened; he was speechless. Ye Futian's shamelessness was on a different level.The people of Qingzhou Academy were dumbfounded. Had he just said that he had inscribed the spell scrolls? How could a seventh plane cultivator in Awakening produce top-grade spell scrolls such as those? Wasn't Ye Futian exaggerating a little too much? Yun Tianhao had also created a top-grade matrix, but it was because he was a Mandate Sorcerer. His Life Spirit was the matrix.\"It wouldn't matter if you did personally inscribe those spell scrolls. I created my matrix during the battle; but you came onto the battlefield with pre-inscribed spell scrolls. How could these be comparable?\" said Yun Tianhao. He thought that Ye Futian was simply spewing nonsense.\"Since you won't admit defeat, I'll just have to continue to fight you until you accept it,\" Ye Futian spoke lightly. He then turned to the elders of Qingzhou Academy. \"Will you please ready a pencil and some scroll paper for me?\"The higher-ups were surprised. Was Ye Futian planning to inscribe spell scrolls during battle?\"I'll get them for you,\" an elder responded and departed quickly. The audience was discussing quietly amongst themselves as they all studied Ye Futian. Could he really be an Inscriber? Did he really inscribe all the spell scrolls he used earlier? If what he said was true, then Ye Futian really was gifted beyond belief.A short while later, the elder reappeared and handed a pencil as well as a stack of scroll papers to Ye Futian.\"Thank you very much,\" Ye Futian thanked him and began to lay out the papers in front of himself.\"What is he doing?\" Everyone wanted to know. Inscribing spell scrolls was just like creating a matrix, you needed time. Yun Tianhao was a Mandate Sorcerer who possessed a matrix for his Life Spirit, so he was able to create the matrix quickly, and was able to use it immediately in battle. Even if Ye Futian really was an Inscriber, he wouldn't be able to mimic Yun Tianhao's speed and efficiency, would he?If the opponent attacked with their matrix before you could finish inscribing your spell scroll, you would be as good as dead. However, it seemed that Ye Futian wanted to challenge the impossible.Many people turned very serious. Although Ye Futian was shameless, his capabilities were not something people doubted anymore.\"Is he mocking me?\" Yun Tianhao was furious when he saw Ye Futian laying out the papers. Even if he was an Inscriber, to do so while in battle with a Mandate Sorcerer using a matrix was a form of mockery.\"You may begin,\" said Ye Futian. He held on to his pencil calmly. He was being serious; it was as if a holy light was emitting from his person. This made people want to believe in him. It seemed like he was born with this aura around him.Yun Tianhao took a step forward and released his Life Spirit once again. This time, it was no longer a Fire Matrix, but an Ice Matrix. The Water Elemental Spiritual Qi in the surrounding area began to be absorbed into the matrix. From there, it cooled into ice. A blizzard began where Yun Tianhao stood. He was in a world of ice and snow all by his own doing. One could feel the freezing temperatures from far away.\"Because his Life Spirit is the matrix, he is able to control all elements. His matrix is able to absorb all the different elements. He's too powerful,\" said someone from Qingzhou Academy. Even though the two schools were rivals, the elders of Qingzhou Academy could not help but be envious of Yun Tianhao's gift. He was truly a genius. No wonder Heiyan Academy had brought him here to gloat.Even so, the young man whom Qingzhou Academy placed a ban on was facing Yun Tianhao fearlessly.Ye Futian sat on the ground, covered in snow, and inscribed his scrolls quietly. He created his strokes at the speed of lightning. The pencil danced across the paper like a dragon in the sky. Lightning Spiritual Qi flooded into the pencil in his hand.The bright lightning shone from the pencil. At that moment, Yun Tianhao made his move. A long icicle broke free from the matrix.\"Watch out!\" screamed out many concerned onlookers. Despite their warnings, Ye Futian kept his head now and continued inscribing the scrolls. With every stroke, lightning flashed. In just a moment, a curtain of lightning appeared in front of him, stopping the icicle headed his way. The icicle fell to the ground and shattered.\"A defense spell, Lightning Shield,\" said someone in the crowd. Many people knew what spell Ye Futian had used. He was able to use this spell to defend against his opponent's attacks.The ice on the ground cracked loudly. The Spiritual Qi continued to flow into the matrix, upon the completion of the matrix, Yun Tianhao raised both of his hands, controlling the icy world around him.\"GO!\" yelled Yun Tianhao. At his command, countless icicles flew towards Ye Futian relentlessly.\"Finished!\" Ye Futian completed his final stroke and lifted his pencil. The scroll followed the pencil and was lifted into the air. Once again, the Lightning Shield appeared and destroyed the attacking icicles.Ye Futian had still not lifted his head. He was inscribing another scroll. The movements of his arms were extremely fluid. Coupled with his good looks, he had the female disciples swooning. Who knew he was this powerful?Feng Qingxue kept her eyes on the young man sitting in the snow. She felt a slight sadness in her heart. She did not know why she felt this way. Ye Futian had just started to showcase his talents, yet it was already obvious that his gifts were unparalleled by that of any other.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It meant that this boy possessed an insane control over the perception of Spiritual Qi. Therefore, even without the scrolls, he was still able to initiate spells that wereabove his level and plane.\"Looks like we missed someone on the List of Excellence for the Fall Quarter Exam, and this guy is now on probation. Anyone mind explaining that?\" The Director of the Hall of Thunder Element questioned these decisions, giving Shi Zhong a cold glance.Shi Zhong looked really awkward. Yu Sheng had been so powerful in the previous battles, while Murong Qiu had been wholly intimidated by the enemies. Ye Futian just made Shi Zhong's situation worse with this talents.Ye Futian kept inscribing with absolute focus. Yun Tianhao, however, was mad. His matrix had no advantage against the inscriptions and it was humiliating.Yun Tianhao initiated spell attacks continuously. In fact, a lot of them were actually over the Plane of Awakening level. Ye Futian seemed to be unaffected by the attacks. He blocked every attack from Yun Tianhao with a swing of his inscribing pen and kept working on the scrolls. Soon, another scroll was coming into form.He finally finished the scroll and laughed slightly. At the moment he dropped his pen, a horrifying thunderstorm burst out of the scroll, roaring towards Yun Tianhao.\"Frost Barrier!\" Yun Tianhao sealed his body with the frost he had summoned. He almost looked like an ice sculpture. Frost Barrier was the top-level water-element defense spell in the Planes of Awakening.The thunderstorm was raging down from the sky. However, rather than attacking the frost barrier, it was the matrix under Yun Tianhao that was the focus of this attack. The patterns of the matrix were being scraped and destroyed.\"Be careful! He's aiming for your matrix!\" someone from Heiyan Academy tried to alert Yun Tianhao.At the same time, Ye Futian stood up. He charged toward Yun Tianhao like the wind. He was so fast that Yun Tianhao had no time to defend himself with his matrix.Yun Tianhao stood up straight. Coldness flowed around him, absorbing the power of the universe, and he was turning his own body into a matrix to generate spells.All the space around him began to freeze. His hair began to turn gray and white, along with his eyebrows. He looked directly at Ye Futian as frost condensed into sharp lances right in front of his body.\"Die!\" Yun Tianhao had lost his mind. He had decided to kill his opponent, and the frost lances were aimed at Ye Futian's heart.However, at the same time, a flame burst in front of Ye Futian. Soon, countless flames suddenly started to appear.\"Grand Meteor?\" The people of Qingzhou Academy were confused. The Grand Meteor was, in fact, the most basic spell of all attacks and its power was truly limited.The question was, where did it come from?Had Ye Futian controlled the fire-element power in the same space to initiate that? It was impossible, because it required the level of elemental power perception that did not belong to a cultivator in the Plane of Awakening level.\"He was at the highest level of martial arts power perception and thunder-element power perception.\"People were now reminded of his talents in power perception. In fact, they now believed that he also possessed talent in fire-element power perception, which could be at the highest level as well.Of course, the Grand Meteor did not serve as an attack. Yun Tianhao briefly lifted his hand, and his frost engulfed all of the flames in front of him. However, more flames were flying around his field of view. He suddenly realized that Ye Futian was blocking his sight with the flames and approaching him.Yun Tianhao considered this distraction useless. He was ready for any possible attacks.Suddenly, Ye Futian bolted to his side. At that moment, Yun Tianhao shouted with extreme anger. All of the frost lances floating in front of his body rushed at Ye Futian without any hesitation.While he attacked, Ye Futian's entire body was bathed in fire, and he almost looked as if he was glowing like the sun. All of the frost lances melted and vaporized the moment they reached his body.Ye Futian's body was more than a furnace that evaporated all coldness.Water-elements could counter fire-elements in a fight. However, when the flame was hot enough, it worked the other way.\"No! Tianhao, go back!\" the eagle-eyed leader yelled at Yun Tianhao. However, Ye Futian was just too fast. His body pounced into the air. Then he rushed at Yun Tianhao with all the flames around him, like a roaring fire dragon. A fire dragon seemed to posess Ye Futian's body during this attack.All the frost defense was gone. Yun Tianhao realized that there was nowhere he could escape to. The matrix on his body started to absorb any surviving frost power around the area to cushion the inevitable attack.A dragon roar shattered through the space and the frost barrier. Yun Tianhao was thrown into the air by this attack. The flame even penetrated his skin, and his whole body was scorched.An influential member of Heiyan Academy rushed forward and caught Yun Tianhao's body. Soon, many others gathered around this boy. They all looked incredibly nervous.A flow of blood gushed from his mouth. He felt a bit better and mumbled to the people surrounding him, \"I won't die.\"His arrogant eyes looked toward Ye Futian coldly. He had actually lost to someone in the same Plane of Awakening.Ye Futian was also looking at him. He started talking calmly, \"Someone once told me, a Mandate Sorcerer never loses, right?\"Another gush of blood flowed out. Yun Tianhao had been considered the pride of Heiyan Academy since he was a kid and had never been humiliated like this.However, he had lost anyway. He could not deny this fact.\"Who are you?\" He stared at Ye Futian with all the strength left in his body, as if trying to etch this boy into his memory forever.\"I am Ye Futian.\"The eagle-eyed leader frowned and asked, \"I knew all the names that were listed on the Lists of Excellence for the Spring and Fall Quarter Exams during recent years. Why were you not one of them?\"He believed that something must be wrong for a powerful mage like Ye Futian to be a nobody in Qingzhou Academy.The big chiefs of Qingzhou Academy felt uncomfortable about this question. Something was going on behind the scenes that had caused Ye Futian to be excluded from the List of Excellence. However, they could not answer the question with the truth.Ye Futian took this opportunity to mock the big chiefs of Qingzhou Academy. \"You know what? Not only am I not on the List of Excellence, but I am actually on a probation list now.\"\"You're the winner, but you don't have to humiliate me in such a manner.\" Yun Tianhao stared at Ye Futian. He thought Ye Futian was joking to make fun of him.\"He's telling the truth,\" Yu Sheng said, although it seemed like he was not satisfied by this truth.The people of Heiyan Academy were confused, but soon the eagle-eyed leader began laughing and looking at the big chiefs of Qingzhou Academy with contempt. \"Seriously, you put such a genius on probation? Boy, just quit your school and come with us. I promise you that you'll be the star over here.\"The people of Qingzhou Academy felt ashamed by this invitation, especially the big chiefs. Their enemy was now inviting a student that they had decided to put on probation. What irony was that?\"Thanks for your consideration, but no,\" Ye Futian rejected them directly.\"Sure. Next time we see each other, it's going to be a real fight.\" The eagle-eyed leader sounded like he was threatening and warning him, then he turned back. \"Let's go.\"The group from Heiyan Academy glanced at the Qingzhou Academy group, then turned around and left. Even though they had lost, their pride seemed unharmed by the defeat.Actually, the people of Qingzhou Academy weren't relieved either.Their \"top students\" had lost all three fights. Without Yu Sheng and Ye Futian, their arena would have witnessed the worst humiliation in the history of the academy.How exciting that one of the saviors of the academy's honor was currently on probation, and the other one had lost his first place on the List of Excellence.They were standing together, and all eyes were drawn to these boys. Only moments ago, people had finally realized how powerful they were.Before the fights, people believed they were just bad students with inappropriate arrogance.However, they now believed that their \"arrogance\" was, in fact, well-deserved.\"Ye Futian, I apologize on behalf of the academy. We have mistreated you. I am glad that we have seen our mistake. Now, since we know that you have the highest level of talent in thunder-element, fire-element, and martial arts power, do you have any preference in the selection of a college?\" Leng Qingfeng, the Director of the Hall of Swords, was now asking for Ye Futian's decision. The big chiefs had realized that with all of these talents and his scroll inscribing ability, Ye Futian would be the star of any hall he chose to attend.Both the College of Martial Arts and College of Sorcery were waiting for his choice.\"And Yu Sheng, you are more than welcome to join the Hall of Martial Arts. I will accept you as my own disciple if you choose to join, I promise,\" the Director of the Hall of Martial Arts invited Yu Sheng.\"Consider the Hall of Metal-element, Yu Sheng, you would be a great addition for us,\" the Director of the Hall of Metal-element was also competing for the prized students.Yu Sheng said nothing but looked toward Ye Futian. Ye Futian would make the final decision for both of them.The big chiefs realized what Yu Sheng meant by this gesture. They understood that Ye Futian would decide their futures.Everyone was watching Ye Futian, waiting for him to make the final call.Ye Futian perceived the expectations that all of the big chiefs had of him. He started speaking slowly. \"Are we done with what happened during the Fall Quarter Exam yet?\"This question indeed made a lot of big chiefs feel awkward and the students wondered how stubborn this boy was to stay fixated on the topic even at this point.\"This boy\u2026\" Qin Yi mumbled. Of course, he felt happy for Ye Futian and Yu Sheng, because their abilities had been confirmed to everyone at the school. There was no doubt that their futures would be splendid. However, why he did he continue to misbehave and bring up the topic of the Fall Quarter Exam again?Leng Qingfeng looked at Ye Futian, and he was even more dissatisfied about the conspiracy from Shi Zhong. He said, \"Ye Futian, we admit that we somehow made a misjudgement during the Fall Quarter Exam. However, you guys have totally proven to us how powerful you are. Let's just leave it in the past, please.\"\"Misjudgement, that's it?\" Ye Futian was laughing because he was still not satisfied. He knew that something must have been going on behind the scenes during the Fall Quarter Exam that made Murong Qiu rank first place. What Leng Qingfeng said was only to appease him.\"What do you want?\" Leng Qingfeng asked again.Ye Futian bowed slightly and said, \"To be honest, I am not even an official student at the academy. It is definitely not proper for me to say whether it was truly just a 'misjudgement.' We defeated Heiyan Academy only as a favor for the three years of education we received from Qingzhou Academy. As for becoming an official student, there is no need.\"People were shocked by his decision. The whole arena was in silence. Nothing moved other than the falling snowflakes through the air. People finally understood how stubborn this young man could be.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Just a while ago, Yu Sheng and Ye Futian defeated the people of Heiyan Academy and saved the honor of Qingzhou Academy. In combination with his astonishing gift, everyone knew that the ban was as good as gone. These two young men were definitely going to be well-favored by the higher-ups of Qingzhou Academy.The reality was exactly as had been expected. Many of the school leaders extended a welcoming hand to the two, and it seemed as if this whole fiasco was coming to an end. They would have never expected such an ending. Everyone had obviously underestimated Ye Futian's stubbornness and pride.If he were still the Ye Futian of the past, no one would have cared about him; now he was now a genius prodigy, He was able to inscribe top-notch spell scrolls in the blink of the eye and defeat a same-plane Mandate Sorcerer. He had every right to be prideful. Everyone fell into a deep silence, even the authoritative figures of Qingzhou Academy.At Qingzhou Academy, outer sect disciples received guidance and basic knowledge on cultivation from instructors, however, they had to put in a lot of work themselves for cultivation. Even at the library, they were only allowed on the ground floor. They did not have the privilege to make use of many other resources at the academy. The battle also now involved the honor of the entire academy, so when Ye Futian had said that this victory was a sign of gratitude for being able to cultivate at the academy for the past three years, no one could blame him for anything.From the looks of it, Ye Futian and Yu Sheng stepped up to battle together not only for Hua Jieyu, but they had everything thought out in advance.At the thought of this, none of the authorities had a thing to say. Ye Futian had studied at the academy for three years and not a single person was able to see his immense potential.\"In the Fall Quarter Examinations, Yu Sheng should have been ranked first and you third. This will be written down in the academy's records,\" Leng Qingfeng said to Ye Futian. In the crowd, Murong Qiu's expression darkened immediately. This was so embarrassing. Two months ago, it had been announced that Murong Qiu ranked first in the Fall Exams; now the academy was going to break tradition and alter its records by taking him off the ranks. This was sure to cause a huge ruckus. If the news got out, how was he going to look to the world? He would be a giant laughing stock.There was not a word from any of the other students. They could not help but look over at Murong Qiu. It was true; he had had no right to be ranked first. When Heiyan Academy attacked, he had not even had the courage to step up and fight. Yu Sheng, on the other hand, had been able to do everything Murong Qiu could not.\"I object,\" Shi Zhong spoke up, he was not pleased. He stared at Ye Futian and said, \"The results have already been announced, how can we change them so easily? Even though Ye Futian's performance today was impressive, we cannot ignore the fact that he used his victory in today's battle as a bargaining chip and threatened the academy. What's the use of having a student like this, even if he is immensely gifted?\"\"Threatening the academy?\" Ye Futian stared at Shi Zhong. It looked like it was Earth Elemental Pavilion Lord Shi Zhong who put Murong Qiu in the first rank position. It was most likely his idea to place the ban on Ye Futian as well.As for Cabinet Master Leng Qingfeng of the House of the Swordsmen, he had always been friendly to Ye Futian. He probably had nothing to do with any of this.Looking at Shi Zhong, Ye Futian could not hold in his smile, \"I'm just an outer sect disciple, what ability do I have to threaten Qingzhou Academy? On the contrary, I would like to ask Pavilion Lord Shi Zhong, what have I done to offend you?\"\"What do you mean?\" asked Shi Zhong.\"During the Fall Quarter Examinations, Yu Sheng obviously had the upper hand in terms of both gifts and capabilities. Today's battle was proof of that. When you gave first place to Murong Qiu, I was being reasonable to object your decision. Even if you thought I was purposely going up against you, I was already punished when you removed me from the ranks and banned me from class. I cannot understand why removing the ban on me is the only thing you are willing to offer after all the work Yu Sheng and I put in today to protect the academy. Does the honor of Qingzhou Academy mean that little to you?\"Ye Futian looked at Shi Zhong and continued, \"Or should I ask what exactly have I done for you to dislike me so much and what about Murong Qiu is so great that you had to give him first place? You even placed a ban on me under his influence, is that not true?\"\"How presumptuous!\" shouted Shi Zhong. His eyes shot daggers at Ye Futian, \"Utter nonsense! Is this the attitude you use when speaking with your elders? Even if we groom you into the best of the best, a treacherous student like you will only bring disaster in the future.\"Treacherous. Everyone could obviously tell that there was something deeper going on behind the results of the Fall Exams. Every word Shi Zhong said was an attempt to get Ye Futian expelled.Besides, just like Ye Futian had said, Shi Zhong's ban on Ye Futian was influenced by Murong Qiu. Thinking about what might have been going on behind the scenes gave the students of Qingzhou Academy shivers.\"Shi Zhong, that's enough,\" said the Pavilion Lord of the Thunder Elemental Pavilion. The seven Pavilion Lords of the School of Divination Arts were all acquainted with each other. There were some unspoken rules between them, and a blind eye was turned as long as it did not interfere with the interest of Qingzhou Academy.However, none of them expected the two young men, who were unfairly judged during the Fall Exams, to be this talented, as well as stubborn and prideful.\"Ye Futian, in today's battle you did a really big favor for the academy, so the academy will not mistreat you. There will surely be Pavilion Lords interested in accepting you two as official disciples. You guys will be able to focus on cultivations and in the future, the two of you will definitely make a name for yourselves and achieve great things. You shouldn't be too stubborn regarding other things,\" Pavilion Lord Li Jiang of the Wind Elemental Pavilion tried to persuade Ye Futian.Hearing these words, Ye Futian began to laugh at himself. It looked like he was still too young and too confident in himself. No matter how exceptional his gifts were or how much work he put in to protect the academy, it did not change anything. All it had done was help him gain the attention of a couple authoritative figures and speed up the process for him to become an official disciple.But was this really enough?Pavilion Lord Li Jiang wanted Ye Futian to stop being so stubborn. It was obvious that he wanted Ye Futian to stop while he was ahead. Li Jiang most likely shared Shi Zhong's opinion that Ye Futian was simply trying to threaten the academy. He was not really going to drop out of the academy. After all, Qingzhou Academy was the holy land for cultivators in the city of Qingzhou.Should Ye Futian really just forget about the events of the Fall Quarter Examinations? Was there really going to be no explanation for his punishment and the ban on him?As for the secrets behind the exam results, it seemed to be forbidden to expose. Maybe he was just too young, too na\u00efve.But there was one advantage of being young\u2014you had the right to be stubborn.At the thought of this, Ye Futian smiled and lightly bowed to the academy elders. Everyone watched him. What was the meaning behind his actions?\"I will remember everything Qingzhou Academy has taught me in these past three years. I will take my leave now,\" Ye Futian said with a smile. \"Yu Sheng!\" he shouted after.Beside him, Yu Sheng hummed in response. His eyes stared coldly at the elders, evidently unhappy.\"Let's go,\" said Ye Futian as he turned to leave, stepping into the white snow. Yu Sheng stopped his staring and followed closely behind Ye Futian.In that instant, their backs looked lonely but their footsteps determined. From this, it was possible to feel the pride they had.They were really leaving!The elders were all dumbfounded. They did not expect Ye Futian to take this so seriously.The House Master of the Battle House, the Cabinet Master of the House of the Swordsmen, and multiple Pavilion Lords stared coldly at Shi Zhong. The looks on their faces said it all. This caused Shi Zhong's expression to darken and he called out reluctantly, \"Wait.\"Ye Futian's steps halted and he turned around to look at the person speaking to him. \"Is there anything else you need from me, Pavilion Master Shi Zhong?\"\"What kind of place do you think Qingzhou Academy is, coming and going as you please,\" said Shi Zhong. Ye Futian squinted his eyes in confusion and asked, \"What exactly are you trying to say?\"\"You're rebellious by nature and hold a grudge against Qingzhou Academy. Now that you're leaving the academy, do you plan to join Heiyan Academy to get revenge on Qingzhou Academy?\" Shi Zhong asked.The temperature dropped at his words. Everyone could feel the iciness in his voice. Was Shi Zhong trying to give Ye Futian the death sentence by saying this?Heiyan Academy and Qingzhou Academy were rivals; therefore, as soon as Shi Zhong instilled the thought in everyone's heads that Ye Futian and Yu Sheng could betray Qingzhou Academy, what awaited them was not a pretty ending.\"Pavilion Lord Shi Zhong, Ye Futian had already rejected Heiyan Academy's offer, it's impossible that he would go join them,\" Qin Yi said with worry. Ye Futian's performance today really surprised her, but his stubbornness left her speechless. However, she felt that she must speak up against Shi Zhong right now.\"Of course, he wouldn't accept the offer in front of all of us but how about when he steps outside?\" asked Shi Zhong. Beside him, Leng Qingfeng observed him. Shi Zhong was trying to force Ye Futian into a dead end. Even if Ye Futian had no such thoughts, the consequences of Shi Zhong's words had already been placed into action.\"What do you want?\" asked Yu Sheng. The rage he felt radiated off of him.\"Rid yourself of all the powers you gained in the past three years,\" Shi Zhong said. It was dead silent once again.Everyone was stupefied; no one was able to make a sound. It was a long while before soft steps could be heard. A perfect silhouette appeared like a goddess descending from heaven. It was Hua Jieyu.She stopped beside Ye Futian and took a look at him. This made Ye Futian lose his train of thought. She really was a fox.Hua Jieyu then shifted her gaze toward Shi Zhong and smiled lightly, \"I think it would be best if you took back the words you just said.\"Her voice was so soft and peaceful; it was almost able to put everyone under her spell. Was she threatening the Pavilion Lord of the Earth Elemental Pavilion?A while ago, it was Ye Futian who had stepped up to protect her. Now, it was her turn to protect him. Many people in the audience were envious and jealous of Ye Futian right now.In the snow, Ye Futian and Hua Jieyu stood side by side. The holy Qingzhou Academy did not seem so impressive anymore.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Were they already dating?However, their viewpoints had changed slightly. They didn't feel pity for Hua Jieyu. In fact, they understood that Ye Futian was the only boy qualified enough to become her partner.Subconsciously, their views about Ye Futian had transformed entirely after the fight. He now symbolized dedication and talent in their minds.Even Yang Xiu and Ling Xiao, who used to look down upon Ye Futian, had changed. The one they once ridiculed was the only one able to defeat a Mandate Sorcerer, challenge the rules of the academy and utterly reject the idea of becoming the disciple of a Hall Director. He had never taken them seriously before.Feng Qingxue was also staring at Ye Futian and Hua Jieyu. It looked like she had tears welling up. She thought maybe the Goddess of this academy was the only one that deserved a boy as great as Ye Futian. She had used to believe she was out of his league, but now, she knew that it was the other way around.Shi Zhong had not expected to see Hua Jieyu stand up for Ye Futian. She had even threatened him for this boy's sake. He couldn't help swearing to himself. Undoubtedly, love among young people was so consuming that even a girl as wise as Hua Jieyu could get lost in her feelings.\"Hua Jieyu, this is none of your business. Step away,\" Shi Zhong spoke gently to her. He knew how powerful this girl was and how influential her family was, so he didn't dare act harshly to her, even after being obviously threatened.\"You don't get my point, do you?\" She was still smiling in such a beautiful manner that it totally contradicted her cold tone of voice. She was utterly humiliating Shi Zhong in public.Shi Zhong became even more upset and stopped trying to hide it. No matter how remarkable this girl was, he was still a director at the academy, and he was the elder in this conversation. How frustrating it was to be threatened twice by a young girl, in front of the students no less.\"Listen, this should be taken care of by the academy. Even your father wouldn't interfere,\" Shi Zhong's tone turned rigid.Hua Jieyu looked him in the eye and kept talking. \"So you're telling me that you'll never regret the decision you just made, right?\"\"Of course,\" Shi Zhong responded. \"Ye Futian betrayed this academy with all the powerful talents he gained there. If he ever attended Heiyan Academy and turned his back on us, the damage could be tremendous. His abilities must be taken to prevent this treachery.\"Hua Jieyu was laughing at Shi Zhong's statement. She did not even try to hide her contempt. Was he being serious?\"I gave you a chance to redeem yourself, but it's gone,\" Hua Jieyu mumbled as if talking to herself. The moment she stopped, the snowflakes surrounding them turned into a frenzy. The wind blew harder in the area, and everyone was feeling frostbitten. A general sense of threat was impending. Even though people had tried to attribute this to the snow, they believed it was actually anger from the beautiful girl.\"Whose power are you going to strip?\"A cold voice sounded on the far side of the space. There was a path between the rows of trees, already white due to the massive snowfall, and someone was walking down the road toward them.The man was wearing a white fur coat and had long black hair that casually covered his shoulders.He was middle-aged and truly handsome, like a melancholy scholar. He was walking slowly, but his pace was magically attracting the attention of all the bystanders.In fact, he was walking faster than his pace seemed to allow. In a short while, he was approaching the crowd, and people had the chance to look clearly at his face.\"This gentleman is unparalleled by the rest of the world.\" People were amazed by this incredibly handsome man. Both his appearance and temperament were just perfect. People believed that when he was young, he must have been a real lady's man.\"Mr. Hua,\" the big chiefs of the academy, even the directors, greeted him. Shi Zhong, however, looked upset at the fact that he had arrived.The students of Qingzhou Academy were shocked to suddenly see someone that was called \"Mr.\" by all the big chiefs, even the directors. Who was he?\"Father?\" Hua Jieyu greeted. The students finally realized why Hua Jieyu had such superior power at this academy, even strong enough for her to confront a director. It was no wonder anymore, when even the directors had to greet her father respectfully.Plus, his face definitely explained where Hua Jieyu's beauty had come from.Hua Fengliu nodded, then turned to look at Shi Zhong, \"Answer me, now.\"\"Mr. Hua, excuse me for the misunderstanding. I would never dare to strip the abilities of your daughter. I did not mean any harm to Ms. Hua.\" Shi Zhong said politely.\"I know.\" Hua Fengliu understood that Shi Zhong didn't have the guts to threaten his daughter. He turned back and looked at Ye Futian. \"Then he is your target, right?\"Shi Zhong nodded and pointed to Ye Futian. \"Mr. Hua, this boy is a student of Qingzhou Academy. He was committing treachery by trying to quit the academy and join our enemy. To prevent further treachery, his abilities and talents must be removed. Jieyu was trying to stop me for a reason I do not understand.\"\"Is he telling the truth?\" Hua Fengliu asked the boy.\"Professor, how could this be true?\" Ye Futian shook his head with a wry smile. He knew that Mr. Hua should have been informed of what really happened.\"Professor?\" Shi Zhong was shocked by this form of address. His face suddenly became pale.He could not believe that Ye Futian had been a disciple of Hua Fengliu and that Hua Fengliu had come here not to stand up for his daughter, but for this boy.Shi Zhong now felt cold, his back dripping with sweat. He felt the temperature around his body drop. Even with his Plane, he felt true coldness.\"My disciple just fought for the honor of Qingzhou Academy, but now you're trying to deprive him of all his power?\" Hua Fengliu sounded peaceful, but everyone realized that he was concealing his anger. He stepped forward a bit toward Shi Zhong. People noticed that Shi Zhong was actually trembling.Hua Fengliu gave his ultimatum.\"Looks like you have been the Director of the Hall of Earth Element long enough.\"His beautiful eyes suddenly turned white and glowed. Horrifying lights shot out of his eyes. His hair flew around his shoulder from the storm wind he had caused. The storm took a moment to form, then suddenly rushed toward Shi Zhong.Shi Zhong had no choice but to defend himself. He summoned the earth-element Spiritual Qi of the universe to form a wall to protect against Hua Fengliu's attack.However, it didn't work at all. The wall was shattered in a moment, and Hua Fengliu reached his hand out toward Shi Zhong. The wind around his body formed an invisible hand that clamped around his neck and lifted his body into the air.\"Mr. Hua, forgive me. I did not know he was your disciple!\" Shi Zhong was yelling for mercy, but his voice was hoarse from his throat being clamped.\"Now you know.\" Hua Fengliu became frenzied. The white lights from his eyes were horrifying. He smashed Shi Zhong's body to the ground so hard that a fissure appeared.The big chiefs could not do anything but watch as Shi Zhong was being smashed to the ground and lifted into the air repeatedly. Two sounds were resonating around the space\u2014the sound of Shi Zhong hitting the ground and his screams. People could only feel pity for Shi Zhong, because even as a director, he shouldn't have pissed off someone as powerful as Mr. Hua.After a while, the torture finally stopped. The earth wasn't shaking anymore. Hua Fengliu put his hand down, and his eyes became peaceful again. He explained to those who were still shocked by what had happened, \"Sorry, I have bad temper.\"Ye Futian's eyes widened, and he couldn't stop looking at Mr. Hua. He had never imagined that a gentleman like his professor could be as violent as this. However, he believed it was cool for a real man to switch between being calm and collected to as violent as Mr. Hua was.Other directors of Qingzhou Academy could only smile wryly. Leng Qingfeng started speaking, \"Mr. Hua, I feel so sorry for our mistakes. We will definitely make compensation to Ye Futian for our errors in the future.\"\"Future? There is no future. This academy does not deserve him,\" Mr. Hua sounded peaceful again. Leng Qingfeng stopped talking because he understood that as long as Mr. Hua had already accepted Ye Futian, it would be unnecessary for Ye Futian to become an official student at the academy. But in this case, there was also no way Ye Futian would betray this academy.They just wondered when Ye Futian had become his disciple.Soon, Leng Qingfeng was reminded of a past occurrence. Before the Fall Quarter Exam, there was a dragon wandering in Mount Tianyao. They heard that a daredevil boy had gone deep into the mountain and was attacked by the dragon. Later the boy was taken away by Hua Fengliu. People were focused on dealing with the dragon since it was so late at night, and didn't pay attention to who was attacked. When they finally tried to find the boy, he was already gone.It had been months, and people had forgotten about this. Now they finally realized that Ye Futian was the boy who was attacked by the dragon.\"Let's go,\" Hua Fengliu said.\"Okay,\" Ye Futian nodded, then Hua Jieyu, Yu Sheng and him left with Hua Fengliu.\"That was just awesome, Professor. What was that? A spell or a martial arts technique? Why have I never seen that before?\" Ye Futian kept asking.\"You will know, in the future.\" Hua Fengliu smiled at him.Ye Futian could not stop his curiosity. He looked at Hua Jieyu and asked her, \"Fox, mind telling me?\"Hua Jieyu smiled back at him, \"Sorry, no comment.\"\"Phew\u2026\" Ye Futian sighed and mumbled, \"I thought you were in love with me when you stood up for me. Am I wrong?\"The smile on her face was suddenly gone. She gave Ye Futian a malevolent look then ran to her father.However, Yu Sheng was looking at Ye Futian with admiration. This guy had just flirted with the daughter of his professor. He believed the professor would become Ye Futian's father-in-law someday in the future.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 29": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Legend of FutianCH 29Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayEven after Ye Futian departed with Hua Fengliu, the people of Qingzhou Academy were still unable to calm down.It was going to be difficult to forget the image of a determined Ye Futian. Ye Futian and Yu Sheng did not say much about being treated unfairly during the Fall Quarter Examinations, nor did they say anything when the academy decided to punish Ye Futian. Despite receiving unfair treatment from the academy, it was the two of them who still stepped in to protect the honor of Qingzhou Academy. However, they were resolute in their decision to leave after gaining the attention of the most influential people at the academy.Finally, the relationship between Hua Jieyu and Ye Futian was clear and the hatred that everyone felt for Ye Futian in the past disappeared. Everyone used to think that Ye Futian was unworthy of a goddess like Hua Jieyu, but now, he was the only person of the outer sect disciples that was worthy of standing by her side.Naturally, this only made the hate Murong Qiu felt for Ye Futian grow stronger.Pavilion Lord Shi Zhong of the Earth Elemental Pavilion was badly hurt, but only one of his colleagues went over to help him up. The others just left, obviously unhappy with him. As a result of his actions, Qingzhou Academy might lose three of their most gifted students. If the three of them made a name for themselves, would Qingzhou Academy be able to tell the world that they made any contributions to their success?....Ye Futian returned to his master's residence, where he had left just a little while ago. It felt weird to be here again.\"Ye Futian,\" called out Hua Fengliu as he took his seat.\"Master,\" replied Ye Futian. He was still trying to figure out his Master's true identity.\"This was most likely the doing of Shi Zhong alone, as he harbors bad intentions. I will have Qingzhou Academy deal with him. Qingzhou Academy has contributed so much to the city of Qingzhou; there's no need to harbor vengeance against them for the doings of one person,\" Hua Fengliu reasoned.\"Yes, Master. I understand,\" nodded Ye Futian.\"I am confused as to why you're so adamant about leaving the academy. If you choose to stay, then it would only be a matter of time before one of the Pavilion Lords set their sights on you. You would be highly valued,\" Hua Fengliu asked puzzled.\"I know the other Pavilion Lords are different from Shi Zhong, but still, none of them prevented his actions toward me even though they knew what he did was wrong. It's obvious that they were not willing to make an enemy of Shi Zhong for a mere outer sect disciple like myself. One might say that it was because I was not worth fighting for back then, but even after today's battle, they were still unwilling to help Yu Sheng and me. I can't tolerate this, so naturally I made the decision to leave the academy. Besides, now that Shi Zhong has a bone to pick with me, staying will only make things harder for myself. Should I have to fight against a Pavilion Lord while in the Awakening Plane?\" explained Ye Futian.Ye Futian continued, a bit confused himself, \"As for being valued by the Pavilion Lords, none of them can surpass you. Under Master's guidance, would I even need them?\"\"This...\" Yu Sheng listened from behind Ye Futian. He was impressed. With this level of brown-nosing, no wonder Ye Futian was able to turn his master into his father-in-law.Hua Jieyu looked at Ye Futian with disdain. At the same time, she could see that her father was nodding in agreement with Ye Futian. Hua Fengliu looked very satisfied at his response and replied, \"You have a very good point.\"Yu Sheng widened his eyes. Hua Fengliu was definitely not the modest type.\"Master, the outside world is too dangerous. A small issue is enough to warrant a request to rid me of my powers. I think I should just stay here by your side and cultivate from now on,\" Ye Futian saw an opportunity and took it.\"No!\" Hua Jieyu opened her mouth before her father could say anything. What did he mean the outside world was too dangerous? Did he plan on just staying indoors for the rest of his life?\"Father, you said that cultivation isn't simply about putting work into training and practice; you must also have actual battle experience. If I have to regularly go to Mount Tianyao for battle training, then he should definitely have to as well. Since his gift is so great, he needs to go out and gain actual experience to aid his cultivation,\" said Hua Jieyu.\"Master, what she said is correct. So, from now on, besides cultivating here, I should go out regularly with Hua Jieyu. Under her care, Master shouldn't have to worry about me,\" said Ye Futian.\"You...,\" Hua Jieyu was completely speechless. She felt wronged as she looked toward her father. \"Father, are you really not worried he might do something to me?\"\"Of course I'm not worried! You've been cultivating longer than he has and you have more experience. Would he even be able to bully you?\" asked Hua Fengliu jokingly.\"But,\" Hua Jieyu had more to say but was cut off by Ye Futian. \"Thank you, Master!\"\"Am I the third wheel?\" Yu Sheng asked quietly. He scratched his head in confusion. Ye Futian looked back at him and thought that Yu Sheng was getting smarter and more observant by the day.Hua Fengliu smiled at Yu Sheng and said, \"Yu Sheng, you're a natural warrior and need to continuously refine your skills through battle. I will give you a spell scroll for defense later. You should also pick out some books on battle tactics and some spell books for cultivation from my library. Then, head to Mount Tianyao to train. You should keep challenging higher level demons to help yourself improve.\"\"Okay,\" nodded Yu Sheng. It seemed like he really was the extra wheel.\"Master, what about me?\" asked Ye Futian with anticipation. He had already learned to inscribe spell scrolls and could not wait to see what Hua Fengliu had in store for him next.\"Since you're cultivating in martial and divination arts, you'll need to break through the planes for both at the same time. You've got tons to do,\" said Hua Fengliu. Ye Futian nodded and headed towards the study. Hua Fengliu had a large collection of books in his library, including books from all categories. It was a smaller version of Qingzhou Academy's library.\"Awakening level Thunder Elemental Sorcery, Thunder Lash, and Fire Elemental Sorcery, the Burning of Silence,\" Ye Futian picked these two spellbooks to study. As he continued to study the spells, night fell.The snow was still falling and a crescent moon hung in the night sky.The sound of a string instrument resonated throughout the residence. It was a guqin. The song was peaceful and brought serenity.Ye Futian was drawn in by the sound of the guqin. He left the library and walked toward the main residence. There, he saw Hua Fengliu plucking away at the strings of the guqin. Basking in the moonlight, he looked so graceful.Freedom Meditation kicked in by itself. Ye Futian could almost see the music notes floating through the air like tiny fairies.His eyes closed, Ye Futian sat down in the snow and emptied his mind. He could feel the moonlight washing down on him, the cool light cleansing his body. The music flowed into his body, into his Life Palace. There, the World Tree began to rustle. Each leaf danced as the music notes wafted. The notes floated around, and eventually formed a picture. It was a guqin.The guqin continued to play. Ye Futian entered a state of oblivion. Only the music continued to enter his mind, relaxing his entire being. His worries were all tossed into the back of his mind.The song ended. Ye Futian still had his eyes closed. In his Life Palace, a third type of Life Spirit appeared in addition to the Natal Spirit and the World Tree Spirit. It was the Guqin Spirit.Ye Futian was shocked. He knew that even by using the Freedom Meditation, Life Spirits could only be created in very special conditions. However, all it had taken for him to create the Guqin Spirit was one piece by Hua Fengliu.Ye Futian opened his eyes slowly and asked Hua Fengliu, \"Master, what piece was that?\"\"Purification of the Night Moon,\" replied Hua Fengliu.\"I felt something change within me after listening to Master play. My ability to perceive energy has strengthened. I want to learn to play the guqin,\" said Ye Futian with great determination. Energy determined the level of a sorcerer, so if pieces played on the guqin could help improve that, then it would definitely aid in cultivation.\"Okay,\" said Hua Fengliu with a smile. Hua Jieyu watched everything unfold off to the side. She looked at her father and knew that he purposely played the guqin to test Ye Futian. Hua Fengliu wanted to pass down this skill to Ye Futian.\"Let's start by learning some basic pieces. Hua Jieyu, bring the sheet music. You will teach Ye Futian,\" ordered Hua Fengliu.\"Me?\" Hua Jieyu blinked in disbelief and looked at her father in distress. Ye Futian felt touched, Master was too good to him.\"Be a good girl,\" Hua Fengliu tried to persuade Hua Jieyu. She glared at her father and left to get the sheet music.Moments later, the moonlight was shining down on Hua Jieyu as she sat elegantly in front of the guqin. She unwillingly explained something to Ye Futian.\"Hey Fox, how do I play this note?\" Ye Futian pointed at the music score and accidentally touched Hua Jieyu's hand.Hua Jieyu immediately turned to look at him. In response, he said, \"Sorry. It was an accident. I can't see clearly since it's dark out here.\"\"How many accidents have you had already?\" Hua Jieyu asked with a smile on her face. Her hand touched Ye Futian's waist. Her fingers grabbed hold of him and she began to pinch down hard. He gasped and looked at the beauty in front of him. At least he could enjoy the view while in pain.Ye Futian learned quickly, acquiring all the basic knowledge. He then began to play sheet music. Slowly, his skills matured, until he was able to play smoothly.It got deeper into the night. Hua Fengliu had already gone to bed but Hua Jieyu was still by Ye Futian's side, teaching him the ropes.At that moment, Ye Futian had his hands on the instrument and a bright aura emitted from him. When his fingers plucked at the strings, the music flowed and sent shivers down Hua Jieyu's spine.She watched as Ye Futian kept his eyes closed. His Guqin Spirit harmonized with the guqin, giving life to every note that resulted from a stroke of his fingers.Under the moonlight, his handsome face looked peaceful. His hands were like magic; they had the ability to get the listener moving with their every stroke. Hua Jieyu became more and more relaxed, her eyes closing as well. She was immersed in the music, and eventually fell asleep sitting in the snow.\"A prodigy,\" remarked Hua Fengliu, who was listening from his bedroom. He was very pleased. He too closed his eyes, drifting off to sleep with the music.Ye Futian was spellbound by the music, unable to pull himself out of the state. He continued to play throughout the night, but felt no fatigue. On the contrary, he felt clear-minded.The next morning, he opened his eyes and felt a change within himself. Using the Freedom Meditation to perceive the Spiritual Qi of the Heavens and the Earth, he knew that he had broken into the eighth plane of Awakening for sorcerers. He could not help but smile.Ye Futian looked ahead and saw Hua Jieyu laying in the snow, her body covered in a layer of white snow. The jacket laid out on top of her was now drenched. He walked up to her and carefully removed the jacket. At that moment, Hua Jieyu opened her eyes and looked up at Ye Futian. He smiled at her and retracted his hand. \"The jacket's wet, I didn't want you to get sick so I took it off for you,\" he explained.\"Really? You didn't have any other intentions?\" she asked with a faint smile.\"Am I that type of person?\" Ye Futian saw her smile and took a step back.\"What do you think?\" laughed Hua Jieyu.Suddenly, they heard something. It was the door to Yu Sheng's room. He stepped out and saw Hua Jieyu and Ye Futian. He then gave them a strange look.\"I'm going to leave now. Please feel free to continue whatever you guys were doing,\" Yu Sheng said as he took giant steps to bring himself away from the two. They were flirting in front of him so early in the morning. How inconsiderate! How was he supposed to feel about this?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His days consisted of playing the guqin, practicing his inscribing, and enjoying the company of a beautiful girl. With this comfortable life, time flew and the new year was fast approaching.One day, a giant monster flew into Guqingzhou Academy, a huge black condor. Even though the guards of the academy had tried to stop her, she flapped her wings so vigorously that the wind prevented anyone from approaching her.There were several people mounted on the condor. The leaders of this group were an old man and a young man.\"That way.\" The older man pointed toward the academy. The huge black condor flew as directed, and on the way, the Director of the Hall of Earth Element, Shi Zhong, showed up, trying to stop this monster. \"Stop, right now!\"However, the condor just ignored the warning, and so did the people on top of her. The wind from her wings was so intense that the fierce power knocked Shi Zhong yards away in a second. The people on her back didn't seem to be affected by his interruption.The condor was heading to Hua Fengliu's house. The gentleman in white came out of his house and walked to the black condor without making much noise.\"Hua Fengliu,\" the old man started speaking with a sneer. \"It's been three years since our deal. Where is Ms. Hua Jieyu?\"\"It has not been three years yet. You promised me that you would not interfere with her,\" Hua Fengliu responded coldly.\"The new year is coming in a few days, so it has, in fact, practically been three years. She's too talented to waste so much time with you. This is just enough for our deal,\" The old man said.\"Time is time, I insist it has not been three years yet.\" Hua Fengliu did not give in.\"Mr. Hua, the Guqin Devil, I am Zhou Mu\" the young man who bowed slightly to Hua Fengliu and greeted him. It was just general courtesy. In reality, the smile on his face showed that he was too young to be genuinely humble and had a faint sense of disdain.Hua Fengliu glanced at him and asked, \"Who are you?\"\"My master, the Art Saint, has been feeling somewhat guilty over the years since he destroyed your natal spirit. He sent me here to see if you were doing well,\" Zhou Mu smiled as he spoke. Hua Fengliu's eyes soon turned sharply to this young man, but he was not going to attribute this humiliation to Zhou Mu. He turned to the older man and asked, \"Why did you bring his disciple to my home?\"\"I did not bring him here. The Art Saint actually sent him. Zhou Mu, sixteen years old, a Glory Plane invoker,\" the old man told Hua Fengliu.Suddenly, Hua Fengliu understood what the Art Saint was trying to do. He started laughing so hard that his hair flew around him, then he said, \"He lost to me in the past, and he wants his disciple to win in the present? Is that correct?\"\"My master destroyed your natal spirit and banned you from entering the City of Donghai forever. How did he lose?\" Zhou Mu rejected.\"A win or loss is not judged by you, young man Hua Fengliu said with a smile. \"Just go back, I do not have time for this.\"\"Then I will come back for Hua Jieyu after the new year. If you try to stop me at that time, my family will not make it easy for you,\" the old man sneered, and suddenly the black condor swayed upwards and flew away. Hua Fengliu looked at the shrinking image of that black spot and laughed, \"You already lost in the past, and now you're putting your hope onto your disciple? That's not going to work,\"...In the guest room, Ye Futian had finished a song. He opened his eyes, but the feelings from that song were not gone. Mr. Hua had not taught him any songs other than the Purification of the Night Moon. Ye Futian's activities these days were just cultivation and music practice. In fact, his Plane of Martial Arts had reached Metamorph, the eighth plane. His Plane of Sorcery had broken through two planes directly, and now he was in the ninth Plane of Awakening, the Unmaker. Ye Futian understood that the Purification of the Night Moon played an essential role in this fast improvement.At this time, Hua Jieyu was inscribing. Ye Futian went to her side and asked her gently, \"Fox, do you want me to keep playing?\"\"No.\" Hua Jieyu did not even look at him.\"Then I guess it's time for us to have a couple's talk.\" Ye Futian kept teasing her. Hua Jieyu put down the pen and started smiling at Ye Futian. However, the Spiritual Qi around her gathered, almost like she was going to attack. Ye Futian stepped away and said, \"Gentlemen fight with words rather than actions.\"\"I am a gentlewoman, thank you.\" Hua Jieyu condensed the power into a wind-element spell and sent it toward Ye Futian.\"Don't kill your boyfriend!\" Ye Futian ran away quickly. Hua Jieyu was already a mage in the Glory Plane. There was no chance he could take that damage.Hua Fengliu came in from outside and saw the scene. \"Jieyu, stop it.\"Hua Jieyu stopped according to his demand. She glared at Ye Futian and complained, \"Dad, this guy keeps picking on me every day.\"Hua Fengliu ignored the complaint and asked them to come with him. \"Just follow me.\" Ye Futian understood that there was something serious going on for Mr. Hua, and he stopped his joking attitude at once. Hua Jieyu and Ye Futian followed Mr. Hua to a room. Hua Fengliu led them to his own book collection room.There were shelves in his book collection room and a chamber that was concealed in the wall behind them. Ye Futian was surprised when Mr. Hua opened the chamber and took out something that seemed to be very important.There were some books in the hidden chamber. Hua Fengliu took them out and handed them to Ye Futian. \"Futian, they are all yours now.\"Ye Futian knew that these books were the true treasures. He took the books and read the names on them: Dragon Roar in the Mountain, The Fiend's Carnival, The Dance in Flamboyant Feathers\u2026 These books were actually guqin music sheets.\"Professor, these are all music spells, am I right?\" Ye Futian asked.\"Okay, so you do know what they are. I used to be good at this specific kind of spell and, in fact, when I was young, people gave me the title of the Guqin Devil because my natal spirit was a guqin. Someone destroyed my natal spirit and totally prevented me from making any progress on my cultivation since then. Now, it's your turn to take over,\" Hua Fengliu said and sighed. Ye Futian was surprised. He had already known that the professor was a Mandate Sorcerer, but he never knew that his natal spirit had been destroyed.\"Don't ask me why, or try to avenge me. I just hope you cultivate hard enough to not to waste all the talents you have been granted.\" Hua Fengliu looked him in the eye and kept talking, \"This city is too small for you in the long term. Next year I believe you will reach the Glory Plane. Do you want to sail through the East Sea and go inland?\"\"My godfather asked me to leave here after I turn eighteen, but I still need to consult with my father and my godfather about this,\" Ye Futian responded.\"The new year is coming soon. You should get home. I'll tell Yu Sheng to go home when he gets back,\" Hua Fengliu told him.Ye Futian nodded a little reluctantly. He looked at Hua Jieyu and said, \"Fox, take care of your father after I'm gone.\"Hua Jieyu, however, felt angry. In fact, during the whole time this boy was living at their house she had done all the household work. Now he was just telling her to \"take care\"?\"Oh my, you're finally leaving.\" Hua Jieyu seemed excited.\"Hey, what's with the attitude?\" Ye Futian felt heart-broken.\"What do you think?\" Hua Jieyu laughed at him.\"I'm leaving now,\" Ye Futian told her.\"Okay.\" Hua Jieyu smiled.Ye Futian walked to the door and looked back at her. \"Seriously, I'm leaving.\"\"Just go.\" She was still smiling.Ye Futian sighed and waved to Mr. Hua. \"See you next year, Professor.\"Then he left for home.After he left, the room became quiet suddenly.Hua Fengliu shook his head with a wry smile and said, \"He made this place so lively, and now that he's gone, this silence almost feels unfamiliar.\"\"You're too into this boy, dad,\" Hua Jieyu joked to her dad.\"Then what about you?\" Hua Fengliu smiled at his daughter.\"Me?\" Hua Jieyu blinked her eyes and said, \"I'm happy that he left.\"\"The three years is up. Someone already came here from the City of Donghai to inform me. Actually, you might also have to leave after the new year.\" Hua Fengliu turned his eyes to the snow outside. He felt lost.Hua Jieyu was shocked. She was reluctant to leave her father. She looked at the lonely figure of her father and said, \"I don't want to leave. I want to stay here with you, dad.\"\"Silly girl, your mom is also missing you. Your family is not going to let you stay with me anymore. I am happy to have enjoyed your company over these three years.\" He patted his daughter on the head and kept speaking gently, \"You may never see Ye Futian again. Moments ago may have actually been the final farewell for you guys, and you were just making fun of him.\"Hua Jieyu was tremendously shocked. Several minutes ago the boy had left, and they were joking with each other. Now, it was their farewell?\"Jieyu, tell me, do you like this boy?\" Hua Fengliu suddenly asked her.\"What are you talking about, dad?\" Hua Jieyu was surprised again. She looked at her father, and it seemed that she was shy about answering this question, \"That's just impossible.\"\"Really?\" Hua Fengliu smiled at his daughter, \"You're turning sixteen this year. You do have the right to decide your future, including whom to be with. You have not experienced much, so you don't understand that there are things and people in this world that once you miss, you miss them forever. I do like that boy. He's smart and talented. It seems to me that he's not going to waste his talents. More importantly, he looks like a playboy, but he is truly devoted to love. I'm pretty sure he is the same as I was at his age. Make your own decisions. Don't miss someone you really love forever. Think about my words these days. Remember, life is short. Do not have any regrets.\"Hua Jieyu was dumbfounded by what her father had just said. She hadn't realized that she might miss someone forever!\"The boy has been spending so much of his time with you, and you just take it for granted. But if you disappear from each others' lives, another beautiful girl will appear in his. You are not a couple yet, so do not just think that you are the only one for him in this world.\" Hua Fengliu smiled and left his daughter alone. Hua Jieyu started to think about this seriously for the first time. The feeling was intense, but the concept of love seemed to be pretty faint and unfamiliar to her.She always felt annoyed when Ye Futian was around in the house. However, when he was suddenly gone, she actually felt as if something was lost and even needed time to adapt. Her father had told her that she could miss someone forever, and thinking about this indeed gave her a sense of fear. Fear of the thought that she had just lost something precious.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 31": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Legend of FutianCH 31Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe City of Qingzhou was an island city, located in the East Sea, surrounded by the water.On the vast ocean waters sailed a big ship, headed in the direction of Qingzhou City.On the deck stood multiple people suited in armor. They were a group of knights. There were three figures; a middle-aged man, one young man, and a young lady stood on the edge of the deck.The man looked dignified and imposing; the young man beside him was handsome, his eyes giving off a hint of evilness; and the young lady on his side looked cold and arrogant. However, her sex appeal was off the charts.\"So, this is the City of Qingzhou?\" the young man spoke while looking straight ahead.\"That's right. Qingzhou City is an island city in the East Sea, but because there are many similar island cities in the East Sea, it doesn't stand out. So, you've probably never heard of it before,\" explained the man.\"That's true. If it weren't for you, I never would have found out about this island city. Did someone like him really come from this small place?\" asked the young man, unable to believe this. Even though the young man has always been haughty, when they spoke of \"him\" he could not stop the fear-induced palpitations of his heart.\"The information we have should be accurate. We were able to find some traces from the history books found in the East Sea Prefecture. The only thing we don't know is if \"he\" left anything behind in Qingzhou City,\" said the man.\"Hopefully this won't be a wasted trip,\" said the young man, his lips curling into a smile. It was hard to imagine that the most legendary character in the Divine Prefectures of the East originated from this little island city.Emperor Ye Qing, a legend in the divine prefectures, along with the Great East Phoenix, ruled the divine prefectures for over three hundred years. He died suddenly fifteen years ago. His death is a mystery to this day. Nobody was brave enough to investigate the cause of his death, and his name had since become a taboo. However, traces he left behind in the East Sea Prefecture pointed to him leaving the prefecture and ending up in the City of Qingzhou.The ship sailed quickly, and as they got closer to shore, their view of Qingzhou City became clearer. On the shore stood many high authority figures. The City Lord and authoritative figures of the Murong Chamber of Commerce waited deferentially.....The people of Qingzhou City had no idea some very important people had arrived. Ye Futian was also oblivious to this.Walking down the familiar streets, the Ye House came into view. Ye Futian's steps relaxed. He had missed his family.\"Ye Futian is back!\" shouted a street vendor selling bing, a type of flat cake.\"Hello, Auntie She,\" greeted Ye Futian. Then, he turned to two older males playing chess not far away and called out, \"Uncle Wang, Grandpa Yun.\"\"Oh, you sweet boy. The Lin family's daughter is home. After the new year she'll be fifteen. She's looking prettier every day!\" laughed Uncle Wang.\"Uncle Lin, is Xiao Qing here?\" Ye Futian asked the shopkeeper of the restaurant next to where Uncle Wang and Grandpa Yun were playing chess.\"No, she's not here. You haven't been home in a while, hurry home!\" ushered Uncle Lin with a quick smile. He then turned to Uncle Wang with a glare.\"Ye Futian is home?\" a crisp voice rang throughout the restaurant.\"Go back to work, you brat,\" the shopkeeper reprimanded lowly. Ye Futian smiled and was on his way. He waved as he left, \"Xiao Qing, I'll come hang out another day!\"After he left, Uncle Wang said to Shopkeeper Lin, \"Hey Lin, Ye Futian is the young master of the Ye family. Shouldn't you be glad that he wants to hang out with your daughter?\"\"Excuse me, that little devil has never taken anything seriously. How many girls around here have fallen for his words already? How can I let my daughter be around him?\" Shopkeeper Lin looked worn. He pitied the man whose daughter would fall in love with that little devil.Ye Futian weaved through the streets and came upon a private residence, separate from other buildings. 'Ye' was engraved on the plaque above the main entrance.Two people stood guard on either side of the entrance. By the door was a white-haired, hunched figure. He looked out on to the streets and when he saw Ye Futian, his eyes lit up.\"Godfather,\" Ye Futian greeted the man. He made his way to the entrance of the residence in a light jog. \"What are you doing here, Godfather?\"Although his face did not look old, his white hair and hunched body made Ye Futian's godfather look oddly aged. He smiled at Ye Futian and said, \"It's already December. I thought it was about time you came up, so I was waiting here for you. By the way, why don't I see Yu Sheng with you?\"\"Yu Sheng is training on Mount Tianyao,\" explained Ye Futian. He walked closer to hold the older male by his arm. \"Godfather, your white hair has grown out even more.\"\"That's fine. I'm just happy and honored to see that you have grown up,\" smiled the old man.\"Godfather, you're talking nonsense again,\" Ye Futian did not know what to say when his godfather used the term 'honored.'\"What do you mean 'nonsense?' A day will come when you understand what I mean,\" said the old man. He smiled and continued, \"Come, now, let's go home.\"\"Okay, let's go!\" answered Ye Futian. With a skip in his step, he arrived at the courtyard. His father, Ye Baichan, said, \"You brat, you have finally come home? Is it already the end of the year? Where have you been? Picking on girls?\"Ye Futian was speechless. \"Pops, I just got back. Can't I get some fatherly love?\"\"Ye Futian, don't mind your father. Let me take a good look at you.\" A beautiful and elegant woman walked out. It was Ye Futian's mother, Ye Rou. It was said that Ye Rou was not originally from Qingzhou City. She had met Ye Baichuan when he was traveling around to gain experience. Later, when she had gotten pregnant with Ye Futian, they came back to Qingzhou City together.\"I don't know how you lucked out and ended up with such a beautiful, genial woman,\" sighed Ye Futian as he looked at his father.\"Do you want to get beaten? Let's see if you're capable of bringing home a woman as great as your mother,\" Ye Baichuan said as he walked up to stand next to his wife.\"That's an easy enough task for me, it's just that I don't want to do it,\" said Ye Futian without shame.\"Ye Futian, you're boasting again,\" a beautiful girl said from outside. She looked to be a little younger than Ye Futian. She walked towards Ye Futian and his parents. She was an equally beautiful woman. It was Ye Baichuan's younger sister, Ye Rong, and her daughter, Ye Xiaoqin, who had taken her mother's surname.Behind the two females were two more people. A middle-aged man was leading a young boy around the age of thirteen. They were Ye Baichuan's younger brother, Ye Dongliu, and his son, Ye Mo.\"Uncle; Auntie,\" greeted Ye Futian. Then he looked at the smiling girl and said, \"Are you itching to get hit, Ye Xiaoqin?\"Ye Xiaoqin hid behind her mother, \"You're bullying me again! Don't forget, your dad is watching you.\"The whole lot began to laugh. Ye Mo stepped up and said, \"Ye Futian, your dad said that you're really powerful now. Is that true?\"\"Of course it's true! I've been cultivating in martial and divination arts. I'm approaching the Glory Plane, and countless people at the academy look up to me!\" Ye Futian said with a smile.Ye Mo looked at Ye Futian with distaste as he said, \"I almost believed you.\"\"Same,\" Ye Xiaoqin chimed in.\"Ye Futian, enough with your lies. When are you going to bring a girl home? You better keep an eye on Feng Qingxue. She's pretty and talented; you might lose her to someone else,\" teased Ye Rong.\"Feng Qingxue...\" Ye Futian shook his head with a bitter smile. Seeing his reaction, everyone seemed to have everything figured out. It seemed like Ye Futian couldn't get her to be his.\"Alright now, it's rare to have the family gathered together like this, so let's go catch up while we eat,\" Ye Rou suggested. Everyone nodded in agreement, and they all headed for the dinner table. They chatted happily over a delicious meal that night.After dinner, people made their way back to their own homes. Ye Futian asked his father for a guqin and headed back to where he was staying. Not long after, the sounds of the instrument filled his room. Under the moonlight, everything seemed at peace.The next day, Yu Sheng returned. He was now officially in the Glory Plane of martial art cultivation. Ye Futian was very happy for him.In the blink of an eye it was the last day of the year. The night came, but Qingzhou City was illuminated with lights. The streets were buzzing, and the skies were decorated with fireworks.At the Ye House, there was an area occupied with the sounds of the guqin. One person was elegantly playing the guqin while another person at his side sat cultivating on the ground. However, at this moment, Yu Sheng opened his eyes to look at Ye Futian.Something did not seem right. The music stopped and Ye Futian lifted his head to stare at the moon, his mind was not at ease.\"Ye Futian,\" A white-haired elder walked in from the outside and looked at Ye Futian. \"This piece can put the mind at ease, yet you are restless. A messy mind results in a messy performance.\"\"I don't know what's going on either,\" said Ye Futian with a bitter smile.\"From your music, I could feel happiness, longing, and melancholy. You have truly grown up now,\" the elder said lightly. \"Who's the girl?\"\"Godfather!\" Ye Futian was shocked. He looked to Yu Sheng, only to see him shake his head in denial. He had not told his father about Ye Futian.\"So, there really was longing?\" questioned his godfather. Ye Futian shook his head with a bitter smile, \"Godfather, did I let you down by not focusing on what I was supposed to?\"\"Silly child, this is the journey to adulthood. Who in history hasn't been troubled with matters of love?\" asked the white-haired elder. He approached Ye Futian's side and continued, \"I'm not opposed to you dating but she should be worthy of your love. You must remember, your other half will become a motherly model to the nation in the future.\"Ye Futian lifted his head to look at the elder. Naturally, Ye Futian knew that his godfather held high hopes for him since childhood. His hopes for Ye Futian were so high that they exceeded his own expectations.\"Godfather, I'm afraid of letting you down,\" Ye Futian said quietly.\"Believe in yourself, just like I believe in you,\" the elder said as he patted Ye Futian's shoulder. \"Let's go, your family is waiting for you. The guests from the Feng family have also arrived.\"\"Okay. Yu Sheng, let's go together,\" Ye Futian said to Yu Sheng.\"Yu Sheng, you stay. I have something I want to talk to you about,\" said the elder.\"Alright,\" Ye Futian nodded and left the quarters. After his departure, a gust of wind shut the doors of Ye Futian's living quarters. The elder looked at Yu Sheng, \"Show me your Life Spirit.\"Yu Sheng stood and focused. His eyes glowed fearfully with a bright light and a course of energy radiated from his body fiercely. The Spiritual Qi in the surrounding area began to flow crazily. A suit of armor appeared on his body and his Life Spirit appeared. Right now, Yu Sheng was godlike.\"That's good enough,\" nodded the elder. Yu Sheng withdrew his Life Spirit, the look in his eyes returned to normal.\"Yu Sheng, you must remember, you will forever be Ye Futian's deadliest weapon and his sturdiest shield. There will come a day when your name will be written down in the history books,\" urged the elder. Yu Sheng was not sure he completely understood his father's words. All he knew was that he would forever protect Ye Futian and it was not only because his father told him to do so.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Feng Ruhai's family came to visit as well. Even though the two families had been good friends for decades, it was the first time Feng Ruhai had come to visit on New Year's Eve.\"Uncle Feng,\" Ye Futian greeted Feng Ruhai, then sat in between Ye Xiaoqin and Ye Mo.\"You will officially be sixteen years old after tonight, Ye Futian. You look more and more handsome,\" Feng Ruhai complimented. As a result of the constant cultivation that Ye Futian was going through, he now looked more charming than ever. He had become a thin young man with a handsome face, like a model.Feng Qingxue kept looking at Ye Futian from afar. She still couldn't forget what had happened at the academy one month before, when the young man had been standing with another beautiful girl in the snow, and they fought against the authority together. Ye Futian had used to make fun of her all the time, and she had believed that this boy would be around her forever. But now, there was a certain distance between them.What if\u2026 she had never talked to Ye Futian in that horrible manner?\"This boy has only inherited about thirty percent of my looks,\" Ye Baichuan said. \"But Qingxue is growing ever more beautiful, she's just too gorgeous to be your blood,\" Ye Baichuan joked. Feng Ruhai was speechless, so he gave Ye Baichuan a stare.\"Stop boasting. Why have these kids not gotten engaged?\" Ye Rong, Ye Futian's aunt, smiled and cut into the conversation.Ye Futian was shocked by this while panic flashed across Feng Qingxue's eyes. She lowered her head to avoid the glances cast on her.Feng Ruhai looked at Ye Futian, and Ye Rong kept talking, \"Brother, why are you looking at him? I know this boy so well. Really, he would be laughing all night if Qingxue said yes to this engagement.\"\"Yes, yes, Ye Futian loves beautiful girls.\" Ye Xiaoqin was speaking for her mother.\"Looks like you're getting lucky, bro.\" Ye Mo mumbled to Ye Futian. Ye Futian felt awkward that no one had even bothered to ask what his opinion was.\"Qingxue, my girl, what do you say?\" Ye Rong looked at Feng Qingxue. Feng Qingxue's face turned red from all the attention. She snuck a look at Ye Futian and soon was reminded of the time when another girl was standing up for Ye Futian. She suddenly felt disappointed and shook her head, \"He's too good for me, Aunt Ye.\"She had just rejected the suggestion.Ye Rong was a bit embarrassed but she smiled and said, \"It's fine. You're still young, and there is enough time for you to foster your relationship.\"\"Nah, it's not happening.\" Ye Xiaoqin was trying to relieve her cousin.\"That's too bad, bro.\" Ye Mo mumbled to his cousin.\"Futian, you need to work harder, and I believe Qingxue will finally accept you someday,\" Ye Dongliu, Ye Futian's uncle, also said. They all thought that Ye Futian had just been rejected by the girl. Ye Futian remained silent and nodded. Actually, he didn't care about what the others were thinking.Soon, someone approached the Ye home. A guard from the house came in with a message. \"Someone is looking for Mr. Ye Futian outside the door.\"\"For me?\" Ye Futian had no idea who it was.\"Go ahead,\" Ye Baichuan told him.\"Sure,\" Ye Futian nodded and followed the guard.After he left, Ye Rong started talking with Feng Qingxue again, \"Qingxue, you guys have grown up together for so many years. Just give him some time and a chance to prove himself.\"Feng Qingxue was now even more embarrassed. Still, she was curious about who was waiting outside.Right at that moment, Ye Futian stepped out of the door, he recognized the gorgeous figure waiting outside quietly. He was so surprised that suddenly a bright smile showed up on his face: \"Wow, you missed me?\"Hua Jieyu glared at him and said, \"Dad told me that the city would be lively tonight, so I thought I should go out for a walk. I noticed that this is the Ye's place, so I was wondering if it was your home. It looks like I guessed right.\"\"Wow, such a coincidence.\" Ye Futian fluttered his lashes, and he looked at the girl with a weird expression like he was concealing his laughter. Deep inside, he felt really surprised by this unexpected visit.\"Mind if I join you for the walk?\" Ye Futian asked.\"I'm right outside your home. Why don't you be a friendly host and invite me inside?\" The cute manner in which Hua Jieyu asked the question almost melted Ye Futian's heart.\"Uh\u2026\" Ye Futian was surprised by this offer. Bringing a girl home on New Year's Eve was like...meeting the parents for an engagement?\"You're not willing to?\" Hua Jieyu asked with a smile, sensing the boy's embarrassment.\"How could I say no? Even if you're ugly, I would still be willing to bring you to meet my family.\" Ye Futian was picking on her, and Hua Jieyu pretended that she was mad about the joke.She smiled at Ye Futian and condensed the power around her again: \"Ugly? Huh?\"\"Gentlemen never fight!\" Ye Futian felt the threat in her gesture. He turned back and ran.\"Am I a ugly? Tell me!\" Hua Jieyu chased after him, laughing.\"Fine, what if I call you my pretty wife?\" Ye Futian responded.\"Ye Futian!\"They ran away.The guards exchanged glances. One said with awe, \"Jesus, he's so good with girls.\"\"Too good,\" another guy agreed.This fairy-like girl just asked to meet the parents? They realized that being shameless was somehow attractive to girls, even beautiful ones like Hua Jieyu.Hua Jieyu and Ye Futian walked into the feast together. Hua Jieyu asked him, \"Is your whole family here for New Years?\"\"Yes, it's our tradition.\" Ye Futian nodded, and soon they were beside the table. People in the room were quite shocked that Ye Futian had brought a gorgeous girl to the table at this specific moment.\"What a beautiful girl!\" Ye Mo was shocked by his cousin.Ye Rong blinked. She looked at Hua Jieyu, then Feng Qingxue. She had to admit that the newcomer was so much more beautiful.Feng Qingxue had never imagined that Hua Jieyu would just show up at the Ye family's home at that particular moment, in such a meaningful situation. She felt extremely disappointed. She lowered her head and clenched the hem of her skirt in her hands.\"Futian, introduce the girl please,\" Ye Rong said.\"This is Hua Jieyu,\" Ye Futian started introducing, \"She is\u2026 Uh\u2026 My professor's daughter.\"\"Professor's daughter?\"The people smiled and some type of 'understanding' showed in their eyes. Hua Jieyu's cheeks turned a bit hot and even felt a little panic but she did not reject this feeling. In fact, she even felt happy about it.\"Why are you still standing there? Come have a seat.\" Ye Baichuan soon recognized who she was. He had a feeling that something was going on between this girl and his son when they had met after the Fall Quarter Exam. However, he never anticipated that his son was good enough to successfully bring her back home in such a short time.Ye Mo gave his spot to Hua Jieyu so that she could sit next to Ye Futian. After the introduction, Hua Jieyu started greeting the family members one by one in a sweet manner.Ye Futian was surprised. She had never treated him in such a manner before.\"Hey, Ye Futian, how did you manage to trick her into coming here?\" Ye Xiaoqin asked her cousin.\"My amazing looks, obviously.\" Ye Futian smiled at his cousin. Ye Xiaoqin looked at her cousin with contempt. No matter how handsome he was, the girl sitting next to him had no match. In fact, Ye Xiaoqin never imagined that there could be a girl as beautiful as Hua Jieyu.After sitting down, Hua Jieyu did nothing but sit there quietly. However, the whole atmosphere had changed since her arrival. Soon after, Feng Qingxue mumbled to her father, \"Dad, I'm full now. Let's just go home.\"\"Okay,\" Feng Ruhai nodded. Then the Feng family said goodbye and left. Ye Rong noticed that Feng Qingxue's eyes avoided the boy and girl sitting together. She suddenly realized that what Feng Qingxue had said was right, rather than an excuse for rejection.\"Dad, Mom, I'm going to take Jieyu out for a walk,\" Ye Futian said.\"Sure, go ahead. Take care of her,\" Ye Baichuan responded.\"Sure, we will,\" Ye Futian answered, then they left the house together.Colorful fireworks were everywhere above the city, and the area of Qingzhou Lake had the best view of them all. People were rafting in the lake, some of them families, and others couples. The restaurants on the shore were full of people. All of them were enjoying the beautiful scenery while drinking.\"It's beautiful here.\" Hua Jieyu and Ye Futian had come to a stop. While looking at the scenery around them, the happiness could be read in the girl's eyes.\"It is not as beautiful as you are,\" Ye Futian said. Hua Jieyu gave him a spiteful glance, but deep inside she was happy from being complimented like this. She had never felt this unique happiness before.This was apparently the first awakening of love for the sixteen-year-old girl.Hua Jieyu walked all around the place. There was a lot of entertainment going on. Lantern riddles, magic tricks\u2026 Ye Futian kept following her. The cute smile on her face suddenly melted all the depression he had had these days. He finally realized that he could not be at peace without her. They had only spent three months together, but it was such a joyful time that they were already attached to each other without realizing it.On the shore of the lake, Hua Jieyu saw many tourists placing wish lanterns onto the water. She bought one, put it on the lake, closed her eyes, and made her wish.\"I'm done,\" she opened her eyes and told Ye Futian.\"What was your wish?\" Ye Futian asked.\"I'm not telling you,\" Hua Jieyu smiled at him. Then she looked at the sky, where the bright fireworks show was going on, and mumbled to Ye Futian, \"Are we in a relationship now?\"Uh\u2026\" Ye Futian hesitated. He had not expected to be asked like this. \"What kind of relationship?\" Ye Futian blinked his eyes.Hua Jieyu looked up at the sky rather than at Ye Futian. But in the next moment, Ye Futian felt a tender hand touch his arm as if looking for something.Ye Futian reached over and grabbed the hand. A smile appeared on his lips. Feeling the softness of the hand, he squeezed it a little.Hua Jieyu blushed. She mumbled, \"That kind of relationship .\"Ye Futian closed his eyes, then opened them again. Together,\u00a0they enjoyed the bright fireworks together, holding hands, like all happy couples would do.It was the first time Ye Futian realized that a fox could be so cute and silly!It seemed like time had stopped and everything had fallen silent. Neither of them spoke to the other. However, Ye Futian believed that the smile on Hua Jieyu's face was even brighter than the fireworks.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 33": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Legend of FutianCH 33Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe two coasts of Lake Qinghai were where the best restaurants in the city were. All of them had a picturesque view of the water.There was a group of people seated at the best table in one of those restaurants, enjoying the beautiful sight.Murong Qiu sat amongst this group. However, he was just a side character. Seated at the same table were people of a higher position than him.At the head of the table was a young man, Xia Fan. He was a big character from the East Sea Prefecture and beside him sat the son of the City Lord, Wei Feng.\"Murong Qiu, any news from Mount Tianyao?\" asked Xia Fan.\"Our people are still clearing the mountains. We got some news this afternoon saying that they found a mysterious area. It's possible that something could be hidden there,\" Murong Qiu reported.\"If this goes on, my people will have to be buried on Mount Tianyao. Shouldn't both of our groups send some more people over?\" suggested Xia Fan.\"I will bring it up with my father when I return,\" said Murong Qiu. Wei Feng also nodded in agreement.\"Okay,\" said Xia Fan. He then added, \"I hope you were not mistaken.\"\"The Pavilion Lord of the Earth Elemental Pavilion is my father's. My younger brother and I took care of everything personally. There's no way I could have been mistaken; there was definitely something that looked like a dragon at Mount Tianyao,\" Murong Qiu reassured him.\"Alright.\" Xia Fan turned his attention to outside the window. As fireworks filled the sky, two figures by the lake stood out to him. He was captivated by the girl's beauty. He pointed in their direction and asked, \"Who are they?\"Murong Qiu looked over. His face frowned when he saw who Xia Fan was pointing at.\"Hua Jieyu, the daughter of Qingzhou City's ace, Hua Fengliu, and Ye Futian. He used to be a disciple of Qingzhou Academy, but left after rebelling against the academy. He is now Hua Fengliu's disciple,\" Murong Qiu explained.\"Hua Fengliu? As in the Qin Devil Hua Fengliu?\" asked the man sitting beside Xia Fan.\"My father did some research on him. He really is known as the Qin Devil in the City of Donghai,\" Murong Qiu replied.\"If this is true, then that must be the daughter of Hua Fengliu and 'her,'\" the man went into deep thought.\"He's the one who had his powers disabled by the Art Saint?\" Xia Fan began to show interest. He would never have expected to meet such a legendary character from Donghai City here.\"That's right,\" confirmed the man. \"That girl is a member of 'that family,' so it's best if you don't try anything with her. It'll only be trouble.\"He knew exactly what type of person Xia Fan was and felt the need to warn him.\"I know my limits. Let's go say hello,\" said Xia Fan. He smiled, then got up and began walking out of the restaurant. The man followed behind him, as did the rest of the group. They all left the restaurant and headed toward Ye Futian and Hua Jieyu.At this moment, Ye Futian and Hua Jieyu were enjoying the view but something felt amiss. They turned their heads and saw the lot headed in their direction. Ye Futian noticed Murong Qiu amongst them and was curious as to what he was up to.\"Miss Hua Jieyu, I am Xia Fan of the East Sea Prefecture,\" Xia Fan stopped in front of Hua Jieyu, his devilish eyes could not hide his admiration for her. No female he had ever met could compare to her beauty.\"Can I help you with something?\" Hua Jieyu's tone was cold and aloof.\"I've always admired the Qin Devil's skills but have not had the honor of meeting him in person. To be able to run into you here is such an honor. Sorry to have disturbed you but if you are willing, please come join us at the restaurant for a meal,\" said Xia Fan. His smile was warm and inviting. Ye Futian furrowed his brows, he was completely invisible to this guy.\"No,\" said Hua Jieyu. Even though she was smiling, one could feel that she was trying to distance herself.Besides Xia Fan, everyone had a strange look on their faces. Was she really going to be so blunt with him?\"I shall be excused then.\" It took a minute for Xia Fan to speak again. As soon as he turned his back, the smile on his face disappeared, replaced with a stone-cold demeanor.\"Mood ruined,\" complained Ye Futian. His hand reached out to try and grab Hua Jieyu's.\"What are you trying to do?\" asked Hua Jieyu. She laughed and pulled her hand away.\"I thought our relationship was now confirmed,\" said Ye Futian innocently.\"Yeah, hasn't our relationship already been confirmed?\" teased Hua Jieyu.\"Fox, how can you do this to me?\" Ye Futian felt wronged. So, he couldn't touch her now that they're dating?\"Doing what to you?\" laughed Hua Jieyu. \"Now that we're dating, you are forbidden from flirting with other girls. Also, you have to come to me, no matter where I am.\"\"No, our relationship hasn't reached that point yet,\" Ye Futian felt like he was being scammed.\"Just you try! Father said that you're not trustworthy, and told me to hurry home. I have to go back,\" Hua Jieyu looked at Ye Futian. She did not want to leave him. They were going to have to part tomorrow. Would he be upset at her for leaving?Ye Futian looked sad. Hua Jieyu could not bear to see him like this. She reached her hand out to him.However, Ye Futian did not take her hand. He continued to look at her, \"Do you really have to leave?\"Hua Jieyu knew when Ye Futian said \"leave,\" he did not simply mean their parting right now.\"Parting ways after falling in love with one another, followed by a long journey to reunite. I never imagined my love life to be so melodramatic. Don't you think you're being a little unfair to me?\" Ye Futian searched for something in her eyes. He obviously knew the kind of person she was after having spent months together. Even after realizing her feelings for him, there was no way she would pursue him actively. Plus, after what she had said before, Ye Futian knew exactly what was going on.Hua Jieyu had a sad look in her eyes. She looked down when she felt her eyes begin to water. She did not know how to explain it to him.\"What do you want me to do?\" she whispered, lifting her head to meet his eyes once again.Looking down at her flawless face and puppy dog eyes, Ye Futian felt his heart melt. \"If it's going to be melodramatic, so be it. Who told me to fall for a fox?\"The power of beauty was so great.Hearing his words, she smiled, and her mood picked up. She looked at Ye Futian and said softly, \"Okay, I'll make it up to you. What if I don't leave tonight and stay with you?\"\"Umm... Aren't we going a little too fast?\" asked Ye Futian, bright-eyed. Tonight? Stay with him?Upon seeing the perverted look on his face, Hua Jieyu lifted her foot to stomp on Ye Futian. \"What kind of dirty thoughts are you having? I didn't mean it like that.\"\"Like what?\" Ye Futian blinked at her innocently.\"You...I regret everything I just said,\" she said. Before she could turn to leave, Ye Futian grabbed her by the arm and said, \"I'll walk you back.\"\"Okay,\" Hua Jieyu nodded quietly, not trying to fight him on the subject. She let Ye Futian take her hand as they walked.\"Let's go take a boat,\" said Ye Futian. She nodded again, and they walked to the dock. After boarding the boat, they sailed down Lake Qinghai.On the lake were many other boats. The surface of the water reflected the sky, lit up with fireworks. The couple sat next to each other at the front of the boat, leaning on one another like a picture, which attracedg looks of admiration from passengers on passing boats.From across the water, a boat occupied by several people approached them. Two of them were shocked to see Ye Futian and Hua Jieyu.\"General Qin; Senior Sister Qin Yi,\" Ye Futian called out to greet them.General Qin was dressed casually. He looked like any ordinary person, spending New Year's Eve with his family. Seeing who Ye Futian was with, General Qin gave him a thumbs-up.\"How romantic,\" teased Qin Yi.Ye Futian chuckled as if he was caught doing something wrong. Another boat floated past them and they heard someone say, \"Senior Sister, you have a really nice figure!\"By reflex, Ye Futian nodded and he hummed in agreement. He realized what he had just done immediately and turned towards Hua Jieyu, only to see her smiling wryly at him.\"But I still like you better,\" he blurted out quickly.She huffed and turned away from him to stare ahead. Next, she felt an arm wrap around her waist. At first, she froze but then her body relaxed, tilting toward him and she laid her head on his shoulder. At that moment, everything was peaceful and beautiful. They felt closer than they ever had.By the time Ye Futian and Hua Jieyu made their way back to her residence at Qingzhou Academy, it was already late at night. Compared to the busy city streets, the campus was dead silent. Hua Fengliu had already gone to sleep.Stepping into her room, Hua Jieyu realized Ye Futian was still following behind her and her face flushed red.\"You're not going to kick me out this late at night, are you? It's dangerous out there,\" Ye Futian got his words in before Hua Jieyu could say anything. When he saw how hard she was glaring at him, he added, \"Do you have the heart to do that?\"\"You have your own room,\" she said to the shameless young man.\"You're leaving tomorrow. I just want to spend a little more time with you. I don't even know when I'm going to be able to see you again,\" he told her in a soft voice. Even though Hua Jieyu knew he was just trying to sweet talk her, her heart still softened. She'd allow this as compensation.Walking next to the bed, she took off her outerwear, revealing her curvaceous figure. Ye Futian's eyes lit up. Hua Jieyu chuckled as she watched him. \"How's my figure?\"\"Perfect,\" answered Ye Futian, feeling a bit warm.Hua Jieyu felt proud. She then climbed in between her sheets and had her back facing him as she blushed hard.What a tease! complained Ye Futian. Women really did hold grudges...\"I can't see you this way,\" said Ye Futian but Hua Jieyu ignored him. However, she turned around to face him moments later and said, \"Stay there, don't come any closer.\"After that, she closed her eyes and tried to fall asleep.Ye Futian sat there quietly and admired her beauty. Looking at her brought him warmth.It seemed like a long time had passed when Hua Jieyu opened her eyes again to find that Ye Futian was still watching her. Gently, she whispered, \"I can't fall asleep.\"\"Let me play a song for you,\" he said lovingly. He left his seat, and seconds later the sound of the guqin floated into her room.It was peaceful and serene. The song flowed beautifully, full of love, but also with a hint of sadness. Hua Jieyu closed her eyes once again and drifted off to sleep. Quietly, two streams of tears rolled off her smiling face.So, this was love. The warmth of a first love, the fluttering of your heart when he held your hand, and the sadness of parting....Divine Prefecture Calendar, Year 10000. The morning of the first day of the new year.A large black eagle descended upon Qingzhou Academy. It waited outside of Hua Fengliu's residence. Inside, Hua Jieyu was getting ready. Dressed in a long green dress, she lived up to her name as a goddess. Her beautiful smile never left her face.As she approached the entrance of the residence, she looked back at Ye Futian. He was still playing the guqin. However, his eyes were fixed on her. They looked into each other's eyes and shared a smile. The look they shared bore a million unsaid words.There was no promise to be together forever; no promises of \"till death do us part;\" just one smile. After that, Hua Jieyu left. She settled atop the black eagle and then was off into the sky. Very quickly, they disappeared into the clouds.Ye Futian continued to play his instrument. Beside him, a handsome figure dressed in white stood silently and watched Ye Futian.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He sighed with a particular sadness. He felt empty deep inside after his fox was gone.\"Stop your fake sadness. The City of Qingzhou belongs to East Sea Prefecture, and the City of Donghai is the capital. You can get there simply by sailing through the East Sea, and I don't believe that you don't know this.\" Hua Fengliu looked at Ye Futian and said, \"I know you'll leave once you reach the Glory Plane. With your talent and effort, it would be several months at most. Don't tell me you have no interest in this.\"\"Uh\u2026\" Ye Futian blinked his eyes and looked at Hua Fengliu. \"As much as you already know, could you please just save me some honor? To reveal my plan like this makes me sound like a horrible person.\"\"How far did you go last night?\" Hua Fengliu asked Ye Futian with a smirk.Ye Futian felt really embarrassed and stressed. He had finally realized there was a difference between a professor and a father-in-law. Apparently, Mr. Hua was transitioning between the two roles smoothly.His embarrassment actually made Hua Fengliu laugh. He told Ye Futian, \"Just stay here until you reach the Glory Plane. You'll make it soon.\"\"Sure, Pro\u2014 father-in-law.\" Ye Futian understood Mr. Hua's plan. Now his professor was supervising him on behalf of his girlfriend, and the only way to regain freedom was to reach the Glory Plane.\"You glib-tongued boy,\" Hua Fengliu smiled at him and said, \"I will teach you the songs I gave you before.\"\"Yes, sir.\" Ye Futian nodded. Since this man was going to be his father-in-law, there was no reason not to obey his orders.Time passed by and the students of Qingzhou Academy came back to school after the break. Yu Sheng went to Mr. Hua's place to look for Ye Futian. Sometimes they went to Mount Tianyao for cultivation, sometimes they practiced songs in the yard.One day, Ye Futian was sitting in the pavilion with his eyes closed. Suddenly, he felt that something was happening in his soul. He focused and all the fire-element Spiritual Qi of the universe gathered into a scarlet form around his body.It was dusk, and the orange sunlight fell on his body. Ye Futian started freedom meditation to perceive the vast essence of the universe. Soon after, constant flames concentrated over his body. It was not merely just Spiritual Qi at all. In fact, it had taken solid form, and the space around Ye Futian was turned into flaming territory.\"Now his Spiritual Qi comes into form.\" Hua Fengliu happened to pass by and noticed the new progress made by Ye Futian. He smiled, genuinely pleased and proud.Ye Futian opened his eyes. He laughed and mumbled, \"That's the Glory Plane of Sorcery for me.\"\"Professor,\" he greeted Hua Fengliu.\"Since you have reached a new level of sorcery, the next step should be to break through in your martial arts,\" Hua Fengliu smiled and told him, then gave Ye Futian a letter. \"Hua Jieyu sent it.\"\"Fox sent me a letter?\" Ye Futian's eyes twinkled. He snatched the letter and could not wait to open it.The letter said, \"You lecherous boy, I dare you not to flirt, or even talk, with other girls while I am away. I know it's just unfair to you that I had to leave. But I promise you that when you come to Donghai city, I will compensate you for everything, big time.\"\"Compensate me for everything?\" Ye Futian felt excited about this \"everything.\" He could not stop thinking about Hua Jieyu's beautiful face and her curvy body that he saw the night before she left. In fact, he almost wanted to leave now.This girl knew him so well that she was throwing him a daring temptation.\"How do you want to reply?\" Hua Fengliu smiled at Ye Futian.\"Professor, you peeked at the letter before giving it to me, didn't you?\" Ye Futian demanded when he saw Hua Fengliu's eyes. On the envelope of the letter was written: \"Ye Futian's eyes only.\"\"Huh, why do you think that I would do that?\" Hua Fengliu tried to sound harsh.However, it didn't work at all. The way Ye Futian looked at him indicated that he didn't believe him at all.\"The messenger bird is still here. Reply soon, or I'll let her go,\" Hua Fengliu changed the topic. Ye Futian was frustrated. His professor was shameless too.\"Help me reply and just say 'Fox, wait for me,'\" Ye Futian told Hua Fengliu because he didn't dare add anything else to the reply, since it was apparently being monitored by his father-in-law.\"Okay.\" Hua Fengliu smiled and left. This snooping had severely damaged the image of his greatness in Ye Futian's mind.Bang, bang\u2026 Someone was stomping on the ground outside. Ye Futian felt like it was almost as strong as an earthquake. Soon, he saw it was Yu Sheng who was charging into the place. He was running so fast that his harsh steps actually cracked the ground.\"What's going on?\" Ye Futian knew that there must be a reason for him to be in such a rush.\"A monster tide is coming.\" Yu Sheng was serious.Ye Futian was shocked by this news. According to the historical profile, there had been several monster tides over the course of the city's history, and every one of them had been considered catastrophic. Countless people died because of these disasters. The tide stopped three hundred years ago when the nation was unified. In fact, the main reason that Qingzhou Academy was built near Mount Tianyao was to prevent the monster tide. Fortunately, a monster tide had not come once during the last three hundred years. It had been such a long time that people had almost forgotten how horrifying it was.Hua Fengliu heard what he said, and he suddenly rushed to Yu Sheng's side. \"Yu Sheng, are you sure that this is a monster tide?\"\"Definitely,\" Yu Sheng nodded, \"And it was possibly manmade. I actually saw some powerful sorcerers driving the monster herd.\"\"Man-made?\" Ye Futian and Hua Fengliu felt terrible about this. The people who had started this monster tide were committing such a serious felony. If the monster herd in Mount Tianyao broke out of the restricted area, thousands of people would die.\"I will inform the academy. Ye Futian, go find General Qin and his daughter,\" Hua Fengliu commanded.Ye Futian nodded. He knew that the Dark Kylin Knighthood under the command of General Qin was the most reliable force to help guard the city. If there was indeed a monster tide coming to the city, the force of Dark Kylin Knighthood needed to be activated.They didn't even think about seeking any help from the City Lord. He had been nominated by the provincial government and was not a native of the city. It was possible he would be the first one to leave when such a crisis came.Hua Fengliu hurried to the academy right after he made the command.\"Let's move,\" Ye Futian told Yu Sheng. They left the house, then ran to the location of the Dark Kylin Knighthood.The official students and general students of Qingzhou Academy were located in different regions. The areas for the cultivation of martial arts and divination arts were also separate.The School of Martial Arts was located on the mountainside. The arrival of Ye Futian and Yu Sheng quickly raised a lot of attention. They had become quite famous even among the official students. In fact, most of the students had witnessed the fight when Heiyan Academy intruded and challenged them.\"Why are you here?\" someone asked.\"I'm here for Ms. Qin. Do you know where she is?\" Ye Futian said.\"Looks like it's an emergency.\" The student looked at Ye Futian, \"However, since you have quit the academy, you are not allowed to enter according to the rules.\"\"This is urgent,\" Ye Futian insisted.The student realized that Ye Futian was here to warn of something serious, then he said, \"I saw Ms. Qin go to the place of the Dark Kylin. I guess she was going to hone her riding and archery skills. Go ahead and find her.\"\"Thanks,\" Ye Futian responded, then ran to the practice area of the Dark Kylin Knighthood. However, on his way there, some people blocked him. Mo Lanshan looked at Ye Futian with contempt and said, \"This is the School of Martial Arts. You are not allowed to enter this place. Leave now.\"\"I have an emergency for Ms. Qin. A monster tide is coming to the city.\" Ye Futian remembered this guy. The first time his natal spirit awakened, Mo Lanshan had invited Yu Sheng to join the Dark Kylin, and then tried to humiliate Ye Futian badly. A student from the School of Sorcery had once told Ye Futian that Mo Lanshan had feelings for Ms. Qin. It looked like he was jealous now.\"A monster tide hasn't occurred for more than three hundred years in this city. How could this be true without even a slight sign? Even if it was true, how are you the first one to see it coming? Stop trying to look for Qin Yi with such a lame excuse, boy,\" Mo Lanshan responded in a cold voice. When he was with Qin Yi, he had always talked maliciously about Ye Futian, but what Ye Futian had done just made him look like a total fool. Qin Yi had a bone to pick with him because of his contempt for Ye Futian.What was intolerable for him was that Ye Futian used to flirt with Qin Yi so often. They had even hugged\u2026\"I have no time for games with you. Back off.\" Ye Futian meant it. He knew that Yu Sheng would not give a false alarm for such an emergency. If the city were unprepared for the monster tide, buildings would be wiped out, and thousands would die.Mo Lanshan was humiliated by Ye Futian's attitude. He believed that Ye Futian was embarrassing him only because of his contempt in the past.\"People say that Hua Jieyu has left the city. No wonder you're so desperate. Even someone as talented as you can't be matched with a perfect beauty like her, am I right? And you just changed your target?\" Mo Lanshan started to humiliate Ye Futian, believing that Ye Futian was after Qin Yi because he had failed to pursue Hua Jieyu.Bang! Yu Sheng stomped on the ground, a frenzy of energy all around his body. The group around Mo Lanshan frowned at Yu Sheng, and they prepared to fight. Someone said, \"This is our place. You better not try to fight us here.\"Ye Futian stared at Mo Lanshan. He was determined, knowing that it was the only way to solve this meaningless quarrel.\"Yu Sheng, are you ready?\" Ye Futian asked.\"Sure,\" Yu Sheng nodded.Ye Futian gave a simple order. \"Go!\"As soon as he finished the command, Yu Sheng charged right toward the group to attack them.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 35": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Legend of FutianCH 35Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAs Yu Sheng took a few steps forward, a golden force field surrounded him, just like golden armor.Mo Lanshan and his people looked very serious. Everyone charged at Yu Sheng with long spears gripped tightly in their hands.A loud explosion erupted from a single punch from Yu Sheng. Even his fist that he used to enclose the tip of an attacking spear was golden. The point of the weapon was enveloped by his fist when a cracking sound was heard. The point had been broken off by the enormous amount of strength exerted by Yu Sheng.Ye Futian continued to charge forward. He had no time to waste on these people.However, Mo Lanshan had no intentions of letting him pass. Avoiding Yu Sheng, Mo Lanshan aimed his ice-frosted spear at Ye Futian.Ye Futian did not slow down his steps. While in a light sprint, he reached out both of his hands. In a second, bursts of lightning flashed around him.With the movement of his hands, a storm of lightning and thunder was projected toward Mo Lanshan.\"Excursive Sorcery. You're a Glory Plane sorcerer,\" knights observing the battle were shocked. The speed in which Ye Futian was cultivating was unbelievable.Sorcerers had a natural advantage in battles with knights. Even though Mo Lanshan was a three-starred Glory Plane knight, he still did not dare underestimate his opponents, especially if it was Ye Futian.The intent of battle flowed through the spear, forming a white light around the weapon. Mo Lanshan waved his spear around, and the white light enlarged to cascade around his body; but it was no use against Ye Futian's storm attacks. However, his defensive spear spell was able to create an impenetrable force field around him.Ye Futian still did not stop proceeding. He was closing in on Mo Lanshan. As a sorcerer, he was supposed to keep his distance while battling with a knight but he chose to ignore this rule. It was easy to tell how confident he was.\"How presumptuous!\" Mo Lanshan looked a bit embarrassed. Then, he saw Ye Futian swipe downwards. Almost simultaneously, the thunderous force formed into a flash of lightning, cutting straight through his force field.A spell, the Thunder Lash. Even though it was only an Awakening level spell, when used by Ye Futian, it was different. It collected an enormous amount of thunderous force and contained the powers of the Glory Plane. To add to this, Ye Futian was a Mandate Sorcerer. His ability to perceive these spells was naturally stronger than others. When he applied these things to his spells, every attack he made would be more powerful than that of others in the same plane.The lash continued cutting down, the spear in Mo Lanshan's hand shook and was ready to take on the lash.However, at that same moment, Ye Futian's body became engulfed in flames. Raging flames were radiating off his body and made their way towards Mo Lanshan. Another spell, the Burning of Silence. Although it exhausted a large amount of Fire Elemental Spiritual Qi, it's destructiveness was frightening. It was considered a close-range spell.The look on Mo Lanshan's face changed drastically. He quickly summoned all the Spiritual Qi in his body and created a force field. It acted as an armor to protect him against the attack of the Burning of Silence. Ye Futian's attacks were so quick that it made it difficult for Mo Lanshan to retaliate. The Burning of Silence was a spell feared by bi-elemental sorcerers because it was able to continuously release spells of different elements for a short period of time.BOOM! A fist came down on Mo Lanshan's poorly defended head. He was propelled directly to the ground, blood gushing violently from his wound.Ye Futian simply stepped over Mo Lanshan's body, not even bothering to spare him a glance. Onlookers felt bad for Mo Lanshan. Though Ye Futian had not said a single insulting word, his disregard for Mo Lanshan was even more insulting.Sorcerers were, indeed, stronger than cultivators of martial arts; but Ye Futian was not exactly an ordinary sorcerer.When the bystanders looked back to the other battle going on, they saw that Yu Sheng had defeated multiple high-leveled martial arts cultivators. They were confused. Yu Sheng was not using any sorcery, just the pure power of martial arts.These two were monsters!When Ye Futian made it to the training grounds, he saw Qin Yi sitting on top of a black qilin, practicing archery. Qin Yi gave off an air of valiance with her hair tied up. Her figure looked extraordinary in the tightly fitted clothing she wore but Ye Futian was in no mood to stop and admire this view. He called out to her, \"Senior Sister Qin.\"She followed his voice and was confused to see him. She dismounted the black qilin and jogged towards Ye Futian. Still a distance away from him she asked, \"What are you doing here?\"\"There may be a monster tide erupting on Mount Tianyao. You should inform General Qin as soon as possible,\" said Ye Futian.Her gaze froze and her face fell. She then sprinted towards the black qilin and mounted the creature. As they were about to pass by Ye Futian, she said, \"Hop on, we'll talk as we go.\"Something sparked in his eyes and he got on behind Qin Yi without hesitation.\"What happened?\" asked Qin Yi, worried. A monster tide could only mean calamity.\"Yu Sheng has been training on Mount Tianyao and noticed it,\" replied Ye Futian.Qin Yi looked serious and said, \"Hold onto me.\"\"Ugh...\" Ye Futian hesitated but eventually grabbed onto her when he lost his balance as the black qilin rose into the air. He smiled bitterly and thought to himself, Fox, I'm not doing this on purpose...On the ground, the people of the School of Martial Arts were speechless as they looked up at the sky to witness this scene. Why was his shameless jerk so popular with beautiful girls? First, it was Hua Jieyu and now that she was gone he was trying to make a move on the goddess Qin Yi.\"You bastard!\" Mo Lanshan had just gotten his senses back when he witnessed the scene as well.BOOM! He did not notice when Yu Sheng came back. A punch landed on his face and Mo Lanshan was thrown on the ground once again.After hitting Mo Lanshan, Yu Sheng looked up to see Ye Futian leaving with Qin Yi and quietly made his way back home alone. He was mentally cursing Ye Futian as well. He really was a bastard.In the sky above the City of Qingzhou, the black qilin soared in one specific direction. It was going fast and the wind was whipping against their faces. The situation that Ye Futian and Qin Yi were in was rather questionable, but he had no time to think about that. His only thought was that they had to reach their destination quickly.However, before they could get there, they noticed a whole flock of black qilins up ahead soaring through the sky. Seeing this, Ye Futian thought, Could it be that word had already reached General Qin?They caught up with the group very quickly. The person leading the group looked surprised to see Qin Yi. \"Young Miss.\"\"What are you guys doing here?\" Qin Yi was equally surprised.\"A monster tide is about to wash through the City of Qingzhou,\" the leader answered.\"I came for the same reason. Looks like father already knows. Where is he?\" asked Qin Yi.\"He's taking care of some business by Lake Qinghai. We rushed here first,\" explained the leader.\"Okay then. You guys head there first; I'll go to father,\" suggested Qin Yi. The two parties separated once again. The knights of the Dark qilin Knighthood turned to take a quick glance at the young man sitting behind Qin Yi.At that moment, outside a restaurant on the lake shore, stood a group of people from the Knighthood. Their gathering attracted a lot of attention. General Qin was having his people surround the restaurant, what was going on?Naturally, when Ye Futian and Qin Yi arrived, they were met with this scene. They stood behind Qin Shuai, trying not to disturb him. He must be busy with something.In the restaurant, a group of people appeared. Leading them was a young man. Upon seeing this group, Ye Futian furrowed his brows. He had seen these people before. It was on the night of New Year's Eve and the person leading them was Xia Fan.\"Would General Qin like to join me for a drink upstairs?\" asked Xia Fan frivolously.\"Is this the doing of your people?\" Qin Shuai asked coldly.\"I don't seem to understand what General Qin is saying.\" Xia Fan played with his cup and did not look at Qin Shuai.\"The monster tide on Mount Tianyao. Are you really going to put the whole City of Qingzhou in danger for your greed?\" questioned Qin Shuai.\"I already said I don't know what you're talking about and please be aware of the tone you use when speaking to me,\" Xia Fan smiled with his eyes but his attitude was still as arrogant as before. He did not give a crap about the protector of Qingzhou City.When he finished speaking, the people beside him took a step forward and the tension intensified.\"I can't believe that the City Lord's office and the Murong Chamber of Commerce had something to do with it too,\" said General Qin as he looked at Wei Feng and Murong Qiu. His sharp gaze caused them to lower their heads, not daring to look him in the eyes.Finally, his gaze fell back to Xia Fan and told him chillingly, \"You want to use Qingzhou City to satisfy your ambitions? I already sent people to spread the news to all of the East Sea Prefecture, that traces of 'him' were found here.\"Finishing his words, Qin Shuai turned to leave. Xia Fan's expression darkened, and he glared at Qin Shuai's back, wanting to kill him so badly.How dare Qin Shuai try to ruin his plans? When Xia Fan had found out about the secret of Qingzhou city, he sent someone to deliver the news back to the East Sea Prefecture. His father then sent a professional. The purpose of that was to keep things under wraps but if Qin Shuai really spread the news, then it was bound to attract attention.Did Qin Shuai know about this secret early on?Qin Shuai led the group of knights up into the sky. Quickly, Qin Yi, who was accompanied by Ye Futian followed right behind them. Then, she was beside her father.\"Father, what exactly is going on? Who are those people?\" asked Qin Yi.\"Sweetie, the City of Qingzhou is in danger and we don't know what is going to happen next,\" answered Qin Shuai. \"The City of Qingzhou is under the jurisdiction of the East Sea Prefecture and that person before was the son of the prefecture chief. I've been keeping an eye on him since he arrived in Qingzhou City, so I knew that he sent people to Mount Tianyao to search for hidden secrets. I just can't believe he actually found it.\"\"Mount Tianyao? Secrets?\" Qin Yi was even more confused now.\"Long before you were born, my master wanted to obliterate the big demon of Mount Tianyao to save ourselves from future problems. He sent people into the mountains but realized that it was an impossible mission after paying a heavy price. However, he did find something important on Mount Tianyao,\" Qin Shuai reminisced. His mind seemed to be miles away. To this day, he could never forget the shocking scene he witnessed all those years ago.\"What did you guys find there?\" Qin Yi asked.Qin Shuai looked at his daughter and spoke the forbidden name, \"Emperor Ye Qing.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 36": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Legend of FutianCH 36Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe ground of Qingzhou Academy kept shaking like an earthquake.The bell sounded in the academy to call all the disciples. At the same time, along the perimeter of Mount Tianyao, the army of Dark Kylin spread out for the approaching enemy.The words \"Monster Tide\" were being spread throughout the whole academy. Now the Dark Kylin Knighthood knew that Ye Futian was not joking. A monster tide was seriously approaching this place.Mount Tianyao was such a vast place that no one knew exactly how many monsters were inside. If it was a minor tide, they could still hold it, but if it was a huge tide, the whole city could be destroyed.When Ye Futian and the others arrived, they saw that the battle against the monsters had already begun. Countless monsters were gushing out of the mountain. People from the School of Martial Arts were standing at the frontlines, while the School of Sorcery released spells behind them. The whole mountain was neary engulfed in fire and the earth was fissured from the battle. The guards were just trying to lock down the entire place.However, there were not only monsters running around on Mount Tianyao. A herd of demons was flying to the battleground as well, and they were about to launch an attack.The big chiefs of the academy saw this from a distance, and they now looked extremely nervous. They realized that once the monsters broke through the front lines and attacked the city, they would be unstoppable.\"The whole city has now entered a state of siege. Inform the major families to protect the city together. Soldiers of Dark Kylin, I command you to spread out and secure the perimeter of Mount Tianyao,\" Qin Shuai commanded, then the black Kylin under him flew to the herd of monsters that were flying toward the army.\"Dad!\" Qin Yi was worried about her father.\"Girl, stay away from Mount Tianyao,\" Qin Shuai told his daughter. Qin Yi was still worried about her father, and she was trying to follow him. Ye Futian yelled at her from behind, \"Stay here! If you go with your father, you will just distract him!\"Qin Yi knew that he was right. She was only in the eighth Plane of Awakening of Martial Arts, and she was not strong enough to fight against the monsters.\"Ye Futian, what should we do now?\" Qin Yi looked back at Ye Futian. She looked really flustered. They were practically pressed against each other.Ye Futian felt Qin Yi's nervousness. He blinked his eyes and asked, \"Is there anything I can do to help?\"\"\u2026\" Qin Yi realized that they were too close and suddenly blushed. She punched Ye Futian's chest with her fist and cursed him, \"You shameless bastard.\"She turned around to avoid further body contact. Ye Futian smiled and tried to comfort her. \"Don't worry. It'll be fine, and so will your father.\"\"I know.\" Qin Yi nodded. She understood Ye Futian was just trying to soothe her feelings. \"Just get off my side.\" Her face was still red.Ye Futian actually listened to her order this time. He looked into the distance, and he did not feel as assured as he seemed. This was a dangerous monster tide. The most he could do was comfort Ms. Qin, but he couldn't help much besides that.All the people in the city had been informed of the monster tide outburst. All the significant families were now deploying their military forces. This fight was related to the survival of the entire city, and no one would survive if they lost. The cultivators were also rushing to Mount Tianyao to help secure the perimeter. If they didn't, once the monsters broke through the guards, their homes would be destroyed.Inside the city, a remarkable troop was marching towards Qingzhou Academy. The troop was made up of foot soldiers and knights. The ground was shaking from the force of their marching, and the people who saw them were shocked.Some of them are the Municipal Guard of this city, some are the soldiers of the Murong Family. But who are the other guys? People were curious about this mysterious army.Some people noticed the symbols on their robes, and suddenly they sensed the danger.\"They are the powerful warriors and mages from the Heiyan Academy!\"\"How could that happen? The City of Heiyan is our nemesis. Why are the Municipal Guard soldiers with the army from the City of Heiyan?\"\"I don't know.\" People were now extremely nervous about this army. The monster tide was going to attack the city soon, but the Qingzhou Municipal Guard was not protecting the city with the Dark Kylin Knighthood. In fact, they were marching with soldiers from the City of Heiyan. The City of Qingzhou truly was in danger.This mighty troop was directly approaching Qingzhou Academy. When they arrived, the people of Qingzhou Academy were still fighting against the monsters with the Dark Kylin Knighthood.Such a huge army soon attracted the attention from all the people who were fighting. A lot of students froze when they saw the newcomers on the battleground.\"Wei Meng.\" Qin Shuai stepped out and stared at Wei Meng, the Lord of the City of Qingzhou. His face was ghastly pale. \"You released the monsters from Mount Tianyao, and are now working along with the people from City of Heiyan. This is your territory!\"\"I don't understand you. What I'm doing now is completely under orders,\" Wei Meng said in a cold voice.\"Xia Fan, what are you doing exactly?\" Qin Shuai noticed that Xia Fan was in the crowd. An evil light flickered across Xia Fan's eyes. He was looking at Qin Shuai with contempt. He believed that Qin Shuai was only the commander of a private troop of a small city and shouldn't be allowed to talk to him in such a rude manner.\"Where is the Headmaster of Qingzhou Academy?\" Xia Fan ignored Qin Shuai's question. He looked over the Qingzhou Academy group for the Headmaster. The Headmaster stepped out of the crowd. His hair was all white and gray, and it was apparent that he was over the age of seventy. However, he still looked graceful. He was the Headmaster of Qingzhou Academy, Gu Mu. He had left the school business for others long ago and focused on his cultivation. In fact, without the monster tide, he would not have even shown up in this place.\"Mr. Xia, the Lord of East Sea Prefecture, why are you here?\" Gu Mu asked Xia Fan.\"Mount Tianyao has been a potential danger for the City of Qingzhou for many years. As the Lord of Donghai Province, I have come here as soon as possible to consult with the City Lord about how to defuse the situation. Therefore, I have summoned the army of the Municipal Guard, the Murong Family, and the City of Heiyan. We are going to break into Mount Tianyao, and we need your cooperation.\" Xia Fan laughed.Gu Mu didn't believe his explanation. However, the crisis of this city had doubled. They were now surrounded by the monsters and the army. If he said no to Xia Fan, they might all be wiped out.\"Okay, we will cooperate,\" Gu Mu answered.\"I believe Mr. Gu is making this decision for the good of the city. General Qin is the ultimate guard of this city, and I believe you agree with Mr. Gu, right?\" Xia Fan looked at Qin Shuai again.\"You are shameless.\" All the people of Qingzhou Academy were cursing Xia Fan in their hearts. They looked at him with contempt.\"You have summoned quite a lot of powerful people from the City of Heiyan. What promise did you make to them?\" Qin Shuai asked Xia Fan.\"General, they're merely here to help. There are absolutely no conditions involved. Now, I know you're on edge, but I hope you can settle your attitude,\" Xia Fan said arrogantly. He had summoned a lot of influential people from the East Sea Prefecture and the City of Heiyan, so he had the advantage now.\"Okay,\" Qin Shuai agreed reluctantly. He knew that there must be some conspiracy occurring under the table. However, with reinforcements breaking into Mount Tianyao, they could actually push the frontline and minimize the damage to the City of Qingzhou. In fact, if he didn't agree and the two groups fought against each other right here, the result would be even worse.\"Then, let's go now.\" Xia Fan smiled.\"Mr. Xia, I want someone from Qingzhou Academy,\" a man from Heiyan asked Xia Fan.\"Who is it?\" Xia Fan smiled.The middle-aged man looked through the crowd of Qingzhou Academy and his eyes targeted Ye Futian.Ye Futian suddenly had a bad feeling about it. This middle-aged man was the same man with eagle's eyes who had led the intruders to Qingzhou Academy last time.\"Ye Futian, have you quit the academy yet?\" The eagle-eyed man asked him.\"What do you mean?\" Ye Futian responded with a smile.\"Last time I invited you to Heiyan Academy, you turned me down. I believe you won't mind if I raise this question again.\"\"I did quit the academy, but I already have my own master, so I'm sorry that I still have to turn you down this time,\" Ye Futian answered.\"Who is so lucky to be your master?\" He kept asking.\"I am,\" Hua Fengliu responded from the crowd.\"It's okay. In fact, Heiyan Academy is still willing to accept you even though you already have a master.\" The eagle-eyed man would not let him go easily.\"Heiyan Academy is making a really generous gesture, and I believe Mr. Hua, the Guqin Devil, would not prevent this, right?\" Xia Fan also tried to persuade Hua Fengliu. He had not anticipated that Heiyan Academy would be looking for Ye Futian.\"He's too good for your academy,\" Hua Fengliu said peacefully.In the Heiyan Academy crowd, an old man whose eyes had been closed for a long time suddenly opened his eyes and asked, \"Hua Fengliu, you want to fight?\"\"Mr. Hua, you're just causing me trouble.\" Xia Fan laughed, and the army around him stepped forward. They definitely had not dared to mess with Hua Fengliu when he was young. But now, since his natal spirit had been destroyed, they didn't fear him anymore.Hua Fengliu began condensing power and preparing to attack. However, Ye Futian suddenly started laughing, \"You know what? I feel so honored you keep inviting me to your academy. I've changed my mind, and I believe Mr. Hua will not stop me, right?\"Hua Fengliu glanced at him. He knew that this boy was really shrewd and there must have been a reason he suddenly changed his mind. He agreed and said, \"Okay, I don't mind, but your academy must make sure he is safe. Otherwise, you will taste my rage.\"\"Don't worry, Mr. Hua.\" The eagle-eyed man was happy. Ye Futian had defeated someone as talented as Yun Tianhao. There were only two options for Heiyan Academy: either accept him or kill him.Yu Sheng stepped forward. Ye Futian knew that he was trying to stop this decision. He shook his head, and Yu Sheng stopped. However, Yu Sheng was still angry and confused.A young girl and a young man came out of the Heiyan Group. The girl smiled and greeted Ye Futian, \"Now that you have been accepted by our academy, come over here!\"Ye Futian nodded and walked toward the Heiyan group. He ogled the body of the young girl and said, \"If I knew there was a girl so beautiful in your academy, I would have said yes the last time.\"\"You're a smooth talker, boy.\" The sexy girl laughed.\"Please take good care of me in the future.\" Ye Futian naturally held the girl in his arms, and the girl also seemed to feel comfortable. She laughed even harder, \"Of course I will, you cute boy.\"\"You shameless bastard.\" The people of Qingzhou Academy were swearing at Ye Futian.\"Traitor.\"\"How could a student of our academy be so off color?\" People kept cursing him. Qin Yi looked sad about what had just happened.Xia Fan was jeering at all of this. He believed Hua Fengliu must be extremely embarrassed now, seeing the boyfriend of his daughter betray the academy and flirt with another girl.However, he was surprised that Hua Fengliu was still calm. It almost seemed like Hua Fengliu had no idea about the relationship between Ye Futian and his daughter. Xia Fan believed it was possible. Otherwise, Hua Fengliu would have been furious.Still, he wondered how such a lame boy could get Hua Jieyu to fall in love with him.What he did not know was that Hua Fengliu was calm because he knew Ye Futian all too well.\"Okay, let's head in there,\" Xia Fan made the command. He seemed to be pretty satisfied with all that had happened.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The City of Qingzhou had never had an expedition of this level before.Mount Tianyao covered a large area of terrain, far larger than that of the main urban areas of Qingzhou City. It was difficult to imagine how many demons and monsters lurked in these mountains. Many people had attempted to clear Mount Tianyao of demons and monsters but to no avail.Now, because of Xia Fan, Qingzhou Academy and the city's first line of defense, the Dark Qilin Knighthood, were forced to send troops of people into the mountains. In addition, the Qingzhou Guards and Heiyan City's army were following behind them. The sheer number of people there was seemingly more impactful than the monster tide.The Dark Qilin Knighthood charged forward on the path that Qingzhou Academy's School of Divination Arts had cleared for them using sorcery. Their advance forced the demons and monsters deeper into the mountains, but Qin Shuai was not excited about this at all. The troop was attacking at full-force, but there were still demons and monsters slipping past them left and right into the main city. All they could do now was try their best to eliminate as many demons and monsters as possible.\"Lead the way,\" Xia Fan ordered the middle-aged man ahead of him. His people had left markers in the mountains the last time they were here looking for the historical remains of Emperor Ye Qing.Ye Futian and the people of Heiyan Academy were walking at the back of the group. He had already made some inquiries. Ye Futian found out that the girl beside him was named Tang Yue, twenty years old. She was definitely a flirtatious beauty. Ye Futian and Tang Yue got familiar with each other fairly quickly.\"Senior Sister, a beauty like you must have many suitors, right?\" asked Ye Futian.\"Why do you ask?\" laughed Tang Yue.\"Do I have a chance?\" he asked her. She looked at Ye Futian and chuckled, \"You do look pretty handsome but it's a shame that you're a little too young for my liking.\"\"Senior Sister, I'm already an adult. Sixteen is not too young,\" said Ye Futian. When Tang Yue saw how serious he was, she could not help but burst out in laughter. The young men of Heiyan Academy glared at Ye Futian when they heard Tang Yue laughing.\"Senior Sister, do you know why we're here?\" asked Ye Futian.\"The elders say that there are historical remains in Mount Tianyao,\" explained Tang Yue.Ye Futian shook his head. \"Senior Sister, let me tell you a secret.\"He then leaned in close to whisper softly in her ear, \"In Mount Tianyao, there is a secret methods index left behind by Emperor Ye Qing.Tang Yue's expression turned serious and she looked at Ye Futian. \"Is what you said true?\"It looked like Xia Yan had, indeed, kept this information to himself. It was hard to blame him though because this had to do with Emperor Ye Qing so, of course, he would keep quiet about it.\"Of course! My master is 'THE' Hua Fengliu and I also know General Qin. It's only natural that I know this secret. Why else would they have made such a big fuss?\" said Ye Futian.\"Wait for me here,\" Tang Yue finished her sentence and left. Ye Futian watched as she walked up to speak with the elder that had wanted to challenge Hua Fengliu and made her way back. \"Come with me,\" she said to Ye Futian.He followed her to stand in front of the elder who had his eyes closed. \"Where did you hear this information?\" the elder asked Ye Futian.\"May I ask what your position is at Heiyan Academy?\" questioned Ye Futian.The elder opened his eyes, his gaze sharp, \"Why do you ask?\"\"Since I'm going to pursue an education at Heiyan Academy, it's only common sense to want to learn from the best of the best,\" explained Ye Futian.\"I am Tang Mo, the Headmaster of Heiyan Academy. If you do well maybe I will think about teaching you myself,\" said the elder. Beside them, Tang Yue smiled and explained, \"He's my grandfather.\"Ye Futian bowed down and began to blabber baseless information. \"Since you're the headmaster and Senior Sister Tang Yue's grandfather I would not dare withhold information from you. There has always been a rumor in the City of Qingzhou that our city was where Emperor Ye Qing originated and that he had left an heirloom here. To obtain the heirloom was to obtain the right to inherit his position and his secret methods index. A lot of people think it's just a legend but it's all true. The heirloom is up in Mount Tianyao; General Qin has personally seen it in the past.\"\"Why didn't he take it then?\" Tang Mo was skeptical.\"Headmaster, do you really think Emperor Ye Qing's heirloom is that easy to obtain? If it were, why would Xia Fan do all of this?\" asked Ye Futian.Tang Mo squinted his eyes in suspicion. \"Do you know what happens if you lie to me?\"\"I didn't know that Headmaster was kept in the dark about this. I was simply making conversation with Senior Sister Tang Yue, why would I purposely lie to her? It's just that Xia Fan has already gathered professionals from the East Sea Prefecture but he's using people from both academies to fend off the demons and monsters instead. I think he's up to no good,\" answered Ye Futian.\"Are you trying to turn us against each other?\" Tang Mo was extremely sharp. His great aura was suffocating Ye Futian.\"When you reach the site of the remains you'll know whether or not Xia Fan has been lying to you. If what I said was false, then my life is in your hands but if what I said was true, then you should start being wary,\" said Ye Futian.\"Why?\" asked Tang Mo.\"I don't know what Xia Fan promised you but I'm sure you know what the inheritance of Emperor Ye Qing signifies. When the troops are done dealing with the demons and monsters, it would be easy to get his hands on the heirloom. After he accomplishes his goal, it would be a piece of cake for him to kill off all the witnesses. Headmaster, you must take caution,\" Ye Futian spoke solemnly. Up ahead, it was loud as the troops advanced and the boundaries of the mountain were on lockdown by the aces of Heiyan Academy. There would be no need to worry about a leak of information if worst comes to worst.\"Do you hate the Vice Chief?\" Tang Mo asked suddenly.Ye Futian lifted his head to look at Tang Mo. After a short silence, he nodded, \"Of course! Xia Fan will do anything to get his way. He even started the monster tide to get us all on the mountain. The City of Qingzhou is my home, I can't allow him to bring harm to our city. If his plans succeed, it would be difficult for even me to make it out alive. If you don't believe me, then forget it; but if you choose to believe me then please join hands with us. My master is Hua Fengliu, and I'm acquainted with General Qin. Even if the two schools have always been rivals, it's not impossible to work together just this once. If we can get our hands on Emperor Ye Qing's heirloom, wouldn't it all be worth it? You would be able to do anything you want, without fearing repercussions from a prefecture chief.\"Tang Yue, take him away,\" Tang Mo ordered abruptly with a sullen look. Tang Yue walked towards Ye Futian.He bowed once more to Tang Mo and left with Tang Yue, not saying another word.\"What do you think?\" Tang Mo asked the eagle-eyed man at his side.\"That guy has got quite a mouth on him. We can't trust him completely. The key now is to wait and see if what we find is truly the historical remains of Emperor Ye Qing,\" reasoned Eagle Eyes.\"And if they really are his remains?\" Tang Mo continued to question.\"Father, if it is actually the heirloom of Emperor Ye Qing, then what would a city like Qingzhou be to us? If we got our hands on the heirloom, not even the entire East Sea area would be able to stop us,\" said Eagle Eyes. Tang Mo went into deep thought. Even though Ye Futian's words were evidently trying to make the groups question one another, he had a point. With the heirloom in his hands, he would be unstoppable.\"Do you think he'll be of use to us?\" Tang Mo asked.Eagle Eyes thought for a while then shook his head. \"Whether it be his gift or his personality, he's too hard to control.\"\"That's true. Yun Tianhao is naturally prideful and thinks only of cultivation but this young man is different,\" Tang Mo agreed with his son.\"Even though Yun Tianhao lost to this fellow, he is still a Mandate Sorcerer. Yun Tianhao will only get stronger and more powerful. He has already left for the City of Donghai to seek more knowledge. He will definitely make a glorious return. Ye Futian on the other hand, if we don't get him under control...,\" Eagle Eyes looked at Tang Mo and then shared an unspoken understanding.The large group was advancing very quickly. Along the way, they stepped over countless carcasses of different types of demons and monsters but they had also suffered many attacks. Both Qingzhou Academy and the Dark Qilin Knighthood made many sacrifices, some dead, some hurt.The fog on Mount Tianyao grew thicker. It would be impossible to locate anything in the mountains from up in the air. This was the only reason Xia Fan chose to advance on foot.During their long expedition, Headmaster Gu Mu of Qingzhou Academy and Qin Shuai went looking for Xia Fan. When they found him, they made their intentions clear, \"If everyone else continues to take a back seat while our people from the academy and the knighthood clear the way, we will leave the way we came.\"\"Are you threatening me?\" Xia Fan stared at Qin Shuai who had just listed his terms.\"Think what you will,\" said Qin Shuai calmly. They were no longer in the City of Qingzhou. They had initially agreed to Xia Fan's forceful request because of the monster tide but now that they were deep into Mount Tianyao, things were different.Xia Fan did not dare to push his luck.\"Fine,\" Xia Fan gave in and called out, \"Headmaster Tang Mo.\"\"I understand,\" Tang Mo nodded and ordered his people to take the place of the people of Qingzhou Academy and the Dark Qilin Knighthood at the front line. Ye Futian stepped up with them. This area with the deeper fog housed more powerful demons and monsters. Sometimes, there were even high-leveled Dharma rank demons and monsters. To defeat these creatures, the elders would have to step in.Time passed, and day by day, there were fewer and fewer people in their expedition, and a large number of those who were hurt were actually their most powerful people in the group. The weaker people were being protected in the back of the group. Nobody would send the weak out to die, so they were the safest.Whenever Ye Futian was met with danger, he ran to hide amongst the Heiyan Academy aces so he would be safe as well. He was not about to risk his life for the Heiyan Academy. A lot of people scorned him when he did this, but he did not care at all.Finally, when they had gotten far enough within the mountains, the fog began to clear. This area was bright, maybe even brighter than it had been off the mountains. Spiritual Qi was gathered here.\"This area is heavy with Spiritual Qi, but the surrounding areas are layered in fog. Could it be...,\" someone in the group spoke up.\"That's right. We're here,\" said an ace beside Xia Fan. He was excited. The lot continued to advance, and they started to realize that there was not a single demon or monster in this area.\"What is that?\" someone pointed ahead and screamed. As they got closer, the view became clearer, and everyone's hearts began to pound. What they saw was an enormous statue. It rose from the valley below and stood in the middle of the mountains.Everyone was shaking, but they continued to advance until they were all standing on a cliff above the valley, looking out at the statue. Spiritual Qi was flowing like crazy through the entire area.\"Look down.\" Someone pointed with a shaking finger down at the base of the statue. There, they saw a dragon coiled around the statue. It was an actual dragon! Right now, it had its eyes closed shut, seemingly asleep.\"That's the dragon,\" someone from Qingzhou Academy said. Everyone, including Ye Futian, was surprised. This dragon was the same one they saw last fall.Around the statue and dragon, the valley was swarmed by powerful demons. They were revolving around the statue, greedily absorbing it's Spiritual Qi.This was a valley of a million beasts.\"Emperor Ye Qing,\" someone said in shock as they stared at the giant statue.Sixteen years ago, the death of Emperor Ye Qing became tabooed and it became forbidden for anything in his image to exist but right in front of their eyes was this magnificent statue of Emperor Ye Qing!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Black hair casually spread across the shoulders. The eyes were so bright that they seemed to be looking through people. The statue had already demonstrated the unsurpassed charm of Emperor Ye Qing.Emperor Ye Qing was the legend of the Divine Prefectures of the East. Even though his name became a taboo after he died, it was still mentioned privately.The name had come as a shock. They had never expected that in Mount Tianyao there was such a lifelike statue of Emperor Ye Qing.And they were wondering whether the dragon was his mount.\"Wow, look at this, the relics of Emperor Ye Qing.\" Tang Mo, the Headmaster of Heiyan Academy, narrowed his eyes. He realized that Xia Fan had concealed his true intentions about coming in here.Qin Shuai gazed at the coiled dragon in the canyon below. He frowned with doubt. Several years ago, when he had come here with his master, he hadn't seen the coiled dragon. There were only the statue and monsters at that time. The dragon must have come later.\"Everyone, these are the relics of Emperor Ye Qing. There's an entrance behind the statue, and I believe the treasure of Emperor Ye Qing is hidden inside.\u00a0Even without the relics of Emperor Ye Qing, the corpse of this dead dragon is a valuable treasure itself.\" Xia Fan pointed below. He looked so greedy that he would have started the exploration already if not for the monsters lurking below.Tang Fei went to tell Xia Fan that the monsters below were entirely different from the ones in the monster tide. \"Mr. Xia, these monsters are different.\" These monsters were just being lazy. They didn't even care about the people and kept laying there.\"So, we all need to work together,\" Xia Fan said.\"I didn't know Emperor Ye Qing was a native of the City of Qingzhou, and that there were relics in this place. How much longer were you going to hide this from me?\" Tang Mo asked Xia Fan tentatively.Xia Fan looked at Tang Mo and then smiled. \"In fact, I didn't know that Emperor Ye Qing lived in this city until recently. However, it's still unknown whether the relics are behind the entrance of that statue or not. I didn't tell Mr. Tang because I wanted to keep it confidential information.\"\"Okay.\" Tang Mo nodded. Ye Futian was telling the truth. Emperor Ye Qing had been a native of the City of Qingzhou.However, what he didn't know was that Ye Futian also felt shocked about this fact. He had totally made it up, and he had no evidence to support it. To his surprise, Xia Fan admitted that Emperor Ye Qing had lived in the City of Qingzhou.\"Time to get to work,\" Xia Fan commanded.Awkwardly, no one started moving. None of them were going to risk their lives for Xia Fan at this time.\"General Qin, Mr. Gu?\" Xia Fan looked at Qin Shuai and asked.\"We have already finished our job. I am not going to let people of the Dark Kylin Knighthood and Qingzhou Academy die for your interests,\" Qin Shuai said coldly. Due to the huge amount of monsters below, Xia Fan would basically be sending them in as bait to distract these monsters from guarding the entrance.\"Mr. Xia, there are so many monsters and, to be honest, some of us will die if we fight them. If you get the treasure from Emperor Ye Qing, what will we get? I don't want my people to die for nothing,\" Tang Mo protested. Xia Fan was caught off guard, then smiled. He realized that Ye Futian had talked with Tang Mo about his plan.\"Uncle.\" Xia Fan looked at the man in black next to him. Then he went silent. The next moment, a fierce storm of sword power burst out of his body. This storm became so intense that it enveloped all the people.People were nervous. The power of this sword storm was so overwhelming that it could destroy everything, monsters and people alike.\"He's in the Arcana Plane, that's incredible.\" Hua Fengliu realized Xia Fan was serious this time. He had summoned his uncle from the City of Donghai who was, in fact, a powerful swordsman. The treasure of Emperor Ye Qing was so precious that it was hard for Xia Fan to fully trust his army.Tang Mo also looked uncomfortable and shot Ye Futian a despising glance.\"Do you have other questions?\" Xia Fan laughed out loud. He had gained control over the situation now.\"The Dark Kylin soldiers will fight for you. Let the young students of Qingzhou Academy go,\" Qin Shuai responded.\"You're asking for death.\" Xia Fan was impatient. His uncle suddenly launched a powerful strike. The strike was too fast to evade. The dark Kylin under Qin Shuai was killed by this strike, and one of Qin Shuai's arms was cut off.\"General!\" The Dark Kylin soldiers gathered around Qin Shuai. They were terrified of what had just happened.\"Dad!\" Qin Yi screamed in horror.The man in black hurried into the air. He could have launched another strike at any moment.\"Any more questions?\" Xia Fan sounded indifferent.\"I insist that only the Dark Kylin soldiers join the fight, and the young students of Qingzhou Academy should leave,\" Qin Shuai was persistent. Blood gushed out of his missing arm, but he was still peaceful.Xia Fan was mad. He needed Qin Shuai's army to fight against the monsters, but he knew they would not do so without their commander.\"Okay, let the young students go.\" Xia Fan then looked at Tang Mo, \"Mr. Tang, do you have anything to add?\"\"I obey your orders.\" Tang Mo had to comply. He didn't have the same courage as Qin Shuai.\"So, let's move,\" Xia Fan commanded. The army began to attack the monsters below. The Dark Kylin soldiers were the vanguards of this troop, and those powerful people beyond the Dharma Plane level were following them. Xia Fan observed the fight. He wanted to test the power of these monsters with the bait he had just sent.\"Go away, or die!\" A heavy voice came out of the canyon, which stiffened the members of the army. Soon, they saw a white-skinned monster standing apart from the herd. She soon started to grow huge, and she looked almost as big as a hill. The rest of the herd were awakened by this voice. Suddenly, the whole herd became active.\"What the\u2026\" Xia Fan was frightened. He didn't know there was a Monster Lord in this herd.How could that be possible?He looked at the statue of Emperor Ye Qing. Was the Monster Lord the guardian of this statue?People were shocked. The Monster Lord was a Snow Ape. When it stood up, it was so giant that it seemed invincible.\"Die, you intruders!\" the Snow Ape roared. The mountain began to shake from this roar.\"Sorry for the intrusion,\" Xia Fan said. He knew that this was an inevitable failure.They had lost quite a lot soldiers from their army and all of that for just a tour of this place?All of the armies retreated back to the top. Tang Mo started speaking, \"I'm sorry, Mr. Xia, we can't do anything about it.\"Xia Fan's face was gloomy. It seemed that he needed to release his anger desperately.\"Go fight the monsters and die there,\" Xia Fan told Tang Mo. Tang Mo was caught off guard.\"Mr. Xia, please forgive him. Mr. Tang was encouraged by the others.\" Murong Qiu approached.Ye Futian knew that the conspiracy had been revealed now. He had tried to cause a crack between Xia Fan and Tang Mo, but he had not expected that Tang Mo would surrender to the power of Xia Fan.\"Yes, Ye Futian tried to turn me against you! He told me that he was planning to mess with Xia Fan with help from the students of Qingzhou Academy and the soldiers of the Dark Kylin Knighthood!\" Tang Mo sold Ye Futian out. Tang Yue was embarrassed by her grandfather. She had already started to consider Ye Futian as a friend.\"So, Qingzhou Academy sent Ye Futian to Heiyan Academy to mess up my plans, am I right?\" Xia Fan's voice was gloomy and cold.\"Mr. Xia, Ye Futian was expelled from Qingzhou Academy long ago. His activity had nothing to do with this academy. I will kill him for you to prove that,\" Shi Zhong explained.\"Is that true?\" Xia Fan looked at Gu Mu for confirmation.Gu Mu gave Hua Fengliu a glance, then nodded. \"This has nothing to do with Qingzhou Academy.\"\"So, I will believe whoever kills him first.\" Xia Fan was laughing out loud.\"I'll do it!\" Shi Zhong rushed toward Ye Futian.Tang Lin also rushed toward Ye Futian. They had already had plans to kill Ye Futian, so even without being interrogated by Xia Fan, he would have been killed anyway.Hua Fengliu appeared next to Ye Futian to protect his disciple. He glanced at Shi Zhong and Tang Lin. \"Do I not exist?\"\"Mr. Guqin Devil, this is none of your business.\" Xia Fan was complacent.\"Even your father didn't dare talk to me like that.\" Hua Fengliu stared at Xia Fan.\"That was in the past, Mr. Hua,\" Xia Fan sneered at him, \"I am in a bad mood. Stay out of this, now.\"The moment he stopped talking, the man in black stepped forward. He soon started to attack Hua Fengliu with the sword-storm.\"I am also in a bad mood. You better stay away from me before you get in trouble.\" Hua Fengliu sounded peaceful.\"Your natal spirit has been destroyed, and I'm kind of curious how bad your temper could be.\" He urged his power toward Hua Fengliu, and it looked like he was going to tear Hua Fengliu into pieces.\"Professor!\" Ye Futian was worried about Hua Fengliu. This man in black was in the Arcana Plane, he was even more powerful than the people from Heiyan Academy who were in the Dharma Plane. Qingzhou City had never seen someone as powerful as he was. He had no idea what plane Hua Fengliu was in, but the confidence of that man worried him.\"He has fallen under the Arcana Plane since his natal spirit was destroyed.\" The middle-aged man next to Xia Fan confirmed Ye Futian's fear.\"You don't have to die for me, Professor,\" Ye Futian ran away and yelled, \"Just tell Fox I love her and tell my godfather I have to let him down.\"The second half was to Yu Sheng.Shockingly, Ye Futian began running into the canyon with the endless monsters!Ye Futian was upset that he had to end his short life in such a way. He was not prepared to die yet.\"Go after him!\" Xia Fan commanded. Suddenly, some powerful mages rushed out of the group to pursue Ye Futian.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He even left his last words.He tried to run toward Ye Futian's direction but was blocked by the sword-storm, cutting off his advance.\"Ye Futian! You get back here right now!\" screamed Hua Fengliu.\"You should worry about yourself,\" suggested the Arcana Plane cultivator dressed in black. His body was surrounded by the endless sword-storm. When he swiped his arms forward, a row of swords appeared, all charging at Hua Fengliu.\"Get lost!\" raged Hua Fengliu. An invisible force descended upon him, and the row of swords stopped right before they were able to pierce him. The swords shook violently in mid-air.While the two were in this deadlock, Hua Fengliu saw Shi Zhong, Eagle Eyes, and Tang Lin jump down into the canyon to chase after Ye Futian. His heart convulsed.His long, black hair flowed without the wind blowing, the dust beneath his feet blew like a weird storm.\"I told you I have a bad temper, why did you have to provoke me?\" Hua Fengliu's voice was shaking. He felt extremely guilty. His life was just beginning; he couldn't die.A bright light emanated from Hua Fengliu. Then, the light gathered and formed the strings of a qin. From there, the entire instrument appeared in front of Hua Fengliu. At that moment, his aura began to grow, breaking Dharma into the Arcana Plane.\"Life Spirit. That's impossible!\" said the Arcana Plane swordsman. He quickly realized what was going on, and his expression changed. \"Hua Fengliu, this is suicide!\"Hua Fengliu disregarded him, and began to strum the instrument with both hands. Music began to play. An abstract wave was released that pierced eardrums with a dragon-like roar. The swords formed with Spiritual Qi dissipated.The Cangshan Dragon Chant. The swordsman could only stare at Hua Fengliu. The Cangshan Dragon Chant was a musical spell that the Qin Devil, Hua Fengliu, specialized in.The swordsman watched as Hua Fengliu's pace quickened; his music spread into his surroundings, and the sound waves created a force field, encapsulating everyone around. The force field made its way to the swordsman and Xia Fan.BOOM! Xia Fan received a harsh attack and moaned in pain. His face was now pale.\"Be careful, this is his musical spell. Retreat!\" shouted the swordsman. His sword raced toward Hua Fengliu once more.Hua Fengliu's fingers moved even faster. The sound of his instrument was magical, spreading far and wide.\"Kill him!\" ordered Xia Fan, blood in his mouth. He felt as if he were about to explode. His people came to protect him in their retreat.Everyone began to retreat, even Shi Zhong and Tang Lin, who were chasing Ye Futian.\"Kill,\" muttered Hua Fengliu. His music continued, and an even stronger wave attacked Xia Fan. His people tried to use their Spiritual Qi to create a force field for his protection, but the wave was too strong. The force field was broken, and Xia Fan was hit once again. His face was now even more pale than before.Shi Zhong, on the other hand, was not so lucky. Under the power of the music, he screamed in pain. He was killed by the power of Hua Fengliu's instrument, bleeding from every orifice.\"The Qin Devil,\" someone said. Many people had heard of this name, but seeing him in action made them realize how truly extraordinary Hua Fengliu was.\"Let's go,\" said the swordsman. Protecting himself with a force field, he went to Xia Fan's side to retreat together.Seeing this, Tang Mo and Gu Mu also ordered an evacuation. Qing Shuai led the Dark Qilin Knighthood away from this place of trouble. Hua Fengliu attempted to chase after his enemies, but stopped after taking a single step. He began to cough up blood. This was going to be the end of the legendary Qin Devil. He could no longer chase after them.Even so, the sound of his instrument never ceased....Ye Futian jumped down the canyon and felt the wind around him. Just as he was about to land he was swept up in the wind but not even the wind could defy gravity. He began to fall once more and Ye Futian felt no strength in his legs. Would he die like this?He did not die but he did see the demons and monsters gather around him. They looked as if they wanted to swallow him alive.\"Are you trying to get yourself killed?\" asked the Snow Ape. Just as he spoke, Ye Futian's Thunder Dragon Spirit was released.\"Senior Dragon and I are linked by fate. I have my Life Spirit thanks to him, so I came to express my gratitude,\" said Ye Futian loudly. He was not going to give up a chance to live even at a dead end like this.Demons and monsters stormed towards him, not paying attention to anything he said. Ye Futian could smell blood. It came from the mouth of a demon boa. He was out of hope now.PANG! A large hand smacked the demon boa far away. The Snow Ape stood in front of Ye Futian like a large mountain. It looked down on Ye Futian and asked \"This Life Spirit. It was given to you by the old dragon?\"Ye Futian's eyes twinkled and he spoke, \"Last year when I was training on Mount Tianyao, Senior Dragon's image appeared. After observing it, my Life Spirit was created.\"\"You created the Life Spirit by observation?\" The Snow Ape stared at Ye Futian. \"Show me your Natal Spirit.\"Ye Futian nodded. The World Tree appeared. The ancient tree swayed in the wind, just like a real tree.The Snow Ape shuddered, his eyes suddenly turning red. His large body fell to the ground, his head landing in front of Ye Futian.\"What's wrong?\" asked Ye Futian, withdrawing his Life Spirit. The Snow Ape looked extremely sad.\"Child,\" the Snow Ape stuck out its finger to caress Ye Futian's face. Tears formed in his large red eyes, and he began to cry. This was enough for Ye Futian to share his deep sadness.\"Why is it you?\" the Snow Ape's body shook as he continued to cry.\"Do you know me?\" Ye Futian's voice lowered, seemingly affected by the Snow Ape's emotions.\"You poor child.\" The Snow Ape was unable to pull himself out of his melancholic state. Slowly, he stood up, lifted his head, and let out an earth-shattering scream. His fists pounded down on his chest repeatedly. The Snow Ape's scream resonated throughout the mountain, and the demons and monsters bowed down as they shook in fear. The Snow Ape then got down on his knees and gave Ye Futian a deep bow, one fit for royalty.\"Senior,\" Ye Futian was dumbfounded. The demons and monsters of the canyon were bowing down to him.\"May you bring me back up there?\" asked Ye Futian. He was worried about Hua Fengliu.\"Of course,\" answered the Snow Ape. He lifted his head and held on to Ye Futian with his huge hands. His feet stomped down on the ground, shattering it, and in a second they were catapulted back to the peak of the mountain. The whole mountain shook along with their movements.Letting go of Ye Futian, the Snow Ape placed him on the ground.\"Master!\" Ye Futian's heart squeezed at the sight of Hua Fengliu. He was still strumming away at his instrument, the strings now tainted with blood.\"Ye Futian,\" called out Hua Fengliu. He could not believe his eyes; Ye Futian was safe and sound.A chord snapped, and his instrument disappeared. Hua Fengliu spit out blood once again and fell to the ground.\"Master!\" Ye Futian sprinted to his side and held Hua Fengliu in his arms.\"There's someone over there,\" the Snow Ape looked ahead. Ye Futian raised his head to see that the swordsman had returned. When he saw Ye Futian and the Snow Ape together, the swordsman's heart pounded. How could it be?\"Kill him,\" Ye Futian said coldly. The Snow Ape took big steps toward the swordsman, who began to run, but his speed was no match for the Snow Ape.The Snow Ape gave out a loud growl and stomped down on the swordsman. Before his demise, he managed to shout out a warning to his companions, \"RUN!\"Three roars came from the Snow Ape, and from a distance the swordsman's companions shook in fear. What was the demon king doing outside the canyon?...Hua Fengliu's life was hanging on by a thread, but he still smiled at Ye Futian. \"Don't worry, this isn't enough to kill me. My powers were disabled once, doesn't matter if it happens a second time.\"\"I told you to leave me be, why did you do this? If I was already dead, then you would have died in vain,\" shouted Ye Futian. His eyes were red.\"As your Master, I couldn't just let you be driven to your death and do nothing about it. That's humiliating,\" laughed Hua Fengliu. \"Besides, you know I have a bad temper.\"\"So, you feel good about yourself now? Well, I'm pissed. If something had happened to you, what would I do about Fox?\" asked Ye Futian.\"You would marry her,\" chuckled Hua Fengliu. Ye Futian lowered his head, tears streaming down his face as he closed his eyes, in pain.\"Why are you crying? My daughter is beautiful! Are you not willing to marry her?\" Hua Fengliu was acting as if nothing had happened.\"I'm crying because you messed up my life. If you die, then I don't even get the chance to kick you to the curb when I'm successful,\" said Ye Futian as he placed Hua Fengliu on his back, carrying him into the canyon.\"You make it sound like you got the short end of the stick here,\" Hua Fengliu said from behind.\"Of course! If I become emperor, then you're the emperor's father-in-law,\" Ye Futian answered nonchalantly. Hua Fengliu lifted his head to watch the sunset and smiled.Yu Sheng approached them from the edge of the canyon. Ye Futian stared at him. \"What are you trying to do now? Are you also trying to die with me by jumping off?\"\"No,\" replied Yu Sheng, shaking his head.Ye Futian was even madder now. \"What happened to being loyal to friends?\"\"If you had died then I would have avenged you.\" Yu Sheng lifted his head, finally looking Ye Futian in the eyes. His eyes were also red.\"Fine, I forgive you,\" said Ye Futian. He looked over at the Snow Ape who had just returned. \"Can you bring me to the statue?\"\"Okay, but anyone who sees us together has to die,\" said the Snow Ape seriously.Ye Futian was shocked at his words and looked over at Yu Sheng. \"They are some of my closest friends and family. Don't even think about it. As for the others, leave it to me.\"The Snow Ape nodded and brought the three to the entrance of the statue.Ye Futian pushed open the door and entered alone.The inside was empty. All that was there was another statue of Emperor Ye Qing but this one was life-sized.The Spiritual Qi inside was packed as if there was a matrix somewhere. When Ye Futian took a step inside, the matrix lit up by itself. It got brighter as endless amounts of Spiritual Qi rushed into the life-size statue. This caused the statue to break apart, releasing a virtual image. It was Emperor Ye Qing!The two met eyes and Emperor Ye Qing spoke softly to ask, \"What is your name, child?\"\"Senior, my name is Ye Futian,\" he answered. He was not sure why he felt so at peace even though the most legendary character in history was standing in front of him.\"We share a surname. Release your Life Spirit for me,\" requested Emperor Ye Qing. Ye Futian did exactly that, as requested.Upon seeing his Life Spirit, Emperor Ye Qing froze. Then, he let out a pained expression. It was the same reaction that the Snow Ape had, it seemed like he was about to cry.His virtual image approached Ye Futian and embraced him. He then said, \"My dear child. Why is it you? Why must it be you?\"His voice cracked as he cried. Ye Futian wanted to cry with him. Softly, he spoke, \"Senior, haven't you been waiting for me? Who exactly am I?\"\"You are not the one I have been waiting for. I didn't think it would be you.\" His voice was filled with sadness. His virtual image returned to its original place. Emperor Ye Qing looked at Ye Futian with gentle eyes and told him, \"Child, you are the future emperor of the Divine Prefectures. The ruler of the world.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His godfather had used to tell him the same thing. He was curious why they had such high expectations for him.His father had told him that he inherited his natal spirit from his ancestors. However, it was apparent that Emperor Ye Qing and the Snow Ape recognized his natal spirit.\"I would not even dare to think about becoming emperor. Could you please just tell me who I am?\" Ye Futian asked in a lowered voice.\"Child, you have to trust yourself. You are destined to be the emperor because of your natal spirit,\" Emperor Ye Qing said patiently. However, Ye Futian was dejected because he had not received a clear answer. \"As you're not waiting for me, I believe it's time for me to leave now.\"\"You are wrong.\" Emperor Ye Qing now looked at Ye Futian, full of kindness. \"I feel sad about meeting you in such a situation. However, no one would be more appropriate than you to inherit my power.\"\"Your treasures\u2026 You are giving me all of them?\" Ye Futian was surprised.\"Yes, my natal spirit, my original spells, and everything else.\" Emperor Ye Qing nodded.\"Could you please teach my friend your martial arts techniques? He was born to be a warrior.\" Ye Futian was thinking about Yu Sheng. He believed that Yu Sheng would be perfect for those techniques.\"Is his surname Yu?\" Emperor Ye Qing asked.\"How did you know that?\" Ye Futian was surprised.\"If you had not been born into this world, he would have carried my inheritance. However, since you are here, you deserve all of them. He was born into this world only to help you,\" Emperor Ye Qing rejected his suggestion. Ye Futian felt sad about this. He believed it was unfair to Yu Sheng.\"Child, there's not much time left for me, even though I want to see you grow up.\" Emperor Ye Qing's voice was low and sad.Ye Futian looked at him and asked, \"Could you please tell me what the relation is between you and me?\"Emperor Ye Qing shook his head. He now looked at Ye Futian with kindness and a trace of sadness. Soon, the illusory figure of Emperor Ye Qing turned into a bright light, which shot toward Ye Futian's forehead. At that moment, Ye Futian felt a piercing mental power enter his head. His body was trembling because of the anguishing pain.\"This is already the third time.\" Ye Futian was disappointed, then lost consciousness.When he woke up again, Yu Sheng and Hua Fengliu were sitting beside him. They had both entered the statue. The Snow Ape and the monsters were guarding the outside.\"You are so lucky.\" Hua Fengliu looked at Ye Futian. Xia Fan had summoned someone so powerful, an Arcana Plane swordsman, to seize the treasures of Emperor Ye Qing. They had even released the monster tide to attack the guardians of Qingzhou City. However, all that they had done had just helped Ye Futian in the end.Ye Futian smiled wryly, yet he was still confused and depressed about what had happened.He closed his eyes and entered his life palace. There was another natal spirit now in his life palace, the Storm of Eyes. The eyes were made up of total darkness, almost like a black hole. There was horrifying mental power inside the natal spirit. This new natal spirit came as a gift rather than a result of cultivation. Ye Futian had to admit that he was lucky.Soon after, he opened his eyes. The next moment, his eyes became as dark as the Storm of Eyes. A robust mental power was filling his eyes. Hua Fengliu was surprised by this new power granted to Ye Futian. He vaguely felt the sense of an emperor.His eyes then turned back to normal. Hua Fengliu asked him, \"Spirit elemental?\"\"Yes, it's beast mastery.\" Ye Futian nodded. Besides the sorcerers of the seven elements, there were some special Mandate Sorcerers. For example, Hua Fengliu specialized in music spells. There were also some beastmasters. In fact, all these special sorcerers were categorized as mind controllers, who attacked their opponents with the mental power of the spirit elemental.\"So, Emperor Ye Qing was a beastmaster,\" Hua Fengliu mumbled.\"And he was a powerful cultivator in martial arts,\" Ye Futian remembered and added.\"Sorcerers specializing in mental power were powerful offensively. However, they had weak defenses. I guess that was why he enhanced his techniques with martial arts cultivation. That just made him perfect.\" Hua Fengliu nodded. Emperor Ye Qing was the legend who had unified the whole continent, so his talents must have been incredible, incomparable.\"Take your time to look through the treasures you have received. Just ignore us.\" Hua Fengliu was happy with Ye Futian's situation.\"Okay.\" Ye Futian closed his eyes, and then pieces of memories were swarming in his mind. He saw the Dragon riding on the cloud, the Bird flying over the sky, and the Giant Ape stomping on the earth. They were so real that Ye Futian almost felt like he could reach out and touch them.\"The Dragon serves for my strength, the Ape serves for my power, and the Bird serves for my speed. I can make use of them and form my body to perfection.\"Ye Futian was shocked deep inside. He had already possessed the soul of the Dragon, and now he was using Freedom Meditation to extract the souls of the Ape and the Bird. Gradually, the wind, earth and metal element powers raged around in his body, and new natal spirits began to show up in his life palace.Ye Futian finally understood why Emperor Ye Qing had let him inherit all the treasures rather than Yu Sheng. He had the rarest of talents; he could actually create new natal spirits on his own.Before long, he had two new natal spirits in his life palace.In his life palace, he already had many natal spirits other than the original World Tree, the Sun, the Thunder Dragon, the Guqin, the Storm of Eyes, the Bird, and the Ape. It was even more impressive that the natal spirit of the Bird had two elements, which were wind and metal.After he opened his eyes, he looked at Hua Fengliu and Yu Sheng with confusion.\"What are you looking at?\" Hua Fengliu looked back curiously. He noticed that a weird smile had shown up on Ye Futian's face.\"Professor, I just\u2026 have too many natal spirits in my life palace now. The treasures I received from Emperor Ye Qing were too powerful for me.\" Ye Futian blinked his eyes.Hua Fengliu was embarrassed. He only had one natal spirit, and it was destroyed a long time ago. He pretended to be mad at Ye Futian. \"Get out of here.\"Ye Futian also started to laugh. He took a deep breath and said, \"You are also lucky, professor, to have such a lucky son-in-law.\"Yu Sheng's notion about how shameless Ye Futian could be was reaffirmed entirely at that moment.As for Hua Fengliu, he almost wanted to kick Ye Futian's *ss right now....During the next month, Ye Futian kept cultivating in the canyon of Mount Tianyao. The relentless monsters led by the Snow Ape locked down this area to make sure no one could approach Ye Futian.Ye Futian was practicing his skills on a bunch of demon beasts.A Demon Bull pounced toward Ye Futian. However, Ye Futian didn't even try to evade the attack. He headed straight on to the Demon Bull to counter the attack. While he was charging, the roar of the Dragon came out of his body. He made a fist and punched the Demon Bull hard. That punch looked as if it was landed by the Giant Ape.With a loud thump, the Demon Bull was knocked away by that punch.Ye Futian didn't let the Demon Bull go that easily. His hands reached out to clamp down on the throat of the Demon Bull.The attack this time changed into another form. Ye Futian almost looked like he had wings and began flying with the movement of a Bird.A Demon Panther also started to attack, but she missed Ye Futian because he was too fast. She saw the counterattack coming, but it was already too late to dodge it. Ye Futian's arms were like the wings of a Bird, and his thunder-like strike left the Demon Panther with a deep wound on her body.The other monsters kept growling. They had been intimidated by Ye Futian.\"Now your body moves like a Dragon, you are strong as an Ape, and your speed is like the Bird. You have made impressive progress during the last month.\" Hua Fengliu felt satisfied with his work.\"I am still so far away from the abilities of those true divine creatures.\" Ye Futian remembered the images in his mind.Hua Fengliu understood and tried to comfort him, \"Your level is not high enough to fully develop the power inside your body. You are only in Two-star Glory Plane, and you're trying to fully seize power from those divine creatures?\"Ye Futian was still sad about this fact. He looked at the Snow Ape and said, \"I need to leave now.\"\"Okay. Have you decided on which beasts to take away with you? Your mental power is not strong enough for those giant creatures yet. However, you can control some beasts and monsters that are in the Dharma Plane,\" the Snow Ape told him.\"You're not coming with me?\" Ye Futian tried to gain her sympathy. He believed that if the Snow Ape agreed to follow him, he would be the most powerful mage in East Sea Prefecture.\"Sorry boy, I have to stay here. As long as I am here, no one will know that the treasures have been taken. Remember, don't let anyone know that you have inherited the treasures. Otherwise, those greedy people would\u2014\" the Snow Ape stopped. Ye Futian was upset, even though he understood what the Snow Ape meant.Ye Futian looked at the monsters around him. He needed to stay under the radar so no one would know that he inherited the treasures by picking a monster that wasn't too flashy.\"Could you please call a Dark Wind Eagle to my side?\" Ye Futian asked.\"Sure,\" the Snow Ape agreed, then called on a Dark Wind Eagle that was in the Dharma Plane.Ye Futian walked toward the Dark Wind Eagle. He started to release the power from his eyes, which was generated by his natal spirit, the Storm of Eyes.The Snow Ape stared at the Dark Wind Eagle to prevent the eagle from resisting. The Dark Wind Eagle was a wind-element creature, and her mental power was also of the Dharma Plane level. Therefore, without assistance from the Snow Ape, Ye Futian would not be able to mentally control the eagle.This was the first time he had initiated the beast mastery ability with the Storm of Eyes. He felt as if the figure of the Dark Wind Eagle was imprinted on his pupils. His ruthless mental power was planting his will inside the eagle to control her, and the body of that eagle was shaking in the process.Suddenly, the Dark Wind Eagle reached her limit. She finally surrendered to the power of Ye Futian, and their souls started to resonate.\"Phew\u2026\" Ye Futian took a deep breath. The Dark Wind Eagle finally bowed down to him.Hua Fengliu actually knew the reason why Ye Futian had picked the Dark Wind Eagle as his first subject. Ye Futian was still upset that Hua Jieyu had left with the black eagle.\"Goodbye, Snow Ape.\" Ye Futian, Yu Sheng, and Hua Fengliu finally left. They looked at the statue of Emperor Ye Qing with a sense of attachment and gratitude.\"Go now.\" The Snow Ape nodded.The Dark Wind Eagle flew into the air, the sight of Ye Futian, the Snow Ape, the statue, and the monsters becoming smaller until they were tiny dots. Finally, they were gone.\"Go escort them,\" the Snow Ape commanded. The monsters obeyed her orders. People around Mount Tianyao were frightened by this herd of monsters. They were shocked and wondered why another monster tide was coming.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Buildings had fallen, and many people had died. The whole city looked grey and pitiful.Luckily, the monster tide did not last very long. Towards the end of the monster tide, aces from the East Sea Prefecture had come to help kill off demons and monsters. Thanks to them, the damage was not as bad as it could have been. Despite this, it would take a very long time for things to return to what it once was. There had also been consistent earthquakes in Qingzhou City since the monster tide had ended.After the people of Qingzhou Academy returned with General Qin's Dark Qilin Knighthood, it was rumored that the vice chief of the East Sea Prefecture was very unhappy. Then, in a fit of rage, he removed General Qin from his position as leader of the Dark Qilin Knighthood. This angered the knights, but they were suppressed by the aces from the prefecture the Qingzhou Guards who were under the orders of the City Lord, and the people of the Murong Chamber of Commerce. After a bloody battle, many of the knights had been met with a sad end, and the Qingzhou City protectors, the Dark Qilin Knighthood, had become a thing of the past.Then, City Lord Wei Meng was transferred out of Qingzhou City, and his place was taken by the leader of the Murong Chamber of Commerce, Murong Yunshan.Many people were displeased with this decision. Rumors were spreading throughout the city. They said that historical remains of Emperor Ye Qing had been found on Mount Tianyao, and that the continuous arrival of the East Sea Prefecture aces had proved this rumor to be true. However, no one ever made it back from Mount Tianyao with viable information. Some people only make it halfway, some people make it near the remains but get surrounded by demons and monsters. The rumors also say that it was because of these remains that the East Sea Prefecture's Vice Chief Xia Fan started the monster tide and aligned with the City Lord and the people of the Murong Chamber of Commerce to force Qingzhou Academy and Qin Shuai on to Mount Tianyao.When these rumors spread, the citizens were even more upset.However, it did not matter, because the Murong Chamber of Commerce held a lot of power in the city to begin with; now that their leader was also the City Lord, no one dared to speak out against them. To make things worse, they also have the East Sea Prefecture to back them up. The most that citizens of Qingzhou City could do was to complain secretly.At the Ye family house, a black wind eagle landed to drop off three people and then flew up to circle in the sky.Ye Futian, Yu Sheng, and Hua Fengliu had left the mountains after a short while because they were worried about their families.Upon their arrival, Ye Futian's heart sank at the sight of his home. The residence was torn apart with bits and pieces of the house scattered on the ground. Looking around, they could not find a single person.\"Father! Mother!\" Ye Futian ran through his home as he called out to his parents. The roof was caving in and the house was empty.\"Godfather!\" Ye Futian called again with sadness in his voice. Still, no one answered.Yu Sheng was also running around the residence with red eyes, looking for a trace of the family.What happened? What on earth happened to them?Ye Futian was scared, more scared than when he had jumped into the canyon.\"Ye Futian!\" At that moment, someone screamed out his name. Ye Futian whipped around to see a beautiful young woman run toward him. Her body flew into his arms and held on to him tightly.\"You're alive, you're still alive!\" said the young woman. Her eyes were red as she cried into his shirt.\"Feng Qingxue, where is my family? Do you know what happened to them?\" asked Ye Futian while he tried to support her. Feng Qingxue dried her tears, her face flushed red and said with her head lowered, \"Your dad and everyone else is fine. My father told me to let you know that they moved away from Qingzhou City. They wanted to tell you not to worry about them.\"\"They didn't say where they were going?\" asked Ye Futian, now relieved. Thank God nothing had happened to them.Feng Qingxue shook her head and replied, \"My father also told me not to tell anyone. Your family left secretly, but they didn't want you to worry, so they asked my father to relay the message.\"Ye Futian was stunned. Then he looked up at the sky and cursed, \"Ye Baichuan, you jerk.\"His eyes were red from crying. Being as intelligent as he was, Ye Futian knew there was something wrong with his background. Both he and his godfather carried secrets about their pasts. Now, his family had taken advantage of the distraction of the monster tide to leave in secret. He knew it was to hide a secret that no one would ever find out.From this day on, the Ye family did not exist in the City of Qingzhou.The East Sea was huge. Where was he supposed to begin the search for his family? They obviously did not want him to find them.\"Feng Qingxue, how is the city doing? Have the people from the East Sea Prefecture left yet?\" asked Ye Futian. If Xia Fan was still here he would have to be extra careful.\"They left and so have those from Heiyan City. Qingzhou Academy took a really big blow. General Qin has been removed from his position, and the Dark Qilin Knighthood has been dismantled. All of that is thanks to Xia Fan, the City Lord Office, and the Murong Chamber of Commerce. Murong Yunshan is now the City Lord. Recently, more and more outsiders have arrived at Qingzhou City in hopes of finding Emperor Ye Qing's heirloom but have all left empty-handed,\" explained Feng Qingxue all at once.\"General Qin has been removed?\" Ye Futian was shocked.\"Yeah,\" she nodded. Ye Futian stood frozen. The protector of the city and leader of the Dark Qilin Knighthood has been thrown out by the vice chief of the East Sea Prefecture. Who would have imagined that?Those high authority figures held absolute power and played with the lives of others. Had he not gotten lucky, he would have died on Mount Tianyao.\"What do you have planned for the future? Why don't you come stay at my place?\"\u00a0asked Feng Qingxue with anticipation.Ye Futian did a once-over of Feng Qingxue. At his piercing gaze, her face reddened.\"That's okay. I might actually leave Qingzhou City as well,\" answered Ye Futian. Feng Qingxue was dazed. Her heart skipped a beat upon hearing his reply. She asked, \"Where are you going?\"\"To do what I have to,\" Ye Futian said with a smile, \"Feng Qingxue, I should get going now. You should head home, too. Say goodbye to your father for me. Take care of yourselves.\"Ye Futian returned to Hua Fengliu's side. He placed him on his back and they headed outside with Yu Sheng beside him.Feng Qingxue remained frozen in place. As she watched him leave, she shouted, \"Ye Futian!\"He turned back to face her.\"I like you,\" she shouted at the top of her lungs after mustering up the courage to do so.He looked at her and a smile appeared on his face. \"I know. Who wouldn't like a person like me? Don't miss me too much.\"Finishing his words, he turned around once again and continued on his way. Feng Qingxue's tears fell and she crouched down to the ground.Ye Futian did not stop. He was afraid that if he gave in, he wouldn't be able to leave. Feng Qingxue was a beauty after all.\"If I wasn't here, would you go with her?\" asked Hua Fengliu, who was on Ye Futian's back.\"Why would I? I only need one fish from the sea. Fox is the only one for me,\" Ye Futian answered his question matter-of-factly. At this, Hua Fengliu rolled his eyes. \"How did a shameless person like you get my daughter to fall for you?\"\"Looks,\" was all Ye Futian said.Hua Fengliu had words for him.\"Master, when are you going to get better? If I keep carrying you like this people might misunderstand,\" asked Ye Futian in a low voice.\"If you don't want to carry me then just throw me on a corner somewhere,\" retorted Hua Fengliu. In that battle, it took all the power he had to rekindle his Qin Spirit. It also caused irreversible damage. At that time, he barely managed to keep standing.\"I'm sorry, father-in-law,\" Ye Futian apologized quickly. Only then did Hua Fengliu smile again.\"Where are we going now?\" asked Hua Fengliu.\"To kill a person,\" answered Ye Futian....In the air above Qingzhou Academy, a black wind eagle was circling. Its sharp eyes were trained on the Earth Elemental Pavilion below.It could not seem to find its target and continued to circle. Then, when a group of people exited the pavilion and headed for a restaurant off campus, the black wind eagle flew off after them. It did not attract the attention of the people below.As of late, things had been going great for Murong Qiu. Even though the expedition to Mount Tianyao failed, he was still able to establish a good relationship with the vice chief of the East Sea Prefecture. This aided his climb up the ladder at the Murong Chamber of Commerce. He had already been unanimously chosen as the successor of the chairman seat and his father was now the City Lord. The whole city was under his family's control.Although he understood that a lot of people disliked him, including most of his classmates, he did not care. They had no choice but to treat him with respect.The lobby of the restaurant was packed with people, many of whom were disciples of Qingzhou Academy. When Murong Qiu and his people arrived, almost everyone bowed their heads with respect. This was very satisfying to Murong Qiu. He proceeded to look for a place to sit with a smile on his face.After the food arrived at the table, his whole group began to converse.\"Junior Brother Murong Qiu possesses such a rare gift. You were able to reach the Glory Plane so quickly. You'll be in the Dharma Plane in no time, and then the Arcana Plane,\" said a disciple of the Earth Elemental Pavilion.The first four planes of cultivation were: Awakening, Glory, Dharma, and Arcana.To reach the Dharma Plane would mean you were sufficient to rise into the presbyter level and become an elder. If one were able to get a bit stronger than that, they would be able to become a Pavilion Lord. After all, the highest level anyone in the City of Qingzhou had reached was the Dharma Plane. In the past, Hua Fengliu was known as the city's number one ace because he was once in the Arcana Plane. He was considered a top ace in all of the East Sea Prefecture.\"Well, of course! Murong Qiu will take control of all of Qingzhou City in the future. Naturally, he will be the most powerful person in the city,\" Murong Qing boasted about her older cousin.\"That's right. Don't forget about us when you have the city in the palm of your hands, Junior Brother,\" someone said as they held their cup up to toast. Murong Qiu smiled elegantly and lifted his cup as well. He looked ahead as if he were in deep thought.\"Seems like I'm a bit of a failure when it comes to the ladies,\" he said. His utterance put the table in an awkward silence.It was not a secret that Murong Qiu liked Hua Jieyu but she ended up with Ye Futian. Then, when Murong Qing introduced him to Feng Qingxue, everyone thought he had it in the bag. In the end, it seemed like Feng Qingxue still had feelings for Ye Futian.\"That b*tch. Feng Qingxue is just ungrateful. She's not good enough for you. You shouldn't feel bad about it,\" said one of Murong Qiu's junior brothers.\"That's right, Junior Brother. Look at you now; the ladies won't be able to get enough of you,\" consoled a senior brother.\"Feng Qingxue is blind. I already told her to stay away from Ye Futian but she went back to him in the end. Now that he has been killed by the demons and monsters, she must be regretting her decision. She really missed out on you, with all that power in your hands,\" said Murong Qing.\"I actually hope that he's not dead. Things will be more interesting that way,\" Murong Qiu said with a cold demeanor.\"You're right. If he's not already dead, then he will be shaking in his boots when he sees you,\" laughed Murong Qing. She then realized that the restaurant was suddenly very quiet. Many eyes were watching their little group. She furrowed her brow in confusion and looked out the door. At the lobby entrance of the restaurant stood a handsome but arrogant figure.\"Everything you guys said is correct!\" Ye Futian's voice resonated. A frivolous smile was on his face.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He could not believe that Ye Futian had survived after jumping into the canyon full of monsters. How could the Monster Lord have let him go?Even the powerful swordsman, Xia Fan's uncle, who was in the Arcana Plane had died at the hands of the Snow Ape. In fact, many powerful mages had tried to sneak into the canyon to find Emperor Ye Qing's relics. None of them had been successful, and most of them had died.In the restaurant, other students of Qingzhou Academy were also looking at Ye Futian with confusion. The entire restaurant was in extreme silence as they watched the confrontation unfold.\"How did you survive?\" someone next to Murong Qiu asked him.Ye Futian shrugged his shoulders and said, \"I share the same first name as Emperor Ye Qing. His soul told me that I was destined to inherit his treasures. I just got back from the canyon after accepting his powers.\" People around him thought he was insane. They believed he was acting shamelessly to show off. Treasures? Inheritance? Destiny? What was he talking about? If he actually had these treasures, why wouldn't he try to keep a low profile?Yep, Ye Futian hadn't changed his style at all. He was still the lucky boy that loved to bullsh*t.\"You're alive, and you dared to come back to the City of Qingzhou.\" Murong Qiu still wanted him dead. \"It looks like I have to kill you, again.\"\"Students of Qingzhou Academy, listen to me. This guy, Ye Futian, betrayed our academy.\u00a0I cannot believe he has survived all that happened. Please help me execute him as soon as possible.\" Murong Qiu sounded cold. He now knew that Ye Futian was much more powerful than he was and he would definitely not fight against him alone. Around him, however, there were some powerful disciples from the College of Earth Element, including several mages in the Glory Plane. He believed that Ye Futian would die for sure this time.Some students came forward and prepared to attack. They were looking at Ye Futian with hatred in their eyes. Their director, Shi Zhong, had been humiliated entirely by Ye Futian and his master, Hua Fengliu. They felt so ashamed by this that they wanted to kill Ye Futian right then.\"This is the second time that Murong Qiu has wanted to kill me. If you help him, I will consider you guys his accomplices,\" Ye Futian said peacefully to those who stood in front of Murong Qiu. \"I will not show you any mercy.\"\"Shut up, you arrogant fool!\" A mage from the Four-star Glory Plane stepped out. The earth element power around him was covering his body. Soon, the power formed into armor. He knew Ye Futian was both a mage and a warrior, so it was important to formulate a defense system. Otherwise, he would be in trouble once Ye Futian approached him in melee range.Bang! Ye Futian stomped on the ground, then his body suddenly sprang to his opponent. He realized this guy was determined to kill him, so he had to skip the formalities and get down to business.The mage in the Four-star Glory Plane was forced to react. The earth-element power around his body formed into sharp lances, and with a swing of his arm, all the lances rushed toward Ye Futian. There was a piercing sound that rang through the air.Ye Futian actually sped up while facing the lances. When the lances had almost reached him, he suddenly leaned his body backward. His body slid through the lances without even a scratch. Moments later, there was a blast behind him. That was the sound of the restaurant wall being destroyed by the lances.The mage was starting to become nervous. He then urged the Spiritual Qi in his body to resonate with the power of the universe. A shadow in the shape of a giant rhinoceros showed up on his body.\"Go!\" He initiated his spell. The giant rhino charged toward Ye Futian. The earth began to crack under this beast. It seemed like the rhino was going tear Ye Futian's body into pieces.\"You cannot run from this,\" The mage started speaking in a cold voice. He believed that at such a close range, Ye Futian was definitely going to die.However, to his surprise, Ye Futian didn't even try to run away from the attack. His body made a sound like the roar of a dragon. With thunder surrounding him, he made a fist and readied his attack.He landed his fist on the rhino when the beast reached his body. At that moment, people had the illusion that it was not Ye Futian, but a giant ape who landed that fist. The attack was so powerful and fierce that it exceeded their knowledge of power.A clamor burst out. The giant rhino was killed by the attack instantly. Now, people's minds were blown, much like the rhino. They had never witnessed a warrior who could kill a creature formed by the spell of a mage in a higher plane. This completely changed their understanding of the differences between a warrior and a sorcerer. It was too shocking to be real.However, Ye Futian didn't stop there. His fist kept moving with authority toward the mage. It was too late for the mage to defend himself against the attack with any spells other than the armor he had formed before the fight.With a snapping sound, the earth-element armor shattered. The onlookers realized it was not only the armor that shattered though. His bones were also broken from the attack. He was knocked feet away, and his body smashed into the tables behind him.\"Murong Qiu, just go!\" Shen Yue yelled. He was driving the earth-element power of the universe with the perceiving ability of a Five-star Glory Plane mage. The earth element formed into walls. He had tried to lock Ye Futian's body within these walls to confine his movement into a tiny space.Murong Qiu ran outside the restaurant as fast as he could. He was shocked by the power Ye Futian had just shown. Ye Futian had defeated a mage in the Four-star Glory Plane with his martial arts techniques, and it was apparent that Murong Qiu must run for his life.Murong Qing was even weaker than her cousin. She had no choice but to run away with him in panic.Bang. With another booming sound, Ye Futian broke down the walls. He saw Murong Qiu running away, so he tried to chase after him.However, another wall suddenly formed in front of him, blocking the exit of the restaurant.Ye Futian turned around. He gave Shen Yue a cold glance and said, \"You are really pissing me off.\"\"What are you going to do about it?\" Shen Yue did not dare look down on Ye Futian anymore. He had covered his body with earth-element armor and prepared for the fight. He realized Ye Futian was much stronger than a warrior who was merely in the Two-star Glory Plane.\"You're done.\" Ye Futian's hands started to glow with a golden light after he spoke. He released his mental power, and a storm of the metal element was around his arms. It almost felt like his arms turned into the golden wings of a bird.\"What? How are you using that metal-element power?\" Shen Yue was so shocked. In fact, it was not just Shen Yue who was shocked. The students of Qingzhou Academy standing in the corners also could not believe it. Ye Futian had shown so many talents in various elements, including martial arts, thunder, and fire. Now there was metal element, too? Exactly how much power was he hiding?Actually, the metal-element storm around his body was entirely beyond the ability of a mage in Two-star Glory Plane.Even for the mages in the same Two-star Glory Plane, there was a significant difference in the strength of power they were able to use. Moreover, Ye Futian was a Mandate Sorcerer.There was no time to waste. Ye Futian's body formed into a bolt of golden thunder that broke through the air.Soon, another wall blocked Ye Futian's way. It didn't work at all because his arms had become razor sharp wings that easily cut the wall into pieces.Shen Yue's face looked gloomy. He was driving the power in that space like crazy. All the remaining lances and walls were rushing at Ye Futian. However, Ye Futian was so fast that his body had become a golden shadow. Every attack from Shen Yue totally missed its target.When a martial arts cultivator was this overwhelming and fast, he would be lethal for a mage, because once the mage's attacks missed their opponent and the mage was forced to fight in melee range, he was already defeated.Shen Yue could do nothing more but run away, but Ye Futian didn't give him a second chance. His body flew toward Shen Yue as fast as a bird, and suddenly a horrifying wound appeared on Shen Yue's chest. His face turned ghastly pale from blood loss.Ye Futian left him alone. Murong Qiu was still his primary target. He saw Murong Qiu running in the direction of Qingzhou Academy and kept chasing.\"We're getting a show.\" The students of Qingzhou Academy in the restaurant rushed out. They believed Ye Futian was going to kill Murong Qiu.Murong Qiu was surprised that Ye Futian was so fast, and the distance between them was disappearing. He was running so hard that he felt like his lungs were about to explode.There were a lot of students coming in and out the academy. Murong Qiu was screaming with desperation, \"Help!\"People were curious as to why Murong Qiu was in such a panic. They realized that Murong Qiu was being chased by someone, and was that\u2014Ye Futian? How could he be alive after jumping into the canyon?\"What's going on?\" Someone came out of the academy and tried to control the scene. It was the Director of the College of Thunder Element.\"Help me, Professor! He's going to kill me!\" Murong clutched at his last life-saving straw. He quickly hid behind the director.\"Ye Futian?\" The Director was surprised to see the student chasing after Murong Qiu.Ye Futian stopped charging forward. He was still staring at Murong Qiu and said, \"Sorry Professor, you may want to stay out of this. It's totally personal.\"\"Ye Futian, listen, you are lucky to have survived. Remember, this academy is a sacred place. Don't do anything stupid.\" The director was commanding him to stop.\"On my way here, I saw the whole city was destroyed by the monsters. People are crying in their houses, and this academy has been severely damaged. I believe, Professor, you know who is behind all of this,\" Ye Futian started saying. \"And what about General Qin Shuai and the Dark Kylin Knighthood? They do not deserve this! If you still believe this place is sacred, leave me alone.\"The director was ashamed. Xia Fan was the Lord of East Sea Prefecture, and even the Headmaster of Qingzhou Academy wouldn't dare question his ideas, not to mention the directors. However, now Ye Futian was accusing him in public.\"In fact, I believe we are not at the academy yet,\" Ye Futian said. The director was stirred from his resolve. Murong Qiu knew that the director might not be protecting him anymore. At that moment, someone else came to his side and told him, \"Just follow me.\"Suddenly, the student who talked to Murong Qiu flew into the air, bringing Murong Qiu along with him. A lot of students lifted their heads to look at them.\"That is Yang Yao, a student from the College of Earth Element. He is a mage of earth and wind double elements,\" people whispered to each other.\"Ye Futian,\" Murong Qiu was now floating in the air and taunting Ye Futian, \"How are you going to kill me now?\"\"Director, why don't you take him down?\" Murong Qiu then asked the director.\"Just leave.\" The director did not want to hurt Ye Futian. In fact, he actually appreciated this boy.\"I must kill Murong Qiu today.\" Ye Futian was stubborn. This attitude reminded the director of the time this young boy had stood in the snow, confronting the authority of the academy.\"I know you are good at wind-element power. Even so, you cannot outrun him.\" The director kept trying to persuade him, \"Yang Yao is in the Four-star Glory Plane.\"\"This is a personal matter,\" Ye Futian insisted.The director kept staring at Ye Futian. He could not believe that this boy was so stubborn and persistent.Could that be the arrogance of knowing nothing? Ye Futian had proven his power twice.\"I guess you have to show me your real power to persuade me.\" The director started talking again after a few moments of silence. Students were surprised by this demand.\"You are going to see something brilliant.\" Ye Futian laughed. Suddenly, a bright golden glow burst out of his body. As the crowd watched in admiration, two wings appeared on his back. He had transformed his body into the shape of a giant bird!All of a sudden, the place was silent.\"I am a Mandate Sorcerer!\" Ye Futian announced his power to the audience with pride.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They watched as his bright, shining Life Spirit was released. The Roc Spirit.Was this who Ye Futian really was? A frivolous, stubborn, and prideful young man?Everyone thought they understood him well enough, but now they realized that they were still underestimating him.He has already displayed his skills in both martial and divination art cultivation, plus his gifts in the thunder and fire elements. Now he was surrounded by a crazy storm of Spiritual Qi. Evidently, they were Wind and Metal Elemental. By the looks of it, he was a Mandate Sorcerer in at least four elements and cultivating in both arts.He had been so casual about possessing such a great gift. His behavior had once been considered presumptuous and arrogant, but now it was actually understated. If it weren't for Ye Futian's intent of killing Murong Qiu, the people of Qingzhou Academy would have never found out how truly gifted he was.Qin Yi arrived, running. Upon witnessing this scene, she had the urge to cry. Ever since returning from Mount Tianyao, her father had been decommissioned, and the Dark Qilin Knighthood was suppressed to the point of being abolished. After all, the enemy, Xia Fan, had returned to the East Sea Prefecture, and the city had fallen into the hands of Murong Yunshan. Murong Qiu was having his way.Her father had once been the protector of the city, the one citizens put their faith in; now who was going to get justice for him? Even the prestigious Qingzhou Academy had chosen to stay quiet. All she could do was continue to cultivate in hopes of becoming stronger and more powerful. However, there was a stubborn young man who had come to get revenge on Murong Qiu all on his own.\"I am a Mandate Sorcerer,\" said Ye Futian. Qin Yi suddenly thought back to the scene in her classroom. She remembered everything he had said. Those words had sounded so shameless before, but with what she saw now, Qin Yi could only laugh. Although she was laughing, tears began to fall from her eyes.At that moment, the wings behind Ye Futian flapped, and he rose into the air.Ye Futian did not cultivate Wind Aviation, but he possessed the Life Spirit. The Wind Elemental Roc Spirit was going to help him fly.\"Tell me, how should I kill you?\" Ye Futian asked Murong Qiu as he watched him mercilessly. Murong Qiu had once asked Ye Futian arrogantly, \"How are you going to kill me now?\"Murong Qiu paled and he shouted, \"Yang Yao, go!\"Yang Yao failed to react immediately but was still able to use a wind spell to carry the two of them away.However, Ye Futian's figure was gone in a flash. He soared in the skies just like a roc. His wings spread out majestically. Very quickly, he was able to catch up to Yang Yao. Ye Futian's speed was even faster than that of Yang Yao.\"Wind Blade!\" Wind Elemental Spiritual Qi gathered around Yang Yao and formed into a sharp blade. Cutting through the air, it made its way in the direction of Ye Futian.A sharp, piercing sound resonated. Ye Futian's golden wings cut through the Wind Blade, destroying it. His beautiful golden wings carried him toward Murong Qiu gracefully, just like a real roc.\"Hurry!\" Murong Qiu shouted in a craze after turning to see that Ye Futian was closing in on them.With one flap of his golden wings, blood was spilled. A bloody cut appeared on Murong Qiu's neck.Murong Qiu's eyes widened at the sight of Ye Futian. Then, in great fear, his shaking hands reached around his own neck. He lost all his energy, and his body began to convulse. He was only eighteen. These were supposed to be his best years. How could he die like this?The next moment, all the life slipped out of his body, and his limp body fell to the ground.Yang Yao was scared out of his mind. He let go of Murong Qiu. He tried to make a quick escape by himself. This was not the time to talk about loyalty amongst senior and junior brothers.BANG! Murong Qiu's body hit the ground. Everyone, inside and outside of the campus, were shocked beyond words. They could only continue to stare at the young man in the air.Ye Futian looked down at the Pavilion Lord of the Thunder Elemental Pavilion. \"Thank you, Senior.\"\"Hurry, go,\" the Pavilion Lord looked up at Ye Futian. He nodded and began to fly away.From a distance away, several people rushed over. Leading the group was the new Pavilion Lord of the Earth Elemental Pavilion. He did not know what to do. He wanted to chase after Ye Futian, but was stopped by the Thunder Elemental Pavilion Lord. Thunder and lightning suddenly appeared and blocked their path.\"He has not been a disciple of Qingzhou Academy for a while now. Even if his gift is like no other, you can't just let him get away with this,\" the Earth Elemental Pavilion Lord stated coldly.More people started to arrive. They all stared at Ye Futian's quickly disappearing figure and could not do anything about it. They all had mixed feelings about letting him go so easily.\"As the most prestigious place in all of Qingzhou City, Qingzhou Academy can't even compete with a teenager,\" said the Thunder Pavilion Lord. His tone was peaceful but it also contained disappointment and sadness. His beliefs had been shattered. Ye Futian had taught him something new today.To be young and reckless, sometimes he was very envious of teenagers. They could do whatever they wanted without fear because, in their eyes, there were no rules and no limitations.The people who had just arrived did not know what to do. In some of their hearts, they felt guilt.\"Personal benefits, power, rigid regulations,\" the Thunder Pavilion Lord busted out in laughter suddenly. It was as if he was laughing at himself. He looked ahead at Qingzhou Academy and bowed to the place of rich history. Lifting his head, he spoke once again, \"This place is no longer what it used to be. There is no use in staying.\"Finally, he turned and walked away. With his back to everyone else, he lifted his hand to wave. \"When that young man's name spreads all over the world, you guys will understand what Qingzhou Academy missed out on.\"Not too long ago, he had said that he wanted to see what Ye Futian was capable of, and he was not disappointed. A Mandate Sorcerer of four elements cultivating in martial and divination arts; a one in a million gift. Even so, the Thunder Pavilion Lord still felt like he had yet to witness Ye Futian's true potential.The people of the academy just stood there, watching him as he walked away. His back was bleak but at the same time unrestrained.Meanwhile, a black qilin departed from within the academy and began chasing in the direction of where Ye Futian left.In the faraway skies, Ye Futian soared in the clouds. Not long after, a black wind eagle emerged from the clouds and began to fly beside Ye Futian. Seated on top of it were Hua Fengliu and Yu Sheng. Ye Futian came to kill Murong Qiu alone, but of course, he would have a backup plan.His form changed back to normal and he landed on top of the black wind eagle as well. Hua Fengliu and Yu Sheng did not ask any questions. Ye Futian returned safely, that meant that he accomplished what he set out to do.\"Ye Futian!\" a voice called out behind them. Ye Futian looked back and saw a black qilin flying towards them. Seeing that it was just a black qilin, he did not feel the need to escape.\"Senior Sister,\" Ye Futian smiled and greeted Qin Yi on the black qilin.\"Are you leaving already?\" she asked. After killing Murong Qiu, Ye Futian could not continue to stay in the city of Qingzhou. The only way he would be able to stay was if Hua Fengliu was not injured, but obviously that was not the case. If it were, then Ye Futian would not have had to kill Murong Qiu in such a manner.\"Yeah, I have to leave the city now. Take care, Senior Sister,\" said Ye Futian. He felt bad for Qin Yi. Her father protected Qingzhou City but was decommissioned and no one was willing to help her. One could only imagine how she felt right now.\"Let me send you off,\" she said with a gentle smile.\"Okay!\" Ye Futian nodded. The black wind eagle and the black qilin flew side by side, getting far away from Qingzhou Academy....The Qingzhou coast had many large vessels headed in all different directions.Right now, many people were boarding a large ship by the coast. This ship was one headed for the City of Donghai.The distance between Qingzhou City and Donghai City was quite long. Naturally, Ye Futian couldn't fly the black wind eagle all the way there. Plus, Hua Fengliu was not in good condition, and couldn't handle flying for long periods of time.Yu Sheng piggybacked Hua Fengliu and waited in front of the ship.Ye Futian was having his last farewell with Qin Yi.\"Senior Sister, I really have to go now,\" he said softly.\"Alright. Remember to come back to visit me when you grow up,\" Qin Yi nodded. Even though she was sad, she kept a smile on her face.\"Okay, but you have to make sure not to forget me!\" said Ye Futian.\"How could I forget you?\" asked Qin Yi.\"I'm afraid that I'll grow to be too handsome and you won't be able to recognize me,\" he said with a sly smile. She stared at him. This rascal was still so mischievous.\"Goodbye!\" Ye Futian turned around and waved.\"Ye Futian!\" she called out to him. Ye Futian turned to look at Qin Yi again. Her arms were open and she had a big smile on her face. \"I'll let you leave with a treat.\"\"Senior Sister, you're putting me in a tight spot here,\" Ye Futian sighed and walked up in between her arms, holding her curvaceous figure with his arms.Qin Yi leaned into him lightly, her smile still bright. Sometime later she spoke again, \"Are you not going to let go?\"\"Oh,\" he loosened his grip on her and smiled at her. \"I'm going to miss you.\"Qin Yi looked at him without a word and then turned around. \"I'm going now.\"She made her way to where the back qilin was.\"Senior Sister, you have to take care of yourself!\" Ye Futian shouted. With her back to him, Qin Yi began to tear up. As her tears fell, she mounted the black qilin and flew away not looking back.Ye Futian watched her as she departed and let out a sigh. He could not help her with much. He only hoped that she would be strong enough to handle everything alone.He turned around a walked towards the ship. Both Hua Fengliu and Yu Sheng watched him.\"Master, we should board the ship now,\" Ye Futian said to them.\"Okay,\" Hua Fengliu nodded. On their way there he asked, \"How was the hug? Comfy?\"Ye Futian tripped over his own two feet. He looked over at Hua Fengliu and attempted to explain, \"Master, Senor Sister Qin Yi was feeling upset about what happened with General Qin. I was only trying to console her.\"\"Okay, I understand,\" nodded Hua Fengliu. \"You have to hug someone that long to console them?\"\"Master, you have deeply misunderstood me.\" He finished his words and walked ahead of Yu Sheng. Then, he crouched down and said, \"Yu Sheng, let me carry Master,\"\"Yu Sheng, let's go,\" said Hua Fengliu.\"Okay.\" This time, Yu Sheng did not listen to Ye Futian and carried Hua Fengliu onto the ship. Ye Futian watched their backs and tried to catch up. Nice guys always end up getting hurt.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Waves continued crashing on the rocks, while the wind shrieked. The sea breeze kept whistling and whipped around the old man's body. His gray hair was swinging, and so was his body. It almost looked like he would be blown away by the wind. However, he stayed immobile.Behind him, in the City of Qingzhou, some powerful sorcerers and knights mounted on beasts were heading that way. They looked at the ocean, and someone commanded, \"Lock down this coast! The Lord of the City ordered that Ye Futian shall not leave this city!\"\"A ship just left for the City of Donghai. Should we check the ship?\" someone asked.\"Old man, did you see a sixteen-year-old boy board that ship?\" a sorcerer saw the old man standing on the coast and asked him.The old man was still standing there quietly. He just stared ahead and stayed silent as if he wasn't listening.\"Answer him!\" A knight came forward and pointed his lance at the old man.The old man also ignored him. The sorcerer frowned at him, and the knight continued to threaten the old man. \"Are you looking for trouble?\"The wind was still shrieking, and sand was flying. The sorcerer mounted on the monster realized something terrifying was approaching. He suddenly noticed that the old man was condensing the power of the universe. Soon, he saw a terrible whirlpool of sand forming. It only took a moment for the vortex to descend upon them and ultimately engulf them all. The old man was still standing there quietly as if he wasn't doing anything.\"Please, don't kill us!\" All those powerful people were now begging for mercy. However, they had already lost their chance. The sandstorm had taken them all and lifted their bodies into the air. The old man also started to float with them.\"Please, we regret what we said!\" They were totally desperate.\"You have never seen the power of the Holy Bird. You should feel lucky that you can witness this power before you die,\" the old man said peacefully. His body soon disappeared. As soon as he left, the storm intensified and all the people trapped inside were torn apart.......Ye Futian was not worried about the people chasing after him. He knew that the Prefectural Administration Mansion would only be informed that he left after a long while. Even if they reacted as soon as possible and locked down the coasts, they would still have no idea where he was going. Furthermore, since the people chasing after him were scattered, the resistance he encountered would not be too harsh. Meanwhile, the Black Wind Eagle was flying next to the ship, prepared to attack anyone in Ye Futian's way.The ship he was on was enormous. There were a lot of private rooms on the ship that could house four people inside comfortably.\"Be careful, Professor.\" Ye Futian helped Hua Fengliu sit down. He and Yu Sheng then sat across from Hua Fengliu.\"Professor, do you have any plans for after we get to the City of Donghai?\" Ye Futian asked. It had been Hua Fengliu's idea to go to this city, so he believed Hua Fengliu must have had a plan.\"I don't want to talk right now.\" Hua Fengliu was in a grim mood.\"Sorry, I'm just kind of excited about seeing my fairy soon.\" Ye Futian was smiling.\"The City of Donghai is the capital of the East Sea Prefecture. You will run into many beauties there.\" Hua Fengliu was making fun of Ye Futian.\"Professor, please, I'm not that bad.\" Ye Futian believed Hua Fengliu was doing this intentionally.\"Okay, I'll trust you.\" Hua Fengliu nodded.\"Yu Sheng, how about you?\" Ye Futian turned toward Yu Sheng.\"I trust you, too,\" Yu Sheng said mockingly.\"I need some air.\" Ye Futian was embarrassed and left the room.After going up on the deck of the ship, Ye Futian started to enjoy the sea breeze. The City of Qingzhou started to fade away from his sight. His mind was now filled with emotions. He had no idea when he would be able to come back to the city he had lived in for sixteen years.Yu Sheng also followed him onto the deck. They gazed at the city together. That city had held so many memories for them.\"Yu Sheng, do you think your father is watching us now?\" Ye Futian asked.\"Even if he is, he's only looking at you.\" Yu Sheng sounded a bit sad.Ye Futian looked at Yu Sheng and realized that he wasn't very happy. However, he didn't know how to comfort him. Ever since they were born, Yu Sheng's father had always treated Ye Futian better than Yu Sheng. Even though he respected his father, Yu Sheng was somewhat resentful.Gazing at the sea, Ye Futian started to laugh. \"Yu Sheng, remember, even if someday I become the emperor of this continent as godfather expects, I would give that crown to you if you asked me. I promise you that I will share everything with you except my cute fairy.\"Yu Sheng nodded to show that he understood. When he was being punished by his father as a child, Ye Futian would confront his father and secretly share snacks with Yu Sheng. At that time, he swore to himself that he would stand by Ye Futian's side no matter where they were.The sea breeze was still shrieking and whipped at the boys. No one had any idea how legendary their future would be.There were footsteps behind them. Ye Futian turned around and saw two beautiful girls coming towards them. The two girls were the same age. Both of them were very attractive, especially the girl on the left who was wearing green. She was extremely charming.They realized that Ye Futian was staring at them. The girl in green naturally nodded back at him.\"What's wrong with your eye? Getting fixed on beautiful girls?\" The girl on the right started to chuckle with a wicked sense of humor. Ye Futian also started smiling. \"Why would I take my eyes away off of beautiful girls like you? Don't be mad, please.\"\"Don't listen to her.\" The girl in green began introductions, \"I'm Lin Xiyue, and this is Xiao He, my friend. Who are you guys?\"\"I'm Ye Futian, and this is my best friend, Yu Sheng.\" Ye Futian didn't stop smiling. \"Are you also from the City of Qingzhou? I don't believe we have met before.\"\"No, we come from the City of Donghai,\" Lin Xiyue said. \"We heard that relics of Emperor Ye Qing showed up in the City of Qingzhou. We asked our masters to bring us here to broaden our horizons. However, people told us that the place couldn't be approached at all, so we gave up. You guys are from City of Qingzhou, so have you been there?\"\"Yes, we have,\" Ye Futian nodded.\"You're bragging.\" Xiao He kept chuckling, \"Admit it. You're just trying to attract Lin Xiyue's attention.\"Ye Futian shrugged his shoulders. Lin Xiyue then asked, \"Why are you going to the City of Donghai?\"\"We're following our professor,\" Ye Futian responded.\"Good luck to you. The best academy in this province is there,\" Lin Xiyue encouraged them.\"What's your class and plane? I can guess your chances.\" Xiao He asked Ye Futian.\"A mage, in the Two-star Glory Plane.\"\"Good for you. I believe you will go to a decent academy.\" Lin Xiyue smiled and said, \"Now we need to go for a walk.\"\"See you later.\" Ye Futian then told Yu Sheng, \"Let's go back.\"Soon, they headed back to their room. After seeing them leave, Xiao He started chuckling again. \"Why did you hit on these strangers, Lin Xiyue?\"Lin Xiyue gave her a stare.\"That boy is a bad one, isn't he? But he's pretty handsome. The other one is a stud. So, Lin Xiyue, which one do you like?\"\"You're talking nonsense. Come on, girl, we just met.\"\"Even though we just met, it's okay for you to tell me your preference, right?\"Lin Xiyue gave up. She thought for a while, then smiled. \"I like Ye Futian better. He's cute.\"Xiao He sighed in disapproval and looked at her with mockery. Lin Xiyue tried to stop her. \"Stop thinking of crazy stuff. It was just a casual conversation. I know he is talented, but he is definitely not the very best in the City of Donghai.\"\"Of course you're looking for the greatest.\" They left and kept chatting.Several days later, the ship finally arrived at the City of Donghai. When Ye Futian disembarked, he was awed by the prosperity of the city. Countless ships were docked at the commercial capital of the East Sea Prefecture. Due to the geographic importance of this city, it had become the gateway of the whole province.\"Goodbye, Ye Futian.\" Xiao He waved at Ye Futian and Lin Xiyue was looking at them with a smile.\"I believe we will meet again.\" Ye Futian waved back. Later, he saw the girls leave with an old man.Ye Futian raised his head. He explained to Hua Fengliu, \"Professor, it was just some casual talk with the girls, I promise. Yu Sheng can testify for me.\"\"I'm used to it.\" Hua Fengliu did not take it seriously. Yu Sheng looked at Ye Futian with sympathy. The Black Wind Eagle landed in front of them. They got on her back, and soon the eagle flew to the City of Donghai.Compared with the City of Qingzhou, this ancient city was so much more prosperous. Monsters were flying in the air all over the city, and they served as mounts for powerful cultivators. Ye Futian and Yu Sheng suddenly believed that they had made an absolutely great choice to come to this city.\"Lead the way please, Professor,\" Ye Futian asked Hua Fengliu. Hua Fengliu took command of the Black Wind Eagle, and Ye Futian noticed that he looked earnest now, which was rare. Apparently, getting back to the City of Donghai stirred his mind.Eventually, they arrived at their destination. From afar, they saw an immensely spectacular mansion in their sight. It was almost as grand as a royal palace.The Black Wind Eagle landed in front of the building. Ye Futian had never seen such a majestic building. He asked Hua Fengliu, \"Professor, where are we? It almost looks like a royal palace.\"\"It used to be a royal palace,\" Hua Fengliu told him. \"About three hundred years ago, before Emperor Ye Qing and Donghuang the Great unified the continent. This continent was torn apart by warlords that controlled separate regions. The nation of Nandou was ruled by the Nandou family. After the continent was unified, the ruler gave a new order to this world. The Nandou family toppled and were seized from the throne. This was the mansion of the Nandou family.\"\"So, why did you bring us here?\" Ye Futian was curious.\"Because your future wife is living here.\" Hua Fengliu started laughing.Ye Futian blinked his eyes. He was surprised. \"So, your wife is the daughter of this royal family? How did you manage to pursue her?\"\"I was handsome, boy.\" Hua Fengliu was confident. Ye Futian believed he was boasting again.\"Professor, if I told the guards that I want to go to this place to see my girlfriend, would they kill me?\" Ye Futian was joking.\"You can try that,\" Hua Fengliu said. \"I have been prohibited from entering the City of Donghai. They told me that if I did, they would destroy my natal spirit. However, it has been already destroyed.\"Ye Futian was silent. He started laughing again and said, \"Don't worry, Professor. Someday they will beg you to come back.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Ye Futian's words went straight to his heart. Would there be a day that they would beg him to enter?His handsome face lit up with a bright smile. He said in all seriousness, \"I believe you.\"Hua Fengliu had no confidence in himself, but he had the utmost confidence in Ye Futian.\"Let's go,\" Hua Fengliu said lowly. No one wanted to enter that palace more than he did. The two women he loved most were in there.\"Master, you did this on purpose didn't you?\" asked Ye Futian. Obviously he was not really trying to run into the palace to look for his girlfriend. Hua Fengliu was handsome, talented, and known as the Qin Devil. Even if he was not welcomed into the palace, Ye Futian was definitely not welcomed either. Even though he knew that he was handsome, to walk in and say that the sixteen-year-old princess was his girlfriend as a Glory Plane cultivator would probably get his legs broken, and then he'd be thrown out of the palace.\"I wanted to give you a little motivation,\" chuckled Hua Fengliu.The three of them returned to sit on the black wind eagle. They were up in the air once again. Their clothes shook violently in the wind. Ye Futian looked down at the palace as the view got blurrier. This was going to be his number one goal, whether it was for Hua Jieyu or Hua Fengliu.When the black wind eagle touched land again, they were outside of another residence. This one was not as intimidating as the Nandou family, but it was obviously still the residence of nobility.After landing, they were able to see the entrance of the residence. Guards stood on watch outside and above the doors was a plaque: \"The Mu House.\"\"Let's go,\" said Hua Fengliu. Ye Futian carried him towards the entrance, but was blocked by the guards. \"Is there something I can help you guys with?\" asked one of the guards.\"Please relay a message to your master, Mu Hong. Tell him Hua Fengliu is here to see him,\" Hua Fengliu told the guard. The guard looked over at his colleague and nodded. One of them headed into the residence.Not long after, a young man looking to be about seventeen years old arrived. He saw Hua Fengliu on Ye Futian's back and gave a look of interest. He bowed lightly and said, \"Greetings, Senior. I am Mu Yunqing.\"\"I can't believe Mu Hong's child is already all grown up,\" smiled Hua Fengliu. \"Is your father not home?\"\"My father is inside, preparing the house to receive your presence. If you'll please follow me,\" said Mu Yunqing. His arm was outstretched, inviting the trio inside, so Ye Futian carried Hua Fengliu into the home.The Mu family house was huge. Their group arrived at one of the buildings within the residence. A stern looking middle-aged man stood there. When he saw Hua Fengliu, a look of confusion crossed his eyes. \"Hua Fengliu, what has happened to you?\" he asked.\"My old sport, Mu Hong. It's a long story,\" sighed Hua Fengliu.\"Come have a seat,\" Mu Hong said and a servant girl walked up with tea for everyone. A young girl beside Mu Hong sized up their little group.After everyone took their seats, Mu Hong spoke again, \"Hua Fengliu, you've already met Mu Yunqing. This is my daughter, Mu Yunni.\"\"This is Ye Futian and Yu Sheng. Ye Futian is my disciple and it is because of him that I have come to you,\" Hua Fengliu said.\"What do you mean?\" asked Mu Hong.\"You know that I have enemies in Donghai City, I don't want to drag Ye Futian into it. So, if you are willing, I was hoping he could stay here with you. You can treat him like a nephew, or even take him in as your disciple,\" explained Hua Fengliu. His intentions were now clear to Ye Futian.Hua Fengliu wanted to find support for Ye Futian, even if he had to beg.\"My father won't take just anyone under his wing,\" Mu Yunni glared coldly at Ye Futian.\"Yunni, watch what you say,\" reprimanded Mu Hong.\"You don't have to worry about his talent, old sport,\" Hua Fengliu reassured him.\"You had your powers disabled by the Art Saint. How powerful can your disciple be? Now that you're like this, you want to drag my father down as well?\" said Mu Yunni unwelcomingly.\"Be quiet!\" shouted Mu Hong sternly. Then, to Hua Fengliu he said, \"My daughter is undisciplined. Please do not mind her.\"Mu Hong picked up his cup and sipped on his tea. The room was quiet and he did not answer to Hua Fengliu's request.Of course, Hua Fengliu knew what this meant. At that moment, Ye Futian spoke up, \"Master, let's be on our way now.\"\"Okay,\" nodded Hua Fengliu. \"Please excuse us now, old sport,\" he said to Mu Hong.\"Aren't you going to finish your tea first?\" asked Mu Hong casually. He had no intentions of asking them to stay.Ye Futian already had Hua Fengliu on his back. Hua Fengliu smiled and shook his head. \"There's no need.\"\"Very well then. Mu Yunqing, Mu Yunni, go send off Uncle Hua Fengliu,\" said Mu Hong. The Mu siblings nodded and followed behind Ye Futian as they made their way out. After they left, Mu Hong let out a sinister look. Disciple? If he was willing? He had no lack of disciples.Hua Fengliu's powers had already been disabled. Plus, he has made enemies of the Art Saint and the Nandou family. Did he really think it would be easy to find someone to back him up?Ye Futian's trio stepped out of the residence and Mu Yunqing spoke, \"Take care now, Senior.\"The trio continued on their way but from behind they could hear Mu Yunni. \"Shouldn't they have known better? How shameless.\"\"They have it tough,\" laughed Mu Yunqing, no longer keeping up with his previous proper image.They made no attempts to hide their conversation. The words stung as they reached Ye Futian's ears. Yu Sheng had his fists clenched. Hua Fengliu felt guilty and said, \"I'm sorry, Ye Futian. You've suffered because of me.\"\"No, I haven't. Mu Hong is ignorant and blind. He just gave up a chance to be the master of the future emperor,\" Ye Futian said nonchalantly.\"You rascal,\" laughed Hua Fengliu. It looked like he was worried for no reason. \"With a handicapped man like me, people will only look down on you. They won't see your true potential. When you are able to control the world, they'll regret everything.\"\"Master, don't say that about yourself,\" Ye Futian felt terrible. He knew well and clear it was for him, and that Hua Fengliu had gone to beg Mu Hong.As the legendary Qin Devil, Hua Fengliu was extremely prideful. Now that his powers had been disabled, he did not care about his enemies. If it weren't for Ye Futian, Hua Fengliu would have never returned to the City of Donghai.\"It's okay; I still have some friends here. Let's go find them,\" said Hua Fengliu.\"Master, I don't want you begging others for me,\" said Ye Futian.\"Coming to Donghai City was my idea. Xia Fan wanted to kill you back on Mount Tianyao. Even though this city is huge, there's no way to say that we won't run into him. I can't protect you in my disabled state. I can't just let you be on your own,\" explained Hua Fengliu. \"Don't worry, this is just the plan for now. We won't have to do this after a while.\"\"Master, don't you understand? All those years ago, when your Life Spirit was destroyed and you were kicked out of Donghai City, none of your friends stood up for you. Now that you've returned abjected, who do you think is willing to help you?\" asked Ye Futian. \"I'll be careful and take care of myself. Don't worry about me. I didn't even die on Mount Tianyao, I won't die so easily.\"Hua Fengliu sighed and said, \"Alright then. Let's go take a look around the Qin Gardens.\"\"Is that where you used to live?\" Ye Futian guessed.\"Yeah, but it's probably deserted now,\" nodded Hua Fengliu. They set off on the black wind eagle once again.Hua Fengliu and Ye Futian stood in front of the Qin Gardens, shocked. The residence in front of them looked lively. They noticed this even from up in the air. It was definitely not deserted.\"Yu Sheng, go find out who the new owner of the Qin Gardens is,\" said Hua Fengliu.\"Okay,\" answered Yu Sheng. He walked up to ask the guard but did not get a name. All the guard told him was that the new owner's surname was Tang.\"Let's leave,\" Hua Fengliu said. His expression changed. Ye Futian thought this was peculiar but turned to follow.\"What's so scary about my last name?\" a voice rang out behind them. Ye Futian stopped in his tracks and looked back. A woman had walked out from the Qin Gardens. She looked to be in her thirties. She was very beautiful. One could only imagine how much more beautiful she was in her youth.Hua Fengliu saw the woman and smiled bitterly. \"I didn't think you would be living in the Qin Gardens.\"The woman looked at Hua Fengliu and began to give off an icy aura. She looked like she was about to erupt in anger. Ye Futian shuddered. She couldn't be an enemy of Hua Fengliu, could she?\"Who did it?\" she asked in a cold demeanor. She was referring to Hua Fengliu's disability. Maybe she wasn't an enemy after all.\"Forget about that. How have you been?\" Hua Fengliu asked.\"How do you think I've been?\" she asked him in return. Ye Futian was confused. Could she be Hua Fengliu's wife? Didn't she live in the Nandou Family Palace though?\"Who's he?\" the woman asked looking at Ye Futian.\"Senior, I'm Master's disciple,\" Ye Futian answered.\"Who caused his disability?\" she continued to inquire.\"Vice Chief Xia Fan of the East Sea Prefecture wanted to kill me. Master is like this now because he tried to protect me,\" said Ye Futian.\"That useless son of the Xia family? He dared to lay a hand on you? I'm going to kill him,\" said the woman.\"Stop acting crazy,\" Hua Fengliu stared at her. \"It's been so long. Can't you control your temper a little?\"If I hadn't been abandoned by a certain someone, would I have become like this?\" she asked. Ye Futian felt weak in the legs. So, it was an old lover.\"You still haven't married?\" Hua Fengliu's tone became gentler.\"Do you want me to marry that badly?\" Tang Lan retorted. Hua Fengliu did not know what to say.\"Come in. This used to be your home. Now, that you're back, it should be returned to its rightful owner. You can live here from now on,\" Tang Lan's tone also lightened.\"No,\" Hua Fengliu rejected, shaking his head.\"Why? Afraid I'll swallow you alive?\" She was furious. \"If you had married me all those years ago things wouldn't have turned out like this. Don't you feel like you were dragged down by that woman?\" asked Tang Lan.Ye Futian burst out in cold sweat. This....\"Let's not talk about the past,\" Hua Fengliu tried to brush it off. \"Who else lives in the Qin Gardens?\"\"I took in two female disciples,\" she answered.\"Young and pretty?\" asked Hua Fengliu.\"There is one,\" replied Tang Lan. \"Why? You like them young now?\"Hua Fengliu was dumbstruck. \"Stop with the nonsense. I just don't want your disciples to follow in your footsteps. So, it's best if I don't go in.\"\"Follow in my footsteps?\" At first, she seemed confused. Then, she glanced at Ye Futian and finally understood what he meant. Ye Futian was young and handsome. In a couple of years there would be another Hua Fengliu.\"Even the disciple you took in resembles you; but don't worry, my disciples have higher standards than I did,\" said Tang Lan. \"Come inside.\"Hua Fengliu smiled bitterly. He thought to himself, With a guy like Ye Futian, it wouldn't matter how high their standards were.\"Don't regret it,\" Hua Fengliu sighed. Then, he turned to look at Ye Futian. \"Hey kid, behave yourself.\"\"Master, I'm really not the person you think I am!\" Ye Futian was completely speechless. Who was that defensive against their own disciple?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was quiet and comfortable.A group of people arrived in front of one of the pavilions. They saw a girl, about twenty-years-old, come out of the pavilion. She greeted Tang Lan, \"Hi, Professor Tang.\"\"Nie Bing, this is Mr. Hua and his disciple,\" Tang Lan made the introductions. \"This is my first disciple, Nie Bing. The younger ones are now cultivating in Donghai Academy. Don't worry, I won't let Ye Futian see them.\"Ye Futian smiled wryly. His reputation had been ruined by Hua Fengliu.\"Mr. Hua,\" Nie Bing greeted Hua Fengliu.\"The place you used to live in has been kept vacant, but it's clean, so you can stay there,\" Tang Lan told Hua Fengliu.\"Thank you.\" Hua Fengliu nodded.\"If you had gratitude, you would not have left me.\" Tang Lan still resented him because of their past. Hua Fengliu did not refute this. He responded with nothing but silence.\"Ms. Tang, my Professor has been missing you all this time. He told me many times that he had failed someone and he played the guqin every time this memory came back,\" Ye Futian spoke for Hua Fengliu. Tang Lan looked at Ye Futian with suspicion. \"Is that true?\"\"Of course.\" Ye Futian looked serious. \"I did not know who that person was but today after meeting you, Ms. Tang, I totally understand that feeling.\"Tang Lan looked into the crystal bright eyes of the boy, and she started to believe he was telling the truth. She turned toward Hua Fengliu, and he was shaking his head, sighing. \"It's all just in the past.\"\"Okay, you do have some last shreds of a conscience.\" Tang Lan finally believed him. Yu Sheng was surprised that Ye Futian was able to help Hua Fengliu gain forgiveness from his old flame.\"Nie Bing, go get my guqin,\" Tang Lan told her. Nie Bing left and soon returned with a guqin in her arms. Hua Fengliu was overcome with emotion. \"Thank you for repairing Duyou for me.\"\"Duyou used to be your favorite guqin. Now it's time to return it to you.\" Nie Bing gave it to Hua Fengliu.Hua Fengliu took the guqin and strummed the strings with his fingers. They heard a unique sound coming out of the guqin, which brought the audience into an empty and secluded world, as if it had magical powers.\"Wow, an artifact.\" Ye Futian was awed. Objects enhanced with spells were called artifacts.\"Ye Futian, come here. It belongs to you now.\" Hua Fengliu handed the guqin over to Ye Futian. Tang Lan was confused about this. She had realized that Hua Fengliu would give this disciple everything. For the Guqin Devil, this guqin was almost as important as his life.Ye Futian took it carefully with both hands and replied with a smile. \"Professor, I will not let you down.\"\"I believe you,\" Hua Fengliu laughed. He knew Ye Futian was genuinely talented. He just needed time to hone his power.\"What's your plan now? Don't think about revenge. I always wanted to destroy his natal spirit because of what he did to you, but he was just too powerful,\" Tang Lan said. Hua Fengliu knew who she was talking about. It was his long-time nemesis, the Art Saint.\"I did not come here for revenge. I brought Ye Futian here to attend Donghai Academy. However, since the Spring Term Admission Test has ended, I'm afraid that he will have to wait until next year. You've stayed in this city all these years, do you know if there is anything I can do to get Ye Futian into that academy?\" Hua Fengliu asked Tang Lan.Tang Lan shook her head and answered, \"Unless someone of high authority at the academy asked for him personally.\"Hua Fengliu frowned, looking like he was thinking hard.\"Professor, why do I have to attend Donghai Academy?\" Ye Futian asked.\"In The City of Qingzhou, Qingzhou Academy is a sacred place, and the official students of Qingzhou Academy have a high social status in the city. Most of the important people of that city graduated from that academy. Even the Lord of the City is supposed to show respect to Qingzhou Academy.\" Hua Fengliu answered his question. \"It's the same for Donghai Academy. However, Donghai Academy is even more remarkable. Donghai Academy is not the only academy in this city, but it is the oldest one, founded more than three hundred years ago, when this continent was in severe conflict. The initial founding of this academy was intended to serve the major families in this city, and this purpose has not changed.\"\"So, you mean Donghai Academy is more than just a school?\" Ye Futian asked curiously.\"Correct. Donghai Academy is far more powerful and complex than you'd think. If you attend Donghai Academy, your safety will be better ensured,\" Hua Fengliu explained. Ye Futian nodded, realizing that Hua Fengliu had a more significant plan in mind. Otherwise, they would not have come here.\"I met your professor at Donghai Academy.\" Tang Lan sounded sad as if some past memory had just popped into her mind.\"In fact, we were about your age.\" Hua Fengliu was smiling.\"What a beautiful time it was. I was willing to devote my most precious youth to you, but soon after you met her,\" Tang Lan kept speaking.\"I made a mistake.\" Hua Fengliu was embarrassed.\"You feel guilty?\" Tang Lan was mad, and she being sarcastic with Hua Fengliu, \"To be honest, I was not as beautiful as that girl, but as far as talents and power, I was considered to be the top of my class. Why did I devote myself to the wrong man?\"\"I'm tired, Ye Futian, help me go back to my room.\" Hua Fengliu tried to close his eyes. \"Yes,\" Ye Futian responded.He lifted Hua Fengliu onto his back and carried him to his room. Tang Lan still looked like she was mad at what had happened in the past but since Hua Fengliu had lost his ability to walk, she began to sympathize and warm up to him.Ye Futian carried Hua Fengliu into the room and asked, \"Professor, Jieyu's mother was the princess of the Nandou family, just like my Jieyu. Is she also studying at Donghai Academy now?\"\"You need to find out for yourself.\" Hua Fengliu smiled.\"Okay.\" Ye Futian nodded and left Hua Fengliu to rest. He went back to Tang Lan, and she said to Ye Futian, \"Looks like you guys are getting along with each other.\"\"Professor was injured because of me,\" Ye Futian said. \"He was trying to protect me, reactivated his natal spirit, and suffered this irreversible injury as a result. Is there any possibility that he could be cured by someone\u00a0in this city?\"\"That is nuts.\" Tang Lan was shocked by what Hua Fengliu had done for Ye Futian. \"To cure him, we would need a special Mandate Sorcerer who is a healing sorcerer with mental power. Besides, he would have to be more powerful than your professor. It would be almost impossible to find someone like that.\"\"There is not a single person in the City of Donghai?\" Ye Futian's hope was rebuilt. He would do anything he could to cure Hua Fengliu.\"In fact, there is.\" Tang Lan had thought of someone. She realized Ye Futian was looking at her with expectation, so she told him, \"Just give up. Your professor would be happy enough that you are even thinking about how to cure him.\"\"Please Ms. Tang, tell me.\" Ye Futian looked stubborn.\"He's not going to do it,\" Tang Lan shook her head.Ye Futian was disappointed. He understood that Tang Lan had her reasons for not telling him.\"Goodbye, boy. Take care of your professor and get a good rest,\" Tang Lan said.\"Thanks, Ms. Tang.\" Ye Futian knew that Ms. Tang had helped them a lot by letting them stay there, and he was grateful. \"Professor is so lucky to have you.\"\"This is life,\" Tang Lan sighed.\"Which part of Professor attracted you to him in the first place?\" Ye Futian asked.\"Boy, he was handsome,\" Tang Lan answered and left, leaving Ye Futian standing there, surprised.Yu Sheng looked him in the face, then mumbled, \"No wonder why so many girls like you. You do have a pretty face.\"Ye Futian pretended to be mad and stared at Yu Sheng. However, when he turned around, he couldn't stop laughing....He was so eager to cultivate at Donghai Academy. This academy was apparently the best in all of the East Sea Prefecture.In fact, countless people came to this academy every year and tried their best to be admitted. However, only those with extraordinary talents could become students. The rest just gave up their first choice and went to the academies that were not as excellent. This was why everyone in Donghai Academy could be considered geniuses, and a virtuous cycle was formed that let this academy become even more powerful over time.The powerful sorcerers such as the Guqin Devil, Art Saint, and Tang Lan had all attended Donghai Academy. For a powerful family like Nandou, Donghai Academy had become the first and only choice for their offspring.Meanwhile, at Donghai Academy, a beautiful girl was inscribing. She was about sixteen-years-old, and she was focused entirely on her work. This concentration shed a holy glow on her body.\"Hua Jieyu,\" someone called her. Another pretty girl had entered. She was not as gorgeous as the one inscribing though.\"What's going on?\" Hua Jieyu paused her work and looked at the girl.\"Someone is inviting you to dinner.\" She smiled at Hua Jieyu.\"A guy?\" Hua Jieyu asked peacefully.\"No, it's a girl, and all she wants is to be overshadowed by your beauty at the dinner,\" the girl said jokingly.\"I'm sorry, I can't go.\" Hua Jieyu picked up her pen.The girl looked awkward. \"Why don't you even ask who he is?\"\"I can't go,\" Hua Jieyu insisted. The girl almost gave up.\"Can't you at least try this time? I promise you this is one of the greatest boys at this academy,\" the girl tried for the last time.\"I have a boyfriend,\" Hua Jieyu explained. The girl was surprised and asked, \"You're not making this up, are you?\"Hua Jieyu shook her head. The girl realized she was serious. She sighed. \"Oh my, so many boys at this academy are going to have broken hearts. Is this boy at the academy?\"\"No,\" Hua Jieyu answered.\"Is he an amazing boy? It must be really difficult to get you to fall in love,\" the girl said.The image of Ye Futian came into her mind, then she suddenly started smiling. That smile was soul-capturing. It was utterly irresistible, even for the girl next to her.\"He's a bad boy.\" Hua Jieyu didn't stop smiling. That smile was so sweet!The girl could see that Hua Jieyu was definitely not lying. She looked like she was in love!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The music seemed to be able to bring its listeners peace.From the music, one could feel happiness and a longing for love.In front of one of the buildings at the Qin Gardens, Tang Lan laid silently in a hammock, listening to the music. It brought her back to her youth and elicited memories from the past. She could not help but smile while she reminisced.\"Master,\" a gentle voice sounded. Tang Lan opened her eyes and was met with the sight of a sweet-looking young woman underneath the moonlight.The young woman's eyes were clear and pure, but carried curiosity when she looked at Tang Lan. She had approached Tang Lan without being noticed, and what was more, she saw a smile on her master's face. Her smile was beautiful, but the young woman had never seen it before. Was it because of the music?\"Tang Wan, why are you back?\" Tang Lan asked.\"I wanted to come back to see you, Master,\" Tang Wan answered softly. \"Master, who is playing the guqin? It sounds like they are trying to convey a certain feeling.\"\"He is back. The person playing is his disciple,\" Tang Lan answered. She never expected Ye Futian to be on par with Hua Fengliu at such a young age. His music was able to pluck a person from reality, pulling them into the mood of the piece.\"He?\" Tang Wan was puzzled at first but then remembered the person Tang Lan kept in her heart all these years. Her eyes twinkled. \"The Qin Devil?\"\"Yes. Since you're back anyway, you can show his disciple around Donghai Academy tomorrow, help him get familiar with the environment. When he enters the academy next year, you'll be schoolmates.\" Tang Lan chuckled and continued, \"But that rascal is good with words. Don't be tricked by his sweet-talk.\"Tang Wan blushed. Tang Lan said the guy playing the guqin was a sweet-talker. What could he have said to Tang Lan for her to say that?\"Go now. Get some more rest. From now on, you don't have to worry so much about me, focus on cultivation,\" Tang Lan said gently. Of her two female disciples, she favored this younger disciple more. Tang Wan was young and beautiful, sweet and enchanting. She was very much like Tang Lan when she was a young girl. Tang Lan hoped that her beloved disciple would not end up like herself.\"I understand, Master,\" Tang Wan replied. She turned and left the area but did not head back to her own living space. She followed the sound of the music and arrived at the building in which Hua Fengliu and Ye Futian were staying.In front of the building, she saw a young man quietly strumming at the chords of the guqin. He seemed to have fallen deep into the music; a smile adorned his face, which made him seem much more attractive.Tang Wan did not walk up to disturb him. Instead, she listened wordlessly from where she stood until the piece ended. The young man lifted his head and Tang Wan gave him a warm smile. \"That was beautiful.\"\"Thank you. My name is Ye Futian. Are you Ms. Tang Lan's disciple?\" asked Ye Futian with a smile.\"Yes. My name is Tang Wan. My Master wants me to take you around Donghai Academy tomorrow. Do you want to go?\" asked Tang Wan.\"That sounds great!\" he nodded.\"Then, I'll come find you tomorrow.\" Tang Wan smiled and was on her merry way. Ye Futain stood up, grabbed his guqin and entered the bamboo forest behind the building.A rustling noise came from the bamboo forest; there also seemed to be a low hum. Up ahead, Ye Futian could see the stalks of bamboo shaking from a gust of strong wind. When he walked closer to the area, he could see Yu Sheng seated on the ground. His body was surrounded by a dim golden light, making his already intimidating physique even scarier. At the same time, his face seemed to be slightly contorted, as if he were suffering from great pain. The low hum from before was coming from within Yu Sheng. It was as if a ferocious force was attacking his body from the inside.Ye Futian sat down on the ground and placed his guqin down in front of him; he began to play again. Under the sound of music, the suffering young man seemed to have calmed down but the scary force continued to attack. It growled and roared, almost like it was ready to devour Yu Sheng.After a long while, the force finally calmed down. Yu Sheng opened his eyes but the look on his face was icy cold. However, when he looked over and saw Ye Futian, his gaze started to warm up.\"Yu Sheng, how long did your father say you had to cultivate this technique?\" asked Ye Futian.\"Forever,\" answered Yu Sheng.\"Can't you stop?\" Ye Futian felt terrible.\"It's fine,\" Ye Sheng scratched his head and smiled. \"This way, I can become stronger.\"\"You dummy. Rest well,\" said Ye Futian. He left after picking up his guqin. However, Yu Sheng did not go rest. After Ye Futian left, he started to cultivate again. Ye Futian had almost been hounded to death on Mount Tianyao. Now that they were in the City of Donghai, there were even more powerful cultivators here. He had not cultivated long enough. At the plane he was in now, he was not capable of protecting Ye Futian. He had to become stronger and more powerful as quickly as possible....The next morning, Donghai City was basked in the warmth of the bright sunlight.In the Qin Gardens, Tang Lan sent people to take care of Hua Fengliu bright and early. Ye Futian felt bad for him, though, because everyone Tang Lan sent, was male. Hua Fengliu tried to protest in a roundabout way. He said that there were some things that females do in better detail. To this Tang Lan replied, \"There's me.\" Hua Fengliu could only cry on the inside. He should have known better than to come back to the Qin Gardens. This was pure revenge.Ye Futian was still laughing as he stepped out of the residence. He, along with Yu Sheng and Tang Wan departed on the black wind eagle.In the air, Ye Futian looked down at the large city. His feelings about the city down below were complicated. He was afraid of it, but at the same time he wanted to conquer it.\"Tang Wang, are there a lot of geniuses at Donghai Academy?\" Ye Futian asked.\"Yeah. All the geniuses from well-known families all across the East Sea Prefecture are usually sent to Donghai City to further their education and, of course, Donghai Academy is the first choice. For example, people say that over half of all the young Mandate Sorcerers in the East Sea Prefecture are gathered at Donghai Academy,\" Tang Wan explained.Ye Futian slowly nodded. He could understand this. It was only natural for families of Mandate Sorcerers to want to send their children to study at the best academy.\"Are you feeling stressed?\" Tang Wan smiled at Ye Futian. Her smile was sweet and beautiful.\"Stress?\" Ye Futian wanted to smile. \"Doesn't exist.\"\"Looks like you're pretty confident,\" chuckled Tang Wan.Ye Futian did not reply but, instead, threw her a question, \"By the way, have you heard of a person named Hua Jieyu at the academy? She's about your age.\"With Fox's looks, it would be impossible for people at the academy not to know her.At the mention of this name, Tang Wan gave Ye Futian a strange look. \"You aren't planning to try anything with Donghai Academy's number one beauty, are you?\"Donghai Academy's number one beauty?\" Ye Futian was dumbfounded. Almost immediately a huge smile spread across his face. She was actually here!Furthermore, she was more well-known than he thought. She really was a fox.\"Didn't she just get into Donghai Academy?\" Ye Futian asked curiously.\"Yeah, but her performance at the Spring Quarter Entrance Exams was incredible. All the higher-ups were shocked. Plus, I heard she comes from an impressive background. So, her popularity skyrocketed as soon as she entered the academy. She was the talk of the town. Also, with her looks it's only natural that she was crowned the academy's number one beauty,\" Tang Wan explained. \"Do you have a crush on her? I think you should just forget about it.\"Ye Futian looked at Tang Wan. It looked like she didn't know about Hua Jieyu's background. If she did, then she would have been able to guess that Ye Futian and Hua Jieyu knew each other.\"Why?\" he asked.\"Hua Jieyu has countless suitors at the academy but even the most popular guys have all been turned down. So, I don't think you have a chance.\" Tang Wan gave him a light smile.\"I get it,\" Ye Futian's smile got even bigger. \"Do you know why she turns all of them down?\"\"Probably because she's too prideful,\" said Tang Wan.\"It's because she already has someone she likes,\" he said.\"Who?\" Tang Wan was curious.\"Me,\" answered Ye Futian, smiling at Tang Wan.She smirked. \"Master said you were good with words, turns out they were for bluffing.\"Ye Futian was speechless in response to her comment. Then, thinking about Tang Lan, said he felt a bit upset.After dropping off the trio, the black wind eagle was off again.Donghai Academy was majestic. The main doors were open allowing access to anyone and everyone. In all of the East Sea Prefecture, no one dared to cause trouble at Donghai Academy, so the academy never had to worry about preventing intrusions.Students came and went. The youngest was around the age of thirteen or fourteen, and the oldest was not over twenty. Everyone looked upbeat; the campus was vibrant.\"There are so many pretty girls here,\" said Ye Futian as they entered. Hearing his very first comment about Donghai Academy, Tang Wan felt many pairs of judging eyes on them. It was embarrassing.As people walked past them, they could not help but stare. Ye Futian was handsome, Tang Wan was beautiful, and Yu Sheng looked strong and intimidating. Naturally, this trio would attract a lot of attention.At this time, a pair of eyes landed on Ye Futian and his friends. The corners of her mouth lifted into a smug smile.\"It's him,\" said a young woman around the age of sixteen.\"Mu Yunni, is he someone you know?\" asked a classmate of hers.Ye Futian was heading in their direction. His eyes did a quick sweep and saw the Mu siblings from yesterday amongst a group of people. It was hard to tell whether or not they were smiling at him.\"Can I help you with something?\" asked Ye Futian. The siblings had walked up to him.When Mu Yunni saw how confident Ye Futian looked, she was reminded of how pitiful he had looked to her the day before. She snickered at him, \"Found someone else to back you up?\"\"What's it to you?\" he asked with a smile.\"Nothing, I'm just asking,\" she laughed. Then the group brushed past Ye Futian and continued on their way. Right after walking past Ye Futian, Mu Yunni told the person next to her, \"That guy is the Qin Devil's disciple but the Qin Devil is now handicapped. He even had the nerve to come to my house and beg my father to take in his disciple. Isn't that such a joke?\"Ye Futian heard her words and stopped in his tracks once again. He turned to Tang Wan and jostled his shoulders. \"What happens if I beat someone up at Donghai Academy?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 48": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Legend of FutianCH 48Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTang Wan looked at Ye Futian with curiosity. Why would he pick a fight even before being admitted to the academy?However, Mu Yunni was very rude. If it had been her own master who was insulted, she wouldn't have taken it either.\"Students are not allowed to bully each other at Donghai Academy, but friendly competition is encouraged. Therefore, any fight voluntarily initiated by both parties of students will not be interfered with by the academy administrators. However, the parties in competition must make sure they have full control of their violence, which means no casualties allowed,\" Tang Wan mumbled to Ye Futian. \"Since you're not a student of this academy, if you insult the students here you will probably get your *ss kicked.\"Ye Futian felt awkward. Why didn't Tang Wan believe in him?The group of people around Mu Yunni stopped walking when they overheard Ye Futian and Tang Wan's conversation. Mu Yunni gave Ye Futian a glance in confusion. Someone started telling her, \"Mu Yunni, this guy wants to kick your *ss.\"Mu Yunni mocked Ye Futian. \"Why are you agitated? Am I wrong? Who was there at my house, begging my dad to accept him? Why don't you just beg me, and maybe I'll be nice and persuade my dad to give you a place.\"Ye Futian looked at Mu Yunni and said, \"I'm mad now.\"\"So what?\" Mu Yunni was still smiling at him. People around her were also laughing. Mad? Did it mean anything?\"So\u2026\" Ye Futian yelled, \"Yu Sheng!\"\"I'm ready.\" Yu Sheng clenched his fists and stepped forward. At that moment, Tang Wan felt that this big guy had become a beast. His body exuded a sense of danger.\"You are a Three-star Glory Plane warrior. Don't tell me you're afraid to fight,\" Ye Futian said to Mu Yunni.\"Yunni, I'll take him,\" a guy next to her said.\"I will challenge you all,\" Yu Sheng announced. Tang Wan was shocked. Even she knew that Yu Sheng was definitely stronger, but he was still a bit overconfident. He was challenging six Donghai Academy students who were elite amongst their peers. Some of them might even be Mandate Sorcerers.Ye Futian wasn't worried at all. Yu Sheng had been practicing techniques inherited from his father since he reached the seventh plane of awakening. Additionally, he had exceptional talent. Therefore, his power could not be measured merely by plane.He knew what Yu Sheng was trying to do. If he challenged only one student and other people got involved, then it was no longer a friendly competition. They were new to this place, so they still had to comply with the rules. Yu Sheng was very smart by challenging all those students.Mu Yunni and her brother looked embarrassed. The people who came to their house begging their father to accept them were now challenging all of them?\"How can I reject you, since you're asking for it?\" Mu Yunqing didn't take Yu Sheng seriously. However, he still had absolute confidence. He was only seventeen years old but already a Four-star Glory Plane Mandate Sorcerer. He was indeed one of the top students at Donghai Academy.The moment he agreed to fight, Yu Sheng stomped on the ground, and his body shot toward Mu Yunqing. He had endured this family long enough, since Hua Fengliu was rejected and humiliated yesterday. He believed it was now time to teach them a lesson.The ground fissured and Yu Sheng's body was covered with a dark golden glow, as if he was wearing solid armor. He was much taller than the average person, and with the armor, he almost looked like a knight sent by God.\"This boy is so\u2026\" Tang Wan was shocked. Yu Sheng had not even reached Mu Yunqing yet, and Tang Wan had already perceived the real power in his body.Not only Tang Wan, but other people being challenged obviously sensed Yu Sheng's power. Two people stepped forward, and both of them started to condense elemental power into spells. One of them created a chain that appeared from the ground to shackle Yu Sheng's body, and another one shot a sharp golden arrow in his eyes.Yu Sheng blocked the attacks by merely putting his arms in front of his body. The golden arrow broke into pieces the moment it reached his arms, and the chain was easily torn apart.Yu Sheng had almost reached their bodies when they started to flee from Yu Sheng's range of melee attack. Their speed was breakneck, because both of them were powerful mages who also cultivated martial arts techniques.Unfortunately for them, Yu Sheng was faster. They saw a golden giant blocking their way. They were frightened because they had never seen anyone who could corner them in a fight like Yu Sheng did. He was so fast that they were defeated before they had fully employed the power of their attacks.Bang. Yu Sheng's arms swept onto them. They were knocked back to the ground, and their bodies were smashed.Yu Sheng kept charging forward towards Mu Yunni. The ground was shaking with his steps. At that moment, Mu Yunni's face turned deadly pale. She apparently had just realized this strong guy was way more powerful than she was.\"Just go, I'll take him,\" Mu Yunqing told his sister. Mu Yunni had to obey. She ran as Mu Yunqing started to attack Yu Sheng. She made sure she was in a safe place and started watching them fight. She believed her brother could take care of that crazy big guy, and then they could beat up Ye Futian together.Other students of Donghai Academy were attracted to this place by the fight. The moment they saw Yu Sheng, they wondered why they had never met this guy before. They believed he was also a student of Donghai Academy, because he was mighty.Mu Yunqing unleashed the natal spirit he had inherited from his father. The natal spirit was a Golden Eagle.A Golden Eagle was a powerful monster that consisted of both gold and wind elements of power. It was similar to the Ye Futian's Divine Bird. However, it was weaker.After the natal spirit was unleashed, wings appeared behind his body. His whole body was now floating in the air, and the horrifying power of gold and wind elements were condensing around him. The power then formed into sharp lances that were pointed at Yu Sheng.\"Go!\" Mu Yunqing's wings shook, and the lances suddenly started rushing at Yu Sheng, piercing the air. With enhancement from his wind element, the lances were much faster than expected.Yu Sheng didn't try to dodge the attacks at all. He directly swung his arms toward the lances. People were shocked at how it was possible for a warrior to destroy the spells with martial arts techniques.The moment Yu Sheng's arms made contact with the lances, a golden shadow enveloped his body. The golden shadow soon turned into whirlpools and began to engulf all the Spiritual Qi of the universe. The lances were quickly absorbed by the whirlpools, and after the lances were gone, barbs grew out of Yu Sheng's arms.Mu Yunqing didn't give up on his attacks. He held the sharpest lance by himself and charged toward Yu Sheng. His body was as fast as thunder, and people started to worry about Yu Sheng.Yu Sheng swung his arms again. However, this times the barbs detached from his arms and shot toward Mu Yunqing. Mu Yunqing blocked the barbs by closing his wings to entirely cover his body. However, this movement also blocked his own sight. When he opened up the arms again, Yu Sheng was almost in melee range.Mu Yunqing could do nothing but run away from the momentum of Yu Sheng.Yu Sheng definitely would not let him go that easily. He stomped hard on the ground, and it began to crack under him. His body suddenly rushed toward Mu Yunqing. People witnessed Mu Yunqing being approached by a golden light.\"Be careful!\" Mu Yunni tried to alert her brother. It was too late. Mu Yunqing was shocked to find himself caught by Yu Sheng. Yu Sheng's arms were clamping on his foot. He couldn't fight against what happened next. With a sudden pull, he was smashed to the ground.With a loud thump, Mu Yunqing's body hit the ground. He laid there, entirely immobilized.\"What a beast.\" The audience was shocked by this absolute power. Was he really a warrior? Yu Sheng's power had transformed their attitudes toward martial arts cultivators. They had never seen a warrior who could trounce a Mandate Sorcerer.Yu Sheng kept stepping forward. People around Mu Yunni moved out of his way because they were too frightened to fight against this guy. Mu Yunqing had already shown them that Yu Sheng was overwhelming.\"What are you doing?\" Mu Yunni was overcome with fear when she saw Yu Sheng walking toward her. She was trying to run away by unleashing her natal spirit, which was also a Golden Eagle.That little resistance did not cause any trouble for Yu Sheng. He easily grabbed Mu Yunni by the arm. She did not dare attack him since he was now as ferocious as a beast.The next moment she was being pulled to her brother.\"Let me go!\" She screamed.Yu Sheng smashed her to the ground next to her brother. They were both now lying on the ground, severely injured.\"Now you know that your father does not deserve to be his professor.\" Yu Sheng was humiliating them to return the humiliation they had suffered yesterday. Hua Fengliu had brought them to their house, and this family had rejected them. They had been destined to taste revenge because of Yu Sheng's bad temper.Yu Sheng's fury was gone. He was no longer a beast, just a big boy. He quietly walked back to Ye Futian.It took a long while for Mu Yunqing and his sister to stand up again. They were staring at Ye Futian and Yu Sheng with resentment.\"I'll remember you.\" Mu Yunni gnashed his teeth in anger.\"Go ahead, tell your father that you've been beaten by us,\" Ye Futian kept humiliating them. Mu Yunni was so angry. However, there was nothing she could do. It would be a shame if they had to go back and tell their father about the fight.Mu Yunqing and his sister were crestfallen. Tang Wan looked at Ye Futian and believed he was talking like that intentionally. There were a lot of people watching, so these guys would definitely not tell their father what had happened.\"Looks like you have to go.\" Tang Wan forced out a smile. These guys had beat up students on the first day they came to the school. It was impossible for them to stay here any longer.\"You told me that professors at Donghai Academy don't care whether we fight.\" Ye Futian was confused.\"They won't, but those you just beat have classmates, who do care,\" Tang Wan said.\"It's okay. I still need to find my girlfriend,\" Ye Futian ignored her warning. Tang Wan followed him and asked in a lowered voice, \"Who is your girlfriend? Don't tell me it's Hua Jieyu.\"\"How did you know that?\" Ye Futian responded. Tang Wan was surprised and stopped talking.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 49": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Legend of FutianCH 49Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayDonghai Academy was enormous. After exploring more of the academy, the architecture on campus really opened Ye Futian's eyes. The buildings were erected on ascending stairs. To see the building at the very top of the stairs, one would have to tilt their head toward the sky. A magnificent view indeed.\"Donghai Academy consists of seven schools: the schools of the Emperor Star, Ruinous Star, Power Star, Flirting Star, Treasury Star, Finance Star, and Minister Star. That group from before was from School of the Flirting Star, and your 'girlfriend' is from the School of the Emperor Star,\" explained Tang Wan. Her eyes were full of distrust when she used the word 'girlfriend.'\"Back in Qingzhou Academy, the schools were divided by occupation. Does Donghai Academy do that?\" asked Ye Futian.\"No, each of the seven schools consists of cultivators from different classes. Each school has their own powerful figures backing them up. It's all really complicated. While they help develop the schools, these powerful figures are also trying to increase their own powers,\" Tang Wan lowered her voice and explained to Ye Futian.\"So complicated,\" said Ye Futian.\"Yeah,\" nodded Tang Wan. \"Because things are this way, the competition between the schools is very rigorous, and they pick fights with each other all the time; but within the schools, everyone is very united. So, when Yu Sheng picked that fight with the group from the School of the Flirting Star, it was the equivalent of picking a fight with their whole school. I personally think it's best for you both to leave for the time being.\"Ye Futian smiled but did not say anything. Tang Wan continued, \"Plus, Hua Jieyu was handpicked by the officials of the Emperor Star school as soon as she entered the academy. So, she's not among the ordinary student pool anymore. She cultivates up at the Emperor Star building. You wouldn't be able to go up there even if she was your girlfriend.\"\"She certainly is incredible,\" Ye Futian muttered to himself. He turned around and saw the crowd following from afar. Everyone saw what had happened between them and the students from the Flirting Star school and knew that group would never let them go so easily. So, now they followed Ye Futian and his friends in anticipation of what would happen next.\"If I leave now, would I lose face?\" Ye Futian asked for Tang Wan's opinion.She stared at him. How was he still in the mood to joke around? She had no idea what he was thinking.Just as they were speaking, a group of people approached looking almighty. Mu Yunqing and Mu Yunni, who had just been defeated by Yu Sheng, were also among them. The way they looked at Ye Futian and Yu Sheng was not friendly at all.They could not believe that he really chose to stick around. He really was not afraid to die.Ye Futian realized that his opponents had him and his friends surrounded. He looked to Mu Yunni and said, \"And here I was, wondering how arrogant you guys were. Is this all you've got?\"Mu Yunni could not say anything to that but no matter what they had to have their revenge.The group moved in closer to Ye Futian, determined and ferocious. Ye Futian asked Tang Wan, \"Can I reject their challenge?\"Tang Wan rolled her eyes. He would not leave when she told him to and now that he has beaten these people up, he wanted to turn down their challenge? There was no way they were going to let him go.\"Take care of yourself,\" Tang Wan said weakly. She then took several steps back without a word. Ye Futian stared at her, eyes wide, jaw open. Where was the loyalty?Different types of Spiritual Qi flowed crazily. The group of these people closed in on Yu Sheng carefully.\"Yu Sheng, make a move,\" said Ye Futian. As soon as he spoke, Yu Sheng charged forward wildly.Several of the more powerful cultivators surrounded Yu Sheng. Their sorcery erupted all at once.Vines thicker than his arm curled around Yu Sheng's body, entangling his arms and legs. This was Earth Elemental sorcery. Soon, his entire body was buried beneath the vines.\"Ice Seal!\" A gush of cold air rolled in and further buried Yu Sheng and the vines in a layer of ice.BOOM! The loud sound had come from Yu Sheng's right foot. His ice-covered foot took a large step forward, and the spell was broken.\u00a0Above his violent figure appeared a dim golden light, and he continued to charge forward at the opposing group.\"Disperse!\" ordered the leader of the group.\u00a0Immediately, a wind spell was cast over the whole group, aiding them in a speedy getaway. Then, the spell formed a bubble and encapsulated Yu Sheng.Ye Futian squinted his eyes at the scene. It was very obvious that the group benefited from having cultivators of different elements work together. This made them stronger in battle.The Mu siblings led a few people in Ye Futian's direction. Their hatred of him surpassed that of Yu Sheng, who was the one who had actually defeated them in battle.Two people charged at Ye Futian as their Spiritual Qi went haywire.From one of their bodies, the roar of a tiger was emitted, and his Spiritual Qi created a golden tiger. The person's speed also increased to that of a tiger. He pounced on Ye Futian with an outstretched hand. The hand as slightly curved, as if to mimic a tiger's paw. This person was a Metal Elemental cultivator of martial and divination arts. He was using Metal Elemental Spiritual Qi to fight in close-range.\"Third level of the Glory Plane,\" said Ye Futian. He could feel his opponent's aura. Ye Futian remained unmoved as a ferocious Earth Elemental force erupted from his body. Faintly, people were able to see a giant ape appear on Ye Futian's body. Born from the collection of Spiritual Qi, the ape possessed an inhumane amount of strength.Even though both animals had been formed from Spiritual Qi, Ye Futian's giant ape was obviously more intimidating than the tiger demon.As his opponent got closer, Ye Futian stuck out his arm. With one loud growl of the giant ape, the image of the tiger exploded. Following that, the giant hand of the ape demon wrapped around the opponent's neck and picked him up off the ground. A second later, he was smashed into the ground.The loud crash mimicked that of the Mu sibling's hearts. Ye Futian smiled at the two and proceeded to race towards them. At the same time, the second person had also approached Ye Futian without hesitation was knocked out by a single punch.Mu Yunqing and Mu Yunni released their Life Spirits and were lifted into the air. Even though they had been injured during the previous fight, they were still capable of battle. At this moment, a bright light shone from Ye Futian's back as he ran. The wings of the Roc carried him up into the air as well. At the speed of lightning, he flashed before the siblings. The body of a dragon, strength of an ape, and the agility of a Roc.\"A Mandate Sorcerer with a Roc Spirit!\" People were amazed as they witnessed this scene. It was rare to meet a Mandate Sorcerer, but even more rare to meet a Mandate Sorcerer with a Roc Spirit. Different Life Spirits were able to bring the Mandate Sorcerer different levels of power. For example, both the Roc and the Golden Eagle were Wind and Metal bi-elemental Life Spirits, but the power from the Roc brought Ye Futian more power, making it super easy to defeat the Golden Eagle. Furthermore, Life Spirits grew along with the Mandate Sorcerers. Strong Life Spirits would only get stronger with time.Tang Wan was dumbfounded. No wonder Ye Futian was so arrogant, turns out he had every right to be.\"Watch out!\" warned Mu Yunqing. By the time he completed his warning Ye Futian had already arrived in front of him.Mu Yunqing did not look too good. He proceeded to rush toward Ye Futian even though he knew his Life Spirit could not compare to that of Ye Futian but he was in a higher plane. He did not believe he would lose to Ye Futian.The two orbs of golden light clashed in the air. The people below watched as the two continued their close-range combat.\"How can he be so strong?\" People questioned Ye Futian's powers as they watched him fight a cultivator of a higher level than himself. He even had the upper hand. Soon, Mu Yunqing was struck by Ye Futian's fist and lost his balance. In the next second, Ye Futian had already placed his foot on his body, slamming Mu Yunqing directly into the ground. This was too violent.Mu Yunni began to run away again when she noticed Ye Futian's attention shifted to her. This time was no different from her battle with Yu Sheng. The only exception was that this time was more direct than the last. One punch and she was off. The Mu siblings were cruelly defeated twice in a day. This may leave a deep emotional scar on the both of them.Many people could not bear to look at Mu Yunni. She was a pretty girl, after all, Ye Futian and Yu Sheng should have taken it easy on her!Back on Yu Sheng's side, there were also multiple people lying on the ground. Yu Sheng was too wild, just like the God of War.\u00a0Had it not been for the alliance of different elemental sorcerers, no one would have been able to compete with Yu Sheng, not even the two five-starred Glory Plane cultivators.In a flash, Ye Futian attacked a Wind Elemental sorcerer in the air. Very quickly, the sorcerer was pushed far away. It was pitiful.The School of the Flirting Star is screwed, everyone thought to themselves. They had obviously underestimated Ye Futian and Yu Sheng's powers. The only ones standing now were the two five-starred Glory Plane cultivators. However, after Ye Futian joined Yu Sheng, Yu Sheng was like a beast who had just broken free. In one quick sweep, the whole lot was lying on the ground. They all looked so ferocious when they arrived but now \"pitiful\" was the only word to describe them. Many people pitied the School of the Flirting Star. This was incredibly humiliating for them.Who were these two anyway? They were way too violent.A black wind eagle swooped down from the skies and landed by Ye Futian. \"Let's go, Yu Sheng!\"The two walked to the eagle. Tang Wan rolled her eyes at Ye Futian. He did know when to make an escape.\"My girlfriend will come looking for you. When she does, bring her to the Qin Gardens,\" Ye Futian whispered in Tang Wan's ear. Then, they mounted the black wind eagle and ascended into the vast sky. He wasn't really dumb enough to walk into the School of the Emperor Star screaming for his girlfriend.\"Remember, my name is Ye Futian!\" Ye Futian screamed. His words were heard by everyone down below. To the students of the Flirting Star school, his words were a form of mockery.Tang Wan thought of the words Ye Futian had left her with. A strange look crossed her eyes. Could this have been his true intention?Hua Jie will come looking for me? She mumbled to herself. At the thought of the beautiful girl, she shook her head lightly. She must have been overthinking. Ye Futian is always joking around. Maybe this was also a joke.In the air, Ye Futian watched as Donghai Academy got smaller and smaller. He then muttered under his breath, \"Fox, this was the only way I could think of to let you know. I'm here!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 50": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Legend of FutianCH 50Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe news that students from the School of the Flirting Star were defeated soon spread around the Donghai Academy like wildfire. If it had merely been friendly competition within the academy, people wouldn't have reacted so strongly. However, in this fight, two students who were known as geniuses at this academy were entirely crushed by two unknown boys below their planes. This was huge news.Besides, the audience may have somewhat embellished the details of the fight. They had told other students that one boy was a stud with explosive power like a monster. They claimed that it was impossible to find someone more talented than this strong guy in Donghai Academy, and in the future, he was going to be a legend. Still, a lot of prodigies at this academy didn't buy it.They considered the other boy a freak. He was a Mandate Sorcerer, specializing in both sorcery and martial arts. His natal spirit was a Divine Bird. What was even more impressive was that both his speed and his strength were at the top level. He had easily toppled Mu Yunqing, who was actually two planes higher than him.Plus, this boy was really arrogant. When he left, he had announced that people should remember his name, Ye Futian.People started to discuss their origin, and some of them came to Tang Wan because she knew these boys.Students in the School of the Emperor Star were also discussing. In fact, those truly powerful students didn't care at all. They had always believed that they were too talented to be compared to others. They had considered the friendly competition that had happened at the academy small. However, there were some among them who enjoyed gossiping about these 'small-time fights.\"Shu Yuyan was one of them. She was a lively girl who enjoyed making fun of people.On the top floor of the School of the Emperor Star, Shu Yuyan entered the room, and she saw another beautiful girl standing beside the window, looking down at the scenery below. That was one of the spots where people were able to enjoy the full view of Donghai Academy.\"Hua Jieyu, my heart trembles even when I just see you standing there,\" Shu Yuyan started with a compliment. Hua Jieyu turned to her, smiled and said, \"No more party invitations. I'm not going anywhere.\"\"I know, I know, my goddess. Can't we just chat?\" Shu Yuyan knew she had been misunderstood.\"Did you know that something funny happened yesterday? Some students from the School of the Flirting Star were beaten up by outsiders, and more amazingly, the outsiders were in lower planes. Is it possible that some other academy in the City of Donghai sent these guys to intentionally provoke us?\" Shu Yuyan started to talk about the exciting fight yesterday.\"I don't know,\" Hua Jieyu answered. She seemed not to be interested at all.\"People said both of them were really cute. One was strong and wild as a beast, and the other one was particularly handsome. It was also said that a lot of girls witnessing the fight were hopelessly attracted to the boys. They fought over who was more handsome and charming,\" Shu Yuyan went on.\"So, which one do you prefer?\" Hua Jieyu smiled and asked.\"I wasn't there. The handsome boy seemed to be really arrogant. He claimed that we should remember his name when he left.\" Shu Yuyan laughed, \"Did he truly believe that he was more talented than all the geniuses at this academy?\"\"You seem to be curious enough about it,\" Hua Jieyu made fun of her.\"And you're not curious at all. You know nothing but cultivation,\" Shu Yuyan refuted. \"Okay, okay, I know you're not interested at all. See you.\"When she turned around to leave, she was mumbling, \"Ye Futian, this name is arrogant enough to be remembered.\"Hua Jieyu heard the name, and her body trembled with shock. She stopped Shu Yuyan and asked, \"What was that name again?\"Shu Yuyan looked at her and said, \"Ye Futian. It's the name of the handsome one.\"She was confused when Hua Jieyu heard the name and suddenly started laughing. This was the first time Shu Yuyan had seen such bright laughter on her face. She asked, \"What's wrong with you?\"Hua Jieyu was laughing too hard to stop at that moment. She didn't answer the question.\"Come on, don't tell me you're attracted to him just because of his name.\" Shu Yuyan was really curious.\"No, I'm not.\" Hua Jieyu finally stopped laughing. She then asked, \"Were there only two boys in the fight?\"\"They came with a student from the School of the Minister Star, Tang Wan,\" Shu Yuyan told her.\"Okay, girl, thanks,\" Hua Jieyu responded.\"See you later.\" After Shu Yuyan left, Hua Jieyu was still smiling. She looked so cute now and mumbled, \"No wonder people said he was a bad boy.\"Then she summoned the wind to carry her and jumped out the window. The way she landed was almost like an angel had descended to the world....Tang Wan was busy after Ye Futian left, because quite a lot of people had asked her about Ye Futian and Yu Sheng. These boys entirely lit up the curiosity of students at this academy.What made it even more awkward for her was that some girls who were attracted to these boys came to her and asked her to invite the boys on dates. She didn't take these jobs because she couldn't just go to the Guqin Garden and tell the boys to go on a date. It would be so embarrassing.\"Tang Wan, someone's looking for you.\" Tang Wan was upset. It was so troublesome to have to answer questions about the boys again and again.\"Could you please just ignore your curiosity?\" Tang Wan complained. However, the person calling her said this time was not only about curiosity.\"Who is it?\" Tang Wan asked.\"Just go and check.\" Tang Wan peeked outside. She saw a gorgeous girl waiting for her quietly outside the door.Tang Wan was suddenly reminded of what Ye Futian had said the day before. She now had a weird feeling that this girl was special.Come on, he wasn't joking?\"Hello, I'm Hua Jieyu,\" she smiled and introduced herself. Tang Wan was absolutely confident in her own beauty. However, she still felt a bit overshadowed when she saw the girl standing outside.\"I'm Tang Wan.\"\"Could you please bring me to the boy?\" Hua Jieyu asked politely. Tang Wan definitely understood who she was talking about. She nodded and said, \"Follow me.\"\"Thanks.\" Hua Jieyu followed Tang Wan. People wondered why these girls were walking together because they didn't know each other before today.\"Do you know that guy?\" Tang Wan was so curious that she finally asked.\"Yep.\" The image of Ye Futian came into Hua Jieyu's mind, and she started smiling again.\"So he wasn't lying to me yesterday,\" Tang Wan mumbled.\"What did he say?\" Hua Jieyu asked her.Tang Wan looked at her for a while and said, \"He told me that you're his girlfriend.\"\"Uh, this guy\u2026\" Hua Jieyu flushed. She was shy.Tang Wan finally realized that Ye Futian made such a scene yesterday only to let Hua Jieyu know that he was already at the academy looking for her.What a sly boy.In fact, she wondered if the students of Donghai Academy knew what had happened here, how many hearts would be totally broken.\"Nope, I do not admit that,\" Hua Jieyu tried to deny. However, her face was so red. How could Tang Wan believe her?When they entered the garden, they ran into Tang Lan.\"Greetings, Professor,\" Tang Wan said.Tang Lan was staring at Hua Jieyu. Naturally, Hua Jieyu reminded her of someone that had meant a lot in her life.\"Greetings, Ms. Tang,\" Hua Jieyu also greeted.\"Girl, you look exactly like her when she was young.\" Tang Lan was amazed. Hua Jieyu knew that she was talking about her mother. She had spoken a lot with Tang Wan on the way here, and she knew who Tang Lan was.Tang Wan also knew that Hua Jieyu was the daughter of Hua Fengliu, whose wife was her rival for the affections of Hua Fengliu. She had doubted whether she should bring Hua Jieyu to this place. She felt as if she had made a mistake.\"Professor, I\u2026\" Tang Wan faltered.\"It's not your fault, girl. Hua Jieyu, go to your father,\" Tang Lan sighed.\"Thanks, Ms. Tang.\" Hua Jieyu walked into the garden with Tang Wan and Tang Lan following her.In front of the door, Hua Fengliu was sunbathing, and Ye Futian was playing the guqin. When they saw Hua Jieyu, Ye Futian stopped playing, and Hua Fengliu started to smile with kindness.\"Dad,\" Hua Jieyu couldn't help crying. Tang Wan had told her that her father was severely injured. The sadness of seeing her father like this entirely drove away the happiness of their reunion.\"Hey, girl, don't cry.\" Hua Jieyu hugged his daughter. However, he had even started crying himself.Ye Futian stood by their side quietly, watching the scene of the reunion.Tang Lan asked Tang Wan, \"How did she know they were here?\"Tang Wan briefly explained what had happened. Tang Lan was surprised by the crazy thing Ye Futian had done. She then turned to Tang Wan and warned her, \"This boy is such a troublemaker. No wonder Hua Fengliu told me to keep an eye on him. Stay away from him, girl.\"\"What are you talking about, Professor?\" Tang Wan was confused.\"Beautiful girls are just dangerous. Both of these girls are gorgeous. Hopefully, this boy will not make the same mistake as his professor did.\" Tang Lan sighed. She believed that Hua Fengliu had fallen into such a situation because of that woman. Now, Hua Jieyu looked exactly like that woman when she was young, but somehow even more beautiful. Tang Lan was afraid that several years later, when she became an adult, Ye Futian would run into troubles because of this beautiful girl, just like his professor had.No matter what, there was such a substantial coincidence between these two generations!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Her eyes were red and bloodshot as she asked, \"Father, what on earth happened after I left? How did things end up like this?\"\"Silly girl, it's all over now. Look, I'm sitting here safe and sound,\" Hua Fengliu consoled her gently.Hua Jieyu stood up and turned to look at Ye Futian. \"What happened?\"\"Fox, it's my fault for not taking good care of Master. After you left, a monster tide washed over the city of Qingzhou. There were people who wanted to kill me, and Master ended up like this because he was trying to protect me,\" said Ye Futian. He still blamed himself for what had happened. Then, he remembered that Xia Fan was right here in Donghai City, and reminded himself that he had to get his revenge.\"It's not Ye Futian's fault. At the time, if he weren't so lucky, he would have been forced to his death on Mount Tianyao. You know I have a bad temper. Obviously I wanted to get revenge for him, but I was useless. I didn't manage to kill the enemy, but instead harmed myself in the process,\" smiled as he spoke. He was seemingly unbothered by it all.\"Is this true?\" Hua Jieyu asked Ye Futian. He nodded lightly.Her tears fell once again. She walked up to Ye Futian with her arms outstretched and pulled him into her arms. Hua Jieyu rested her head on Ye Futian and said, \"Who allowed you to put yourself in danger? What would I do if you had died?Hua Jieyu's voice shook as she cried. The thought of her father being handicapped and Ye Futian almost dying after she had left them made her even more frightened.Ye Futian felt the warmth flood his body as she gently embraced him. He reached out his hands and wrapped them around her as well. He swore to himself to never let her cry like this again.Tang Wan stood not too far away. She shuddered as she witnessed the scene in front of her. It was true. The goddess of Donghai Academy had already given her heart to someone. If the students of Donghai Academy found out, many of them would impulsively want to kill Ye Futian. Tang Wan knew there were quite a few of the \"geniuses\" at school who failed in their attempts to get closer to Hua Jieyu.\"At that time, I didn't get to see you again yet. Of course, I couldn't die! You promised to compensate me,\" Ye Futian said to Hua Jieyu with a gentle voice. She lifted her head at him. She stared for a while then left his embrace. \"I already did.\"\"What?\" Ye Futian blinked in disbelief. \"That was it?\"\"What else were you expecting?\" Hua Jieyu looked at Ye Futian.\"Then, just let me hold you for a little longer,\" Ye Futian requested as he took a step forward. Hua Jieyu stepped away from his advance and replied, \"Don't try to change the subject. Who did this to my father?\"Hua Jieyu knew Ye Futian was trying to cheer her up. He seemed to have a natural ability to do so. She was always happy when he was by her side. During the three months in which they spent every day together, the days went by in endless bickering. However, at the same time, he unknowingly made his way into her heart.\"Can you trust me to handle it? I will get revenge. As for Master's condition, I will most definitely find a way to heal him,\" said Ye Futian. This was something he had to take care of personally. He did not want Hua Jieyu to get involved.\"Hua Jieyu, just let Ye Futian handle it. It's perfect motivation for him,\" Hua Fengliu agreed with what Ye Futian had said.Hua Jieyu looked at both men and said, \"Then, you have to promise me that you'll succeed.\"\"If I don't succeed in this, how would I be able to marry you?\" asked Ye Futian.\"Who says that I will marry you?\" Hua Jieyu blushed as she stared shyly at Ye Futian.\"Can you lovebirds tone it down a little? It would be fine if it was just me, but there are other people here,\" said Hua Fengliu.Hua Jieyu turned around and realized that Tang Lan and Tang Wan were still in the room. Her red cheeks got even redder. Ye Futian, on the other hand, did not seem to mind. \"They'll get used to it,\" he said.\"Master, should we leave?\" whispered Tang Wan. Ye Futian was too shameless.\"He's worse than his master,\" Tang Lan said weakly. Afterward, the two of them left not wanting to disturb the group.\"Father, I want to stay here and take care of you,\" said Hua Jieyu. Sure, she felt better after crying and joking around with Ye Futian but it would be impossible for her to recover from this sadness completely.\"Silly girl, you still have to cultivate. I will be fine here. Ye Futian and Ms. Tang Lan are here to take care of me. After seeing you, I feel so much better already,\" chuckled Hua Fengliu.\"Then I'll stay for today. You can't make me leave,\" said Hua Jieyu.\"Alright, alright. Stay. I know you haven't seen Ye Futian in a while,\" laughed Hua Fengliu.\"I don't want to see him,\" said Hua Jieyu.\"Really now?\" Hua Fengliu looked at his daughter and could only laugh.\"Of course!\" Hua Jieyu nodded.\"How sad,\" sighed Ye Futian, \"And to think that I've been thinking of you every day and turning down advances from different girls. Looks like I'll have to rethink those opportunities now.\"\"You wouldn't dare,\" Hua Jieyu whipped around to glare at Ye Futian.\"Then, did you miss me?\" Ye Futian chuckled at her.\"Father, has he been flirting with other girls?\" she asked her father. Ye Futian blinked.Hua Fengliu wanted to laugh as he glanced at Ye Futian. Ye Futian looked so desperate that Hua Fengliu could only laugh. \"He kept to himself,\" Hua Fengliu answered.Ye Futian let out a sigh of relief.\"Then, yeah. I missed you every now and then,\" whispered Hua Jieyu ever so lightly, but Ye Futian heard her anyway. Seeing the timid expression on Hua Jieyu's face, Ye Futian felt that she was someone worth giving up others for.\"I'm going to go cultivate,\" said Yu Sheng. He could no longer listen to this. He walked towards the bamboo forest behind the building. Did they really have to act all lovey-dovey every time they saw each other?Hua Fengliu and the couple chuckled at Yu Sheng's words. Ye Futian called out to him, \"Yu Sheng! There are so many beautiful girls in Donghai City. If you find someone you like, I wouldn't mind being your wingman.\"\"Father said I can't be in a relationship,\" Yu Sheng said, not even turning his head to answer Ye Futian.\"But your father isn't here, so whatever I say, goes!\" Ye Futian shouted. Yu Sheng had already disappeared around the corner.Only three people remained standing in front of the building. Under the sunlight, the sadness melted away, replaced with warmth.At this moment, an elderly man approached from the outside of the Qin Gardens. The powerful, icy force he gave off seemed to cause the temperature within the Qin Gardens to drop a couple degrees as he stepped inside.A figure appeared and stood in front of the elder. It was Tang Lan. Realizing who was standing in front of her, Tang Lan froze for a moment. Then, with a cold demeanor, she asked, \"What are you doing here?\"\"Our Young Miss has been in there for quite some time now. Who did you guys bring her here to see?\" asked the elder with an equally cold demeanor.\"You were stalking her?\" asked Tang Lan.\"This isn't stalking,\" the elder said. He took a step forward and he was gone, his speed faster than the speed of light\"Presumptuous!\" yelled Tang Lan. The whole Qin Gardens was able to hear her. Hua Fengliu and Ye Futian were alerted by the noise. They looked up and saw two figures descending from the skies, quick and forceful as lightning.\"Hua Fengliu.\" The elder's gaze fell on Hua Fengliu. \"You dare to step foot in the City of Donghai?\"\"Nandou Ku,\" Hua Fengliu looked at the elder.\"You were following me?\" asked Hua Jieyu.\"Young Miss, you are a person of utmost importance. The family would never feel at ease if you were to step out alone. Within Donghai Academy, I would not dare to meddle in your activities. However, as soon as you step off the academy premises, I will be there to protect your safety,\" explained Nandou Ku.\"Nandou Ku, I am now a powerless person. I just wanted to come back to Donghai City for a visit, can't you guys let me be?\" asked Hua Fengliu. Nandou Ku looked puzzled. The Qin Devil was now powerless?\"Since you're already powerless, then I can let you go about your business. The family already gave in and allowed Young Miss to accompany you for three years. However, now that she has made it past the initial process of cultivation and has stepped into the critical period, the family doesn't wish for anyone or anything to distract her,\" said Nandou Ku.\"I'm just going to spend a little time with my father, then head back to Donghai Academy,\" said Hua Jieyu coldly.\"Young Miss, please don't put me in a difficult position. All those years ago, the family already agreed to your stubborn requests. If you keep acting this way, then your father will definitely not be allowed to stay in the City of Donghai,\" said Nandou.\"You guys wouldn't dare!\" Hua Jieyu was furious.\"Hua Jieyu, you should go back,\" Hua Fengliu opened his mouth to speak.\"Father.\" The strong aura around Hua Jieyu dissipated as she turned to speak to her father. Hua Fengliu gave a warm and gentle smile. \"Sweety, I'm fine here. Go back to cultivate at the academy and don't worry about me.\"Hua Jieyu felt terrible. She gave Nandou Ku another cold glare. \"You guys dare to treat my father this way, aren't you afraid that I'll retaliate once I complete my cultivation?\"\"Young Miss, these things were decided by the family. I am not clear on the details. If you can recover the Nandou Family's glory, I'm sure that they will be willing to grant your every wish,\" said Nandou Ku.\"Fine. That day WILL come!\" replied Hua Jieyu. She then turned to Hua Fengliu and said, \"Father, I'm going now.\"\"Go,\" said Hua Fengliu, still smiling.Then, Hua Jieyu looked at Ye Futian. Their eyes met with longing and without a word, Hua Jieyu turned to leave the Qin Gardens.Nandou Ku did not leave with her. After she left, he looked at Hua Fengliu and gave him a warning. \"You are clear that the family was not unwilling to accept you all those years ago but it was you thatcould not become part of the family. But yet, you choose to reach for the stars and caused things to end up like this. You're lucky that Young Miss is extremely gifted. Her gift is a perfect combination of you and her mother. Therefore, the family will not allow anyone to get in the way of her cultivation.\"Hua Fengliu did not spare Nandou Ku a glance. The elder then turned to Ye Futian, who was standing beside Hua Fengliu and asked, \"And who is he?\"\"My disciple, Ye Futian,\" answered Hua Fengliu.\"You brought your disciple with you? Are you setting all your hopes on him?\" Nandou Ku laughed at Hua Fengliu. \"That's some fantasy. You lost to 'him' in the past. I bet now even his disciples are stronger than yours.\"When he was finally done, Nandou Ku turned to leave.Watching his departing figure, Hua Fengliu said, \"One day, you will remember his name.\"\"I look forward to that day.\" Nandou Ku left after his last words, disappearing from the Qin Gardens.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 52": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Legend of FutianCH 52Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayYe Futian kept silent while watching all this happen, but deep inside, he was not as calm as he looked.It took so much effort to meet his fairy again, and she had to leave soon after this reunion. It was understandable that he felt sad.\"You don't like this feeling, do you?\" Hua Fengliu perceived his gloom and asked him.Ye Futian nodded. \"Why shouldn't I be sad?\"\"Then just keep training and grow stronger.\" Hua Fengliu closed his eyes. He was also pissed off because Nandou Ku had told him that his life was hopeless. He could do nothing but put all his hope in Ye Futian.Although, he wasn't desperate, because he knew how talented Ye Futian was. With the inheritance from Emperor Ye Qing, as long as he kept cultivating, people in the City of Donghai and the Nandou family would eventually bow down to his power.Therefore, he was trying to get Ye Futian accepted into Donghai Academy, and it would be even better if one of the higher-ups of the academy picked him as a disciple personally. He needed a safe and promising environment for him to grow in.Ye Futian didn't respond to Hua Fengliu, but he felt hot-blooded. He needed to be strong enough to protect his professor and girlfriend.\u2026The only time Ye Futian went out was to buy inscribing pens and scrolls. Both scroll inscribing and guqin practice served as cultivation for him. They enhanced his mental power and ability in Spiritual Qi perception, which was critical for the development of a mage. As for martial arts techniques, he kept improving on the treasures Emperor Ye Qing had given him. With enough time, his body would be as invincible as the Divine Dragon and the Snow Ape.One day, Tang Wan came to their place.\"I have good news for you guys,\" Tang Wan smiled.\"What is it?\" Ye Futian was curious.\"Someone from the School of the Finance Star told me that you have been admitted,\" Tang Wan said.Ye Futian was confused and didn't believe it.\"I guess some supervisor in that school heard about the fight. I think he must have heard about it from a student. Otherwise, they would have been looking for you guys even sooner,\" Tang Wan elaborated. The talents Ye Futian and Yu Sheng had demonstrated during that fight were obviously more than enough for them to be admitted. Unfortunately, there was no professor or supervisor in the audience.\"Wow, we just benefited from kicking someone's *ss,\" Yu Sheng mumbled. Ye Futian was also smiling. He was so happy that once he was admitted into Donghai Academy, it would be much easier to spend time with Hua Jieyu.\"What are you talking about?\" Hua Fengliu was doubtful about this admission. \"It is uncommon for a school in Donghai Academy to make an exception for applicants. What did they do?\"\"Mr. Hua, you don't know what happened? The first time I brought them to Donghai Academy, they messed with some students from the School of the Flirting Star, because one of them, Mu Yunni, was being rude. These boys totally kicked their *sses. This is how your daughter knew Ye Futian was here and asked me to bring her to you,\" Tang Wan explained. Hua Fengliu finally understood what had happened. The last time Hua Jieyu had come here, they were in such a rush that he didn't have time to ask for the details.Hua Fengliu gave Ye Futian a glance. He was a little bit mad that this boy had not told him about the fight.\"Just go. Remember to take care of yourself,\" Hua Fengliu said.\"Alright, Professor, enjoy your private time with Ms. Tang after we are gone,\" Ye Futian teased him.\"Screw you.\" Hua Fengliu was embarrassed.\"Bye, Professor.\" Ye Futian was still somewhat worried about Hua Fengliu. He was too injured to live alone.\"Don't worry, I'll take care of him.\" Tang Lan came in at this time. She knew that Ye Futian was worried, so she was trying to comfort him.\"Thank you so much,\" Ye Futian said. Now he was settled.The Black Wind Eagle arrived and landed next to them. Ye Futian, Yu Sheng, and Tang Wan got on her back, then she soon took off into the air. Ye Futian waved to Hua Fengliu, apparently reluctant to leave.\"Good luck, boy. Your new journey has just begun.\" Hua Fengliu was smiling.\"Looks like he's almost like a son to you. Why do you believe in him so much?\" Tang Lan was curious.\"Trust me, someday Donghai Academy will be proud of having such a student.\" Hua Fengliu was confident. Tang Lan was surprised and a bit confused. She believed that the confidence Hua Fengliu held for Ye Futian was much stronger than she could have imagined....Within each of the seven schools at Donghai Academy, there were students of various classes for the purpose of diversity. However, there were also specific characteristics for each of them. It was all about the people who were supporting the schools.Students from the School of the Finance Star were known for great martial arts techniques. This was why the supervisor of this school had made an exception to admit Ye Futian and Yu Sheng without a test.According to those who had witnessed the fight, both of them were incredibly talented at martial arts, especially Yu Sheng.The admission of Ye Futian and Yu Sheng didn't quite cause a sensation at Donghai Academy, because only a few students had witnessed the fight, not to mention that most students just knew their names, but had never seen them. Besides, it had been a while since the fight took place.Tang Wan led them to the School of the Finance Star. They were well accommodated and brought around to tour the school. However, the supervisor who accepted them had not arranged a meeting with the boys. It was possible that he still wanted to give them some time to prove themselves first.Students in the School of the Finance Star lived in a separate area that consisted of dorms specifically assigned to them. In fact, the environment seemed to be better than that of Qingzhou Academy.\"Who are you?\" Someone passing by was curious about these new students. They had never met Ye Futian and Yu Sheng before.\"I'm Ye Futian, and this is my best friend, Yu Sheng.\" Ye Futian was smiling.\"Ye Futian. This name sounds familiar,\" the boy mumbled, and soon he remembered who they were. He quickly disappeared, and word started to spread in the School of the Finance Star that the students who kicked the *sses of the students from the School of the Flirting Star had been admitted to this school.The word spread so quickly that suddenly, a lot of people were gathered around them.\"Is this guy Ye Futian? Really, a Two-Star Glory Plane student?\"\"Yu Sheng looks exactly how people said. He's such a big guy. Is he merely a martial arts cultivator, or he is actually hiding some powerful natal spirit?\"\"Wow, they're so cute,\" some girls were also gossiping.The students were curious about everything since they were so young.\"Is there a library at this school?\" Ye Futian asked Tang Wan.Tang Wan shook her head, \"There is only one library at Donghai Academy, and it's located right in the center of the campus. The entry is free to every student, but no checkouts are allowed. You may only browse the books and scrolls inside.\"Ye Futian understood why checkout was prohibited. There were just so many students at this academy that books might be lost once checked out.\"Let's go there,\" Ye Futian said. He had already reached the Two-star Glory Plane, but the spells he could initiate were still mostly basic. It was a huge waste of his talents. He believed that he was not supposed to give up sorcery cultivation even though his martial arts inheritance from Emperor Ye Qing was so powerful. A combination of both would definitely make him stronger.\"Sure,\" Tang Wan nodded. She was surprised that he was not just a pretty boy like he looked and was in fact, quite diligent. The first place he had wanted to go to was the library.The scale of the library at Donghai Academy was much larger than that of the one at Qingzhou Academy. Besides, there was no limit for the students. Any student at this academy would be allowed to browse all the collections in this library. Donghai Academy was very generous about this.When Ye Futian entered the library, he was shocked by the comprehensiveness of the collection. There were books on general subjects like martial arts techniques, swords techniques, elemental spells, and even some very rare books on mental spells.He even found books about music spells, matrices, and scroll inscription. He totally understood why Hua Fengliu had insisted he study at this academy.During the following several days Ye Futian spent all his time making his way through the entire collection.Meanwhile, the news that Ye Futian had been admitted to the School of the Finance Star finally spread all around the academy, including the School of the Flirting Star. They started looking for him everywhere and finally, they found him in the library.Ye Futian was reading books quietly when a group of angry people came up to him. Mu Yunqing spoke to him in rage, \"Long time no see, Ye Futian.\"\"What's up?\" Ye Futian didn't even raise his head.\"Since you're now admitted into this academy, I guess it's time for us to get even about what happened last time.\" Mu Yunqing sounded really mad.\"Are you challenging me?\" Ye Futian looked at him with contempt.However, Mu Yunqing was not planning to fight by himself: \"Someone from the School of the Flirting Star will represent me.\"\"Who is it, and what plane is he in?\" Ye Futian asked. Mu Yunqing realized that other people were looking at him and he faltered.\"Are you still going to fight me together like you did last time?\" Ye Futian was laughing. He was now a student at this academy, so people who fought him had to abide by the rules, which was one on one.Mu Yunqing was extremely embarrassed. He didn't say anything, and the group left crestfallen again.This incident soon spread around the academy. Students started to make fun of Mu Yunqing. They now considered him to be a total coward.Several days later, it was announced that Jing Yang, a student from the School of the Flirting Star, had openly issued a letter of challenge to Ye Futian. It caused a sensation at the academy.He was a Three-star Glory Plane Mandate Sorcerer, a true prodigy. He had been personally admitted directly by the supervisor of the School of the Flirting Star as a disciple. Usually, he didn't care about \"friendly competition,\" but now to save the reputation of his school, he challenged Ye Futian publicly.However, the response from Ye Futian left people totally speechless. \"Sorry, I have no time for this.\"This was such a lame excuse to turn down the challenge. Students in the School of the Flirting Star accused him of being a real coward.Jing Yang, however, was not surprised. He told people that Ye Futian was \"just so-so.\"Ye Futian wasn't disturbed by these comments at all. He still spent all his time on reading and cultivating, as usual.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

So naturally, he did not want to bother with the thought of the challenge. He did not know who Jing Yang was and it did not matter if he was a prodigy. None of this had anything to do with Ye Futian. Defeating Jing Yang would only draw more attention to himself and would have no benefit for him. It might even bring about more problems.The students of the School of the Flirting Star continued to throw insults at Ye Futian, but he paid them no attention. He was not listening to any of their comments. Unbeknownst to him, Ye Futian broke through another plane while he cultivated silently. He was now a three-starred Glory Plane in both martial and divination arts. During his silent cultivation, he was also able to learn a large number of new spells.Ye Futian was attempting a battle tactic which was a combination of martial and divination arts in his dorm. He specialized in the sorcery of different elements, so if he was able to incorporate his powerful martial arts abilities into his sorcery, his combat would be able to reach new levels.Yu Sheng watched him from the side. He said to Ye Futian, \"Of the seven elements, you have cultivated in all of them with corresponding spells\u2014all except for the element of water.\"Although Ye Futian could perceive all elements, he did not have a Water Elemental Life Spirit, so his gift in this element was on the weaker side.\u00a0For the time being, he did not have the ability to cultivate the element of water.Other than that, he was at the highest level of cultivation in all of the other elements. His Natal Spirit was the World Tree, which was Wood Elemental. He had already begun to cultivate in this element even though he knew that there was a chance that the Natal Spirit would never be released in front of others.\"These are all spells chosen by me. There's no harm in learning more.\" Ye Futian smiled and said, \"I have to step out and take care of some things so I might not make it back tonight. Work hard on cultivating and quickly make it to the four-starred Glory Plane.\"\"Okay. I should be getting there,\" nodded Yu Sheng. His journey in cultivation was no easier than that of Ye Futian.Ye Futian mounted the black wind eagle and was out of Donghai Academy....The Luo Palace was a palace in the city of Donghai.It was rumored that the master of the palace, Lord Luo, was a distant relative of the king of the Nandou nation. Other rumors had it that he was in the good graces of the imperial family, and was therefore named a lord.Regardless of the reason, he was the only person in all of the City of Donghai to be given such a title. Naturally, his status was everything but that of the ordinary.The Luo Palace was extremely dignified, and was a true family of power.There was a young man standing in front of the Luo Palace. It was Ye Futian.Outside the doors of the palace, people were busily scurrying around. The building was well-decorated and there was a festive atmosphere in the air. Ye Futian knew that the master of the palace was having a birthday celebration.However, none of that mattered to Ye Futian.The only thing he cared about was Lord Luo. He was the only Arcana Plane healing sorcerer of the Spirit element in all of Donghai City. He was the person that Tang Lan had refused to tell him about.Investigating this was the only thing Ye Futian did outside of cultivation. He was always thinking about Hua Fengliu's injuries.Ye Futian did not understand why Tang Lan had been so sure Lord Luo would refuse to help. He was not completely confident that he could get Lord Luo to agree to help heal Hua Fengliu, but he knew that he couldn't just sit around and do nothing. He found out that Lord Luo lived an isolated life and cared a lot about his reputation. Every year on his birthday he would hold an extravagant celebration. Ye Futian wanted to find out exactly what kind of person he was, and see if there was a chance to persuade him to help Hua Fengliu.Ye Futian owed this to Hua Fengliu. This was also what he had promised Hua Jieyu. It did not matter if he succeeded; he had to give it all he had.The steward noticed Ye Futian. A handsome young man, he thought. With a smile, he asked, \"Is there something I can help you with, Young Master?\"\"May I ask if there will be dancing and music entertainment at Lord Luo's birthday celebration? I specialize in performing the guqin. If possible, I would like to play for Lord Luo at his birthday celebration,\" said Ye Futian.The steward smiled and replied, \"The palace does not lack a guqin player.\"\"I am sure that I am more capable than your present personnel,\" Ye Futian continued, \"If it's really not possible, then are you guys lacking in the errand boy department?\"The steward looked at Ye Futian confused. The young man had an aura of elegance, and was obviously not an errand boy.\"Young Master, why are you so adamant on entering the palace?\" asked the steward. His eyes squinted with suspicion. The steward was a clever man.\"I just want to witness the extravagance for myself,\" Ye Futian said calmly, keeping his composure.\"The palace has no shortage of guqin players or errand boys,\" the steward said, rejecting Ye Futian. Although one teenager couldn't do much harm, he could not simply grant him access to the palace.\"Hey!\" At that moment, someone from behind them called out in surprise. Ye Futian turned around and was met with two beautiful girls. The girl walking in front was especially beautiful.Ye Futian had met both of these girls aboard the ship on his way to the city of Donghai.\"It's you?\" the girl in front asked in surprise. She had thought that they were passing strangers, never to meet again. She would never have expected to run into him again much less at a place like this.\"Young Miss Lin Xiyue, is he a friend of yours?\" asked the steward. Could the young man have come for the Young Miss? It couldn't be. She arrived only yesterday as a guest of the palace.\"Yes,\" Lin Xiyue nodded. She smiled at Ye Futian. \"What are you doing here?\"\"The Young Master says he is a guqin player and wants to perform during Lord Luo's celebration,\" said the steward. Since he was a friend of Lin Xiyue, there was no way he could say that Ye Futian came to be an errand boy.\"Yeah,\" Ye Futian agreed.\"Why don't we give him a chance?\" Lin Xiyue asked the steward. The steward smiled helplessly but nodded anyway. \"Since Young Miss has spoken, then I guess we can give him a chance. Young Master, this way please.\"The group walked into the palace. Lin Xiyue and Xiao He were on either side of Ye Futian. Lin Xiyue asked, \"Didn't you say you were coming to Donghai City to attend school? Why do you want to be a guqin player at the palace?\"\"That's right! I'm attending Donghai Academy now. I just wanted to come explore the palace and see what it's like,\" replied Ye Futian with a smile.\"You're lying!\" Xiao He snickered, \"When you arrived in Donghai City, the Spring Quarter Exams were already over, how could you have gotten into the academy already. Are you making things up to attract Lin Xiyue's attention?\"\"Stop with the nonsense, Xiao He,\" said Lin Xiyue while trying to suppress a smile. While this was going on, they failed to notice Ye Futian shrugging his shoulders in defeat. He felt helpless. Every time he told the truth, nobody was willing to believe him.\"Oh right. What are you doing here? Do you live in the Luo Palace?\" Ye Futian asked curiously.Lin Xiyue shook her head. \"The elders of my family know Lord Luo, so the younger generation of the family is also familiar with him. I came this time to visit him. I can introduce some people to you!\"\"I see,\" Ye Futian nodded slightly. It looked like Lin Xiyue was the young miss of a noble family. It was no wonder that her every gesture and way of speech flowed with such elegance.\"What kind of person is Lord Luo?\" Ye Futian asked her in a low voice. Tang Lan had said that it was impossible for Lord Luo to agree to help. If it was simply because of his proud and aloof personality, then it was not a problem; but if it was because Lord Luo and Hua Fengliu had some sort of rivalry going on, then maybe it really was impossible to persuade him to help.\"Stern, but kind. It really depends on the situation,\" smiled Lin Xiyue.The group arrived in the garden area. There was a person playing on the guqin, as well as dancers. They seemed to be rehearsing for tonight's performance. It was obvious that they would not want to make any mistakes at Lord Luo's birthday celebration. It was best to prepare beforehand.The steward went to whisper to the guqin player, then turned to Ye Futian. \"Would you like to give it a go?\"\"Sure,\" nodded Ye Futian. The guqin player got up and gave his seat to Ye Futian. When Ye Futian's fingers finally met with the chords of the guqin, the aura around him shifted. It was now quiet and peaceful. A touch of elegance added on to his already outstanding looks.His long fingers flew over the chords, strumming them as he moved. The sound of the guqin played and the original guqin player's expression darkened. The music played softly, and everyone was being drawn in.\"That's enough. I admit defeat,\" the guqin player smiled bitterly and shook his head. Being able to create a certain mood was an important part of playing the instrument. Even though Ye Futian was young, he was able to play as if he had years of experience. Ye Futian played at a level that he could not reach. However, the guqin player had no idea that Ye Futian was a Musical Sorcerer, and was able to surpass ordinary guqin players like himself even without musical spells.\"If it's like this, then Young Master, you should stay here today and learn the pieces you need to play tomorrow. How does that sound?\" asked the steward.\"Alright. Thank you!\" Ye Futian smiled.\"Lin Xiyue, what are you doing here?\" At that moment, a group of youths approached from afar.\"We were just looking for you. What brings you here to observe the rehearsal?\" asked one of the youths in the group.The group Ye Futian was standing in all turned their heads towards the voices. All of them had a magnificent aura around them. They must all either be from prominent families or the Luo Palace.\"My friend is playing the guqin here, so I came to check it out,\" explained Lin Xiyue.\"Your friend?\" one of them looked at Ye Futian.\"Yeah, he's a guqin player. He wants to play at tomorrow's birthday celebration,\" nodded Lin Xiyue.\"Oh, I see,\" one of the youths lost interest as soon as he heard 'guqin player.' He continued, \"Lin Xiyue, let's go. Someone is coming.\"\"Okay,\" nodded Lin Xiyue. She turned to give Ye Futian a quick wave goodbye. Ye Futian returned the gesture with a smile.\"Who is it?\" Lin Xiyue asked the group of youths as they walked away from Ye Futian.\"Zhou Mu,\" replied one of them. Lin Xiyue's eyes lit up. She heard that Zhou Mu was already a five-starred Glory Plane conjurer. He was highly gifted just as his master had been years ago.\"Oh right, Lin Xiyue. How did you end up making friends with a guqin player?\" asked a young woman in the group.\"We met once by chance,\" she answered.\"Is it because of his good looks?\" teased the young woman.Lin Xiyue smiled but did not reply. Ye Futian was handsome, even more so when he was playing his instrument but it was unfortunate that he was a mere guqin player. In addition, he seemed to be boastful and a liar, but Lin Xiyue thought that it might be because he was too prideful.Lin Xiyue did not invite Ye Futian to join the group nor did she introduce him to them. Ye Futian knew that a 'guqin player' like himself did not belong in a group with the nobles. However, they had only been strangers to begin with, so Ye Futian really did not mind. Besides, he had not entered the palace to get to know that group of youths anyway.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 54": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Legend of FutianCH 54Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAll the music and dances for the birthday banquet of Lord Luo had been settled, and the musician left after he had taught Ye Futian the songs he was assigned to play. The steward also repeatedly told him some dos and don'ts for the next day.Ye Futian was left in the palace to rehearse with a group of girls. Their figures and facial features were all top-notch, especially the leader. She was about eighteen-years-old, extraordinarily sexy, but with a face full of the youthfulness of a younger girl. When she was dancing in that dress made of chiffon, it was possible for any man to fall in love with her.Ye Futian kept his head low while playing the song. A sweet and charming voice suddenly spoke. \"Why don't you raise your head?\"A gorgeous face soon appeared in front of him. He smiled and replied, \"You are so charming that once I see you, I feel distracted.\"\"You do know how to compliment girls,\" she chuckled. Her skirt swung onto the guqin.\"Just come and join us.\" She started dancing again and seemed to be luring him intentionally. Most of the musicians were just old men, so she was surprised that the assigned musician this time was such a young and pretty boy.\"Sorry Miss, I have a girlfriend,\" Ye Futian smiled at her. The girl was dumbfounded for a moment, then started chuckling again along with the girls around her.\"What are you talking about? Remember, my name is Yun Rou, and in the future, I will marry a very powerful cultivator. You are too young to pique my interest,\" Yun Rou made fun of him.\"Nice to meet you. I'm Ye Futian,\" he replied, and then the rehearsal continued. They told Ye Futian that tomorrow, at the birthday banquet of Lord Luo, there would be many influential people of the City of Donghai attending.However, these girls didn't have any further information. In this continent, the talents of cultivation determined everything. Even a gorgeous girl who was born to a mundane family could not gain much advantage from her beauty. She might marry a powerful cultivator, but most likely, she'd end up a concubine rather than a wife. Even worse, since powerful cultivators tended to look for younger women, affairs would become an inevitable fate on the man's side of the marriage as time went by....The next day, the Luo Palace became boisterous in the morning. A lot of servants were busy preparing for the banquet and hosting the visitors.The rehearsals kept going. After lunch, there started to be more and more visitors crowding into the banquet room.Ye Futian and the girls were already in place.The banquet was opulent. The center spot was reserved for Lord Luo, the guest of honor, as he was the one being celebrated. Then, there were seats arranged in rows on both sides of Lord Luo's spot. Apparently, the people who were seated closer to Lord Luo were of higher status in this city.There was a broad space between these two rows, and behind the seats, there was a stage with a golden carpet. That was where Ye Futian and the girls were to perform. It was designed to liven up the banquet without distracting the guests.Before the guests were seated, the show had already started. The whole room was filled with laughter. Lin Xiyue and Xiao He were among the first group of people entering the room. While they were getting ushered into their seats, Lin Xiyue noticed Ye Futian and smiled at him.\"Such a pity that you're rarely attracted to a boy, and the one you pick is only a musician,\" Xiao He joked. Lin Xiyue gave her a stare. \"Stop that.\"A pretty handsome boy came to them and asked with a smile, \"What are you talking about?\"\"Nothing, Mr. Luo,\" Lin Xiyue shook her head.\"Xiyue, people told me that you brought that musician to this place. Is he your friend?\" the boy asked.\"We've met twice. He told me that he wanted to come here and broaden his horizons, so I did him a favor. You're fine with that, aren't you?\" Lin Xiyue answered.\"It's okay. In fact, if he wants, to, he can stay here as long as he wants.\" The boy was still laughing.\"Okay, I'll ask him after the banquet is over,\" Lin Xiyue said.\"Sure. See you later.\" The boy left. Xiao He whispered to Xiyue: \"Young Lord Luo seemed to be attracted to you, girl.\"\"I already told you to stop.\" Lin Xiyue felt awkward.\"I'm serious. I know he doesn't look as cute as Ye Futian, but what about his status?\" Xiao He didn't want to stop. Lin Xiyue gave up; she knew that this girl liked to joke.Young girls had all kinds of fantasies. Apparently, Ye Futian did not understand what they were thinking at all.Suddenly, someone entered the room, walking with majestic steps. He was apparently of high status in this place. People stopped chatting and greeted him, \"Happy birthday, Lord Luo.\"Ye Futian also raised his head and looked at Lord Luo. He had an absolutely commanding and dignified appearance.\"Long time no see, Lord Luo. You actually look younger than the last time we met,\" someone walked up to him and said.\"Lord Luo, happy birthday from the Lin Family.\"People started to queue up to send birthday congratulations.\"Lord Luo, happy birthday from the Xia Family,\" a bright and clear voice sounded.\"I appreciate it, Lord Xia,\" Lord Luo replied with a smile. The title of Lord Luo was merely conferred without substantial authority. In fact, Xia Feng, the head of the Xia family, was the most powerful man in this city. Still, there were some other people almost equally dignified in this city, such as the head of the Nandou Family, the supervisors of schools at Donghai Academy, and a few others.Behind Xia Feng, there was a young man who bowed slightly to Lord Luo. \"Greetings, Lord Luo. I'm Xia Fan.\"\"Mr. Xia Fan, you have grown up!\" Lord Luo complimented.\"Don't praise him, Lord Luo. He's been dawdling all the time. With your compliment, I'm afraid it's going to be worse,\" Xia Feng joked.Coincidently, Ye Futian raised his head at this moment, and soon noticed Xia Fan. The moment he saw Xia Fan, he gave him an icy glare.After Xia Feng and Xia Fan were seated, Xia Fan started enjoying the show. When he saw Yun Rou, he felt very attracted to this beautiful girl. However, soon he noticed that Ye Futian was sitting behind her, playing. He frowned and felt very confused.How could Ye Futian be here?How had he survived after jumping into the canyon? Had the ferocious Snow Ape just let him go?Ye Futian was also looking at Xia Fan. They stared at each other, and Ye Futian perceived the contempt in Xia Fan's eyes. Xia Fan had believed Ye Futian was just a nobody, someone that Xia Fan did not care was alive or dead.Xia Fan was the young Lord of Donghai Province. He could entirely ignore Ye Futian due to their vast gap in status. He knew that Hua Fengliu, the only patron of Ye Futian, was now crippled. The only thing he felt frustrated about was that his uncle had died at the hands of the Snow Ape in that fight.\"Who are you looking at?\" Xia Feng asked.\"Nothing. I just saw someone interesting,\" Xia Fan responded. It was extremely interesting that the disciple of the Guqin Devil was now serving in this room as a musician.Ye Futian became peaceful and kept playing. He wasn't worried about running into Xia Fan at this place. He was already a student of Donghai Academy, so no one would be allowed to try to kill him this time, no matter how powerful they were.\"Happy birthday from the Nandou family,\" another congratulation came. Lord Luo looked at the person approaching and started laughing. \"Long time no see, Mr. Nandou.\"There were two men from the Nandou family. One was middle-aged, and one was young. They were Nandou Wenshan and his son, Nandou Kai. They had come here on behalf of the Nandou family. Since they were the leaders of the Nandou family, attending this banquet represented the respect they held for Lord Luo.\"Long time no see, Lord Luo,\" Nandou Wenshan replied. Lord Luo ushered these two into the seats closest to himself.\"So, Wenshan, you do come here,\" another voice said, and Nandou Wenshan stood up from his seat to greet the new group of people that had just entered the room.\"Why did you come here together?\" Nandou Wenshan laughed.\"We met each other on the way here.\" One of them had a complexion as clear as jade. He was casually dressed for this banquet, but it was obvious that he was not someone common. The other one was an old man, but still in good shape. He laughed at Lord Luo and greeted him. \"I am here on behalf of Donghai Academy.\"\"Thanks so much,\" Lord Luo replied with his body slightly bowed down. He then ushered these two men into their seats, also the ones closest to him.This group of people was now having a conversation. They were among the most influential people in the city.\"Mr. Art Saint has been friends with Lord Luo for a long time. He's attended his birthday banquet every year.\"\"It's said that Mr. Art Saint has reached a higher plane than he was in last year. The person who is with him actually runs the School of the Emperor Star at Donghai Academy.\"\"I believe the young man behind him must be Zhou Mu. He is already a Five-star Glory Plane invoker, a true genius. People say that Art Saint is trying to form a political marriage between Zhou Mu and the daughter of the Nandou Family.\"\"I think Art Saint is trying to make up for his mistakes of the past. I'm afraid that this job is not going to be easy. The princess of the Nandou family is supremely gorgeous, talented, and so treasured by the Nandou family that they don't want to trade her for political interest,\" people were whispering to each other.They lowered their voices to avoid being heard, but Ye Futian still learned a lot of information from all the talk. He looked at the middle-aged man with the bright complexion and realized that this man was Art Saint, who had destroyed Hua Fengliu's natal spirit.He soon understood why Tang Lan had told him it would be impossible to ask for help from Lord Luo. Lord Luo was long-time friends with Hua Fengliu's nemesis.He felt upset, as it seemed that his attempt to get help was all in vain.However, he had obtained a lot of information about the political situation in the City of Donghai.He was still curious about the relationship between Hua Jieyu and the representative of the Nandou family.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 55": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Legend of FutianCH 55Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayUpon the arrival of the guests, the celebration began. Drinks were exchanged and the sound of laughter and conversation filled the air. The older party-goers formed their own small circle while the younger party-goers did the same. Other than presenting their gifts and exchanging words of common courtesy, everyone was discussing interesting new happenings within the City of Donghai. Somewhere along the line someone brought up the topic of Qingzhou City.\"I heard that the historical remains of 'that person' were discovered in the City of Qingzhou, and that you even went to investigate personally. Is that true, Xia Fan?\" someone asked with their sight set on Xia Fan.By 'that person' they obviously meant Emperor Ye Qing but because he was a taboo character in the Divine Prefectures of the East Sea, it would be inappropriate to use his name in a public place such as this.\"It is true indeed. However, a demon king, or perhaps even higher leveled Snow Ape demon stood guard there and we were unable to enter. My younger brother even lost his life at the hands of that monster,\" said Xia Feng.\"What Chief Xia Feng said is true. I wanted to take part in it like every else and traveled to Qingzhou City. Indeed, no one was able to get close to the historical site. I heard that the path was blocked by demons and monsters,\" said Lin Xiyue's father. Many people nodded in agreement. Many powerful individuals have sent their people to Qingzhou, but they all returned with no results.\"If really was a demon of higher level than a demon king, then forget about us. Probably even the Nandou Nation wouldn't be able to do anything about it,\" someone sighed.Hearing their words, Ye Futian felt a twinge of sadness. If the Snow Ape had not refused to leave the mountains, then Ye Futian would not have to beware of his every move in Donghai City. He would have been able to do whatever he pleased, even in the Nandou Nation. Ye Futian debated whether or not he should find time to head back to Mount Tianyao to persuade the Snow Ape to leave with him.\"Brother Lin, your daughter, Lin Xiyue should be about 16-years-old now, right? She's getting more beautiful by the day,\" said Lord Luo. His eyes drifted to Lin Xiyue in the crowd. Her beautiful eyes contained a hint of timidness.\"Thank you for your compliment, Lord Luo,\" said Lin Xiyue's father.\"Has she been betrothed?\" asked Lord Luo.\"Not yet, but she is still young. She is still focusing all her attention on cultivation. There's no hurry,\" answered her father.\"That is true, but looking around this venue, there are many worthy young men. It couldn't hurt to meet them,\" chuckled Lord Luo.\"Speaking of worthy young men, I heard that the Art Saint's disciple, Zhou Mu, is already in the five-starred Glory Plane,\" Lin Xiyue's father said. He looked over at Zhou Mu, who stood behind the Art Saint.\"It's all thanks to Master's guidance.\" Zhou Mu smiled lightly in response.\"Nandou Kai beside Nandou Wenshan does not pale in comparison to Zhou Mu,\" the Art Saint said modestly as he looked at Nandou Wenshan.\"Nandou Kai is slightly older and his gift is not half bad, but in comparison with Zhou Mu, he is still lacking. He will need to work harder,\" said Nandou Wenshan.\"How is she doing?\" the Art Saint asked suddenly. Nandou Wenshan was stunned, but then shook his head with a bitter smile and said, \"My younger sister is still the same.\"\"I heard that her daughter is back and is an exceptional person. Zhou Mu keeps pestering me to let them meet,\" the Art Saint continued to speak.\u00a0Everyone exchanged a look. Indeed, the Art Saint was trying to set up his disciple with the young miss of the Nandou family. Shockingly, he did not seem to care that she was the Guqin Devil's daughter. It was probably a \"love someone and love everything about them\" type of situation. After all, the Art Saint had always been madly in love with 'that' person.\"It is true, Hua Jieyu is exceptional. She is now practising cultivation at the School of the Emperor Star within Donghai Academy.\" Nandou Wenshan smiled.Upon hearing this exchange, his heart was no longer calm. The Art Saint wanted to set up his disciple with Hua Jieyu? In addition, it seemed that Nandou Wenshan was the older brother of Master's wife, which would make him Hua Jieyu's uncle.\"Hua Jieyu's gifts are top-notch within the Emperor Star school. It would be hard to find a person who could compare with her in all of Donghai Academy,\" said an elder of the School of the Emperor Star. Since Hua Jieyu was a student of his school, he knew quite a bit about her.\"You guys are all complimenting her. It makes me want to meet the young miss of the Nandou family.\" Lord Luo laughed.\"Hua Jieyu?\" Xia Fan's lips twitched into a wicked smile. His eyes landed on Ye Futian, who was playing the guqin. In the City of Qingzhou, he had seen Hua Jieyu and Ye Futian together by the lake. The relationship between the two did not seem like that of ordinary friends. Xia Fan wondered, what would happen if the Nandou family found out the ambiguous relationship between Hua Jieyu and Ye Futian?Just the thought of this brought a smile to Xia Fan's face. Of course, there were other ways to crush Ye Futian. He did not have to do it this way. If he were to expose their relationship in a setting like this, he might offend the Nandou family. After all, they were a big, powerful family, and cared a lot about their reputation. Hua Jieyu was also the apple of their eyes. They would not permit anyone to try to drag her through the mud.Ye Futian felt that something was amiss and lifted his head to look at Xia Fan. Right now, everyone was talking about Hua Jieyu, so Ye Futian knew immediately what Xia Fan might have been thinking. He could not help but raise his eyebrows at Xia Fan. As a person, Xia Fan was sinister and treacherous, a truly despicable person. Ye Futian had gotten a taste of this back in the City of Qingzhou.\"When the chance comes, I shall have Hua Jieyu come to pay respect to you, Lord Luo.\" Nandou Wenshan smiled at Lord Luo's words. \"You should stop talking about Hua Jieyu now. Since we have so many talented young people gathered here today, and since Lord Luo is in such a good mood, why don't we have the youngster perform?\"\"That's right! This would be the perfect opportunity to catch a glimpse at all the young talent in the City of Donghai,\" someone chimed in.This piqued Lord Luo's interest as well. Thus, he went on to say, \"Then, let's have any youngsters willing to perform show off their skills in front of us elders. There shall be hefty rewards for the best performances.\"\"Lin Xiyue, how about you go first?\" Lord Luo set his sight on Lin Xiyue.She blinked a couple times then nodded with a smile. With light steps, she carried herself to the middle of the crowd. \"Lord Luo, I hope you will enjoy my lacking performance.\" After she spoke, Water Spiritual Qi began to gather around her. Her hands danced in the air, carrying the Spiritual Qi with her every movement. Slowly, the character for 'longevity' formed in midair and floated towards Lord Luo. It only disappeared once it had reached him.\"Lin Xiyue, you're already a three-starred Glory Plane sorcerer! How fast. That was very interesting,\" complimented Lord Luo.\"Thank you for your compliments,\" said Lin Xiyue. She bowed to him and retreated into the crowd.A young man stepped up. \"I will perform a sword dance for you, Lord Luo.\" He drew out the sword he carried on his person, and it began to dance through the air. With every slash of the sword a stroke was left in the air. When the young man finished his performance, five words were left in midair: May you achieve boundless eternity.\"\"Nice!\" Many people applauded him. Following that, other youths continued to put on their performances to present their blessings and best wishes to Lord Luo. At the same time, they were able to put their talents on display. Their performances brightened up the atmosphere of the party venue.\"Brother Hua, does your disciple not wish to perform?\" someone asked the Art Saint. The Art Saint's surname was Hua, a different Hua from Hua Fengliu.\"Go,\" commanded the Art Saint.\"Yes, Master,\" answered Zhou Mu. Stepping up, he held a pencil in his hand. Then, he laid out a large piece of paper on the bright golden yellow carpet. Zhou Mu bent down and began to draw.\"It's rare to see Zhou Mu in action. We are all so lucky to be able to witness the Art Saint's disciple in action,\" said one of the youths in the crowd. All the youngsters at the venue admired Zhou Mu.\"I've never seen a conjurer in action before, so I don't know what it's like,\" said a young girl. Her eyes glowed in interest as she observed Zhou Mu.Zhou Mu drew with great speed. His movements were natural and graceful. Lord Luo complimented, \"Brother Hua, your disciple has such a grand aura for a person of his age.\"\"That's true,\" everyone else agreed. Even Yun Rou and her group of dancers tried to look on as they danced. Ye Futian was also aware of all the happenings, despite playing with his head down.He was thinking to himself. Hua Fengliu and the Art Saint were old rivals, not only in power, but also in love. To be able to take Mistress away from someone like the Art Saint, Ye Futian could only imagine how charming Hua Fengliu must have been in the past. If Hua Fengliu did not have his powers disabled, then he probably could have been like admired and respected like the Art Saint. To have ended up in his situation, Ye Futian felt really bad for Hua Fengliu.Zhou Mu drew as Ye Futian played the guqin. One was the disciple of the Art Saint, one was the disciple of the Guqin Devil. However, everyone's focus was on Zhou Mu. Finally, Zhou Mu's work was complete. A Fire Phoenix escaped from the artwork and circled the skies above. Covered in the flames, it let out a screech. Then, it landed by Lord Luo's side and began to dance for him.\"Bravo!\"\"Wonderful!\"\"The phoenix is a symbol of success. What a wonderful omen. We wouldn't have expected anything less of the Young Art Saint.\" Everyone was full of praise for Zhou Mu. Even Lord Luo gave him a look and smile of approval. He said, \"You shall be rewarded,\"\"Thank you, my lord,\" Zhou Mu bowed and then returned to his spot by his master.\"Watching Zhou Mu, I was reminded of a person. A couple days ago, Nandou Ku paid a visit to the Guqin Gardens and saw Hua Fengliu,\" said Nandou Wenshan. In a split second, he had captured everyone's attention. The Guqin Devil was back in the City of Donghai?\"However, he's handicapped now and is being protected by Tang Lan. He even took in a disciple,\" Nandou Wenshan elaborated.\"Handicapped?\" Everyone was shocked.Even the Art Saint was surprised. \"What a shame.\"\"Why is it a shame? Even if he weren't handicapped, he wouldn't dare show his face in front of you, Art Saint.\" Someone laughed.\"That's right! In the past, Hua Fengliu had no understanding of his own capabilities and brought the humiliation on to himself. Who would've thought he would still have the nerve to come back after becoming disabled? Would he even be able to groom the disciple he took in? If his disciple met with Zhou Mu, he would probably have to walk in the other direction,\" another person mocked Hua Fengliu.\"He can only live under someone else's protection now. Why is he even thinking about anything else?\" People began to speak up against Hua Fengliu. All their words were meant to suck up to the Art Saint.Xia Fan watched Ye Futian. He could not wait to see how long it would take for Ye Futian to explode in anger.Just as everyone was enjoying their time making fun of Hua Fengliu, they were interrupted by the sounds of the guqin. The style has shifted. The once soft notes were getting louder and faster as well. Slowly, Yun Rou and the other dancers became influenced by the music. The women began to dance their hearts away, their long dresses flowed with their movements. They all looked like goddesses.Under the influence of the music, the youngsters got more excited and the elders were in an even better mood now. The atmosphere of the entire party venue was pushed to the highest point.\"What piece is this?\" asked the Art Saint. His eyes drifted toward Ye Futian. Not only him, but the other high authority figures as well felt something amiss. Their emotions were being controlled by the music.The youths at the party were getting agitated and the dancers on stage looked like they were unable to pull themselves away from the music.Behind the stage, a young man was playing his instrument silently. He seemed to be in a world of his own. His looks could be said to be one of the best amongst the younger party-goers. When he played, he released a mystical force that was incorporated into his music.\"The Melody of the White Feathers Garment. Who are you?\" The Art Saint's gaze sharpened and his utterance interrupted the music. Many people began to wake up from their previous trance. The all stared at the young guqin player in shock.They watched as the young man lifted his head slowly. His eyes were clear and clean with no sense of lowliness. Looking towards Lord Luo, he spoke. \"I am the Guqin Devil's disciple, Ye Futian. I am here to convey blessings in place of my Master with a single piece. The Melody of the White Feathers Garment.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 56": "Chapter 56: Please, Bring It onTranslator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo StudioThe boy was not talking loudly, but his voice was still rather firm. Suddenly, the banquet was silenced.\"Ye Futian, disciple of the Qin Devil, hereby delivers happy birthday to Lord Luo with White Feather Garments, on behalf of my master.\"People were surprised that this young musician was the disciple of the Qin Devil. The White Feather Garments had totally taken over their mind, which indicated that there was strong mental power contained in that music spell.The power was especially demonstrated by the young men and women who started dancing along. If not for the interruption from the Art Saint, they would still be possessed by the mental power in that song.Yun Rou now looked at Ye Futian with absolute surprise. This seemingly careless boy was actually quite powerful. The song he just played, the Melody of White Feather Garments, was one of the most renowned royal waltzes. It was said that if this song was played by a powerful sorcerer that specialized in music spells, people listening to it would soon be trapped into a world of illusion.Lin Xiyue and Xiao He were also looking at him. They felt shocked that this \"ordinary\" young musician was in fact the disciple of the famous Qin Devil.So, was he a musical sorcerer?\"Ye Futian, where did I hear this name before\u2026\" Some students of Donghai Academy were mumbling, because this name rang a bell for them. Soon, they realized who he was, and wondered if this boy was the same person who recently became famous in Donghai Academy.Art Saint and Lord Luo were both staring at Ye Futian, feeling confused. They never anticipated that the disciple of the Qin Devil would show up in this banquet as the musician. If Nandou Wenshan had not mentioned the Qin Devil, or people had not satirized him, this boy would still be playing peacefully.Nandou Wenshan heard from Nandou Ku that the Qin Devil had high expectations for this disciple. He realized the reason. According to the vibe of this boy, he was almost the younger version of Qin Devil.Now, silence haunted the place. It was just too dramatic for the disciple of the Qin Devil to show up in this situation.Xia Fan was sneering at Ye Futian. He did not believe that Ye Futian actually dared to announce his identity under these circumstances.Meanwhile, Ye Futian stood up, and bowed slightly to the person running the School of Emperor Star in Donghai Academy. \"Greetings, Professor, from Ye Futian, the School of Finance Star.\"\"You are a student of that school?\" The supervisor was surprised about the fact that the disciple of the Qin Devil was currently studying at the School of Finance Star. Obviously, he did not pay much attention to this boy, who had recently become rather famous in Donghai Academy.\"I was admitted recently.\" Ye Futian took out the name tag from his pocket. The supervisor from the School of Emperor Star nodded slightly, without saying anything.At that moment, Xia Fan's face turned very pale. He could not believe that Ye Futian had been admitted to Donghai Academy.With his identity as a Donghai Academy student, and that this was a public birthday banquet, it would be difficult to do anything to him. Even though the supervisor from the School of Emperor Star seemed not to like Ye Futian, as long as he was a student in Donghai Academy, people could hardly be harsh to him.Lin Xiyue was looking at Ye Futian, totally distracted. She remembered that Ye Futian used to tell her that he was studying at Donghai Academy. At that time, she believed that he was bragging, but it seemed that he was actually telling the truth.In fact, she should not be blamed. She met Ye Futian on a ship to this city, and at that time, the Spring Term Entry Test had ended. That was why she and Xiao He both believed Ye Futian was bragging.So, there remained only one possibility for Ye Futian to enter Donghai Academy\u2014Ye Futian was well appreciated by someone running the School of Finance Star, so a rare exception was made for him. She totally realized what it meant. Ye Futian was possibly much more talented than other students in Donghai Academy.Other people were also confused about this admission. Donghai Academy was the best school in this province, and Ye Futian was given an exception soon after he arrived. Zhou Mu, the disciple of Art Saint, was well-known for his extraordinary talents. However, now, the disciple of the Qin Devil stepped out, and shocked the whole audience with White Feather Garments, which indicated that he was also unusual. Things were getting interesting.\"That's a good song. How's your master doing?\" Lord Luo asked him, his voice monotone. Ye Futian played that song as a birthday gift, so he must not lose his politeness in this situation.\"My professor was set up by a villain, and has been crippled for a while. Now he is peacefully living in his own garden, unbothered by the mess happening outside.\" Ye Futian sounded peaceful. However, Xia Fan felt mad. He had just been referred to as a \"villain\".People looked at him. This youth said only what was necessary. He told them that Qin Devil was now living on his own, crippled, and did not care about that what was going on outside. This speech successfully prevented further trouble for his professor.\"Today, I was going to play the song peacefully to entertain the guests here, and did not intend to interrupt the fun going on. However, so many people started to insult Mr. Hua Fengliu.\" He glanced at the audience and kept talking, \"I am not a great student, but still, I have dignity, so does my professor. I cannot act like nothing is going on when people are insulting my professor. I know there are a lot of talented young men in this place who have some negative impressions of him. I will accept any challenge if you believe I am not being appropriate.\"He paused for a second, then stared at those who insulted Hua Fengliu. \"Please, bring it on.\"He was only 16-years-old, and now there were so many big chiefs of this city sitting in the room. However, the way he talked was neither humble nor pushy. Every word from his mouth was firm and solid.The talented young men were showing off their achievements and complimenting each other. However, suddenly, someone who had been silent announced that he would challenge any one of them. How dramatic was this?The Qin Devil definitely deserved a disciple with such guts.People did not know what to say. The girls who used to talk with him felt that, in the past, they did not know him at all. The true self he hid was so different.Those who insulted the Qin Devil now looked embarrassed. This boy was acting polite, yet had a firm will. They were totally overshadowed by his personality, not to mention being challenged.\"What plane are you on, boy?\" Lord Luo asked to err on the side of caution. If he was too powerful, it would be better for the people challenged to just ignore him rather than having their *ss kicked.\"Three-star Glory Plane it is,\" Ye Futian replied peacefully. Lord Luo did not say anything, but started looking at the young men in this room. Three-star Glory Plane was impressive for a boy his age, but not too rare for other young men attending the banquet.\"I accept your challenge.\" Someone stood up from his seat. It was the swordsman who responded. He was in the same plane as Ye Futian, a Three-star Glory Plane Swordsman.\"Okay, just show us your best. You don't have to worry about damaging this place at all,\" Lord Luo told them. There were so many powerful people in this place that the audience would be well protected from the fight.\"Understood.\" The swordsman unsheathed his weapon, and stepped toward Ye Futian.Ye Futian went back to his guqin, and slowly sat down. The girls already evacuated the place for him.Since someone was insulting the Qin Devil, he should absolutely defeat those people with the techniques he inherited from Hua Fengliu, which were the music spells.He started playing, and suddenly the room was full of a feeling of desolation. Some of the people soon felt as if they were brought to a state of illusion, where they were left alone in a deep woods in a mountain.\"That is a music spell.\" Some powerful people soon recognized what it was. The Rainbow and Feather Garments he played were not injected with much mental power, so the effect was not truly strong. But since Ye Futian was being serious this time, the song was played with immense power of mental control.The swordsman also initiated his attack. He charged as fast as thunder toward Ye Futian. However, there was a continuous sound. It pierced through his eardrum with a magical power, and he was also drawn into the illusion. Now, he saw himself charging toward Ye Futian, but in the background was a cliff.He realized he had been mentally attacked. He soon ignited his blade with the fire-element power he possessed. He jumped off into the air and came down with authority. His hands were holding the sword firmly, and the blade was pointed exactly at Ye Futian's forehead.Ye Futian suddenly sped up his fingers. His fingers were now insanely fast, and there was a dragon vaguely roaring in the song. Soon, he swung his hand towards his opponent, and the swordsman saw a dragon flying right at him. The dragon was not hurt by the blade at all, and totally engulfed his body in a second.In reality, people saw the swordsman suddenly stop his attack. He looked painful and desperate, and soon after, he fell onto the ground, severely injured.Ye Futian finished the last note of his song, and said peacefully, \"You all insult my professor but can only train disciples at this level?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 57": "Chapter 57: The Battle of the DisciplesTranslator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo StudioYe Futian's words acted as a slap to the face. The people who had previously insulted Hua Fengliu were now fuming, their expressions dark.It was a palace celebration and the Art Saint was present. They had simply wanted to get on his good side by badmouthing his rival. They had never expected for the Qin Devil's exceptionally gifted disciple to appear with a challenge.The young man sitting behind the qin had clean, carefree eyes.Yun Rou and the other dancers stared at his back with infatuation. It turned out that the young qin player was capable of shining so bright.Lin Xiyue and Xiao He could also feel Ye Futian's excellence. They were acquainted with the young man he had just defeated. The young man's skills were not lacking at all, but he was still defeated instantly by Ye Futian's musical spells. It was easy to see just how powerful Ye Futian was. Lin Xiyue thought, if it had been her up against him, the results would probably be the same.The venue fell into silence once again. Even though it was a simple challenge and did not seem to symbolize anything, the other youths knew better than to step up on a whim.Musical Spells attacked the spirit and were extremely forceful. The young swordsman Ye Futian had just defeated was also a three-starred Glory Plane sorcerer, so his spirit was pretty strong, but he was injured by Ye Futian's musical spell even though he had yet to put in full force. This meant that any martial or divination art cultivators below the three-starred Glory Plane should not even think about going up against Ye Futian. If your spirit was not strong enough, you would be immediately defeated by his musical spells.\"It seems like the Qin Devil has a successor. Who else is willing to give it a go?\" asked Lord Luo. His tone was still calm, but in his heart, he was very unhappy. Today was his birthday celebration, but his spotlight had been stolen by the Qin Devil's disciple. If Ye Futian had been the disciple of a friend, it would have been better, but he was the disciple of the Qin Devil. Since Lord Luo was good friends with the Art Saint, it was only natural that he did not like Hua Fengliu very much. Plus, what Ye Futian said before had offended many people, and all of these people were his guests.However, Ye Futian had been frank about his intentions from the beginning, which made it hard to pick any problems with him. After all, the group of elders could not blatantly pick on a youngster. Therefore, the best solution was to have Ye Futian be defeated by one of the young people present.\"I'll go,\" someone uttered. From the crowd, an excited young man dressed in extravagant golden clothing came forth. His aura was remarkable.\"That's Xu Qing. He's a Thunder and Fire bi-elemental sorcerer in the four-starred Glory Plane,\" said someone in the crowd. Everyone looked at him with anticipation, especially the youngsters from the Luo Palace. The spirit of four-starred Glory Plane cultivators was slightly stronger and should be able to withstand Ye Futian's musical attacks. As long as the musical spells had no effect, Ye Futian was defeated.\"Xu Qing, four-starred Glory Plane sorcerer,\" Xu Qing introduced himself to Ye Futian.\"Please,\" answered Ye Futian, not losing his patience. As he invited Xu Qing onto the makeshift battlefield, Ye Futian lowered his head and his fingers began to stroke the chords once again, blocking out everyone else in his surroundings.The people frowned as they listened to him play. This time around, his music lacked the feeling from before. The notes seemed to be random, unable to form into a distinguishable piece.\"The Demon Flurry,\" a look of recognition was on the Art Saint's face. He was old rivals with Hua Fengliu and was therefore familiar with his attack pieces. The piece that Ye Futian played before was the Cangshan Dragon Chant, and this was the Demon Flurry. What seemed to be a disorganized piece was actually very powerful to deal with.Thunder and Fire Elemental Spiritual Qi erupted from Xu Qing and it flowed around him as it harmonized with his spirit.The notes of Ye Futian's qin continued to enter his ears. Xu Qing grew increasingly agitated. He was unable to focus his spirit and he felt himself lose control of the Spiritual Qi as he attempted to gather it for a spell.In sorcery, it was essential for one's spirit to accurately and efficiently gather Spiritual Qi, or else the spells would never succeed. The crowd began to take notice of the strange scene. Xu Qing continued to gather large amounts of Spiritual Qi but had yet to be able to form a spell. The Spirital Qi continued to revolve around Xu Qing in a violent manner.\"What's happening?\" The people were curious. Ye Futian's musical spell seemed to only be affecting one person. The invisible sound waves were all focused in Xu Qing's direction. The onlookers could only hear random chords being played, but Xu Qing was able to hear the spirit-attacking piece of the Demon Flurry clearly.Xu Qing remained in one spot. He looked terrible as the sweat ran down his face. Something was wrong with the atmosphere around him. The Demon Flurry did not attack directly, as the Cangchan Dragon Chant did. Instead, it obstructed the release of the subject's sorcery. This piece was a sorcerer's kryptonite.As Ye Futian continued to played, it became increasingly difficult for Xu Qing to focus his spirit. His will was weakening. This battle took such a large toll on him, like nothing he had ever experienced before, but at the same time, this was his first time going against a musical sorcerer.\"The results are clear. That's enough,\" said the Art Saint.\u00a0His calm voice managed to carry great force, interrupting the music once again.Ye Futian took his hands off the qin, looking as calm as ever. It was as if he had just played any ol' piece. On the other hand, Xu Qing, who was still standing, looked as pale as a ghost. His body was shaking lightly, and he glared at Ye Futian with burning rage. Xu Qing had never been so humiliated before.Was that really a battle? From beginning to end, Xu Qing did not get a single opportunity to make his move. He was trapped by the music. If they had continued, his spirit would have been depleted.The Art Saint looked at Ye Futian. Hua Fengliu did not come back to Donghai City with his disciple as retirement plan.\"Step down,\" ordered Lord Luo when he saw that Xu Qing had no intention of moving from his position. Xu Qing was unwilling, but because Lord Luo said so, he backed down. His legs shook weakly beneath him as he walked away. He began to wonder, what would have happened if he gave up on gathering Spiritual Qi for a spell and chose to attack at close-range instead? Xu Qing regretted not trying.Ye Futian remained seated and only stood when no one else came forward. To Lord Luo he said, \"My deepest apologies for interrupting your birthday celebration. I only wished to punish these people for their disrespectful words towards my master. I will excuse myself now.\"\"You already started your tantrum. Do you think you can just leave like this?\" someone voiced coldly. Everyone turned their attention to the young man beside the Art Saint. Zhou Mu was shooting daggers at Ye Futian with his eyes.The Art Saint disabled the Qin Devil years ago. Now, were their disciples going to recreate history?The youngsters in the crowd were excited. Only Zhou Mu could avenge them now. Ye Futian's musical sorcery was able to restrain both martial and divination art cultivators.\"You want to duel?\" asked Ye Futian.\"Zhou Mu, five-starred Glory Plane. I'm on a higher level than you and initially had no plans of challenging you, but seeing how arrogant you are, I can only step up to the plate. Don't say that I'm bullying you,\" warned Zhou Mu. Then he stepped up and stood opposite of Ye Futian.Everyone had their eyes glued on the two young men. They sneered at Ye Futian. If they had simply let him go, not only the people who badmouthed Hua Fengliu, but all the youngsters present as well, would have felt utterly humiliated. Now that Zhou Mu was going to make his move, the results were set.Lin Xiyue was also looking at the two young men. Ye Futian's performance was very surprising, but his opponent this time was Zhou Mu. She really hoped that he would reject the challenge. Zhou Mu was at a higher level than Ye Futian and so, it would not be embarrassing for him to reject.\"Then, let's fight!\" Just as Lin Xiyue was thinking, Ye Futian had already spoken. He returned to his seat once more. Hua Fengliu had his powers disabled by the Art Saint all those years ago, but Ye Futian was still not powerful enough to get revenge. However, fighting the Art Saint's disciple was something he could manage.Ye Futian sat down and the music started again. Zhou Mu bent down on the ground and drew with his hands. Spiritual Qi gathered at his fingertips and was released to form a picture. It was a life-like goshawk. He heard the notes that Ye Futian played but remained unaffected because he was a powerful five-starred Glory Plane cultivator. His spirit was strong and therefore unaffected. Xu Qing continued to draw. Not long after, he completed the goshawk and it soared through the sky and headed to attack Ye Futian.Bystanders were shocked, Xu Qing's skills as a conjurer were too powerful.The pace at which Ye Futian played sped up. His fingers flew rapidly across the instruments, every note attacked the goshawk. This caused the goshawk's body to break down piece by piece, but because it felt no pain, the goshawk did not halt its attacks on Ye Futian. After a while, only half of the goshawk's body was left, but it still descended with talons ready to attack Ye Futian.Ye Futian continued to stroke at the chords and finally, the goshawk's body broke apart completely. Simultaneously, Ye Futian's qin broke apart as well.\u00a0A gust of wind swept past. Ye Futian's clothes and hair danced in the wind.\"Vulnerable.\" The people were stunned by what happened and began commenting on Ye Futian's defeat. Zhou Mu was powerful indeed. Ye Futian was defeated as soon as he stepped in.Ye Futian was a musical sorcerer. How was he going to battle without a qin?Lin Xiyue sighed. Ye Futian was strong, but his opponent was the Art Saint's genius disciple.However, Ye Futian was unfazed. He had a silent epiphany. He finally understood why Hua Fengliu lost to the Art Saint. The creature created by Zhou Mu was unaffected by the sounds of the qin. After receiving multiple blows to its body, it continued to attack. It was all because it was lifeless, only controlled by the conjurer. Musical spells were able to restrained ordinary martial and divination art cultivators but were restrained by conjurers.It was also because of this that one blow from Zhou Mu, who was two levels higher than himself, destroyed his qin.\"Is this all you've got?\" Zhou Mu was throwing Ye Futian's words back at him. Zhou Mu stood in place with great pride.\"Although I have Master's guidance, I lack the gift and am still unable to learn the main points of musical sorcery,\" said Ye Futian. \"And that's why musical sorcery is only my weakest link.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Moments before, Zhou Mu, the disciple of the Art Saint, had accepted the Ye Futian challenge and even broke his guqin. People were about to latch on this chance and chastise Ye Futian in order to retrieve their dignity. However, even before they began, Ye Futian shocked them again with his overbearing statement.Musical sorcery was his worst talent?They had seen many people who were reluctant to admit defeat, but they now considered Ye Futian even worse, almost shameless.Ye Futian defeated two young geniuses with music spells, and successfully intimidated a lot of others. However, now he claimed that musical sorcery was his weakest skill. He was intentionally humiliating the young men at the banquet, suggesting that they were too lame to even compete with his worst skill. It almost seemed that he forgot the fact that his guqin had been broken within a second.The big chiefs in the room did not believe him either. He acted like his defeat had not happened.This was intolerable.\"Your instrument has been broken. How dare you keep talking like this! Show me what you got without your guqin, now.\" Xu Qing was still mad that he did not get to beat up Ye Futian. He was a Four-star Glory Plane mage with double-element talent, but he did not even get the chance to fight. This was something he felt very angry about.\"You are not good enough for me,\" Ye Futian said peacefully while walking toward Zhou Mu. Xu Qing ignored his rejection. He stood up from his seat, and the Spirit and Qi around his body started to gather in a frenzy.Ye Futian stopped walking, and gave Xu Qing a glance. He noticed that thunder bolts clashed around Xu Qing, and rage was burning in his eyes. Xu Qing believed his previous defeat only happened because his spell channeling had been interfered with by the music spell. Otherwise, Ye Futian would have been doomed.\"Thunder spell, the Thunder Vortex.\" All the thunderbolts converged over his body, and Xu Qing almost looked like Thor's incarnate. Piercing lights were centered in his palm, and its power would be tremendous.However, Ye Futian started smiling. He also reached out his hands, and suddenly, there were also thunderbolts converging into his palm. Soon, there was a whirl of thunder that formed a sphere in his right hand.\"I can do that too.\" Ye Futian sounded peaceful. People were so shocked that two boys were channeling the same spell. Even though Ye Futian was in the lower plane, the thunder bolts in his palm were actually more converged than those Xu Qing's palm. It actually indicated that Ye Futian possessed a higher level of control over this spell than Xu Qing did.Xu Qing was extremely embarrassed. It was considered an utter humiliation to counter the attack of one's opponent with the same spell.\"Charge!\" Ye Qing cast his vortex toward Ye Futian. The thunderbolts were so fast that they would pierce through Ye Futian's body in a second. Xu Qing did not stop there. He started converging the fire element to initiate the following spell. As a double-element mage, he was good at spell combos.However, Ye Futian easily dodged the thunder vortex. He started charging toward Xu Qing, carrying his own thunder vortex in his palm. This spell was supposed to be a ranged attack, but Ye Futian transformed it into melee range. Ye Futian almost teleported across the space between them, and he appeared right in front of Xu Qing without leaving him any time to react. Xu Qing's body was frozen.Ye Futian was looking at Xu Qing directly in the eye. His palm was so close to his body that Xu Qing was just several centimeters away from death. He realized that Ye Futian was showering him with mercy.\"Are we done?\" Ye Futian dispelled his attack, then turned around and kept walking to Zhou Mu, leaving Xu Qing behind him, dumbfounded. He walked and talked in such a peaceful manner that people even somehow started to respect him.He defeated Xu Qing, a powerful mage, with the exact same spell. How incredible was that? Was it true that musical sorcery was his weakest ability? As a disciple of the Qin Devil, was he still hiding more unknown power from everybody?Ye Futian stopped in front of Zhou Mu. He laughed and challenged Zhou Mu, \"Ye Futian, Three-star Glory Plane. Please show me your ways.\"People knew he was doing this intentionally. They already knew his plane. He made this introduction only to agitate Zhou Mu.Zhou Mu ignored this provocation. The Spirit and Qi started converging in his body. He drew something in the air with his hand, and people noticed it was a sharp sword. The sword was made of gold-element Qi in the universe.\"Zhou Mu is serious.\" The audience was curious about how Ye Futian would finally be defeated by a real genius.Zhou Mu suddenly launched his attack. The sword aimed right at Ye Futian's throat, and it was flying really fast. Ye Futian also made a quick reaction. He leaned to his left, and the sword missed him by such a narrow margin that it actually cut off several of his hairs.\"What?\" Ye Futian sensed danger coming from behind. After missing the first strike, the sword turned around and flew back at him. However, meanwhile, another sword was approaching from the opposite direction. With a single stroke, swords were created endlessly.\"Controlling the swords with mental power?\" Ye Futian was shocked at this ability. Invoker and musical sorcerer had the similar abilities in mental control.Ye Futian summoned a terrifying gold-element storm around his body to protect himself. The barrier was a dark gold, almost like a solid armor. When the swords connected with the barrier, rather than breaking through, they were absorbed by the armor.Since Zhou Mu was summoning hundreds of swords, each individual sword did not contain power strong enough to break through the barrier. But the quantity was just so immense. The swords Zhou Mu summoned were arranged into rows. Hundreds of swords hung all around the barrier Ye Futian summoned, not attacking. Zhou Mu was obviously looking for a weak spot to concentrate his attack. Meanwhile, he kept summoning more and more swords into the fight.Ye Futian believed he must act now to grab the upperhand. He suddenly came out of the barrier and appeared before Zhou Mu with wind-element power. He realized that as the disciple of the Art Saint, Zhou Mu was a perfect invoker. However, he seemed to be really weak at martial arts. Melee ranged attack might provide a good opportunity for Ye Futian.Countless swords suddenly started moving and chasing after him again. Several of them were deployed around Zhou Mu's body as defense mechanism. They were forming an array to intercept Ye Futian. However, Ye Futian slid through the defense, and kept approaching Zhou Mu.Zhou Mu also knew melee range was his weak spot. He initiated a wind-element spell to drive his body away from Ye Futian. The array of swords moved with him. As Ye Futian approached, the swords kept attacking him continuously. Zhou Mu was trying to block every possible route for Ye Futian.Ye Futian finally became impatient. He stopped dodging, and formed the golden armor around his body again. With the swords continuously crushing the armor, cracks started to show, and the armor finally shattered into pieces. However, a pair of wings appeared on his back. The golden wings covered his body from the swords, and he almost reached the melee range of Zhou Mu.Meanwhile, Zhou Mu had also finished his final summoning. He summoned a Demon Lion with wings on its back. In fact, people had never seen a Demon Lion like this. This monster was only made real because Zhou Mu was such a powerful invoker that he was able to inject his creation into form without being limited by reality.The Demon Lion pounced on Ye Futian. People were shocked at how Zhou Mu kept summoning different forms of monsters by drawing. His incomparable mental power made it possible for a sorcerer to block a warrior outside his melee range.When the Demon Lion almost reached his body, Ye Futian finally released his natal spirit\u2014the Devine Roc. He decided not to hide this ability anymore because he had already released the roc in Donghai Academy.\"A Mandate Sorcerer.\" People were surprised and awed.The Devine Roc was made of wind and gold element powers. However, Ye Futian was also a musical sorcerer. People were curious where that power of mental control came from. It obviously did not belong to the Devine Roc.A gold and gray storm consisting of both gold and wind elements converged around his body. Soon, he jumped into the air, and the speed he showed obviously came from the wind-element spell.Ye Futian became the incarnate of Devine Roc himself. The Devine Roc crashed with the Demon Lion in the air, and it generated a strong shock wave, knocking over many desks.While people opened their eyes again after the shock wave, they noticed that the Demon Lion failed. The momentum of Devine Rock tore the lion into pieces of Spirit and Qi, which soon disappeared in the space.The audience lost any previous estimation of how powerful Ye Futian was supposed to be. He was a musical sorcerer, a multi-element, a Mandate Sorcerer, and a warrior. He even had such a powerful natal spirit. It seemed as if he had no weak spots at all. No wonder he said musical sorcery was his weak link.He had not been lying.Lin Xiyue was astonished. She never imagined that the pretty boy she met would soon unveil his disguise and show how powerful he was.Nandou Wenshan felt a little bit frustrated. Now it was apparent that the disciple of the Qin Devil was more talented than the disciple of the Art Saint. The only reason Zhou Mu did not lose the fight in an embarrassing way was because he was still in the higher plane.\"That's all you got? You are in the higher plane than I am.\" Ye Futian laughed at Zhou Mu. Zhou Mu was seriously pissed off, and decided to release his own natal spirit. The natal spirit was a shadow with the eyes of Satan. Evil mental power was permeating around Zhou Mu.Ye Futian recognized this natal spirit. It was a mind controlling natal spirit, and Ye Futian believed there was quite a lot of similarities between this one and the Eyes of Storm he possessed.Ye Futian was about to turn to the audience and announce that the fight was over. However, he suddenly perceived Zhou Mu's natal spirit. But it was too late. The mental power pierced into his mind, and somehow started warning him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Spiritual Energy was an invisible force. If a powerful cultivator in the Arcana Plane made a move with the energy, it was definitely possible for it to go unnoticed by others.\"That's enough. Go home,\" a low voice resonated in his mind. It was hard to tell who the voice belonged to, but it did not seem to mean any harm. The voice only wanted to persuade him to stop here.In reality, Ye Futian had already announced his leave after defeating Xu Qing, but Zhou Mu stepped up, so he could only continue to fight. Hua Fengliu once lost to the Art Saint and even had his Life Spirit disabled. Then today, people insulted him. The Art Saint's disciple made the first move and went as far as destroying the guqin that Ye Futian played, he could not just walk away after defeat. How would that reflect on Hua Fengliu?That was the reason for his attacks on Zhou Mu.Just as Ye Futian was deep in thought, Zhou Mu had completed yet another drawing. This time, it was a large golden dragon, ferocious and arrogant. The Golden Dragon revolved around Zhou Mu's being, the energy from his Life Spirit rushed out in a crazed manner and descended on the dragon. It was as if a real dragon was present. Those that were shocked by Ye Futian were now in awe because of Zhou Mu. He was even more intimidating since he was going all in.Ye Futian showed no expression. A wild force of Spiritual Qi gathered in his body and formed a golden roc. He flew into the sky and shined brighter than anything else. At this point, Ye Futian's only option was to fight until the end. However, he still appreciated the voice for warning him.Zhou Mu and Ye Futian moved at the same time. The Golden Dragon and the Golden Roc were about to collide. The Spiritual Qi in the atmosphere went wild and the skies began to change color. High level cultivators at the venue joined hands to create a force field to block out the powerful energy given off by Ye Futian and Zhou Mu's attacks.Just then, Ye Futian felt another force of spiritual energy invade his mind. This time, there were no warnings, but a direct attack. Ye Futian felt a stabbing pain, then his nerves began to grow numb, almost like he was about to lose all his senses. Just as he was approaching Zhou Mu, Ye Futian lost control of the flow of Spiritual Qi.BOOM! A loud crash. Ye Futian had no idea where the attack came from, but after he was attacked, his own attack on Zhou Mu was weakened by a significant amount. The Golden Dragon imploded, Zhou Mu and Ye Futian retreated at the same time. All of these events happened in the span of minutes. When Ye Futian landed on the ground, he felt no anger, but smiled instead.There were a lot of important people present at today's celebration. It was only natural that they could not put down their pride to intrude in a battle between two youngsters, but if they couldn't do it blatantly, they could do it in secret. Looks like the first voice that warned him knew that this would happen.Who was it that warned him? And who was it that attacked him?Obviously, Ye Futian was not dumb enough to reveal that he had been attacked. His attacker was most likely looking for an excuse to put him in his place. If he were to come out and accuse of the high authority figures, then they would have a legitimate reason to get rid of Ye Futian.\"Thank you for this experience.\" Ye Futian smiled. However, he was not looking at Zhou Mu when he said this, but to the group of VIPs. His attacker would understand what he meant.\"I have unwillingly disturbed your celebration, Lord Luo. I am grateful for your understanding. If you'll excuse me, I shall be on my way now.\" Ye Futian smiled as he bowed and turned to leave. He didn't not want to fight any longer. His attack had already resorted to this method. If Ye Futian did not stop the battle, he would only be at a disadvantage.\"The battle isn't over. Are you really leaving?\" Zhou Mu shouted at Ye Futian's back. He seemed to have gained quite a bit of confidence.\"Zhou Mu, that's enough,\" said the Art Saint. Zhou Mu was stunned, but when he recovered, he spoke again, \"If the opportunity ever comes again, we shall finish where we left off. At that time, I will be sure to give it my all.\"\"Sure. Today is Lord Luo's celebration, so I didn't want to cause too much of a ruckus. Therefore, I only used about fifty percent of my power. When we battle again, you'll see what I'm talking about,\" said Ye Futian as he continued on his way out of the palace.His words piqued Zhou Mu's interest. Ye Futian was able to drive him to a breaking point, but now he said that he was only using half of his powers?\"Shameless!\"\"Maniac.\" Everyone began voicing their opinions of Ye Futian. Somebody tried to brown-nose the Art Saint once again. \"The Art Saint was nice enough to let him go without making him look bad after being defeated by Zhou Mu, how dare he say such ridiculous things? Absolutely preposterous!\"\"That shameless b*stard.\" The insults continued around the venue.\"Zhou Mu's performance was fascinating! He is definitely fitting as your disciple, Brother Hua,\" complimented Lord Luo. Many people agreed with him, but the high-powered people present knew even though Zhou Mu was able to fend off Ye Futian's attack towards the end, there was no telling how things would have ended had they continued their battle. Plus, Zhou Mu was two levels above Ye Futian. His victory in this battle was nothing to brag about.Xia Fan did not look too good. He realized that he never got to truly get to know Ye Futian. His extraordinary gifts would explain why Hua Fengliu was willing to take him in as a disciple and even went crazy to try to save him. Ye Futian had to be rid of as soon as possible. He could not be allowed to keep growing stronger.At the party venue, besides the rivalry between the Art Saint and Ye Futian's master, the Guqin Devil, nobody had anything against Ye Futian himself. Even if they had been humiliated by him today, it could not be considered a bloody feud. Therefore, they had no need to be wary of Ye Futian. However, it was different for Xia Yan. If he allowed Ye Futian to keep getting stronger, Ye Futian would definitely try to kill him.\"I never expected Ye Futian to be able to withstand a battle with Zhou Mu. He is pretty gifted. No wonder the Guqin Devil took him as a disciple. When I was in the City of Qingzhou, I even saw him flirting with Hua Jieyu. The two of them seemed to have an extraordinary relationship. I'm afraid she has fallen victim to his lies. Ye Futian harbors bad intentions,\" said Xia Fan. His words drew everyone's attention. It was obvious that Xia Fan had something against Ye Futian.\"Hua Jieyu is the little princess of the Nandou family, and from what everyone said, has an excellent gift. Brother Nandou, you should keep an eye out,\" said Lord Luo. Nandou Wenshan looked at Lord Luo and said, \"Thank you for your advice, but Hua Jieyu was in Qingzhou City cultivating under her father's guidance and Ye Futian is his disciple. It's only natural that they will be in good relations with one another. However, I will still remember to have a talk with her.\"\"I'm sure that you will come to your own conclusions,\" nodded Lord Luo. Beside him, the Art Saint was in deep thought. After a while, he spoke up, \"Ye Futian did not come to convey his blessings. If my predictions are correct, he came because Lord Luo could heal Hua Fengliu's injury.\"Lord Luo was stunned. \"You're saying that he originally wanted to come and ask me to heal his master?\"\"That's right,\" nodded the Art Saint. He thought back at home Ye Futian stood up to the people who insulted Hua Fengliu and could not help but say, \"Hua Fengliu choose a good disciple.\"The Art Saint personally complimented Ye Futian. Nobody knew what to say to that.\"Zhou Mu, head to Donghai Academy's School of the Emperor Star tomorrow,\" the Art Daint said suddenly. His voice was calm, as if he knew that just one word could get Zhou Mu into the school without testing. In addition, none of the high-powered authorities thought that this was strange. On the contrary, it seemed like such a normal thing. Even the elder from the Emperor Star school did not seem to have a problem with this. Ye Futian would have never seen this coming.\"Okay,\" Zhou Mu nodded. Hua Jieyu of the Nanou family was also in the Emperor Star school. Also, Ye Futian attended Donghai Academy as well.\"A big congratulation to the School of the Emperor Star for gaining yet another spectacular student.\" Lord Luo smiled at the elder.Lin Xiyue observed everything in silence. Ye Futian's handsome figure appeared in her mind. That reckless fellow had no idea of the relationship between the Emperor Star school, the Art Saint, and Lord Luo. It was a good thing that he was clever. Although he was reckless, he was also careful. He did not do or say anything that could be used to threaten him in the future. Although a public setting such as this could not be considered dangerous, it seemed like Ye Futian had already made some enemies.The celebration continued but could not return to the atmosphere at the beginning of the event. Lord Luo was supposed to be the only star of the night. However, his spotlight was stolen by Ye Futian.At this moment, Ye Futian was headed back to Donghai Academy mounted on the black wind eagle. The wind blowing on him cleared his mind as well. He knew clearly that his actions today were reckless, but he could not bear to watch as the Art Saint received everyone's respect, and his disciple flooded with compliments, while Hua Fengliu was disabled and insulted to make the Art Saint look better.\"I'm afraid I've offended some people today,\" Ye Futian muttered. He must be careful from now on. Especially around Xia Fan. Ye Futian knew that after the battle, Xia Fan was definitely going to try to kill him. As for the others, they may worry about their reputation and therefore not be able to take care of Ye Futian personally, but that did not mean they wouldn't try to operate in the shadows. This point was evident when he was attacked during the battle against Zhou Mu.The person who attacked me is either the Art Saint or Lord Luo, Ye Futian thought to himself. They were both sorcerers of the Spirit Element.And the person who gave me that warning was most likely the elder from the School of the Emperor Star, Ye Futian analyzed....When Ye Futian got back to Donghai Academy, many people stared at him. He was becoming more and more well-known around campus. However, Ye Futian paid them no attention and continued on his way. It was then that several people came up and blocked his path.\"Ye Futian,\" said the leader of the pack.\"Yes?\" Ye Futian had never seen this person before.\"Jing Yang of the School of the Flirting Star wishes to challenge you. Why do you keep avoiding it?\" asked the person.Ye Futian looked at the person in front of him and thought of how stupid this was. He did not want to acknowledge them and so, he chose to escape from the side.\"When you said you didn't have time, it was just a poor excuse, wasn't it? You only got accepted into the School of the Finance Star because you defeated students from our school. Are you scared now that you got into the academy? Is this who you really are? Don't you think you're disgracing your school?\" the person continued to pester Ye Futian.There were many onlookers at this point. Ye Futian stopped in place. With his back still facing the students of the Flirting Star school, he said, \"I'm not in a good mood right now, so you better shut up and stop trying to pick a fight with me, or else you'll regret it.\"Finishing what he had to said, Ye Futian was ready to walk away again, but the person would not take no for an answer. He laughed and said, \"You're really opening my eyes to something new. I've never met a person who can be so thick-skinned after being too chicken to battle.\"The foot that Ye Futian picked up to leave was placed on the ground once again. Everyone watched as he turned around with a bright big smile and said, \"Tell Jing Yang, I will be waiting for him here.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 60": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Legend of FutianCH 60Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe news that Ye Futian finally accepted Jing Yang's challenge soon spread around all the academy, causing a great sensation. People were now swarming toward the dorm where Ye Futian lived.Several weeks before, when Ye Futian was first accepted to the School of Finance Star, Jing Yan issued him a letter formally challenging him, and Ye Futian rejected it with the excuse that \"he did not have time\", which made people confused. Jing Yang commented arrogantly on the response from Ye Futian, saying he was \"just so-so\". The whole story was rather dramatic.One of them was the genius who just got admitted, and the other one was the top student from the School of Flirting Star. This challenge was really important to students in the School of Flirting Star, because they hungered for the revenge. Ye Futian's attitude truly made them upset. Now, Ye Futian was agitated, and agreed to fight.There was already a large audience watching Ye Futian. He stood peacefully, with his hands in his pockets. He acted almost like a master in this school. Tang Wan was looking at him, and believed he was using this manner as a bluff.Most students in the School of Flirting Star gradually arrived. They were all staring at Ye Futian with hatred. They believed Jing Yang would definitely win this fight, because he was the private disciple of someone powerful who ran this school.There were also many students from the School of Finance Star. Some of them did not like Ye Futian much, but still, they hoped that Ye Futian would win. At least Ye Futian was attending the same school, so this fight was obviously about dignity. Mu Yunqing and Mu Yunni also came. They had been badly anticipating the fight, because there was finally someone able to get revenge for them.Since Jing Yang was not studying in the same place with others, he arrived a little bit late. When he arrived, he was surrounded by students from the School of Flirting Star. They were loud and imposing.The audience moved and formed a path for Jing Yang. The group with him also stopped, and let him enter the field where Ye Futian was waiting.\"Finally, you agree to fight, coward?\" Jing Yang sneered at him. In fact, it was unexpected that Ye Futian accepted the challenge.\"Stop spouting nonsense. You have wasted so much of my time, so just shut up and prepare to get your *ss kicked.\" Ye Futian looked at Jing Yang for the very first time. Jing Yang was confused about his attitude, and wondered how crazy this boy was to say something like that.The audience was also shocked. They could not understand this contempt from Ye Futian at all. Jing Yang was the superstar in the School of Flirting Star, the private disciple of someone truly powerful who ran the school. However, Ye Futian acted so arrogantly, as if it was a waste of his time to wait for Jing Yang.People soon remembered his \"no time for this\" comment about challenge, and became speechless about this boy. They realized he had never taken this fight seriously from the beginning. People from the School of Flirting Star looked extremely embarrassed. Never had there been a student who disrespected their school in such a way.Jing Yang sneered at Ye Futian, \"You are the first guy I\u2014\"Ye Futian did not let him finish. He initiated his attack, shooting his body at Jing Yang like a thunder. Jing Yang swallowed the second half of his sentence. He started driving the Spirit and Qi in the universe to react.\"Silk Imprisonment!\" Jing Yang cast his spell. The gold-element power formed countless silk threads that flew towards Ye Futian. They were blocking the space around him, confining his movement.\"He is a genius, is he not?\" People were in awed by Jing Yang. There are different levels of difficulty for spells, and Silk Imprisonment was definitely among the top level of all spells. It required extremely strong mental control to run thousands of silk threads at the same time. This spell was really mighty because it could confine the freedom of opponent, or directly kill him, depending on the will of the spell caster.A pair of golden wings made of Spirit and Qi appeared on Ye Futian's back, and the wings were so sharp that they slashed the countless silk threads into pieces. The attack from Jing Yang was not effective at all facing the absolute power of Ye Futian.Jing Yang was caught by surprise for a moment. He did not anticipate that Ye Futian could survive his previous attack. He changed his spell a little, and suddenly, all the silk threads straightened and rained down as needles. Ye Futian wrapped his wings around his body to protect himself from the needles, and charged at lightning speed at Jing Yang, leaving only his shadow behind.The next moment, Jing Yang saw a fist coming at him. Instead of fancy techniques, it was just a simple punch.Without any time for a reaction, Jing Yang's body fell to the ground, blood covering his face. He was the same plane as Ye Futian and the latter didn't want to waste his time.However, he was finally forced to accept because so many students in the academy started considering him a coward. He had to fight for his own reputation.This punch made the audience feel as if their hearts were shaking. It was truly nasty and rough.Soon, all they witnessed as Ye Futian endlessly punched Jing Yang with his bare fists. Bang, bang, bang\u2026 With every sound of the solid punches, the audience was becoming more shocked by this fight.\"Satisfied?\" Ye Futian said coldly.People were totally speechless. Ye Futian asked Jing Yang if \"he was ready to get his *ass kicked\" before the fight, and now he was restating his point. What an arrogant attitude!People were confused by how quickly and easily Jing Yang had been defeated. He was the private disciple of the School of the Flirting Star's supervisor, and had said that Ye Futian was 'so-so\" before the fight. However, he had been totally humiliated by this fight.Just so-so? That was Jing Yang, not Ye Futian.\"Stop!\" Students from the School of Flirting Star felt angry, and yelled at Ye Futian.Ye Futian stood up and looked at those students. He laughed and said, \"Is this what you were asking for?\" He let go of Jing Yang and left. People even forgot to check on Jing Yang after he left. Ye Futian could feel hundreds of eyes following him. This feeling of being the center of attention gave him a weird feeling of pride.\"It's not my fault. They asked for it.\" It seemed that as long as Ye Futian was still a student of Donghai Academy, this humiliation of the School of Flirting Star would never be erased....\u2026Ye Futian's mind was eased slightly after he let out his rage on Jing Yang. Staying in the Lord Palace was a good life for him, but somehow he felt depressed, especially now that it was impossible to find some help for Hua Fengliu.When he returned to the room, he noticed that there was one more person. Yu Sheng had lived with him for a long time. However, there was someone standing next to Yu Sheng in their room. Ye Futian was surprised when the he clearly saw the person. He kept blinking to make sure it was true.It was a girl, about sixteen-years-old, standing next to Yu Sheng. She was petite and cute, with a gorgeous face. Ye Futian confirmed with a quick glance that this girl was definitely a sweetheart.Yu Sheng and the girl noticed that Ye Futian was back. The girl looked at Ye Futian and started smiling. Yu Sheng opened his mouth, as if he was trying to explain.\"Keep going. Just ignore me.\" Ye Futian turned around.\"Wait,\" a soft voice said. Ye Futian stopped, and saw the girl smiling at him. When she was smiling, the beauty from her unique youthfulness was even more attractive.\"It's not what it looks like,\" Yu Sheng tried to explain.Ye Futian laughed and asked, \"What does it look like?\"\"Uh...\" Yu Sheng was silent, not sure what to say. He had always been awkward compared to Ye Futian. \"Qingxuan came here for us,\" Yu Sheng said.\"Wow, you're using just her first name already. Sounds like there's been great progress between you guys, right?\" Ye Futian was still making fun of him. Yu Sheng did not know how to respond at all.\"I told him to call me by my first name.\" The girl smiled and said, \"I'm Yi Qingxuan, so just call me Qingxuan.\"\"Ye Futian.\" He also introduced himself.\"I know you.\" Yi Qingxuan nodded, \"I was there watching your first fight with the School of Flirting Star. I saw every bit of the fight. You were so good.\"\"Yu Sheng is better.\" Ye Futian was still laughing. It was almost like he was trying to make Yu Sheng more embarrassed.\"You are both really good.\" She kept smiling.\"He's not only good. You know what? He's single and available too.\"Yu Sheng wanted to run out the room.Yi Qingxuan fluttered her beautiful lashes and smiled. \"You guys are interesting. I guess I will see you next time.\"She soon stood up and left. As she passed by Ye Futian, he whispered to her, \"What do think about my buddy? Like him?\"Yi Qingxuan blushed and answered in lowered voice, \"He's nice.\" Then she just ran out of the room.Ye Futian started to laugh even harder. He looked at Yu Sheng with a wicked smile and asked, \"Tell me, Yu Sheng, how far did you go with her when I was not here?\"Yu Sheng said, \"She came to ask whether we would be willing to get tested and go to the upper level of cultivation in the School of Finance Star.\"\"She was sent here by the supervisor?\" Ye Futian was curious.\"I guess so. I did not ask,\" Yu Sheng said.\"She must be someone special in this school. Not to mention, she is so beautiful and sweet. I think she's good for you. What do you think?\" Ye Futian asked Yu Sheng.\"I have no idea what you are talking about.\" Yu Sheng was numb.\"Boy, she blushed when I asked her about you. I guess she's got a crush on you. Do you have the same feeling?\" Ye Futian kept nagging him.\"My father told me to stay away from girls, you know that. He told me my lifelong task is to help you build your kingdom.\" Yu Sheng was serious.Ye Futian had to stop joking when he realized Yu Sheng meant what he said. Then he started talking again, \"Yu Sheng, I know my godfather has really high expectations for me, but I believe the future is still far away for us. Life is so long that neither you nor I knows where we will end up. I know he believes I was born to be the king, but there's a long journey ahead of us. So, I hope we can enjoy this journey together. We are brothers, not master and servant. The future belongs to both of us.\"\"It's his will that I should live for you. It's meant to be this way,\" Yu Sheng insisted.\"I told you, he's not here, so forget about what he said. My word is the law now.\" Ye Futian had suddenly started to yell. Yu Sheng was shocked seeing him angry. He lowered his head, but still looked stubborn.The guilty look on Yu Sheng's face made Ye Futian somewhat regret yelling at him. He lowered his voice and said, \"Yu Sheng, forget the shackles he has put on you. You should have your own life, a really happy one. If you do, I will also feel happy for you even you leave me alone someday.\"Yu Sheng looked at Ye Futian, and found that he was smiling again. He almost cried, and swore to himself that he would never leave Ye Futian alone, ever.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 61": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Legend of FutianCH 61Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayYe Futian of the School of the Finance Star had brutally defeated Jing Yang from the School of the Flirting Star. This news spread like wildfire through the academy the following day. Everyone gossiped amongst themselves after hearing the details.Jing Yang had wanted to salvage his school's reputation but had been ruthlessly defeated by Ye Futian. He did not even get a chance to defend himself. All of these details made Jing Yang the laughing stock of the school. He had previously called out Ye Futian for being gutless and running away from his challenge. This time around, it was impossible to recover from the humiliation. Not only for Jing Yang, but for the School of the Flirting Star as well.The students of the Flirting Star school felt judged by their fellow schoolmates as they walked around the campus. They were so humiliated. It was because they had been humiliated that they wanted to retaliate against Ye Futian, but by the looks of things now, it was mission impossible. Ye Futian was a freak.It was not only the students of the Flirting Star school who thought this way. Everyone in Donghai Academy felt this way. Ye Futian was the devil in disguise.Within the School of the Emperor Star, Hua Jieyu was sitting in her dorm. Shu Yuyan was also with her. They were in the middle talking about Ye Futian's battle with Jing Yang. Hua Jieyu smiled as she asked, \"So you mean they served themselves up on a silver platter?\"\"Yeah. I heard that Ye Futian was not interested in their challenge, but they were being shameless. They blocked his way and threw insults at him. Only then did Ye Futian give in, and waited for Jing Yang. His first words when Jing Yang arrived were: 'Are you ready for a good beating?' Isn't he wild?\" laughed Shu Yuyan.Hua Jieyu smiled and replied, \"Yeah. He's awful.\"Shu Yuyan was a little suspicious of Hua Jieyu. She never used to be interested in such gossip, but after the first time Shu Yuyan mentioned Ye Futian, Hua Jieyu began to show interest. Now, she listened to every story with ears wide open.\"Last time you said that the person you liked was an awful guy, now you're showing so much interest in Ye Futian. You haven't had a change in heart, have you?\" Shu Yuyan asked Hua Jieyu.\"Uh...\" Hua Jieyu was dumbfounded. She went on to say, \"What are you talking about? I just think that punk is interesting.\"\"That's good. I really thought you had a change of heart. I would have felt so bad for the guy you liked,\" Shu Yuyan said. \"Oh, that's right! I heard teacher say that the Art Saint's disciple, Zhou Mu, will be coming to cultivate at the Emperor Star school. He doesn't even have to be tested. Rumors say that he is genius conjurer.\"\"Okay,\" Hua Jieyu replied nonchalantly. From her expression, Shu Yuyan knew that she was uninterested. Smiling, Shu Yuyan said, \"Looks like you don't have a single ounce of interest in the Art Saint's disciple. This makes me curious about what kind of person the guy you like is. How bad could he be?\"\"You'll find out in the future,\" Hua Jieyu gave her a sweet smile. Shu Yuyan was dazed by her smile. It seemed like Hua Jieyu was already in too deep....At the School of the Finance Star, Yi Qingxuan was back at Ye Futian and Yu Sheng's shared dormitory. When Ye Futian saw that she was present, he smiled. \"Should I excuse myself?\"\"What are you talking about?\" Yi Qingxuan looked a bit embarrassed. She shyly took a peek at Yu Sheng, before asking Ye Futian, \"You hit Jing Yang yesterday?\"\"He deserved it.\" Ye Futian shrugged. The other students from the Flirting Star school had forced him to, so he had no choice but to oblige.\"Jing Yang studies in the main building of the Flirting Star school, and the news that you brutally beat him up has already spread around the entire academy. You've made an enemy of their school,\" she told him weakly.Ye Futian was a little upset by this. He previously chose to ignore Jing Yang's challenge because one, he was not interested in humiliating Jing Yang, and two, he did not want any trouble. However, right now all the blame had fallen on Ye Futian, despite the fact that it was the School of the Flirting Star who initiated everything.It would have been fine if Donghai Academy was not separated into seven different schools, but Ye Futian already knew that the relationships between the schools were complicated. Each school existed as an individual entity. Now that he did what he did to the Flirting Star school, there was no way they would forgive him.Seeing how upset Ye Futian looked, Yi Qingxuan gave him a weak smile and asked, \"Do you want me to bring you guys up there?\"Ye Futian blinked a couple of times, then pointed at the large main building of the School of the Finance Star located on large stairway above. \"There?\"\"Yeah, but we might have to test your abilities first. Do you guys mind?\" asked Yi Qingxuan after she nodded.\"Not at all!\" Ye Futian gave her a big smile. He patted Yu Sheng on the shoulder and said, \"We're getting this opportunity thanks to you, man.\"\"What does this have to do with me? Wasn't it you who hit someone?\" Yu Sheng looked confused.\"You don't get it,\" Ye Futian said earnestly.\"You guys head out first. I'll follow,\" Ye Futian smiled and pushed Yu Sheng forward. Yu Sheng gave him a look of confusion and walked off.Yi Qingxuan caught up to Yu Sheng and whispered, \"How are you guys so good? How do you cultivate?\"\"I don't know either.\" Yu Sheng shook his head.\"When I saw you battle last time, you used powers from Metal Spiritual Qi. Which means that you probably have the gifts of a sorcerer, but you did not use any sorcery. You fought purely with martial art tactics. I don't even know where you get all that strength from,\" Yi Qingxuan complimented him.\"Isn't he the coolest?\" Ye Futian butted in abruptly.Yi Qingxuan turned to glare at Ye Futian. He shuddered and then gave her a smile. \"You guys continue, I promise not to eavesdrop anymore,\" he said.Yi Qingxuan turned her head and continued her conversation with Yu Sheng. As promised, Ye Futian walked behind them, not bothering the two. Yu Sheng was dominating and handsome while Yi Qingxuan was gentle and beautiful. They made a good match.The main building of the School of the Finance Star was a magnificent piece of architecture. The feeling it gave Ye Futian was not that of a school, but a sacred site. Many people greeted Yi Qingxuan with respect as they walked in. This made Yu Sheng and Ye Futian extremely curious. Also, she was able to bring the two of them into the main building. Who was she?Ye Futian observed his friends. He noticed looks of jealousy from a couple of the male students when they saw Yi Qingxuan chatting with Yu Sheng. To Ye Futian, it seemed like Yu Sheng had some love rivals.In the end, Yi Qingxuan led Ye Futian and Yu Sheng to a large hall. There were already people present: two elders stood at the front while eight younger individuals stood by them. Yi Qingxuan left Yu Sheng's side to stand beside the two elders.Ye Futian looked at her and wondered about her identity again. From the set-up, it was evident these people were prepared for their arrival.\"Yi Qingxuan told me that the two of you are extremely powerful. A while ago, there were rumors floating around that you two have been accepted into our school. But now we want to see your powers with our own eyes. These people here are all gifted students of the Finance Star school. They are all four-starred Glory Plane cultivators. You guys can take your pick of opponents, and we shall see if your powers are truly as strong as Yi Qingxuan told us,\" said one of the elders. Ye Futian finally understood. Their acceptance into the School of the Finance Star was thanks to Yi Qingxuan.This made much more sense. Even though their first battle had caused a ruckus at Donghai Academy, the higher ups of each school usually did not pay attention to the happenings in the academy. Thus, it made sense for them to be accepted under recommendation.\"Four-starred Glory Plane?\" Ye Futian chuckled. \"We can save the trouble then. Let's have them all go at once. No offense.\" He knew that this was not a time to be modest. If he did not bring out his full potential, there was no way he was going to be valued by the higher ups of the Finance Star school.\"You are just as arrogant as they say,\" chucked one of the eight students.\"I heard you defeated Jing Yang yesterday with a single punch. I'm curious, just how good are you? Don't let us down,\" said a young lady dressed in tight clothing, carrying a sword on her back.\"You'll find out soon.\" Ye Futian smiled and made formal introductions, \"Ye Futian. Yu Sheng. Nice to meet you all.\"\"We will have everyone go at once then,\" said the elder. The eight students got into formation, surrounding Ye Futian and Yu Sheng. The four of them faced forward, and the other four stayed in their original positions. In a split second, the Spiritual Qi in the room was off the charts.Vines shot out at the two of them. It was a Wood Elemental spell. The Spiritual Qi around Ye Futian erupted. Golden wings appeared, shaking violently, breaking the vines headed in his direction into pieces. Yu Sheng, on the other hand, stayed still where he stood, allowing the vines to wrap around his body.WHOOSH! Flames erupted, setting the vines ablaze. Yu Sheng's body seemed to be burning, but on the outside, golden armor protected his body. He continued to stand in place. On Ye Futian's body, a golden armor plate appeared. Two students charged towards Yu Sheng and two towards Ye Futian.BOOM! The vines wrapped around Yu Sheng's body burst open. He took one step forward and the ground began to shake. Two fists came towards Yu Sheng from different directions. With a loud collision, the two students landed their fists on Yu Sheng's body, one in the chest and one on his back. However, they were the ones who felt the pain. A second later, Yu Sheng reached out his arms to catch the two students by their forearms, and flung them into the air. They landed quite a distance away.At the same moment, the young lady began her attack on Ye Futian with a sword. Another student moved like a ghost and revolved around Ye Futian in a blur.Ye Futian stood still, but suddenly began to move his wings. He threw a punch, and the ghost-like blur was propelled into the air. Without skipping a beat, Ye Futian avoided the young lady's sword at the speed of lightning. His wings flapped in a crazed manner, throwing the young lady into the air as well. Eventually, she landed on the ground, face first.The battle had just started, and four of the students had already been defeated, laying on the ground. The other four students were dumbfounded. Were these two even human?\"Do you still want to continue?\" Ye Futian asked with a smile.\"That's enough.\" The two elders could not continue to watch their students like this. They had always thought that their students had a spectacular gift, but the students were defeated before they could even display their full potential.\"Let's go.\" The two elders turned to leave, obviously upset.Watching the two elders leave, the students felt embarrassed. The two students thrown out by Yu Sheng came running back, injured from head to toe. They took one look at Yu Sheng, and turned to leave as well. Amongst themselves, they whispered, \"This guy is a complete lunatic!\"\"Such bullies,\" said another student, also upset. He never would have thought that his first experience soaring through the skies would be like this.The girl with the sword crawled up off the floor and stood in front of Ye Futian with a face dirtied from being on the ground. She glared at him and said, \"You're not a man!\" She then left, feeling wronged. She was a beautiful, blossoming young lady, and she was gifted. In previous battles, even if she could not win, her opponents always went easy on her and would not attack her too ruthlessly. How could Ye Futian do this to her?Ye Futian stood there looking innocent of any wrongdoing. At the front of the hall, Yi Qingxuan laughed. These two were too much!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 62": "Chapter 62: Yu Sheng, Meet Your MasterTranslator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio\"Is that even my fault?\" Ye Futian noticed Yi Qingxuan was laughing at him, and felt upset that he had been made fun of by a woman.\"Sure, it's not your fault.\" Yi Qingxuan kept laughing, looking even cuter.Someone came out of the hall. He looked powerful, and soon fixed his eyes on Yu Sheng.\"Dad, I didn't lie, right?\" Yi Qingxuan was smiling at the man who just came out.He did not respond but kept looking at Yu Sheng. Yu Sheng was somehow confused.\"You were born to be a martial arts cultivator. Would you like to be my disciple?\" Yi Qingxuan's father asked Yu Sheng.Ye Futian's eyes sparkled. This girl seemed to have a powerful background in this school. Those two old men who tested them must also be powerful in this school, but they were only doing the pre-test for Ye Qingxuan's father, who was in fact, the decision maker.Yu Sheng looked at Ye Futian, seemingly indecisive.\"I'm sorry but you are...?\" Ye Futian asked politely. Yu Sheng needed to know his identity before becoming his disciple.\"I am the director of this school,\" the middle-aged man answered him. Ye Futian was surprised for a moment, then started smiling. He gave Yi Qingxuan a glance. Surprisingly, the reason why they were admitted into the School of Finance Star was actually because the daughter of Director had witnessed their fight. Now, she introduced him and Yu Sheng to her father again.\"My dad has been looking for a genius in martial arts to inherit his power, but none could be found. That's why I told him about you guys right after the fight,\" Yi Qingxuan told them.Ye Futian smiled and nodded. He said, \"Yu Sheng, hurry and bow down to your master.\" This man was the director in School of Finance Star, which was one of the seven schools in this academy. Ye Futian believed that he was most likely one of the most powerful people in this school as well.Yu Sheng nodded, and bowed reverently to the Director. \"Greetings, Professor, from Yu Sheng.\"\"Okay.\" The Director stopped looking so serious. He smiled at Yu Sheng and said, \"You will be cultivating with me from now on.\" Then he looked at Ye Futian again, and asked, \"What is your major? Sorcery or martial arts?\"\"Both,\" Ye Futian answered.\"I am looking for a disciple to inherit my martial arts techniques. Are you willing to also acknowledge me as your master?\" he asked.\"I already have a master. Mr. Director, do you know the Qin Devil?\" Ye Futian asked.The Director's eyes sparkled with surprise, then he asked Ye Futian, \"You are the disciple of Hua Fengliu?\"\"Yes.\" Ye Futian nodded. It sounded like the Qin Devil used to be so famous that even the director in this place knew him.\"How is he doing? Where is he living now?\" the Director asked.\"He has been severely injured. Now he is living in the Qin Garden to recuperate,\" Ye Futian answered.\"So, you have also been to the Qin Garden? How is Ms. Tang Lan doing?\" The Director had so many questions. Ye Futian was quite confused. Why did there seem to be something between him and Tang Lan?\"She's doing well. In fact, she is the one taking care of my professor,\" Ye Futian responded.\"I know it. She will never let it go. I used to try to persuade her many times that she should stay away from that guy. Hua Fengliu was no good at all, but a lone wolf who had no guilt about cheating. I just cannot understand why she likes him so badly.\" The Director suddenly became mad. Ye Futian was shocked. It seemed that a strong hatred existed between the Director and Ye Futian's professor.\"Mr. Director, so, it sounds like you have a history with my professor and Ms. Tang?\" Ye Futian asked in a lowered voice.\"History? Tang Lan used to be my disciple, and she just broke away from this school because of Hua Fengliu.\"Ye Futian did not know how to respond. He stood there, vividly embarrassed about asking this question.\"Whatever. It happened so many years ago. I just cannot believe how stubborn she is. She really did forget me, her first master. Next time you see her, just tell her that the past is the past, so if she finds some spare time, she's welcome to come visit,\" the Director told him.Ye Futian nodded, and said, \"Mr. Director, I can tell that Ms. Tang cares heavily about relations. Since you are her first master, I believe she definitely has not forgotten you. I guess she does not visit maybe because she feels guilty about what happened.\"\"I know. Otherwise, why would she take care of Hua Fengliu now?\" The Director sighed, then looked at Ye Futian. \"You are well-spoken and have good looks. I know Hua Fengliu accepted you as his disciple for a reason.\"Ye Futian was thinking, Mr. Hua, why does everyone think of you as a playboy, and just project it onto me?\"Qingxuan, stay away from this boy. Stay with Yu Sheng,\" The Director told his daughter.This demand tickled Ye Futian. He laughed and told the Director, \"I guess you are right.\"\"Okay, come with me.\" The Director turned around, and started walking. Yi Qingxuan, Yu Sheng and Ye Futian followed him. Yi Qingxuan looked back at the boys and winked, as if she was being complacent.The Director's name was Yi Xiang. He brought Ye Futian and Yu Sheng to a garden. The garden was pretty spacious, but there was only a pavilion and a giant tree inside, giving the garden a sense of isolation.\"How much do you know about Donghai Academy?\" Yi Xiang sat down under the tree, so did the young people.\"There are seven schools here, and in fact, each school is an individual clan. The supervisors of these schools run Donghai Academy collaboratively,\" Ye Futian answered.\"You are right. The seven schools grew out of the top level clans in Donghai City. 300 years ago, when Emperor Ye Qing and Donghuang the Great unified this world, they advocated cultivation, demanding that the local governors found academies for this purpose. With this as its background, Donghai Academy became the official site for cultivation in this city. Therefore, to be officially endorsed, neither of the top clans in Donghai City at the time gave up control over this academy. Because this academy was initially run by seven clans, the seven schools were finally formed.\"Yi Xiang started to tell them the history of Donghai Academy. \"Now, each school of Donghai Academy has its own style, which has actually been determined by those clans in the olden times. For example, in the School of Emperor Star, all the elites are mental control sorcerers. In fact, the Art Saint and your master, the Qin Devil, went to that school. It is now considered the most powerful school among the seven. The School of Treasury Star is considered second.\"\"How about this school?\" Ye Futian was curious.\"Martial arts are not valued in this world.\" Yi Xiang looked at Ye Futian and told him, \"In this world, most people believe that sorcerers are more powerful than martial arts practitioners, so cultivators accept sorcery more than our techniques. Even for those who are talented in both, they would major in sorcery. However, in fact, as the cultivators reach certain planes, the power of martial arts will definitely be the same as sorcery, or even stronger. Unfortunately, this is not common knowledge, so this school has been declining for a while. It is really hard for me to find someone with extraordinary martial arts talent in this place. I'm glad Yu Sheng is here. I believe he will make people understand my point in the future.\"\"I've always believed these two classes are equal,\" Ye Futian said. His godfather had told him long ago that hard work differentiated the cultivators, not the class.\"Good.\" Yi Xiang nodded. \"However, Yu Sheng, don't stop improving your mental power. Otherwise, when you are put against those mental control sorcerers from the School of Emperor Star, it will be impossible for you to unleash your power.\"\"I understand,\" Yu Sheng said. He knew that a pure martial arts cultivator could be countered by powerful mental control sorcerers.\"Yu Sheng, your strength and burst are in the top level, but you lack in speed. This garden is where I used to cultivate. You see the rooms over there? That's the bedroom and book collection room. This is where you will live from now on,\" Yi Xiang told them.\"Roger that.\" The boys nodded.\"Look around, and make yourselves feel at home. We need to go, Qingxuan.\" Yi Xiang then left with his daughter. Before the girl left, she showed her fists to the guys as if to say Come on, you can make it!After they left, Ye Futian patted Yu Sheng's shoulder, and said, \"Yu Sheng, you are just one step away from becoming his son-in-law. Do you know that?\"\"Empirically speaking, huh?\" Yu Sheng tried to joke.\"Uh\u2026\" Ye Futian did not know what to say. Soon, he said, \"At least this was a successful experience.\" Then, Ye Futian walked toward one room in the garden. However, moments later, he flew from the room pathetically. He yelled, \"What the heck is this place?\"...\u2026It was a major news that Yu Sheng had been accepted by the Director in the School of Finance Star as a private disciple. People heard that the Director had stopped accepting private disciples for many years, so this exception for Yu Sheng indicated the Director believed Yu Sheng was very talented. Ye Futian would also go there for cultivation.These two troublemakers who had just entered Donghai Academy a short while ago had finally became superstars in the academy.There was also more major news about Zhou Mu, the disciple of the Art Saint. He was admitted into Donghai Academy, and accepted by someone running the School of Emperor Star. Students in Donghai Academy now started to discuss and compare the boys a lot. They believed that even though Ye Futian and Yu Sheng were talented, their background was not as strong as Zhou Mu's. He used to be the disciple of the Art Saint.Soon, it was said that Ye Futian was the disciple of the Qin Devil\u2014the nemesis of Art Saint whose natal spirit had been destroyed.The news also spoke of Ye Futian making a scene in the Luo Palace during the Lord Luo's birthday banquet. He defeated some geniuses from the academy there, but finally got his ass kicked by Zhou Mu.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 63": "Chapter 63: Driving a Wedge Between ThemTranslator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo StudioThe news of Ye Futian being defeated by Zhou Mu spread throughout Donghai Academy. Many students of the Finance Star school were not happy about this. Now that Ye Futian and Yu Sheng were cultivating under the headmaster, and Zhou Mu had entered the School of the Emperor Star, it seemed like the Finance Star school was lacking in comparison to the Emperor Star school. However, Ye Futian and Yu Sheng had no knowledge of any of this. For the past few days, they had been cultivating in the courtyard.At this time, a loud noise sounded. Ye Futian was thrown out of the training room. The wings on his back fluttered, and even though it looked awkward, it allowed him to land safely on his feet rather than on his butt.\"You're able to withstand it for a longer period of time now,\" said someone from behind. Ye Futian turned his head and saw Yu Sheng and Yi Qingxuan chatting under the ancient tree.\"Do you guys even care about how I feel?\" asked Ye Futian.Yu Sheng took one look at him and shook his head. \"No.\"\"This is payback, isn't it?\" Ye Futian glared at Yu Sheng. He walked towards the ancient tree and asked, \"Yi Qingxuan, who created that matrix in the room? My movements have improved a lot over the past couple of days, but the attack from the matrix is still too fast and too strong for me.\"\"I'm not sure either,\" Yi Qingxuan shook her head. \"The purpose of the matrix is to refine your martial arts abilities. The stronger you are, the more Spiritual Qi you can utilize and the stronger the matrix gets. As long as you are able to withstand being in the matrix for a longer period of time every time, it means you're improving.\"\"I'm faster than Yu Sheng, so how come he can withstand it longer than I can?\" Ye Futian asked, a little upset.\"Because he is physically stronger. You rely on the movement of your body more, so the gravity within the matrix has a stronger effect on you,\" explained Yi Qingxuan. Ye Futian nodded, and said, \"After Yu Sheng cultivates in the matrix for a while, he'll be able to swiftly avoid attacks while overcoming the gravity problem. Then, he'll be ever more fearsome than he is now.\"These past days, Ye Futian had been working on refining his movements. In actuality,Ye Futian was not lacking in strength at all. The body refinement methods that EmperorYe Qing passed on to him enabled Ye Futian to refine his body to a monster's level, andthis place was very suitable for him to do so. Furthermore, there was a library containingmany books on battle tactics. He could take a look at those and cultivate accordingly.According to Emperor Ye Qing's body refinement methods, the dragon refined the body,the ape refined strength, and the roc refined speed. These were his personal findings from when he trained demons and monsters. His attack tactics were also learned from the demons and monsters he controlled. Based on Emperor Ye Qing's abilities, he must have been able to exert combat powers on par with a real dragon or a real golden roc. However, Ye Futian had not reached that level yet, and there was a limit to what he could comprehend. All he could do was to speed up the process by cultivating more powerful combat tactics.\"That reminds me! There are some rumors spreading about you at the academy,\" Yi Qingxuan said to Ye Futian.\"What kind of rumors?\" he asked.\"Zhou Mu has been accepted into the School of the Emperor Star. After that, rumors started spreading at Donghai Academy that said we were really arrogant at the Luo Palace, but were eventually defeated by Zhou Mu.\" Yi Qingxuan spoke carefully. She seemed worried for Ye Futian. If the rumors were true, would they hurt his pride?Ye Futian was shocked. \"Did Zhou Mu say this personally?\"\"I think the rumors came from a couple of students at Donghai Academy,\" Yi Qingxuan said gently.Ye Futian shrugged and smiled. \"Looks like someone doesn't really like me.\"\"So, the rumors aren't true?\" Her eyes lit up. Zhou Mu was a five-starred Glory Plane cultivator. Even though Ye Futian was really good, he was still at a lower level than Zhou Mu. Therefore, when Yi Qingxuan heard the rumors, she was not completely sure they were false.\"It couldn't have been Zhou Mu,\" said Ye Futian. It did not seem like he had heard a single word Yi Qingxuan said. \"Are people using this as an opening to bring up the battle between the Art Saint and my master?\" Ye Futian asked her. He already seemed to know the answer to that question.Yi Qingxuan saw how confident he was and smiled. \"Yeah, there were some people talking about that. I'm thinking it's the people from the Flirting Star school who are spreading the topic around, just to piss you off. There are also people who were questioning my father's choice of choosing Yu Sheng as his disciple. Should we try to clear up these misunderstandings? We should let the people of Donghai Academy know that those are all rumors so they will stop misunderstanding you.\"\"If the people are willing to believe that the rumors are true, do you really think they'll change your mind just because you say otherwise?\" Ye Futian laughed and continued, \"You can never stop the mouths of others. Just let them be. One day, they'll know to shut their own mouths.\"\"You seem so nonchalant about this, but if you're so confident, then we'll wait to see all these people eat their words when you defeat Zhou Mu,\" said Yi Qingxuan with a smile.\"Rather than paying attention to these things, I'm more interested in the progress of your relationship with Yu Sheng,\" said Ye Futian. He gave Yin Qingxuan a look and watched as her face grew red. She glared at him and said, \"I don't know what nonsense you're spouting. I'm leaving!\" Afterwards, she took a peek at Yu Sheng before jogging off.\"Oh, Yu Sheng. You have to take initiative!\" laughed Ye Futian.\"I'm going to cultivate now.\" Yu Sheng walked away, headed for the training room.Ye Futian and Yu Sheng immersed themselves in cultivation. Yi Qingxuan would come to visit them often. Once in a while, Yi Qiang would stop by to give Yu Sheng pointers. As for Ye Futian, he was ignored. There was an obvious difference in the way the two were being treated, just like how Hua Fengliu treated Ye Futian and Yu Sheng differently back then. Ye Futian was hurt.One day, Yi Qingxuan came to visit again. \"Ye Futian, Yu Sheng. My father wants me to bring you guys to him,\" she said.\"Okay. Is something wrong?\" asked Ye Futian.\"There are people visiting from the schools of the Emperor Star and the Treasury Star. They said they wanted to congratulate my father on taking on a new disciple.\" Yi Qingxue continued, \"It's proper etiquette to have you guys go greet them.\"The two young men nodded and followed wherever Yi Qingxuan led them to. The trio arrived at the guest hall of the School of the Finance Star. Seated in front of Yi Xiang were two people. They exuded such grace. These two people were from the schools of the Emperor Star and the Treasury Star. Behind each person stood two more people, presumably their students. Ye Futian had met the person from the School of the Emperor Star before. It was the elder he met at the Luo Palace.\"Greetings from Student Ye Futian.\" Ye Futian paid his respects to the two elders with a bow.\"We meet again,\" the elder said. \"I never expected for you to come cultivate under Headmaster Yi Xiang after the events at the Luo Palace. Indeed, you are young and promising.\"\"Thank you, Senior,\" said Ye Futian.\"All those years ago, your master cultivated at the Emperor Star school, how could you go to the Finance Star school? Should I try to demand Headmaster Yi Xiang to pass you on to me?\" the elder laughed.\"You're too funny, Senior.\" Ye Futian smiled weakly.The elder laughed aloud and said, \"Hua Jieyu cultivates at our school. Since you two know each other, you should come visit her when you get a chance.\"Ye Futian was shocked. Since the elder already knew that Ye Futian was the Guqin Devil's disciple, then there was no hiding the fact that he knew Hua Jieyu. If things had come to this, then all he could do was admit it. \"I've been wanting to go visit her, but since she studies up at the main building of the Emperor Star school, I did not want to intrude. But since Senior has extended the offer, I will gladly visit her when I get the chance. I hope it will not be of an inconvenience to you, Senior.\"\"Very good.\" The elder gave Ye Futian a meaningful look.\"Alright now, you youngsters go talk amongst yourselves. I have some things to discuss with Headmaster Yi Xiang.\" The elder smiled. The students standing left the hall along with Ye Futian's little trio.Shu Yuyan was watching Ye Futian the whole time. When the elder told them to leave, she quickly ran to catch up with Ye Futian. \"Wait up!\" she shouted.\"Is there something I can help you with?\" Ye Futian smiled at Shu Yuyan.\"My name is Shu Yuyan. I am Hua Jieyu's best friend,\" she told him. She felt as if she had just uncovered a secret. In the past, Hua Jieyu mentioned that she had someone she liked, but that was before Ye Futian came to Donghai Academy. Hua Jieyu probably had no idea that Ye Futian was going to show up a few days after what she had told Shu Yuyan.After that, Hua Jieyu showed special interest in all things regarding Ye Futian. Shu Yuyan had never cared about the details. It was only when Zhou Mu entered the School of the Emperor Star that she found Hua Jieyu was the daughter of the Guqin Devil, Hua Fengliu. Then, she found out that Ye Futian was the Guqin Devil's disciple. It was obvious that Ye Futian and Hua Jieyu were previously acquainted. When all these findings were added up, Shu Yuyan was able to easily take a guess as to what was going on between the two.She eyed the handsome young man in front of her. This guy who stirred up trouble right after being admitted should be the guy in Hua Jieyu's heart.\"My name is Ye Futian.\" He smiled and continued, \"Is Hua Jieyu doing well?\"\"Yeah,\" Shu Yuyan nodded. She was very curious about Ye Futian. What type of person was this guy who Hua Jieyu was so crazy about? There were so many things she wanted to say right now, but there were others around. Shu Yuyan could tell that Ye Futian and Hua Jieyu wanted to keep their relationship under wraps. So, this was not a good setting to talk about it.\"Are Junior Brother Ye Futian and Hua Jieyu close?\" asked a smiling young man behind Shu Yuyan.\"Hua Jieyu is the beloved daughter of my master, of course we're close.\" Ye Futian took a look at the young man. He was maybe about 18. His sharp eyes made him look extremely menacing.\"Is that so?\" laughed the young man. \"I cultivate with Hua Jieyu at school and talk to her often, but I've never heard her speak about you. In the future, when you get a chance to visit our school, be sure to come look for me,\" the young man said to Ye Futian.\"From Senior Brother Mu Yunxuan's tone, it sounds like he's about to get the girl,\" chuckled another student from the Treasury Star school.\"A girl like Hua Jieyu won't be so easy to get. I still need time, but\u2026\" Mu Yunxuan laughed. \"Forget it, forget it.\"Ye Futian frowned, and Yu Sheng gave Mu Yunxuan a once over.\"Oh! Junior Brother Ye Futian, I heard that you had some conflict with Junior Brother Zhou Mu at the Luo Palace, and now the whole academy knows. You shouldn't care too much though, it just a silly fight. It's not that big of a deal. You'll be able to get over it if you guys get a chance to talk it out,\" continued Mu Yunxuan.\"Alright. I'll definitely 'talk it out' with Zhou Mu when I get a chance.\" Ye Futian smiled.\"Now then, we don't want to keep you for too long. Junior Brother, you guys should head out first, we'll wait here for our teachers,\" said Mu Yunxuan.\"Alright.\" Ye Futian felt no need to be courteous and walked right out with Yu Sheng and Yi Qingxuan. Mu Yunxuan watched as Ye Futian and his friends walked away. The smile gradually disappeared from his face.\"Senior Brother Mu Yunxuan, what was your purpose for saying all that?\" Shu Yuyan asked him. Naturally, she knew he was lying about his relationship with Hua Jieyu. It would not have mattered if Ye Futian and Hua Jieyu did not have any special relationship, but if they did, then Mu Yunxuan's words were meant to drive a wedge between them.\"Shu Yuyan, what was your purpose of catching up with Ye Futian. Has Hua Jieyu mentioned him to you?\" Mu Yunxuan asked.\"I just wanted to say hello since he is an acquaintance of Hua Jieyu. I had no other intentions,\" she said.\"Really now?\" Mu Yunxuan smiled and picked up his feet to walk away.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

All along the way, his eyebrows were knitted.\"Who is he, Qingxuan?\" Ye Futian asked.\"Mu Yunxuan, someone now cultivating separately with the supervisor in the School of Emperor Star, a true genius, currently in Eight-star Glory Plane, and he is a great mental control sorcerer,\" Yi Qingxuan told him. She felt awkward that Mu Yunxuan spoke to Ye Futian like that.\"Mu Yunxuan.\" Ye Futian repeated and remembered this name.Yu Sheng noticed Ye Futian was upset. He looked at Yi Qingxuan, then tried to comfort Ye Futian. \"I believe my sister-in-law is not that kind of girl.\"\"Of course I know my fox is not like that.\" Ye Futian nodded. \"But don't you think Mu Yunxuan is weird? Why did he tell me that intentionally?\"\"Yeah, it is truly weird,\" Yu Sheng agreed.\"It almost feels like he was testing me. He must know something.\" Ye Futian was still mumbling.\"Sister-in-law? Fox?\" Yi Qingxuan's eyes twinkled with a little bit confusion. She could sense that they were talking about Hua Jieyu.\"Qingxuan, remember, this is a secret. Do not tell anyone,\" Yu Sheng told her. They had known each other for a long time, so obviously Yu Sheng considered this girl as one of his best friends, which was why he was discussing these personal issues in her presence.\"Hua Jieyu is my girlfriend,\" Ye Futian explained to Yi Qingxuan.Yi Qingxuan was surprised, then asked doubtfully, \"Really?\"\"Why don't you believe me?\" Ye Futian was upset about Yi Qingxuan's reaction. \"I am such a talented and handsome boy, so why can't my girlfriend be the most gorgeous girl in this academy?\"\"\u2026\" Yi Qingxuan was speechless. After a short silence, she asked Yu Sheng, \"Has he always been such a narcissist?\"\"Yeah,\" Yu Sheng answered.\"Damn.\" Ye Futian heard they were talking about him. \"Come on, bros before h*es. Why would you give me up for a girl?\"The other two were speechless again.\"I do not care if it's a test or not. I'll remember this guy, Mu Yunxuan.\" Thinking of Yunxuan's words, Ye Futian smiled. The smile indicated something, and Yu Sheng knew that some serious revenge on that name was on its way.After they went back to the garden, Yi Xiang was already waiting for them. He looked at Ye Futian and told him, \"Come see me.\" Ye Futian did not know what happened. He nodded and followed Yi Xiang into the room.\"You caused some trouble at Luo Palace, didn't you?\" Yi Xiang asked.\"That was even before I came here. In fact, I met Qingxuan right after I came back from Luo Palace,\" Ye Futian explained. \"And I was not there to make trouble.\"\"You were going to ask Lord Luo to cure your professor?\" Yi Xiang asked. Ye Futian nodded.\"That was really unwise. Do you have any idea what you did?\" Yi Xiang sounded cold. \"You should feel lucky that you are someone insignificant, so that people in that place did not kill you since they had to save their reputation. Otherwise, you would have been dead by now. Do you know the relationship between the Art Saint, Lord Luo, and the School of Emperor Star?\"Ye Futian was shocked and confused. He said, \"I only knew the Art Saint also used to attend the School of Emperor Star after meeting you, Mr. Yi.\"\"No wonder you are the disciple of Hua Fengliu. You just share the exact same self-righteousness.\" Yi Xiang seemed angry. \"Do you know why your professor's natal spirit was destroyed and why he was banished?\"\"I only know that Mr. Hua was defeated by the Art Saint, and was evicted from Donghai City by the Art Saint and the Nandou family,\" Ye Futian said.\"What if he beat the Art Saint? Would it have been any better? No. His tragedy was destined since the moment he decided to pursue the princess of Nandou Family,\" Yi Xiang told him. \"Both the School of Emperor Star and the Nandou family tactically planned the political marriage between the Art Saint and the daughter of the Nandou family. All the powerful people in these clans would benefit from this marriage. Your professor just cut in and ruined everything for them. What was he thinking? That a pretty face was everything?\"The Director stared at Ye Futian as he spoke. Ye Futian felt somewhat awkward. He believed that no matter how badly the Director did not like his professor, it was not Futian's fault that he was handsome.\"He even knocked up that girl, and they had a child. He was lucky to get out of this city alive.\"Ye Futian believed Yi Xiang was still lingering on this. He did not understand why the hatred was so serious. Was it because of Ms. Tang?\"Is there anything else between the Art Saint and the School of Emperor Star?\" Ye Futian kept asking.\"There is something that people rarely know, and I know only some details about it. The Art Saint might have some relation to Prime Minister Hua,\" Yi Xiang answered. \"He is one of the two Prime Ministers in the Nation of Nandou in charge of military force. Now, he is definitely the most powerful person in this nation. He had graduated from the School of Emperor Star and is now considered a strong backer of this school now.\"\"So, the parties that would benefit from this political marriage were the Nandou family and Prime Minister Hua?\" Ye Futian gradually understood.\"I'm afraid Hua Fengliu did not know the seriousness involved in this marriage, nor did he have any idea the School of Emperor Star had a role in this play. So, do you understand now, that your professor brought this upon himself?\" Yi Xiang kept saying, \"As for you, you went to the Luo Palace alone. You know what? Almost all the people there wanted to kill you at that time.\"Ye Futian's mind was running fast, and he started to think about many things. Soon, he asked, \"Then, why is Hua Jieyu cultivating in the School of Emperor Star?\"\"Because Prime Minister Hua is so powerful now, I guess the Nandou family is trying to rebuild their relationship with the School of Emperor Star, so they sent Hua Jieyu to this school. As for why she agreed to come, I believe, besides the Nandou family's intentions, the other reason would be your grandmaster. She is now cultivating with your grandmaster. He is a respected old man, however\u2026\" Yi Xiang sighed.\"My grandmaster?\" Ye Futian was surprised.\"She is a true beauty, and I guess she's your girlfriend, am I right? You sly boy.\" Yi Xiang saw through him. Ye Futian did not know how he could guess so accurately.\"You are doing the exact same thing your professor did in the past. So, just to be kind, mind your manners with others, especially when you are outside the academy. I don't want you to be the next Hua Fengliu, and do not jeopardize the future of my disciple.\" Yi Xiang left after he finished. Ye Futian finally realized that he told him all that just to protect Yu Sheng. He turned around, then looked at Yu Sheng and Yi Qingxuan. Somehow, he suddenly felt sad.However, Yi Xiang's eyebrows knitted, as if he was really preoccupied. The visit from the School of Emperor Star and the School of Treasury Star made him feel like something unusual was going to happen. Since Prime Minister Hua gained power, the School of Emperor Star was becoming more and more greedy over the controlling position of Donghai Academy. The peace of this academy would be broken soon....\u2026Several days later, students in the School of Emperor Star were spreading the word that Hua Jieyu became Mu Yunxuan's girlfriend. The news was a serious sensation. As the number one beauty of this academy, Hua Jieyu naturally attracted the attention of many boys there. They could not believe that she was someone else's girlfriend. Even though it was Mu Yunxuan, the genius of the School of Emperor Star, the boys still felt hurt.Ye Futian also heard the word, and became even more confused. What was Mu Yunxuan trying to do, and why was the School of Emperor Star trying so hard to circulate this rumor?Even though he did not take the news seriously, as time went by, the rumors spread further, and he started to feel so upset that even Yu Sheng and Yi Qingxuan could clearly feel it.Hua Jieyu also heard. When Shu Yuyan went back that day, she told Hua Jieyu exactly how Mu Yunxuan tried to agitate Ye Futian. To avoid any possible controversy about her relationship with Ye Futian, she did not say a word to stop the rumor. She was worried that after the Nandou family found out they were together, Ye Futian would be in trouble.However, as the rumors became worse, she finally decided to do something.\u00a0She went to find Mu Yunxuan, but this boy had disappeared from campus. She tried to leave the School of Emperor Star to find Ye Futian and explain, but she found herself being stalked when she was not in the room. She felt as if someone was plotting against her.In her dorm, Hua Jieyu was standing\u00a0in front of the window, overlooking the entire campus. She asked, \"Yuyan, will he misunderstand me?\"\"If he really knows you, he will not,\" Shu Yuyan said.\"Rumors can kill, especially when so many people are spreading them. It almost sounds like the truth. Even if he believes me, as far as I know, his personality will make him seriously depressed. Plus, I cannot go to him and explain.\" Hua Jieyu sighed. \"I truly don't want him to get hurt.\"\"The School of Emperor Star is obviously spreading the rumor intentionally. I think they are already suspicious about your relationship, so we cannot explain anything now. Otherwise, you would admit that something is going on between you two,\" Shu Yuyan told her.\"That is why I'm conflicted,\" Hua Jieyu mumbled. Shu Yuyan stood next to her silently. She could clearly feel Hua Jieyu's agony.Meanwhile, in another place, two men were talking. They were the old man from the School of Emperor Star that Ye Futian met in the banquet, and Nandou Ku.\"Nandou family promised that Hua Jieyu would not be used for any political marriage. However, with the rumors going on, I'm afraid what Xia Fan said should be true,\" the old man told Nandou Ku.\"We have not confirmed anything yet. That boy is the disciple of the Qin Devil, so it is natural that he and Hua Jieyu have a good relationship,\" Nandouku said.\"Details tell more than words. I think this princess of your family is going to replay history, especially since the boy in this story is the disciple of the Qin Devil. How ironic,\" the old man jeered.\"I will inform my family to take care of this. Besides, Jieyu is still young. Even if there is really something going on between those two, they will forget about it shortly,\" Nandou Ku said.\"Then tell your family to mind their own business, and do not let history repeat itself. Ye Futian is now cultivating with Yi Xiang. Even though only few people know the truth of that fight, Yi Xiang might be one of them. He knows so many secrets about the School of Emperor Star. It would be intolerable if the geniuses from Donghai Academy actually go against our school in the future. You better take care of it.\" He left right after he finished talking, looking obviously pissed off.Nandou Ku, however, felt nervous. What was happening now truly resembled the past so much. Previously, Nandou family had noticed that something was going on, but had been hesitant to take action. They finally made a huge mistake, which they could never compensate for.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 65": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Legend of FutianCH 65Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayRecently, Ye Futian had been in a consistently bad mood. He cultivated his martial arts skills like crazy, and was now able to withstand the matrix in the training room for longer periods of time. Thus, breaking past the four-starred Glory Plane in martial arts. However, he had yet to break through for sorcery. To cultivate Spiritual Energy, a sorcerer needs a tranquil mind. However, his mind was anything but tranquil at that time.Rumors were still flooding Donghai Academy as usual. On this day, a group of people mounted on different creatures stepped into the academy. This caused a large ruckus on campus. The leader of the group was actually a young woman, dressed in a long red dress, the color of fire. She stood on a majestic creature, the same color as her dress. She was a blooming beauty, unparalleled by anybody else. Just standing there, she looked elegant, her eyes bright and piercing.\"I heard Donghai Academy is the best place for cultivation in all of the East Sea Prefecture. There should be a lot of students here on the same level as me, so I came to check it out,\" said the young woman. Her tone was menacing as she looked around at the students of Donghai Academy.After that, her group continued to travel deeper into the academy. More and more people gathered and wondered who these people might be. How come the authorities of the academy hadn't come out to stop them?In a flash, the young woman hopped off the creature she was riding on. As she stood in the crowd, she asked in a cold demeanor, \"Is there no one at Donghai Academy?\"\"What level are you at?\" asked a student.\"Five-starred Glory Plane,\" replied the young woman.\"I'll oblige,\" said a young man about 17. He looked at the young woman and introduced himself, \"Li Yan, five-starred Glory Plane Sorcerer. Please enlighten me.\" As he finished speaking, a large force of Metal Spiritual Qi was released. A bright, big, golden bird took shape and came for the girl like a flash of lightning.Around the girl, Fire Spiritual Qi gathered crazily. It also formed a big bird, but this was a mystical phoenix. It carried an outrageous burst of flame, and collided with the big golden bird, causing the golden bird to disappear into the flames. The phoenix did not stop there.The look on Li Yan's face changed as he stepped back. He saw the phoenix head straight for him. He shut his eyes tight, and felt the heat of the flames radiate onto his body. But then, the phoenix stopped. It stood right in front of Li Yan, and the Fire Spiritual Qi which had formed the phoenix disappeared.\"Too weak,\" said the young woman. \"Is this what the best of the East Sea Prefecture has got?\"The students of Donghai Academy felt humiliated. Another person stepped up, but the results were about the same\u2014one attack from her and her opponent was defeated.Students continued to step forward, but it always ended in the same way.\"Mu Yunqing, five-starred Glory Plane, Mandate Sorcerer.\" Mu Yunqing of the School of the Flirting Star stepped out. He released his Natal spirit, a golden eagle. He leveled up planes a short while ago and was now more powerful. Observing the young woman's beautiful face and her outstanding gifts, Mu Yunqing could not help but fantasize.The wind enveloped him, and Mu Yunqing turned into a creature. With extreme speed, he charged at the young woman. When his sorcery kicked in, a bright golden light was emitted from his body, and dissolved the wild flames. He chuckled to himself with new-found confidence. However, the young woman moved her body and also became enveloped in a gust of wind. Her movements were elegant, but also extremely fast, faster than Mu Yunqing. In a split second, the distance between the two drew closer. Bystanders could only see a fire red blur flash by. A loud noise sounded, and Mu Yunqing flew through the air, and landed on the floor.The young woman's feet met the ground once again. The already astounding young woman seemed so carefree. She had a pair of fire red wings on her back. Even her fists were the color of fire. After touching ground, the tinge of red disappeared.\"What a weak Mandate Sorcerer,\" said the young woman. Mu Yunqing looked pale as he crawled up off the ground. He realized the young woman did not even bother to spare him a glance. His heart cooled. After Ye Futian entered Donghai Academy, this was already his third consecutive loss.When word spread that there was a battle going on, more and more people arrived to watch. While wondering about her identity, people were also shocked at her power.Students of the seven schools were also participating in the battle now, but they were all cultivators of the five-starred Glory Plane. They did not want to bully the beautiful girl as they were cultivators of higher levels, but slowly they realized that people on the same level as the young woman were all losing. It seemed like no one was able to even bring out her full potential.That was until a very well-known young man from the School of the Ruinous Star made his move. This time, the young woman took it seriously. A shield of flames surrounded her, and a Flame Phoenix appeared. It was her Life Spirit. At this moment, the young woman seemed even more impressive. Mandate Sorcerer with a Flame Phoenix Spirit. A Wind and Fire bi-elemental cultivator in both martial arts and sorcery.\"She's so beautiful.\" Someone couldn't help but stare in awe. The only girl that would be able to compete with her was Hua Jieyu of the School of the Emperor Star. Hua Jieyu was also extremely gifted. But she was introverted and kept a low profile. She might not be willing to fight. Plus, there were a lot of rumors revolving around her. She seemed to be in love.The young cultivator of the Ruinous Star school was also defeated. After that, more people took up the young woman's challenge, but none of them were victorious. Regardless of natural talent, sorcery or battle tactics, she was very strong.\"A Flame Phoenix Spirit. I wonder who is stronger, the Flame Phoenix Spirit or Ye Futian's Roc Spirit,\" someone whispered in the crowd. The phoenix and the roc were both mystical birds. The former was Wind and Fire bi-elemental, the latter was Wing and Metal bi-elemental.Something sparked in the young woman's eyes. She found the person whispering in the crowd and asked, \"There's someone at Donghai Academy who possesses a Roc Spirit?\"That person was shocked. The young woman's ears were so sharp that she had overheard them whisper?\"Yeah, a genius from the School of the Finance Star, Ye Futian.\"\"How are his abilities?\" the young woman continued questioning.\"A while ago, he was in the three-starred Glory Plane. I don't know about now, but his combat abilities are very strong. He can even defeat a five-starred Glory Plane cultivator,\" the person explained. Since Ye Futian was able to battle with Zhou Mu, he had to be very capable.\"He level is too low, but I want to see the Roc Spirit. Go get him from the School of the Finance Star!\" she ordered her people. The people behind her nodded and immediately set off to do her bidding.This scene surprised a lot of people. She was so bossy and arrogant. She was just going to send her people to the Finance Star school and grab Ye Futian? What they did not know was that they really managed to find Ye Futian at the school, and what's more, the person who found him was Headmaster Yi Xiang.\"Someone wants to challenge me?\" Ye Futian was in a foul mood to begin with. After a sigh, he said, \"Not interested.\"Yi Xiang glared at him, \"Even if you're not interested you must go. Do you really think that I would come to you personally if any ordinary person challenged you?\"Ye Futian froze, then asked, \"Who challenged me?\"\"Go see for yourself,\" said Yi Xiang. With no way out, Ye Futian answered, \"Fine.\"Ye Futian, Yu Sheng, and Yi Qingxuan followed Yi Xiang as he walked to the place where the young woman was waiting. When they arrived, the area was already packed with people. Ye Futian, Yu Sheng, and Yi Qingxuan pushed through the crowd and were finally able to see the young woman in red. She was currently fighting someone. The Flame Phoenix behind her was very eye-catching. Very quickly, she defeated her opponent.\"Ye Futian.\" When the people noticed Ye Futian, they began whispering amongst themselves. The young woman turned her attention to him.\"Your Life Spirit is a roc?\" she asked him. Ye Futian looked at her strangely and simply said, \"A woman.\"The young woman frowned and asked, \"What do you mean by that?\"\"I don't want to hit a woman,\" Ye Futian said and turned to leave. What happened last time with the sword-wielding young lady had traumatized him.\"Hold it!\" she yelled. \"Did I say you could leave?\"Ye Futian stood frozen in place. This young woman seemed very arrogant, and it was Yi Xiang who told him to come. What was this young woman's identity?He turned to speak with her again. \"Anything is fair game in combat. You have such a pretty face, I wouldn't want to accidentally hurt you. Let's not fight.\"The crowd was dripping in cold sweat by now. Ye Futian would always be Ye Futian\u2014arrogant.\"Nonsense!\" The young woman laughed. \"Hurt me? Can you even manage?\"\"Uh...\" Ye Futian was speechless. Did all females talk like this? He could not take it anymore.\"Yu Sheng!\" shouted Ye Futian. After a short while, he realized that no one was answering to him. When he turned around, he saw Yu Sheng chatting with Yi Qingxuan.Ye Futian had no words. \"Best friends,\" he muttered under his breath. He could only count on himself now. He walked forward and saw the young woman smiling at him in a cold demeanor.\"Release your Life Spirit, or else you won't get a chance to later on,\" she said arrogantly.Ye Futian let out a sigh and released the bright Roc Spirit. She also released her Flame Phoenix Spirit. The bright light emitted from both of the Life Spirits was blinding. Would Ye Futian be able to win against this insanely gifted young woman?BOOM! A force of fire sorcery gathered and formed a fire phoenix, charging at Ye Futian.A golden light surrounded Ye Futian, an endless amount of Metal Spiritual Qi gathered on his wings. His wings joined together and created a shield in front of Ye Futian's body, allowing the fire phoenix to attack as it pleased.WHOOSH! His wings opened abruptly, and the wild flames dissipated. In the blink of an eye, Ye Futian was gone, leaving a flash of lightning behind. The young woman could see a blurred figure rushing towards her. The Flame Phoenix and the Golden Roc kept getting closer to one another.Both Ye Futian and the young woman were lifted into the sky and brought closer together. The young woman threw a fiery punch accompanied by what sounded like the cry of a phoenix. Ye Futian also reached out his palm, accompanied by a dragon's roar.In the next moment, the people watched as the two of them battled in the sky. Cries and roars filled the skies, the Fire and Metal Spiritual Qi flowed wildly.BOOM! BOOM! Two loud noises sounded. Then the people saw the young woman fall from the sky and land harshly on the ground. Her guards ran to her side.A lean and handsome middle-aged man also descended from the sky. After this person's appearance, many of the authoritative figures of Donghai Academy stepped forward. Even Yi Xiang was there. All of them bowed to this man.\"Greetings, Minister Zuo,\" all of them greeted the man. The students of Donghai Academy looked confused. Minister Zuo?At this moment, the young woman got up from the ground with a hand on her chest. This immediately attracted everyone's attention. All they saw was the young woman looking up at the sky where Ye Futian was floating and screamed, \"You shameless jerk!\"\"I...\" Ye Futian was completely speechless. How did things turn out like this again?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Last time he beat a girl, he was insulted for not being a man. Now, he was being a shameless jerk? Why couldn't they just challenge normally?Beside Yu Sheng, Yi Qingxuan thought of what happened last time and snorted. Glancing at where the girl's hand was and then looking at Ye Futian, she said, \"You've crossed the line.\"\"I said anything is fair in combat and didn't want to fight but you insisted,\" Ye Futian explained logically.The girl glared at him. Obviously, it was useless to talk about logic with women.\"Professor, I want him,\" the girl said to the scholarly middle-aged man.\"Huh?\" Ye Futian was confused. He looked at the girl strangely and said, \"I have a girlfriend.\"The girl was confused as well. Then understanding what Ye Futian meant, her expression changed drastically. \"You\u2026are so shameless.\"Minister Zuo, referred to as \"Professor\" by the girl cleared his throat. \"You used the wrong words.\"The girl froze. Thinking back to how she said \"I want him,\" she realized it really was easy to misunderstand but she didn't care. She whined, \"Professor, you know what I mean.\"\"Stubborn.\" Minister Zuo gave her a look, then turned back to Ye Futian. \"What's your name?\"\"Minister, I am Ye Futian,\" he bowed and said. \"Minister, your disciple challenged me.\"\"I know.\" Minister Zuo nodded. \"Very good, your spells and strength are both extremely strong. You didn't even use battle techniques. She isn't at your level.\"\"How can you say that?\" The girl looked at her professor, wounded.\"It's the truth,\" Minister Zuo said. \"He's in a lower plane than you. Now you know there are many talented people out there. This is just one school in East Sea Prefecture. Don't be so arrogant in the future.\"At this time, Xia Fan walked out of the crowd to Minister Zuo's side. He looked at Ye Futian coldly and murmured something into the Minister's ears.Minister Zuo was taken aback and glanced at Ye Futian in shock.Ye Futian was suspicious. Xia Fan's eyes were cold and he was probably plotting against him.\"Ye Futian, come here,\" Minister Zuo said. The boy nodded and walked over.\"I came this time about Qingzhou City's relics,\" Minister Zuo said to him. \"I heard from Xia Fan that someone in Donghai Academy had come out of it alive so I wanted to take a look. I didn't expect to run into you. Are you willing to come with me? Don't worry, I will do everything to protect your safety.\"Ye Futian's eyes flashed. It was about Emperor Ye Qing's relics again. Qingzhou City was subordinate to the East Sea Prefecture. Since the appearance of Emperor Ye Qing's relics was such big news, the East Sea Prefecture obviously had to report to the Nandou Nation. It was natural for them to send someone over too. However, if Xia Fan did this voluntarily, he probably wanted to kill Ye Futian. After all, he knew what Mount Tianyao had. But Xia Fan's plan would most likely fail. How would the Snow Ape treat him in Mount Tianyao?\"Minister, a demon lord protects Emperor Ye Qing's statue on Mount Tianyao. It is really powerful. Even if you are skilled, it would still be dangerous. It's pure luck that I survived,\" Ye Futian warned.\"I understand but the emperor commanded this. I have to go take a look.\" Minister Zuo nodded. \"I've already sent someone to scope out the path. When he returns, we will leave. I will have you stay with me.\"Ye Futian pretended to be uncomfortable. Then he very unwillingly nodded. \"If there's any danger, please remember to retreat.\"\"Don't worry.\" Minister Zuo patted Ye Futian's shoulder. Ye Futian sighed inwardly. He didn't expect to return to Qingzhou City so soon. He could only go ask the Snow Ape if she would come out or not.\"What are you talking about?\" the girl came up and asked.\"I was convincing him to accept your request. He accepted now,\" Minister Zuo said.The girl smirked and looked at Ye Futian proudly. \"Good, you know your place. You're mine now.\"Ye Futian was upset. Looking at her, he said, \"You're pretty but I really do have a girlfriend, and she's prettier than you.\"\"Jerk.\" The girl was pissed.The Minister said, \"Okay, princess, we should go.\" Then he said to the people of Donghai Academy, \"Thank you for your time.\"\"You're welcome, Minister. Won't you stay a few more days?\" the big chiefs tried to keep him longer.\"No, I'm living in the Xia House.\" Minister Zuo shook his head. He was the minister of Nandou Nation and the East Sea Prefecture was under him. He naturally lived at the Xia House.\"I will come get you when we leave,\" he said to Ye Futian. Then he led the people away. While leaving, the girl glared at Ye Futian. The boy shrugged helplessly. Was she trying to scare him? Well, the tides would turn at Mount Tianyao.After Minister Zuo left, many people of Donghai Academy glanced at Ye Futian. This guy was such a pervert. Multiple disciples had failed against the girl but he squashed her so quickly and was praised by the Minister. The big chiefs stared at Ye Futian deeply. Would he be favored by Minister Zuo?The crowd scattered gradually. Yi Qingxuan walked over and smiled at him. \"You're doomed. People will remember you now.\"\"It's hard to have such good looks,\" Ye Futian sighed.Qingxuan glared at him and said, \"You clearly hit somewhere you shouldn't have. You crossed the line.\"\"It's a battle. How would I know?\" Ye Futian said innocently.\"Who knows if you did that on purpose or not,\" Yi Qingxuan teased with a smile.\"You know too much,\" Yu Sheng said from the side.Ye Futian stared at them and sighed. \"Yu Sheng, you've changed.\"\"Learned from you,\" Yu Sheng said. Ye Futian could only heave a sigh.\"Let's go,\" Yi Xiang called.Ye Futian ran up and said, \"Headmaster, I remember you mentioned before that Minister Hua and Minister Zuo are rivals. Is it this Minister Zuo?\"\"Yes,\" Yi Xiang nodded. \"Now you know why I couldn't reject him.\"\"Aren't you unethical to sell me out like this?\" Ye Futian was frustrated. \"What if something happens to me?\"\"You aren't my disciple. You have nothing to do with me.\" Yi Xiang glanced at Ye Futian.Ye Futian blinked, speechless.\"You said that you have a girlfriend. Is it Hua Jieyu?\" Yi Xiang asked.\"How did you know?\" Ye Futian looked at him.\"Huh, you think you're the only smart one? The School of Emperor Star aren't idiots either. Mu Yunxuan and Hua Jieyu's rumors were to test you two. They probably guessed your relationship already,\" Yi Xiang said.\"So what?\" Ye Futian said nonchalantly. He had been annoyed these days and he was thinking about when to announce this news. The rumors pissed him off.\"You seem easy and free. Where do you get the confidence?\" Yi Xiang asked.\"I have you,\" Ye Futian looked up and said.Yi Xiang glanced at him. He could not refute it. \"Minister Zuo has power and His Majesty trusts him greatly. If you can become acquainted with him, the Nandou family might consider you.\"Ye Futian was frustrated. Emperor Ye Qing and his godfather both said that he would become an emperor but now he needed Nandou to consider him? What a tragedy.\"I'll take you to the School of the Emperor Star as compensation,\" Yi Xiang suddenly said.Ye Futian was shocked. He quickly smiled. \"You're the best.\"\"Get out.\" Yi Xiang rolled his eyes. \"I'm taking you to see the senior of the School, your grandmaster, not your girlfriend.\"\"I know.\" Ye Futian's expression was understanding. Yi Xiang did not want to talk to him anymore....\u2026The next day, Yi Xiang took Ye Futian to meet a senior of the School of the Emperor Star. Yi Xiang was the headmaster of the School of the Finance Star. He was equal status to the headmaster of the School of the Emperor Star so he could not be stopped. Yi Xiang and Ye Futian entered and walked toward a pavilion.Inside the School, Hua Jieyu heard from Shu Yuyan about what happened yesterday. She looked wronged and said, \"He really agreed, that jerk, jerk\u2026\"\"He probably agreed because of Minister Zuo. He couldn't reject him,\" Shu Yuyan said softly.\"Is she pretty?\" Hua Jieyu asked.\"Yes.\" Shu Yuyan nodded. \"But not as pretty as you.\"\"That guy likes pretty girls. He must've done it on purpose.\" Hearing that the girl was pretty, Hua Jieyu felt even worse. She said quietly, \"There are so many rumors about me but I didn't go see him. Did he get angry and fall for someone else?\"\"Stop thinking nonsense.\" Shu Yuyan looked at Hua Jieyu and sighed inwardly. Even goddesses could panic like this. She was in too deep.\"You don't know him. If he promised to leave with that girl, she definitely likes him. He's so lustful that he won't be able to resist her charms.\" Hua Jieyu was worried.\"Is he that charismatic?\" Shu Yuyan was speechless but Hua Jieyu nodded seriously.\"Is Elder Qin here?\" A voice traveled over. Hua Jieyu and Shu Yuyan looked up and saw two figures standing outside the yard.The speaker was Yi Xiang. Hua Jieyu's eyes landed on the handsome youth behind Yi Xiang. Her eyes focused there and saw the boy blink at her.\"Greeting, Headmaster Yi. Grandmaster is here,\" Hua Jieyu said.Shu Yuyan also bowed. She smiled at Hua Jieyu and left.\"I am here to see Elder Qin,\" Yi Xiang said. Hua Jieyu nodded and led the way. Ye Futian followed.\"Stop pretending. Go say what you want to say and then come find me,\" Yi Xiang said. He then walked away. Ye Futian looked at his back, realizing the man was pretty loving.\"Why are you looking at me like that?\" Ye Futian looked at Hua Jieyu with a smile. He saw that her eyes were slightly red. Jieyu dragged Ye Futian into a room.Closing the door, Hua Jieyu studied him. \"You went to the Luo palace?\"\"Yeah.\" Ye Futian nodded.\"Don't believe the rumors. I have nothing to do with Mu Yunxuan,\" Hua Jieyu said, feeling wronged.\"I know.\" Ye Futian smiled and nodded.Hua Jieyu stepped forward. She extended her slim arms and lightly hugged Ye Futian. She raised her head. Ye Futian looked at the shocking beauty before him. Those eyes were filled with emotions. He could faintly see a teardrop in the glittering eyes. She was so beautiful he lost his breath.\"Kiss me!\" a dreamy voice said, almost melting Ye Futian's heart!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His heart was beating like crazy. To reciprocate her gesture, he reached out his arms around her waist. Then, he lowered his lips until they met hers. They were both a little awkward at this. Some time later, they separated.Hua Jieyu bit her lip, her crystal-clear eyes were enchanting. \"I'm yours now, so you have to take responsibility for me,\" Hua Jieyu said to Ye Futian as she gazed into his eyes.\"Uh...\" Ye Futian blinked.\"What do you mean by that? Are you trying to refuse?\" she glared at him.Ye Futian's heart skipped a beat looking at her angry face. He said, \"Since you're mine, then let's have another go at it.\" After he finished his words, he pulled Hua Jieyu close and they were immersed in each other once again. Hua Jieyu's eyes closed, her face redder than before, but she felt warm in her heart. This time as well, they took a while to separate from each other.Hua Jieyu looked at Ye Futian with a bit of resentment. Suddenly, she asked, \"Can you not go?\"\"Not go?\" Ye Futian was confused.\"That girl from yesterday,\" said Hua Jieyu. Ye Futian froze for a moment, then chuckled as he looked at his girlfriend. She was jealous.\"Minister Zuo's orders. I can't reject,\" he said.\"Then you have to promise not to fall for her, even if she tries to seduce you,\" Hua Jieyu told him. Ye Futian was speechless. He never knew women could be so jealous. But it warmed his heart.\"She looks nowhere as good as good as my Fox. Why would I fall for her?\" he asked.Hua Jieyu felt proud, but continued to say, \"Even if she did look better than me you can't fall for her!\"\"Alright, I only like you,\" Ye Futian nodded.Only then did Hua Jieyu let out a satisfied smile. Her smile was so bright and beautiful. Ye Futian fell for her all over again. After being seduced today, he has lost all his will-power against her.\"I know you're always thinking of father, but can't you save revenge for after you become stronger and more powerful? I don't want to see you in danger,\" she said.\"I'm fine now, aren't I?\" Ye Futian knew she was talking about what happened at the Luo Palace.\"I think they know about our relationship,\" Hua Jieyu sounded very down. She was worried that they would try to harm Ye Futian.\"They were going to find out sooner or later, but how dare they create all those false rumors. I just want to tell the whole world that you're mine,\" said Ye Futian.\"Gloater.\" Hua Jieyu stared charmingly at Ye Futian. \"Will you marry me in the future?\"\"Of course! I already said, you belong to me,\" answered Ye Futian.\"Then I'll wait for you.\" Hua Jieyu smiled gently and said, \"Promise that you'll never give up no matter how hard it gets.\"\"I promise.\" He nodded. \"Why don't we do want Master and Mistress did? Let's jump the gun and do what can't be undone.\"Hua Jieyu's face paled then reddened. She stared at Ye Futian timidly, and laughed lightly. \"You wish.\"\"With you acting like this, it's hard to resist.\" Ye Futian sighed. The two of them were still in a tight embrace. Hua Jieyu blinked a couple of times then let go. \"You got lucky today. Headmaster Yi Xiang is still waiting for you. Let's go meet the grandmaster.\"\"Okay.\" Ye Futian looked at the captivating young woman in front of his eyes and thought to himself, There's tons of time in the future.The couple stepped out of the room and were walking shoulder to shoulder when Hua Jieyu warned him again. \"Don't forget, no flirting with other girls!\"\"I got it,\" replied Ye Futian. How worried was she?\"And also, be careful for your safety. If something happens to you, I'm marrying someone else. You have to think about this carefully,\" she said.\"How can you do this to me?\" Ye Futian was speechless. He never thought she would threaten him like this.\"Why can't I?\" Hua Jieyu looked smug. She then said, \"This way, you'll know to cherish yourself.\"\"I got it, I got it. Before we do the deed that can't be undone, I won't let myself die,\" said Ye Futian. Hua Jieyu reached for his waist and pinched down hard.The two of them reached a courtyard. In the courtyard, Yi Xiang was chatting with an elderly man. The elder had a full head of white hair, which made him look very old, but while he chatted with Yi Xiang, one could tell from his smile and his eyes that he was kind.Ye Futian approached the elder and bowed. \"Greetings, Grandmaster.\"The elderly man looked up at Ye Futian, and said in a friendly tone, \"Hua Jieyu has told me about you. Here, come sit.\"\"Okay.\" Ye Futian nodded and sat down next to the elderly man.\"Hua Jieyu told me that she didn't manage to learn any of her father's guqin skills because they were all passed down to you. Is that true?\" the elder asked Ye Futian.\"Yes. Master has taught me many musical spells,\" said Ye Futian.\"Come and play a random song for me,\" said the elder. Next to him was a guqin.Ye Futian walked over to sit down behind the guqin, and the aura around him changed as soon as he laid his fingers on the instrument. The peaceful sounds of the guqin flooded the courtyard. It was quiet and peaceful, seemingly able to calm one's heart. There were no other sounds in the courtyard aside from the guqin. The mood that it set up enabled all worries to be tossed to the back of one's mind.Ye Futian finished the piece and the courtyard remained quiet. The elder gave Ye Futian a smile as he reminisced about the past. The way he looked at Ye Futian was even friendlier than before.\"Hua Jieyu told me that it hasn't even been a full year since you learned to play the guqin from Hua Fengliu. You are even more gifted than he was. However, Yi Xiang says that your Life Spirit is a Golden Roc, but at the Luo Palace you used musical sorcery. Could it be that the Spirit element is hidden within this Life Spirit?\"Ye Futian looked at Yi Xiang and Hua Jieyu. Yi Xiang seemed to understand what Ye Futian's gaze meant, and said, \"Elder Qin sacrificed a lot for your master in the past. He spent all his time exploring the way of the guqin and is a true master of the guqin. He gave everything he had to teach your master, but in the end...\" Yi Xiang did not continue but Ye Futian understood.\"Grandmaster is not like the other people in the School of the Emperor Star,\" said Hua Jieyu.Ye Futian nodded lightly. Looking into the elder's kind eyes, a bright light radiated from Ye Futian's body, and a guqin appeared in the air behind him, then slowly disappeared.\"Twin spirits,\" said Yi Xiang. He shuddered. When he heard that Ye Futian had crashed the celebration at the Luo Palace and fought with musical sorcery, he knew immediately that Ye Futian had an extraordinary gift. He seemed to be good at everything, regardless it be Spirit Elemental or martial arts and sorcery, but seeing the twin spirits, he still could not help but feel shocked.\"Good, very good! Hua Fengliu picked a good disciple.\" The elder's voice deepened and he said, \"I can't believe that at my old age, just before I die, I am able to pass down the torch. Yi Xiang, I would like to keep Ye Futian here with me for a few days. You wouldn't mind, right?\"\"Not at all,\" answered Yi Xiang. He turned to Ye Futian and Hua Jieyu, \"I'm afraid if I leave alone, the people of the School of the Emperor Star will take notice. They're already suspicious of your relationship. This will only strengthen their suspicions.\"\"If you guessed it, then they probably have as well. They're not stupid. They even spread false rumors to test us. They're going to find out anyway, so just let it be.\" Ye Futian looked to Hua Jieyu and told her, \"One day, I'll make sure all of Donghai Academy knows.\"\"If you're willing to take the risk, then I don't have anything to say. Elder Qin, I am just disturbing you guys,\" said Yi Xiang.Ye Futian watched as he left and said, \"Headmaster Yi knew that I specialized in musical sorcery and purposely brought me here to you, Grandmaster.\"\"Yi Xiang is honest and loyal, unlike the School of the Emperor Star. They've changed.\" The elder shook his head and said to Hua Jieyu, \"Child, go bring me all my music score books.\"\"Okay.\" Hua Jieyu nodded and left for a little while. When she returned, she had an armful of score books.\"Give them all to Ye Futian, so he can familiarize himself with them,\" said the elder. Hua Jieyu nodded again and handed the books over to Ye Futian.Ye Futian looked really serious when he took over the books. He knew what this meant. Hua Fengliu's powers had been rid of. Grandmaster was now handing down everything he was supposed to hand down to Hua Fengliu to him instead.\"You stay here and learn from Grandmaster, I'm leaving first,\" said Hua Jieyu. Ye Futian lightly nodded and began to look through the score books.Hua Jieyu returned to her own dorm, and not long after, the people of the Emperor Star school came for her. An elder asked her, \"Headmaster Yi Xiang left alone, did Ye Futian stay here with you?\"\"Grandmaster wanted him to stay and learn to play the guqin. If you guys need anything, go ask Grandmaster,\" said Hua Jieyu coldly. The people from the school shared a look and headed to Elder Qin's residence.Hua Jieyu watched as they left, her expression peaceful as ever. Now that the secret was out, she felt so calm. It was about time to get this thing straightened out. Walking to the edge of the residence, a gust of wind enveloped her, carrying her down from the Emperor Star school.At Donghai Academy, there were tons of students walking around the campus. Right at this moment, someone looked up at the sky and shouted, \"Hua Jieyu!\"Gradually, more people began to look up. They saw Hua Jieyu being carried through the sky by a force of Spiritual Qi, like a goddess strolling in the air.\"So beautiful. Not even the girl with Minister Zuo can compare to her. Hua Jieyu really is Donghai Academy's number one beauty,\" said one of the students. Many hearts skipped a beat as they looked at the goddess in the sky. They could only watch her from afar because she was already dating someone. Even goddesses have people they like.Mu Yunxuan. That name made many people envious, and even jealous.Hua Jieyu stopped and descended from the skies. When she saw that she had the attention of a good amount of people, she began to speak, \"Recently, there have been some rumors about me being spread around Donghai Academy.\"Everyone looked at her. There seemed to be something different about Hua Jieyu.\"They are untrue,\" she said calmly. This stirred up some feelings instantly. For a while now, the rumors about Hua Jieyu dating Mu Yunxuan spread to every corner of the academy. Now, Hua Jieyu had actually spoken up. The rumors were false. Hua Jieyu came all the way down from the School of the Emperor Star just to set things straight.Saying all she had to say, she turned to leave.\"So, does this mean you don't have anyone you like?\" someone gathered the courage to yell out at Hua Jieyu.Hua Jieyu slowed down. In her mind, a certain young man appeared, which brought a smile to her face. \"I do have someone I like.\"Hua Jieyu's smile had many people in a daze. But at the same time, their hopes and dreams were destroyed once again. Hua Jieyu already had someone she liked. It's just that it was the rumored Mu Yunxuan.\"Who is he? Is he better than Mu Yunxuan?\" someone asked.Hua Jieyu thought of the spectacular young man again and smiled even brighter. \"Mu Yunxuan is not worthy to be compared to him.\" After that, she was up in the skies again, dancing through the clouds like a goddess.Everyone was shocked, frozen in place. Along with hearing Hua Jieyu's words, they were able to hear the sound of their hearts break.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 68": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Legend of FutianCH 68Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayHua Jieyu's appearance instantly created a gust of wind in Donghai Academy. Rumors about her relationship with Mu Yunxuan had abounded recently. They even said that Mu Yunxuan had said it himself, and no one from the School of the Emperor Star refuted it so everyone thought it was real.But today, this world-class beauty personally walked from the School of the Emperor Star to announce to everyone in Donghai Academy that this wasn't real. She had someone she liked but it wasn't Mu Yunxuan. Mu Yunxuan couldn't be compared to the person she liked.You can imagine the uproar to Hua Jieyu's words, the most beautiful girl of Donghai Academy. It was like a slap to Mu Yunxuan, the talent of the School of the Emperor Star. There was no dignity left for him. Perhaps Hua Jieyu really was mad because these rumors could hurt the person she truly liked.The people of Donghai Academy could imagine Mu Yunxuan's feelings now. But compared to that, they were more curious about the one Hua Jieyu liked.Who was the one that could make Hua Jieyu so beautiful when talking about him? Who was the one that Mu Yunxuan wasn't even good enough to be compared to? Did someone like this really exist in Donghai Academy? After all, Mu Yunxuan was the genius prodigy of the School of the Emperor Star.At that moment, the one Hua Jieyu spoke of was practicing his guqin in the School. He was immersed in it from day to night. His grandmaster was definitely a master of the guqin arts. His attainment was at the peak. Even Hua Fengliu couldn't be compared to him. He could use music notes to cast spells from other schools, resonating musical spells with others. It could create even more explosive power and was clearly deeper than what he had taught Hua Fengliu. The man hadn't learned these.The night sky was as dark as ink. Under the bright moon, the School of the Emperor Star looked even more majestic. Music streamed from a pavilion. The youth sat on a stone bench and played the qin. A beautiful girl sat beside him, listening to the melody. Under the moonlit sky, this scene was so beautiful and peaceful.After a while, the music came to a stop. The youth gazed at the girl and said gently, \"Fox, time to rest.\"\"No, I want to stay here with you.\" Hua Jieyu's eyes were as gentle as water. She smiled and shook her head.\"Then I'll go rest with you,\" Ye Futian said.\"No way.\" Hua Jieyu smiled. What was this bad guy thinking now?\"Huh, you're still not my girl,\" Ye Futian said, hurt.\"That trick doesn't work.\" Hua Jieyu smiled. He always pretended to be pitiful.Despite her words, she leaned against Ye Futian and slowly lied down into his lap. The arrogant and fairy-like girl at the Donghai Academy during the day had now become a girl in love. She was so gentle.\"It seems to work.\" Ye Futian looked at the pretty girl in his lap. He caressed her hair and dipped his head. He pecked her forehead. His eyes were filled with softness. Hua Jieyu smiled sweetly. With her head on Ye Futian's thighs, she murmured, \"Don't mess around. Keep practicing and I'll rest here.\"Ye Futian gave Hua Jieyu puppy eyes. \"Fox, do you think I can practice with you here?\"\"I don't care. Let me sleep for a bit.\" Hua Jieyu looked smug as she closed her eyes.\"Oh, you sly fox.\" Ye Futian felt tragic but he started practicing again.If anyone in Donghai Academy knew that Ye Futian felt sad now, they'd probably slap him to death.The music was peaceful and Hua Jieyu actually fell asleep quickly. Ye Futian looked down at the girl. Her eyelashes were long and pretty. A smile still hung on her face as she slept. It was sweet and beautiful. Seeing the sleeping beauty, Ye Futian smiled too. He murmured, \"Fox, you suck.\" Then he raised his head and kept playing.The music continued from night to day. During the night, Ye Futian felt his energy changing. A slight smile appeared on his face. He had been frustrated all these days due to the rumors but last night, he had felt more peaceful than ever before. With the music notes, he had a mental breakthrough without realizing. This way, he was at the Four-star Glory Plane for both martial arts and sorcery.A cough broke the early morning peace. Ye Futian saw the old man walk over. He smiled trembled. Hua Jieyu's eyes opened and she got up, pink tinging her cheeks.\"Grandmaster,\" Hua Jieyu called with her head lowered. There was some embarrassment in her voice.\"Must be nice to be young.\" The old man smiled at the two before him. They were like a perfect pair. He could feel the pure feelings just seeing them. \"I hope you will be in love like this forever.\" He gave his blessing with a smile.Ye Futian and Hua Jieyu exchanged glances. Both of them had smiling eyes.\"Grandmaster, we will,\" Ye Futian said.\"You can't slack on your cultivation though,\" the elder said. Ye Futian smiled and nodded. He continued practicing. Hua Jieyu stayed there and cultivated too.\"Han Mo is here to greet his senior.\" A voice came from outside.The elder's smile faded. He said indifferently, \"Come in.\" As soon as he finished, a few figures walked in. The first was the Emperor Star elder Ye Futian had seen before.\"How have you been?\" Han Mo asked with a smile.\"Can I help you?\" Elder Qin asked.\"There is nothing much but I heard that Ye Futian was practicing here, so I came to take a look,\" Han Mo said. His gaze fell on Ye Futian. \"I told you last time that you can come to the School of the Emperor Star. Why didn't you tell me after you came?\"\"I came with Headmaster Yi. I am sorry for not notifying you,\" Ye Futian said politely.\"It is alright. Since you are practicing with my senior, why don't you join this school?\" Han Mo's smile remained.Ye Futian shook his head wryly. \"You are joking again. I have already joined the School of the Finance Star. If I join the Emperor Star, I would be betraying the Finance Star. Do you accept disciples like that?\"\"That is true.\" The old man nodded and said, \"Since you are not joining then, according to the rules, you cannot stay here for long.\"Hearing his words, something flashed through Ye Futian's eyes. He looked at the man's smile and Mu Yunxuan behind him. He obviously knew that Han Mo was planning something. The one who reminded him at the Luo palace was obviously not Han Mo.\"You have problems with the fact that I am keeping him here to practice?\" Elder Qin's muddled eyes grew sharp. His entire aura seemed to change. His robe fluttered and his white hair flew in the wind.Han Mo bowed. \"Senior, please do not be angry. I was just saying but I will leave now.\" With that, he really turned to leave. At the same time, he said, \"Yunxuan, apologize to Jieyu.\"\"Yes.\" Mu Yunxuan walked up and said to Hua Jieyu, \"The rumors affected you negatively. Please do not mind them.\"\"Get out,\" Hua Jieyu uttered, staring at Mu Yunxuan coldly.Mu Yunxuan's face stiffened. His handsome face became embarrassed. It was one thing for Hua Jieyu to declare the rumors unfounded yesterday at Donghai Academy. It did not affect Mu Yunxuan too much. But Hua Jieyu did not spare any dignity for him. She told everyone that he could not even be compared to who she liked. Everyone was discussing him as if he was a clown. And now, Hua Jieyu also told him to get out so mercilessly.Seeing Ye Futian beside her, Mu Yunxuan realized that this boy was the one she liked.\"Yesterday, Jieyu said that I can't be compared to you. I cannot disturb your master today but in the future, I hope we can have some exchanges,\" Mu Yunxuan said to Ye Futian, still polite.Ye Futian did not know what had happened yesterday but he could guess from Mu Yunxuan's words. After deciding to stay in this school and Hua Jieyu no longer had to avoid him, she probably personally revealed the truth. Thinking of this, Ye Futian smiled gently at Hua Jieyu. He took her hands and glanced at Mu Yunxuan, giving a strong response to what Mu Yunxuan had said earlier.Seeing this, Mu Yunxuan's expression grew more uncomfortable.\"Get out,\" Ye Futian said the same two words as Hua Jieyu. Even though he was told to do so by the School of the Emperor Star, Ye Futian could not tolerate Mu Yunxuan saying he was dating Hua Jieyu.Sensing Hua Jieyu's reliance on him, Ye Futian knew that this event had hurt her. She had become sensitive and weak. He needed to make Mu Yunxuan pay.\"Sorry for the disturbance.\" Mu Yunxuan bowed toward Elder Qin and glanced at Ye Futian coldly. His fists clenched loosely. He turned and walked out to catch up with Han Mo.Han Mo's face was dark too. He said coldly, \"Nandou brought her here to cultivate but it seems like nothing will come out of it. If that's the case, what use does she have regardless of her talents?\"\"Professor, that Ye Futian will be troublesome in the future too,\" Mu Yunxuan said.\"Him?\" Han Mo sneered. \"Youths who don't know how to lie low will die easily. The School of the Finance Star can't protect him for long.\"Hearing those words, a cold murderous glint flashed past Mu Yunxuan's eyes!...\u2026Days later, Yi Xiang came to the School of the Emperor Star to pick him up. Minister Zuo had sent people over and was preparing to travel to Qingzhou City.In the yard, Yi Xiang walked forward. He floated in the air and his hands were behind his back. Behind him, Ye Futian said to Hua Jieyu, \"Qingzhou isn't far from Donghai. With Minister Zuo's demon, it'll only take one day. I'll be back soon. Don't worry.\"\"Okay, I'll wait for you,\" Hua Jieyu said gently. She would wait no matter how long it took.\"Fox, I'm leaving.\" Ye Futian's eyes were unwilling but he left with Yi Xiang. Hua Jieyu watched his back. She did not turn to go cultivate until he was completely gone!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He wondered it this girl liked being defeated.\"No,\" he answered. Ye Futian glanced at the young woman.\"What is that look supposed to mean?\" Seeing the way Ye Futian looked at her made her mad.\"If we fight again, I'm afraid you might cry,\" said Ye Futian. He was determined never to battle with a female ever again.\"You\u2026\" the young woman pointed at him.\"Alright, missy. Let's go, weren't you the one who begged to tag along?\" Minister Zuo did not know what to do with the little princess.\"Just you wait, Ye Futian.\" She then turned to the Minister Zuo. \"Master, I want him to be my guard.\"\"I...\" Ye Futian was dumbfounded. He looked to Minister Zuo. \"Senior.\" She couldn't do this, could she?\"Stop fooling around.\" The Minister Zuo looked at the young woman once and then gave out his order, \"Let's go!\" The large group riding on creatures began their journey, heading in the direction of the East Sea.\"I don't care. Master, didn't you say his innate powers were good and that he was gifted? Then he would be perfect as my guard. He can also battle me time to time to help me gain combat experience,\" the young woman whined to the Minister Zuo. Ye Futian stared in shock. What did she take him for?\"Then you'll have to ask Ye Futian to see if he'll agree,\" said Minister Zuo. Ye Futian thanked the Minister Zuo silently.The young woman looked towards Ye Futian and said, \"You're better off by my side than you are at Donghai Academy.\"\"No.\" Ye Futian remembered what Hua Jieyu made him promise and rejected her firmly. \"I really do have a girlfriend.\"\"You!\" The young woman seemed to be adjusting to Ye Futian's shameless antics because she suddenly smiled. With a beautiful smile, she faced Ye Futian and asked, \"Is your girlfriend really as pretty as I am?\"Ye Futian saw her smile and did not know what to say. How could her expression change so abruptly? She was trying to get her way through the means of seduction. However, Ye Futian thought it was wasted effort because he was an honest man.However, he couldn't believe that she remembered what he said yesterday. When it came to appearances, women were indeed...\"You are very beautiful, but my girlfriend is even more so,\" Ye Futian said with a serious look on his face. The young woman's smile disappeared in an instant and she snickered at Ye Futian, \"Who would believe you?\" She seemed to know that there was no hope and refused to look at Ye Futian.That self-confidence, Ye Futian thought to himself, if this girl met Hua Jieyu, then she would not be so confident.At the thought of Hua Jieyu, a smile crept on his face. Ye Futian closed his eyes and enjoyed the gentle blowing of the wind in silence.Quickly, the group made it past the city and arrived at the East Sea. In the vast sea, the wind blew and ships sailed. The group did not stall for too long before they were on their way again, this time headed for Qingzhou Academy. Several hours later, from the skies over the East Sea, an island came into view.Ye Futian stood on top of the beast he was previously riding on and looked at the nearing island. He had no idea he would be back so soon. It did not seem like that long ago that he left the island city. So many thoughts floated through his mind. Was Senior Sister Qin Yi doing alright? Was General Qin Shuai doing better? Did Feng Qingxue miss him? Probably. He smiled at the thought of being back home.Finally, the beasts were flying right above the island. They did not stop but continued in the direction of Qingzhou Academy.BOOM! At this very moment, a loud sound came from the ground. Ye Futian and everyone were concerned as they looked down. They saw the ground shake, as if an earthquake or a tsunami was about to dawn upon the city.\"What's going on?\" Minister Zuo's eyes flickered and the beasts continued to advance. A moment later, the loud rumbling resumed and the ground was shaking once again. The citizens of Qingzhou City were in a frenzy. The stronger people ascended into mid-air while the weaker people were running on the streets. Everyone was in shock.BOOM! The ground was still shaking without a pattern. As they got deeper into the city, the shaking got more violent. Even when the monster tide occurred, it did not affect the areas this far way. Right not, it seemed like the entire island was being affected. It was originating from the direction of Qingzhou Academy.What on earth was going on? Ye Futian's heart was pounding. Even though he was not able to become an official disciple of Qingzhou Academy, he still had a sentimental attachment to this place. He did not wish for anything to happen to the academy.The beasts sped up and charged forward. Not long after, they arrived at Qingzhou Academy.Right now, the whole area was shaking non-stop. Some buildings had already fallen. The teachers and students were all looking in the direction of Mount Tianyao. Their hearts in a frenzy. There seemed to be an ultimate battle taking place in Mount Tianyao.Mount Tianyao. It's Senior Snow Ape! thought Ye Futian. His expression changed. The shaking was coming from Mount Tianyao. There could only be one thing that would lead to such strong vibrations through the ground, and that was a huge battle between the Snow Ape and some unknown people.The Snow Ape's powers were unimaginably strong. He may very well be second in power after Emperor Ye Qing. Ye Futian was unsure of exactly how powerful he was, but to be able to battle with the Snow Ape, it was most likely a fearsome opponent. It was hard for Ye Futian not to worry.\"Seems like someone got here before I could,\" said Minister Zuo. The group stood between area between Qingzhou Academy and Mount Tianyao. People who went ahead to test the waters came back to report their findings. They greeted the minister with a bow. \"Minister Zuo, things are not good!\"\"Do you know who it is?\" Minister Zuo asked.\"It's not possible for a person so powerful to exist in Nandou Nation.\" The reporting person shook his head. Minister Zuo contemplated for a while and said, \"All of you stay here, I'll go take a look.\"Obviously, everything they had previously prepared was now useless. The plans had been spoiled. An extremely powerful individual got wind of the news and came to Qingzhou City.\"Senior, can you take me with you?\" asked Ye Futian.\"Your abilities are still too weak. It will be dangerous,\" said Minister Zuo.\"That's okay. I want to take a look at what's going on.\" Ye Futian was determined.\"I cannot promise your absolute safety,\" Minister Zuo spoke again. Ye Futian nodded and the two of them made their way into Mount Tianyao.The vibrations of the ground were even stronger now that they were closer to the mountains. Demons and monsters ran frantically in every direction. With Minister Zuo's powers, none of the demons or monsters dared to stand in his way. Finally, they reached the epicenter of the vibrations. One look at the scene ahead and the powerful minister began to shudder, not able to calm down.\"Senior.\" Ye Futian clenched his fist. His body was shaking. His eyes were filled with a wild flame and all the veins on his arms were visible.Up ahead, was an enormous Snow Ape, taller than the mountains. Compared to when Ye Futian had met him before, the Snow Ape was much larger now. His head was in the clouds. His enormous body stood in the midst of a storm, but he remained standing steadily like the mountains. A golden chain was locked around the Snow Ape's body. The light coming from the chain was shining brighter than the sun. The chain seemed to have come from the heavens, creating a link between Heaven and Earth.The Snow Ape reached out his hands, filled with immense power. However, the Snow Ape's snow-white fur was covered in blood. He was bleeding from wounds all over his body. He looked up at the figures in the sky unyieldingly. Ye Futian also looked up at the sky with his blood-shot eyes.Up in the skies, stood a group of people. They were spread out in the air. A light shone from each of their bodies. This light enveloped them like a divine armor and the people looked domineering, like the gods in Heaven. Standing above them, were two more people. They were quiet.One of the two was dressed in a robe of sorts. She was dazzling, elegant, and holy like a celestial fairy. She did not look too old, maybe about Ye Futian's age. Even though she was young, her aura was outstanding. It was almost as if she was born superior to others.She looked very content. Beside her stood a figure that seemed like a divine general. His force field covered her as if to protect her. Compared with Minister Zuo's disciple, the girl won in regards of elegance and looks.Perhaps, even if the goddess-like Hua Jieyu were here, she would not be able to overshadow this girl. The two girls were on a similar level in terms of looks, but when it came to elegance, not even Hua Jieyu could beat her. If Hua Jieyu was compared to a descended goddess, then this girl was a celestial fairy straight from the heavens.It was almost as if the Snow Ape could sense Ye Futian's arrival. He looked over in Ye Futian's direction and seemed to have mistaken the situation. The Snow Ape looked at Minister Zuo with blood-red eyes, conveying his intent to kill.A loud growl sounded. The world seemed to have become frozen and covered in snow. Along with the clanging of chains, the Snow Ape charged at Minister Zuo, lifting his arms, preparing to attack. Minister Zuo's face paled. He could feel his body slowly being sealed by the ice.\"Senior!\" Ye Futian jumped in front of Minister Zuo. He realized that the Snow Ape must have mistakenly thought that Minister Zuo was holding him against his will.The Snow Ape struck the two with his hand causing Minister Zuo and Ye Futian to land far away with a loud crash. The chain rattled again, but this time, to pull him back.Minister Zuo and Ye Futian picked themselves up off the ground. At this moment, they noticed that the group in the sky were looking down at them. The divine general-like figure spoke to them, \"Kneel.\" His voice was domineering, superior, and arrogant.\"Greetings, I am a prime minister of Nandou Nation. May I ask who you guys are?\" asked Minister Zuo. He joined his hands together in a salute.The fairy-like female looked down at them and replied, \"My family name is Donghuang.\"Minister Zuo's knees hit the ground and he bowed his head to the floor. This was not only because the opposing side was power, but also because of their identity.Her surname was Donghuang.The prophecy has been fulfilled, Minister Zuo thought to himself. A shiver ran down his back. The reason he was willing to risk coming here was because he told his own fortune. The prophecy said that this journey will not be dangerous. On the contrary, he would meet a person fated to become emperor. Never would Minister Zuo have imagined, by being fated to become emperor, it did not mean the emperor of the Nandou Nation\u2014it meant the emperor of the Divine Prefectures.Ye Futian did not kneel down. In the storm, he looked up to the sky. He stood up straight and, in this moment, he was calmer than ever before. He met eyes with the air in the sky. The look they shared was a look of destiny.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She looked back at him.My name is Donghuang. Ye Futian even felt like that sentence was spoken to him instead of Minister Zuo.Boundless icy winds blew through, causing flurries of snow that fell from the sky. An indescribable coldness descended into the world. Everyone looked over at the towering mountain's vastness. They saw the Snow Ape look up the vault of heaven. It was sealed in ice with him as the center. The entire world was frozen.\"Child, look carefully.\" A voice floated into Ye Futian's ear. Then he saw a shadow appear inside the Snow Ape's body. It came straight out of the flesh. The endless ice and snow converged into a giant snow staff that the Snow Ape grasped.\"Nine Heavenly Attacks.\" The Snow Ape stood up, almost becoming one with the sky and earth. That moment, incredible power converged above the shadow. His body was so stable. Finally, the Snow Ape's large shadow moved. The first hit gathered the power of the world and slammed against the atrium. The air seemed to be sliced apart and the frozen world was cut into two.Endless wind and snow blocked everyone's vision except Ye Futian. The Snow Ape did not hit anyone. He was just teaching Ye Futian. It was the Freedom Meditation. Even though Ye Futian was sad, he knew that the Snow Ape was using his life to teach. This staff technique was the evolved by Emperor Ye Qing when he created war techniques. Now, the Snow Ape was demonstrating it personally.After the first hit, the power intensified rather than weakening. When the snow staff was swung again, the power of the first hit seemed to meld into the second and sweep everything. Then the third hit, the fourth\u2026 Every hit's power seemed to be multiplying. By the eighth hit, the world was shaking, the mountains were trembling, and the earth had cracked open. The Snow Ape's location had turned into the world's most terrifying windstorm.\"The ninth hit,\" a voice said in Ye Futian's ear. Then he saw the Snow Ape go toward the atrium. The snow staff swung and countless shadows of the staff appeared, flattening the sky.After that, Ye Futian could not see clearly anymore. Blinding light shone from above the atrium. It covered everything. The entire Mount Tianyao shook. The demons all knelt on the ground.An invisible power crashed into Minister Zuo and Ye Futian. They flew backward but something was protecting Ye Futian. He was not fatally hurt but there was pain everywhere.This windstorm lasted a long time because calming down. It began to snow in Mount Tianyao. White snow continued to float down. Ye Futian stood there, gaping. The Snow Ape's shadow had disappeared. All that remained was the giant flesh body standing there. It was lifeless but it still stood up straight and tall.He was standing even in death.In the canyon behind him, Emperor Ye Qing's statue was still undamaged. It was as if the Snow Ape had defended the statue to his death. Ye Futian reached out. A snowflake landed in his palm.\"Child, do not be sad. This was destined. I should have gone with my master long ago but I had to wait for someone. Thankfully, I met you all. I am just sad I cannot see you rule the world with my own eyes.\" There seemed to be a shred of consciousness remaining in the air. It transformed into a voice that floated into Ye Futian's ear. At the corner of his eye was a tear.Was this really all fate? The Snow Ape knew the ending but he still remained here, guarding it.The divine general went toward Emperor Ye Qing's statue to find something but they could not find anything.A figure radiated and the girl in the air said, \"Let his last statue remain.\"The divine general still shone. The terrible light fell upon the statue, flattening it to the ground. The statue that the Snow Ape had protected with his life had still fallen.\"Princess, you should not have sympathy,\" the general said, retracting his light.The girl looked at him coldly and turned around. The people left with her. When she left, she looked down. Her gaze fell on Ye Futian and then moved away. Her figure disappeared in the horizon.When they left, Ye Futian collapsed too. Something had been supporting him before but those violent shakes had even hurt Minister Zuo, let alone him. Before, he had forced himself to stand up and witness it all. Minister Zuo coughed out blood. He could not recover quickly. Everything that had happened was indescribable. He did not even see clearly how the Snow Ape had died.Walking to Ye Futian, he looked at the youth's calm face with a bit of gratitude. If not for Ye Futian, the Snow Ape would have killed him. He could feel the murderous intent. But Ye Futian was only a boy. How could he be so calm when faced with all this? He did not even kneel down.The girl from the sky had the surname Donghuang. Even the emperor of Nandou would have to kneel. Their statuses were too different. However, the youth had still been standing up straight. It was not because he was dumb from shock but arrogance from his bones.At that moment, Minister Zuo had the illusion that the boy before him was as high and mighty as the girl from the sky. His eyes flashed. Then he sat down beside Ye Futian. His life spirit appeared. It was a life chart.The Minister of Nandou was a rarely-seen astrologer. Few people knew this secret. Astrologers usually did not live long because they knew too much. The light of the life chart enveloped Ye Futian. The gears moved without stop and sped up.\"What's going on?\" Minister Zuo's expression changed. He stared at the uncontrollable life chart in shock. It spun crazily with noise until it finally slowed down.Minister Zuo stared at the chart. The needle spun until it pointed upward. It seemed to point at the sky. The Minister collapsed onto the ground. Looking at the life chart, his heart twitched.This was impossible. How was this possible?Shouldn't it be the girl in the sky? Her surname was Donghuang.Why did Ye Futian have this fate? The fortune showed that he would meet someone, but who was it?In disbelief, Minister Zuo continued to activate the life chart. After several attempts, he was sweating. He sat beside Ye Futian and stared at the sleeping youth.Would Nandou Nation's fate change because of him?...\u2026When Ye Futian woke up, he saw Minister Zuo beside him. The man smiled. \"You're awake.\"\"Senior,\" Ye Futian greeted. He sat up.\"You saved my life so you shouldn't call me 'senior' anymore. If you don't mind, you can call me Uncle Zuo,\" Minister Zuo said with a smile. He felt guilty inside. As the minister, he had taken advantage of the boy without him realizing.\"Uncle Zuo.\" Ye Futian was not very straightforward. Becoming close to the minister of Nandou would be good for him when he returned to Donghai City.\"Yes.\" Minister Zuo nodded. \"How are your injuries?\"\"No big deal.\" Ye Futian looked back. He was sad when he saw the statue-like body. \"Uncle Zuo,\" he said, \"I want to stay here for a while. You can go back first.\"Minister Zuo shook his head. \"The demons have been chased away but they might come back. It's too dangerous. Why don't I stay here with you?\"\"But\u2026\" Ye Futian wanted to continue but Minister Zuo interrupted, \"You're calling me uncle already. We're not strangers. Go do what you want to do. I'll just cultivate here.\"\"Okay.\" Ye Futian nodded and stopped talking. He got up and walked toward the Snow Ape's body. There, he kept standing but he looked up to the heavens.\"Senior, I can't take revenge for you now so I'll just accompany you for a while.\" Ye Futian's voice was sad. He sat by the Snow Ape's body. The Guqin Spirit appeared and descended before him. Ye Futian started playing right there. A gloomy melody sounded as if in farewell.After the tune, Ye Futian started cultivating. The Snow Ape had taught him the Nine Heavenly Attacks before dying. Cultivating here was like the last comfort to the Snow Ape's spirit.The days passed. Without realizing, months had passed.Nine Heavenly Attacks was extremely difficult. When Ye Futian learned the third hit, both his martial arts and sorcery cultivation had reached the Five-star Glory Plane. That day, Ye Futian knelt before the Snow Ape's body. He kowtowed three times before standing up and turning around. He never looked back.\"Uncle Zuo, let's go back,\" Ye Futian said to Minister Zuo, who was cultivating with his eyes closed.The man opened his eyes and nodded. \"Okay.\" With that, he and Ye Futian flew into the sky. They left Mount Tianyao. Ye Futian's recent actions had been odd but he did not ask.Once out of Mount Tianyao, they were close to Qingzhou Academy. Minister Zuo's men were waiting there. Seeing Minister Zuo return, they let out sighs of relief and went to greet him.\"Where's the princess?\" Minister Zuo asked.\"They were living in Qingzhou Academy while you weren't here,\" someone said.\"That girl has probably caused a ruckus,\" Minister Zuo said. He walked forward and they all went toward Qingzhou Academy.The red-clothed girl was the princess of Nandou. She was now living in the School of Martial Arts. Many people where there right now. When Ye Futian walked in, he saw Qin Yi. Surprised, he called, \"Ms. Qin.\"\"Futian!\" Qin Yi was surprised when she saw Ye Futian.\"I wanted to go find you. Why are you here?\" Ye Futian asked. Hearing this, Qin Yi lowered her head slightly.\"Professor, you're back. The servants here don't know how to take care of people. I can finally go back now.\" The girl walked by. Many big figures of the School of Martial Arts were present.They all froze when they saw Ye Futian but Ye Futian's eyes turned cold.Servant?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Leng Qingfeng, the Cabinet Master of the House of Swordsmen looked at Ye Futian and asked, \"What are you doing here?\"\"What is my Senior Sister doing here?\" Ye Futian did not answer his question. Leng Qingfeng took a look around at everyone.\"This...\" he did not know how to explain the situation.\"She's your Senior Sister?\" the young woman snickered. Then to Ye Futian, she said, \"She's been my servant these past couple days, but it's such a pity that she doesn't know how to take care of other people. If you promise to be my underling, I'll let her go. How about it?\"\"You did this?\" Ye Futian glared at her coldly.\"Ye Futian, I'm fine,\" Qin Yi said, pulling at his sleeve.\"But I'm not fine, Senior Sister.\" Ye Futian looked at Qin Yi. He moved her hands away and walked towards the young woman. His demeanor was cold, but at the same time, he looked furious. Seeing him like this slightly frightened the young woman. She asked, \"What do you want?\"\"Didn't you say that you wanted to battle again? I'll fulfill your wish,\" he said. His pace quickened, racing straight towards the young woman.\"You're crazy!\" She saw Ye Futian charging at her, but because he was going too fast, he reached her before she was able to defend herself. A punch was thrown at her. The young women gathered energy to defend herself, but his fist broke through her defense and landed on her chest. The young woman flew through the air and was thrown through two closed doors. After breaking the doors, she landed on the ground.Everyone watching was dumbfounded at the scene they just witnessed. Qin Yi looked pale because she knew that this young woman was the princess of the Nandou Nation. Even Xia Fan, the Vice Chief of the East Sea Prefecture and the person who destroyed Qin Yi's family, had to kneel down in her presence. Ye Futian actually threw her in the air with a single punch.\"Princess!\" someone shouted.\"Ye Futian, that was out of line,\" said someone from the School of Martial Arts, as a group of them went up to help the princess.The young woman walked out of the room she had just been thrown into, with a hand on her chest. Her eyes were red, as it she was really going to cry. She had never been hit before. What's more, this was already the second time.\"Master, he's bullying me. Kill him!\" the young woman ordered as she looked at Minister Zuo. The powerful cultivators of Nandou Nation surrounded Ye Futian.\"Minister Zuo, please have mercy!\" Leng Qingfeng pleaded.\"Ye Futian.\" Qin Yi's face was pale and she placed herself in front of him.\"Step down!\" order Minister Zuo. The people surrounding Ye Futian retreated.\"Master...\" said the young woman. She was shocked and did not understand what her master was doing.\"Have you had enough?\" In a stern tone, Minister Zuo said to the young woman, \"Apologize to Ye Futian.\"\"Me? Apologize to him?\" The young woman's eyes were about to pop out of her head as she stared at her master. She was a princess and she was the one who had to apologize after getting hit by Ye Futian?\"Are you not going to listen to me?\" Minister Zuo looked at the young woman with a serious look on his face. He could not believe that this child actually ordered to have Ye Futian killed. She would know that this was for her own good some time in the future.\"Uncle Zuo, forget about the apology. I can't bear it,\" said Ye Futian. \"All I want to know is who made my Senior Sister a servant?\" General Qin Shuai, the protector of the City of Qingzhou, was disabled by Xia Fan when he offended him for the well-being of the city. Now, his daughter, who was cultivating at Qingzhou Academy, was being treated as a servant? Witnessing this with his own two eyes, it was clear that Ye Futian was beyond furious. If it was the young woman's fault, he would hold this against her, even if she was the princess.\"Hurry up and tell him,\" Minister Zuo ordered the young woman.She felt wronged seeing her master side with Ye Futian. Her eyes were filled with tears. She looked at Ye Futian and told him, \"It was the City Lord who sent her to take care of me. Why are you blaming me?\"\"Murong Yunshan?\" Ye Futian's eyes grew cold. He asked the people of the School of Martial Arts, \"Is this how you treat the daughter of General Qin?\"Everyone lowered their heads in shame. They knew that City Lord Murong Yunshan was purposely picking on Qin Yi, but what could they do? Now, it was Ye Futian who would stand up against the Murong family again. Last time as well, he executed Murong Qiu in front of students of Qingzhou Academy all by himself. It was just as the Thunder Pavilion Lord had said when he left, the prestigious Qingzhou Academy was nothing compared to this one young man.Not even a year had passed, and this young man was back in Qingzhou Academy. He was actually able to defeat a five-starred Glory Plane Mandate Sorcerer with one punch. To add to that, the person he hit was the princess of the Nandou Nation and afterwards, Minister Zuo even had the princess apologize to Ye Futian.The world had changed so quickly. When the Pavilion Lord of the Thunder Pavilion left, he said that Qingzhou Academy would know what they missed out on when Ye Futian became known to the world. It seemed like what he said was slowly coming true. Ye Futian's growth was truly shocking.\"General Qin?\" Minister Zuo looked at Ye Futian and asked, \"Ye Futian, is there a story behind this?\"\"General Qin is the protector of our city,\" answered Ye Futian. He turned to Minister Zuo and summarized the story of General Qin, and Xia Fan, Murong Yunshan and the others. When he finished retelling the story, Minister Zuo became extra cold. He said, \"Those b*stards! Murong Yunshan plunged the people into misery and suffering, but has become the City Lord?\"\"Uncle Zuo, I want him dead,\" said Ye Futian. He was out for blood.\"Go, bring him here,\" ordered Minister Zuo.\"Understood!\" someone answered his order and flew to find Murong Yunshan. The people of Qingzhou Academy shuddered at this scene. Was the Murong family done for? One word from the prime minister of the Nandou Nation was enough to have a whole family killed off, even if it was the City Lord.\"Ye Futian,\" called out Qin Yi. She looked at the young man standing in front of her. It hadn't even been a year since she last saw him, what on earth had he been through? For her, he attacked the princess.\"Senior Sister, everything is okay now.\" Ye Futian smiled at Qin Yi.She nodded, eyes red. In this time, she learned the truth about human nature. Many people treated her poorly. Even the people who courted her before changed their attitude towards her. As if it was not enough that Xia Fan and Murong Yunshan caused her father's disability, Murong Shan used the arrival of the princess as an excuse to suppress her growth in cultivation.\"Don't you still owe me an apology?\" the young woman asked Ye Futan. She still felt wronged.\"Senior Sister, did she give you a hard time?\" Ye Futian asked Qin Yi.\"No,\" she said as she shook her head.\"Then I'll forgive you,\" he said to the young woman.\"You...\" The young woman pointed a finger at Ye Futian, not knowing what to say. Then she turned to look at Minister Zuo with puppy dog eyes.\"That's enough. No matter what, you were in the wrong first. Why do you need a servant when traveling? Treat this as a lesson learned,\" said Minister Zuo gently. He then turned to Ye Futian. \"Ye Futian, I watched her grow up. Other than being a little obstinate, she doesn't mean any harm. Please don't take what she does to heart, and take care of her if possible.\"\"I need him to take care of me?\" The young girl felt that Minister Zuo was a little strange since coming down from the mountains. What on earth happened?\"Uncle Zuo, that's too much. I was a little rash. This situation had nothing to do with the princess, so I am at fault,\" said Ye Futian. Minister Zuo showed much respect for Ye Futian. Even though he saved Minister Zuo on Mount Tianyao, Ye Futian knew that there was a limit to what he could do. After all, the young woman was the princess and her master was Minister Zuo.\"Is this the attitude you use in an apology?\" the young woman chewed on her own lip.\"Fine, then I'll promise to battle you the next time you ask,\" he said.\"Who wants to fight you?\" The young woman scratched her head. After that one punch, she finally realized, she could not defeat him.Minister Zuo saw her expression and could not help but smile. It looked like her temper had dissolved. Ye Futian and the princess should have made up by now, right?\"After a little while, Murong Yunshan was escorted to them. He still had no idea what was going on. When he saw Ye Futian, Murong Yunshan saw red. His son, Murong Qiu, had died at the hands of Ye Futian.\"Greetings to Minister Zuo and the princess from Qingzhou City's City Lord, Murong Yunshan,\" he bowed.\"Ye Futian, what do you want to do with him?\" asked Minister Zuo.\"I want him beheaded,\" Ye Futian answered without hesitation.Murong Yunshan was in complete shock. He lifted his head to look at Ye Futian. What was going on?\"Off with his head!\" One word from Minister Zuo and the people standing behind Murong Yunshan restrained him.\u00a0In this moment, Murong Yunshan finally realized the predicament he was in.\"Please spare me, Minister Zuo! What did I do wrong?\" Murong Yunshan's expression was completely different. However, Minister Zuo did not bother with him. The minister looked at Ye Futian and felt a cold shiver when he saw Ye Futian's cold eyes.It was then that Murong Yunshan understood, the person who wanted to kill him wasn't Minister Zuo, but was the young man in front of him. He was once an outer-sect disciple of Qingzhou Academy. Murong Yunshan thought of the Fall Quarter Examinations. That was the first time Ye Futian stood up in the middle of the stage, stubborn and unwavering. Murong Yunshan never expected that the lives of both him and his son would end in the hands of Ye Futian.\"I cannot accept this!\" Murong Yunshan screamed furiously. A moment later, Qingzhou City's City Lord was dead in Qingzhou Academy.\"Have the Murong family property confiscated,\" Minister Zuo ordered. Immediately, his people left to get things taken care of.\"What do you think of making General Qin the new City Lord of Qingzhou City?\" Minister Zuo asked Ye Futian.\"Thank you, Uncle Zuo!\" Naturally, Ye Futian had the same thought, but he did not feel right asking this of Minister Zuo. He was so shocked at this treatment he was receiving from Minister Zuo. Ye Futian was being treated so well, it was getting suspicious.The casual words exchanged in this courtyard flipped the whole city upside down. First, the powerful Murong Chamber of Commerce was destroyed. Originally, the Municipal Guards tried to resist, but when they found out the prime minister of the Nandou Nation ordered the destruction, they gave up the thought of defending it. There were also many guards in the Municipal Guards who actually volunteered to clean out the Murong family house. They did not want to be suspected of siding with the Murong family. Then, out of nowhere, General Qin was invited to fill the spot of City Lord. All of this happened in such a short period of time. Very quickly the news spread all through the City of Qingzhou.Qingzhou Academy was the first to get the news. All the students were extremely shocked. They heard that the leader of all these events was actually Ye Futian!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The girl was 18-years-old. It was the prime of one's youth. She was pure yet sexy. The boy was a bit younger but had an outstanding aura and was very handsome.\"Do you have to leave today?\" Qin Yi lowered her head. She walked quickly and her voice was sad.\"Yeah.\" Ye Futian nodded.\"You brat. You want to leave as soon as you see your senior? Am I that unappreciated?\" Qin Yi gave Ye Futian a look.\"Senior, you know that Donghai City has a lot of things that need someone so successful to do,\" Ye Futian said jokingly with a smile.\"I trust you.\" Qin Yi glared in mocking anger and then smiled. \"Back then, you said you were a mandate sorcerer and I didn't believe you. Now, I'll believe whatever you say.\"\"My charisma is getting stronger,\" Ye Qingxuan said proudly. \"Are you falling for me?\"Qin Yi was taken by surprise. She smiled and continued walking forward as she said, \"Yeah, I am.\"\"Well, it doesn't matter. Too many people are pursuing me. Senior, you're too slow.\" Ye Futian smiled.\"Go die.\" Qin Yi raised a slim leg and kicked Ye Futian while rolling her eyes. Qin Yi looked especially attractive now.The students who passed by saw the two play-fighting. They were all envious, thinking that Ye Futian was still the same powerful Ye Futian. But now, they were no longer looking at him with jealousy and hatred. Instead, there was some respect. They all knew what had happened in Qingzhou City. The Ye Futian now had become someone they needed to look up to. In the future, he might even become a legend of Qingzhou Academy.There was a pretty girl standing in the near distance. She was beautiful and tall. After half a year, her beauty had increased.\"Senior, look, I didn't lie,\" Ye Futian said to Qin Yi after seeing the girl.\"Look how cocky you are.\" Qin Yi sighed inwardly and they walked forward.\"Why didn't you come see me?\" Feng Qingxue asked as she forced herself to smile.\"I'm here now, aren't I?\" Ye Futian smiled. \"The little girl from before has become more beautiful. Do you miss me?\"\"This brat.\" Qin Yi looked at him, speechless from his narcissism.\"Yeah,\" Feng Qingxue nodded with a smile. Qin Yi was shocked.\"That sucks. You'll have to keep missing me.\" Ye Futian shrugged.Feng Qingxue studied him. \"I want to see the outside world too.\"\"It's dangerous out there and you're so pretty. It'll be more dangerous for you,\" Ye Futian said.\"But you're there, right?\" Feng Qingxue seemed to have gathered all her courage to say that.\"Don't, Uncle Feng will think I stole you away.\" Ye Futian reached out and petted Feng Qingxue's head. She froze, allowing Ye Futian to mess up her hair. This felt so familiar. But sadly, everything was different and they could not go back.\"How is Yu Sheng?\" Feng Qingxue asked.\"Oh, Yu Sheng,\" Ye Futian muttered. He was angry thinking about the guy. \"He's dating and doesn't want me anymore.\"Feng Qingxue was shocked. Even Yu Sheng was dating? Thinking of this, she suddenly felt bitter. It seemed that time had really changed a lot.\"What about you and Hua Jieyu? Are you dating?\" Feng Qingxue studied him.\"She can't escape from me. She didn't want me to come here.\" Thinking of the fox, Ye Futian's eyes twinkled. He was still smiling casually but it made Feng Qingxue jealous. They were the perfect pair.\"I wish you two well.\" Feng Qingxue smiled gently.\"We will.\" Ye Futian smiled as well. \"I'm leaving. I don't want you two to miss me too much, so I'll hug you two.\"\"Okay.\" Feng Qingxue nodded. She walked forward and hugged Ye Futian. She leaned her head against his chest as if wanting to enjoy that feeling. For a moment, her heart was besieged. Tears rolled down instantly. She pushed Ye Futian away and ran off with a tear-streaked face. So that was how it felt to hug him.Looking at Feng Qingxue's back, Ye Futian sighed inside. Qin Yi rolled her eyes. She walked forward to hug him lightly and then separated.\"Senior, I'm leaving.\" Ye Futian smiled and turned confidently.Minister Zuo and the others were waiting in the distance. Seeing Ye Futian come, the girl beside Minister Zuo was unhappy. She said, \"This is someone with a girlfriend, shameless jerk.\"Minister Zuo felt awkward. This girl was full of resentment.\"Uncle Zuo, let's go,\" Ye Futian said when he got close.Minister Zuo nodded. The people climbed on their demons.Sensing something, Ye Futian glanced at the girl. \"I'm attractive but you don't have to keep staring at me, right?\"\"Shameless,\" the girl spat. Then she turned away.\"I\u2026\" Ye Futian was speechless.The demons leaped into the sky. The people of Qingzhou Academy watched them leave. Many of the big figures still had not calmed down.In the sky, Minister Zuo asked Ye Futian from his demon, \"Futian, what are your plans when you return to Donghai City? Will you keep studying at the academy? Would you like to go to Nandou's Royal City?\"\"Are there many talented men in the Royal City?\" Ye Futian asked.\"Of course,\" Minister Zuo answered. \"The best of Nandou go to the Royal City, including the most talented from Donghai City.\"\"Really?\" Ye Futian chuckled. \"Of course I will but not now.\"\"Oh, I'm sure you have many things you still need to do in Donghai City. I won't pressure you but next spring, something big will happen in Nandou Nation. You must come.\" Minister Zuo smiled.\"What big thing?\" Ye Futian was confused.\"Do you know about Nandou Nation's history?\" Minister Zuo asked.\"I heard from my professor that Nandou was once ruled by the Nandou family,\" Ye Futian answered. \"Then, Emperor Donghuang and Emperor Ye ruled over the Divine Prefectures of the East. The powers of the world were reordered. Nandou was weak and walked down from the throne, replaced by the current king.\"\"Yes, the current royal family is named Luo. In order to remind themselves, they have not changed the name of the country. In addition, they hold a Tingfeng Banquet every ten years. Next year will be the next full decade. At this time, not only will the East Sea Prefecture come, people from all prefectures and cities of Nandou will come. The heroes will aggregate and meet each other. You can't miss it.\"\"If all the strong men of Nandou are there, why should I go?\" Ye Futian asked.\"The stars of the banquet are your generation. The goal is to see the future of Nandou nation. The outstanding figures of Donghai Academy would definitely be included,\" Minister Zuo answered.\"Oh.\" Ye Futian nodded. He first thought of his professor's ailment. Since the Tingfeng Banquet was important, if the king noticed and liked him, it would be easier to heal Hua Fengliu, right?\"Oh, Xia Fan is the young master of the East Sea Prefecture. With his father there, I cannot deal with him directly. After returning, I must take care of some matters. To protect you from danger, I'll keep the Decree of the Minister with you. People will treat it as if I'm there.\" Minister Zuo gave Ye Futian his badge and said, \"You still have to be careful about assassinations.\"Ye Futian looked at the badge. He needed it but he did not accept it. \"Uncle Zuo,\" he said. He was still suspicious. Was Minister Zuo treating him so well really because he helped block the blow from the Snow Ape? He had defeated the princess with one blow because he was brash, but instead of blaming him, the minister had made the princess apologize too.\"Take it. This is useless for me. Just don't do bad things under my name,\" Minister Zuo said jokingly.\"Okay.\" Ye Futian nodded and took it. He would remember this gift. The badge was truly useful to him.\"Professor.\" The princess of Nandou looked at Ye Futian with jealousy. Who was the minister's true disciple?The group advanced forward and finally reached Donghai City. Minister Zuo personally saw Ye Futian to the academy.\"Futian, remember, don't miss out next spring. Your stage shouldn't be in Donghai City,\" Minister Zuo advised.\"Okay, Uncle Zuo. I'm going back now,\" Ye Futian said. Minister Zuo nodded and watched as Ye Futian entered Donghai Academy.\"Let's go back too,\" Minister Zuo said.But then, a figure walked out. He said before Minister Zuo, \"Greetings, Minister Zuo. I am Nandou Ku.\"\"You are from the Nandou clan?\"\"Yes, Minister Zuo. I have waited here for many days. My clan leader wishes for your help.\" Nandou Ku bowed.After pondering, Minister Zuo nodded. \"Since Nandou is inviting me, I will go with you.\"\"After you, Minister,\" Nandou Ku said politely. The group once again set off and soon arrived at the Nandou clan's home.Hearing that Minister Zuo had arrived, the clan leader personally welcomed him to the courtyard. Other than the two, there was also a beautiful girl. It was Hua Jieyu.\"Minister Zuo, this is a descendant of the Nandou clan. Could you please tell me her fate and fortune?\" the clan leader asked. Not many knew that Minister Zuo was an astrologer but he did.\"Okay.\" Minister Zuo nodded.\"Jieyu, please cooperate,\" the clan leader said. He had once asked Minister Zuo to calculate his but was rejected. Some things were better left unknown. However, Minister Zuo thought that Hua Jieyu was unimportant.Hua Jieyu looked at him. Since Minister Zuo was back safely, that guy should be back too. He had lied saying he would be back in one or two days.Minister Zuo walked to Hua Jieyu and cast his life chart. The light enveloped Hua Jieyu. After a count, Minister Zuo collected his life spirit. He was shocked. Staring at Hua Jieyu, he thought it was unbelievable. What kind of people were they? Why were their fates all so crazy?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 73": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Legend of FutianCH 73Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWhen the leader of the Nandou clan saw the serious look on Minister Zuo's face, he could not help but ask, \"How is it, Minister Zuo?\"\"I have some questions. May I speak with her alone?\" Minister Zuo asked.The Nandou clan leader nodded and left them alone.Minister Zuo looked at Hua Jieyu, a great beauty at the age of about 16, 17. She would not lose by too much in comparison with the goddess-like girl from Mount Tianyao days ago.\"Are you betrothed to anyone?\" he asked her.Hua Jieyu froze, then shook her head.Minister Zuo was silent, seeming to be deep in thought, but then he saw Hua Jieyu looking at him intently. \"Senior, the person you brought to the City of Qingzhou, is he back?\"\"Huh?\" Minister Zuo was confused. The person he brought to the City of Qingzhou?\"From Donghai Academy,\" she explained. Minister Zuo stopped to think for a moment and then his eyes brighten in realization. In his mind, he thought of the words a certain young man said, \"I already have a girlfriend and she's more beautiful than you.\"\"He's already returned to the academy.\" Minister Zuo smiled and nodded. She smiled as well, feeling the worry in her heart disappear.\"Brother Nandou!\" Minister Zuo called out. The Nandou clan leader returned upon being summoned and looked at the two people in the room in confusion.\"Goodbye,\" Minister Zuo said to the clan leader. Then, he turned with his hands joined to salute Hua Jieyu. This was not a gesture to a junior, but a gesture of respect and honor.The Nandou clan leader was shocked and asked, \"Minister Zuo, what does this mean?\"Minister Zuo just laughed loudly and with every step, he ascended in the sky. The head of the clan leader yelled out to him, \"Minister Zuo!\"\"The fate of an empress, the mother of the world!\" Minister Zuo's stern voiced traveled.\u00a0The family head was frozen in place and watched Minister Zuo get further and further away.The fate of an empress!His mind was anything but calm. At that moment, he thought of many things. Hua Jieyu was naturally gifted, that was why he had wanted Minister Zuo to tell her fortune. The clan leader wanted to know if she was going to be able to restore the Nandou clan's glory. But now, it seemed like she was destined for a different path\u2014the road to become an empress.Hua Jieyu was also shocked. She saw the family head looking at her, so she told him, \"I don't believe in fate and I also don't want to become Empress. I'm going back to the academy.\" When she finished, she turned and left....When Ye Futian got back to Donghai Academy, he could feel something different in the atmosphere. Everyone was whispering and discussing amongst themselves. And once he stepped onto campus, this atmosphere became more obvious.\"Ye Futian is back,\" said the students of the School of the Finance Star.\"He's finally back,\" said someone else. Many people seemed to have been anticipating Ye Futian's return. They all looked so happy to see him. This type of treatment was something new to Ye Futian. While he walked to his destination, people were greeting him.\"Hey!\" a beautiful girl called out to Ye Futian from the building of the Finance School above.Ye Futian turned his attention to the graceful girl. He knew her. She had made a lasting impression on him. Afterall, she was the first female to tell him that he wasn't a man. It was going to be difficult to forget someone like her.\"I have a name.\" Ye Futian smiled.She just stared at him and asked, \"What level are you now?\"\"Five-starred Glory Plane. You're not trying to fight me again, are you?\" Ye Futian was feeling uncertain. Were all girls crazy about fighting? One just left, now there was another.\"I won't fight you. The ones you have to fight are the people of the Emperor Star school and the Treasury Star school,\" the girl said. Ye Futian looked confused. More people came up to them.\"What happened?\" Ye Futian asked. He had just returned and the atmosphere at the academy felt strange.\"Junior Brother Ye Futian, the Finance Star school hasn't been doing too hot as of late,\" said a young man.\"Why is that?\" asked Ye Futian.\"Recently, the students of those two schools have been very arrogant. From time to time, they'll pick fights with the students of other schools, and our school is the most pitiful because they seem to be picking on us in particular,\" the young man explained.\"The students of the School of the Emperor Star and the School of the Treasury Star are stronger to begin with, so naturally the students of our school can't compete with them,\" said someone else. Ye Futian had gotten famous around Donghai Academy for fighting, so everyone from the Finance Star school was excited for him to be back.Ye Futian frowned. Both of those schools had previously paid a visit to Yi Xiang to congratulate him on taking on a disciple, now they were joining hands to torment the School of the Finance Star. There was definitely a secret involved in all of this. What did the two elders of those schools talk about with Yi Xiang that day?Ye Futian remembered that Yi Xiang came to reprimand him that day after their little chat. He seemed to be in a bad mood. Based on how things were going now, something definitely happened that day.\"Where's Yu Sheng?\" Ye Futian knew, with Yu Sheng's bad temper, he would not have just stood by and watched all of this happen.\"It gets me angry just talking about what happened,\" someone spoke. \"Because of this situation, Junior Brother Yu Sheng went to block off the entrance of the School of the Treasury Star. He beat up a ton of people, but those shameless jerks had two eight-starred Glory Plane cultivators gang up on him. One of those guys is the second strongest Glory Plane cultivator in their whole school. As a five-starred Glory Plane cultivator, Junior Brother Yu Sheng battled to his best ability, but was defeated in the end.\"Ye Futian had a fairly good understanding of Yu Sheng's powers. The three-level difference should not have been a problem, but his opponents were from the Treasury Star school; one of them was even known as the second strongest Glory Plane cultivator, so they were probably also naturally gifted to begin with. Yu Sheng was still not able to release his Life Spirit and show his true potential, so if they ganged up on him, it was understandable that he was defeated.\"Okay, I got it,\" said Ye Futian. He then began to walk back to his dorm.In the courtyard, Ye Futian could see Yu Sheng. He was topless, showing off his copper-toned skin, while Yi Qingxuan was applying medication to his wounds.\"You guys have already progressed to this stage while I was gone?\" Ye Futian blinked his eyes in disbelief and approached the two. Yi Qingxuan blushed and glared at Ye Futian. \"Stop joking around.\"\"Good going, Yu Sheng. You got the nerve to go pick a fight at the School of the Treasury Star as a five-starred Glory Plane cultivator? Why don't you go fight every student? You feel good about yourself?\" Ye Futian stared at Yu Sheng. \"How are your injuries?\"\"Nothing too bad. I'll be better in a couple of days. It's Yi Qingxuan who insisted on applying medication,\" said Yu Sheng, holding back a smile.\"Doesn't this kind of treatment make you want to go get hurt again?\" Ye Futian laughed. Yi Qingxuan rolled her eyes at his comment. \"If you want to get hurt, then go alone.\"\"You're so protective of him already?\" Ye Futian was speechless. Then, he asked her, \"Yi Qingxuan, what the hell is going on with the schools of the Emperor Star and Treasury Star?\"She turned serious at his question. \"I heard from Father that they're getting greedier for power and want to change the way the seven schools are run at Donghai Academy.\"\"How do they plan on doing that?\" He squinted his eyes in confusion.\"They want to be the top powers of Donghai Academy and for the seven schools to be joined together,\" said Yi Qingxuan.\"So, that's why they're sending their students out to pick fights?\" asked Ye Futian.\"Yeah, I think it's their way of making their wishes clear to the academy,\" nodded Yi Qingxuan. \"Their two schools have always been the strongest of the seven, and so most of the best students are gathered in those schools. Right now, there aren't many students from the other schools who can defeat them.\"Ye Futian nodded his head and turned to leave. \"I'm going out for a while.\"\"Where are you going?\" asked Yi Qingxuan. Ye Futian had just returned, where could he be off to again?\"I'm being a third-wheel here, don't want to disturb your time together,\" said Ye Futian. He waved and continued, \"I'm going to go see my girlfriend.\"Yi Qingxuan laughed. This guy was always joking around.Ye Futian headed to the School of the Emperor Star. When he left, he told Hua Jieyu that he would be back soon, but now, it had already been a couple of months. She must be worried sick.He walked up all the stairs to reach the School of the Emperor Star all the way at the top. The students there began to discuss amongst each other as soon as they saw Ye Futian at their school.\"What was he doing here now after leaving with Minister Zuo months ago?\" someone asked.\"I don't know. His powers are really strong. He was even able to defeat the disciple of Minister Zuo, but he still can't compare to our school's genius, Zhou Mu. I heard Zhou Mu has already gotten to the six-starred Glory Plane. If Ye Futian and Zhou Mu met then Ye Futian would be done for,\" Someone remarked.Ye Futian ignored all these comments. He was going to get revenge on the two schools later. Right now, his priority was to go see Hua Jieyu.He continued on his way up, and what was weird was, he actually ran into Zhou Mu.Zhou Mu looked at Ye Futian coldly. Next to him, was another young man.\"Ye Futian, it seems like you've come to a place you have no business being in,\" said Zhou Mu in a cold demeanor.\"I'm here to see the Grandmaster.\" Ye Futian smiled in return.\"So, what? The School of the Emperor Star is not a place that you can come and go as you please,\" Zhou Mu sneered.Ye Futian looked at Zhou Mu, he did not want to waste his breath with him. Ye Futian tried to walk past him, but the young man standing next to Zhou Mu shifted to the side to prevent Ye Futian from moving forward. The young man laughed, \"I've heard many good things about you, Junior Brother Ye Futian, but I never imagined you to be so rude.\"Ye Futian stared at him and was on his way again. His clothes blew in the wind, his aura domineering.The young man smiled weakly and the look in his eyes made a drastic change. The next moment, Ye Futian felt like he could not control his own spirit and was in pain. He stood in place and lifted his head. He stared at the young man next to Zhou Mu.\"Emperor Star disciple, Zhuo Qing.\" the young man introduced himself. \"Although Junior Brother Ye Futian's natural gifts are impressive, you should know that not everyone in Donghai Academy is like Jing Yang. I'm sure you've had a taste of Junior Brother Zhou Mu's powers at the Luo Palace. There are multiple students like Zhou Mu at the Emperor Star school, so if you continue to be so arrogant, you'll be the only one at a disadvantage.\"Zhuo Mu spoke with pride and he had the right to be. As a nine-starred Glory Plane cultivator, he was the most powerful person of the Glory Plane in the whole Emperor Star school. Some people even call him the number one sorcerer of Donghai Academy. His natural gifts were unbeatable.\"You're right,\" Ye Futian said with a smile. As he turned to leave, he spoke again, \"I hope the students of the School of the Emperor Star are truly as powerful as you said.\"Ye Futian was in such a rush to get to the school because he was afraid Hua Jieyu was worried about him, but since he was stopped on the way, then he could only use a different way to let her know he was back.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Why are you back?\" Yi Qingxuan asked with a smile.Ye Futian furrowed his brows. It was too shameful to say. \"Qingxuan, how is Zhuo Qing's skill?\" he asked.\"You met Zhuo Qing?\" Yi Qingxuan's pretty eyes went blank. Seeing Ye Futian's gloominess, she guessed what happened.\"Yeah.\" Ye Futian nodded.\"He's personally taught by the headmaster of the School of the Emperor Star,\" Yi Qingxuan answered. \"He's heavily valued and is already at the Nine-star Glory Plane. He's known as number one of Donghai Academy's dharma.\"\"His main abilities?\" Ye Futian asked.\"He's a spirit elemental mandate sorcerer with a strange life spirit. He has an eerie ability too. He can use the spirit element to control others. He's also good at the wood element and is extremely dangerous,\" Yi Qingxuan said.\"A controlling mandate sorcerer. No wonder.\" Something flickered past Ye Futian's expression. According to Yi Qingxuan, the other was a spirit elemental mandate sorcerer specializing in attack and control. Wood elemental sorcery was also known for being strong in controlling. With these two together, he could totally take control of someone.\"There should be some powerful figures in the Glory plane if the School of the Finance Star specializes in battle, right?\" Ye Futian asked.Yi Qingxuan looked at him and said, \"There are naturally those with extraordinary talents. There is a Nine-star Glory plane mandate sorcerer specializing in both martial arts and sorcery but it is still hard to defeat Zhuo Qing. There's a reason why he is number one of the Dharma rank.\"\"I understand, Qingxuan. Help me spread news that,\" Ye Futian smiled and said, \"even if I 'lost' last time at the Luo Palace, I've had a breakthrough in my planes. I will challenge Zhou Mu again tomorrow to continue the battle between my master, the Qin Devil, and the Art Saint. I hope the students of Donghai Academy will come witness it.\"Hearing this, Yi Qingxuan was confused. She asked, \"Didn't you say you didn't lose last time?\"\"Since they're saying I lost, then just play along.\" Ye Futian smiled confidently.Yi Qingxuan seemed to understand something. She glanced at the boy. \"You're so mean.\" Zhou Mu's reputation would be destroyed if he was defeated yesterday!\"Yu Sheng,\" Ye Futian called. The other glanced at him. \"How's your injury? Can you still fight?\" he asked.Yu Sheng grinned. \"No problem.\"Yi Qingxuan looked at them with sparkling eyes. She wondered what Ye Futian was planning. \"I'll go now,\" she said.Soon, the School of the Finance Star released news that Ye Futian would challenge Zhou Mu again tomorrow and invited everyone to watch. This time, Ye Futian said he would continue the past battle between the Qin Devil and Art Saint. It was clear that Ye Futian was extremely confident this time.The location was before the School of the Emperor Star.Zhou Mu's plane was higher than Ye Futian and this time was to continue an old battle. The reputations of their masters were involved too. It was impossible for Zhou Mu to turn him down.Donghai Academy was bustling. The news naturally traveled to the School of the Emperor Star. This time, everyone paid attention to the battle. Even the big figures were paying attention in the background....The next morning, sunlight fell onto Donghai Academy. The buildings were majestic under the glow. The School of the Emperor Star seemed like the strongest of Donghai Academy and dominated the other six schools. With this background, it naturally seemed more imposing. Today, many people gathered before it early in the morning. They were waiting for news and anticipating something.Many years ago, two legendary figures appeared from the School of the Emperor Star. They were the summoning artist, Art Saint, and guqin musician, the Qin Devil. The two were rare geniuses who fell for the same woman. The Qin Devil won the girl's heart but had his natal spirit destroyed and was forced away from the city.Many years later, their disciples were both cultivating in Donghai Academy.The disciple of the Art Saint who had won was still studying in the School of the Emperor Star and was cultivating with the headmaster. On the other hand, the Qin Devil's disciple was cultivating with the headmaster of the School of the Finance Star.As if this was destined, the Qin Devil's disciple challenged the Art Saint's disciple in his master's name. He seemed to want to reverse the past humiliation. However, Ye Futian had apparently already lost months ago at the Luo Palace. There was word that he had improved now but Zhou Mu had improved as well. Where did Ye Futian's confidence come from?Finally, someone strolled down from the School of the Finance Star.These days, the Finance Star students had been targeted by the Emperor Star and Treasury Star but could not fight back. Now, Ye Futian had returned and challenged Zhou Mu. The Finance Star students naturally had to come support him. They began waiting since the morning. When they saw Ye Futian come down, they went to him, creating a powerful group.Ye Futian walked in the front. He wore all white and carried a guqin. He was easy on the eyes.Tang Wan had been keeping an eye on this battle. Seeing Ye Futian come out like this, she was speechless. This guy\u2026Challenges happened occasionally in the academy but the attention on this duel between two Glory plane disciples was unprecedented. Tang Wan was impressed. But if the Qin Devil knew about this, he would definitely want to come watch.The spectators followed the group and even passersby joined in. The crowd grew bigger and bigger. The commotion was shocking. People who didn't know about it thought that it was a fight between all seven schools.Finally, the giant group arrived at the School of the Emperor Star. There was a similar crowd there waiting. Many of them looked at Ye Futian coldly.Someone said, \"A few months ago, Zhou Mu defeated him. Today, Zhou Mu can defeat him a second time. Let's see how he'll handle it after making such a commotion.\"The other students were all discussing this. Did Zhou Mu have the advantage or did Ye Futian have a better grasp on the battle?Ye Futian sat down before the school and placed his guqin before him. Soon, there was a graceful melody. Ye Futian was playing without regard to anyone else.In the pavilion, many big figures looked down coldly at the giant crowd. Ye Futian was just here to stir trouble.At this time, a group walked down from the school. Zhou Mu was one of them. His eyes were frigid. He approached Ye Futian step by step.The music stopped suddenly. Ye Futian looked up with clear and clean eyes at Zhou Mu. He smiled and said, \"I am Ye Futian, disciple of the Qin Devil, Five-star Glory plane.\" Ye Futian was fighting under the name of the Qin Devil's disciple. He had a guqin before him. The location was where the Qin Devil had once studied at. The significance went without saying. He was fighting for his professor.\"Zhou Mu, disciple of the Art Saint, Six-star Glory plane,\" Zhou Mu replied coldly.\"Please,\" Ye Futian said nonchalantly. Lowering his head, he thrummed the instrument strings. Music notes sounded. The strings and hearts all trembled. Since this was a fight for his professor, he would use musical spells.\"This piece is the Decree of the General.\" As soon as he finished, notes streamed out of the instrument endlessly. At this moment, a beautiful image appeared in everyone's minds. They seemed to have been transported to a battlefield. The war drums shook the sky as the soldiers went to war.Spiritual qi grouped around Zhou Mu. He used his finger as a brush to paint in the air.An invisible sound wave descended. It hit Zhou Mu in the front and knocked his painting down. At the same time, the sound wave pierced into his brain. His mind shook. Ye Futian's music spells were able to affect him now. Compared to last time, Ye Futian's skills seemed to have increased greatly.Zhou Mu's expression grew more serious. The spiritual qi grew more terrifying. He reached out and began multitasking. Both hands painted at the same time. He created a sword with a single stroke. It whistled through the air toward Ye Futian.However, an invisible strength gathered around Ye Futian now. The music notes transformed into a beating war drum. It was powerful like thousands of galloping horses. The sword flew here and shattered.Zhou Mu endlessly created swords that flew crazily to where Ye Futian was sitting. However, as soon as they got close, they would turn to dust. The area had turned into a battlefield. Ye Futian was like the general commanding the entire army.As the music intensified, a shocking music note storm gathered around Ye Futian. They did not dissipate and had a terrifying power. Swords whistled and clanged. Endless swords flew toward Ye Futian. However, the people only heard the war drums shaking the earth. The ground quaked and shattered the swords.\"Such terrifying musical spells. I don't know if Zhou Mu's demons will be able to resist it if Ye Futian keeps playing,\" someone said. The spectators could feel that Ye Futian's music notes were still gathering and strengthening. He seemed to be gathering a military with thousands of soldiers and horses; they would shatter everything with the general's decree.Finally, Zhou Mu finished. He had drawn a Golden Ape made completely out of gold. It ran toward Ye Futian. The earth shook with its steps.\"What a strong summoned beast. Ye Futian had given Zhou Mu time for him to wildly use his spiritual qi to draw.\" The spectators were nervous.The Golden Ape stepped into the storm around Ye Futian. There were giant booms. At that moment in the battlefield made of music notes, the war drums shattered everything. Thousands of horses galloped out. Everything in the path of the music storm turned to dust. The Golden Ape cracked endlessly but, just like last time, it still kept going toward Ye Futian.The ending, though, was different this time.Ye Futian kept playing. The endless power rolled past. With a boom, the Golden Ape's body was pulverized, turning into spiritual qi. Zhou Mu's expression changed drastically. His life spirit appeared behind him as he continued drawing.\"You really think you won last time?\" Ye Futian said nonchalantly. His fingers moved gracefully and he stood up. The moment he strummed the strings, the boundless music storm destroyed everything as if following the general's decree. It arrived before Zhou Mu, making it impossible for him to keep painting.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 75": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Legend of FutianCH 75Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe sound of Ye Futian's voice and the sound of guqin started simultaneously. The hearts of its listeners vibrated along with it.Zhou Mu, who was in the midst of drawing, lifted his head to see the storm created by the music dawning upon him. His Life Spirit roared and a wave of Spiritual Energy was released, but it was no use. The storm descended and destroyed everything in its path.His drawing was completely absorbed into the eye of the storm, and the Spiritual Qi in the atmosphere was flowing wildly. Then, the storm washed over Zhou Mu, which caused him extreme pain. It was as if he was a lone soldier, fighting against thousands. He spat fresh blood as his whole being was thrown back and made a harsh landing on the ground.Everything happened extremely quickly. Ye Futian stood up as if he was confident that the battle was already over. Only then did people break free of their dazed state and look at Ye Futian. The handsome young man stood there, his clothes blowing in the wind. The quiet, elegant young man playing the guqin just a moment ago was now unrestrained and ready to show his true potentials.The battle between the successors of the Guqin Devil and the Art Saint had come to an end. All those years ago, the Art Saint disabled the Guqin Devil's powers. Now, his disciple was crushed by the powers of the Guqin Devil's disciple. This was not a battle between equals, as the people had previously expected. What's more, Ye Futian was at a lower level than Zhou Mu. To be able to do so, Ye Futian has surpassed so many limitations placed upon him. And also, what was the meaning behind his previous utterance?Among the rumors spread in Donghai Academy, there was one that claimed after acting extremely arrogant at the Luo Palace, the Guqin Devil's disciple\u2014Ye Futian\u2014was defeated by the Art Saint's disciple, Zhou Mu. This rumor was the hottest talk in town at one point. If Ye Futian had come out to try to explain at an earlier time, probably no one would have believed him, but after seeing the results of this battle, it was hard not to question its validity. This was just like the rumors regarding Hua Jieyu months ago.Zhou Mu's face was as pale as a ghost. After getting himself together, he stood up. He looked at Ye Futian with an icy glare before saying, \"It's just one loss. This doesn't determine anything. You can't reject the results of the previous battle just because of the results of today's battle.\"Everyone was looking at Zhou Mu. It was evident that he did not want to admit defeat.\"How laughable,\" Ye Futian mocked him. \"After the rumors, you really thought that you were victorious over me at the Luo Palace? Did you know that an elder specializing in Spiritual Energy attacked me from the shadows just when I was about to finish you off? It was only because of this that you were not humiliated by me right then and there.\"The crowd became rowdy upon hearing Ye Futian's claim. An elder attacked Ye Futian at the Luo Palace and led to Zhou Mu's 'victory'? That was a low blow.Rumors said that day the Art Saint, Lord Luo, and the Vice Headmaster of the School of the Emperor Star were all present. If what Ye Futian said was true, then wouldn't that make these elders the three main suspects? If it were true, Ye Futian would have had no choice but to forfeit and leave.\"You're lying!\" Zhou Mu did not look too good after hearing what Ye Futian had to say. He refused to believe this.\"Preposterous!\" Just then, a voice sound from behind. It was the very elder from that day at the Luo Palace. He was Vice Headmaster Han Mo of the Emperor Star school.\"Ye Futian, even though you were victorious today, you have slandered your elders with utter disrespect,\" said Han Mo.Ye Futian lifted his head toward Han Mo. This old geezer was finally revealing his true colors.\"Of course, I knew that it could not possibly have been you who attacked me, but just because you won't doesn't mean others won't. How can this be considered slander?\" Ye Futian said, holding back a smile. The bystander's expressions all changed. There must have been a deeper meaning behind what Ye Futian said.Han Mo shot daggers at Ye Futian with his eyes. Ye Futian returned a calm gaze. Ye Futian was very unhappy with the School of the Emperor Star right now. He felt that this school was fake, hypocritical, overbearing, and cold.From allowing Mu Yunxuan to spread fake rumors regarding Hua Jieyu, to not allowing Ye Futian to enter the Emperor Star school. From siding with the Art Saint years ago in order to develop a beneficial alliance through marriage, leading to the demise of Hua Fengliu, to wanting to control all of Donghai Academy, which led to Yu Sheng being hurt.Although Ye Futian did not say anything, a burning rage started to grow in his heart. He was going to let it all go today. Now, he stood in front of the School of the Emperor Star, challenged Zhou Mu, and played the Decree of the General. All of this was to express his anger.\"Lord Luo and the Art Saint are both honorable seniors, and everyone there that day was of high social status. Would it even make sense for them to make a sneak attack on a junior like you?\" asked Han Mo mockingly.\"There were many people present at the time, so I cannot pinpoint the exact identity of the culprit. However, it was possible for two eight-starred Glory Plane cultivators from the Treasury Star school to gang up on a five-starred Glory Plane cultivator from the Finance Star school, so a sneak attack from respected elders is definitely possible, isn't it?\"\"This guy...\" stated a bystander. Everyone was looking at Ye Futian. By dragging the School of the Treasury Star into the conversation, Ye Futian was really trying to pick a fight.\"It was a student of your school who came to instigate the fight. Our students were simply giving him a well-deserved lesson. There's nothing strange about that,\" said Han Mo. \"You, on the other hand, have slandered your elders. If you do not give me a proper explanation, you won't be able to get off the hook that easily.\"\"Since when have my students needed to report anything to you?\" a voice came from within the crowd. Pushing through, Yi Xiang looked at Han Mo and said, \"Han Mo, you're the vice headmaster of the Emperor Star school, and you're here reprimanding a student from the School of the Finance Star? Now, that's impressive.\"The arrival of Han Mo and Yi Xiang frightened bystanders. It seemed that things had gotten out of hand.\"Headmaster Yi Xiang, did you not hear your student slandering his elders?\" asked Han Mo. He did not seem to be afraid of Yi Xiang at all.\"Is this true?\" Yi Xiang asked Ye Futian.Ye Futian smiled and said, \"It would be easy to determine whether it is slander or not. During that fight between Zhou Mu and I, I was defeated by a conjured beast. Even though I was at a bit of a disadvantage, we can try again today.\"He looked at Zhou Mu. \"Although I have made quite a bit of improvement over the past couple of months, I'm still going to draw up some conjured beasts. I won't release my Life Spirit and will use pure martial arts tactics. If I can't defeat you with one stack, then you can consider my words slander.\"\"He's so crazy!\" Everyone was watching Ye Futian. He was going to give Zhou Mu to conjure the strongest beasts, only use martial arts tactics, and try to defeat Zhou Mu with one attack. Ye Futian was beyond crazy. If Zhou Mu lost despite all this, he wouldn't be able to show his face around Donghai Academy. Especially since Zhou Mu never denied the rumors of him defeating Ye Futian. People took his silence as agreement.\"Do you have any opinions about this?\" Yi Xiang asked Han Mo.Han Mo's expression was dark. Ye Futian has already elevated the situation to this level, he couldn't say much about it. Han Mo looked towards Zhou Mu. Zhou Mu's expression was even darker. Everything Ye Futian had said was an insult to him.\"Fine.\" Zhou Mu took a step forward until he was directly facing Ye Futian. He released his Life Spirit and began to draw.Yi Qingxuan went up to collect Ye Futian's guqin. Ye Futian silently watched as Zhou Mu drew.Seeing how calm Ye Futian was, it was hard to imagine exactly where he got his confidence from. He was so confident that he was going to fight with just martial arts and was going to let Zhou Mu draw freely.Spiritual Qi gathered at the tip of Zhou Mu's pen. Right now, he looked so serious as he focused all his attention on his work. Gradually, it became clear to the people that Zhou Mu was drawing an extremely life-like golden dragon. It looked like it was about to fly into the skies at any moment.The giant golden dragon contained a frightening amount of Spiritual Qi. Zhou Mu even drew out the detailed scales of the dragon. It was so life-like and seemed to be so powerful. Onlookers began to worry for Ye Futian. Was he really going to be able to withstand Zhou Mu's attacks by using only martial arts?Zhou Mu ignored everything around him and focused on his drawing. He perfected every little detail. As the disciple of the Art Saint, his natural gift was not a question. It was only because his opponent was Ye Futian that he seemed weak.Finally, Zhou Mu added his last stroke. An enormous golden dragon revolved around his body. The light from Zhou Mu's Life Spirit doubled as a force field around the dragon. This made the dragon look even more menacing. It stared at Ye Futian.\"So powerful!\" Everyone was looking at the dragon and just one look was enough to give them a fright.Ye Futian looked calm as ever and reached out his hand. A golden orb of Spiritual Qi gathered in the palm of his hand. Slowly, the Spiritual Qi formed into a large golden rod. This was not considered sorcery, it was forming weapons from Spiritual Qi and belonged to the martial arts category.As soon as Ye Futian gripped the rod, a force of powerful rushed from his body. His intent of battle was shocking. An invisible force of power gathered in his body, growing stronger and stronger. Everyone could feel that the atmosphere around Ye Futian was now a little different. He was insufferably arrogant like a young war god.Zhou Mu made his move. He took steps forward and as if a part of his body, the giant golden dragon moved with him. A loud roar from Zhou Mu, and the mystical dragon was sent charging at Ye Futian.BOOM! Ye Futian also stepped forward. The ground vibrated under his feet. A frightening force gathered in his body.\"Die!\" yelled Zhou Mu in rage. The dragon was headed toward Ye Futian. Ye Futian waved the golden rod in his hand around. The Spiritual Energy became one with nature and was aimed for the golden dragon.The first attack of the Nine Heavenly Attacks, Genesis.The golden rod smashed down on the head of the golden dragon. Functioning like the sharpest weapon on Earth, the rod cut the body of the dragon in half. This scene sent a shiver down the spines of the people in the audience. The young war god was powerful as always and was going to destroy everything in his path. Even if it were a real dragon, he was going to split it in half.BOOM! The giant dragon exploded and the golden rod disappeared along with it. However, Ye Futian's hand was now wrapped around Zhou Mu's neck, lifting him off the ground.At this moment, Zhou Mu had a helpless expression on his face. Ye Futian lifted his head slightly and looked Zhou Mu in the eyes. \"How did you defeat me last time?\"Zhou Mu did not reply, because he couldn't reply.Ye Futian turned to face Han Mo. Peacefully, he said, \"This is the extent of the Emperor Star school's genius. From this day on, there will be no more battles of the Qin Devil and the Art Saint's successor because he, Zhou Mu, is not worthy.\" Finishing what he had to say, Ye Futian swung his arms and tossed Zhou Mu in the direction of the School of the Emperor Star.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 76": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Legend of FutianCH 76Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayEveryone watched as Ye Futian tossed Zhou Mu before the School of the Emperor Star pavilion. Seeing such a talent fall to the ground, they felt unsettled. Zhou Mu, disciple of the Art Saint, was currently cultivating with the headmaster of the School of the Emperor Star. But today, he was first defeated by Ye Futian's guqin and then wiped out by a stick. After this, there would no longer be any fights between the successors of the Qin Devil and Art Saint. Zhou Mu no longer qualified.The results could not be described using 'winner' and 'loser.' They were not even at the same level with Zhou Mu at a higher plane. Any battles in the future would be meaningless. Of course, this did not mean that Zhou Mu was not powerful. Ye Futian was just abnormal.At the top of the pavilion, a beautiful figure stood quietly. There was a smile in her eyes and it was breathtaking. If her father saw this, he must be very proud. However, the others' expressions were uncomfortable and even somber. Ye Futian had said that the School of the Emperor Star's prodigy was nothing much. The prodigy that cultivated with the headmaster of the school had been squashed.Ye Futian looked up to Han Mo and said, \"Senior, you witnessed the battle at the Luo Palace. Do you still think Zhou Mu has the ability to defeat me?\"Han Mo looked at Ye Futian. There was a cold glint in his sharp eyes.This guy doesn't leave any dignity for others, the spectators thought. He had used his powerful talent to prove that someone had attacked him secretly at the Luo Palace.Han Mo, who had accused Ye Futian of slander, now looked awkward. Some people were even wondering if this event had something to do with Han Mo.\"Perhaps you had purposely hidden your true ability that day,\" someone said in the group of Emperor Star students. It was Zhuo Qing\u2014the one Ye Futian had met yesterday. He had stopped Ye Futian from going to find Hua Jieyu at the school, thus resulting in this battle.\"Yes, perhaps I was too lowly and purposely hid my true ability and then spread rumors that I am not as good as Zhou Mu so I could slander him,\" Ye Futian said with a smile. Everyone became speechless. This guy was good at sarcasm.\"Junior Ye, you are acting so arrogantly before the School of the Emperor Star and even insulted my school. What do you want?\" Zhuo Qing glared at Ye Futian with burning eyes.Looking at him, Ye Futian smiled brightly. He said, \"According to the news, disciples of the Emperor Star and Treasury Star are constantly challenging the disciples of the School of the Finance Star recently. As a member of Finance Star, I, Ye Futian, wished to see how impressive the talents of the other two schools are.\"With that, the area fell silent. Ye Futian did not come today only to defeat Zhou Mu. After clearing the Qin Devil's reputation, he declared that he wanted to challenge the two strongest schools of Donghai Academy. He would block the door and challenge them!First, Yu Sheng had blocked the gate of the School of the Treasury Star. Now, Ye Futian would make camp outside the Emperor Star. He was mad!Han Mo's expression darkened and he sneered. He could not believe someone would do this to the Emperor Star. He asked coldly, \"How would you like to challenge us?\"\"Yu Sheng!\" Ye Futian called.Yu Sheng was prepared. He strode out and was beside Ye Futian quickly. When the two stood side by side, the others of Donghai Academy finally realized just how outstanding these two youths were. They had just entered this year and made a name for themselves through battles.\"I heard that a few days ago, two Eight-star Glory Planes from the School of the Treasury Star had teamed up to defeat my brother. So powerful, huh? Is there no one good enough to come out from the Treasury Star?\" Ye Futian said nonchalantly. He dragged the Treasury Star in. He needed to take revenge for Yu Sheng.\"Since he wanted to challenge us, he should have been prepared. Is he a sore loser?\" a powerful student from Treasury Star replied coldly after hearing the question.Ye Futian glanced at the other and smirked. \"If that's the case, I'd like to witness the power of the Eight-star Glory Plane prodigies. We are Five-star Glory Planes. I'm sure the Treasury Star won't reject our request, right?\"Ye Futian and Yu Sheng were both at the Five-star Glory Plane. Those who had defeated Yu Sheng were at the Eight-star Glory Plane. They had no excuse to reject Ye Futian.Two figures walked out of the Treasury Star crowd. They had just come to watch and did not expect to be involved by Yu Futian. Since this was the case, they could only humor Ye Futian.\"Leng Qiufeng from the Treasury Star.\"\"Jiang Kun from the Treasure Star.\"The two stood quietly and calmly. They were both at the Eight-star Glory Plane. Leng Qiufeng was also a mandate sorcery and extremely powerful. Yu Sheng and Ye Futian were powerful but they were at a much lower plane. The two from the Treasury Star were confident that if they worked together, they would definitely win.\"I hope you will be satisfied with the loss this time.\" Leng Qiufeng smiled as if mocking Ye Futian. As soon as he finished, Leng Qiufeng stood behind Jiang Kun. A terrible wind appeared on him. Not only did it descend onto his body, it also fell onto Jiang Kun. Then Leng Qiufeng shot into the sky. Jiang Kun was still on the ground, shrouded in wind.Seeing this, Ye Futian realized that Yu Sheng's defeat was understandable. Yu Sheng had not entered the dharma rank yet and could not fly.\"Yu Sheng, I'll support while you take revenge yourself,\" Ye Futian said.\"Okay.\" Yu Sheng nodded and stood before Ye Futian. Strong wind spirit gathered around Yu Sheng, wrapping around him. A dark gold armor appeared, covering his entire body. This was the strength of his element. The wind element was Ye Futian's.Aggressive power burst from Yu Sheng. He stepped forward to Jiang Kun over the shaking ground. Ye Futian followed closely. Beautiful golden wings appeared. Whish\u2026whish\u2026 The scary windstorm transformed into circular blades. They sliced down from Leng Qiufeng, whistling through the air.BOOM! Yu Sheng's footsteps thudded on the ground. He was filled with endless power. He punched and a gold fist broke through the air, shattering the flying circular blades.At the same time, a terrifying thunderstorm burst from Jiang Kun at the front. The shadow of a thunderbolt appeared on his body. It transformed into a humanoid shape. The brewing thunderbolt was full of pressure.Feeling the pressure of the spell, Ye Futian contacted with the metal element spirit, adding another layer of armor on Yu Sheng. The next moment, the thunderbolt's shadow descended. It fell onto Yu Sheng with destructive power. The thunder spell was able to slice someone apart with the thunderbolt's power.When the spell descended, Yu Sheng's armor was torn apart. Then it attacked Yu Sheng's dark gold body. Electricity ran through his body. His powerful muscles trembled but his steps did not falter.In the air, Leng Qiufeng scoffed. The next moment, Jiang Kun was wrapped in the wind spell and flew up too.\"Yu Sheng!\" Ye Futian called. The two worked together with tacit agreement. Yu Sheng jumped and sprang into the air. The powerful momentum was paired with Ye Futian's wind spell, helping him rush toward Jiang Kun like the wind.\"What a joke.\" Leng Qiufeng looked disdainful. With his supportive control, Yu Sheng would be unable to touch Jiang Kun. Even if he was extremely strong, he would not be able to use his skills.Ye Futian was spiraling up as his wings flapped. At this moment, the wings began glowing green and flapped crazily in the air. With a sound like a waterfall, Jiang Kun suddenly stopped in the air. He was stunned. Looking down, he saw vines on his body. Starting at his legs, they wrapped around him.\"It's the wood element!\" The spectators below were shaken. Since when was Ye Futian good at this?Leng Qiufeng's expression changed as well. This sudden change had interrupted his rhythm. He wanted to react but saw that Yu Sheng had already arrived and sent a fist at Jiang Kun.Jiang Kun was not a wind elemental sorcerer and was not good at flying. He needed Leng Qiufeng's control. How could he dodge this blow?There was a thud and one could faintly hear the sound of bones cracking. Yu Sheng was so strong that Jiang Kun spat out blood. Ye Futian used the vines to drag Jiang Kun back. He dropped to the ground and flung the vines. Jiang Kun smashed onto the ground, blood spurting out of his mouth. He shook uncontrollably.The people of Treasury Star looked at this with dark faces. They were so embarrassed.So violent, many people thought. Ye Futian was helping Yu Sheng vent his anger. The two Eight-star Glory Planes had worked together to beat Yu Sheng. Ye Futian was obviously pissed.Leng Qiufeng was stunned by this scene. He glanced at Ye Futian and Yu Sheng on the ground, his eyes turning frigid. He had never expected that Ye Futian would be a wood elemental sorcerer who specialized in control.\"An Eight-star Glory Plane talent of the School of the Treasury Star?\" Ye Futian mocked. Then he tossed Jiang Kun into the direction of his school's crowd without looking. Instead, he looked up into the air and said coldly, \"There's another one.\"BOOM! Chaotic power burst from Leng Qiufeng's body. A shadow appeared behind him. It was an extremely burly demon lion. It was entirely white and seemed to be made from stone. This was Leng Qiufeng's life spirit, the Stone Lion. It contained Leng Qiufeng's strong earth-elemental talent. It also provided him with terrible strength. Therefore, he also cultivated with martial arts. Other than that, he also had the wind-elemental talent. Thus, Leng Qiufeng was a wind and earth bi-elemental mandate sorcerer and martial artist.\"You will pay for this.\" Leng Qiufeng looked down at the two. The earth element spirit gathered around him, covering his body with stone armor. A stone spear appeared in his hands.\"He's a lot stronger than Jiang Kun,\" Yu Sheng said quietly.\"The ending will be the same,\" Ye Futian uttered. The Roc life spirit appeared behind him. The golden feathers had become so brilliant.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 77": "Chapter 77: Even the ScoreTranslator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo StudioLeng Qiufeng glared at the arrogant Ye Futian. Then, Wind and Earth bi-elemental Spiritual Qi gathered in front of him. A row of stone-tipped spears appeared, encapsulating the power of the wind.\"Attack!\" Leng Qiufeng commanded the spears. In a split second, the sorceries of Wind and Earth joined together within the spears and charged towards Ye Futian and Yu Sheng.Yu Sheng stood in front of Ye Futian, radiating a dim golden light. With a loud roar, Yu Sheng threw out his fists, and in the blink of an eye, the spears were destroyed.\"Go,\" said Ye Futian from behind. The sorcery of Wind descended upon Yu Sheng and he raced forward. With a single step on the solid ground, his body was launched into the air at the speed of light. In the same moment, because of the aid from Ye Futian's Wind Sorcery, Yu Sheng was able to ascend even higher into the sky and charged at Leng Qiufeng with full force. The shadows of a thousand fists approached Leng Qiufeng, ready to destroy everything in its way.\"This power...\" Everyone was speechless. A person's gift was truly dependent on fate. If Ye Sheng specialized in Wind Sorcery, he would never have lost against his two opponents the last time.Yi Xiang was very pleased to see Yu Sheng attack with the battle tactics he had learned. Yu Sheng seemed to be innately suitable for cultivation in all sorts of explosive tactics.\"Protection of Rock!\" said Leng Qiufeng. A large boulder appeared in front of him. This was an extremely powerful defense spell. However, after a loud explosion, the boulder was in pieces and Yu Sheng appeared in the air above him. However, Leng Qiufeng did not retreat. Even though Yu Sheng was like a monster, Leng Qiufeng was still of a higher level than him. Plus, Leng Qiufeng's Life Spirit was able to give him immense power.The image of a large Stone Lion overlapped on top of Leng Qiufeng's figure. The spear in his hand shot towards Yu Sheng. Around the tip of the spear, collected both Wind and Earth Spiritual Qi. The shadows of the thousand fists turned into stone and dissipated into ashes upon meeting with the tip of the spear.Yu Sheng descended with the force of a war god. His body emanated a forceful aura, golden thorns appeared on his arms and his fist was thrown out to meet the spear. However, before the two could even meet, Yu Sheng's arms froze. Then, the stone that had just formed on his arms were absorbed by the golden thorns. His body had turned into a sort of fearsome blackhole. Finally, as everyone watched in shock, Yu Sheng's fist finally met with the stone-tipped spear. His fist was seemingly even more powerful and stronger than the weapon.BOOM! After the loud commotion, Yu Sheng, who was previously protected by the shadows of a thousand fists, was now defenseless and bleeding. Though, Leng Qiufeng's spear was now destroyed as well. Both of the young men fell back in mid-air. Yu Sheng's arms shook. Ling Qiufeng was not doing too well either. The force of the thousand fists transmitted through the spear on to his arms, which were now numb.Just then, Leng Qiufeng felt something amiss. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw a flash of gold. The audience on the ground watched, wide-eyed. They saw a figure appear behind Leng Qiufeng. Vines appeared, blocking off Leng Qiufeng's exit. Then they began to wrap around his body rapidly.\"Wood Sorcery, the Lock of a Thousand Vines. How could a five-starred Glory Plane cultivator create such a fearsome effect?\" Onlookers watched as the vines appeared endlessly like frightening tentacles.Leng Qiufeng was then swept up in hurricane winds and brought higher into the sky. The powerful Wind Sorcery cut straight through the vines like a sharp blade. A sharp sound was emitted, and the jade-green vines now shone with a dim golden light. This made the vines stronger than before, but it was still no match for Leng Qiufeng's Wind Sorcery. Many of the vines were cut through with ease. However, the relentless vines were endless and continued to creep up Leng Qiufeng's body, wrapping him up tightly.Again, with the aid of Ye Futian's Wind Sorcery, Yu Sheng was carried up to where Leng Qiufeng was. Leng Qiufeng's expression changed and let out a scream. He struggled to get out of the vines. Yu Sheng threw his fist at Leng Qiufeng. The sloppy defense Leng Qiufeng put up was broken easily, and the punch landed on his chest.The vines disappeared. Yu Sheng now had Leng Qiufeng in his grasp. The two of them began to descend from the skies. Yu Sheng ruthlessly threw Leng Qiufeng into the ground. Another loud noise erupted, and the surface of the ground split open. Leng Qiufeng laid there, twitching, becoming one with the dirt on the ground.Ye Futian landed on the ground softly and stared at Leng Qiufeng coldly. To him, Ye Futian asked, \"Does it feel good fighting two on one?\"Last time at the School of the Treasury Star, Yu Sheng was defeated by Leng Qiufeng and Jiang Kun. Just now, Ye Futian and Yu Sheng joined hands to hand Leng Qiufeng a brutal defeat. Of course, Jiang Kun had already been defeated prior to this. Two five-starred Glory Plane cultivators challenged two eight-starred Glory Plane cultivators from the School of the Treasury Star and came out victorious.\"Two monsters,\" the people commented about Yu Sheng and Ye Futian. They shook in their shoes. The strength Yu Sheng possessed was inhuman. A lot of people had disagreed when others claimed Yu Sheng may be the most gifted martial arts student in all of Donghai Academy. But after the previous battle at the Treasury Star school and today's battle, there would not be a single person who could deny this fact any longer. Who else would possessive such explosive powers? It was not a question as to why Headmaster Yi Xiang of the School of the Finance Star, who specialized in combat, choose Yu Sheng to be his discipline.Ye Futian was equally as monstrous. A bi-elemental Mandate Sorcerer of Metal and Wind with a Roc Spirit. He was also a Musical Sorcerer. Furthermore, he had just revealed his gifts in the Wood element and also cultivated in martial arts. He was simply good at everything.Some people thought, could it be possible that Ye Futian is hiding his gifts in other elements as well? It was possible that the only person who was able to beat him in terms of elemental gifts was the girl genius from the School of the Emperor Star, Hua Jieyu. However, she would most likely be unwilling to make a move. Other than the time she was trying to get into the academy, she had not used her powers. Hua Jieyu also rarely stepped out of the Emperor Star school. The last time she came out on to the main campus was when she personally spoke up regarding the rumors about her and Mu Yunxuan.The School of the Treasury Star really lost all face this time, thought everyone in the crowd. They watched as Yu Sheng picked up Leng Qiufeng and threw him in the direction of the Treasury Star school. It was a direct, domineering, and slightly insulting action. It was obvious that Yu Sheng was unhappy with what had happened during their previous battle. His opponents were able to soar through the skies, while he was stuck on the ground, not even able to make contact with them.He was finally able to get payback today.\"This is the capability of eight-starred Glory Plane cultivators in the School of the Treasury Star? Stop making fools of yourselves at Donghai Academy,\" Ye Futian said calmly. The expressions on the faces of students of the Treasury Star turned more and more sour.Everyone was speechless upon hearing Ye Futian's words. He came today with revenge on his mind and was not going easy on them, whether it be the students of the Treasury Star school or the Emperor Star school. First, Ye Futian defeated Zhou Mu. Then, he assisted Yu Sheng in defeating Leng Qiufeng and Jiang Kun. What was he going to do next?At this moment, everyone saw Ye Futian walk to the side. He looked towards the School of the Emperor Star and said with a smile, \"I came here yesterday seeking my girlfriend but Senior Brother Zhuo Qing did not allow me to enter. He told me the Emperor Star school was full of genius cultivators and that I was no match for Zhou Mu. It was because of this that I came today. Sadly, I am disappointed by Zhou Mu abilities. Now that I have proved myself to be more capable than Zhou Mu, I am curious about the abilities of these other 'geniuses'. Both Yu Sheng and myself are five-starred Glory Plane students of the Finance Star school. Would any students of the self-proclaimed top school at Donghai Academy, the School of the Emperor Star, be willing to challenge us? If any students of the same plane are willing, you may choose to challenge either one of us.\"The students of the Emperor Star school did not know what to do. Same level cultivators to fight against these two freaks? It was possible that Hua Jieyu could give it try, but her schoolmates knew things that everyone else did not. So, they knew that she would never battle Ye Futian.The onlooking crowd was speechless. They all shared a thought about how shameless Ye Futian was. Two eight-starred Glory Plane cultivators had already lost to Ye Futian and Yu Sheng. Now, he was asking students of the same plane to challenge them. Wouldn't that be digging their own grave? However, there was nothing that the students of the School of the Emperor Star could complain about. They were the ones who bragged about housing many genius cultivators and claimed to be the top school of Donghai Academy. Asking to challenge students of the same plane should not be considered too out of line. Also, Ye Futian's girlfriend was in the Emperor Star school? What was going on?\"If that's not possible, I'll also accept six-starred Glory Plane cultivators,\" Ye Futian said with a smile when he noticed that no one was willing to answer him.Han Mo's expression darkened. Six-starred Glory Plane cultivator? Zhou Mu already tried. Defeated with one rod.\"Then what about seven-starred?\" Ye Futian continued, \"Yesterday, Senior Brother Zhuo Qing said that the Emperor Star school was packed full with geniuses. What's going on today?\"Everyone turned their attention towards Zhuo Qing, only to see the normally gentlemanly Zhuo Qing with a dark face. He forced a smile and said, \"Junior Brother Ye, since you're trying to provoke my fellow schoolmates into a challenge, what's the need to bring up planes?\"\"So, what Senior Brother Zhuo is trying to say is that I should ignore planes and fight against students four, five planes above me? Maybe even those in the Dharma Plane?\" Ye Futian laughed. \"Is this what the students of your school have been doing to my fellow schoolmates these past days? Why don't you try to challenge Dharma Plane students in my school, Senior Brother?\"Zhuo Qing had nothing to say once again. The students of the Emperor Star school all stared coldly at Ye Futian. They were getting anxious under his questioning.\"If nobody has the guts to come out and challenge us, then I hope that the students of the Emperor Star school will stop being so brazen, coming to pick on the weaker students of my school,\" warned Ye Futian when he saw that nobody was going to speak up. Only when he said this, onlookers realized his true intentions: to stop the School of the Emperor Star from attacking the students of the Finance Star school.\"I know that Junior Brother Ye possesses extraordinary gifts, and has once said that I would like to see them for myself. So, I am willing to be thick-skinned and step out to challenge you as an eight-starred Glory Plane cultivator, but if you are here simply to give empty threats, then please leave,\" said a figure as it stepped out. A handsome young man, one of the \"geniuses\" in the Emperor Star school, walked towards Ye Futian and introduced himself, \"Student of the School of the Emperor Star, Mu Yunxuan. Eight-starred Glory Plane.\"As soon as he heard this name, Yu Sheng took a large step forward. His body radiated a powerful force.\"Yu Sheng,\" called Ye Futian. Yu Sheng halted.\"Let me,\" said Ye Futian. Yu Sheng nodded and retreated.Ye Futian looked at Mu Yunxuan. A sarcastic smile spread across his face and he continued, \"You're not just thick-skinned. I feel ashamed simply attending the same academy as you.\"\"You!\" Mu Yunxuan broke his fa\u00e7ade immediately. His expression darkened.Ye Futian stood quietly and a powerful aura emanated from him. His clothes moved without wind. \"Since you have the guts to step up, then I'll also settle the incident of you spreading rumors about my girlfriend. Let's even the score today,\" said Ye Futian calmly. After he spoke, there was silence.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 78": "Chapter 78: Face It Holding HandsTranslator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo StudioMu Yunxuan had hurt Ye Futian's girlfriend while spreading rumors? Earlier, Ye Futian had also said that his girlfriend was from the School of the Emperor Star. Thinking of the rumors that had spread around Donghai Academy earlier, everyone stared at Ye Futian.Months ago, that fairy-like figure had walked down from the School of the Emperor Star and announced to the entire academy that there was nothing between her and Mu Yunxuan. She had said that Mu Yunxuan could not even be compared to the one she liked.They had thought about whether someone that talented really existed in the academy. Today, Ye Futian had blocked the gate and challenged the School of the Emperor Star. He was so mad. With what he just said to Mu Yunxuan, it was easy to link the two events.Everyone's hearts trembled. They slowly looked over toward the School of the Emperor Star. Behind all the students, they saw a beautiful figure standing quietly at the high point. She stood alone, and it seemed that wherever she was, everything else would lose color.Now, the beautiful figure moved. She slowly walked down. The other students quickly moved aside and watched her. There was some yearning in their hearts but they knew it would be an impossible dream.Hua Jieyu walked down the steps and entered the battlefield. She walked past Mu Yunxuan. The boy looked to the side at the scene. There was lust deep in his eyes. Every time he saw this beauty, his heart would be shaken but he did not exist in her eyes. She had even embarrassed him in front of the entire academy. Hua Jieyu stood before Ye Futian. Her eyes gazed at him without blinking.\"Jieyu, fight with him,\" Han Mo said behind them. His expression was so dark and gloomy. However, Hua Jieyu completely ignored him. She kept staring at the youth's figure, thinking how impulsive he was.\"Why are you looking at me like that?\" Ye Futian stared back at Hua Jieyu and shrugged.\"Why do you think?\" Hua Jieyu said sharply. She sounded angry but was also whining. Though she was glaring at Ye Futian, there were rich emotions inside her beautiful eyes.Many people felt their hearts breaking. There had been rumors before but they were only rumors. Now, they personally witnessed the fairy of Donghai Academy talk and look at Ye Futian like a little girl. It was a peculiar feeling. With just one sentence and one glance, they experienced the feeling of dating. Many felt moved but sadly, the voice and eyes were for Ye Futian, not them.\"Didn't I say that I'll announce it to Donghai Academy?\" Ye Futian said with a smile. \"You're so pretty and everyone keeps thinking about you. It pisses me off. Today's the best chance to tell them that you're mine and they can just be jealous.\"Many faces became long at this. Hearing Ye Futian's words, they suddenly wanted to beat him up. This b*stard was doing it on purpose. Hua Jieyu was the girl of their dreams!\"Idiot,\" Hua Jieyu reprimanded, still glaring. After that, she continued forward. When she was beside Ye Futian, she reached out gently. Then, under everyone's eyes, she grabbed Ye Futian's hand to announce their relationship publicly.Hua Jieyu turned to the side and tilted her head up to look at Ye Futian. A smile bloomed on her face; it was so intoxicatingly beautiful.\"Are you satisfied now?\" Hua Jieyu smiled gently. Since Ye Futian chose not to keep it a secret, she was willing to face it with him. No matter what would happen in the future, they would face it together, hand in hand, just like now. Minister Zuo had said that she had the fate of an empress. She did not believe in fate. Even if she had this fate, she would change it, she believed.Seeing the smile on the girl's face and those gentle words, Ye Futian's smile was also warm. The most beautiful promise was no better than that. The most beautiful girl was no better than the Fox's smile. So what if he had seen a girl even more beautiful at Mount Tianyao? His godfather had said that his woman would be the empress of the world. If that really happened, his fox's temperament was enough to rule and impress the world.\"Yes, very satisfied.\" Ye Futian smiled and nodded. This feeling was amazing.\"Hey, are you guys done?\" someone finally called out, feeling tortured by the public display of affection.\"I feel like I just got dumped. My heart hurts,\" someone muttered, a hand to his chest.\"Psh.\" In the Finance Star crowd, Yi Qingxuan, who was standing beside Yu Sheng, laughed out loud. Ye Futian was seriously going full out with his affection. However, it was beautiful. Yi Qingxuan knew that even though they were smiling and holding hands, there was a heavy burden on this relationship. But despite it, they would face it together.Thinking of this, Yi Qingxuan also reached out and touched the arm beside her.Yu Sheng glanced at her and asked, \"What's wrong?\"Yi Qingxuan looked up him with her pretty eyes. Yu Sheng scratched his head. He did not understand the girl, making her so angry she stomped on Yu Sheng's feet. The boy blinked and looked away. Just as Yi Qingxuan fumed, a big muscular hand wrapped around her small hand. In an instant, her heart seemed to melt and she smiled like a flower. It seemed that this guy was not so insensitive. He had learned a lot from Ye Futian.In the direction of the School of the Emperor Star, a beautiful figure was watching the two holding hands with smiling eyes. It was Shu Yuyan. She was the one who understood Hua Jieyu the most in the school. Only she knew how much Hua Jieyu really cared about the boy. Jieyu had overlooked all the talents in the School of the Emperor Star and become nervous because of the boy's every action. She was practically a fairy but would become an ignorant little girl once Ye Futian was mentioned.However, the others were not so happy. Ye Futian had become to disgrace them. He had defeated Zhou Mu and humiliated the school. Now, he had snatched away their goddess\u2014the top beauty of Donghai Academy. Their hatred toward Ye Futian was obvious.\"B*tch,\" a dissonant voice rang out. Mu Yunxuan's face had darkened to the extreme. He looked menacing. His love for Hua Jieyu was no secret because he had not rejected it when Han Mo wanted to use him for the rumors. The relationships between people were strange. When enough people spread the rumors, the other would take notice. Maybe it would become true. However, he never expected that Hua Jieyu and Ye Futian would have been dating already and be so in love.Hua Jieyu had felt disgusted from the rumors, thus leading to everything else.When the goddess he adored publicly humiliated him, telling him to scram, he had endured it. But now, seeing Hua Jieyu act affectionately to Ye Futian with his own eyes, he finally could not take it anymore. Evil thoughts burst within him and he uttered a word he should not have.Even if Ye Futian had come to mess with the School of the Emperor Star, it was a just fight. However, when Mu Yunxuan, star of the school, said that word to Hua Jieyu, the starlet, it was grating to the ear.Many cold stares turned toward Mu Yunxuan. They were filled with hatred. Though they were envious of Ye Futian, they could feel the true love between the two as they stood together, so the people still felt happy for them deep down. However, Mu Yunxuan's curse had revealed his personality. Just as Ye Futian had said, cultivating with someone like Mu Yunxuan was a disgrace.Hua Jieyu's expression changed. No woman could take being insulted with that word, let alone someone like Hua Jieyu. Ye Futian's heart twinged and felt a chill. However, he repressed his anger and said gently, \"Leave it to me.\"\"Okay.\" Hua Jieyu nodded and stepped back.When Ye Futian glanced at Mu Yunxuan, his eyes were filled with a terrifying coldness and murderous intent.\"Ye Futian, disciple of the School of the Finance Star, Five-star Glory Plane, now challenges Mu Yunxuan. Life and death, will you accept the challenge?\" Ye Futian said coldly. Everyone's hearts shuddered. Ye Futian had challenged him to a fight of life and death.Crazy, everyone thought. However, if they had a lover like Hua Jieyu, they would not allow anyone to insult her either. No wonder Ye Futian was furious.Mu Yunxuan clenched his fists with a sneer. Ye Futian, a Five-star Glory Plane, dared to start a life and death challenge with him? Earlier, Ye Futian and Yu Sheng had worked together to defeat two Eight-star Glory Plane students. In his opinion, Ye Futian was the reinforcement while Yu Sheng was the most powerful. If a Five-star was willing to fight, what could an Eight-star Glory Plane like Mu Yunxuan fear?\"Prepare to die.\" Mu Yunxuan's expression was so cold. As soon as he finished speaking, a gust of violent wind gathered around him. Then his eyes turned gold; they were extremely sharp.Ye Futian cast his life spirit. The Golden Roc appeared and it was beautiful. At the same time, there was a terrifying spiritual Qi windstorm. It transformed into a golden cane in his hand. Seeing it, many people shivered with fear. It was the one that had defeated Zhou Mu with a pure martial arts attack.Now, Ye Futian was going to fight for life or death. He would obviously fight at a different level from before.His wings flapped powerfully and he instantly shot to the sky. The spiritual Qi of wind was on him, transforming into a spell. He could fly with the golden Roc alone but now, he added the wind spell to it. His speed was terrifying.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 79": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Legend of FutianCH 79Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayCountless eyes landed on Ye Futian who was up in the air. At this moment, he looked magnificent. He was a handsome young man to begin with. Now that the Golden Roc has been released and wings had appeared on his back, Ye Futian seemed to be basking in a divine light. In his hand was a golden rod, and he was bursting with power. Perhaps, if he gave it all he got, Ye Futian would really be capable of fighting against Mu Yunxuan, despite the three-plane difference between the two. Everyone around shared this thought as they watched Ye Futian challenge one of the School of Emperor Star's genius cultivators.Mu Yunxuan's golden pupils narrowed on Ye Futian. Then, his Life Spirit was released. A golden Demon Cat appeared. Its eyes were even more demon-like than those of Mu Yunxuan. Those eyes had the ability to make people feel uncomfortable when looked at.A golden storm gathered in front of Mu Yunxuan and formed sharp golden swords, long and thin. As the swords circled Mu Yunxuan, a low whistling of the wind was heard. This was no ordinary Metal Elemental Sorcery, but an extreme control of the Metal Spiritual Qi.Mu Yunxuan was mainly a Mandate Sorcerer of the Spirit element. His spiritual energy had a much stronger control over Metal Spiritual Qi than most people. Even a common nine-starred Metal Sorcerer would not be able to control Metal Spiritual Qi like Mu Yunxuan could. With this extraordinary ability, Mu Yunxuan did not even need to cultivate in martial arts. His powers in the element of metal were sufficient enough to attack and defend.\"Mu Yunxuan is definitely more powerful than Leng Qiufeng. Will Ye Futian really be able to withstand this battle?\" asked someone in the crowd. Witnessing the release of Mu Yunxuan's powers had many people lose the confidence they previously had on Ye Futian. The golden storm surrounding Mu Yunxuan was too frightful. The sharp swords revolved around him, controlled as if they were toys.Han Mo stood quietly in the School of the Emperor Star and observed. Obviously, he could see just how gifted Ye Futian was, but the young man now stood against the school, so they must get rid of him. Since Ye Futian personally proposed a life or death battle, it saved the school a lot of trouble.\"Since you're asking for it, I'll let you die,\" Mu Yunxuan said with a cold demeanor. Just as he finished his sentence, the swords around him whistled through the wind and shot towards Ye Futian. In perfect unison, these swords were much more powerful than those drawn by Zhou Mu. After all, there was a huge difference in regards to the planes Zhou Mu and Mu Yunxuan were in.The golden rod danced in Ye Futian's hand. He tried to take a step forward when a large force erupted, and the wings appeared on his back. Just like a flash of lightning, Ye Futian shot up into the sky.Mu Yunxuan hmphed and directed his attention up above. The swords immediately altered their route to continue in their attack on Ye Futian. Even though Mu Yunxuan did not specialize in the element of wind, he was not afraid to face a sorcerer who could fly.Ye Futian moved at an incredibly fast speed. His every movement was graceful like a real roc. He zipped through the clouds in the sky but the swords followed relentlessly.At this moment, the force building up in Ye Futian's body was growing stronger. An equally strong force from the golden storm chased after him. The golden rod he held grew thicker.\"Until when do you plan to keep running away from me?\" Mu Yunxuan asked coldly. Immediately after he spoke, Ye Futian appeared in the air right above him. Ye Futian was no longer dodging the attacks. He held the enormous golden rod and struck downward. Just then, the atmosphere around and even the world seemed to be shaken up. Onlookers almost could not see Ye Futian's figure. To them, there was only the shadow of a rod coming down from the heavens to wipe out everything below.The ferocious swords were no more, turned into ashes by the rod. Mu Yunxuan lifted his head and saw Ye Futian coming for him. After this quick glance, the Demon Cat behind him had a fierce look in its eye. The crazed golden storm recollected into a giant sword. With a scary glint in his eyes. Mu Yunxuan screamed, \"KILL HIM!\" The giant golden sword shot upward into the sky.BOOM! The rod and the sword collided. The golden sword had been destroyed. A powerful force pushed Mu Yunxuan back, but he managed to stop Ye Futian's attack. It halted in mid-air. The force was still there. Ye Futian's golden wings flapped and he flew in the skies. Suddenly, the force within began to build up once again, exceeding the prior.Mu Yunxuan sensed what was happening, and the look on his face changed. He put out both of his hands. The golden storm started once more and formed a pattern, shielding him. At the same time, strains of golden silk sliced through the air, attacking Ye Futian. This spell was protecting and attacking all at once.Ye Futian remained emotionless. He soared through the air and then formed into lightning, hitting down on Mu Yunxuan again. Mu Yunxuan's spell, Winding of a Thousand Silk Strains, advanced towards Ye Futian, but a golden light barricaded him, not leaving space for anything to get past.Finally, Ye Futian descended upon Mu Yunxuan. Ye Futian attacked with the second attack of the Nine Heavenly, ready to destroy everything in his way.BOOM! Mu Yunxuan's golden pattern exploded and a powerful force forced him to slide backward on his own two feet.Right now, the expression on everyone's face has changed. They were utterly shocked.What kind of battle technique was this? It was so domineering, wiping out everything in its way. It was as if one attack could kill any enemy you pleased, not leaving any survivors.Ye Futian was truly a young war god at this moment. Not only did his powers not diminish after two attacks from Mu Yunxuan, but he got even stronger. Upon sensing the crazed energy gathering within Ye Futian, everyone from the School of the Emperor Star had a change in expression. Even Vice Headmaster Han Mo did not look too well. Ye Futian's second attack with the rod was obviously stronger than the first. If there was another even stronger attack, there was no way Mu Yunxuan would be able to withstand it.A prepared Ye Futian advanced. He unleashed his power, which caused Mu Yunxuan to blanch. With a loud scream, My Yunxuan used Metal Spiritual Qi in a spell which summoned a large ancient bell to encapsulate himself. He had given up on attacking and focused solely on his defense.Ye Futian charged ahead at full speed and delivered his third blow. Without any hesitation, the golden rod struck the ancient bell. The bell rang and then cracked. What followed were the blood-curdling screams of Mu Yunxuan. After the rod broke through the bell, it landed on Mu Yunxuan, throwing him onto the ground. His body slid across the ground, and blood flowed from his mouth. In an instant, the color in his face was gone. It was obviously, Mu Yunxuan could no longer battle.\"This...\" the people did not know what to say. Their hearts pounded in their chest. Ye Futian was too violent. Looking at his figure, Ye Futian looked majestic and furious. The aura around him made it clear that anyone who tried to stop would only have one result\u2014death.\"He's so powerful.\" Many people were excited by this scene. Ye Futian was a great example of how a true man should act.Just then, many people remembered Hua Jieyu's words. She had said that Mu Yunxuan was not worthy of being compared to the person she liked. A lot of people doubted her words. Was there really someone like that at Donghai Academy? Maybe she was simply blinded by love. However, when the person she liked faced Mu Yunxuan in battle and completed destroyed him despite being three planes lower, everyone finally understood that Hua Jieyu had not been exaggerating. Whether it be giftedness or actual ability, Mu Yunxuan was truly unworthy of being compared to Ye Futian. Perhaps only a person like Ye Futian was suited to stand beside the goddess Hua Jieyu.As Ye Futian approached Mu Yunxuan, one step at a time, many from the School of the Emperor Star had a change in expressions. This battle was a matter of life or death. Mu Yunxuan had already agreed to these terms.Mu Yunxuan held himself up with his hands on the ground as he looked up at Ye Futian. Blood dripped from the corners of his mouth. With a crazed look in his eyes, he stared at Ye Futian and said, \"This is the School of the Emperor Star, you dare to commit such a sin here?\"\"Get down on your knees and apologize. I will spare your worthless life then,\" Ye Futian said to Mu Yunxuan coldly.Mu Yunxuan looked even more crazed now. Ye Futian wanted him to kneel down and apologize?\"Are you done with this nonsense?\" Han Mo approached. His aura was forceful as he stared at Ye Futian.\"This is a battle to the death. Have you been watching, Senior?\" Ye Futian lifted his head to look at Han Mo.\"You are standing on the Emperor Star school's territory,\" said Han Mo. Suddenly, Ye Futian began to laugh. Mockingly, he said, \"If it were Mu Yunxuan who was victorious today, you probably would not hesitate to kill me.\"Naturally, Han Mo had nothing to say to that.Seeing the Vice Headmaster step in, Mu Yunxuan let out a laugh. \"You can't kill me now, Ye Futian. Do you really think that you and that b*tch will have a happy ending?\"Ye Futian looked down at him. Mu Yunxuan was laughing like a madman. He had obviously been deeply affected by his defeat today. He deepened his voice and said, \"With those looks, that b*tch will definitely end up as someone else's plaything in the future.\"\"You're calling out for death.\" Ye Futian clenched his fist around the golden rod. Then, he lifted his arm, ready to strike down at any moment.\"Vice Headmaster,\" Mu Yunxuan called to Han Mo as he turned to look at the elder. Han Mo took another step forward. The headmaster spoke, \"Ye Futian, do you want to die?\"Ye Futian reached his left hand into his shirt and pulled out a badge. He tossed it to Han Mo. Han Mo scrunched his face as he caught the object. Upon realizing what he had in his hands, his expression fell. He mustered in a low voice, \"The Decree of the Minister.\"\"Minister Zuo has said, seeing the badge is the same as seeing him. People from the seven schools of Donghai Academy have witnessed our battle to the death today. So, I will take his life now.\" The golden rod Ye Futian held in struck down. Mu Yunxuan was horror-stricken. As he watched the rod come down, several thoughts crossed his mind. He opened his mouth, wanting to say something, but never got the chance to.BANG! The golden rod came down directly through Mu Yunxuan's head.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Countless gazes fell on Ye Futian and the figure who was unmoving on the ground beside him\u2014Mu Yunxuan.That strike had not only hit Mu Yunxuan's body. It seemed to have hit everyone's hearts, making all of them shudder. Mu Yunxuan, top student of the School of the Emperor Star, the disciple of Han Mo, had just been killed before the school.Ye Futian had really dared to strike.Han Mo looked up and glared at Ye Futian. When he received the minister's degree, his heart had wavered and he had hesitated but then his disciple was killed.\"With Minister Zuo supporting you, you committed murder in Donghai Academy. Good job, Ye Futian,\" Han Mo said coldly, tossing the minister's decree to him.\"Senior, you can ask your own conscience who wants to kill whom?\" Ye Futian replied indifferently. He was very sensitive and could sense how Han Mo and Mu Yunxuan wanted to kill him. Even so, he had never planned on doing this. Mu Yunxuan should not have angered him so many times.Hua Jieyu had confessed to him before leaving Qingzhou City that she would wait patiently for him in Donghai Academy, worry over his every move, and face everything with him. But Mu Yunxuan had insulted her like that and Ye Futian could not allow it.\"Clean it up,\" Han Mo said coldly. He turned and walked toward the School of the Emperor Star. The others quickly carried Mu Yunxuan away. Many glared at Ye Futian before scurrying away.Today, the School of the Emperor Star had lost all dignity. In this fight of life and death, prodigy Mu Yunxuan was killed on the spot by Ye Futian.The students of the other schools studied Ye Futian. He was too crazy. His talent was intimidating and after he left with Minister Zuo, he had received the man's favor. He even had the minister decree; it was obvious how highly the minister thought of him.In Donghai Academy, barely anyone's talent could be compared to him. There was Yu Sheng, a natural-born warrior, and Hua Jieyu, the starlet of the School of the Emperor Star. The former was Ye Futian's best friend who had entered the school with him and seemed to be very obedient; the latter was his girlfriend.Now, Hua Jieyu walked to Ye Futian's side. She lightly pulled on his hand. Ye Futian glanced over and saw her.She asked quietly, \"Why were you so brash?\" She obviously understood that Ye Futian had done so because he was angry for her. She hated Mu Yunxuan but she also knew that Ye Futian would become the enemy of the Emperor Star because of this.\"If anyone says that to you again, I'll act the same way,\" Ye Futian said with a smile.Hua Jieyu lowered her head. She felt warm and fuzzy inside. \"I'll go bid farewell to my grandmaster. I won't cultivate here anymore.\"\"Okay.\" Ye Futian nodded. \"What about the future?\"\"I have you, don't I?\" Hua Jieyu looked at him with a smile.\"Okay.\" Ye Futian returned the smile.\"I'll go now,\" Hua Jieyu said quietly. Ye Futian nodded and let go. Hua Jieyu walked toward to the school to bid farewell with her teacher. Since her lover was now against the Emperor Star, she naturally could not remain there.Ye Futian turned and walked toward the School of the Finance Star. His fellow disciples all looked at him with some respect. Today, Ye Futian had helped them vent their anger.\"Headmaster, I caused trouble for you,\" Ye Futian said to Yi Xiang.\"You already killed him. There's not much to think now,\" Han Mo said nonchalantly. \"If you didn't kill him, he would kill you. Just as you said, if you had lost before, Han Mo would definitely want you dead and I wouldn't be able to save you either. So, instead of letting them think about how to deal with you, challenging them straightforwardly isn't that bad.\"Ye Futian eyed Yi Xiang. His headmaster was so agreeable this time.\"Let's go.\" Yi Xiang began walking away. Ye Futian walked beside him and the other students followed behind. Seeing them leave, the spectators dispersed as well though they still had not calmed down. They had a feeling something would happen in Donghai Academy soon. It was not just a sudden conflict between the School of the Emperor Star and Ye Futian but a long-time rivalry. However, they finally realized just how strong the youth was. If he could survive, he would definitely become something impressive.On the way back to their school, Yi Xiang, Ye Futian, Yu Sheng, and Yi Qingxuan walked in the front. Yi Xiang said lightly, \"Your reason of challenging the Emperor Star wasn't so simple today.\"Ye Futian looked up. Yi Xiang continued, \"Forcefully defeating the disciple of the Art Saint, blocking their gate, revealing your talent, and expressing your attitude toward Hua Jieyu\u2026 Are you trying to prove something to the Nandou clan?\"Ye Futian's eyes flashed. Yi Xiang said, \"With the talent you showed off today and the minister's decree, the Nandou clan will definitely pay attention now.\"\"Headmaster, I don't want that either.\" Ye Futian shook his head and smiled wryly. Since the School of the Emperor Star had suspected his relationship with Hua Jieyu, the Nandou clan obviously did too. It was better to make things clear now since it would come out sooner or later.Ye Futian looked forward and said, \"I don't expect to be accepted by the Nandou clan but I do hope I can win some time for Fox. After a few years, it won't matter if they agree or not.\"\"Well, you're confident,\" Yi Xiang said lightly. \"What about your other motives? Just confess.\"\"Uh\u2026\" Ye Futian looked at Yi Xiang. Was this man really so sensitive?Yi Xiang sneered and said, \"Since Minister Zuo gave you the minister decree, his attitude toward you is obvious. He must have told you to go to the royal city. That's why you're not scared about making trouble here. You can just leave, after all. Thus, you decided to make it even bigger and help the Finance Star. Is it to thank me?\"Ye Futian looked at him, speechless. The man really knew his stuff.\"When are you leaving?\" Yi Xiang asked.\"Minister Zuo wants me to attend next spring's Tingfeng Banquet,\" Ye Futian said.\"Stay in the School of the Finance Star and cultivate obediently. Don't go out anymore and I'll take you there personally next year,\" Yi Xiang said, facing forward.Ye Futian looked at the serious side profile and smiled. This old guy always had a stern face but after interacting more, Ye Futian realized he was pretty lovable too.However, they did not know that things were never as one expected....A while after Ye Futian returned to the School of the Finance Star, Hua Jieyu went over as well. Seeing the figure that appeared in the yard, Ye Futian smiled gently.Hua Jieyu seemed down. She walked over to Ye Futian and looked at him with her pretty eyes.\"What's wrong?\" Ye Futian asked quietly.Hua Jieyu reached out a slender arm and grabbed Ye Futian's hand. Her voice was low. \"After I leave, Grandmaster will be alone again.\"\"Silly girl, Grandmaster will be fine,\" Ye Futian said softly. Thinking of the old man at the School of the Emperor Star, he felt bittersweet.The old man's smile was so benevolent. He could feel his grandmaster's love towards him and Hua Jieyu in his gaze. Though he was old, he still had a scholarly and refined aura. He did not seem to like how the School of the Emperor Star had become. Staying there by himself must be lonely.\"Okay,\" Hua Jieyu said with reddening eyes. \"Let's go visit him whenever we can, alright?\"\"Of course. I still have to learn to play the guqin from him,\" Ye Futian said with a smile. However, he knew that there would be fewer and fewer chances. With Grandmaster's age, no one knew how many more years he could live. But it was this old man who had taught him pieces such as the Decree of the General.\"Also, you're not allowed to leave me anymore.\" Hua Jieyu stared deeply at Ye Futian.\"Weren't you the one who left me? When did I ever leave you?\" Ye Futian asked.\"You did.\" Hua Jieyu glared at him.Ye Futian sighed. He couldn't argue with Jieyu's logic. \"Does that mean you're planning on being with me now?\" Ye Futian's eyes brightened.\"You still want to shake me away?\" Hua Jieyu whined.\"Oh no, seems like I won't be able to talk to pretty girls anymore,\" Ye Futian muttered.\"You\u2026\" Hua Jieyu stomped her feet and kicked Ye Futian lightly.\"Why do girls always like to do that?\" Ye Futian mumbled but realized it sounded wrong so he quickly shut his mouth.Then he discovered that Hua Jieyu was smiling at him. \"Really? Who else does that?\"\"No, I've seen Qingxuan kick Yu Sheng like that.\" Ye Futian pointed at the two figures in the near distance.\"I've never done that.\" Seeing Hua Jieyu look at her, Yi Qingxuan glanced over with a smile. She was not going to take responsibility for this.Ye Futian's face darkened. Yi Qingxuan was such a bad friend!Looking back, he realized Hua Jieyu was still looking at him. Helpless, he looked up to the sky and said quietly, \"The weather is so nice today. We should take a nap.\"With that, he walked toward his room. Hua Jieyu blinked and followed. Ye Futian turned around and asked her, \"Together?\"Hua Jieyu halted. When Ye Futian smiled proudly, she suddenly grinned. \"Sure.\"As she spoke, she caught up to him. It was Ye Futian's turn to blink in shock. Happiness had come so suddenly!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 81": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Legend of FutianCH 81Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIn the room, Ye Futian followed behind Hua Jieyu as he watched her with a glint in his eye.\"Pretty nice environment,\" said Hua Jieyu with a smile after checking out the room.\"Yeah, perfect for resting,\" Ye Futian said, nodding.Hua Jieyu walked to the bed and took off her outerwear, revealing her curvaceous figure. She then turned to look at Ye Futian. Smiling, she asked him, \"Do I look good?\"Ye Futian blinked. Why did this feel like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu? Ye Futian had a bad feeling about what was about to happen but nodded anyway. \"Very good,\" he said.\"Then I'll rest and you can keep looking,\" Hua Jieyu chuckled mischievously. She took off her shoes by the bed and laid down, hands behind her head. She continued to chuckle at Ye Futian.\"That's my bed, I should be able to sleep on it too, right?\" Ye Futian watched the beautiful girl in front of his very eyes. How could she tease him like this?\"Just you try,\" said Hua Jieyu. She was still smiling but Ye Futian looked sad and pitiful. \"Fox, what you're doing is wrong.\"Hua Jieyu stretched her captivating body out on the bed. Her every movement was torture for Ye Futian.\"I'm sleeping,\" she said. Hua Jieyu turned away from Ye Futian and pulled the blanket over her body. This time around, Ye Futian had nothing to look at, just a hint of her curvy figure under the blanket.Ye Futian did not know whether to laugh or to cry. He was definitely going to get payback on this tempting vixen.With light steps, Ye Futian walked to the side of the bed and sat down on the floor. Softly, he spoke, \"Fox, do you feel extra warm sleeping here with me?\"Hua Jieyu did not reply.\"I used too much energy in battle today. I want to lie down and rest but the floor is too cold. Why don't I get in bed?\" Ye Futian said, full of confidence. Still no reply.\"Don't worry. I won't touch you, I'll just lay next to you,\" he continued.\"Okay, since you're not answering I'll take that as silent consent,\" said Ye Futian.Ye Futian kept talking to himself. He got up off the ground and sat on the bed. Hua Jieyu made no movements to stop him. He had finally succeeded in getting onto the bed next to her. \"So comfy,\" he said.A moment later, he spoke again, his eyes were twinkling. \"Wow, it's so fragrant. Fox, you smell so nice.\"Darn it, it feels kind of cold. It would be so nice to have a blanket.\" Ye Futian was still talking to himself. As he spoke, he tugged lightly at the covers and gently pulled it on himself. The two of them were not under the same covers.Right now, Hua Jieyu, who still had her back to Ye Futian, was already flushed red. Her beautiful eyes kept blinking. She could feel the warmth radiating from his body.\"How is it still cold under the covers. Are you cold, Fox? I should just hold you,\" he said. Hua Jieyu felt his arm wrap around her waist gently, sending a shiver down her back. Didn't he say that he was just going to lay down next to her and not touch her? He was cold?\"Fox, why are you shaking? Is it because you're too cold? I should hold you tighter then,\" Ye Futian said. Hua Jieyu felt the arm around her waist pulling her in further. The red in her face spread to her ears, her neck. She was so shy.\"Stop bullying me,\" she spoke softly.Hua Jieyu's soft voice reached Ye Futian's ears and he smiled. He held on to the girl in his arms tightly, taking in her sweet scent. His nose was in her hair. He closed his eyes to savor this moment. Quietly, he said, \"I wouldn't have the heart to bully you. Wait for me to marry you.\"\"Okay, I'll wait for you,\" Hua Jieyu responded, nodding slowly. Her shaking body calmed and she slipped into a deep sleep with a smile on her face. She felt safe in his arms.Fox, I will definitely marry you, Ye Futian thought to himself while he held her warm body against his own.While the loving couple shared this sweet moment, the happenings at the School of Emperor Star spread wildly. In a short while, all of Donghai Academy knew of the story.Ye Futian, the disciple of the Guqin Devil, brutally defeated the disciple of the Art Saint, Zhou Mu. Then he crashed the School of the Emperor Star and joined hands with Yu Sheng to defeat two eight-starred Glory Plane cultivators from the School of the Treasury Star. After all that, Ye Futian announced to everyone that Donghai Academy's top beauty, Hua Jieyu, was his girlfriend. The couple revealed their relationship hand in hand.Mu Yunxuan, an eight-starred Glory Plane cultivator in the School of the Emperor Star, got jealous and insulted Hua Jieyu, angering Ye Futian. Thus, Ye Futian challenged Mu Yunxuan to a battle to the death, and eventually defeated him with ease. Finally, with the Decree of the Minister in hand, Ye Futian slaughtered Mu Yunxuan right in front of the headmaster of the Emperor Star school.The seven schools of Donghai Academy were stirred up in absolute shock. Everyone was in disbelief. They had no idea that boy-genius Ye Futian, who made a name in Donghai Academy for himself by fighting, was this powerful. In a couple of years, he may even be more powerful than the Guqin Devil was in the past....It was now dusk. Ye Futian's room was quiet and warm.In her sleep, Hua Jieyu had unknowingly turned over to face Ye Futian. Her soft body laid quietly in his arms. At this time, she opened her eyes. Her long eyelashes fluttered as she observed Ye Futian. \"Aren't you going to get up?\"No, I'm going to continue sleeping until the sun rises tomorrow,\" Ye Futian said with a smile.\"You wish! You rested during the day, so you have to cultivate during the night,\" said Hua Jieyu, escaping his embrace. She got out from under the covers and sat up on the bed. Her hair was messy but it only made her more enchanting. She was so beautiful that it hurt to look at her.\"Fox, I could just eat you up,\" Ye Futian muttered. Hua Jieyu blinked and flushed red. Smiling, she said, \"You can try.\"\"I'm really going to do it,\" said Ye Futian. He tried to make a move. His hands ready to grab Hua Jieyu.A slender leg swept toward him and Ye Futian flipped off the bed.\"Are you trying to murder your husband?\" Ye Futian sat up on the ground and asked her sadly. Hua Jieyu got off the bed and chuckled at him. She seemed proud of her actions.\"Ye Futian,\" called a voice from outside. It was Yi Qingxuan. Ye Futian was upset to be interrupted at this moment.\"I'm sleeping!\" he replied.\"Ye Futian, hurry out!\" she continued to shout from outside his room. Ye Futian reluctantly stood up. What did this girl want from him?\"Hua Jieyu, are you here?\" another voice rang out from outside. Hua Jieyu froze. Then, she began to panic. She looked at Ye Futian and began to straighten out her hair and put on her outerwear.\"Who is that?\" Ye Futian whispered to Hua Jieyu.\"My mother,\" Hua Jieyu replied in the softest manner.Ye Futian turned to stone and jumped when he processed what she had just said.Oh no, this was bad.Moments later, the two of them left the room. Outside, they saw a few people. Headmaster Yi Xiang was also here. He stood not far away from the rest.Standing in front of Ye Futian and Hua Jieyu was a beautiful woman. She looked to be around 30-years-old. Her whole being radiated elegance. One look at her and Ye Futian knew who she was. No wonder Hua Jieyu looked the way she did. This women in front of him must have been an extreme beauty in her youth. Her beauty plus Hua Fengliu's good looks, it was no surprise that their daughter was such a beauty.To this day, Ye Futian had not found a man whose looks could compare to that of Hua Fengliu, other than himself.\"Mother,\" Hua Jieyu spoke softly. Ye Futian glared at Yi Qingxuan. Why hadn't she notified him earlier?\"Masteress,\" Ye Futian greeted the beautiful woman in front of him.Nandou Wenyin eyed her daughter's messy hair then looked at Ye Futian. It was difficult to determine her thoughts through her eyes because they remained emotionless. To Ye Futian, it was like waiting to be sentenced.To his master's wife, Fox's mother, Ye Futian could not act out no matter how arrogant he was.\"Qingxuan, let's go,\" Yi Xiang called out to his daughter. Yi Qingxuan and Yu Sheng bother nodded and left with the headmaster. The only people left standing outside were Ye Futian, Hua Jieyu, Nandou Wenyin, and Nandou Wenshan, who stood behind his sister.\"How is your master doing?\" Nandou Wenyin suddenly opened her mouth to speak. She didn't question Ye Futian about what happened in the room but instead asked about Hua Fengliu. Her voice was crisp and comfortable.\"Master is doing well in the Guqin Gardens. He just misses you, Masteress,\" answered Ye Futian.\"He has Tang Lan to take care of him. So of course, he's doing well,\" said Nandou Wenyin. She sounded so calm. Ye Futian could feel sweat drip down his forehead. Was this how all jealous women acted?\"Master initially had no intentions of staying, but now that it is inconvenient for him to move around by himself, he needs someone to take care of him. Plus, Ms. Tang Lan was very adamant about him staying, so he had no choice but to accept her offer. The first day we arrived in the City of Donghai, Master brought me to the Nandou Palace. He pointed at the inside and told me that Masteress lived there and that he wanted to go in to see you,\" Ye Futian explained. Nandou Wenyin observed Ye Futian for a while, and from the look in his eyes, she decided that he did not seem to be lying.After that, Ye Futian noticed that the look in her eyes had softened.Nandou Wenyin looked at Hua Jieyu and asked her, \"You like him?\"\"Yes,\" nodded Hua Jieyu.\"Your father and I were the same in our youth, but you know how that ended. If something happens in the future, will you regret this?\" Nandou Wenyin asked her daughter.The young woman shook her head.\"Silly child,\" Nandou Wenyin's voice was soft and gentle. She sighed and turned to Ye Futian. \"You took advantage of the challenge against the School of the Emperor Star to announce your relationship with Hua Jieyu. Did you do it on purpose so the Nandou family would see?\"\"Masteress, I had no other choice. Even if I didn't admit it, the Nandou family probably already guessed as much,\" Ye Futian answered.\"You're even more arrogant than your master,\" said Nandou Wenyin. \"I'm taking Jieyu home.\"\"Mother.\" Hua Jieyu looked at her mother.Nandou Wenyin ignored her and continued to look at Ye Futian. \"Come to our place for a visit tomorrow.\"Ye Futian was frozen in shock upon hearing her words. Quickly, he broke out into a smile. \"Thank you, Masteress!\"Hua Jieyu was just as surprised. It seemed like her mother did not object to their relationship.\"Hey kid, you're pretty gifted,\" Nandou Wenshan said suddenly. He walked closer to the three and smiled at Ye Futian.\"Senior, was it you who tried to warn me that day at the Luo Palace?\" asked Ye Futian. After eliminating the chance that it was Vice Headmaster Han Mo of the Emperor Star school, Ye Futian always wondered who could have possibly warned him that day. Seeing Nandou Wenshan now, he had a realization.\"Why? Have you antagonized everyone in the Nandou family? I'm Hua Jieyu's blood uncle,\" Nandou Wenshan said while staring at Ye Futian.\"Oh.\" Ye Futian held in a smile and nodded his head. Then, he said rather loudly, \"Greetings, Uncle!\"\"Shameless,\" Nandou Wenshan reprimanded him jokingly. Afterward, the Nandou siblings led Hua Jieyu away.As they were leaving, Hua Jieyu kept looking back at Ye Futian. She did not want to leave him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There was no need to eavesdrop,\" Yi Xiang said indifferently. Ye Futian made a face at this. \"I'll take you there tomorrow,\" Yi Xiang said.Ye Futian finally smiled. \"Headmaster, you really do see me as a disciple.\"\"Don't overthink. Your master stole one of my students who still won't return to the right path. Yu Sheng listens to you too so you have to live well for now,\" Yi Xiang said and then left.Ye Futian was speechless. He knew that Yi Xiang thought highly of him but refused to admit it. He had a bad temper as well. Thankfully, Ye Futian was not his son-in-law.\"You're really going?\" Yi Qingxuan asked, looking at him. She felt like it would lead to trouble.\"Even Masteress told me to go. She won't try to hurt me. Anyway, I have Minister Zuo's decree too. Even if the Nandou clan wants to kill me, they won't do it inside their home and your father will protect me on the way. Nothing bad will happen.\"Ye Futian was very clear. Minister Zuo had said that he was favored by the ruler of Nandou nation. Minister Hua controlled the military but was equal to him. Even though he was kind to Ye Futian, someone so powerful was definitely intimidating. When he came to Donghai Academy last time, the big figures of the seven schools all had to bow down to him.\"Then, be careful,\" Yi Qingxuan told him.\"Okay.\" Ye Futian nodded.Yu Sheng said, \"I'm going with you.\"\"I'm going to go see my girl. What are you going for? Stay here and look after your own girl.\" Ye Futian glared at him.Yu Sheng glanced at Yi Qingxuan. He scratched his head and said, \"Oh.\"When Ye Futian said 'girl,' Yi Qingxuan saw that Yu Sheng glanced at her. She blushed and ran away.\"\"Yu Sheng, it seems like you've got everything down. Nice.\" Ye Futian looked at his friend, laughing.\"No.\" Yu Sheng smiled a little and turned away. Looking at his backside, Ye Futian smiled. He couldn't believe this guy knew how to be shy....The next day, he arrived at the Nandou clan. This was a lord mansion with centuries of history. It felt somber.Centuries ago, the pioneer of Nandou nation had walked out of here. He was a true king but after him, none of the Nandou descendants could rival him in glory and they finally lost the throne.Two figures appeared outside. Yi Xiang personally saw Ye Futian to the gate and he said, \"I will wait for you outside.As the headmaster of the School of the Finance Star, he had nothing to do with the Nandou clan so he clearly could not go in. He only came because he was worried Ye Futian would run into danger on the way. He no longer had to worry after Ye Futian stepped into Nandou's territory.Ye Futian nodded lightly and walked forward. He gazed at the mansion, feeling butterflies in his stomach. The first day he arrived at Donghai City, his teacher had brought him here and told him he must conquer it in the future. He had to help Hua Fengliu enter confidently to bring his wife out. However, neither of them expected that he would become involved with the clan so early due to his relationship with Hua Jieyu.Smiling, Ye Futian lifted his feet and walked toward the mansion. The guards seemed to know who he was. They let him enter without stopping him.The path led straight into the mansion. Ye Futian advanced forward. Figures flashed in the mansion, seemingly to go report his entrance. After a short while, Ye Futian realized that there were many people around him. They were all young and glared at Ye Futian with animosity. Some were also curious.They all knew that this guy before them was the disciple of the Qin Devil. His teacher had snatched Nandou Wenyin; now, he had snatched Hua Jieyu\u2014the most skilled woman of the Nandou clan, unmatchable in both talent and beauty.Under this situation, even if they knew how brilliant Ye Futian was, many of the Nandou clan still hated him.Of course, some girls also thought deep down that he truly was handsome. Hua Jieyu probably didn't like him just for his talent.In the mansion, a beautiful figure ran over. Seeing Ye Futian, her eyes brightened. She stopped before Ye Futian and said softly, \"You're here.\"\"Yeah.\" Ye Futian smiled. Hua Jieyu smiled sweetly as well. She reached out and took Ye Futian's hand. She was telling the Nandou clan her attitude and determination.Ye Futian was touched. He knew how much courage the action required. He grasped the hand tightly and they walked forward together.This scene made many uncomfortable and unhappy. This b*stard, they thought, he's holding hands with our most talented woman.It was not just the younger generation either. As they walked forward, many seniors looked unhappy as well. However, no one stopped them. Apparently, they had already walked hand in hand at the School of the Emperor Star. Stopping them now was meaningless. They would let the clan leader decide.Hua Jieyu brought Ye Futian to a courtyard. Nandou Wenyin and Nandou Wenshan were both there. They had prepared a meal. It was clear that inviting Ye Futian today was Nandou Wenyin's idea.\"Masteress, uncle,\" Ye Futian greeted them.\"Come sit down,\" Nandou Wenshan said with a smile. Ye Futian nodded; he and Hua Jieyu sat before the table.\"I heard that they all know now?\" Nandou Wenyin asked Hua Jieyu.\"Yes. The way here was filled with people.\" Hua Jieyu nodded lightly.\"Let's eat,\" Nandou Wenyin said. Her motive was just that: invite Ye Futian here to express her attitude. In the past, she had been forcefully separate from Hua Fengliu. Now, her daughter was about to step onto the same path but she hoped the ending would be different.Hua Jieyu put some food onto Ye Futian's plate. Ye Futian smiled warmly and tasted the food. Then he looked up at Nandou Wenyin and said, \"Your cooking is so good.\"Nandou Wenyin glanced at Ye Futian. She said, \"I heard from Jieyu that her father really likes you. After seeing you, I understand why. You two are the same type of person. Perhaps he sees himself in you.\"Nandou Wenshan smiled too. He said, \"Indeed, he and Fengliu both have faces that women can't reject. No wonder both Jieyu and her mother have fallen so hard.\"\"Professor is much better than me,\" Ye Futian said, lying against his conscience. He had to preserve Hua Fengliu's ego before his wife.\"No, you're wilder than he was,\" Nandou Wenyin said. The boy was not even 17-years-old and yet, he had already announced to the entire academy that Hua Jieyu was his. This was not something an average person would do. Wenyin knew how talented her daughter was. The average person would be intimidated but instead, Ye Futian had called her his. He had even killed the prodigy of the School of the Emperor Star in front of everyone.\"\"His talent is better too,\" Nandou Wenshan added. \"Ye Futian, thank you.\"Ye Futian glanced up in shock.\"You don't know how Wenyin had been living these years,\" Wenshan said with a smile.\u00a0\"She's like a zombie every day. When she heard that Hua Fengliu had returned to Donghai City, she finally came back to life. After seeing you at the Luo Palace, I guessed that you have a special relationship with Jieyu. I told her and she started paying attention to you. Yesterday was the first time she stepped out of the mansion all these years.\"Ye Futian gazed at Nandou Wenyin. He could guess how deep her relationship with Hua Fengliu was.\"Masteress, I'll treat Fox well in the future. I'll have my master come get you too,\" Ye Futian said.\"Where did you get the nickname 'Fox' from?\" Nandou Wenyin glared.Ye Futian chuckled awkwardly. Hua Jieyu also glared at him and said, \"Mother, the first time this mean guy saw me was when I first entered Qingzhou Academy. He said that this doll looked so sinful at 12-years-old that I'll definitely become a fox in a few years.\"The two Nandou siblings were taken aback. Nandou Wenshan smiled after a while and said, \"You were already so inappropriate at 12. You truly are better than your professor.\"\"I wasn't wrong,\" Ye Futian muttered awkwardly. He gave Hua Jieyu a look; the girl smiled at him mischievously.\"Wenyin, I heard you're better now,\" a voice traveled from outside the courtyard. Then they could hear various footsteps walk toward here.Nandou Wenyin looked in that direction. After a bit, a group of people came in. At the head was the clan leader, Nandou Tai. Nandou Ku stood beside him. He studied Ye Futian with a sharp expression.\"Uncle,\" Nandou Wenshan rose and greeted him.Nandou Tai nodded. He scanned Ye Futian and said with a smile, \"You must be Ye Futian, Hua Fengliu's disciple.\"\"Greetings, senior,\" Ye Futian stood up and said. No matter what, he could not be impolite.\"The heroes come from the youths. I heard that you are unrivaled at the School of the Emperor Star and are even favored by Minister Zuo. You have surpassed your master,\" Nandou Tai said with a smile. \"Do not mind the grudges of the past generation. I heard that Hua Fengliu isn't well these days. If there's the chance, please tell him to come visit. You and Jieyu are good friends so you can come visit in the future as well. I'm sure Wenyin will like it.\"Ye Futian was a little shocked. How could the Nandou clan be so agreeable? But also, what did he mean by saying Ye Futian and Jieyu were 'good friends'?\"Uncle,\" Nandou Wenyin stood up and said to Nandou Tai, \"Jieyu is almost 17 now and has someone she likes. They are both in love. I am planning on betrothing Jieyu to Futian and arranging this marriage. Uncle, what do you think?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 83": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Legend of FutianCH 83Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayUpon hearing these words, Hua Jieyu and Ye Futian both looked at Nandou Wenyin in surprise.Masteress wants to betroth Hua Jieyu to me. Ye Futian's heart warmed at the thought of this. Today was only his second encounter with Nandou Wenyin, but he also understood that the main reasons behind her decision were because of Hua Fengliu as well as Hua Jieyu's feelings for himself. Ye Futian's gifts did not play an important role in Nandou Wenyin's decision making.Nandou Wenshan was also shocked but recovered quickly because he understood that his sister had been living with the regrets of her past and did not wish for her daughter to go down the same path. Now that Ye Futian revealed that he was highly capable and even had Minister Zuo on his side, the Nandou clan would definitely take Ye Futian into consideration for Hua Jieyu. Nandou Wenyin wanted to take this opportunity to get their betrothal settled in case anything changed in the future. When she extended her invitation to Ye Futian the day before, she had already made up her mind.Nandou Tai and the rest stared at Nandou Wenyin collectively. Someone spoke, \"Wenyin, don't you think you're making a rash decision?\"\"It's true that he presented his capabilities at Donghai Academy, but what of it? It could simply mean that the people of the School of the Emperor Star are too weak. There are tons of highly gifted young men within the Nandou clan. Why should we allow Hue Jieyu to be betrothed to him?\" asked another person.Everyone took their turn in making comments on the subject. Many people had a thing or two to say in disapproval of betrothing the most outstanding young woman of the Nandou clan to the disciple of the Guqin Devil.\"Wenyin, you heard the people. Jieyu is still young, there is no rush to make such a decision,\" said Nandou Tai.\"I'm simply saying they should be engaged. I wasn't suggesting that they should be married right away,\" replied Nandou Wenyin. She stood firm on her decision. To be honest, it would not be strange for a girl of Hua Jieyu's age to be married anyway.\"This is still too hasty,\" said Nandou Tai, shaking his head.\"Jieyu's father is Futian's master, so obviously he would not object. I am Jieyu's mother and I also support this. Jieyu and Futian are dedicated to each other and are deeply in love. So, why is this a hasty decision?\" questioned Nandou Wenyin. She did not sound too happy.Nandou Tai's expression darkened. He stared at Nandou Wenyin and said, \"So, what you're saying is, Hua Jieyu's marriage has nothing to do with the Nandou clan?\"Nandou Wenyin retorted, \"And what Uncle is insinuating is that Jieyu's marriage should be decided by the Nandou clan and has nothing to do with me, her own mother? In the past, because my parents have already passed, Uncle made decisions for me. Now, even though I'm still well and alive, Uncle wants to make decisions for my daughter?\"Nandou Wenyin knew a thing or two about the clan's plan on setting her up in a marriage of convenience all those years ago. She was not going to allow them to do the same to her daughter.\"Wenyin, you're out of line,\" an elder reprimanded. \"Is this the attitude you use when speaking to the clan leader?\"\"Miss Wenyin, is it simply because he is the disciple of the Guqin Devil?\" asked Nandou Ku. \"Are you trying to have your daughter fulfill the dreams you were unable to?\"Ye Futian looked at Nandou Ku. This was the man who stalked Hua Jieyu to the Guqin Gardens. He had also told Ye Futian that he could not be compared to the Art Saint's disciple, Zhou Mu.\"Watch your mouth! This is not a place for you to speak,\" Nandou Wenyin said to Nandou Ku.\"I understand that Miss Wenyin is of nobility. You carry the blood of your ancestors. You have inherited the royal bloodline. The same can be said for Miss Jieyu. It is because of this that her marriage cannot be determined so hastily. Even though the Guqin Devil's disciple is incredibly gifted, it doesn't mean anything. There are tons of genius cultivators out there. There are many just in the Nandou clan, but it seems that Miss Wenyin never took that into consideration,\" said Nandou Ku.Realization flashed through Ye Futian's eyes. From Nandou Ku's words, Ye Futian predicted that Nandou Wenyin was the direct descendant of the person who established the Nandou Nation. To say that they have inherited the royal bloodline meant that Nandou Wenyin and Hua Jieyu were actually the princesses of the Nandou clan.\"What you said is correct. The battle at Donghai Academy doesn't mean anything. I am willing to test his true abilities.\" At this moment, a member of the Nandou clan stepped forward. The young man looked at Ye Futian. \"How does a battle sound?\"Ye Futian glanced at the young man and chose to ignore him.\"What do you mean by this?\" the young man glared at Ye Futian.\"Step down,\" ordered Nandou Tai. The young man retreated into the group. Nandou Tai spoke again, \"Wenyin, it is exactly because your parents left you at an early age that I was forced to take over as the clan leader. I have the responsibility to take care of you guys. I know that you hold a grudge against me for what happened in the past, but we can't change what has already happened. I am willing to let go of the past and might even think about allowing you to reunite with Hua Fengliu in a couple of years, but regarding Jieyu's marriage, will you allow me to make the decision?\"\"You're only now considering Hua Fengliu?\" asked Nandou Wenyin. Her demeanor was cold. Hua Jieyu was incredibly gifted and carried the hopes and dreams of the entire Nandou clan. Plus, Ye Futian who was the Guqin Devil's disciple, also possessed incredible gifts. He also had Minister Zuo to back him up. Nandou Tai had to know that some things could not be changed. Some things are inevitable. The only way future events could be altered is if Nandou Tai broke off relations with Hua Jieyu and at the same time, had Ye Futian killed. However, it was obvious that Nandou Tai could not do either of these things.\"I will make the decisions regarding Hua Jieyu's marriage.\" Nandou Wenyin was not going to give up. She was not going to let the clan sacrifice her daughter as they had done to her.\"How presumptuous!\" yelled Nandou Tai. More and more people of the Nandou clan gathered behind their leader. At this moment, Ye Futian realized how lonely Hua Jieyu and her family were among the huge Nandou clan. Their family used to be the most distinguished bloodline but was now the most isolated.\"Masteress, maybe we should give the clan leader a little more time to think about this matter. Jieyu and I aren't in a rush,\" Ye Futian spoke. In this situation, it was not a good idea for Nandou Wenyin to go against the entire clan. What Ye Futian needed was time.Nandou Wenyin averted her attention to Ye Futian. He bowed to her and said, \"Masteress, Jieyu, I'm going to leave now. I'll come visit again when I get the chance.\" He then turned to Nandou Tai and the rest of the group. \"Excuse me.\"Ye Futian began to make his way out. The clan made way for him. One of the younger clan members mocked Ye Futian. \"He's probably just afraid to lose. He won't live up to his reputation.\"\"I heard that he does what he wants at the academy, but looking at him now, he doesn't look all that mighty,\" someone else chimed in.Ye Futian smiled but chose to ignore them. Fighting someone from the Nandou clan would only add fuel to the fire.After Ye Futian left, Nandou Wenyin and Nandou Tai were still in a stand-off.\"Wenyin, I think you should take some time to cool your head,\" said Nandou Tai.\"There's no need. This is my final decision, I'm not going to have a change of heart,\" she replied calmly.\"Talk some sense into your younger sister,\" Nandou Tai said to Nandou Wenshan. Then, he turned to leave.The crowd dispersed. As Ye Futian made his way to the exit of the Nandou Palace, people either challenged him to battle or insulted him. Everyone had an opinion about Ye Futian. He ignored all of them and left with Yi Xiang.After Nandou Tai led the crowd away, Nandou Wenyin frowned and said quietly, \"In the past, he tried to use me to get close to Minister Hua, but now even though Ye Futian is in Minister Zuo's good graces, he won't let Hua Jieyu marry him. Is it purely because he is Hua Fengliu's disciple?\"Nandou Wenshan also frowned. There did seem to be some contradicting points in Nandou Tai's decision.\"Mother, there is something that I forgot to tell you,\" said Hua Jieyu. \"The other day, the clan leader invited Minister Zuo over to tell me my fortune. The minister agreed to his request and said that I was destined to be an empress.\"\"Tell your fortune?\" Nandou Wenshan was shocked. \"Minister Zuo is an astrologer?\"\"Yes.\" Hua Jieyu nodded her head. Nandou Wenyin stood frozen in place. She then turned to her brother and asked, \"What do you think of this?\"\"So, this was the reason why his Majesty has such great trust in Minister Zuo,\" Nandou Wenshan murmured to himself. \"I once read an ancient text about astrologers. They are extremely rare and possess the ability to tell a person's fortune. However, this ability is highly dependent on the astrologer's own powers. Based on Minister Zuo's powers, by empress, he could have meant a title of courtesy or a queen. Besides, astrologers can tell fortunes but cannot see the future. A told fortune can be changed.\"What Nandou Wenshan did not know was that Minister Zuo did have doubts on the day he told Hua Jieyu's fortune. However, he only told her that she was destined to be an empress after she had asked about Ye Futian. In reality, the fortune Hua Jieyu was told consisted of a biased prediction from Minister Zuo.Hua Jieyu nodded. She also believed that her fortune could be changed....After Ye Futian returned to Donghai Academy, he put himself on lockdown to focus on cultivating. Even after he had demonstrated his gifts and also brought out the Decree of the Minister, the Nandou family clan was still conflicted on allowing him to be with Hua Jieyu. Since things have come to this, the only thing Ye Futian could do was to become even stronger. He was going to become so powerful that he wouldn't even need to seek the clan's approval. When spring arrived next year, he would head to Nandou Nation's Imperial City and attend the Tingfeng Banquet with Hua Jieyu. They were going to heal Hua Fengliu.The days passed but Ye Futian has not set foot outside of the School of the Finance Star. His powers were increasing day by day.Meanwhile, Donghai Academy had actually become more peaceful since Ye Futian's battle. The schools of the Emperor Star and the Treasury Star stopped picking fights with the School of the Finance Star. That day, the two schools were completely humiliated by Ye Futian. They did not have the nerve to look for trouble at the Finance Star school anymore.However, everyone in Donghai Academy already knew that the School of the Emperor Star was not going to let this go so easily. Perhaps this was the peace before the storm.Countless rumors circulated around the campus. They said that the School of the Emperor Star wanted to control all of Donghai Academy and that the seven schools were no longer going to stand together.In the blink of an eye, it was the end of the year. It has almost been one year since Ye Futian arrived in the City of Donghai. He has already broken into the six-starred Glory Plane in both martial arts and the art of sorcery. But Ye Futian did not slow down his pace in cultivation. The Glory Plane was still too weak for the Nandou Nation standards. He hoped that he would be able to reach the Dharma Plane quickly and be able to find his place in the Nandou Nation.While Ye Futian cultivated quietly, all officials from the schools of the Emperor Star and the Finance Star arrived at the entrance of Donghai Academy, including the two headmasters. Everyone at the academy was frantically trying to guess who they were welcoming. What kind of people would warrant such a big welcome?Finally, a group of people traveling on beasts arrived. This scene was even more powerful and shocking than the time Minister Zuo arrived!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

At the front were a middle-aged man and a young man. The middle-aged man wore a silvery white robe that dazzled. His eyes were spirited and filled with an imposing manner when he scanned the crowd. He was like an important figure who could sentence others to death at a whim. He was awe-inspiring just standing there. The youth had an even more impressive aura. His eyes were like stars and there was a sharpness to him as if no one could get in his way.\"Minister Hua,\" everyone greeted and bowed. Even the headmasters of the School of the Emperor Star and School of the Treasury Star bowed.The middle-aged man was Minister Hua of the Nandou Kingdom. He looked at everyone with his imposing gaze. Then he pointed at the youth and said, \"This is His Highness, the Crown Prince.\"Everyone's heart shuddered. They had felt something when they saw how extraordinary the youth was. Hearing Minister Hua, they realized that this was the legendary Crown Prince of Nandou Kingdom.The Emperor had many children but he had chosen his heir early on. No prince could fight with Luo Junlin for the throne.His name was Junlin. It meant that the king would rule over the world. This seemed like a disrespectful name but it had been given by the Emperor personally. One could see how much the Emperor liked this prince. Everyone in Nandou Kingdom knew that Luo Junlin would be the next ruler. No one doubted this.\"Crown Prince,\" everyone greeted and bowed reverently. No one expected that the Crown Prince would come with Minister Hua. If that was the case, everything was determined already.Luo Junlin nodded casually. He strode forward and the men of the two schools made way for him.\"Junior, let's go,\" Minister Hua walked up and said to the headmaster of the School of the Emperor Star.\"Senior, after you,\" the headmaster said politely. Then the group entered Donghai Academy.News of Crown Prince Luo Junlin's arrival quickly spread throughout the academy. The powerful students of all seven schools went to meet him. The School of the Finance Star had conflicts with the Emperor Star but Yi Xiang went too. He was only a headmaster, after all, and had to greet the Crown Prince and Minister Hua.It caused a ripple through Donghai Academy. After the peace and quiet of the past days, had the storm finally come? The School of the Emperor Star and School of the Treasury Star had been low-key these past months. It seemed that they'd been waiting for this step and had planned this early on.All the headmasters left the School of the Emperor Star after bowing to the Crown Prince and returned to their own schools. Then another news spread throughout the academy.Minister Hua had said that he wanted to see the cultivation progress of the students. He ordered Donghai Academy to hold an Assembly of the Seven Schools three days later. He and the Crown Prince would observe it.This news caused an uproar in Donghai Academy. Everyone could feel that there was an ulterior motive behind the assembly. It might have something to do with the recent rumors.The School of the Emperor Star was unsatisfied with all seven schools being equals.. . . . . .In the School of the Finance Star, Ye Futian was practicing his instrument in his courtyard. Not only would the piece help his musicality, it also cultivated his mind. He had locked himself up these past months to cultivate without disturbances. Now, Yi Xiang came over. When Ye Futian finished the piece, he looked up and saw that Yi Xiang had furrowed brows. He asked, \"Headmaster, did something happen?\"\"Yes.\" Yi Xiang nodded. \"The School of the Finance Star might not exist anymore.\"Ye Futian stared but the man continued, \"Minister Hua and the Crown Prince came to Donghai Academy earlier. They went directly to the School of the Emperor Star and ordered that we hold an assembly in three days. With Minister Hua and Luo Junlin's support, no one can stop the changes in the academy.\"\"What do you plan to do?\" Ye Futian didn't try comforting him. Since Yi Xiang said this, it meant that he was powerless.\"Donghai Academy's seven schools were created to be different clans,\" Yi Xiang said. \"However, this is less and less clear. Now, they are all becoming like true schools. The School of the Finance Star is especially like this but the School of the Emperor Star seems to want to return to clans. If this is the case, I naturally will not stay. I'm telling you this because if the Emperor Star takes control, you would be unable to stay as well. But if you leave, Han Mo might deal with you.\"Ye Futian understood this. He'd wanted to cultivate quietly and go to the Imperial City next spring. He didn't expect this sudden change of Donghai Academy.\"It's okay. I have you and Minister Zuo's minister decree. There's nothing to be scared of. As long as I don't look for trouble, Minister Hua can't hurt me himself, right?\" Ye Futian chuckled. Minister Hua wouldn't ruin the relationship with Minister Zuo without a reason.\"You're clever. Cultivate here and do not worry about the assembly. Don't participate either,\" Yi Xiang advised. Ye Futian nodded. He knew that the assembly was not the time for him to show off.News of the Assembly of the Seven Schools spread throughout Donghai Academy using the shortest time possible. Then it even spread towards Donghai City with terrifying speed. Even many big figures of Donghai City were invited. The School of the Emperor Star stated that they welcomed everyone to come as spectators. This showed the citizens that something big would happen in Donghai Academy. Excitement bubbled through the city. Countless people discussed the event on the streets and in taverns, talking about the legendary Crown Prince.Many wanted to see with their own eyes how amazing the Crown Prince was. Apparently, he had already reached the pinnacle of Dharma and had unparalleled talent. There were also rumors that he had twin spirits and no one in Nandou could beat him. He was born to be king, destined to be king. None of the other princes even had the courage to compete with him. They could only try to become close to him and be a Lord in the future. No one dared to have any other thoughts unless they wanted to die.One could imagine the furor if someone like him came to Donghai City.The three days passed in a blink. That day, the sun shone brightly. Countless people from Donghai City gathered outside the academy to watch the assembly. The big figures had all arrived. Many of them had brought their children too, especially daughters. The reason went without saying. Though the possibility was low, they could become the empress in the future if they caught the Crown Prince's eyes. He didn't have a wife yet.Lin Xiyue came too with her father. Stepping into Donghai Academy, she studied the place. He was cultivating here and she wondered how he was doing.Lin Xiyue didn't know about all the things that had happened. Ye Futian was now infamous in Donghai Academy but his fame was restricted to the academy. Unless they were like the Nandou clan who knew from paying attention to Hua Jieyu, no one knew what had happened.The important figures of Donghai City wouldn't care about a youth of the academy.\"Are you thinking of him?\" Xiao He smiled and asked.\"Shut up.\" Lin Xiyue glared with her pretty eyes.\"He was so handsome at the Luo Palace.\" Xiao He chuckled while Lin Xiyue just smiled and nodded. The youth's performance at the Luo Palace was truly eye-catching.\"Zhou Mu is also cultivating here. I wonder if they'll run into each other,\" Xiao He said.\"Zhou Mu?\" Lin Xiyue murmured. She wondered if he could defeat Zhou Mu now.\"But no matter how they are, they can't be compared to the Crown Prince. You're so pretty. Do you think he'll notice you?\" Xiao He continued.Lin Xiyue ignored her. She hurried to catch up with her father and continued into the academy.In the other direction, Mu Yunqing and Mu Yunni were with their father Mu Hong. The man smiled and said, \"No wonder Donghai Academy is the home of geniuses and talents. It's filled with vitality. How have you two been performing?\"\"Pretty good. We're still working hard,\" Mu Yunqing answered.\"Good.\" Mu Hong nodded. \"The Crown Prince himself is here today. If you have the chance, you two must perform well.\"\"Yes,\" Mu Yunni said. However, the two siblings looked uncomfortable. Their experiences that year had actually been horrible. It was all due to someone but they were too embarrassed to tell their father.\"Back in the day, this academy had many impressive figures. The Art Saint, the Qin Devil, and I all came from here.\" Feeling nostalgic, Mu Hong smiled, saying, \"The Art Saint is now renowned in Donghai City while the Qin Devil is disabled. I wonder where he is now and how his disciple is.\"Thinking of how the Qin Devil had wanted to bring his disciple to him, he smirked. Today was the gathering of the heroes. People like the Art Saint were high above while the Qin Devil was nowhere to be seen.. . . . . .It was a different scene in the School of the Emperor Star.Chief of the East Sea Prefecture, Xia Feng, knelt on the floor while Minister Hua and the Crown Prince sat before him. Usually, Xia Feng would not be like this. However, he was in trouble now and only Minister Hua could save him.\"Why does Minister Zuo want to kill your son?\" Minister Hua asked.\"Because of the Qin Devil's disciple,\" Xia Feng cried. \"Back in the day, the Art Saint had powerfully destroyed the Qin Devil's life spirit. Now, his disciple has returned. He is violent and aggressive, looking down on everyone. Minister Zuo wishes to punish and kill my son, Xia Fan, because he has a conflict with Ye Futian.\" He vaguely knew the relationship between the Art Saint and Minister Hua so he knew what to say.\"Valued by Minister Zuo, possesses the minister decree, and killed a student of the School of the Emperor Star\u2026 I'd like to see him,\" Crown Prince Luo Junlin said.Minister Hua said, \"You will see him at the assembly.\"\"Yes.\" Luo Junlin nodded. He stood up and said, \"Let's go.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Ye Futian and Yu Sheng were not among them. They remained in their dorm.Just then, Headmaster Yi Xiang arrived. He was not alone. Behind him, several people followed. Ye Futian was surprised at the sight but quickly recovered. He walked up to the group with a smile. \"Master, Ms. Tang Lan, what are you guys doing here?\"\"Tang Wan relayed your message to me. Things are about to change drastically at Donghai Academy. We came because we were curious what will become of the academy,\" answered Tang Lan. Ye Futian had asked Tang Wan to help relay Headmaster Yi Xiang's message to Tang Lan.Tang Lan looked over at Yu Sheng. \"So, you're my Junior Brother now.\"Yu Sheng smiled shyly and greeted her, \"Senior Sister.\"\"Umm...\" something felt wrong to Ye Futian. \"Our relationship has gotten so complicated. Doesn't this mean that Yu Sheng is technically my senior? This won't do!\"\"Forget about that.\" Tang Lan stared at Ye Futian. \"I heard you've been really cocky since you started attending the academy. You crashed the party at the Luo Palace, beat up Zhou Mu as well as students from the Emperor Star school. You even went to the Nandou Palace. Daring fellow.\"Ye Futian chuckled. It was only a given that Hua Fengliu and Tang Lan kept tabs on everything that happened at Donghai Academy.\"Did you see your masteress?\" Hua Fengliu asked.\"Yes, I did, Master. Masteress hasn't forgotten about you,\" said Ye Futian. After he replied, he felt a chill. He turned to see Tang Lan smiling at him. He shut his mouth immediately. Life was so hard.\"I'm going to go see your grandmaster,\" said Hua Fengliu. Ye Futian glanced at Yi Xiang and heard him say, \"The Assembly of the Seven Schools is about to begin. I have to head over now, but I'm sure the School of the Emperor Star is already empty. You can take your master there.\"\"Okay.\" Ye Futian nodded. He stepped forward to put Hua Fengliu on his back. Wind Sorcery surrounded and carried them into the sky.In the air, Hua Fengliu questioned Ye Futian again, \"Your masteress, is she doing well?\"\"Yeah, she just misses you. After meeting me, she said that you have a good eye to pick such an outstanding disciple,\" Ye Futian replied with a smile. He did not tell Hua Fengliu what Nandou Wenshan had told him. If Hua Fengliu knew that Nandou Wenyin spent the past years like a living corpse he would definitely be very upset.\"You've become more thick-skinned in our time apart. Your masteress didn't kick you out the door for acting this way?\" Hua Fengliu made a lighthearted joke. He was already used to Ye Futian's shamelessness.\"Something like that could never happen! Before I left, Masteress even said she would betroth Hua Jieyu to me,\" said Ye Futian.\"Really?\" asked Hua Fengliu.\"Master, do you think I would joke about this matter?\"Hua Fengliu laughed. \"I believe you. Love me love my dog. It seems that her feelings for me have remained unchanged.\"\"What do you mean, \"love me love my dog\"? Masteress' fondness for me has nothing to do with you. It's because I'm such an outstanding man. What a narcissist you are.\" Ye Futian had no words for how thick-skinned Hua Fengliu was. \"Love me love my dog.\" Oh please.\"Shouldn't you already know how narcissistic I can get?\" asked Hua Fengliu. Ye Futian could only admit defeat. He said, \"Master, I don't think I can ever surpass you in this aspect.\"By 'this aspect' Ye Futian meant narcissism.\"Don't underestimate yourself like this. You were able to defeat Zhou Mu, which means that I made the right choice to take you on as my disciple. I do have a good eye.\" Hua Fengliu laughed softly.\"It's not easy to get a compliment out of you. So, does this mean you're happy I beat up Zhou Mu?\" chuckled Ye Futian.\"Very happy,\" answered Hua Fengliu. A huge smile broke out on Ye Futian's face. Although he has yet to make any progress on healing Hua Fengliu, Ye Futian was happy to do at least this much for his master.When Ye Futian and Hua Fengliu reached Elder Qin's residence within the School of the Emperor Star, they could hear the sound of a guqin. He was playing the guqin by himself. Although all ten of his fingers were calloused, his movements were accurate and clean. The white-haired elder exuded an elegance. Elder Qin did not seem to have noticed them. He continued to play peacefully, completely immersed in the music.The sound of the guqin was gentle and peaceful. Elder Qin stopped stroking the chords and ended his performance. Only then did he turn his attention over to his visitors. He smiled when he saw Ye Futian and Hua Jieyu.\"Fengliu, you're here!\" he said. His smile was kind. With Ye Futian supporting him, Hua Fengliu bent his knees and kneeled down on the ground. His began to bow to Elder Qin. His head met the ground harshly.When Hua Fengliu lifted his head, his eyes were red. In a raspy voice, he said, \"I have been unfilial to you, Master. It has taken me too long to come see you.\"Hua Fengliu thought back to when he first met his master. Elder Qin used to be so full of life and energy. Even when he had left, the older male did not look as worn as he did now. Hua Fengliu would never have thought that his master would have aged so much when they met again. It seemed that Elder Qin was closing in on the end of his life.\"Hua Fengliu, get up!\" Elder Qin sounded very stern. Hua Fengliu bowed once more before allowing Ye Futian to help him up. Following that, Hua Fengliu said, \"Master, I have let you down.\"\"I am already satisfied to be able to see my disciple again before I die. There is no need to speak of such things,\" said Elder Qin. He was smiling again. \"Besides, I am very fond of Hua Jieyu and Ye Futian. These two youngsters are both very good. Ye Futian is even more gifted than you.\"Hua Fengliu laughed. \"This rascal's gifts are alright but he is too mischievous. I hope he didn't do anything to offend you, Master.\"\"There's no way! His personality is better than yours,\" replied Elder Qin. He looked at Ye Futian and smiled. He continued, \"He and Hua Jieyu are well-matched. You and Nandou Wenyin have to support them. Don't let them walk down the same path as you two.\"\"I understand, Master,\" Hua Fengliu nodded. He eyed Ye Futian who stood off to the side. When Ye Futian sent a proud smile his way, Hua Fengliu gave him an icy glare in return.\"Futian,\" called Elder Qin, \"I am so old now. There are many things I am now unable to do. Regarding your master's injury, I can only count on you.\"\"Don't worry, Grandmaster. As long as I'm alive, I will find a way to heal Master,\" said Ye Futian seriously.\"Silly child, don't talk about the negative things. You'll live a long, happy life,\" Elder Qin said to Ye Futian.\"Whatever you say, Grandmaster,\" said Ye Futian with a smile. \"You also have to take good care of yourself so you can be a witness for the wedding ceremony when Jieyu and I get married.\"\"Yes, yes...\" He could not stop nodding his head. Elder Qin looked extra happy.\"Master, you've probably suffered here at the School of the Emperor Star all these years. Why don't you leave with me?\" Hua Fengliu asked.\"Oh, Fengliu. I've spent more than half my life here. No matter how this place changes, I will always be a part of this school. I already have one leg in the coffin, where else would I go?\" Elder Qin shook his head with a soft smile on his face.\"Grandmaster, things at Donghai Academy won't be the same after today. Do you really not want to consider leaving?\" Ye Futian tried to persuade the elder as well.Hearing his words, Elder Qin looked into the distance. Even though he has not stepped foot outside of the School of the Emperor Star, he knew what was going on in Donghai Academy. He could not help but sigh....At the same time that the three chatted at the School of the Emperor Star, everyone was gathered at the central square of the Donghai Academy campus. It was extremely packed as the surrounding observation decks filled up with people. Officials from the seven schools sat at the center in front of their respective groups, where they stood out the most. Besides them, representatives from the clans of the City of Donghai were also present.Anyone qualified to sit up front with them definitely had an extraordinary background. But it did not matter who they were because at this moment, almost everyone's attention was focused elsewhere.In the direction where the officials of the Emperor Star school were seated, a figure walked up to the main seat of the assembly. He stood there nonchalantly but exuded the gracefulness of royalty. He took one look into the crowd as if he were overlooking the world. Beside him stood Minister Hua, the headmaster of the School of the Emperor Star, and Chief Xia Feng of the East Sea Prefectures.\"Is that the Crown Prince? He looks like an exceptional young man, born to be emperor.\" Everyone whispered about Luo Junlin. He possessed an extraordinary aura. An aura so strong, it would feel burdensome to get close to him.The people got up one after another and bowed in his direction. \"Greetings, Crown Prince. Greetings, Minister Zuo.\"Luo Junlin watched this scene calmly and spoke, \"Sit.\" He then turned to take his own seat and only when was he seated everyone took their seats as well.Everyone knew the young man seated at the center of the square was to become the emperor of the Nandou Nation. He was going to control the world. Not only was Luo Junlin a person of great importance, his aura, his looks, and his gifts were also outstanding. Many of the young women watched him closely, seeming to all be expecting something outrageous.\"The Crown Prince's aura is so much stronger than that of Zhou Mu's,\" muttered Xiao He. She stood beside Lin Xiyue and the rest of the Lin family. The Art Saint's disciple, Zhou Mu had been the most outstanding young man she had ever seen.\"The Art Saint is over there and so is Zhou Mu,\" Xiao He continued. She was looking in the direction of Vice Headmaster Han Mo. Standing beside him was the Art Saint and Zhou Mu stood behind his master.However, Lin Xiyue was looking into the crowd, seemingly in search of something. She could not find the young man she was hoping to see. He was a student of the School of the Finance Star but was not amongst the students seated here.At this moment, seated amongst the officials of the School of the Emperor Star, Vice Headmaster Han Mo stood up. He walked to a spot up ahead and held both of his arms up to the sky. In a split second, everything went quiet.\"The Crown Prince and Minister Hua have blessed the academy with their presence today. Donghai Academy has not experienced such great honor in its 300 some years of history. I am sure that what happens here today will be recorded in the history books for the people even a thousand years from now,\" Han Mo said loudly. \"The Crown Prince and Minister Hua have high hoped for our academy. So, we would like to take this chance and have students of each school demonstrate their abilities for them here today, during the Assembly of the Seven Schools.A light flashed through everyone's eyes. They were all conflicted. All those days ago, before Ye Futian defeated the students from the schools of the Emperor Star and the Treasury Star, they constantly picked fights with students of other schools to exert their dominance. But they never thought that their plans could be ruined by Ye Futian.Presently, the School of the Emperor School used the Crown Prince and Minister Hua as an excuse to hold this assembly. Their intentions were no secret to everyone.However, to be able to prove one self's worth in front of the Crown Prince was a one in a lifetime chance. Some people began to explore the idea. After all, it didn't really matter to ordinary students whether or not the seven schools of Donghai Academy were separated or united.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After today, he would control Donghai Academy by himself.He continued, \"Of course, because there are many disciples of the academy, everyone will have a chance to demonstrate their abilities. I hope that in the future, the accomplished students will grasp this chance to express their talents.\"Also, since we wish to show the prince and Minister Hua our true bearing, there is no need to hold back. Being hurt in battle is inevitable. If you wish to show off your talents today, you must be willing to take on the risks.\"Han Mo's words caused many expressions to slack. In the past, the duels in Donghai Academy would all end before it went too far. Dying or becoming fatally wounded was never allowed to happen. According to Han Mo, the disciples would go all out today. This way, uncontrollable situations may happen.\"I won't say more. Next, let's give our time to the disciples of the seven schools of Donghai Academy.\" Han Mo smiled and returned to his seat.The place instantly became quiet. There was an empty area in the center of the square. It would be the stage where the Donghai disciples showed off their talents; it was also a battlefield.All were quiet. Then, everyone saw a figure walk out from the School of the Emperor Star. Seeing him, everyone grew serious. It was Zhuo Qing, number one of the dharma rank in Donghai Academy.He slowly walked to the center and halted. He looked up in the direction of the School of the Finance Star.\"Zhuo Qing, School of the Emperor Star, Nine-star Glory Plane, challenges any willing Glory Plane disciple of the School of the Finance Star,\" Zhuo Qing said. Many outsiders did not understand the situation but the people of Donghai Academy understood immediately. He was taking revenge for what Ye Futian had done. However, Ye Futian was not in the School of the Finance Star crowd. He didn't come today.The others looked uncomfortable. Zhuo Qing was at the highest level of the Glory Plane. There was nothing brag-worthy of challenging other Glory Plane disciples. However, he'd used the word 'any willing,' which was a blow to their pride. But barely anyone could beat him at this level.Yu Sheng moved, wanting to go out. He was now in the Six-star Glory Plane and could fight Zhuo Qing.However, Yi Xiang stopped him. Yu Sheng's attacks and strength were no competition for anyone in the Glory Plane but he still had flaws. Unlike Ye Futian, who learned all sorts of abilities, Zhuo Qing specialized in mind spells and was good at controlling. He could also fly. This was fatal to Yu Sheng. No matter how strong he was, he might not be able to hit the opponent.Once Yu Sheng reached the dharma state, his abilities would evolve. At that time, he would be able to fly and also cultivate sorcery.\"Is no one taking the challenge?\" Seeing how there was no action, Zhuo Qing smiled.At this time, someone walked out of the crowd and came before him. \"Yang Teng, Nine-star Glory Plane,\" the disciple said. \"After you.\"\"Please.\" Zhuo Qing smirked. He instantly hovered in the air. His eyes became extremely demonic and he flew toward Yang Teng.Yang Teng stomped on the ground and stepped forward. He rushed toward Zhuo Qing like lightning and sprang into the air. Zhuo Qing's eyes radiated with horrible sharpness. An invisible mind storm fell upon Yang Teng's body, rushing into his brain. Then, he was unable to control himself. His hovering body dropped to the ground. The spectators realized that Zhuo Qing could use extremely powerful mind spells to control others' bodies. They shuddered. However, Yang Teng was also powerful. He roared and forcefully shook the mind control away. He landed on the ground gracefully.But then, Zhuo Qing landed in the air above him. His demonic eyes stared at Yang Teng. At the same time, endless vines fell toward Yang Teng. This was the wood element spell Ye Futian had used before the School of the Emperor Star\u2014Lock of a Thousand Vines. The spiritual qi on Yang Teng burst forward. He wanted to gather his spell but the mind storm attacked. He discovered that he could not control the spiritual qi around him and his spell would not form. With a whoosh, the vines locked down around him, immobilizing him.Zhuo Qing descended slowly. He kept his demonic eyes on the struggling Yang Teng. Then, Yang Teng felt the vines' sharp thorns dig into his body. He cried out from the intense pain.With a snap, the vines stiffened. They snapped his joints and Yang Teng's body became deformed. Now he was regretting taking up this challenge. Zhuo Qing was more powerful than what the rumors said.Thud! Zhuo Qing's foot fell before him. The next moment, there was a string of noise and the vines tossed Yang Teng in the direction of the School of the Finance Star. The people there caught his body but saw that his limbs were all deformed. He was curled up in extreme pain.\"Take him to get medical treatment,\" Yi Xiang said. He studied Zhuo Qing, whose eyes had returned to normal.Zhuo Qing smiled and said, \"Sorry.\" With that, he returned to the School of the Emperor Star crowd.Many people could feel the coldness. Zhuo Qing had directly disabled a disciple of the School of the Finance Star. He was so cruel.\"The student of the Emperor Star headmaster is as expected,\" a clan member praised. They had seen situations like this many times before and were used to it.\"In the future, he will definitely be an important figure of Donghai City,\" many praised.The headmaster of Emperor Star smiled and said, \"Zhuo Qing is not just this. Next year, he will attend His Majesty's Tingfeng Banquet.\"\"Yes, with Zhuo Qing's talent, he will definitely make a show at the Tingfeng Banquet,\" someone said with a laugh. Everyone was praising Zhuo Qing. No one ever asked about the defeated one.While everyone was talking, Yu Sheng stepped onto the battlefield. He gazed at the School of the Emperor Star and said coldly, \"Yu Sheng, Six-star Glory Plane, challenges everyone from Emperor Star under the Seven-star Glory Plane.\"The chattering stopped. Countless eyes studied this burly figure. A Six-star Glory Plane was challenging everyone from Emperor Star under Seven-star? Was he crazy?\"It's him.\" Lin Xiyue's eyes brightened. Yu Sheng was so wild but Ye Futian had not appeared.\"Isn't that the kid who came to our home with the Qin Devil before? Is his brain okay?\" Mu Hong from the School of the Flirting Star asked his children, the Mu Yunqing siblings.Mu Yunqing and Mu Yunni's eyes flashed. They thought this guy was so messed up. Back when he was a Five-star Glory Plane, not even those in the Eight-star dared to fight directly with him. Now that he was in the Six-star Glory Plane, those under Seven-star probably wouldn't even be able to break through his defenses. He could sweep the battlefield.\"Father, he is pretty strong,\" Mu Yunqing said weakly. Mu Hong nodded and looked back at Yu Sheng. If that was the case, he would just watch.\"Presumptuous. One of our students is enough for you,\" an elder from the School of the Emperor Star said. Then he ordered a student beside him to fight. That student forced himself forward. His eyes were a bit fearful when he looked at Yu Sheng. Many understood that the school had sent the student to be destroyed.Reality proved them right. When Yu Sheng applied his power, his fist sent the boy flying. Then he tossed the boy in the direction of the School of the Emperor Star. With a menacing cold stare, he glared and said, \"Despicable.\"With that, he returned to his school.\"He does have some skills.\" Mu Hong was shocked. The scene seemed odd to him. He asked Mu Yunqing, \"Is the Qin Devil's disciple also cultivating here?\"\"Yes.\" Mu Yunqing nodded.\"How is he?\" Mu Hong asked.\"His cultivation should be equal to me.\" Mu Yunqing answered, speaking only of cultivation instead of ability.The battles continued. The outstanding students of all seven schools came out to display their abilities. However, the spectators all realized that the School of the Finance Star had grudges with many people. The schools of Emperor Star, Treasury Star, and Flirting Star all seemed to target them. It was difficult for the students of the Finance Star. They were constantly challenged and constantly lost. They rarely won and many were treated cruelly.When Zhou Mu, the disciple of the Art Saint, came up, the atmosphere was pushed to the peak. Zhou Mu's cultivation had improved. He was now in the Seven-star Glory Plane and challenged the Eight-star students of the School of the Finance Star.\"Good,\" someone praised. \"As expected of the Art Saint inheritor. He can summon beasts through his paintings that are stronger than real demons.\"\"He does have the style of the past Art Saint. There is no other like him,\" many big figures said.But at this time, two figures walked into the crowd. Ye Futian carried the Qin Devil and found his school. He pushed through the crowd. Ye Futian was not planning on coming but his teacher wanted to have a look. After this, Donghai Academy would no longer be the academy of the past. Many familiar people would be present today too.Cheers exploded. Ye Futian looked up and saw Zhou Mu had summoned a beast to defeat his opponent. Many spectators glanced at the School of the Finance Star. Their disciples had lost horribly today.\"Brother Fengliu?\" At this time, someone saw Ye Futian carrying Hua Fengliu toward their school and immediately called out.\"Hua Fengliu, the Qin Devil, has appeared.\"\"Is that his disciple?\" many asked.Ye Futian was speechless. He muttered, \"Professor, you're too out there.\"\"I have a reputation,\" Hua Fengliu replied nonchalantly. Ye Futian could not argue.\"Haha, today the Art Saint's disciple had shown his talents. Coincidentally, Brother Fengliu has appeared with his disciple. They should duel so we can see if Brother Fengliu's disciple can be compared to the Art Saint's.\" A bright voice sounded. It was Mu Hong.As soon as he finished, many eyes from Donghai Academy turned toward him. They were all shocked and stared at him as if looking at an idiot.How much did he hate the Art Saint that he wanted to humiliate the man this badly?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 87": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Legend of FutianCH 87Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe events at the School of the Emperor Star shocked all of Donghai Academy. There wasn't a single person who did not know about it.Zhou Mu was defeated by Ye Futian in such a humiliating way. His defeat was an equivalent to a slap in the face for the Art Saint and became a taboo topic amongst the Art Saint's acquaintances. They were all extremely cautious of their words around him.But now, this Mu Hong character dared to bring up the subject in front of all these people. It was obvious how the people of Donghai Academy felt about this. Especially when he said: 'Let's see if Brother Fengliu's disciple is a fraction as gifted as the Art Saint's disciple.' How was the Art Saint supposed to feel about this?Many people were afraid to look at him. They were all afraid that they might catch the Art Saint's eyes.\"This idiot!\" The officials of the Emperor Star school all glared at Mu Hong.The officials of the School of the Flirting Star were also looking at him. This sucker's son and daughter had been beaten up by Ye Futian. Did he not know of this?Mu Hong noticed all the attention he was getting. He thought to himself, who would have thought that the battle between the Art Saint and the Guqin Devil still had this much influence on people? There should be a lot of people who look forward to a battle between their disciples.It was a pity that Hua Fengliu was so inferior now, going around begging others like a stray dog. It was only natural that his disciple would not amount to the brilliant Zhou Mu.\"Father,\" his children called to him. Standing behind Mu Hong, Mu Yunqing, and Mu Yunni were going to be sick. They never expected Ye Futian to show up out of the blue and never in a million years did they think their father would say such things. There was no way that the Art Saint and the School of the Emperor Star were not offended by Mu Hong's words.Even Ye Futian was stunned by Mu Hong. Ye Futian remembered this man vividly. After all, he was the first person that Hua Fengliu introduced him to upon their arrival in the City of Donghai. He could not believe that Mu Hong would say these things in this setting.Looking to the Mu siblings who stood behind their father, he gave them a meaningful smile. Just as he thought, the siblings did not have the guts to complain to Mu Hong. It was probably because they were too embarrassed.\"Greetings, Senior,\" Ye Futian suddenly greeted Mu Hong with a smile. He continued, \"When I met you I thought that you were a brilliant man and that your children were destined to become the best of the best. I only found out that they were students of the Flirting Star school when I entered the academy. Under your guidance, your children must be very talented.\"Hua Fengliu blinked a couple of times. He looked at his disciple, speechless. Could Ye Futian be more brazen? But why did he anticipate what would happen next?Hua Fengliu was not the only one who was shocked by Ye Futian. The students of Donghai Academy all looked dumbfoundedly at Ye Futian. Weren't the Mu siblings the very first people that Ye Futian beat up on his first day at the academy? How deep was this rivalry that Ye Futian had to play with Mu Hong in this way?\"Although Yunqing and Yunni can't claim to be geniuses, they are still pretty gifted. 'Very talented' would be right,\" Mu Hong said confidently. Mu Yunni pulled at her father's clothes from behind and whispered, \"Father, stop talking already.\"\"Hmm?\" Mu Hong furrowed his eyebrows. His head tilted in confusion.\"Very talented indeed. I have witnessed this first-hand on my first day at the academy. The two of them have inherited your Life Spirit and possess extraordinary gifts. A chip off the old block if you will,\" laughed Ye Futian. Everyone's expression darkened. This rascal...The Mu siblings looked extremely awkward. They were so embarrassed. Mu Yunni glared at Ye Futian. This jerk was doing this on purpose!Observing the looks on his children's faces, Mu Hong began to realize that something wasn't right. He asked, \"How did the battle go that day?\"Mu Yunqing and Mu Yunni lowered their heads. Their hatred for Ye Futian strengthened.There was no chance Mu Hong could stay oblivious at this point. His expression fell immediately when he finally realized that he had fallen into Ye Futian's trap.Turning his attention away from his children, Mu Hong looked at Ye Futian once again. He forced a smile on his face and said, \"You are indeed the Guqin Devil's disciple. It seems that you are extremely gifted. It is fortunate that these two incompetent rascals know to be embarrassed. They didn't dare to mention the battle to me. Since I've already witnessed the abilities of the Art Saint's disciple, I am now more interested to know just how outstanding the Guqin Devil's disciple is.\"Ye Futian snickered at the sight of Mu Hong. This guy couldn't seem to get enough of offending others.\"Father!\" Mu Yunqing called out to Mu Hong again. Simultaneously, a voice rang out from the direction of the group from the Emperor Star school, \"Have you had enough?\"Mu Hong froze. His gaze shifted in the direction of the voice and saw the icy gazes on himself. Zhou Mu has also been glaring at him coldly from his spot on the battle platform. Even as he returned to his seat with the others from the School of the Emperor Star, Zhou Mu continued to glare at Mu Hong. His battle with Ye Futian was also the most humiliating for him. What was Mu Hong trying to do, bringing it up again?Mu Hong suddenly felt like the public enemy. He thought to himself, what on earth happened?\"I admit that my disciple is not on par with Hua Fengliu's disciple. After his defeat last time, I already told Zhou Mu to focus all his energy on cultivation. I don't think that it is necessary for Brother Mu to bring up this topic again, right?\" someone said softly. Everyone shivered.It was the Art Saint who spoke.Mu Hong froze with his eyes on the Art Saint. His heart pounded rapidly. He finally understood why everyone was looking at him, and why Ye Futian looked at him funny.So, the Art Saint's disciple, Zhou Mu, already had an exchange with the Guqin Devil's disciple. What's more was that he was defeated.His eyes twitched. He turned to glare at his own children. Oh, how he wanted to give them each a slap across the face. These two brats didn't bring him any intel on Ye Futian.Upon having another look at the Art Saint and the officials of the School of the Emperor Star, Mu Hong knew exactly what kind of effects his words had.\"Please forgive me, Brother Hua. I had no idea of any of this. I had no intentions of offending anyone,\" Mu Hong apologized.The Art Saint turned his gaze away, not looking at Mu Hong. At this Mu Hong's lips twitched. His piercing eyes turned to Ye Futian.Ye Futian felt wronged. He was completely clueless when he first arrived at the assembly. Mu Hong was the one who offended everyone with a single sentence. All he could do was to go along with him.At this time, many clueless outsiders observed Ye Futian. The Guqin Devil's disciple actually defeated the Art Saint's disciple?Lin Xiyue, who had her eyes trained on Ye Futian the whole time, smiled and said, \"I didn't expect that he would become so powerful after getting into Donghai Academy.\"\"He was still slightly inferior back at the Luo Palace, but then he actually defeated Zhou Mu.\" Xiao He was also shocked.\"Let's continue,\" said Han Mo. He did not want to dwell on this topic any longer. Today was the Emperor Star school's day to shine but Ye Futian has stolen the spotlight. His mere existence was an annoyance. And then, that idiot Mu Hong just had to start a fight with him. Mu Hong's actions just now inadvertently humiliated the School of the Emperor Star.More disciples from the school stepped out and the Assembly of the Seven Schools continued.Ye Futian and the Guqin Devil sat with the School of the Finance Star. They quietly watched the assembly progress. They deduced that the Emperor Star school was targeting the Finance Star school. Ye Futian was fuming inwardly. At the same time, he could only sigh because he knew how sly the School of the Emperor Star was. Even if he stepped up, he could only fight. It would not help the situation at all.As a whole, the School of the Finance Star could not compare to the School of the Emperor Star. They were completely overpowered.Watching the students of the Emperor Star school fight, Hua Fengliu reminisced about his days of cultivation there. It was a pity that things were so different now. Everybody has changed. Sitting amongst the group from the Emperor Star school were many familiar faces, but none of them would even look him in the eye anymore. Their attitude towards him and their attitude towards the person who used to be equally as famous as himself, the Art Saint, were completely different.\"Thinking about the past?\" Tang Wan observed Hua Fengliu's expression from beside him and asked.\"Don't make fun of me.\" He smiled bitterly at her.\"You used to be so famous at the academy. It's normal to think about the past,\" Tang Wan replied. She turned to look ahead. She also thought of her cultivation days. Hua Fengliu wasn't the only one who was famous at Donghai Academy back then. So was the Art Saint, Nandou Wenyin, and herself. They were all extremely gifted.\"I've always had a regret. Master is a person of such high-caliber, but as his disciple, I didn't even get the chance to demonstrate my powers as a Musical Sorcerer before getting kicked out of the academy,\" sighed Hua Fengliu. Tang Wan nodded. \"Elder Qin is indeed very respectable, but Ye Futian was able to prove himself in front of the School of the Emperor Star with one musical piece, the 'Decree of the General'. That should make up for at least a part of your regrets, right?\" she asked.\"Yeah,\" Hua Fengliu nodded.Time passed little by little. It was dusk. The sky turned a beautiful red. People from Donghai Academy looked up at the beautiful night sky from time to time. It was almost like the end of an era.\"Is he really not going to fight?\" asked Lin Xiyue. Her beautiful eyes never left Ye Futian. How could he not fight on a day like this? It was the Assembly of the Seven Schools for crying aloud. Since he was able to defeat Zhou Mu, it was obvious that he was really capable.Slowly, people stopped stepping on to the battle platform. Everyone began to whisper left and right. Someone laughed as they said, \"Today is Donghai Academy's Assembly of the even Schools. The School of the Emperor Star put on such an impressive performance. They have overshadowed the other six schools.\"\"The School of the Treasury Star wasn't bad either. They only lacked a little in comparison to the Emperor Star school. They can be considered the second-best school of Donghai Academy,\" someone else commented.From these comments, everyone knew that the agenda of the assembly was just getting started.Amongst the group from the Emperor Star school, Han Mo smiled lightly. He turned to look at the Crown Prince and heard Luo Junlin say to Minister Hua, \"The person that Minister Zuo favors has not made his move yet.\"Minister Hua nodded. He then whispered in the ear of the headmaster of the Emperor Star school. The headmaster wore a strange look on his face but nodded anyway. The headmaster stood up and called out, \"Hua Fengliu.\"Hua Fengliu lifted his head in confusion. He looked at the headmaster and smiled. \"Greetings, Uncle-Master.\"The headmaster nodded in response and said, \"You used to be a student of our school, so why are you sitting with the School of the Finance Star today?\"\"I am here with my disciple today. He is a student of the Finance Star school, so I sat here with him,\" Hua Fengliu answered calmly.\"Then I have nothing better to say regarding that. The Crown Prince and Minister Hua have graced us with their presence today and would like to witness the powers of the best students of Donghai Academy. Your disciple is extremely gifted but has not stepped up. What is the meaning of that?\" the headmaster reprimanded. This was peculiar to everyone watching. Why was the headmaster asking for Ye Futian? However, there were a lot of people who looked forward to witnessing the \"outstanding\" gifts of the person who defeated the Art Saint's disciple.Hua Fengliu and Ye Futian felt something was amiss. Was there no other choice but to fight?At this moment, Ye Futian saw Tang Wan walk to the front with a guqin in her hands.\"Duyou. I purposely carry it with me. The Guqin Devil's disciple can't do without a guqin,\" she said. Ye Futian gave her a smile. She came prepared in hopes that they could take advantage of this event to make sure the Guqin Devil's name wouldn't be forgotten by the citizens of the City of Donghai.Ye Futian nodded with a smile and took over the guqin, named Duyou. Let's play a piece for Master today!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 88": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Legend of FutianCH 88Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayYe Futian slowly walked out to the center of the square. Countless gazes fell upon him. The younger generation went without saying. Ye Futian had already proved how powerful he was. The older generation was also paying attention. The Qin Devil had returned to Donghai City as a disabled man. How talented could his disciple be?Ye Futian put the guqin before him and sat down slowly. Clad in a white robe, he looked extremely handsome and regal.Seeing him, Lin Xiyue gasped and was shocked. She had once thought that he was just an average musician who went to the Luo Palace to learn more about the world. Then, Ye Futian displayed his talent during the battle. Today, she heard that he had defeated Zhou Mu at Donghai Academy. Just how outstanding was this handsome boy?Her father glanced at her. To be honest, he knew about Ye Futian defeating Zhou Mu but he didn't tell Lin Xiyue. This girl was interested in the boy but Ye Futian was the Qin Devil's disciple. He had conflicts with the Art Saint and the School of the Emperor Star. His future would have many obstacles. Plus, he already had a girlfriend\u2014that one from the Nandou clan. He didn't want his daughter to get involved and have her heart broken.Mu Hong studied Ye Futian but his eyes darkened.Ye Futian looked up at the setting sun. There was a smile in his clear eyes. She said slowly, \"This song was composed by myself. It is called 'Hero'.\" With that, he began playing. His fingers slid over the strings and a graceful melody came out.\"He did not challenge anyone. He's just playing music,\" someone said. The spectators were impressed. Today's motive was to see the accomplished students display their talents. They did not necessarily have to challenge others. For the Qin Devil's disciple, music playing was naturally a way to do that.People quickly stopped mulling. The moment the music sounded, they fell into a pleasantly strange artistic conception.At first, the melody was cheerful and fresh. As the music entered their ears, a picture appeared in the audiences' minds. They seemed to see a handsome youth earnestly bow to his teacher for the first time. The youth had extraordinary talent. He was well-liked by his teacher and was taught true skills, growing even more powerful.The melody gradually became graceful and moving. It made one feel as if they were falling in love. They involuntarily entered this mindset. The student grew up, met a girl, and fell in love. His heartbeat seemed to be audible in the music.The moving melody changed again. It became heavy and dark. The relationship was judged and opposed. A few big figures furrowed their brows. Was the meaning behind this song his own story or Hua Fengliu's?The music changed again. The youth had matured and become successful but he still wanted to be with his loved one\u2014even if everyone opposed it, even if it was beyond redemption.The music intensified. The main character of the melody seemed to be fighting against fate. He faced everything alone but in the end, he failed. The music grew dreary like a hero past his prime.Just as everyone thought the song was over, the dreary melody suddenly recovered its vitality. Rather than being spirited again, it was as calm as water like a change in mindset. Everyone could see that the main character had gone through many hardships and cultivated. But he still could not forget his home and lover. He decided to return and face the changes in the world. Even if he was defeated, he was still a hero.The melody stopped. The music faded slowly. Everyone seemed to be unwilling to return to reality. The young people were especially affected by the attractive force of the music.In the School of the Finance Star crowd, Tang Lan's eyes welled with tears. She gazed at Hua Fengliu, who was now disabled. There was a faint smile on his handsome face. His disciple was able to compose now and had performed his entire life.Many big figures glanced at Ye Futian. They naturally understood the meaning behind the song. This was a composition for the Qin Devil. Ye Futian used his music to express his teacher's life. Though he didn't fight anyone, this melody was better than the Qin Devil in the past. No one dared to look down on him.Mu Hong narrowed his eyes at Ye Futian. No wonder Hua Fengliu had begged him for this student. He was a second Hua Fengliu.\"Who did you play this for?\" Luo Junlin, the crown prince, asked from the direction of the School of the Emperor Star.\"Your Highness, I played for my master.\" Ye Futian set his hands down and looked up at Luo Junlin.\"You have enough artistic conception but not enough \u00e9lan. You did not reveal a true musical spell. Since you are such a good musician, why don't you perform something for me today as well?\" Luo Junlin said.Ye Futian gazed at the crown prince. Since he requested it, Ye Futian could not deny him. He nodded and said, \"Okay. I am still unable to compose my own musical spell so I can only perform someone else's.\"\"Sure.\" Luo Junlin nodded.Ye Futian lowered his head and began playing again. His fingers strummed and the instrument strings vibrated. A note broke through the air like powerful running thunder. \"This piece is 'The World'.\"As he spoke, the music notes danced. The audience instantly felt an extreme power. Many people's eyes flashed. Ye Futian truly was a prodigy. They instantly understood that this melody was created for the crown prince.A terrifying music storm gathered around Ye Futian. It was as powerful as crashing tidal waves. Now, different images flashed past the audience's mind as the music played. Signal smoke rose and the emperor rode onto the battlefield to conquer the lands. Some also saw the king ride a dragon and survey the world. Everyone he passed bowed down.In this melody, the world was like a painting.\"Send some men up,\" Luo Junlin said indifferently.Minister Hua glanced at the School of the Emperor Star headmaster and uttered a command. Several disciples then walked toward Ye Futian. However, their steps were very difficult. The music constantly entered their ears, making them scared to fight back.Spiritual Qi gathered around them and they stepped forward. However, the music was still rising. It seemed to want to break through the clouds.Now, Ye Futian was shrouded in a halo of light. He was like a young king. He represented the world.Everyone saw a shocking image. There was a blurry figure up above. He had an emperor's long robe and a crown. He walked toward them, commanding the world, making them voluntarily want to bow down to him.The weaker Emperor Star students going toward Ye Futian had prostrated themselves to the ground, not daring to raise their heads. They seemed to be revering Ye Futian. More and more people knelt down under the music's influence. As if controlled by the musical spell, they worshipped the emperor.BOOM! A terrible sharpness flashed past the eyes of the big figures. They felt the youth's talent and shuddered. Something felt wrong.This song was called 'The World'. It was performed for the crown prince but Ye Futian was the performer. At this moment, he had become the high and mighty emperor and Luo Junlin was before him, face to face. The elegance and grace of the white-clothed youth truly was like an emperor now. Did the musical spell give it to him or was he born with it?Lin Xiyue gaped. The present Ye Futian was even more brilliant than that day at the Luo Palace. He was unmatchable. He could even be compared to someone like the crown prince, let alone Zhou Mu.Mu Hong shuddered as well. Hua Fengliu had such a student and had once come to him but he rejected the man.\"Can't this guy keep a low profile?\" Yi Xiang cursed. He didn't want Ye Futian to attend this event. Being too bright was not a good thing. Nowadays, Minister Hua and the crown prince were very close. He hoped Ye Futian would stay low and attend the Tingfeng Banquet with Minister Zuo.\"Some people are born like this,\" Hua Fengliu said calmly. Not many knew about Ye Futian's secret but he and Yu Sheng knew. The inheritor of Emperor Ye Qing was definitely not an average man. His aura would appear when playing music, which he probably didn't even know himself.When Luo Junlin told Ye Futian to perform something, The World should be the most suitable piece. However, this piece caused Ye Futian to reveal his emperor-like aura. This was neither on purpose nor brought about by the musical spell. It was something he was born with.Hua Fengliu could guess that Ye Futian had a shocking background.At this moment, at the highest seat in the School of the Emperor Star, Luo Junlin slowly stood up. Then, to the surprise of all, he walked down toward the center of the square, toward Ye Futian.People could feel those who were the same. Luo Junlin was destined to be king. Everyone in Nandou knew that he ruled over the world. He could feel something similar coming from Ye Futian. It was the aura of an emperor.The music reached the climax. Then it descended and stopped. Luo Junlin also stopped before Ye Futian. Countless eyes were on them. Yi Xiang and Hua Fengliu were even a bit nervous as they watched. As the crown prince, Luo Junlin shouldn't kill Ye Futian just for a song. He had told the youth to play it, after all.\"Follow me. When I become king, you will be minister,\" Luo Junlin said, staring at Ye Futian.With that, the world fell into silence.When I become king, you will be minister!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 89": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Legend of FutianCH 89Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLuo Junlin was the Crown Prince. What did that mean? It meant that he was going to become the emperor in the future.The words of an emperor were to be taken seriously. Since Luo Junlin had spoken, it meant that he was serious. So, at the nod of Ye Futian's head, he would be bestowed a title of nobility and become a prime minister. Then, as soon as the throne was passed down to the Crown Prince, Ye Futian will be a prime minister of the nation. It was an utmost honor for a mere sixteen-year-old student to be bestowed such a title. This unbelievable ordeal was something you had to see for yourself to believe.Some people were in utter disbelief. This couldn't be real. Had the Crown Prince gone mad? No matter how gifted Ye Futian was, he was still very young. The future was filled with uncertainty. How could the Crown Prince promise him the title of prime minister so easily?Minister Hua was frozen in his seat. His eyes sharpened but he remained silent, not stopping Luo Junlin. Who was he to stop the Crown Prince?Xia Feng was feeling helpless and miserable at this point. He had just begged Minister Hua and the Crown Prince to save his son earlier today but now, the Crown Prince was recruiting Ye Futian to be the future prime minister. By the looks of this, if Ye Futian was smart, there was no way he would reject this offer. If things proceeded, then his son, Xia Fan was good as gone.Mu Hong, Lin Xiyue, powerful cultivators of the Emperor Star school, and officials of Donghai academy, all failed to comprehend the situation as well. It was true that Ye Futian possessed outstanding gifts but weren't the Crown Prince's words too rash?Obviously, Luo Junlin hadn't gone mad, nor was he dumb. He felt a familiar aura from Ye Futian. This young man was a person favored by Minister Zuo and even held the Decree of the Minister in his hands. Putting the pieces together, Luo Junlin was able to think of a lot of things. Plus, he understood Minister Zuo a little too well and was well aware of his way of style of doing things.Ye Futian was also very shocked. He did not understand why one piece would cause such a strong reaction from the Crown Prince. Did he want to bestow him the title of prime minister?\"Your Highness, I have too many ties here and is not able to drop everything to leave with you. Can we reconsider this in the future?\" Ye Futian asked Luo Junlin. Even though he had no intentions of taking the offer, he could not offend royalty in front of everyone.Luo Junlin shook his head. Seeing his expression, Ye Futian bowed. \"Please forgive me, Your Highness.\"\"He rejected...\" Countless pairs of eyes looked at Ye Futian in immense shock. Ye Futian actually turned down the chance to become minister.The Nandou Nation controlled 36 prefectures and every prefecture contained many cities. Just prefecture chiefs held a lot of power and were big-shots in their respective prefectures already, so just imagine the power a minister would have. The Nandou Nation had two ministers. Minister Zuo, the left minister, controlled the inner workings of the nation while Minister Hua, the right minister, controlled the army. The power of a prime minister was second only to the emperor himself.Such a great opportunity had been placed in front of Ye Futian's eyes but he chose to reject.Luo Junlin stared at Ye Futian. He said, \"Do you know the consequences of going against an imperial order? Even though I am not the emperor yet, I will be in the future.\"At his domineering words, everybody's expressions changed. As the Crown Prince, Luo Junlin already exuded the intimidating emperor of an emperor.\"If it was an imperial order, I would have no way to reject, Your Highness,\" answered Ye Futian.Luo Junlin was quiet as he looked into Ye Futian's eyes. A wave of pressure washed over Ye Futian.Suddenly, Luo Junlin smiled. He said, \"If so, then I won't force it on you. You may be excused.\"\"Thank you, Your Highness,\" Ye Futian said as he bowed, ready to retreat back to his seat.As Ye Futian walked back to his place beside Hua Fengliu, Luo Junlin stood still, watching his retreating figure. He gave off a murderous vibe as he walked to his seat as well. When their backs turned to each other, Ye Futian and Luo Junlin walked off the battle platform to return to their own seats.Everyone's eyes followed the two figures. One was the powerful young Crown Prince, who already possessed the attitude of an emperor, and one was a young man, gifted by the heavens. He possessed extraordinary gifts and his future was unpredictable.Luo Junlin sat down in his seat and then with a stern look around, he said, \"I am very disappointed. Today is Donghai Academy's Assembly of the Seven Schools, but from what I have seen, not too many of its students possess extraordinary gifts. Amongst the seven schools, only the schools of the Emperor Star and the Treasury Star can be considered competent. If so, why do you need seven schools? From this day on Donghai Academy shall fall under the jurisdiction of the School of the Emperor Star, and the School of the Treasury Star will assist.\"Silence. These words did not come from the headmaster of the Emperor Star school. Neither did it come from Minister Hua. These words came from the Crown Prince, Luo Junlin. He had already been rejected by Ye Futian today. By the stern look on his face, everyone knew that if any single person dared to object against Luo Junlin's decision, they would meet with a frightening ending.The inevitable changes in Donghai Academy had finally come.\"Yes, Your Highness.\" The headmasters of the Emperor Star and the Treasure Star school stood and bowed to receive the order of the Crown Prince. The other five headmasters did not say a single word as they too, stood up. Looking at the powerful crowned price, they bowed and said, \"As you wish, Your Highness.\"When the Crown Prince and Minister Hua arrived at Donghai Academy, many people had already predicted something like this would happen. The School of the Emperor Star had gotten too powerful. There was no way to stop them. And now, the inevitable had come.\"You may all be dismissed,\" Luo Junlin said with a wave of his hand. He then turned to leave. His every word was absolute.Minister Hua got up from his seat to look at everyone once more before following behind Luo Junlin. A whole group of people followed not too closely behind Luo Junlin and Minister Hua as they walked towards the School of the Emperor Star.\"What do you think of what happened just now?\" Luo Junlin asked Minister Hua. Naturally, Minister Hua understood that Luo Junlin was not speaking of the ordeal with the Emperor Star school but about Ye Futian.\"Your Highness must have had a reason for doing so,\" answered Minister Hua.\"When he was playing the guqin, he exuded the aura of an emperor,\" said Luo Junlin. Minister Hua looked shocked but said nothing. These words could only be said by the Crown Prince. He could not repeat them as a minister.\"When I said that I would give him the title of prime minister, he was not moved. He had no greed. It seemed like he had no interest in the position of minister,\" Luo Junlin laughed with a cold demeanor. \"He is indeed a person worthy of being favored by Minister Zuo.\"\"Minister Zuo does have a very good eye,\" said Minister Hua.\"Many of our nation's officials were discovered by Minister Zuo,\" said Luo Junlin. Minister Hua's gaze sharpened. He knew what Luo Junlin said was true. Astrologers were a scary bunch.\"But Minister Zuo had never given out the Decree of the Minister to anyone. This is my reason for coming to the City of Donghai. Ye Futian might be different from the others that Minister Zuo had previously discovered,\" said Luo Junlin. His gaze sharpened as well.\"What do you mean by this, Your Highness?\" asked Minister Hua.\"Even though I am the future emperor, the person with the most influence in the Imperial City, beside my father, is Minister Zuo,\" Luo Junlin said.\"Your Highness, you will step up to the throne one day. Plus, with your gifts, you will definitely not be any inferior to His Majesty. Power is always in your reach,\" replied Minister Zuo.Luo Junlin snickered and said, \"That's a given. The throne is not my final goal, but if Minister Zuo does anything to get in the way, I will not let him off so easily.\"Minister Hua was shocked by the Crown Prince.\"Your Highness, I don't think Minister Zuo will try anything,\" said Minister Hua.\"On his trip to the City of Qingzhou, besides bestowing the Decree of the Minister upon Ye Futian, Minister Zuo also accepted a request from the Nandou clan. Why else would they invite Minister Zuo to the Nando Palace? Of course, it was to get a fortune told. Minister Zuo would not have told the fortune of the elders in the clan. The most outstanding person in the Nandou clan right now is a young lady named Hua Jieyu. The day Ye Futian crashed the School of the Emperor Star, he went there looking for her. They're a couple,\" explained Luo Junlin.After a while, he spoke again, \"After returning to the Imperial City, Minister Zuo began to plan for next year's Tingfeng Banquet. He also tried to convince Father to put the people of Nandou clan in important positions. Who do you think he's paving a road for?\"\"Ye Futian and Hua Jieyu?\" Minister Hua made a realization. He felt a shiver run down his back. The Crown Prince was way scarier than he had anticipated.\"That's right. Minister Zuo is making the bold move of paving the way for this young couple. Plus, Ye Futian exuded the aura of an emperor today. Do you still think that Minister Zuo isn't trying anything?\" asked Luo Junlin. Minister Hua was dumbfounded. He knew that everything the Crown Prince said was true. Minister Zuo was an astrologer. He must have told Ye Futian and Hua Jieyu's fortune. Furthermore, Ye Futian exuded the aura of an emperor. What were they fated to be?It was a scary thought.\"Send people to keep an eye on Ye Futian and the Nandou clan. Then, we'll head back to the Imperial City to see Father,\" said Luo Junlin. There were still some things that he did not tell Minister Hua. In the City of Qingzhou, Minister Zuo yelled at Luo Junlin's younger sister for Ye Futian. He made his sister, the princess, apologize to Ye Futian. Did princesses need to apologize to commoners? What was Ye Futian's true identity? What kind of person was worthy enough for Minister Zuo to do all this?There was also another thing he held a grudge on. As the Crown Prince, Luo Junlin had requested for Minister Zuo to become his master multiple times but was always rejected. Minister Zuo said he didn't dare to be the master of the future emperor. This also meant that Minister Zuo was unwilling to be his aid. Not only that, Minister Zuo has also refused to tell Luo Junlin's fortune. His reason was an emperor's fortune must not be told. Luo Junlin wasn't going to believe his b*llshit reasons.There was only one reason for Minister Zuo, an astrologer, to refuse to aid the Crown Prince. And that was, the Crown Prince was not fated to an emperor. It's just that Minister Zuo didn't dare to say these words.Minister Zuo had once said the fortunes told by astrologers were the general flow of events. To go against the flow would only bring harm. But Luo Junlin refused to believe this. He was going to change his own fate. He was born to become emperor. Luo Junlin was going to take life into his own hands....At Donghai Academy, the crowd had yet to depart from the central square. What were they supposed to do now that the seven schools were to be united?In the direction of the School of the Finance Star, a large group formed around Yi Xiang. He was explaining something to the crowd and they looked at him, not willing to part.Headmaster Yi Xiang of the School of the Finance Star was stepping down and turning over his position to someone else. He was planning to leave the academy.\"I'm so tired after all these years. From now on, all of you should continue to work hard. I'm only in charge of my daughter and my disciple now,\" joked Yi Xiang.\"Headmaster, don't you mean daughter and son-in-law?\" teased Ye Futian. Yi Qingxuan glared at him but Yi Xiang laughed and looked at Yu Sheng. \"That's right! 'Son-in-law' works too.\"\"Ugh....\" Yu Sheng blinked then looked at Ye Futian, only to see Ye Futian slip him a sly smile. He seemed to be waiting for words of gratitude from Ye Sheng.\"Master, it's almost the end of the year. The Guqin Garden is so big, Hua Fengliu and I feel so lonely there. Why don't you move there to live with us?\" Tang Wan asked Yi Xiang.Yi Xiang looked at her. He couldn't help but smile when he saw how nervous she looked. \"Alright!\" he replied.Tang Wan's face lit up with a bright smile. \"Okay, let's be on our way now.\"\"Let's go.\" Yi Xiang took large steps and walked forward. Yu Sheng and Yi Qingxuan followed after him. Ye Futian, carrying Hua Fengliu, and Tang Wan followed at the back of the group. Ye Futian smiled while watching the group of people ahead of him. This felt like a huge family reunion. It was such a pleasant feeling. If only Fox and Masteress were here too, then it would be perfect. He was going to work hard to make it happen.As the sun set, the group walked out of Donghai Academy. There was no looking back now.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was Tang Lan, Yi Xiang, and the others.\"Master, this is where Fengliu used to live. It'll be our home in the future,\" Tang Lan said to Yi Xiang.\"Yes.\" Yi Xiang nodded. He looked back at Ye Futian who was carrying Hua Fengliu and said coolly, \"Don't know where you got the luck.\"Hua Fengliu smiled wryly. It had been so many years but the grudge was still there.\"Master, did Senior Yi used to treat you as a son-in-law?\" Ye Futian mumbled. Hua Fengliu and Tang Lan had feelings for each other before. Yi Xiang clearly really liked Tang Lan and treated her as a daughter. Ye Futian could imagine his attitude toward Hua Fengliu before.\"I'm not clear. I just know that if you don't shut up, you won't be my son-in-law,\" Hua Fengliu said with a smile. Blanching, Ye Futian shut his mouth.Beside them, Tang Wan smiled and looked at Ye Futian, amused at his words.Entering the Guqin Gardens, a breeze welcomed them. The garden had a nice environment. The sun was setting, basking the fallen leaves in a golden glow. It was beautiful. A white-haired old man was sweeping the leaves with a broom. Ye Futian looked at him. The head of white hair and stooped body made him halt his steps.\"What's wrong?\" Hua Fengliu asked, confused by the scene. Tang Wan stopped as well.\"Tang Wan, who is he?\" Ye Futian asked. The people ahead of them stopped too.Tang Lan followed his eyes and saw the old man. She said, \"He has ailing health but wanted a job so I arranged for him to clean up the garden. Is something wrong?\"\"Aunt Tang, when was this? Why didn't I know about it?\" Ye Futian asked.\"You're always out. How would you know? It should've been after you and your teacher came,\" Tang Lan answered casually.\"Oh.\" Ye Futian nodded and smiled. \"I was just wondering.\" With that, he continued forward. The others glanced at him in confusion but let it go quickly.Tang Lan helped Yi Xiang and Yi Qingxuan settle in. Yi Xiang's wife had left him long ago, either because of different viewpoints or Yi Xiang's temper. Yi Xiang had raised Yi Qingxuan alone in the School of the Finance Star. That was why Tang Lan invited them to treat the Guqin Gardens as their own home. She knew that her teacher lacked the feeling of a family.Afterward, Tang Lan ordered the servants to prepare dinner. Ye Futian helped his teacher into a chair. Seeing Yu Sheng and Yi Qingxuan stuck together, he was forced to say, \"Qingxuan, can I borrow Yu Sheng for a moment?\"Yi Qingxuan glared at Ye Futian. Yu Sheng asked uncertainly, \"What's wrong?\"\"Come with me,\" Ye Futian said. Yu Sheng followed him in confusion and was brought to the entrance of the garden to look at the old man sweeping.\"Don't you think he looks familiar?\" Ye Futian asked.\"You probably miss him.\" Yu Sheng naturally understood what Ye Futian meant by familiar.\"Maybe.\" Ye Futian nodded. \"I always feel like Godfather is watching us.\"\"Would he?\" Yu Sheng seemed to mutter to himself.\"Probably.\" Ye Futian chuckled and walked over.Seeing them, the old man lowered his head and greeted them, \"Young masters.\"\"What is your name?\" Ye Futian asked.\"My surname is Yu. My name is too lowly to mention,\" the old man said.\"Yu?\" Ye Futian's eyes flashed. He ordered, \"Raise your head.\"The old man slowly looked up. His cloudy eyes had no spirit in them. He seemed extremely old with white hair and a white beard. Like lightning, Ye Futian tugged his beard. The man cried out in pain. \"Young master, have mercy. What did I do wrong?\"\"It's real?\" Ye Futian muttered. Then he said, \"Grandpa Yu, I'm sorry. I thought you were someone I know.\"\"It's alright.\" The man waved.\"Grandpa Yu, can I come chat with you often in the future?\" Ye Futian asked.\"I am honored.\" He nodded with a smile.\"Then it's a deal.\" Ye Futian smiled as well and said, \"Then I won't disturb you anymore.\"He and Yu Sheng left afterward.\"Were my senses wrong?\" Ye Futian muttered. He was usually very sensitive and sharp.\"Are you overthinking?\" Yu Sheng asked. They had similar body shape and stature but their appearances were completely different. How could they be the same man? Ye Futian had even tugged the old man's beard. He clearly suspected something.Ye Futian's eyes flashed. Had he really been overthinking?The two returned to the garden. The dishes were gradually being brought to the table. The people all sat down.\"Senior Yi, when is Yu Sheng and Qingxuan's wedding?\" Ye Futian asked at the table.Yu Sheng gaped at him. Yi Qingxuan's eyes flashed too, wondering what that guy was worried about.\"Stop thinking about them and think about yourself.\" Yi Xiang gave him a look.\"It's just a matter of time for me,\" Ye Futian said confidently. Then he looked at Hua Fengliu and said, \"Master, Father-in-law, don't you agree?\"\"I'll consider it,\" Hua Fengliu answered indifferently.\"Uh\u2026\" Ye Futian looked at Hua Fengliu. \"Master, where do you get an in-law as good as me? You still need to consider?\"\"Where's your shame?\" Tang Lan asked coldly. Everyone stared at this guy, speechless.\"Huh, my masteress is better,\" Ye Futian said.\"Then go to your masteress.\" Tang Lan glared at him.\"Ah, Aunt Tang, I'm just kidding. You're just like my masteress,\" Ye Futian said weakly.The others were still speechless. He was honestly so shameless. However, with his shamelessness, the group started enjoying the meal like a family. No one discussed what happened at the Donghai Academy. The past was like smoke. Once passed, there was no need to bring up again.In the cheery atmosphere, the banquet gradually ended. Everyone went back to their rooms. Ye Futian went to the garden to play his guqin. There were some impurities in his timbre. He was clearly distracted.\"It's almost the end of the year again.\" Ye Futian looked up at the full moon. He remembered how the Fox had gone to the Ye mansion to find him after the New Year dinner, shocking the entire family. Then they held hands awkwardly by the lake. Without realizing, another year had almost passed. So much had happened in this year.As he reminisced, a smile appeared on his face and there was more emotion in his music. He had pushed the frustrations aside.Under the moon, he hid his longing in his music....The second day, a beautiful figure came to the Guqin Gardens. When Ye Futian saw her, he made a face. Did this fox know that he was missing her? He thought of her last night and now she was here.\"Why are you looking at me like that?\" Hua Jieyu raised an eyebrow at Ye Futian's weird expression and stared.Ye Futian smiled. \"Because my fox is so pretty.\"\"I'm not yours.\" Hua Jieyu turned away arrogantly.\"Masteress already betrothed you to me. You can't run now. All we're missing is a wedding,\" Ye Futian said with a smile.\"Don't even think about it.\" Hua Jieyu smiled and then ran to the Qin Devil behind him, calling, \"Dad!\"\"Jieyu, why are you here?\" the Qin Devil asked.\"Uncle told me about what happened at Donghai Academy. I knew you'd be back here so I came to look,\" Hua Jieyu said.\"That guy's become agreeable?\" Ye Futian asked, walking forward.\"I came to tell you all good news.\" Hua Jieyu smiled sweetly.Ye Futian looked at her with suspicion. \"The old Nandou guy knows that I'm super talented and unmatchable so he agreed to our wedding?\"Hua Jieyu pinched Ye Futian's waist hard because he was so shameless. She said, \"My mom and I wanted you two to come for New Years and he agreed.\"A strange glint flashed past the Qin Devil's eyes but seeing the two before him, he understood. Nandou Tai knew that his disciple and daughter would be more accomplished than him so now they were trying to resolve grudges. Back in the day, it would be hard to step into Donghai City, let alone the Nandou mansion.Ye Futian understood this too. The Nandou clan had high expectations and wishes for Jieyu. If they didn't want Jieyu to hold grudges after she grew up, they couldn't be too cruel for some things. As for him, they couldn't offend him even if they didn't agree on the wedding.\"Happy?\" Hua Jieyu looked at Ye Futian with a smile.\"I thought they would agree to our marriage,\" Ye Futian said, pouting.\"Say you're happy,\" Hua Jieyu said with a grin.\"Uh\u2026\" Ye Futian looked at her smile and nodded. \"Of course I'm happy I can spend the New Year with Fox.\"Hua Jieyu's eyes were pleased.\"Then can I not leave at night?\" Ye Futian fluttered his lashes.Hua Jieyu's smile froze. Looking at him, she raised a slender leg and kicked him for his unhealthy thoughts.\"I'm thinking of my master. He hasn't seen Masteress in years. You should go discuss this with that old guy,\" Ye Futian said seriously.\"That makes sense.\" Hua Jieyu smiled and nodded. \"Dad can stay but you can't.\"\"My wife doesn't listen to me,\" Ye Futian muttered.\"What did you say?\" Hua Jieyu glared again.\"Nothing. I was thinking if we should go to the Imperial City together afterward,\" Ye Futian said.\"I'll consider it,\" Hua Jieyu said.\"Master's health is bad. I'm worried I can't care for him,\" Ye Futian threatened.Hua Jieyu glared. At the side, Hua Fengliu complained, \"If you want to act lovey-dovey in public, then do it but stop dragging me in!\"\"Dad, what are you saying?\" Hua Jieyu blushed.\"Master, you are so wise,\" Ye Futian praised. At least his master understood them!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 91": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Legend of FutianCH 91Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIn the City of Donghai, Donghai Academy had been turned upside down. The academy was no longer what it once was. Many people left the academy. With their families and their own disciples, even many of the official personnel left. However, there were still those who chose to stay.Year 10000 of the Divine Prefecture Calendar was a year of rebirth. The School of the Emperor Star held the power and the School of the Treasury Star assisted. The time when the seven schools stood equal was a time of the past now. But no one knew whether this rebirth was going to lead the academy to become more powerful or to its demise.In this year, Donghai Academy was the home of a student who arrived suddenly like a shooting star in the sky. He managed to make himself known to the entire academy in an extremely short time. However, he left the academy along with the headmaster of the Finance Star school and his master, Hua Fengliu, before he spent a full year at the academy.Presently, no one at Donghai Academy could imagine what lied in the future of this young man, who shined so brightly at the academy. However, anyone in the audience during the Assembly of the Seven Schools would have realized that if the young man had continued at the academy, he would have become someone of extreme importance in the Nandou Nation. There was no question about this.The new year was nearing, and the Nandou Nation was filled with a festive air. Many people returned home for the first time in a long time. Every prefecture and every city became lively as they prepared for the new year.Things were no different in the Imperial City. Many people already began to celebrate. Every house was decked out in new year's decorations. Inside the most magnificent building in the Imperial City, the Imperial Palace, a festive air also existed. Though, in comparison with the outside, the palace still felt cold and uninviting. The aura in the Imperial Palace matched that of the royal family.At this moment, a figure was seated on the throne in a large hall within the Imperial Palace. He wore a crown on his head and a purple and gold robe on his body. He radiated a domineering aura from head to toe. This person was the most powerful man in all of the Nandou Nation. He was the emperor, Emperor Luo. Standing in front of him was Minister Zuo.\"Do you know why I have summoned you today?\" Emperor Luo asked Minister Zuo.\"No, Your Majesty.\" Minister Zuo shook his head.\"The Crown Prince heard that you bestowed the Decree of the Minister upon a young man and wanted to see this young man for himself. He even personally went to Donghai City. You really do have a sharp eye. Like always, this young man you found is incredibly gifted, the best of the best,\" said Emperor Luo.Minister Zuo knew that something was wrong. The Crown Prince personally went all the way to Donghai City just because he found out about a young man that he favored?\"Indeed, he is a brilliant young man, but isn't it too much for the His Highness to go all the way to the City of Donghai for such a thing? Your Majesty should persuade the Crown Prince to not to waste his time on this matter,\" suggested Minister Zuo. He was trying to alleviate the situation.\"It seems that he has learned some things from this trip. Maybe it's not so bad for him to travel outside. By the way, how is that young man's fortune?\" Emperor Luo asked nonchalantly.\"Your Majesty, you should know that I no longer tell the fortune of others casually. Letting people know of their fortunes may influence their actions and in turn, change their fates. That would be going against the will of the heavens and I will be punished for doing so.\" Minister Zuo bowed apologetically. What he said was not a complete lie. He did not dare to tell the emperor that he had indeed told Ye Futian's fortune. If his fortune was exposed, it would affect Ye Futian's fate and could result in his fate being changed. That would definitely not be good. This was also the reason why astrologers tended not to live long lives.\"You rascal have so many excuses. Didn't you say before that it'll be fine as long as we go with the flow?\" Emperor Luo stood and laughed. \"Then, what about the young miss of the Nandou clan? What does her fortune say? After you returned to the Imperial City, you seemed to be very busy. I know I shouldn't ask but I can't help my curiosity.\"Minister Zuo's heart clenched. He never thought that his every move was being monitored by the emperor and the Crown Prince. At the thought of this, he began to regret agreeing to Nandou Tai's request of telling Hua Jieyu's fortune. Of course, when he agreed, he never expected her fortune to be so shocking, and he would never have guessed she was related to Ye Futian in any way.\"Your Majesty,\" Minister Zuo put his hands together in front of himself and bowed to the emperor, \"I am grateful to have met you and been allowed to follow under your leadership for all these years. I never dared to slack off and have always done my very best to discover new talent for our nation.\"\"Of course, I know all of this, you rascal.\" Watching Minister Zuo, Emperor Luo couldn't help but shake his head and let out a laugh. At this moment, he did not seem like an emperor but an older brother.\"Over the years, I have been increasingly cautious in the use of my powers as an astrologer and have explained my reasons for doing so many times. On my most recent trip to the City of Qingzhou, I passed by the East Sea Prefecture and met an interesting young man and also told a fortune for someone. Both of these people are very lucky people and will influence the luck of the nation. This is why I've been busy paving the road for the two, wanting to do something for them,\" explained Minister Zuo.Emperor Luo lightly nodded his head and smiled. \"I appreciate your thoughtfulness and have no worries about you. Also, that girl is too naughty, so please be tolerant of her. If she does anything to offend you, don't be afraid to teach her a lesson. There is no need to take it easy on her for my sake.\"\"Although the princess is a little willful, her gift and personality are both very good,\" said Minister Zuo.\"Alright, go on now,\" said Emperor Luo. He patted Minister Zuo on the shoulder. Minister Zuo put his hands together and started to back out of the hall. Only when he was completely outside did he turn his back to the emperor.Beads of sweat rolled down Minister Zuo's forehead. As an astrologer, he had to act with caution. There were many things he could not say. If he were to expose anything, it would be his demise. For example, Nandou Nation's fate or the Crown Prince's fortune.Minister Zuo hoped that his efforts would bring good results.What Minister Zuo didn't know was, after his departure, two people entered the hall. It was Luo Junlin and Minister Hua.Emperor Luo was writing something at his table. While writing, he spoke, \"Minister Zuo said those two were people of great luck and can change the fate of Nandou Nation. If so, then I plan on following his wishes.\"Minister Hua and the Crown Prince did not say anything. They waited quietly. They knew that Emperor Luo was writing an imperial order.Moments later, he put down his pen. At the wave of his hand, the golden scroll floated towards Minister Hua.\"Take this,\" Emperor Luo ordered. Minister Hua reached out to receive the scroll. He took one look at the order and was shocked. His Majesty was indeed the emperor of an entire nation. His order was to allow Minister Zuo to keep his pride but at the same time, get rid of any worries.\"Even though I believe in astrology, it can't be fully trusted. Fates can be change but one thing I'm sure cannot be. Under this sky and in the Nandou Nation, my will is the will of the heavens,\" said Emperor Luo. \"Minister Hua, go take care of this personally. I know that it's already the end of the year but I'm still going to have to ask you to take this trip. And the Crown Prince, you should stay in the palace and focus on cultivation. One thing that Minister Zuo said was correct. To you, besides the throne, nothing is of importance to you.\"\"Yes, Father,\" nodded Luo Junlin.\"I will hurry to Donghai City, but Your Majesty, what should I do if someone refuses the imperial order?\" asked Minister Hua.\"I have already asked you to do this personally, is there any need to question further?\" asked Emperor Luo. A wave of realization hit Minister Hua. He finally understood what the emperor meant. If it was simply to relay the imperial order, he could have sent anyone. That was the emperor's reason for asking Minister Hua to personally take this trip to Donghai City\u2014to prevent anyone from objecting. Who would dare object the imperial order in the presence of a minister?'Under this sky and in the Nandou Nation, my will is the will of the heavens.' The attitude behind these words was already very clear.\"I will be excused now,\" said Minister Hua as he bowed to leave....Ye Futian had no idea what was going on in the Imperial Palace thousands of miles away. There were only to two days until the end of the year. He still had no idea where his parents were. Were his aunt and uncle doing well? What about Ye Xiaoqin and Ye Mo, were they okay? After the year ended, he would be leaving the City of Donghai and headed for the Imperial City. His days wandering the world with Hua Jieyu were going to be very interesting.In the courtyard, Ye Futian watched as Yu Sheng and Yi Qingxuan stuck to each other like glue. He was hurt.\"Yu Sheng,\" he called. Yu Sheng lifted his head with a look of confusion.\"Cultivate properly! Stop sticking with your girlfriend everyday.\" Ye Futian sounded very serious.Yu Sheng was dumbfounded. Yi Qingxuan laughed and said to him, \"Yu Sheng, someone is being envious because Hua Jieyu isn't here.\"\"Yeah. Back in Qingzhou City, I cultivated while he and Hua Jieyu were attached at the hip every single day and then they became a couple.\" Yu Sheng nodded.On the side, Ye Futian stood up after being ignored. \"You two are awful people.\" He spun around and left. He arrived at another part of the residence. Not far ahead was a white-haired elder, sweeping the courtyard.\"Grandpa Yu!\" Ye Futian stepped forward. The elder lifted his head and smiled. \"Young Master Ye.\"\"Grandpa Yu, it's almost the end of the year, aren't you going home to celebrate?\" Ye Futian asked. These days he often came to chat with the older male.\"I don't have a home to return to.\" The elder shook his head, looking very sad.\"What do you mean you have no home to return to? Where are you from?\" Ye Futian continued to ask.\"I spent some time on an island of the East Sea. You've probably never heard of it before. Then, I ended up here in the City of Donghai. I can't go back there anymore,\" the elder said, feeling melancholy.\"Grandpa Yu, at your age you must have experienced a lot. Would you mind sharing some of your stories with me?\" Ye Futian asked with a smile.\"What kinds of stories would a person like me have? I spent my life serving others. I used to have a master who treated me very well, then trouble came knocking. But of course, Young Master Ye, you treat me very good as well,\" the elder said to Ye Futian, full of gratitude.\"Don't mention that. Grandpa Yu, you have to take extra good care of yourself at your age,\" said Ye Futian.\"Okay, okay. Young Master Ye, you should go about your own business now. You don't have to stay here with this old man,\" laughed the elder.\"Alright, then I'll leave now. I will come see you when I have time,\" Ye Futian said. He turned to leave and his eyes were shifting back and forth as if he were in deep thought.Could it really be his imagination? How come he felt distant but at the same time so familiar every time he got close to the elder? It was so difficult to comprehend these feelings!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 92": "Chapter 92: A Bolt from the BlueTranslator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo StudioThere were only two days left of the Divine Calendar's first millennium. Donghai City grew more and more festive.Many people were in the Guqin Gardens where Hua Fengliu stayed\u2014Ye Futian, Yu Sheng, Yi Qingxuan, Yi Xiang, Tang Lan, and Tang Wan.\"Tomorrow is the last day of the year. After tomorrow, I'll see you all off,\" Yi Xiang said.\"Why the hurry?\" Yi Qingxuan asked.\"Haven't you realized that people are watching the Guqin Gardens these days?\" Yi Xiang said. \"They haven't done anything so I ignored them but it's better to be safe than sorry. As the saying goes, the longer the night, the more nightmares you may receive.\"The School of the Emperor Star definitely held grudges against him and Ye Futian but hadn't made any moves. Perhaps they had their own concerns but Yi Xiang didn't care. The sooner he got Ye Futian to the Imperial City the less he worried.\"Senior Yi, you are right.\" Sitting on the side, Hua Fengliu nodded.\"You get to see her tomorrow. Are you excited?\" Tang Lan smiled at Hua Fengliu. Last time, Hua Jieyu had said that Nandou agreed to let Ye Futian and Hua Fengliu spend the New Year with Nandou Wenyin. It was a concession on the Nandou clan's part.\"No way. I want to be with you all,\" Hua Fengliu said, laughing.\"Really? Then let Futian go by himself,\" Tang Lan smiled and said.Hua Fengliu's expression was a bit awkward. He shot a glance at Ye Futian, seeming to want Ye Futian to help him out.\"Master, you decide.\" Ye Futian looked away. He couldn't help his master now. There was no loyalty at times like this.Hua Fengliu glared at Ye Futian. How could his disciple and future son-in-law be like this?\"Tang Lan, I do want to spend it with Jieyu,\" Hua Fengliu finally said with a wavering smile.Tang Lan smiled thinly and said, \"Fake.\" With that, she turned around. As she left, she said, \"I'll have the servants prepare the New Year dinner. We'll celebrate beforehand.\"\"We can do that?\" Ye Futian looked at Tang Lan's back, impressed at her decisive actions.\"Come here,\" said a cool voice. Ye Futian turned to see Hua Fengliu smiling at him. He shuddered at the strange smile and walked over to massage Hua Fengliu. \"Master, how may I help you?\"\"How can I ask you for help?\" Hua Fengliu said coldly.\"It's my duty to help my master,\" Ye Futian said earnestly. \"Oh right, I recognized Masteress as soon as I saw her last time. Only you can win the heart of someone as beautiful as her.\"\"Of course.\" Hua Fengliu smiled proudly. Back in the day, he had so many competitors. The Art Saint was the strongest one but he still won.\"Masteress is so beautiful now; I can't imagine what she looked like before. I'm sure your looks were comparable to mine,\" Ye Futian continued.Hua Fengliu was honestly impressed at how his student had successfully changed the topic.After a while, the banquet was ready. Everyone chatted and enjoyed the atmosphere. While they were gathered like a family, a group of powerful men descended from the sky outside the Guqin Garden's gate.The leader was the chief of the East Sea Prefecture, Xia Feng. Xia Fan was beside him. They had come with powerful men and a powerful aura. Xia Fan's eyes flashed dangerously.\"Enter.\" Xia Feng waved. The group instantly shot into the sky like heavenly soldiers and stepped into the garden.Inside, Yi Xiang first felt something wrong. He frowned slightly and looked towards the outside of the garden. Then everyone else followed his gaze. A moment later, they saw the malevolent group appear in the air.\"Xia Feng, what are you doing?\" Tang Lan scanned Xia Feng coldly and asked.Xia Feng's eyes glinted coldly. The group landed and walked toward the people enjoying the banquet. Beside him, Xia Fan glared coldly at Ye Futian. This was the lowly figure he once thought of as an ant he could play with but Ye Futian had almost killed him. Now, the tides had finally turned a bit.Ye Futian looked at Xia Fan with similar coldness, murderous intent flashing past his eyes.\"Sorry to disturb everyone. I am here today under an order. It is good news, so let me congratulate you first.\" Xia Feng smiled but everyone at the banquet frowned. What order was he talking about? He did not interact with the royalty of Nandou. How could he receive an order? A bad premonition grew within them.\"Ye Futian.\" Xia Feng's gaze fell on Ye Futian. Everyone's eyes turned towards him. Had the emperor given Ye Futian an order?\"The emperor proclaims that due to the extraordinary talent of Ye Futian of the East Sea Prefecture, he is given the title of Study Attendant of the Crown Prince. From now on, he will accompany the Crown Prince in his studies and cultivation.\"Xia Feng smiled at Ye Futian while speaking. That day at Donghai Academy, Ye Futian had rejected the Crown Prince's invitation to be the minister. He could have gone straight to the top but he did not know what was good for himself. Now, the Crown Prince was probably angered. He had the Emperor pass the decree and sent Minister Hua to collect him from Donghai City. What this implied went without saying.Ye Futian had to go.\"It is not the end of the year yet,\" Xia Feng continued. \"His Majesty allows him to wait until the year passes. We will embark on the first day of the new year.\"Everyone at the banquet stared at him. The Study Attendant of the Crown Prince was an opportunity that many dreamed of. There was a chance of extreme success. However, it was not a good thing for Ye Futian, especially since he'd just politely rejected the prince. Now, the Emperor had sent this direct order without giving any way to back out of it.Ye Futian's eyes flashed; he was angry inside. At the Assembly of the Seven Schools, the Crown Prince had asked if he knew the consequences of disobeying the crown's orders. He was not the Emperor but he was the Crown Prince.The Emperor's order was here.For the first time, Ye Futian experienced the power, aggressiveness, and coldness of the crown. There was no respect for him\u2014there was no need to respect him. Minister Zuo had wanted him to attend the Tingfeng Banquet in the Imperial City. He'd planned on leaving after the New Year but he never thought that a decree would order him to go.\"The Study Attendant?\" Ye Futian asked coldly. They wanted him to accompany the prince? Right now, he was even wondering if there was still a need to attend the Tingfeng Banquet. Minister Zuo had thought so highly of him but had probably not thought of this result.Ye Futian could feel that this was not Minister Zuo's idea. Minister Zuo had been very friendly toward him and would definitely respect his opinion. He would not force him to the Imperial City in this way and would definitely not have Xia Feng do it.\"Got it,\" Ye Futian said coolly.Xia Feng's eyes sharpened and focused on Ye Futian.\"This is the Emperor's decree. Ye Futian, watch your attitude,\" Xia Fan said in a frigid tone.\"The Emperor gave me the title of the Crown Prince's Study Attendant. He's not punishing me so what's with your attitude?\" Ye Futian sat there, staring at Xia Fan. These men had broken into the Guqin Gardens to announce this as if he was a criminal.Xia Feng sneered inwardly. He realized that Ye Futian knew he had angered the Crown Prince and was being taken forcefully. Minister Hua was the one in charge and Ye Futian obviously knew what this meant.Xia Fan narrowed his eyes and then laughed. He said, \"Very good. I'd like to see how much longer you smile for. I forgot to tell you that Minister Hua is going to the Nandou clan today with another decree.\"The moment he finished, Ye Futian rose. He stared daggers at Xia Fan. \"What decree?\"\"Guess.\" Xia Fan smiled and said, \"It's related to your girlfriend.\"\"Okay, is this your business?\" Xia Feng said indifferently. Faced with a group of cold glares, he said, \"Sorry for the disruption. I'll be waiting outside and we'll go as soon as New Years is over.\"With that, Xia Feng waved and they sauntered off.Ye Futian and the others stared at the backs of Xia Feng's group. They still had not recovered. The happy atmosphere was completely gone with gray clouds over their heads.Ye Futian and Hua Fengliu were especially unsettled.. . . . . .At the same time that Xia Feng announced the decree, Minister Hua had arrived at the Nandou clan. Nandou Tai, the clan leader, welcomed him personally.Seeing him, Minister Hua smiled and said, \"Brother Nandou, congratulations.\"\"What do you mean?\" Nandou Tai was confused.\"It is great news. His Majesty has a decree. Is Hua Jieyu here?\"Nandou Tai's eyes flashed. He didn't understand why Minister Hua would need Hua Jieyu. Was the Emperor's decree related to Jieyu?Had Minister Zuo said something to the Emperor? But then why would Minister Hua be here?\"I'll call her over now,\" Nandou Tai said.\"No need. I'll go personally so please bring me to her,\" Minister Hua said with a smile.Nandou Tai was even more confused but he nodded and said, \"Alright. After you.\"With that, the group started off and arrived in Nandou Wenyin's residence. After hearing the news, she and Hua Jieyu came out and stared at the newcomer in confusion.Minister Hua gazed at Hua Jieyu and smiled. \"As expected, you are a beauty. No wonder you have an extraordinary fate.\"\"Minister Hua, please enlighten us,\" Nandou Tai said. Had Minister Zuo really said something about her fate? But an astrologer always kept fates a secret, especially one like Jieyu's. Nandou Tai did not dare publicize it and not even anyone in the clan knew. He was worried that revealing it would affect Jieyu's fate.\"The Emperor has proclaimed Hua Jieyu as the Crown Princess. She will travel the palace in the year 10001 of the Divine Calendar for the title ceremony,\" Minister Hua said. He thought, No wonder the emperor is the emperor. With these two decrees, Minister Zuo isn't put in a difficult position but the fatal problems are solved. Since these two will influence the nation, then give them riches and keep them where they can be easily controlled.If anyone had any objections, he could make a prompt decision. Fates could be changed but the royal order could not be disobeyed!To Hua Jieyu, this order was like a bolt from the blue!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 93": "Chapter 93: I Am Fated to Be EmperorTranslator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo StudioIn a split second, Hua Jieyu felt completely lifeless. Her face was as pale as a ghost.His Majesty had bestowed the title of the Crown Princess upon her. She was to leave on the first day of the new year. Just a moment ago, she was chatting with her mother about the events of tomorrow, when her father and Ye Futian was to come. Then, without warning, she was hit with this news.Nandou Wenyin, Nandou Tai and the rest were all in shock, unable to recover.This...is this fate? Nandou Tai asked himself. To be honest, he did not fully comprehend what Minister Zuo meant when he said that Hua Jieyu was fated to be an empress, mother of the world. But now he knew. Minister Zuo meant empress to an emperor, emperor of the Nandou Nation.\"No...\" said Hua Jieyu. She had finally pulled herself out of her daze. Her eyes showed determination as she said to Minister Hua, \"I refuse.\"Minister Hua frowned. \"Nonsense, this is an imperial order from His Majesty.\"\"I refuse,\" Hua Jieyu repeated with a cold demeanor. She was still looking at him. Minister Hua's gaze was sharp as a knife but the girl standing in front of him showed no fear.\"Brother Nandou, does the Nandou clan plan on going against the imperial order?\" Minister Hua asked.\"Please forgive her Minister Hua. She's just being stubborn. Please allow me to talk some sense into her,\" said Nandou Tai. He had a change in expression. The Nandou clan was no longer royal; they were in no position to fight against the imperial power.\"Fine, I'll give you guys two days. During these two days, I will be staying here and on the first day of the new year, we will be on our way back to the Imperial City,\" said Minister Hua. As he turned to leave, he sneered. Disobeying the imperial order? Who dared to do so in front of Minister Hua?After Nandou Tai watched Minister Hua leave, his attention fell on Hua Jieyu. He said, \"Jieyu, the Crown Prince was born to become emperor. He is an outstanding young man. He is in his twenties and still unmarried. This tells you a lot about his personality. A chance like this only falls to one person in all of the Nandou Nation and now fate has chosen one. You are to become the mother of the world.\"\"I don't need fate like this,\" Hua Jieyu said to Nandou Tai.He saw the determination in her eyes and continued to try to persuade her, \"Jieyu, you're only 17, this thing you have with Ye Futian is only temporary. One day, when you guys are standing at two different levels, you'll forget about all this. As long as you agree to this, I'll send people to bring your father into the Nandou Palace and your family will be united again.\"Hua Jieyu looked at Nandou Tai with ice cold eyes. \"I'm not going to agree and neither will my father.\"\"Wenyin, talk some sense into her.\" Nandou Tai looked at Nandou Wenyin who stood behind her daughter.\"Now that there are bigger benefits for you, you're willing to let him come back?\" Nandou Wenyin sneered at Nandou Tai. \"Do you really think we'll be happy with a family reunion brought by the sacrifice of our daughter? I won't agree to this.\"Nandou Tai's expression did not look good. Coldy, he said, \"Even if you guys object, this is an imperial order. Who can disobey an imperial order? There is still one day for you guys to think this over.\" After that, Nandou Tai left with a sunken face.Following immediately after his departure, Hua Jieyu's eyes filled with tears as she turned to look at her mother. \"Mother!\" In her voice was a deep melancholy. She seemed so weak at this moment. The usual air that surrounded her was no longer there.\"My poor child,\" said Nandou Wenyin. She walked up to her daughter and held Hua Jieyu's tear-stained face in her own hands. Her heart hurt to see her child like this.How could both of their lives turn out this way? Why couldn't they be with the person they loved?Nandou Wenyin was the one person who could truly understand what Hua Jieyu was feeling at the moment because she had also been through this. They didn't care for nobility. All they wanted was to be with the one they loved.Just then, a figure came running. It was Nandou Wenshan who had just received the news. Seeing the mother and daughter, his heart was in pain. Hua Jieyu was even more outstanding than her mother. She was destined to be different. Now, she had been given the title of Crown Princess. Was this what Minister Zuo saw in her fortune? Was this her destiny?\"Mother, I miss him. I want to go see him,\" Hua Jieyu said while crying.\"Silly girl, they're not going to let you step outside.\" Nandou Wenyin shook her head. She had been through all of this before. But Hua Jieyu did not seem to have heard her mother's words. She turned around and attempted to leave. However, at this moment, multiple figures appeared in the courtyard. They were all powerful cultivators of the Nandou clan. His Majesty's imperial order has fallen upon the Nandou clan but Hua Jieyu objected. In a situation like this, how could they let her leave? Even if the people of the clan didn't stop her, Minister Hua would have. There was no way she was stepping foot outside of Nandou Palace.Hua Jieyu looked at the figures in the courtyard and her gaze cooled. She then turned and returned to her residence.\"Jieyu, sometimes people just can't fight fate,\" sighed Nandou Wenshan. He was also sad. In this situation, there was no solution and no way to fight it.This time, it was even harder to fight than with Nandou Wenyin's situation all those years ago. The rival back then was just the Art Saint. Even though the Nandou clan wanted to create a connection to Minister Hua, who was related to the Art Saint, the clan still held the power of nobilities due to their background and there was not an absolute need to set Nandou Wenyin up with the Art Saint to acquire power. And because of this, the Art Saint had no right to come and demand Nandou Wenyin to marry him. But things were different now. Now, it was the title of Crown Princess. His Majesty wrote the imperial order himself. Nobody, in all of the Nandou Nation, could deny the order.\"No, I've said before, I don't believe in fate.\" Hua Jieyu looked at her uncle and shook her head. \"I'm not going to the Imperial Palace and I'm not going to be the Crown Princess. Not now, not ever.\"\"Jieyu, don't think that way.\" Nandou Wenshan's expression changed. Hue Jieyu was way too determined, to the point that Nandou Wenshan was afraid. If Hua Jieyu wanted to deny the imperial order, there was only one way. He was not willing to see her go down that road.\"Uncle, can you stop by the Guqin Gardens for me?\" Hua Jieyu did not respond to her uncle's previous utterance. Instead, she made a request, tears streaming down her face.\"What do you want?\" asked Nandou Wenshan.\"Can you tell him not to come tomorrow? Just tell him that the clan won't allow it.\" Her voice was filled with sadness. Her tears could not be stopped as she spoke. Of course, she wished for him to come but she knew, deep down, there was no way of denying the imperial order. If he came, it would only put him in danger. She did not wish for anything to happen to Ye Futian.\"What if he finds out what happened?\" asked Nandou Wenshan.\"Then tell him that I have no feelings for him anymore and that I want to be the Crown Princess. Tell him to forget about me and never look for me again,\" said Hua Jieyu. The tears continued to stream down her face and her own words cut into her heart like knives.Hearing her words, Nandou Wenshan also felt pained. His heart clenched for his niece.\"Are you sure that's what you want to tell him?\" he asked.Hua Jieyu nodded her head in response.\"Okay.\" Nandou Wenshan nodded as well. \"I'll head over now.\" He then turned to leave.Watching him leave, Hua Jieyu crouched down on the ground. Her arms hugged her knees as she cried her eyes out.Nandou Wenyin did not know when it happened but her tears were filled with tears as well. She walked beside Hua Jieyu and hugged her lightly.\"Mother, I don't know why but my heart really hurts,\" Hua Jieyu said. Her tone was heartbreaking to listen to.\"Mother's heart is also in pain.\" Nandou Wenyin hated herself for being so useless.\"Mother, if anything happens to me, you have to take care of yourself,\" said Hua Jieyu.\"Silly girl,\" Nandou Wenyin's heart squeezed at Hua Jieyu's words but she had no idea how to comfort her daughter. She herself has had this type of thought countless times, but she had Hua Jieyu; she had a child with the man she loved....At the Guqin Gardens, Ye Futian was feeling confused after hearing Xia Fan's words. The happy atmosphere at the residence had been ruined. They were no longer worried about Ye Futian becoming the Crown Prince's study attendant. They were more worried about what type of order had fallen upon the Nandou clan.Ye Futian had initially wanted to go check things out at the Nandou Palace but was stopped by Yi Xiang and Tang Wan. They had yet to straighten things out and Xia Feng was still watching from the outside. If Ye Futian stepped outside, it could be dangerous for him. Tang Wan ordered her first disciple, Nie Bing, to check outside while they waited inside. But before Nie Bing returned, Nandou Wenshan arrived at the Guqin Gardens.Ye Futian rushed to Nandou Wenshan immediately. His eyes were frozen on the elder male.\"What happened here?\" asked Nandou Wenshan. He had seen the obvious group of people outside.\"His Majesty gave an imperial order. He wants me to be the Crown Prince's study attendant,\" answered Ye Futian.Nandou Wenshan's face fell. This young couple, Ye Futian was bestowed with the title of the Crown Prince's study attendant while Hua Jieyu was going to be the Crown Princess. To outsiders, this might have seemed like a good thing, but anyone who knew of Hua Jieyu and Ye Futian's relationship knew that this was a calamity.\"Where's Jieyu?\" Ye Futian was looking straight at Nandou Wenshan.\"Jieyu wanted me to bring you a message,\" said Nandou Wenshan.\"What is it?\" asked Ye Futian.\"She says she no longer has feelings for you and that she wants to be the Crown Princess, so you should forget about her and never look for her again,\" Nandou Wenshan said while staring into the young man's eyes. He felt so cruel, but he understood why Hua Jieyu would say such hurtful things to Ye Futian.Ye Futian felt like he was hit by lightning. He was frozen in place, not because of the cruel words but because of the meaning behind them. In an instant, he figured out what the imperial order for the Nandou clan was.\"Dummy,\" Ye Futian opened his mouth after a long while. Nandou Wenshan was dumbfounded. Then, he watched as the young man lifted his head towards himself. With red eyes, Ye Futian said, \"Did she really think that I would believe those words? Does that dummy think I'm an idiot?\"Nandou Wenshan was speechless.\"Uncle, tell me. How is she doing now?\" asked Ye Futian.Nandou Wenshan's heart clench when Ye Futian called him that. He said, \"I'm really worried about her. She said that she will never step foot in the Imperial Palace and will never become the Crown Princess. Never.\"\"Of course not. She's mine!\" Ye Futian continued, \"Why would that idiot of an emperor give such an order?\"\"I don't know the specifics, but there is one thing I can tell you,\" said Nandou Wenshan. \"Minister Zuo once told Jieyu's fortune. He said she was fated to be an empress. Maybe he told the emperor. This must be her destiny.\"\"Minister Zuo? Empress?\" Ye Futian looked at Nandou Wenshan. \"Minister Zuo is an astrologer?\"\"Yeah,\" nodded Nandou Wenshan. At this moment, a lot of things suddenly became clear to Ye Futian.\"You're wrong, Minister Zuo won't tell the emperor,\" said Ye Futian. Nandou Wenshan lifted his head to look at Ye Futian, confused.\"If Fox is fated to be empress, then that means Minister Zuo must have looked at my fortune as well,\" Ye Futian said in all seriousness. \"If she is fated to be empress, then I am fated to be emperor!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This guy was talented but saying he was fated to be an emperor was a bit too much. However, he didn't doubt it. Minister Zuo had given Ye Futian the minister decree and probably had really tested Ye Futian's fate. It meant that he couldn't have an average fate.Looking at the handsome figure before him, Nandou Wenshan said, \"No matter what, do not go to the Nandou clan tomorrow. If it's truly as you said, that Minister Zuo didn't tell the Emperor, then there's more to the fact that he sent Minister Hua. If you object, he will definitely not treat you nicely.\"\"Uncle, if I have the fate of an emperor and don't mind what happened before, will Nandou support me?\" Ye Futian asked instead of replying to what Nandou Wenshan said.The Nandou clan was the previous royalty after all. They had strong foundations and were established in Donghai City. If they could abandon everything of Nandou Kingdom, they might be able to change the situation and fight with Minister Hua.\"This guy\u2026\" Nandou Wenshan looked at Ye Futian. It seemed that the youth had lost his cool.It was the Emperor's decree for Minister Hua to come and give the title of Crown Princess. Ye Futian was only seventeen. No matter how talented he was, it didn't mean anything. The Crown Prince was more talented; there wasn't even a need to choose. How could Ye Futian prove that he had an emperor's fate?\"You have to think clearly and not muddle your mind. Would you like me to pass a word on to Jieyu? I'm afraid she'll do something silly,\" Nandou Wenshan said.\"Uncle, tell that silly girl to not do anything silly and wait for me. Minister Zuo was right. She has the fate of an empress and is destined to be the mother of the world,\" Ye Futian said.\u00a0He trusted Minister Zuo's prediction because his godfather and Emperor Ye Qing had said similar things before.\"Okay.\" Nandou Wenshan sighed inwardly. He glanced at Hua Fengliu again but left without saying anything more. It had seemed that everything was improving. The clan leader had agreed for Nandou Wenyin and Hua Jieyu to come to the Guqin Gardens but the decree had changed everything.In the garden, everyone stood behind Ye Futian. They didn't know what to say and couldn't comfort him. The mood was repressive.Ye Futian turned. Seeing all the eyes on him, he forced a smile and said, \"What are you all looking at me for? It's getting late. Go rest.\" To Hua Fengliu, he said, \"Master, let's go back.\" He carried Hua Fengliu toward his own yard. Yi Xiang looked at their receding backs and sighed inwardly. He had planned on taking this group of extremely talented youths to the Imperial City tomorrow for the Tingfeng Banquet. With Ye Futian and Yu Sheng's skills, they could definitely surpass the others. They also had Minister Zuo's help and would have a smooth path to becoming the best of the kingdom. But this decree had destroyed everything\u2014Minister Zuo's anticipations and their plans. Ye Futian had just called His Majesty of Nandou the idiot king. His mood was clear. Even though he was only 17, the man was not the king in his eyes.The Study Attendant of the Crown Prince? In a few years, he might become more impressive than the prince. Now, he was only worried that he would die young.Just as Ye Futian had guessed, even though Yi Xiang had accepted Yu Sheng as his disciple, he also saw Ye Futian as a disciple but treated them differently. Otherwise, he wouldn't help Ye Futian so much.. . . . . .At night, there was music in the garden. Ye Futian sat there, playing his guqin. There was a breeze and it was quite cold but Ye Futian's heart was even colder. He played with his eyes closed. At this moment, he thought of many happy memories. A beautiful face appeared in his mind. She was so beautiful but also playful.They had met for the first time when they were 12. The 12-year-old girl already had shocking looks. He said that if she was like this at 12, she'd become a fox when she grew up.At 15, they met again in the Qingzhou Academy. The girl purposely lied to everyone so they would have misunderstandings, making him gain a bunch of enemies. Later, he cultivated with his master. They had months of interactions and play\u2014almost like flirting in hindsight. A warm smile appeared on his face.Later, the girl went to the Ye mansion, shocking everyone there. The two then joined hands by the Qingzhou Lake to announce their relationship. Then, they separated.After that, something happened in Qingzhou City. He crossed the East Sea and caused a commotion in Donghai Academy so she would know he was there. They met again in the Guqin Gardens and the girl hugged him gently.The two were in love but didn't dare to publicize it until the School of the Emperor Star started suspecting it. When Mu Yunxuan spread the rumors, he walked into the School of the Emperor Star. He marked their relationship with a kiss, leading to the battle at the gate of the school. They held hands and smiled, facing the future fearlessly.In the School of the Finance Star, the two slept in each other's arms. The girl was shy but did not stop him. He knew that she was willing to give him everything. He swore in his heart that he would marry her. However, no one expected that fate was a joke. The Imperial City's order was so aggressive and merciless; it destroyed everything.The music went from heartwarming to sweet. It seemed to contain deep emotions and gradually grew depressed, furious, and hateful, wishing to cut apart the world.With a clang, the string snapped and the music cut off. Ye Futian opened his eyes. He looked at the broken string; his eyes were still sharp. When he looked up, he saw the old man with a broom under the moonlight. The violence in his eyes disappeared.He asked, \"Grandpa Yu, why aren't you resting?\"\"I was attracted by your music,\" the old man said with a smile. \"Young Master, your music is a bit chaotic today. Did something happen?\"Ye Futian glanced at him and felt something affectionate. He said, \"Grandpa Yu, someone wants to steal the girl I love.\"\"How can someone dare to steal Young Master Ye's girl?\" the man asked in confusion.\"The emperor of Nandou. He ordered my girl to become the Crown Princess,\" Ye Futian said. \"Grandpa Yu, what should I do?\"\"If she's your girl, steal her back. So what if he's the emperor?\" Yu said naturally. Hearing his calm voice, Ye Futian's eyes narrowed. The old man's eyes were cloudy but he seemed to feel nothing wrong with the logic.Ye Futian smiled brightly. \"Grandpa Yu, you're right. If she's my girl, so what if he's the emperor?\"\"Young Master Ye, please rest early. I'll go now.\" The old man stooped low and left. Looking at his back, Ye Futian's smile grew determined.The night was as still as water. Ye Futian didn't sleep the entire night. Later, a Black Wind Eagle landed soundlessly in the garden. Ye Futian climbed onto it and wind appeared. The eagle flapped its wings and flew. However, the moment the Black Wind Eagle shot into the sky, a figure appeared out of thin air and blocked him. It was Yi Xiang.\"Where are you sneaking off to at night? Are you a thief?\" a cold voice sounded behind him. Ye Futian turned to see Tang Lan there.\"Senior Yi, Aunt Tang.\" Ye Futian smiled wryly. It seemed that everyone was guarding him instead of sleeping. People appeared one after another down below. Yu Sheng, Yi Qingxuan, and Tang Wan were all there, looking up at him. They had guessed he would run away alone.\"Whatever you want to do, talk about it after tonight,\" Yi Xiang said coldly.Ye Futian knew he couldn't leave now. He just nodded and had the eagle land on the ground. Then he went to his room to rest. The others watched him without leaving. They sat in the garden, guarding him.. . . . . .It was the last day of year 10000 of the Divine Calendar.In the morning, Ye Futian walked out of his room and saw the people sitting in the courtyard. It made him feel warm inside. These people were all part of his family.\"Master, you're up so early too,\" Ye Futian said, walking to Hua Fengliu who was on the bench.\"Aren't we going to see your Masteress and Jieyu today? I'm excited so I woke up early,\" Hua Fengliu said with a smile.\"You're not allowed to go,\" Tang Lan said, glaring at Hua Fengliu.\"She's right. Master, you shouldn't go because of your body. I'll bring Masteress and Jieyu here,\" Ye Futian said.\"If you dare leave me behind, you can go find another teacher,\" Hua Fengliu said with a glare.\"Fine, as if I need you,\" Ye Futian replied.Everyone listened as they argued but it felt bittersweet.Hua Fengliu stared at Ye Futian and said, \"Try me.\"\"Aunt Tang, please help me look after him. He's already like this but he's still conceited,\" Ye Futian said to Tang Lan, almost harshly.\"You're really going?\" Yi Xiang asked Ye Futian.The youth nodded. He had no choice\u2014if he didn't go, there was no saying what that silly girl would do. No matter what the ending was like, he had to go try. Otherwise, he wouldn't admit defeat.\"What are you looking at me like that for?\" Ye Futian said, smiling as he looked at everyone. \"I have an emperor's fate. I won't die so easily and I'm going to bring Masteress and Fox here.\"Yu Sheng followed him and Yi Qingxuan followed Yu Sheng.\"What are you doing?\" Ye Futian asked Yu Sheng.\"Going with you,\" he replied.\"I'm going to see my wife. What are you going for? Your wife is behind you,\" Ye Futian said but Yu Sheng didn't move. \"Get the f*ck back!\" Ye Futian yelled.Yu Sheng didn't move.\"Yu Sheng, come back,\" Yi Xiang said to his disciple. Yu Sheng looked back. \"I'm going with him,\" Yi Xiang said.Yu Sheng's eyes were red and his fists were clenched tightly.Ye Futian looked up at Yi Xiang, saying, \"I'm not your disciple. What are you going for?\"\"You're an idiot,\" Yi Xiang replied coldly.Ye Futian froze. Looking at the man, he finally smiled and said, \"You're the real idiot.\"As he spoke, he started walking out. Yi Xiang followed behind him, but not without glaring at Yu Sheng and Yi Qingxuan. \"Be obedient. Tang Lan, watch them for me.\"Tang Lan's eyes were red too. Seeing the two leave, she muttered, \"You're all idiots!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 95": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Legend of FutianCH 95Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe last day of the Divine Prefecture Calendar Year 10000 did not seem like it was going to be a peaceful day. The news of Ye Futian being ordered to become the Crown Prince's study attendant and Hua Jieyu to be the Crown Princess hit Donghai Academy like a storm. Everybody was in shock.Hua Jieyu and Ye Futian were once the most well-known couple on campus, as well as the most gifted. They were a match made in heaven, but with one imperial order from the Imperial City, the young couple was destined for a sad ending. Nobody thought that they could go against the imperial order. The only thing left to do was to go where fate takes you.Ye Futian had once rejected the Crown Prince's offer but now, there was no way out. This was the power of royalty. But of course, if Ye Futian just gave in, he would have the opportunity to climb up the power ladder. However, according to what the people of Donghai Academy knew about Ye Futian, there was no way he would give in. Otherwise, he would not have rejected the Crown Prince's offer during the Assembly of the Seven Schools.At the School of the Emperor Star, many people were gathered. Headmaster Yan Shao, his disciple, Zhuo Qing, Vice Headmaster Han Mo, as well as other officials,\u00a0were all present.\"Where are Headmaster and the rest going?\" asked a student watching the group from afar.\"I heard they're going to the Nandou Palace to congratulate Hua Jieyu for being chosen as the Crown Princess,\" said a knowledgeable student.At the mention of Hua Jieyu's name, many people were feeling conflicted. The young woman once cultivated at the School of the Emperor Star. She was a goddess to many, the girl of their dreams. She was outstanding and beautiful but, in the end, she betrayed their school. And now, she was going to be the Crown Princess and the empress in the future. From now on, they were only worthy of looking up at her. Perhaps only a perfect girl like her was worthy of all this.As for Ye Futian, it was bound to be a tragedy.The large group from the School of the Emperor Star set off for the Nandou Palace.The people of Donghai Academy were not the only ones who knew of these new developments. The news has spread like wildfire all through the City of Donghai. Many powerful people who found out about the news all headed over to the palace to congratulate the Nandou clan on this last day before the new year.The clan was already powerful because they had a royal background, but now, one of their younger members had been bestowed the title of the Crown Princess. This was the perfect chance to establish a great relationship with the clan. Plus, Minister Hua was also at the palace.The Nandou clan, the used-to-be royal family, had become the main focus of everyone once again. Today was definitely not going to be a quiet day.Just as Yi Xiang and Ye Futian stepped out of the Guqin Gardens, Xia Feng, Xia Fan, and their people surrounded the two of them. Xia Feng asked Ye Futian, \"Where are you going?\"\"Does His Majesty's imperial order also include restricting my freedom?\" asked Ye Futian.\"Obviously not but we're heading to the Imperial City tomorrow, so it's best for you not to go running about.\" Xia Feng smiled.Ye Futian gave him an icy glance then picked up his feet to leave. Xia Fan smiled and asked, \"Can't keep yourself from seeing your lover?\"Ye Futian stopped in his tracks and turned to look at Xia Fan. Xia Fan was giving him an evil smile and said, \"That's all in the past now. She's going to be the Crown Princess. You better keep yourself in check and know your place. If you keep having these thoughts, I'm afraid....\" Xia Fan laughed but did not continue. The mocking look in his eyes became more obvious. He was provoking Ye Futian on purpose. He actually hoped that Ye Futian would cause a ruckus by disobeying the imperial order. This way, it would be a dead end for him. Literally. No one was going to be able to save him.Ye Futian suddenly gave Xia Fan a smile before walking towards him. Xia Fan watched Ye Futian as he neared. The smug look on his face grew. Did Ye Futian think he was still the genius cultivator that Minister Zuo favored? Things were different now. Only bad things were waiting for Ye Futian. The Crown Prince obviously had it out for him.Ye Futian stopped in front of Xia Fan with a charming, bright smile. He then took out the Decree of the Minister and showed it to Xia Fan. \"Do you know what this is?\"The look on Xia Fan's face changed a little. Was Ye Futian really threatening him with the Decree of the Minister at a time like this?Just then, Ye Futian acted at the speed of light. His fist landed right on Xia Fan's face. Because Xia Fan had no time to react, to defend himself, he was knocked down to the ground, face first.\"How presumptuous!\" yelled Xia Feng. The powerful cultivators came in closer. Yi Xiang also came closer behind Ye Futian. His aura was domineering and his long robe blew in the wind.\"Even if he doesn't know what this is, you should know, right?\" Ye Futian held the Decree of the Minister up for Xia Feng to see. \"I was bestowed the title of the Crown Prince's study attendant by His Majesty and give this decree by Minister Zuo. To insult me in public, is that dissatisfaction with the Emperor or is he looking down on Minister Zuo?\"Xia Feng's expression darkened at Ye Futian's words. However, he did not dare to lay a hand on Ye Futian. Even though Ye Futian was most likely going to end up being very pitiful, there was nothing wrong with what he said.Xia Fan crawled off the ground, blood in the corners of his mouth. A bruise had already formed on his face. He threw Ye Futian a murderous look as he continued to stare. However, he made no moves to get revenge. Instead, he smiled a creepy smile and said, \"You're right, my actions were too rash. I apologize.\" Xia Fan believed that Ye Futian would be dead soon. He'll allow him to be arrogant for a little longer. He would take the punch.Ye Futian saw the creepy smile on Xia Fan's face and returned it with a cold, icy glare. He did nothing to hide his murderous intentions. Turning around, Ye Futian was on his way again.\"Follow,\" ordered Xia Feng when he saw Yi Xiang and Ye Futian leaving. A large group following obnoxiously after the two and the headed in the direction of the Nandou Palace all together.This day was not a quiet one for the Nandou clan. People kept arriving with congratulatory words. The guests were all powerful people of Donghai City. The large palace was filled with guests for the first time in a long time. At this scene, the people of the clan felt as if they have recovered their glory. Many people were very excited at this and imagined the clan's bright future.The only thing giving the clan a headache was Hua Jieyu's attitude. She still seemed to be very put off by this situation. Many people in the clan could not understand. Was this because of Ye Futian? Everyone knew who to choose between a gifted young man and a gifted Crown Prince? Why was she still stuck on Ye Futian? It was all because she was still too young. Hua Jieyu was still at the age that her imaginations were more important than reality.At this moment, outside the palace, a black wind eagle landed on the ground. Two figures got off of the eagle. It was Yi Xiang and Ye Futian. When Ye Futian saw how lively the palace was, his heart clenched. The two of them stepped to the entrance of the palace. There stood two powerful members of the Nandou clan. They had been welcoming guests. Their face fell as soon as they saw Ye Futian. Coldly, they asked, \"What are you doing here?\" Presently, he was the one person that the whole clan dreaded seeing the most.\"I came to look for my Masteress and my girlfriend. Didn't the clan already agree to it?\" asked Ye Futian.\"Nonsense. There is no one here that can be your girlfriend,\" a middle-aged man reprimanded. How dare Ye Futian called Hua Jieyu his girlfriend now that she was given the title of the Crown Princess?\"You'll see whether or not my girlfriend is here if you let me in,\" Ye Futian tried to take a step forward but was blocked by multiple bodies.Yi Xiang stood behind Ye Futian, exuding a powerful aura. The powerful cultivators of the Nandou clan looked at him with different expressions from before.\"I think you guys should go and announce his arrival,\" said Yi Xiang.The leader of the group blocking Ye Futian looked at Yin Xiang. Then he gave a command to someone behind him, and that person ran into the palace.Ye Futian and Yi Xiang stood quietly outside the entrance of the palace. Inside the palace, Nandou Tai had set up a huge celebration to receive Minister Hua and the guests. At the party, every table was full and laughter filled the air. Everyone was getting along well and more and more arrived. Just then, a person came running and whispered in Nandou Tai's ear. Whatever this person told him caused a change in his facial expression.\"What's wrong, Brother Nandou?\" Beside Nandou Tai, Minister Hua quickly picked up the vibe that something was wrong.\"It's nothing, Brother Hua. I will take care of it,\" Nandou Tai answered with a smile. It was as if truly there was nothing wrong.\"If he's here, then let him in,\" said Minister Hua. Ye Futian came at the perfect time.Something flashed through Nandou Tai's eyes and he nodded as he told his subordinate what to do, \"Let him in.\"\"Yes, Clan Leader,\" said the messenger. Minister Hua picked up his cup for a quick drink, his eyes cold. To dare to show up at a setting like this today, Ye Futian most not be able to let things go. If so, he was going to learn the consequences of being young and stubborn. Death was the only result of defying an imperial order. This was probably part of the reason why Emperor Luo sent Minister Hua. Very quickly, everyone in the clan knew of Ye Futian's arrival.Outside the palace, Ye Futian received his reply. The members of the clan led the way. Ye Futian looked into the spacious palace and turned to Yi Xiang beside him. \"Senior, if anything happens, just leave. Forget about me.\"\"Can you shut up?\" reprimanded Yi Xiang.Ye Futian did not know what to say and shut his mouth. Taking a step forward, Ye Futian stepped into the Nandou Palace for the second time.Following the main road in the middle, people kept appearing on the sides. They were all glaring at Ye Futian with rage. There were even those who spoke up to tell him off. \"Jieyu is already the Crown Princess, how dare you still come here?\"\"You didn't even dare to fight last time. How can you be so thick-skinned and show up here again?\"Similar insults were continuously thrown at Ye Futian. Suddenly, Ye Futian stopped in his tracks. Staring straight ahead, he said, \"A family of fallen royals, kicked off the throne. To be proud of marrying into the new royal family instead of being ashamed. I can't believe the Nandou family clan has fallen so low. How pitiful.\"\"What did you say?\" At Ye Futian's words, a lot of people stepped up, giving off a murderous vibe.\"I said that Nandou family clan doesn't know what pride is. I didn't want to battle last time because I wanted to leave you guys with your pride but since you guys are all so shameless anyway, then today I will let the Nandou clan know just how inferior you guys are,\" said Ye Futian.Afterward, a pair of beautiful golden wings appeared. The bright Roc Spirit was released behind Ye Futian. Then, he was lifted into the sky. An immensely bright light formed by the gathering of Spiritual Qi shined all over his body.\"Ye Futian, six-starred Glory Plane cultivator, challenges everyone in the Nandou clan who is in or below the Dharma Plane,\" he said.The Ye Futian at this moment possessed such a powerful aura. He was going to release his full potential!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It transformed into a terrifying sound wave that swept through the Nandou clan. Various seniors stepped out, glaring furiously at Ye Futian as if they had been utterly humiliated.\"Presumptuous.\"\"You don't know your place. You're looking for death.\"The voices kept coming. Ye Futian, Six-star Glory Plane, dared to challenge everyone in the Nandou clan under the Dharma Plane? What did he take the Nandou clan for? They had once been the royal clan. Though they had fallen now, they still had a strong base and were at least the tip of the pyramid in Donghai City. But Ye Futian had spoken as if they were nothing. This was unacceptable.The older generation all stared daggers at him. This kid was too wild. Did he think that no one dared to touch him because he had the minister's decree? If Ye Futian dared to do anything today, he could be counted as dead already. If not for some concerns, some wanted to wipe him out of existence but they would leave that to Minister Hua. Jieyu already hated the Nandou clan. If they killed Ye Futian too, there would be no reconciliation between them.Though they couldn't kill him, they would still make life difficult for him since he said something so blasphemous.\"I am a Seven-star Glory Plane. I'm enough to exterminate you.\" A younger member of the Nandou clan jumped out. A wind element robe was wrapped around his body and he flashed with golden light. He held a golden spear in his hands. As soon as he spoke, he sprang towards Ye Futian like lightning. The golden spear spun, releasing a golden glow. Unstoppable power brewed in it and it was about to reach Ye Futian.Green Spiritual Qi glowed around Ye Futian. The wood element Lock of a Thousand Vines was released with rustles. They covered the sky and went to enclose the opponent.The Nandou clan member roared but he didn't dodge it. He had a higher cultivation than Ye Futian and also had the extremely powerful metal element battle techniques. He would not fear Ye Futian.The spinning golden spear cut through everything. Many vines were destroyed but Ye Futian's Lock of a Thousand Vines was too sturdy. The man quickly realized that his spear couldn't keep up with the speed of the vines coming. The vines quickly wrapped around him. Then, the thick vines tied him down. His legs, arms, and neck were all tied tightly. The vines cut into his wrist and his spear fell from his hands. His neck was strangled, turning his face beet red. He couldn't move at all, immobilized in midair.Ye Futian stood before him. His wings flapped with a gold halo around him. His eyes were so sharp. \"I don't want to fight any more failures like this.\" Ye Futian flashed and his wings swept over, slapping the man to the ground. Then Ye Futian continued forward arrogantly.A Seven-star Glory Plane man had been defeated by one blow. He couldn't even break through Ye Futian's one spell.Ye Futian continued forward, reducing the Nandou clan to nothing in his eyes.In the near distance, Yi Xiang strolled behind him. Of course, he understood that Ye Futian barely had any chances of surviving here today but the youth didn't want to give up. What would he do to win a shred of hope for himself?More and more powerful members of the Nandou clan gathered around him. Another figure sprang into the air. It was Nandou Mu, another genius of the clan. He was at the Eighth-star Glory Plane and was extremely strong.Nandou Mu had heard of Ye Futian's records in Donghai Academy. He knew that the youth had defeated those over the Eighth-star Glory Plane. Therefore, he didn't underestimate Ye Futian. He released his life spirit\u2014a dazzling sword. With a sword as his life spirit, he was covered in horribly strong intent of the sword. He could slice through anything before him and nothing could stop him.Nandou Mu was a powerful swordsman in training. Sorcery was his supplement. When he grasped the sword, it seemed that he was the only one left in the world.He flashed, and countless afterimages appeared in the sky. It was as if he was everywhere. Ye Futian couldn't distinguish between them at all. The Lock of a Thousand Vines swept toward one direction.Nandou Mu's pupils constricted. The afterimages disappeared and his true body appeared. Was his enhanced agility ineffective before Ye Futian? He had been seen through so easily.Seeing the vines come at him, he pulled his sword out. There was only one sword, but there seemed to be countless ones in the air. There were various snicks and snaps; the vines were cut apart crazily.Nandou Mu's attacks and speed were both much faster than the first opponent. When the endless vines swept toward him, the sword life spirit seemed to hum. As if he was surrounded by a ring of sharp swords, the intent of the sword flew out and cut the vines.After that, the thousands of swords became one and seemed to become a truly sharp blade behind Nandou Mu. It shot out directly towards Ye Futian. In that instant, everything else melted away. The sword's radiance was enough to destroy everything.\"As expected of Nandou Mu.\" All members of the Nandou clan stared sharply at the battleground in the sky. Nandou Mu was one of the top younger members of the clan and he lived up to expectations. This sword would definitely defeat Ye Futian.Countless gazes fell on Ye Futian. He stood there without moving, watching the dazzling sword come at him.BOOM!Everyone saw a blinding fireball explode around Ye Futian. For that moment, his already-brilliant golden body was covered by flames. They burned his body, releasing a scalding fiery red glow like the sun.\"The fire element!\" When the crowd saw this, their pupils constricted. Then they saw Ye Futian reach out. There seemed to be a furnace in his hands that could melt everything in the world.\"It's the Tragic Melting Palm.\" Behind Ye Futian, something flashed through Yi Xiang's eyes. This was a battle technique from his practice room. It was a fire-element technique with extreme explosive force. The cultivation requirements were very strict. The basic requirement was cultivation of both martial arts and sorcery. One also needed enough fire element power. If only semi-cultivated, it was very weak but once one fully cultivated this technique, it was terrifying. It was also developmental and wasn't restricted to a certain plane.Yi Xiang didn't know Ye Futian had learned this technique. It was his first time seeing Ye Futian use it. Now, he was thinking how many secrets this guy really had. Perhaps he could see a glimpse today. He'd already guessed what Ye Futian wanted to do.Now, Ye Futian shone like the sun. His body had turned into a furnace too. When Nandou Mu approached him, he could feel the destructive force that wanted to burn his body to ashes.His sword life spirit screamed. The intent of the sword was shocking. With one strike, he could defeat thousands of spells. Now, it stabbed towards Ye Futian.Ye Futian reached out his hands. It was like a scary furnace had appeared. He grasped the sword directly. Under Nandou Mu's shocked stare, his sword melted bit by bit until it disappeared. A gust of shocking heat appeared. If Nandou Mu continued forward, his body would end up like his sword. How could flesh be compared to a sharp blade?As a skilled man, he was able to stop his charging body. He abandoned his sword and retreated but it was too late. Ye Futian's wings flashed and his body turned into lightning. Reaching out, he clasped his palms of fire on Nandou Mu's neck. Then his wings flapped and Ye Futian descended quickly. He raised his hand and slammed Nandou Mu to the ground while he shot into the sky again like a golden streak of lightning.The powerful figures of Nandou clan watched as Nandou Mu writhed on the ground. He was covered in burns and had been injured gravely. Someone covered with light took him away. More people stared up at Ye Futian with uncomfortable expressions.Ye Futian was so powerful that even someone like Nandou Mu was crushed, completely not at his level. If this was the case, the Nandou clan would have a hard time finding someone in the Eighth-star Glory Plane to fight with him one-on-one. It may work with a Nine-star Glory Plane genius.\"Where do you get your arrogance from as a fallen clan?\" Ye Futian said coldly as he advanced. The Nandou clan was so humiliated but they couldn't refute him.Seeing Ye Futian advance step by step toward the location of their banquet, a senior said, \"Take him down. I don't want to see him take another step.\"They hadn't expected Ye Futian would be so powerful. If he was allowed to reach the banquet, it would be a disgrace to the clan. Today, there were many big figures of Donghai City at the banquet, including Minister Hua. Hua Jieyu, a member of the clan, was now the Crown Princess. It was a moment of glory with no time for disturbances.Countless figures came out. Some shot to the sky. Others gathered their spells on the ground. The Spiritual Qi went crazy in the air. Since Ye Futian wanted to fight everyone under the Dharma Plane of the Nandou clan, they would satisfy him. After they take Ye Futian down, it would still be embarrassing but it was better than being defeated by him one by one.Ye Futian was now surrounded by powerful figures. However, he continued forward as if he didn't see anything. Countless spells were released at once, exploding with shocking might. Spells of various schools swept towards Ye Futian as one. In an instant, the youth was attacked by all these spells but he continued strolling in the air, seeming even more elegant.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 97": "Chapter 97: ShockTranslator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo StudioYe Futian floated arrogantly in the air. His body was illuminated by both a golden light and the light given off by the flames. Ye Futian shined bright like the sun.The attack spells continued to charge at Ye Futian, but every time they got close, they were destroyed by the flames. His body acted as a giant furnace. This was the frightening point of the Palm of Melting Sadness.In order to cultivate the Palm of Melting Sadness, one needed to cultivate both martial arts and sorcery. They must gather endless amounts of Fire Spiritual Qi to join with the Fire Spiritual Qi within themselves. This would cultivate the body in a fearsome burning furnace, ready to incinerate all in its way. And when the powers erupted, the flames would gather in the palm. If others were struck by the palm, they would be directly cremated into ashes. If Ye Futian hadn't gone easy on Nandou Mu, he would have been dead, ceasing to exist.When the members of the Nandou clan saw the attacks thrown at Ye Futian being destroyed, the expressions on their faces darkened. What type of battle technique was this? It was just too powerful. They knew ordinary spells were no use on Ye Futian. Whether it be martial arts cultivators or sorcerers, anyone within the eight-starred Glory Plane was a piece of cake to Ye Futian.More clan members gathered. They all knew of the insulting words Ye Futian said but all they could do was watch as other members fell victim to his wrath.Just then, a golden rod, formed by Spiritual Qi, appeared in Ye Futian's hand. The wings on his back fluttered and carried him off like a giant roc at an incredible speed.A sorcerer was casting a spell in the direction Ye Futian was headed in. Upon seeing Ye Futian, who was charging straight for him, the sorcerer turned away hurriedly. However, with the help of Wind Sorcery, the Roc Spirit, and his roc form, Ye Futian was unbelievably fast. His rod smashed down on the sorcerer's shoulder. A loud, crisp sound was heard. It sounded like the crushing of bones. Following that, the sorcerer's body began to fall from the skies, smashing harshly onto the ground.A giant thunder bird flew towards Ye Futian. The giant bird enveloped by the lightning was ready to attack Ye Futian. Ye Futian's golden rod danced in the air around him, nothing could get through to him. The rod then slipped past the curtain of lightning surrounding the giant thunder bird then destroyed it. In the next moment, Ye Futian descended on the sorcerer who had cast the spell and with one smash, this sorcerer ended like the last. He let out a loud scream and his body was thrown off to the side.Another three figures charged at Ye Futian simultaneously. Their bodies were surrounded by Wind Sorcery. They used the power of the wind to get close to Ye Futian and barricade him between the three of them. Then, the three cultivators all released their powers to attack Ye Futian at the same time. There was a sharp halberd aimed for his heart. There was a storm of punches of beast-like strength. Every punch thrown was accompanied by a beastly growl, like that of a lion or tiger. There was also an attack of frost, ready to encapsulate everything in a thick layer of ice. The frightening ice storm moved towards Ye Futian as if it was prepared to bury him in ice.All three of these men were either just martial arts cultivators or cultivators of both martial arts and sorcery. Two of them were in the eight-starred Glory Plane and one in the seven-starred Glory Plane. This group of power cultivators ganged up against Ye Futian.The golden rod danced in the air while the aura around Ye Futian became stronger. The wings on his back carried him around. In the blink of an eye and without any hesitation, Ye Futian attacked with the rod quickly. BANG! BANG! BANG! Three bodies were struck by the rod and thrown back. The three cultivators spat up blood in mid-air. Ye Futian did not stop moving. The Golden Roc moved quickly and landed on the floor. Two more people screamed out in pain as the golden rod landed on their bodies.In a flash, Ye Futian charged at another person. Before Ye Futian could even get close, the person attempted to make a run for it but with a single swipe of the rod, his body was thrown into the air. Following this, the body surrounded by golden light continued to attack. Inside the Nandou Palace, people were being thrown left and right or were smashed into the ground. The whole palace was filled with blood-curdling screams. Countless members of the clan had fallen. It was complete chaos.A strange sight was happening at the Nandou Palace. A six-starred Glory Plane cultivator was walking through the palace and following on both sides of this young man were powerful cultivators in higher planes. However, they could only follow. No one dared to fight him. Even sorcerers were reluctant to cast attack spells on him from afar because people had tried to do so earlier and were all defeated by the golden rod.Ye Futian continued to advance as members of the Nandou clan followed beside him. The looks on their faces were serious but also filled with embarrassment. They finally knew just how scary Ye Futian was.The elders of the clan had darkened expressions. They couldn't believe that they were going to allow Ye Futian to continue into the palace. No one was able to stop him.One of the elders tried to make a move for Ye Futian but stopped when Yi Xiang spoke up from behind Ye Futian. He said, \"The Nandou clan used to be royalty, you guys should stop now and save your pride.\" It would be truly humiliating if an elder made a move in this situation. Ye Futian had only challenged members of the clan within the Dharma Plane.More of the younger clan members had gathered after hearing about the news. Many of them were outstanding cultivators but they were all shocked by the scene in front of them. Ye Futian had challenged everyone within the Dharma Plane but defeated everyone with such ease. This was too humiliating. Furthermore, if they did not stop him now, Ye Futian would soon make his way to the party venue.Just then, a figure blocked Ye Futian's path. He was strong and powerful, a nine-starred Glory Plane cultivator. \"Stop right there,\" he said. Immediately after he had spoken, Ye Futian charged forward. He did not want to waste his breath on this guy.Unfaltering, the cultivator let out a scream. Spiritual Qi collected for a spell. A golden rounded gear spun quickly, cutting into the air, headed towards Ye Futian. The sharp gear was able to attack from all directions. It was able to block the light of the sun with its large size. If struck with the gear, the body would definitely be cut up into pieces.BOOM! Ye Futian put one foot forward, his power building up from within. He swung the golden rod down once, and the large gear in his way was destroyed. Ye Futian charged toward his opponent at the speed of light only to see that he had formed an even bigger gear with Spiritual Qi. An ear-splitting sound rang out as the gear spun. It was as if the gear could cut through thin air.Seeing that Ye Futian was racing toward himself at full speed, the cultivator sent the giant gear spinning towards Ye Futian with a wave of his hand.BOOM! Another swing. The golden rod struck down on the gear, splitting it apart just as it had to the last. Ye Futian continued to advance. The nine-starred Glory Plane had a completely different expression on his face now. He opened his mouth, wanting to say something as he looked at Ye Futian. However, Ye Futian had no time to waste on him. He swung the rod and threw the cultivator to the side. It was as easy as stepping on an ant. A nine-starred Glory Plane cultivator was no different from the rest. One swing from the golden rod and they were all defeated.Many members of the Nandou clan were shaking in their shoes. The nine-starred Glory Plane cultivator who was just defeated was a rather well-known member of the Nandou clan but even he was unable to stop Ye Futian.Ye Futian sped up, his golden wings spread out to carry him away.\"Stop him!\" someone screamed in rage. However, Ye Futian was no longer going to stay and fight. As he advanced, the golden rod never stopped moving. People were sent flying all along the way.Finally, the party venue could be seen just up ahead. Many partygoers shifted their attention to Ye Futian. Nandou Tai and a group of the most powerful cultivators of the Nandou clan did not know what to do. However, the guests seemed excited to see Ye Futian. He truly was powerful. During Donghai Academy's Assembly of the Seven Schools, everyone was left with a deep impression of Ye Futian. They were so taken with that one piece he played, The World. Now, he has broken into the Nandou Palace, destroying all that got in his way, just like a young war god.Such a pity, many of the guests thought to themselves. This brilliant young man was going to end up dead because he chose to break into the Nandou Palace and defy the imperial order.Minister Hua held his wine glass and murderous look filled his eyes. It seemed like someone was seeking death but this was all within his expectations.At this time, two people appeared amongst the group of Nandou clan members. It was Hua Jieyu and Nandou Wenyin. Hua Jieyu's eyes were trained on the young man headed her way. Tears rolled down her face, her heart in pain.Ye Futian floated in the air in front of the main stage of the venue. He looked towards the person seated up in the main seat and then turned to look at Hua Jieyu. The iciness in his eyes melted again and he smiled. \"Fox, I'm here.\"\"Dummy,\" said Hua Jieyu as she cried. Minister Hua had come all this way with the imperial order from the emperor. It was obviously ill-intended. If they tried to defy the order, Minister Hua would definitely not hesitate to kill the both of them.\"Restrain him,\" ordered Nandou Tai. Many of the most capable younger clan members rushed out and headed for Ye Futian. Then, the regular young clan members also followed suit. They did not look impressed. How could the others allow Ye Futian to make his way all the way here to the venue?BOOM! There was an explosion of Spiritual Qi in the vicinity. The humiliated members of the Nandou clan all released their powers, flooding the venue with an overwhelming storm of Spiritual Qi. Right now, all cultivators in the Dharma Plane and below were prepared to gang up on Ye Futian. They were fully enraged now.Noises sounded as a Wood Elemental spell was cast on Ye Futian, the Lock of a Thousand Vines. Vines came from all directions while other attacks from different elemental sorcery rushed toward Ye Futian as well.BOOM! A flash of lightning hit Ye Futian. In an instant, his body was bathed in the bright light. Meanwhile, his surrounding turned dark and stormy.\"Thunder Raid,\" said Ye Futian. The world around him was full of lightning and thunder. Then, Thunder Sorcery descended from the sky, striking the crowd down below.\"The element of Thunder.\" Everyone was shocked as they watched Ye Futian intently.WHOOSH! Ye Futian was now covered in flames. Fire dragons appeared and revolved around Ye Futian. Next, they all roared loudly and came rushing down.\"The elemental of Fire.\" This was another surprise for onlookers.\"Winding of a Thousand Silk Strains.\" Metal Sorcery was released formed into unless strains of golden silk strains, cutting through the air.\"Weight of Earth,\" Ye Futian spoke once again. The area began to fill with Earth Spiritual Qi. A heavy force pushed down on everyone. This type of gravity spell was too scary. It restrained everyone's movements.Those high-level officials were frozen with the wine glasses still in their hands as they stared at Ye Futian.He was a Full Attribute Sorcerer!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 98": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Legend of FutianCH 98Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe people at the banquet were all the big figures of Donghai City but they were unsettled by a youth. Countless days ago, they had gone to watch the Assembly of the Seven Schools, attended by the Crown Prince and Minister Hua. Ye Futian, the disciple of the Qin Devil, had cleared the name of his master. He had dedicated the song Hero to his master and used The World to display his emperor's intent. The students from the School of the Emperor Star who stepped onto the battleground all knelt down to him. He was so brilliant that the Crown Prince wanted to make him minister, but Ye Futian refused.Countless days later, a decree had fallen upon Donghai City, cutting off the youth's future. They all understood the meaning behind this. There seemed to be only one path waiting for the youth who refused to obey. Even if he agreed to go to the Imperial City, the ending would still be the same.Today, Ye Futian forced his way into the Nandou clan. He shone brightly, brighter than he had in Donghai Academy. Right now, Spiritual Qi of various elements wrapped around him. Spells of different schools exploded, instantly defeating countless younger members of the Nandou clan.He was also a Musical Sorcerer with the elemental talent he revealed now. He was clearly a one-in-a-century Full Attribute Sorcerer.Minister Hua narrowed his eyes, his murderous intent intensifying. It seemed that the Crown Prince's guess was logical. Minister Zuo had seen something early on, which meant that he must kill Ye Futian today to remove the threat.Nandou Tai's shuddered inwardly too. Ye Futian's talent was the same as Hua Jieyu. In fact, Jieyu's talent relied more on Spirit Elemental to guide the other elements but Ye Futian was different. His full attribute nature was balanced and powerful. The various elemental spells he cast were the best evidence. The power of each spell was way above what was typical of his plane. This meant his elemental strength was very strong and this applied to every element.The strong of Donghai Academy shuddered too. Han Mo and Zhuo Qing all stared at Ye Futian. It seemed that they still didn't witness Ye Futian's full power at the earlier battle. Was this all of his talent now? Even Zhuo Qing was a bit jealous.Yi Xiang still stood quietly behind Ye Futian. His heart trembled too. Was this really Ye Futian? The shameless and playful guy had hidden such world-shaking talent. He should've risen to the top but now he was stuck in the shallow water, struggling in Donghai City. An order from the king forced him into a state of despair.Hua Jieyu kept looking at Ye Futian. Her teary eyes were unblinking and her gaze grew more and more resolute. She took a step, wanting to go to Ye Futian, but Nandou Ku stopped her. \"Miss,\" he said, \"don't make it hard for me.\"Hua Jieyu looked coldly at the figure. She no longer had any feelings for this family the moment the Nandou clan accepted the decree. She looked away from Nandou Ku to Ye Futian. Her eyes were so gentle. If they were not fated to be together in this life, they would go to the afterlife together.At this moment, Ye Futian was in the eye of the storm. As he cast his spells, those with weak cultivation could not withstand the wildness. Many were hit and it was chaos.Ye Futian raised the golden staff again. He twirled it in the air and a tremendous power descended, seeming to break apart the sky. When attacks came, afterimages of the staff appeared all around him. It blocked all attacks outside.Finally, he moved, rushing at a Nine-star Glory Plane sorcerer. He moved and performed the first of the Nine Heavenly Attacks\u2014Genesis. It swept everything down. The spells coming at him were destroyed directly. The sorcerer was shocked and then he was swept by the staff, crashing into the others.Ye Futian didn't stop at all. His wings flapped and he appeared elsewhere. The Winding of a Thousand Silk Strains and the Lock of a Thousand Vines unfurled. Next was the second of the Nine Heavenly Attacks. It swept everything before him. Countless bodies were sent flying in all directions. The Nandou clan watched all this, their insides clenching. The younger generation of their family was defeated so easily by Ye Futian.Were they really that weak? Ye Futian had been this wild at the Donghai Academy but at that time, he didn't release the terrifying talent like today. Of course, some powerful Nine-star Glory Plane figures continued to pursue Ye Futian. Many spells broke through the attacks and defenses, falling upon Ye Futian. He shook as well, but it seemed as if he was invincible and kept fighting crazily.\"Zhuo Qing, go,\" Yan Shao, headmaster of the School of the Emperor Star, said. Zhuo Qing's eyes flashed. He nodded and rose, heading toward the battlefield. He'd wanted to teach Ye Futian a lesson and was once confident he could defeat the youth. But now, Ye Futian had become so strong. He wasn't that confident anymore. Now, Ye Futian's abilities were too shocking.Zhuo Qing stepped toward the battleground. Seeming to notice him, Ye Futian's wildly fighting body suddenly stopped. Defeated figures were scattered on the ground around him. He welcomed Zhuo Qing with a cold gaze. Hoisting his staff, he walked toward the other. At that moment, a shocking aura appeared around Zhuo Qing. His eyes became demonic and a spiritual wave pierced into Ye Futian's eyes. Ye Futian felt like he was taken over by a demon. His steps faltered as if it was hard to continue. His hand even twitched involuntarily. It was like Zhuo Qing was about to control his body. His ability was very strange.\"You guys go,\" Zhuo Qing said. Countless men at the pinnacle of the Glory Plane acted at once, attacking Ye Futian.At the same time, Ye Futian radiated with similarly powerful spiritual strength. He stepped forward and his power intensified again. He twirled his golden staff and it flew out, spinning around him. It defeated the spells coming at him and stopped the incoming enemies. However, the golden staff also extinguished.Zhuo Qing continued forward. His power intensified again, his spiritual power becoming more terrifying.\"Earlier, I performed The World at the School of the Emperor Star. Today, I will perform it again for the Nandou clan,\" Ye Futian said nonchalantly. As he finished speaking, a dazzling light appeared behind him. Countless music notes danced in the air. The shadow of a guqin appeared behind him.\"His life spirit!\" Everyone's heart trembled. They saw how beautiful the Golden Roc was behind Ye Futian. The guqin life spirit hovered above him.Crack! Nandou Tai's hand clenched and broke the cup in his hand. He was clearly shaken. He had two life spirits! He was a Full Attribute genius with twin spirits.Luo Junlin, Crown Prince of Nandou Kingdom, was known to be born to become king. His talent was twin spirits but he didn't have the full attribute. Now, Ye Futian showed that he had this talent and no one could beat him in the Nandou Kingdom.The gazes of the big figures were fixated on him. Their insides twisted and they felt numb. It was shocking that there was someone as accomplished as him in Donghai City.The people of Donghai Academy were even more shaken. They stared at Ye Futian; this person had once cultivated in the academy but sadly, he chose the School of the Finance Star.Nandou Wenshan stood with his sister Nandou Wenyin, behind Hua Jieyu. Seeing Ye Futian like this, he suddenly remembered how Ye Futian once said, \"She's the empress and I'm the emperor. Will this be true?\"Nandou Wenyin watched the boy's extreme talent with teary eyes. This scene was so similar to Hua Fengliu's struggle years ago. Today, it was the man Jieyu loved and he was so much more impressive than his master. He was fighting against the ruler of the Nandou Kingdom as if fighting against destiny.Ye Futian ignored the shaken people. He sat down with crossed legs. His guqin life spirit floated before him. It seemed intangible but when he strummed the strings, music was produced. That moment, it felt like he was at the peak of his life. He was alone, above the world like an emperor. The civilians could not meet his eyes; they could only bow down to him.This time, Ye Futian's performance was even wilder than at Donghai Academy. His shocking spiritual storm enveloped him under the support of his life spirit, shattering Zhuo Qing's attack.Zhuo Qing was livid. His spiritual strength was unable to pass through the storm. Even more terrifying, Ye Futian's music kept streaming into his ears. The spiritual storm was spreading too. As if the emperor's intent had descended, it wanted to plant the emperor's mark in his mind to make him submit to Ye Futian.The strong men around Ye Futian all saw many scenes in their minds. When they looked at Ye Futian, they no longer saw an ordinary boy. Instead, he was a young emperor. He sat there, waiting for them to bow down.\"The emperor's intent.\" Everyone focused on Ye Futian because the emperor's intent had appeared in Ye Futian again. He wanted the whole world under him.Last time at Donghai Academy, he had played The World for the Crown Prince. Today, he was playing for himself. Who was the emperor? Who ruled the world? The weaker ones of the Nandou clan really prostrated themselves. They were influenced by the music and couldn't fight back. The stronger ones retreated, fleeing the battleground. Zhuo Qing's face darkened and retreated as well. Only the youth remained in the area, unmatched.Minister Hua set his wine glass down. The will to kill burned in his eyes. This boy must be killed.The music stopped gradually. Ye Futian raised his head and looked in the direction of Nandou Tai. \"You know Hua Jieyu's fate,\" he said. \"Then what is my fate?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 99": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Legend of FutianCH 99Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayNandou Tai's heart pounded loudly at Ye Futian's question. If Hua Jieyu was fated to be empress, then what was Ye Futian fated to be? He had twin spirits and was a Full Attribute Sorcerer. His power in both martial arts and sorcery were also invincible. Don't even mention same plane cultivators. As a six-starred Glory Plane cultivator, Ye Futian was even able to defeat those in the Dharma Plane. There was probably no one else in all of Nandou Nation that would be able to do what Ye Futian could.Minister Zuo had looked into Ye Futian's fortune, so what was his fate?Nandou Tai had previously questioned why Minister Zuo would give Ye Futian the Decree of the Minister but after the shocking scene he witnessed today, Nandou Tai knew there was a meaningful story behind this.\"If you're willing to believe me, I am willing to let go of the past. When the day comes that I take over the throne, the Nandou clan will regain its glory and be granted royal authority once again,\" said Ye Futian. After hearing his speech, Minister Zuo jumped up from his seat. His murderous intent stronger than ever before.Ye Futian talked about the day he would take over the throne. His words were arrogant and an act of treason. Not only did he want to defy the imperial order, Ye Futian also planned on overthrowing the royal family.The citizens of the City of Donghai were dumbfounded. The 17-year-old young man had said such a preposterous thing. However, with the gifts he demonstrated, what he said was definitely possible. That is if he wasn't killed before that day came.Ye Futian revealed his gifts, his identity as a Full Attribute Sorcerer, his twin spirits, and his determination to be emperor through his piece, The World, all to prove a point to Nandou Tai.Ye Futian knew that as he was now, he had no power to go against the will of the emperor. He could only accept what fate had in store for him. He also knew that once he arrived at the Imperial City, only death awaited him. He could not accept this and decided to fight against it to the best of his abilities. The result of that was everything that had happened today. All he wanted was for Nandou Tai to see him, for the clan to see him.When Ye Futian had spoken, Yi Xiang was standing next to him. He knew that what Ye Futian said was no longer a simple defiance of the will of the emperor. There was no way that Minister Hua would let him go. Ye Futian's words caused Nandou Tai to waver. It was hard to imagine that the man who controlled the whole Nandou clan would be rendered speechless twice by a single young man.\"The Nandou family has already fallen, and the younger generation is only mediocre. The clan gets by solely on the title of 'used-to-be royals' and are overjoyed because of a marriage ordered by the emperor. If people didn't know, they would have thought that you guys were so happy because you regained royal authority. In reality, the clan is weak like ants. How do you plan on regaining your glory? By relying on Jieyu? Even if she did as you said, don't you think she'll hate the clan for it?\" asked Ye Futian when he saw Nandou Tai wavering. Nandou Tai couldn't help but turn his attention to Hua Jieyu. Hua Jieyu looked cold and aloof. Naturally, Nandou Tai knew that everything Ye Futian had said was true. But he also knew that if he acknowledged Ye Futian's words, it would only mean one thing: treason.Ever since the Nandou family clan stepped down from the throne, they had always acted with caution. They were afraid to do anything that may cause suspicion from the new royal family. They did not want to be wiped from history by the Luo family. When they received the news that Hua Jieyu was bestowed the title of Crown Princess, the clan saw a glimmer of hope. The clan would no longer need to live walking on eggshells. If they were to commit treason for Ye Futian, they would need to be one hundred percent sure of their decision. Even though it was possible for them to regain royal power through Ye Futian, if anything were to go wrong along the way, their entire clan would be doomed.\"I don't know about your fate, neither do I want to know. Minister Zuo bestowed you with the Decree of the Minister and so the emperor put trust in you and gave you the honor of becoming the Crown Prince's subordinate but you are being ungrateful. You are publicly defying the imperial order and even have these treacherous thoughts. If so, then your life should come to an end today,\" said Minister Hua. He was ready to rid the world of Ye Futian. This was Ye Futian's death sentence.Minister Hua turned his attention to Nandou Tai and said, \"Brother Nandou, don't waste any more time on him. Since this is your palace, your jurisdiction, you should be in charge of ending his life. His Majesty will be able to see your resolution from your actions.\"It was obvious that Minister Hua also had no idea of Ye Futian's gifts. His purpose of telling Nandou Tai to let Ye Futian in was to see him defy the imperial order. This way, there was no need to bring him back to the Imperial City, they could kill him on the spot. Even though his fate would be the same even in the Imperial City, Minister Zuo was there. So, it was because to get things taken care of here to prevent any change in plans.But today, Ye Futian has actually swayed Nandou Tai. From this point, it was easy to tell just how gifted Ye Futian was. Nandou Tai had probably already guessed the fortune that Minister told for Ye Futian. He was fated to do extraordinary things.Nandou Tai saw Minister Hua staring and knew that he was forcing him to make a decision. The Nandou clan was rooted in the City of Donghai and was deeply-rooted in society, but this time, Minister Hua had brought his people with him. The Emperor Star school officials who now controlled all of Donghai Academy were also here. Plus, Xia Feng and his people were waiting outside the palace as well. Even if they really wanted to revolt, their chances at victory weren't big. Many people of the Nandou clan would have to die for the cause and they might have to be on the run from the royal family in the future. Was all of this worth it for the words of one teenager? Even if Nandou Tai agreed to revolt with Ye Futian, what would happen if Ye Futian got killed in the end anyway?\"\"Uncle, with Futian and Jieyu's gifts, we definitely have a lot to look forward to in the future. All we have to do is ensure their safe escape from the Nandou Nation today. Or else, even if we send Jieyu into the Imperial Palace, she'll continue to hate the clan and we will never regain our glory,\" said a voice in Nandou Tai's head. It was Nandou Wenshan using Spiritual Energy to communicate with him. This way, no one could listen in on their conversation.The people of Emperor Star school put down their wine glasses, seemingly preparing for battle. If Nandou Tai really decided to revolt, then they would kill Ye Futian and Hua Jieyu first. Getting rid of these two would spare future troubles. If Nandou decided not to revolt, then things would be much easier. They wouldn't even have to make a move.\"Brother Nandou, are you wavering?\" asked Minister Hua in a cold demeanor. He was putting pressure on Nandou Tai. Nandou Tai observed Minister Hua and his people. He knew that if he had any strange actions, those people who attack immediately.\"Ye Futian has gone against the will of the emperor and deserves to die,\" Nandou Tai said, looking resolute. \"Kill him.\"Finally, Nandou Tai has made his decision. He could not afford to place the entire Nandou clan on the line for Ye Futian.Nandou Tai knew that after he gave this order, he was going to lose a lot, but he has already run out of choices. Minister Hua was pressuring him. The only other option was to revolt. Ye Futian has demonstrated just how powerful he was today, so killing him would be sparing future troubles. Nandou Tai had to make this choice even if Hua Jieyu was going to hate him for it.All of this was Ye Futian's fault. If he knew what was good for him, then he shouldn't have come today. Then, Nandou Tai wouldn't have to be the one to order his death. That responsibility would have fallen on Minister Hua.Everyone present let out a sigh for Ye Futian. In the end, he had lost. Nandou Tai had decided to kill Ye Futian and not bet the future of the Nandou clan on him.Hua Jieyu, Nandou Wenyin, and Nandou Wenshan gave a look of disappointment. They were very disappointed. Hatred filled Hua Jieyu's beautiful eyes.However, Ye Futian let out a sudden laugh while looking at Nandou Tai. He had really failed in the end. He couldn't get Nandou Tai on his side.\"You idiot. Are you happy now that you've lost?\" Yi Xiang reprimanded Ye Futian in a lower voice.\"The planning lies with the man and the outcome with the Heavens. How would I know if I don't try,\" said Ye Futian. He was very calm. To Yi Xiang he said, \"If you already know that I'm an idiot, why aren't you leaving?\"\"Maybe I'm also an idiot,\" answered Yi Xiang. He stepped up to stand in front of Ye Futian.Ye Futian looked at Yi Xiang's back and felt a warm feeling in his heart.Just then, a group of powerful cultivators from the Nandou clan stepped up, all giving off a murderous aura. This time around, it wasn't only younger members of the Dharma Plane.\"Do you want to revolt as well?\" Minister Hua eyed Yi Xiang with a murderous look.Just as Yi Xiang was about to speak, Ye Futian stepped out in front of him. Ye Futian pulled on his arm and said, \"It's enough that you stayed with me until now. I will take care of my own business. I don't need you butting in. I want you to leave.\"\"Since you guys are already here, then you should all stay,\" said Minister Hua. \"Brother Nandou, I'll leave them both to you.\"Nandou Tai nodded and stepped up personally. A forceful aura was released as he charged toward Yi Xiang and Ye Futian.BOOM! Every step Nandou Tai took shook the ground beneath. To be able to control the entire Nandou clan, one could only imagine just how powerful he was. A single step was sufficient to scare people away.\"Looks like you'll have to wish yourself the best of luck,\" said Yi Xiang. Then, he raced forward. His entire body exuded a wild force of power.Nandou Tai came at Yi Xiang with his palm. From his palm, radiated a large golden handprint, prepared to crush everything.Yi Xiang sped up and held out his fist. His fist landed on the large golden handprint and a large gust of wind washed over the entire venue. All the tables were flipped while the plates and cups crashed onto the ground. A storm started in between the two.\"Headmaster Yi Xiang of the School of the Finance Star is actually able to go against Nandou Tai?\" Many people were surprised. However, the ending was probably going to be just as they expected.In front of Ye Futian, the group of cultivators came closer. He glanced over at Yi Xiang. He knew that even though Yi Xiang could manage to battle with Nandou Tai, Yi Xiang was probably going to lose in the end.Ye Futian lifted his head to look at the sky. Still looking up, he said, \"I know you hoped that I could take care of everything by myself. I've tried my best, but I'm afraid I've let you down.\"Ye Futian knew that his godfather was watching over him. The conversation from last night, 'So what if he's the emperor, of course, you have to take her back', as well as the elder's tone. It brought him back to the Ye family house back in the City of Qingzhou. His godfather had spoken to him just like that before. Ye Futian's senses were very sensitive. There was no mistake, Grandpa Yu was his godfather. Since his godfather told him to come, then he was definitely watching from somewhere.But Ye Futian understood that his godfather could not reveal himself just yet. Senior Snow Ape was a great example. Since Ye Futian was related to Emperor Ye Qing somehow, then his godfather must be linked to him as well. He could not casually expose himself. Therefore, Ye Futian had revealed all his powers in hopes of getting the Nandou clan on his side, so he would have someone to help him, but it was no use. They had chosen to kill him. But now, he didn't know what to do anymore. If his godfather did not appear now, then both Ye Futian and Yi Xiang would be in great danger!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Who was he talking to? Was someone secretly helping Ye Futian?Minister Hua frowned as well. He looked into the sky but there were no changes. The strong men before Ye Futian were confused as well. Was this guy scaring them? Did he think he could still live?Looking up, Ye Futian saw that nothing was happening but he still didn't doubt anything. He believed his gut feeling and judgment. Would his godfather not come out if he didn't die?Rustles sounded and vines snaked towards Ye Futian. It was the Lock of a Thousand Vines at the Dharma rank. It covered the sky and was much stronger than his own spell.Ye Futian's wings flashed, dodging like a streak of gold lightning. However, the terribly thick vines hurled at him. With a smack, he was hit and fell directly toward the ground. Not only was the opponent at the Dharma rank, he was also at an extremely high plane. How could Ye Futian fight against him?\"No\u2026\" Hua Jieyu cried. She and Nandou Wenyin, behind her, tried to go forward but were blocked by all the strong fighters.\"You'll regret this.\" Eyes filled with tears, Hua Jieyu glared at the Nandou clan resolutely.\"Jieyu, we don't want to do this either.\" The Nandou members sighed inwardly, thinking of how much of a b*stard Minister Hua was. He made them do the dirty work.Ye Futian climbed up but a demon charged at him. With a boom, he was forced down again. Even though his physical body was strong, he still spat out blood instantly.The rustles sounded again. The Lock of a Thousand Vines wrapped around Ye Futian, rolling him up. At the same time in another direction, a terrifying spiritual storm surrounded Hua Jieyu. Her long black hair flew in the wind and her clothes fluttered. Her Spiritual Qi was released and slowly solidified.Ye Futian was immobilized in the air. The dagger-like thorns were aimed at him. There seemed to be only one path waiting for him.\"Stop,\" a frigid voice said.\"Jieyu, no!\" someone cried. Many looked over and saw the same wood elemental Spiritual Qi gather into a wooden thorn. Controlling them, Hua Jieyu stabbed it into her heart. Blood stained her clothing instantly. The attendees of the banquet had already stood up. When they saw this, their hearts clenched. This beautiful girl was so resolute.The Nandou clan looked at Hua Jieyu, their insides twisting. She had just been made the Crown Princess and their clan had found a shred of their glory from yesteryear. If Hua Jieyu died, everything would fall apart.\"I will die.\" Hua Jieyu stared at the strong fighter who had captured Ye Futian. The dagger-like thorn moved in her body but she didn't seem to feel anything. She just let the blood stream out.The Nandou member was forced to set Ye Futian down. Now, Ye Futian was dazed. His heart twisted painfully as if the dagger was stabbed into his own heart.Hua Jieyu started walking toward Ye Futian, step by step. The Nandou clan tried to stop her but Hua Jieyu glared at them. \"Get out.\" Seeing the blade still buried in her heart, the Nandou clan trembled inwardly. No one stopped her.Ye Futian, also shaking, walked toward Hua Jieyu. The two lovers walked toward each other step by step as if no one could stop them.Hua Jieyu gazed at Ye Futian. Her eyes no longer had any sadness or pain. Now, they were brilliant as if she was at her most beautiful age, blooming with the most perfect smile. But seeing this beauty, Ye Futian only felt pain.\"Idiot, why did you do this?\" Ye Futian's trembling body walked to Hua Jieyu. He reached out and wiped away her tears.The dagger in her heart transformed into Spiritual Qi and disappeared. She gazed at Ye Futian and smiled. \"You're an idiot too.\" With that, she leaned against Ye Futian's body lightly. \"You still haven't hugged me like a bride,\" she said gently.Hearing her voice, tears pricked at Ye Futian's eyes. He murmured, \"I'll do it now like you're my bride.\" He lifted Hua Jieyu bridal-style. She smiled so brightly. \"If I really die, I want to die in your arms.\" Her voice was still gentle.\"Okay.\" Ye Futian nodded. Hua Jieyu smiled and closed her eyes. Embraced by him so quietly was soothing.Ye Futian looked at the serene beauty in his arms with extremely gentle eyes. Then, the moment he raised his head, his eyes turned red. \"Why?!\" he roared at the heavens. Everyone thought he was roaring at fate. Seeing the two figures, many felt it was tragic. They were only 17 and loved each other so much they would rather die than surrender to fate.Nandou Wenyin's tears rolled down without stop, like a kite with a broken string. Her heart hurt but she didn't disturb Ye Futian and Hua Jieyu. Nandou Wenshan was in pain too but he couldn't change anything. He was powerless and he had a family.Ye Futian looked at Nandou Tai and asked coldly, \"Are you satisfied?\"Nandou Tai was chilled. He had underestimated Ye Futian's determination, as well as Hua Jieyu's. However, not everything in the world could be predicted. If he could turn back time, he would make the same decision. As the leader of the Nandou clan, everything was done in the best interest of the clan. He didn't regret it but he was still sad. There was no more hope for a Crown Princess. Their most successful younger member would be lost forever.\"Since they want to die, just let them,\" Minister Hua said coldly. He saw Hua Jieyu's attitude and it was not only him. Everyone here had seen it. Despite being Crown Princess, she wanted to be with Ye Futian even in death. Therefore, there was no reason to bring her to the Imperial City.Nandou Tai gazed at Ye Futian and Hua Jieyu. Decisiveness flashed past his eyes. He knew that things could never be fixed from the moment Hua Jieyu stabbed herself.\"If I were you, I would object,\" Yi Xiang said coolly, retreating to Ye Futian's side. \"Even if Hua Jieyu becomes empress, do you think the Luo Royalty will allow the Nandou clan to rise? You see a chance for timely help but dream of returning to your past glory without any sacrifices. All you can do is dream. No wonder the Nandou clan is falling. Nandou Tai, you have no boldness at all.\"Ignoring him, Nandou Tai walked forward and ordered coldly, \"Kill.\"With that utterance, every member of the Nandou clan shook inwardly. This time, not only Ye Futian would be killed. It also included Hua Jieyu, the most talented woman of their clan. Their hope had been on her so their feelings now went without saying.At this time, there was a long cry in the sky. Everyone looked up and saw a beast had appeared. It was a crane, diving downward. An elder clad in white sat atop the crane. He was covered in white and extremely old. He sat peacefully on the crane until it landed in within the Nandou clan.Seeing the old man, Ye Futian was shocked. \"Grandmaster,\" he called out, \"why are you here?\"\"While in the School of the Emperor Star, I heard some sounds and was worried so I came to take a look. I didn't expect it to be like this. I came too late.\" Seeing how Ye Futian and Hua Jieyu were now, he was sad. Back in the day, his disciple Hua Fengliu had gone through something similar. Now, his two grand-disciples were the same.\"Grandmaster.\" Hua Jieyu opened her eyes. Seeing the elder, her eyes reddened. He was so old and yet had come personally because he was worried.\"Senior, long time no see,\" Minister Hua said, squinting at the elder.Elder Qin looked at him and sighed. \"Do you have to make such a big deal over two youngsters?\"\"Senior, this is the emperor's order,\" Minister Hua said. \"What is the meaning behind your arrival?\"\"To take them away, of course,\" Elder Qin said calmly.Minister Hua scoffed. \"Senior, you couldn't win against me before. Why do you think you can take them away today?\"Elder Qin, Minister Hua, and the headmaster of the School of the Emperor Star all had the same master. Elder Qin was the eldest but Minister Hua was the most talented. That was why he could become minister and be trusted by Emperor Luo.\"Yes, you are more talented than I but you are obsessed with power,\" Elder Qin said. \"Every gain comes with a loss. Since you pursue power, your cultivation will take a blow.\"\"Senior, would you like to try? At your age, you should be resting peacefully. I think it would be better if you don't try.\" Minister Hua stepped forward. Elder Qin didn't like to compete with others and Minister Hua didn't like that. Before, he had invited Elder Qin to come out of his hermit lifestyle but was rejected. If he had been willing to ally with Yan Shao, Donghai Academy would have long been controlled by the School of the Emperor Star. That was why Minister Hua never liked this senior, even though he had higher status and always stayed in the school. But if he still didn't know his place today, Minister Hua would kill him without any concern.\"Come,\" Elder Qin said. Ye Futian knew he was speaking to him. Holding Hua Jieyu, he jumped onto the crane.\"Wenyin.\" Elder Qin gazed at Nandou Wenyin. Her body flashed and she was on the crane as well, beside Ye Futian and Hua Jieyu. Glowing, Yi Xiang hovered in the sky beside the crane.Minister Hua waved his hand. Instantly, headmaster Yan Shao and vice headmaster Han Mo of the School of the Emperor Star all moved, surrounding the crane. Nandou Tai moved as well. Today, there was no way back. He couldn't let Ye Futian and the others leave alive.\"Futian,\" Elder Qin said slowly, sitting atop the crane, \"I will teach you one last song today.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
