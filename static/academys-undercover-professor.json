Happy reading!When most parents dream of their children\u2019s future jobs, they would recommend higher-level jobs such as doctors or judges since all jobs that end in the letter \u2018sa\u2019 are well-recognized. Or at least a civil servant called a stable iron rice bowl. No parent wants their children to go down a difficult and difficult path.However, in my case it was a little different.\u201cSon. You become a shaman.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dIt was the words my mother told me when my father passed away early and I was growing up together with my ferocious little sister.Although my family wasn\u2019t very lean or poor, I still wanted to earn money by studying hard and becoming a doctor, a scientist or a developer.However, what my mother recommended to me, who had meticulously crafted such a scientific route, was not a liberal arts route, nor even an artistic or physical education, but a path on a completely different level.What should I say about this Theology major?\u201cUh, what?\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t hear me well, so I\u2019ll say it again. You have to become a shaman.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t like it.\u201dMy answer was adamant.I\u2019m not going to be a shaman. Why all of a sudden in the first place?In response to my bold answer, my mother raised her eyebrows once, and spoke in a strong tone.\u201cYou have the qualities of a shaman. All kinds of spirits are watching over you. There is no other way for you than a shaman.\u201dHearing that, I was stunned. Do you have such talent? Beyond the absurdity, I just didn\u2019t think about it.From then on, my mother mostly said things that shouldn\u2019t be said to her son, such as that I have unique qualities, that I am destined to be harmed if I don\u2019t become a shaman and do not receive divine guidance.What did I reply back then?\u201cNever, I won\u2019t.\u201d\u201cYou will get hurt one day. They are all worried about you.\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s for me, you should support me on the way I go!\u201dI remember saying so firmly and locked up in my room.To be honest, it just made me sad and angry. You can\u2019t make a child who has properly designed his life since middle school to give up everything and become a shaman.At that point, I studied even harder with a sense of repulsion.My mother constantly bothered me and forced me to do religious things, and she taught me all kinds of bizarre knowledge such as poetry, magic, and witchcraft. But I didn\u2019t give up. The more I did it, the more I acquired all kinds of rational knowledge to make my head stronger.When more than 10 years passed like that, and as an adult, I finally settled down as a member of society but I died in a car accident.\u2018It was really absurd.\u2019Was this what my mother said about getting hurt? And what was even more surprising was what happened after that.\u2018I\u2019m alive.\u2019To be precise, I died once, but it would be correct to say that I was born anew.Does the afterlife exist? I thought everything my mother said was a lie, but it was all the truth. Through the experience of death, I felt deeply that human beings do not fully realize what they have not experienced until they experience it.What am I doing now?\u201cOpen the textbook. Continuing from last time, I will teach you how to draw a magic circle.\u201d\u201cI am a teacher at the Magic Academy.\u201d\u2026\u2026How did this happen?* * *A mechanical engineering locomotive emitting pure white steam arrived at the station. The sound of compressed steam spewing out as iron reverberated.The passengers waiting at the station got on the train one by one, and watching the scene, I took a deep breath before boarding the train. It felt like my body was becoming clearer as the fresh air seeped into my lungs.The sky was clear without clouds, and in the cold air of winter that was just coming to an end, I could even feel a pleasant refreshing feeling.The departure time of the train to the Exilion Empire was short.I raised my hand and lightly brushed my face. A strange sense of alienation felt between the gloved hand and the skin.\u2018The mask is firmly attached.\u2019I had to hide my identity, so it was unavoidable.I got on the train at a natural pace so as not to cause suspicion.\u201cI will check the ticket.\u201dAs I got on the train, the conductor spoke to me.I took the ticket out of the pocket of the frock coat I was wearing and handed it over.\u201cIt has been confirmed. Mr. Gerard. Have a nice trip.\u201dAfter receiving a courtesy greeting from the conductor, I responded with a light nod of my head.When I checked the ticket that was handed over to me, there was a number 403 written on it. In other words, it was the 3rd room of the 4th wagonThe hallway was narrow but long enough for only one person to walk through, and there were large gaps in the door on one side. The magic engineering train I was on was not called a luxury train for nothing, so all the seats in the long corridor were divided into rooms.401.402.403.\u2018Here it is.\u2019After checking the nameplate, I opened the door and entered. The moment I opened the door, I could smell the old wood.The inside wasn\u2019t that fancy, but it had everything. The soft seats are divided on the left and right and the storage space where luggage can be put. And even a signal bell installed so passengers can call the staff if they need anything.\u2018Not bad.\u2019I didn\u2019t have a heavy luggage bag, so I moved my body and sat down lightly. Even the seats were soft because it was a luxurious train.As I looked out the window, the vast landscape of the northern mountains caught my eye. The peaks of the soaring steep mountain range are covered with pure white snow, like giants wearing white cone hats. The train will soon pass through the crevices of that mountain range.\u2018Now that I\u2019m here, I can relax.\u2019My name is Gerard. I was once an ordinary member of society living in Korea. Of course, it was my previous life, and I died in a car accident.After that I woke up in the present world, a mysterious world where magic and science coexist, completely different from Earth. Here I was starting a new second life.\u2018I\u2019m on the train for the Empire, so I can rest until I get there.\u2019Exilion Empire, the largest and most powerful country on the continent. It is the birthplace of magic engineering, where magic and machinery coexisted equally, and where wizards and magic towers exist.I am heading to the empire now.\u2018Is the stop in the middle of a big city Leathervelk?\u2019I pulled out an informational pamphlet stuck next to my seat and checked the contents. The final destination of the Magical Engineering Train, which is currently scheduled to depart, is the capital of the empire. However, there is no way that there is a train going directly from the border of a country to the capital of another country.There are two stops along the way. Leathervelk is the first of them, and in some respects it can be seen as a more famous city than the capital. It is the place where the magic academy, the dream of all aspiring wizards, is located.\u2018A magic academy? What an amazing world.\u2019Decades have passed since I started living a second life, but there are still many things I can\u2019t adjust to. There must be a sense of separation from my previous life but the academy has nothing to do with me anyway. I don\u2019t need to worry about it.Rumble.While thinking that, the train vibrated slightly.\u2019Are you going to start slowly?\u2019Paaaang!!!As expected, the train honked its horn to signal its imminent departure. In as little as a minute, the train will run through the vast northern mountains.\u2018Am I going alone in this room? I hope it\u2019s comfortable.\u2019The moment I had such a futile thought, the door of room 403 creaked open as if it had been waiting.The one who came in was a well-dressed man in his mid-20s. He\u2019s tall and wears a brown frock coat similar to the one I\u2019m wearing. There is no way the train staff would wear such clothes, so it was obvious that he was a passenger in the same room as me. Even a tiger comes to me when I say it.As I was sighing inwardly, the other person looked at me and greeted me.\u201cHello.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe other side greeted me first, so I nodded my head slightly and accepted it. I didn\u2019t want to talk for a long time, so I responded as if I had a quiet personality.The man didn\u2019t care too much about my behavior and sat down on the seat opposite me.Paaaaaaaang\u2500\u2500\u2500!!!The train departed with a loud horn. At first, it was the locomotive that rattled and swayed, but as the speed started to increase, the shaking disappeared.It was not for nothing that the tickets were expensive. The common people could not even afford to pay such a high price, the speed and convenience were different from the general steam locomotive.The scenery outside the transparent window passed by quickly and the appearance of the pure white snowy mountain that covered everything was so beautiful that it automatically took your eyes off it. But after 10 minutes or 20 minutes, if you keep watching it, you\u2019ll get tired of it because it\u2019s monotonous.I took out the newspaper that was placed next to the pamphlet and unfolded it. Because there are no laptops or smartphones in this world, there is nothing other than books and newspapers that can kill time.[End of Civil War in the Utah Kingdom][It ends with the victory of the princess faction]On the front page of the newspaper, such an article was published in a wide open space.Not long ago, a civil war broke out and the Utah Kingdom was recruiting mercenaries from all over the world. It is also the country where the train station that this magic train departed from a while ago was located.Black and white photos were embedded between the articles printed in black letter font. It was a picture of the princess group announcing their victory in the war.\u201cThe civil war in the Utah Kingdom is over.\u201dA voice came through the newspaper. I pulled down the newspaper that covered my face and faced the man opposite. Since he spoke to me directly like this I couldn\u2019t ignore him.\u201cYes, it seemed to have ended unexpectedly, so I\u2019m glad.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been a while since the Prince\u2019s faction gathered forces from all over the world, but I\u2019m glad it ended early.\u201d\u201cStill, it is not without damage.\u201d\u201cIs that so? Ah. My introduction is late. I am Rudger Chelici.\u201d\u201cAre you an aristocrat?\u201dHowever, he does not show the arrogance or arrogance characteristic of aristocrats.\u201cI am Gerard.\u201dNo last name, this shows that I\u2019m a commoner.\u201cAh. It\u2019s okay you don\u2019t need to feel too uncomfortable because I am from the Fallen Nobility.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201dIf you\u2019re a fallen nobleman, it\u2019s understandable because they are nobles but not nobles.\u201cWhere are you going, Mr. Gerard?\u201d\u201cI am going to Lindebrugne, the capital of the empire. I have business to do there.\u201d\u201cIf someone like Mr. Gerard has a business, it must be a big deal, right?\u201dI laughed and shook my head at Mr. Rudger joke.\u201cIt\u2019s not a job, it\u2019s just a visit.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good too. I was just listening, but I heard that the Exilion Empire has a lot to see because of its advanced mage engineering.\u201d\u201cWhere are you going, Mr. Rudger?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to Leathervelk.\u201d\u201cLeathervelk is where the academy is. Do you have anything to see there?\u201d\u201cYes. Well, I\u2019m not proud of it, but I\u2019ve been appointed as a teacher at Theon Academy.\u201d\u201cHoo.\u201dI was purely amazed.The Empire\u2019s largest magic academy <Theon> it\u2019s the place where all the talents that exist on the continent gather and is a hotbed of the future where the gemstones that will carry this world are carved into jewels.Naturally, the students who gather there are made up of only the most talented children, and the teachers who teach them are strictly selected.The man in front of me was also said to be one of them.\u201cYou seem young, but you have great skills.\u201d\u201cNo. It\u2019s just that the public gave me a high rating. In fact, I narrowly passed the selection.\u201d\u201cI heard that there are a lot of people who fall, you should be proud of yourself.\u201d\u201cThank you for such a rating. Oh, more than that, it\u2019s because of the civil war in the Utah Kingdom, did you hear the rumor?\u201d\u201cWhat rumor?\u201d\u201cIt is said that there was a protagonist who made this civil war lead to the victory of the princess faction.\u201d\u201cHmm. You are the protagonist.\u201d\u201cBut surprisingly, he said that he was a wandering mercenary, not a high-ranking wizard or a high-ranking knight.\u201dA wandering mercenary who made a significant contribution to ending a nation\u2019s civil war. It hasn\u2019t been revealed in the newspaper yet, but word of mouth was spreading among people.\u201cMercenary Machiavelli. He said that was his name.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dI answered him in a slightly sarcastic tone.\u201cAren\u2019t you very surprised?\u201d\u201cHaha. I thought it was just a rumor.\u201dI said I didn\u2019t know, but it\u2019s actually a lie.The name of the mercenary Machiavelli is familiar to me because it was the identity that I was using before I became Gerard.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 2": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Academy\u2019s Undercover ProfessorCH 2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayC2: To the Capital of the Empire (2)But why did the man in front of me ask about the existence of Machiavelli? Is he doing it on purpose?\u2018What do you mean?\u2019For a moment, I wondered if he was a pursuer sent by the Princess faction of the Utah Kingdom, but it doesn\u2019t seem like that.Except for asking, Rudger took no action. Rather, his eyes and actions were closer to those of pure curiosity. So, is it just a coincidence?\u2018You are a Theon\u2019s teacher\u2026.\u2019Theon Academy is so famous that word-of-mouth spreads among people even when they are staying in a faraway foreign country. The fact that such a young man became a teacher there means that he is a person with great talent.I didn\u2019t know for sure when I first saw him, but I knew that this person was a bit unusual but instead of raising my alert, I shook my head inwardly.\u2018Let\u2019s call it a coincidence for now.\u2019I naturally turned to the next page of the newspaper and accepted his words.\u201cIf such a person existed, it would have been in the newspaper.\u201d\u201cHaha, there are some things that are not easily revealed to the public.\u201d\u201cCan you say that to a person you met for the first time today?\u201d\u201cThere is nothing wrong with it, is there? And Gerard, it\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve seen you today, but I think we\u2019re on a good note.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m thankful that Theon\u2019s renowned teacher took such good care of an old man.\u201dPerhaps in the current situation he\u2019s trying to project the image of being kind to others but Rudger didn\u2019t seem to want to turn off the interest he had in me.Since this has happened, I have decided to respond appropriately. Still, having a companion isn\u2019t a bad thing.\u201cMr. Rudger, if you go to Theon, are you going to teach right away?\u201d\u201cNot right away, I will have to wait.\u201d\u201cFirst year?\u201d\u201cNo, I will be in charge of the second year.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t new teachers usually teach first-year freshmen? You are more impressive than I thought.\u201dI heard that Theon is similar to universities on Earth even though it\u2019s a magic academy.All kinds of buildings were built on a huge site, and there were only thousands living and working there. Although it is adjacent to a large city, Theon itself is literally close to a small city, so the saying goes that it is a city next to the city.Theon students are divided from 1st to 5th grade. Usually, the higher the grade, the smarter the children, so it would be basic to have a competent teacher in the upper grades and new teachers for the first graders.\u2018It\u2019s not like he became a Theon\u2019s teacher for nothing.\u2019Although this world achieved the industrial revolution of iron and steam, if there is one thing that sets it apart from the Earth, it must be the presence of magic.\u2018I\u2019ve only seen it in fantasy novels.\u2019The existence of magic was inseparable from this world, and of course, of course, such magic has always been reserved for a select few.But unlike in the past where only aristocrats of noble bloodlines could learn magic, these days, there is a growing trend towards the supremacy of skill, in which commoners can learn magic if they have talent.Theon is the number one magic academy that anyone can enter if they have that skill.\u2018I\u2019m curious about what kind of place it is.\u2019When it comes to the magic academy, I have no choice but to think of a famous book from Earth. Students fly on broomsticks and use magic wands\u2026\u2026Perhaps the children who had been exposed to movies or books in childhood had dreams of such a magic school.In this world, academies where students can learn magic and enjoy their youth actually exist.\u2018Youth\u2026\u2026is it.\u2019In my previous life, my father died early, so I didn\u2019t have time to enjoy such things because I studied frantically out of a sense of duty to support my family, and was compelled to succeed.The second life, the present life, was not much different from the previous life. No, on the contrary, it was even worse. There is a reason why I hide my identity as I do now.After living for 27 years in this world I was no longer a hot-blooded youth. The magic academy and stuff like that are just otherworldly stories. The same goes for the man named Rudger, who is closely related to it.The man who stands on the shining stage called Theon and me, who lives with a false identity and hides his identity, are very different. Still, since he became a teacher at Theon at a young age, I should congratulate him.\u2018Because he is a fallen aristocrat.\u2019This world is still a hierarchical society and the nobles are, of course, those who belong to the apex of such a class society.However, there are those who fell to the abyss after being in such a place. Either they revolted against the state, or they hated the people of higher rank, or they owed a lot of money. Anyway, there are nobles who fell to the abyss for various reasons.Considering that the fallen aristocrats are more despised by the same nobles than the commoners, the man named Rudger in front of me must have put in a lot of effort to become a teacher at Theon.As I was thinking I heard something strange from the outside.\u2018What?\u2019I threw my gaze out the window, and I couldn\u2019t help but feel a strange sense of anxiety. The atmosphere is strange, as if something was about to happen.\u201cWhat is it?\u201dRudger asked, as if puzzled by my reaction.I did not answer and focused my five senses\u2026Something is coming.\u201cNow\u2026\u2026.\u201dThat was the moment when Rudger was about to open his mouth.\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500!!!A huge explosion shook the train wildly. The cabin shook, and the train running on the railroad staggered sideways.I held onto the handle of the chair strongly to balance my body.\u201cWhat is this\u2026\u2026? Did the engine explode?\u201dRudger asked, but I shook my head in disbelief. The engine does not appear to have exploded because there\u2019s no way the entire train will shake from one exploding engine.\u2500\u2500\u2500!As if my anxious imagination was not wrong, a thumping sound was heard from the ceiling of the train, and something began to run busily. At the same time, a loud noise was heard from the vehicle in front.After hearing the sound of something breaking and people screaming I realized exactly what happened.\u201cIt\u2019s an attack.\u201d\u201cAn attack on this train?\u201d\u201cMost of the guests of the Magic Train are wealthy merchants and nobles. It must have been the robbers of the Northern Mountains who were aiming for them.\u201dMost of the guests on this expensive train are rich people. Naturally, there were many people who were aiming for their money and valuables, so robbers\u2019 targeting the trains was not something unusual.\u2018Even so, doing this at the border to the Empire.\u2019The ones who attacked now are also not regular robbers.\u2018The explosion that shook the train just before was not an ordinary power.\u2019I narrowed my eyes because there was a part that I could guess.\u2018Is it magic?\u2019There is a wizard among the raiders.If a wizard is involved, it will be easy to rob the train and escape quickly in the mountains.There\u2019s no way big organizations that possessed wizards who could produce this level of firepower and attacked the train on which there were nobles were regular robbers.Since it is a world where magic exists, there are people who do bad things with magic.\u201cMr. Rudger. I think we should hide for now.\u201dRudger nodded at my words and packed his luggage.Why are you trying to pack your bag in this situation? Looks like there\u2019s something important inside. I was not in a position to worry about anyone else, so I got up but Rudger who took the lead.\u201cI\u2019ll go in first just in case.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dFirst of all, it is because I am a commoner in my 40s who has only a lot of money and this guy who became an academy teacher in his mid-20s would fight better.Rudger took out a small wooden staff in his right hand and held it up. The two of us opened the door to the room and looked at the corridor of the 4th vehicle. It was empty, I think the passengers were waiting quietly in the safe rooms now.\u2018It\u2019s the wrong choice.\u2019The rooms are protected by magic, but the robbers who have attacked are not ordinary people. To sit still inside in such a situation it\u2019s like waiting to get caught.In this case, it is best to stay away from them as much as possible.\u2018Even so, those who entered Vehicle No. 3 haven\u2019t come here yet.\u2019I thought that they would immediately disperse and extort money from the guests but maybe they are aiming for the first vehicle in front.Car No. 1 is a first class seat for nobles.It was a special room that was so strictly protected, but in other words, it was the golden egg with the most money.\u2018I\u2019m happy if that\u2019s the case.\u2019As long as their eyes are drawn to the No. 1 car it\u2019s good for us. These magic engineering trains are equipped to send a rescue signal in case of an emergency, like an unexpected attack.Reinforcement troops will probably come rushing in sooner or later. I just have to hold on until then.At that moment, a man broke the window in the hallway, the snow he had not brushed from his shoulder flew down. Sensing our presence, he turned his head and stared at us, there was a lot of blood in those eyes.\u2018Did you take any medicine?\u2019His appearance, dripping with hatred and anger, seemed different from a robber. Waiting for the train in this cold, maybe he succumbed to evil?\u201cWhat\u2026\u201dBut before I could even reveal my doubts, he started yelling at us. At the same time, Rudger\u2019s magic was manifested.As if drawing a three dimensional picture in the air, the engraved formula soon sublimated into a single magic.\u2018Crazy!\u2019I thought a as blue lightning bolt formed, and then in a single flash of light pierced the intruder\u2019s chest.\u201cAww!\u201dThe robber, who was running towards this side, fell to the floor and trembled.I looked at Rudger and asked.\u201cYou killed him?\u201d\u201cNo, I just stunned him.\u201dRudger, who answered that, slowly approached the fallen robber with a cautious expression on his face while keeping his wand pointed at him.\u201cWait Mr. Rudger. It is dangerous.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m only going to do a light interrogation to find their purpose for attacking this train.\u201d\u201cNo\u2026\u2026.\u201dI tried to say more, but Rudger didn\u2019t listen and moved. He pushed the robber, who had fallen to the floor, with his feet.\u201cSay it. For what purpose did you raid this train?\u201d\u201cHehehe\u2026\u201d\u201cLaughing in a situation like this\u2026?\u201d\u201cEveryone, everyone, must die.\u201dIn the stuttering voice, there was a cold madness that made my skin tremble. The robber laughed as his body convulsed and bled from his nose. At the same time, the shirt he had tightly wrapped around was unraveled, revealing what was hidden inside.It was a huge bomb.\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dWhen Rudger saw it, his eyes widened and he activated his magic and the robber pressed the detonator he was holding in his hand.\u201cBoooom!\u201dA huge explosion swept the No. 4 vehicle.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Fortunately, there were no injuries because even the shattered shards couldn\u2019t penetrate the coat I was wearing.\u2018It was good to wear sturdy clothes.\u2019The hallways and vehicle walls that had been intact until a moment ago were completely blown away. The cold wind blew through the open cracks and scratched my face like a knife.\u201c\u2026\u2026I thought he was just an ordinary robber.\u201dDetonating a bomb wrapped around his body while being suppressed by magic, this is by no means the behavior of a train robber. He was more like a fanatic, with a mindset of dying together with the enemy.\u2018A remnant of the prince faction from the Utah kingdom? No, they\u2019re busy hiding now. These people belong to another organization.\u2019As I wiped my face with my hands in frustration, I sighed as I felt my skin sagging. For some reason, I felt the cold wind blowing straight into my face.\u201cIt was expensive, but it\u2019s a pity.\u201dI took off the mask I was wearing on my face. There was no point in keeping it on my face since it was broken. The face of a man in his 40s with wrinkles and a beard couldn\u2019t do his part anymore, so I threw it out of the train.\u2018By the way, where is that man?\u2019Rudger, who was appointed as a teacher at Theon Academy, was nowhere to be seen.Immediately after, I realized that when the explosion occurred, the man did not react and he was swept away. A wall was blown away and Rudger was gone without a trace.I leaned my head out slightly and looked down to see a distant cliff. A blizzard still raged below the cliff, and it was covered with foggy snow clouds.\u2018\u2026\u2026He must have died.\u2019If he had known in advance, he could have prepared for it with magic, but unexpected situations always happen. He is a pitiful man, dying on the day he became a teacher at Theon Academy.I silently prayed for Rudger\u2019s well-being.\u2018It\u2019s not the time for me to relax either.\u2019Knowing that these guys are not ordinary robbers, the risk has increased a few times. If all of them use bombs even this sturdy train, protected by magic, might derail.\u2018Maybe derailing the train might be their goal.\u2019Having made a decision, I headed back to the car. At that moment, the door of Car No. 5 opened and the conductor with a very nervous face appeared.\u201cWhat? Customer, are you okay? Gee, what is this..\u2026.\u201dHe was a little perplexed as he saw me standing alone in the hallway next to the wall that had been blown off and stuttered.I answered calmly.\u201cA robber attacked. He was armed with a dangerous bomb and I was almost swept away by the explosion.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d\u201cThey seem to be mainly targeting Vehicle No. 1, so I think it would be better for us to step back.\u201d\u201cMost passengers have been evacuated to the back of the train.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201dI approached the conductor with a relieved face and as soon as the distance was narrowed enough I stretched out my arm and grabbed the conductor by the collar.\u201cWhy, why do you do that?\u201d\u201cDid you think that such fake acting would work in front of me?\u201d\u201cYes, yes?\u201dThe conductor looked at me with a puzzled face. If it had been someone else, this would have erased their doubts, but not me.\u201cI thought something was strange. How can a magic train, which is equipped with magic crystals and protected by strong defensive magic, be infiltrated so easily? Besides we\u2019re going at high speed through the rugged Arete Mountains, how could those people know exactly when to attack?\u201d\u201cThat\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s virtually impossible without having someone on the inside of the train that could turn off the magic that should work.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dAt that moment, the conductor\u2019s face changed. He moved his hand and tried to get something out, but I knew he would and prepared for it.I thrust a sharp knife under his chin.\u201cStay still.\u201d\u201cUgh.\u201d\u201cYou act fast, that means you\u2019re no ordinary robber. Where do you guys come from?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cAre you going to keep your mouth shut? Well, that\u2019s good too.\u201dI wasn\u2019t even curious about it anyway.If my prediction is correct, something might have happened to the 5th vehicle that this guy passed over.\u201cMove!\u201dI held the knife in my right hand at the guy\u2019s neck but the bastard refused to move so twisted his arm a little until he obeyed.\u201cHow many comrades do you have on the train?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cAre you not going to tell me? Then I\u2019ll have to make you talk.\u201dAt that moment a sound was heard from Vehicle No. 5, which the conductor came from.It was a small sound that could not be heard from Vehicle No. 4, where the bulkhead was blown away and the cold gust of wind outside the train blew but my ears we\u2019re extremely alert and caught the sound properly.It\u2019s something I\u2019ve heard a lot of times, metal meets metal.Having reached that point, I threw the conductor forward and immediately fell flat on my seat.Tutatattattattattatta!Shortly afterward, a blast of bullets shot through the door and passed over my head.\u2500\u2500\u2500!The conductor that I pushed out became a beehive. Scattering the debris and powder I covered my head with my hands and looked out the door but the bullets showed no sign of stopping.\u2018Is it a submachine gun? They are very well prepared.\u2019If that\u2019s the case, I\u2019ll have to deal with this one as well.They thought that this was enough, so they stopped shooting.\u2018They shoot without mercy even though their comrade was there and didn\u2019t even let him send any signals.\u2019That means that if they don\u2019t hear from him after a certain time they\u2019ll open fire.\u2018The suicide bombers and now this, it\u2019s obvious these people are crazy.\u2019Why did this happen when I got on this train\u2026 I sighed and stood up.After wiping off the powder and dust from my body, I looked over the door. Soon after, the door was smashed, and three tall men rushed into the hallway.\u201cSomeone is still alive?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you say that anyone would die after that?\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just kill yourself so I don\u2019t have to hear you talking?\u201dI looked at them chattering amongst themselves and said with an annoyed voice.They exchanged glances and then began to approach me. The hallway was narrow enough for only one person to come, so I had to deal with only one person at a time but the other side it\u2019s plump and a lot taller than me. To be honest I didn\u2019t want to fight here because I\u2019m at a disadvantage.\u2018Even if I surrender now they won\u2019t accept it.\u2019Seeing them, it looks like they have no intention to keep me alive.\u201c\u2026\u2026There is one thing I want to ask you.\u201d\u201cWhat? You want to beg for your life now?\u201dNo way.\u201cWith what guts did you attack this train? Is it worth it to throw your lives away? Besides the rescue team will be here soon.\u201d\u201cDo you think your threat will work on us?\u201dThe guy who took the lead at my warning snorted and drew his sword.\u201cI\u2019ll kill you with a single strike.\u201dHe came towards me but I slowly retreated back. However, space was limited and I had to stop. If I go back anymore I\u2019ll fall from the train.\u201cYou have nowhere to go.\u201d\u201cRight.\u201dIf I jump out of the train here, I will be following Rudger\u2019s.\u201cI\u2019m busy, so I\u2019ll finish it as soon as possible!\u201dThe moment he spit those words out and tried to attack me I activated the magic I had prepared in advance.With the sound of the air exploding, the body of the guy who was about to slam his sword at me bounced back like a cannonball. The ones standing behind him didn\u2019t react in time so they we\u2019re thrown to the floor together.\u201cOuch. uh, what\u2026.\u201d\u201cWizard?!\u201dThey didn\u2019t show any signs of being greatly distressed, perhaps because they were quite strong. No, they were wearing something under their clothes. Is it like a protective suit?I released the magical energy I had accumulated and engraved the runes. The three-dimensional figure drawn in the air eventually turned into magic, and in an instant, it became a huge wind and lifted up the guys in the air. It was like an invisible hand was holding them.\u201cUh, huh?\u201d\u201cLet me go! Put me down!\u201d\u201cAs you wish.\u201dI used the wind to move them and threw them out of the train.\u201cSave me! Please!\u201dThey are the ones who attacked the train with the intention to kill everyone so I won\u2019t spare them. After throwing them out of the train their screams echoed and slowly moved away.After dealing with them I pulled out a string from my pocket, tidying up my slightly messy hair. I don\u2019t pay much attention to my appearance, so my hair is quite long, and if I don\u2019t tidy it up in time, it becomes quite cumbersome.\u201cIt\u2019s better now.\u201dI was thinking of running away now, but this time the door of the 3rd car opened and new guys appeared. When you deal with one, another one keeps coming out. There seems to be no end, that\u2019s why I wanted to leave quickly.\u201cWhat is this\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe guys who came over from Car No. 3 looked at the inside of Car No. 4, which was half-destroyed, and me standing alone, and their faces became cold.\u201cKill him!\u201dThe guy who seemed to be the captain gave the order. At the same time, the guys who were waiting pointed their rifles at me.Seeing that scene, I desperately wanted to let out a sigh. What can I do? If I\u2019ve come this far, I have to see the end.\u201cShoot!\u201dThe captain gives orders and his men pull the trigger but the bullets didn\u2019t go out.Clap! Clap!\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\u201cSecond, the gun is broken!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dWhile they were confused I prepared my next magic. However, there was one thing that I overlooked, there was a magician among them too.Paah!The magic I cast is canceled in the air.The wizard, who pointed his wand towards this side, looked at me with a wary gaze.\u201cHe is a wizard.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter he must die as well.\u201dWhat\u2019s wrong with this? You were trying to kill me from the beginning.I\u2019m sure these guys are terrorists, and whatever I say here won\u2019t work. I took the watch out of my pocket and checked the time. Less than 10 minutes had passed since the attack started.\u2018Time is\u2026\u2026still a little lacking.\u2019The scenery passing by outside is still cold and airy. I thought it was very beautiful when I looked through the window, but it became terrifying since a wall was destroyed.There was still time before the train left the Arete Mountains and it will be difficult for the reinforcements to come right away.\u2018I can\u2019t help it.\u2019Considering the location and the time, reinforcements will need at least 5 minutes to arrive.\u2018I have no choice but to persevere.\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They stared at the man left alone in car No. 4 with slightly nervous faces.A black frock coat with gold stitching over a neat suit that clings to the body, long black hair tied at the nape of the neck, those sharp eyes that felt colder than the cold wind blowing outside.His appearance and momentum were unusual. In fact, in his hands, their compatriots who rushed in from the rear of the train were killed.\u2018Who the hell is he?\u2019The terrorist who led the train raid frowned at the man in front of him. He couldn\u2019t understand how such a wizard could be at the board of the train.\u2018No, it doesn\u2019t matter who he is. We have five wizards here.\u2019They recruited a large number of people who learned magic. Even if there is an unknown internal security manpower, it can be wiped out with overwhelming force.He didn\u2019t expect that there would be a wizard, but even if it was, there was only one opponent. They had 5 wizards and their leader, Mayhem, was a 4th-rank wizard.\u2018Unless the opponent is at least a 5th-rank wizard there will be no problem.\u2019There aren\u2019t many wizards on this continent with that much skill and if he had achieved 5th rank or higher at such a young age, rumors would have already spread. At most he could be at the 4th-rank like Mayhem. Maybe the man in front of him knew about it, so he didn\u2019t want to use magic.\u201cHmm\u2026.5 wizards.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s too late for you now.\u201d\u201cThen, I have no choice but to change my method a little.\u201dAfter saying that, the man fluttered the hem of his frock coat and threw himself out of the wrecked train.\u201cUh, huh? Did he jump?\u201d\u201cDid you choose to commit suicide because you thought you couldn\u2019t win?\u201dOne of them, one of the wizards, stuck his head out over the broken bulkhead, but he couldn\u2019t see anything under the distant cliff.\u201cHe must have fallen down and died!\u201d\u201cI thought he would do something, but he was just a coward.\u201dThe moment everyone was about to come to that conclusion.Pussack!A flash of light pierced the head of the wizard, who was looking down. His body, which lost balance, leaned forward and fell out of the train.\u201cWhat?!\u201d\u201cHanson is dead!\u201d\u201cWhere did the flash just come from?\u201dWhile everyone was puzzled, Mayhem, the leader of the wizards, twisted his face and looked up.\u201cHe\u2019s on the roof!\u201d\u201cOn the train? But didn\u2019t he jumped down a little while ago?\u201d\u201cDid he use flying magic?\u201d\u201cIs it possible to catch up and get on a moving train with flying magic?!\u201d\u201cHurry up and chase him!\u201d* * *\u2018I was going to eliminate another one while they were distracted.\u2019Loud noises came from below. Now that they realized I\u2019m alive they will try to kill me with all their might.I pretended to jump, hung from the wall, and then climbed right up to make them lose their vigilance.I can\u2019t help but be satisfied with taking one of the five wizards.\u201cGo up!\u201d\u201cKill him!\u201dA voice echoed through the car, and then one by one they started climbing up the ladder to the roof, but it won\u2019t be that easy.I fired a magical energy at them, turned my back and ran towards the vehicle behind me. Those who tried to climb up had no choice but to descend again due to an attack passing overhead.Thump thump thump.As I ran and made noise on purpose the people waiting in the vehicle heard the sound and followed me.\u201cHe\u2019s going to the back of the train!\u201d\u201cChase!\u201dThey easily followed me. I guess getting rid of one wizard seemed to have a pretty big effect.Even if they risk their lives and commit suicide, does it mean that it is unacceptable for a colleague to die at the hands of others? It is indeed a contradictory attitude.\u2018If you become emotional like this, I will be more grateful.\u2019* * *The terrorists split in half to catch the wizard who escaped to the rear of the train. After all, even if the opponent is a wizard he\u2019s not their target.Except for a few who will assist the wizards, the rest decided to aim for the first class of the first vehicle that has not yet been penetrated. The wizards headed to the rear and the other group to the front.\u201cDamn! Where is he?\u201d\u201cIs anyone on the roof? Why don\u2019t you say anything?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go back!\u201dThey opened the door in a hurry.\u2018Quaaang!\u2019The door exploded and a bright red flame engulfed the terrorists. In an instant, the five of them turned into black charcoal and fell to the ground.The magical flame went out like a candle after it had faithfully performed its role.\u201cWicked bastard!\u201d\u201cTo set a trap in front of the door!\u201dThe wizard\u2019s leader, Mayhem, wept as he looked at the corpses of his dead compatriots.\u2018Did you magically set up a trap in front of the door in that short time?\u2019His swiftness was astounding, but what made him even more nervous was his opponent\u2019s behavior. Usually, the wizards from noble families he knows are extremely reluctant to move because of their arrogance since birth.When they use magic, they always stand in the open as if to show off their magic. But the man he\u2019s following now didn\u2019t.\u2018I feel like the situation is unfavorable, so I immediately run away, and then, after arousing the other person\u2019s carelessness, I attack. There is no way this is the way of a normal wizard.\u2019Rather than being a wizard, this move was closer to a mercenary or hunter.\u2018What the hell is this guy\u2026\u2026\u2019At first, he thought that a sorcerer who killed his compatriots. After all, most of the people on this train were either nobles or wealthy merchants. They are all sucking the blood of poor commoners and standing on it.\u2018But he\u2019s different.\u2019Mayhem, who was worried, opened his mouth with a more heavy expression on his face.\u201cEveryone be careful. From now on, we take the lead. We don\u2019t know what trap he may have placed, so move as carefully as possible.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dWith Mayhem in the lead, the wizards took the lead and moved while checking if there were any traps installed in the hallways or walls. As a result, a considerable amount of time was consumed.\u201cDon\u2019t be in a hurry. After all, he can\u2019t get off the end of the train.\u201dThe wizard\u2019s leader, Mayhem, was walking slowly and suddenly stopped. She felt a sense of alienation that could not be described in words and quickly realized the reason.Rumble!A loud noise echoed from the end of the train. The slow-moving terrorists instinctively knew something was wrong the moment they heard the sound.\u201cAh! He disconnected the train and ran away!\u201dIt was too late to stop him. In the first place, the opponent did not have to fight them. It was enough to just run away and waste their time after deliberately he raised their awareness with his trap.\u201cChase! Don\u2019t let him run away!\u201dThey are now in a hurry, and have no choice but to chase and kill the sorcerer who has fled.They hurriedly ran through the train, and eventually arrived at the nose of the last vehicle, No. 12. When they opened the door, all they saw was the snow-capped mountain range and railroad tracks, not the scene of Vehicle 12, which should have been there.Mayhem clenched his teeth.\u2018I made a mistake. He kept reminding us that he didn\u2019t have to fight us.\u2019He overlooked an important fact.Who would have expected that the opponent would run away with such a determination?\u201cDamn, did I miss it?\u201d\u201cI will definitely find you and kill you.\u201dWhile everyone was clenching their teeth and stared outside Mayhem felt a surge of powerful magic behind his back.\u201cWhat is this\u2026\u2026.\u201dHe hurriedly turned his head and looked back and saw the figure of the man who should have disappeared with the detached vehicle No. 12.\u201cWhy are you here\u2026\u2026\u201dBut it wasn\u2019t the man\u2019s existence that mattered. The most important thing to pay attention to is the magic that was completed in front of him, almost before it was activated. It was a very ferocious and dangerous type of elemental magic.\u201cAvoid it!\u201dMayhem cried out and raised his magic power as much as possible to create a barrier of strong magical power.Immediately afterward, a huge magic engulfed the entire vehicle No. 11 and swept the interior like a storm. The pure white flame swept away all the terrorists who had not yet evacuated or responded.* * *\u201cIs it over?\u201dI muttered as I watched the magical flames gradually disappear.They thought I was going to run away in Vehicle 12, and they were focused on it. Everyone would have thought so since I used a trap to buy time and detached vehicle 12.In the end, running away was nothing more than a deceptive tactic to deceive them. Thanks to that, I was able to gather them all in one place and deal with them at once.\u2018It seems that there are still guys left in the leading vehicle, but it doesn\u2019t matter since I\u2019ve dealt with all the wizards.\u2019As I was thinking, something rose from the rubble.\u201cYou were still alive.\u201d\u201dBoy\u2026\u2026.\u201dIt was the leader who led the wizards who got up. At that moment, perhaps he had defended himself with a barrier and escaped the explosion but his physical condition was so disastrous that he was barely alive.He couldn\u2019t completely block the explosion and his face was half melted, while his whole body was burnt, even one of his arms was missing.\u201cWhy the hell did you kill them? Isn\u2019t it pitiful for our compatriots who are working hard for the world?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dWhat the heck did he say, isn\u2019t this a very naive bullshit? When I shut my mouth in bewilderment, he looked at me with angry eyes.\u201cDon\u2019t you feel sorry for the people who died at your hands?\u201d\u201cI thought that you were crazy from the beginning, but you were crazier than I thought.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about when you attack the train and kill all the passengers?\u201dThese guys raided the train and killed the passengers there on sight. Now they treat me like a bad guy because their co-workers are dead, honestly, it\u2019s just annoying.\u201cEven if they died, they were cheap!\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you the one who tried to kill me in the first place? We already have to kill each other, so what are you talking about now?\u201d\u201cThat\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIf I couldn\u2019t kill you, I would have to die.\u201d\u201cYou boy\u2026\u2026Who the hell are you?\u201dHe gave up arguing and asked about my identity but I couldn\u2019t answer because I saw countless shadows flying towards me from the outside.Even in the midst of a raging blizzard, the sound of drawing a sword is eerily heard. A white light flashed through the wide open back door and cut the wizard in half.A solid line is drawn from the head to the groin and the moment the pure white shadow jumped over the wizard and landed on the ground, his body split apart and he fell to the side.No blood flowed from his body because the cut section was frozen with pure white ice. Behind the fallen corpse a knight with a white cloak fluttering appeared.\u201cAre you okay?\u201dI answered with a nod of my head.The pattern on the shoulder strap is in the shape of a pure white eagle. It was a mark of the Border Guard Knights in charge of protecting the empire.\u201cDon\u2019t worry we will deal with them.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They are powerful enough to catch up with a running horse on two legs and crush rocks with their leg strength.They were the knights in charge of the most rugged section of the Exilion Empire.\u201cAaaah!\u201d\u201cThe Empire\u2019s Border Guard! Everyone run away!\u201d\u201cHelp me!\u201dThe terrorist\u2019s screams echoed everywhere, they stood no chance against the border guards.* * *\u2018Is it over?\u2019The Cold Steel Knights under the Border Guard Corps.It may not seem like a big deal just by hearing the name, but as it is made up of those who work in this rugged and cold Arete Mountains, meaning that every member is an elite.I returned to room 403, which was still intact and stumped in my seat. The inside of the train was full of cuts and marks that remained from the fierce battle.Fortunately, a defensive magic circle was engraved on them; if it had been an ordinary train, it would have already derailed and fell down the cliff.\u201cWe have subjugated all the thieves, so please rest assured. The train will arrive soon, so please wait for a while.\u201dKnights were seen walking around the inside of the train, calming the survivors. In fact, even if they were survivors, they were all first-class people who were protected in the safest place.It was hard to find survivors except for the 1st cabin, everyone else was practically annihilated.It was unfortunate even considering the small number of people on the train.\u2018I\u2019m glad they got rid of all the terrorists though.\u2019All those who attacked the train were killed by the knights. For bringing so many wizards, it was truly a vain result.\u2018Ah. I\u2019m the one who killed the wizards.\u2019Now is not the time for me to worry about that.Soon the train will arrive at its destination. As it passed the mountain range covered in pure white snow, fresh vegetation began to appear sporadically. The icy mountain range disappeared and was replaced by a wide plain.What was visible beyond the horizon was Leathervelk, one of the major cities of the Exilion Empire.\u2018Big.\u2019Even though it is far away, the majesty of the city is enough to be seen at a glance. Buildings soaring high like towers towards the sky, factory chimneys constantly spewing white smoke and even large flying boats fluttering among the clouds dyed with light.Mechanical boats made of windmills and brass are lined up above the river that runs through the city, and steamships move quickly between them.Magical engineering created by combining advanced mechanical engineering with magic. The civilization it has achieved is very similar to the so-called \u2018Steam Punk\u2019.\u2018Now that I\u2019m here, it\u2019s not really surprising.\u2019Still, I couldn\u2019t erase the strange feeling that the sense of disparity created by the memories of my previous life disappeared.I died in an accident in my previous life, and when I woke up, I was shocked to find out that I was reborn as a baby in this world but that was already 27 years ago.The years have gone by so quickly.This world is a unique world of the Victorian era and what is commonly called the Belle \u00c9poque, where magic, sub-races and monsters exist.I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because I\u2019ve entered the world of a game or a novel I liked\u2026\u2026This is a different world that doesn\u2019t even exist in my memory, literally without any connection.\u201cAre you okay?\u201dSomeone spoke to me as I sat still and stared at the approaching destination. When I turned my head, I noticed neat black hair at the entrance to the half-broken room. Was it the woman who saved me?She was looking at this with worried eyes.\u201cWas it possible that some kind of harm was done to you by the terrorists a while ago?\u201dI immediately shook my head.\u201cNo. Thanks to the knights\u2019 help nothing happened to me. I was just thinking about something.\u201d\u201cAh. If so, I\u2019m glad.\u201dIt was like a rose blossomed when she smiled.She was quite a beauty, pure white skin and white armor without blemishes. Contrasting black hair further accentuated her strong image. She is a good person with no ambiguity in her personality. Otherwise she wouldn\u2019t have been worried for someone like me.Being a member of the Cold Steel Knights at such a young age means she is a genius. I felt like I was living in a different world.\u201cMy name is Veronica Deville. What about you?\u201dDeville.I\u2019ve heard of it. It\u2019s said to be a prestigious company that produced many famous knights in the empire.\u201cI am\u2026\u2026\u201dPaaaaang\u2014!!!As I was about to say my name, the train blew his horn to signal its arrival.I shut my mouth, and Veronica turned her head to look outside.\u201cWe have finally arrived at Leathervelk.\u201dThe train, which slowed down slowly, came to a complete stop at the train station.The station seen through the window was crowded with people. It seems that people had come to take a look after hearing the news that the train had been attacked. When they saw the appearance of the broken train, they started talking among themselves.The police stepped forward and built a wall to prevent people from approaching, and there were also reporters trying to get a scoop through the cracks.Like a big city, Leathervelk was crowded from the start.\u201cThere are so many people. It seems that the news has already spread.\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201dBecause it has nothing to do with me anyway.If there is one thing I regret now, it\u2019s that this train, which was originally supposed to go to the capital, had to stop at Leathervelk due to the attack. However, there was no way to get a refund for the tickets I had already paid, so I had no choice but to get off here.Swoosh.At that moment, the closed door swung open and police officers in uniform rushed in.What happened all of a sudden?\u201cPassengers, please do not leave and wait in your seat. I have something to check.\u201d\u201cWhat is this?\u201dWhen Veronica asked, one of the cops asked.\u201cWho are you?\u201d\u201cMy name is Veronica from the Cold Steel Knights. I\u2019d like to ask how the hell this happened.\u201d\u201cAh, you were a Knight of the Cold Steel Knights. Nice to meet you, I am Officer Remlus from the Leathervelk Metropolitan Police Agency.\u201d\u201cYes, Officer Remlus, nice to meet you. So what is this?\u201d\u201cI heard the train was attacked in the Arete mountains.\u201d\u201cYes, that is correct. We took care of all the raiders.\u201d\u201cThank you for your hard work but there\u2019s something suspicious in the report we received.\u201d\u201cSuspicious\u201dAt those words, I became anxious, but then something caught my eye.\u201cEven though there were wizards among the raiders, there was no way that a magic train protected by magic would be so easily attacked.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cIt is clear that there was someone from the inside involved as well.\u201d\u201cThat\u2026\u201dVeronica\u2019s eyes widened in surprise but she nodded her head and agreed with the officer\u2019s words.His assumption was correct, I actually ran into a guy who disguised himself as a train employee and dispelled the magical veil from the inside. It made it easy for the terrorists to get into the train, and the passengers inside were killed.\u201cSome of the survivors might be working with the terrorists so we\u2019re just trying to verify their identities. Don\u2019t worry too much. Those whose identities have been verified will be sent back immediately.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dVeronica said and looked back at this side with a smile. Her smile was full of relief, but a cold sweat ran down my back.They\u2019re verifying identities but my mask is gone. I gently stroked my face with my fingertips.\u2018This is a big deal\u2026!\u2019I was on this train as a wealthy merchant in his mid-40s named Gerard. Naturally, a person named Gerard would be listed on the list of passengers. That\u2019s fine, but the problem is my face right now.How can this face without a beard or wrinkles belong to someone in their mid-forties?\u2018\u2026 What should I do?\u2019I did not lead the terrorist attack and I was a passenger who was unfairly involved, but I couldn\u2019t be proud of it either.Gerard is a fake identity to hide my identity and fake identity is a felony in any country.If I\u2019m lucky enough I might be hanged, but there\u2019s a high possibility that I would be subjected to severe torture since I\u2019m suspected of terrorism. If I was a normal person there would be no need to change my identity.Should I run away?\u2018No.\u2019Now, there are Cold Steel Knights on this train, and even the Imperial soldiers are spread outside the train just in case. The moment I try to run away from here, I\u2019ll be dead in less than a minute.Running away is the worst option. But if I stand still, my identity will be revealed.I tried not to show my anxiety.Meanwhile, the police brought documents and were trying to compare them with the people in the train.I was asked.\u201cIn what room were you staying?\u201d\u201cNumber 403, here\u2019s my ticket.\u201dI calmly took out a train ticket from my inner pocket and showed it to the officer. After confirming that the ticket was not a fake, he shuffled through the documents immediately.\u2026\u201d403, here it is. Two guests stayed in the room. Rudger Chelici, a man in his mid 20\u2019s and Gerard, a man in his 40s.\u201dThen he lifts his head and glances at me. It was like asking why you are alone when there are two of you.\u201cWhy are you alone?\u201d\u201cGerard was swept away by an explosion during and fell down a remote cliff in the Arete Mountains.\u201dHe fell down the cliff of that rugged mountain range, so even his body would not be found.My words made the police even more suspicious. I clenched my fists, and desperately kept my expressionless face.If I go on like this I\u2019ll be caught. But that doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s no way out of this situation.\u2018Escape? It\u2019s impossible in the first place.\u2019And another problem is Veronica, the woman with a fluttering white cloak in front of me. She is the woman who, not long ago, had split in half a terrorist.She had no hesitation in killing people.She\u2019s smiling at me now, but when it turns out that I\u2019m suspicious, she\u2019ll be the first to draw her sword. Considering her ability to join the Cold Steel Knights at a young age, she must be much more intimidating than the police outside the train.All sorts of thoughts were swirling around in my head.Veronica, who had been silently watching the situation, stepped forward.\u201cWait. He was not a suspect in the first place.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cBecause he was fighting terrorists before our Cold Steel Knights arrived. I saw it with my own two eyes.\u201d\u201cDid you fight?\u201dThe officer mumbled in disbelief and looked over the list again. Then he nodded his head as if he had understood something, and looked back at me with a changed face.\u201cThen it means that Mr. Rudger Chelici is alive, and Mr. Gerard died in the explosion.\u201d\u2026uh?No wait. What now?The face of the officer, who was checking the list more closely, was astonished.\u201cHuh? You are a new teacher who has been assigned to the Theon Academy?!\u201d\u201cTheon teacher? Really?\u201dAt the cry of Officer Remlus, Veronica also widened her eyes.Watching the two people\u2019s reactions, like a scene from a comedy, I realized how things were going. It was really unbelievable, but\u2026\u2026They believed I was Rudger. It was so sudden, but I made a quick decision.I immediately regained my composure and nodded.\u201cYes. That\u2019s right.\u201dI picked up the suitcase that Rudger had dropped before he died. It was a good idea to have it ready in advance, just in case.\u201cI am Rudger Chelici.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Most of the photos exist only in black and white and the quality is not very good, so detailed comparison is impossible.When comparing people, in the end, they have no choice but to rely on clothes, age, and overall physique. It was not unreasonable that they were mistaken.\u2018I\u2019m sorry. Mr. Rudger.\u2019It\u2019s a pity for the dead, but that doesn\u2019t mean I can die too, right? The living must live.Rudger\u2019s status was very helpful in escaping this situation.\u201cUnbelievable. You were a new teacher at Theon Academy. The magic I saw back then..\u2026\u201dThe moment the name Theon appeared, Veronica\u2019s voice toward me changed.Did she see me using magic? Maybe that\u2019s why I gained her trust even more.Even the officer who was half-doubting me and who was about to interrogate me immediately nodded his head.\u201cPlease forgive me for being rude because of the circumstances.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201dEven as I said that, I thought to myself that the name Theon was really great.The only magic academy that exists in the Empire, and even on the continent, the best academy is Theon.The name \u2018Theon\u2019 was never taken lightly, and it was natural for them to be surprised when they heard that I was a teacher there.\u201cYou\u2019re a Theon teacher.\u201d\u201cAt such a young age, that\u2019s great.\u201dThe other guards and the police also whispered among themselves.Whatever happened, I decided to act more shamelessly. From this moment, I will become Rudger Chelici.\u201cI, we will guide you to the exit.\u201d\u201cFine.\u201d\u201cYou are one of those who will nurture the future of the empire, how could we let it go? You were wasting your time because of us.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d\u201cIt is because we are sorry.\u201dNo, moving with you guys is inconvenient!I couldn\u2019t say those words, so I accepted with a blunt face.\u201cMs. Veronica, it was a short meeting, but it was nice.\u201dIt was a short meeting, but I don\u2019t think it was bad. She smiled and waved her hand at me, perhaps thinking the same thing.\u201cYes, Mr. Rudger! See you later if you have time!\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dI\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll see each other again in the future.Guided by the guards, I was able to safely escape the crowd to the exit of the train station. It was a train station with a lot of people coming and going, so the exit was also crowded with people.I opened my mouth thinking that this was it.\u201cIt is enough to have come this far. From here on, I will move on my own. More than that, I feel burdened.\u201d\u201cAh yes!\u201dThe guard saluted me and then disappeared back into the station.I greeted him with a light bow, and let out a sigh.Seriously, it would have been a big mess. I\u2019m glad the other side misunderstood me for a moment, otherwise, my fake identity would have been exposed and I would have been accused of being an accomplice in terrorism.Now that the emergency is over, I\u2019ll be fine.\u201cAre you Mr. Rudger Chelici?\u201dAt that moment, I could feel my blood freezing coldly at the sound of a voice coming from behind me.When I slowly turned my head to look back, I saw an old gentleman with a rather stern posture looking at me.I calmed my startled heart and answered calmly.\u201cYes. That\u2019s right. Who are you?\u201d\u201cHello. My name is Wilford, a user of Theon Academy. I came to meet Mr. Rudger.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Do you mean pick up? Me?\u201d\u201cYes. I heard that the train was attacked. I came to see you in a hurry to see if something had happened, but I\u2019m really glad that you seem to be okay.\u201dWilford said so, and he opened the door of the carriage next to him.\u201cGet in.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dI rolled my eyes. Can I say that I\u2019m the wrong person?I don\u2019t know when that old man named Wilford got here but I\u2019m sure he saw me with the officer. It is practically impossible to pretend that I\u2019m someone else and refuse. Above all else, there was no sign of presence when he first appeared, this man is no ordinary user.\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201dI had no choice but to get into the carriage.* * *Veronica, the deputy commander of the Knights of Cold Steel, remembered the departed Rudger.\u2018Rudger Chelici.\u2019From the first time I saw him, I thought he was unusual because I saw him sweeping away all terrorists with pure white flames.The other knights might not have been able to see well because they were far away, but she was confident that she had better eyesight than the general.In a situation where he was outnumbered Rudger defeated the opposing wizards easily.\u2018He\u2019s not an ordinary person.\u2019A simple yet gorgeous black frock coat with a neat suit and golden thread over it, a reticent impression and serious eyes, the long hair slightly pulled back, from the nape of the neck into a ponytail.Looking closely he seemed like a nobleman with a sharp impression but above all, what stimulated her nerves the most was the spirit that subtly emanated from Rudger.\u2018At first I thought it was a royal family member who hid his identity.\u2019The elegance that emanated from Rudger was similar to what Veronica felt when she faced the nobles in the imperial court. So when she was told that Rudger was going to be a teacher at the Theon Academy, she was convinced of his identity.No, she even thought that even the huge name of Theon would not be a medal for this man. No one marvels at fish swimming well and birds flying through the sky. The same was true for Rudger\u2019s position as Theon.Her strong sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu became certain when she heard his name.\u2018Rudger Chelici, a young wizard with a lot of fame recently. He was the youngest to achieve the fourth rank, submitted 12 papers to the Mato, and even redefined one of the most difficult things: Langerister\u2019s formula.\u2019Other than that, I heard that he had a history of serving as an officer in the military, and it is said that he majored in cryptid hunting.\u2018My younger brother is attending Thorn. I\u2019ll have to ask him how are the classes he\u2019s teaching.\u2019* * *My plan to run away as soon as I left the train station was thwarted from the start. I didn\u2019t expect the academy would send someone directly to pick me up here. I thought it was too much of an exaggeration, but the fact that it was the Theon Academy convinced me again.If you are a teacher assigned to the best academy in the empire, you will be welcomed wherever you go. Hearing that such high-quality manpower was involved in the terrorist attack, Theon must have been worried.\u2018It\u2019s a big deal.\u2019I looked inside the carriage.A soft red chair and colorful patterns around it. No matter how I look at it, it was a carriage that could only be thought of as luxurious. There is almost no vibration even when it\u2019s going so fast.Leading this black chariot was a golem in the form of a steaming horse. It was simply amazing to see this vehicle, one of the latest magical engineering results, made with a half-mix of machine and magic.Knights don\u2019t get old easily just because they age. Rather, the old knights are more dangerous because they have superhuman bodies and years of experience.\u2018If I try to leave here with an excuse, he\u2019ll get suspicious. I can\u2019t run away secretly, and even if I succeed, I\u2019ll be tracked down as soon as a report comes in.\u2019A number of other problems arose.First of all, it is about the identity of Gerard that I used to use. Since this fake identity was effectively treated as dead, it was necessary to create a new identity and that would require a lot of time and money.Usually I would find a place to stay until I gather information and create a new identity since having lost my existing identity, means I am an illegal immigrant. The absence of an identity is no different from the absence of human rights.After considering all these possibilities, I decided to give up running away for now.\u2018For now, I\u2019ll not do anything that will make me suspicious.\u2019First, let\u2019s go to Theon Academy. It wouldn\u2019t be a bad idea to think about the future there.When the speed of the fast-moving carriage slowed down, I had a gut feeling that I had finally arrived at the Theon Academy.As if to prove that, the carriage\u2019s front window swung open to the side, and Wilford spoke up.\u201cMr. Rudger, we\u2019re here.\u201dAt Wilford\u2019s words, I glanced at the scenery outside the window. The first thing I saw was a grand gate and beyond that was a vast expanse of land. The road for carriages was paved neatly and green trees were evenly planted to the left and right, adding to the refined beauty.In the dazzling sunlight, the buildings of the Theon Academy shone white.\u2018Are those the main building, the villa, the park, and the auditorium?\u2019Apart from the fact that each one was large in scale, it was not possible to estimate exactly how wide the site was.\u2018Isn\u2019t this bigger than any other city?\u2019The security guard at the front gate opened it immediately and bowed lightly toward us.Passing through the front door, I could see how much magic was engraved in the vicinity. The number of magic circles stacked on top of each other was so great that the original shape could not be seen.\u2018Crazy.\u2019There won\u2019t be any big guys coming through the front gate, but if there\u2019s really a guy like that, it will turn to dust and disappear in a second.The place where the steel horse leading the carriage stopped was a building further inside than the main building. Soaring high like a crown, it was truly a magnificent castle.\u201cIt\u2019s here. Get off.\u201dAs I was about to get my bag, Wilford stopped me.\u201cWe\u2019ll come back, so you don\u2019t have to carry your luggage with you.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201dI got out of the carriage and followed Wilford past the fountain and the beautiful statues into the building. The inside was just as spectacular as the outside.The light from the glass window spreads like a soft reflection inside, creating a warm color and gently wrapping the skin. A fragrant smell from somewhere tickles my nose, and I hear the chirping of birds. It felt like a dream.The interior has a refined and neat design, looking like the beautiful architecture of medieval Europe. If the adjacent city Leathervelk has a steampunk atmosphere full of steam, this one is much more focused on fantasy.-Hahaha.\u2013 Baby, don\u2019t do it.As I went up the stairs along Wilford, users and students in academy uniforms passed me by. Every time they do that, I can hear them having a conversation behind me, so I guess they\u2019re gossiping because I look like a country peasant, right?Eventually, I arrived in front of a large elevator.\u201cCome this way.\u201dI boarded the elevator with Wilford. I thought it was high from the outside, but seeing it was almost 30 stories high, I was surprised once again.When the elevator arrived and the door opened, there was a long hallway covered with red carpet and a single door made of wood at the end.\u201cThe President is inside. I will be waiting here.\u201d\u201cThanks for the guidance.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s my job.\u201dI crossed the hallway and stood in front of the door to the president\u2019s office. Just as I raised my hand to knock on the door, I heard a languid yet alluring voice from inside.\u201cCome in.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dI opened the door and went inside.\u201cNice to meet you.\u201dA woman sitting at her desk with her back against the window greeted me.Considering that she has to be a lexer who is at least a 6th rank among the existing 8th ranks to be able to sit in this position, she is an undisputed first-class wizard.She had just been organizing papers, and was holding a fountain pen in her right hand, put it down aloud and stared at me. Her white hair, flowing down like a curtain, shines even more dazzlingly in the light of the glass window behind her. The hair on the outside is white, but the inside is a two-tone hair that is subtly tinged with pink.\u2018What.\u2019The moment her golden eyes turned towards me, I felt an indescribable feeling.I said in a hard voice, trying to ignore the strange sensation.\u201cThis is Rudger Chelici. The president has called me.\u201dFirst of all, I am now Rudger Chelici.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Are you alright? I was told that you were involved in a terrorist incident.\u201d\u201cIt was nothing special. I got help from the Cold Steel Knights at a dangerous moment.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s really nice. I was pretty terrified too. You\u2019re a new teacher I\u2019ve been looking for with a lot of effort, but I was wondering what to do if you got hurt. If that happens, our face won\u2019t stand up, right?\u201dSeeing her openly commenting on the school face, she certainly doesn\u2019t seem like an ordinary person.Everyone who has ascended to a high position is bound to be twisted somewhere, especially if you\u2019re a member of a wizard\u2019s family.My master was the same and so it\u2019s this woman in front of me. It wasn\u2019t too surprising.\u201cAre you not feeling well?\u201dSeeing the president staring at me with a soft smile in her eyes, I wondered if she realized something. Come to think of it, has the Chancellor ever met Rudger before?As anxious thoughts passed by, her voice awakened my thoughts.This is the first time I\u2019ve seen you in person, but you\u2019re pretty tall.\u201dFortunately, it seemed that this was the first time that \u2018Rudger\u2019 had actually met the president.I answered with a sigh of relief.\u201cThank you for the compliment, even if it\u2019s empty words.\u201d\u201cNope, it\u2019s not empty words. The students\u2019 reaction to such a handsome teacher will be positive, right?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s overrated.\u201d\u201cOkay, take this first.\u201dThe president handed me a piece of paper.\u201cIt was announced in advance, but it\u2019s good to have a thorough contract. The contract period is 2 years and the pay is as written there. Food and drink are provided automatically, so be aware.\u201dI accepted the contract and looked at the contents carefully.Anyway, the moment the preliminary status came out, I was going to throw it away and leave, so I didn\u2019t take it too seriously until I read it.\u2018Uh, what is it? Wait a minute.\u2019What was written in the contract was so surprising that it made my eyes widen.\u2018A month\u2019s salary is 30 imperial gold coins?\u2019One imperial gold coin is equivalent to 1 million denars in the continent\u2019s common currency, \u2018denar\u2019.In other words, 30 imperial gold coins means 30 million denars, this was a huge sum of nearly 300 million won on Earth in my previous life.At this point, I had no doubt about the power of Theon academy.It was the best magic academy in the empire. Even in the district where I lived, the annual salary of a lecturer at Gangnam Academy was not even 10 billion won.\u2018And there is a bonus for each semester, and another bonus at the end of the year? Is it even possible to increase pay based on performance? If students\u2019 evaluations of faculty and staff are good, the salary will increase?\u2019If the teacher does really well and gets good evaluations then together with the bonuses the annual salary will become over 500 million denars.The contract period is two years, and in total, more than 1 billion denars. With this money, I could go anywhere and make a living. I could even do a side job if I get a permit.\u2018Gulp.\u2019I swallowed saliva without realizing it.It\u2019s amazing that the salary is like this, but the subsidy when conducting classes is huge. Even more subsidies may come out depending on teacher evaluation.In addition to that, I can find a house separately and eat here, so I don\u2019t have to spend money on anything else.\u2018If I survive for two years, I would get 1 billion denars. In terms of Earth money, that\u2019s a whopping 10 billion won at a minimum. If I do well, I can even increase my salary, and I can also extend it after the contract is over.\u2019This contract was crazy. Is this the best academy in the empire?The life I\u2019ve lived so far\u2026\u201cHow is it?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Not bad.\u201dThis is awesome.I took a deep breath and read the contract again. But there was a fundamental problem.\u2018It is true that Theon is great enough to give me this amount of money, but at the same time, I also have a considerable sense of weight as a teacher.\u2019Will I be able to bear the seat?In this place where geniuses were thriving would I be able to work properly as a teacher?\u2018No way. It would be rather a miracle that my lowliness didn\u2019t show up in one day.\u2019Still, I\u2019m confident in my mouth and bluffing ability, because I grew up in an environment where I could die if I didn\u2019t.I quickly shook my head and analyzed the situation.\u2018The salary alone is attractive, but it is burdensome. I can\u2019t refuse because I\u2019ve already come this far. Rudger has already become a teacher here and I became Rudger Chelici.\u2019Can I say no in this situation in the first place?My appointment as a teacher has already been confirmed, and I can\u2019t suddenly say that I won\u2019t do it now or else people would get suspicious.In fact, the answer I had to give was already decided.\u2018I have no choice but to do it.\u2019I have now made up my mind on how to use Rudger Chelici identity.\u2018Just close your eyes and survive here for two years.\u2019In two years, this life could be over, they would give me a lot of money and I would be free to leave, so isn\u2019t this better than the military?Thinking that way made me feel at ease.I handed the contract to the president and opened my mouth.\u201cI checked everything.\u201d\u201cThen I wish you all the best in the future. Mr. Rudger.\u201d\u201cYes. I will leave it up to you president.\u201dI shook hands with the president who smiled towards me.I was very happy but I tried my best to maintain my expressionless face.* * *After meeting with the president, I followed the guidance of Mr. Wilford, who was waiting outside, and headed to my assigned dormitory.Should they really call it Theon Academy?Even the teacher-only building on the site looks expensive.I couldn\u2019t believe that the two-story house I saw in a fairy tale was my home.\u201cThere are still three weeks left until the start of the class, so you can rest until then.\u201dAfter saying those words, Mr. Wilford led the carriage again and disappeared. He did not forget his modest attitude even when he left. He was truly a model gentleman.\u2018Shall I go?\u2019Packing my suitcase, I entered the house. I saw it from the outside, but when I went inside, it felt very different. The furniture was also equipped with all sorts of things, and there was no dust to be seen due to regular maintenance.I checked the bathroom just in case, and was surprised again. The bathroom was filled with pure white tiles and looked like something aristocrats would use. There is water and even a bathtub where I can take a bubble bath.After checking every corner of the house, I sat down on a soft sofa.\u2018From now on, I will be an academy teacher\u2026\u2026\u2019So many things happened today.I was unintentionally involved in a terrorist attack, mistaken for someone else, and even came to the Theon Academy to work as a teacher.It\u2019s just a wonder how the heck it came to be like this, but since I\u2019ve come this far, I can\u2019t escape.If I suddenly disappear my Rudger identity will be under suspicion and I\u2019ll have no place in the Empire since my real face was seen.In the end, I had no choice but to act as Rudger Chelsea.\u201cWhoa. It\u2019s hard.\u201dIt has been 27 years since I came to this world.I was reincarnated in this world with no special abilities and only memories of my previous life. However, the existence of my parents in the present life was so daunting that in the end, I had to survive on my own.My life was strange and I had to overcome crises of death several times while getting caught up in all kinds of events.For me, the current situation is just embarrassing. How did I end up as an academy teacher? And even at the best academy in the Empire.\u2018This is actually a fake job.\u2019I wasn\u2019t even aiming for it, but that doesn\u2019t mean I can stop now.The moment I get out of here, I\u2019ll be eaten by a tiger. That was my situation now.\u2018Okay 2 years. I only have to survive 2 years. That\u2019s enough.\u2019I also needed a new identity so in this situation being Rudger was very attractive. Rudger Chelici is a man who crossed over to the Empire from a distant land. Here he will never run into anyone who knows him.I decided to find out a little more about the person called Rudger, just in case.I grabbed the suitcase and climbed into the bedroom on the second floor. When I entered the room, I put the curtains on the window and looked carefully inside the room to check for any unexpected external surveillance.\u2018Nothing caught.\u2019I opened the suitcase right away because I thought it was okay now.\u2018Rattle.\u2019\u201cHmm?\u201dIs it locked?I carefully checked the suitcase made of leather. Upon closer inspection, a fine magic circle was engraved on the metal lock.\u2018This\u2026\u2026It\u2019s security magic.\u2019Although the scale is not large, it was a magic circle with a high level of difficulty, which requires detailed mana management, to be engraved in this place.\u2018Is this because he\u2019s a teacher assigned to the Theon Academy?\u2019Stepping away from the suitcase, I pondered how to do this. It wasn\u2019t that I gave up, it was to devise a way to open it.\u2018It would be convenient if there was a reagent, but the existing luggage has been mailed in advance, so I have no choice but to use another method.\u2019I took a towel and wet it with water in moderation. Having set aside the wet towel, I grabbed a stick and started a small fire at the end.I used \u201cPyro,\u201d which could be said to be a basic elemental magic. It is only about the size of a lighter flame, but its heat is considerable.I brought the fire from the end of the stick to the clasp of the suitcase. The scorching heat began to heat the brass. A few minutes later, as the brass heats up and turns red, I grab the wet towel.The heated metal cooled rapidly with the sound of water evaporating. Instantly, the lock was twisted, and the magic circle engraved on it was also twisted.Of course, doing this doesn\u2019t make the magic circle\u2019s effect disappear. Because magic isn\u2019t that easy.\u2018But I can make a momentary gap in a strong wall.\u2019Without missing the moment, I shot my magic sharply and pierced the center of the magic circle, an important part that can be called \u2018core\u2019 in the magic circle.\u2018Paching!\u2019\u2018Done.\u2019When it was destroyed, the effect of the magic circle disappeared. At the same time, the lock opened with a click sound.\u2018Opening this was a piece of cake.\u2019It is not uncommon to have a magic circle or barrier engraved on a suitcase like this. Most wizards are very sensitive to security, so security magic is close to basic knowledge.If you can\u2019t open it yourself, you can even ask an acquaintance or a professional engraving company.If someone tries to forcibly remove the security magic, discarding of the contents is activated. It was a demonstration of the extreme ideology unique to wizards that they would rather destroy their data than have it revealed.However, in order to safely disarm the security magic, it is necessary to analyze the magic to see how it is implemented. Naturally, the process took a very long time, and I couldn\u2019t afford to do that.So this method was chosen. A method close to trickery that does not require analysis of magic.\u2018It is enough to know where the magic circle was engraved and its material.\u2019Usually, strong metal is the mainstay for engraving such a magic circle because it can\u2019t be engraved all over the leather bag.Leather is a very poor medium for transmitting magic power, the same goes for fabric and paper. With the exception of parchment made by peeling the bark of hemp, it was impossible to engrave a magic circle or barrier on cloth or paper unless it was an Arch Mage of at least 6th rank.Conversely, it is metal that has a fairly good conductivity of magic. The most popular are iron and brass. Better materials are silver, gold, and platinum.The best thing is a gem made by crafting a raw stone, but since the material itself is so expensive, it is not used unless you are a high-ranking nobleman.Of course, cheap iron or brass is the most popular, and I was fully familiar with the properties of both materials.Heating and expanding the metal engraved with the magic circle, then cooling it with cold water quickly to shrink it again. The magic circle engraved on the metal will be misaligned and twisted in the process of expansion and contraction of the metal.Even if there is a deviation like this, the magic circle will try to recover automatically in a line so it\u2019s not a big problem. However, the gap that is created is very fatal. At that moment I used my magic power and destroyed the magic circle core.\u2018I\u2019m glad it went well.\u2019Well, it\u2019s not a commonly known method, it\u2019s just a trick made by appropriately applying scientific knowledge.Most of the wizards are people who are hung up on history and tradition, so they often overlook science. As a result, there were many cases where they did not prepare for, and that was what this company was hoping for.\u2018If he was a real madman, he would have carried an iron case covered with magic circles.\u2019Fortunately, Rudger Chelici wasn\u2019t that far off.I opened the suitcase and checked the contents of what was inside.\u2018Hmm, this\u2026\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 8": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Academy\u2019s Undercover ProfessorCH 8Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayC8: False Identity (3)There wasn\u2019t anything in Rudger\u2019s suitcase that could cause an eye-opener, just a change of clothes and books. Other than that, a lot of paperwork and miscellaneous things.\u2018I thought there would be something bigger.\u2019I grouped the textbooks, magic books, and thesis together and set them aside, and also sorted out the clothes and put them away.In the case of books, there were many other things such as popular novels and essays by famous scientists in addition to magic books.I\u2019ve read all sorts of miscellaneous things. Other than that, a few letters, identification, and personal belongings are all things.Even tools are just a pocket watch or a small pipe to be used as a magic medium and a wallet with money.I immediately checked the ID and documents one by one.\u2018Rudger Chelici, a descendant of the fallen nobles of Queoden, a small to medium-sized kingdom in the northern continent. He has no siblings and both of his parents are dead.\u2019It\u2019s not bad.He is a fallen aristocrat, but he nominally holds the title of nobility, so he will not be greatly disregarded wherever he goes, and since he has no family, no one will recognize me.His history is incredibly splendid. He submitted 12 papers to the Mattapan, and he was the youngest person to reach the 4th rank? He even became a military officer?\u2019No wonder he became a teacher at Theon.At such a young age, his record is already very impressive.\u2018Is the subject he would\u2019ve teached magic manifestation and specialization? Mana emission and elemental elements are the main things.\u2019Considering that he specializes in apparitions, there is a high probability that he will teach actual combat in the subject.I opened the letters and looked at the contents. If there was a conversation he had with an acquaintance, I had to catch his small habits and learn them.\u2018The content of the letter is irrelevant.\u2019The letters, presumed to have been exchanged with acquaintances, consisted of formal conversations such as the soon to be assigned to the academy, what books he liked, and where and what happened.Even when he was in the military, I don\u2019t think he had any close friends.Given that there is very little personal content, he didn\u2019t seem to be particularly close with the person he was writing to.\u2018Now all that\u2019s left it\u2019s\u2026\u2026\u2019It is information about the basic content of classes to teach students after the start of the semester, and how the Theon Academy was formed and operated.First of all, it was necessary to go around and learn about the topography of Theon.\u2018Gurgling.\u2019As I was about to go outside right away, I had to stop at the roaring sound of my stomach. Come to think of it, I haven\u2019t eaten anything since today\u2019s train.I am mentally exhausted because I have so much work to do today. Let\u2019s eat rice first and rest well today.* * *Two weeks have passed since then.In the meantime, I went to every nook and cranny of Theon Academy to learn about the geography of this place. As expected at first glance, the site of the Theon Academy was truly unimaginable.I sat on an outdoor bench in a secluded cafe and watched the peaceful scenery. I\u2019ve just finished checking everything out, and now I\u2019m just thinking about the classes I would have to teach.\u2018Is it because the opening time is approaching? I see students often.\u2019Students in Theon Academy uniforms were seen walking around. The uniform design is cool for men and pretty for girls. Did I mention that it was a uniform made by a famous designer in the empire?Perhaps it was because it was an academy that taught magic, some of them flew on broomsticks or moved on strange mechanical dolls. Seeing young people laughing and talking to each other, I thought they had a good time.Since I came to this world, every day has been a fierce battle, but these children are living a blessed life thanks to their innate talents and circumstances.\u201cHmm.\u201dTwo female students passing by this way glanced at me and started whispering to each other. Since I\u2019m someone they don\u2019t usually see it\u2019s normal for them to be suspicious.I was sipping coffee because I noticed them. After drinking it all, I have to go back to the dorm and prepare for the orientation that will be held in a week.With that in mind, I drank all the coffee and was about to get up, when a woman came and sat down at the table next to me and spoke in a voice so low that only I could hear her.\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re safe,\u201d she said. Why haven\u2019t you contacted me for two weeks?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dMy instinctive intuition stopped my head as I was about to look at her without realizing it.\u2500\u2500Chin.I naturally put the finished glass on the table.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dAre you talking to me now?I looked around. Maybe it wasn\u2019t me, but someone else, and if I reacted here, what could be more embarrassing than that? But no matter how much I look, there are no other people around.The only ones sitting at the outdoor table were me and the woman at the table next to me.That means that this person is talking to me now. How should I respond?As I continued to remain silent, she continued.\u201cI was worried about whether there was something wrong with you. Other members are also wondering what happened to the First Order.\u201d\u201c\u2026 \u2026 .\u201dMember.First Order.Someone who cares about me.* * *\u2018What.\u2019I fiddled with the handle of the coffee cup in my hand.I was just drinking coffee enjoying the wind at an outdoor table in a cafe, but suddenly a strange woman came up and talked to me.However, the words she said to me are very serious. She said the other members are wondering what happened to me.\u2014No. Not me, but a person named Rudger Chelici.The moment I judged the situation, my mouth moved naturally as if it had been greased.\u201cThere were a few things to check.\u201d\u201cIs it about this terrorist attack? It was just an accident. After all, no one knew that the rebels would attack the train on which First Order-sama was on.\u201d\u201cEverything else. Rough information about Theon.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you have the information you received in advance?\u201d\u201cThat alone is not enough. There is a big difference between hearing and seeing.\u201d\u201cYeah, that\u2019s right.\u201dThe woman nodded her head as if she understood something.\u201cDid you do well?\u201d\u201cYes, of course. Completed all Assassinations of Academy Members before entering here. Most of them were users.\u201dWhat? Assassinate the Academy Members?My body almost shook but I managed to hold it in.\u201cAnd in the meanwhile, a traitor in the organization was discovered and we dealt with him as well.\u201dWhat? Traitor? Dealt with him?Unknowingly, I swallowed my saliva at the word traitor.I asked without showing my embarrassment.\u201cHow did you do it?\u201d\u201cI pulled out a limb, grinded it, and stuffed it into his mouth. The rest of the body was said to have been fed to wild dogs. I haven\u2019t seen it myself, but I\u2019ve heard of it from other members. It could be said that it was a death worthy of a traitor.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dThey were crazier than I thought but the more I was in this situation, the calmer my mind became.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I should have listened and reported\u2026\u2026!\u201d\u201cWhy did you suddenly come to me now?\u201d\u201cFirst order came in here, but there hasn\u2019t been any news for the past fortnight\u2026\u201d\u201cSo, at this crucial moment right now?\u201dI analyzed as I spoke.They called me First Order, not Rudger. Looking at the First in front of the name, there is a high possibility that it is a fairly high position within the organization.I believed in that and tried to brag a little, and I think that was the correct answer.\u201cSorry!\u201dI responded with a cold voice to the woman who seemed to be bowing her head straight toward this side.\u201cBe quiet. Do you want to win the suspicion of those around you?\u201d\u201cSorry\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t even say you\u2019re sorry.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cOkay. Anyway, it\u2019s time to check it out. How many members are here now?\u201d\u201cYes Yes?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s about how many members are in here.\u201d\u201cAh!\u201dShe looked around as much as she could and lowered her voice.\u201cCurrently, 31 people from the 3rd order and 7 people from the 2nd order have succeeded in hiding. And the other First Order-nim came in first as planned and took a seat.\u201d\u201cHmm. That\u2019s right.\u201dWhile nodding my head formally, I put together as much information as possible.What I barely noticed was that there was one other person named First Order besides me, and that there were almost 40 of them.Although the scale is not large, their ability is unusual if it is enough to plant this number of people in Theon. The fortunate thing is that this woman in front of me doesn\u2019t even question my identity. Rather, she sends awe-inspiring gazes of fear and respect at the same time.\u201cChecking is over, so I\u2019ll leave now.\u201d\u201cAh! After that, you can come to the designated place if you want to connect.\u201dMeeting place? Was there such a place?But there\u2019s no way I would be able to ask questions like, \u2018Where is it?\u2019As I was thinking about how to do this, a good idea came to my mind.\u201cCome? Are you telling me what to do?\u201dAs I deliberately lowered my voice and sent a cold gaze, I could see her complexion turning pale.Whether this bluff had been paid off, she desperately made excuses while shaking her body like a baby squirrel.\u201cIt is not. I, I just\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t like to hear excuses. If a meeting is necessary in the future it will be here. The same is true of place and time. Do you understand?\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d\u201cIf it is necessary to go, I will only allow it if a First Order like me or someone higher than calls it.\u201d\u201cHigher than you? Would it be Zero Order-sama?\u201dSo there is a Zero Order.\u201cDon\u2019t bother me with trivial matters other than his words. Do you understand? This is a warning.\u201dI said that and got up from my seat.I was about to leave without looking back, but she called me from behind and said, \u201cThere.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThat, that\u2026\u2026What will we do when you call us?\u201dThe moment I heard those words, I felt like shit.Come to think of it, I didn\u2019t explain it. But I can\u2019t possibly explain to you something I don\u2019t know.\u201c\u2026\u2026Do I have to say that with my mouth?\u201d\u201cOh no!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to let it pass this time.\u201dWith those words, I quickly left.* * *\u2018Thump thump!\u2019Upon returning home, I hurriedly went up to the bedroom on the second floor and took out the suitcase I had put in the closet.After scattering the letters in Rudger\u2019s suitcase on the bed and checking them one by one, I realized that my anxious imagination had finally become a reality.\u201c\u2026\u2026Haaa, damn it.\u201dThe strange sense of alienation I felt while reading the letters.Why did he have to exchange these formal words with an acquaintance who has not family?Why did a man with such a splendid record restrained his private life to such an extent that it was close to nothing?All those questions were finally answered.-In the first place, this was no ordinary letter.I scanned the special characters of a specific word written inside the letter. The heterogeneity that I instinctively felt was in a certain pattern of these characters.\u2018Okay.\u2019This was the \u2018password\u2019. Their own passphrase they use so they don\u2019t get caught by others.Throwing away the letters, I re-read the documents proving my identity.\u2018Fallen Nobility? No family? From a foreign country that is very far from the empire?\u2019All of that is fake.\u2018Then, the true identity of the Rudger I met on the train\u2026\u2026.\u2019A member of the secret society hidden in the Theon Academy, even an executive with the title of First Order and now, I\u2019m wearing that guy\u2019s mask.My legs got soft and I flopped down on the bed.\u201cCrazy.\u201dThis identity of Rudger Chelici, which I thought was ideal for starting a new life\u2026\u2026In fact, a nuclear bomb was more dangerous than anything else.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I didn\u2019t have the strength to do anything right awayAt this point, I felt a sense of shame.No, how the hell does a secret society executive get caught up in a train attack and die?A secret society executive who planted nearly 40 spies in Theon Academy should have survived that situation!\u201cSigh.\u201dEven if I get angry like this, the dead won\u2019t come back. All of this is just pointless consumption of emotions.I\u2019m now Rudger Chelici, and I have to hold on to this damn status for two years.\u2018Honestly, I thought that it would be okay if only the Academy didn\u2019t find out, and that\u2019s difficult enough.\u2019Still, having experience, I thought that I could plausibly pretend to be a teacher. Because I also know how to use magic, and there is no shortage of theoretical knowledge.The fact that I could spend two years without problems was not arrogance, but a conviction made up of thorough calculations. But now I became an executive in a secret association and they\u2019re very dangerous.Assassination of some members of the academy, dealing with traitors, their methods are quite cruel. Even the gangsters and mafia on Earth don\u2019t do this and that\u2019s enough to show they are a radical group.The situation just went from normal mode to hell mode.\u201cLet\u2019s think.\u201dNow I have one more thing to deal with thanks to this fake identity.The Academy and an unknown secret society, if either of these groups find out that I\u2019m not Rudger, I\u2019ll die.Whether at the hands of the Chancellor, or by the laws of the Empire, or by the secret society\u2019s own purges.Now death is closer to me than it was in any other moment.\u201cI have to think.\u201dRudger Chelici is an executive of the secret society. The name Rudger was also created, so it\u2019s a pseudonym, but anyway, he\u2019s in a position called First Order.Among the secret society members that permeated the academy, the First Orders were alone, including me. I don\u2019t need to know right away what their purpose is.What matters is who the other First Orders are. I couldn\u2019t ask about it openly, so there was no way to know right away unless they made contact with me.\u2018For now, I can ignore the second and third orders.\u2019It is presumed that the real Rudger had a very eccentric personality within the organization. Even though I only changed my voice a little, it was a fact that could be inferred from the expression on his subordinate\u2019s contemplative expression.His personality is bad, so his subordinates wouldn\u2019t want to deal with him for too long. That is welcome on my part.In the end, I only had to care about other First Orders. Who the hell are they?\u2018I can\u2019t ask. I don\u2019t know how the executives recognize other executives. If I do that, I will immediately be suspicious.\u2019Now, I had to deal with not only the Academy and the Empire, but also the secret societies that were secretly hiding within the Empire.I thought I was riding on the back of only one tiger, but I was riding on the back of two. The moment when either side goes wrong, it\u2019s over.\u2018Okay. After all, since this has happened, I have no choice but to do it.\u2019I immediately took out the books from the suitcase and opened the letter next to it.\u2018Getting information comes first.\u2019This letter must be the password used by their organization, it was necessary to interpret it.A certain pattern exists in all passwords and the one that can analyze the pattern is this book in the bag.\u2018I\u2019m a teacher at the Magic Academy, so no magic books. Other than that, there were a few unusual books.\u2019I looked through the books.[Watcher of the Rye] [Ringerk\u2019s Philosophy] [Traces of Totalitarianism] [A Hundred Years of Solitude], novels, autobiographies, non-fiction and bestsellers. Among them, there was one book that stood out to me.[Gentleman\u2019s Culture]\u2018This is it.\u2019I remembered Rudger on the train, his actions, how he shacked his legs slightly or waved his hands. If the man had really seriously considered the culture of a gentleman and had read this book, he wouldn\u2019t have behaved like that.\u2018This book was the most touched.\u2019A part of the cover was worn and deteriorated. It appears like he reads a lot, but is there really a reason for that?\u2018This book was being used as an interpretation of the password.\u2019I opened the book of [A Gentleman\u2019s Culture] and turned the page. The irregularity hidden slowly caught my eye. Traces of burns can be seen in the book. Some pages were not read, and some pages were read until the paper ran out.Looking carefully at the particular worn-out page, I could see something between the letters. I immediately took the letter and compared them.\u2018It is said that the continent uses a unified language, but each country has a slightly different language.\u2019Since the traces of Rudger Chelici originated from the Queoden Kingdom, I can think of the Queoden language. In particular, the letter explicitly contained traces of some proper nouns or dialects used in the Kingdom of Queoden.Although it is a small and barren kingdom in the north, Queoden, which has produced quite a number of great writers, has only about 20,000 words used in that dialect, of which 8,000 are advanced vocabulary.Obviously this is the point of the password.It\u2019s not difficult to tell the code apart, considering the arrangement of the language and the connection with the letters because I know Queoden.\u2018Also.\u2019My prediction was correct. When I checked the code in Queoden, I saw connections between words and letters.<Greetings> <Goodbye> <Farewell Party> <New Meeting> <Crow> <Eyes> <Starlight> etc.Next to them, some words that symbolize numbers were mixed together.The number probably represents the page of this codebook, and if I interpret it by combining other words\u2026.\u2018First Order, infiltrate Theon Academy as a teacher and win their favor. After that, I will pass on the next order while monitoring the situation.\u2019I couldn\u2019t get any conclusive information, but this was enough.I closed the book [A Gentleman\u2019s Culture] and tilted my head back.\u201cWhoa.\u201d2 years left. I had to live as an academy teacher and as a secret society executive.Of course, I couldn\u2019t live like that forever. Even after spending two years as a teacher safely, the issue of the secret society remains.Their presence was very annoying to me. If I make a mistake in the middle, I have the highest chance of getting killed.\u2018But I can\u2019t get rid of the secret society by myself. I don\u2019t know how the organization is structured, but it was enough to plant spies in Theon Academy. They must be pretty dangerous.\u2019It is impossible to deal with them personally.But let\u2019s leave it alone for now, this secret society is a shackle holding my ankles, and I had to erase it.But how?\u2018I must use the power of the academy.\u2019There is a saying \u2018Deal with barbarians to subdue barbarians.\u2019Theon Academy is not just a school. It is a place that symbolizes the future, nurturing the future of the empire.Despite the name \u2018academy\u2019, it is not impossible because it is a place with enormous power to affect any country.If Theon and the secret society face off against each other, no matter how great the secret society is, they will have no choice but to be pushed back.How many soldiers and wizards are there? Even within the Imperial Territory, there is a possibility that the Templar Knights will move. They know that too, so they planted spies instead of choosing to break through head-on.In other words, I had to carefully dig up their information so as not to be caught by the secret society, and then leak that information to the academy.\u2018Of course if I take too long I might die in the process.\u2019The secret society could purge me because I betrayed them, and conversely, the academy could suspect me as a spy and exclude me. In the end, it was important to maintain a certain rhythm.The moment I lean to one side, the only thing waiting for me is ruin.\u2018For now\u2026\u2026Let\u2019s start with the first class in a week.\u2019There was no specific instruction but buying favor is to imprint my image clearly as a teacher. If so, first of all, fulfilling my duty as a teacher is a priority.Since Theon is a place where smart students attend, if I show a lack of appearance even a little, I may be bitten by them.At the age of growing up, talented children usually think that they are the best, and even ignore their teachers.I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like here, but I\u2019ve come to realize through long experience that people are the same no matter the place.\u2018\u2026\u2026There are so many things to consider.\u2019Don\u2019t look silly to students, don\u2019t get suspected by the academy and don\u2019t get caught by the secret society guys.I was wondering what the hell I was supposed to do, but if I endure all of this, I will obtain a great reward. For that I\u2019ll have to endure for now.I got up from bed and went into my personal study room and opened a magic textbook.I had to come up with a plan for the future and prepare how to proceed with the class.There are 2 years left, I couldn\u2019t just play.* * *The first day of school has arrived.The students who went to their hometowns during the vacation are returning one by one, and with the new semester, this year\u2019s freshmen also arrived.The students who were in the first year went up to the second year and crossed the school gate with their hearts full of anticipation of what new classes they could take in the future.From all corners of the classroom, students met friends they hadn\u2019t seen in months and greeted each other warmly. However, although all of them are attending the same academy, not everyone is the same.There are noisy students and quiet students. Naturally, the atmosphere was divided among the students, of course, their status in society was also determined.Inside Theon Academy, students are divided into three classes.The upper class, led by royalty, nobles, and high-ranking priests, middle class led by wealthy merchants and finally, the lower class occupied by the poor commoners.Even if they were studying at the same academy, they could not ignore their status, and as a result, they built walls without realizing it and divided the classes inside the academy.The nobles smiled brightly and greeted each other, while the commoners, on the other hand, often looked at each other or gathered quietly among themselves.\u201cDid you hear the news?\u201d\u201cWhat news?\u201d\u201cThere is a class on the theory of the manifestation system and the understanding of elements? Are you saying that the new teacher is doing it?\u201d\u201cThe new teacher is not teaching the first year, but the second year? Does he have any skills?\u201d\u201cHe can\u2019t help it, his predecessor went out. When I heard the news, I heard that his past record was splendid? It\u2019s said that he also wrote a lot of theses while in the military.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t he a great person then?\u201d\u201cBut you know what?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThat person is a fallen aristocrat.\u201dAt the word \u201cfallen aristocrat\u201d, a laugh naturally crept into the lips of the person that was leading the conversation.Fallen nobles were usually treated worse than wealthy merchants among nobles.Since he was appointed as a Theon teacher, he had some talent, but to the upper-class students, he was looking ridiculous.At the same time, the aristocratic students had similar thoughts. If the new teacher is a fallen aristocrat then earning credits in his class will be a breeze.The moment they talked about what kind of person he was, the front door of the classroom opened silently.All eyes turned to the front door, there was a man entering the classroom through the open door.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Even when the classroom door closes, when the footsteps of the shoes go up the pulpit, and when he puts documents on the desk, there is no sound.That silence engulfed the entire classroom like ripples on the water.\u201cHuh\u2026\u2026\u201dEven the aristocratic students who continued to talk were swept away by the atmosphere and kept their mouths shut.The students, who had been quiet, turned their eyes to the main character standing on the podium, their eyes shining with curiosity.The suit commensurate with his stature did not have any wrinkles. On top of that, a black frock coat that fits snugly on the body is added. A stylish, yet not overdone attire.As the man took off the hat on his head and threw it lightly, it flew gently toward the hanger in the corner of the class and landed. In the midst of a series of movements that were so natural, his appearance hidden behind a hat was revealed.A sharp jawline, straight nose and unshakable eyes. His strong, yet charismatic eyes were sharpened to the point that he could hardly be seen as a new teacher. His long hair for a man was tied neatly around the nape of his neck.\u201cGulp.\u201dSome aristocratic students who were secretly gossiping were crushed by the momentum and swallowed their saliva without realizing it.\u201cNice to meet you. My name is Rudger Chelici, and I\u2019m your new teacher.\u201dThe moment he opened his mouth and made a sound was as if water was poured on watercolors scattered dreamily. The atmosphere of the classroom, which had been immersed in stillness, returned to reality.* * *\u201cIt\u2019s the first day of class, so I won\u2019t start teaching right away.\u201dI slowly hung the frock coat I had taken off on the hanger.It wasn\u2019t difficult to keep the conversation going. It was enough to just recite the words that came to mind in advance at the right time.This is a kind of play.I am the actor on the stage, and the students are the audience. I just have to keep the monologue naturally in line with the breath, following the flow.Because the script is all in my head.\u201cMy class is theory of the manifestation but there will be no teaching purely on the manifestation system. Rather than that, we will focus on applying the principles to real life beyond the practical ones.\u201dTaking a quick glance at the crowd, I saw a few people shrugging their shoulders.That\u2019s a good response.Since Rudger was a soldier there was no student who looked strangely at me, even though I maintained such a tone and intense eyes.\u201cIt is possible to apply for my class not only in the second year, but also in the first year. In other words, it can be viewed as a joint class for the first and second graders.\u201dAll the students gathered now were in their second year, so it was just embarrassing. However, there is no school rule stating that classes should be unconditionally divided by grade level, so it was not impossible.The moment the noise gradually subsided, I opened my mouth at the most appropriate time.\u201cStop.\u201dIn an instant, the noise inside the classroom disappeared.Everyone\u2019s eyes turn in this direction again.\u201cIt is natural to feel dissatisfied with the fact that as second year students you\u2019ll have to attend the same classes as the first year students but don\u2019t worry. Considering the first graders, I will not teach the obvious things that even beginners can learn.\u201dA response filled with relief flows from all over the place.Theon Academy\u2019s teaching method is more like a university than a high school in terms of earth. However, since it is not completely a university, it can be seen that the mixture is a little vague.Theon students choose the lectures they want to take according to their specialties, and receive credits by completing the subjects.\u2018There\u2019s no big difference between the first and second year students.\u2019With that in mind, I decided to conduct a joint class between the first and second graders.Why?When only second graders get together, inevitably, the story of the teacher comes up. The curiosity and main target of second-year students who have known each other enough for a year will be the new teacher, not a classmate in the same grade.But what if a freshman is in the same classroom? The attention of the second graders is dispersed to the juniors in the first grade.Then there will be significantly fewer cases of people talking about me.The existence of the first-year students is a kind of smoke screen that keeps the second graders from doubting my qualifications as a teacher.\u201cWhy do you let first-year students attend classes?\u201dSomeone raised a hand and said,When I looked, it was a girl with wavy blonde hair that reached her waist. Her unshakable eyes that are facing this way have a strong sense of certainty.Her face is familiar\u2026.Where have I seen that face before?\u2018The kind of person who is reluctant to think of something\u2026\u2026.\u2019Once the question was asked, I decided to answer it.\u201cBecause I thought they needed a chance too.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean by chance?\u201d\u201cI think it is very unfortunate that I have to take my classes only for a certain grade, that\u2019s absolutely the wrong attitude as an educator. To provide equal teaching to all regardless of grade level, that is my opinion.\u201dWell, they\u2019re going to ask me why I didn\u2019t mention the 3rd graders.Of course, they can also take my classes if they want. However, it will be difficult for 3rd graders to digest the essential subjects they are learning right now.In fact, it would be up to 2nd year if I could afford it.\u201cOf course, that means that the classes I teach do not depend on the grade level.\u201dWell, it\u2019s not like I\u2019m just saying things without thinking because I made sure I was prepared for class.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to understand if you don\u2019t explain exactly what the class is.\u201d\u201cIf you are curious, you can come to my class. It\u2019s not fun to tell in advance.\u201dA small wrinkle appeared on the forehead of the blonde girl. I\u2019m sorry, but I have no intention of telling you what I will teach right now. Rather, it was meant to make you more anxious and curious.There is nothing that students attending the academy are wary of as much as an unknown class.\u201cJust one warning. If there is someone who wants to take my class with the stupid idea that I am a new teacher and that they can easily get credits.\u201dAfter deliberately adjusting my breathing and inhaling I spit out the last words strongly.\u201cAt that time, I will carve into their bones what real education is.\u201dThe last sentence means \u2018please don\u2019t come to my class.\u2019If they had to take a class with the first years, their pride would be quite hurt. I even warned them that the class will not be easy. There was a great chance that the students would not attend.If a landmine was thrown openly like this, and it explodes after being stepped on, it is the fault of the person who stepped on it.\u2018Everything is there for a reason. You\u2019ll find out when you go to class.\u2019\u201cAny questions?\u201dI asked the students.* * *The classroom was quiet.When Rudger asked if they had any questions, none of the students raised their hands.It\u2019s not that there aren\u2019t any questions. I also liked the trivial questions about how the assignments were going to be done, what the exact curriculum was for the class, or what was taught before but no one said anything.Everyone was overwhelmed by the spirit of Rudger Chelici.\u2018Is that the new teacher?\u2019\u2018I heard that he came from the military, so the atmosphere is not a joke.\u2019\u2018There was a saying that he was at least a fourth rank. Is it true?\u2019Even the noble students who ignored their opponents as the fallen nobles avoided Rudger\u2019s gaze and swallowed only dry saliva.The upper class, however, couldn\u2019t possibly have the other students dare to step forward. Everyone felt it implicitly as they listened to Rudger\u2019s words.That man never uttered everything in vain.Unless a person is genuinely proud of their class, they can never show such a reaction.What the hell are you trying to teach? If it is not bound by theory, is it practical? If so, how is it in practice?In everyone\u2019s head, only those complicated thoughts popped up and disappeared like bubbles over and over again.But one thing is certain, the class led by the teacher named Rudger Chelici is never going to be easy.\u201cAny questions?\u201dHis voice asked again. It was like that of a person who wanted to ask a question, but the students were not deceived.The moment you raise his hand here and open your mouth, you will immediately be caught by Rudger.Looking at those staring eyes that seem to eat them the will to never allow questions is conveyed.The blonde girl who first raised her hand was now still.\u201cNo. Then the opening ceremony will end with this.\u201dThe breathtaking orientation ended just like that.* * *When the orientation was over, the students got up one by one and left the classroom.I watched the scene carefully from the platform. Once I said everything I wanted to say, I guess they understood everything, right? But honestly, I was shocked that no one raised their hand when I asked them if they had questions.Up until the night before right now, I was prepared to receive all kinds of questions and prepared answers for them, but all of them are useless.Aren\u2019t academies like this usually all about children with strong egos? I thought they would make fun of me and pour out questions, did I overthink it?\u2018No. Wait a minute.\u2019It could be the other way around. What if they were intentionally chewing on my words? Isn\u2019t that often the case in 21st century Korea?When a new teacher arrives, the students deliberately ignore him without paying any attention. This is especially the case with female teachers.\u2018Well.\u2019I said it as seriously as I could on purpose to be scary, but did that have the opposite effect? Perhaps these coercive tones and actions touched the self-esteem of students who considered themselves geniuses.\u2018Then it\u2019s a bit of a big deal.\u2019In the military, the successor is the senior, in the workplace the lieutenant is the gunner, in the school the student ignores the teacher.It is self-evident that if I lose control of the atmosphere at the beginning, it will cause setbacks for future classes. If so, should I treat the students with a friendlier attitude?\u2018No, if I suddenly change now things will become strange. I just have to push through to the end.\u2019Being friendly and smiling for nothing is actually not my temperament, it\u2019s my nature, and most of the roles I\u2019ve been acting with have been like this.Besides, it\u2019s been three weeks since I\u2019ve been here and everyone already knows who Rudger is.Meanwhile, the remaining students in the classroom did not come to me. It\u2019s not that they\u2019re not interested, because I clearly felt their gaze.Still, I thought they would ask me some clich\u00e9 questions like how old you are or if you have a girlfriend, but I didn\u2019t know that they wouldn\u2019t open their mouths.Kids these days are scary.* * *\u201cThump. Thump.\u201dI left the classroom at a leisurely pace and walked slowly down the hallway. It was the first day of school anyway, so this was the end of today\u2019s work.Since the course registration correction period is not over yet, the students still have time to decide the classes they want to attend.The first class in earnest is 3 days later. Until then, let\u2019s think seriously about how I can take the lead in the class from the students.At least I should avoid being told that I\u2019m not qualified as a teacher. Thinking like that, I checked the front, and saw all the students walking down the hallway looking at me and clearing the way.Boys and girls alike, when they see me walking, they are startled and stick to the wall or window.\u2018What. Why?\u2019Could it be that the rumors of a new teacher, who seem bubbly, have already spread throughout the academy?I heard that there is a community like the university community \u2018Everytime\u2019 where the students can exchange opinions with each other inside the academy, is that because of that?Just when I thought that the next class would be quite difficult, someone spoke to me.\u201cHello.\u201dI stopped and stared at the woman speaking and smiling towards me.\u201cYou are the new teacher Mr. Rudger Chelici?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dShe was a charming pink haired woman with slightly wavy ends and a warm smile like a sheep. She\u2019s not wearing a uniform, so I don\u2019t think she\u2019s a student.Perhaps?Before I could say anything, she spoke again.\u201cNice to meet you. My name is Selina, I\u2019m also a new teacher at Theon Academy just like Mr. Rudger.\u201d\u201cOkay. Nice to meet you.\u201dWhen I glanced at her as to what she had come for, Selina looked into my eyes, a little perplexed, she spoke quietly in a crawling voice.\u201cThat\u2026\u2026Have you eaten?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In fact, when I followed Selina, there were three other people besides me, two men and one woman.They all look unique as if shouting, \u201cI am a wizard.\u201d\u201cHello.\u201dThe first person to reach out and shake my hand was a very warm-hearted man. He seems to be quite aged but he smiled haphazardly like the friendly man next door.I shook his hand lightly\u201cRudger Chelici, I am in charge of the manifestation system.\u201d\u201cBryno, I am in charge of golem summoning.\u201dThe next person who spoke to me was a bewitching beauty with long purple hair that covered one eye.\u201cYou are a handsome man, nice to meet you. My name is Merylda, I\u2019m in charge of charms and hallucinations.\u201d\u201cYes. Nice to meet you.\u201dThe last one left felt a little different from the previous two. He was a man with dark blue hair all-white and rimless glasses on his face, and his appearance alone looked quite strict. He had a frown on his face all the time, as if he wasn\u2019t very happy with the fact that he was here with us.When I looked at him, he looked at me, and then he turned his head. It was an expression of his will not to even introduce himself.As I was puzzled, Merylda laughed and explained in a low voice.\u201cMister Chris Benimore. As you can see, he\u2019s a nobleman, different from commoners like us.\u201dAh. So that was it.For Chris, even if he\u2019s an academy teacher, he probably doesn\u2019t want to be friendly with commoners. In my case, I am a fallen aristocrat, so it is natural for him to look down on me.\u201cIsn\u2019t Mr. Rudger going to ignore us because we are just commoners?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201dWhen I answered Merylda opened her eyes wide, and then withdrew with a soft smile.Hmm. After all, there are five new teachers, including myself. One noble, one fallen noble, and three commoners. However, since they became teachers at the Theon Academy, they must be talented people who went far in the field they teach.\u201cI can\u2019t stay here any longer. The newly appointed teachers besides me, are commoners and fallen nobles.\u201dChris\u2019s cold voice rang out. Bryno smiled awkwardly at those words, and Selina flinched, while Meryl glanced at Chris with a sullen face.Me? I don\u2019t care.It\u2019s hard for nobles to get used to mingling with commoners in only a day or two. As I was showing an attitude saying, \u2018If you\u2019re going to just go, go on your own,\u2019 Chris looked at me sharply.\u201cDon\u2019t be pretentious.\u201dYou wanted to leave, why are you looking at me like this? Were you originally acquainted with Rudger? It doesn\u2019t seem like it at all.\u2018It would be nice to be friendly with fellow teachers, but I think it would be difficult to get close to him.\u2019I ignored Chris and looked at the other three. Maybe there is a spy planted in the secret society among them.\u2018Is there a first order among these three?\u2019Currently, nearly 40 members of the Secret Order are hiding inside Theon Academy. Of course, considering the total population of Theon Academy with it\u2019s large size, 40 is an insignificant number, but that does not mean that there is no chance that I will not run into the other members along the way.Except for the Third Orders, some of the Second Orders may have infiltrated as students. In particular, in the case of the First Order, teachers cannot escape suspicion.\u2018Rudger took the position of a teacher and he\u2019s a First Order. There\u2019s no way other First Orders wouldn\u2019t do that.\u2019The question is who.Since they\u2019re new teachers like me it narrows down the range. Of course, I had no choice but to be suspicious of those who asked me to eat because they might be trying to trick me.I have to be vigilant. I struggled to keep my expressionless face and followed my fellow teachers to the dining room. Still, I don\u2019t eat alone, so I\u2019m holding on to the idea that it\u2019s not bad.* * *Selina, the new Elemental Teacher. She recently joined Theon Academy and teaches spirit summoning. She couldn\u2019t help but be quite nervous when she arrived.Theon Academy is well known in other kingdoms beyond the Empire. The students who enter here are geniuses who will take important positions in the future. It came as a great burden to her to teach such children.\u2018What if I make a mistake? What if I can\u2019t teach? Besides, there are many noble children here!\u2019There is a big difference between commoners and nobles.Thanks to the advancement in magic engineering, the world has gradually changed, and the common people have become members of the House of Representatives and intervened in politics. However, the wall of status was still high.The reason why there were 5 teacher positions this time was because the teachers who were in charge of the class until last year had retired and the reason why is unknown.Before coming here, her wizard acquaintances warned her about the territoriality of noble students. There are students who secretly look down on their teachers and try to win over them.Selina was terrified.\u2018It is said that even royal family members attend this school.\u2019It was mentioned that the third princess is a sophomore. She\u2019s in charge of her first year, so she won\u2019t be related right away. It seems that the orientation on the first day of class went smoothly, but it is also true that she is still anxious due to low self-esteem.Selina didn\u2019t want to be like this, so she decided to make friends with the other new teachers, like herself. If she had colleagues she could share hard work with, life at the academy might be better.She then became friends with Merylda and after calling people one by one, she went to find the last one left, Rudger Chelici.A man of noble origin, not a commoner, however, since his family had fallen, he was not a burdensome person to approach. Until she met him, she certainly thought so.\u2018Wow.\u2019At first, she wondered what was going on as the crowd in the hallway split left and right. Could it be that the imperial family, who she had only heard of, came?It was a man in a well-groomed outfit that broke her expectations and slowly went her way. Gray suit, black frock coat and a silk hat on his head.\u2018Wow, my God.\u2019When she first met Rudger, Selina\u2019s feelings were the highest of admiration.She was told that he was a fallen aristocrat but as she watched him, Selina was forced to correct her own narrow thinking.Slowly walking, scattering his majesty around him, he seemed far nobler than any noble she had ever seen. Every step he took was like a painting, so she stared blankly without realizing it. Selina recalled her purpose for her belated visit to her Rudger, and she hurriedly went to him.\u2018I\u2019m scared.\u2019As he paused and turned around, it felt like her heart was dropping. Still, Selina grinned as she struggled with her smile, and cautiously told Rudger that she would like to eat with him.It seemed that Rudger would immediately look at her with contempt and say something unpleasant.\u201cSure.\u201dBut Rudger accepted her offer with all too much ease. As she walked in her path, he matched her stride and kept his distance from her. His consideration for others was felt in his every little action.\u2018You have a very warm personality unlike how you look.\u2019Even when introducing him to other colleagues, Rudger didn\u2019t care whether they were a noble or a commoner. Although Mr. Chris Benimore showed an openly hostile attitude towards him, Rudger did not respond much.He is usually irritable but he never loses his nobility. It was as if he was alone standing on a cloud in the sky. As I heard later, it is said that he was a former military officer and a great man who even submitted several academic papers to the Tower.\u2018Mr. Rudger is a wonderful person.\u2019She also wanted to become a teacher with such charisma. Even when eating, Rudger simply ate quietly without saying a word.His posture in handling forks and knives was restrained as if he was living in a different world by himself, even the passing students were glancing at him.In fact, he acts as if it is natural or as if he doesn\u2019t care about the reactions of those around him. Rudger\u2019s attitude was the same even when we greeted each other after dinner and dispersed to our private dormitories or teachers\u2019 buildings.When everyone waved to see you later, Rudger greeted me with a nod of his head.Selina, returning home with Merylda, remembering her brief meeting with Rudger today. She tried to make her face deliberately expressionless as she inhaled deeply. Merylda, who was walking by her side, noticed her behavior and asked.\u201cSelina. What are you doing?\u201d\u201cMerylda, doesn\u2019t it make me look a little older?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dMerylda burst into laughter as she tried to ask what that meant.\u201cAhaha! Selina, are you pretending to be Mr. Rudger now?\u201d\u201cYes? Oh no, that\u2019s not it\u2026\u2026\u201dMerylda waved her hand to Selina, who was spurring gibberish in embarrassment, saying it was okay.Mr. Rudger is so unique that it is hard to believe that he is a new teacher like us. But considering that person\u2019s past, it was worth it.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t know? I checked out who all the people who came in this time were and he was a military officer.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s even more amazing is that Selina, you, me and the others came here with a tower or an elemental society on their backs and got recommendations. That man didn\u2019t. He didn\u2019t belong anywhere, but he came in on his own.\u201d\u201cWow. No wonder.\u201d\u201cThe teaching method of such a person must be great. Still, we have no choice but to teach our students our way. Don\u2019t be too swayed by others. It\u2019s okay if you don\u2019t pretend to be strong for nothing, because we also became teachers at Theon.\u201d\u201cAh yes!\u201dThe two met for the first time today, but quickly became close friends, chatting warmly and heading to the teacher\u2019s dormitory.* * *Three days have passed since the orientation on the first day of class.Since these three days are the course correction period, it must have been quite a busy time for students who have not yet made a choice about which lectures to take. Of course, that didn\u2019t matter to me.The long-awaited first class came and I crossed the hallway with excited footsteps.Three days ago I gave enough warnings.My class is like a landmine.Rumors about me must have already spread widely among the students. Having said that, I wonder if there are any students who want to take my class?There will be some. When the other classes are full they will have no choice but to choose with tears in their eyes in order to forcibly complete their credits.The important thing is that the fewer students I teach, the more comfortable I am.Classes can have a minimum of 15 and a maximum of 80 students. Lectures are not closed because there are few people, so if there are fewer people, it is enough to lead them well.Of course, there is no possibility of a minimum of 15 people, so I can compromise with 30 people in moderation. With that thought, I opened the door and entered the classroom.\u2018What?\u2019I saw students filling the inside of the classroom. That number was more than double the 30 people I had thought of. No, it was actually the maximum number of people the classroom could accommodate.Why are there so many?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 12": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Academy\u2019s Undercover ProfessorCH 12Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayC12: First Class (2)Only 2 chapters today but I\u2019ll try to post more tomorrow.About 3 days before, the first day of orientation. When Rudger showed the guts to keep his teaching methods secret, the reaction among his students was not so good.A number of students resented the fact that the new teacher, even a man from the Fallen Nobility, showed such behavior at the Theon Academy. In particular, students from aristocratic backgrounds were the angriest.But, ironically, the students who actually witnessed Rudger\u2019s orientation didn\u2019t say much. Only some high-respecting noble students seemed to have been ignored for nothing, but out of the 50 or so students in the classroom that day, nearly 40 admired Rudger\u2019s guts.He became a teacher at Theon Academy, so wouldn\u2019t there be something to believe in?Of course, as no detailed information about Rudger was yet known, students had no choice but to be cautious. On the first day of his class, it was a very self-evident fact that they would suffer for a semester if they took the wrong class.If even a little bit of information about Rudger was released, it would increase the students\u2019 trust and they would take his class once.The second morning of the second day when many students were worried a single article was posted on the community called <Akashic Records>, the student-only magic exchange book of the Theon Academy.Title: Did you hear about the new teacher, Rudger Chelici?A title that was intentionally created to grab people\u2019s attention, whether it\u2019s good or bad. Naturally, the students had no choice but to click on it, and the contents unfolded as if waiting.An extreme tribute to Rudger Chelici.The youngest fourth rank, military officer appointment, Cryptid Hunting Contributions. As a freelance mage, he also made a name for himself in the Tower of Magic.It contained past deeds of Rudger.For students who did not know that it was a desperate undercover operation of a secret society to somehow lift the First Order, it was enough to raise their expectations.In particular, the person with the most enthusiasm and sincerity was the Third Order member who was the first to contact Rudger.\u2018No one can\u2019t ruin First Order-sama\u2019s class! I have to get as many students as possible to hear it!\u2019She\u2019s been writing all day about just how cool, amazing he is.Perhaps because of the two days of persistently posting praises about Rudger and drawing attention, more people are interested in Rudger\u2019s classes than those who reacted with excessive praise.In particular, the fact that they were able to attend classes together with the older students stimulated the interest of newbies who did not know anything yet.During the correction period, the number of students who wanted to attend Rudger\u2019s class increased dramatically, and the maximum capacity of 80 students was filled with excitement.And the long-awaited first day of class.All the students sat down and waited for Rudger with anticipation, half of it out of pure curiosity, and half out of a desire to see where and how well he can teach.When the class started at 9 am the classroom door opened and Rudger entered.* * *What the hell is this situation?The classroom was full with no empty seats. The maximum number of people thought to be about 30 at most achieved the maximum.With 80 students ahead of me, I felt a headache.Why? Surely I must have subtly issued a warning that my class was a landmine at orientation three days ago?Above all, the students whose uniforms have blue badges are freshly enrolled first-year students and they accounted for more than 60% of the number of students gathered in the classroom.\u2018Why are the first graders again?\u2019Shouldn\u2019t first graders avoid taking classes with the seniors since it\u2019s burdensome?I never expected that there would be so many first year students. At this point, it makes me wonder if someone intentionally spread malicious information about me somewhere.\u2018Maybe I\u2019ve been looking down on the students too much.\u2019Of course, the Theon Academy is a place where only carefully selected students can enter after a fierce competition. It is a place where children from all over the continent, beyond the Empire, gather, so it is problematic to think of them as ordinary students.I decided to humbly accept my mistakes.Instead of raising students\u2019 vigilance, my actions ignited their self-esteem.Looking at their gazes I saw wild hyenas that will bite me if I ever make a mistake.It\u2019s my first class today, and I\u2019m under such pressure. If I go on like this, I will be eaten by the students in the classroom.\u2018Since this has happened, I have no choice but to do my best to conduct the lecture.\u2019I looked at the faces of the students gathered in the classroom. It is full of children, each with their own hair color. I guess that\u2019s common in this world.Some of them stood out more than others, especially the girl with the ears of an animal on her head. They are the beast people who live in the desert area of the southern continent.Well, in this world where there is magic and witches exist, the sub-races are a minority, even more so at Theon Academy.Until 50 years ago, the beast people were a race that was subjected to colonial rule and were treated like slaves, and even after 50 years, the remnants of discrimination and persecution against them still remain.Proof of this are the gazes of other students looking at the beast girl with subtle gazes. That child seems to have entered the school, but life in the future will be very difficult.\u2018Well, I\u2019m not in a position to worry about anyone right now.\u2019First of all, the progress of the class comes first.\u201cI\u2019m Rudger Chelici and I\u2019ll teach the whole process of the manifestation system.\u201d\u201cWhat about the four specializations?\u201dSomeone raised a hand and said so. He was a male student with a somewhat unlucky impression.I immediately chided him.\u201cAsk only when I allow you to.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Yes.\u201d\u201cIf there is another person who breaks the flow of my class at will, I will give a penalty point. The same is true for blatant challenges to my authority as teacher.\u201dSome students shouted in shock,\u201cBut students who do that well will be given a bonus. The higher the bonus, more benefits will be given, so work hard.\u201dIt is a well-known fact that first or second year students, when they are at their peak, do not care much about penalty points. However, there is a big difference between what a teacher warns about and what they don\u2019t.\u201cIf I had to answer the question a while ago, it would be \u2018yes\u2019. I will teach you one by one about the general aspects of <Emission>, <Elemental Attribute>, <Telekinesis>, and <Fortification>, which can be said to be the entire manifestation system.\u201dMost of what I said was unbelievable. Even within the same system, every specialization is a completely different field.The <Emission>, <Elemental Attribute>, <Telekinesis>, and <Fortification> that I mentioned a while ago are the four specializations of the [Manifestation System] that I talked about. They are often referred to as the four specializations of manifestation.Usually, it is said that it is enough to teach only two of these, but I said that I would teach a whopping four. To the students, it would sound like an unbelievable lie, as if I was bluffing.But this is by no means a lie.I did not achieve first-class in any of them, but I am proud that my overall spectrum of knowledge is quite wide as I have lived through the years.\u201cI\u2019m going to begin.\u201d* * *\u201cYou know, Cheryl. Isn\u2019t that teacher really funny?\u201dSheryl tried to hide her anxiety at the voice calling her, and turned her head to the friend sitting next to her. A girl with translucent, pure white skin, with her long indigo blue hair growing down to her waist.She was so beautiful that resembled a doll made by a craftsman with great care, and even the boys sitting next to her kept glancing at her.\u201cFlora, you again\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cExcuse me. So what have I done?\u201dCheryl couldn\u2019t keep up with Flora, who asked playfully and subtly.Flora Lumos, the daughter of Duke Lumos, one of the noblest families in the Exilion Empire.Beautiful and charming, as if she was a picture just by standing still, she was famous for the title of \u2018genius\u2019 in Theon sophomore year.Even the students who are called geniuses in the world become ordinary at Theon Academy.Theon, a group of only geniuses from all the countries of the continent, raised the standards of the students too high, and those with low talent were bound to become ordinary.It was not surprising that a child who was praised as gifted in his hometown became ordinary at Theon. \u00a0However, Flora is a girl called \u2018genius\u2019, even in Theon.She has a good family, her looks are beautiful, and her abilities are excellent, her only flaw was her character.Flora Lumos was notorious among the teachers, even inside Theon Academy. Because she was a genius, she did not want to receive proper instruction from anyone. Rather, she challenged the teacher\u2019s authority and won.It was not uncommon for her to point out the teacher\u2019s mistake in the middle of a class. On the contrary, she devised a spell on the spot that was far superior to what her teacher could teach, and she shattered the teacher in front of the students.She has steadily built up such notoriety since her freshman year, and it\u2019s still the same now that she\u2019s in her second year. In particular, the fact that two teachers in charge of the manifestation class retired last year was because of her.Flora became a sophomore, and she came back to take the manifestation class and this time it\u2019s the class of Rudger Chelici, who has been evaluated as unusual from his first appearance.Flora\u2019s friend Cheryl prayed that she wouldn\u2019t do it this time, but when she looked at Flora\u2019s expression, it seemed that her wish was nothing more than a vain hope.Flora\u2019s nickname \u201cLittle Demon\u201d was notorious among teachers because she eats away the souls of her teachers in every class she takes. Considering that people who have been beaten by her trembled so much that it was not enough to even call her the Great Demon King, let alone her Little Demon.Flora decided that her prey for this semester would be the new teacher Rudger Chelici.\u201cSheryl. Honestly, isn\u2019t it funny? He looks like he\u2019s only in his 20s, but he\u2019s teaching all four specializations of the manifestation system. To be honest, isn\u2019t it an exaggeration to teach them all?\u201d\u201cThat\u2026\u2026\u201dCheryl had no choice but to agree with that part.She didn\u2019t know if it was his pride as a new teacher, or if he really had the ability to do so.\u2018But, has he really mastered the four major specializations well enough to teach them?\u2019There are a total of 5 classes of magic, and each class has different specializations.The three specializations of the [Implementation] system are <Material Generation> <Transformation> and <Alchemy>.The four specializations of the [Manifestation] system are <Emission> <Elemental Attribute> <Flame copper> and <Fortification>.The 4 specializations of the [Summon] system are <Spirit> <Golem> <Magic Beast> and <Necromantic>.The 6 specializations of the [Curse] system are <Astrology>, <Enchantment>, <Hallucination>, <Pharmacology>, <Witchcraft>, and <Enchant>.The 5th system is called [Arcane]. It is vague to say that it is magic, but it clearly refers to a system that can be manifested through magic.Arcane magic that has been passed down from generation to generation in families or someone pioneered a unique method of their own belongs to this type of [special]. Of course, no teachers teach in this particular class.At the same time, Rudger engraved a magic formula on the magic board.When the magic was poured on the board that had nothing written on it, the formula was drawn on its own. It was [Fluttering Flame], one of the 3rd-tier flame elemental magic.\u201cOn the basis of manifestation, a total of six elements namely heating, combustion, compression, acceleration, expansion, and diffusion complement each other and form the formula.\u201dEven though it was only a 3rd tier spell, it was a magic that had to be manifested by placing six elements that make up the procedure in the right place. If time permits, even students attending this class could use it.\u201cToday is the first class, so before starting the main class, I will teach you something that will arouse your interest. It is a way to express the magic much faster than the conventional method.\u201dFor the first time, curiosity arose in the minds of the students.\u201cLet\u2019s see. Speed, yes. It can be said that it is three times faster than the existing method\u201dThe students\u2019 eyes widened at those words.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 13": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Academy\u2019s Undercover ProfessorCH 13Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayC13: First Class (3)\u201cDo you want to shorten the onset time of the procedure?\u201d\u201cIs that possible?\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you lying?\u201dUnlike the first-year students who do not know well yet, the second-year students doubted Rudger\u2019s words.Before teaching the basics in his first class, he promised to show them how to speed up the unleashing of magic. They couldn\u2019t help but doubt them.The speed of magic manifestation is always considered as the top priority for wizards to overcome. One second is a long time in a life-and-death battle.In particular, unlike knights who move their bodies in real time and wield swords, wizards who take time to manifest their magic feel the sense of danger much more.With the advancement of science, even wizards were less exposed to the same dangers as before, but they did not disappear completely.Since they were wizards who always had to think clearly and rationally, they had no choice but to hang on to this part more.In such a situation, what Rudger said now was not just to satisfy the expectations of the students, but to light the eyes of all wizards and inspire them.Flora\u2019s best friend Cheryl asked her.\u201cFlora. Is that really true?\u201d\u201cHmm. Well. Has there ever been a proper shortening of the procedure so far?\u201dThere was definitely a way to reduce the casting time. A typical example is scroll magic, which is performed by storing existing magic in a medium in advance.However, in this case, there is the limit of a single-shot. Scrolls once cast will lose their effect.Alternatively a magic called [Reverberation of Memory] that activates magic in advance and stores it can be used. Even in this case, it is impossible to use it continuously because there\u2019s a limit to the maximum amount of spells that can be stored according to the skill level.\u201cAs long as we don\u2019t change the structure of the magic itself, I think it\u2019s impossible.\u201dIn the end, in order to shorten the time, fundamental techniques need to be improved, but even that is impossible. Commonly used magic is the most optimal method that has been refined, devised, and created by wizards who will go down in history for thousands of years.To some, it may be only a third-level flame elemental magic, but behind the magic there are traces of countless geniuses in history. Even those who are called geniuses in modern times can\u2019t improve existing magic because it\u2019s so perfect that there\u2019s nothing to improve.That was something that had already been decided over a hundred years ago. Even Flora Lumos admitted it.\u2018Nevertheless, if you dare to change a part, you have no choice but to lose something.\u2019If the manifestation speed of a technique increases, other parts will inevitably become weak. The power decreases, the range narrows, or the accuracy decreases. However, if the elements involved are reduced can it still be the same spell?No. From then on, it\u2019ll become a completely different magic.For wizards who value legitimacy very much, it would be an issue.\u2018If you really meant to increase the casting speed with what I thought of.\u2019Flora\u2019s gaze narrowed narrowly.\u2018I will be very disappointed, teacher.\u2019No. Rather, Flora wished Rudger would have done it so that it would make it easier for her to act.\u2018I think our handsome princess felt the same way.\u2019The three princesses boast a beauty different from their own, with hair that looks like weaving gold threads.Contrary to her side, even for a woman who likes her straight and dignified appearance, her opinion of Rudger will inevitably be offensive. As if to prove it, her princess-sama\u2019s face also sat down coldly.The moment when the atmosphere in the classroom gradually begins to flow strangely Rudger clapped his hands to refresh the atmosphere.\u201cStop. The chatter ends there.\u201dAll the students kept their mouths shut, but the atmosphere itself did not change. Rudger said with a smirk as if he wasn\u2019t aware of it.\u201cYou seem to have a lot of questions. Good. Before I show you, let me answer a few questions.\u201dAt that moment, the students immediately raised their hands.Rudger pointed to the first student to raise his hand\u201cTell me.\u201d\u201cMy name is Alex Salane, a sophomore. Mr. Rudger you said that you\u2019ll shorten the time of magic manifestation, what exactly did you mean?\u201d\u201cShortening the manifestation time is literally shortening. Be more precise when you ask a question. Next.\u201d\u201cThis is Dahlia in sophomore year. By any chance, shortening the manifestation of a spell means that you want to improve the spell?\u201d\u201cNo. The trick is to keep it the same, but to cast it faster.\u201dAt those words, voices came from all over the place.\u201cCan you really increase the speed of spell manifestation?\u201d\u201cThat can\u2019t be possible. Wasn\u2019t it a challenge that no wizard had ever been able to overcome?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s absurd. There\u2019s no way it\u2019s possible.\u201dFlora had the same thought. How can the speed of speed manifestation be increased without modifying or improving the magic?Isn\u2019t it supposed to be an obvious way to increase the proficiency through countless repetitions? But looking at that imposing Rudger\u2019s expression, she felt a little nauseous.\u201cThat is impossible.\u201dFlora couldn\u2019t stand it and opened her mouth.An icy gaze flew towards her and fixed her. Flora felt her self-esteem slightly hurt.\u201cI am Flora Lumos.\u201dAt her self-introduction, the noise around her grew louder.Flora came out.\u201d\u201cHa-ha. That teacher is done for.\u201dEven among students, Flora\u2019s reputation was impressive. It was the same for the new students who entered this time.A 2nd year genius. Retaining the nickname of a genius in Theon, she was already famous among the freshmen.It was only natural for all of her students to pay attention as she raised her objection to Rudger\u2019s approach right from the first day of class.\u201cI don\u2019t remember allowing the question, but let\u2019s just skip it this time. Why is the student saying that it\u2019s impossible?\u201d\u201cThe only way to shorten the casting time of a spell without modifying or improving it is to increase your master over it.\u201d\u201cWhy do you think there isn\u2019t another way?\u201d\u201cBecause no one has ever done it, not even the geniuses of history, even the high-ranking arch mages could do it. But since teacher said he did it, I couldn\u2019t believe it.\u201dEven now, countless wizards in the tower continue their quest every day, squeezing their heads in search of the truth. Nevertheless, unlike in the past, there were areas where no progress was made any more, and shortening the casting of spells was a typical example.A new teacher saying that he managed to do it meant more than a simple bluff, it was close to a general insult to the magic world.At Flora\u2019s words, each student nodded in agreement with her opinion.No students believed Rudger or sided with him. Little by little, the atmosphere in the classroom became hostile to Rudger. But Rudger did not wriggle an eyebrow.He did not waver, as if no external pressure could even scratch him.\u201cNo one couldn\u2019t? That\u2019s funny. I think it was rather no one tried.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cMagic is based on tradition and history. But it has been brought to stagnation from a certain moment. Now that science has advanced, magic is under threat.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Are you saying that science is superior to magic?\u201d\u201cI just think that magic has room for further development, just like science. To say \u2018there is no room for improvement\u2019 is wrong.\u201d\u201cThere has never been such a case.\u201d\u201cBecause no one did it.\u201d\u201cEveryone who has done it has failed.\u201d\u201cThen I will be the first to succeed.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Are you serious right now?\u201d\u201cThere is no reason for me to lie in front of everyone like this.\u201dFlora was ecstatic at his impudence. Does that teacher not know what he was talking about?\u201cWell, it seems you don\u2019t understand, so let\u2019s start the class right now. Did you say Flora? Do you know how long, on average, it takes to compose the [Fluttering Flame] formula I wrote on the magic board right now?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Depending on who\u2019s unfolding it. 10 seconds for a wizard who just reached the 3rd rank. As you become proficient and increase your rank, it will be shorter, under five seconds.\u201d\u201cOkay. However, I do not like the frivolous method of increasing the speed by increasing your rank. What I\u2019m saying is tailored to the level of the students I\u2019m teaching. Then, no matter who casts the spell, it will be five seconds.\u201d\u201cIs this your method?\u201d\u201cYes. You are very confident. Can you show us right now?\u201dFlora was not frightened by the provocative words.\u201cSure.\u201dFlora went down from the church with dignified steps and stood on the top of the pulpit. She raised her personal wand and immediately used [Fluttering Flame].The basis is manifestation and the attribute element is fire, in addition to the elements of heating, combustion, compression, expansion, diffusion, and acceleration.The magic that rises in the air is in the form of blazing flames. Its speed was like a raging wind, and the students who had been paying attention burst out in exclamation.Rudger checked the golden pocket watch in his hand.\u201cTime, 4.78 seconds. A speed that doesn\u2019t look like a 2nd grader and the process was perfect.\u201d\u201cIt didn\u2019t matter.\u201d\u201cBut it\u2019s still slow.\u201dRudger\u2019s cold voice flew over to Flora, who was conceited.\u201c\u2026Yes?\u201d\u201cThe record for the fastest casting of [Fluttering Flames] among the third rank wizards is 4.41 seconds but that\u2019s still slow.\u201d\u201c\u2026I can do it faster once I get used to it.\u201d\u201cI said that even 4.41 seconds is slow.\u201dEveryone was taken aback by Rudger\u2019s very dignified declaration.Rudger decided to show them why he said that. Standing on top of the pulpit, Rudger began to concentrate his magic.\u201cLook carefully. This is how [Fluttering Flames] is used.\u201dMuttering that, he raised a small staff and pointed it into the air. The magic that flowed out from the tip of the wand soon began to form a rite but something was strange.What unfolded after the expression-based procedure was not the stage of heating and combustion that was supposed to constitute the [Fluttering Flame]. It was just a straight line, a flow of magic that had no meaning.Aren\u2019t you using [Fluttering Flames]?When students thought that the magic of [Fluttering Flames] in the air was completed. It happened in the blink of an eye.\u201c\u2026\u2026!!!\u201dThe entire classroom was filled with silent clamorsNo one had seen In the first place, Rudger slowly showed how he casted the magic.The first step was not the magic of [Fluttering Flames]. The operation of magic was completely different from the usual method.However, the result was the same.What was completed was the magic of [Fluttering Flames]. It was perfect, just like in the textbooks.How?Only the beginning and the end exist, and the middle process seems to have been cut off and disappeared.The speed is surprisingly fast. 1 second? No. It took almost 0.3 seconds. It was incomprehensible to the common sense of the students.\u201cDid you see it?\u201dRudger\u2019s voice was flat without any highs or lows. He had no sense of excitement for what he had done.\u201cWhat the hell.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll show you one more time for those who haven\u2019t seen it.\u201dRudger said so, breaking the existing technique and repeating the process that had been seen a while ago. Slower this time, so that everyone can see properly.The students opened their eyes to see if there was something they had missed, and looked at Rudger\u2019s technique.Magical energy spewed out from the tip of the wand, and it again proceeded in a strange way, just like the first time and immediately [Fluttering Flame] was completed.\u201cCrazy.\u201d\u201cIs that possible?\u201d\u201cHow?\u201dHe didn\u2019t use an artifact of [Reverberation of Memory.No matter how fast it was, the process had to exist. But he skipped the process and showed only the result. There is cause and effect in everything and so it\u2019s magic.But Rudger\u2019s way wasn\u2019t like that at all. He removed that cause but the effect was still the same.\u201cNo, just what the hell\u2026\u2026\u201dEven Flora, who was watching from the nearest point, did not understand what Rudger had shown her.\u201cFinally, everyone\u2019s eyes have changed.\u201d\u201cGulp.\u201dThe sound of someone swallowing saliva resounded throughout the classroom. To that extent, the students focused on what Rudger would say next.\u201cCasting [Fluttering Flame took me 0.24 seconds. It is very different from the previous record but at the same time, you will find it strange. Because the first magic was not [Fluttering Flame].\u201d\u201cI definitely used magic. To be precise, it was used for the sake of speed.\u201d\u201cFor speed?\u201d\u201cWhat the hell is that?\u201dThe students who muttered to each other shut their mouths again\u201cI call this, Source Code.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 14": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Academy\u2019s Undercover ProfessorCH 14Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayC14: Source Code (1)At my words, the students catch their breath. Because some people don\u2019t know what the source code is.\u2018From their point of view, it would be a real surprise.\u2019No matter how advanced science is, this world is around the 19th century in comparison with Earth. Because magic, not science, was the mainstay, so it made a much more dramatic development than I originally thought.Still, living in the 19th century, there were many things that were lacking. This was particularly the case in the absence of a computerized computing system.\u2018A source code is a kind of blueprint that outputs a set result immediately by inputting a value. I made it by grafting it into magic.\u2019Of course, I didn\u2019t make this by myself. To be precise, I came up with the idea, but the actual composition and completion was possible only with the help of the master who taught me magic.Still, I have a stake in what I made, so there shouldn\u2019t be any problem in teaching the students.Considering Master\u2019s personality, it\u2019s not like he would say anything about this. Rather, it was the problems I would face once I ran into them.The source code is a method that is close to a kind of trick, created based on my memories of living on Earth.It must be unbelievable for students who know algorithms but do not know about computer hardware, software, programs, input and output, and code.Above all, the level of wizards was stagnant due to excessive selection and self-confidence, and yet there was a prevailing tendency to make fun of science.They would never accept the contributions science can make to magic. I\u2019m sure they would be foaming at their mouths saying \u2019This isn\u2019t magic!\u2019Compared to those guys, I have a freer way of thinking.In order for the software called source code to operate, a body called hardware, programs, and data are required.Here, hardware means a wand that can apply magic or the wizard itself. A program is a crafted spell, and data is the magic to make it come true.In the end, the source code I used is through the biological hardware of humans. It consumes data called magic.With the source code even complex spells can easily be casted by simply injecting a little magical power.To put it simply, while others carefully draw each stroke to implement magic, I just slam like a stamp. It\u2019s easy considering the difference in speed between handwriting and printing.No matter how fast a human being can copy, there is no way he can keep up with the speed of a person who uses a printer.People even make a lot of mistakes if they are impatient. If the procedure is out of order, the result will be wrong. Naturally, the spell loses its power and cannot be used or the reverse flow of magic power can put your life at risk.With source code these issues don\u2019t exist.In any situation, only certain values are provided. Its speed is something that other wizards can\u2019t follow.\u2018Of course, a rank 6 wizard or higher would be faster.\u2019In the first place, they are superhumans with supercomputers in their heads.For the students of Theon Academy who have not yet fully matured, source code must be a really great revolution.\u2018It\u2019s not without flaws either. The only spells that can be used are those 3rd rank and lower. Beyond that, it causes overload due to the amount of magical power. And it\u2019s just that making the source code is so complicated and difficult.\u2019It is not for nothing that computer programmers go through tests while diversifying all kinds of patterns for debugging. Because I also wrapped my hair so much that I made it. However, once made, it can be used over and over again, so it is very convenient.In particular, I don\u2019t have to use the 3rd rank or lower spells by using troublesome incantations one by one.After all, the magic of source code is the product of an invention made to catch up with those who have talent as much as possible.In this academy, where only geniuses gather, if I want to do well as a teacher for two years, I have to go ahead and teach classes with even these basics.* * *All the students kept their mouths shut at the emergence of a groundbreaking magic called source code. In particular, first-year students were excited.\u2018I felt half cheated, so I chose Rudger Chelici\u2019s class, but to witness this.\u2019Some students felt a cooling sensation on their backs.\u2018If only I didn\u2019t take this class today.\u2019A new type of magic manifestation that transcends common sense.They cannot see its appearance with their own eyes, and in addition to that, they will be deprived of the opportunity to learn.It was such a terrible nightmare for the students who were about to walk the path of a wizard, just imagining it sent chills down their spine.\u2018\u2026\u2026I\u2019m really happy.\u2019All the students gathered here shared the same thoughts.They looked at Rudger again. Obviously, his first impression was very serious, profound, and intense, contrary to what they had expected. Even so, the most important thing for a magic academy teacher is magic skills.Just repeating what others have said is not enough to earn students\u2019 respect.But now all students who saw the new magic had feelings of reverence beyond respect for Rudger.Above all, Rudger\u2019s behavior was surprising.Although he demonstrated in front of everyone a new method that could be called the discovery of the century, his expression showed no sign of excitement.For this man, even the groundbreaking magic called source code was simply something that could be unfolded in front of everyone.\u2018Perhaps aside from source code he has other secrets.\u2019If you invent something like this and show no excitement, there\u2019s no doubt that you hide other secrets.At that moment a spark ignited in the hearts of the 80 magic academy students present in the classroom.\u2018If I can learn that magic I can make further progress.\u2019That strong will is revealed in their eyes, and is shot towards Rudger.Rudger\u2019s half-opened eyes gave them an ok response, but his back was damp with cold sweat inside his cloak.\u2018Why are their eyes like that?\u2019For Rudger, who was expecting only opinions that he was moderately great and that he seemed like a good teacher, the students\u2019 reaction was surprising.Their eyes were hotter than the lava that just broke through the strata.Feeling like he was going to burn, Rudger focused and maintained his poker face. But he knew he couldn\u2019t depend on source code for the 2 years he would be here.He didn\u2019t want others to discover that he\u2019s an impostor. He had to prepare more in the future.\u2018Let\u2019s go to the end. But first of all, what should I do with the daughter of the duke who is on the platform?\u2019\u201cFlora Lumos.\u201dFlora, who had been focused on the source code magic that Rudger had unfolded, finally came to her senses.Rudger\u2019s cold, sharp eyes looked at her and felt like a cold blade had cut through her heart.\u2018This guy is\u2026\u2026\u2019She thought of herself as a genius and she had the talent to match it. No one doubted her and to those who did she demonstrated her skills in person.Even though he was an academy teacher, she was embarrassed in front of him. No matter how old she is, no matter how long she learns science or magic, and no matter how hard she tries she is already ahead of her teachers.But Rudger was different. He neither reveals nor brags about himself. In addition, he does not sway anyone else. It is as if she was looking at a pillar of steel that is deeply embedded in the ground and stands tall. It does not rust and does not wear out even in storms, rain and snow.\u2018How the hell is this person a new teacher? Source code? I\u2019ve never heard of such magic.\u2019The intimidation was enough to affect even Flora, who had met the royal family several times. Even the noble princess had her eyes wide open at the sight of Rudger.\u201cA groundbreaking method of shortening the spell casting time. Has your question finally been answered?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Yes.\u201dFlora tried to pretend to be calm and replied that way. She kept her posture neat and leaned back to not show any flaws.Was her behavior funny?There was a slight but smile on the corner of Rudger\u2019s lips. As if he had already seen through this desperately strong pretender.\u201cFlora Lumos.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Yes. Teacher.\u201d\u201cYou couldn\u2019t overcome your own intolerance, and you asked questions without my permission. Do you admit it?\u201dFlora bit her lip. She was proud of herself, but she couldn\u2019t argue with that.\u201cYes\u2026I admit it.\u201dA feeling of defeat that she had never felt before. The envy of the students, which she usually felt, had never been as painful as it was now. Suddenly, a memory of her childhood that she wanted to forget came to her mind.The figure of her father looking down at her with a cold gaze. She wanted to be recognized for her skills and had a goal. She was desperately holding back her tears because she was about to cry but she couldn\u2019t break down here yet.\u201cI won\u2019t say more than this, because I know it myself. However, your actions clearly challenged the school authority. As I warned you in the beginning, I am not going to let this go.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Yes.\u201d\u201cFlora Lumos I give you 10 penalty points.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t that surprising, but if the subject was Flora, the story was different.Theon genius who has never had any flaws until now. She had absolutely nothing to do with penalty points, and she was the kind of woman she never thought she would ever be, so she was shaken, even for receiving only 10 penalty points.\u201cAre there any complaints?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026No. I think it makes sense.\u201dFlora bit her lip.\u201cOh my gosh.\u201d\u201cThat Flora\u2026\u2026\u201dEven the other students were surprised that Flora had been penalized. Much less that this was not a forced accusation, but a reasonable punishment that even the person herself had no choice but to admit.Flora came down from the pulpit with weak steps and returned to her seat.\u201cThe spell [Fluttering Flame] you showed me was more perfect than anything I had ever seen.\u201dShe turned around and looked at the pulpit. Rudger was staring at her with an infinitely straight gaze.\u201cI don\u2019t hate students with skills. So Flora Lumos you receive 10 bonus points.\u201dAs a result, her 10 penalty points are virtually gone.Some students felt relieved and some were envious but Flora felt unprecedented shame.Even is the penalty points are gone her memory of receiving them is still there. Ten years from now, or maybe even the rest of her life, it was something she would never forget.Flora interpreted Rudger bonus points as the victor\u2019s mercy on this foolish student who dared to attack him. It left a deep scar on Flora\u2019s self-esteem.\u201cThank\u2026\u2026you.\u201dAll she could say was this.As she returned to her seat and sat down, Cheryl, who had been watching the whole thing, asked in a worried voice.\u201cFlora, are you okay?\u201dCheryl knew how strong Flora\u2019s pride was. She said that exactly what she had been through as a child forced her to be that way.She had a hard time imagining how humiliated Flora felt when the new teacher reprimanded her in front of everyone.\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201dFlora replied with a smile. Her relaxed appearance was no different from her usual one and she didn\u2019t look like her wounded person at all.\u2018Ah. That\u2019s fine. Because it\u2019s Flora, I think she\u2019ll be able to brush it off quickly.\u2019Cheryl sighed in relief. She thought that her friend might be going in the wrong direction.Flora looked at the podium with the same face as usual but she didn\u2019t see Cheryl or any of the students in the classroom. A scorching fire burned in Flora\u2019s eyes, igniting everything.* * *I went back to my seat and looked at Flora\u2019s condition. Belatedly, I remembered that the Lumos family was a famous duke in the Empire.Is she not going to use the power of the family to put pressure on me for what just happened? Do you go home and tell your father?However, Flora\u2019s expression as she sat down was calm. There\u2019s nothing strange about the way she naturally communicates with her friend sitting next to her.I can see, she\u2019s a smart kid, so I\u2019m not going to keep this in my heart. In the first place giving her those bonus points was a kind of reconciliation attempt to avoid fighting and encourage her to do better in the future. I\u2019m really glad that she accepted it.\u201cThen I will start the first class.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Dang. Dang.\u2019When I finished explaining the theory and simple method of discharging magic, the clock tower bell rang to end the class. I breathed a sigh of relief in my heart, thinking that I had finished the class safely without receiving any tackles.The students did not seem to feel anything particularly suspicious as I continued to briefly explain the contents of the textbook by mixing them with practical tips.The first lesson was done without problems, so I can carry on to the next class as it is.I teach a total of 4 hours a week. Classes are held twice a week, divided into two hours each, so I had quite a bit of time until the next class.As I put on my coat and was about to leave the classroom, I saw some students staring and approaching me.I did something for a moment, but I later realized that I was missing one thing.\u201cAh. By the way, I will not give you homework from the first day. Go back and review today\u2019s lesson.\u201dAt my words, the students smiled and rejoiced.Even if it\u2019s an academy where geniuses gather, they are students after all. Seeing them so happy for not receiving homework for once, I thought they were still kids.I can\u2019t give homework from the first day no matter where I\u2019m. After all, other teachers besides me will give the homework. Teachers who give homework from the first day are often criticized throughout the semester.In regards to classes, everything I give can be seen as a kind of calculation. The more gossip and dissatisfaction with other teachers, the less mention of me.I got out of the classroom with the list of students on the pedestal. When I left, the eyes of the students flew, but I naturally ignored it.To proceed with the next lesson I needed basic personal information about 80 students attending my class. Also, considering the unresolved issue with the secret society, I had to move as quickly as possible.* * *\u2018Wow. Really.\u2019Aidan, a freshman at Theon Academy, realized that he really had come to Theon after taking Rudger Chelici\u2019s class.\u2018I thought it was a vague feeling, but it was amazing.\u2019Aidan, who came up from the countryside, was a commoner, but he was a proud young man with a passion for magic more than anyone else.Thanks to the hard work he had accumulated so far and some luck, he was able to pass Theon entrance exam, and as a freshman, he took his first classes with a bright attitude.[Rudger Chelici lectures on the manifestation system.] He honestly wasn\u2019t expecting much.When I first entered the classroom, I secretly picked up the voices of other students, and found that the class I had chosen was more talkative than I expected.Originally, there are a total of two manifestation system classes, and this one is taught by a fallen noble. A new teacher wouldn\u2019t be able to teach this class but he was lucky because 5 people retired last year.All the rumors circulating in <Akashic Records> were fake. Of course, it was the noble students who had a low mouth and looked down on others.However, Aidan, who came to Theon from the countryside, knew only that they were seniors and did not know that they were great nobles, so he did not doubt their words.\u2018Is the teacher named Rudger Chelici that bad?\u2019It was just a class I chose without much thought, so I regretted it for nothing. However, Aidan realized how short his thoughts were, as soon as Rudger appeared.The man, who overwhelmed 80 students even though he was standing on the pulpit, was like a soldier on the verge of a fierce battle. And what happened afterwards made Aidan even more astonished.He had a conversation with a female senior about the impossibility of shortening the casting speed and then she showed everyone a technique.The moment he encountered the magic that Rudger Chelici called the source code, Aidan felt the blood boil all over his body.It was like fireworks exploded in front of him. It was the light of knowledge that appears when you clearly witness a mystery that you have never encountered before, and it was the moment of opening your eyes to a wider world.It sounded like an excessive leap, but at least Aidan himself felt that way.When he was a child who didn\u2019t know anything yet, a wandering wizard showed him magic. That magic was only 1st rank, and now that he thought about it, the wizard technique was not perfect and it was even crude.At that time, Aidan thought that the figure was very cool.Since then, he has continued to study magic under the guidance of the wandering wizard, although he did not feel the shock he had when he first encountered magic he remembered learning magic itself was so much fun.Aidan grew rapidly day by day thanks to his passion for magic and, surprisingly, his talent for magic. In this way, he was able to enter the magic academy, Theon, through fierce competition.He took his first class here, thinking that he might satisfy his craving for magic and open up a new world but instead witnessed something extraordinary.\u2018Mr. Rudger Chelici is a wonderful person!\u2019He thought it was unusual from the first impression, but he was the real deal.Aidan couldn\u2019t hide his excitement, thinking he was really lucky to have taken this class.\u201cHuh.\u201dIt was then. A voice of blatant contempt could be heard from the seat next to him.When he turned his head, a first-year boy from somewhere was looking at him with her arms crossed. His face is good-looking, but it looks quite greasy because of the blonde hair that was parted to show his forehead.Aidan then looked around. Now that most of the students had already left the classroom, there were not many left.\u201cAh! You were talking to me!\u201dThe face of an aristocratic male student was distorted by Aiden\u2019s innocent reaction.\u201cYou. Are you mocking me now?\u201d\u201cYes? I didn\u2019t mean that.\u201dAidan smiled shyly and tried to say that he never meant that, but the situation in front of him was already overturned by the fact that the person in front of him had been insulted.\u201cYou dare to ignore me, the first son of Baron Pellio?!\u201dAidan broke out in a cold sweat. It seemed that he was wrong in many ways to pass for good.\u2018What?\u2019A helping hand came to Aidan the moment he was contemplating how to handle this situation.\u201cIf it\u2019s Baron Pellio, isn\u2019t he at the edge of the Empire?\u201d\u201cWhat?! Who are you?\u201dIt was a blue-haired boy who went out to help Aidan.Jevan Pellio looked at the boy and put a smile on his lips.\u201cThe Theon Academy admitted such a little boy?\u201d\u201cIt would be better than having a child of a poor baron family pass.\u201d\u201cWhat?! You dare insult the Pellio family?!\u201dAs Jevan clenched his teeth and tried to increase his magical power, the light blue-haired boy, Leo, did not lose his smile.\u201cI will make you pay the price for the words and deeds that dared insult the nobleman\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cTry.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cTry it. What will happen if you unleash your magic here and attack us?\u201dEveryone was shocked at Leo\u2019s bold statement. He thought that ordinary people would bow their heads if they were moderately intimidated.\u201cDo you know that this is your family? Wake up. Even if you\u2019re a noble, if you make a little fuss here, it\u2019s not worth it. Didn\u2019t you get any notice of that before you came in?\u201d\u201cYou \u2026\u2026!\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t know what to do other than stare because there\u2019s nothing to say.\u201dAt Leo\u2019s words, Jevan realized that there were still several students left in the classroom. Among them, there were children of high-ranking nobles whom they did not dare look up to.Jevan looked at Aidan as if to kill him, and left the classroom without saying anything.Aidan thought about whether this might be good or not. But right now, his priority was to thank that friend for helping him.\u201cThank you for your help. I am Aidan.\u201d\u201cI am Leo. Oh, and no need to thank you. I just acted because it was disgusting to see people calling themselves aristocrats.\u201d\u201cAre you a good person?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026What did you hear me say?\u201dLeo looked at Aidan like a strange person and then shook his head.\u201cI\u2019m just going to go.\u201d\u201cAh! I will go with you.\u201d\u201cDo you know where I am going?\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you going to the next class? From the book I see in your hand I\u2019m going to the same class.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Sheesh. Do whatever you feel like.\u201dLeo spoke bluntly, but he didn\u2019t turn down his offer. Aidan had an intuition that Leo\u2019s behavior was just a bit strange, and he was a good person.Leo, who was looking at Aidan who was packing his textbooks for the next class, suddenly opened his mouth.\u201cIt would be nice to go around without showing too much.\u201d\u201cYes? What?\u201d\u201cTry not to look like a plain villager who didn\u2019t learn magic properly.\u201d\u201cOh, is that so? Sorry. I don\u2019t know that.\u201d\u201cDo not forget. This is Theon Academy. It\u2019s full of all kinds of great people.\u201d\u201cGreat people? Ah. I think I can figure it out by looking at Mr. Chelici.\u201dLeo let out a sigh in response to the frigid reaction. Apparently, this poor friend had a lot to learn.\u201cListen. Once you\u2019ve taken the class, you too need to know how this place works. And you have to be careful about certain students.\u201d\u201cSpecific students?\u201d\u201cEven within Theon, there are students who have an exceptionally overwhelming position. Right now, our first-year students have just come in and don\u2019t know what to do, but from the second year on, they do.\u201dThe most representative example was Flora Lumos.\u201c2nd year Flora Lumos. I didn\u2019t know that we would be taking the same class, but it\u2019s good to be careful.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cThere are rumors that she has a bad personality. The teacher who was in charge of the manifestation class last year suddenly quit because she had a big influence. She honestly thought she could do the same again\u2026\u2026\u201dLeo also remembered Rudger Chelici class. The groundbreaking magic called source code he showed was definitely great. Because that Flora Lumos left without a click.But he didn\u2019t think Flora Lumos was going to collapse just because of that. Rather, there was a possibility that sparks of anger could be thrown at other people.\u201cSo it\u2019s best to avoid her as much as possible.\u201d\u201cAnyone else?\u201d\u201cThere is. One of the noble bloodlines of the Exilion Empire.\u201d\u201cAh. I heard that rumor too. It\u2019s said that there was a princess in second grade?\u201d\u201cThe Third Princess Erendira von Exilion. She was so noble and the emperor loved her, so she must have been able to come here. Of course, there\u2019s nothing good about us being commoners.\u201d\u201cAh. Her.\u201dAidan thought of a woman who had hair like gold threads. Blondes aren\u2019t that rare, but there\u2019s only one blonde with a sense of nobility.\u201cAnd finally, Freuden Ulburg.\u201d\u201cThat Ulburg? One of the three great duke families\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat other Ulburg could be in the Empire? Freuden, the eldest son of the Duke family of Ulburg. He is the man who leads the biggest faction in sophomore year. To be precise, it is an upper-class faction made up of only nobles.\u201d\u201cUpper tier\u2026\u2026clique.\u201d\u201cPeople like us are like roadside bugs, so it\u2019s better not to get involved. Fortunately, Freuden doesn\u2019t take this class. By the way, the idiot who quarreled with you a while ago seems to belong to that faction.\u201d\u201cBecause it was unavoidable. Is there anyone else out there?\u201dLeo couldn\u2019t figure out what kind of person Aidan was. But he was sure at least he wasn\u2019t a bad guy or a dark-hearted guy.\u201cThere are a few more.\u201d\u201cOh yeah? Who is it?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll explain that later.\u201d\u201cGreat! Ah. Would you like to eat together later?\u201d\u201cWhat? Why me?\u201dAidan and Leo left the classroom murmuring. Not knowing that one of the remaining students in the classroom was watching them.* * *\u2018Hmm. Is this a private classroom?\u2019Standing in front of the room called the laboratory, I felt a little strange.As it is Theon, the new teachers are given a considerable amount of personal space. The name plate at the entrance also had the name Rudger Chelici.\u2018Let\u2019s go inside.\u2019I was curious to see what the inside looked like, so I decided to check it out.I opened the door and entered the classroom and I couldn\u2019t help but be surprised to see the person who was inside.\u201cOh. Mr. Rudger. Come in.\u201dOne of the people I have to watch out for here, the president of Theon Academy was inside.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Naturally, I sat across from the president who was sitting on the guest sofa.She looked at me and smiled but it was the president who spoke first.\u201cHow is it? The interior design is so pretty, isn\u2019t it?\u201dThere is no point in saying such things.\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cTheon Academy provides each teacher with their own personal space. Ms. Rudger is free to do anything you want to feel comfortable here.\u201d\u201cI like that.\u201dThe president\u2019s golden eyes turned to me. I also looked at her without avoiding her gaze.I saw myself in the beautiful amber-like eyes. It was the same when we first met, but when I looked into the eyes of the president, something made my body itchy.I immediately switched the topic.\u201cWhat did you come here for, sir?\u201d\u201cDid I come to a place I shouldn\u2019t be?\u201d\u201cIt is because I am curious that a busy person like the president would come to the personal space of a new teacher like this.\u201d\u201cThen it\u2019s not like I\u2019ve come to a place I couldn\u2019t come?\u201d\u201cBut it\u2019s burdensome.\u201dWhen I spoke directly, the president kept her mouth shut.The gentle smile was still there, but in her eyes, a strange emotion that was hard to understand was spreading like drops of ink dropped into water.The president shook her head.\u201cThere is no particular reason.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cNo matter how new Mr. Rudger is, he is a precious teacher who has been assigned to the Theon Academy. Of course, as president, I have to pay attention.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dWhen I nodded, she showed a sullen expression as if she was dissatisfied.\u201cYou can be a little more surprised.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m already surprised enough.\u201dIt\u2019s not a lie, it\u2019s true.I opened the door with a pounding heart because it was my personal space, but when I saw the president, I was very surprised. Even if I ran into a ghost on the street in the middle of the night, I was confident that I wouldn\u2019t be more surprised than this.In fact, even now, my heart is beating like crazy, so I\u2019m worried that the president might hear it.\u201cAll the other teachers were surprised.\u201d\u201cHave you visited other teachers?\u201d\u201cMr. Rudger is the last.\u201dWhy was I last? And does the president plan to interview the new teachers? I suddenly remembered the existence of the secret society that had permeated Theon.\u2018Perhaps.\u2019The president noticed something? No matter how secretive it was, it was impossible to completely hide its tail.\u2018She must have noticed that those with suspicious movements had entered Theon.\u2019If I didn\u2019t realize before but now that I know there is a secret society here, the attitude of the president seems to be different.Does she doubt me?\u2018There is a possibility.\u2019It\u2019s a bit unfair for me, but honestly, I have no objection. I\u2019m not a member of the secret society, but I\u2019m a secret society executive.I wonder how the hell this happened, but this is actually my situation right now. When I think about it, my real identity is not so proud, so I have to work hard to avoid being found out.\u201cWhat did the president come to ask me?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m also going to check how the first class was. You had just finished class, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWas there ever a case where the students had a hard time or something like that?\u201d\u201cThere was nothing.\u201dRather, I wondered if it would be okay if the students didn\u2019t ask me questions like this.Well, there were times when I was intentionally telling them not to approach me, but I just meant not to bother me too much, I didn\u2019t know anyone would do it. Ah. Still, the daughter of the Lumos family asked a question.\u201cHmm. That\u2019s amazing. I looked at the list of students attending Mr. Rudger\u2019s lecture this time, and there were many famous students.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cDid you not see the list?\u201d\u201cNow I have brought it for you to see.\u201dI waved the paper in my hand.\u201cWell, Mr. Rudger is up to you, but just in case you don\u2019t know. The princess is also there, so please be careful not to cause any problems.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dPrincess? I wonder why someone like the princess came to my class.Suddenly, I remember the blonde student who asked me a bold question. Come to think of it, when I said that she had a familiar face, was it her bloodline?\u201cAnd I heard that there are many freshmen. Originally, I thought you would only teach the second years, but I think you taught it as a joint class with the first years.\u201d\u201cBecause I had no intention of differentiating between the first year and the second year.\u201d\u201cI am not trying to blame you. Rather, I\u2019m in favor of Mr. Rudger\u2019s method of making a change of his own. Especially among the first graders, I see some pretty amazing kids.\u201d\u201cAmazing kids?\u201d\u201cYes. [Unusual] There are children who use magic, there are children from great families, and there are children who have been raised quite hard in the tower. I usually think that there is a gap when there is a difference in grades, but I think that will be rare for these freshmans.\u201dThinking of her students and smiling brightly, I thought she deserved the position of president of the academy.Every time I see that smile, my skin tingles.First of all, I\u2019m not in a position to speak with confidence in my conscience, so I just gave a brief reply while listening to the president\u2019s words.\u201cWell, anyway, our Theon has high expectations for Mr. Rudger Chelici.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re praising me too much.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m glad that there were no problems in the first class and that the first impressions with the students seemed to be okay. No need to worry.\u201dAfter saying these words, the president got up from her seat.I asked politely.\u201cCan we have a cup of tea?\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dWas it surprising that I said this? She showed a slightly bewildered expression, and then she rolled her eyes like a crescent moon.\u201cI appreciate the suggestion, but I have a lot of work to do.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d\u201cAnd Mr. Rudger has just arrived, so do you know where the car is and where the cup is in this office?\u201d\u201cIt must be on the inside of a shelf somewhere.\u201d\u201cDing. In fact, we only prepared coffee. If you want to drink tea, you have to apply separately for it.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cYou can find out in the future. Then, I wish you all the best in the future.\u201dThe president greeted with a playful smile and left behind those words. She was truly a gentle storm.I let out a small sigh and rubbed my eyelids with my fingers.* * *\u201cHow was it?\u201dWilford, an old gentleman, followed the president as she walked down the hallway with a leisurely pace and asked.\u201cAre your doubts about Mr. Rudger cleared?\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026Well.\u201dThe President recalled the conversation she had with Rudger Chelici, specifically the restrained attitude he showed.\u201cNot completely.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201dRudger Chelici was a unique man. The president thought so.When anyone meets her gaze they are captivated by her golden eyes. To be precise, her eyes themselves are a reverberation of her innate magical power, enchanting magic.It is the power that the president possesses, and the number one reason that made her rise to this position.Of course, she didn\u2019t intentionally use the magical eyes of charm on her opponent. This is a kind of innate constitution, so if anyone makes eye contact with her, they will get caught without her intention.Thankfully, she was able to control it to some extent now, but her daily life was difficult in the past.Now that she has become the president, she admits frankly that she would not have been able to come to this position without her eyes.She tried to open up her inner thoughts using her personal interview as a pretext.\u2018My magical eyes tend to be more influenced by the other person\u2019s magic power.\u2019Her magic eyes can affect even 4th rank wizards. Of course, the premise is that the opponent did not use mind-defense magic.In particular, the greater the magical power they have, the more easily the opponent would succumb. The power of the magic eye is proportional to the total amount of magic the opponent has.But Rudger didn\u2019t.He must be in the 4th rank, but his reaction is completely different from other teachers.The first time she met him was when he had just entered her office and this is the second time. The man did not show any shaking even after seeing his magic eyes twice.Did he resist the power of her magic eyes only with his steel will? The president\u2019s eyes lit up.\u2018He\u2019s a fun guy.\u2019The president had no choice but to think so but she can\u2019t express her feelings explicitly.\u201cA suspicious movement has been caught, so we are looking at the people who are most dubious, but there are no results.\u201dEver since she found out that an unsavory group has been hiding in Theon, she had been unable to ignore even the smallest of things.Among them, Rudger Chelici was embroiled in a train attack while on his way here. It\u2019s not his fault though.What if the train attack was a diversion and the person named Rudger Chelici was swapped out in the meantime?The president sent Wilford, the henchman she trusted the most, and one of the strongest among this Theon\u2019s powers with the pretext of escorting him to the academy.\u201cWhat do you think, Mr. Wilford?\u201d\u201cHmm. I don\u2019t think I can trust him right away, but I haven\u2019t found anything particularly suspicious about him.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201dIf Wilford said that, he would be one of them or he could be innocent. Or maybe he\u2019s such a great guy that he completely fooled them.\u2018For now, I can only hope that it is not the latter.\u2019There are so many things to be concerned about right now, so she decided to stop worrying about Rudger.\u201cAh. But I can be sure of one thing.\u201d\u201cWhat is that?\u201d\u201cThat man, Rudger Chelici, is by no means ordinary.\u201d\u201cWhat did you see to say that?\u201d\u201cI can only answer that it is an old man\u2019s sense.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dWilford seemed quite sympathetic to Rudger Chelici at first.If Wilford, who has a clear eye for people, says that, she can believe it. Still, she didn\u2019t completely dismiss her doubts because at any moment, that possibility could lead to the worst outcome.A wizard is a being who needs to think deeply about every possibility. Above all else, she is the president of Theon Academy.Since she is a person who has risen to an impeccable position that does not tolerate even an inch of negligence, she has no choice but to be careful in all cases.* * *Left alone, I was able to relax my shoulders and let out a sigh only after I saw her step away from the door. I\u2019m tired.\u2018The president visited me suddenly.\u2019Well, in her words, it\u2019s like a normal personal interview with new teachers. The president or someone who is going to be the president suddenly comes and says it, but who would believe it?I think they were all interrogated.\u2018That\u2019s not what\u2019s important.\u2019I went straight to my personal desk and sat down. The desk made of luxurious wood looked quite expensive. A clock made of cog wheels on one wall and on the other wall, the map of Theon is fixed to the board and spread out.Red curtains are spread to the left and right by the window with an antique design, and even the chair I\u2019m sitting on is very luxurious.I was once amazed at Theon resources for allocating this amount of space to a new teacher, and again admired that it was filled with all kinds of luxurious things.I looked through the list of students attending my lectures.\u2018It was real.\u2019On the list of students taking classes, there was a student with an unusually long and wonderful name.2nd year Erendira von Exilion.If has the name of the empire Exilion as her surname, one would know that she is of noble blood, unless one is a fool.\u2018Isn\u2019t that the kid who boldly asked me during the first orientation?\u2019The princess taking my class is burdensome.Even though Theon is said to be like a third area where autonomy is guaranteed even in the Empire, it is a different story if there are people from the imperial family.If something happens to her, I will be involved as well.\u2018In the first place, there is no way that something will happen to her in Theon, but no one knows what will happen.\u2019I cannot rule out small incidents and accidents that occur when experimenting with magic reagents, conducting actual battle simulations, or performing alchemy.Even if I care about the safety of my students as much as possible, there are cases where students fight each other out of the reach of teachers.In order to eliminate such a situation as much as possible, teachers are also given the duty to protect students\u2026\u2026Now that I think about it, there is also a secret society hidden in Theon.Still, nothing will happen right away, so let\u2019s think about it calmly.I also looked closely at the list of students. Among the first and second graders, there were quite a few children who stood out.\u2018Flora from the Lumos family, and even nobles from other kingdoms?\u2019Then all of a sudden, my eyes turned to a student and stopped.\u2018Aidan.\u2019He wasn\u2019t brought up in a particularly great family, and he wasn\u2019t taught by a famous wizard. He was just a commoner.Since he came here, he must have had some talent, but I couldn\u2019t find anything special about him compared to other students.\u2018Something familiar.\u2019There was something that strangely caught my attention.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 17": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Academy\u2019s Undercover ProfessorCH 17Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaygot a fake job at the academy C17: Doubt (2)\u2018I can\u2019t remember right now.\u2019Even when I thought about Aidan, nothing immediately came to mind, so I decided to move on.I put all the personal details of the rest of the students into my head. A total of 54 students in the first year and 26 students in 2nd year.The ratio of 1st and 2nd graders is roughly 2:1. I thought that the number of first graders was higher because of the color of the nameplate, but it was more than I thought.\u2018Even among first-year students, there are some guys to be wary of, especially the newcomers promoted by Magic Tower and the Alchemy School.\u2019Even students with mediocre grades in Theon are called geniuses if they go outside and it is said that all geniuses are out of line somewhere.After checking the list of all the students, I put the papers on the desk and pressed my finger on my flaky forehead.\u2019I am tired in many ways.\u2019I reflected on the meeting and conversation with the president a while ago. When I think of the president coming to me, it means that I haven\u2019t fully earned her trust yet.She\u2019s not completely suspicious, it\u2019s probably half and half. Depending on how I act in the future, there is a high possibility that her gaze towards me will be different.\u2018I do not care.\u2019As long as I have already decided to take on the role I am assigned to, I have no intention of showing suspicious behavior. The president is a <Lexorer> at the sixth rank, which is almost the highest among the eight existing ranks.I heard she\u2019s very close to the 7th rank.Even 100 rank 4 wizards have no chance against her.\u2018Even so, the biggest problem is the secret society.\u2019The secret society is quiet because it is the beginning of the current semester, but if time passes and there is a chance to move around, it will move right away.The question is why have they infiltrated Theon Academy? What are you trying to do by planting people here while dealing with some members of the academy? Are they hoping to overthrow Theon? Or is there something in Theon?\u2018Maybe it\u2019s some kind of action against the Empire.\u2019I took a piece of newspaper stuck between the papers and unfolded it. Newspaper articles written in black letters still talked about the last terrorist attack on the magic engineering train.[The magic engineering train terror incident was eventually revealed to be the work of the revolutionary army.]It seemed almost certain that the revolutionary army was behind the train attack.\u2018To be honest, I am nothing more or less than a terrorist.\u2019If it was the original history of the earth, the politics at this time would have felt like a parliamentary system was added to the modern constitutional monarchy, but in this world where magic exists, the kings and nobles still had very strong authority.Still, seeing all kinds of various movements taking place in this world over the past 50 years, this world also tends to flow similarly to the trend on the Earth where I lived.Magic has stagnated and science has risen rapidly. At the same time, even magic engineering was born by combining science and magic. It is simply surprising that this drastic change took place less than a century ago.That was the reason the revolutionary army arose.\u2018However, there is a high possibility that the secret association has nothing to do with the real revolutionaries.\u2019To put it bluntly, the death of the real First Order, Rudger Chelici, assured me of that. If they were in the same organization, why would he have died because of the train attack?His reaction then was from someone that had never expected the train he was riding on would be attacked. \u00a0It can be said that the train attack was not expected at all by the secret society.\u2018It would be right to separate the secret society and the revolutionary army.\u2019And there is one more fact that can be guessed here.The First Order, Rudger Chelici, was not suitable for battle. He definitely had a talent for magic and pretty good judgment. He must have been highly trained.\u2018When my subordinate saw my face, she just passed me on as the First Order. That means that even they don\u2019t know the face of Rudger on the train.\u2019Why? They thought it was normal for Rudger to change his appearance?\u2018If they thought it was natural for Rudger\u2019s face to change, I can tell the character of the dead Rudger Chelici.\u2019In other words, the characteristics of the First Order are disguise and infiltration. That was rather fortunate for me. At least, there is no reason to doubt other members of the organization by their appearanceIt\u2019d be nice to be at peace.\u2018For now, I\u2019m not going to do anything using my First Order identity in order to clear the Academy\u2019s suspicions.\u2019The troublesome things can be done by my subordinates, so I only have to focus on solidifying my position as the First Order. I probably won\u2019t have to worry about it for a while.However, when the secret society rises to the surface and becomes active the problems will arise in earnest. From planting an executive-level figure as a teacher, it was clear that they were planning to overthrow Theon in some way.\u2018It\u2019s complicated.\u2019It doesn\u2019t look like Theon will be destroyed easily, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s an impenetrable fortress. No matter how powerful an empire is, it is bound to collapse, history has proven it.In particular, in an era of extreme transitional form like these days, the possibility becomes closer to reality even the slightest possibility that the secret society will overthrow Theon cannot be ignored.\u2018In that case, it would be better to leave Theon and entrust myself to the secret society.\u2019No. That\u2019s not okay. I have to do that to live, but I won\u2019t last long.It shouldn\u2019t be a problem if I\u2019m pretending to be a teacher for now under the guise of Rudger Chelici but what if the other First Order notices Rudger\u2019s subtle change?\u2018They will definitely find out.\u2019I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to face when they discover that I\u2019m a traitor. I\u2019d rather have the best chance of surviving if I intentionally interfere with their plans while maintaining this teacher\u2019s position. But again, if I openly stand on the side of Theon, the society will immediately notice my betrayal.\u2018I\u2019m walking on an extremely thin rope.\u2019Unless I know what the purpose of the secret society is, I can\u2019t plan my course of action right now.I picked up a pen and wrote down on a blank piece of paper what I was planning for the future.-Be on the lookout for the First Order of the secret society. I need to quickly find out who it is. After that, avoid contact as much as possible.-Maintain your position as a teacher. Don\u2019t neglect the class.\u2013 In order not to raise suspicions on the side of the academy, for now, focus on working as a teacher.Roughly speaking, it\u2019s these three for now.I didn\u2019t worry that anyone would ever see this post since I wrote it in Korean, so people in this world will not know what this means even when they read it.\u2018Hmm. All I can do right now is do my best as a teacher.\u2019\u201cTock tock.\u201dI tapped the wooden desk with my fingertips.If the secret society contacts me and asks why I\u2019m not acting I can use my job as an excuse for now.I immediately pulled out a new piece of paper to write on and picked up my pen. I had an acquaintance who was originally supposed to meet somewhere else, but I had to tell him that I couldn\u2019t go there.\u2018I have a lot of work to do.\u2019Actually, I had to deal with it on the first day, but I forgot because there were so many things to take care of. Well, there\u2019s nothing to regret about this, so the guy won\u2019t say anything.I thought of the possibility that someone might open this letter, so I wrote it in a roundabout way as much as possible instead of speaking directly.Like Rudger Chelici\u2019s letter, I also used a passphrase. Finally at the end of the letter I added one more phrase.[Don\u2019t forget to bring my luggage.]* * *The reply to the letter I sent came the very next day. The promise written in the letter is to meet next weekend at the Leathervelk industrial park.As for me, I wanted to meet him a little earlier, but I agreed since I understand that we\u2019re busy with work in our own way.After checking the letter, I immediately burned it in case something happened. \u00a0I immediately got out of the office and headed to the dormitory in light clothes.\u201cExcuse me\u2026!\u201dThen someone hurriedly came up and called me.He seems to be a Theon employee, but seeing that his clothes are neater than other people\u2019s, he seemed to be an errand man.\u201cAre you Mr. Rudger Chelici?\u201d\u201cYes. What do you want?\u201dWhen I asked that, the messenger flinched and showed a slightly terrified expression.While I wondered if even the employees were avoiding me, the messenger handed me a document.\u201cWhat is this?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a patrol watch ticket.\u201dWasn\u2019t that usually done by the members or the guard? Why do teachers do that?As I stared at him with that kind of gaze, the messenger broke into a cold sweat and made excuses.\u201cIt seems that this time there was an instruction from the president. Now that the new students enter the school, it is the most lax period for the students of Theon, so this was done in order to prevent the students from causing any problems.\u201d\u201cEven teachers have to participate?\u201d\u201cThe president said the teachers would be the most effective and in the contract, there is a clause that teachers must also step in to prevent problems that occur inside Theon.\u201dCome to think of it, there was such a clause. However, I thought it was meant to be done in moderation at the discretion of the teachers.I didn\u2019t know I would be so active.\u201cHmm.\u201dMaybe it\u2019s because I accepted my attributions differently?The messenger was sweating in a cold sweat and hastily added an ambiguous explanation.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to stay up all night. You just need to check from time to time until the dorm curfew.\u201d\u201cAnd today is my turn?\u201d\u201cYes\u201dI got my watch ticket from the messenger without a word. It had the name Rudger Chelici written on it for today\u2019s date. Since there are many other teachers besides me at Theon, I think they only do this kind of patrol once a week.It\u2019s going to be a little annoying if I have to do it on the weekend.\u201cOkay then.\u201dThe messenger, who had delivered everything he had to say, hurriedly left the place as if running away from me.I ignored the messenger and looked through the list.\u2018Since Theon is so wide, every teacher moves around his designated area?\u2019Today, there were three more people on the watch besides me. Among them, I saw the name of Selina, the new Elemental teacher who was assigned with me this time.Well, since our areas are different, we won\u2019t run into each other, but if we do, let\u2019s say hello.\u2018More than that, the fact that this was not the case in the first place, but suddenly implemented under the direction of the president, means that the president also suspects that there are spies among the teachers.\u2019Perhaps the reason teachers were called this way is to detect suspicious contact or movement. If you are a spy, you will not act hastily unless you are an idiot, but that does not mean that the president\u2019s policy is meaningless.The fact that the president gave such an instruction is because it acts as a deterrent by itself to instill a sense of awareness so that the other party does not act recklessly.This is kind of a warning.From the president\u2019s point of view, it is a policy where there is nothing to lose if a suspicious person is caught and a warning can be sent even if no one is caught.\u2018Nominally, there is no objection to the fact that the excited students might cause problems at the start of the school year, so the teachers are taking steps to prevent the incident.\u2019They\u2019re not ordinary students, they\u2019re geniuses who use magic, but of course, the scale of thinking is different from the general ones.What new teacher would dare to reject the president\u2019s order? Even in an academy, hierarchies exist. If it\u2019s black, it should be black.For reference, the patrol area I was assigned to was <Magic Training Grounds>.\u201c\u2026This is true.\u201dThe training ground was a place frequented by students to show off their magic skills, so it was difficult not to have any problems.Did she send me here on purpose? I hoped not as I was heading to the patrol area.* * *The magic training ground was not far from the main building. Close enough to reach in 10 minutes on a well-paved footpath.A large structure can be seen through the trees in the moderately manicured garden. The overall design is an exterior reminiscent of a super-large greenhouse.\u2018It\u2019s filthy big.\u2019Even on Earth, the size of the training ground is so large that it cannot be properly viewed. There are three such buildings.They are called Training Grounds 1, 2, and 3 respectively, and Training Ground 3, the largest of these, is also the main stage of Theon Academy\u2019s Event, \u300cMagic Festival\u300d.First, I looked at the nearest training ground 3, and there were no problems, so I passed.There were only a few people at the second training ground that I stopped by after that, and most of them went back to the dormitory after finishing their training.Now, I was just about to check the last remaining training ground No. 1.\u201cHow dare you, such a lowly commoner!\u201dAlong with the high-pitched voice that seemed to tear in octave units, I could feel the magical energy fluctuating inside the training ground.Sensing that my anxiety had become a reality, I immediately ran to the inside of the training ground.When I ran down the hallway and arrived at the handrail of the audience a girl was seen trying to shoot her magic at another girl. The magic she used was\u2013Second-level spell [Burning Thunder].Even if it is a second-level spell, it is a magic that can inflict fatal damage if the opponent is defenseless.\u2019I shouldn\u2019t be late.\u2019I immediately activated a spell. Even though the magic that the student casted was almost complete, with the source code, my 3rd level and lower spells are faster than anyone else.The magic I used is a first-class release magic [Shining Stone]. Just before the student magic was completed by my [Shining Stone] pierced the center of the magic circle and smashed it.\u201cWho is it!\u201dThe student whose spell was destroyed glared at me with an angry gaze.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Since it is so wide and there are as many as three such training grounds, students can freely practice their magic in a spacious space wherever they go.In particular, first-year students who are curious about the prestigious Theon facilities are the ones who use the training ground the most at the beginning of the semester. As a result, it was only the first graders who naturally had minor accidents.The children, who entered the school, heard that they were geniuses wherever they went. Freshmen who have not experienced proper competition have strong self-esteem because they believe they\u2019re the best.As they progress through classes gradually, there will inevitably be conflicts and it was at Training Ground No. 1 where that happened most often.Just like right now.\u201cWhat? Say it again.\u201d\u201c\u2026This is a place that everyone can use freely. I don\u2019t have any reason to leave.\u201dRene frowned as she saw the three students staring at him with contempt.She had her gray hair, which is rare even in the Empire. She visited the 1st training ground out of her curiosity a little while ago and she got into an argument.The reason didn\u2019t matter. They\u2019re just going to use this place, so they told Rene to go somewhere else.She didn\u2019t want to leave since there aren\u2019t that many students using the training ground, and there\u2019s plenty of free space and got into an argument with the three of them, one woman and two men.All of them are children of aristocratic families and among them was a first-year student named Dunema Rommli, the daughter of Count Rommli, she was the one who told Rene to leave.\u201cIf it\u2019s uncomfortable, why don\u2019t you guys go?\u201d\u201cHow dare you talk to me? How dare a vulgar and cheeky commoner talk back to a noble blood like me?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Theon does not divide classes by nobility or bloodline. You didn\u2019t even know about that when you entered here?\u201d\u201cI guess that\u2019s what you guys just want to believe.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, Lady Dunema. That\u2019s why low-ranking commoners can\u2019t do it.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s not for nothing that people say that you shouldn\u2019t be nice to the lower ones.\u201dTwo male students flirt with Dunema from both sides.Rene bit her lip. At first, they didn\u2019t even try to listen to what she had to say because she is a commoner and if she continued to argue with them nothing would change.Rene just turned her back and ignored them, but that action must have properly touched the heart of Dunema, who had high self-esteem.\u201c\u2026\u2026Commoner, how dare you ignore what I say?\u201dCount Rommli was a typical aristocrat who fell in love with the idea of the chosen people and made fun of the common people. And Dunema, the only daughter of such a count, also deeply inherited her father\u2019s inclinations.As she grew up seeing and hearing only such things since she was a child, she had no choice but to become such a character.Dunema thought that she should be the lead role in the academy. She had a lot of great seniors in the second year, so even so, she said that she has to be the most dazzling among these first year students. But everyone who came to Theon was a genius and it was hard for her to adapt.\u2018I can\u2019t do this!\u2019Even taking classes in the same classroom as common people was embarrassing, but she didn\u2019t want to accept the fact that there were students with more talent than her. Nobility should always be lofty and stand above all, for she was the chosen one and the commoners were but her discarded tools to make her stand out.To Dunema, the commoner named Rene was an annoyance. The first time she noticed her was when she was in the classroom.Ash gray\u2019s hair color, which is rare to see around, also drew attention, but it was Rene\u2019s beauty that bothered Dunema more than anything else. She was like a doll made by the goddess of beauty, as if she was not of this world.Her self-esteem was hurt and Dunema could not forgive that. Dunema needed a target for her anger, and the target was, of course, Rene, who evoked these feelings in her, so she quarreled with her.\u2018What the hell is that cheeky attitude?\u2019Rene\u2019s eyes looking at them as if they\u2019re pathetic. Dunema gritted her teeth and glared at the back of Rene\u2019s head.\u2019You dare ignore me and think I would accept it?\u2019Dunema pulled out her wand and lifted it. It happened so unexpectedly that even her two followers did not respond.It was the same with Rene. She never imagined that Dunema would do such a thing in Theon.\u201cHow dare you, such a lowly commoner!\u201dA spell is formed with magic power, and seeds of lightning are splattered around.Rene sensed something and looking back her blue eyes widened.\u2018Stupid. It\u2019s already too late.\u2019A cruel smile formed on Dunema\u2019s lips, she didn\u2019t want to kill but ruin Rene\u2019s face.At the moment when she wanted to shoot the prepared magic into the face of that heinous commoner white flash of light pierced her magic. Seeing the reverberation of the scattered lightning, Dunema contorted her face like a demon.\u201cWho is it?\u201dShe looked in the direction the while flash came from and saw a man looking down from the audience.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dThe moment that voice mixed with subtle anger reached her ears, her skin reacted. That momentum and spirit that made her teeth collide by themselves.Dunema knew who the man was.\u201cMr. Rudger?\u201d\u201cWhile on patrol, I suddenly felt a wave of magical power and came to see it.\u201dHis gaze glances at the gang of Dunema, Rene and the students who have only watched from the vicinity, but have not stopped them.There is no such thing as a fight between students. To be precise, it is an incident where one side unilaterally tried to surprise the other.\u201cIt seems that you don\u2019t take Theon seriously.\u201dRather, if they had fought each other head-on, it could have ended with just a warning.However, arbitrarily launching a surprise attack on an opponent who is not willing to fight is undoubtedly a one-sided negligence injury. The teacher even witnessed it clearly with his own two eyes.\u201cWhat does that mean?!\u201dDunema, already full of anger, cried out in protest to Rudger.\u201cThis is to protect our authority as nobles\u2026!\u201d\u201cAuthority? What authority?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s because this commoner\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIn Theon, all students are equal. Learning, teaching, and magic are only judged by their talent and passion. I don\u2019t care what noble blood you have.\u201dRudger\u2019s words meant not to pretend to be aristocrats here.Dunema bit her lip but Rudger shook his head at the completely unrepentant act. He was convinced that the first graders would cause problems. Rather, it was possible because they were freshmen who did not know about the world yet.Of course, freshmen who don\u2019t know how Theon works, make their decisions based on the environment they\u2019ve been living in. Their narrow way of thinking where they believe that the world they lived in is everything is causing the problems.Just like Dunema Rommli in front of him right now. But not knowing is not an excuse.\u201cIt has not been long since the start of the classes, but you already caused such a big problem, please be aware that discipline cannot be avoided. You follow me right now.\u201dRudger said so and immediately turned his back.I thought that issuing a warning like this would reduce the issue. Of course, it wasn\u2019t just a warning, it was meant to be a real punishment.\u201cOnly a Fallen Nobility\u2026\u2026\u201dAfter the words of Dunema Rommli the training ground, which was still quiet, became even quieter.\u201cDu, Lady Dunema?\u201dThe two students, who could be described as followers of Dunema, were sweating profusely. This behavior was not what they wanted it to see. Even Rudger Chelici, who was about to leave, stopped walking.The faces of the students who watched the situation became pale.Dunema belatedly realized what she said but she couldn\u2019t take back the words that had already been uttered.\u201cWhat did you just say?\u201dRudger\u2019s even more subdued voice turned towards Dunema. It didn\u2019t stop there, but his body floated in the air. As if walking in the air, Rudger slowly descended from the audience, landed on the ground, and slowly walked towards Dunema.\u201cThud. Thud.\u201dWith each step Rudger took, Dunema felt as if the world was collapsing. She didn\u2019t know it when he was far away, but when she met him up close, the pressure that Rudger exuded was beyond imagination.Its appearance was like a giant, she felt that Rudger could crush her with a finger.\u201cAhhh.\u201dWithout realizing it, she said something harsh. Even so, there was something she shouldn\u2019t have said, but she crossed that line. It is no wonder that Rudger was angry.\u201cDid you say I was a fallen noble?\u201d\u201cOh, uh. Ah\u2026\u2026\u201dDunema couldn\u2019t even move her mouth properly as she looked up at Rudger. The atmosphere was almost bloody and it wouldn\u2019t be strange if someone died.\u201cMr. Rudger!\u201dFrom outside, Selina hurriedly ran and called for Rudger to stop. She, too, had just arrived after hearing the news. But as soon as she arrived, all she saw was the figure of Rudger staring intently at a shivering girl.\u2018No way. Perhaps. perhaps.\u2019Anxious thoughts ran through her mind and she hurriedly tried to stop Rudger but at that moment Rudger opened his mouth.\u201cYou\u2019re not wrong.\u201dIt was a completely unexpected thing to hear.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cNow what the teacher said\u2026\u2026\u201dShe thought he would be angry or that he\u2019d give her corporal punishment on the fly.\u201cObviously, I am a fallen nobleman but this is Theon, and I am Theon\u2019s teacher. Dunema what you said was clearly a student challenging the authority of the teacher.\u201dRudger spoke in an infinitely calm voice.\u201cYou are still young and before coming here you were an aristocrat. If it\u2019s your first time, you might not know.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cSo, I will let it go this time but know that there is no next time.\u201dA completely unexpected, yet very mature response.The students had no choice but to stare blankly at Rudger.\u201cOf course, what you did to your classmate will be punished accordingly. I hope that has enlightened you.\u201dDunema felt that the world was collapsing at his words of discipline, but she could not protest. Rudger\u2019s point-by-point remarks were far too rational, to the extent that she thought that doing this was meant to teach her.Rene shrugged at the fact that Rudger had called her name.\u201cAnd you Rene.\u201d\u201cYes, yes!\u201dRene shrugged at the fact that Rudger had called her name.\u201cAre you injured?\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cAre you injured?\u201d Rudger asked again.\u201cNo, teacher helped me so I\u2019m okay.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201dRudger immediately turned his head to look at Selina.\u201cMiss Selina. Please go back.\u201d\u201cAh yes!\u201dRudger left her training ground with those words to Selina.No one dared to move, until he disappeared into the darkness of the hallway.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Intense magical power spread in my mouth with a bitter yet elegant sensation that touches the tip of my tongue.\u2018Whoa. I will live.\u2019As the medicinal energy spreads and magical powers are supplied to the brain, the organ that had been damaged gradually returned to its original state.I sat down on a quiet bench and caught my breath.The first signal came when I stopped at the 2nd training ground. My fingers tremble slightly and my head feels dizzy. It was kind of like a chronic disease after I came into this world.\u2018If it wasn\u2019t for the medicine, it would have been a disaster.\u2019Still, I thought it was tolerable, so I checked up to Training Ground 1 and tried to take the medicine right away but I had to intervene in the freshmen\u2019s fight. No I shouldn\u2019t call it a fight since there was a clear distinction between victim and perpetrator.So I intervened in the middle and managed to prevent things from escalating. Afterwards, while talking about punishment, I felt the wave that had subsided once soared. Feeling my body telling me to put the medicine in my mouth, I quickly settled the situation and tried to leave but there was a problem.Who would have thought that she would boldly say things like fallen aristocrat there? For a moment, I didn\u2019t even know if she was talking to me, and I thought deeply in my head for about three seconds.I wonder if it was something the kid really said, and I had all kinds of complicated and long lines in my head, but my communication skills were poor. But the problem is that after hearing this, I can\u2019t just go as a teacher.\u2018I mean, why did you have to say that at that time?\u2019If I was alone I would have pretended not to hear it and passed it on, but there were too many witnesses around. In the end, in order to protect my authority as a teacher, I had to say something first, but my head did not work well, so there was nothing plausible to say.-Originally, what you did is a clear challenge to the authority of the academy.\u2013 It may be referred to the disciplinary committee according to the school rules.-You may receive a penalty or even get attention from the president.Well, I should have said these basic words, but I couldn\u2019t remember them.\u2018So I just spit out whatever came to mind.\u2019I was trying to manage the expression on my face that almost collapsed while I spoke. Maybe my face was a little distorted. There is a little bit of blood in my eyes.\u2018It won\u2019t be a big problem, will it?\u2019Anyway, Selina-sensei also came, so I succeeded in leaving in a hurry.I got up from the bench, gulping the pills in my mouth. Fortunately, it is an early symptom. If this had gotten worse here, other people might have noticed my weirdness.\u2018Is this the last medicine?\u2019When I saw that the medicine box was empty, I sighed. I put the extra medicine in the pre-mailed bag, but I didn\u2019t know it was going to turn out like this because things went wrong in the middle.\u2018Next weekend, I decided to meet him. To be honest, it seems difficult to hold on until then, so I\u2019ll have to send him another letter and tell him to come earlier.\u2019If not, I have to rent a private medicine room and make it myself, but if I do, it will be recorded in the records, which is a big deal.\u2018I hope nothing will happen until then.\u2019With my head getting clearer, I took a deep breath and set out on patrol again.* * *\u201cAre you okay?\u201d\u201cYes. Thank you for your concern.\u201d\u201cThis is my job.\u201dAlthough she vehemently said that she was okay Selina took her to her infirmary.Selina gave her a warm smile and waved her hand, but Rene was sincere.\u201cThat\u2026\u2026Teacher Selina.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cHow is that kid?\u201d\u201cYou mean Dunema? I\u2019m not sure.\u201d\u201cOh right\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cStill, according to the school rules notified in advance, it wasn\u2019t just a fight, it was a one-sided attack, so I wondered if she would receive disciplinary action even if she wouldn\u2019t be expelled from school.\u201dIt would be better if the academy would give stronger discipline to people with strong self-esteem like Dunema but both of them had a vague feeling that they wouldn\u2019t.She was still a freshman who didn\u2019t know what to do, so the lenient punishment also played a part, but above all else, since her father is a count, they will try to take care of it.\u201cWhy? Are you worried?\u201d\u201cNope. I\u2019m just curious.\u201dTo be honest, I don\u2019t feel sorry for Dunema, who attacked this way. On the contrary, it was surprising that she was not expelled from school for what she did. I was just asking because I was confused.\u201cAre you worried?\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cYour expression is showing it.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026\u201dRene nodded her head slightly.\u201cIt just seems to be more intense than I thought when I came here. I thought Theon was a place full of dreams and ideals.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cBut this time, when I spoke with a noble student, it didn\u2019t seem like that at all. Even though the person who did the wrong thing will be punished, there is no guarantee that something like this won\u2019t happen again in the future.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026yes.\u201dSelina also agreed with Rene\u2019s opinion.In Theon, royalty and commoners are said to be equal, but that was rarely true. \u00a0Even if teachers mediate students as much as possible in a neutral position, there is no way that problems won\u2019t arise when students are alone.Even some aristocratic teachers discriminated against commoners and subtly favored noble students. As a result, some who were proud of being nobles looked down on the teachers just because they were commoners or fallen aristocrats. Dunema\u2019s abusive language to Rudger was an extension of this situation.\u201cThat\u2019s right. To be honest, I also think that was harsh on Mr. Rudger.\u201dRene put her hands on her waist and puffed her cheeks as if she was trying to prove she was mad.Selina smiled softly as she looked at Rene, who had her eyes widened as if she didn\u2019t know what the teacher would say.\u201cBut it\u2019s because Mr. Rudger passed on it. There is nothing more we can say.\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you mad?\u201d\u201cOf course I am angry. I\u2019m trying hard but it must have been Mr. Rudger who had the most complicated thoughts at the time.\u201d\u201cAh.\u201dRene remembered the expression Rudger had made at that time. A shadow was cast on her face so she couldn\u2019t see well, but she must have been terrified.After she met those eyes, Dunema\u2019s face turned white. Rudger was originally a terrifying teacher, but she couldn\u2019t imagine how terrifying he would be if he was truly angry.Even so, Mr. Rudger offered to take care of her Dunema\u2019s mistake only this time. \u00a0He must have been angrier with himself than anyone else.It\u2019s not just about surrendering to the other\u2019s family and passing on it. Rather, it was more of a mercy for educating a student who was truly in need.Sure enough, Rudger had consistently looked at her with her cold gaze. There was no way that a person who showed such an attitude would have resigned from the authority of the other person\u2019s family.When he admonished Dunema, he frankly told herself that she was right. Rene looked at him and was completely surprised.\u201cSo I\u2019m going to try to believe it too. She must have done something wrong, but we\u2019re still young students, aren\u2019t we? I think there is an opportunity to change.\u201d\u201cAh.\u201d Selina scratched her head.\u201cHehehe. Sorry. Did I talk too much like an aunty?\u201d\u201cNo. Teacher Selina is also young enough. I would have called you sister if we had met outside.\u201d\u201cOh, thank you for the compliment. Rene is a good kid.\u201dSelina herself would think she was getting older, but in Rene\u2019s eyes, she was so young that if she wore her school uniform, she would only look like her senior.She is beautiful and always smiling, Selina has already been the object of adoration by some boys but she\u2019s not really aware of it.In the first place, I wonder if the mid-20s are that old.\u201cYes. Sister~. That\u2019s a good word. I wish I had a younger sister like Rene.\u201d\u201cI wish I had an older sister like Selina.\u201d\u201cReally? Oh my, you\u2019re pretty.\u201d\u201cHehe. Then, can you give me a little more points for the Elemental Studies class?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019ll depend on how hard you work.\u201dSelina smiled and returned Rene\u2019s prank.\u201cThe time has already come. I\u2019ll go look around the rest of the patrol area. You have to tell me if there is something wrong with your body.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dSelina waved and left the infirmary.She was left alone, and Rene looked at her body and thought she was fine, so she got up from the bed.\u2018By the way, Mr. Rudger called my name.\u2019When she used the training ground, she wore comfortable clothes because she was afraid that her uniform would get dirty. Naturally, back then, she didn\u2019t have a name tag, so no one knew her name. \u00a0But Rudger Chelici called her name naturally.\u2018Did you remember my name after one class?\u2019For Rudger Chelici, she\u2019s just one of 80 students, and a commoner who doesn\u2019t even need to be noticed. Still, Rudger remembered her name.Suddenly, she remembered what he said to Dunema.\u2018In Theon, everyone is equal.\u2019Like throwing a stone into a calm water surface, those words ripple through Rene\u2019s mind.If he had only said it but didn\u2019t mean it Rene would have been disappointed but Rudger didn\u2019t. \u00a0Through his actions and his unshakable convictions he instilled hope for a fair Theon.\u2018My first impression was obviously that he was a scary teacher.\u2019As a new teacher, I didn\u2019t expect much when I took his first class. However, I was surprised by the innovation of source code that Rudger showed.Even after Flora\u2019s actions he mediated the situation, he ended up warning the student even though he had been insulted.The figure that suddenly appeared and saved her in a moment of crisis was momentary, but it was like seeing a prince riding a white horse in a fairy tale. Involuntarily, her heart was pounding.\u2018No. Mr. Rudger probably didn\u2019t care just about me.\u2019I\u2019m here to learn magic, not for dramatic encounters.* * *After the incident at Training Ground No. 1, nothing unusual was found on the patrol, so I was able to return to my dormitory with peace of mind.When I got home, I immediately sent a letter to him. It was difficult to wait until next weekend, so he had to come earlier.The reply came back early in the morning.What was written on the inside was simple. The task at hand was finished earlier than expected, so he was going to come immediately.The meeting point is in the factory area beyond the eastern commercial district of Leathervelk. I wrote the letter, thinking that it would be a suitable place for people not to see.\u2018Today is Friday. Tomorrow is Saturday, so one day should be enough.\u2019It\u2019s the first weekend after the start of the semester, so the students may be excited, but will the same thing happen as the day before?With that in mind, I heard a strange story from Selina, who was having lunch with me.\u201cWerewolf?\u201d\u201cYes, werewolf.\u201dRumors about a werewolf began to circulate in Theon.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 20": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Academy\u2019s Undercover ProfessorCH 20Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayC20: Abraham Van Helsing (1)Teacher Selina, who was smiling brightly today as well, nodded her head at my question.\u201cYes. Rumors have already spread among the students. Werewolves exist only as urban legends. Is it funny?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cNo matter how many geniuses there are, I think they are still students. You don\u2019t have to care about such a joke.\u201dSelina laughed bashfully saying that the students\u2019 imaginations were so cute, but I couldn\u2019t help but sigh.It is said that the first source of the rumor was students who had gone out to the nearby city of Leathervelk the day before. At sunset the first eyewitness saw a black shadow gliding across the roof of a building through the night mist that subtly descended.I shook my head.\u201cAren\u2019t they still children?\u201d\u201cYes. Still, it was a little strange to hear that the werewolf that was seen outside the city was also seen in Theon.\u201d\u201cIn Theon?\u201d\u201cDid the children in the city spread the word, so the students inside the school saw something and thought it was a werewolf?\u201d\u201cTheon is so wide and since it is a place where all kinds of magic are spread, it is said that there are cases where strange phenomena occur due to magical powers. There really are 7 ghost stories, right?\u201d\u201cAre you talking about the 7th ghost story?\u201d\u201cYes. Did you not know?\u201d\u201cMs. Selina is well aware of ghost stories.\u201d\u201cYes Yes?!\u201dThese were just words of praise, but for some reason, Selina-sensei overreacted a bit. Her eyes widened and her cheeks flushed pink. Her hair stood up as if it had swelled a little.When she looked at me wondering why she was reacting like that, she hurriedly said as if making an excuse.\u201cI was just thinking about what topics would be good to have conversations with students\u201d\u201cOkay, calm down.\u201dSeeing her arms swaying to and fro, it felt like if I made a mistake, she might bump into a plate and spill food.\u201cNo. Not really.\u201dHowever, Ms. Selina continued to make more desperate excuses as to whether she felt something impatient in my attitude.When I thought our meal was unlikely to continue as it is, Ms. Merylda, intervened.\u201cAh. Come to think of it, Mr. Rudger, I heard that you did quite splendidly during your first class, is that true?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cIt is said that I showed a groundbreaking magic that increased the speed of spell casting. What did they say the name was?\u201d\u201cSource code!\u201dSelina also forgot her embarrassment, turned on the lights in her eyes and shouted. Due to her loud cry, a momentary but silence lingered in the teacher\u2019s dining room.Selina realized her own mistake and bowed her head. Her earlobes, exposed through her pink hair, were dyed bright red.I sighed a little and nodded my head.As I nodded my head in agreement, eyes flew in from all directions. It was the gaze of the teachers who were eating at the other table.As I was wondering why, Ms. Merylda came closer and explained it to me so that I could hear it.\u201cIt\u2019s because everyone is interested in Mr. Rudger\u2019s magic,\u201d she said.\u201cMy magic?\u201d\u201cOh. Are you pretending not to know? Mr. Rudger had already shown his magic in his first class, and rumors spread within Theon.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201dI put a piece of meat in my mouth and figured out how things were going.\u2018Are they interested?\u2019From the first day of class, I vaguely guessed that it was going to be like this.From the point of view of the people of this world, the source code borrowing the 21st century computer programming method would be truly innovative. It was fully expected that the ripple effect would surely reach other teachers as well.\u201cI heard that it dramatically shortened the speed of spell casting. Is it true?\u201d\u201cYes. That\u2019s enough to make a lot of money by filing a patent to the tower.\u201dSelina responded as well.Well, to say the least, it\u2019s not wrong. Source code will become a wind of change in the now stagnant magic society. In fact, if I provide this kind of magic to the tower that has a magic patent system, I will be able to sit on a cushion of money.\u201cI don\u2019t care about that.\u201dI pretended not to be humble, but I know better than anyone that it is better not to apply for a patent.For those who do not yet know what it is, providing a newly developed magic to the tower would be a great thing, but the reality is a little different. There is definitely a magic patent system in Magic Tower.Wizards who lack money want to make money using such a patent system, but such a good appearance is only superficial. Even a patent becomes a patent only if it is properly recognized by the tower.The problem is that most of the magic that is submitted as a patent is usually hit with all kinds of excuses in the Magic Tower.\u2018I\u2019d rather just make excuses. There are many people who would abuse this.\u2019Other new teachers may still have a positive perception of the tower, but I have a different perspective because I have already experienced how dirty and degrading the tower is.Indeed, even if those old judges developed a new magic that could not be criticized, the problem still exists.\u2018If you don\u2019t have a supporter or the backbone of an aristocratic family, you will be robbed of the magic to be patented.\u2019Or, if a person is dissatisfied with the tower and does not apply for a patent, he may be dragged into a back alley and forced to give up the magic.Actually there was such a case.In other words, the patent system used by the tower is nothing more than a fake with no reputation. Knowing that, I did not dedicate my magic to the tower to make money.\u2018At least, Rudger\u2019s status is better now.\u2019Although he is a fallen aristocrat, he is currently working as a teacher in Theon, so it is not bad in terms of awareness. However, even with such a status, if I\u2019m careless, my nose will be cut with my eyes open.A stagnant place where greedy old men are rampant it\u2019s like gooey mud.In any country, such a place is disgusting and deliberately showing the source code in Theon was an act that involved some calculation.First, spread the word to the students and tell them that the groundbreaking magic source code was invented by Rudger Chelici.Rumors among students spread will to the teachers, and even among teachers, rumors will spread to the outside of Theon. That\u2019s how it\u2019ll get into the ears of the tower.For a person to go in with their head bowed first and apply for a patent, it is a mistake, however, when the other side approaches me because they are anxious about the appearance of a new magic, then our positions are reversed.And the status of the Rudger will rise even higher. He is a teacher of Theon with considerable talent, rather than a new teacher who has nothing.If you have a business card like this, they won\u2019t be able to ignore me easily. It will take some time, but there is nothing better to solidify my position.\u2018But the problem is that other teachers are turning their eyes to me.\u2019Selina and Merylda are fine because of their good personalities, but the other teachers have been blatantly jealous of me. In particular, Chris Benimore\u2019s eyes, one of the teachers who joined at the same time as me, seem to have the magma seeping in his eyes.I\u2019ll kill people with those eyes.\u201cI\u2019m sorry though\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be sorry for showing it to students first.\u201dI turned around like that and got up from my seat.\u201cI will go first. I have my next class.\u201d\u201cAh yes! Work hard!\u201d\u201cGoodbye~.\u201dI nodded my head lightly to the two teachers who greeted me, and then quickly walked out of the teacher\u2019s dining room.* * *Merylda narrowed her eyes as she looked at Rudger as he left. From the first time she saw him, she thought he was a great man, but after talking to him a while ago, she realized for sure.\u2018Instead of revealing it to the tower, he kept it secret until now and showed it in the first class.\u2019From Merylda\u2019s point of view, Rudger\u2019s behavior was not like a wizard these days. Because he is too cold-hearted, he lacks a lot of empathy, so he is selfish and lacks consideration for others.In the world of magic now, even a master who should teach someone does not trust his pupil. She felt desperate because she had also been through a similar situation.But what about Rudger?Although he possessed that great magic, he did not show off his skills around him. And what\u2019s even more surprising is that his magic was used in front of the students.\u2018No matter how young the students are, if you show them how to use magic, some savvy people might catch it.\u2019Doesn\u2019t that guy even worry about losing his magic? There are only two reasons for doing this. One, the magic is too difficult.\u2018Or.\u2019I determined that it doesn\u2019t matter if I lose it.\u2018Ah, maybe.\u2019But it wasn\u2019t until then that he showed the dignified attitude he showed when he ate a little while ago.That can\u2019t be the explanation.\u2018This kind of person is a new teacher like me.\u2019The more she thought about it, the more humble she felt. Merylda sighed and turned to her side. \u00a0Selina, her classmate and close friend stared blankly at Rudger\u2019s departure.\u2018I\u2019m pretty obsessed with this one too.\u2019After Merylda shook her head, saying she couldn\u2019t help it, she immediately smiled mischievously and tapped her fingertips on the nape of her Selina\u2019s neck.* * *The Saturday after the theory class.At noon, when the sun was shining brightly, I went to Leathervelk, a city near Theon. First of all, it was nominally a simple walk to see the nearby city, but in reality, it was because I had a prior commitment.The appointment is in the evening, but there is still plenty of time left. I came out earlier to see what Leathervelk was like.\u2018The city itself looks pretty cool.\u2019Leathervelk, a city with advanced engineering, is a huge city with more than 500 km of Ramzier River flowing through its center.The flowing rivers and countless railroads on the ground were blood vessels that instill the vitality of the city, and the people living in it are full of vitality.Leathervelk, which has become the center of all kinds of commerce, magic, and engineering, has earned the reputation of being the most developed city because it is adjacent to Theon Academy.I walked through \u2018Center Pod\u2019, the main street of Leathervelk. Unlike other districts, here, gentlemen and ladies in suits were quietly enjoying their leisure time.Center Pod, a place that symbolizes the revival of Leathervelk. This is a residential complex inhabited by the wealthy, the trees were beautifully carved, and steam and golem wagons roamed every road.I sat on the terrace of a secluded cafe and drank coffee. Even on weekends, the subtle scent of coffee beans that permeated the quiet cafe and the scent of the coffee I drink mix to evoke a strange mood.\u2018That\u2019s cool.\u2019It is a beautiful place and I want to live in a place like this at least once. It is natural to have such a thought.\u2018A house is definitely expensive.\u2019I got up from my seat, paid for my coffee and I headed to the next area.\u2018Grand Chapel\u2019 is the downtown area most frequented by people in Leathervelk. A huge white cathedral in the Gothic Revival style stood tall. It wasn\u2019t just the downtown area but it was full of all sorts of things that I had never really seen before.Machines that emit white steam from external combustion engines made of brass and mechanics that work on those machines.Children playing with small clockwork toys.People on the street playing accordions, cellos, and violins, and citizens dancing while listening to the music.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dAs I wandered around the city like that, the sun was setting.\u201cDang. Dang. Dang.\u201dHuge clock towers towering all over the city rang the bells announcing that it was 6 o\u2019clock. Since it was early spring, when there were still traces of winter, the sun set early and the air that touched the skin quickly cooled.I fastened the front of the black coat I was wearing and headed to the meeting place.So far, I have only seen the beautiful appearance of Leathervelk, but the place I go this time is the opposite. Shadows cast clearly under intense light. It was a place called the ugly bare face of this city.Pushing the wide-brimmed hat on my head even deeper, I walked through the mist rising from the waters of the Ramzier River.When even the clouds of blazing scarlet flames drifted westward, and the dark blue skies covered the entire city of Leathervelk I stood in front of an alleyway in the factory area where there was a thick fog.There is no one here. Street vagrants also gave up begging and returned to the depths of the alleyways, and children coughing harshly and working to earn a living went home.I am the only one hereThe scarlet light from the street lamp collides with the fog and scatters haze. In that empty stillness, I leaned my back against the smudged bricks, waiting for the person I was supposed to meet.\u2018I came early and you\u2019re late.\u2019Just as I was thinking about it, I heard a sound from the back of the alley where I was leaning.\u2018Creepy.\u2019It is a sound that a human vocal cord can never make.I turned my back from the wall and looked into the alleyway. A pair of red eyes appeared from the inside of an unknown space where gray mist and black darkness were half mixed.\u2018It\u2019s true.\u2019I remembered Selina words from the previous day in the dining room, the rumor that the students saw werewolves. She went on to say that it was just a ghost story, but looking at that now, I wondered what she would think.At that moment the being in the dark rushed forward in an instant. I stared at it and immediately raised my fist and slammed it on his head.\u201cKoo!\u201dScreams spread briefly in the fog.I looked down at the guy sitting in front of me.\u201cWhy are you late, are you trying to play with me?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time.\u201dSaying that, the guy who pats his aching head with his hand is the acquaintance I was going to meet, and can be called my subordinate.\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time, Hans.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time, older brother.\u201dHe was the one who spread rumors of a werewolf among students.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Call me Rudger Chelici.\u201d\u201cYou mean Rudger Chelici? Ah. Come to think of it, that was the name that sent me the letter. What the hell happened? Why aren\u2019t we meeting in the capital where we were originally supposed to?\u201d\u201cIt is long to explain. Rather\u2026.\u201dRudger glanced at Hans and shook his head.\u201cEven now an accident happened. What kind of bullshit is that?\u201d\u201cDamn it. Who wants to be like this?\u201dHans\u2019s current appearance resembled that of a werewolf and anyone who would see him on the street would scream and run away.It\u2019s dark now, but if they saw this in broad daylight, people would have felt puzzled rather than running away because Hans\u2019s appearance did not have the ferocity characteristic of a werewolf. To be precise, he even had a cuteness that did not match his size.\u201cWhat bit you this time?\u201d\u201cA brown puppy in the arms of an old woman suddenly ran up to me and who knew she would bite me?\u201d\u201cLooking at your expression I can roughly tell what happened.\u201dHans, half-human and half-beast, has brown hair. However, rather than the dark and dull color of a wolf roaming the wild, it is closer to the conspicuous bright side.Above all, the shape of the face is very different from that of a wolf. A little shorter than the long head of a wolf, with a short mouth and bright eyes.Its appearance was very similar to the [Pomeranian], which is famous as a cute pet dog. The hairy puppy that bit him was a Pomeranian.\u201cI\u2019ve felt it for a long time, but you are born with a very interesting constitution.\u201d\u201cDamn it. Don\u2019t laugh at someone else\u2019s business. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve been cursed or anything.\u201dHans is a human born with a slightly unusual constitution. That is, when an animal bites him, he changes into its form and right now he looks like a werewolf.\u2018However, it\u2019s a flaw that it\u2019s different from a normal werewolf.\u2019Werewolves, as the name suggests, only transform into wolves during a full moon, but Hans did not. Hans remains normal even when he sees the full moon, but only forcibly mutates when bitten by an animal.It can be said that Hans, who can change in this way, has quite a lot of power, the problem is the timing.\u2018In today\u2019s advanced age of civilization and science wolves, tigers, and bears are found only in the mountains.\u2019And the precondition that he can only change through bites is absurd.As a result, Hans said that the animals he could easily encounter in the city were stray cats, wild dogs, or pet dogs kept by the ladies.It even overlaps with the problem of whether his unique constitution is working in some way, or whether the animals rush to him when they see Hans.If Hans is a little careless, he will get bitten by a small beast and forcibly transformed into a half-human and half-beast.Hans\u2019 powers are different from magic and closer to supernatural powers.\u201cTake it.\u201dRudger took an injection ampoule of green reagent from his pocket and threw it at Hans.Hans hastily grabbed the ampoule with both hands and put it directly into his forearm with a happy face. Then immediately a change occurred.The hair that had grown on the body decreased, and his size that had grown was gradually reduced. The bright and cute Pomeranian face also changed into a man with a slightly mean look.Hans, who returned to normal, touched his body here and there, and sighed in relief.\u201cWheeyu. If it wasn\u2019t for the hyung, I would have been struggling for a few more days.\u201d\u201cIf you think about it, yes.\u201dIt\u2019s been quite some time since Rudger met Hans. At that time, Hans could not control his constitution, so he was called a monster and was being pursued.Still, if he had the power to turn into a beast, he could act as the king in a back alley, but he was a guy who couldn\u2019t fight by nature, so he just wandered around to avoid persecution.Meeting Rudger at that time was the fortune of a lifetime for Hans.\u201cI almost died when we first met,\u201d he said.\u201cI thought you were a cryptid wandering the city.\u201dCryptid refers to a monster that appears in various parts of the city now that real monsters have disappeared. These guys can be seen as the remnants of monsters.Compared to monsters that exist in reality, it was more of a supernatural phenomenon. Demon beasts, spirit beasts, and other strange beasts or beings shaped by negative emotions in response to magical powers.The reason Rudger sought Hans was because he received a cryptid subjugation quest. But when he first met Hans, Rudger was quite embarrassed to realize that he was not the werewolf he had envisioned.Hans at that time was half-human, resembling a Chihuahua.\u201cI was quite surprised to find out that you were a human being who could speak properly.\u201d\u201cWere you surprised by that? I was even more surprised by your behavior, who developed a cure so quickly.\u201d\u201cIt is not a cure. It\u2019s more like a neutralizer.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201dHans snorted.Rudger nodded as he did not deny it.\u201cRather than this, your pseudonym is Rudger Chelici. Are you also a teacher at Theon Academy? When the hell did you change your identity as Rudger Chelici? It sounds like you blew it up a bit. Do you know how surprised I was that you suddenly became a teacher at Theon?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a long story.\u201dStarting with the terrorist train attack, Rudger explained how he became a Theon teacher.After hearing the last words, Hans couldn\u2019t help but burst into laughter.\u201cPu ha ha ha! Big brother is great. How could you say you were Rudger there?\u201d\u201cIf I wanted to live, I had to.\u201d\u201cIf it were me, I would have considered it rather suspicious. Rudger is even a member of a mysterious secret society?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s an executive called First Order.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026.First Order.\u201d\u201cDo you know anything?\u201dHans patted his chin and fell into anguish. It was his habit when he was trying to think of something.\u201cHmm\u2026I think I\u2019ve heard of it. No, I definitely remember. Have you ever heard of the recent uproar outside the Empire?\u201d\u201cNot yet.\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s completely recent, so you might not know. They say there\u2019s been a bunch of new guys lately that are pretty strong and crazy. They grade their members by Order.\u201d\u201cIt seems you are certain. What is the name of the organization?\u201d\u201cSome call it the Black Dawn.\u201dRudger pondered the name. Those with whom he was associated were certainly not normal.They planted that many people in Theon and assassinated members of the academy to hide their identity.\u201cDo you have any more information about them?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s so recent, I don\u2019t know the details. All I know is the name of the organization and its ranking. But now you\u2019re the First Order there?\u201d\u201cIt was a situation where I was wearing the mask of the guy who was originally the First Order.\u201d\u201cYou were lucky enough to get over it, but if you make a mistake, it won\u2019t be noticed, right?\u201d\u201cFor now.\u201d\u201cIf caught, you will be tortured in ways beyond your imagination.\u201dRudger grunted and rummaged through his pockets.\u201cSo I have to be prepared.\u201dRudger, who took out the medicine box, was about to eat the medicine inside, but realizing that he had eaten the last yesterday, extended his arm to Hans.\u201cMy bag.\u201d\u201cAh. I brought it here.\u201dHans immediately took the black suitcase hidden in the dark alley and handed it to Rudger.Rudger checked if his luggage was in good condition.\u201cYou open it?\u201d\u201cAm I crazy enough to open your luggage? Even if I wanted to open it in the first place, I couldn\u2019t.\u201dHans shrugged and denied Rudger\u2019s half-joking and half-serious words.Rudger opened his suitcase and looked at all of his personal belongings inside him. It was the same as when he put it in after organizing it before sending it off.Rudger took out two pills from the vial and popped them into his mouth.Hans looked at Rudger with a slightly pitiful gaze.\u201cBrother is suffering too. Now that I think about it, both brother and I are in a position where we have to live on drugs.\u201d\u201cUnlike drugs, it doesn\u2019t have any side effects, so it\u2019s a shame.\u201d\u201cSo, what are your plans for the future? You must have been restrained a lot because of your new identity.\u201d\u201cI will have to think about it later.\u201dOriginally, I had planned to use Theon power to suppress them or sabotage their plans, but that alone felt insufficient. It is too optimistic to hope that Theon will take care of the Black Dawn.It was necessary to move a little more actively and uproot them.\u201cHmm.\u201dRudger, who was about to lock the suitcase that had been opened, suddenly remembered something and asked Hans a question.\u201cHans. If you had already arrived here two days ago, why did you ask me to wait?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cRumors of a werewolf appearing spread all over Leathervelk, even in Theon, there was someone who saw you.\u201d\u201cYes? Older brother, what do you mean? I came to Leathervelk today.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dRudger asked the question without realizing it.It was the same with Hans.\u201cThere were rumors of a werewolf in Leathervelk? Before I came?\u201d\u201cI thought it was you.\u201d\u201cNo, I came today and you know my personality too. If I had come yesterday, I would have asked to meet you right away.\u201dThe two were speechless for a moment. So, who the hell is the werewolf in the rumor that is spreading now?\u201cOoooooooo!!!\u201dAt that moment, a cry was heard from beyond the misty darkness. There was no way the two men present could not hear the cry of this iconic beast.\u201cOlder brother.\u201d\u201cHuh.\u201dRudger leaned his back against the wall and looked around him. The sound of something moving fast along with the harsh breathing in the wind resounded in his ears a little.\u201cA real werewolf.\u201d\u201cYou mean it wasn\u2019t a rumor, it was true?\u201d\u201cMaybe.\u201dAt that moment, Rudger and Hans lifted their heads at the same time and looked up. Above the high roof, just then, a black shadow could be seen passing swiftly across.A black-haired beast shed blood-red traces of its eyes in the air. The foul odor peculiar to the beast filled their nostrils.\u201cCrazy, it was true\u2026\u2026 Brother, shall we leave for now? I don\u2019t think he recognized us right away.\u201d\u201cIt is only a matter of time.\u201dWerewolves were moving around quickly but it didn\u2019t go far. He was roaming around the factory area, wandering here and there.The bastard is now looking for his prey.\u2018I thought there was something on the werewolf\u2019s neck.\u2019When the werewolf appeared in an instant Rudger\u2019s eyes pierced the thick fog and scanned his body clearly. What caught his attention in particular was something similar to a dog tag on the guy\u2019s neck.\u2018Is belonging to someone he ate? No. Rather, it was more like a restraint, a leash.\u2019Maybe I saw it wrong. It was such a fleeting moment, so I might have misunderstood something. However, the fact that that werewolf had appeared in Leathervelk and the rumor had spread to Theon was caught up in the news.\u201cHans. I\u2019ll have to check it out.\u201d\u201cAre you sure? Are you going to catch that werewolf?\u201dRudger said so, picking up items from his suitcase one by one.He wore a leather belt around his waist and the multifunctional belt was full of empty holsters. Rudger put all the objects one by one into the empty slots on the belt: throwing weapon, melee weapon, vials of reagents and finally, two revolvers. Rudger quickly checked his guns, and then crossed them onto his back.Rudger finished by wearing gauntlets with mechanical devices on both forearms.Watching Rudger put on his gear one by one, Hans remembered the first time he had met him.\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve seen brother use it.\u201dAlthough all kinds of equipment were added, Rudger\u2019s appearance did not change. As such, the tools they are using now are very secretive.\u201cIt\u2019s the same equipment you used as a cryptid hunter? You used a pseudonym even then?\u201d\u201cI did.\u201d\u201cWhat was that name? Brother has to use a lot of pseudonyms and I can\u2019t remember it.\u201d\u201cVan Helsing.\u201dRudger, with all his gear, closed the suitcase and stood up. A shadow fell on his face, with his hat pressed down deeply.\u201cAbraham van Helsing.\u201dIt was the name Rudger once used as a hunter.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I finally made up for the missed releases.5 years ago Durman Kingdom, one of the small and medium-sized countries in the southern part of the continent, suffered from a headache due to the sudden infestation of cryptids.The nightmare continued for over a month, with wolves roaming in the middle of the city, bizarre beasts devouring people every night, and the smell of blood lingering for more than a month.Even if the soldiers and knights were put in, the cryptids flirted with the knights and avoided their encirclement. The situation escalated without a solution.Among them was one of the most infamous Cryptids. It was a monster who was active in J\u00e9vaudan, one of the major cities of the Durman Kingdom. This guy was a rare monster that ate three knights who could be called elite soldiers. It was J\u00e9vaudan nightmare, and the worst cryptid that reigned as the kingdom\u2019s terror.King Durman sent out an official announcement that he would give a huge reward to those who subdue the Cryptids and all kinds of freelance wizards, wandering knights, and famous mercenaries from the continent that had heard the rumors gathered in the Durman Kingdom and started a massive cryptid subjugation operation.Countless cryptids have died, and many hunters have died as well. People called the hunt at that time \u2018The Bloody Night\u2019 because the blood that was shed at that time stained the ground red.The Bloody Night was enough to establish the reputation of many people. At that time, there was one man who left the greatest achievement. \u00a0A person who defeated the most notorious monster in J\u00e9vaudan alone, and achieved the highest killing record for other Cryptids.He was neither a famous wizard nor a famous high-ranking knight, nor an elite mercenary, he was just a hunter.The hunter was adept at handling all kinds of tools and weapons, and for a year after Blood Night, he traveled all over Durman, killing more than three digits of Cryptids.The name of the hunter who is also famous for not revealing his identity was \u2018Abraham van Helsing\u2019.* * *Rudger, fully equipped, walked slowly to the side of the road.A damp night mist fell over the coat. Around the street lamp, a hazy scarlet light spreads dimly, as if it drank water from the mist. The stench of the beast, which secretly wafted through the smell of the mud, brushed the tip of his nose.\u2018It\u2019s a memory.\u2019\u201cBang!\u201dRudger immediately kicked a drum blown in the street with his foot.\u201cKudang!\u201dAs the drum collapsed, an intense noise echoed through the air. The werewolf, who was searching for his prey, heard the sound and turned his head. Those ferocious eyes found Rudger standing alone in the center of the boulevard.\u201cCrung.\u201dThe werewolf jumped from the roof of the building and got down in front of Rudger.\u2018Big.\u2019Rudger was able to take a closer look at the werewolf. His height was about 2.5m or more, his eyes were blood-drenched and his body was full of black hair.He had sharp claws on both hands, which were so eerie that the anticipation could be felt through the skin. But most of all, what caught the eye was the metal restraint ball on the werewolf\u2019s neck.\u2018I wasn\u2019t wrong.\u2019There is no way that a beast that has lost its sanity would wear something like that around its neck.\u2018Someone purposefully raised or created that werewolf.\u2019I didn\u2019t think it was impossible. This is a world where magic exists and science has developed in a strange direction, even Hans, whom he knew, has the constitution to change into a beast when bitten.Even if a secret organization made a werewolf as a test subject, there was nothing strange about it.\u2018The question is, why now?\u2019So far, there has been no news, but the incident happened not long after the opening of the Theon Academy? And in the year he took office? He couldn\u2019t help but be suspicious of such a situation.\u2018Well, if I catch him, I\u2019ll know.\u2019Rudger immediately took a stance.The werewolf contorted his face, presumably displeased when the man in front of him rather than running away was confronting him.\u201cOoooooooo!!!\u201dThe werewolf let out a roar and rushed towards Rudger. A werewolf, who sprinted through the ground on four legs, was faster than a car.Rudger watched the movement and slid behind him. The werewolf\u2019s claws cut through the air in the spot where Rudger had been a while ago.The werewolf swung its arms non-stop but Rudger continued to back step and concentrate on dodging.As soon as the tip of Rudger\u2019s brown shoe touched the ground, a strange wave spread out around him.With each miss of the werewolf\u2019s attacks, Rudger continued to pound the ground with his toes, spreading waves of his magic. In an extreme situation where even a single touch could shred his bones, Rudger never allowed the werewolf to hit him.\u201cWooooo!!!\u201dThe werewolf roared and spread his arms wide. He was going to attack him in that state and hold him so he couldn\u2019t escape.Rudger\u2019s mouth, which had been covered by the brim of his hat, smirked, the werewolf, who was about to run to Rudger, suddenly contorted his face and fell to his ground.\u201cUh, huh?\u201dHans, who was watching anxiously from afar, suddenly opened his eyes wide and puzzled to see the werewolf collapse.\u201cIt will make your head pound a bit.\u201dRudger gently trampled the werewolf\u2019s back.Werewolves are more like beasts than humans. And since it is part of the canine family, it is particularly sensitive to high frequencies that ordinary people cannot hear. Rudger prepared such a magic while dodging the werewolf attack.A magic that properly mixes sound waves and vibration magic is okay for humans, but if used on werewolves who hear sounds beyond a certain band. \u00a0Even now, the werewolf\u2019s ears are ringing in real time and the ultrasonic waves are still shaking the surrounding area.\u201cThere is no need to use expensive silver or the like.\u201dThere was no more suitable method than this, since the purpose was suppression and not killing in the first place.Now, let\u2019s check where the hell this guy was made.It was at that moment when Rudger pulled out a syringe and was about to draw his blood.\u201cBeep!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s here! Here comes the sound!\u201d\u201cEveryone, move quickly!\u201dWith the sound of a whistle, uniformed police officers rushed towards them from beyond the fog. The police, who had been patrolling because of rumors of a werewolf from two days ago, must have come to hear the commotion here.\u2018At this time.\u2019At that moment when Rudger had lost focus for a moment, the werewolf, who had been quiet, jumped to his feet.Rudger hurriedly stepped back and was wary of the werewolf\u2019s counterattack, but the werewolf had no interest in Rudger in the first place\u2026The guy shook his head a few times, then turned his back and ran away.\u2018This.\u2019Rudger sighed, dispelling the high-frequency magic that had spread around him.As police officers carrying his magical powers appeared one by one, Rudger decided that he had to step down.\u201cThere! There is someone over there!\u201d\u201cArrest all suspicious people!\u201dAt some point, the werewolf was climbing up the walls of the factory to the roof, Rudger ran after him.As Rudger was going through the dark alleyway, he felt the werewolf\u2019s presence receding and stretched his arms out into the air. The mechanical mainspring under the gauntlet\u2019s wrist turned quickly, and then a wire hook shot towards the roof.The moment the hook was fixed to the roof railing, the gears rotated and the wire was wound at high speed Rudger used the recoil to fly to the roof. Commonly called wire launcher, it was the favorite object of Rudger when he was active as a hunter.Rudger landed on the roof.After pulling the wire to retrieve the hook, Rudger found the back of a werewolf running away in the distance.\u2018I won\u2019t let you escape.\u2019Rudger put magical powers around his legs. In this world, magicians also use magic to strengthen their bodies in case of unforeseen circumstances.Rudger kicked off the roof with enhanced leg strength and followed the werewolf. The night scenery of the factory area passes quickly and the figure of the werewolf running away in the distance could be seen gradually getting closer.While running, the werewolf looked back at something strange and found Rudger chasing him, spurring the speed of his escape.The werewolf, who had been skipping non-stop between the roofs of the factory, jumped down onto the large railroad tracks below. At that moment, a freight train loaded with magic stones was passing underneath.The werewolf landed rough on the cargo hold. Rudger didn\u2019t want to let him escape so he jumped on top of the cargo hold as well.Rudger lightly patted his shoulder with his hand, staring at the werewolf. Realizing that he could no longer run, the werewolf got up and looked back at Rudger.On top of the train, Rudger and the werewolf faced each other about three meters apart. The hem of Rudger\u2019s coat was blown away by the strong wind as the train ran.\u201cAt first, I was just trying to capture you but now I changed my mind.\u201dMy vision was blurred for a moment as the night wind brushed my cheeks and the steam from the train\u2019s head. Through the gap, the werewolf rushed towards me.A fairly sharp movement that takes advantage of the blind spot and pierces the opponent\u2019s loophole, however the werewolf rushing towards Rudger stopped at the strange noise ringing in his ears. It was a kind of instinctive intuition he had as a beast.That judgment was correct as something sharp swept past the werewolf\u2019s neck at both ends.\u201cIt feels good.\u201dIt passed through the skin of the werewolf\u2019s neck, spinning and returning to Rudger. It was a boomerang with sharp blades spread out like a fan and if he had been a little late, the sharp circular saw blade would have cut the werewolf\u2019s throat.The werewolf quickly regenerated the wounds running down his neck. He was furious at the fact that he had been hurt, and veins sprouted from his body.\u201cI was going to finish it in one shot.\u201dRudger put his regrets behind him and took out a wand hung from his waist and held it. This time it was Rudger\u2019s turn to run.He holds a staff in his right hand and uses his left hand to gather magical energy to use [Shining Stone] and fires it straight like a bullet at one of the werewolf\u2019s eyes.\u201cSwish!\u201dThe werewolf bowed his head straight away and avoided the [Shining Stone]. At that moment, Rudger snapped the index finger of his left hand and the [Shining Stone] that passed by the werewolf turned in mid-air and hit the werewolf in the back of the head.As the werewolf panicked by the intense pain he felt in the back of his head, Rudger ran up to the werewolf and swung his staff towards his face with all his might.The werewolf tried to block it with both arms but a saw-bladed boomerang flew and pierced the werewolf\u2019s hands. The boomerang was thrown in advance by Rudger.The werewolf caught the staff with his mouth and his eyes curved like a crescent moon. The moment the wound on his arm would be regenerated, he was thinking of tearing the cheeky human right in front of him but as if to ridicule the werewolf\u2019s inner heart, Rudger made his next move.The handle of the staff was pulled and a pure white sword came out of it. The sight was so unexpected that the werewolf did not even think to drop the empty shell of the staff he had bitten in his mouth.Rudger\u2019s body rotated once in place and a white line was drawn in the air. The light that was so thin but clear cut the werewolf\u2019s neck softly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Seriously, I almost got caught.\u2019Hans, carrying Rudger\u2019s suitcase, walked slowly down the dark alleyway, avoiding the eyes of the police who suddenly came to the scene.He arrived here today, but didn\u2019t get lost because Hans already had a map of Leathervelk in his head.\u2018You went to catch a werewolf. When are you going to come back?\u2019As he was thinking, something fell in the air in front of Hans. It was the head of a giant wolf that rolled to his feet.Hans shrugged his shoulders, pinched his lips, and desperately resisted the screams that were about to escape.\u201cAre you surprised?\u201dIn the darkness of the alley opposite, Rudger slowly walked out. Shoes and leather pants together with white shirt and a brown leather vest over it along with the long drab coat on the outside, and the hat on his head.\u201cDamn it, older brother when you show up, talk to me! I almost dropped your bag!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s good you didn\u2019t.\u201d\u201cIs this the werewolf? Well, it\u2019s not that I\u2019m ignoring my brother\u2019s skills, but I didn\u2019t think you could catch this terrifying guy in that situation.\u201dAfter checking the dead werewolf\u2019s head with his tongue sticking out, Hans shook his body and handed the black suitcase to Rudger. Receiving it, Rudger turned his back and walked forward, Hans followed him.\u201cCan I leave that as it is?\u201d\u201cI do not need it anymore.\u201d\u201cNo, then why did you bring it?\u201d\u201cYou were surprised.\u201d\u201c\u2026Did you still have in your heart what you were trying to scare your brother in the alleyway?\u201dWhen Rudger was silent, Hans sighed and raised his hands.\u201cI lost, so let\u2019s not do that again in the future.\u201d\u201cLook at what you\u2019re doing.\u201dThe two of them got out of the alleyway and came out onto a busy road where passersby could be seen to some extent.\u201cSo what the hell was that werewolf just now? Was it really cryptid?\u201d\u201cNo. It was an artificially created test subject.\u201d\u201cExperiment? I\u2019ll have to take care of myself because the people who made it are here.\u201d\u201cAnyway, I have something to tell you about that.\u201d\u201cWhat to say? I am suddenly very anxious right now, can I not listen?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cOh, okay! Say something.\u201d\u201cI have to move ahead with what I originally planned.\u201d\u201cOriginal plan? No way\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI think this is better than the capital.\u201dRudger tossed two pockets at Hans.Hans took them and checked the contents. One was full of gold coins and the other was his beast neutralizer.\u201cOlder brother. This\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cShouldn\u2019t we settle down too?\u201d\u201cIn this place where the secret society, Black Dawn, might exist? Even in a big city, there are gangs in the back alleys.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll try.\u201d\u201cYou have plenty of money, so try hard.\u201d\u201cOlder brother?\u201d\u201cFirst of all, I am a teacher, so I can\u2019t move freely. The president is still suspicious of me.\u201d\u201cSo now you want me to do this all by myself?\u201dRudger shook his head.\u201cFirst of all, it is important to gather important information. Who are the gangsters and the mafia in this city, and how the backstreet world flows. And how can I get a seat there? Find out and tell me.\u201dHans, who understood what Rudger was saying, swallowed his saliva, then smiled and nodded his head.\u201cThat is my specialty.\u201d* * *Returning to the dormitory of the academy, I unpacked all my belongings. I\u2019ve left Hans alone to gather information for now, but he\u2019ll be fine, his ability to gather information is unmatched.\u2018I will have to develop my own power in case of an unexpected situation.\u2019I can\u2019t move right away, so I decided to just prepare.The president is still suspicious of me, and I\u2019m not sure exactly what the secret society, the Black Dawn, is up to, so moving prematurely is counterproductive.Having simply finished organizing my belongings, I sat down on the comfy sofa and replayed the events of the day.\u2018That werewolf wasn\u2019t a pure Cryptid, but someone deliberately created it.\u2019The existence of werewolves is no surprise. Monsters existed in this world as well, and they were driven out beyond the shadow barrier, which is now outside the continent, but their traces still remain.Cryptids are a prime example of this. These beings, subspecies of monsters, are now more like urban legends or ghost stories from non-ideal occurrences of magical powers rather than real monsters.The werewolf I caught this time is also a type of cryptid, but to be precise, it\u2019s just a fake.\u2018Experiments and witchcraft to create werewolves have existed since ancient times.\u2019There is a cursed potion made by adding various medicinal substances to the water with wolf paws and mixing it with wolf\u2019s fur, a transformation potion that allows ordinary humans to turn into a beast by drinking it. Of course, this is black magic.Black magic is banned at the national level, so the death penalty is unconditional regardless of the reason for being caught.\u2018But how dare you make such a werewolf openly. Seeing that there is even a mark as a test subject, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s at the level that some power has touched it.\u2019Judging from the leash, did they capture a wild wolf and mixed it with human factors? The marks of restraints, as well as the traces of various experiments engraved on the corpse of werewolf were clearly the result of science.Potions that corrupt humans and transform them into beasts are the exclusive domain of warlocks that have almost disappeared. That\u2019s where science intervened.\u2018Someone deliberately insisted on it.\u2019If so, who is it? In order to make a subject of that level secret, it requires a fairly large laboratory of the public eye. Space, confidentiality, and even experimentation, considering all that, means that a big hand who can provide a huge financial line is involved in this work.Aristocrats, or millionaires.\u2018There are people in the Empire who are rich enough to be suspicious.\u2019I shook my head. I don\u2019t know who might be suspicious, but since I\u2019ve killed the werewolf and collected my serum, I won\u2019t need to worry about this anymore.It\u2019s a long weekend, and I don\u2019t want to get involved in troublesome work anymore. Tomorrow is Sunday, so let\u2019s take a good rest.\u2018More than that, I have to prepare for the next class.\u2019There are so many things to deal with, it hurts my head.* * *Monday morning marks the beginning of a new week after a peaceful Sunday.After eating a light toast and coffee for my breakfast I went to work in my private office in the main building. Class is tomorrow, but first of all, as a new teacher, I have to show myself to go to work because that\u2019s social life.After sitting at the desk in the office, I opened the newspaper I brought from the dormitory.\u2018\u2026\u2026What the hell is this?\u2019On the front page of the newspaper that came out this morning, there was a single headline engraved.[An unidentified killer appeared in Leathervelk!]\u2013 Last Sunday, there were 5 additional deaths in Leathervelk. This brings the total number of deaths to over 10. The identity of the perpetrator has not yet been revealed, but eyewitnesses say it is a terrifying beast with black hair. Police have announced that he is just a maniac murderer and will be arrested soon, but citizens are still terrified.\u2018What is this?\u2019I read and read the article on the front page of the newspaper. This was, after all, the werewolf incident that I killed Saturday but the newspaper said the deaths were on Sunday.\u2018At that time, I definitely stopped his breath. And yet, when there are new victims, does that mean that there wasn\u2019t only one?\u2019There was a moment when I felt that things were going to be strange.\u201cBeep! Beep!\u201d The translucent crystal ball placed on the work table began to flash with a strange sound. I know what this is.\u2018The president calls.\u2019Precisely, it\u2019s a kind of signal for teachers to gather.\u2018I have to go.\u2019I got up and put my coat on the hanger. Suddenly, I remembered what Ms. Selina had said during the meal last Friday.She said there were testimonies from students that they had seen a werewolf even inside the academy.\u2018Victims in Leathervelk, even eyewitnesses within the academy.\u2019Even if I excluded the one I hunted, the number of remaining werewolves is at least two, maybe more than that.Trying to put away such anxious thoughts, I headed to the conference hall where the teachers were gathered.The conference hall, located on the upper floors of the main building, was full of teachers. Each of them is clearly competent in the field they teach.As I entered, people\u2019s eyes turned to me. Most of what was in their eyes was curiosity, but I know that it wasn\u2019t for me, it was for the source code I invented.\u2018Mr. Rudger here!\u2019In that corner, I could see her familiar pink hair swaying. Seeing Ms. Selina waving her hand towards this side, I headed towards her.\u2018Is that person Rudger Chelici?\u2019\u2018I heard he invented some pretty cool magic, is that true?\u2019Among some teachers, there were quite a few people who looked at me hostilely, as I was a fallen aristocrat. Their hostility and jealous gazes were quite stinging, but I simply ignored them.As I sat in an empty seat next to Selina, she greeted me.\u201cDid you have a good weekend?\u201d\u201cI had a good rest. Did Selina have a good rest, too?\u201d\u201cYes. I also took a really long break. Did you hear the news? Last night, two first-year students were attacked by a gangster and were seriously injured.\u201dAfter listening to Selina\u2019s explanation, the situation was like this.Last night two first-year students returning to the dormitory after going outside the academy were attacked inside Theon. It was not life-threatening, but it was a serious injury, and it was a great shock that this happened even inside the academy.One of the students who just woke up this morning said that a terrible beast attacked him.\u201cThe werewolf rumors that have been around since last week must have been true. It is said that victims have also appeared in the nearby Leathervelk.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dIt is difficult to dismiss it as simply seeing something in vain, and it is said that the wounds engraved on the victim\u2019s body are like being scratched by an animal.This is probably the reason why they gathered all the teachers this time. First of all, the contract said that the teachers of Theon had to work with all their might in case of emergency.That would mean that it would be difficult to calm the situation with only internal guards or users.\u2018If the opponent is a werewolf, it would be much better to send elite teachers than to pour in mediocre manpower.\u2019Being a teacher at Theon doesn\u2019t mean just teaching students in a normal way.\u201cThe president is coming.\u201dWhen the woman, who looked to be in her mid-fifties with wrinkles on her face, spoke, all the teachers they were conversing with became silent.I looked to see who it was, and Selina explained it to me.\u201cMiss Marie Ross. She\u2019s been in office for over 20 years. Her field of teaching is pharmacy.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dShe held her position for more than 20 years? That is to say, she has great powers. As she stepped forward to sort out the situation, the other teachers kept their mouths shut.\u201cThe president is coming.\u201dThen the door opened and the president entered. She always looked beautiful. In addition to the alluring golden eyes, the two-tone hair of white and light pink naturally catches people\u2019s eyes.\u201cGood morning everyone. The reason I called this urgently today is because I have something to announce to you all.\u201dThe president went straight to the main topic without wasting time.The mention of the rumored werewolf caused a stir among teachers as well.\u201cIt cannot be. President, have you misunderstood? Cryptids in Theon.\u201dIt was a greedy middle-aged man who appeared to be in his mid-50s who stood up blatantly. He had his oily, turbid blonde hair neatly parted 2 to 8 and grew up to his mustache. It\u2019s like seeing an old-timer that exists in every school. However, when he appeared, the atmosphere of the meeting room changed strangely.\u201cAnything you want to say? Mr. Hugo Burtag?\u201d\u201cThis is Theon, a place that is protected by the Exilion Empire. I think the students made some kind of mistake by believing the ghost stories that were floating around.\u201d\u201cMr. Hugo, didn\u2019t I just tell you there were two victims?\u201d\u201cI know, the victims were both children of noble families so I don\u2019t think there is a werewolf.\u201dHugo Burtag took a glance at the crowd.\u201cI think the culprit is a student of Theon, this is commonplace.\u201d\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d\u201cOtherwise, of the many students, only the children of the aristocracy have been injured. Werewolves attacked this Theon? Rather, it is far more credible that some students deliberately pretended to be werewolves and started the case.\u201dThose words certainly had some plausible persuasive power, but I had to feel something instinctively offensive by Hugo\u2019s words. He\u2019s just trying to take the president\u2019s words and pass the fault of this case on to certain students.I looked at the atmosphere and nodded inwardly.\u2018Ah. I guess I get it.\u2019As long as Theon is an organization, the existence of factions within it is inevitable. Students are divided into commoners and nobles, but what about the teachers?The reality is that teachers, too, have a subtle current between teachers from commoners and teachers from aristocrats.Chris Benimore, a new teacher, refused to eat with me since I was a fallen aristocrat.\u2018I thought the Black Dawn would be at a disadvantage, but I guess that\u2019s not the case.\u2019Rather, I would not have known if Hugo was the only one who thought like that but, there were quite a few people who subtly agree with his opinion.The aristocratic teachers were united and a faction was formed. And that faction didn\u2019t seem to get along very well with the president\u2019s faction. Even if we all work together, it\u2019s not enough for such a conflict to exist.As I was wondering about Theon actual situation, a tiny bug crawled up the wall and climbed onto my shoulder. The moment I threw it down with my hand, I couldn\u2019t help but stop. It wasn\u2019t a worm but a small, thin piece of paper in the shape of a worm.Fortunately, the others haven\u2019t noticed yet. I grabbed it naturally and checked the contents so that others wouldn\u2019t find out.It was fortunate that most of the teachers\u2019 attention was focused on the nerve war between the president and Hugo.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAfter checking the contents, I pressed my finger on my slightly stinging forehead.[Three test subjects escaped. Immediate capture. If not, remove them.\u201d]I will quickly find out who sent this message and who was behind the creation of this werewolf. But the most important thing was the last sentence.\u201cThere is a risk that the person\u2019s identity will be exposed if the subject material is stolen.\u201dWhy are you giving me such an ordeal?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, the escape of a werewolf was probably unexpected, given that I was given the order to remove him if capture was not possible.\u2018The problem is that if caught, Black Dawn will be severely damaged.\u2019If they take a hit, that\u2019s good news for me but the problem is that my identity might be revealed. In other words, Rudger Chelici has something to do with the creation of the werewolf.You need to catch all 3 of them. No, now there are two. In other words, I have to find and catch the werewolves before Theon, and then kill them.\u2018By the way, the werewolves had a mark.\u2019Perhaps the mark itself has something to do with the guys who did the experiment. The problem is that Rudger Chelici has something to do with it in some way.To be honest, if this had nothing to do with me, I would have just left it to Theon. But if I\u2019m involved here, it\u2019s a different story. If caught, I die.\u201cMr. Rudger, is something wrong?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201dI shook my head in response to Selina\u2019s question.First of all, it was confirmed that there were three werewolves. I got one, so there are two left, one in Theon and one in Leathervelk.\u2018I have to hunt them down.\u2019Meanwhile, the war between the president and Hugo was almost over.\u201cWell, it\u2019s up to you to act like that, Mr. Hugo. However, I hope that the given task will be handled seriously.\u201d\u201cSo you are going to strengthen patrols?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not just that. We as teachers cannot sit still until the number of victims increases, and above all, late at night when all the students go home.\u201dAt that, Hugo had an annoyed expression on his face. Rather than worrying about the student, he seemed dissatisfied with the fact that a person his size had to go around patrolling.However, the incident has already occurred, and the seriousness of the situation is also recognized by other teachers. Even Hugo was in a position that he could not openly oppose.\u201cThe teachers should warn their students not to run around late at night. It doesn\u2019t matter if you give a penalty point for any violation of it. This is an instruction given by myself as the president. Do you understand?\u201d\u201cAll right.\u201dAfter the meeting, the teachers got up from their seats and dispersed one by one.I also got up and tried to go back to the office, but some people blocked my way first.\u201cAre you Mr. Rudger Chelici? Nice to meet you. My name is Daniel Masrak, the astrologer.\u201dIt was obvious why they approached me, the greed in their eyes said it.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m busy, so I\u2019ll go first.\u201dI immediately dismissed their interest and left the meeting room.* * *Instead of heading straight to my office, I moved to a less crowded warehouse.\u201cCome out.\u201dIf it was the guy who sent me a message in the meeting room, he would have been waiting for me to come out. It is not possible to convey all of your wishes in a few lines of messages, so there must be something he wants to say.As I was afraid to speak, I could feel a shriek from behind the pillar, and then someone stuck his head out.\u201cI\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cTell me.\u201dIt was the Dark Dawn\u2019s member who tried to approach me after I joined Theon.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cThat, so\u2026\u2026\u201dShe was visibly embarrassed, not knowing that she would ever see me again. Then she revealed herself completely behind her pole, and I was a little surprised to see her in Theon\u2019s uniform.Maybe she was a student here. The reason most Black Dawn members are hiding as users is that the student\u2019s identity cannot be so easily manipulated.In order to enter this place, you need to have the talent or skills to pass the entrance exam, if you don\u2019t know anything else.At the time of our first meeting, she wasn\u2019t even wearing a uniform, so I didn\u2019t know she was a new student.\u201cJust move on. Follow me.\u201d\u201cAh yes.\u201dI took the lead, and she followed.Something came to my mind, so I looked back at her and asked.\u201cDo you like coffee?\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d* * *We sat facing each other in a quiet cafe. She had been shrugging her shoulders for a while, not knowing what to do.I glanced at her. White skin and dense facial features, with voluminous brown short hair and a slightly delicate physique. I can\u2019t see her ears and her bangs are long, that are about to cover her eyes. She literally looks like a little squirrel.I shouldn\u2019t have threatened her so much the last time we met. I took a sip of the hot coffee placed in front of me and placed it aloud on the table.Just right.\u201cHey!\u201dShe shrugged her shoulders as the coffee cup and table made a sound.\u201cName.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t ask you twice. Name.\u201d\u201cSedina Rosen.\u201d\u201cIs that your real name?\u201d\u201cYes Yes.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that a pseudonym?\u201dThis is surprising, having a surname in this world means that you are not a commoner, but a higher class. Noble, priest or the wealthy.Why would someone who grew up in such an environment where there was nothing lacking, had enough talent to enter Theon, but was only the lowest third order, join a secret society?\u2018No. On the contrary, the more you come from a family like this, the less you may be treated.\u2019The strangest part is that there are only third-orders with this kind of talent. Well, I\u2019ll ask about that later.I flicked my fingers lightly.\u201cTell me exactly what happened without missing anything.\u201d\u201cUh, I\u2026\u2026around\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI used voice-blocking magic. Even if we scream here, the conversation won\u2019t leak out.\u201d\u201cVoice blocking magic? W, as expected, First Order-nim.\u201dIt was really strange that she kept calling me First Order. No, to be honest, it\u2019s uncomfortable.\u201cFirst of all, you need to change the name. Don\u2019t call me First Order from now on.\u201d\u201cYes?!\u201dAt my words, Sedina opened her eyes wide.\u201cI am now a teacher at Theon and you are a student.\u201d\u201cYes Yes.\u201d\u201cFrom now on, call me Mr. Rudger.\u201d\u201cHow can I be disrespectful\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cIt is an order.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dWhen I said strongly that it was a command, she nodded, saying she understood. However, as opposed to being mournful, her lips kept trying to rise because she was happy that she was allowed to call me by my name.\u201cSo what is the situation?\u201d\u201cOh, yes. I\u2019ll explain everything. The recent werewolf incident happened in our Black Dawn, or to be more precise, in an affiliated organization that has teamed up with us.I was momentarily taken aback by the sudden change in her tone of voice, but I naturally nodded.\u201cKeep talking. Every detail, without omission.\u201d\u201cFactions exist within the Black Dawn, as the First\u2026Mr. Rudger, knows. In particular, Victor Dreadful, another First Order-nim, was the one who worked hard on this project.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dActually I don\u2019t know anything. I pretended to know everything, and responded to her words.Victor Dreadful, I\u2019ll have to remember this name.\u201cThe Shamsus School, which was created by gathering scientists expelled from the Society for conducting unethical experiments with the warlocks of the back alleys, engaged in Cryptid Experiments as they did before.\u201d\u201cExactly what kind of experiment did they focus on?\u201d\u201cOnly a few people know that, so I\u2019m up to that point\u2026\u2026 Oh, and by the way, when Victor asked Mr. Rudger to help him, he lent him his name.\u201d\u201cHe only lent me his name. I never knew it would come this far.\u201dFrom the reaction, it seems that Rudger was quite close with the person named Victor, but it has now become poison.The Shamsus School must have studied the cryptids, and the subject eventually escaped, that\u2019s what\u2019s happening now.\u201cAt first, it was their fault, so we had to let them take care of it, but in the end, one of the escaped subjects hid in Theon through the sewer pipe.\u201d\u201cSo there must have been a victim the day before.\u201d\u201cYes. This was something that our Black Dawn never expected.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cOh, sorry. I talk too much\u2026\u2026When I get excited, I often make this mistake. Um, like me\u2026\u2026\u201dSedina Rosen\u2019s attitude changed noticeably and passively, perhaps because she thought my stare had a different meaning.I immediately shook my head.\u201cNo. Unlike the stuttering when we first met, you were surprisingly good at explaining, so I just admired it.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cYou are surprisingly good at talking. Could you explain more? It was good to hear.\u201d\u201cI, really?! Yes! All right!\u201dSedina continues the explanation as soon as I throw a few words of praise.I sighed in relief, if she stops explaining, I can\u2019t figure out any more information. Now I had to pull out everything I could pull out while I was in Sedina\u2019s respect by putting on a shell called First Order.First of all, Sedina Rosen is the lowest third order member in the Black Dawn, but her own abilities are quite outstanding. From gathering information to continuing the explanation, the conversation itself is quite smooth, without interruption.The note I received must\u2019ve been sent through one of her secret spells. But why is someone with this level of ability only a 3rd order?First of all, the fact that Sedina has a surname means that her family is a pretty good place.\u2018Reaction that causes rejection when she says her last name in her self-introduction. That is, she doesn\u2019t like her family. Rejection? Resistance? Something much bigger than that?\u2019The problem is that she must have joined the Black Dawn of her own will, but it didn\u2019t seem that way to the other members.She may be a spy, or she herself is a character with a screw loose somewhere, so she probably didn\u2019t get along well with the other members.\u2018Secretly sending a magic note to me, gathering information quickly and even entering Theon. Her position is low compared to her superior ability. The organization wants to throw her away after using her?\u2019Sedina herself must be passionate enough to swear allegiance to the Black Dawn by devoting her body and soul, but the organization itself doesn\u2019t like her. She tries hard but her situation doesn\u2019t improve and she gets bogged down further.\u2018From the standpoint of the Black Dawn, I\u2019d like to have it for now, but I\u2019m hesitant about how to use it.\u2019The First Order that she\u2019s under doesn\u2019t care about her. Maybe she\u2019s just trying to use it like a consumable item for a mission that requires her life to be thrown away. Her future was already decided.\u2018Will a Second Order take care of her?\u2019I just saw a crack in Theon for the first time at the previous meeting and now I could also see one in Black Dawn. There is no perfect group in the world.\u2018Maybe this\u2026\u2026\u2019Knowing that Theon and Black Dawn both have significant problems felt like a way out for me. Hopefully I can get something through Sedina.\u201cOnce you capture the specimen, it is better not to leave any evidence behind. Capture is a priority, but in the current situation there is no other choice but to get rid of them as quickly as possible. Since there are three, we can do our best\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cNo. Two.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dI took out the werewolf restraint orb from my inner pocket and showed it to Sedina.\u201cThis is\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cOne guy was already caught.\u201d\u201cDamn, when\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cTwo days ago in Leathervelk.\u201dPerhaps she didn\u2019t know that I had already caught one of the three, so her face went hazy.\u201cFirst Order-nim.\u201dShe has a very respectful expression.\u201cAnyway, are there two left now?\u201d\u201cYes, yes.\u201d\u201cYou said that one hid here through a sewer pipe, so we will have to widen the search around that area. Theon doesn\u2019t know this information yet, right?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201d\u201cThen I must move right away.\u201dI said that and got up from my seat. Sedina looked up at me, wondering if I was already finished, but I thought she was rude, so she immediately bowed her head.I unblocked the sound barrier and said,\u201cSedina Rosen. See you next time if you have a chance.\u201d\u201cYes Yes! That\u2026\u2026Rudger, sir.\u201dSedina blushes shyly while she speaks. Looking at it this way, she just seems like a young girl of my age. How did such a child somehow end up joining the monstrous organization called Black Dawn?\u201cThen.\u201dI left the cafe after emptying my coffee.* * *Flora Lumos was going to study at the library leisurely because it was a public class today.In her usual way she would have pranked someone today but she recently found herself unable to sit still because a teacher ignited the magical will within her.As she thought so, she was walking through an outdoor corridor lined with arched columns.\u2018Huh?\u2019Through the glass window on the second floor of a cafe not far away, she saw a familiar face, Rudger Chelici. But there was something strange about the man\u2019s attitude.\u2018Who\u2019s the girl on the other side?\u2019Now, Rudger, who exudes a softer feeling than usual, was talking to a girl face to face.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 25": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Academy\u2019s Undercover ProfessorCH 25Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayC25: Black Dawn (2)Chapter 3/3 for the week.\u2018What are you two talking about now?\u2019Rudger was having an in-depth conversation with a girl. At least that\u2019s how it seemed. However, no matter how much I paid attention to my ears, I could not hear the conversation between the two of them from far away.If that had been the case, Flora would have just thought that Rudger was giving students career advice or talking about lectures but she saw that a strange magical field was spread around Rudger and the girl.\u2018What is that? Magic? Does the field block out the sound?\u2019Flora Lumos has a secret she hasn\u2019t told anyone.The reason why she was able to keep the title of genius even in Theon was because she has a peculiar constitution called <Synesthesia of Mana>. She could feel the \u2018color\u2019 and \u2018smell\u2019 of mana.Most people perceive mana or magical power itself only as a visual thing but Flora also senses color. She sees a well-crafted magic recipe as a picture, and also feels the scent of delicious cuisine.Born in an aristocratic family, she is very sensitive to such things, so she can easily find the difference in her manners even a little more than anyone else. It doesn\u2019t harmonize with other colors in particular, and it splashes out, or the stench mixes between the good smells.Naturally, when she feels the right magic, she sees it with a completely different sense from other people. Like the colors floating around Rudger now. The magic that spread almost around Rudger was perfect.It was far away, so I couldn\u2019t feel the smell, but the color of magical power was very clear through the glass window of the terrace.\u2018What the hell are you talking about?\u2019I was curious. If he was an ordinary teacher I would\u2019ve ignored it but I couldn\u2019t help but wonder since it was Rudger.\u2018Shall I just pretend it\u2019s a coincidence and go?\u2019After thinking that far, Flora shook her head. Isn\u2019t that too deceitful?\u2018Absolutely not!\u2019Rudger was a wall she had to overcome.On the first day, how much insult she felt in front of everyone. Of course, there was no dispute about her defeat. The source code that Rudger showed off was so strong that she had no choice but to lose.\u2018Still\u2026\u2026It was something strange.\u2019When Rudger performed the source code magic, Flora\u2019s first sensation was visual pleasure and sweet fragrance that cannot be expressed in words. In particular, the source code magic unfolded by Rudger was like looking at a beautiful painting in which countless silver and gray metals were densely and firmly woven together.Because of her unique constitution and talent, Flora felt boredom towards magic but source code shown by Rudger, rekindled her passion.\u2018One swipe\u2026\u2026\u2019The moment Flora is about to move.\u201cFlora? What are you doing here?\u201d\u201cDamn?!\u201dAt the sudden voice coming from behind, Flora stood up and was surprised. Looking back she saw that her best friend Cheryl was looking at her with a questioning gaze.\u201cCheryl, what\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? It was Flora who told me to study together in the reading room.\u201d\u201cAh, ah right. I did?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Are you really okay?\u201dCheryl gave her a subtly worried look. It\u2019s already well known that Flora was mistreated on the first day of class. Because of this, some students, who had always regarded her with respect, ridiculed her.\u201cYes? Just~. Nothing.\u201d\u201cWhat is there? I think you were watching.\u201d\u201cNo no. It\u2019s not like that. Come on, let\u2019s go study.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201dFlora pushed Cheryl and headed for the library. Still, her gaze did not fall from the second floor of the cafe far away.* * *Having obtained information from Sedina Rosen, I left her a message that I would see her next time, and went back to my private office right away.I hung my coat on the hanger and sat on the comfy sofa, stroking my chin.\u2018Let\u2019s organize everything first.\u2019There is a place called the Shamsus School, where warlocks and mad scientists join hands. It was them that made the werewolf as a test subject.Although it is a separate group from the Black Dawn, they are still allies for now. One of the Black Dawn executives, Victor Dreadful, joined hands with the Shamsus School.From Sedina\u2019s explanation, I guess she was in charge of research within the Black Dawn.\u2018The problem lies with the Shamsus School.\u2019The three werewolf subjects that the Shamsus School had secretly experimented with had escaped. I don\u2019t know the exact location of the lab, but if I look at the riots in Leathervelk, it\u2019s probably in the vicinity.If the werewolf had been captured as soon as possible at the beginning of the incident, rumors would not have spread in the city. There were even deaths, so it is impossible to simply cover it up.One of the werewolves even sneaked into Theon and put two students in the hospital. It is fortunate that there are no fatalities in Theon, but the problem is that the situation is out of control.\u2018It\u2019s their fault, so it\u2019s right to tell them to take care of it, but the problem is that the Black Dawn gave some support for this Shamsus school experiment.\u2019My Rudger Chelici identity is also involved in this and if other members are captured I might be caught as well. I want to survive, I have to catch the werewolves before everyone else.\u2018For now, my priority should be to get rid of the werewolf hiding inside the academy.\u2019At the same time, security patrols have been strengthened. Aside from the existence of the werewolves, it is certain that there are monsters wandering inside Theon, so the teachers will patrol until late at night.No one would be surprised if I got rid of the werewolf here.\u2018I thought I quit my job as a hunter a long time ago.\u2019Five years ago, I ended my blood hunt and practically retired because I was too famous. Of course, I used the pseudonym of Abraham van Helsing in order not to reveal my true identity. However, after hunting the J\u00e9vaudan cryptid, I became so famous that more and more people tried to approach me so I retired and changed my identity.\u2018I changed my identity so many times.\u2019The last identity I used was Gerard, a wealthy middle-aged man with a lot of money. It\u2019s a fake life, not the real thing, but I didn\u2019t feel that I was particularly dissatisfied or frustrated. Was it because I was reborn in this world after I died once?Little by little, my perception of life and death became different from that of others.\u2018Even so, I don\u2019t want to die again.\u2019I\u2019ve already died once, so I don\u2019t want to die again. If possible, I wanted to live longer and more comfortably. But there were things that had to be done in order to do that.Heading to the imperial capital this time was part of that but the train attack changed my life forever.\u2018For now, let\u2019s focus on catching werewolves.\u2019This must be dealt with first before anyone else finds them. I shook my head as to how to catch the werewolf.* * *Rumors of a werewolf among Theon students were like a hot potato.Even the students, who had dismissed it as just a rumor, accepted the existence of a werewolf when they heard that there were two injured students this time.Naturally, the teachers had to suppress the curiosity and vigor of such students as much as possible.\u201cStudy! What nonsense are you believing? You\u2019ll have an exam today, so focus on it!\u201d\u201cEveryone, this is patrol reinforcement week, so please go home as soon as the sun goes down. If you get caught walking around, you will be penalized.\u201dSome students, who were timid at the teacher\u2019s warning, thought that they should return to the dormitory immediately after class, but there were not a few students who did not.Naturally, the stronger the child, the more they want to do it when told not to do it.\u201cAren\u2019t you curious about the werewolf?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s do this.\u201d\u201cWhat? Haven\u2019t you heard that there is a penalty point for staying late outside?\u201d\u201cThink about it. If we catch a werewolf, wouldn\u2019t the school reward us for doing well?\u201d\u201cThen what if we get caught by the teachers before we find the werewolf?\u201d\u201cWe can\u2019t get caught!\u201dThere was even an official notice in the newspaper stating that if a werewolf was caught in Leathervelk and a reward was published.First-year students, who have not yet tasted the bitterness of the reality that they are not that great in Theon, dreamed of becoming a hero by hunting the werewolf.\u201cAidan, what do you think?\u201dLeo asked, looking intently at the students who were clamoring for what to do with the bounty they would receive after catching the werewolf. At the same time, Aidan, who had finished writing a formula on the magic board, asked when he heard the voice calling him.\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cWeren\u2019t you listening?\u201d\u201cWhy? What did you ask?\u201d\u201cWhat do you think about the werewolf incident?\u201d\u201cOh, that?\u201dAidan laughed softly.The teachers told us to be careful, so I guess we should just do it. If we get caught, we\u2019ll receive a penalty point.\u201d\u201cI thought you would say that.\u201d\u201cLeo, are you?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not the type to particularly like to go out. If there are going to be victims in the first place, this is something teachers should take care of.\u201dA female student approached the two of them while they were having a conversation. Her red hair was tied in large ponytails and her sharply raised eyebrows were of a very attractive beauty. She stood in front of Aidan\u2019s desk and pounded her table with her palm.Leo had a reaction like, \u2018That woman is here again\u2019, but Aidan was different. He smiled brightly and greeted her girl, who was staring at them.\u201cHi Tracey. Good morning.\u201d\u201cGood morning?\u201dThe girl who received the greeting, Tracey Friad, wiggled her eyebrows at Aidan\u2019s greeting.Leo sighed in response.\u201cIf you lost against Aidan then, isn\u2019t it time to stop?\u201d\u201cLost? It was a draw. I haven\u2019t been able to properly settle with Aidan yet and this is mine and Aidan\u2019s business. Would you mind not interfering?\u201d\u201cUgh.\u201dLeo shook his head.It wasn\u2019t long ago that Tracey Friad approached Aidan. The trigger happened during a real magic battle. Aidan, who didn\u2019t know anything yet, got into a match with Tracey, and that\u2019s where the relationship between the two began.The situation was favorable for Tracey, but the problem was the unusual magic that Aidan possessed.\u201cLet\u2019s fight again with all our might.\u201d\u201cUh, huh? That, well.\u201dThe match then ended in a rather ambiguous result of a draw, but Tracey could not accept it. In order to revive the now-defunct Friad family Tracey has always done her best to study magic and worked hard.She wanted to be the best in the first grade, in fact her admissions grades were in the top five. However, the fact that she could not win a proper victory over a commoner hurt her self-esteem.\u201cIn the evening after class.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Tracey, I don\u2019t think I can do it today.\u201d\u201cThen tomorrow!\u201d\u201cTomorrow too\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy!\u201d\u201cBecause there is a werewolf out there and we can\u2019t be active at night. If caught by the teachers, we\u2019ll be penalized.\u201d\u201cUgh.\u201dAt Aidan\u2019s excuse, Tracey folded her arms, and then a smirk crept across her lips.\u201cAre you using that as an excuse to run away from me? I know everything. Are you scared?\u201dCaught by this, Aidan said,\u201cYes. Okay. Then like that.\u201dAidan didn\u2019t want to fight with his friend\u2014even though he would vehemently deny Tracey was his friend\u2014so he decided to surrender.Tracey raised her eyebrows and shouted into Aidan\u2019s face.\u201cI will win Aidan!\u201d\u201cYes? What?\u201d\u201cIf you can\u2019t fight, can you do something else?\u201d\u201cNo, so that\u2019s\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWerewolf.\u201dWhen the topic came up, Aidan and Leo looked at each other and then stared at Tracey again.He was already worried about what kind of absurd proposal she would come up with.\u201cLet\u2019s say whoever catches the werewolf first wins the bet. How is it? Are you sure you won\u2019t be scared and run away?\u201d\u201cNo\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cOkay. I will do it.\u201d\u201cLeo?!\u201dAidan tried to say no because it was dangerous, but instead he was astonished at Leo\u2019s action, which intercepted his words.\u201cGreat! The loser grants a wish to the winner!\u201dTracey replied \u2018Of course!\u2019 to Leo\u2019s provocation and left the room.\u201cLeo. Why did you suddenly accept such an outrageous offer?\u201d\u201cIdiot. If you don\u2019t do it there, she\u2019s sure to annoy us again. So, I gave it a fair shot and passed it on. Look, she left right away now peace has come.\u201d\u201cStill\u2026Lying is bad. I don\u2019t even care about the werewolf in the first place.\u201d\u201cYou idiot. Is that the problem now? After all, the teachers will take care of the werewolf. We just have to stay still.\u201d\u201cUnless she\u2019s an idiot, she wouldn\u2019t do such a reckless thing on her own.\u201d\u201c\u2026 No way.\u201dAidan and Leo looked at the back door of the classroom where Tracey had disappeared at the same time.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dNo matter how reckless you are, you can\u2019t do something like that.\u201c\u2026No way?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m afraid so.\u201dTracey was the kind of person who would do anything.The two of them looked straight out the window. There, they saw the familiar red hair sprinting and heading somewhere. The direction was on the opposite side of the women\u2019s dormitory.It was in the direction of a dangerous forest where teachers had warned never to go at the beginning of the semester.\u201cSomething has happened.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I was not wrong.\u2019Rosen, a family that is the most important object of the empire. Sedina was born there. It may seem like a good family to others, but to Sedina, the Rosen family was a more terrifying place than hell.Her surname, Rosen, has always followed her cursedly, even when she came out of her family. In order to break free from her hated family, Sedina joined the Black Dawn.She wanted to get rid of the Rosen name and to find the true self in the Black Dawn. Knowing it was anti-social and unethical, she chose that path.\u2018Here I can live on my own, not as a little girl from the Rosen family.\u2019But the reality didn\u2019t work out that way.Black Dawn was a place of resistance to the world and most of its members were low-class or criminals who ruled the bottom of society. In such a place, Sedina, who had the last name Rosen, was a very foreign entity.-What? You have a surname? Really?\u2013 Rosen? Why the hell is a person from such a great family here?-Look out. She could be a spy.-It\u2019s like the damn upper classes.Unlike them who came up from the mud, there was no way they could acknowledge Sedina who came down from the top. That\u2019s why even though she\u2019s gifted in magic and enrolled in Theon she\u2019s still a Third Order.\u2018I just wanted to be recognized.\u2019She wanted to get rid of that hateful family so she joined the Black Dawn. It wasn\u2019t her goal to eat well and live well. She believed that if she worked hard, their vigilance and contempt for her would gradually reduce.However, the Black Dawn members\u2019 boundaries toward Sedina grew stronger, and she became a target of envy and jealousy because she even had the ability to enter Theon.Without even receiving the attention of the First Order, she was kept at the end of the Third Order because of the restraints of other members.The name of the Rosen family could be used, that intention was conveyed so clearly that it brutally pierced Sedina\u2019s delicate heart.\u2018But I met him.\u2019Now when she was tired and thought that everything was over new orders came from the organization. She was ordered by the Second Order, to meet Codename <John Doe>.Unlike other First Orders, he was an unknown existence whose true form and identity are not revealed. She was told to contact him and check the progress of the mission.This man, now known as Rudger Chelici, was a master of disguise and an executive specializing in infiltration and assassination, who never revealed his true identity. However, there was a flaw: his personality was very dirty.If disturbed even members of Black Dawn were beaten on the spot or even killed in extreme cases. Even such behavior was tolerated by the Zero Order, the leader of the Black Dawn. Unless one was a First Order cadre, Rudger was a symbol of fear within the Black Dawn.To be given a mission to meet Rudger was the same as sending her to die at his hands. Sedina Rosen was in tears from her displeasure. The Black Dawn\u2019s comrades told her to go die.She even thought of returning back to her family.\u2018I do not like it.\u2019She hated her family so terribly that she would rather die so she went to Rudger with a mindset of being prepared for death. But when she got closer, the man\u2019s charisma was beyond imagination, and Sedina trembled without realizing it.She made mistakes, and her voice was shaky. She committed almost everything she was told not to do in front of him.\u2018I might die.\u2019She thought so but surprisingly Rudger didn\u2019t kill her. Even his murderous intent was not revealed. As rumored, she felt that his personality was dirty and eccentric during the conversation, but in the end that was all.Rudger let her go without saying a word and today even complimented her for being good at explaining. If it was just the words that came out of his mouth, she wouldn\u2019t have been so happy. But in Rudger\u2019s words, there was sincerity in his actions.He listened more carefully than anyone else, from correcting her to addressing him as Professor Rudger rather than First Order.She thought she might be able to help someone.\u2018First order. No, Mr. Rudger Chelici is really great.\u2019From the first time they met, seeing him, she felt her heart pound. She thought it was her because of her nervousness and fear at the time, but with their meeting today, she was sure.She has an endless adoration for someone she truly cares and desires to serve. She doesn\u2019t think she\u2019s been treated this way because she\u2019s special. She was only rewarded a little for the misery and hard work she had been through.Rudger Chelici may have done some good deeds for his subordinates as an executive of the organization.It is too early to judge him but for the first time she had been praised by someone for doing something right.* * *When the sun was setting and it was time to go home, Rudger put on his coat and checked all his gear. In order to hunt werewolves in earnest, speed was essential, and of course he had to prepare all the necessary tools for hunting.These are highly confidential items that are not revealed much on the outside, so people passing by will not be suspicious of them. With that in mind, Rudger left the classroom and met Hugo who had just come to him.\u201cHuh! Mr. Rudger!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Sir Hugo Burtag.\u201dMarquis Hugo Burtag, leader of the Burtag family, a famous magician with a long history in the Exilion Empire. However, the family is gradually declining because of its excessive magic and authoritarian tendencies, unable to properly accept modern science.A man, who had a confrontation with the president, came to Rudger.\u201cDo you have anything to do with me?\u201d\u201cHuh. This man Do I have to do anything big to find you?\u201dHugo showed a friendly attitude that said he came to Rudger to make him an offer.\u201cYou haven\u2019t met the other teachers properly yet, right? You seem to be getting along only with the other new teachers.\u201d\u201cIs there any problem with that?\u201dHugo\u2019s eyebrows twitched at Rudger\u2019s stern attitude, not even bending over, let alone embarrass himself however Hugo decided to bear with it.\u201cI would like to introduce you to professors I am close with.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAt Hugo\u2019s subtle restraint, Rudger knew at once what he had come to see him for.\u2018Faction recruitment.\u2019Hugo intended to bring Rudger to a faction of teachers made entirely of aristocrats. Even in this situation where students are trembling with anxiety because of the werewolf, they are fighting to divide sides for power?Rudger shook his head at Hugo\u2019s funny attitude.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m comfortable right now.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dHugo\u2019s face turned red at Rudger\u2019s direct refusal.\u201cDo you know how many years I\u2019ve been a teacher here?\u201d\u201cShould I know?\u201d\u201cAbout 15 years. Except for Marie Ross, that old woman, I\u2019m the next oldest person. I should be a distant senior and superior to you!\u201d\u201cAre you talking about superiors?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cThat is strange. The only supervisor I have is the president.\u201dHugo clenched his teeth at the word \u2018President\u2019.To Hugo, the word president was not at all pleasant. Rather, it was more like a repulsion that awakened his inferiority and anger.\u201cMr. Rudger. I heard you were in the military before you came here.\u201d\u201cIt was just a short stay.\u201d\u201cWasn\u2019t it said that while hunting cryptids, you also made a major breakthrough?\u201dHave you gotten that information already?No, it was intentionally leaked from the Black Dawn anyway, so it wouldn\u2019t be strange to say that someone like Hugo knew about it.Rudger nodded his head.\u201cI\u2019m speaking in high regard for your abilities. Do you have any desire to re-establish your family? With the support of our noble faction, this is possible.\u201dHugo chose to make the most concessions where he could step back, he was impatient.The faction of the president was getting stronger day by day. In particular, the current president, despite her young age, is a 6th-level Lexer-class wizard and possesses her innate political abilities, making her an opponent that even Hugo couldn\u2019t be careless about.\u2018If it wasn\u2019t for that woman, I would have been the next president!\u2019Hugo was dissatisfied with that. Even now, instead of being nice to the noble students, the president is showing more care towards the commoners.There are as many as five new teachers this time, of which three are commoners, one is a fallen nobleman and only one pure blood noble.\u2018It hurts my self-esteem but we must bring Rudger Chelici to our faction.\u2019He already knew that Rudger was a Fallen Nobility. Normally, he wouldn\u2019t have looked at him, but the situation was urgent, so he had no choice. Besides, Rudger Chelici was a wizard who reached the fourth rank at a young age, and he was quite a talented man.Aside from his origins, he was perfect in everything so Hugo himself had come to see him.\u201cI can help you. So what about it? Holding hands with us.\u201d\u201cWhat exactly do you mean by holding hands?\u201dThis time, instead of rejection, a question came back.Hugo continued, thinking that Rudger was finally interested.\u201cAll we need to do is to build friendships with each other, get support from other nobles, and take better care of their children.\u201d\u201cIn other words, you mean to provide convenience to noble students?\u201d\u201cUh-huh. It\u2019s just a little bit of flexibility.\u201dHugo thought Rudger was almost won over. The fact that this man was a soldier in the first place must have been because he was planning to rebuild his family again by obtaining achievements somehow. Hugo judged Rudger\u2019s actions that way.\u201cThen I can\u2019t do it.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dHugo, who didn\u2019t expect an answer of refusal, asked stupidly.\u201cI appreciate the offer, but I will decline it.\u201d\u201cAre you serious?\u201d\u201cYes. Saying that students should be treated differently, I\u2019ll pretend I didn\u2019t hear it.\u201d\u201cNo discrimination! We just want to be flexible!\u201d\u201cThen I will ask. If the president gives a better benefit to certain commoner students and wraps it up as flexibility, are you willing to follow it?\u201d\u201cWhat? No, are commoners and nobles the same? You have to say something that makes sense!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dHugo had a blank face. That\u2019s it. What do you mean by that?\u201cFlexibility is something that should be applied to both sides, not one-sided. But if flexibility applies only to nobles, it is no longer flexible. It\u2019s a privilege.\u201d\u201cNo, so the nobility\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThere are no commoners, nobility, or royalty within Theon. All of them are just students learning magic. I have no intention of giving up on this idea.\u201d\u201cThis\u2026\u2026!\u201dHugo clenched his teeth at Rudger\u2019s words.Shaking his anger, Hugo rolled up one of his lips and grunted at Rudger.\u201cOkay. I was short sighted. By the time I came here, I overlooked that the president might have used her hand.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean.\u201dRudger was sincere.In the first place, he had absolutely no intention of joining a man like Hugo.He\u2019ll help build his family up? If he does, it will be revealed that this family is a fake. From Hugo\u2019s point of view, he said he would help, but to Rudger, it was only a hoax that would reveal his identity.In the first place, he had no intention of rebuilding a fallen family. His only purpose is to stay here for two years without being discovered. Besides, he was concerned about holding hands with Hugo and fighting the president.No matter how he looked at it, Hugo and the president were not equal. Hugo himself wouldn\u2019t think so, but in Rudger\u2019s eyes, the president was far more overwhelming.\u2018If I do something strange and get caught in the president\u2019s eyes it won\u2019t be worth it.\u2019Tigers exist in the mountains, but there is no fool who holds hands with foxes. It would be ideal to play tightrope without belonging to either side, but Rudger had no choice but to make a decision when his opponent was so direct.If he had to choose between the two, he would choose the president. It\u2019s more comfortable with the president, who treats everyone equally, rather than the authoritarian character of the aristocracy.\u201cI have to patrol so I\u2019ll take my leave. Sir Hugo it can be dangerous outside so you should stay inside.\u201d\u201cYou will regret it.\u201dRudger\u2019s provocative words made Hugo\u2019s face red like a boiled octopus. His thick cheeks quivered, but Hugo didn\u2019t say anything to Rudger\u2019s back as he was already leaving.To be honest, it was because he was frightened by the sight of Rudger staring at him. Hugo didn\u2019t want to admit it but he was scared.Hugo stomped on the pitiful ground with his feet and left, groaning.He cherished the idea of penalizing a student if he catches one.* * *After leaving Hugo, Rudger went on patrol outside. As the sun went down, the magic lamps were turned on inside Theon, and the light spread all around.Rudger sighed inwardly and headed for the nearby bush.\u201cYou must have been told to go back to the dormitory right away.\u201dRudger said coldly, staring at the three students looking up at him with puzzled faces.\u201cOr, you heard it, but decided to play around.\u201d\u201cThat teacher, that, not that\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cAll three of you will receive five penalty points.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 27": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Academy\u2019s Undercover ProfessorCH 27Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayC27: Werewolf (2)After that, I went on patrol, captured nearly 20 students, penalized them, and forced them back to their dormitories.Why do these bastards keep walking around at night? They\u2019re freshmen, so they\u2019re immature but seeing sophomores also involved is giving me a headache.\u2018That means everyone is interested in this werewolf incident.\u2019The sun has already set, and darkness is all around. Although there are security guards and teachers patrolling, there are still quite a few students hiding inside this beautiful property.\u2018Students are children who can use magic, so ordinary users will not be able to find the hidden ones.\u2019That must have fueled their sense of adventure even more. To be honest, I was going to just ignore it and pass by, but every time I pass by, one or two stand out.\u2018A lot of them.\u2019Most of the students were obsessed with their own ambitions to capture the werewolf because an official notice came from Leathervelk. Anyone who could kill or capture an werewolf would be rewarded.\u2018In addition to wanting to become a hero, if they catch it, Leathervelk will pay them money and increase their reputation, there is no one who will turn away from such a chance.\u2019For commoners who lack money, the bounty obtained by defeating the werewolf must be very attractive.In the case of the commoners, there is a system that provides them scholarships within Theon internally, but that doesn\u2019t mean they will receive all of the magic textbooks and other supplies. There are many things wizards need money for and it\u2019s the same for students.If they become heroes and get noticed by some rich people they might get sponsored by them.Some boys seem to have done this because they couldn\u2019t beat their youthful energy just to get the attention of the opposite sex.\u2018It seems that I have sent everyone back, so I have to start tracking the werewolf again.\u2019I wasted a lot of time. Besides, I realized that the situation was more serious than I had thought. I had no idea that there would be so many students.The other teachers will feel something strange and work harder. If someone other than me finds the werewolf first and discovers that it\u2019s been created in a lab the situation will get out of control.\u2018So before that, I\u2019ll take care of it.\u2019I headed to the sewage treatment plant, the most likely route for the werewolves to sneak into Theon Academy.As Theon has a vast site, it uses quite a lot of water, so there is a huge sewage treatment facility on the outskirts of the campus. A place that draws in huge amounts of water from the Lemzier River and at the same time discharges a large amount of water through huge earth pipes.Considering the size of the werewolf I encountered at that time, there is a high probability that it came through the earth pipe.\u2018Fortunately, no one seems to have come this far.\u2019Most teachers go on patrols and send students back just in case something goes wrong. No one, like me, wondered where the werewolf came from and followed its tracks because that isn\u2019t the wizard\u2019s way, but the hunter\u2019s way.After wandering around the darkened sewage treatment plant, I finally found a trace.\u2018Footprint.\u2019The footprints clearly marked on the bushes looked like they had been engraved for several days. When I got closer and wiped it with my hand, it was clear.\u2018Comparing the size of the footprint, it\u2019s slightly smaller than the one I saw at that time.\u2019But there was one problem. There were two types of footprints.Everyone believes that there\u2019s only one werewolf but there might be 2 of them inside Theon.\u2018I thought there was only one, but looking at the imprints, it seems that the guy who ate people from Leathervelk came all the way here.\u2019I moved slowly and followed the trail of footsteps. The two footsteps moved in the same direction at first, but then split in two directions, small ones to the right, large ones to the left.I didn\u2019t expect these guys to separate here. Wolves are pack animals so werewolves who inherited that tendency are the same. Normally, they should have stayed together.I don\u2019t know why, but they started to move apart so I had to make a choice.* * *\u2018It\u2019s late.\u2019Rene, with her ash gray hair color, which is rare even in Theon, was running around the lot with a magic textbook in her arms. It had been a while since she fell asleep while studying in the library.She looked out her window, pulling the hair clinging to her cheeks, and, seeing the sun set, hurriedly ran out of the library. As she ran towards her dorm, Rene had no choice but to blame herself.\u2018You idiot! Why did you fall asleep there?\u2019Over the past few days, while reducing her sleep time, fatigue has accumulated due to immersion in homework and study.The teacher decided that students should go back to their dormitory after classes but she fell asleep in the library. It is the duty of the students to control their physical condition. Just because she fell asleep doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not her fault.If the teachers caught her she had no excuse for getting penalized.\u2018Still, it\u2019s a bit painful to receive a penalty point.\u2019Running out of money, she was living on her scholarship. However, if the student has a penalty point, the amount of the scholarship will be reduced. In some cases, the scholarship application would be rejected when the student has too many penalty points.She hoped that she wouldn\u2019t be penalized so badly for this incident, but the fact that she would be penalized was a burden to her.\u2018But can\u2019t I just go back to the dormitory as soon as possible before I get caught?\u2019She had to avoid the dormitory supervisor\u2019s eyes, but in the case of the non-teachers, she was confident that she would not be found out. She already thought that the penalty points were certain. There was a glimmer of hope that she might not get caught, as she hid her body in the dark.\u2018Even so, it was too much. How can no one wake me up?\u2019After thinking about that, Rene sighed deeply.Originally, it was the basic thing for students attending the academy to make friends and get to know each other, but in fact, from the beginning of the semester, she had a quarrel with an aristocrat and was swept away by turmoil.Because of that conflict she was targeted by the noble students and other commoner students stopped approaching her. Still, there were some boys who asked if she was okay the next day after the incident. They were all enamored with her appearance and approached with certain thoughts.She said that she didn\u2019t want to be friends with people like that.\u2018The librarian was also absent. They didn\u2019t even want to wake me up in the first place.\u2019Perhaps the person who works as a librarian is also on the side of the aristocrats. Feeling embarrassed about her own situation, Rene bit her lip.It was at that moment when she vowed to go home and wash up and organize the contents of today\u2019s class.\u2500\u2500Crush.\u201cHey, why are you there?\u201dRene unconsciously stopped his steps and shook her body. The fact that the grass beyond the darkness, where the trees were planted moved wasn\u2019t her imagination.\u201cCome out otherwise, I will call the teachers.\u201dThe rumors of a werewolf that have been circulating recently had been well heard by Rene and she couldn\u2019t dismiss it as a mere rumor since 2 students have been injured. Thinking that the werewolf was real a chill ran down her spine.Rene moved her trembling feet and stepped back. At that moment, the rustling in the darkness came swiftly towards her and something popped out from a bush.Rene squeezed her eyes shut and shouted.\u201cI have no taste at all! If you eat something like me, you will only get a stomach ache!\u201dBut the wolf\u2019s cry was not heard. There was no pain either.Rene opened her eyes and the first thing she saw in the light of the street lamp was blonde hair.The student had leaves all over her but her nobility never faded. She put her hands on her waist and stared at Rene with a curious gaze. She was a year older than Rene and was a princess of this country.\u201cAren\u2019t you too rude?\u201d\u201cUh, huh?\u201dRene immediately recognized who was in front of her.\u201cWow, Princess?\u201dThird Princess Erendir von Exilion.Rene saw her in Rudger class, so she immediately shook her head. But when Rene tried to bow her head, Princess Erendir stopped her.\u201cNo, it\u2019s ok.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIt was my fault that I surprised you in the first place but this is Theon and in Theon, everyone is equal. You and I are the same.\u201dAt Erendir\u2019s confident words, Rene opened her mouth without realizing it. She didn\u2019t know that she would hear Theon ideology from the princess.\u201cUh, why is that princess here\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t call me princess. Are you in 1st grade? Then you can just call me Erendir-senpai.\u201d\u201cMe, me?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m more comfortable with it. In the first place, I have no intention of arbitrarily using my position in Theon. Junior, did you say that your name was Rene?\u201d\u201cHuh? Do you know me?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re taking the manifestation class together. I have a good memory.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s great.\u201d\u201cWell, actually, the class is very special. It remained in my memory quite strongly, and most of the students in that class remember it. And you are quite conspicuous.\u201dIs she talking about hair color? Rene smiled brightly. The color of my hair attracted the attention of the princess.\u201cSo, why is junior Rene, wandering around here late at night? Didn\u2019t the teachers warn you?\u201d\u201cWell, that\u2019s\u2026\u2026\u201dRene candidly answered why she was moving alone this late at night.Erendir, who had heard everything, widened her eyes.\u201cWhat? Nobody woke you up? Isn\u2019t that too much?\u201d\u201cIn the end, it was my fault for falling asleep.\u201d\u201cNo! I can\u2019t let this go. Why are they doing such a boring thing? I will talk with the librarian right now\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cMore importantly, what are you doing here?\u201dRene hurriedly changed the topic.\u201cOh, you mean me? I am currently in the role of finding and returning students who have not yet returned to the dormitory. Everyone is so noisy now.\u201d\u201cHuh\u2026\u2026Aren\u2019t seniors also students?\u201d\u201cYou do not have to worry because I am moving with permission.\u201d\u201cOh, I see.\u201d\u201cAnyway, let\u2019s go back. Oh, if you keep going like this, there will be a teacher, you should go back this way so you won\u2019t be found out.\u201d\u201cAh yes! Thank you!\u201dIt was at that moment when Rene nodded and was about to leave.\u201cCrung\u201dRene and Erendir heard a strange sound.\u201c\u2026\u2026Rene. Step back.\u201dErendir stared into the darkness and pulled out her staff. Two red eyes appeared in the darkness and slowly approached the two of them.A werewolf appeared in the light of a street lamp.\u201c\u2026\u2026Werewolves are real.\u201d\u201cThe rumors, weren\u2019t they fake?\u201d\u201cWhat are you surprised about? You were surprised when you first saw me.\u201d\u201cOh, that\u2019s\u2026everyone is surprised when something pops out of the dark!\u201d\u201cAnyway, this is a big deal.\u201dThe werewolf in front of them didn\u2019t look weak at first glance. There was an obvious murderous intent in its eyes.Neither Rene nor Erendir showed it but they were afraid. Still as rank 3 wizard she couldn\u2019t lose without doing anything.\u201c\u2500\u2500Get out of the way.\u201dAt that moment, a strong fire broke out in the air. A high-temperature flame engulfed the werewolf and burned him.\u201cKyaah\u201dThe werewolf screamed and rolled on the floor. He didn\u2019t die perhaps because of the beast\u2019s instinct to avoid fire, but his flesh and skin burned and melted, so he could not escape the blow.The wound was also recovering quickly, but they had enough time. Their eyes turned to the place where the magic flew. A man was standing there.Rene called out his name without realizing it.\u201cMr. Rudger!\u201dRudger Chelici.Rudger\u2019s ice-cold gaze moved from the werewolf and turned to Rene and Erendir and slowly opened his mouth.\u201cRene and Erendir von Exilion.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cYes, teacher.\u201dThey were glad that Rudger had come to the rescue, and waited for his next words.\u201cBoth of you will receive five penalty points.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Also I changed Tracey to Tracy.\u201cYes?! Wait! Aren\u2019t you supposed to ask if we\u2019re okay at times like this?!\u201dErendir thought she had heard wrong.The teacher who saved them from the werewolf instantly gave them penalty points, this seemed quite unfair to Erendir.\u201cErendir, are you saying you did well?\u201d\u201cI got permission from another teacher!\u201d\u201cNoisy. Even if you get permission, you should act carefully. Don\u2019t you know what could\u2019ve happened to you just now?\u201d\u201cThat, that\u2026\u201dRudger was merciless even if his opponent was a princess. Even Erendir couldn\u2019t really refute Rudger\u2019s words.It was her status as a princess that allowed her to wander around at night like this and made it easy for her to make the excited students bow their heads and send them back to their dormitory.\u201cThen, at least make up for the penalty points of this child.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dRudger\u2019s gaze turned to Rene.\u201cRene.\u201d\u201cYes. Mr. Rudger.\u201d\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you go back to the dormitory?\u201d\u201cThat, that\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI admit that you are passionate about studying, but don\u2019t you know that doing such a thing in this kind of situation will cause trouble to others?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026I\u2019m sorry.\u201dRudger shook his head.\u201cErendir.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cTake responsibility for Rene and send her back to the dormitory. That way, she\u2019ll be free of the penalty points she just received.\u201d\u201cYes?

Most of the wounds from the magic had healed, but the guy was still distracted by the shuddering pain.The werewolf, who had been staring at them with eyes full of endless hostility, suddenly moved but instead of attacking he ran away.\u201cOh! It escaped!\u201dAt the same time as Rene shouted, Rudger followed the werewolf. He never meant to miss the werewolf he had barely found.Rene and Erendir haven\u2019t noticed yet, but that werewolf\u2019s neck was also stuffed with restraints. It was fortunate that the restraint ball was covered with hair and could not be seen properly. However, if someone else finds it later, it will be difficult to even destroy the evidence.Rudger filled his legs with magic and ran.As he chased the werewolf through the dark grass and across the garden, he saw the werewolf crawling up the outer wall of the nearby research building to the roof.Sharp claws pierced the exterior walls of the building with ease, and its gigantic body eventually reached a rooftop full of spires.\u2018Can\u2019t let it escape.\u2019Rudger immediately soared vertically into the air using a wire launcher and landed on the roof. Erendir and Rene, who were still watching the scene from afar, opened their mouths in admiration.\u201cIs that just floating magic?\u201d\u201cMaybe?\u201dThe two people, who could not see the wire launcher because it was dark at night, thought that all of Rudger\u2019s movements were thanks to magic.Two silhouettes stood on the roof facing each other. It was not clearly visible from a distance, but it wasn\u2019t difficult to tell who Rudger was based on its size and approximate appearance.\u201cFull moon.\u201dThe clouds in the sky lifted, and before long a cold and cozy silver light poured down like the hem of a curtain. Tonight was a full moon night.Rudger moved first and the werewolf\u00a0 also rushed to Rudger. The two of them crossed each other and a close battle ensued.\u201cWow.\u201d\u201cOh my gosh.\u201dThere was something about Rudger\u2019s appearance that was hard to take their eyes off of. Under the moonlight, Rudger moves were like a dance, as he avoided the werewolf\u2019s attacks.Even though the girls were far away, they could feel the trembling attacks on their skin but nothing could touch Rudger.He used multiple attributes magics arrows like fire, ice, wind and although their power was only around second rank they precisely targeted the werewolf\u2019s vital parts and inflicted him with wounds.\u2018It\u2019s said he was in the army before he came here.\u2019Erendir thought of Rudger Chelici. She wasn\u2019t particularly interested in him, but her maid brought her his information, just in case, so all she saw was on a whim. As she remembered, Rudger Chelici was in the army, and even achieved a record while hunting cryptids.As she watched Rudger fight Erendir thought that he looked more like a hunter than a wizard.The werewolf made a rough noise and rolled over the roof, then glided down the slope. Rudger did not miss it as a predator that never misses the gap created by its wounded prey.Three ice spears the size of a fist pierced the werewolf\u2019s body in a row and fixed it on the roof. Even though a werewolf has excellent regenerative ability he still pierced instantly because of this attack.The fight was over.\u2018Whoa. I\u2019m tired.\u2019Rudger realized that he had expended considerable mana in the fight.\u2018It\u2019s not good to use a lot of magic power.\u2019Luckily, he met Hans and was able to bring his medicine back. If he hadn\u2019t, it would have been a big deal.Originally he didn\u2019t want to use magic against the werewolf but because he\u2019s in Theon and many eyes are watching him he couldn\u2019t use other methods.\u2018It\u2019s impossible for a magic teacher not to use magic in front of his students.\u2019First of all, he is a famous teacher of Theon, but if he uses tools or other methods he used in his hunter days, not magic, that would raise suspicions.\u2018I need to finish it before it gets any more troublesome.\u2019Aside from this guy, there is still one more lurking in Theon.\u2018I was planning to finish both werewolves by the end of today.\u2019As Rudger slowly approached, the staggering werewolf suddenly flashed his arms.His doubts disappeared the moment he saw the fragments of the building thrown by the werewolf.\u2018What?\u2019Rudger immediately unleashed his magical powers, creating a barrier around his body. The shards that flew in were hit and bounced off, but the problem was that the werewolf bought time for his next move.He immediately raised both of his hands up and slammed them hard on the roof. Due to the werewolf\u2019s strong muscular strength, the roof collapsed, and the werewolf also fell. Debris spread and a cloud of dust rose around it.Rudger narrowed his eyes at the sight.\u2018A Werewolf his head?\u2019Even if they are artificial creatures that are not cryptids, as they are based on wolves, their instincts as beasts are of course the most advanced.Not only did he run away when he felt a crisis, but Rudger didn\u2019t even expect that he would throw up the wreckage of a broken building.\u2018Did I miss it?\u2019Rudger, who entered the building through the hole in the roof, realized that the werewolf had disappeared and clicked his tongue. However, he didn\u2019t completely miss it because there was a scent that subtly stimulated his nose in the air.\u2018It was good that I buried the incense in the middle of the fight just in case.\u2019Rudger followed the scent of the werewolf\u2019s traces. He still had the thoughts of finishing the entire thing today because he wanted to live.* * *\u201cTracy! Tracy! Where are you?\u201d\u201cAidan. I can\u2019t see her no matter how much I look around. Wouldn\u2019t it be better to just give up?\u201dAidan and Leo were diligently searching out of sight to find Tracy.The last time they heard that Tracy had gone to the forest to the east, the two continued to search for her even as the sun went down. However, no trace of Tracy could be found.Leo, who was starting to get annoyed, spoke first.\u201cI thought Tracy couldn\u2019t do it, so she would have resigned on her own. Wouldn\u2019t that be the case since we can\u2019t find her?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s our fault for not properly rejecting Tracy\u2019s bet, no matter how absurd it was.\u201dLeo put on a sullen expression at Aidan\u2019s reply.It was Leo\u2019s fault that Tracy made the bet and he was feeling a little guilty, that\u2019s why he kept looking for Tracy even after nightfall.\u201cStill, if we get caught by the teachers, we are at risk too. Others will say that it is only a penalty point, but from the point of view of the person who has to be concerned about his rank, such a penalty point is too important.\u201d\u201cI still can\u2019t let it go.\u201d\u201cDo you really believe Tracy is still looking for the werewolf?\u201d\u201cIf it was someone else I wouldn\u2019t but Tracy\u2026.\u201dIn fact, even Aidan didn\u2019t know why he was so sure what he had said.There was something familiar in Tracy\u2019s eyes: it was the obsession of a person who always wanted to achieve something. He thought that if she was like that, maybe she could really mess around with her life to catch the werewolf.\u201cUgh. Okay. Let\u2019s search for another 30 minutes. If we can\u2019t find anything we\u2019ll go back.\u201dLeo sighed as he looked at Aidan. He knew enough that this good-natured guy was stubborn and didn\u2019t make any compromises at important moments.It was the moment when the two of them, who had taken a little rest, were about to move again.\u201cKyaaaaaa!!\u201dA girl\u2019s scream is heard from afar. The strangely familiar voice was, of course, the voice of Tracy Friad, whom they had been looking for.\u201cLeo!\u201d\u201cOver there!\u201dThe two ran through the grass and branches to where the scream was heard. At that moment, the grass on the other side shook and someone jumped out and Aidan, who was running in the lead, collided with it.\u201cWhat is it all of a sudden?\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dAidan lifted his head as he felt the strong pressure on his body had fallen backwards. The first thing he saw was red hair that did not lose its presence even in the soft moonlight.\u201c\u2026\u2026Tracy?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Aidan?\u201dTracy, realizing who she was hugging on top, got up in a hurry.\u201cYou! Why are you here?\u201d\u201cI heard your screams\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat?! What scream?!\u201dSeeing Tracy blushing and yelling at Aidan, Leo sighed, thinking that he was worried about nothing but then the cry of the beast was heard.\u201cUgh! Aidan, you heard it?\u201d\u201cHuh. Is it really a werewolf?\u201dThe vigilant gazes of the two men turned towards the bushes and they both pulled out their wands but then Tracy stood in front of them.\u201cBoth of you wait a minute.\u201d\u201cTracy what are you doing?\u201dAt Aidan\u2019s question, Tracy hesitated then placed a finger on her lips and motioned for the two of them to follow.Aidan and Leo looked at each other wondering what this was, but eventually decided to follow Tracy\u2019s footsteps. The three of them moved quietly and eventually reached the front of the basin where the ground was swept away.\u201cLook over there.\u201dAs they looked in the direction she was pointing in a quiet voice, they saw something wriggling in the center of a basin full of fallen leaves.\u201cThat\u2026\u2026\u201dAidan, a country boy with good night eyes, immediately recognized what it was.\u201cWerewolf?\u201dIt was definitely a werewolf. There were scars all over the place, and he was still gasping for breath, but that was definitely the case.\u201cAre you a kid?\u201dThe small werewolf was a baby that had not yet become an adult.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Sorry for not posting any chapters last week I\u2019ve been very busy. I will post at least 1 more chapter today.Aidan and Leo only looked into each other\u2019s eyes. The culprit who drove Theon into the chaos was now in front of them but he was still a cub. Even the grunting made it clear that he was injured somewhere\u201cI stumbled upon it a while ago.\u201dWhy was Tracy screaming? She was wandering around without much thought and suddenly found a werewolf. Tracy, who blushed as if she was ashamed of that fact, immediately raised her nose.\u201cWhat do you think? Did I win the bet?\u201d\u201cYou just found it. Wasn\u2019t the bet capturing it?\u201dAt Leo\u2019s point, Tracy immediately became furious.\u201cYes? Then I, right now\u2026\u2026!\u201d\u201cTracy, wait a minute.\u201dAidan pulled Tracy back as she was about to descend into the basin.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\u201cOh sorry. I did not know.\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you too rude to a lady?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not what\u2019s important right now.\u201d\u201cWhat is it then?\u201dA smirk crept across her lips as if Tracy realized something immediately.\u201cHeh heh\u2026Aidan Are you impatient because I found that werewolf? You were secretly pretending not to, but you were also concerned about losing to me.\u201d\u201cTracy, didn\u2019t you feel something strange?\u201dWhen a serious question came back to answer provocation, Tracy pouted her lips as if she had lost steam.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cOver there is a werewolf cub. Regardless of whether it is possible for a werewolf to have a cub, the cub over there right now looks injured. I can\u2019t seem to move properly.\u201d\u201cYes. But why?\u201d\u201cLook, there are fallen leaves all around. Besides, it\u2019s a clever location that people don\u2019t notice around here. No matter how wide Theon is, I have never heard of a place like this in the forest.\u201d\u201cNo, I mean, what does that mean?\u201d\u201cDo you think that little werewolf settled down here alone and collected fallen leaves?\u201dHaving heard that Tracy realized something and kept her mouth shut. There\u2019s no way an injured werewolf cub could have come all the way here alone. It sounds like there is something else out there that has helped him.\u201cWho the hell?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know who it is. Perhaps\u2026\u2026There may be another werewolf.\u201dEven as Aidan said that, he did not take his eyes off the werewolf baby because by any chance, he might notice their existence and attack them all of a sudden.Although he is a cub, he\u2019s bigger than most large dogs. Risk factors could not be ruled out.\u2018Uh?\u2019Aidan, who was closely examining the werewolf, noticed something strange. Near the nape of the werewolf\u2019s neck, covered in fallen leaves and showing only a bust, it was as if he had seen something glistening in the moonlight.\u2018That\u2019s a collar\u2026\u2026?\u2019At that moment, Aidan decided that the werewolf was not simply a natural occurrence.\u201cAidan? What are you doing?\u201dLeo spoke, feeling that Aidan\u2019s expression was unusual.Aidan glided down the basin as if he had made up his mind to do something.\u201cAidan! Hey, hey!\u201dLeo was perplexed, and so was Tracy. The two hurriedly followed Aidan, who came down to the center of the basin that was more than 5 meters high and slowly approached the werewolf cub.\u201cAidan! What are you doing now! It\u2019s dangerous!\u201d\u201cThere is something strange about it.\u201dAidan wanted to confirm it with his own two eyes. At that moment, the werewolf cub opened his eyes and stared at Aidan.Aidan paused as he approached cautiously. Their gazes were entangled in the air, and a suffocating tension lingered.\u2018Gulp.\u2019Aidan swallowed his dry saliva and slowly reached out his hand.\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I mean no harm.\u201dThe reason he said that was because he saw the werewolf\u2019s eyes and there was no hostility or intent to kill in them. Those transparent, clear eyes staring at him were filled with only the innocence of a country dog.A werewolf with those eyes attacked people and sent them to the hospital?Aidan didn\u2019t think so.Leo and Tracy had no intention of stopping Aidan. The cub, who was staring at him, immediately turned its head and closed its eyes again.Aidan sighed inwardly and moved closer to the cub. As expected, he was quiet. He even made a growling noise as Aidan swept his hair once with his hand.\u201cIt hurts a lot.\u201dSaying so, Aidan looked at the wounds exposed outside the fallen leaves.\u2018Isn\u2019t it bitten by an animal?\u2019The marks on his body were not from being attacked by other beasts. Rather, it was more like a cut.He touched his neck with the hand that had been stroking his head, and felt the touch of a hard, cold metal.\u2018I thought he was just a werewolf, but there\u2019s something more.\u2019While Aidan was thinking in the darkness the sound of something approaching was heard. Leo, who recognized the abnormality first, shouted.\u201cAidan! Be careful!\u201dAs soon as Aidan heard the sound, he flew in the opposite direction of the sound. Immediately after, a huge shock hit his body.\u201cBig!\u201dAidan, who bounced more than 3m and rolled on the floor, corrected his dizziness, and looked at the unknown entity that blew him away.\u2018Werewolf!\u2019It was an adult werewolf, 1.5 times larger than the cub werewolf. He glared at Aidan as if he was going to kill him, and then stood as if protecting the baby.\u201cGee, an adult werewolf.\u201dTracy trembled at the sight, and then, as if she was prepared for something, raised her wand and generated magical power. The werewolf also glared at her if she thought Tracy was doing something.\u201cWhat are you doing!?\u201dLeo tried to stop her, but Tracy didn\u2019t listen. A werewolf, the root of all of the chaos in Theon, was in front of her. If she could deal with it she could revive her family that collapsed.The figure of the mother who struggled to smile saying that it was okay for her and trash-like people who turned to the subject that they usually cling to, as soon as their family collapsed as she thought of that she became more agitated.\u2018Only I can bring the Friads back to life. The werewolf in front of me is just a stepping stone for that.\u2019Hunting only one werewolf does not resurrect a destroyed family, Tracy knew that. It was okay just to collect the bounty from Leathervelk and establish her reputation. To do that, she learned magic, and came to Theon to succeed.\u2018I\u2026\u2026!\u2019The werewolf ran towards Tracy, it was fast and very threatening. Tracy, who tried to cast a spell, made a mistake because of the werewolf rushing towards her.Because of her impatience the magic that had barely been gathered was scattered in vain.Beyond the disappearance of the magic the figure of the werewolf approaching with its teeth facing her was seen.\u2018Is this the end?\u2019As he thought that, Tracy felt her body shove to the side. The sharp claws of the werewolf passed through the air right in front of her. As she rolled the floor with someone, Tracy was stunned.\u201cUh, huh?\u201d\u201cTracy, are you okay?\u201dIt was Aidan who saved her from her crisis. He is a boy that she keeps bothering and insists on fighting with. Had he been too late to push her, Tracy would have had her head blown away.\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re safe.\u201d\u201cYou, you. Why me\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cMy friend is in danger, and I can\u2019t just stand by and watch.\u201dFriend, at that one word Tracy was speechless. Aidan looked at the werewolf, not paying attention to Tracy\u2019s reaction.\u201cThere is something strange about his movements. I think it was seriously injured. Maybe that\u2019s why we were able to avoid it.\u201dAs expected, there were three large unclosed holes in the werewolf\u2019s chest, which was revealed in the dark. Aidan swallowed his saliva and opened his mouth.\u201cSorry. It wasn\u2019t intentional. We have no intention of doing any harm to your child.\u201d\u201cAidan? What are you doing now! There is no way a werewolf can understand you!\u201dTracy shouted from behind saying what a fool he was, but Aidan was serious. Aidan continued to speak, staring at the werewolf in front of him with an unshakable gaze.\u201cYou. Can you understand us?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026\u2026\u201dLeo and Tracy looked puzzled. However, the werewolf\u2019s reaction was strange. He was staring at him like he was going to kill him but calmed down and went back to the cub.Leo, who watched the scene, did not keep his mouth shut.\u201c\u2026\u2026Does this make sense?\u201d\u201cA little while ago, it overreacted because it was afraid the cub would be in danger.\u201d\u201cBut he attacked two students. Right now, he\u2019s quiet because of his cub, but I don\u2019t know when it will suddenly reveal his true colors.\u201dLeo\u2019s point was valid, but Aidan felt something indescribable. He knew it because he got very close to the werewolf cub. The moment he looked into the child\u2019s eyes, Aidan felt something.\u2018He said please help.\u2019\u201cLeo, Tracy I know what I\u2019m saying is nonsense but believe me just once.\u201dAidan said so and slowly approached the werewolf.The presumed mother looked at Aidan and threatened him by exposing his teeth, but Aidan raised his hands and made a gesture that it was not dangerous.\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201dWith that the distance gradually narrowed and the werewolf who was glaring at Aidan also stopped showing its hostility. Rather, it was because the condition of the baby was not good.\u201cUse this.\u201dAidan took out a small vial from the pocket he usually carried. It was a very basic healing potion that was completed while taking the curse and pharmaceutical classes.It may not be able to perform properly due to his insufficient skills, but at least it will be of sufficient help to improve the condition of the cub who is currently panting.At that moment a pure white light flew from somewhere and penetrated the mother\u2019s body.\u201cUh, huh?\u201dAidan, who was approaching slowly, and Leo and Tracy, who watched the scene while holding their breath from behind, were shocked and could not help but panic.Penetrating the mother werewolf\u2019s body was a shiny silvery metal. At first, it was thought to be a sharp spear, but eventually its shape collapsed and turned into a net, binding its mother\u2019s body.At the moment everyone panicked, a black shadow fell from the sky.\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201dIt was someone they know well.\u201cMr. Rudger?\u201dRudger, who subdued the werewolf with a surprise attack, narrowed his eyes at the three students.\u201cAidan, Leo, and Tracy Friad, what were my students doing in a place like this at this late hour?\u201dThe three of them trembled as their names were called. They knew that after getting caught by a teacher in this situation they couldn\u2019t escape punishment especially since it was Rudger who caught them.\u201cI will hold the three of you accountable for this later. Just step back.\u201dTracy and Leo followed suit but Aidan was different. He intervened between Rudger and the werewolf, blocking Rudger\u2019s path.\u201cWait!\u201d\u201c\u2026Aidan, what are you doing?\u201dAidan\u2019s body trembled at Rudger\u2019s cold voice, but he did not back down.\u201cMr. Rudger, wait a minute!\u201d\u201cWould you like me to wait?\u201d\u201cThere is something strange about that werewolf! No, I mean, to be precise\u2026\u2026You seem to understand people! So please reconsider killing that werewolf for a second!\u201dAidan spit out what he had learned like a rapid-fire cannon. Otherwise, he thought Rudger would choke the werewolf out of breath at any moment.\u201cWhat nonsense are you talking about now?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not bullshit. Maybe that werewolf\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI hate to hear it. Back off.\u201d\u201cMr. Rudger!\u201d\u201cI told you to leave.\u201dAidan did not step aside despite Rudger\u2019s warning.As Rudger gazed at Aidan, he noticed a figure of a werewolf baby over his shoulder, licking with his tongue the face of his mother. Without any viciousness, he was just purely worried about his family.The baby lying down got up. When the fallen leaves covering the entire body are pushed away and the rest of the body is exposed. Rudger saw it and his eyebrows twitched.\u201cUh?\u201dAidan, who was staring at Rudger, immediately noticed such a subtle change in Rudger.\u2018Why is the teacher like that?\u2019Aidan tried to turn around without thinking. At that moment, his body flew through the air as if strongly pulled by something and gently landed on the ground without a wound. A buffering effect using the power of wind, it was all Rudger\u2019s work.\u201cTeacher?\u201dThe moment Aidan was about to say something Rudger\u2019s magic was manifested. A hot fire that erupted in an instant, it swallowed the two werewolves and scattered a dazzling light in all directions.He could feel the heat even though he was far away. It was obviously an attack magic that would surely kill the opponent.There was no screaming from the werewolves swallowed up in the flames. Because there was no time for that, and without even feeling the pain, they became ashes and disappeared.When the magic fire was completely extinguished there was not even a trace of the werewolves left, there were only black ashes.\u201cGo back to the dormitory.\u201dRudger said so without looking back.\u201cYou will take responsibility for your deviant behavior tomorrow.\u201dThere was no emotion in his voice.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 30": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Academy\u2019s Undercover ProfessorCH 30Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayC30: The person who sees, the person who solves (2)Rudger stood still, staring at the place where the werewolf had been before. He burned it all down without a trace. All the evidence that he was a test subject, not a real werewolf was gone.\u2018It\u2019s over now.\u2019But Rudger\u2019s heart was not at all at ease. Until the other teachers who turned on their magic lights from afar arrived at the site one by one Rudger stood still.* * *The werewolf incident that made Theon Academy tumult came to an end when new teacher Rudger Chelici eliminated the werewolves.Several students argued that this incident was simply an inflated rumor but Rudger\u2019s bloody battle with a werewolf on the roof of a building under the full moon has already spread among students.Students have already talked about this incident in <Akashic Records>.-Is it true this time it was a real werewolf?-I actually saw it. On the roof of the laboratory building, the new teacher was fighting a werewolf, and it was really cool.-It\u2019s not a lie?-Actually, a part of the roof of the lab 3 building was broken, and there were signs of a fight.-Wow. So, did the real new teacher catch the werewolf?\u2013 Even if he\u2019s a new teacher, it was said that he is a former soldier. Then it is possible.-Awesome.So there was a question as to what the werewolf was and where it appeared. Some even argued that the werewolves were actually controlled by someone in the dark. However, in the absence of any clues, such opinions were nothing more than gossip.-Ah. I got caught and got 5 demerit points.-Me too.-Yes. I don\u2019t mind with 5 points~. I got merit points in advance.\u2013 Where do you live?Most of the students who went out to catch the werewolves this time were caught and were baptized with demerit points.130 out of all students and there were even 3rd graders among the dogs, so it was noisy.They set out to become heroes but instead they got penalty points so most of the students ripped their heads off in regret as to why they did it.It was the same for Aidan, Leo, and Tracy.\u201cAww! It\u2019s ruined! After all, it was taken by Mr. Rudger!\u201dCurrently, the three have been called to the interview room for a meeting with the president.Aidan had a serious face as if he was still pondering something, but Tracy was different, she was restless.She should have never have thought of using a loophole to rebuild her family, but this werewolf incident did not compensate for it, but rather was stamped out by Rudger.Tracy, out of anger, glared at her Aidan, but then she bit her lips and ruffled her hair wildly. She couldn\u2019t blame Aidan. It was, after all, Aidan who rescued her by throwing her away from her werewolf attack.\u2018Yes. I was just, I couldn\u2019t do anything back then\u2026\u2026.\u2019Feeling so foolish for herself, Tracy grabbed the skirt of her uniform with trembling hands. Did 10 minutes pass like that?The door to the interview room opened and the three Musketeers Aidan, Leo, and Tracy, who were sitting, jumped up.The president had pure white hair on the outside but inside she had an unusual pink e colored hair and she was walking into the interview room with a smile on her face.Following in the footsteps of the president was a man with a sober impression. It was Rudger Chelici, who had defeated the werewolf the night before.Rudger looked as usual. His attire was a long red coat, not the black frock coat he wore in the past, but his unwavering cleanliness was still there.\u201cNow. All three of you sit comfortably.\u201dAt the president\u2019s words, Aidan and the three other people looked at each other and sat down again.The president also sat in the empty chair.\u201cSit down, Mr. Rudger.\u201d\u201cI will stand here.\u201d\u201cWell, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re comfortable with. So, let\u2019s get to the point then. Do you know why I called the three of you?\u201dNo one answered hastily but they knew. There is only one reason why the three of them are here. Because they witnessed the werewolf up close and got caught up in it.Tracy, who didn\u2019t know she was going to face the President, thought that Rudger was really determined and sharpened her teeth. What does it mean to tell the president not to just give penalty points? Isn\u2019t this a declaration that it will never end with ordinary discipline?\u2018Damn!\u2019She was desperately holding back her tears. From that day on, she never forgot that she had vowed to herself that she would never cry again. Above all, she was also stimulated by the way Aidan and Leo were sitting casually.\u201cHow are you doing?\u201dThe President opened her mouth first but as she spoke, Aidan\u2019s gaze did not depart from Rudger.\u201cWhy do you think I called you?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026It doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s just to give us penalty points.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dIt was then that Rudger opened his mouth.\u201cThe three of you ignored Theon warning and went all the way to the forest to endanger yourself. If the situation had changed a little, someone in this place would have been dead.\u201dThe three of them had their mouths shut.\u201cThere was no accident and no one died, but I thought you should know for sure how serious your negligent behavior was. That is why I made a suggestion to the president.\u201dThey knew that those words had absolutely no good intentions for them. As a heavy atmosphere lingered in the interview room, the president clapped with both hands.\u201cNow, now. Everyone, don\u2019t look like the world is collapsing, think positive. Mr. Rudger, your words were a bit harsh and scared the students.\u201d\u201cPresident, this is not something to pass on like that.\u201d\u201cOf course, it is true that no one was injured thanks to Mr. Rudger\u2019s struggle, and it is also true that the students behaved complacent. But in the end, it ended well, didn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026I do not understand.\u201d\u201cThey are still children and Mr. Rudger already explained to me the situation. Aidan?\u201d\u201cYes Yes!\u201dWhen his name was suddenly called, Aidan hurriedly answered.\u201cI heard that you intervened to save Tracy from danger?\u201d\u201cOh no, that\u2019s\u2026\u2026just.\u201d\u201cCompetition among students is important, but it is better to help each other live than that. You also stayed with Aidan and faced the danger together.\u201dAt the words of praise that came out of the president\u2019s mouth one by one, embarrassment lingered on Aidan, Leo, and Tracy\u2019s faces. Why is the president like that?\u201cYour actions are clearly wrong. So I decided to take Mr. Rudger\u2019s opinion and give you 10 penalty points each.\u201d10 points is twice the number of points the other students received.\u201cBut.\u201dAt that moment, the president\u2019s clear voice awakened the three of them from their thoughts.\u201cYour actions at that moment of crisis are definitely worthy of praise. So I\u2019m going to give all three of you ten merit points.\u201d\u201cYeah?\u201d\u201cOh, is that really true?\u201dThe 10 penalty points disappeared in an instant but the president\u2019s speech did not end there.\u201cAidan. You showed the courage to think of your colleagues before your own body in a moment of crisis. I will give you an additional 10 merit points.\u201d\u201cUgh!\u201d\u201cLeo. You did not forget to grasp the situation calmly even in an emergency, and you deliberately left a trail here so that others can follow along.\u201d\u201cHow\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll give you 10 additional merit points and Tracy Friad.\u201d\u201cYes, yes!\u201d\u201cThe courage to fight a werewolf without running away, some will say that you\u2019re naive but you\u2019ve probably realized something. I hope you will keep that unshaken heart forever.\u201d\u201cYes Yes! All right!\u201d\u201cI will also give you 10 merit points.\u201dAs a result the three of them received 10 merit points each.\u201cMr. Rudger, don\u2019t you have any complaints?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026If that\u2019s what the president wants.\u201dRudger took a step back and drew a line that he had no objections.\u201cCongratulations. Keep working hard in the future.\u201d\u201cAh yes! Thank you President!\u201d\u201cBut don\u2019t overdo it. Alright you can leave now.\u201dThe three students left the interview room feeling like they were still dreaming. Aidan, who was going out last, stopped and looked at Rudger, but Rudger didn\u2019t even look at him.\u2018What was the reaction that Mr. Rudger showed at that time?\u2019Aidan left the interview room with unresolved questions. The door closed, leaving only Rudger and the President in the interview room.\u201cMr. Rudger, are you satisfied now?\u201dThe president said that when she completely lost sight of the students.\u201cI was really surprised. Mr. Rudger himself is asking me to take care of those children.\u201dWith her head tilted back and her legs waving, the President glanced at Rudger with half-open eyes.\u201cBesides, do all these things like I did.\u201d\u201cBecause it wasn\u2019t a very good picture to do like I did there.\u201d\u201cI know. Are you saying good cops are bad cops? Do you consider yourself a villain? Aren\u2019t you sorry?\u201d\u201cI just chose the most efficient way.\u201d\u201cOh yeah? Well, you\u2019re fine, so I won\u2019t ask any more. In the end, it was a good thing for the students.\u201dThe president jumped up from her seat, approached the window where she could see Theon, and wiped the transparent window with her slender fingertips.\u201cMr. Rudger. You said you dealt with the werewolves yourself?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWhat did you see there?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cDid something unusual happen?\u201dDespite the president\u2019s words, which seemed to be somewhat sharp, Rudger\u2019s expression did not change.\u201cI didn\u2019t feel that way.\u201d\u201cOkay?\u201d\u201cYes. I just pursued the werewolf and removed it for fear of being a threat to the students, just like I did in the military.\u201d\u201cHmm. Well, then there is nothing I can do.\u201dThe President did not ask any further questions. Rudger\u2019s protection of students and fighting werewolves was already famous enough to spread throughout the school.\u201cAnyway, I have to thank Mr. Rudger once again. Thankfully, no one died.\u201d\u201cI was just doing my job.\u201d\u201cSuch a proud attitude, I like it. Can I expect more from you in the future?\u201dRudger nodded without a word and returned to his office.As Rudger sat down, leaning against the back of his chair, he remembered what had happened the night before.He was surprised to see that the body of the werewolf cub that was hidden in fallen leaves that others had not yet discovered was obviously of a human child without animal hair.\u2018The Shamsus School did not use wolves as subjects to create werewolves.\u2019Rather, it was the opposite: they used humans. Instead of substituting human genes into wolves, they captured humans and forcibly mixed them with the elements of beasts.The bizarre behavior of the werewolf, who threw the shattered debris with his hands when it became an emergency, was now understandable. He wondered why his head was spinning so well that he didn\u2019t seem like a beast that should have no reason.\u2019A cub and his mother?\u2019The three werewolves who made Leathervelk and Theon noisy were a family. Child and two parents, just ordinary people caught up in an unfortunate incident. Rudger killed the three with his own hands.He clenched his fists.\u2018I have no regrets for my actions.\u2019If he had gone back to that time, Rudger would have made the same decision. Otherwise, he would have been in danger. All subjects had to be eliminated, and the clues that he was involved in the situation had to be erased. There was no other way.There have already been deaths due to werewolves. They killed and ate people so they were killed. Yes, that was it.\u2018Pupil.\u2019Those clear eyes of the baby that looked back at him at the end while licking his mother. Even while he was preparing his magic to kill them, the eyes staring at him did not contain any rebuke or anger towards Rudger.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dRudger stood up.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Only 1 chapter today.Aidan, Leo, and Tracy, who were sitting on a bench in a quiet garden, thought that what had just happened was like a dream, and had not returned to reality yet.It was Tracy who came to her senses first.\u201cWe really didn\u2019t get punished. It still feels like a dream.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t believe the president stepped forward and supported us.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201dLeo, who had always had a sharp conversation with Tracy, completely agreed with her opinion this time around.The eyes of the two of them eventually turned to Aidan.\u201cHey Aidan. Aidan?\u201d\u201cYes? Uh, yes.\u201d\u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201dUnlike the two people who were happy to receive the merit points, Aidan had a serious face all the time.\u201cAidan, what are you worried about?\u201d\u201cNo. Should it be a concern? That\u2026\u2026It\u2019s kind of strange to come and say something like this now.\u201d\u201cWhat is it? Don\u2019t be stingy and tell me!\u201dWhen Tracy slapped him hard, Aidan hesitated, and then he confided his concerns to his friends.\u201cIt\u2019s just something strange.\u201d\u201cStrange? What\u2019s strange?\u201d\u201cYou may not have seen it, but the werewolf had a strange silver restraint on his neck.\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201d\u201cShhh!\u201dAs Tracy\u2019s voice rose, Leo immediately told her to be quiet.\u201cQuiet. What would you do if someone heard it?\u201dThe three of them looked around to see if there were any other witnesses, and then put their heads together and spoke in a quiet voice.\u201cKeep talking. Is that real?\u201d\u201cYes. That\u2019s why I tried to stop Mr. Rudger.\u201d\u201cAre you saying that werewolf is no ordinary werewolf?\u201d\u201cI wonder if it really isn\u2019t a subject that someone deliberately created.\u201dIf that was true, it couldn\u2019t have been more serious. Leo also opened his mouth with a heavy expression as if he was thinking of something.\u201cI, too, have heard some news recently.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThere are suspicious people hiding in Theon.\u201d\u201cSuspicious people? What is that, some kind of secret organization? Isn\u2019t that just a secret club made by students or a rumor?\u201dThere was nothing special about Theon students having secret meetings.Leo shook his head at Tracy\u2019s question. If it was just that, he wouldn\u2019t even say that he was suspicious.\u201cI\u2019m not even sure. However, it seems certain that a secret organization that has not been revealed has infiltrated Theon. I realized this while watching the werewolf incident.\u201d\u201cWait a minute. Then there are dangerous people in Theon.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s still at the stage of doubt, but I think so. Aidan, do you think so too?\u201d\u201cYes. To be honest, it\u2019s not a good thing to doubt someone, but he definitely has something to do with it.\u2026\u2026\u201dAidan was about to say something, then shook his head and bit his mouth.\u201cNo, no.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIs it because of Mr. Rudger?\u201dAidan couldn\u2019t help but nod his head at Tracy\u2019s piercing remark.The reason why Aidan\u2019s heart had been heavy for a while was because of the radical behavior that Rudger had shown the day before.\u201cI don\u2019t want to suspect Mr. Rudger,\u201d she said, \u201cbut the teacher I saw last night was somehow suspicious.\u201d\u201cWas he suspicious?\u201d\u201cYou guys may not have been able to see it properly because you were behind Mr. Rudger, but I was facing him from the front. Mr. Rudger saw something.\u201dAidan didn\u2019t miss Rudger\u2019s reaction but before he could ask, Rudger forcibly removed him and set the werewolf on fire.Hearing Aidan\u2019s words, Leo bit his chin.\u201cThat means Mr. Rudger was trying to destroy the evidence?\u201d\u201cWhat? Mr. Rudger? Does that make sense?\u201d\u201cWhat kind of stupid thing is that?\u201d asked Tracy.\u201cIt\u2019s not certain. However, I keep thinking that Mr. Rudger might know something. The teacher at that time seemed desperate to hide something.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dMaybe it was an illusion. There\u2019s no way a Theon teacher would do such a dangerous thing. But what if it\u2019s real? What if Rudger Chelici belongs to a secret organization that is too dangerous to even talk about?What if the werewolves were actually killed to destroy evidence?\u201cAre you stupid? Anyway, you went too far.\u201dTracy rebuked the two, putting her hand on her waist and shaking her head.\u201cMr. Rudger must have had something in mind and when we met the president earlier, didn\u2019t you think something was strange?\u201d\u201cUh? what?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t feel anything.\u201d\u201cUgh\u2026Stupid guys. Do you remember what the president said when he praised us? She gave each of us a little bit of a hint that we did well and what we did.\u201d\u201cOh, right. I didn\u2019t even think of it because I was concerned about other things.\u201d\u201cThink about it. How would the president, who was not present at the time, have known that?\u201d\u201cUh, that\u2019s\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cOf course, someone told the president everything. Who could tell her what we did?\u201dRudger Chelici, was the only one who knew.\u201cMr. Rudger definitely saw everything we were doing. If he had tried to scold us, he would not have told the president what we did well.\u201d\u201cAh.\u201dHearing Tracy words, it certainly seemed that way.It is the same with the fact that only the president and Rudger entered the interview room, and when the president said that she would give them merit points, Rudger took a step back and made concessions.\u201cYou mean it was all Mr. Rudger\u2019s plan? Why?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know that either. Still, Mr. Rudger was considerate of us and only said good things to the president. To be honest, isn\u2019t it too far-fetched to be suspicious of Mr. Rudger?\u201dAidan and Leo had nothing to say, even if they had ten mouths.If Rudger was a dubious person, would he have taught them the groundbreaking magic source code from his first class?A person, who has to hide his identity, rather than trying to reveal himself, is contradictory.\u201cIs it?\u201dAidan scratched his head, but couldn\u2019t shake his subtle suspicion about Rudger.He\u2019s definitely a respectable teacher, but there\u2019s no denying that he\u2019s got something odd about him.\u201cYes. Tracy I think you\u2019re right. It is meaningless to even think about it right now.\u201d\u201cHuh. It\u2019s okay to know.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m hungry. Have you guys eaten?\u201d\u201cNot yet.\u201d\u201cTracy?\u201d\u201cWhy me?\u201d\u201cIf you haven\u2019t eaten, why don\u2019t we go to dinner together?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dAt Aidan\u2019s words, Tracy wondered if she had heard wrong.\u201cMeal? With me? Why?\u201dEmbarrassed for nothing, Tracy twisted her hair with her fingertips and muttered a little with his flushed face.\u201cWith friends\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cAre we already friends?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dSeeing Aidan smiling brightly as he looked at her, Tracy dyed her earlobes red as well. Leo, who watched the scene from the side, sighed and shook his head.It seemed that their Theon life would be eventful in the future.* * *\u201cAh! Mr. Rudger!\u201dOn my way back to my dorm, I met Selina who ran towards him looking more like a student than a teacher.\u2018Aren\u2019t you really lying about your age?\u2019\u201cAre you off work?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cI heard the news. Yesterday, I heard that Mr. Rudger caught a werewolf.\u201d\u201cYes. I took care of it.\u201d\u201cWow. Really?\u201dSelina-sensei looks at him with a burdensome gaze. Still, she\u2019s also a new teacher, but I think she\u2019s looking up too much.\u201cRecently, I\u2019ve only been hearing about Mr. Rudger. How did you catch the werewolf?\u201d\u201cWait.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a little busy today, so we\u2019ll talk about it later.\u201dAt my resolute remark, Selina nodded her head slightly with a pale face like a child scolded by an adult.\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry. You\u2019re busy.\u201d\u201cNo. Not to that extent. Selina, please rest well.\u201d\u201cYeah. Mr. Rudger too.\u201dI said goodbye to Selina and parted with her.Unlike other teachers, she is a good person who cares about me. However, I couldn\u2019t get close to anyone because I was in a difficult position.It\u2019s possible to eat together as a group, but that\u2019s all. And above all, I had one thing to do now.When I returned to my private residence, there was a parcel at the door. Having packed the parcel, I went inside the house and checked the contents.It was the material that Hans sent me, about areas where missing people and certain people gather in Leathervelk recently.After lightly checking the contents, I headed to my personal study. On one wall of the study was a map of the city of Leathervelk, along with pictures pinned everywhere.I cut out some content from the document and pinned it to one corner of the map, an area full of abandoned factories in Leathervelk that has a laboratory nearby.After finishing the work up to that point, I immediately took out a portable crystal ball.[Brother, have you checked all the materials I sent?]\u201cYes.\u201d[As brother told me yesterday, I checked the area. In an abandoned factory, about ten strong men rushed to and fro. I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s there.]\u201cRight.\u201d[And I checked out what you personally told me to find out. Some workers have recently gone missing on the outskirts of the city.]\u201cWas there a family of three among them?\u201d[There was. It\u2019s the only case where an entire family has disappeared. The police didn\u2019t do much research and let it go, but the neighbors should have been very anxious.]\u201c\u2026\u2026I get it.\u201dI left those words and cut off communication.After staring intently at the map fixed on the wall for a moment, I walked out of the dormitory wearing a dull brown coat, unlike usual.* * *The factory area of Leathervelk where even the light of the stars and the moon disappeared due to the thick clouds in the sky.The chimney of the factory, which stood tall without emitting soot, was itself a tombstone in memory of those who died in the shadow of the city. Considering that there are people who actually died in difficult circumstances, the term tombstone was not particularly wrong.The slum district, called the abandoned district, had no street lights, which gave a strong feeling of desolation. All he could see was a rat that quickly swept across the floor.Rudger arrived at the place where even the vagrants gave up begging and escaped.\u201cAre you here?\u201dHans, who had come first and was waiting, greeted Rudger.Hans looked at Rudger\u2019s walk and shook his head, sticking out his tongue. Although he looked casual on the outside, Rudger was already heavily armed.From the chill that was flowing from him, Hans felt that he was thoroughly prepared for the fight to come.\u201cAre you going alone?\u201d\u201cWill you help me if I ask for help?\u201d\u201cNo, I just wondered if you would be able to deal with them alone.\u201d\u201cAlone is enough. What about the guys inside?\u201d\u201cThere are about forty. However, these guys know that their feet are on fire and are slowly trying to escape. If I was only three days late, they would have disappeared.\u201d\u201cWhat are their powers?\u201d\u201cIt would be nice to see that even a trivial person has at least one gun. Well, my brother, who is a wizard, doesn\u2019t like firearms, but there are about three of them wearing reinforced armor.\u201d\u201cElite power?\u201d\u201cTwo warlocks.\u201d\u201cRight.\u201dRudger, who was about to head straight to the laboratory, stopped his steps and asked Hans.\u201cHans, the family I asked about.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cHow old was the child?\u201dWith his back against the wall, Hans looked up as if to recall something.\u201cHe was seven years old, such a young kid.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Seven years old.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The rust and stench everywhere looked real, but as soon as he went a little deeper, that changed.The inner wall became clean and even the stench that was wafting disappeared.Rudger immediately killed his presence and moved slowly.\u201cI\u2019m bored to death. How much longer do we have to stay here?\u201d\u201cWe still have more than two days left, so shouldn\u2019t you wait a little longer?\u201d\u201cI mean, why did those damned subjects have to escape?\u201d\u201cMaybe it\u2019ll be okay because they haven\u2019t caught the tail yet. They\u2019re trying to organize everything and leave.\u201d\u201cStill, it would be better to stand guard like this. It\u2019s crazy to organize the equipment inside right now.\u201d\u201cIf only those dog-like bastards didn\u2019t escape.\u201dRudger leaned his back against the wall, listening to their conversation. The two of them, who were bored of standing by the guards at the entrance, did not stop chatting.\u201cI was out then, how did that happen?\u201d\u201cThey must have made a mistake. It was said that the kidnapped kid didn\u2019t get his medicine well, so his cryptidization was incomplete. Maybe it happened because he was young.\u201d\u201cSo?\u201d\u201cWhen I pulled him out to give him more test drugs, resistance developed.\u201d\u201cI heard that medication is very painful, is that true?\u201d\u201cThe problem was that his parents interfered.\u201d\u201cWhat? Parents? You said they were already werewolves, but they were trying to protect their cub?\u201d\u201cYes. Scientists didn\u2019t even know that could happen. They did more than expected, and the inside was a mess.\u201d\u201cDamn. So did they escape? Isn\u2019t it a bit dangerous then?\u201d\u201cPooh! The risk is bullshit. Do not worry because someone they trust was asked to deal with them. Anyway, if he had been there then, those bastards would have been unable to escape. We would not have to suffer like this.\u201dRudger felt he no longer needed to overhear their conversation because he knew everything about how things went.At the sound of Rudger stepping on the stagnant water, the two men, who were chatting, immediately shut their mouths and stared in his direction.\u201cWho is there?\u201d\u201cMaybe rats?\u201dMagic lamps were illuminating around the entrance, but the place where Rudger was standing was relatively dark and invisible.The two pulled out guns from their waists but before that, two rays of light flew out of the darkness and pierced their foreheads. Without even screaming, the two men guarding the entrance collapsed from their seats.Rudger slowly walked out of the darkness. From shin-high leather boots, black pants, a gray vest with full pockets with a shabby brown coat over it. A black hood was draped over his face, reaching up to his nose, and covering his head.* * *\u201cAww! Help me!\u201dThe man patrolling near the entrance desperately ran away from the monster that appeared from the dark and killed all his companions.Like a mirage, he appeared out of nowhere and instantly killed all of his comrades patrolling with him.\u2018What did the bastards who guarded the entrance do?\u2019The moment he thought about it, his vision changed.\u201cUh?\u201dHis body leaned forward and fell.\u201cWhy?\u201dHe looked down at his legs and only then did he realize. His two legs were cut off under the shin. The moment I realized it, the pain came.\u201cAgh!\u201dHe clenched his teeth and glared at the darkness behind him. Beyond the huge passageway, all the lights were off and it was pitch black.There was the sound of footsteps. His back became cold and the hairs all over his body stood up.It was the intruder who suddenly appeared and killed all his companions, he\u2019s already been chasing him.The intruder slowly emerged from the darkness. He appeared through the black veil, and his identity was unknown because his face was tightly covered but looking at his strong physique, it was clear that he was a man.He warned in a trembling voice.\u201cDid you think you will be okay if you touch us? I don\u2019t think you know who you are, but you\u2019re dead.\u201dThe man had no reaction, rather, the eyes seen through the shadow on the hood became sharper.His lips were dry and his throat burned. The moment he was wondering if he should beg for his life, a large number of people rushed through the passage.\u201cOver here!\u201dHe saw mercenaries approaching this way with magical lamps from afar. They were all carrying firearms, and among them, a particularly heavily armed figure stood out.\u201cThis way! Hahaha! You are finished now!\u201dRudger thrust his dagger into the man\u2019s mouth. As he drew his dagger, blood spattered and his body fell to the side. It was at that time that the troops that arrived just in time discovered Rudger.\u201cThere! Shoot it!\u201dAs it was a well-trained force, they aimed their guns straight at Rudger without asking anything. Rudger, meanwhile, remained silent.\u201cShoot!\u201dThey pulled the trigger right away.\u201cUh?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dNo matter how hard they pulled the trigger, their bullets didn\u2019t go out. It wasn\u2019t that the gun itself was broken, it was that the gunpowder had stopped working.A cold sweat ran down the cheek of the captain who gave the order to shoot, he knew from his own experience.\u201c[Silence of fire]! A wizard!\u201dA considerable amount of time has passed since the appearance of weapons made of gunpowder as the world changed. But even so, wizards and knights maintained their positions with one of the best powers in this world.It was because guns were not a threat at all to knights and wizards. Knights with superhuman physical abilities could easily dodge or cut through ordinary bullets. Conversely, the wizards did not need to do that because the magic called [Silence of fire] made it possible.[Silence of Fire]Literally, it is a magic that suppresses the performance of gunpowder within a certain range centering on the wizard. Its power can be used to neutralize even machine guns when used by a 3rd-level wizard. If it is used by a rank 5 or so, it can neutralize cannons.If it was used by a Lexorer-class wizard of the 6th rank, the war would change from then on. Even when the age of guns and gunpowder came, the wizards and knights were able to keep their place.However, the magic that Rudger can use ended at the 3rd level. Then, Rudger realized that he could not go any further and made up for his weaknesses by strengthening his existing magic.When a normal 3rd-tier wizard uses [Silence of Fire], the maximum effective range is a radius of 20m. And the effective range of [Silence of Fire] used by Rudger was 200m.\u201cDamn it! Pull out the knives!\u201dThose who belonged to the Shamsus School were quick to judge. They threw away the meaningless firearms and immediately took out their swords and clubs and grabbed them.An electric current flowed over the clubs. Rudger looked up and raised his hands. In each hand he held a revolver.\u201cYou idiot! If you use [Silence of Fire], your weapons are useless\u2026\u2026!\u201dThe man who was laughing at Rudger fell backwards, blood spraying from his forehead.Everyone watched the scene with a pale complexion. What just happened?\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cHow\u2026\u2026?\u201dRudger shot him but it wasn\u2019t a bullet he fired, to be precise it was magic in the shape of a bullet, therefore was not affected by [Silence of fire].\u201cThis person\u2026\u2026!\u201d\u201cDid you want us to have an equal fight?\u201dRudger laughed at the soldiers and fired magic bullets at random.\u201cBang! Bang!\u201dBut even though it seemed like rough shots, his muzzle was aimed precisely at the forehead and blew off the mercenaries heads. Blood and screams erupted in an instant.\u201cYou idiots! Everyone out!\u201dA figure dressed in huge armor stepped forward. The reinforced armor made of black synthetic metal easily deflected the magic bullets Rudger fired. It was an external suit called reinforced armor made thanks to the development of engineering.Although the speed was slow, it was very sturdy and produced an enormous amount of power to be used exclusively against knights.\u201cDie!\u201dThe warrior in reinforced armor ran towards Rudger with his arms wide open. Rudger wasn\u2019t frightened and after retrieving the lifted revolver, he pulled out two crescent-shaped karambit daggers from his waist and held them.\u201cA wizard fighting with daggers?\u201dThe moment he stretched out his arm to almost grab Rudger by the neck, Rudger disappeared.\u2018What? Where did he disappear?\u2019The moment the man in reinforced armor was bewildered by the sight, a terrible pain ran down his forearm. Blood gushed out through the gaps in the armor.\u201cAww! What!?\u201dIt was because a dagger was pierced through the seams of the armor.\u201cHow? No, it was so fast I couldn\u2019t even see it\u2026\u2026\u201dThe moment he tried to move his left arm, there was no force in it. It was because something cold and sharp grazed past his armpits.\u201cUh, what\u2026\u2026\u201dThen it was both ankles.Before he could come to his senses, the tendons in both of his legs were cut off and he knelt on his knees and lastly cold steel touched his neck.\u201cLive\u2026\u2026\u201dRudger listened no further and cut off his throat with a karambit dagger.\u201cDamn it! Gabe died!\u201d\u201cMove! I\u2019m out!\u201dWhat came out this time was a slightly different form of reinforced armor. He was wearing brass armor that was more yellowish than black and white steam gushed out from behind his shoulders.A reinforced exoskeleton made from a steam engine. He held a giant barrel in both hands, and the tip of the barrel was connected to a large Tesla coil hanging from his back.\u201cDie!\u201dA purple current engulfed the passage. The high-voltage current of the Tesla gun, which cannot be suppressed by [Silence of Fire], spread in all directions.\u201cKah ha ha! How about this?\u201dBut he had to stop laughing.It was because the high-voltage electric current he had fired was not moving as if it had been blocked in front of Rudger\u2019s nose.\u201cWhat?\u201dNo, to be precise, it was seeping into a single piece of metal that rose in front of him. Was that metal magic with alchemy? Perhaps he was a wizard who handled metal among the elemental elements?The Tesla gun that fires high voltage does not work against wizards who use metal elemental magic. He realized that, but it was already too late. Rudger pulled out his revolver and shot. It hit the muzzle of the Tesla gun and it exploded.Electricity spread all over the place, and everyone nearby was charred. The only one who managed to survive, leaning his back against the wall, stared at Rudger, who was slowly approaching him. His half body was already charred and he was barely breathing.\u201cThis crazy bastard. Why are you doing this to us?\u201dHe asked that because he didn\u2019t understand, but Rudger didn\u2019t even respond and just passed him by.He couldn\u2019t survive in that state anyway, so he decided to leave him in the pain longer.\u2018How many people have I dealt with so far?\u2019About twenty people so only half are left inside. Seeing that they weren\u2019t coming this way, it was clear that they were preparing to fight him inside.Most of all, I felt the gaze. The gaze pierced through the cracks in the pipes that filled the wall.\u2018Is it black magic using worms?\u2019Hans said there were two warlocks inside. Some of the warlocks share vision with worms so they can explore hard-to-see areas. It\u2019s probably one of them watching him right now.\u201cWhoa.\u201dRudger exhaled lightly and lifted his right foot, rolling it lightly to the ground.\u201cTung\u201dThe sound of crashing the floor was heard and it became a wave that spread wide.* * *Inside the laboratory the scientists had no choice but to tremble with great anxiety.\u201cIs this okay? We need to destroy the data right away and get the experimental drugs\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cOh, it\u2019s okay because I said it\u2019s okay.\u201dIt was a blond man with a tattoo on his neck that stifled the ill scientist. His attire was also quite light, and he didn\u2019t even have a weapon, so it looked as if he was out on a picnic.But everyone knew that this man was the most influential warlock in the laboratory. The same goes for the tall, bald-haired man who was quietly standing next to him.The bald man\u2019s name was Veron and the blonde man was called Bruno. Although they were not related by blood, the two were called worm brothers.\u201cAfter all, there is only one opponent.\u201dBruno divulged the information he had discovered.Surprisingly, there was only one intruder. Only one person wiped out an army equipped with firearms and two people in reinforced armor alone.\u201cDamn, who\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWell, we don\u2019t know. Perhaps the Imperial Security Agency noticed us.\u201dAn organization made up of only the most elite of the Empire, they even had a knight order belonging to them, the Nightcrawler Knights.Of course, they are slightly different from the ordinary knights. The scariest thing about them was that their individual force was powerful, but they used any means and methods to achieve their goals.Although they\u2019re knights, they don\u2019t act as sternly as other knights. Rather, they thoroughly scrutinize the opponent\u2019s weaknesses, dig into them, and kill them. They can mercilessly kill even a three-year-old child if judged to be harmful to the country.\u201cThe way he fights is a little bit strange. I wanted to see more with the bugs, but I don\u2019t know what kind of trick he used, that all the signals from the bugs were cut off.\u201d\u201cMaybe he noticed that you were watching.\u201d\u201cBrother we need to prepare.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe older brother, Veron, got up and the men guarding the laboratory were also very nervous and raised their shields and weapons. They stared intently at the passage from the entrance to the center of the laboratory and got ready to meet the intruder.A strange wave swept through the interior of the laboratory, then all the lights went out and darkness fell.\u201cWhat?! Come on, turn on the lights!\u201d\u201cUse the reserve generator!\u201dSeeing the men moving in haste, Bruno turned to his older brother.\u201cBrother, I think he must have done his tricks.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cBrother?\u201dThere was no answer from Veron.Bruno looked at Veron and even in the dark, his bulky figure was clearly distinguishable by his silhouette but his head was cut off and rolled on the floor.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Brother!\u201dAs soon as Bruno saw that Veron\u2019s head had been severed, he responded immediately. Countless insects squirmed from the crevices of his clothes. Bruno quickly shook his head.\u2018He used sound waves and even metal.\u2019Attribute elements are divided into a total of 10.<Fire> <Water> <Wind> <Earth> <Wood><Lighting> <Metal> <Ice> <Dark> <Light>And unknown ones that have not yet been discovered.In the case of sound magic, it used vibrations in the atmosphere, so it was often viewed as a derivation of the wind element and when Rudger stopped the Tesla Gun, he used <Metal> attribute magic.\u2018Metal element is derived from the earth. Attribute elements that can be used usually consist only of similar series.\u2019Bruno judged that there were three elemental magic\u2019s Rudger used: <Wind>, <Earth>, and <Metal>.In the case of ordinary wizards, there are only two or three attributes that they could use.No matter how much ability they have, up to 4. From 5, it can be said that is the realm of innate talent. As a result, wizards basically set their opponents to three elements because that was common sense and it was natural.\u2018When it comes to the wind element, tiny flying insects are not good. If that\u2019s the case, then I\u2019ll have to release the big guy.\u2019He did not rule out the possibility that Rudger could use a fourth element, just in case.Protruding from Bruno\u2019s sleeve was a giant centipede with a thick carapace. It was a worm that was not found in the general ecosystem, but was created through black magic and subspecies hybridization with a special object caught in the southern jungle.However, the head of the centipede that Bruno pulled out was cut off in an instant. It took less than a second for that sharp sword to target his neck.\u201cWhat!\u201dBy twisting his body, Bruno was able to deflect Rudger\u2019s blade and block it. Hard scarabs were wrapped around his body, hidden under his clothes, like chain armor.\u2018A close-up fight? Maybe it\u2019s a war mage?\u2019Bruno immediately tried to distance himself from Rudger but at that moment, a formula was engraved on Rudger\u2019s face. Bruno\u2019s eyes widened.\u2018That\u2019s [Fluttering Flame]!\u2019The third-tier flame elemental magic, the fluttering flame, blew out intense flames in less than a second and engulfed Bruno.\u201cAww!\u201dWith Bruno\u2019s scream, a fire broke out and the surroundings became brighter. The soldiers, who had been staring at only the entrance, looked back and widened their eyes.\u201cThe enemy!\u201d\u201cHow the hell?!\u201dBut in the meantime, Bruno twisted his body in the scorching heat. Fire was the most difficult magic for those who deal with bugs.He was using an element completely unrelated to the other three. It was unbelievable.\u201cDamn, how can you?\u201dAll the bugs managed to survive, but Bruno\u2019s condition was not very good either. His face half melted from his full body burns, and he flopped down, staring at Rudger.\u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dInstead of answering, Rudger pulled out his revolver and blew off Bruno\u2019s head. At the same time, the reserve power was activated and the light returned to the inside of the laboratory.\u201cHuh!\u201d\u201cThe bug brothers are dead.\u201dThe soldiers who were in charge of the security inside were at a loss as they saw the bodies of Bruno and Veron. The soldiers lost their will, they couldn\u2019t fight a monster like that.Everyone backed away from Rudger in fear, but a change took place in Veron\u2019s corpse, which had fallen after his neck had been cut off.\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dRudger responded immediately. The moment he threw his body forward, a huge hand scraped through the space where Rudger had been a while ago. It was an insect\u2019s forelimbs, full of sharp thorns on a bare carapace.The other people who were watching the scene were stunned.\u201cIsn\u2019t he dead?\u201dRudger asked as he looked at Veron moving with excitement.After his head was cut off, Veron\u2019s body stood up again. What struck Rudger a while ago was his bizarrely deformed right hand. Veron held out his left hand, which was still in human form. The palm of his hand had a mouth.\u201cYou became an insect?\u201d\u201cSurprised?\u201dBruno dealt with bugs. Conversely, his older brother, Veron, was large and did not deal with insects. But then I wondered why they are called worm brothers.\u2018It was like that.\u2019Veron was a warlock whose body itself mutated into a kind of bug. Since such a body could not change naturally, he actually used his body as an experiment in black magic.Why Warlocks are crazy people, Veron gave a clear example of that.\u201cEven so, your head was cut off, but you\u2019re fine.\u201d\u201cMy body is no longer like a normal person.\u201dAt the same time as those words, Veron\u2019s body changed with a horrifying sound of \u2018Kudduk!\u2019The black robes surrounding his body swelled and then countless thorns popped out.Rudger stepped back. Still, the gigantic Veron turned even bigger and looked down at Rudger. He was a monster that looked like a mixture of several insects. At this point, Rudger couldn\u2019t tell if he was a warlock or a cryptid.[You killed my brother. I\u2019m not sad, but you have to take responsibility for that.]Veron\u2019s arms were being pulled back, and then shot towards Rudger like an arrow. Rudger immediately flew upwards using a wire launcher. Veron\u2019s stab passed almost under Rudger\u2019s feet, and the soldiers behind him were pierced instead.\u201cAww!\u201d\u201cRun away!\u201dEven though his men were screaming and dying, Veron didn\u2019t care. Veron lifted his head and looked at Rudger.\u201cKugugung!\u201dAt that moment, the steel structures on the ceiling collapsed and fell on Veron\u2019s head.Even though a significant amount of reinforcing bars had fallen, Veron remained intact. There were only a few scratches on his carapace, but no wounds.[Did you mean to draw my attention with something like this?]Veron turned his gigantic head and looked at Rudger as he rode the wire and landed on the ground. He was clearly provoking him, but Rudger didn\u2019t show much of a reaction.\u2018It bothered me.\u2019Veron\u2019s body was already out of the realm of ordinary bugs. With such a gigantic body, the carapace that wraps around it was also hard, so it was no wonder that it was actually called a monster that surpassed a warlock.\u2018That\u2019s why I hate warlocks.\u2019Rudger stopped firing the revolver and retrieved all of his weapons. Because he realized that even if he shot a hundred bullets, he wouldn\u2019t hurt him.[Are you giving up?]Veron laughed at Rudger\u2019s behavior, but instead he stretched out his hand towards Veron.[What are you trying to do?]Rudger\u2019s gesture of extending his arm toward him not only stimulated Veron\u2019s curiosity, but also aroused discomfort.Was he trying to use magic? However, it was virtually impossible to damage Veron unless it was a 4th rank or higher magic and he judged that Rudger was a wizard of the third rank.The speed of the magic unfolding was bizarrely fast, but that\u2019s all. He didn\u2019t think that such a Rudger would be able to deal a decent blow to him.Veron decided to wait and see what the intruder would do.\u201cI didn\u2019t want to use something like this in this situation.\u201d[Hmm?]\u201cWell, I can\u2019t help it.\u201dA pure white light filled the inside of the laboratory.* * *\u201cWhoops. It\u2019s still chilly.\u201dHans, who was waiting for Rudger outside the abandoned factory, trembled as he put his hands in his pockets in the still chilly night air.Thirty minutes have passed since Rudger went inside.\u2018The end is near.\u2019Rudger didn\u2019t try hard enough, but Hans realized he was a bit angry, after all, he did it himself.They kidnap a 7-year-old kid and his parents and use them as human experiments. No matter how dishonest he is, there is a law called \u201cgoodness\u201d that must be observed even for those who do such things. That Shamsus School crossed that line too badly.\u2018He\u2019s a little late. Is it because there were two warlocks?\u2019Especially if those warlocks were the Bug Brothers but Hans didn\u2019t think Rudger would die. He\u2019s known him for several years and if Rudger would\u2019ve died it would\u2019ve happened a few years ago, that\u2019s how strong he became.Wasn\u2019t he a human who hunted monsters in J\u00e9vaudan alone when he was working as a hunter in the first place? The number of knights that the monster ate alone was over five but Rudger hunted it alone.Rudger was not only the only hunter named \u2018Abraham van Helsing\u2019 he was also a private detective, a thief, crime consultant, mercenary, artist and so on.He had many faces, and the masks he wore in the past always made a big impact.Flash!At that moment a strong light that hurt his eyes was emitted from the entire abandoned factory. At the same time, the light turned into flames, turning the abandoned factory into a sea of fire. The terrifying power that blew up a large factory.Hans knew very well whose work it was.He once asked Rudger what it was and the strange answer he got was \u2018real magic\u2019.\u2018If it\u2019s magic, it\u2019s magic, what is real magic?\u2019Anyway, the fact that Rudger used it would mean that the opponent was formidable.* * *Rudger came out with the materials in the laboratory and the experimental drugs used on the subjects in a suitcase. Hans, who was waiting outside, greeted him.\u201cAre you here? Let\u2019s leave first. Even if the factory was abandoned because it was so flashy, the police will come.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s all taken care of.\u201dAfter defeating Veron, Rudger checked the depths of the laboratory. He saw the appearance of terrible subjects trapped in iron cages in the dark. All of them were ordinary people who had their own daily lives however, their daily life eventually fell apart.Those who suffer as their bodies mutate, lose their reason, and cross borders where it is difficult to call them human. The only mercy that Rudger could bestow upon them was to let them go without pain. So Rudger blew up the entire laboratory, killed the scientists, and left with their research reports and experimental results.\u201cIs this it?\u201dHans asked, looking at the tube with the red liquid inside the suitcase he had received from Rudger.\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThe world is very scary. There must have been some people in a place like this who did experiments on humans. I never imagined that scientists and inventors would have teamed up with warlocks.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not just that.\u201d\u201cWhat else have you found?\u201d\u201cHow do you think they hid a secret lab that big?\u201d\u201cThat\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThere is someone behind the scenes who has given them a huge amount of funding.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026I don\u2019t think that\u2019s normal.\u201dThey would need a large amount of money to build a laboratory like that without anyone else\u2019s knowledge.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Because I already know who they are.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dAt Rudger\u2019s answer, Hans felt uneasy.\u201cTake this.\u201dHans immediately accepted the suitcase.\u201cI will go to the hideout first. Stop by after work.\u201dHans left without hearing Rudger\u2019s answer.Rudger stood still for a while. From afar, the bright red flames from the burning factory lit up the dark abandoned factory area. It was like a candle burning most brilliantly just before it went out.* * *Inside a gorgeous mansion Richie Bellbot Rickson threw a plate of food brought to him by his maid. The maid hit by the plate fell bleeding from her forehead. The food on the plate stained her clothes and face but no one supported or helped her.The old man in his 60s, with a white beard growing tired of it, glared at the maid disgustedly.\u201cDid you serve this as food? It\u2019s like garbage that can\u2019t properly pay for it even if I give it money.\u201dBellbot got up and left, he was a man who stood out as a very successful capitalist in the changing times. But when he achieved success, he was an old man full of tiny wrinkles. In the end, he sacrificed his youth to get to this position.He wanted to get his youth back so he supported the warlocks in some kind of experiment. Recently, he heard that some of the subjects escaped and the experiment was disrupted.\u2018Damn! Stupid bastards! Garbage bastards!\u2019Bellbot was so angry inside and returned to his room.\u2018Still, the experiment wasn\u2019t meaningless. Sooner or later, the right results will come out.\u2019A drug that will restore a weakened human body to its heyday, the elixir of youth was not far away. It\u2019s not just about getting younger, it\u2019s about becoming healthier and stronger.Thinking like that, he was about to turn on the light in his large room that had been turned off.\u201cBellbot Rickson.\u201d\u201cWhat?! Who are you?\u201dThere was someone in the middle of the room. Bellbot tried to turn on the magic light, but something went wrong and the light wouldn\u2019t come on. In the darkness where even the moonlight does not enter, Bellbot was trapped in a room alone with an unidentified intruder.\u201cGuards! Security!\u201d\u201cThey can\u2019t hear you even if you scream.\u201dThere was already a sound barrier around the room, of course, since it is the house of a wealthy man. If he used that kind of magic, an alarm would go off right away but Rudger\u2019s magic was so secretive that he didn\u2019t activate the alarm magic.Rudger, who was sitting in his chair, got up and slowly approached Bellbot.\u201cBellbot Rickson, I will ask you one thing.\u201d\u201cWhat? Who are you? Reveal your identity!\u201d\u201cA seven-year-old child desperately tries to survive this horrific reality while watching himself and his parents become monsters.\u201d\u201cAww!\u201dRudger reached out his arm, grabbed Bellbot by the collar, and brought him close to his face. His eyes glowed red in the darkness.\u201cHow do you think a person who has no choice but to burn them to death even though he knows it feels?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Sorry for the irregular releases, I\u2019ll try to get back to the normal schedule from next week.Rudger still remembered that moment. Those clear eyes that looked up at him while licking his injured mother. Even though he used magic to kill them, he was grateful for that innocence.\u201cI don\u2019t know! How do I know! Who are you?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t know?\u201dRudger tossed the Bellbot Rickson to the floor. Bellbot, who was old and ill, fell to the floor and grabbed his waist.\u201cGreat. you, what are you?\u201d\u201cDo you know what this is?\u201dRudger took a pre-packaged test drug from his pocket and tossed it in front of the Bellbot. A red liquid that looks like melted ruby was inside the transparent glass tube.Bellbot who gave the instructions for it to be made couldn\u2019t ignore it.\u201cThis!\u201d\u201cNow do you understand?\u201d\u201cWhat do you want from me? Do you want money?\u201dBellbot realized his opponent caught his weakness. He was capable of sneaking into his own room, and he didn\u2019t know how he got it, but he even had a drug from an experiment he was involved in. Maybe he was from the Nightcrawler Knights?\u2018Damn! How the heck did those worm brothers do their job!\u2019He invested a huge amount of money into the experiment and now a stranger entered his residence but he couldn\u2019t show dissatisfaction. He didn\u2019t know who the man in front of him was but he was holding his lifeline.\u201cI won\u2019t hold you accountable for sneaking in but you must want something since you decided to see me in secret.\u201d\u201cWhat do I want?\u201d\u201cDo you want money? I have a lot of money and I can give you anything you want.\u201dBut the answer that came back from Rudger was far beyond Bellbot\u2019s expectations.\u201cAnswer.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cAnswer the question I just asked.\u201dBellbot shook his head as much as he could, trying to recall Rudger\u2019s question.\u201cWere you the one who got rid of the escaped specimen by any chance?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cSo it was you! I think there was a misunderstanding. Thanks to you, the situation didn\u2019t get much worse.\u201d\u201cJust answer my questions.\u201d\u201cOh, okay! That 7-year-old child test subject, right? What\u2019s wrong with that? He already became a monster, and he\u2019d rather die before being discovered.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t they low-class citizens who people don\u2019t even know that they exist? No matter how many of them died, what would be sad about that? Rather, they gave their lives to achieve great results, so they made a noble sacrifice.\u201dBellbot said they were making a noble sacrifice.Workers or the poor, how many of the lower class who roll in the mud of society die, what does that have to do with him?Rather, if they become a cornerstone for completing a drug that brings human youthfulness as test subjects they would at least contribute to mankind.\u201cEven if dirty people work in a factory for a hundred days, sweating profusely, how much money can they really make?\u201dIt was far more productive to use that meaningless life for something more important.\u201cIs the answer enough?\u201d\u201cYes. That\u2019s enough.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026\u2026\u201dRudger grabbed Bellbot\u2019s neck. Bellbot rolled his eyes and grabbed Rudger\u2019s forearm with both hands, but his hand was too strong to be resisted by Bellbot\u2019s old body.\u201cWhy?\u201dI answered correctly! Bellbot\u2019s eyes were protesting towards Rudger.Rudger did not answer, but instead placed the bottle of the drug he had brought in front of Bellbot\u2019s face and poured it into his mouth.Bellbot desperately tried to resist, but even that was impossible because his neck was caught.The red drug passed through Bellbot\u2019s throat. At the same time, changes began to take place in his body.\u201cAaaaaaaaaaaah!\u201dAlong with the pain as if it was being torn apart, Bellbot\u2019s body began to slowly swell. After Rudger released his neck, he retreated and watched the scene.As the time passed, his wrinkled skin became taut, and eventually split to the left and right, and his hair grew abundantly. But his changes did not stop there. The hair that had grown out fell out, revealing the reddish skin, and it started to swell like a bubble.Bellbot drank an entire bottle of the drug while the test subjects were only administered a small part of a bottle at once. The amount that Bellbot drank had already far exceeded the standard.\u201cOuch! Why! Why!!!\u201dEven as his body was torn, twisted, and changed, Bellbot couldn\u2019t help but cry out to Rudger. His face was strangely contorted and half mixed with that of a beast and from his throat came a cry that didn\u2019t sound human or animal.\u201cAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah\u201d\u201cNo matter what I say, you won\u2019t even understand, let alone repent.\u201dYou don\u2019t have to understand. Instead, feel the pain you inflicted on others. Rudger canceled the sound blocking magic he had spread out.\u201cTirriririring!\u201dAt the same time, an alarm in response to magical power went off throughout the mansion. After that, the screams of Bellbot, who had become a monster, reverberated.\u201cKwaaaaaaah!\u201d\u201cWhat is this sound?!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s an intruder! The alarm came from Bellbot-sama\u2019s place!\u201d\u201cThud! Thud\u201dA guard from outside knocked on the door. Suddenly, the locked door shattered and strong men rushed inside. Among them was a freelance mage hired to guard Bellbot.\u201cA monster!\u201d\u201cWhere is this monster from?\u201d\u201cEveryone get out of the way!\u201dThe wizard immediately performed fire magic and burned the monster. Contrary to its bizarre appearance, the monster caught fire so easily.Thanks to its tenacious life force his body regenerated as it burned and the process of burning it down continued. Even the wizard felt a sense of crisis and poured out all his magical powers to set off fire.An hour passed like that and the monster\u2019s body, which could no longer regenerate, collapsed.\u201cUgh. It\u2019s finally over.\u201d\u201cWhat about Bellbot?\u201d\u201cFind him.\u201dNo matter how bad-tempered he was, he was the employer who paid their salaries, so people were desperate to find Bellbot Rickson.However, no matter how much they looked around, they could not find Bellbot, and there was no trace of him. They had no choice but to come to the conclusion that Bellbot Rickson was eaten by the monster.At the same time they did not know that the secret safe hidden inside Bellbot\u2019s room, which contained his entire wealth, was stolen.* * *\u201cAre you here?\u201dThe hideout that Hans told me about was a shabby house nestled deep in the alleyways of Leathervelk commercial district.However, the only bad thing was the exterior, and when I went inside, there was no smell and the interior was very neat. It looks like an ordinary tavern from the outside, but it was just a trick.\u201cYou picked a pretty good place.\u201d\u201cIt is a commercial area adjacent to the factory area.\u201d\u201cWhat about the surrounding area?\u201d\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been confirmed yet, but it is certain that the ecology of Leathervelk Backstreet is quite complicated. We need more time.\u201d\u201cRight.\u201dRudger said so, and he put the safe he had brought on the floor.Hans\u2019s eyes widened.\u201cWhat is that? It must have taken a lot of effort to bring it.\u201d\u201cNot really.\u201d\u201cSo this is a safe?\u201d\u201cYes. It had magic security, but I unlocked it on the way.\u201dHans opened the door to the safe to check the contents, and immediately closed it.\u201c\u2026\u2026So many?\u201d\u201cSpend some of it on work and hide the rest in a suitable place for now.\u201d\u201cUnderstood. Are you going to go now?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cYou look a little tired, so go take a break. I also have a separate room for you.\u201d\u201cI will check it later. It seems that I will come back soon anyway.\u201d\u201cWith what kind of status will you come next time?\u201d\u201cThe thing that suits you best when you\u2019re moving in the underworld.\u201d\u201cOh, you mean that?\u201dHans didn\u2019t ask any more since Rudger must have been quite tired from today\u2019s fight.\u201cGet a good rest. I will try to finish my work as soon as possible.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dRudger came out of the hideout with weary steps. The air in the back alley, where people don\u2019t come and go, melted and stuck to the skin like glue.While walking Rudger could sense that people were watching him from beyond the darkness of a deeper alley. They hyenas in the back alley glanced at Rudger but withdrew, realizing that they were no match for him.When he was completely out of the alleyway, Rudger took off the hood over his head and pulled down the fabric that covered his mouth and nose.As he was still gazing at the Ramzier River, where some steamships were roaming, a loud bell rang out from the towering clock tower in the center of Leathervelk.\u201cDang! Dang! Dang!\u201dIt was the sound of midnight.Rudger continued to stare at the darkened Ramzier River.* * *[The death of the rich man, Bellbot Rickson]It was a headline that adorned the front page of a newspaper issued to the city of Leathervelk the next day.The death of Bellbot, a vicious entrepreneur and one of Leathervelk richest people, was enough to heat up Leathervelk. Even more so if his cause of death was from a werewolf attack.The monster was exterminated by the wizard who was guarding the inside of the mansion, but the death of Bellbot himself was quite a big issue.Some said that Bellbot had been punished, while others said that Bellbot used evil black magic and died because he couldn\u2019t control it. Reporters have been clamoring for days in front of Rickson\u2019s mansion to be let in.A black car stopped behind the reporters.\u201cYes?\u201dThe reporters stared at the man who got out of the car.There were a total of three people who got off, and they were all wearing the same outfit, black uniform with golden epaulets.The reporters\u2019 eyes widened when they recognized the attire that only authorized people could wear commonly referred to as a black coat.\u201cThe sheriff!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s also the Nightcrawler Knights!\u201dThe Sheriff\u2019s Office wasn\u2019t exactly a secret organization. On the contrary, it had a tremendous reputation in the bright field, and a terrible notoriety even in the shade.The reporters gulped their saliva.They came to the entrance of the mansion simply for the sake of gossip, but if the security bureau stepped in, the story would be different.\u2018Scoop.\u2019One word kept running through the reporters\u2019 heads.\u2018We won\u2019t be able to get inside anyway, so we have to write something related to the security department.\u2019\u2018If the security bureau stepped in, it means that it was a serious matter. Even that person at the forefront\u2026\u2026\u2019Cold silver hair that perfectly contrasts with the black coat with gold and red stitching in harmony. The woman with the sharp impression who turned it up to reveal her forehead was a very famous person.\u201cTrina Ryanhowl.\u201dThe head of the marquis Ryanhowl family, who symbolizes the protection of the empire. She belonged to the Security Bureau, and was the Knights Commander leading the Nightcrawler Knights. Her nickname is widely known as Lord Protector.The reporters quickly got out of the way as they saw Trina walking towards the mansion. With a sharp charisma, she was the idol of all knights in the empire.\u201cOpen the door.\u201dWhen the security bureau stepped in, even the guards guarding the entrance had no choice but to sweat.\u201cDon\u2019t let anyone in\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cDoor.\u201dTrina said, pointing her finger at the guard.\u201cOpen it.\u201d\u201cYes Yes!\u201dThe contemplative guard moved immediately.The gate of the Rickson mansion, which had been firmly shut, opened wide.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The police inspecting the scene of the crime saw her and saluted by standing upright.\u201cMarquis Trina! It\u2019s an honor to meet you! My name is Inspector Tevoran!\u201d\u201cOh, yes.\u201d\u201cMay I ask what the cause of Marquis Trina\u2019s coming here is?\u201d\u201cAs of now, all investigation rights into the murder that took place at the Rickson Mansion will be done by our Sheriff\u2019s Office.\u201d\u201cThe Sheriff Office?\u201dInspector Tevoran, with a long beard and sideburns, swallowed his saliva.He didn\u2019t think it was just a simple murder case, but it\u2019s had to be extremely dangerous if the security bureau came.\u201cSir, I\u2019m sorry! Everyone get out!\u201dThe inspector and his subordinates quickly escaped from the scene. What they had to do now was to stop reporters from the front door, who still had their eyes on what was happening inside the mansion.As their sight faded, the younger of the two lieutenants, a man and a woman who followed Trina, relaxed.\u201cUgh. I\u2019m bad at setting the mood.\u201d\u201cEnya, even if others don\u2019t see, act up to the reputation of the Nightcrawler Knights.\u201dEnya rolled her eyes at the nagging of Lloyd, who was scolding her.\u201cNo, old man. Anyway, there is no need to go all the way here.\u201d\u201cEnya, you\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cStop it, Lloyd. You just have to not show yourself that way in front of others.\u201d\u201cLook. That\u2019s what the manager said too.\u201d\u201cThis little thing\u2026\u201dLieutenant Lloyd finally shook his head and raised the white flag.The Nightcrawler Knights was a place where only the elite gathered like the knights that guard the center of the empire, but it was also a place where seniors and juniors talked comfortably among themselves. It was all because Trina, the commander of the knights, liked that kind of atmosphere. However, the rules were not loose.Above all, the fact that the discipline of the Nightcrawler Knights has not collapsed is proof that the current leader, Trina Ryanhowl, possesses great power and charisma.\u201cDo not forget why we came here.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dThis case was evaluated not as an ordinary case, but as a serious matter that even the Security Agency had to step in. In particular, in terms of the connection between cryptids and black magic, it was unusually serious because Trina, the commander of the knights, came out directly.\u201cAlthough it\u2019s still just a rumor, the dead Bellbot was a man on our security bureau\u2019s list of things to watch out for because of his suspicious behavior. The fact that he was suddenly killed by a monster cannot be considered a mere coincidence.\u201dLloyd and Enya nodded at Trina\u2019s words.The three immediately began exploring Rickson\u2019s room. Broken windows that looked like an intruder had entered and black marks that could be said to be traces of a dead monster. There was also blood, presumably belonging to Bellbot, scattered around.According to eyewitness accounts, a monster appeared and Rickson was murdered. Given that their statements are all identical and consistent, she didn\u2019t think they\u2019re lying.For more than 10 minutes, they moved in search of clues, but there was no sign of anything special. Lloyd was about to say something, thinking he had searched everything. It was then that Trina, who had been contemplating with her arms folded, suddenly strode towards a wall.\u201cChief?\u201d\u201cCome here.\u201dTrina stared at the pictures hanging on the wall. Bellbot, as one of the wealthiest people in Leathervelk, decorated his room with all kinds of colorful artworks.She came closer to the wall and touched the frame borders of the picture then she lifted it in the corner and set it aside.\u201cChief, what is that picture?\u201d\u201cThere is space behind it.\u201dEnya asked, staring at the empty space with curious eyes.Trina crossed her arms and said in a hoarse voice.\u201cGiven its size and location, it was probably the place where he hid a secret safe.\u201d\u201cA secret safe?\u201d\u201cBecause Bellbot Rickson was notorious for being a wealthy man and a vicious entrepreneur he must have evaded the eyes of the Empire and hid his black money.\u201d\u201cIs this the safe where he kept them?\u201d\u201cBut there is no safe.\u201dLloyd, realizing something about, opened his mouth with a heavy face.\u201cSomeone took it.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThen who took it? The users of the mansion? Shall we start with the most suspicious butler first?\u201dAt Enya\u2019s words, Trina shook her head.\u201cNo it won\u2019t make any sense. The butler has nothing to do with this.\u201d\u201cYeah?\u201d\u201cThere is no way a man like Bellbot would have entrusted his slush funds to anyone else. He probably hid it thoroughly so that only he knew.\u201d\u201cBut this place is empty.\u201d\u201cJust because he didn\u2019t tell doesn\u2019t mean people don\u2019t know.\u201dTrina also discovered this secret space right away.\u201cEntrepreneurs, wealthy people, and merchants all have the same thoughts. They\u2019re not very fond of opening an account in a bank. They always want to have a spot or gold coins within their reach that they can use right away. That makes them feel comfortable.\u201d\u201cThen who took it?\u201d\u201cWe have to find out. It\u2019s just a guess, but the person who stole the safe must have something to do with Rickson\u2019s death.\u201d\u201cBut everyone said Bellbot Rickson was eaten by a werewolf.\u201d\u201cI doubt it was a werewolf. Look at the traces that still remain. Nearly half the floor of this spacious room is on fire. It was burned by magic, so it did not spread into a fire. They say it was burned only with a precise range of flames, but it is still that size.\u201d\u201cThat is\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThe height of a werewolf won\u2019t exceed three meters. It is very large, but even if you burn such a being to death, the traces won\u2019t be of that size.\u201dAnd it is said that those who actually witnessed the werewolf mistook it for a \u201cmonster\u201d at first.\u201cThe result is that someone was involved in the death of Bellbot Rickson. Unnatural death, the appearance of a monster and even the bad rumors about Bellbot, there is still a lot left to check.\u201dWhat bothered Trina more than anything was the ability of an unidentified intruder to take the safe that should have been inside without leaving any trace.\u2018No way. There must have been a safe here. Until last night, too.\u2019The proof is that the floor has not yet accumulated dust. Even in an enclosed space, air and dust are bound to pass through.\u2018If so, who took it?\u2019This feeling of trying to grab a blurry mirage with her hands was not unfamiliar to her. She felt a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.A few years ago there was a thief who made the continent tremble. Blurred as if wrapped in the darkness of the night, his movements were so unpredictable that no one had ever seen his true face. The person who easily broke through any strict security and wiped away valuables without leaving a trace, making many rich people weep, Phantom Thief <Arsene Lupin>.\u2018Maybe that phantom\u2026\u2026 No, no. It\u2019s been a few years since he stopped working, but now he came back?\u2019Even if it wasn\u2019t him, she couldn\u2019t deny the possibility that it was an acquaintance, an accomplice or a disciple.\u201cLloyd.\u201d\u201cYes, chief.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t there anything unusual about the incident that happened in Leathervelk?\u201d\u201cUh, um. There was one thing.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cOne of the factories in the abandoned factory area has been burned down in a fire on the same day Bellbot died.\u201dWhat could have caused an abandoned factory to be burned down?* * *The werewolf situation that had made Theon and Leathervelk noisy came to an end with the death of a rich man. By the way, I was ill right now in my dorm room.\u2018If I had known this would happen, I would have prepared a little more. It\u2019s a good thing I don\u2019t have classes today, otherwise it would have been a disaster.\u2019Rather than my aching body, the subtle headaches are the most painful.Lying on the bed, I took out three pills and popped them into my mouth. Others may think of it as a headache or pain reliever, but this is literally a chewable mana potion that replenishes magical power.Usually, when it comes to recovering magical power, it is mainly to recover automatically over time or drink a potion but now, with the development of pharmaceuticals it became possible to grind the magic recovery potion into a powder and drink it with water, or to mix it with starch and eat it like me because powder or pills are easier to store and carry than to hang around with potions.In other words, the pill itself that restores magical power is not a very strange product. Now it\u2019s just the difference in how effective the same drug is. Therefore, what is important in pharmaceuticals is the efficiency of how well it works compared to the ingredients used.Effect risk and efficiency. Combining these three factors, the drug is graded from the best grade 1 to the lowest grade 10. The pills I am currently taking are my original recovery pills that I made myself.An item that maximizes the effect at the cost of slightly increasing the risk because of my \u201cbody condition\u201d. Because it\u2019s my special product that wasn\u2019t entrusted to clinical trials, a grade tag wasn\u2019t attached.\u2018The problem is that I used too much force. I always finished my battles quickly, but who would have known that he was a warlock who had changed his body in that way?\u2019Because of the older worm brother Veron, I had no choice but to use the \u2018real magic\u2019, not the magic of this world. It\u2019s not about magic or knowledge of this world, but magic with the occult and mythological knowledge of the world I used to live in.If there\u2019s a problem, it\u2019s that the aftereffects aren\u2019t a joke. The fact that I periodically take medicines that replenish my magic power was something I had to go through because I learned this magic.[\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501]The sound that kept tormenting me gradually fades away and then disappears. This voice can only be suppressed by using magic power, so I have become a constitution that consumes magic power even if I normally breathe. Therefore, it is necessary to periodically replenish my insufficient mana.\u2018It\u2019s a little better.\u2019As the headache subsided, another thought occurred to me. This werewolf incident was able to end once I took the initiative. Since they were all burned without a trace, there is no way to find any evidence.If there is a problem, it must have been an eyewitness at the scene.\u2018Aidan.\u2019A first-year student who stopped me from killing a werewolf.With brown hair that doesn\u2019t stand out that much, he has a pleasing impression but perhaps the greatest thing about him is his personality. It was a rare act to take a risk to protect a friend, or to take action on his own when he thought he might be in danger.To put it bluntly, he was like the main character of a boy cartoon-style game or novel.In the case of the students taking my class, I remembered them all, and Aidan in my memory was a model student who focused on my class with brighter eyes than anyone else.Unlike other people who learn magic as if they are being chased by something, he is a hard worker who enjoys learning because he purely likes magic. Such a guy witnessed the secret of the werewolf.If this was a game, it would probably be [Act 1]. The title \u2018The Werewolf of Theon\u2019 came to my mind.\u2018Maybe I\u2019m being suspected because I killed that werewolf.\u2019Fortunately, Leo and Tracy Friad, who were also there, didn\u2019t notice but if Aidan tells them, the story will change.How the heck did a freshman get caught up in an incident like this and approached the truth? It wasn\u2019t intentional, but things were twisted and turned like this.I put my hand on my forehead and brushed my bangs back. If things keep going like this should I kill him?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 36": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Academy\u2019s Undercover ProfessorCH 36Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayC36: Elemental Attribute Class (1)Contemplating whether to kill Aidan, I remembered him carefully approaching the werewolf, that stupid act of taking out a crude recovery potion, holding it, and smiling at the cub.Contemplating Aidan\u2019s life or death, I shook my head. If I had to deal with him, I could do it as carefully as possible, but I couldn\u2019t completely rule out the situation in which I was suspected.What happened to this situation where I became a teacher who got caught up in a terrorist attack while riding a train? In the end, it\u2019s normal for something completely unexpected to happen.There is something called the Black Swan Theory. When an event that was completely unpredictable occurs, it is analyzed by fitting the cause through the results, and in fact, it is claimed that there was a precursor to the occurrence of this event and that it could be predicted.It is said that post-mortem analysis is easy, but pre-investigation is difficult without realizing it.\u2018More than anything else, I can\u2019t touch Aidan even more since he got the president\u2019s attention through this incident.\u2019Of course, I was the one who suggested the president to give them a prize. But this was unavoidable. It cannot be denied that Aidan, Leo, and Tracy were present at the scene at the time.And in a situation where the president has not yet cast doubt on me, what would happen if I told her to punish Aidan thoroughly? Rather, secretly suggesting that Aidan be rewarded in order to make a good impression was a much better choice for managing my image.In fact, the president didn\u2019t like the aristocratic-oriented atmosphere of the academy, and was satisfied with the appearance of a commoner boy who played a big role this time.\u2018Besides, Aidan is a commoner, but he also possesses a rare [Unusual] type of magic.\u2019It is said that his master, who was a wandering wizard, taught him when he was young.Anyway, Aidan is a guy who knows how to use such unusual magic, so he has subtly attracted the president\u2019s attention. Touching Aidan is risky and suspicious.\u2018How about using Aidan?\u2019The same goes for the [Unusual] type magic he possesses, but I had a strong feeling that it was going to bring all kinds of events. If it were Aidan, I thought that he might even face the Black Dawn hiding in Theon.\u2018It\u2019s not bad, but I\u2019ll just keep the possibility open.\u2019I don\u2019t even know what Aidan thinks of me after that night, and no matter how much he learns unusual magic, he\u2019s still only a student.It would be better to watch him the next few days, or weeks. It will not be too late to make a judgment at that time.\u2018For now, let\u2019s focus on recovery.\u2019The voice had completely disappeared, but I still ached from the after-effects. I\u2019m worried about tomorrow\u2019s class, but based on my current situation, I\u2019m sure I will be completely restored by tomorrow morning.I thought so and closed my eyes.* * *Trina Ryanhowl frowned at the burnt marks. The site that used to be an abandoned factory was now left with nothing but black traces of what used to be a factory.\u201cCaptain. What can we check from this condition?\u201d\u201cNo matter how you look at it, it looks like everything is burned out.\u201dAs the two lieutenants said, the factory was completely burned down, leaving no clues or anything about the incident.Trina tapped the ashes with the tip of her boots.\u201cIt\u2019s strange. A fire breaks out in an abandoned factory where no one has come and everything in this area is burned down.\u201d\u201cDid they burn everything fearing that they might be discovered?\u201dAt the time she heard the news of the fire, she vaguely assumed it was something like this but when she saw the ruins where there was actually nothing left, she felt a bitter taste.Terry patted her chin to organize her thoughts.\u2018The death of Bellbot Rickson, the unidentified thief, the werewolf and the abandoned factory fire all occurred on the same day.\u2019All the pieces of the puzzle are in place, and a picture is drawn to some extent. However, there was a big hole in the center of the puzzle, which is the most important part. The culprit behind the incidents was unknown.\u201cLloyd, have there been any other incidents besides these?\u201dAt Trina\u2019s question, Lloyd pushed her rimless glasses over his face to the tip of his finger.Lloyd, whose hair was also neatly tucked into a pomade, had an appearance that was closer to a scholar rather than a knight. In fact, his main tasks were related to obtaining and organizing information and identifying incidents.\u201cThere was nothing special, but.\u201d\u201cBut\u201d\u201cI heard the news that a werewolf also appeared in Theon Academy.\u201d\u201cTheon Academy?\u201dNot even Trina knew about Theon.The Empire\u2019s best educational institution that trains wizards established with the full support of several kingdoms had a history and tradition that spanned hundreds of years.In particular, it was famous not only for the aristocrats and wealthy people, but also for the commoners and the lower classes, where anyone with ability was given equal opportunity.It is within the Empire, but a place that is freer from the influence of the Empire than anyone else.A werewolf appeared in such a place?\u201cYes. It appears that the Werewolf of Leathervelk entered through the sewer pipe.\u201d\u201cIt must have been a big deal for the students.\u201d\u201cFortunately, there were no fatalities. There were a couple of wounded, but none of them were life-threatening.\u201d\u201cWhat happened to the werewolf hiding in Theon?\u201d\u201cA teacher killed it.\u201d\u201cAs expected of Theon\u2019s teachers. What about the werewolf body?\u201d\u201cHe burned it.\u201d\u201cBurned?\u201dFor a moment, she thought that the teacher was related to the factory fire, but this must be an overestimation. In the first place, fire the elemental magic that can effectively defeat monsters like Cryptids.\u201cHmm\u2026.Theon\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cWould you like to go to Theon? We might get some clues that we might not be aware of.\u201dAt Lloyd\u2019s question, Trina shook her head.\u201cNot yet. For now, let\u2019s focus on gathering clues in this area.\u201dHowever, it seemed necessary to keep in mind that there might be something in Theon.\u201cSomeday I will find out.\u201dBecause she had to uproot the beings who are secretly hiding in the Empire and restore national stability. That was the mission and significance of the Nightcrawler Knights.* * *The classroom where Rudger\u2019s manifestation system magic is taught.The students who had gathered there kept talking among themselves about what had happened. Naturally, the topic of conversation was werewolves and Rudger.\u201cDid Mr. Rudger really hunt werewolves?\u201d\u201cHe said he was a soldier. I heard that he also had a history of subjugating Cryptids, which is probably true.\u201d\u201cWow. From the first day, I thought he was no joke, but it was true.\u201dIn addition, Rudger stopped the fight between Rene, a commoner, and Dunema Rommli, a nobleman. Even before the start of his first day of classes, the evaluation of Rudger among students was not so good.As Rudger\u2019s past activities were revealed, the evaluation improved, but there were still negative views. But the groundbreaking magic source code that he showed in his first class caused the students\u2019 evaluation of Rudger to change.The fact that Rudger was a new teacher and a fallen aristocrat alone was not only disappointing to the students who did not attend his classes, but there were also some students who tried to change their lecture hours and enter Rudger\u2019s class.It is said that even 4th graders, who will be busy preparing for graduation, applied for lectures late and were rejected. Even teachers were interested in Rudger\u2019s source code magic, and rumors have spread that the news has also reached the tower.Now, among the first and second graders, the name Rudger Chelici was known by everyone.\u2018Mr. Rudger\u2019s name is often mentioned.\u2019Erendir, who was quietly listening to the conversation about Rudger, recalled the appearance of Rudger that day. The man who spoke coldly about her princess identity. No, that attitude, which seemed to be oddly hostile to her, was definitely upsetting. No matter how wrong she is, what could she say?\u2018Besides, he was kind to junior Rene.\u2019At that time, the situation was so urgent that it passed, but now that she thought about it, something was wrong. There are people in the world who ignore a princess and take care of the commoners. Isn\u2019t it usually the other way around?Of course, that thought came to her as she watched the scene where Rudger was fighting a werewolf under the moonlit night. Just then, the back door of the classroom opened and a female student entered. Ash gray short hair with relatively long side hair, it was Rene.She shuddered at the burdensome gazes of some students who turned to her. Because of an incident with Dunema at the beginning of the school year, the aristocratic students hated Rene. As a result, she could not even make friends and was always alone.Seeing the almost full seats in the classroom, Rene was forced to go to the only empty seat in the end, the most burdensome place next to princess Erendir.\u201cHi junior Rene, how have you been since that day?\u201d\u201cErendira-senpai.\u201dEven aristocrats who wanted to make a connection with the princess and avoided the burden, and Rene, a commoner, was given the seat. As Erendir greeted her warmly, the gaze of some students had no choice but to become mysterious.What is that commoner doing now? When did she become so close with the princes?Rene had a hard time raising her head as the gazes on her increased.\u2018Why are you only doing this to me?\u2019It was her honest feelings that she didn\u2019t want to get involved with anything. What happened at the beginning of the semester was just an accident.After she did something wrong, Dunema was punished accordingly, so she didn\u2019t want to say anything more.Suddenly the front door of the classroom opened and all the students shut their mouths.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dThey all stood with their backs straight and stared at Rudger entering through the open door.The man was the same as they had seen the first day. His movements were restrained, and his steps silent. The only difference was his clothes. He wore a black frock coat and a silk hat over a gray suit on the first day, but this time he had a long white coat with a black suit on the inside.He wore a red tie and a long wine-colored scarf around his neck and didn\u2019t wear a hat. His sharp gaze and sculptural appearance were clearly revealed.The students were drawn to the sight and some of the girls stared blankly at Rudger with hazy eyes.\u201cClass begins.\u201dAt the same time as his words, the pile of papers that Rudger had brought scattered in the air. A total of 80 sheets of paper were blown away by the wind and landed naturally on the students\u2019 desks. It was a handout printed on a copy machine with the content to be taught today.\u201cToday, I will explain the basics and principle of <elemental attribute>, which is one of the specialties of the manifestation system.\u201d<Elemental attribute >, one of the four specializations of the manifestation system. It is the most important field for wizards, and it was also the most popular specialization that most people think of when they hear the word \u2018magic\u2019.Even though magic has developed in various directions, children still think of magic that evokes fire, water, ice and wind but that was just the basics that most freshmen who have just entered Theon have learned.When it comes to re-learning it, the students who were expecting a unique class were somewhat disappointed.\u201cBut this alone will not satisfy your passion and greed for learning. So today I am going to teach you a new method.\u201d\u201cNew method?\u201dWhen the students were all puzzled, some who had already taken the advanced course noticed what Rudger was trying to do.\u201cA way to increase the power of the elements that you can use from a minimum of 20% to a maximum of 80%.\u201d\u201cIs there such a thing?\u201d\u201cHow is it?\u201dRudger asked, scanning the classroom.\u201cAre you interested now?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 37": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Academy\u2019s Undercover ProfessorCH 37Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaySome students had bewildered faces.Rudger pointed to one of the students sitting in the front row.\u201cThe student in the front row. Anthony was it?\u201d\u201cYes teacher!\u201d\u201cWhich elemental attribute can you use?\u201d\u201cThat, that\u2026\u2026Water, ice and plants.\u201d\u201cWhich of them are you most confident about?\u201d\u201cThe ice element.\u201d\u201cThen, can you show the ice element right here?\u201dTo Rudger\u2019s words, Anthony answered yes and a magical sphere appeared in his right hand. The basic mana emission began, and the properties of mana were included in earnest.It was a pure white sphere. To be precise, it was close to a ball of snow that had been pressed tightly.\u201cIt\u2019s normal.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cYou sound like a no-brainer.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAnthony\u2019s face darkened at Rudger\u2019s words.\u201cLook at what I do.\u201dIn Rudger\u2019s right hand a magical sphere appeared. It was a mass of ice properties like the one made by Anthony, but something was different. No, it was still changing.\u201cDo you feel it?\u201dThe student did not respond to Rudger\u2019s words. He was just staring at the chunk of ice he had created as if possessed. The sphere Rudger created was much colder and sharper than his, and it felt like the perennial snow sleeping deep underground in the North Continent.Rudger compressed the sphere even more and turned it into ice crystals. The blue crystals blew a cold chill around, creating the illusion that the classroom itself was covered with ice.\u201cCan you see the difference?\u201dThe students still stared blankly at the place where the element was. Although it was the same ice element, Rudger\u2019s and Anthony\u2019s manifestations were very different.Did he use more magic power? No, the efficiency itself was different. And that\u2019s what Rudger was trying to teach them today.\u201cIs there really something different?\u201d\u201cHow did teacher do it?\u201dThe atmosphere in the classroom gradually heated up. There is no magician who would refuse anything that would make his magic skills better.\u201cOf today\u2019s two hours of class, 30 minutes will be about basic theories, and in rest you will learn how to increase the manifestation efficiency of your elements.\u201dThe students all focused on Rudger\u2019s words, with their eyes shining brightly.\u201cBefore we get into the principle of manifestation, let\u2019s get into the basics of <elemental attribute >.\u201dAll students glanced at what was written on the handout.\u201cElemental attributes are a specialization with a deep history and genealogy that even appeared in the manifestation system right after the release of magic.\u201dMagic can only be used with magical powers and primordial magic, a very primitive form of magic, is based on the manifestation of this magical power.That was the first specialization of the manifestation system, named <Magic release>.From the release of such magical power the <Elemental Attributes>, which contains the elements of nature in the magic, was developed.\u201cIt has now been established as a part of the manifestation system, but in the early primitive forms of magic, elemental attributes were called the basis of all magic.\u201dRudger said so and floated 4 magical spheres in the air.\u201cCurrently, it has been established to manifest the power of an element that matches one\u2019s own magical power through natural science, but in the early days of manifesting elemental attributes, we focused on the relationship between nature and humans.\u201dEach of the magical spheres began to take on one attribute.Fire, water, earth, and wind.\u201cThese are the first four attributes. Compared to now, when the number of attributes has increased to 10 or more, the number is very small. However, we cannot see this simply as an attribute. These four elements are not just pure elements, because they contain the symbolism people thought of in those days.\u201dEarth is hard and strong.Fire is powerful and destructive.Water is soft and acclimatized.Wind is freedom.The students listened to Rudger as if possessed. A theoretical teaching on origins should be boring but no one thought so.\u2018I already know this.\u2019Flora was dissatisfied with the content.After all, she knew the origins of elemental attributes, having to listen to what she already knew were terribly tedious and laborious. But even knowing this, she was humiliated by the way she was subtly drowning in Rudger\u2019s voice.\u201cSince then, elemental attributes have been developed and analyzed from a rational point of view rather than a natural symbol. The number of elements that used to be four has increased to ten.\u201d\u2018He keeps saying words I already knew.\u2019\u201cA conflict has arisen between the mystic school, which values tradition, and the natural science school, which seeks to further develop modern science by applying it.\u201d\u2018It\u2019s just that you have a pretty face and a good voice.\u2019\u201cIn the end, we have no choice but to adapt to the changes in the world. Not the teachings of the Order, but where to use the magic of nature.\u201d\u2018\u2026\u2026Still, it\u2019s worth listening to.\u2019Rudger, who removed the magic that was floating in the air, glanced around the classroom and asked a question.\u201cDoes any student know for what reason elemental magic has developed so dramatically? I\u2019ll give 5 points to the person who answers correctly. An example is the flame element.\u201dThe students immediately raised their hands.Rudger named them one by one.\u201cThere.\u201d\u201cIt is to light the light and drive out the darkness.\u201d\u201cWrong. Next.\u201d\u201cIt is to clear the forest by burning it.\u201d\u201cToo formal. Next.\u201d\u201cUh, um. Is it to get rid of the primal human fear of darkness?\u201d\u201cYou would be more suited to writing poetry.\u201dLaughter erupted among the students.Flora Lumos raised her hand proudly.\u201cYes. Flora Lumos.\u201d\u201cTo burn something to death.\u201dSilence lingered in the classroom because Flora\u2019s words were so direct and unconventional.\u201cCan you tell me exactly what it is?\u201d\u201cOf course it\u2019s a person.\u201dThe students rolled their eyes in a frozen state. Everyone in this room now had the same thoughts. Rudger is going to rebuke Flora hard but Rudger nodded his head.\u201cThat\u2019s right. Flora Lumos, you receive 5 points.\u201dThe eyes of the students rested on Flora and then turned to Rudger again.\u201cFor what did elemental magic develop? The answer is slaughter.\u201dAfter civilization was established and took shape, magic continued to develop. The hierarchy was divided, and the higher the magic hierarchy, the stronger the power and the higher the lethality.\u201cThe first target was a monster. However, even after the monsters were driven out to the continent of shadows, magic grew stronger. Why? Because of the cryptids. But there are very few cryptids so for whom was magic made stronger and sharper?\u201dMagic was developed to kill humans.War, colonial rule and violence were the driving force that further strengthened and developed magic. In the current era of peace those words were nothing short of taboo for the students learning magic.To compare magic history and tradition to something like murder meant that Rudger was just telling everyone here right now that they were pre-murderers but this was undeniably true. It was also a reality that wizards who value tradition deny.\u201cFire to burn, water to drown, wind to cut, electricity to support. Magic that developed along with human history grew with the driving force of war and slaughter. It is a truth that can never be denied. Yes. After all, the elemental attribute we learn is the Tower of Babel built on top of countless lives and corpses.\u201dRudger took a breath and continued.\u201cYou who learn it are the executioners of the slaughter.\u201d\u201cGulp.\u201dThe classroom was enveloped in silence to the extent that the sound of someone swallowing saliva echoed through the classroom. The subject Rudger was talking about was sensitive to all wizards, not just students learning magic.\u201cBut we can change.\u201dRudger\u2019s voice gently wrapped around the entire classroom.\u201cThere is no guarantee that this has been the case in the past and that this will be the case in the future. Now that the world has changed, fire is not only used to burn. Look at the back of the handout I gave you.\u201dCome to think of it, there was a handout handed out right away as soon as he entered the classroom but they were so focused on Rudger\u2019s teaching that they forgot.The students hurriedly turned over the handout and looked at the contents of the back page. There were crude pictures of various structures printed in ink. However, there was no difficulty in recognizing the picture itself.\u201cFire doesn\u2019t just burn, it provides energy with its burning power. In the cold, fire is a symbol of survival, not destruction.\u201dThe flowing water turns the water wheel, and the river that collects the water becomes a passage for countless ships.The wind drives the windmills to provide wind power, and the electricity itself replenishes energy and emits light.Water and ice wash away the heat in the blazing desert.\u201cAs we learn, the meaning of an element changes depending on how we behave in the future.\u201dRudger\u2019s voice echoed through the classroom.To make something, not to destroy it. Not to erase the world, but to lead it in a better direction.\u201cThat is the basic mindset you need to learn before learning the elemental attributes.\u201dNo one dared to open their mouths. It felt like a huge wave came crashing down and engulfed their body. However, what they felt was not unpleasantness, but rather a refreshing feeling as if something covered in their heads had been removed.Even Flora Lumos, with her mouth wide open, stared intently at Rudger.Rudger showed them a new world.\u201cStrive for a better world. The teachings of my elemental attribute are a lesson for it.\u201dRudger grinned at the students and came down from the pulpit.\u201cNow, let\u2019s start implementing elements in earnest.\u201dThe students gathered in the classroom started learning the elements in earnest. What element they are specialized in is to be learned fundamentally from the time they first learn magic.The children, who had been taught magic before entering Theon, used their magical powers without difficulty and covered them with their own elements.Rudger walked slowly through the classroom, pointing at the elemental spheres the students had made one by one.\u201cJoseph, concentrate the flow of magic a little more. The element itself is fine, but the release of magic power is inexperienced. Are you really a Theon sophomore? Don\u2019t be distracted.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cIrena Caroman, did you make a plant attribute now? The plant attribute should embrace the freshness of nature but yours is like seeing rotting leaves on the ground in late autumn. Keep your mind straight and make a strong image in your mind of a sprout that has just broken through the ground.\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026\u2026\u201dRudger never spoke kindly. Every time he threw a word, the faces of the students fell horribly but what was even more unfortunate was that Rudger\u2019s words were not wrong at all. Beyond that, his advice was far too accurate.It may sound harsh, but Rudger sees the weaknesses of his students, and at the same time provides a way for them to get better. His words seem to hurt their pride but when they meditate on them the students realize that Rudger is helping them. But even so, Rudger\u2019s Spartan teaching style is scary to young students.Every time Rudger took a step towards a student, that student was not able to properly manifest his attribute elements because they were concerned about Rudger.\u201cWhat are you doing now? Does magic look like a joke? If you can\u2019t stay focused, it\u2019s not even worth taking my class.\u201d\u201cSorry!\u201d\u201cBefore you speak, pay more attention to your magic. Close your ears and look only in front of you.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dEvery time Rudger passed by, the students\u2019 voices spread like ripples, forming harmony. Aidan, a commoner boy attending Rudger\u2019s class, broke into a cold sweat as he saw the teacher getting closer and closer.This was because Aidan had not yet been able to properly manifest his elemental attribute.Rudger stopped in front of Aidan. His sharp gaze turned to him, who was unable to do anything.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I asked him to stop at that time, but is he expressing his dissatisfaction subtly now?\u2018Looking at his reaction, it doesn\u2019t seem like that\u2019s the case.\u2019He doesn\u2019t know what to do. There\u2019s no way he\u2019s acting. In other words, Aidan doesn\u2019t really know how to manifest his elemental attribute, which can be said to be the basis of elemental magic.I can\u2019t believe it. The owner of a rare [unusual] type of magic can\u2019t do such a basic thing?\u2018How should I do this?\u2019I thought he was a promising player, but seeing that he is blocked in this part, it seems that he is not. Was it because of the special type of magic that he was allowed to enter Theon in the first place?\u2018Ignoring him like this would be the way to go.\u2019There is no need to take care of a guy who can\u2019t even follow the basic lessons. The more I do that, the more I eat up the precious time of the other students.Wasn\u2019t that something I said when I had the 1st and 2nd graders listen together in class in the first place? I have no intention of being considerate of a guy who can\u2019t keep up.It may be nice for me that Aidan, who may know my secrets, will fall behind in class on his own. Yes, I don\u2019t need to do anything. The world is, by nature, a cold place.* * *\u201cAidan. What are you doing?\u201dAidan closed his eyes tightly saying that it was finally coming.\u201cI, that\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t even manifest the elements. Are you going to rebel against me now?\u201dAll eyes of the students turned to Aidan and Rudger.Rudger frowned and turned to the students.\u201cHave the students who are paying attention to this area already perfected their element manifestation? I\u2019ll have to check it myself.\u201dThe students immediately turned their heads and began to focus on their elements again.Aidan was sweating profusely and didn\u2019t know what to do.Rudger asked, leaning back.\u201cAidan.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Yeah.\u201d\u201cHave you not been able to properly express the elements yet?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Yes. I\u2019m ashamed.\u201dAidan wanted to hide in a mouse hole. All the other students who came in were following the course content brilliantly, but he was lagging behind.Aidan\u2019s entry into Theon was also due to the fact that a kind of \u2018special exception\u2019 was applied, and the basic magic that other people could do basically was still lacking.\u201cWhat attribute elements can you use? Do you know that?\u201d\u201cFire, water and wind.\u201dI thought he would specialize in more elements just because he dealt with a special type of magic, but he wasn\u2019t. It is common knowledge that the more talented a person is, the more elements he can handle.\u201cThen I\u2019ll start with fire.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cI am going to teach you because I can\u2019t just let students fall behind from the first class.\u201d\u201cBut I\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI absolutely loathe having such a guy in my class. Disagreements are not accepted. Concentrate.\u201d\u201cAh yes!\u201d\u201cGather your magic. A basic manifestation should be possible, right?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dAidan nodded his head and created a sphere with magic. It was a basic manifestation that anyone could do if they learned a little magic, which could not be called first-level magic.\u201cThink of turning that magic power into an attribute. As I just said, it\u2019s a flame.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201dAidan looked intently at his magic sphere.Tracy and Leo silently gave Aidan their supportive gaze.However, no matter how focused Aidan was, it was difficult to properly manifest the fire attribute. At the moment when he wondered if this was the case, Rudger, who had been watching silently, opened his mouth.\u201cDon\u2019t overthink it and take it easy. No matter how hard you try to think of fire in your head, it is difficult at first. So don\u2019t just think with your head, feel with your senses.\u201d\u201cFeel\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cUse your senses. Picture the image of a blazing fire. Close your eyes and focus.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dAidan concentrated on Rudger\u2019s advice, and an image of fire came to his mind, however it was not easy.\u201cConcentrate. Relieve the moment when fire was the most intense in your memory.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dWhen he said that, he felt like he was holding on to something. Concentrating his mind, Aidan was able to slowly recall the most impressive moment from his memory.\u2014The feeling of burning firewood in a country house.His family watched the fire. At that time, the scarlet fire fluttered to and fro inside the hearth.Rudger\u2019s voice rang in his ears.\u201cNow think of the sound of fire.\u201dInstead of answering, Aidan followed Rudger\u2019s instructions.The sound of fire rising in the wind and the sound of burning firewood at the same time. The puzzles were put together one by one in Aidan\u2019s head.Rudger\u2019s voice was heard.\u201cNext is the sense of smell.\u201dAidan traveled to the depths of his unconscious. The pungent odor from burning firewood and the subtle scent of charcoal. Aidan\u2019s family used to cook stew over such a fire.\u201cYou have no sense of taste, so think of the sense of touch. It\u2019s about reliving the sensations you felt with your skin when you faced the fire.\u201dFollowing Rudger\u2019s guidance, Aidan created a picture-perfect memory of his past. The senses that were put together one by one vividly recalled the memories of the past.He recalled a memory from 8 years ago. One day during the cold winter a blizzard blew through the dark blue windows outside. Wrapped in thick clothes to avoid the cold, he put firewood into the stove to keep the burning fire from going out.His two sisters clung to him and whined that it\u2019s cold so the whole family sat down in front of the fireplace and ate together. His sisters chattered, his mother nagged, and his father smiled softly at them.He couldn\u2019t even eat fancy food, and a cold wind blew through the cracks in his clothes that weren\u2019t tucked properly. Clearly, the memory of that time is as vivid as it had just happened a moment ago.The fire was not hot and wasn\u2019t scary either. The flame he felt then was warm. He remembered being able to spend the cold winter comfortably.\u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d\u201cAh.\u201dAidan opened his eyes at the sound of Rudger\u2019s voice and saw a small sphere of flames burning in front of his eyes.\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dAidan widened his eyes as if in disbelief. It seemed to be like the flame that existed in his memory. It was warm rather than hot, soft rather than destructive.\u201cNot bad.\u201dAidan was stunned at Rudger\u2019s compliment. Rudger, who had only cruelly criticized the students who were called geniuses, praised him. He wondered if he could call that a compliment, but Rudger\u2019s words were positive.Most of the other students, who had pricked their ears, pretending not to pay attention, were astonished by what he said.\u201cThe flame is more than a normal element, it can be called your own flame. Rather than copying what others have taught and blindly manifesting that, you are expressing the fire element that you felt. That is your magic.\u201d\u201cIs this my magic?\u201dAidan stared at the sphere of flame he had created, like a man half lost in spirit but he lost his concentration and fire disappeared like a mirage.\u201cAidan.\u201d\u201cYes, teacher.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t forget that feeling.\u201dRudger left those words and moved to find the next student.Aidan still felt like he was dreaming. Leo and Tracy, who were watching anxiously next to him, tapped Aidan\u2019s arm.\u201cAidan, you are awesome!\u201d\u201cHow did you do that?\u201d\u201cUh, huh?\u201dRudger\u2019s praise for Aidan fueled the enthusiasm of the students who had not yet been evaluated. He glanced at those students and opened his mouth.\u201cAs you may have noticed, this is the method I was trying to tell you at the start of the lecture.\u201dAll the students pricked up their ears.\u201cThe application of the senses through experience.\u201dThe students waited for the next explanation at the words application of the senses.\u201cElemental attributes should be based on a basic understanding of the element. Even a three-year-old knows that fire is simply hot and ice is simply cold. If you are a true wizard, you have to put something special in it.\u201d\u201cSomething special?\u201d\u201cThink of the element you wish to manifest, not as a vague memory, but as an intense moment you actually encountered. Use not only sight, but the five senses to feel the elements.\u201dAfter following his advice, the students responded with joy from all over.\u201cWow!\u201d\u201cMuch better than before!\u201dThe students, who felt the joy of learning magic, focused more on not forgetting this lesson.Rudger\u2019s words were not false. By comparing their memories and experiences, they recalled the elements more meticulously and understood them, much more intense elements were manifested than before.Even the feeling of the element itself changed according to their experience and inclination.At that moment, a strong shout erupted from one side.\u201cOMG. Crazy. What is that?\u201d\u201cNested elements? Is she already using that?\u201dFlora Lumos was at the center of the place where the astonished gaze turned. She created an element with a confident expression. To be precise, it was a combination of two elements into one.Fire and ice.The shape of the blazing fire had changed to light blue ice but it was moving little by little, like a ripple. It was the so-called frozen flame.\u2018Huh. This is nothing.\u2019At first, Flora was planning to create only one attribute element in moderation. It was simply because she thought it would be enough to keep her from getting criticized by Rudger.She had already learned how to manifest elements through her five senses, and her unique magic Synesthesia made it possible to manifest the elements with a much higher degree of perfection than others.But when Rudger carefully taught a first-year kid, and even praised him at the end. Something hot jumped up in Flora\u2019s heart and her pride did not tolerate this situation.\u2018You\u2019ll praise me too.\u2019It is not enough to simply implement one element perfectly. She was Flora Lumos and even within Theon, she has never given up the title of genius.Wouldn\u2019t it be damaging to her self-esteem if her magic was only a single element? So she made two elements, fire and ice, which can be said to be opposites.Fire and ice can coexist if the two magic techniques are coordinated so that they do not infringe on each other and are weaved together. Their characteristics are merged and transformed into a new form.The nesting of elements that can be said to be an advanced level of <elemental attributes>.Flora Lumos could easily combine two elements but she suddenly got greedy. She thought that it was because she was in a strangely good condition and was in a high state of mind. Maybe if she were now, she\u2019d be able to achieve triple element nesting that she had never done before.\u2018Frozen fire. If I put the wind element\u2019s magic in it and make it swirl.\u2019Flora started making another new magic. Three overlaps of elements by adding one element to the existing two elements overlap. She never managed to do it before but she felt that could succeed now.When she imagined how Rudger\u2019s face would look after she succeeded she felt like laughing but it didn\u2019t take long for Flora\u2019s complexion to change.\u2018Uh, huh?\u2019Flora was the first to \u201csee\u201d with her eyes. The moment the three colors were about to blend beautifully, they suddenly lost their shape and started to collide with each other. That meant that the magic flowed in a direction different from her intentions and failed.\u2018No!\u2019In the end, greed turned to anger.The three attributes collided with each other, generating intense energy. Flora clenched her teeth and tried to restrain them, but it wasn\u2019t as easy as she thought.The magic that had already crossed the threshold was out of her control. As the three elements merged into one, they began to emit increasingly intense light.\u201cUh, huh?\u201dThe intense magic felt in the center of the classroom also made the students realize that something was strange.\u201cFlora! Stop it!\u201dHer best friend Cheryl, who was sitting next to her, shouted, but Flora couldn\u2019t answer. Biting her lips tightly, she could only desperately suppress the magic that was about to run wild. However, she began to lose control more and more.\u2018I have to stop it somehow!\u2019If this continues it will explode. In that case, with a determination not to inflict any damage on the surroundings, Flora surrounded herself with a magical barrier. Even if the magic goes wild like this, the magic storm will not spread outside.Flora tightly closed his eyes but at that moment she felt a warm hand.\u201cUh?\u201dFlora opened her eyes and Rudger was standing in front of her. He faced her, his hands gently clasping the back of her hand, grabbing her magic.\u2018How?\u2019Rudger, who came in after breaking the barrier of magic so easily, added his own magic and said,\u201cConcentrate, Flora Lumos.\u201d\u201cSir?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t give up, control your magic.\u201dFlora stared blankly into Rudger\u2019s eyes. There was no sign of fear in Rudger\u2019s eyes, even in front of the magical power that might explode at any time.\u201cI will help you.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The overlapping elements that were exploding in all directions gathered in a circle and gradually began to stabilize.When Flora saw the scene, she thought she was going to stop breathing. At that moment, Rudger\u2019s voice awakened her mind.\u201cIt\u2019s not over yet. Don\u2019t lose your concentration.\u201dFlora regained her consciousness and concentrated on manipulating her magic.\u201cIf you stop here, your magic will vanish without achieving anything. Can you accept that?\u201dAt those words, Flora clenched her teeth.The magic that was about to go astray gradually returned to stability, but if it stopped here, it wouldn\u2019t work either.\u2018Yes. I can\u2019t stop now\u2026\u2026!\u2019She couldn\u2019t let the magic she was trying to unleash disappear like this. Flora responded by squeezing out all of her remaining magical power. She had to perfect this spell now, even in order to live up to the expectations of Rudger who helped her.The three elements gathered in a circle gradually decreased in size, and eventually began to take on the form of something. Flora\u2019s eyes widened at the sweet scent that brushed the tip of her nose.\u2018Color.\u2019The color that had been scattered and ran wildly returned to its original position.\u2018No.\u2019Beyond that, it began to harmonize beautifully.\u2018Ah.\u2019With trembling lips, she stared at the magic that was embodied in front of her.The reason she challenged the overlap of 3 elements was because she wanted to get praised by Rudger. For Flora, innately gifted with her talent for magic, even the difficult, high-hierarchical magic was something she could eventually achieve someday. For this reason, Flora\u2019s magic was considered so easy and natural.She was not happy with her success but also did not dwell on failure. Because it was something she could reach naturally one day.She thought that even if she succeeded in what she had failed so far, she wouldn\u2019t be happy.\u201cYou succeeded.\u201dAt Rudger\u2019s words, Flora\u2019s voice did not come out.It felt like something was pounding in her chest. Her gaze was nailed to the finished element. A white wind whirls fiercely in orbits around a frozen flame like a sharp awl.She managed to combine 3 elements into one. Flora felt the illusion that her soul was taken from her beyond her gaze at the dazzling beauty that it gave off.\u201cPretty.\u201dSheryl, who was watching the scene nervously next to her, said so.Yes, the magic she wanted to create was as beautiful as a work of art. Flora\u2019s reaction was far more passionate than that of the other students.What excited her more than her vision and olfactory pleasure was a feeling of invigorating her spirit that bubbled up deep in her chest.She completed a magic that she has never done before and felt a sense of accomplishment that she had overcome a wall. Although she did not achieve this on her own, she could not deny this joy.The magic that had exhausted all its strength eventually turned into a splendid powder of light and disappeared. As he watched the scene as if possessed, Rudger opened his mouth.\u201cFlora Lumos.\u201d\u201cYeah. Mr. Rudger.\u201dFlora appeared calm but that was only on the outside.If Rudger had spoken words of praise here to her, she might have shed her tears from so much joy.\u201cYou have done something stupid,\u201d he said.\u201cYeah.\u2026\u2026Yeah?\u201dBut at the chilly words that came out of Rudger\u2019s mouth she realized what she had done. She almost endangered the entire student body in the classroom for her own greed.When she faced the reality she had forgotten about her joy of having succeeded in magic, Flora had no choice but to bow her head in gloom.\u201cAnyone can try new magic and fail but in the end, you have to bear the price of that failure yourself. Not the other students, but you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Sorry.\u201dWhat Rudger said was a hundred times right. She almost put the other classmates at risk. At the end she felt a sense of responsibility and surrounded herself with a magical barrier, but could she have completely stopped the damage with it?If Rudger hadn\u2019t come forward someone may have died.\u201cBut above all else, I rebuke you Flora Lumos, for the immaturity of your magic.\u201d\u201cYeah?\u201d\u201cWhen you first overlapped the elements, you mixed fire and ice, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cFire and ice are opposites to each other so it\u2019s hard to mix them together. Beyond making sure that they do not collide, you need to create a stronger effect by harmonizing them.\u201d\u201cYes, that is correct.\u201dAnd Flora Lumos did it.By mixing opposing powers, she embodied a single magic.\u201c\u2026\u2026How is my magic immature?\u201dThere was a mix of sadness in her voice. If he was just going to rebuke her, he could point out her overlapping of 3 elements but Rudger pointed out the perfect overlap of fire and ice.Flora thought that Rudger was trying to use her mistake as an excuse to devalue the existing overlapping elements.\u2018No, but still\u2026\u2026\u2019When she was in danger Rudger helped her control her magic or else she would\u2019ve died. There was absolutely no reason for Rudger to simply belittle her after helping her.Just as she was about to be disappointed, Rudger used his magical powers and created spheres of ice and fire.\u201cI will show you why your magic is immature.\u201dRudger merged the two elements he had created into one while adjusting the magic so that the magical powers of both attributes won\u2019t collide.Flora stared intently, not wanting to miss any detail. The whole process was obviously similar to what she tried but the results were not the same.\u201cUh?\u201dBecause the overlapping elements the Rudger created were different from Flora\u2019s.Flora Lumos compared the overlapping elements she had created herself with those created by Rudger. In terms of elements, there is no difference at all; however, the results produced by the two elements were very different.The energy of the overlapping elements was fundamentally different. Flora, who is particularly sensitive to magic, could feel it more clearly than anyone else. The color and smell were different from hers.\u201cFlora Lumos. Do you know what this overlapped element I created is like?\u201dFlora hesitated for a moment, then nodded her head.\u201c\u2026\u2026Yeah.\u201d\u201cThen please explain.\u201d\u201c\u2026 \u2026 The overlapped element you created has different wills of magical power. The spread of the flame and the power to engulf the surroundings, and the chilling of the ice attribute coexist.\u201d\u201cOn the other hand, what about yours?\u201d\u201cYeah?\u201d\u201cI asked you what about yours.\u201dFlora only licked his lips, but couldn\u2019t speak. In the end, Rudger opened his mouth instead.\u201cFlora Lumos the overlapping element you created is a magic that is only beautiful in shape, and has no practicality.\u201dAt those piercing words, Flora trembled.\u201cMagic must be practical. If not, at least there shouldn\u2019t be any magic without meaning. This is the base of all magic.\u201dRudger said to the students.\u201cYou need to use magic in a better way. Magic it\u2019s not about killing, it\u2019s about creating something that will lead the world in the right direction. But Flora How was your magic?\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cFrozen fire it\u2019s in the form of the ice element wrapped around the fire element. Yes, it\u2019s beautiful but that\u2019s all.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dFlora had nothing to say because everything Rudger said was true.\u201cAre you planning on getting a job in a circus with this magic? Or, were you planning on going to the Crystal Palace in the capital and displaying your magic in a beautiful way?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026It\u2019s not like that.\u201d\u201cThen what is the significance of your magic? Is it just a show off to show off that you can overlap elements?\u201dRudger\u2019s point was irrefutable. She didn\u2019t know where it can be used, it\u2019s just beautiful magic. She wanted to brag about being able to overlap elements, nothing more, nothing less.\u201cYou even tried to mix wind with ice and fire but in the end you failed.\u201dFlora bowed her head at the last wedge.Cheryl, who was sitting next to her, looked at her with a worried expression, but she, too, could not offer the consolation she would have liked in this situation.Rudger threw the magic sphere he had created into the air. The overlapped element climbed up close to the high ceiling of the lecture hall and exploded like firecrackers. For a moment, all the students in the classroom had the illusion that they heard the sound of ice \u201cburning.\u201dThe white frost-like cold air spread widely throughout the lecture hall without even touching the ceiling. It fell and melted away before it even reached the students.\u201cFlora Lumos combining 3 attributes was quite interesting. I\u2019ve never seen a wizard with that level of skill at your age.\u201dFlora\u2019s eyes, which had been taken away by Rudger\u2019s magic, turned to Rudger again. The moment she met the face of the man looking at her with regretful eyes she felt guilty, and her heart sank.\u201cBut the direction of your actions is wrong. I\u2019m not discussing your skills. We\u2019re talking about something much more fundamental than that.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t just use your magic to show off; this will lower your value, Flora.\u201dFlora had no choice but to agree with Rudger\u2019s words. He said that the magic she had created was just a gimmick to show off her skills and to win the praise of others. Conversely, what Rudger made was much more practical, even with the same elements as her.\u2018Again, I lost.\u2019She thought she would get recognition this time, but she didn\u2019t. Flora realized how impatient and immature he was.\u2018I\u2019ve never had anything like this before.\u2019Above all, the sincere gaze that Rudger showed her. It did not disappear from her mind. Rather than ridicule or despise, it was an attitude of genuine concern.\u2018Is there anyone who looked at me like this?\u2019There was no one. The gazes on her were always envy and jealousy. Not to mention her family, her brothers and sisters who hate her. Not only her classmates, but even her seniors were jealous of her and the same was true of Theon\u2019s teachers.Even after more years of learning magic, Flora\u2019s talent quickly caught up with them. Whenever this happened, the eyes of the teachers were always enveloped in unbearable flame-like jealousy.Flora knew it, but didn\u2019t show it. Because that\u2019s what her real talent was. There was no need to flinch in the eyes of those who were jealous of her talents.But today for the first time in her life, Flora was taken aback by Rudger\u2019s unfamiliar attitude.\u2018Mr. Rudger.\u2019He saved her, who almost failed her magic and helped her overcome the barrier of three overlapping elemental elements that had not been crossed before.Flora suddenly realizes that she is now dizzy and short of breath. She wanted to overlap 3 elements and consumed too much mana.\u2018I feel like I\u2019m going to die of exhaustion, but is the teacher okay?\u2019Rudger, who suppressed the exploding mana, would have consumed much more mana, but he did not lose a single breath.For the first time she felt the real \u2018wall.\u2019 And that wall was so high and thick that she wasn\u2019t sure if she could ever get over it. Still, she didn\u2019t want to give up.Flora felt good and made a strong promise to herself that next time she would definitely surpass him.\u2018Hmm?\u2019Rudger trembled involuntarily as he chewed the magic recovery pill he had hidden in his mouth.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 40": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Academy\u2019s Undercover ProfessorCH 40Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayC40: Flora Lumos (2)Chapter 3/3 for the week.Ever since I pointed out to Flora, I have been monitoring the condition of several students and giving them advice.\u2018It\u2019s not that difficult to tell.\u2019The manifestation of elemental attributes is the foundation of the basics. Some may think that it is easy and trivial, but there is nothing more important in < Elemental Attributes> than to get the basics right.\u2018Actually, I didn\u2019t even know the foundation would be so important.\u2019Elemental magic used by wizards is slightly different from simple elements that exist in nature. To be precise, the mana floating in the air is close to mimicking the elements with a strange power. Of course, if the world recognizes that \u2018imitation\u2019 as \u2018real\u2019, and is hit by fire magic, it burns.Naturally, things that cannot occur naturally, for example, the warm and cozy flame that Aidan created a while ago, can also be created with magical power. In other words, the element created by magic coexists in two contradictory terms, both fake and real.Elements created by such magic naturally follow the inclination of the wizard. The ice magic used by a cold and sober person and the ice magic used by a hot blooded person produce completely different results.A wizard who has more and more diverse experiences while wandering the world can put more diverse \u2019emotions\u2019 into the magic than a wizard who is confined to a room.After all, magic itself is close to putting human emotions into magic. Just like there are songs that have emotions in them and songs that don\u2019t. However, as the current magic unfolds only through theories and calculations, this method is very old and doesn\u2019t remain in the history books anymore.Perhaps it was written in an old and worn out book in the far corner of the tower\u2019s library. It\u2019s not that everyone doesn\u2019t know, but still, only a small part of it is known compared to the past.\u2018Even though Master originally taught me to maximize elements through the senses.\u2019This method was only taught to me as a disciple, but this insensitive disciple is now disclosing Master\u2019s tips to the public because he wants to live.I\u2019m sorry, Master. However, if I don\u2019t do this, my life will be in jeopardy. Anyway, magic is such a mysterious science.\u2018I remember the first time I learned it.\u2019When I first found out that magic existed in this world, I believed that I would become an archmage that would go down in history. The fact that I was reincarnated in another world was enough to make me hope.Of course, that dream was soon abandoned because I didn\u2019t have a great talent to learn magic. It\u2019s possible up to the basics, but that\u2019s all.It was virtually impossible for me to be a great wizard who will go down in history. So I had no choice but to change the direction of learning magic.Basically, my limit is up to the 3rd rank, and if I overdo it I can use the basic magic of the 4th rank.In terms of my level, I am at the beginning of the 4th rank and this is also my limit. I couldn\u2019t use more magic than that, so I chose to increase the quality of magic that could be used up to the 3rd rank.It was for that reason that the foundation was laid down. Above all, because I had memories of my previous life, I was able to look at magic with a slightly different perspective from others.For them, the scientific knowledge of the early 21st century was grafted into the procedure. Source code was a prime example of that.In addition to that, I received Master\u2019s spartan teachings, so I was able to confidently say that my basics of magic were more solid than anyone else\u2019s and the method I have been adhering to so far has shone in Theon.\u2018At that time, I complained about why I had to do this, but now that I think about it, there is nothing better than this.\u2019Perhaps magic using the five senses is a method not taught even in the Magic Tower. It\u2019s like a secret sauce for a restaurant that\u2019s only told to the important talents that are pushed from within by the schools and I said it in the open.In fact, the students were satisfied because there were noticeable changes or achievements.\u2018Still, I can\u2019t help but be vigilant.\u2019Overlapping elements is not simply merging different elements together. It is necessary to modulate the composition of the magic so that they do not collide with each other, but it is a dangerous thing that could lead to more serious consequences if mishandled.Therefore, when overlapping elements, those that are compatible with each other were often combined. Like water and ice, fire and wind, wind and electricity. However, Flora superimposed elements opposite to each other: fire and ice. However that alone was not enough and she tried to overlap 3 elements.I realized anew that Flora wasn\u2019t called a genius for nothing in this group of people.\u2018Even so, it would have been a failure.\u2019I desperately suppressed it, consumed too much mana and got dizzy. Fortunately, there was a magic potion that I had poured into my mouth beforehand, and I recovered quickly, otherwise I might have staggered in front of the students.That\u2019s why I didn\u2019t feel like I was scolding Flora a bit harshly. In the past, I was so confident in this new magic trick, but I was so broken by Master. At that time, I also did a lot of dangerous things, thinking that I would unleash some great magic.Flora\u2019s shrugged nose after successfully stacking two elements overlapped with my old self while learning magic from Master. That\u2019s why I pushed Flora a little harder. Belatedly, I thought I was a bit harsh but she\u2019s still a girl called genius, so I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll get through this.I decided to turn off Flora and focus on the rest of the students.\u2018Because this is Theon, I only give some simple advice, but everyone made good progress.\u2019There were a few students who stood out in particular. The first one was a brown-skinned schoolgirl with beast ears on her head that embodied an element that looked as if it had pulled up a vein that existed deep underground.\u2018Iona Obeli was it?\u2019I saw her on the first day. In the first place, she was the only benefactor in this classroom. She looked back at me to see if she felt my gaze. I simply nodded her head lightly to express that she embodied her element nicely.Was my behavior strange? She said \u2018ah\u2019 and opened her mouth. I ignored her and looked at her other students.Next was a blue-haired girl with her hair in two braids, wearing large, round glasses that covered half of her face who was manifesting the wood element. Her looks say \u2018I\u2019m good at studying\u2019, and she was a girl supported by the Alchemy School, who had a reputation for herself among the freshmen.\u2018Her name was Clara Harness? She\u2019s pretty good.\u2019In addition the twin sisters from aristocratic families that are quite famous in the Eastern Kingdom, and even newcomers who are supported by the tower. This rookie seems to have quite a rivalry with Flora Lumos.\u2018I heard that only amazingly great students gathered for this year\u2019s freshman year. I also came in at a very odd time.\u2019Can they be called the golden generation? At first glance, it seemed that Selena had heard that there are many such children in this first year and surprisingly, most of them are taking my classes.When I try to teach these good guys one by one, I feel like I\u2019m getting nervous.It was then.As the class was almost over, I found a student who was the only one who couldn\u2019t manifest an element.\u2018That kid.\u2019I was familiar with that striking light gray hair and heavenly beauty.\u201cWhat happened, Rene?\u201d\u201cAh. Mr. Rudger.\u201d\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d\u201cOh, no. That\u2019s\u2026\u2026\u201dRene hesitated to answer.Next to her sat princess Erendir. Have you two been friends since then? When I glanced at Erendir, she shook her head without saying a word.Eventually, Rene sighed and released her own magical energy, floating her sphere. She has the basic knowledge and talent for magic as long as she was enrolled in Theon.She was fine up until there, but the problem was next and I caught exactly what the problem was.\u201cIt seems that the element cannot be manifested. No. To be precise, the element itself does not exist.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Yeah.\u201dRene was a possessor of non-attribute magic that was said to appear very rarely.* * *\u2018Ruined.\u2019Rene was afraid that she was wasting her time for nothing. As she bowed her head, the clock bell rang in the classroom, signaling the end of the class.\u201cToday\u2019s class will end with this. Let\u2019s all review what we have learned today. The homework will be replaced by that. Don\u2019t even think about going overboard. I\u2019ve memorized all the elements you used today, so I\u2019ll check it out in the next class.\u201dOnce again, some students, who were delighted to hear that there were few assignments, hurriedly averted their gaze when they met Rudger\u2019s.\u201cThe guys who don\u2019t practice properly will get a kick out of it. I look forward to that time.\u201dThe students ran out of the classroom. Just as Rene was about to get up from her seat, Rudger called her.\u201cRene.\u201d\u201cYeah? Yeah!\u201d\u201cYou follow me to the office.\u201d\u201cUgh!\u201dRene swallowed her breath involuntarily.The remaining students looked at Rene with pity. In the manifestation class, elemental attributes are the most important specialization after magic release, but non-attributes are not like that.Perhaps he is calling her to advise her to look into other lectures because she cannot participate at the lecture properly. Although this is only the second week, Rudger\u2019s class has already been rumored to be one of the best in the world.In particular, his teaching, which strengthened the foundation of their elemental attributes, was enough to set a wedge in the students\u2019 expectations. Not being able to take such a class in the future was more than just learning in Theon and it\u2019s probably a loss of nearly half of her life.She wouldn\u2019t know if she didn\u2019t participate from the beginning but it was a different matter for her to drop out of a class she had already taken. Of course, most of the students were relieved that the subject was not themselves.Following Rudger\u2019s slow walk down the hallway, were Rene staggering footsteps\u2018Why did he call me? Maybe a personal interview? Is he trying to kick me out of class?\u2019Although she had only seen him three times, including the incident at the training ground the day before, Rene knew enough about who Rudger was.\u2018Ahhh! I\u2019m done.\u2019Rene got depressed for nothing, so she bowed her head. It was very painful that she had to change classes during the semester. She accidentally picked up a jewel on the way, and nothing would be sadder if she had to throw it back on the roadside.\u201cCome in.\u201dArriving at the office, Rudger opened the door with his nameplate on it and went inside. Rene entered Rudger\u2019s office with the spirit of a death row prisoner heading to the gallows.The interior itself was quite stylish and neat. Was it said that the place also resembles the owner? It was a space with an old-fashioned atmosphere like the man was.\u201cSit down.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dAt Rudger\u2019s words, Rene sat down on the sofa, completely frozen. Obviously, the leather of the luxurious sofa was too soft and should be comfortable, but Rene had no choice but to keep her back straight.Rudger sat down at his desk, opened a drawer and pulled out a pile of papers. Seeing that, Rene closed her eyes tightly.\u2018Ahhh! He\u2019s trying to send me to another teacher\u2019s lecture!\u2019Should I get on my knees and beg him to let me go to his class? But what if he would despise me even more?! At that moment when my head was spinning, a thin book was suddenly handed to her.Rene closed her eyes tightly and shouted.\u201cI\u2019ll do anything you tell me to do, so please don\u2019t tell me to stop taking classes! If I can\u2019t attend this class, I\u2019ll be in trouble!\u201dDespite Rene\u2019s desperate appeal, Rudger did not waver.\u201cWhat are you talking about? This is not about that.\u201d\u201cYes Yes? This\u2026\u2026Isn\u2019t this a course change application?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cWasn\u2019t it that I couldn\u2019t attend Mr. Rudger\u2019s class anymore?\u201d\u201cYou sound weird. Come on and get it.\u201dRene politely accepted the book Rudger had handed over with both hands.\u2018What kind of book is this?\u2019With that thought in mind, Rene, who looked at the title of the book, had no choice but to open her eyes wide.[Understanding non-attribute magic]The large letters on the cover of the book caught her attention.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Mr. Rudger? What is this\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cRead.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cIf you read what\u2019s there, you\u2019ll at least see a road you\u2019ve never known before.\u201dRene still didn\u2019t understand how this happened. Why did Rudger bring her to his office and gave her a book?\u201cIs this real?\u201dWith a look of disbelief, Rene stared intently at the title [Understanding Non-Attribute Magic].To her knowledge, her non-attribute magic is extremely rare, and she never used it in public. When she looked closely at the cover, the name of the author was not on the book, and there was not even a seal indicating that it was published.\u2018Isn\u2019t this fake?\u2019It was natural to have such doubts.\u201cIt is natural to doubt it.\u201d\u201cYes? Oh! Oh no! It\u2019s not like that\u2026\u2026!\u201dDid it show on her face? Rene hurriedly touched her cheek and controlled her expression.Fortunately for her, Rudger didn\u2019t seem to have any intention of reprimanding her for that.\u201cIt\u2019s okay to read and judge. It will be more helpful than not knowing anything.\u201d\u201cEven in the tower, there was no information about non-attribute magic\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cIs my source code a magic that existed in the tower?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dIn response to such a wonderful rebuttal, Rene bit her lips tightly. So is this really real?\u201cUh, where did you get something like this\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI was able to obtain it through a connection.\u201dAt that, Rene\u2019s head tilted slightly to her side. What kind of connection could obtain something like this book?Confused Rene asked Rudger.\u201c\u2026\u2026Do you, Mr. Rudger, also know anything about non-attribute magic?\u201dThe Rudger Rene saw was so natural that she had no choice but to think that he had acquired knowledge by actually experiencing non-attribute magic.If he was the Rudger who created the magic source code, she had the expectation that he might know something that others didn\u2019t know.\u201cI met such a person once before.\u201d\u201cOh my gosh. There were other owners of non-attribute magic besides me. So where is he now?\u201d\u201cHe is dead.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026.\u201dRudger\u2019s voice as he said that seemed to be somewhat remorseful, unlike usual. At least, that\u2019s how Rene felt because Rudger\u2019s usual cool and sharp appearance felt like a cotton pad soaked in water at this moment.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a thing of the past.\u201d\u201cThen, is this the last book he left?\u201d\u201cYes. It is the result of his research on his own magical powers during his lifetime. It\u2019s something that doesn\u2019t even exist in the tower.\u201d\u201cWhy\u2026\u2026?\u201dDid he not hand it over to the tower and gave it to Rudger? Rene couldn\u2019t keep up with that.\u201cBecause she wanted it.\u201dAh! She was a woman.Rather, what does he mean by she wanted it? Rene suddenly wondered who the other non-attribute magician was.\u201cBut wouldn\u2019t it be better for the public to hand it over to the tower?\u201d\u201cEven if you hand it over to the tower, a place full of greedy old people will not recognize this book. No, some will admit it and they won\u2019t show it to anyone else, they\u2019ll just keep it among themselves. It is far better to give it to someone who really needs it. So I will keep it until I meet someone who is worthy of this book.\u201dIn response, Rene looked at Rudger again.\u201cIf you read the book and work hard, you will surely find a new way there.\u201d\u201cThen, is there no way to learn magic of other attributes?\u201d\u201cAs far as I know, yes.\u201dAlthough she did not show it, she had a desire to use elemental magic that was as colorful and beautiful as her others.\u201cAre you disappointed?\u201d\u201cTo be honest, yes. Even just one element is good, so I wanted to use it.\u201dOthers deal with two, three or more, and talented people deal with five or more. Suddenly, Rene remembered what Rudger had shown her in class.Come to think of it, how many elements could he use? He showed fire, water, earth and wind, and even used the element ice at first. Then 5?\u201cOne element.\u201dIn fact, Rudger quietly pondered what she had said, not knowing Rene\u2019s heart.\u201cRene, you\u2019re saying it because you don\u2019t understand, but using just one element is never to be taken lightly.\u201d\u201cYeah? Wouldn\u2019t it be nice to use one?\u201d\u201cEveryone, to be exact, wizards have at least two innate elements. So, if you only deal with one element, what do you think will happen?\u201d\u201cUh, um. No talent?\u201d\u201cRudger shook his head.\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cA person who uses only a single element is a person with endless talent that is unmatched in that element.\u201dAs Rudger spoke, Rene opened her mouth in disbelief she could not believe but Rudger\u2019s words were not false.There were only a few of the wizards who could only use one attribute element. But they weren\u2019t weak because they couldn\u2019t handle other elements. Rather, it was more than that.\u201cRene, do you think the elemental magic used by a wizard can affect magic of the same attribute? For example, a sorcerer who deals with fire element suppresses flames.\u201d\u201cUh, isn\u2019t it normal?\u201dRene had that kind of common sense.Being able to use fire elements doesn\u2019t mean you can actually handle fire. It is also a factor that many people misunderstand. If you\u2019re a fire wizard, you can handle fire, so you won\u2019t be affected by fire.If it is a magician who handles metal, he can handle all kinds of metal, so why not show great power in war?That\u2019s wrong. The \u2018expression\u2019 of an element and \u2018handling\u2019 of the element are two completely different concepts.\u201cYes. Usually it is. However, there are wizards who are born with only one element. The magic they use is completely different from the elemental elements that ordinary wizards deal with.\u201dInstead of being unable to manipulate other attribute elements, they can \u2018control\u2019 only the elements they are using.\u201cA single attribute wizard known to the public is given the title \u2018color of the element\u2019 in the magic tower. They are all said to have reached the extreme of their element.\u201d\u201cSo this is what using a single element means\u2026\u2026.\u201dRene felt that her own knowledge was lacking, and her face reddened.How could even a single element be such a great wall? If so, does she really have to live like this for the rest of her life without being able to deal with the elements?Rene was terrified.\u201cRene, what do you think of non-attribute magic?\u201d\u201cUh\u2026\u2026Doesn\u2019t it literally mean that properties don\u2019t exist?\u201dRene answered.\u201cIf I ask a passing child about that, I will get the same answer.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Sorry.\u201d\u201cThe world says it has no attributes, but it is not clear whether there are actually no attributes in non-attribute magic.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cA typical example would be the magic of sound.\u201dRene opened her eyes and tilted her head slightly at the words magic of sound.\u201cDoes the magic of sound exist?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cBut sound is, precisely, a kind of wave that travels through the medium of the atmosphere\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cDo you think it\u2019s the same as the wind attribute?\u201d\u201cI just knew that.\u201d\u201cWrong. Wind and sound are completely different things. Although it is derived from it, sound is more precisely like a wave caused by vibration.\u201d\u201cUh, something else?\u201d\u201cEven if it is not air, the sound wave spreads through water. Then can sound be said to be a property of water?\u201d\u201cThat\u2026\u2026No.\u201dRudger asked again.\u201cThen what is poison?\u201d\u201cPoison\u2026\u2026huh?\u201d\u201cIt is a little more common than the so-called non-attributes, but even so, magicians who deal with poison are rare. Can the poison they deal with really be an element of nature?\u201d\u201cUh, um\u2026\u2026Similar to plants?\u201d\u201cThen what is the poison of animals?\u201d\u201cYeah, there\u2019s that too.\u201dRene explained poison from what she knew.\u201cUgh. In the first place, poison itself is a kind of self-defense created by plants or small animals to survive in an ecosystem, isn\u2019t it? Wouldn\u2019t it be a bit vague to call it an element of nature?\u201d\u201cYes. It is unreasonable to regard poison as a property of nature in today\u2019s era of chemical knowledge along with the development of science. But poison exists as an attribute after all. Magic itself corrupts and melts something. Otherwise, the decomposition property might have to exist.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cBut in the ten elements except for non-attributes, poison and sound cannot be included. Why is that?\u201d\u201cUh, is it because the number of people using it is small?\u201d\u201cIf you look at it that way, people with the magical powers of light and dark attributes also fall under that category. They are also rare cases.\u201d\u201cBut light and darkness exist in nature.\u201d\u201cThen I will ask. Rene, what is nature?\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u2026\u201dWhat is nature? What are the properties and elements implied therein? Nature? Isn\u2019t that the world? But is the world too inclusive? Then what about elements?\u201c\u2026\u2026Come to think of it, I don\u2019t think I can clearly define nature.\u201d\u201cOf course. Because humans cannot define the world in the first place.\u201d\u201cYeah?\u201dAt the words that were unlikely to come out of her teacher mouth, Rene immediately put on a stupid expression.Watching her open mouth, Rudger kept his relaxed expression and continued\u201cMagicians judge themselves to be rational and try to see the world by putting themselves within the framework of such reason.\u201d\u201cYeah, of course it is. In the first place, magic is the expression of mystery through human reason and will\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cFrom that point on, it was a stereotyped idea. Rene have a more free mind. When do you think the metal that exists among the ten properties now appeared?\u201dMetal was not even originally evaluated as an attribute element. Metal comes out of the ground and has been grouped together with soil as an attribute of the earth. However, as science advanced and all kinds of machines and tools made of iron became more and more popular metal was proudly added to the list of the 10 elements.\u201cIt is the same with ice. Ice is just a change that eventually happens when water goes below its freezing point. After all, aren\u2019t water and ice the same thing?\u201dHowever, in the end, the properties of water and ice are separated. The same goes for light and darkness.\u201cRene, you think of the magic that exists now as something perfect, with no room for improvement.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026.\u201dAt Rudger\u2019s words, Rene felt a lightning bolt hitting her head. Her shoulders trembled and her back stood erect. Up until now, she had thought of magic itself as something that could no longer be touched, something at a very distant stage. But is it really? Can magic no longer change?Rudger, noticing that Rene felt something, shook his head.\u201cI finally figured it out. A wizard should control magic, not be controlled by magic.\u201dRudger got up and walked towards the window. Through the transparent glass window, he can see the scenery of the Theon Academy, which will be responsible for the future of this era.\u201cThe world changes and, of course, we who are part of that world change too. It\u2019s the same with magic. Attributes that were initially four have now become ten, but those ten do not constitute everything. There may be unknown attributes that have not yet been revealed. It could be 20, 30 or even more.\u201dRene\u2019s heart was pounding when she heard him speak.\u201cThe same goes for the non-attribute magic you have. It is non-attribute now, but in the future, it may get a name as a new attribute. Not now, but definitely at some point in the future.\u201dAt those words, Rene saw a vague vision of something. She had nothing but a successful future in which she achieved great achievements in one field. It was the look she had dreamed of, and she was so dazzling that she unwittingly clenched her fists.Rudger looked away from the window and turned around.\u201cAh.\u201dRene, who returned to reality, let out an exclamation without knowing it. For some reason, the appearance of Rudger looking at her with his back to the light coming down from the window was very different from his usual coercive appearance.The man who was like a pillar of steel was nowhere to be found. Standing here was a seeker like her.\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid to be different. Don\u2019t be afraid of the unknown. Trust that you can become a pioneer that will go down in history.\u201dRene opened her lips to say something, but no voice came out.As if something heavy was pressing on her chest, even her thoughts were distorted and her words could not be expressed but it didn\u2019t feel tedious and painful. This was the greatest joy she had ever tasted.Rudger\u2019s words ripped open the precarious future she had been holding until now. No words came out but she still wanted to say thank you.\u201cSo, good luck in the future. Be sure to read the book given to you today. This is a personal assignment given only to you.\u201dRudger said so and created a light breeze. The wind gently wrapped around her body, lifted her up from her seat, and led her out of her office.\u201cAh, I\u2026\u2026!\u201dRene turned back and tried to say something to Rudger but the door closed before she could speak.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In her arms, there was a book about non-attribute magic that Rudger had given her. Even though she was lost in her mind, she instinctively felt that she had to treat the book as something precious.Rene, who was walking down the hallway at a rapid pace, stopped her steps when she heard a voice calling her.\u201cRene.\u201d\u201cUh, what?\u201dA soft and pleasant voice called her; it was Erendir, the third princess of the Empire.\u201cWhat is senior doing here?\u201d\u201cI was worried, so I waited for you since you\u2019ve been called by Mr. Rudger.\u201d\u201cYeah? It\u2019s alright hehe\u2026\u201d\u201c???\u201dErendir felt suspicious at Rene\u2019s strange reaction.\u201cRene. Maybe Mr. Rudger did something to you\u2026\u2026\u201dErendir didn\u2019t like Rudger\u2019s actions even before this. Probably because her first impression of him was the worst.During the first orientation, Rudger didn\u2019t even say what he was going to teach in his class. Because of that, there was a lot of talk among the students in <Akashic Records>, so it must have been disappointing.For her, with her values of justice, Rudger behavior was almost unacceptable. Afterwards, the content of his class was quite impressive, and she admired it, but that alone did not immediately dispel the bad perception that was ingrained in her at first.Rather, her attitude towards Rudger worsened during the werewolf incident so when Rudger took Rene to his office it was normal for her to have bad thoughts.\u201cNo way!\u201dRene hurriedly defended Rudger.\u201cMr. Rudger was just giving me advice\u2026\u2026! He never touched me! Mr. Rudger is not a pervert!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dHaving said that, Erendir was rather perplexed.\u201cI, I didn\u2019t mean to say that. Junior Rene\u2019s\u2026\u2026pretty sassy.\u201d\u201cYes?!\u201d\u201cI was just thinking that he would force you to take another class. I remember the relationship between a man and a woman\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cUh, huh? Come on, wait! Not like that!\u201dRene also realized that she had made a big mistake, and her face flushed red from embarrassment.At this sight Erendir started laughing.\u201cAhaha. Okay. It didn\u2019t happen that I was worried about you, so I\u2019ll take it that way.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Senior Erendir!\u201d\u201cSo nothing really happened?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cThen what is that book?\u201d\u201cAh.\u201dErendir found Rene holding a book she had never seen in her arms, and she pointed it out.What she did not know was that Rene was now handling the book with care as if it were something very precious.\u201cThis is from Mr. Rudger.\u201d\u201cMr. Rudger?\u201dRene nodded her head and Erendir opened her eyes a little in disbelief.She didn\u2019t know much about Rudger, but she never thought he would take care of Rene, since she couldn\u2019t keep up with his class due to her nature. She thought he was going to kick her out of class.\u201cYeah. He told me that learning this would help me a lot in following the class.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dErendir couldn\u2019t believe it even more when she saw Rene smiling bashfully. Rudger would do her this favor?Wasn\u2019t that man poignantly and cruelly pointing out the students\u2019 manifestation of attribute elements even in the previous class? Of course, that\u2019s all true, and she understood that it was a way to inspire motivation by touching the other person\u2019s self-esteem but Erendir didn\u2019t like it.\u2018For a moment, he seemed to have been particularly kind to Rene.\u2019When the werewolf attacked she remembered Rudger being rather harsh on her, the princess, and speaking a little softly to Rene. Of course, the memory at that time was slightly distorted due to a bad feeling towards Rudger, but the overall context did not change.If she looked at the fact that he called Rene separately this time and handed her the book.\u2018No way\u2026\u2026\u2019A word came to Erendir\u2019s mind but she didn\u2019t say it, instead Rene asked her.\u201cIs it possible that teacher likes me?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe thought that Erendir had been holding in her mind was actually brought out by Rene herself. Erendir shook her head as she pondered how to explain this.\u201cNo, that\u2019s not it.\u201d\u201cNo?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dEven Rene thought that she had said something that was not true but when she actually said that, she became suspicious.\u2018Mr. Rudger really doesn\u2019t like me?\u2019It sounds like she\u2019s proud of her saying this, but Rene was confident in her looks.\u2018Aren\u2019t I pretty enough?\u2019Rene actually had a beautiful appearance that drew the attention of even a few nobles. Her hair color is also a rare hair color, but the heavenly beauty that goes with it was enough to make Rene\u2019s name rise among the male students of Theon.Suddenly, Rene imagined the scene where she was with Rudger. She thought they would be a good-looking pair, but Rene hurriedly shook her head.\u2018Ah, anyway. Being with someone you don\u2019t know well yet\u2026\u2026\u2019Rene had a strong conservative personality in this direction.Erendir asked her carefully, seeing her blank face and then shook her head.\u201cHave you eaten?\u201d\u201cYeah? Oh no, not yet.\u201d\u201cThen do you want to eat together?\u201d\u201cAre you really okay with that?\u201dRene was so happy at the princess\u2019s suggestion, that she didn\u2019t know where to put herself. It was because she thought that if it was Erendir, there would be people waiting in line to eat with her other than herself.But that was Rene\u2019s mistake, Erendir had rarely traveled with anyone until now. Her status as a princess was great, but she was shunned by other students because it was so high.Occasionally, there were students from noble families who spoke to her, but they only contacted her for political purposes. They didn\u2019t come because they were purely in love with the person named Erendir. All they saw was that she was the third princess, she wasn\u2019t Erendir.\u2018Oh my gosh. It\u2019s the first time a senior has asked me to eat together!\u2019In the eyes of Rene, who was alone all the time because of the incident at the beginning of the semester, it reflected like the great mercy of seniors.Perhaps she thought Rene would refuse since her reply was delayed and Erendir said as she rubbed her blonde hair with her fingers.\u201cIf you don\u2019t like it or feel uncomfortable, there\u2019s nothing you can do about it\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cNo! I want to eat!\u201dAt this moment, Rene and Erendir have become friends that will eat together for the first time.* * *Having sent Rene back, I sat alone in the school office and remembered the meeting with her a while ago. It seems she doesn\u2019t know herself, but I do know what power she has.\u2018Non-attribute magic. It is not so surprising that the attribute itself does not exist.\u2019For me, it is a new form of magic that has not been discovered before because it has no attributes, and there was nothing new about it. Because magic has always been new to me.Since I was living in a world without magic, the magic that exists in this world has always given me a mysterious experience.Ironically, compared to the wizards who are residents of this world, I, who has the memory and knowledge of another world, perceive magic as magic differently.Today\u2019s wizards with a clogged mindset were isolated and stagnant in their lives but after being reborn I must say that my brain limiter has been released.Other wizards reaction when discovering new magic.\u2018-Non-attribute magic? There can be no such thing!\u2019But for me.\u2018-Non-attribute magic? In a world where magic exists, there could be such a thing.\u2019I reached the point of being flexible. Even my point of view was different from that of the wizards in this world, it was very different. Even that strict master stuck out his tongue in this area when he taught me.However, what I paid attention to as I looked at her was not the magical powers she possessed, but her eyes. Her non-attribute magic is only a part of her power she possesses. The real thing is her \u2018eyes\u2019.\u2018Those eyes. I think I saw her somewhere.\u2019My master had all kinds of old books that I can\u2019t find now, and the typical ones were books about monsters and demons that are hundreds of years old.There are no monsters except for a very small number of cryptids now, but it is said that in the past, this continent was full of monsters and even demons that controlled those monsters.I thought of Rene\u2019s eyes. Her eyes were pale blue however, while we were talking a while ago, I noticed that the color of Rene\u2019s eyes had changed subtly.Among the deep blue irises, a pure white light shone like the stars in the sky. Her eyes resembled the calm waters of the Milky Way in the night sky. There was no way I could not have been unaware of those peculiar eyes.\u2018An eye to distinguish between good and evil, the Judgment. Unless I\u2019m mistaken, Rene is the owner of that eye.\u2019The Judgment is an eye that distinguishes between good and evil in others, and clearly shows whether there is any hostility or not. A power that can\u2019t be called magic, but is literally close to a miracle and a mystery.The great thing about this eye is that it can reveal the appearance of \u2018demons\u2019 hiding in the crevices of humans.\u2018Now, those demons are only treated as legends.\u2019To people today, demons are just bad guys with horns on their heads and red skin that appear only in fairy tales. A product of lies to scare children, however, looking at the old books, it seems that they exist.\u2018In a world where magic exists, there must be demons. I also died and came back to life, isn\u2019t there something like that?\u2019And Rene\u2019s eyes had a lot to do with it.I have seen with my own eyes that the Judgment that only existed as a record is real. In other words, the existence of the Judgment that distinguishes demons determines whether demons exist or not.Another characteristic of the Judgment is that if it appears, a big event will occur regardless of the age. Fortunately, Rene\u2019s Judgment was not in a state of being fully awakened, and it seemed that she didn\u2019t even know that she had that kind of ability.But someday she will realize.\u2018Is this also a relationship after all?\u2019No wonder the book she wrote ended up with Rene.\u2018It hurts a little.\u2019It seems that she doesn\u2019t remember but one day she will.To think that I would find the owner of the Judgment eye and face a past relationship like this.\u2018To be involved in this kind of thing in Theon.\u2019I sighed and got up from my seat.I thought that if Rene can use the Judgment properly, maybe I will be able to find out all the members of the secret society who are hiding in Theon.In particular, the most threatening thing to me right now was the First Order, which is still difficult to identify.\u2018They are as vigilant as possible, but there must be something that I can find.\u2019As long as I didn\u2019t know where the first order was and what it was doing, I had no choice but to be as careful as possible. However, if Rene\u2019s Judgment works properly, maybe it will be of great help to me.Aidan and his friends plus Rene. If I cleverly use the power of these children, maybe\u2026\u2026After putting on my coat and opening the door to leave the office, I finally heard a creaking sound outside the door and had to stop.\u201cOuch.\u201dA blue-haired girl sat on the floor, clutching her head. Looking down at her, I spoke with a cold voice, contrary to my bewildered heart.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on here, Flora Lumos?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Why are you hanging around my door like a thief?\u201dAt Rudger\u2019s words, Flora jumped up from her seat and coughed, wiping the dust off her school uniform skirt.The forehead Rudger bumped into as he opened the door was still red and flushed, but she tried to pretend it was okay and opened her mouth.\u201cHmmmm\u2026.I came here because I wanted to ask you something.\u201dShe acted gracefully, but she couldn\u2019t hide the subtle trembling of her voice.\u201cIf you have any questions related to the content of the class, you can come to me anytime, don\u2019t wait outside like this.\u201d\u201cNo, not that. First of all, I would like to express my gratitude to Mr. Rudger.\u201d\u201cGratitude?\u201d\u201cI, that\u2026\u2026You saved me by stopping magic that almost went crazy.\u201dSo it was because of that. She came here to say thank you? As Rudger stared at her with a look of surprise, Flora was furious.\u201cWhy are you looking at me like that?\u201d\u201cIt is nothing.\u201dPerhaps it was because she had never expressed gratitude to anyone like this, so Flora was very awkward about herself. She felt something tickling her skin to say this, but she was determined to say it.\u201cThank you for saving me.\u201d\u201cI just did what I had to do as a teacher.\u201dRudger spoke so succinctly, that it seemed like he had no feelings of selflessness at all.Flora seemed fortunate, but it also strangely hurt her self-esteem. Still, since she came to apologize, she decided not to complain about the little things.\u201c\u2026\u2026I thought that what the teacher said was not wrong at all.\u201dShe rubbed the hair with her fingers and hit her feet.Rudger pondered what else to say and immediately realized what she was talking about.\u2018Use meaningful magic. Do not lower your value.\u2019\u201cI wish I had known.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Rather, are you okay, sir?\u201dAt Flora\u2019s question, Rudger asked, wriggling his eyebrows.\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cThe power consumption must have been great. I too was exhausted from suppressing my magic power, wasn\u2019t it harder for teacher than for me? The burden of helping people is several times higher.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201dRudger said so, but in fact, he almost passed out from the depletion of his magical powers.He had a magic potion that he had prepared in advance in case of any unforeseen circumstances, otherwise he might have collapsed in front of the students.He was fortunate enough to have a lot of medicine in case he would be short of mana. Of course, he ended up using almost all of the medicine he had prepared to stop Flora\u2019s magic.\u2018Well, I can make it again.\u2019This is Theon so there are places that teach pharmaceutical classes, and there is also a pharmacy room where teachers can freely enter in the research building.Since the pharmacy room, where he can make any number of medications you want, is equipped with all kinds of materials, it doesn\u2019t matter if the teachers just fill out an access list whenever they want and start experimenting right away.Flora wiggled her fingers and asked.\u201cHow many elements does Mr. Rudger handle?\u201d\u201cWhy are you asking that?\u201d\u201cYou talked about 5 in class. Isn\u2019t that quite a lot?\u201dRudger suddenly wondered why Flora was asking him so many questions. Most of the children called geniuses move on their own, and because of their strong ego, they don\u2019t have much conversation with others.Rudger thought that Flora was like that. In the class, he thought that she tried to combine 3 elements because of that reason.A student is still a student, right? She probably wanted to check the level of skill of the teacher who teaches her.Rudger pondered what to answer.\u2018Actually, I know how to handle almost everything.\u2019The 10 most common elements. Rudger knew how to use them \u2018all\u2019. He was the exact opposite of a single attribute wizard who achieved the ultimate in that element. However, for that reason, he did not achieve a certain level in any element.In the eyes of others, he may seem like an all-rounder with great talent, but in reality, Rudger himself evaluated himself as an incompetent bastard.\u2018Even so, if I say I can use every element it will be a problem.\u2019Among the wizards remaining in the history of the Magic Tower, 8 are known to have handled the most elements. This is the official No. 1 record specified in the <Wizard Book>, the history of wizards but now, Rudger has already broken that record.If this fact is known, the tower will probably be overturned once more and there will be chaos. A quick-tempered person might want to dissect Rudger alive. In fact, Rudger did not consider it unusual that he dealt with all of the ten elements.\u2018At first, Master didn\u2019t say anything good to me either.\u2019If I had to pick the person who had the greatest influence on me after I was born in this world, of course Master is number one. He is the one who taught me magic since childhood, how to live in the world, and other miscellaneous tips and knowledge.He took me as a disciple purely because he thought that I was unique and fun. Even considering that, I felt quite grateful to my teacher. However, since he was such an eccentric person, he only evaluated my source code as \u2018not bad\u2019.Naturally, it was his teacher who advised Rudger, who uses all the 10 elements, to say, \u2018you won\u2019t go anywhere with that kind of stuff\u2019.So, under the serious advice and teachings of his master, Rudger was never arrogant, even if he knew how to handle all ten elements.\u201cFive elements.\u201d\u201cFive\u2026\u2026Surprisingly a lot.\u201d\u201cIs that the end of the questions?\u201d\u201cI have one more question about the source code. Will the source code be taught to all the students in the class?\u201dIn the first class, Rudger deliberately showed the source code to attract the students\u2019 interest.He didn\u2019t stop at just showing. Rudger actually intended to teach students the source code. However, he did not properly explain to whom, how much, and when.\u201cNo, because this magic is like the bottom line for me as well. There are conditions.\u201d\u201cWhat are the conditions?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s something I will pass on to only the top five students.\u201dIn response, Flora smiled curiously.\u201cThat\u2019s few since the total capacity of the class is 80 people.\u201d\u201cBecause that\u2019s magic.\u201d\u201cWhat about the evaluation? Are you lowering it as a final evaluation of the semester? In one semester, the evaluation is divided into 4 parts in total. It must be difficult to make a decision as the rankings are constantly changing for each evaluation.\u201d\u201cI expected that to happen, so I devised a way.\u201dRudger immediately activated a magic trick on the palm of his hand.It could be seen as monotonous because it was made of only pure white magical lines, but the complex structure it created made it impossible to take this magic lightly.Flora also exclaimed softly at the color felt from the magic itself.\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u2026.a part of the source code.\u201d\u201cYou saw it right.\u201dRudger nodded his head.As Flora said, the magic technique he has now demonstrated is one of the main components of the source code.\u201cI call this <Framework>.\u201d\u201cFramework\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cSource code consists of a total of four frameworks.\u201d\u201cSo you want to give this framework to the top 5 on a quarterly basis?\u201d\u201cYes. The semester is divided into 4 parts, and each of the 4 frameworks will be delivered one by one. In other words, someone who doesn\u2019t consistently make it into the top 5 won\u2019t get the entire magic.\u201dThe students can\u2019t get the complete source code just because they got in the top 5 just once. If they want the entire source code the students will have to attend classes, submit assignments, and pass the exams well for a semester.Flora, realizing this, looked at Rudger with a slightly bewildered look.\u201c\u2026\u2026You are very calculating.\u201d\u201cI wonder if this solves the problem?\u201d\u201cBy the way, can you just show me this?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t this a framework? What if I analyze it?\u201dFlora pointed to the framework technique still floating on Rudger\u2019s hand.It\u2019s impossible for a wizard to keep revealing his magic so openly, unless he trusts the other person.\u2018Ah.\u2019Rudger realized his mistake. Wizards basically do not show the magic they have developed to others for a long time. They don\u2019t publish a thesis or submit a patent, because if someone copies their technique and claims it\u2019s theirs, it will be a headache.In fact, that often happens. It was for this reason that wizards thoroughly kept their arcane magic a secret.Rudger recognized his mistake, but he decided it was no big deal.\u201cDoes not matter.\u201d\u201cYeah?\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you see it.\u201dRudger knew that Flora Lumos is a genius and after seeing what she did in class today he realized that she\u2019ll take the first place.\u2018No matter what she does in my class, she\u2019ll get first place.\u2019Even if she doesn\u2019t, she\u2019ll be consistently in the top 5, so it won\u2019t be a problem if he shows her a framework anyway. If it were her, she would be able to learn the whole source code.\u201cYes?!\u201dBut Flora took Rudger\u2019s words differently.Her face reddened, and then she began to stutter her words out of nowhere, despite her usual arrogance.\u201cWhy are you so upset? After all, aren\u2019t you going to confidently take first place in my class and receive a framework?\u201d\u201cOh, no, but\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cStill, it\u2019s against the law to say that\u2026\u201dFlora Lumos replied in a low voice so that Rudger could not hear her. But as she thought about it, she couldn\u2019t stop her heart beating.Even if she pretended not to be blunt on the outside, the fact that this man was taking good care of her made Flora wince her lip and try to keep going up.\u201cThen I\u2019ll let you go.\u201dAs Rudger turned his back, Flora unknowingly called him up and stopped him.\u201cSir!\u201d\u201cWhat else? Do you have any more questions left?\u201d\u201cNo. That, ah, nothing.\u201dAs she turned around and saw Rudger\u2019s face staring at her with an unwavering gaze, Flora\u2019s face flushed red as if it was about to explode.Hearing those words a while ago, she couldn\u2019t possibly look directly at Rudger\u2019s face. Just the touch of his eyes made her skin tickle.\u2018Strange. I\u2019ve never had anything like this before.\u2019Rudger looked at Flora, who was bewildered and helpless, and then he turned his back on her and left.Flora, who had been staring endlessly at Rudger\u2019s back as he was leaving, finally regained her reason and calmed her excitement.\u2018Yes. Calm down Flora Lumos. You aren\u2019t like this.\u2019Wasn\u2019t she the one who always made fun of others with her own abilities?To Rudger, although she tried on the first day, she failed horribly, and she lost again this time but her will has not yet been broken.Didn\u2019t she promise to surpass him next time? Her heart should not have been weakened like this. Flora made up her mind to be weak.\u2018Come to think of it, I was going to ask what he was talking about with that commoner girl, but I forgot.\u2019Even if she pretended not to be, she was curious about why Rudger had called Rene separately.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 44": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Academy\u2019s Undercover ProfessorCH 44Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayC44: A Dangerous Bet (1)After all of the pharmacy classes taught by Marie Ross were over, Aidan immersed himself in magic practice, recalling the technique that Rudger had taught him in the last class.Next to Aidan were Leo, who was now a close friend, and Tracy, who had recently joined Aidan, and often spends time with him. The three of them worked hard to master the elements by embodying each element in the first training ground.\u201cWhoa. Almost done.\u201dAidan wiped the sweat running down his forehead, looking at the element of wind embodied on the palm of his hand.It was like the memory of the warm and cool wind that he felt while running through the wide fields in the countryside.He didn\u2019t know anything about the elements, so Aidan couldn\u2019t hide his excitement at the fact that he was able to manifest elements like this.\u2018It\u2019s amazing.\u2019The advice Rudger gave was practical enough so that nothing could be missed. Not only Rudger\u2019s advice, but also his attitude towards magic that he showed in class was enough to touch Aidan\u2019s heart.\u2018I wonder if I was mistaken to suspect Mr. Rudger back then?\u2019Rudger\u2019s words and actions are always cold, but in his voice it was evident how much he liked magic and how he truly considered it.There\u2019s nothing wrong with a person who likes magic.Above all, if Rudger was a bad person, he would not have been able to pass on to the students in class such a precious method that others did not teach.\u2018I don\u2019t know yet.\u2019Aidan vaguely sensed that he had something to do with Rudger. But that didn\u2019t mean he didn\u2019t feel that Rudger was a bad person. Maybe it\u2019s because his head got complicated because of those contradictory emotions but the wind element he barely manifested disappeared without a trace.Aidan, who had lost his appetite, looked at Leo and Tracy. The two of them were sweating and working hard on the manifestation of elements. It was because both of them were impressed by the warm flame that Aidan showed in the class.He didn\u2019t want to interfere with them, so he was just watching, and then, a group of students entered the training ground.\u2018These kids\u2026\u2026.\u2019Among some students, there was a person who caught Aidan\u2019s attention. Dark blue hair with a slight blue tinge, a neat hairstyle with a parted forehead that shows it. Conversely, white skin to the extent that it felt pale, a sharp nose, and sharp, narrow eyes stood out.He seemed to be a sophomore, with a natural quirk, and all the students gathered around him.\u2018Who is it? Noble students gather like that. He seems like a great person.\u2019As he was watching him like that, he turned his head and looked at Aidan. Their eyes met in the air and Aidan suddenly remembered what Leo had said.Did he tell him not to make eye contact for a long time and not even pay attention to noble students?Aidan wasn\u2019t stupid enough to say, Nice to meet you\u2019, so he naturally looked away. The other party didn\u2019t even point it out.Aidan had also taken a moderate rest, so he decided to focus on practicing magic again.\u201cWhat? Who is this?\u201dUntil one of the aristocratic students in the crowd approached Aidan with a loud voice.Leo and Tracy lost their concentration at the voice, and looked at their opponent. A male student with a mean smile was gazing at Aidan, raising the corners of his mouth.\u201cAh, you.\u201dHe was Jevan Pellio, the eldest son of the writer Pellio Nam, who had an argument with Aidan, but withdrew after hearing a bitter voice from Leo.\u201cWhy is he suddenly pretending to know you again?\u201dRecognizing him, Leo\u2019s expression rotted in an instant.Jevan Pellio, not paying attention to it, deliberately approached Aidan and the others as if to show off.\u201cAren\u2019t you, Aidan, who didn\u2019t even properly manifest the elements?\u201dThere was no way that Aidan and his friends could not know his heart.Leo replied with a cynical smile.\u201cWe\u2019re busy practicing magic right now, so why don\u2019t you go in that corner?\u201d\u201cSo it\u2019s that cheeky commoner from back then? After all, you two got along well, didn\u2019t you?\u201dLeo\u2019s gaze was over Jevan\u2019s shoulders, as he turned to the noble students who watched this situation with interest, especially the man who stood at the center of the group.\u201cSince there are seniors here, are you trying to show off your good side on this occasion?\u201dLeo knew very well who the senior at the center of the aristocratic students was since there were very few celebrities like that in Theon.Freuden Ulburg, the eldest son of Ulburg, one of the three duke families of the Exilion Empire, symbolizing the wolf.It was understandable that Jevan was suddenly arguing, he wanted to stand out since Freuden, who can be said to be the center of the noble students, was present.\u201cWe have no intention of playing with you, so get out of here. This is a place to practice magic.\u201dAt Leo\u2019s words, Jevan sneered.\u201cA commoner like you shouldn\u2019t speak to this body of noble blood.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s because you don\u2019t understand the situation yet\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cAnd I spoke to Aidan, so why would a little kid like you intervene at will?\u201dTo Leo, the words \u201clittle boy\u201d were close to abhorrence because Leo was short compared to his peers. Some girls liked Leo, but Leo hated being treated like that. For Leo, his small height was his Achilles tendon.\u201cYou\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cLeo, calm down. Just leave it to me.\u201dAidan stopped Leo from getting angry and stepped forward. At this rate, it seemed that the situation would not end.\u201cI don\u2019t know why you started this all of a sudden, but let it go. I don\u2019t want to fight with my friends.\u201dJevan\u2019s face contorted terribly at Aidan\u2019s words.\u201cFriend? Why am I your friend? This filthy trash.\u201d\u201cOh, weren\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cAre you crazy?\u201dJevan was annoyed by Aidan\u2019s stare.\u201cIf you are a commoner, you should bow your head in front of the nobles like a commoner.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what offended you, but I apologize. Sorry. So, can\u2019t you just let it go?\u201dThe boy who had never received any unprovoked hostility from anyone, but he did not want to bring himself into a fight.Jevan responded with a smirk to Aidan\u2019s words.\u201cGreat. Then I\u2019ll let it go, so just do one thing.\u201dThen he pointed his hand at his feet.\u201cKneel down.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u2026!\u201dTracy stepped forward.\u201cDo it in moderation. Do you have no shame as a noble?\u201d\u201cWhat? Why does a fallen nobleman intervene at will?\u201dAt those words, Tracy\u2019s face hardened.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIs embarrassing to even call you a noble, so shut up because that disgusting smell is going to come to me as well.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Do you want to die?\u201dFor Tracy her family situation was taboo of taboos but Jevan was careless with his words. When her magical powers overflowed from her body everyone laughed at her.\u201cYou don\u2019t have a proper education\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cJevan Pellio.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dIt was none other than Aidan who called his name. However, Aidan\u2019s voice was different from usual and made Jevan tremble without realizing it.\u201cI can\u2019t do anything about you being dissatisfied with me. If you\u2019re going to insult me I\u2019ll let it pass. But\u2026\u201dAidan strode towards Jevan. His eyes blazed with anger glared at him.\u201cI won\u2019t let you insult my friends.\u201d\u201cHahaha. What if I do? Great, then let\u2019s duel.\u201dAs if waiting, Jevan took out his white gloves from his pocket and threw them at Aidan.\u201cIt\u2019s a magical duel. If you\u2019re scared, run away.\u201dAidan shook his head as he watched the gloves hit his own chest and fell.\u201cDo I really have to do this?\u201d\u201cYou can refuse if you\u2019re scared.\u201d\u201c\u2026Great.\u201dAidan nodded.\u201cAidan!\u201d\u201cWhat the hell are you doing?!\u201dTracy and Leo wanted to stop him, but Aidan\u2019s intuition was telling him not to back down. He didn\u2019t even want to escape.\u201cGreat. The loser gets down on his knees and apologizes to the winner. Do you agree?\u201d\u201cIf you promise to keep your word.\u201d\u201cHahaha! Yes! If you can defeat me.\u201dEveryone was confident. Although they are said to be first year students of Theon, Aidan is a beginner who has not yet learned the basics of magic properly.Jevan, who has been learning magic from a private tutor since childhood, was confident of defeating Aidan. It was the moment when a fight was about to take place around the two of them.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dA cold voice strongly pressed the shoulders of all the students present at the scene.* * *I was patrolling. Although the werewolf incident is over, the patrol will continue for a while since the president isn\u2019t sure if something will happen.It\u2019s annoying, but somehow I can\u2019t help it, so I was just wandering around thinking about going for a walk to cool my head.\u2014And it took me less than five minutes to realize how easy accidents could happen.\u201cWhat are you doing now?\u201dSeeing the two students almost on the verge of a fight, I asked.I was a little annoyed, but I still have to listen to them before acting. Perhaps they did not know that I would appear, and some of the students\u2019 complexions turned white. Anyone who sees them would think that some kind of ghost appeared.\u201cYou two there. What are you going to do now?\u201dI asked, pointing to the two students at the center of this case. One of them was particularly familiar, and when I looked closely I realized it was Aidan, a brown-haired country boy.\u2018\u2026\u2026It\u2019s you again.\u2019Is his opponent an aristocratic student? I think his name was Jevan Pellio.I sighed.\u201cThe training ground is for honing your magic, but you\u2019re trying to fight each other.\u201dAs I approached slowly, the students who were nearby opened the way to avoid me. Strangely, I was taken aback by the way I was treated, but I decided not to care.Ignoring everything I said to Aidan.\u201cTell me what happened.\u201d\u201cThat, that\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cThis is a fair match!\u201dJevan shouted from behind me. I looked at him without a word.Is it because you think I\u2019m ignoring him? The guy was staring at me with courage, not hiding his anger.\u201cIs this a fair fight?\u201d\u201cYes. I\u2019m going to have a magic duel with Aidan, it\u2019s not a fight.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s funny that the first year students are having a magic duel.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it okay for first-year students?\u201dWhy is this kid doing this? What did he eat wrong? I was a little embarrassed when a guy normally wouldn\u2019t stand out spoke boldly and I could understand why.It was because of the other students standing behind him, as if supporting him. One guy in particular stood out.\u2018That guy\u2026\u2026.\u2019Looking at the subordinates he has around him, he is considered a captain. He also looked at me and gave me a slightly puzzled look.\u2018It was a confrontation between commoners and aristocrats in the first training ground. This situation is somehow familiar.\u2019Somehow I thought it was familiar, but it was the same as the last fight between Rene and Dunema. However, in the case of Rene, it was a surprise attack, and this time, it seems they were trying to fight each other.I have a headache.Well, boys fight each other. Even in a world like this, it\u2019s not strange, but why does something like this happen when I\u2019m on patrol? One of them is even Aidan, whom I had been keeping an eye on for a long time.\u201cJevan Pellio and Aidan, I have no intention of holding you accountable for something that hasn\u2019t happened yet. So, all of you go back to the dormitory.\u201d\u201cMr. Rudger!\u201d\u201cI told you to go back.\u201dAs he stared at him strongly, I wondered if he would challenge the authority of the teacher head-on, since he has the noble faction on his back.\u201cJust leave it alone.\u201dA new voice was heard. The eyes of the students turned to the entrance opposite the one I entered. There I saw a man approaching and staring at me.\u201cMr. Chris.\u201dThis time, it was Chris Benimore, a new teacher who joined Theon with me and belonged to the noble faction.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 45": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Academy\u2019s Undercover ProfessorCH 45Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayC45: A Dangerous Bet (2)The atmosphere was changed by Chris Benimore\u2019s appearance. In particular, the reaction of the noble students was hot, and the reason was simple. This is because Chris Benimore comes from a noble family and was a teacher who pushed other noble students from behind.Rudger stared at him and opened his mouth.\u201cMr. Chris Benimore. I do not understand what you are saying.\u201d\u201cIt will not be difficult. Literally.\u201d\u201cLiterally?\u201d\u201cEven if we are teachers, we cannot control all the behaviors of our students. Listening to the story, it seems that both students are arbitrarily trying to compete. Isn\u2019t it too much of a violation of freedom for a teacher to step in and stop it?\u201dAt Chris\u2019 smirk, Rudger\u2019s eyebrows twitched slightly, but that was only for a moment.Rudger glanced at the mood of the other students. Looking at the reactions, he could see some students nodding their heads at Chris\u2019 words. It would be an abuse to interfere since the students want to compete.\u2018I made a mistake.\u2019Chris Benimore is a teacher who favors noble students. His appearance boosted the students\u2019 momentum considerably so Rudger decided to take a step back.\u201cEven so, it is problematic for students to engage in magic duels without the teacher\u2019s permission. If students are seriously injured, it is also a loss for Theon.\u201d\u201cOf course it is. But how about doing this?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThe two of us will observe.\u201dAt Chris\u2019 words, the students murmured.\u201cWill Mr. Rudger and Mr. Chris supervise the duel?\u201dJust imagining it makes my heart ache with the burden.Some students were perplexed, but the noble students were different, there was a twinkle in their eyes. The teacher said that he would take care of it himself, so my justification to stop the match with the pretext of danger disappears.\u201cOr are you going to say that this is also dangerous? Mr. Rudger Chelici.\u201dChris smiled cynically, deliberately provoking Rudger.\u201cI didn\u2019t know that you would care so much about the children that you protected them like that.\u201d\u201cI just considered the possibility of possible danger.\u201d\u201cBut if the two of us go, there\u2019s no risk. How is it? Those two students want to fight each other.\u201dAt Chris\u2019s words, which had an explicit intention towards this side, Rudger could roughly guess the situation. Prior to this, Chris Benimore had not been very fond of Rudger Chelici.He is also a new teacher at Theon but unlike Rudger, who\u2019s a fallen aristocrat, Chris is still a noble. For Chris, who is deeply aristocratic, the very existence of Rudger has always bothered him.\u2018Rudger Chelici, I didn\u2019t like you from the first time I saw you.\u2019The other commoner teachers were still just plain commoners. No matter what he did, he was fussy, lacked nobility, and was not restrained at all but Rudger was different. He shone more than anyone else and was far more aristocratic than himself, a nobleman.Even after the fall of his family he didn\u2019t lose his brilliance. That\u2019s not what Chris liked. It was like that when they first met. There was no sign of surprise at all when he saw him, but Chris thought that something was creeping inside him at the behavior of Rudger, who just shook his head.\u2018Anyway, I didn\u2019t like it when Hugo-sensei asked us to invite him into our faction.\u2019Rudger is said to have even told Hugo openly that he would not go into such a place.\u2018Such a place? What do you mean by such a place\u2019Chris didn\u2019t understand. The more he tried, the darker his feelings for Rudger grew and at this moment, Chris got a chance to win one over Rudger.\u201cHow is it Mr. Rudger? Isn\u2019t this enough?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s hear from the students.\u201dRudger said so and turned to Aidan. It was a gaze that meant do you really want to have a magic duel with Jevan.\u201c\u2026\u2026Yes. Certainly.\u201dAidan nodded with determination.Aidan, too, at first thought that he wanted to solve the problem verbally without fighting however Jevan crossed the line too much. He said such harsh things to his friend and Aidan couldn\u2019t forgive that.Rudger sighed inwardly at the sight and looked back at Chris.\u201cStudent Aidan said he would do it, too, so I\u2019ll allow him to attend on condition, as Mr. Chris said.\u201d\u201cOh, that\u2019s good.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cAh. Mr. Rudger. Wait.\u201d\u201cWhat else?\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t we make a bet too?\u201d\u201cBet? It\u2019s such a sudden proposition.\u201d\u201cIt seems that Mr. Rudger really cares about that commoner child.\u201d\u201cI am Aidan, not a commoner. Please beware of discriminatory remarks.\u201d\u201cAh, you are student Aidan. I didn\u2019t know because I didn\u2019t take my class. Anyway, I think of Jevan Pellio as a pretty talented wizard.\u201dIt was a word of mouth, but Jevan had already taken it seriously, and his expression changed.Rudger responded in a cold voice, as usual.\u201cSo what exactly are you going to do?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s up to each other to decide who will win. Of course, I\u2019m betting that student Pellio will win.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s funny that someone who became a teacher makes bets in front of the students.\u201dChris was annoyed at those words, but he managed to hold it in and kept his smile.\u201cSo what are you going to do? Well, if you don\u2019t like it, there\u2019s nothing I can do about it. I wouldn\u2019t bet on the losing side like Mr. Rudger did.\u201dThe students murmured at those words. As Rudger took care of Aidan in the eyes of the students the situation became Aidan and Rudger vs. Jevan and Chris.Rudger found Chris\u2019 behavior funny. It was enough to simply reject neatly and step away but even so, he couldn\u2019t erase this feeling of regret.It was Chris who encouraged the fight that could have been stopped in the first place, and he was even subtly making moves on him. There were too many eyes so Rudger couldn\u2019t ignore the situation and he was getting annoyed.\u2018Why do I have to step back?\u2019The reason he hasn\u2019t paid much attention to Chris, who has been hostile, is simply that he didn\u2019t feel the need to. After all, there is no need to expend his energy against a person he didn\u2019t like from the start. But now that he tried to make a move against him things were different.\u2018Yes. Let\u2019s hang out a little.\u2019He really wanted to check out Aidan\u2019s true skills through this match so Rudger nodded his head.\u201cSince Mr. Chris wants that, I will join you.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t think Mr. Rudger would accept this. So, Mr. Rudger, who do you think will win?\u201d\u201cOf course, Aidan.\u201dAidan\u2019s eyes widened at Rudger\u2019s unwavering voice. He never thought that Rudger would choose him here. It was the same with other students on the other hand, Chris seemed to know this. In fact, he nodded his head satisfactorily, as if he had hoped for this to happen.\u201cGood.\u201d\u201cWhat will be the outcome of the bet?\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026Well, we\u2019re still teachers of Theon, but aren\u2019t we magicians? We are also teachers who teach classes on the same manifestation system.\u201dAt that, Rudger asked, seemingly surprised.\u201cYou also teach the manifestation system?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dRudger was asking because he really didn\u2019t know but Chris\u2019s face turned red.\u2018Hey, you damn fallen noble!\u2019This was one of the reasons Chris hated Rudger. Chris Benimore came to Theon to teach the manifestation system, he was proud of that fact. Then, out of the blue, he found out that an unheard-of fallen noble named Rudger Chelici was in charge of the same manifestation class as him.Rudger was even in charge of the second year, and Chris himself was in charge of the lower first year.It is natural for someone with more skill to take charge of a higher grade. In other words, Chris Benimore already knew the fact that he was one step below Rudger Chelici.Rudger even allowed the first graders to attend his classes, so he took many talented students out of his first year class. He had good reasons to hate Rudger.\u2018You think you\u2019ll be safe after insulting me like that?\u2019In fact, Rudger was unaware of his own actions. Because he didn\u2019t even know that Chris Benimore was a teacher of the manifestation system like him. That fact further crushed Chris Benimore\u2019s self-esteem but Rudger barely understood Chris\u2019 behavior.\u2018No wonder that he was hostile to me. So it\u2019s because we\u2019re both in charge of the same manifestation class.\u2019Chris was pissed off and being compared to a teacher who teaches the same class only made him angrier. Rudger even showed the source code a magic that would never be taught in a normal class. Unknowingly, the comparison Chris was experiencing among the students must have intensified.Chris managed to calm his anger and fixed his glasses.\u201cHmmm\u2026In any case, we\u2019re going to offer each one a field of magic or theory that we have studied in the manifestation system. Oh, of course, it\u2019s not important data, but wouldn\u2019t it be enough to make a bet?\u201d\u201cShouldn\u2019t we also state what level of theory we have to offer?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s up to each individual to decide.\u201dAt your discretion, there is nothing more difficult than that. When it comes to food, it is no different than saying to add ingredients in moderation.If you give something that is so ridiculously useless, you\u2019re revealing that your level is only this but if you give something too good, you will lose a lot.In the end, it was said that \u2018moderate\u2019 among wizards was just the middle line that would not damage his reputation and would not damage him. Rudger didn\u2019t really care what it was, so he decided to accept it.\u201cGreat. However, it would be impossible to compete right now, so let\u2019s give it some time.\u201d\u201cHow much time?\u201d\u201cThree days later would be appropriate. Then we will have a public match.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026.3 days?\u201dHe didn\u2019t know if his opponent would do anything to the student he was supporting, but the time of three days was quite tight for that.Even a genius cannot learn new magic in 3 days. All you have to do is analyze your opponent and maintain your best condition.\u201cThen we\u2019ll do it again at this location in three days.\u201d\u201cGreat.\u201dThe news that a public magic duel was decided with the consent of two teachers spread through Theon in an instant.* * *With everyone scattered to spread the word about the duel somehow, Aidan looked at Rudger who was still there and was at a loss for what to do. He felt guilty about thinking that Rudger had been swept up in this case because of him, and he opened his mouth, wanting to apologize.\u201cI, Mr. Rudger. Sorry. Just because of me\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cDone.\u201dRudger cut Aidan\u2019s words coldly.\u201cYeah? But\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cIt has already happened. What you need to worry about now is not how to apologize for what happened, but how to win the duel against Jevan Pellio.\u201d\u201cUh, um. That is correct.\u201dRudger\u2019s words were right. It was too late for regrets. Still, Aidan wasn\u2019t sure about something. He didn\u2019t know if he\u2019d be able to defeat Jevan since he was just a beginner at magic.\u201cWhat are you so worried about?\u201dRudger pushed Aidan.\u201cAre you saying you can\u2019t do it now?\u201d\u201cThat, that\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cAidan, you told me you would do it. Then, was your answer at that time just a lie that you were forced to bring out because you were swept away by the atmosphere?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026It is not.\u201d\u201cI hope you were serious when you accepted the duel.\u201d\u201cBut in practice\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cNot different. Jevan is from a noble family, and he must have received personal education before joining Theon. He is already different from you and you know it too.\u201dAidan couldn\u2019t argue with that because everything Rudger said was right.\u201cHowever, it is too early to make a hasty conclusion. Aidan, what do you think is important in a fight?\u201d\u201cUh, um. I do not know. Is it your skill?\u201dRudger shook his head.\u201cNo matter how talented someone is, it is not uncommon for him to die at the hand of someone weaker. The world doesn\u2019t just flow by the logic of power. A battle is won or lost in an instant.\u201d\u201cThen what is it?\u201d\u201cYou already have it.\u201dAt Rudger\u2019s point, Aidan kept his mouth shut. It must be referring to the [special] type of magic that he possesses.\u201cYou only need to use it for the important moments.\u201dThere was only one reason Rudger took Chris\u2019 bet so easily. Because he was sure that Aidan would win this fight.\u201cBut I\u2026\u2026I want to win only with my pure skills!\u201dBut Aidan was different. He was obviously grateful for the magic that made him enter Theon, but he was unwilling to win with it.\u201cMr. Rudger! Please teach me!\u201dAidan stared at Rudger with an unwavering gaze. Rudger, who looked down at Aidan with a cold gaze, was bewildered inside.\u2018Why is this guy here?\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 46": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Academy\u2019s Undercover ProfessorCH 46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayC46: A Dangerous Bet (3)Chapter 3/3 for last week.To be honest, at first, when Chris wanted me to bet with him on the result of the duel I was happy on the inside but I didn\u2019t show it on the outside because this was a sure win bet since Aidan managed to enter Theon then he must have enough talent and skills.Even though students from wealthy merchant families and aristocrats have been thoroughly educated from an early age, so it is natural for them to be far ahead of commoner students at the beginning of the semester.It was only two weeks after the new semester started and the common students did not have enough time to catch up with the aristocrats but Aidan is different from normal students.\u2018Mr. Chris Benimore doesn\u2019t seem to know that at all.\u2019If I were in charge of the first-year manifestation system class, I would have checked the list of students who were unusual among the first-year students. Still, Chris didn\u2019t think much of Aidan.Here I realized one thing; Chris Benimore said he didn\u2019t even pay attention to the commoner students.\u2018Perhaps he only memorized the names of students from noble families whom he should be concerned about.\u2019It is a disqualification as a teacher, but I understand. A person who was born as a noble, lived as a noble, will continue to live as an aristocrat. If such a person had a commoner living in a world completely different from his own, he would of course be offended. In that case, it is quite wise to simply not even pay attention to it.I have no intention of blaming students for judging by class or discriminating against students because this is such a world.\u2018But he never thought it would hold him back.\u2019Even if Aidan lacked magical knowledge, he was able to enter Theon because of the [Unusual] type of magic he possessed. He got some sort of admissions benefits, but that doesn\u2019t mean Aidan is bad because it is the president\u2019s greatest wish right now for more students who have learned such rare magic to gather at Theon.\u2018Perhaps it will be too late to realize what kind of magic Aidan has learned later.\u2019The bet has already been placed. Claiming invalidity for not knowing is rather an act of revealing one\u2019s own shortcomings in not being able to confirm information in advance. Even if Chris would probably realize Aidan\u2019s skills, he would have no choice but to carry on the bet.\u2018But what the hell is this guy talking about?\u2019What? You want to win with your own strength? For a moment, I didn\u2019t understand what the heck he was talking about. I had no choice but to realize how outgoing and righteous this guy Aidan was. He is a guy who is willing to help a werewolf who was threatening his own life.I was thinking of saying something to calm myself down, but I got a little worried.\u2018Isn\u2019t it a good thing to check it out once in a while?\u2019It didn\u2019t seem too bad to take this opportunity to check his will and talent to learn something new. The elemental manifestation was too basic, so it was impossible to gauge Aidan\u2019s talent with that alone.\u2018I should teach you something a little more advanced.\u2019I glanced down at Aidan. Perhaps he sensed my gaze but I could see him shaking his shoulders.\u201cAidan.\u201d\u201cYes, yes.\u201d\u201cIf that\u2019s what you want, it\u2019s fine. For the remaining three days, I will teach you how to prepare for the duel.\u201d\u201cReally? But that\u2019s\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cThe dices have already been cast. Maybe Mr. Chris will give Jevan some advice or teach him how to polish his basic magic. This isn\u2019t a confrontation between students, it\u2019s a matter of pride between me and Mr. Chris as teachers and wizards.\u201dIf it is something completely basic, such as implementing an attribute element, there is no need to think about it again.\u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t anything to teach.\u201dA match between wizards and wizards is not purely magic. The casting speed, the magnificence of magic and the magical accuracy are not enough. It is only a prejudice that wizards fight only with magic.\u201cAidan. I will teach you how to fight against wizards.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cYes. However, the remaining period is 3 days. It\u2019s tight, so what I can teach you will be only the very basics. It will be very difficult and you may fail. Will you still do it?\u201d\u201cYeah! I\u2019ll do it.\u201dAidan answered in a loud voice that he had made up his mind.\u2018Good attitude.\u2019\u201cThen let\u2019s start today.\u201d\u201cYes? Really?\u201dAidan had a slightly confused face as he didn\u2019t know that we would start right now. I nodded and pointed at the two who were watching us from a distance.\u201cThe same goes for both of you.\u201d\u201cYeah?\u201d\u201cMe too?\u201dLeo and Tracy were both embarrassed when I called them, but they couldn\u2019t refuse. Aidan is not going to be the only one that has to improve and I think they will continue to be together in the future.With 3 days remaining Chris and Jevan must have been thinking that they had won and I let them enjoy themselves for now. But, will they still be able to smile after what will happen three days later?I started to look forward to the day a little.* * *\u201cUgh. I will die.\u201dIn the dark night after the sun has completely set, Aidan returned to the dormitory and laid down on the bed with his exhausted body. He prided himself on not skipping training since he came to Theon, but Rudger\u2019s training was unimaginably hard. Maybe it was because he was also a soldier.Aidan remembered the arduous training of Rudger, who was teaching Leo and Tracy with him, and rubbed his stingy body with his hands.\u2018I didn\u2019t know I could use my body like this.\u2019What Rudger taught him wasn\u2019t the manifestation magic or other spells, but how to use his body.He has to use his body and his head at the same time. Because of that, he didn\u2019t know how many times he rolled on the floor of the alternate training ground. He couldn\u2019t believe he had to do this for the next two days.\u2018Still, it feels like something has improved.\u2019Rudger\u2019s teachings were difficult enough to overwhelm the body, but Aidan did not harbor any dissatisfaction and silently carried it out because he instinctively felt certain that this method would help him.\u2018More than that, why did Mr. Rudger say that he would trust me?\u2019Didn\u2019t he think he was going to lose to Jevan? If so, what is the reason?\u2018Is it because of the magic I use?\u2019There was a possibility since teachers have the right to access students\u2019 information but it didn\u2019t make sense for Rudger to be convinced of something with that one thing.Rudger must have never seen him use [Unusual] type magic himself, so why was he so sure? The magic he learned was passed down directly from his master, so it would be difficult to fully understand just by hearing his name.\u2018Does Mr. Rudger know anything about my teacher?\u2019Aidan closed his eyes with that thought in mind. The day was so hard that he fell asleep without even thinking of changing his clothes.* * *Two days after that Aidan was running through the outdoor training ground out of breath.\u201cHeh heh heh heh.\u201dOn the road that Aidan was heading to, Rudger was standing with his back clasped.Aidan, who discovered Rudger, spurred on running even more. Rudger, who was holding his back, stretched out his right hand. At that moment, a sphere of pure white magic flew towards Aidan.Aidan looked at it, clenched his teeth and turned his body to the side and at the same time his magical powers awakened.His leg was twisted and he fell but he managed to avoid the magic by rolling several laps on the ground.Rudger slowly approached Aidan.\u201cThe cycle of magic is circulation, and moving the body is moving the body. Don\u2019t try to overlap them, but recognize them separately.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dAidan, who had become muddy, jumped up from the ground.\u201cYou failed again so run another lap.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dAidan ran back to the training ground.Leo and Tracy, who were sitting on chairs at the training ground and were resting, stared at Aidan with the same gaze as if they were looking at a monster.I\u2019m already tired and I don\u2019t have the strength to run anymore, but Aidan has good stamina.\u201dTracy was purely admiring Aidan\u2019s tireless stamina. She had been cultivating her stamina even before she entered the age of three, but she was not at the level of Aidan. She clenched her teeth and tried to catch up with Aidan, but she eventually lifted the white flag.\u201cHe has great will.\u201dOn the other hand, Leo was taking a break first because his stamina was inferior to that of Tracy due to his small stature but his eyes were sharper than Tracy\u2019s.Although it may seem okay to Tracy, Aidan was in a situation where he was physically at his limit. Nevertheless, the reason for running is probably because of the will to not lose in the duel.\u201cUgh.\u201dTracy ignored Leo\u2019s words and stared blankly at Aidan. He was a boy who didn\u2019t say he hated her even though she acted so badly. Rather, he smiled and asked her to eat together and was the stupid guy who reached out his hand first as her friend.She couldn\u2019t take her eyes off of Aidan\u2019s hard training. He looks dirty with sweat and dirt, but is it too far-fetched to think that he is cool?At some point, Aidan had completed one lap again and was rushing towards Rudger and Rudger raised his hand.\u2018Come.\u2019Leo and Tracy were nervous and a cold sweat was forming on their clenched fists.Rudger\u2019s magic flew towards Aidan, who was panting on the verge of exhaustion. It was the [Shining Stone], a basic manifestation type magic.Because Rudger was watching and shooting, it was not a problem to avoid it as long as he focused on it. The problem is that it\u2019s not easy to dodge while running but seeing Aidan swiping sideways in his running stance, almost avoiding Rudger\u2019s magic, Tracy jumped up from her seat without realizing it.\u201cAvoided!\u201d\u201cNot yet. What\u2019s important is the next step.\u201dLeo said.Dodge the magic and then counterattack. Aidan immediately gathered his magic power while running and wanted to activate a spell. This is a technique that requires separate use of the head and body and it may seem simple at first glance, but for those who have not yet mastered magic properly, there is nothing more difficult than this.It\u2019s more difficult than drawing a square with one hand and a triangle with the other. Moving the body and casting a spell at the same time were a division of thinking.\u2018Aidan, you can do it.\u2019Leo clenched his fists.Wizards must concentrate a lot of their minds in order to cast spells so when they do so they don\u2019t move at all so the wizards were always exposed to danger.Wizards have taken the path of putting a barrier around or shortening the casting time in order to safely manifest their magic but there were also people who walked a completely different path.There were those who had the idea that if it was dangerous to be immobile when using magic, they could use magic while moving. They are wizards, but they do not sit still and train their bodies to the limit to implement magic.Unlike those who learn science and explore magic, they wander around the world to challenge and fight the unknown. They are known as [War Mages]. The method that Rudger taught was the [Moving-Magus], which is the most basic fighting method that the war mages learn.\u201cSuck!\u201dAidan took a deep breath and raised his magic power. His running legs didn\u2019t stop and he didn\u2019t even have time to catch his breath but no words were needed. What mattered was the will. A spell manifested on Aidan\u2019s hand, who was running. Leo and Tracy, who were watching the scene from afar, opened their eyes wide and mouths fell open.Aidan\u2019s magic unfolded. It was the first-tier basic magic, and the same [Shining Stone] that Rudger had shot at him.It was weaker than Rudger\u2019s spell but he managed to cast the spell and shoot it towards Rudger. However, Rudger raised his gloved right hand and caught Aidan\u2019s [Shining Stone] with great ease.Leo and Tracy, who were watching the scene, unknowingly said, \u2018Ah!\u2019, exclaiming with regret.\u201cHuh. Heh.\u201dAidan, who was panting for breath, stopped in front of Rudger.\u201cAidan.\u201d\u201cHuh. huh. Yes. Teacher.\u201d\u201cYou pass.\u201dBefore Rudger\u2019s answer came, Aidan fell on the floor with a smile of accomplishment.\u201cThe duel is tomorrow, so get enough rest today.\u201d\u201cHuh. Heh.\u201dAidan couldn\u2019t afford to answer.Rudger grinned at the sight and turned his back.\u201cYou can do it.\u201dAidan, who was so exhausted, did not hear him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 47": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Academy\u2019s Undercover ProfessorCH 47Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayC47: Student DuelWhen Chris Benimore received a letter from his private office, he read it at one glance and immediately set it on fire.\u201cYes. I knew that too.\u201dThe report that came in was the material sent by a user of Theon and the content was related to Rudger Chelici.\u201cAre you teaching that commoner hard? Even if you pretend not to be, you are desperate to win the bet.\u201dHe murmured and laughed at Rudger\u2019s actions, but that didn\u2019t make Chris Benimore stand still. He turned his head to look at the boy standing in front of him tensely.\u201cJevan Pellio.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cI think you know what I want to say to you.\u201dJevan nodded his head with a determined face.\u201cYeah, I know. I have to win against that cheeky commoner in this duel.\u201d\u201cIt is not enough to just win. You have to show the gap between nobles and commoners with overwhelming power.\u201dIt was a demand that was a little too harsh, but Jevan Pellio didn\u2019t think he was going to fail.When he heard that Aidan was being taught by Rudger Chelici, he was terrified, but he had Chris Benimore.\u201cTake it.\u201dChris tossed a reagent bottle at Jevan.Jevan, who took it in a hurry, looked at the blue liquid inside and asked with a puzzled face.\u201cIs this?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a magic booster. Drink it before the duel.\u201d\u201cBut isn\u2019t this against the rules?\u201d\u201dThis is a special product of our Benimore family that leaves no trace if taken in advance, so there is no need to worry.\u201d\u201cThis\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cWhen you drink it, your magic power is instantly amplified, but the duration is less than 5 minutes.\u201d\u201cFive minutes. It\u2019s short.\u201d\u201cYes it won\u2019t amplify your existing magic, but will increase the limit of the output. The traces of the drug disappear immediately, leaving only the effect. Just pay attention to the magic power exhaustion after 30 minutes.\u201dAt Chris\u2019 words, Jevan swallowed his saliva. In fact, it was close to a drug that allowed you to use the magical power you had at once. His pride would not allow him to drink such a drug against a commoner.\u2018But if it\u2019s for a sure win.\u2019As long as Rudger is behind Aidan, he may have received something like himself because he\u2019s a dirty commoner.With that in mind, Jevan put the amplification potion into his pocket with a stiff face.Seeing that, Chris laughed.* * *The auditorium of the 2nd training ground was more than half full of people who had come to see the new student\u2019s magic duel today. Most of the first-year students gathered but there were also second-year students and other teachers.If it was simply a fight between first-year students, they would have ignored it, but since it was a match between two teachers, it was a different story.Rudger Chelici and Chris Benimore have just been assigned to Theon and they both have in common that they are in charge of the manifestation class.However, one is a fallen aristocrat, and the other is a noble and even a high count. The difference between them was quite large and Rudger supported the commoners while Chris Benimore supported the nobles.In the end the soon-to-be-scheduled duel transformed into a battle between commoners and aristocrats.\u201cWho will win?\u201d\u201cAre you sure it\u2019s a freshman fight? Then the nobility has an advantage. Commoners are not educated from an early age.\u201d\u201cI heard that this commoner freshman is not weak. They say he made a big contribution during the werewolf incident.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t know but Mr. Rudger trained him.\u201d\u201cIn that sense, there was Mr. Chris on the other side.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know the teacher. Was he in charge of the first year?\u201d\u201cEven though they are both teaching the same manifestation system, it seems that Mr. Rudger is better.\u201dDuring the conversation, people\u2019s eyes turned to the top, where only teachers could sit in the audience.\u201cLook.\u201d\u201cUh. It\u2019s real.\u201dChris Benimore, who had just entered the teacher\u2019s seat, sat down calmly while maintaining his dignity as a nobleman. Because of his intelligent appearance, the adoring eyes of the female students naturally followed Chris. Chris also lightly enjoyed the gazes.At that moment, the murmur of the students grew louder. It was quite different from when Chris showed up.\u2018What?\u2019He looked at who the hell it was, and it was that man, Rudger Chelici. He had long black hair tied in a ponytail, a sharp jawline and a high nose bridge. His cool facial features and deep sunken eyes made many women\u2019s hearts flutter.He wore a black shirt and black trousers with a black tie and even his long coat was black. The overall impression of the black color is reminiscent of a raven. Holding a staff in his right hand, he looked like the head of a prestigious mage family.\u201cWow. Look at Mr. Rudger.\u201d\u201cAre you crazy?\u201dAll eyes of the students, who were distracted by Chris\u2019 appearance, turned to Rudger but Rudger didn\u2019t even care how much attention was drawn to him, and he went to the empty seat of the professor\u2019s lounge and sat down.\u201cSaw that?\u201d\u201cUh. The atmosphere is really not a joke. It\u2019s understandable why the rumors spread like that.\u201d\u201cIs he really a fallen aristocrat? I thought he was nobler than the other noble teachers.\u201dChris, who overheard the students talking like that, smirked and clicked his tongue, not hiding his unpleasant feelings, turned to Rudger, who was sitting in the row next to him.Rudger would probably look around this way, but he was staring at the training ground with a smirk in his eyes that didn\u2019t show what he was thinking. Chris bit his teeth in response as if he didn\u2019t even care about this.\u2018That naughty attitude is now over. I will make you feel defeated in front of everyone.\u2019This fight will be won by Jevan Pellio. Aidan, that commoner? Chris didn\u2019t even know such a student existed. He didn\u2019t even check the list of commoner students.\u2018Anyway, commoners are commoners. Even those who were not properly educated entered the school with preferential treatment.\u2019When he was thinking that, the commotion in the audience reached a climax. Feeling noisier than when Rudger appeared, Chris looked back and he could see why.\u201cPresident, you come.\u201dWhen Elisa Willow appeared, Chris jumped up from her seat and greeted her. The president smiled broadly and accepted Chris\u2019 greeting.\u201cHello sir Chris Benimore. Wow. There are many people here.\u201d\u201cPresident, what are you doing here?\u201d\u201cI heard that something interesting was going on, so I came to see for myself.\u201dThe teachers who followed as if assisting the president were Marie Ross of the Pharmacy department, who is said to have served the longest in Theon, and Hugo Burtag, who leads a faction of noble teachers including Chris.When all the most famous people in Theon gathered, the students expressed their surprise, saying they had no idea that this duel could have been this big.It was the same with Chris. He just thought that the two students would have a simple fight but he didn\u2019t think the president would come forward.\u2018The president had no choice but to come because it was a fight between commoners and aristocratic students?\u2019The president is nominally neutral with no push for either side, but Chris knows that the president values commoner students more than nobles. That was the reason why Hugo had a confrontation with the president in the first place.\u2018Will it be okay?\u2019He was worried about what would happen if the president interfered, but it didn\u2019t seem necessary. The president, who wanted to remain neutral, had no reason to intervene in this matter.\u2018Rudger Chelici.\u2019Even when the president appeared, the man did not look behind him and just sat still. His behavior was cheeky and rude but thinking that it was manly Chris got annoyed.\u201cMr. Rudger! Long time no see!\u201dThe president greeted him with a smile. At that moment, Rudger, who had been still, turned his head to the president. He slowly got up from his seat and bowed to her.\u201cHello President.\u201d\u201cYeah. Hello Mr. Rudger. How have you been?\u201d\u201cI am doing well.\u201d\u201cI was really surprised. All of a sudden, Mr. Rudger and Mr. Chris said that they would like to watch the students compete so I wanted to know what was going on.\u201d\u201cWe were just making a simple bet.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026Who did Mr. Rudger bet will win?\u201dKnowingly, the president asked if she wanted to hear from Rudger directly.\u201cI bet on student Aidan victory.\u201d\u201cBetting doesn\u2019t happen unless you choose the opposite, so Mr. Chris must have been betting on the victory of student Pellio?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Yes.\u201dChris had no choice but to answer reluctantly. The president smiled softly and clapped her hands.\u201cI am really looking forward to it. Of course, the priority is to ensure that the students are not injured, right?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about that. We have put in place as many safeguards as possible.\u201dMarie Ross answered from the side instead. Even if the students competed in an informal match, there was a high possibility of hurting the opponent therefore they wear light protective gear before entering the duel.Metal protective gears that can be worn on the chest, shoulders and both knees resonate with each other and a thin magic barrier is placed over the student\u2019s body in the end the student whose barrier runs out of energy first loses the duel.\u201cThen I\u2019m happy.\u201d\u201cAh, just in time, a player appeared.\u201dThe first to stand in the center of the training ground was Aidan with a very nervous expression. He had a face that looked like he was about to vomit because he wasn\u2019t used to the gazes pouring down like a spotlight on him.\u201cAidan! Go for it!\u201d\u201cBreak his cheeky nose.\u201dPerhaps it was thanks to Tracy and Leo, who cheered for him, Aidan nodded with a more relaxed face and waved his hand toward the audience. Commoner students cheered Aidan in hopes that he would raise the status of the commoners.Then Jevan appeared through the opposite entrance.\u201cJevan, I believe in you!\u201dThe noble students cheered for Jevan who nodded his head with a smile as if he was familiar with this situation. The two stood facing each other and Jevan looked at Aidan with a smirk.\u201cYou didn\u2019t run away?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cAre you nervous? Commoners would not be accustomed to a place like this. If you ran away you would not have suffered a catastrophic defeat in front of everyone.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026If I win.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cApologize to Tracy and Leo.\u201d\u201cWhat? Hahaha!\u201dPerhaps he didn\u2019t know that Aidan would say such a thing here, so Jevan burst into laughter.\u201cYes. If you win, I\u2019ll get down on my knees.\u201d\u201cYou said it.\u201d\u201cBut what should you do after I beat you?\u201dHe was confident as he felt the powerful magic in his body. It was thanks to the magic boosting potion that he drank a while ago before going on stage, an item whose duration is so short that it is unknown whether it has been used or not.There was a condition that the match had to be over within a short time of less than 5 minutes, but with this strength, it seemed that it would not be too difficult.\u2018If the same magic is used the one who has the most magical power wins.\u2019There is nothing more advantageous than the superiority of firepower in a duel between wizards. Even if the same spell is casted at the same speed, it is possible to defeat your opponent with brute force.Before starting the match, the referee checked the status of Aidan and Jevan. This was to verify if any irregularities were involved in the duel. Jevan believed Chris\u2019 words, so he nodded proudly.Eventually, the referee, who was checking Aidan\u2019s condition, saw the object hanging from his waist and widened his eyes.\u201cStudent, what is this?\u201d\u201cAh, this is my staff for this duel.\u201dAidan replied with a smile, but the referee was still puzzled. The staff that Aidan had was basically different from the wands made of unusual materials that wizards deal with, and the shape itself was different, it was in the form of a sword.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 48": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Academy\u2019s Undercover ProfessorCH 48Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayC48: Student Duel (2)The blunt tip and thick blade looked like something for hitting, not cutting. It was closer to changing a magic wand than a sword, so the danger or lethality was close to zero. The referee thought about it for a while and decided it would be okay.\u201cGet ready.\u201dFollowing the referee\u2019s instructions, Aidan and Jevan stood at both ends of the arena. The audience, who had been shouting, shut their mouths and the second training became quiet.In the center, Aidan and Jevan stared at each other with intense eyes.\u201cStart!\u201dAs soon as the referee\u2019s cry fell, the two aimed their wands at each other. The most basic step in a battle between wizards is to analyze the gap between the opponent and oneself first and that is done through the exchange of first-level magic.\u201cPaah!\u201dThe magic that Aidan activated was [Flowing Water], a first-class water element spell. Conversely, the magic that was activated by Jevan was [Stinging Fire], a first-class fire-attribute spell.\u201cThey\u2019re fast.\u201d\u201cIs their speed the same?\u201dThe spells unfolded at the same time. In other words, Aidan, who everyone thought would be at a disadvantage, implemented the spell faster than expected. And there was also a difference in the elements that the two used.Aidan used water and Jevan used fire. There would be no need to ask which attribute is superior.\u2018Yes!\u2019Aidan was happy.In order to have the edge in the first clash, he had to occupy an advantageous position in the attribute. It\u2019s kind of like rock, paper, scissors, and it wasn\u2019t pure luck.\u2018I thought he would definitely use fire-attribute magic.\u2019Jevan has a fiery personality and he expected that the first magic he would use would be the fire since it has the highest attack power.Aidan read the opponent\u2019s magic in advance through psychological warfare and prepared the corresponding magic. Some students would have thought it was just a coincidence, but the teachers were different.\u201cHe is ahead from the start.\u201dNext to the president who spoke happily, Hugo frowned without hiding his discomfort.\u201cThe duel isn\u2019t over yet.\u201dAs Hugo said, it didn\u2019t turn out to be Aidan\u2019s win. When the two magic collided in mid-air, contrary to what people expected, it was the fire that destroyed the water magic.\u201cOh my gosh.\u201d\u201cYou can beat water with fire?\u201d\u201cIs the difference in magic power that big?\u201dNo matter how much a counter exists in an attribute, if the mana is higher, even that counter will be ignored.The flame that quickly evaporated water and it flew towards Aidan before long. Aidan hurriedly bent down to avoid the flying flame while astonished gazes turned to Jevan.\u201cHahaha\u2026This is the difference between you and me, insignificant commoner.\u201dJevan did not stop using his magic while talking.While Aidan evaded, he prepared the next magic. Aidan, who had corrected his posture, also immediately activated his magic. This time Jevan used the lightning attribute while Aidan used fire.The two spells collided and canceled each other out in the air. However, the difference from a while ago was that the place where the magic was offset this time was that it was a little closer towards Aidan.\u201cHahaha!\u201dJevan used magic again, and it was the same with Aidan. Their magic collided in the air again.Aidan knew he was at disadvantage in terms of firepower, so he put in more of his mana and activated his magic. A third crash occurred and it happened right in front of Aidan.\u201cWah!\u201dAidan staggered due to the shock of the magic explosion.\u201cAidan has been pushed!\u201d\u201cIs the difference between nobles and commoners that big?\u201dEveryone was chatting among themselves in the audience.\u2018Chance.\u2019Jevan did not miss the gap where Aidan had collapsed and immediately used the next magic. He was going to use the momentum and put an end to it.Aidan took hold of his stance and tried to point his wand for defense, but immediately changed his judgment.\u2018No. It\u2019s too late to use magic now!\u2019Jevan has already started implementing the technique. Even if he tried to catch up in a hurry here, in the end it all depends on who casts his spell first.If he focused on speed and used a simple spell, there is a high probability that the magic will fail. It\u2019s power is also inferior to the opponent.If he had Rudger\u2019s source code he could use magic to win but he didn\u2019t.\u2018In the first place, it\u2019s impossible right now.\u2019He realized he couldn\u2019t cast a spell so he chose another method.\u2018From here on, I\u2019ll use what I\u2019ve learned from Mr. Rudger.\u2019Instead of using his staff, Aidan rushed towards Jevan.\u201cWhat?!\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s running?\u201d\u201cHas he given up?\u201dMost of the audience thought that Aidan had given up since no normal magician would use his body in the current situation.\u201cIt\u2019s savage. That\u2019s why the common people.\u201d\u201cAidan\u2026\u2026What are you going to do?\u201dWhile everyone despised or felt sorry for him Jevan magic was complete.\u201cIn the end, did you give up because you couldn\u2019t do it?\u201dJevan smiled cruelly and used the second-level magic [Burning Thunder]. It is a very powerful magic among the second-level magic that pierces the opponent\u2019s with a quick lightning strike.Aidan won\u2019t die because there is a safety device on his body, but considering this overflowing magical power right now, he\u2019ll be able to make him feel pain enough to die.Jevan aimed the magic at Aidan\u2019s forehead.\u201cTake it!\u201dJevan thought that Aidan had reached his limit since was running towards him and activated [Burning Thunder]. The yellow current in the air eventually turned into an arrow and flew towards Aidan.Everyone who watched the scene thought the fight was over.\u2018It\u2019s over. In the end, Jevan won.\u2019Chris grinned as he watched the match go by as expected. He had already looked back at Rudger, anticipating what kind of face he would make.\u201c\u2026\u2026What?\u201dRudger was watching the duel with a nonchalant face as if the fight wasn\u2019t over yet. Suddenly, an unfamiliar chill-like anxiety ran down Chris\u2019 spine.\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dChris\u2019 eyes hurriedly turned to the stadium and saw Aidan turning his upper body and heading to the side in a running posture to avoid the magic that flew in front of him.\u201cWow!\u201dThe [Burning Thunder] brushed past Aidan\u2019s cheeks and shoulders. Aidan\u2019s face was slightly distorted because of the pain, but that was all Aidan didn\u2019t stop.Chris was shocked to see the scene. He had noticed how Aidan had evaded the attack.\u2018Even in the midst of that, he didn\u2019t take his eyes off the other person?\u2019Usually, when new students engage in magic battles, those who are not yet accustomed to fighting between wizards may behave like a beginner and look away from the other person, or close their eyes tightly and raise their arms when magic flies towards them, instead of defending properly.When you realize that pain is approaching, your body moves instinctively because that is human nature. There is no way to change that other than to train for a long time. However, Aidan was a freshman who had just entered the school. He was a beginner who didn\u2019t know much about magic.But Aidan was not afraid of the magic flying towards his forehead, and he kept going without averting his gaze. It wasn\u2019t just a matter of luck, he had a will strong enough to overcome pain. It was an action that was possible because he was convinced that he could avoid it.\u2018But it will take time to get up and use magic!\u2019Chris\u2019 judgment was correct. After all, Jevan still had the initiative. As if responding to that will, Jevan took action. When he realized that his attack had missed, he was embarrassed for a moment, but Jevan prepared the next magic right away.\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dHowever, seeing the magic formula created in front of Aidan\u2019s nose, Jevan had no choice but to open his eyes wide. It was the same for Hugo and Marie, and even the president looked with interest.Chris had nothing to say. He immediately recognized the technique Aidan was using.\u201c[Moving-Magus]!\u201dA practical skill that battle wizards learn to cast magic while moving their body.Chris turned his head to look at Rudger. The man who had not taken his eyes off the duel for a while and there was a faint smile on his lips.In a short period of three days, this man taught the commoner the \u201c[Moving-Magus], which is the technique to outperform the opponent in a magic duel.\u2018Did he learn that in 3 days?\u2019Aidan had learned the [Moving-Magus] in just three days?\u2018Are the commoners born with such talent?\u2019Chris didn\u2019t know.While Jevan and he were already intoxicated with the toast of victory, Aidan worked hard while being taught by Rudger.\u2018Jevan! You idiot! Stop the magic!\u2019Chris tried to shout, but the last remaining reason made him shut his mouth. If he shouted here it was like giving instructions to Jevan, that would ruin a fair match, and it would be an act of eroding his image.He had no choice but to hope that Jevan would notice and take a different action.\u2018Wrong.\u2019Chris closed his eyes tightly.Jevan had never expected that Aidan would use magic while running, so he was preparing his next magic. When Aidan evaded his magic, it would have been better if he didn\u2019t continue his next attack. However, his innate ability became a shackle holding his ankles.He quickly reacted to the first anomaly he encountered. There was nothing wrong with that judgment, but Jevan did not respond at all to the fact that the anomaly unfolded twice in a row, not just once.\u201cWhat?\u201dSeeing the completed magic formula in front of Aidan, Jevan realized that things were going strangely. However, he had no way to first complete the spell he was casting now.The magic that Aidan fired was the [Shining Stone] he had practiced so much. It\u2019s a very simple rank 1 spell but it was lethal since Jevan was careless.The shining stone hits the forehead of Jevan.\u201cGreat!\u201dIt wasn\u2019t fatal, but the pain was great. Jevan was dizzy from the shock and his movements became blunt.Everyone stood up in a hurry but Aidan, who had been given the opportunity, was watching silently.\u2018It\u2019s over.\u2019Seeing the scene, Rudger was satisfied. From the moment he lost his composure, Jevan\u2019s defeat was decided. Aidan pointed his staff at Jevan.\u201cNow it\u2019s my turn.\u201d\u201cOh, no!\u201dBut despite all the screams Aidan\u2019s magic, which was immediately activated, hit his body countless times.The moment the total amount of magical power of the armor surrounding the body became 0, the victory or defeat of the match was decided.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Conversely, the noble students were displeased, and stared at Jevan who was on the floor.\u201cThat bastard spoiled the honor of the nobility.\u201d\u201cIt bothered me that he was trying to make moves here and there.\u201d\u201cHe lost to a commoner. It\u2019s a shame for aristocrats.\u201dJevan looked around with a blank expression on his face.\u2018I lost?\u2019He couldn\u2019t believe this was real but when he tried to wake up from the dream, that didn\u2019t happen. Because this wasn\u2019t a dream, it was reality. The hateful gazes and arrows of criticism that were flying towards him were all real.On this stage, it was not him who got the joy of victory, but the insignificant commoner who had been so neglected.\u2018No. There is something wrong!\u2019He couldn\u2019t have lost. Yes. There must have been some mistake. That dirty commoner must have used some cowardly trick otherwise, there would be no way to use magic while moving.\u2018You fucking commoner\u2019s bastard!\u2019The fact that he took a potion before the duel was erased from his mind. All that was left now was his endless hatred for the commoner who insulted him in front of everyone and his will to kill him.\u2018I will kill you!\u2019Jevan started squeezing out all of his magical power. Everyone was focused on Aidan, who was in the spotlight as the winner, so no one noticed Jevan behavior.Who would have known that a man who had been defeated in a fight would suddenly lose his mind and use magic by surprise? Jevan squeezed out all of his own magical power and performed a second-level magic.It takes about 4 seconds for the magic to be formed. It is quite a long time for an opponent to focus on it, but now that everyone wasn\u2019t vigilant, 4 seconds is a very short time.\u201cHuh?\u201dAidan was the first to notice the strangeness. When he just looked around Jevan, his eyes met with Jevan, who was staring at him.\u201cJevan?\u201dHe saw that Jevan used the second-tier fire magic [Raging Wave].Now that the match was over, Aidan had removed the safety device attached to his body. [Raging Wave] is an attack with the widest range among second-tier magic, so it is virtually impossible to avoid.However, it was impossible to defend because time was running out. The magic was manifested and bright red flames fluttered.\u201cHuh?\u201dThe referee, who was trying to check Aidan\u2019s physical condition, was also perplexed. He didn\u2019t even think that Jevan would do something like this, so he hurriedly pulled out his staff and raised his magical powers.He is an employee at Theon, but he can also use magic to some extent but he was too late. The magic was already approaching him.Aidan jumped out like a spring, grabbed the referee\u2019s back, threw him behind and gripped the sword-shaped staff with both hands.In the slow flow of time, he could see the audience widen their eyes in amazement. Even the teachers who realized the situation belatedly rose from their seats one by one but it was already too late for them to step forward because the flame waves were approaching Aidan\u2019s nose.\u201cAidan!\u201dTracy shouts spread out but Aidan did not look back at her. With his gaze fixed in front, he raised his sword-shaped staff and struck.\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dThen the unbelievable happened. Following the trajectory of Aidan\u2019s wand, the [Raging Wave] magic used by Jevan was split in half and scattered.After a while, [Raging Wave] lost its power and disappeared as if it were scattered in the air.\u201cJust now\u2026\u2026What happened?\u201dWhen students mutter blankly at the scene they do not understand. Rudger stared at Aidan as if he knew this.\u2018Did you use that magic because the moment of crisis came?\u2019Aidan is a wizard who can use [Special] type magic. Unlike the other four series, [Special] is not classified properly as modern magic, and is not widely known to the public.[Anti-Magic], one of the [Unusual] series magic, also known as magic that erased other magic, that\u2019s what Aidan was using now.\u201cIt can\u2019t be!\u201dChris was on the brink of a blackout. He couldn\u2019t believe that Aidan could use anti-magic.\u2018I hope that man knows this\u2026\u2026!\u2019Chris\u2019 eyes turned to Rudger. He was not surprised when Aidan was attacked and sat still.He had no reason to be surprised because he knew that Aidan would win this battle and that he was the owner of an [Unusual] type of magic.\u201cOh my God.\u201dIt was the same for Jevan Pellio. He saw the [Raging Wave] that he used with all his magical power disappearing in vain.Aidan strode towards Jevan, who had completely lost his will.\u201cJevan\u2026\u201d\u201cYou, how can you? How could a commoner use such magic\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cOkay. F*ck this.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dBefore Jevan could ask anything, Aidan moved. His clenched fists slammed his cheeks hard. Aidan looked down at the fallen Jevan and said,\u201cI thought you would at least accept your defeat honorably but I didn\u2019t expect you to be such garbage.\u201dJevan didn\u2019t answer because he was already completely defeated by Aidan physically and mentally, and he couldn\u2019t keep his reason.Belatedly, the referee rushed out and checked Aidan\u2019s body.\u201cStudent Aidan! Are you okay?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine. Is the referee okay? Do you have any injuries anywhere?\u201d\u201cNo I don\u2019t. Thank you. Without you, it would have been very dangerous.\u201dThe teachers and the audience who watched the scene had no choice but to check Aidan again.\u201cOh my gosh. He said he was a user of anti-magic, and it was true.\u201dMarie Ross, who had already heard vaguely about Aidan, put her hand on her lips and smiled. On the other hand, Hugo and Chris\u2019 faces were dark. Only Rudger expected this outcome and maintained a consistent attitude.The students\u2019 reaction was very enthusiastic.\u201cDid you just see it? He cut the magic with his sword!\u201d\u201cIdiot. It\u2019s not a sword, it\u2019s a staff.\u201d\u201cEven so, I didn\u2019t feel that he was using magic. What was it?\u201dFor students who were unaware of the existence of anti-magic, Aidan\u2019s performance a while ago was almost like something out of a fairy tale.Among the amazed students, there were some students who realized what Aidan\u2019s magic was.\u201cThat kid. Did he use anti-magic a while ago?\u201dA beautiful girl with pure white hair and an impression as cold as snow stared intently at Aidan. Her words sounded like she was older than Aidan, but she was also one of the freshmen who had just entered Theon.A girl who deserves to be arguably the best among these first-year freshmen. She is the top student with the highest admissions score and a rookie of undisputed talent who is promoted as a promising wizard in the Tower, Julia Plumhart.\u2018I just came to watch for fun but I saw something interesting.\u2019She looked at Aidan with interest. Because of her character, she wouldn\u2019t even have been interested in a duel between students.However, this time, the case became particularly large, and it turned into a battle between commoners and aristocrats rather than students. Even after that, it was said that the fight was for pride between two teachers, so she came to watch.\u2018The first time I fought, I was so miserable and it was hard to keep my eyes open, so I wanted to go back right away.\u2019Others thought Aidan was lucky that she didn\u2019t.\u2018Where did that commoner learn anti-magic? Hmm. I\u2019m a little intrigued.\u2019Julia left the arena as she looked at Aidan who had knocked out Jevan. Besides Julia, there were some people who were interested in the magic that Aidan showed. It was Freuden, the student with the most power in the sophomore year.\u2018Did he say Aidan?\u2019When Baron Pellio wanted to join his faction, Jevan said he would fight. Freuden didn\u2019t bother to stop him. It must have been his true intention but he was not even interested in the first place.No matter who he fights with, he thinks it\u2019s enough if he doesn\u2019t push himself. However, his opponent was a commoner who used anti-magic.\u2018The freshmen are strong this year.\u2019Freuden highly valued Aidan\u2019s anti-magic. Of course, he didn\u2019t know high Aidan mastery was, but his value was at least higher than that of an idiot aristocrat.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dFreuden glanced at the fallen Jevan with a pathetic gaze and got up from his seat. Following Freuden, the students of his faction rose up.Before Freuden left, he glanced at Rudger, who was sitting in the professor\u2019s seat.Freuden, who stared at him for a moment, turned his gaze away as if he was not interested and left the training ground.One by one, people left and talked loudly about the events of the duel.\u201cThis.\u201dAidan scratched his head. He originally had no intention of using anti-magic in this battle. No, he had no intention of using it in the future while he was in Theon.His master told him that this magic was very important and not to use it unless he\u2019s in a crisis or else he\u2019ll be in trouble.\u2018This is what Master said.\u2019Seeing the passionate eyes of the students, Aidan instinctively sensed that his academy life would be really hard in the future.\u2018Ouch.\u2019Aidan immediately turned to the place where the teacher\u2019s seat was. He looked for Rudger, who had helped him win this fight. Fortunately, Rudger remained there, and finding him was not difficult because his black outfit stood out.Rudger had a normal face. He wasn\u2019t particularly or visibly happy that he won the duel. After making eye contact without saying a word Rudger nodded his head.\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dOf course, that alone was enough for Aidan.\u201cAidan!\u201d\u201cGood job! You won!\u201dTracy and Leo approached Aidan and smiled broadly. Aidan looked at his friends and smiled.After watching the three of them for a moment, Rudger stood up. The match is over, now it\u2019s time to look at other things.\u201cMr. Chris.\u201dChris Benimore, who had been sitting uncomfortable all the time, trembled at Rudger\u2019s call.His gaze turned to Rudger.\u201cWe still have business to finish.\u201dAt those words, Chris\u2019 face fell even more horribly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He had offered to bet with Rudger and the loser will hand over one of the magic research papers to the winner.It was Chris himself, no one else, who suggested this. Since he declared in front of many students that he would bet on it, he couldn\u2019t even say no.\u201cDid you know that commoner student possess anti-magic?\u201d\u201cYes. That\u2019s right.\u201dChris cried out with tears in his eyes at the answer that seemed to come in as if it was natural.\u201cDid you make this bet knowing that?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t understand why Mr. Chris is so angry.\u201d\u201cYou say that now\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cMr. Chris, didn\u2019t you know that Aidan was the possessor of anti-magic?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dAt those words, Chris was stunned. It was as Rudger said, he did not know that Aidan possessed anti-magic.\u201cI heard that Mr. Chris is in charge of the first year, but didn\u2019t you check the first-year students who were admitted this time?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cAbove all, Aidan never used anti-magic during the match. Did you see that his mastery of anti-magic had an effect on the victory or defeat of the match?\u201dChris shut his mouth.As Rudger said, Chris was not in a position to dare to argue with the result of the match. The fact that he didn\u2019t know was his fault since he didn\u2019t check the students.Because Aidan was a trivial commoner he was unimportant. The narrow-minded thought he always had turned into a boomerang, and hit him in the back.Who is to blame for that? Rudger who knew but didn\u2019t say it? Aidan who learned anti-magic even though he is a commoner?It was his fault because he made no thorough preparations, and without even thinking of gathering information beforehand, he just assumed that he was going to win. His arrogance was the cause of his defeat.\u201cIf you had checked the students, something like today would not have happened.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dChris didn\u2019t answer. Yes. It was obviously his mistake for not taking the duel seriously.However, what hurts his pride more than that is that the outcome of this match was not determined by the anti-magic. Aidan didn\u2019t even use the anti-magic during the duel. He used only what he had after he came to Theon and defeated Jevan.Seeing Chris trembling and not saying anything, Rudger continued.\u201cI remember that we bet on an academic thesis on magic.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026We did. What can I give you?\u201d\u201cNothing.\u201dChris was perplexed at that.\u201cWhat the heck\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cI am not taking anything.\u201d\u201cWhy all of a sudden\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cNot all of a sudden. This is what I was thinking from the beginning.\u201dChris couldn\u2019t understand Rudger\u2019s words. No, he actually understood but wanted to deny it.\u201cIt is inferior to extort other people\u2019s teachings in bets.\u201dAfter saying those words, Rudger turned his back and left.At that sight, Chris turned into a bewildered person.He wasn\u2019t even this annoyed when he was ignored by him, or when he lost the bet. But even though Rudger won the bet, he did not receive anything from him, but when he said that the act of betting itself was inferior Chris felt more than annoyed, he also felt a sense of disappointment.The mirror of the heart that reflects the ugly side of the man, the more he stared at him with hostility and hatred, the more disgusting he was, and the more it reflected on him.\u2018Me, this Chris Benimore\u2026\u2026Are you saying I\u2019m inferior?\u2019 Chris bit his lip. A stream of blood ran down the corner of his mouth. He didn\u2019t even think to clean it. He was just staring at Rudger\u2019s back with a blood-soaked look in his eyes.\u2018Rudger Chelici.\u2019How much longer do you have to trample on my pride? Next time, for sure, I will pay back the disgrace I suffered this time.\u201cMr. Chris.\u201dHugo approached and called him, but Chris didn\u2019t respond. Now he didn\u2019t want to show anyone this ugly figure, so he hurriedly ran away from his seat.Hugo contorted his face at the sight, but then saw the president looking over and smiling softly, and he couldn\u2019t help but swallow his annoyance. This event will be remembered as a shameful day for the aristocrats.\u2018Rudger Chelici.\u2019Thinking of the man who caused all this Hugo Burtag grimaced inwardly.* * *Aidan, drunk with the joy of victory with his friends, suddenly remembered the promise he had made with Jevan. He staggered his gaze and turned to Jevan, who stood up from.The three of them looked into each other\u2019s eyes and then nodded their heads towards Jevan.\u201cWhat?\u201dJevan looked at Aidan and his friends coming towards him and asked with a weak voice.\u201cYou came to laugh at me?\u201d\u201cJevan, have you forgotten the promise you made before the duel?\u201dAt the word of promise, Jevan\u2019s face wrinkled. He couldn\u2019t even think about it because he couldn\u2019t break free from the shock of defeat.\u201cJevan Pellio politely apologize right now for being harsh to my friends.\u201d\u201cNow, you dare\u2026\u2026Make me apologize?\u201d\u201cYou were the first to place a bet and apply for a duel Jevan. I\u2019m just telling you to keep it. Come on, apologize respectfully.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dJevan clenched his fists tightly, but that was all. He was completely defeated by Aidan and even his surprise attack was unsuccessful. He didn\u2019t just lose, he was totally defeated. There was no place for him to stand in Theon any longer.\u201cDamn it. All because of you! Because of you I\u2026\u2026!\u201d\u201cJevan.\u201d\u201cShut up! Don\u2019t call my name! If it wasn\u2019t for you, I wouldn\u2019t have gone through such an ugly thing in front of everyone! Yes! It\u2019s all your fault!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dSeeing Jevan talking half-dazed, Tracy wanted to say something but Aidan raised his hand and stopped her.\u201cAidan. Why?\u201d\u201cBecause there\u2019s no use going on.\u201dAidan knew that no matter what Tracy said, Jevan wouldn\u2019t listen. Aidan realized something when he saw the behavior that Jevan was showing.He believed that people fight because they don\u2019t know each other, and once they get to know each other, the story will be different.Meanwhile, Jevan cried even more desperately.\u201cDamn it! Damn it! Because of you filthy commoners, I can\u2019t stay in Theon anymore! We, the Pellio family, can\u2019t raise their heads no matter where we go! Because of you! Because of you!\u201dJevan had already erased the foul or cowardly act he had committed from his memory. He simply couldn\u2019t bear it because he was so angry that he had to go through this.\u201cWhy! Why do people like you have such powers? Why don\u2019t I have it?\u201d\u201cJevan.\u201d\u201cDamn it. Damn it I just\u2026\u2026I just wanted to increase the reputation of the family!\u201dJevan bowed his head and screamed. He wouldn\u2019t have stopped if he knew it was the wrong way because he only aimed for that purpose.Aidan looked at Jevan like that and tried to say something, but then shut his mouth. Far from receiving an apology from Jevan in that state, it was difficult to continue a proper conversation.Even Tracy, who would normally be angry, was silent as she saw Jevan that was ruined.To raise the status of the family, she also felt a sensation as if her chest was tightening at the appearance of Jevan acting like that.\u2018Maybe I, too, might have become like that.\u2019When she thought of that, she trembled in fear but at that moment, a cold voice fell between them.\u201cThe match is over, what are you still doing here?\u201d\u201cMr. Rudger.\u201dDressed in an all-black outfit, Rudger exuded a strange atmosphere that could not be resisted. He stared at Aidan and his friends, then slumped down in his seat and fired a cold shot at the crying Jevan.\u201cJevan Pellio, after losing the duel, what are you acting in an unsightly way?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t accept your defeat and even made an ugly surprise attack and then shed tears because it was so unfair? Do you deserve it now?\u201d\u201cMr. Rudger.\u201dAidan called but Rudger continued.\u201cThe way you are now, isn\u2019t it much worse than the commoners you used to hate and despise so much?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026What do you know?\u201dIn the end, Jevan, unable to bear it, jumped up and looked at Rudger.\u201cYou don\u2019t know how I feel!\u201d\u201cShould I know?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026What?\u201d\u201cDo I really need to know that?\u201d\u201cThis person\u2026\u2026!\u201dJevan was about to shout something, but when he met Rudger\u2019s eyes, the burning anger was quickly extinguished, and fear took its place.Rudger\u2019s cold gaze staring at him was like he faced a nightmare in the pitch black darkness.\u201cYou fought at will, and lost at your own bet. You didn\u2019t accept even that but you want others to measure your feelings. Why do I need to know how you feel?\u201d\u201cThat, that\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cDo you think this is still your family? Do I look like a nanny who listens to your complaints?\u201d\u201cI, I\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cYou, who do not know how shameful your actions are, are disqualified as a wizard. What is a noble and what is a wizard?\u201dUnlike the usual Rudger, Jevan couldn\u2019t keep his sanity at the almost violent words.\u201cI, I\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cNoisy. I don\u2019t even want to listen to your excuses. What you did a while ago will be referred to the disciplinary committee, so know that and get out of my sight right now.\u201dJevan, whose complexion had turned pale, backtracked and then fled out of the arena.\u201cAidan.\u201d\u201cYes, teacher.\u201d\u201cYou have successfully used the [Moving-Magus]. Well done.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s all thanks to teacher.\u201d\u201cBut it didn\u2019t look too good.\u201d\u201cThat\u2026\u2026.\u201dAidan couldn\u2019t understand why he was feeling so down. Obviously, in front of everyone, he won the duel brilliantly.\u201cWell\u2026\u2026I do not know.\u201d\u201cYou do not know?\u201d\u201cAt first, obviously, there was a sense of exhilaration. Jevan insulted my friends and argued with me. My desire to defeat all of those things has definitely not changed. But\u2026\u2026After that, it was a problem.\u201d\u201cDid you get swayed by that nonsense?\u201d\u201cObviously I didn\u2019t have to listen to that. Yes. It ignored it.\u201dAidan smiled bitterly and spoke frankly.Rudger looked at Aidan without a word. He knew from before that Aidan was overly just and had the right values, but he didn\u2019t expect his heart to be this weak.He had sympathy for even Jevan, who had been ignoring and looking down on him. Aidan is a young student who is part of the brilliant world called Theon. He was young he couldn\u2019t blame him for being stupid or stuffy because that was the way a child looked at the world.\u201cAidan.\u201d\u201cTeacher.\u201d\u201cAs you go through life, you will run into various people.\u201d\u201cYeah?\u201d\u201cNot everyone is like you. Some people will hate you and even be hostile to you. In the end, that\u2019s it. Your world is different from others.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Is that so.\u201d\u201cBut it depends on how you behave.\u201dAt those words, Aidan, Tracy, and Leo looked at Rudger slightly surprised.\u201cThere is nothing wrong with trying to take care of yourself and it\u2019s not stupid to give up everything you have but in the end, all you need to live in this world is moderation.\u201d\u201cAppropriate\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cAidan\u2019s selfishness and altruism are about half and half. If I yield half instead of taking half to someone the day will come when we will understand each other to some extent.\u201dWith that said, Aidan turned to Tracy. He clearly remembers his first meeting with her and that she wasn\u2019t all that good. Tracy was like a rose full of thorns; however, from a certain moment, the two became attached to each other.\u201cI will not tell you not to yield to anyone or not to be considerate because that is impossible. I\u2019m saying that it\u2019s okay to be at least half selfish.\u201dAt those words, Aidan felt as if he was about to catch something.\u201cI talked too much. I\u2019ll go now.\u201d\u201cMr. Rudger!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI will definitely remember what\u00a0 you said.\u201dRudger glanced back at Aidan, who answered with a determined face, and then left the arena with a light nod of his head.The three of them stared at Rudger\u2019s back without saying a word until he disappeared.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She looked around her for a moment, making sure there weren\u2019t any witnesses, and then she opened her mouth.\u201cCongratulations on winning the bet.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cAre you alright? Could it be that this incident drew too much attention from within the academy? The other members are also concerned.\u201dThat was the part that Sedina was concerned about since Rudger is hiding in Theon with a false identity. However, his recent move attracted too much Theon\u2019s attention.If this happens, no matter what he does, a gaze will follow, and it will cause a significant disruption to the ranks.Rudger shook his head at that concern.\u201cI was prepared for this to happen.\u201d\u201cYou were prepared\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cSedina, do you know about the president of Theon?\u201dSedina immediately nodded her head when Rudger mentioned the president.\u201cYeah, her name is Elisa Willow.

She is suspicious of me now.\u201d\u201cMr. Rudger\u2026\u2026Are you saying?\u201d\u201cThe president noticed that our people have been hiding in Theon and even teachers are suspected.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cI need to shake off that doubt now otherwise it would be impossible for me to contact other members, but it is inevitable.\u201d\u201cYou did this to lessen her doubts\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cIt was something I had to do. If you build my credibility in Theon with this event the president\u2019s doubts of me will lessen.\u201d\u201cSo it was like that!\u201dSedina believed Rudger\u2019s every word.In fact, it was not entirely a lie. The reason Rudger showed off his prominence was because he had the intention to impress the president. However, as Sedina said, there was the concern that Rudger might be receiving too much attention.\u2018Yes! After all, there\u2019s no way Mr. Rudger would have done that!\u2019She trusted Rudger and she wanted to believe in him since he was the first person who listened to her. Suspecting such a person felt like committing a sin that could not be washed away.\u201cSedina, do your best as a student for now.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cYes. Among the members, you are the only one who has easy contact with me. I am a teacher and you are a student. No one would doubt it just because we met and talked. I can\u2019t meet other members easily.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cShow yourself as a good student. The more you do that, the less suspicious they will be.\u201d\u201cI see!\u201d\u201cThis is our job, to adapt to our status through our position.\u201d\u201cWe, just the two of us\u2026\u2026mission.\u201dSedina\u2019s eyes widened when Rudger wrote the word \u2018we\u2019. Seeing that, Rudger thought he was lucky.\u2018If I have explained it this far, it will be enough for her.\u2019Although he was engrossed in being a Theon\u2019s instructor and worked hard, Rudger never overlooked the existence of the Black Dawn for even a moment.First of all, nominally, he is an executive with the title of First Order of the Black Dawn. The problem is that Rudger still doesn\u2019t know what he infiltrated to do as an executive. All he learned by analyzing the cipher text was to infiltrate and erase any suspicions Theon might have on him.\u2018Is there a plan in motion or will I receive new orders based on the situation in the future?\u2019Rudger didn\u2019t know that and he couldn\u2019t even ask Sedina. How would she know executive level information?\u2018In the end, I\u2019ll have to figure it out on my own.\u2019It was most likely that the order was given directly by the Zero Order, or that other First Orders shared the work.The only way to figure that out is to find another First Order that is hiding somewhere in Theon. However, in a situation where the First Order could not be found, Rudger had to act while clearing the Black Dawn\u2019s suspicions as much as possible. So he intentionally moved more zealously as a teacher.\u2018It is true that the president doubts me, and it is also true that it takes time to clear the president\u2019s doubts. If I use this as an excuse, at least I will be able to calm the growing dissatisfaction of the secret society.\u2019And using this as an excuse, it was possible to further extend the given deadline. In fact, even though he had only explained this, Sedina immediately seemed to be convinced.\u2018No. She only praised the First Order, so I can\u2019t use it as a fair example.\u2019If Sedina came forward and explained to the others, it would be much more comfortable for Rudger. In fact, Sedina was already full of thoughts about what Rudger said.\u2018As expected of Mr. Rudger! We were worried that something was going to happen, but he had an idea!\u2019Because of her social status Sedina has been bullied within the organization as well, but recently she\u2019s been acting like she\u2019s almost Rudger\u2019s subordinate, so other members have stopped touching her. Thanks to that Sedina looks up to Rudger even more.\u2018You\u2019re even worried about people like me, so you\u2019re giving me such precious advice! That\u2019s amazing!\u2019As Rudger had said so far, she decided that she would obey his orders, even if she had to die.\u201cExplain it well to the others.\u201d\u201cYeah! Just leave it to me!\u201d\u201cOh, and\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cYeah! Do you have anything else to say?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026No, I\u2019m done. Next time we meet I hope to see a more dignified you than before.\u201dAt Rudger\u2019s last compliment, Sedina felt a tingling, electric shock run through her body.\u201cEven if it means dying, I will do it!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t die.\u201d\u201cYeah! Even if I die, I will not die!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Yes. Leave.\u201dAfter finishing with Sedina, who became more and more burdensome every time he saw her, Rudger left.* * *After returning to his private quarters, he went into his room and briefly summarized the things he had to do in the future.\u2018First, through this open competition, I was able to reduce the doubts of the president\u2019s faction on a large scale. I don\u2019t know how the president herself will take it, but she will have a hard time dealing with me because of her position.\u2019Right now, the president\u2019s faction seems to be more dominant, but the aristocratic faction led by Hugo couldn\u2019t be underestimated either.First of all, the one with the greatest power among students Freuden\u2019s factions, where nobles gather and Hugo along with the other aristocratic teachers joined hands with him.Right now, the power of the president seems strong, but if they properly oppose the will of the president, it will be difficult for the president to make decisions.\u2018I attracted a lot of attention but I\u2019m a Black Dawn executive so I can\u2019t act hastily. People from the secret society won\u2019t even try to touch me.\u2019In other words, I was granted immunity from the Black Dawn for a period of time. So let\u2019s put the Black Dawn thing aside for now.Thanks to this duel I have become completely hostile to Hugo\u2019s faction but I don\u2019t really care about this. I\u2019m going to quit after 2 years anyway. Just because they hate me the noble teachers won\u2019t cause any major problems.It\u2019s a bit unpleasant but compared to all the human groups I\u2019ve been through in my life, this is a small problem. Above all, through the duel today, I saw a kind of possibility.\u2018Aidan. I\u2019ve felt it before, but he\u2019s definitely a good guy. He has a decent sense of humor, he has a moderately good side, and he\u2019s hard-working.\u2019It is simply surprising that he learned the [Moving-Magus] in three days. Is it talent or effort that is close to obsessiveness? Considering that it is not possible to fully master the [Moving-Magus] just by using your head well, it may have been the innate ability to use the body.When he split Jevan\u2019s surprise attack with anti-magic he clearly looked like a person who trained with the sword for a long time. Considering that, Aidan was highly likely to stand out in actual combat.I was able to infer it sufficiently because I had met a wizard who was presumed to be Aidan\u2019s teacher. The posture that Aidan showed only once was very similar to the swordsmanship that he used. He lived alone all his life and I thought he was going to die alone but he put one of his pupils in the field.\u2018If it\u2019s Aidan, the possessor of anti-magic, he\u2019ll rise to a considerable position in Theon at the very least.\u2019I finished a simple calculation in my head.I\u2019ll use Theon and some special students to fight against the secret society, Black Dawn. Since I\u2019m with a foot on both sides, what I need the most is to relieve the pressure on me and Black Dawn is the most annoying.If I reduce the power of those who exist in the academy I\u2019ll have more time to plan for the future.\u2018The probability that I will live will increase a lot.\u2019Aidan, Leo, and Tracy abilities are worth investing in. If I only look at the talents I have, maybe even among first-year students, I can count them on my hands and if I add Rene who has good judgment my chances will increase.\u2018Not bad.\u2019Of course, this may not be enough. So, it seems that I need to find more people, in case of unexpected situations.If I make them collide, Theon will become chaotic and my chances to live will increase.\u2018This is the only way. I need to develop my own strength.\u2019In my current situation I\u2019m an individual under pressure from both organizations. Simply weakening both groups cannot be a fundamental solution to this situation.\u2018I also have to create my own organization.\u2019In fact, I prefer to move alone. However, since I needed to stay in the Empire for a long time, I could no longer remain alone.In addition to Hans, I need to call in the guys I\u2019ve had a relationship with before and create a new organization. That organization will become my strength, and that strength makes me able to resist the forces that oppress me.Just when I was thinking of him, the crystal ball I had left in my room started to twinkle.\u201cHans, what\u2019s going on?\u201d[As brother ordered, I checked everything around.]Is it because of that?\u201cConsidering your skills, you must have obtained as much information as you needed. Still, it takes strength to contact me separately.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. From now on, it\u2019s a time when \u2018weakness\u2019 is needed. You know your brother too.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t even want it in the first place.\u201d\u201cAnyway, the only thing left now is your help.\u201d\u201cIt is.\u201dI got up, put on my black long coat for going out, and put a gentleman\u2019s hat on my head.\u201cWhen are you coming? I think it should be done by the weekend at the latest.\u201d\u201cRight now.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dPerhaps he didn\u2019t know that I was going to go right away, and an exclamation filled with bewilderment could be heard from beyond the crystal ball.\u201cIsn\u2019t it better to deal with it quickly?\u201d\u201c..\u2026Are you okay? You must be busy.\u201d\u201cIt will be over soon anyway.\u201d\u201cHow are you sure about that?\u201d\u201cBecause I will make it that way.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 52": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Academy\u2019s Undercover ProfessorCH 52Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayC52: James Moriarty (2)The air circling in the back alleys of Leathervelk is cold enough to make your skin ache. In that dark space, Hans leaned his back against the wall and lifted his head.\u2018It\u2019s too high.\u2019Although Hans boasted that he had visited many cities and had seen many things, Leathervelk, the metropolis of the Empire, was taller than any city he had ever seen.Even this shabby back alley where he stands it\u2019s like a prison made of bricks and brass.\u2018Shall I carry that wire hook or something like brother later?\u2019If he had such a thing, it seemed that it would be easy to escape at a dangerous moment in Leathervelk. Of course, the biggest reason is because when Rudger chased the werewolf he looked cool.At that moment, the darkness trembled over the alleyway and the shadows wriggled. It was a surprising sight, as if a ghost had appeared, but Hans, who had his back from the wall, folded his collar and greeted him.\u201cAre you here?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dOver time, the shadow changed its form and took on a human form. A black Inverness coat with a cloak over the shoulders and a black leather glove in hand holding a gold and black staff appeared.Unlike usual, he was wearing a silk hat with his hair completely untied. That alone made Rudger\u2019s impression completely different.\u201cWhat is the situation?\u201d\u201cFirst let me tell you what I found out. Our hideout is in a back alley, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cYes it is.\u201d\u201cOf course, there are several dark gangs in the vicinity dividing the territory.\u201dHans summarized the information he had obtained and gave it to Rudger. In the first place, the reason I worked hard over the past few days was to check this out.\u201cThey are divided into four major groups, one large that is the strongest of them all, and three other medium-sized ones.\u201d\u201cA total of four? It\u2019s a big city, so it\u2019s a bit crowded.\u201d\u201cFirst, I will explain the medium groups. First of all, there is a circus troupe created by the disabled or marginalized.\u201d\u201cCircus?\u201d\u201cBecause in a city like this, it\u2019s essential to make a living with decent skill. This circus troupe, Circus, is a union of such people and a kind of gang.\u201dRudger nodded his head in agreement.\u201cWhat about the others?\u201d\u201cThe next place is made up of only women. No matter which city you go to, it is a place you cannot miss.\u201d\u201cA brothel.\u201dWithout a hint, Rudger got it right.Ordinary people would express discomfort or displeasure just by thinking of that word, but in a back alley like this, it was a place that could never be missed. Even on Earth in the 21st century, such a place has always existed.\u201cThey are weak alone so they depend on the organization. Besides, they are also reaching out to various businesses in the city. People said that they share the pattern of a tiny black rose to confirm that they are members of their own organization, so they called them Black Rose Women.\u201d\u201cBlack Rose Women.\u201dRudger muttered the name.\u201cThe last one?\u201d\u201cFinally, it is a combination created by children and the elderly. People who are old and unable to work properly, but full of know-how and experience, and children who are still young but jump into the front line to make money.\u201dRudger nodded. In fact, working as a labor force at a young age was a common sight in this world because if he walks around the streets right now, it\u2019s full of kids selling newspapers.Other than that, there are children who are pickpocketing, or children who are in charge of house chores. The worst of them would be working in factories or mines without adequate rest.\u201cThey say that this place where old people and children gather is called Old Kids. It is said that they also focus on gathering information, making them a match for the Black Rose Women.\u201d\u201cBecause children hear a lot.\u201dTo summarize the information Hans gave me, it was as follows. A circus, the Black Rose Women brothel, the labor union of the elderly and children called Old Kids and all three were medium sized forces.\u201cNow there is only the big guy left.\u201d\u201cThe Red Society, the back alley gang.\u201d\u201cI think I\u2019ve heard the name.\u201d\u201cThese are the people who run the back alleys of Leathervelk. Kidnapping, intimidation, drug distribution, the liquor industry, work that requires a fist, and more, there is very little of the dirty work that they have not touched.\u201dWhat if the first three organizations were created by chance because they came together to survive?The Red Society was literally the shadow of the world, and it was an inevitable existence created by the gathering of insects attracted by its stench.\u201cThis back alley is maintained in a state of balance between the Red Society and the other three organizations. It\u2019s very likely that the Red Society is fighting against the other three.\u201d\u201cThe one that needs to be dealt with is the Red Society.\u201d\u201cRight. In the first place, the other three organizations don\u2019t even respond if they don\u2019t touch them directly. In fact, the risk itself is low. But\u2026\u2026Red Society is different.\u201d\u201cYes, they will subdue all the little ones and put them under them or crush them.\u201d\u201cBe careful. They are quite powerful and it will be difficult to subdue them. Recently, the eyes of the Red Society were watching our hideout. So, start with the tail, one step at a time\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cNo, we don\u2019t have to catch the tail first, it\u2019s a waste of time.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cWe hit the head, then the rest of the guys will figure it out.\u201d\u201cBut how do you\u2026\u2026.\u201dSeeing Hans bewildered, Rudger grinned.\u201cOf course it\u2019s a head-on breakthrough.\u201dFor that reason, he has purposely tailored his clothes like this.For that reason, I have purposely tailored my clothes like this.Hans was going to tell him not to be crazy, but when he realized that Rudger was saying that, he finally raised the white flag.Rudger will do what he says and he will succeed because he\u2019s always been like that.\u201cAre you going to use that identity this time? A self-proclaimed crime consultant, a tycoon in the underworld?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dRudger answered and put on a gold monocle that could only be worn on one eye.His usual sharp and cold soldier-like appearance was erased at once. Instead, what appeared was a man with the impression that he was intelligent and quiet, but was like a poisonous snake.James Moriarty was one of his past identities that Rudger would use this time.\u201cAre you really planning to break through the front?\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cIt is because the atmosphere of the Red Society is quite ugly right now. Unsurprisingly, the members of the organization gathered with their blades standing up.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s ugly. I think I know why.\u201d\u201cHow does your brother know that?\u201dHans was intrigued when Rudger replied that he knew what he had not yet figured out.\u201cThe death of the rich man, Bellbot Rickson is probably why the Red Society is in trouble now.\u201d\u201cThe death of Bellbot Rickson and what are they \u2026\u2026Ah!\u201d\u201cI guess you noticed.\u201dHans\u2019s face became more serious as the question was resolved.\u201cI think there must have been some kind of connection between Bellbot Rickson and the Red Society.\u201d\u201cYes, Bellbot Rickson was notorious for doing a lot of dirty work before. A mysterious case of a competing businessman, or a fire in a shanty town opposing the construction of a factory, etc. Could such a person have done all of these things on his own?\u201d\u201cSo the Red Society was doing Bellbot\u2019s dirty work.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cI guess the rich need someone to do their dirty work.\u201d\u201cHans, now that Bellbot Rickson is dead, the Red Society must be quite heated as their biggest source of funding is gone. For now, they will be quiet, but sooner or later they will move to make up for the lack of money.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026I guess that\u2019s the reason they\u2019re gathering. No wait. If that\u2019s the case, aren\u2019t you actually the main culprit?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dAt Rudger\u2019s cool answer, Hans\u2019 expression became puzzled. Actually, the Red Society was very angry because Rudger killed Bellbot Rickson. Of course, they don\u2019t even know that Rudger killed him, so can they call him enemy?\u201cAnd now is the right time to say the least. People who normally would have been scattered are gathered in one place for a long time.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Are you really going to do it?\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cWell, brother is a magician, so even if a few gangsters attack you, you\u2019ll be fine, but the problem is that the Red Society isn\u2019t an ordinary gang either.\u201d\u201cNot normal?\u201d\u201cArmed with all kinds of weapons\u2026\u2026Well, bullets don\u2019t go out in front of wizards, so even so, there\u2019s a mix of swordsmen among them.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201d\u201cThose who tried to become knights, but failed due to money or personality problems, or those with thick bones due to mercenary work. There are many such people in the Red Society.\u201d\u201cThey have quasi-knights, right?\u201dWhen you think of a knight on Earth, you think of an old-fashioned armored swordsman, but that\u2019s not the case here. A knight is a superhuman, those with extraordinary physical ability to deflect even flying bullets with only a weapon in their hand.They have been rivals with each other for a long time, so the most difficult opponent to deal with as a wizard is a knight. Those who deal with Aura will cut through or break through any magic so Hans wanted to take the safe route, even if it took a little bit of time.\u201cThat\u2019s fun.\u201dBut Rudger smiled.Hans knew he had heard something wrong.\u201cBrother, are you really going even after this?\u201d\u201cIs there any reason not to go?\u201d\u201cThere are quasi-knights!\u201d\u201cA quasi knight is only a quasi knight, not a real knight. Hans, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re familiar with it, but there\u2019s a big difference between a quasi-knight and a real one and the difference is even bigger when you compare them with those that have high ranks.\u201d\u201cNo, I don\u2019t mean to say that now\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cFully fledged knights might make a difference but quasi-knights are insignificant.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dAt Rudger\u2019s confident tone, Hans kept his mouth shut and thought seriously, \u2018Is that so?\u2019There was nothing particularly wrong with Rudger\u2019s words. The difference between a quasi-knight and a regular one was actually huge, they are even weaker than apprentice knights who wait by the side of the knights.\u201c\u2026\u2026At first glance, it seems like that?\u201dCome to think of it, he was too pessimistic. He was afraid only because they had the work knight in their name. Hans, thinking that his worries were too much, nodded his head.\u201cWell, if that\u2019s what brother said.\u201dOf course, that was Hans\u2019s big mistake. It is true that a quasi-knight is weak compared to a regular knight or an apprentice knight, but it is not that weak. Although there was a difference, it could not be called decisive.Even quasi-knights, they are capable of plucking the opponent\u2019s throat with just a spoon. For the people of the other world here, that alone would be close to a wall they couldn\u2019t resist.Rudger knew about it, he hid it from Hans because even if Hans knew, he would have attacked the Red Society. In that case, it would be more convenient for Hans to follow without knowing what he was doing.\u201cTake it.\u201dRudger threw something at Hans. Hans caught it and immediately went to check it.\u201cI need your help.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Are you serious?\u201dWhat Rudger threw at Hans was a wolf\u2019s tooth.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 53": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Academy\u2019s Undercover ProfessorCH 53Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayC53: James Moriarty (3)Hans didn\u2019t bother to ask why Rudger gave him the wolf\u2019s tooth. It was because he was the one who knew his constitution better than anyone else.\u201cEven so, if I go alone, the atmosphere doesn\u2019t live up to me. I need you to wreak havoc in the back.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026After fighting we will run right away.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about that part.\u201d\u201cHaa.\u201dHans sighed, took the wolf\u2019s teeth in his hands, and thrust it into the palm of his hand until it bled. Immediately afterward, black hair began to grow on Hans\u2019 body, starting from the wolf\u2019s teeth.When the gene contained in the wolf\u2019s teeth entered his skin and came into contact with his blood, the constitution in which the factors of the beast were expressed was activated.With the sound of his bones twisting, Hans\u2019s size grew almost 1.5 times larger than usual. Before long, Hans was a werewolf with dark fur, wearing an almost exploding robe.Hans carefully took off his top, noticing that his clothes were stuffy, and carefully placed it nearby.\u201cAre you okay?\u201d\u201cHmm. Not bad. I thought I was not going to even need pants\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Look at that.\u201d\u201cYes. I have to understand that part.\u201dIf the transformation was later released, and Hans were to take off his pants, there could be nothing more terrifying than that.Hans sighed in relief.\u201cI guess that\u2019s good.\u201d\u201cHmm. The size isn\u2019t bad either. After all, the shape changes depending on which animal\u2019s teeth are used.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Well, that\u2019s something that I had no choice but to know from experiences so diverse that I\u2019m sick of.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry. If I could get it, I wanted to keep the teeth of a bear or a tiger.\u201dHans doesn\u2019t have to be bitten directly by the beast. His constitution is activated only when the beast\u2019s factor enters inside his body.\u201cStill, this wolf\u2019s teeth looks particularly great, right?\u201dHans looked around himself and said so. Hans changed into various forms, so I could feel how special he is now. His body was full of strength, and his muscles were 1.5 times thicker than usual, it was obvious that this was no ordinary wolf tooth.\u201cIt is the teeth of the Black Fang that exists in the North Continent.\u201d\u201cThose beasts are so ferocious, no wonder. I felt that I had more energy than usual.\u201d\u201cCompared to anything you have changed so far, you can be confident that this is at the top of the list. Of course, if you use the \u2018it\u2019 you can become stronger than anyone else.\u201dAt the word \u2018it\u2019 that came out of Rudger\u2019s mouth, Hans\u2019s face frowned to the point of being unrecognizable, even though he was in a wolf\u2019s state.\u201cBrother if I use something dangerous like that and make a mistake, I might be eaten by the wild.\u201d\u201cBecause you didn\u2019t know, I passed it on to you to keep it. I don\u2019t know how the world will change but if your life is in danger, use it. It would be better than dying.\u201d\u201cIt is but\u2026\u2026.\u201dHans remembered that huge molar. The tooth was so large that it was sharpened and made into the shape of a dagger. It was a special gift from Rudger for Hans. Hans, who thinks that his constitution is a curse, was reluctant to keep that tooth.\u201cThen shall we go?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll say it again, after the fight, I\u2019ll run right away.\u201d\u201cYou just need to set the mood. I\u2019ll go in first, so when I give you the signal, follow me.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dRudger, dressed in black, and Hans, who became a black beast, immediately disappeared as if melting into the darkness of the alley.* * *Located on the outskirts of downtown Leathervelk, Forges Street is famous for its many shops, restaurants and music venues. Also, in some areas, there were workshops for making power devices made of mechanical windings, so it was a place where not only adults but also children actively visited.In the deep part of Forges Street was the boundary between the bright outside of the city and the back alley. In a large pub that everyone knows, men with bad characters gathered instead of customers, maintaining an uncomfortable atmosphere.\u201cDamn!\u201dAmong them was a red-haired man who swore and drank a bottle of wine. His physique was nothing special compared to others whose muscles were plump, but his face was. Having grown his sideburns for a long time, he had a large scar that crossed one of his eyes, which made his ugliness unique.When he got annoyed, the subordinates around him noticed immediately. At that time, his subordinate, who was acting as an advisor, plucked up the courage to step out.\u201cBrother, are you okay?\u201d\u201cDo I look okay?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026To be honest, it\u2019s hard to say.\u201dThe man was the leader of the Red Society, the red snake Dutri.In a way, it was natural for him to be angry now. This is because Bellbot Rickson, who can be said to be the biggest source of funds for the Red Society, died suddenly.From the point of view of Dutri, who was best friends with Bellbot and built the Red Society with its prestige on his back, one of the large pillars that supported him collapsed.There are still a few more pillars to help them, but the problem is that before Bellbot Rickson\u2019s death, the Red Society had invested huge sums in his business. It is a self-evident fact that the manager of the project has died and all of his wealth scattered.Most investors will share it, but it was difficult to recover the invested capital from the point of view of Dutri, who spent a large amount of money.There would be no chance that the Red Society would be destroyed by such a thing, but it was inevitable that the atmosphere would be disturbed.\u201cBut it\u2019s still worth it, so why not find a new way?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why I called you guys here. I think we will have to expand our business in the near future.\u201dBusiness expansion will be a work that involves blood and violence. Maybe they\u2019ll have to fight another organization but no one was concerned about it. They were the best in Leathervelk back alley when it came to their armed forces.\u201cOnce I took some black rose bitches and pressed them\u2026.\u201dWhen Dutri murmurs like that the door to the bar creaked open and a man walked in.\u201cOh?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dAt first, he thought he was a late member of the organization, but he had no choice but to change his mind because the man was too neat to be considered a member of the Red Society.With a black Inverness coat and a cane held in his hand together with the black silk hat on his head and the monocle on one eye he looked like a rich gentleman.\u201cWhat is that bastard? Hey, don\u2019t you know that the store is closed?\u201dDutri glared at the uninvited guest with a drunken face.The man took an empty chair near him and sat down in the center of the bar, as if he heard nothing. The figure of him sitting with his legs slightly apart, supporting the staff with his two hands, was filled with a strange dignity that was difficult to describe in words.\u201cAre you crazy?\u201dAll members of the Red Society stared at the uninvited guest.After emptying the bottle, Dutri jumped up from his seat.\u201cWho are you?\u201d\u201cDutri, leader of the Red Society, am I right?\u201d\u201cYes, but I haven\u2019t seen your face in these places.\u201dDutri smirked as if it was absurd.\u201cHuh. You came here alone, knowing that we were the Red Society?\u201dEven with the gaze from all directions, the man was confident without showing any fear. Dutri felt a strange sense of insecurity at the sight since the man didn\u2019t appear to be bluffing.He has been fighting for a long time in the back alley, and he has been able to distinguish between the pretentiousness of an incompetent person and the daring of a truly talented person. The human in front of him was the latter.\u2018The clothes he is wearing look luxurious, and the atmosphere itself is unusual. Did this person come to me?\u2019Dutri thought he needed to hear the other party first.\u201cHmm. Why the hell did you come to me?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve been in the city so I am trying to start a new business.\u201d\u201cAh! Business! It\u2019s good! You have found the right person.\u201dDutri clapped his hands in joy. This man was talking about business, but there was nobody here who didn\u2019t know it was dirty money and even dirty work.Judging from what he came to know about, this man must have been of the same sort as Bellbot Rickson, a wealthy merchant with a lot of money and a dark heart.\u2018It\u2019s a money line that I must grab!\u2019But Dutri was not hastily pleased, he knew that he couldn\u2019t believe someone he just met.If you don\u2019t know someone, you never trust them. Even if you know your partner, you only believe in half. Betray first before being betrayed that was the way and discipline of people living in the back alley.\u201cSo, what is your name?\u201dAt Dutri\u2019s question, the man said in a soft tone.\u201cMy name is James Moriarty.\u201d\u201cJames Moriarty?\u201dDutri was puzzled by the name and felt something daunting.\u2018I think I\u2019ve heard the name before, but I don\u2019t really remember much.\u2019Then his lieutenant and advisor, his right arm, noticed something and hurriedly approached Dutri and whispered to him.\u2018James Moriarty! It\u2019s that man.\u2019\u2018Who is he?\u2019\u2018A tycoon who once ruled the dark world of the Delica Kingdom.\u2019\u2018Ah.\u2019Dutri could barely recall a name at those words.James Moriarty, he called himself professor and was a notorious crime consultant in the dark world. Delica, the iron kingdom, has made remarkable progress in the steel industry and it was this man that ruled the darkness there and stood right under the light. He was famous enough to be considered half-legendary in this field.\u2018But is that true?\u2019Dutri was suspicious since Professor Moriarty disappeared from Delica several years ago. Rumor has it that he was brought to an end by a detective from a famous aristocratic family.Some say that he was captured and rotted in the deep dungeons of Delica, others that he chose to die before being captured otherwise there would be no news for years. Perhaps there was a possibility that this Professor Moriarty in front of him was a fake.\u2018Well, maybe I should check it out.\u2019Dutri sighed and waved at his subordinate.\u201cProfessor Moriarty, I\u2019ve heard your name a lot.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m glad you know me.\u201d\u201c Whether Professor Moriarty is real or not is a bit vague.\u201d\u201cDo you think I am an impersonator?\u201d\u201cSomeone who had suddenly disappeared a few years ago suddenly appeared in front of me like this.\u201dMoriarty glanced around at the men who took their weapons from their waists. The smell of cheap gunpowder, gently irritating the tip of his nose, convinced him of the fact that the Red Society is a fairly large organization since they have access to guns.\u201cI warn you of one thing.\u201d\u201cTell me.\u201d\u201cI recommend not pulling out a gun if you can.\u201dMoriarty immediately raised his right hand. At the same time, countless subordinates around the area pulled out their guns and aimed at him.\u201cIf you do anything suspicious, you will become a beehive.\u201dMoriarty was not at all intimidated.Dutri began to wonder if the man in front of him was the real deal.\u201cIt\u2019s quite noisy.\u201dAt Moriarty\u2019s provocation some of the younger members of the gang looked at Dutri and asked if they should shoot.Dutri pondered for a moment, and then gently nodded.Recognizing the signal, the subordinate slowly pulled the trigger of the gun in his hand and aimed for the shoulder, not the head but no bullets went out.\u201cUh, huh?\u201dIt wasn\u2019t just that. The guns of all the gang members gathered in the pub right now were useless.\u201cThat\u2019s why I warned you.\u201dMoriarty laughed quietly amidst the perplexing situation.\u201cDon\u2019t pull out your gun.\u201d\u201cWizard!\u201dDutri realized why all the guns had suddenly stopped working. It was clear that this was the magic [silence of fire] used by wizards. That said, it is clear that this man in front of him was a wizard even if he doesn\u2019t know anything else.At that moment, Moriarty whistled. When the sound echoed through the bar and spread outside the door of the bar was smashed and a giant came in.\u201cUgh!\u201d\u201cWhat the hell is that?\u201dIt was a giant wolf that walked on two legs. He was covered in black fur all over his body, had a huge figure that looked over 2.5m tall and even sharp claws that grew on both arms. Everyone was aware of the werewolf incident that had created an uproar in Leathervelk.The werewolf slowly entered the bar and stopped behind Moriarty as if to protect him.Dutri immediately changed his stance at the sight.\u201cIt seems you are the real deal.\u201d\u201cIs this enough proof?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s enough.\u201d\u201cThen we can have a serious conversation now.\u201d\u201cYes. What kind of business do you want to start? What do you need?\u201d\u201cBefore that, I have something to tell you.\u201d\u201cSomething to tell me?\u201dAt Moriarty\u2019s words, Dutri\u2019s eyes widened.\u201cI don\u2019t like dirty things.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d \u201cWhat that means is that the Red Society will disappear from Leathervelk as of today.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 54": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Academy\u2019s Undercover ProfessorCH 54Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayC54: Red Snake in the Mud (1)Dutri immediately grasped the situation.\u201cKill them!\u201dDutri\u2019s orders were swift. If Moriarty came to get rid of them, there was no answer other than a deal or a big fight.At the command, his men moved. They threw away the gun that didn\u2019t work, pulled out a dagger in their hand, and grabbed it; however, the flow was not so good.\u201cHey ah ah ah!\u201d\u201cDie!\u201dBut the opponent is a wizard and the moment you hesitate you will die.If they rush from all directions at once, they might have a chance to win because Moriarty was sitting in the middle of the pub with the black werewolf behind him.Seeing close to 100 people rushing towards them Hans asked with his eyes \u2018What are you going to do now?\u2019Rudger did not answer Hans\u2019 question, instead, he acted.Rudger lifted the staff he was holding in his hand and struck it lightly on the ground. At that moment, shadows began to flow around the staff and spread throughout the pub.\u201cUh, huh?\u201d\u201cWhat is this?\u201dThe members of the Red Society tried to attack, but their body did not move. The darkness swallowed up every light inside the bar.The shadows that Rudger had created were much darker than the alleyways outside without streetlights. It was a pitch black where the light had completely disappeared and in this darkness Rudger was able to move as he wished.\u201cAww!\u201d\u201cWhat! Aww!\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t see anything!\u201dScreams echoed in the darkness, signifying the death of the Red Society members.Rudger took out a sword from his cane and started removing the Red Society members.\u201cSa, save me!\u201d\u201cBoss! Help me! Boss!\u201dAs their colleagues died one by one, the rest of the group could not keep their sanity. The fear of seeing nothing along with the sound of death was steadily approaching, and their minds couldn\u2019t stand it.\u201cAww! Die! Die!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s here!\u201dCrazed by fear, the gang members swung their weapons in all directions and hit their colleagues. In an instant, the pub turned into a brawl where they killed each other.Rudger used a complex magic that used darkness and shadows, and added a curse to instill fear in the opponent\u2019s weakened heart. It was the 3rd rank dark magic [A fool\u2019s dream]. Although it doesn\u2019t work for those with strong mental powers or those with decent skills in a space filled with only extremities, it was a magic that exerted the greatest effect.\u201cDamn it! What are you doing! Stop it!\u201dDutri clenched his teeth and shouted. Although he could not see ahead, his will was not shaken by such darkness because he had a final card he believed in.At his command, the two men, who had been standing guard in the vicinity of Dutri, moved. As the two of them swung their swords, an aura was loaded on the tip of the sword and split the darkness made of magic.Eventually, the magic was lifted and the light returned to the surroundings again, revealing the bar\u2019s appearance.The bar was a mess, reminiscent of a disastrous situation. Of nearly 100 subordinates, less than 10 were alive and even they were covered in blood and scars.Dutri\u2019s bloody gaze turned to Moriarty, who was at the center of the tragedy.\u2018Who was that wolf monster? Where did it disappear?\u2019The werewolf seemed to have disappeared in the darkness, and Moriarty was alone standing still with a sword in the midst of the corpses, like a reaper that appeared just before death.Not a drop of blood was splattered from Moriarty\u2019s body, even though the area was covered in blood. It looked like something out of this world, so Dutri had goosebumps on his skin without realizing it.\u201cKill him!\u201dAs soon as Dutri\u2019s command came, the two men moved.The two split and rushed towards Moriarty at a terrifying speed. A normal person would have lost its head right away since the two people had far-reaching physical abilities compared to ordinary people even though they didn\u2019t become knights.\u2018I can\u2019t take them lightly.\u2019They mastered aura and dissipated Rudger\u2019s magic. Even though they were stronger than apprentice knights, Rudger didn\u2019t think he would lose.Rudger jumped back and spilled a vial under his feet. Soon after, the vial exploded, and purple smoke spread all around.\u201cIs it poison?\u201dThe long-haired swordsman stepped back and protected Dutri. It\u2019s over when the master dies, no matter what anyone says. Aura was wrapped around his body, trying to resist any possible poison.At that moment shadows flew through the smoke but the swordsman cut them all with his transcendent reflexes but there was something he overlooked and the venom dripping from the exploding reagent bottle was sprayed directly on his forearm.\u201cAww!\u201dThe poison came in contact with the skin and no matter how aura he generated it could not be stopped easily.What Rudger threw in was more like a chemical drug that dissolves everything rather than a poison that reacts in the body. Unless he could protect himself with the aura shield the drug couldn\u2019t be stopped.\u201cDamn it!\u201dIn an instant, one of his arms was paralyzed, and he swung his sword with his remaining arm toward the purple smoke. The smoke was torn apart but the swordsman couldn\u2019t see Rudger anywhere.\u201cWhere?\u201d\u201cLook out! Down!\u201dAt that moment, a colleague who was watching from behind gave him a warning, but it was already too late because Rudger\u2019s sword stick, which suddenly came out of the shadow below, pierced through the man\u2019s jaw and protruded to the top of his head.\u201cA mage can also do melee combat.\u201dRudger said and pulled the sword from his corpse. The oversized corpse leaned over and fell to the side. He thought he could win if he closed the distance and stopped the wizard from casting his next spell, therefore, Rudger was able to win straight away by exploiting the opponent\u2019s loophole.\u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you before? Professor James Moriarty.\u201d\u201cThere is no way that rumors of a wizard who fights like that would not have spread. It\u2019s strange that there hasn\u2019t been any news for years. Were you hiding your identity?\u201d\u201cAm I obligated to tell you that? You are going to die soon.\u201dRudger sneered at the long-haired man and made a smirk towards Dutri over who was behind him. Dutri\u2019s complexion turned pale.\u201cLord, kill him! It\u2019s worth the money!\u201dOne of the two men in charge of the greatest force of the Red Society suffered. The only thing he could trust now was the long-haired man who was protecting him.The long-haired man clicked his tongue and looked into his eyes. Judging by the behavior of Rudger killing his comrade, he seemed very experienced in combat.\u201cAren\u2019t you going to run away?\u201d\u201cWill you look after me when I leave?\u201d\u201cHey!\u201dAt the words of the long-haired man, Dutri shouted.\u201cGee, you\u2019re going to betray me now?!\u201d\u201cLook at the situation now. A guy with a skill similar to mine died without knowing how. You want me to fight a monster like that?\u201d\u201cI gave you money!\u201d\u201cMoney is not more valuable than life.\u201d\u201cTwo, two times! No, I\u2019ll give you three! Even including the share of your dead friend! So kill him!\u201dThe long-haired man hesitated when he heard 3 times the amount of money.\u2018Is it possible to win?\u2019At first, Rudger\u2019s presence was quite intimidating, but didn\u2019t he see the way he fights? In essence, fighting is about understanding the opponent\u2019s way and anticipating his moves.At that moment, Rudger pulled his gun from his waist and fired it at him.The two bullets were deflected by swinging the sword but the sensation in his hand was somehow strange as if the bullets contained magic power.\u2018Magic bullet? He even uses those things?\u2019It was not something the wizards he knew would do. It is said that eccentric wizards do strange things from time to time, but this is not quite common sense.At that moment, Rudger fired another magic bullet. The long-haired man who had deflected it with his sword thought it was impossible to maintain this distance as he was, so he started running.Rudger stepped back again. The speed of the quasi-knight was extremely fast, but there were reagent bottles rolling under the spot where Rudger had left.\u2018Do you think I\u2019m going to fall for the same trick?\u2019He had already observed Rudger\u2019s fighting style and thought that the bottles would spread poison mist so he swung his sword first before they triggered but his face soon contorted.\u2018The sword\u2026\u2026!\u2019When the bottle was cut, the sticky liquid that came out of it fixed his sword to the floor. He used aura to free his sword but an opening was left and Rudger pointed the gun at his forehead.\u2018If I can\u2019t stop it, I\u2019ll avoid it!\u2019With his reflexes, he could dodge the bullets just by looking at the opponent pulling the trigger. Therefore, he focused and stared at Rudger\u2019s figure, but suddenly he felt a burning pain in his stomach and had no choice but to look down.\u201cHuh?\u201dSomething like a black spear protruded through his stomach.He struggled to turn his head, and saw that a spear from his shadow had pierced his stomach from his back.\u201cUh, how\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u2018Wasn\u2019t the magic used by wizards usually centered around the caster?\u2019He couldn\u2019t understand how the magic was activated from a different direction.\u201cI\u2019ve never heard of anything like this\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cTaang!\u201dRudger\u2019s magic bullet pierced his forehead. In the end, the two quasi-knights died in vain without leaving a single wound on Rudger.Dutri, who watched the scene from beginning to end, slid down on his seat with a pale face.\u201cThump. Thump.\u201dRudger slowly approached Dutri and looked down at him. His face, with his back to the light, was obscured by the shadows, making it impossible to see properly.\u201cCome on then.\u201dBut it was clear that he was smiling as he looked at him.\u201cLet\u2019s finish the unfinished story.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There was no reason for him to interfere in the fight between Rudger and the Red Society.Even though he looked like a ferocious werewolf with black fur and over 2 meters tall he didn\u2019t know how to fight.\u2018It\u2019s over.\u2019Pricking his ears, Hans, who had been listening to the situation inside, got up. The last thing he heard was the pain-filled scream of Red Snake Dutri, the leader of the Red Society, who perhaps was tortured for information.As expected, when he entered the pub, he was greeted by a strong smell of blood.\u201cUgh.\u201dHans, whose sense of smell became more sensitive by taking the form of a wolf, moved carefully so as not to step on any corpses.Rudger was sitting at the bar, quietly sipping a drink from a clear glass.\u201cAre you done?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dRudger replied without looking back.\u201cWhere are the two quasi-knights?\u201d\u201cUnder your feet.\u201dThere were corpses all around Hans so he decided not to ask exactly what happened.\u201cUgh. If I keep it this way, I will become sensitive to smells, and my head will start spinning.\u201dHans immediately placed the ampoule Rudger had given him into his forearm. The bloated body shrank and returned to its human form. Then Hans quickly put on his jacket, which he had prepared beforehand.\u201cBrother is great, you can drink alcohol in a place like this.\u201d\u201cI just got used to it.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of drink is that? It smells really good.\u201dHis sense of smell, which had become a little more sensitive due to the effect of his transformation even after returning to human form, captured the smell of alcohol that Rudger was drinking.The scent is quite sweet and the alcohol in Rudger\u2019s glass was clean enough to have no impurities, and the flavor seemed quite deep, it should be a pretty expensive drink.\u201cIt\u2019s 38 years old Gorgonne.\u201d\u201cUgh! Give me some too!\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you say you\u2019re feeling bad?\u201d\u201cEven if it makes me vomit, I should drink it!\u201dRudger handed the bottle to him, Hans took an empty glass and poured it himself.In a shabby bar full of corpses where the smell of blood and alcohol was strangely mixed, the two men sat side by side and drank a masterpiece.\u201cYou killed that Dutri?\u201d\u201cHe hasn\u2019t been killed yet because I need to extract the necessary information and he still has more uses beyond that.\u201d\u201cThe Red Society has built up notoriety while stepping on the others\u2026\u2026If you hand him over alive, the other gangs will be very happy.\u201dOf course, the entire Red Society had not yet been eliminated, as they are the rulers of such a large city, the total number of people is well over a thousand. However only the 100 people gathered here were the core of the organization.\u201cNow that the head of the organization is gone, the rest will disperse. What will brother do, absorb all the small fries?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dRudger shook his head. If there were too many people the organization would be in chaos.\u201cWe will only use the few necessary ones. Of course, we\u2019ll need guys to subcontract, but that\u2019s not all, pick someone with a good head and good character.\u201d\u201cHmm. Let\u2019s go back a little bit.\u201d\u201cHans, I\u2019ve done everything I could. For the rest of the data, go up to the office on the second floor, all of the documents and secret books will be there, so you should see them and proceed.\u201d\u201cI will be busy again.\u201dHans sighed. He has been working hard for days and days to get information, collect data, and organize it.Rudger completed all the necessary procedures in just one night. Of course, it was possible because Rudger was that great, but for Hans, there was no feeling of unfairness.\u2018No. I chose a safe path without risking my life to fight, so I can\u2019t complain about this.\u2019Of course, he had to take risks when collecting dangerous information, but it was also possible for him to borrow the power of this unusual constitution. That\u2019s why he thought Rudger was better, otherwise there would be no reason to follow him.\u201cEven if the hideout is decided, there is only the two of us, right? What are you going to do?\u201d\u201cI will add more members.\u201d\u201cBut a while ago you said\u2026\u201d\u201cI am not talking about such nonsense. Hans, you should know that I have some acquaintances.\u201d\u201cAh.\u201dAt that, Hans\u2019 face immediately crumpled.\u201cAre you serious?\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cBecause, it is\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cAh. Come to think of it, you didn\u2019t get along well with that person.\u201d\u201cHmmm. Rather than having a bad relationship\u2026\u2026.\u201dHans was hesitant because he knew the \u201cacquaintances\u201d Rudger was going to call. Of course, as Rudger directly called them, they were certainly talented in their fields.\u201cNo, by the way, are those stubborn people coming? I wouldn\u2019t even budge with a few words.\u201d\u201cI have already sent a letter. Surprisingly, he will come to finish what he was doing.\u201d\u201cAh-oh.\u201dJust thinking about it made him uncomfortable, so Hans continued to grumble until he emptied his drink.\u201cDo you hate it that much?\u201d\u201cI feel uncomfortable, they are not normal people. Well, I don\u2019t mean to say that when I have this type of constitution.\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t we just get along?\u201d\u201cWhoa. It sounds like brother doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about, but they all have very bad personalities, so how can we get along? Some of them treated me like a test subject.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s a bit docile when I\u2019m with you, but while you\u2019re gone, I might really die. Will he stay here?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m busy maintaining my Rudger status right now.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s it! Every time you go away as a senior teacher, have you ever thought about how much blood I will bleed?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s for you to figure out. Would you like to die?\u201dOf course he won\u2019t die, but he may be under the stress of almost dying.Hans sighed.\u201c\u2026\u2026Haaa. If I think about it, I don\u2019t think there are other people who can do such stupid things as well as those kids.\u201d\u201cBecause they have great abilities.\u201dOne of them made a huge contribution to making all kinds of equipment Rudger used right now.\u201cIs brother any better than they?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cThey were a little suspicious of you, so is it okay to just walk around like this?\u201d\u201cThey were that\u2019s why I\u2019m moving like this now.\u201dIt was this part that Hans was worried about. If Theon is suspicious, shouldn\u2019t Rudger refrain from going out to the city like this? Especially since the opponent is a wizard, they may be secretly monitoring him in some way. Of course, it was necessary to move with caution in everything.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about that.\u201d\u201cReally? Isn\u2019t your opponent a wizard?\u201d\u201cHans, what do you think of wizards?\u201d\u201cHmm. What\u2019s a wizard? If you use magic, you are a wizard. Still, if I had to answer the question\u2026\u2026A very rational and sober seeker?\u201d\u201cI think the same thing. As you said, wizards are quite rational. No, I think they have to be rational, since they do not want to make any mistakes.\u201dA calm mind is essential to use magic. Of course, since a wizard is also a human being, he cannot be free from all mistakes. However, it is a basic skill as a wizard to do your best to reduce mistakes in any areas you can.\u201cThe president is a magician of the sixth rank. Since such a person is suspicious of me, I understand your concerns.\u201d\u201cAre you okay with that?\u201d\u201cIf the president is suspicious of me, let\u2019s say she keeps her eyes closed.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s say so.\u201d\u201cAnd what if I notice? If I ask her why did she secretly watched me? If so, how would the others feel about the president?\u201d\u201cThat\u2026\u2026.\u201dHans let out a hoarse voice and did not respond hastily. You have to pursue secretly without being caught, but you get caught? That\u2019s a pretty bad situation, isn\u2019t it?What if they brazenly say something like \u2018I was suspicious of you\u2019?\u201cIsn\u2019t it okay if you don\u2019t find out?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not \u2018certain\u2019 to go undetected. However, there is a possibility that there may be at least one chance of being caught. Hans, what are you going to consider here?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Hmmm. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s the latter. They wouldn\u2019t follow you unless they\u2019re really sure they will go unnoticed.\u201d\u201cThe opponent is a Theon teacher, and his true abilities are not well known. If they are caught following such a target recklessly, even the president will be quite embarrassed.\u201d\u201cSo it\u2019s better not to do it because it\u2019s going to cost you nothing?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what a wizard is like. Besides, I\u2019ve done a good job as a teacher so far. If she makes a mistake here and disappoint me, the president\u2019s position will be quite embarrassing.\u201dThe president did not trust the teacher and followed suit. That fact alone will make the president\u2019s position worse. Of course, considering the current president\u2019s personality, she will try to keep the situation as stable as possible.\u201cEven the president can\u2019t do anything to a teacher at a time when the opposing factions do not behave themselves. That place is like that.\u201d\u201cAha. I guess so. So you\u2019re saying it doesn\u2019t matter if you move freely like this, aiming for that gap?\u201d\u201cOf course, if I\u2019m too blatant, I will get caught. If the tail is long, it will be trampled on.\u201dIt was for this reason that Rudger managed his image as a teacher and strengthened his integrity. Thanks to that, even if he goes out freely now, the president will not pursue him, although he may be a little suspicious. Especially on a day like today when Theon became noisy due to a battle between nobles and commoners.\u201cI understand. Then there\u2019s no need to worry right now.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s like that.\u201d\u201cSo, if everyone gets together and forms an organization, have you decided what the name will be?\u201d\u201cName?\u201d\u201cNow brother and I are trying to properly settle in Leathervelk. If so, then you should definitely decide on the name of the organization. Well, even if you get rid of ranks and stuff like that, wouldn\u2019t the atmosphere not live up to you without a name?\u201d\u201cI guess.\u201dAfter pouring all the alcohol into the empty glass, the bottle was empty.\u201cHow many people will come?\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026 With brother and I included, wouldn\u2019t it be about six or seven?\u201d\u201cFew.\u201d\u201cIt is absurdly insufficient to form an organization with so few people.\u201d\u201cBut more people will come. If I add a few more, maybe 10 people wouldn\u2019t be too bad.\u201d\u201cTen people? So, have you decided on a name?\u201d\u201cName\u2026\u2026.\u201dRudger suddenly remembered a poem and the original of a famous novel of the same name he had read in a previous life.There is a character that suppressed his own sins and judged those who could not be dealt with by the law. In the end, he even got rid of himself.\u201c<U.N. Owen>.\u201d\u201c<U.N. Owen>? Organization name, Unknown? Did you just change the meaning of the word unknown into a pun?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cI like the way it sounds.\u201dThus, the new organization that Rudger would create was named <U.N. Owen>.\u201cBrother, one last drink?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dCelebrating the birth of the new organization, Rudger and Hans clapped the last remaining glasses toasting.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Sorry for the late post.The day after the duel.\u201cUgh. Tired.\u201dAidan staggered down the hallway with slow steps like a zombie. Even now, as soon as class was over, some students approached him and talked to him or pretended to be friendly.Excessive attention from other students was too burdensome for Aidan, and it was rather annoying.\u201cUgh. Why did this happen?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s because you did a great job in front of everyone. Are you stupid?\u201dLeo, who heard Aidan talking to himself, intervened.\u201cIs it?\u201d\u201cUgh. You are completely unaware of this.\u201dLeo realized that Aidan was sincere and sighed while Aidan scratched his head shyly.Aidan was the type of person who didn\u2019t like to show off because he genuinely liked magic rather than having the mindset to succeed as a wizard.How many such people were there, including Aidan in Theon?\u201cIt wasn\u2019t enough that you won the duel against the nobles, you even used a strange magic to get rid of the opponent\u2019s magic.\u201d\u201cYeah?\u201d\u201cAidan, what kind of magic did you use back then?\u201dTracy, who was walking one step closer than usual to Aidan, couldn\u2019t contain her curiosity and asked. In her eyes, there was a strong will to find out the magic that Aidan used. Aidan hesitated to answer the burdensome gaze.\u201cUh, um. just\u2026\u2026I learned it when I was young. It\u2019s nothing.\u201d\u201cIf that\u2019s nothing, what are we?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. It\u2019s magic that erases magic. I\u2019ve never heard of anything like that. Don\u2019t turn around and answer me right away.\u201d\u201cUmmm.\u201dAidan hesitated to answer because his Master had strictly warned him not to divulge this magic. That was the reason why he desperately refused to answer the persistent questions of his classmates. Although he doesn\u2019t mind telling anyone he really trusts.\u2018Is it really okay?\u2019Aidan thought for a moment. Tracy and Leo are the precious friends he made here in Theon. They had been close friends before he used anti-magic so he didn\u2019t think they had any hidden agenda.Suddenly, he remembered what his Master said.\u2018There will always be times in life where you have to choose something. In that case, follow your heart.\u2019His Master spoke lightly, but Aidan never forgot those teachings and made a decision.\u201cI will tell you.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dWhen Aidan answered seriously, Tracy was surprised. She wasn\u2019t expecting much when she asked the question since she saw Aidan keep his mouth shut despite the barrage of questions from other students after class a while ago.She thought that there might be a secret that Aidan couldn\u2019t tell and just wanted to try her luck but she didn\u2019t expect his answer.\u201cLet\u2019s go to a quiet place for now.\u201dThe three of them headed to the rose park.* * *The rose park was filled with a gentle fragrance under the dazzling sun. Aidan sat on a quiet bench in the park where beautiful colorful roses were in full bloom, and thought about what to say.\u201cWhat should I say?\u201dThen he finally opened his mouth, thinking that he should speak from the beginning.\u201cWhat I used is called anti-magic, it\u2019s magic that removes magic.\u201d\u201cWe can see that.\u201d\u201cSo it\u2019s called anti-magic.\u201dLeo and Tracy had contrasting reactions.Aidan smiled brightly and continued.\u201cIt was my master, a wandering wizard, who taught me this magic, but in reality, I am the only one who knows how to use anti-magic.\u201d\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d\u201cHe said it was possible only with a special body. I didn\u2019t know either, but Master said so.\u201d\u201cA special constitution\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cWho is that Master?\u201dThe thing Tracy and Leo were most curious about was Aidan\u2019s teacher. A wandering wizard who knew anti-magic? If he was that talented, they should have known him.To that, Aidan scratched his cheek and answered.\u201cI don\u2019t know either.\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026What?\u201dAt the sharp gazes of Tracy and Leo, Aidan held out both hands and made an excuse in a hurry.\u201cWhen I first met my Master, I was only 8 years old. That was more than 10 years ago.\u201d\u201c10 years\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cBesides, he\u2019s so free-spirited and hard to keep track of, so even now, I don\u2019t know where he is or what he\u2019s doing. When he left, he disappeared like the wind, so there was no time to ask for his name.\u201d\u201cWhat? Then you don\u2019t know if he\u2019s alive or dead?\u201d\u201cUgh. Still, considering his skills, he should be alive. I think so.\u201dWhat a carefree reaction to a teacher who taught him an extraordinary magic called anti-magic. Tracy bit her lips, trying to say something to him.Tracy felt sad.\u2018I wanted to know more about Aidan.\u2019Suddenly, Tracy realized that she was overly interested in Aidan.\u2018Ahhh! No! It is only important to me to bring my family back to life!\u2019Tracy immediately cleared her thoughts and shook her head violently from side to side. Her red hair, tied in two ponytails, swayed to match.\u2018It\u2019s just curiosity, it\u2019s just curiosity. Yes. That\u2019s all.\u2019Leo, who had been listening quietly, raised his question as Tracy was distressed.\u201cIt\u2019s more exciting than that. Even 10 years ago, the anti-magic you used was not so well known.\u201d\u201cUgh. Maybe it\u2019s because it\u2019s so rare?\u201d\u201cThe rarer the magic, the more famous it has to be. Even more so if that magic erases other magic.\u201dAnti-magic has no lethal power. Compared to other wizards, there were certainly few things that could be done with anti-magic. But for one thing, when dealing with wizards, anti-magic showed incredible performance.\u201cAidan. That anti-magic, does it all work regardless of the magic hierarchy?\u201d\u201cWell. I don\u2019t know that either. To be honest, this is the first time I\u2019ve used it properly. Up until now, I haven\u2019t had any use for it.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t your teacher tell you that?\u201d\u201cI was never given a detailed explanation because teacher is not like that. Besides, I also liked learning magic at that time, so I just learned it without thinking.\u201d\u201cUgh.\u201dLeo sighed in response to Aidan\u2019s answer. It was a collaboration between an irresponsible and secretive master, and an immature rural kid who simply liked magic and thought about learning it.\u201cLeo, why are you asking that?\u201d\u201cI think I heard something a while ago.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cYour master. Do you know his name?\u201d\u201cUh, huh? I didn\u2019t ask for his name. Maybe he told me, but I don\u2019t remember.\u201d\u201cProbably he didn\u2019t say his name. There hasn\u2019t been any news from such a person for the past 10 years and that\u2019s strange. If he\u2019s that talented, it wouldn\u2019t be surprising to have his name adorned on a page of any newspaper.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dAidan was illiterate in this field, so he couldn\u2019t answer properly.\u201cI think it\u2019s because you aren\u2019t aware of it yet, but anti-magic is magic that can make noise just by itself, especially in the magic world.\u201d\u201cBut after going through that, I noticed that the other guys didn\u2019t know about it.\u201d\u201cThat must mean that it was that secret. It is difficult for students who are learning magic now to understand something like that.\u201dThen Tracy, who was listening, intervened.\u201cDidn\u2019t the teachers know? If they didn\u2019t know, the teachers wouldn\u2019t have left Aidan alone.\u201d\u201cSome of the teachers had their eyes wide open as if they were surprised. They knew about anti-magic, but they were surprised to see people actually using it.\u201d\u201cDid you check that?\u201dLeo nodded.When everyone in the audience watched Aidan, who used anti-magic, blankly, Leo focused on the reaction of the audience. Among them, there were some people who showed a natural reaction as if they knew this from the beginning.People who know about anti-magic, know how Aidan uses it, and were not surprised to see it in front of their eyes.\u201cFirst of all, the president.\u201d\u201cWell, the president is a great person, so she probably knew. Anyone else?\u201d\u201cThere was Mr. Hugo and Mrs. Marie Ross, who seemed to have been in the teaching profession for a long time. Other than that, the new teachers were unaware. But\u2026.\u201d\u201cBut?\u201d\u201cMr. Rudger Chelici was different.\u201d\u201cMr. Rudger\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cYes. Ms. Rudger had a natural reaction, as if he had known about Aidan\u2019s anti-magic from the beginning.\u201dAidan suddenly remembered the figure of Rudger that day. He was always a consistent person, so he thought it was strange, but his attitude was still strange even though he used anti-magic.\u201cPerhaps Mr. Rudger knew a little about the anti-magic Aidan used?\u201d\u201cDid he know? If so, to what extent?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know about that but I\u2019m guessing it may have something to do with Aidan\u2019s master.\u201dThen Tracy came forward and responded.\u201cThat\u2019s too much of a guess no matter how you think about it. Didn\u2019t you ever think that Mr. Rudger might not have noticed in the first place?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re the one who doesn\u2019t know, Tracy.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s think. Why was it that Mr. Rudger was so good to Aidan?\u201dAt Leo\u2019s words, Tracy frowned.\u201cDid you forget? When giving the lecture on elemental attributes, Mr. Rudger complimented Aidan.\u201d\u201cNo, that\u2019s because Aidan did a good job\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cThat cold-blooded one? Have you not seen Flora Lumos-senpai? It was Mr. Rudger who did not spare any bitterness or harsh words against that genius. And what\u2019s important next. Do you remember the bet Mr. Rudger had with Mr. Chris?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d\u201cAt that time, Mr. Rudger was betting that Aidan would win. He said it without a single hesitation. Isn\u2019t it strange? Up until now, Aidan has been an ordinary student with little known information.\u201d\u201cThat\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cWhat was it about Aidan that made Mr. Rudger so convinced that Aidan would win against a noble student? And why did he spend his personal time teaching him the [Moving-Magus] as well?\u201dThe more Leo spoke, the less Tracy spoke. After listening to him, it seemed that Leo was right.\u201cI checked and the [Moving-Magus] is a practical technique used only by special people in the military.\u201d\u201cMr. Rudger served as a military officer.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the part. Lessons learned in the military. Military officer. A sense of knowing a little about anti-magic. I found a connection here.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dTracy asked, and Aidan was also interested in Leo\u2019s guess, waiting for his next words.\u201cMaybe Mr. Rudger may know something about your teacher.\u201d\u201cMr. Rudger? But how?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know details about that. However, my guess is yes. Mr. Rudger must have met your teacher while he was a military officer. The reason your master has such skills and is not famous and secret is probably because he came from a secret unit in the military that should not be known.\u201dLeo was convinced in his heart that his reasoning was almost correct.Hearing those words, Aidan felt his head tilted a little. If he was a soldier he knew, he was disciplined and always thrifty, so to speak, he would have been like Rudger. However, in his memory, his Master was more like a free spirit than a soldier.\u2018No, if he was from a secret unit, he might be different from a normal soldier.\u2019In a way, he thought that Leo\u2019s guess might be right.\u201cDoes Mr. Rudger know about my teacher?\u201d\u201cConsidering the behavior he showed, I think it is possible. If he doesn\u2019t, there\u2019s no way he\u2019ll be nice to you. Maybe the two of them were close to each other.\u201dIt is the same with accepting anti-magic naturally and also because Rudger, who does not seem to be interested in others, spent time teaching Aidan the [Moving-Magus].Leo\u2019s words certainly made sense.\u201cThen, if I ask Mr. Rudger, won\u2019t he tell me about Master?\u201dAidan pondered for a moment at Tracy\u2019s question and then shook his head.\u201cNo, because I\u2019m still not sure. Besides, I don\u2019t want to bother teacher again for nothing, he has already been helped enough.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.If you think so.\u201dAs the conversation slowly ripened, Tracy opened her mouth as if she had remembered something.\u201cAh, have you guys heard that rumor?\u201d\u201cRumor?\u201d\u201cWhat rumor?\u201d* * *I was sharing a meal with the new teachers.First of all, they have the same motives for joining Theon, and it is essential to maintain a minimum number of personal connections no matter what country you are in.It\u2019s not that cumbersome. If you sit still and eat your meal, the other teachers will take care of themselves and ask for news, and then they will exchange it with each other. In particular, Ms. Selina likes to chat so much that she babbled nonstop while eating.Of course, she\u2019s not annoyed or anything. Rather, teacher Selina\u2019s behavior was the mood maker of this meeting. Still, I didn\u2019t pay much attention to the information that was asked, as it was close to ineffective.\u201cOh. Doesn\u2019t Mr. Rudger do that?\u201dHowever, I guess these news are different from the usual ones.I turned to Selina and asked.\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d\u201cMr. Rudger has been working alone all this time. From collecting data, organizing textbooks, and checking assignments. Right?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d\u2018Isn\u2019t that the teacher\u2019s job?\u2019Just as I was thinking about it, Selina asked me innocently.\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t Mr. Rudger have an assistant?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u2026\u2026Was there anything like that?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In fact, I didn\u2019t even know I could hire an assistant teacher.\u2018If I think about it, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen other teachers alone.\u2019Most of the teachers had people around them. At the time I thought it was just a student asking questions to the teacher or a user who does chores.So, I guess, except for me right now, all the teachers hired assistants? Am I the only one who didn\u2019t know that?Selina\u2019s was that she was quite surprised by my answer.\u201cYes? Then, until now, things like organizing assignments, student lists, and class preparation materials\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cI did it all with my own hands.\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you tired?\u201dAm I having a hard time? Hmm\u2026.It was a bit cumbersome to guide close to 80 students one by one, organize materials, and prepare the contents of the class by myself. In particular, the most difficult thing is to check the list of submitted assignments one by one. Still, I shook my head because I didn\u2019t feel tired.\u201cThere is nothing difficult about it.\u201d\u201cHow many students did Mr. Rudger have in the classroom?\u201d\u201c80 people. The class is full.\u201dAt those words, I heard gasps of breath from the other teachers who were eating with us.\u201cSo, have you been taking charge of all 80 students by yourself since the beginning of the semester?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t this usually the case?\u201d\u201cNot usually.\u201d\u201cIs that right?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dI have looked closely at the other teachers, so I should be able to figure out what I\u2019m doing wrong.\u201cThen did Selena also hire assistants?\u201d\u201cYeah. I still don\u2019t need a lot of hands, so I only hired three people.\u201dYou hired 3 people because you don\u2019t really need help? Well, do other people hire 10 at a time?I glanced around and suddenly saw a teacher passing by outside the dining room, it was Chris Benimore. There were eight fidgety students chasing behind him, who has always been low-key since he lost the bet with me.\u201cSince there are 80 students in your class you\u2019ll need at least 5 assistants.\u201d\u201cI think so.\u201dMs. Merylda also intervened in the conversation.\u201cYou may be fine now, but as time goes on, you will become more and more frustrated, right?\u201d\u201cDo I need them right now?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to hire them all at once, it doesn\u2019t matter if you increase the number little by little.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dHmm\u2026When you say it like that it sounds tempting. Besides, looking at the reactions of the people around me, if I don\u2019t have any assistants, it seems like I\u2019ll draw too much attention from other people.First of all, it seemed necessary to hire a suitable person in the near future.\u201cAll right. Then I will try to hire an assistant as soon as possible.\u201d\u201cMs. Rudger is very popular, so if you post an official letter, you will have a lot of students applying.\u201d\u201cThank you for the compliment, even if it\u2019s empty words.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not empty words\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m done eating, so I\u2019ll leave now.\u201dI got up from my seat, said goodbye, and left the restaurant.* * *\u201cHmm.\u201dReturning to the office, I stroked my chin as I read a book about recruiting assistant teachers.\u2018Even a new teacher can hire an assistant, and there are usually six or more. I mean, I have to pull it out.\u2019After all, even among wizards, there are teachers and pupils, but the magic academy isn\u2019t that serious. Even in the Tower, there are teachers for each school, with dozens of disciples under them of course they\u2019re close to slaves that are used as labor force but they\u2019re still apprentices in name.It has become a kind of tradition, and Theon, who teaches magic, has not escaped this influence. Surprisingly, there was also a similar system in Theon. After their last year students can research magic and produce a thesis under their advisor\u2026\u2026Yes, to be honest, they were like graduate students of the 21st century. Theon was very innovative in both, a good and bad sense.\u2018I don\u2019t feel the need to hire an assistant because I don\u2019t have any work to do right now, but it wouldn\u2019t be a bad thing if there was at least one person who took care of the chores.\u2019After all, this isn\u2019t a real tower, and since it\u2019s an academy, I didn\u2019t have to worry about the security issue of the assistant stealing my arcane magic data. They just need to organize the materials related to the class.\u2018If someone becomes a teaching assistant, I can basically give them more credits or more personal guidance.\u2019There is no obligation to pass on arcane magic. If there was such a clause in the first place, the teachers would have opposed it.\u2018If I had to choose, it would be better to choose a competent person.\u2019The simplest way to select an assistant is to post an advertisement. If I promise to recruit a few teaching assistants under my name, there will be applicants, and I will choose from among them.Basically, it is said that a lot of people who are about to graduate are teaching assistants, but there is no particular age limit. Rather, they said that new teachers mainly select first- and second-year students who take their own classes.\u2018Should I choose from the students who take my class?\u2019If I select an assistant from among the students taking my class it has to be someone who can direct and lead the students well and not hold them back.The first people that come to mind are Flora Lumos and Erendir von Exilion. The two are high-ranking nobles and royalty, and they have natural charisma, so they are good at controlling the atmosphere.\u2018It\u2019s just that these two aren\u2019t going to be my assistants.\u2019First of all, Flora Lumos is hard to pick because I have given her a lot of points to be honest, and in the case of Princess Erendir, no matter how much Theon insists on equality of status, this is too much. She was the one I had to turn down, even if she said yes to her.\u2018I know that if I post an official, they will come on their own, but it will take a while and choosing an untested person has too many drawbacks.\u2019Even if I think about it right now, the answer does not come out, so I decided to go back to the dorm for now. After putting on my coat and leaving the office, I stopped walking when I suddenly felt a familiar presence while walking down the hallway.\u201cSedina.\u201d\u201cYes, yes!\u201dAt my call, Sedina Rosen, who had been hiding in the corner of the hallway, popped out in amazement. Still looking at me with awe-inspiring eyes, she seems to have been secretly waiting for me.\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d\u201cOh, no. It\u2019s not like that\u2026\u2026.\u201dShe looked restless for fear that I would get angry with her. I was about to tell her to leave when I thought about the assistant position and opened my mouth.\u201cGood timing.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cYou, be my assistant.\u201d\u201cYeah. Ah yes.\u201dSedina nodded her head reflexively and after 5 seconds.\u201c\u2026\u2026Yeah?!\u201dSedina exclaimed in amazement. She only said one word, but her reaction was so varied.\u201cDo you not like it? If you don\u2019t like it, I won\u2019t force you to do it.\u201d\u201cOh, no! Great!\u201dTo my words, Sedina bit her tongue in haste to say no. The way she covered her mouth with her two hands felt like a real squirrel.\u201cThen do you agree?\u201dSedina shook her head violently up and down, unable to open her mouth.\u201cI\u2019m glad you agree. There is still time left, so fill out the assistant teacher application form and come to my office.\u201d\u201cIs it really okay for me to be your assistant?\u201d\u201cThere is no reason not to. Or do I have any reason to lie?\u201d\u201cOh no!\u201d\u201cThe duration is two days, remember.\u201dI left the room after speaking with Sedina. As a member of the Black Dawn, she specializes in gathering information, given what she has shown so far. If I leave her like that, I\u2019ll have a better chance of finding out about Black Dawn.If I make her my assistant it will be easier for us to talk than setting up a place and time to meet. Above all, it will be able to erase the suspicious gaze of a third party.\u2018For now, one Sedina is confirmed. The rest can be recruited slowly later.\u2019I got a loyal slave sooner than I thought.* * *A few days after the duel between Aidan and Jevan Pellio ended. The story of the duel from that day still lingered among the students, but, as is the case with students, they wanted to find new gossip rather than burnt firewood. And this time, what the students were talking about was a topic enough to get everyone on their feet.\u201cWhat happened?\u201dRene asked the 3rd princess, Erendir, who sat next to her at ease. Although the two were far apart from each other in terms of ranks they were able to get to know each other faster than anyone else because they had no close friends. They\u2019re also the kind of people who don\u2019t care about small things.\u201cAh, junior Rene is here. It seems that strange rumors are circulating among the classmates these days.\u201d\u201cStrange rumors?\u201d\u201cMr. Rudger is recruiting assistants.\u201d\u201cWow. That\u2019s kind of tempting.\u201dThe fact that Rudger Chelici did not hire an assistant so far was a well-known issue among students. Considering that most teachers always select assistants, it was quite unusual for a new teacher to not select a single one so far.There was even a joke among students that Mr. Rudger might not have known that he could hire an assistant.\u2018Of course, Mr. Rudger cannot do that.\u2019She didn\u2019t think that such a thorough man would have a loophole in that area. Even the students were just joking around.If Rudger would hire an assistant perhaps the front of Rudger\u2019s office would be filled with students. Maybe he didn\u2019t hire an assistant because he didn\u2019t like loud and annoying things.\u201cStill, the hottest rumor is probably something else.\u201d\u201cSomething else? What is it?\u201d\u201cHave you ever heard of the 7th generation legend of Theon?\u201d\u201cI haven\u2019t heard about it.\u201dRene was ignorant in that area, so she couldn\u2019t answer properly.\u201cAh. You don\u2019t know either.\u201d\u201cUh, yes. I don\u2019t know about that\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s natural. In the first place, it\u2019s just a rumor.\u201dHowever, it was a topic that the students were more excited about.The Seventh Legend of Theon says that somewhere in this school, the dungeon of the founder and first president of Theon is hidden.Another famous legend is about a stone that can make wishes come true.\u201cThat\u2019s probably the most upsetting thing right now.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cA stone that can make wishes come true.\u201dAt Erendir\u2019s words, Line thought for a moment that she heard something wrong. How could there be a stone that grants wishes?\u201cIt is rumored to be somewhere in Theon.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dRene was puzzled by that. Does the wish granting stone really exist?Erendir, seeing such a reaction from Rene, shook her left and right.\u201cJunior Rene.\u201d\u201cHuh\u2026\u2026What?\u201d\u201cHow many undiscovered mysteries are there in the world? Monsters and demons that were said to have existed in ancient times and cryptids still scattered all over the world. Even secret ruins and unknown gods exist somewhere in this world.\u201dErendir\u2019s eyes were burning with curiosity towards the unknown.\u201cIn such a world it is not impossible for the stone to exist. Of course it would be unreasonable to grant any wits but an Artifact with the corresponding power exists!\u201d\u201cUh, yes.\u201dRene was taken aback by the unusual appearance of Erendir. She wouldn\u2019t have thought that Erendir would have such a hobby.\u201cSenior\u2026\u2026Do you know about the legend?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m kind of interested so I know a little.\u201dRene looked at Erendir with a fresh look. Outside of Theon Erendir was a being so high that Rene couldn\u2019t even make eye contact with her. She is always a lofty and dignified princess who must show off her charisma in front of all her people but she is also a person with her own hobbies just like everyone else.\u201cBecause of the Almighty Stone, Theon has become noisy.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dExcept for Rene and Erendir, all the students were talking about the Almighty Stone.\u2018The Almighty Stone\u2026so childish.\u2019Flora Lumos overheard these students and snorted inwardly.\u2018If there were such a stone in the world, adults would have already taken it before it even reached the students\u2019 ears.\u2019If such a thing existed in the first place, wouldn\u2019t it be a matter of national security?\u2018 You believe in such a legend, yet you are still trying to become wizards?\u2019Seeing the students chattering about searching for the stone after school later made her feel ashamed that they were learning in the same school.\u2018I\u2019ll just do my own thing and that\u2019s it.\u2019For Flora the occasional news about Rudger were more concerning.\u2018Are you hiring an assistant, Mr. Rudger?\u2019Flora was wondering who Rudger would choose as his assistant.\u2018In the case of a normal assistant, it would not be done by someone who lacks because it represents the image of the teacher.\u2019For a teacher like Rudger, his assistant must have the skills he needs.\u2018Oh my. What am I thinking?\u2019Flora shook her head.\u2018There\u2019s nothing I can do if I keep worrying about it.\u2019As she thought about that, the front door of the classroom swung open and a female student entered.\u2018What?\u2019All eyes were focused on her. She had a small stature and voluminous brown hair. Then, regardless of the gazes of the other students, she placed the material, which she had fully embraced in her arms, on the pulpit.\u201cThe teacher is coming soon, so please be quiet.\u201dFlora\u2019s face\u00a0 became blank at the soft voice she spoke boldly.\u2018Have you already hired an assistant?\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I wanted to post yesterday but I was too tired. One more chapter will be released in a few hours to finish last week releases.I gave Sedina Rosen two days to submit the application for the assistant teacher position but she wrote down the application form neatly after an hour and came to my dorm.She was gasping for breath as she ran.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dI didn\u2019t know that she wanted to become an assistant that much, so I accepted it with a bewildered face, and Sedina was appointed as my assistant.Next day I handed Sedina the materials for my class and then slowly made my way to the classroom, telling her to go first and put it on the podium.\u2018First of all, I need to imprint who my assistant is on the students.\u2019Even though Sedina lacks something and looks young, she is very thorough and straightforward to others. She is often wary of others, which I suspect may have something to do with why she joined Black Dawn. Just in front of me, who she mistakenly thinks is the First Order is she acting weird.\u2018Now I can go in slowly.\u2019When I opened the door to the classroom and went inside, Sedina, who was standing on the platform, saw me, and she hurriedly bowed her head.\u201cGood job,\u201d I said.I only said one word, but Sedina trembled with excitement and left the classroom.I climbed onto the podium and glanced at the students.\u2018What\u2019s going on with the students?\u2019Most of them looked at me with their eyes wide open, as if in disbelief. No matter how I look at it, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s because I chose Sedina as my assistant.Is that so surprising?\u2018Besides, why is she like that again?\u2019Flora Lumos\u2019 gaze stood out even among the students. She clenched her teeth in order not to show her emotions, but she looked at me with a stern gaze, and at that moment, I knew I had become a sinner.I ignored her gaze and watched the reactions of the other students.\u2018It has been quite some time since the start of the class, and the eyes of some students are starting to change.\u2019Until this point, some students hid themselves while watching each other as if they were spying on each other since it was the beginning of the semester. Is the search war over now?The momentum of some students has changed considerably compared to the beginning of the class, especially Aidan\u2019s.\u201cUh, huh?\u201dAidan flinched as if he felt my gaze.The duel between Aidan and Jevan Pellio was enough to cause a stir in the calm atmosphere of Theon. There had been the werewolf case before, but a confrontation between commoners and aristocratic students must have been the decisive blow.It cannot be said that it is Aidan\u2019s fault since it was going to happen someday. In a way, it can be said that this guy was very unlucky. Whatever the case, it is true that a wind has been brought to Theon and in time the students affected by it will slowly begin to reveal their true nature. No one knows whether it will go in the right direction or vice versa.\u2018It must be because of the noisy atmosphere in the classroom right now.\u2019Judging by the varied reactions, I think the students are surprised by who I choose to be my assistant.\u201cQuiet.\u201dThe students who had been chatting with each other became quiet at my words.\u201cThe class begins.\u201dTeachers only need to do well in class.* * *\u201cWhat you learned today will be on the next exam, so be sure to review it when you get back.\u201dAfter giving the students a simple assignment, I arranged my textbooks and left the classroom.\u201cMr. Rudger. I have a question.\u201dOne of the students raised their hand and said.I was careful not to turn down personal questions after class, but this was the first time a question came up like this. Until this point, everyone looked at me and didn\u2019t even think of approaching me.\u201cWhat are you curious about?\u201dThere was nothing I couldn\u2019t answer for now, so I looked at the student who raised his hand and asked. The moment I saw the hair as white as snow I remembered the student\u2019s name.\u201cJulia Plumhart.\u201d\u201cYou remember my name.\u201d\u201cBecause you are a student listening to my lectures.\u201dJulia Plumhart with her white hair, pale skin, a strange atmosphere that makes you feel like you will freeze just by getting close and an alluring and subtle smile that looked dark inside has a outstanding appearance but the reason I remember her it\u2019s because she took the first place in the admission exams and it\u2019s also an undisputed rookie from the Tower.\u2018Up until this point, she had just been quietly attending classes, but surprisingly.\u2019\u201cWhat are you curious about?\u201dI stood still and waited for Julia\u2019s question.\u201cHow did you choose your assistant?\u201dHer question was about my assistant?\u201cI saw her myself and recruited her.\u201d\u201cThen, are there any conditions? For example, if you are good enough at magic you can be chosen.\u201dAt her words, all the students looked at me with curious eyes.* * *Julia\u2019s question seemed out of pure curiosity, but in reality she wasn\u2019t, her intention was to stab Rudger. He suddenly hired an assistant, and she now asks if he is sure that she has the skills worthy of the position.He might be offended by that subtle attack, but Rudger simply stared at Julia with his still, calm eyes. Eventually, when everyone\u2019s attention was focused, his mouth opened.\u201cWhen I hire someone to be my assistant, I see only one thing.\u201d\u201cWhat is that?\u201d\u201cTenacity.\u201dJulia was momentarily speechless at the too dignified answer.\u201cWhen I look at or select someone, I don\u2019t look at rank, position, or honor, only at personality. The reason I chose my assistant is because of her character.\u201d\u201cThen do you mean that you don\u2019t consider anything else when choosing an assistant?\u201d\u201cYes, anyone is welcome but there will be an interview before choosing anyone.\u201dRudger said so and pointed at Julia.\u201cBut, it looks like you can\u2019t be my assistant.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dJulia\u2019s smiling face changed as if she had been hit with a powerful blow because Rudger said that her personality was bad. Rudger looked around her other students and said,\u201cAnyone else has questions?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dRudger\u2019s eyes turned to where the sound had come from. Aidan, Leo, and Tracy were there. It looked like Leo was talking, but it was Aidan who was bewildered.\u201cWhat else are you curious about Aidan?\u201d\u201cUh, yes?\u201d\u201cDid you not want to ask a question?\u201dAidan hesitated to answer Rudger\u2019s question. Obviously, it was Leo who raised his hand, but the atmosphere suddenly shifted to him.Leo patted him on the shoulder, telling him to do his best but the question that came out of his mouth was something entirely different.\u201d \u2026\u2026Have you heard of the wish-granting stone?\u201dHe was so flustered that my brain hardened, and just spit it out without thinking. He was going to ask about his Master but wasted his chance.Tracy and Leo, who were cheering next to him, also stared at Aidan with expressions of \u2018What are you doing all of a sudden?\u2019\u201cHeard.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201d\u201cI heard, but I want to tell you that it is a rumor.\u201dNo one could answer that question because everyone knew that Aidan wasn\u2019t asking because he was genuinely curious.\u201cIt\u2019s better to hone your magic even a little bit in your spare time than pay attention to such nonsense. Do you know that the first evaluation day is coming soon?\u201dRudger\u2019s voice, which had become even heavier, swept the entire classroom. Every student in Theon would be tested that day and it was slowly approaching.\u201cAt that time, those who did not get the proper results will be considered as not being faithful to their studies because they were distracted by useless rumors.\u201dAt Rudger\u2019s last words, some students gulped their saliva.\u201cDoes anyone have more questions?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cIf not, I will go.\u201dAfter saying those words, Rudger left the classroom. Sedina, who had been waiting for Rudger with her back against the wall by the door, hurriedly greeted him.\u201cThank you for the class, sir.\u201d\u201cAre you still waiting?\u201d\u201cYes. How did it go?\u201d\u201cFrom now on, please wait comfortably in the assistant office. Don\u2019t waste your time here.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dEven after Sedina answered that, she wrinkled her hand to see if she had something to say to Rudger.\u201cDo you have more to say?\u201d\u201cHuh. That, that\u2026\u2026.\u201dRudger recalled Sedina\u2019s reaction and Julia\u2019s question to him.\u201cIs it about Julia Plumhart?\u201d\u201cOh no, that\u2019s\u2026\u2026!\u201d\u201cDo not worry, she has no intention of asking for personal matters.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Yes.\u201dSedina nodded her head, relieved.\u201cTake it.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dWhen Rudger handed over the pile of assignments he was holding, Sedina hurriedly reached out and accepted it.It was so sudden that she staggered, but she managed to balance herself.\u201cLet\u2019s deal with it today.\u201d\u201cYes Yes.\u201d\u201cAnswer only once.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dAt that moment, the back door of the classroom opened, and a girl with long blue hair came up to Rudger, it was Flora Lumos. Seeing her appearance, Sedina stood behind Rudger, holding the pile of assignments.\u201cFlora Lumos, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cTeacher chose a teaching assistant\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cAs you can see, one was selected but why are you asking?\u201d\u201cThat\u2026\u2026.\u201dSeeing Flora clenching and opening her fists while still moaning inwardly, Rudger asked sarcastically.\u201cAre you planning to apply for the assistant position?\u201d\u201cOh, no?! Why me?!\u201dUnknowingly, Flora raised his voice and shouted. Aware of her mistake, she covered her mouth with her hand.\u201cOpportunities are always open. If you change your mind, you can apply.\u201dRudger turned his back after saying those words.Flora, who was left alone, stared blankly at Rudger\u2019s back as he walked away through the hallway.\u2018\u2026\u2026Annoying.\u2019* * *Returning to his office, Rudger was unable to rest and had to get up again.[Mr. Rudger? Can you come to my office for a moment?]It was because the president called Rudger.Rudger had no choice but to make his way to the president\u2019s office. He took the elevator in the main building and climbed to the top, where the president\u2019s office was located. He crossed the hallway and knocked on the door.\u201cThis is Rudger Chelici.\u201d\u201cCome in.\u201dThe door opened by itself with the president\u2019s voice. Rudger entered and sat down in an empty seat opposite the president.\u201cWhat did you call me for?\u201d\u201cMr. Rudger, have you heard the rumors?\u201dShe returned his question with a question, not an answer.\u201cThe rumor about the all-powerful stone that grants wishes.\u201d\u201cAre you talking about the Almighty Stone?\u201dRudger nodded his head.\u201cI did hear a bit. It seems to be quite popular among students.\u201d\u201cIt is.\u201d\u201cHowever, I didn\u2019t really care because I thought it was just a rumor.\u201d\u201cMr. Rudger thought it was only a rumor?\u201dThe president shook her head with an inexplicable smile then she revealed a bombshell.\u201cActually, a stone that can make wishes come true does exist.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

First of all, I need to explain about the Almighty Stone.\u201dThe president said and lightly flicked her finger. It was a very natural and light act but the result wasn\u2019t. A huge and clear magical energy emanating from the president\u2019s fingertips moved and took form in front of me. It was obviously a stone that looked like a hologram in the air.It was a surprising sight, but I took care of my expression and looked closely at the shape of the stone. Although it was called the Almighty Stone, it was closer to an unfinished gem, that is, a raw stone rather than a normal stone.\u201cAs you can see, the Almighty stone is real. It is an object with unknown and mysterious powers that have been around for a long time that it is difficult to guess how old it is.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a relic.\u201dAncient relics are old objects with mysterious power.\u201cYou knew.\u201d\u201cYes. I have heard something.\u201dIt\u2019s different from relics and artifacts.Artifacts are artificially created for a single effect but relics aren\u2019t like that. It is not known who made them, how they were made, or how they work. At the same time, their effects and power are at least 100 times greater than the artifacts created by Archmages.In a way, they are comparable to a strategic weapon that requires careful management. However, the number of Relics is so small that it is hard to find them on the entire continent as they have great power.\u2018Is there such a relic in Theon?\u2019\u201cMr. Rudger must have heard something, so it would be easier to explain. Yes, there is a relic in Theon called <The Almighty Stone>. To be precise, it has been stored in Theon for a very long time.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201dI nodded my head. However, if there is a problem, why did the president call me? Isn\u2019t this a secret no matter how I look at it?\u201cI need your help, Mr. Rudger.\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\u201cCurrently, rumors about <The Almighty Stone> are spreading among the students. I mean, everyone in Theon already knows.\u201dI nodded, because that was the question that Aidan posed to me right after today\u2019s class was over. At the time, I thought it was just a rumor and told the students to work hard.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with that?\u201d\u201cIn the first place, this rumor was not meant to be spread.\u201dOh, was it really like that?\u201cThe fact that rumors of a Relic, which should have been kept secret, spread, means that inside information has leaked out.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re saying that someone didn\u2019t keep the secrecy properly?\u201d\u201cYeah. The Almighty Stone is a relic with so much power that it needs to be stored regularly.\u201dTo sum up the president\u2019s words, <The Almighty Stone> exists and it\u2019s a powerful relic that emits strong power by itself. It\u2019s kept in a secret place out of reach, but because of the power that the Relic itself emits, it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a storage box or a place.\u2018Of course, periodic maintenance and repair work is essential.\u2019If so, while fixing the storage location, the relic must be moved to another location for a while and then brought back, but the problem is that information leaked out during the process. That eventually became a rumor and circulated among the students.\u201cSomeone is intentionally leaking information.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d\u201cIt is for this reason that I called Mr. Rudger. I need your help.\u201dI think I can understand what the president is talking about. She wants me to find the person who leaked the information.I nodded right away.\u201cAll right.\u201d\u201cYou accepted it surprisingly easily.\u201dThe president opened her eyes wide as if she didn\u2019t think I would agree right away.\u2018I have to do it so that the president won\u2019t doubt me.\u2019The president really believed in me, so she entrusted me with this job. Thanks to my identity and my status as a former military officer I was her best choice. Although she is still suspicious of me, and it is highly likely that she will use this as an excuse to find the secrets I have hidden.\u2018In that case, it\u2019s better to just silently accept it without making a fuss.\u2019In order to receive her trust, I first needed to show that I was on her side. Trust in each other is not a one-way street, but a two-way exchange.\u2018In the long term, it is better to maintain a good relationship with the president. If I obtain her trust my days in Theon will be way easier.\u2019The reason I answered right away was because such a calculation was in place. Of course, it emphasizes the aspect of a soldier who simply silently carries out the orders of his superiors without showing it outwardly.\u201cMr. Rudger pay attention to the rumors and if anyone makes any suspicious movements, please let me know right away. Other than that, you\u2019ll need to transport the relic.\u201d\u201cAll right. When can I start moving?\u201d\u201cThe sooner the better.\u201d\u201cAre there any other teachers involved in this case besides me?\u201d\u201cThere are, but first of all, you will not have to face each other because your responsibilities are different.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dIf there are others, why are you calling me a new teacher? You seem to be on the fence about me. I went against Mr. Hugo\u2019s faction through a bet with Mr. Chris, but was that not enough?\u201cFor now, Mr. Rudger, please act as usual. You still have time to move the relic.\u201d\u201cAll right.\u201dWhen the Relic is taken out of a safe place the forces that intentionally spread the rumors will be aiming for it and that faction is very likely to be the Black Dawn.\u2018Things are going to be fun. For now, let me, nominally the First Order of the Black Dawn, be tasked with finding the members of the organization.\u2019Was it a coincidence or was it intentional? If it\u2019s the latter, maybe the president thinks I wouldn\u2019t be able to do this if I was a traitor but that is a mistake.\u2018No one wants to oust the Black Dawn from Theon as much as I do.\u2019They are like shackles to me because I don\u2019t know when or where they will suddenly do something crazy. If they find out I\u2019m an imposter, they\u2019ll do anything to kill me.\u2018Let\u2019s take this opportunity to check out how great the Black Dawn is.\u2019I did a great job hiring an assistant in advance since she is a Black Dawn minion.\u201cI will contact you later.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dI got up from my seat, bowed my head, and left the president\u2019s office.* * *After Rudger left the office president Elisa Willow stopped filing her papers at the sound of a knock on the door and lifted her head.\u201cCome in.\u201dWith her permission, the door opened quietly and Wilford with a silver tray in one hand entered the president\u2019s office. On the tray were freshly brewed hot tea and cookies.\u201cEat.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cThis is my job.\u201dElisa stretched out to relieve her body, then immediately picked up a cookie and put it in her mouth.\u201cWhoa. It\u2019s always good to taste Grandpa\u2019s cooking skills.\u201d\u201cYou look pretty tired.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dShe is the president who usually does not show her feelings, but Wilford was an exception. He had been her loyal supporter for a long time.\u201cSo, did Mr. Rudger Chelici accept the offer?\u201d\u201cYes, he accepted quite easily.\u201dElisa thought Rudger would ask her some questions but he accepted without saying anything.\u201cA soldier who absolutely obeys the orders of his superiors\u2026\u2026You could say that.\u201dAt first, she was skeptical of Rudger Chelici because she knew that suspicious people infiltrated Theon. Their existence was so subtle that it was hard to tell whether they were a user, a student, or a teacher and for this reason, Elisa put the new teachers on the line, especially Rudger, whose past history is relatively ambiguous but after seeing the duel she had no choice but to change her mind.\u201cIt was surprising that my eyes didn\u2019t work. If you look at his behavior, it must be that his mental strength is that strong.\u201dHis evaluation among students was overwhelmingly good. In particular, the magic \u2018source code\u2019 that he made was enough to stimulate Elisa\u2019s curiosity even though she had only heard of it. She would have gone to Rudger before anyone else if she wasn\u2019t the president.\u201cHa-ha. Did I not tell you that? He is a trustworthy person.\u201d\u201cYou were suspicious at first, too.\u201d\u201cIt was until I went to meet him at the station.\u201dElisa was skeptical because she didn\u2019t trust Rudger, but she still thought it was okay for her to trust him now because he made Hugo faction, which had been bothering her like a thorn in the eye, more embarrassed than anyone else. With that alone, she was able to relieve the stress of a year of working as president.She still can\u2019t completely trust him, that\u2019s why she gave him this task.\u2018Mr. Rudger, this is the last time. Please show me more than I expected.\u2019The president muttered and ate the cookie.* * *As I was reading a thesis in the office, I raised my head at the sound of a knock on the door.\u201cWho is it?\u201d\u201cThis is Sedina, sir. I came here after finishing the assignments.\u201d\u201cCome in.\u201dI let Sedina open the door and come in. There was a feeling of tiredness on her face after she had completed the 80-person assignment, but there was also a sense of pride that she had accomplished it nonetheless.\u201cHere is a summary.\u201d\u201cYes. It was a lot of work.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dI took off the rimless spectacles that were on my face and carefully looked at the material that Sedina had put together.\u201cHmm. No problem. You did well.\u201d\u201cOh, no. It was convenient because I just had to organize it.\u201d\u201cGood work. Now go and rest.\u201d\u201cAh yes! Thank you!\u201dSedina\u2019s face brightened at my compliments, and she left the office with exhilarating steps. Left alone again, I cleared the pile of homework that Sedina had been organizing, then turned my head to look out the window.The sun was setting and the sky was darkening and the starlight shining on it was so dazzling that it was hard to see it when I was living on Earth.Is it already night?\u2018The president will call me again in the next few days.\u2019A relic is kept in Theon and the Black Dawn is aiming for it. The President had been aware of the existence of the Black Dawn. Perhaps this will be the first proper fight between Theon and the Black Dawn.\u2018I can\u2019t make a quick decision as I haven\u2019t decided what to do yet, but I\u2019m sure this is a big turning point.\u2019Even though it was the largest magic academy on the continent, I could not have imagined that there would be a Relic in such a place.Relics are not simple objects, they contain enormous mysteries that even wizards cannot figure out now.I took the medicine out of the medicine cabinet and poured it into my mouth. I felt my magical energy fill up with a refreshing feeling, and something came to my mind, so I pulled out an item from my pocket.The president thought that I had heard a lot about Relics because I was a military officer, but in reality, that is not the case. There\u2019s only one reason why I wasn\u2019t very surprised when I heard about the Relic.\u2018Is it a Relic?\u2019I took out a piece of metal of unknown material that looks like a fragment from something round from my pocket.\u2018I didn\u2019t know I would find it in a place like this.\u2019I also had a relic. To be precise, a \u201cfragment\u201d of a Relic.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She closed her eyes to sleep, but she couldn\u2019t sleep. The time may have come earlier than expected for her now, but it was also because her heart was a little troubled.\u2018Mr. Rudger finally hired her assistant.\u2019It\u2019s not particularly strange. There\u2019s no reason not to hire an assistant for someone as big as Rudger in the first place. However, she felt a bit regretful that the place was not hers but it was something else that kept her concerned.\u2018A book about non-attribute magic.\u2019Rene held the book at the head of the bed and unfolded it while lying down. Inside the book, detailed articles about non-attribute magic were spread out. The part she felt uncomfortable while practicing her magic until now, and the situation she hadn\u2019t realized yet. This book was full of such experiences.For her, who has suffered many inconveniences due to the non-existence of her attributes, this book was a hard-to-find item even with money.\u2018No matter how many times I read it, it still seeps into my heart. Why did Mr. Rudger hand this over to me? And where did he get it?\u2019Obviously, the value of this book is high, no not high but astronomical. Just by bringing it to the Tower and passing it over one could gain enormous wealth and fame for the rest of his life but Rudger didn\u2019t. He said he didn\u2019t write the book himself, and that it was right to return it to its deserving owner.\u2018Then who wrote this book?\u2019Every time Rene opened this book, she felt a strange feeling. The author of the book did not reveal his name. He didn\u2019t even say why he wrote this book.\u2018But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a complete stranger.\u2019It was just a feeling, though. Whenever Rene looked at the writings in the book, her heart felt suffocated. The familiarity and longing for an unknown reason felt in the writing itself and even the sadness that made her heart ache. She couldn\u2019t figure out why she was feeling this.\u2018Strange. I have no idea why I am doing this.\u2019In the end, Rene had no choice but to close the book.\u201cAh! Let\u2019s go to sleep! I don\u2019t have time to worry about this now.\u201dRene dug her blanket up to her head but she still couldn\u2019t sleep, and for hours she had no choice but to toss and turn in the bed.* * *A long time ago, I traveled all over the continent and changed my identity. Sometimes I was a mercenary, sometimes a hunter, sometimes a criminal consultant and many others but here was only one reason I was hiding my true self and wandering around the world.\u2018Relic.\u2019I wandered around the world to find fragments of the Relic I was holding.The sun had completely set and the night sky was full of stars. I sat by the window of the dormitory in my chair under the moonlight.\u2018I got the information that there is a Relic in the Empire and came over, but I guess there must have been another one in Theon.\u2019I feel like I\u2019ve earned an unexpected income. Of course, I don\u2019t think the Relic I\u2019m looking for and the <Almighty Stone> in Theon are the same.These relics are of different types, but there are cases where the effects or performance are completely different. However, the rumor circulating that it is a wish-granting stone must be because there is a good reason for that.\u2018There is no need to covet the Almighty Stone, but I can use this Almighty Stone to search for the Relic fragment I am looking for.\u2019In a way, this was an opportunity. Relics are very rare, so it\u2019s not something I can easily find just because I want to find them. Even I, who wandered the continent for a long time, met countless people and experienced all kinds of events.There are only 3 Relic pieces, including this one that I got through the hardships.\u2018Guessing the size and shape of the Relic, there are four fragments remaining.\u2019A total of 7 pieces must be collected to complete the Relic.\u2018If I do that, obviously I\u2026\u2026.\u2019I stared silently at the \u2018first piece\u2019 I was holding in my hand. When I first got this by chance the remnants of the last power contained in the fragment of the relic showed me a miracle.If only I could reproduce it again\u2026\u2026.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cBeep.\u201dAfter thinking about it, I slowly got up from my seat because a signal came from the crystal ball I had left for Hans to contact me. I put magical energy in my fingertips and poured it lightly into the crystal ball then, the crystal ball shone softly, and a voice came out.[Brother, are you there?]\u201cIs it Hans?\u201dIt was Hans who contacted me. Well, actually, Hans is the only person who personally communicates with me. There will be more later, but not right now.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d[Since brother did all the work, I\u2019ve just finished tidying up.]\u201cThe rest of the organizations.\u201d[Exactly.]Hans\u2019s voice, heard from beyond the crystal ball, contained a sense of reassurance that he had finished his task.\u201cSo what happened?\u201d[For now, there is no one who opposes us. That\u2019s fortunate for us and them.]\u201cWere they unexpectedly tacitly accepting our existence?\u201d[Just the two of us, we divided the existing Ren Society. No, it was actually done by my brother alone.]\u201cEven so, they too have been rolling in the darkness of Leathervelk for a long time. They cannot be ignored.\u201d[I know. Well, in the first place, I am not interested in supremacy or anything like that, just having enough space to sit down is enough.]\u201cEven so, there must have been quite a bit of talk about the powers that the Red Society already had, right?\u201dThe Red Society was in charge of all sorts of dirty businesses like drugs, alcohol and gambling in Leathervelk underworld. Even with drugs, the bars and gambling establishments operated by the Red Society were large enough to circulate large sums of money.The wall that protected them disappeared overnight, so the surroundings must have become quite noisy. There must be some people who will reach out their hand trying to get a share of the profits. Guys who couldn\u2019t even dare to show their faces before would raise their heads one by one.It was truly a time of chaos and if at this time, someone does not appear and calms the chaos, the smell of blood will spread in the darkness of Leathervelk.[For now, the other three organizations are working together to suppress it, but I think we need to discuss this later.]\u201cI will.\u201d[For once, their side took the initiative, but anyway, I am not in the mood to negotiate by myself so I need your help.]\u201cWhen?\u201d[The sooner the better, but it\u2019s not urgent. I want you to decide what you are comfortable with.]That being said, I also know that the grace period should not be too long. I\u2019ll need to get to the negotiating table in at least a week although in my mind, it would be more convenient to move right now.\u2018There are things related to the Almighty Stone, so it would be unreasonable right now.\u2019Sooner or later, the Almighty Stone will be moved out of its original storage area to a temporary storage area. Perhaps it can be said that those who lead this work already know the time and place when the Almighty Stone will be moved.\u2018The Black Dawn\u2019s actions are certain, but the question is who the hell is leading this.\u2019I haven\u2019t received any contact yet. If there was an issue, Sedina would have notified me right away.\u2018I don\u2019t know yet whether the First Order other than me was doing things in their own line, or if there was another reason.\u2019However, one thing is certain: the events surrounding this Almighty Stone will surely erupt sooner or later so I can\u2019t leave Theon right now.\u201cI\u2019ll need a week.\u201d[What happened there?]\u201cIt has to do with a Relic.\u201dAs Hans has a keen ear for information, he immediately understood the word Relic.[Brother is a good teacher, but you seem to be going through more incidents than before.]\u201cI agree.\u201d[Even so, a Relic. Hmm\u2026Who would have known that Theon kept a relic?]\u201cBecause it is a place with so much history and tradition.\u201d[According to the rumors, there is also a secret dungeon created by the first president, isn\u2019t it real?]\u201cHans, stop talking nonsense.\u201d[I\u2019m kidding. Anyway, I\u2019ll try to arrange the negotiation time a week later.]\u201cYes. Do your best.\u201dAfter I finished talking to Hans, I looked out the window without saying a word.\u2018Is it a Relic?\u2019It\u2019s not meant to be, but I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll get caught up in an incident related to the Relic. The thought of whether this is fate or not comes to mind and the moonlight floating in the night sky felt unusually chilly today.* * *\u201cPrincess, shall we prepare a bath?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cDo you want to eat?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not hungry.\u201d\u201cWhat about snacks?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t need anything, just leave me alone.\u201dAt Erendir\u2019s command, the servants nodded their heads and retreated, although they did not know what to do.\u201cUh-huh.\u201dErendir, who was barely left alone, let out a small sigh so that the users could not hear it. If anyone ever heard her sigh, they would stick around and annoy her.Erendir, who was finally freed from the gaze of others, entered her room.\u2018It\u2019s hard.\u2019When the other students were allocated dormitories, the princess was assigned a large mansion and was living there. No matter how much she treats everyone equally, she dared not ignore the blood of her imperial family but Erendir was dissatisfied with that.\u2018I also wanted to live a normal life like other students.\u2019She honestly wanted to make new friends, and spend an exciting academy life. However, her position as the 3rd princess did not allow her to. Her grandiose mansion was the second-largest, and the hospitality of her over 30 employees was beyond her gratitude and was very uncomfortable.\u2018It is unavoidable.\u2019If she behaves as she pleases, it will only make it harder for the users and maids. In order to be considerate of them, it was necessary to give them a little bit of what they wanted, even if it was uncomfortable.\u2018It\u2019s not to the point that I can\u2019t stand it.\u2019Normally, there would have been a lot of stress, but lately, that has been less, because Erendir has someone she can call her friend.Rene was a cute junior and the fact that she was a commoner made Erendir worried about her but she had no intention of mocking her because of that.Maybe it was because she was friendly with Rene and treated her normally, Erendir felt good because it seemed like she was living the life she wanted little by little.\u2018I hope to increase the number of friends like this one by one in the future.\u2019At least in this place, she can escape from her sister\u2019s stern touch.As she was thinking about it, someone knocked on her door. Erendir, who had been relaxed, asked in a solemn voice, as she straightened up.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u201cPrincess, I got a message from outside.\u201dIt was impossible to contact the princess directly unless someone had a fairly high status.\u2018I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not your sister, is it?\u2019Although they\u2019re heirs to the same throne, the 1st princess and Erendir did not have a particularly bad relationship. In fact, since the 1st princess had confirmed her right to the throne, there was no competition between her brothers and sisters.Especially since Erendir didn\u2019t really want that kind of place in the first place. However, her older sister showed that she cared for Erendir so much that it was strange. She sometimes went too far with her.\u2018I\u2019m not my sister\u2019s doll.\u2019There was no reason for Erendir to come to Theon, or to escape from her older sister\u2019s interference. In a way, it was natural to worry about whether she was trying to interfere even within Theon but fortunately, the one who contacted her was not the 1st princess.\u201cIt\u2019s Trina Ryanhowl.\u201d\u201cTrina the Knight Commander?\u201dIt was unexpected to be contacted by her. She never thought that the one considered the strongest knight in the Exilion Empire would reach out to her.\u201cBring it.\u201dThe user immediately brought the contact crystal ball she had prepared then he nodded her head and stepped back.Erendir activated the crystal ball when she confirmed that no one was present.\u201cYou wanted to speak with Knight Commander Trina?\u201d[Sorry for calling you late at night Princess Erendir but it\u2019s an emergency.]\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Rather, I was curious as to why the knight commander suddenly contacted me. What\u2019s going on?\u201d[I heard that there was an incident where a werewolf appeared in Theon recently. Did you hear about it princess?]She had met the werewolf and if Rudger had not appeared to help, she might have been seriously injured, however if she said that the knight commander would start talking about her safety so she decided to hide the fact for now.\u201cYes I heard but it was resolved quickly.\u201d[A werewolf also appeared here in Leathervelk.]\u201cYes? Sir Trina is in Leathervelk now?\u201d[Yes. We are investigating a case related to that case.]\u201cIs it\u2026\u2026?\u201d[Please forgive me for not being able to inform the princess because it is a secret investigation.]\u201cI understand.\u201dThe fact that Trina came out meant that she was moved by the sheriff\u2019s office.[While I was investigating the case, it was confirmed that this werewolf incident was not normal.]\u201cNot normal?\u201d[Someone did this on purpose. The moment I checked and traced them, the clues were destroyed.]Trina Ryanhowl\u2019s powerful voice echoed through the room from beyond the crystal ball.[Princess, may I know who solved the werewolf case in Theon?]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Well, a Theon teacher solved it.\u201d[Do you know who the teacher is?]Erendir answered Trina\u2019s question without thinking.\u201cMr. Rudger Chelici, a new teacher.\u201d[Hmm\u2026Okay.]\u201cDid it help?\u201d[Yes. First of all, I will have to meet the teacher named Rudger Chelici as soon as possible.]\u201cHopefully there will be progress in Sir Trina\u2019s investigation.\u201d[Thank you for helping me princess.]\u201cYes.\u201d[Princess Erendir.]\u201cYeah?\u201dAs I was about to hang up, Trina Ryanhowl called me as if she had just remembered something.[The 1st princess wants to contact you. She said she was upset that you hadn\u2019t contacted her recently, and she asked me to let you know.]\u201cI understand.\u201d[Goodbye.]After the call ended, Erendir shrugged her shoulders and had no choice but to let out a sigh. The fact that her older sister, the 1st princess, is looking for her, made her uncomfortable.The fact that she spoke her words through Trina also made it clear that her older sister was as caring as possible and he might have to say hello.\u2018Will Sir Trina come to Theon?\u2019The werewolf incident seemed more serious than expected, if not the Security Bureau, even the head of the Security Bureau\u2019s, would not be able to move directly.If there is something to be gained by visiting Theon, that alone is a good thing so Erendir didn\u2019t think about it any further.* * *\u201cHow is it?\u201dHer lieutenant Lloyd, who had been waiting for Trina to finish her call, asked, a light flashing through his glasses.\u201cThe 3rd princess said that a teacher solved the werewolf situation in Theon.\u201d\u201cYou mean the teacher of Theon?\u201d\u201cShe also said that this is a new teacher who has just been appointed. I guess I\u2019ll have to meet him in person and talk to him.\u201d\u201cWill you go right away?\u201dAt Lloyd\u2019s question, Trina I shook her head.\u201cThe investigation in Leathervelk is not over yet. Enya, do you have anything special to report?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dEnya, who was waiting, responded vigorously and stepped out.\u201cOnce upon a time, it seems certain that the burned-out factory area was a secret laboratory that researched or developed something.\u201d\u201cWhat matters is who was there and what was going on.\u201d\u201cSo far\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cWhat else?\u201d\u201cUgh. Other than that, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything else that\u2019s been out of the ordinary, except for the noise of Leathervelk\u2019s dark side.\u201d\u201cThe dark streets are noisy.\u201dKnights are on a stage that gets everyone\u2019s attention, but they are different from the Security Bureau. Since they\u2019ve seen a lot of dirty things, their connections with the dark district were deeper than normal. In fact, the place where they got the most information from this situation was also in the dark district.At Trina\u2019s words, Enya sighed slightly and continued the report.\u201cWell, this time, something a bit unusual happened.\u201d\u201cSomething unusual?\u201d\u201cThe dark district of Leathervelk was dominated by the Red Society, you know?\u201d\u201cI have heard of it. It\u2019s a little annoying, but we didn\u2019t feel the need to go out and get rid of it, so we left it alone. However, I remember it was quite large.\u201d\u201cYeah. It is said that recently the Red Society was destroyed in one day.\u201d\u201cOne day?\u201dIn the darkness that exists behind the city all kinds of organizations are fighting, so it\u2019s not particularly strange that many died. However, the Red Society is big to the extent that it is called an \u2018organization\u2019. Since they disappeared overnight even Trina could not help but be curious.\u201cThat\u2019s kind of interesting. Do you think it has anything to do with this case?\u201d\u201cThat doesn\u2019t seem to be the case. However, it seems that a very talented person appeared in the dark district of Leathervelk, so I think it would be better to keep an eye on it for the time being. It might be a threat to the Empire.\u201dSeeing that the organization called Red Society was wiped out in one day, there must have been quite a few talented people involved. Or was there even a wizard involved?Contrary to Enya\u2019s concern, Trina shook her head.\u201cThere\u2019s no need to worry about it at the moment. We will focus on our investigation now.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cOnce it is confirmed that there is nothing more to be found in Leathervelk, we will head straight to Theon.\u201d\u201cAll right.\u201dAfter her lieutenants left Trina crossed her arms and tapped her fingers in her arms.\u2018Is it Theon?\u2019Although she did not speak to the lieutenants, Trina had been paying attention to Theon since she spoke with the princess a while ago. She was convinced that there was a clue in Theon. It was just her intuition, so she didn\u2019t have to tell her lieutenants.\u2018I\u2019ll have to go there to find out more about it.\u2019Her senses kept telling her that there was something in Theon.* * *Even after the president told me about the Almighty Stone, rumors about the stone that grant wishes still circulated in Theon. No, it was actually much worse than before.\u2018Is someone instigating rumors?\u2019It was difficult to pinpoint exactly who it was since the number of people living in the large campus called Theon reached four digits. Although it was called the Academy, it is actually like a small city, so it is realistically impossible to check all the people here.Even the rumors spread through the Akashic Records, which can only be used by students, and the security of anonymity is so strict that it is difficult to find the source.\u2018In this case, it would be better to deal with the Almighty Stone quickly and end the situation.\u2019Slowly, some of the students started asking, \u2018Shall we also look for the stone?\u2019Maybe they didn\u2019t realize anything during the last werewolf incident, or they think they\u2019re different but there was an increasing trend of students who were not faithful to their studies and focused on the strange rumors.\u2018For now, there are no people who crossed the line yet, so I\u2019m leaving it alone, but that won\u2019t last long.\u2019They were told to stay inside during the werewolf incident, but it was convenient as all I had to do was catch the werewolf out there. But honestly, I was not in a position to say anything about the Almighty Stone.It doesn\u2019t matter who gets hurt by looking for it. Rather, if we tried to prevent this further, the students might even doubt the existence of the Almighty Stone.\u2018The president will take care of this part anyway.\u2019Just as a student has student duties, as a teacher, I have teacher duties.\u201cConcentrate.\u201dAs usual, when I speak with a little force, their eyes gather. However, I don\u2019t feel the same enthusiasm as at the beginning of the semester.I must have raised the initial expectations too high with the source code and since then, I\u2019ve only summarized the contents of the textbook, rather than teaching new magic.Among the things I taught, there was <Sensation of the Elements>, but it seems that it was not enough for students who are at the age of learning. In the eyes of some students, dissatisfaction with the class is starting to pile up. In the end, I had no choice but to close the textbook in my hand aloud.\u201cA lot of people seem bored, so today I\u2019ll show you something fun and refreshing.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dSlowly, the students who were about to put their heads down on the desks raised their heads at my words. They\u2019re starting to take an interest now.\u2018It reminds me of the past.\u2019When I was living on Earth, there was a time when I was also a student. I woke up at 6:30 in the morning, listened to the 0 class, and worked until 10 pm.I spent 15 hours a day studying. It was so desperate, but there were certainly times when I couldn\u2019t stand the boredom of continuing the class. At that time, the teachers always tried to soothe the boredom of the students by talking about topics that were not related to the class.\u201cWhen magicians use magic, it always revolves around themselves.\u201dWhen I took the rhyme, the students responded by asking what I was talking about but I ignored it and continued.\u201cTypically elemental magic always revolves around the user.\u201dWith that said, I used the first-tier fire magic [Pyro]. A small spark of fire erupted from the tip of my finger. This is a basic magic that doesn\u2019t even require complicated techniques, so there\u2019s nothing to be surprised about. However,\u201cIf you put your hands on this magic a little, this is possible.\u201dI extinguished the sparks that rose from my fingertips, and then immediately activated the magic again.This time, it was the same first-class fire magic [Pyro] but the difference was that the fire this time was not on my hand, but at a place quite a distance away from me.\u201cWow?!\u201dOne of the students, who was almost on the verge of falling asleep, screamed in amazement when he saw the flames rising right in front of him but no one looked at the student and laughed at him.Everyone\u2019s eyes turned to the flame floating in the air as if nailed.\u201cWhat is that?\u201d\u201cThe distance is 10 m away, but there was a spark?\u201d\u201cHow did teacher do it?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that a scam?\u201dI knew such a word would come out, so I immediately disarmed the Pyro and activated another magic. Tiny electricity splashed around the classroom, water droplets were created and the wind whirled around.I activated multiple spells in different locations. It was then that the students\u2019 eyes turned to me as if they really realized there was something. Silence fell in the classroom and the sound of someone swallowing saliva could be heard.\u201cDo you have any questions?\u201dThen most of the students raised their hands, it was the opposite of their reactions from a while ago. I smiled to myself and pointed to a student.\u201cWhat are you curious about?\u201d\u201cTeacher, how did you do that magic?\u201d\u201cThe intent of the question is ambiguous.\u201dAt my point, the student cleared his mind and opened his mouth again.\u201cNormal magic is centered on the caster. Because mana that is the raw material for magic comes from the caster.\u201dI nodded.\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cBut teacher\u2019s magic was activated at a distance beyond common sense.\u201dMost of them will be curious about that so I decided to show it again.\u201cCome on, look at this magic.\u201dI set a spark on the palm of my hand.\u201cAlthough it is said that the magic is centered on the caster, this magic did not come into contact with my skin. To be precise, it was condensed in the air about 5 centimeters above my palm.\u201d\u201cEven so, there is such a thing as degree.\u201dAnother girl cut in the middle but I didn\u2019t mean to point it out or criticize it.\u201cUsually, the limit is up to 1m, it\u2019s virtually impossible to go from this pulpit to the very back of the classroom.\u201d\u201cBut Mr. Rudger\u2026\u2026.\u201dI did that so I understand what students are saying. The magic I showed them was a mystery that they couldn\u2019t comprehend.\u201cIn the end, the principle is similar to what I\u2019m showing you now.\u201dI extinguished the flame floating on the palm of my hand.\u201cIt is said that 1m is the limit, but it is not impossible to go beyond that. The consumption of mana will increase dramatically however, if the principle is different, it is quite possible, like I just did.\u201dInstead of manifesting magic around the caster I used a method of invoking a spell at a specific coordinate.\u201cThis is the coordinate designation method.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It\u2019s Mr. Rudger after all! Inventing such magic!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cLeo? Leo!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dWhen Leo, who would have usually answered, did not say anything, Aidan shook Leo\u2019s shoulder.\u201cLeo, are you okay?\u201d\u201cUh huh?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cAidan, you\u2026\u2026Do you know how great that magic is?\u201d\u201cYes? Why? It\u2019s great, but is it something surprising?\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201dLeo sighed and shook his head.Sometimes, like Aidan, he thought how comfortable it would be to be in a position where he didn\u2019t know what to do.As Leo knew a lot, it was hard to keep up with the groundbreaking magic that Rudger had shown him now.\u2018It\u2019s magic that transcends space. What the hell is that teacher?\u2019Leo was even more suspicious of Rudger\u2019s identity.Like Leo, there were some students who were surprised to see Rudger\u2019s magic. The more you know, the more you see. One of the representative examples was Flora Lumos.\u2018What?\u2019For a moment, a sweet scent lingered on the tip of her nose, but she almost lost her mind. Not only that. All kinds of colors appeared in front of her in a complex way, and she felt like her vision was paralyzed. Synesthesia of magic, her innate talent, was confusing her at this moment.\u2018I\u2019ve never seen such magic.\u2019Although there was little to learn, Rudger\u2019s magic was unique. The magic which she has felt through synesthesia, has always felt like seeing a picture in a frame. Looking at it, she could tell how magic was made.However, the magic that Rudger was using now was different from usual. To put it bluntly, rather than looking like art, it felt like being in the center of the fireworks display. Firecrackers exploding from all directions and colorful lights dazzle the eyes. Flora had a hard time staying sane.\u2018Where the hell did you get that kind of magic\u2026.?\u2019Flora closed her eyes tightly without realizing it, but regret flooded in. She wanted to see that magic a little more and feel that pleasure againWith that thought, she opened her eyes and then closed them again due to excessive stimulation.Princess Erendir stared at the magic with a serious face and Rene next to her, shed pure exclamation. Julia Plumhart had a normal face, but her squinted eyes were sharper than usual.After receiving the attention of all the students, Rudger stopped his magic.\u201cWhat is it? Are you a little intrigued?\u201dThe students could not answer Rudger\u2019s question because they were still immersed in the magic he showed them.\u201cIt must be quite a strange and surprising magic to you, but in this wide world, this magic is only a very small part because this is nothing more than a slightly modified form of magic.\u201dAt Rudger\u2019s words, the students had no choice but to doubt their ears for a moment but Rudger was sincere. He said that in the first place, this coordinate designation magic he used was nothing compared to the \u2018real magic\u2019 he was familiar with.\u201cThis magic that I have used is nothing more than a trick inspired by the magic of a wizard.\u201d\u201cOh my god.\u201d\u201cIs that really true?\u201dRudger nodded his head at the students\u2019 questions. There was no need to lie or brag about this.\u201cThere are far more unknown magic\u2019s in the world and anyone here can create and develop their own magic.\u201dIt was so easy to say, but none of the students looked down on Rudger\u2019s magic. Even if there are things that you see and feel inspired by, changing them into your own is another thing.\u201cOf course, I did not show you this magic to teach you.\u201dAt Rudger\u2019s words, some students shed tears of regret. Since it was a new magic that was shown after the source code, the students had expectations.\u201cAren\u2019t you going to tell us about the principle?\u201d\u201cIf you are curious, think and analyze for yourself.\u201d\u201cThen why did you show it?\u201d\u201cI hope you see this and realize something.\u201dSome of the students looked at why he showed them something he wouldn\u2019t teach, but Rudger also had an intention.\u201cI also made this magic based on inspiration from someone else. After all, magic isn\u2019t just about having your own creations.\u201dIt is clear that magic is born anew by imitating others\u2019 magic. It was so difficult and virtually impossible to create it from zero. That is why Rudger showed his magic to his students.\u201cDon\u2019t try to make magic too difficult and complicated. Of course, if you dig really deep, it will give you a headache, but sometimes you should simply look at it.\u201dRudger\u2019s words awakened the minds of the students. The reason Rudger has shown this magic is to evoke the mindset of students who are tired of this boring class.\u201cOf course, there will be some students who are genuinely curious about this magic that I have manifested. There are also students who are already analyzing it.\u201dMany students changed their expressions at his words.\u201cSo, if you are curious, focus on class. What you need above all else is a solid foundation to perfectly sublimate the enlightenment you have gained from so you can turn others\u2019 magic into your own.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026A solid foundation.\u201d\u201cIs it real?\u201d\u201cHe who has the right foundation will be able to analyze and use magic properly in the future when he wants to.\u201dSome students, who had little motivation to learn and thought the class was boring, had no choice but to reflect on their attitude.\u201cI will give you a hint, the coordinate designation magic uses the concept of space. Think about how to perceive the space around you, and how to send the magic to it.\u201d\u201cIs that homework?\u201dSomeone raised their hand and asked. It was Flora Lumos, who still couldn\u2019t get rid of her shock at the magic that Rudger showed.Rudger stared at her for a moment, then nodded his head with an expressionless face.\u201cYou might see it that way. If you can see and analyze my magic and even vaguely imitate it, it is proof that you have followed my instructions well.\u201dFlora couldn\u2019t quite make up her mind about her teacher.\u201cIf you think you have mastered this magic, just come to me and show me. If you do, I will give you extra points.\u201dThe last words he left behind were enough to inspire the students\u2019 subdued motivation.\u201cToday\u2019s class ends here. Everyone seems pretty tired, so I won\u2019t give you an assignment today. It seems that the magic I showed you has already become a sufficient task for you.\u201d\u201cWow!\u201dWhen he said that there was no homework, the students raised their hands and cheered. For students who take several classes each week, the reality is that the assignments in each class are very heavy.The students, who were already excited about the fact that there was no homework, grumbled among themselves.\u201cThen, until the next class, prepare and review thoroughly. Today\u2019s class ends here.\u201d\u201cYes! Thank you!\u201dRudger nodded his head at the students\u2019 loud replies and left the classroom.* * *After class, I returned to the office and sat down in my seat. Sedina, who had glanced at me, slowly approached me.\u201cI, sir\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cDone. Just go.\u201d\u201cYeah?\u201d\u201cThe work for today is over, so you can go back and rest.\u201d\u201cAh yes.\u201dI guess she was worried because I looked a little tired. It\u2019s a one-sided relationship, but she is still cute when I look at her.Right now, I\u2019m more comfortable being alone. Sedina dared not disobey my orders, answered in a small voice and left the office. After being completely alone, I paused for a moment and picked up the teacher\u2019s crystal ball on the table.\u2018It\u2019s time for the story of the Almighty Stone to come out.\u2019The Almighty Stone is a \u2018Relic\u2019 and the source of the rumor that has heated up Theon.The president said that she would put the Almighty Stone in a simple storage place and then bring it back to its original place and that she needed my help along the way.From what she said, the process itself didn\u2019t seem to take too long, so it was time for the president to contact me.\u201cBeep.\u201dSeeing the crystal ball sending a signal, I immediately activated it.\u201cYes, President.\u201d[Mr. Rudger, it\u2019s a big deal.]Big deal? The president\u2019s voice was quite serious, contrary to what I had expected. I also adjusted my posture and waited for her next words.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d[The Almighty Stone has been stolen.]\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d* * *The incident happened even before I stood at the start line. Looks like they did not expect that Black Dawn would move so quickly.After thinking for a moment, I asked in a cautious tone.\u201cWhat exactly happened?\u201d[I looked down on the enemies.]\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d[They are infiltrated deeper into Theon than I thought.]\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dAfter listening to the conversation, I understood why the president was saying that. The Almighty Stone existence was a secret known only by a few people.Even if the rumors got out, she thought it would be ok to quickly bring it back to its original location and that was a mistake. The enemies already knew the location of the storage area, and took action before the president started her plan.Currently, the assailants who stole the Almighty Stone are hiding inside Theon. She said that they are quickly chasing after them, but she doesn\u2019t know when they will be caught.[Above all, if they use the Almighty Stone, the situation will get out of control.]\u201cSurely it will.\u201dI don\u2019t know how powerful the Almighty Stone is, but it\u2019s a Relic, so it can\u2019t be denied that it\u2019s a very dangerous object. What if the ones who took the Almighty Stone use it the wrong way? There could be huge casualties.But to declare a state of emergency for the entire Theon would be absurd since it will cause the students to panic. Besides, making this fact known may damage the reputation of Theon. There\u2019s already been a lot of talk about the werewolf incident, and they can\u2019t attract more attention now.This is a battle against time and we must put out the flames before they spread.\u201cWhen do you think the golden hour is?\u201d[Midnight today.]\u201cOkay.\u201d[\u2026\u2026Aren\u2019t you going to ask more than that?]\u201cIt would be better to move right away.\u201dI left those words and hung up the phone with the president.I can\u2019t act like other people in things that might get me involved too. Relics are dangerous weapons that can blow up a city if used incorrectly and there is no guarantee that the aftermath will not affect me and if I run away now, I will also be accused of being an accomplice.\u201cWhoa.\u201dI sighed and turned off the sound barrier I had put on before I spoke to the president.\u201cSedina.\u201dAs I called out in a low voice I could feel a fluttering presence through the door. I knew long ago that she had not left and was waiting in front of the door.\u201cCome in.\u201dThis was good because I needed to get information.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was an undeniable fact that, as Rudger said, they did things on their own.\u201cExactly what happened?\u201d\u201cOne Second Order\u2026\u2026was trying to get things done on his own.\u201d\u201cTell me from the beginning.\u201dSedina\u2019s slender body trembled at Rudger\u2019s sullen voice but this was not a reaction out of fear instead she felt thrilled.\u201cAt first, a Third Order that was collecting information about some of the users in Theon realized that one of them had made contact with the source of this rumor.\u201dThe Third Order felt drawn by something and kept trying to obtain more information about the relic.\u201cThat\u2019s how they came to know the truth. Somewhere in Theon, a fairly powerful artifact is secretly kept.\u201d\u201cAnd the report must have gone up.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right. The Third Order informed his superior, the Second Order and\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cThe guy who got the report didn\u2019t tell me about it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Yeah.\u201dIf it was about a Relic, it wouldn\u2019t be strange to let the First Order know. However, the Second Order concealed this information and he did his own thing.\u201cDid he think I wouldn\u2019t find out?\u201dSedina hurriedly responded to Rudger\u2019s voice, which felt even a little angry.\u201cThat\u2019s fine with me\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cWho is this Second Order?\u201d\u201cA man named Demires.\u201dRudger tapped his chin and gestured for more.\u201cAmong the Second Order members, he is closely related to the intelligence department, and he was in charge of that part. However, compared to his own greed, his ability isn\u2019t that great\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cWhat do you think is the reason that Demires did this?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s hard to judge that, but maybe\u2026\u2026I think he is trying to become a First Order by making a big play.\u201d\u201cBecome a First Order?\u201d\u201cYes. Our Black Dawn founder, the Zero Order, created 7 seats for the First Orders, and said that they could change at any time.\u201dWhen the story of the First Orders came out, Sedina\u2019s excitement rose without her knowing because the First Orders are the object of her respect, which she looks up to. The same goes for this man in front of her now.\u201cRight now, the First Orders are firmly holding their positions, but there are not a few Second Orders aiming for that position.\u201d\u201cRight.\u201dRudger nodded his head, while thinking about the system of the Black Dawn. I thought they were simply notorious bastards who were cruel to traitors, but there are other harsh rules like this inside.\u2018Anyone who is culled or who doesn\u2019t do his job properly will lose his place.\u2019That being said, perhaps even the current First Orders may have already taken someone\u2019s place. However, the thing I am most curious about is the existence of the Zero Order who founded this organization. Who the hell was he to make these crazy rules?\u2018He is confident that he will not lose his place.\u2019There must be a basis for that conviction and the sure reason must be that he has faith in his own strength. I don\u2019t know what kind of guy it is, but the one to watch out for the most is the Zero Order.\u201cSo what is the situation now?\u201d\u201cIt seems that Demires did the job by calling other 3rd Orders who agreed with his opinion. Before the artifact was moved, he raided the storage area, stole the items, and is currently on the run.\u201d\u201cWhere?\u201d\u201cIn this situation I can\u2019t find his location but he must be close.\u201d\u201cIt seems he didn\u2019t left Theon.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dRudger lightly stroked his chin with his hand. The fact that Sedina did not confirm Demires\u2019 whereabouts until the end was because the situation was so urgent that he didn\u2019t have time to report.Considering the time the president contacted me, it can be said that the incident has not occurred in a long time. However, seeing that the president needs help, he must have escaped quite well because he was a member of a secret society.Rudger turned his head and looked out his window. Now the sun is slowly setting and the night is coming, that would make tracking even more difficult.\u201cI have to move slowly.\u201d\u201cThat\u2026\u2026! Fir, no, is teacher going to act?\u201d\u201cI guess so. I have to deal with this situation before it escalates.\u201d\u201cWhat shall I do then?\u201dSedina mustered up the courage to ask but Rudger said she didn\u2019t have to do anything, and that made her uncomfortable.\u201cNothing.\u201d\u201cYeah?\u201d\u201cYou did your job well enough just to let me know this fact.\u201d\u201cI?\u201dShe has done her part well enough. Sedina didn\u2019t expect those words to come out from Rudger\u2019s mouth.No, she wondered if she had ever heard these words properly in her life.\u201cIs that really true?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dRudger answered without hesitation.\u201cYou did well.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dAt those words Sedina felt something inside. It was the first time she was recognized by someone. She was always treated like garbage, so she tried to run away from her family.She thought several times that maybe this may be her own limit however, Rudger acknowledged her. Her eyes were red and she looked like she was about to cry but she desperately endured it because she couldn\u2019t show such an ugly face in front of the person she respected the most.Rudger wore his long black coat hanging from his hanger.\u201cDon\u2019t go out. Please clean up.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dHe said passing by Sedina, who had her head bowed down desperately to hold back her tears.* * *I said a few words, so why are you doing that? I shook my head, thinking of Sedina, who was alone in the office.I just said a few words to ease the mood, but she\u2019s crying alone. Even though I didn\u2019t understand it, I thought that it was because she went through so much hardship.She\u2019s trying hard to pretend she\u2019s strong, but it\u2019s just a shell to hide her weak inner feelings.\u2018Is it the Rosen family?\u2019I\u2019ve heard of the Rosen family. Recently they are an emerging power among famous and prestigious families. Although it is not well known externally, it is certain that they used all kinds of dirty methods to grow the family. If I had to rate them I think the head of the family is worse than Bellbot Rickson which I removed with my own hands a while ago.\u2018However, it has nothing to do with me now.\u2019This is clearly Sedina\u2019s personal business. Whether she hates her own family or has anything to do with Julia Plumhart, it has absolutely nothing to do with me.Now she\u2019s acting as my assistant, but after all, our relationship is just a shell. I don\u2019t really need to pay attention to it.\u2018It must be something else more important than that.\u2019The priority is to find the stolen Relic <Almighty Stone>. Since I\u2019ve heard the directions of where the other members of Black Dawn fled, it\u2019s easy to follow them.No matter how wide Theon is, there is plenty of room to hide but that doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t find them. As I got out of the building, I slowly walked down the street and looked up at the sky.When the sun had completely disappeared over the western horizon and night came I stopped walking and looked around but there was no one to see.No, there were students leaving school one by one, and there were people chatting with each other, but it would be correct to say that no one was interested in me, probably, because I am already completely assimilated with the environment around me.\u300cAter Nocturnus\u300dThe black shadow that covered my body flickered, hiding my existence from the surrounding landscape. It\u2019s my original magic called Black Nocturne in Latin.However, oddly enough, this magic is not a dark elemental magic, unlike its appearance. It\u2019s not even part of the <Manifestation> system I teach my students.To be precise, this is a <Summon> system magic, one of the four types of <Summon> magic.There are 4 specializations in <Summon> magic. [Spirit] who inherited the will of nature, [Golem] made of metal and soil, [Soul Code] that invokes and applies the will and the last one is the [Magic Water] that I am using now.All wizards deal with mana and this mana is a mysterious power that has not yet been properly defined.When a person deals with this mysterious power, the magical power itself is affected by the person\u2019s inclination, constitution, life process, user\u2019s wish, or hidden talent. Whatever it may be, all such elements are woven into one, and mana itself has a will and takes the form of a \u2018summoned beast\u2019, that\u2019s magic water.These magical beasts, which have different shapes and abilities, are different from ordinary living things. Even this magical beast that I am calling right now takes the form of \u2018clothes\u2019 and it\u2019s not a normal summoned beast.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dThe shadows on the edge of the coat flowed like ink dissolved in water, and then moved along the ground. Before long, the shadows that were darker than the darkness were spread like a carpet on the ground, making a path and I followed the path he was showing me.\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cIt felt like something just passed by.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t feel anything.\u201dNo one I met in the dark saw me; they were not even aware of my existence. It is one of the abilities of my magical beast, Ater Nocturnus, however, it cannot be used for long. Because my presence is eaten, if I wear it for a long time, it will devour my very existence.I took a pill out of my pocket and shoved it into my mouth since I won\u2019t be able to use it for long due to extreme mana consumption. He obeys my orders, but that doesn\u2019t mean he listens to everything I say. He follows me because I feed him, otherwise he will eat me at any time.\u2018All the magic I use are missing screws.\u2019Since I came to Theon and taught the basics, that fact touches me even more. However, I have no choice but to use it.With that in mind, I continued moving through the darkness.* * *\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cFlora, what\u2019s the matter?\u201dAfter finishing today\u2019s study, Flora Lumos stopped while walking down the street with her childhood friend Cheryl. Cheryl was puzzled by Flora\u2019s sudden action, but Flora did not answer it.\u2018Just now, something passed me by.\u2019She couldn\u2019t see it with her eyes or even feel it. Had she been any other person, she would have mistakenly thought that the wind had blown but Flora didn\u2019t.\u2018Smell.\u2019There was a strong scent of something that moved away from her. It was not just a regular smell, instead it smelled like magic but it was also something she had never seen before. If the usual magic is sweet and stimulating this magic was a little darker and deeper, like black coffee, full of flavor.\u2018What is it? It is magic that is invisible to my eyes.\u2019Flora was a little proud of herself, but curious.\u2018The smell remains.\u2019The smell was like an indicator, guiding her.\u2018Let\u2019s go.\u2019Flora thought up to that point and acted immediately.\u201cFlora? Flora!\u201dCheryl Wagner called out to Flora due her unusual behavior.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Sorry that I\u2019m so slow with the sponsored chapters but I have a list and I won\u2019t miss any chapters. Right now there are 9 chapters and 12$ in queue. I\u2019ll try to do daily releases until I finish all the sponsored chapters.The sun had completely set and night had come. I headed to the depths of the forest where the eyes and footsteps of the students had not reached.The members of the Black Dawn who stole the Almighty Stone were hidden inside this forest.I saw the guards of Theon tracking down the order members near the entrance to the forest, but they were guarding the outside without going inside.I easily broke through the weakly guarded entrance since they were not aware of my existence in the shadows.\u2018There are many dense forests like this inside the campus because this is Theon.\u2019There are three big forests inside Theon. First, the \u2018Secret Forest\u2019 where no living things lived, second, the \u2018Silent Forest\u2019 where all sorts of creepy things and bizarre psychic phenomena appear and third, \u2018The Forest of Dreams\u2019, where all kinds of spirits and supernatural phenomena occur with enormous vitality.The forest itself is an off-limits zone that goes back and forth between risk levels 2 and 3. It\u2019s surprising that such a place exists inside the Academy grounds, but it\u2019s even more surprising that they left it alone.\u2018The safety awareness of people in this world should not be viewed as the same as on Earth in the 21st century. Still, I can\u2019t help but not understand.\u2019I thought I was quite accustomed to living here, still, I can\u2019t help but feel a sense of separation from my previous life.In any case, all three forests are designated as dangerous areas and among them, the place where the men who stole the Almighty Stone ran away is the \u2018Silence Forest\u2019.\u2018A forest full of magical beasts designated as dangerous and powerful.\u2019I heard that this land was used as a cemetery before the founding of Theon. The corpses and death piled up in the cemetery for a long time spread into a supernatural phenomenon due to their magical response after the establishment of Theon.If you enter the wrong way, you will be possessed by a spirit and become a lost child, or you will be forced to \u2018turn around\u2019 because of your thoughts. Anyone who enters will disappear without a sound or rumor. So silence was attached to the name of the forest.In fact, Theon also took action several times with respect to the Silent Forest. It seems that some of the successive presidents argued that this forest should be pushed out because of the dangers.Still, there is only one reason why the Forest of Silence remains and that\u2019s because they all failed.\u2018Was it said that if you cut down a tree, it will grow back the next day?\u2019It is said that some of the fellers went crazy and even wizards with powerful magical powers suffered from nervous breakdowns and nightmares. Even fire doesn\u2019t work because the forest doesn\u2019t burn.Many presidents failed to eliminate the Silent Forest. In the end, they choose to impose an access ban on the forest itself.\u2018However, the Silent Forest has boundaries as if it were drawn with a line. As long as you don\u2019t cross that line, there will be no impact.\u2019It doesn\u2019t matter if you keep looking at the Silent Forest from beyond the border, if you don\u2019t go in, everything \u2018s fine.\u2018Even if the rumors about the forest are exaggerated, there must be some dangers in the Silent Forest. Are they confident or have they\u00a0 been forced to run away there?\u2019I sighed and stopped walking. It\u2019s been quite some time since I entered the silent forest and I started to hear voices.[Die. Die. Die.][Heh heh heh. hate. I hate it.][Help me. Someone get me out of here.]It kept ringing in my head, but I didn\u2019t really care because I\u2019m always going through something worse than this.At this point, it should be okay to dispel the magic so I immediately disarmed \u201cAter Nocturnus\u201d and poured a magic pill into my mouth.\u2018Are they around here?\u2019Whitish spirits flew through the air and wandered around me but they never approached me or did any direct harm to me. Rather, they glanced at me and ran away with a strange scream.I lightly ignored the spirits and searched for traces of the escaped secret society members.\u2018Found them.\u2019There are footprints in the dirt on the wet ground and there are about 5 people.\u2018Unexpectedly, the number of people is less than I thought. I heard there were at least 10 people.\u2019The rest were torn while fleeing, or they could not escape and were caught by the pursuers\u2019 hands. In other words, these five people who managed to escape are the ones with the most proper skills.I followed the footsteps and kept moving.The forest was dark because there was no light, and even the night fog made it hard to have a sense of direction but it didn\u2019t matter to me. I followed the traces of the ground with steady steps and headed deeper into the forest.\u2018People are waiting outside. Right now, they\u2019re just waiting at the entrance to the forest but if they get reinforcements they\u2019ll run right inside.\u2019So before that, I have to finish my work. Not as Teacher Rudger Chelici, but as [John Doe], the First Order of the Black Dawn.\u201cMurmur murmur.\u201dAs I continued walking, I stopped when I heard a sound coming from beyond the hazy mist but this sound is not a sound made by spirits, it\u2019s made by people. After walking along the trail, I finally reached my destination.* * *\u201cDemires, what now?\u201d\u201cThere is a tracking party outside the forest.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right. Besides, in this forest, even just by standing still, your heart will continue to be eroded. We go on like this.\u201d\u201cShut up!\u201dDemires shouted at the words of the Third Order.\u201cI have a plan! So, don\u2019t be silly and just follow along!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe Third Order kept their mouths shut at the words of Demires, who were close to a threat but their anxiety could not be resolved with just a few words.One of their comrades who had already entered this place couldn\u2019t stand the magic of the Silent Forest and went crazy. They couldn\u2019t afford to help either, so they threw him away in the middle of the forest, and they didn\u2019t want to even imagine what would have happened to him.\u2018Damn. If the chase team comes in, we will all die, right?\u2019The Third Orders had the same thoughts in their minds.They believed in the words of the second order, Demires, and followed him but should have already had a gut feeling that things went wrong. Demires did this without informing the First Order with an irresponsible statement that he will take responsibility for everything.\u2018Right now, there are only two First Orders in Theon.\u2019\u2018Even if he\u2019s a second order, can this be fixed?\u2019Everyone closed their mouths and rolled their eyes. In fact, Demires was also worried. He was good until he got the job done, but frankly, he didn\u2019t really care about the aftermath.\u2018Damn! The Almighty Stone it\u2019s useless!\u2019Demires looked down at the fist-sized stone in his right hand. It was because of the Almighty Stone that he was confident in his plan.The stone emitted a mysterious power just by holding it in his hand but that was all. The Almighty Stone exudes power, but granting wishes never happened.\u2018I believed in the power of this stone and did it!\u2019Demires felt like he was standing on the edge of a cliff. His original plan to make a wish and obtain enough power to ascend to a higher position so he even kept it a secret from the First Order.\u2018Damn. How am I supposed to use this?\u2019Obviously, the power flowing out of the stone is real. However, this power is separate and not mixed with the mana he deals with.They separated perfectly, like water and oil and as a result, Demires had no idea how to handle this power. When he made a wish in his heart or used magic power the stone remained silent. At this point, it\u2019s nothing more than a pretty magic stone.Suddenly the sound of stepping on the grass was heard. All the members of the Black Dawn were startled and looked at the place where the sound was coming from.\u201cWho are you?\u201dDemires shouted and a man in a black suit appeared out of the darkness. Everyone thought it was the enemy and they pointed their staff and weapons at him.\u201cAre you all here?\u201dThe members of the Black Dawn trembled unknowingly at the piercing voice full of irritation of the other party. It was kind of a reflex and at the same time they realized who the other person was.Demires, who had become accustomed to the darkness, recognized the other person\u2019s face and hardened his expression.\u201cFir, First Order John Doe!\u201dThe rest of the members recognized Rudger and fell to their knees in front of him. Demires also bit his lip and lowered his head.Rudger nodded his head contentedly at their reaction.Demires raised his head slowly and managed to move his lips.\u201cJohn Doe, what\u2019s going on here\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cSecond Order Demires.\u201d\u201cFirst order sir!\u201d\u201cWhy do you think I am here now?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dAt his question Demires stayed silent.\u2018Does he know everything?\u2019There is only one reason why the First Order, who hid in the teacher\u2019s seat, came to this place in person. He wanted to hold them accountable for causing the incident on their own.Demires head was spinning quickly. The opponent is an executive of the organization that there are only seven like him in the Black Dawn.There was no way that he could have won that position simply by networking or luck. Codename \u2018John Doe\u2019 was famous for his personality, a man who even kills members of the Black Dawn if they misbehave.\u2018Even after doing that, there wasn\u2019t any criticism from Zero Order.\u2019The First Order is now holding him accountable. If so, what should he do here? Should he bow his head right away and apologize?\u2018Can I live like that? No, there were a lot of followers out there in the first place, but how the hell did John Doe get here?\u2019\u201cGive me the stone.\u201d\u201cThat\u2026\u2026!\u201dDemires raised his trembling hand and offered the stone politely to Rudger but at the same time he recited the most optimal words in his position, chosen by his own instinct.\u201cThis is the relic called the Almighty Stone.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cI dedicate this to the First Order.\u201dHe didn\u2019t make excuses but simply offered the item he desperately obtained as a tribute to his superior, Rudger. It\u2019s definitely something that hurt his self-esteem but he didn\u2019t have the courage to go against Rudger.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dRudger did not answer for a while.The rest of the subordinates\u2019 lips burned at the silence and 10 seconds felt like 10 years but instead of opening his mouth, Rudger took action.He grabbed the Almighty Stone that Demires had given him.\u201cI know.\u201dThe subordinates, who were very nervous, were relieved at that one word. As a result, I couldn\u2019t respond properly to Rudger\u2019s next words.\u201cAnd good-bye.\u201d\u201cYeah? What do you mean\u2026\u2026.?\u201dThe darkness on the ground shook, and then a thorn came out and pierced everyone.Demires looked at Rudger with wide eyes in disbelief, his mouth was about to say, \u2018What the hell?\u2019 but Rudger looked down at him with cold, expressionless eyes, and didn\u2019t answer.The dead bodies pierced through the vital points were scattered on the ground. Rudger had no intention of keeping them alive. If he leaves them alive and his tail is caught on, his place will be in jeopardy.\u2018Is this the Almighty Stone?\u2019Rudger unwrapped the cloth over the stone and his eyes turned sharp when he saw the dark green emerald stone. His expressionless face frowned slightly.\u2018This\u2026\u2026It\u2019s not a Relic.\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 65": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Academy\u2019s Undercover ProfessorCH 65Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayC65: The Witch\u2019s Trap (1)Chapter 2/3 for the week.I have a piece of a Relic, still, I can\u2019t say that all Relics are the same, but I do know why they are called \u2018Relics\u2019 so I\u2019m sure that this <Almighty Stone> is definitely not a Relic.\u2018The president told me that the Almighty Stone was stolen.\u2019And she said that the stone was a relic. However, this almighty stone that I actually saw is not a Relic. This is just a stone that holds inexorable magical power.At that moment, I had no choice but to assume the worst case scenario and at the same time an eerie sensation ran down my spine. The Silent Forest does live up to its name, and countless spirits and thoughts wander around and cry.Occasionally, mutated beasts, a.k.a magical beasts, also wander around but now all sounds were cut off.\u2018The surroundings have become quiet.\u2019I looked up at the sky which was obscured by the clouds and something was floating up there. It was far away, but I saw it clearly as it slowly absorbed power.\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dI hurriedly generated magic. At the same time, I summoned the magical beast \u201cAter Nocturnus\u201d and quickly wrapped it around my body.A shadow like a black cloth wrapped around me like a mummy. My body, covered in shadows, dug into the ground and at the same time a star fell from the sky.* * *\u201cQaaaang\u2014!!!\u201dA white, dazzling explosion occurred in the center of the Silent Forest. The pure white light that burned the darkness spread in the form of a huge dome and engulfed a corner of the forest. A huge storm raged, and shards of branches and stones splattered in all directions.The white dome, which spread as if to swallow up the entire silent forest, eventually stopped its explosive expansion and gradually disappeared.Where the light disappeared, nothing remained. The trees that made up the Silent Forest, the spirits that floated in the air and the demonic spirits that were eroded by the energy of the forest withdrew in fear and awe of a being.\u201cEnd this.\u201dThe clouds lifted and the moonlight fell from the sky, her white hair shone softly in the moonlight, it was President Elisa Willow.She descended from the sky and landed at the center of the ruins she had created. In the place where everything disappeared, only one thing remained.\u201cI recovered the fake Almighty Stone.\u201dThe president mumbled and looked around her. At the same time, she lightly sprinkled her magic power, but nothing was discovered.The cockroaches that hid in Theon were all finished with a single blow and that was all thanks to the \u2018bait\u2019 called the Almighty Stone.\u2018I wanted something bigger, but I can only settle with this.\u2019The president lightly shook her head from side to side. She didn\u2019t want to stay here long because of the high-level magic she used a while ago. The surroundings are quiet for now, but the Silent Forest will again fill the space.\u2018I wanted to completely erase this forest.\u2019No matter how high-level magic she uses, she won\u2019t be able to wipe out the forest alone. However, if someone with poor skills enters the Silent Forest they will go crazy thanks to the forest\u2019s magic.It\u2019s annoying, but she had no choice but to leave it alone.\u2018I\u2019ll just tell the others that I\u2019ve handled it properly.\u2019Elisa deliberately asked Rudger Chelici for help in handling this matter in secret because he seemed capable, but her doubts of him had not yet been cleared. She thought that maybe Rudger might have been here.\u2018Indeed, what would have happened?\u2019The magic she used was not something that even a wizard of the same rank could easily stop. Moreover, since it was an attack that was close to a surprise, it was even more difficult to avoid it. If Rudger had been here, he would have died too.\u2018I hope he didn\u2019t.\u2019She hoped that a man of that caliber was not a traitor. Elisa thought so, grabbed the bait and flew back into the sky.* * *\u2018Honestly, I\u2019m surprised.\u2019Seeing the president leaving Rudger wiped the cold sweat running down his forehead.\u2018The president must have stepped in. If I had been a little late to react, it would have been a disaster.\u2019The magic the president used was an explosion of light as if a meteorite had been dropped.\u2018Is that the magic possessed by a 6th rank wizard?\u2019Rudger couldn\u2019t believe he had been there just a moment before. It was thanks to the \u201cAter Nocturnus\u201d that he managed to escape.\u2018It\u2019s good that I set the coordinates in advance.\u2019Space movement magic does not exist in this world. No, it would be correct to say that magic does exist, but is not known \u201cexternally\u201d. That is why the students were surprised by the coordinate designation method that Rudger showed in the middle of his lecture.Often in fantasy novels that existed in his previous life, magic such as \u2018blink\u2019 and \u2018teleport\u2019 exists. There is no such magic in this world but Rudger used it thanks to \u201cAter Nocturnus\u201d.Unlike most of the summoned beasts that take the form of a pet, \u201cAter Nocturnus\u201d is Rudger\u2019s clothing and it stays around his body. If he moves \u201cAter Nocturnus\u201d using the coordinate designation technique, Rudger himself will also move with it.\u2018I\u2019m dizzy.\u2019With trembling hands, Rudger took a pill from his inner pocket and poured it into his mouth. The tremors in his body subsided as the pure magical power was supplied to his brain.The downside of this magic is that the number of times it can be used is extremely limited. In addition to the extreme consumption of magical power, the body, attracted by magic, jumps over space, and suffers from extreme motion sickness and pain.Even a knight who has trained his body will be stunned but thanks to the medium of shadows, the after-effects are minimal, and if it had been other attribute magic, he would have been in a way worse condition.\u2018Besides that, the president stepped in. I didn\u2019t know things would go this far.\u2019Rudger suddenly remembered that the President had asked him for help.\u2018Is she testing me?\u2019He thought about it, and then shook his head. If so, there is no need to use such a cumbersome method. On the surface, she said that she would leave it to other teachers, and that he himself was meant to handle this matter in secret.The only thing Rudger overlooked was that he made contact with his enemies too quickly, way more quickly than the President had thought.President Elisa was supposed to let the Rudger and others know after she took action. She must not have thought that Rudger would find the enemies before her, even in the Silent Forest.\u2018Besides, even that Almighty Stone was nothing more than a fake. After all, it\u2019s because she\u2019s the leader of Theon. I have to be vigilant.\u2019Rudger shuddered. The President once again imprinted in his mind that she was an extraordinary human being.\u2018I must be more careful not to get caught.\u2019Either the president finds out that he\u2019s a fake, or the Black Dawn finds out but it didn\u2019t seem like a good result would ever come out if either one of them caught him.In particular, when I saw the magic that the president used a little while ago, I realized clearly that I must be very careful.\u2018The only benefit I could get was the Almighty Stone, but even that was a fake.\u2019In a way, it was just a small loss but Rudger did not regret it.\u2018Traces have been left behind.\u2019The Almighty Stone that Demires stole is not a real Relic, but a fake made by the president carefully. However, that alone could not assert that the Almighty Stone did not exist. When the President summoned him about the stone Rudger didn\u2019t find it strange at all.\u2018There is no way Demires and the other members of the Black Dawn could have played with fakes like that. There must be something that genuinely attracted them.\u2019That means that the real thing is still there.\u2018Since I left my mark on the fake, the president will most likely go to check the real thing. I just need to remember the traces that were engraved on the fake.\u2019Right before the President attacked Rudger left his mark on the false stone and because the fake emitted so much magical power she didn\u2019t even notice it.\u2018I\u2019ll act at the right time.\u2019The moment I was thinking about getting out of the Silent Forest the sound of stepping on branches echoed from behind me.\u201cTeacher?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dRudger looked back slowly and Flora Lumos stood there, staring at him with trembling eyes.\u2018Have you seen it?\u2019Rudger never questioned why Flora was here. For now, only the fact that she met him in the Silent Forest is important.Rudger clenched his fists out of her sight. He thought about destroying the evidence right away, but thinking that he would be going too far, Rudger opened his mouth.\u201cFlora Lumos, why are you here now?\u201d\u201cYes Yes? Oh no. That\u2019s\u2026\u2026.\u201dFlora Lumos could not be quick to answer why she had come to the Silent Forest.\u2018How can I tell you that I just followed the nice smell that I smelled for the first time?\u2019And Rudger Chelici was at the end of that smell. If she said that wouldn\u2019t she look like a pervert?\u201cYou won\u2019t answer?\u201d\u201cThat, that\u2026\u2026Why is the teacher here?\u201dIn the end, all Flora could say was this.Rudger let out a small sigh at her bewildered reaction. She didn\u2019t take it seriously, so that meant she hadn\u2019t seen the scene in which he wore \u201cAter Nocturnus\u201d. Even so, the entrance must have been guarded by people outside, so she must\u2019ve come in by accident.\u201cFlora Lumos, this forest is dangerous for a student like you. Go back.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026I\u2019m not that weak, am I?\u201dThe Silent Forest is a dangerous place, especially for students. However, a student like Flora was strong enough to survive the Silent Forest.She has a peculiar constitution called \u2018Magic Synesthesia\u2019, so if she felt the magic of the forest was dangerous, she could avoid it and escape.Since she came all the way here Flora wanted to ask about the mysterious magic but as she was about to speak she saw Rudger holding a pillbox in one hand.\u201cTeacher, what is that?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026It is nothing.\u201dRudger said so and put the pillbox in his hand into his pocket.Flora stared at Rudger with a suspicious look. She came into the forest chasing the smell, and out of nowhere a great light flashed in the distance and then at the end of the smell was Rudger.\u201cI\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cFlora, where the hell are you? Whoa!\u201dAt that moment, a young voice resounded, it was the cry of Cheryl Wagner, who had followed her from afar.Flora and Rudger both shut their mouths at the same time.\u201cFlora! I\u2019m scared! Where the hell did you go?!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Haaa.\u201dRudger sighed and moved on.\u201cFollow me. I will help you get out of this forest safely with your lost friend.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dFlora also gave up on asking questions in this disturbing situation, so she quietly followed Rudger\u2019s.Rudger, who lightly rescued Cheryl, came out of the forest with the two of them. At the same time, the guards who were exploring the outside of the forest found the three people and approached them and asked what they were doing.\u201cThe students went into the forest and got lost so I went to get them.\u201dRudger replied that it was no big deal.The pursuit corps that had been stationed near the forest were disbanded at the command of the president.Cheryl cried, \u2018I\u2019m sorry~\u2019 one after another, but Flora didn\u2019t listen.\u2018Why was Mr. Rudger in the woods?\u2019And what kind of magic was he using?Flora looked at Rudger\u2019s back and couldn\u2019t shake her skeptical thoughts.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The most notable person among them was the president. Her characteristic two-tone hair was noticeable even in the middle of the night.\u201cPresident.\u201d\u201cMr. Rudger.\u201dThe President greeted Rudger with a gentle smile, then she rolled her eyes when she saw the two schoolgirls standing fidgety behind Rudger\u2019s back.\u201cWhat are the two students doing?\u201d\u201cI went to the Silent Forest to take the lost students out.\u201d\u201cIn the Silent Forest?\u201dThe President narrowed her eyes for a moment. The shivering Cheryl Wagner trembled even more as she couldn\u2019t bear it, and Flora Lumos bit her lip.\u201cHmm\u2026To go to a dangerous place like the Silent Forest in the middle of the night. What is the reason?\u201d\u201cI, I mean\u2026\u2026!\u201dCheryl choked and her words were not coming out. At that moment, Flora interfered.\u201cIt\u2019s because of me.\u201d\u201cF, Flora.\u201d\u201cI went into the Silent Forest at will, Cheryl was just chasing after me.\u201d\u201cStudent Flora Lumos?\u201d\u201dFlora Lumos, the second-year senior of Theon, was a student the president was watching with interest. Family, looks, and even magical talents, she had them all and yet she entered the Silent Forest willingly?She used to make small troubles, but she never came to such a dangerous place on her own accord.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u201cIt just happened because I was walking while thinking to change my mood, then Mr. Rudger saved me and Cheryl.\u201d\u201cHmm. That\u2019s right.\u201dThe president did not ask Flora other questions because she knew Flora was innocent. It is not unreasonable to say that she entered by mistake.Since the Forest of Silence is so wide, it is virtually impossible to manage all areas even in Theon. Especially on dark nights like now, students are sometimes drawn to the magic of the forest without realizing it, so this is probably the reason.The Chancellor stared at Rudger, who had brought out the two students.\u201cThank you for taking care of them Mr. Rudger.\u201d\u201cOf course it had to be done.\u201d\u201cBut I\u2019m sorry, the situation is already over.\u201d\u201cPresident finished everything?\u201d\u201cYeah, because it was urgent.\u201dThe President was apologetic and looked closely at Rudger\u2019s reaction but Rudger\u2019s expression did not change. He was neither surprised, nor relieved, nor annoyed at the fact, he just accepted the current situation.\u201cAll right.\u201d\u201cAre you not offended? I asked for your help and took care of the situation on my own.\u201d\u201cThe president, who is more capable than me, came forward, so I think you handled the situation properly. It was a more efficient and faster way to get things done.\u201dAt Rudger\u2019s words, the president nodded with a bewildered face.\u201cThat\u2026\u2026yes. Well, that\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cI have no complaints about that. There is no disappointment over such trivial things.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe president was at a loss for words at the answer that was so honest and even informative. From the first time she saw him until now, Rudger was very consistent, thanks to his military background.\u201cMore than that, in the hands of the president\u2026\u2026.\u201dRudger opened his mouth as he saw the item wrapped in a rag in the president\u2019s hand.\u201cAh, this? It doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201dWhen the president said that, Rudger decided to turn his attention away.Rudger nodded his head and glanced at the two students he had brought with him.\u201cSo what can we do?\u201d\u201cHow can students make such a mistake? I think you should send them back to the dormitory.\u201d\u201cDoesn\u2019t a penalty point need to be added?\u201d\u201cOh my. Even Mr. Rudger says things that he doesn\u2019t even care about. I will look at it, so just send it to me.\u201d\u201cThis is the president!\u201dCheryl looked up at the president in awe with her impressed face while Flora just stood there as if she had no interest in such things.\u201cThen I will take responsibility and send them back.\u201d\u201cMr. Rudger, it\u2019s late and you should go back.\u201d\u201cAll right.\u201dRudger thus ended his meeting with the president and left.* * *\u201cSo how was it?\u201dAfter Rudger had left with the two students, Wilford, who had been watching the situation from afar, approached and asked the president.\u201cIt can be said that the suspicion has been completely erased by this incident.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cYeah. He looked at me and didn\u2019t react at all. If there was any connection with them, he should have shown a flaw, but there was no such thing.\u201dMoreover, Rudger even took two lost students out of the forest.\u201cThe work was done quickly, and I like his attitude. Above all else, he even has strong mental power and wasn\u2019t bewitched by the Silent Forest.\u201d\u201cYou seem to like him.\u201d\u201cMaybe I do, but I think Wilford is the same.\u201d\u201cHa-ha. Well, I\u2019m not going to deny it.\u201dWilford was a former knight, so he particularly liked Rudger who was restrained and sharp compared to other corrupt wizards. In particular, his trained body, which stood out subtly under his clothes, showed that he was different from a normal wizard. That part made a pretty good impression on Wilford.\u201cAnyway, it seems that this incident has raised awareness among them.\u201d\u201cI do not know, I wish I did.\u201d\u201cShould you have captured and interrogated them?\u201dAt that, the president shook her head violently.\u201cMr. Wilford knows very well that those tactics won\u2019t work on them.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dNo matter how many members of the secret society were caught and interrogated no information about their own organization was leaked. Besides, some measures may have been taken to prevent them from leaking information.Capturing and interrogating such extreme bastards consumes considerable time and mental energy so it would be better to eliminate the ones that were discovered.\u201cI hope this will calm them down for a while.\u201d* * *\u201cJust go back.\u201dRudger, who had escorted Flora all the way to the dormitory, turned his back on her without hesitation as the job was over.\u201cI\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dFlora called Rudger and tried to tell him something. However, no matter how many times she bit her lips, her voice did not come out.\u201cIt is late at night, if you have nothing else to say, I will go.\u201dHe disappeared like the wind as if he was busy. He was so fast that even Cheryl, who was beside Flora, stuck out her tongue.\u201cWow. Flora, are you okay?\u201d\u201cYes. I don\u2019t mind.\u201d\u201cI was worried. Why the hell did you suddenly go into that forest?\u201d\u201cJust\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cJust?\u201d\u201cThere were times when I just wanted to wander around without realizing it. Then, after that, I somehow ended up in that forest.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026uh ok. But should I be careful next time, I was very scared too!\u201d\u201cYes. Thanks for your concern, Cheryl.\u201dFlora smiled weakly and returned to her dorm.After washing and changing into her pajamas, she flopped on the bed. She was reminded of the figure of Rudger she had seen in the Silent Forest a while ago.\u2018What teacher was holding in his hand was obviously some sort of medicine box.\u2019She was a little startled by Rudger when she asked about it. Even though she could only see his back when she first spotted him from afar, he was clearly trembling. What was he doing in a place where there were no people?\u2018Are you sick?\u2019One hypothesis suddenly comes to mind and Flora unwittingly raises her upper body.\u2018Is it true?\u2019It certainly looked like that. His body trembling in pain and the act of secretly taking medicine by hiding in a remote place where other people\u2019s eyes do not reach convinced her even more.\u2018There is no way Mr. Rudger is on bad drugs. Maybe he was trying hard to pretend to be strong, but he wasn\u2019t feeling well, was he?\u2019Flora shook her head.\u2018No. Nothing is certain yet. So let\u2019s not think too deeply about it.\u2019However, no matter how much she denied it, she couldn\u2019t help but keep thinking similar thoughts.\u2018If I get a chance, I can check it out next time.\u2019Flora thought so and closed her eyes. It seemed that today, unlike usual, she would not have nightmares.* * *When everyone fell into a deep sleep after midnight the president confirmed with her own eyes the place where the real <Almighty Stone> was located.\u201cIt\u2019s all right.\u201dThanks to the bait, I was able to clear some of the enemies, and the real thing was kept safe. Seeing the <Almighty Stone> in the center of the altar, the president sighed in relief.It looked the same as the replica she made, but that Relic is so dangerous that she couldn\u2019t approach it carelessly. The Almighty Stone responds to the owner\u2019s desire and grants that wish.\u2018The problem is that there is no limit.\u2019That stone responds to the darkest and most powerful desires hidden deep within the user. Even if someone asks to make a lot of money, it will not come true unless it is a real desire. Rather, they often force themselves to do what they do not want.Most of the intense desires of humans are based on \u2018maliciousness\u2019. Rather than earning money and being happy, they implicitly want the person they hate to be ruined and suffer and the stone grants that wish.\u2018However, if there is no user, the Relic will scatter waves of magic on its own and lead those who are sensitive to it.\u2019Therefore, the Almighty Stone had to be stored in an enclosed space covered with countless bulkheads so that its power does not flow outside and the people guarding the area must not be easily deceived by its magical powers.\u2018It\u2019s something to be careful about.\u2019Now, in the few remaining documents, there is a record that a kingdom disappeared in the past because of the stone.People might be wondering why such a dangerous thing should be stored in Theon, but in other words, it is something that can be safely stored because it is in Theon. If it had passed over to the Tower or other kingdoms, war would have already begun.\u2018I\u2019m so glad I made it through without any problems.\u2019After the last check of the Almighty Stone, the president completely closed the entrance to the bulkhead. The 3m-thick metal outer wall that blocks the magic wave closed with a thud, and darkness descended inside, only the green light that gently emanated from the Almighty Stone dimly lit the surroundings.The Almighty Stone was to be placed here without being touched by anyone for a long time again if only the shadows hadn\u2019t wriggled in the dark.A person rose from the shadows.\u201cWhoa.\u201dThe man shook his dizzy head and sighed once then lifted his head and stared at the Almighty Stone at the center of the enclosed space.\u2018It\u2019s real.\u2019It looked similar to the fake, but the atmosphere it gave off was qualitatively different. Rudger\u2019s stellar eye was able to discern the real thing right away.Even the Almighty Stone, realizing that a human was around it, scattered more intense waves of magic power. Rudger felt it on his skin and frowned.\u201cAre you seducing me?\u201dIf there is a being that can respond mentally within a certain range, it emits a wave of magic to make a wish on itself. It doesn\u2019t just affect the body, it also penetrates deep into the mind and touches the desires hidden deep within.\u201cYou\u2019re doing something funny.\u201dBut that only works on mediocre people.Rudger approached the Almighty Stone, then reached out his hand and grabbed it.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I have no intention of letting you realize my desires at will.\u201d\u201cWoo woo!\u201dThe almighty stone vibrated as if rebelling against Rudger.\u201cHow many relics do you think I\u2019ve seen so far?\u201dHe was an expert in this area.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 67": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Academy\u2019s Undercover ProfessorCH 67Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayC67: RelicChapter 3/3 for the week.Rudger traveled the continent in search of relics, to be precise he was looking for the fragments of the \u2018sculpture\u2019 he was possessing.He faced many cities, many countries, and many peoples. As a result, he unintentionally ran into relics that had nothing to do with the \u2018sculpture\u2019.A normal magician would not see one relic in his life but Rudger has seen several so far. When it came to relics Rudger was more experienced than anyone else.\u201cStay still.\u201dHe recites like a command and generates magical power. The Almighty Stone violently generated magic to resist Rudger, but Rudger was not surprised. Sometimes, unusual relics have this kind of \u2018will\u2019.The Almighty Stone exists to satisfy the needs of others. The fact that the Relic scatters waves of desire around it is also because the blind purpose of \u2018granting desire\u2019 has sublimated into its will and has an effect on the surroundings. Relics were also cursed objects in a way.So it resisted Rudger, but Rudger laughed at the Relic\u2019s will.\u201cAnyway, you can\u2019t make my \u2018real\u2019 wish come true.\u201dEven before seeing the Almighty Stone, Rudger did not believe in its power. It could grant wishes but only in the limits of its power. A wish with limits is not a wish after all, it\u2019s just a fake.\u201cIf you\u2019re a fake then act like a fake, do as I tell you.\u201dThe Almighty Stone did not give up. Instead of scattering waves of powerful magic around it, it focused them on Rudger. Green energy wrapped around Rudger\u2019s body.Rudger frowned at the magic that permeated his mind.\u201cUseless struggle.\u201dBut he didn\u2019t push or block the stone\u2019s magic. Rather, he did a daring thing by increasing his magical power even more in his hand holding the stone.\u201cWoo woo woo!\u201dThe Almighty Stone that was bewildered. What the hell was this man doing? Instead of defending, he would rather accept its magic power?The Almighty Stone did not stop invading Rudger\u2019s mind while questioning Rudger\u2019s actions. It went inside Rudger thinking that it was a good thing.The magical power that the Almighty Stone had spread out was blocked at some point as if it had hit a wall.The Almighty Stone, whose purpose is to respond to the inner desires of humans, questioned the situation in which it could no longer enter the interior of Rudger.It was not Rudger\u2019s magic that blocked the Almighty Stone but a power completely different from Rudger\u2019s magic. What stopped the Almighty Stone was a strange power that was impossible to even classify.It is an incomprehensible force that could not even be analyzed.\u201cIt would be better to stop there.\u201dRudger warned of the \u2018will\u2019 of the Almighty Stone.\u201cIf you go beyond that, it won\u2019t be good for you or me.\u201dRudger\u2019s warnings were sincere, however the will of the Almighty Stone has to fulfill its role to the best of its ability. There is no emotional element in it.The Almighty Stone accepted Rudger\u2019s proposal. If it goes any further, it will be ruined and will not be able to fulfill its role in the future.\u201cYou did well.\u201dRudger put his powers on the Almighty Stone and forcibly entered one \u2018wish\u2019.\u201cI have a fragment of this relic.\u201dHe did not hold the stone, so he took a piece from his inner pocket with his hand.\u201cTell me where the four remaining fragments are.\u201dAt that moment, a dazzling green light burst from the Almighty Stone. If it was an open field, the light was so bright and strong that it could be clearly seen even if one was far away. However, in the closed space that blocked the source of the magic wave, the light eventually only illuminated the inside.When the light completely went out Rudger lifted his hand from the Almighty Stone.\u201cTwo, yes.\u201dRudger wanted all four locations but the Almighty Stone could only show two locations and he roughly knew where one was.\u2018The income this time is the position of one piece, not bad.\u2019Just by finding one more fragment whose whereabouts are unknown, he saved years that might have been wasted.\u2018Even so, I didn\u2019t know it would be so close.\u2019The location of the piece he unintentionally learned of was in Leathervelk.\u201cI\u2019m glad I got to find one.\u201d\u201cWoo woo.\u201dThe almighty stone vibrated as if protesting against Rudger. Since it helped, it wanted him to take it outside but Rudger ignored that will.\u201cYou are a dangerous thing that will destroy the humans you touch so you will continue to stay here.\u201d\u201cWoooo.\u201dThe Almighty Stone tried to protest violently, but Rudger had already cast a shadow over his body and had disappeared into the darkness. The Almighty Stone, left alone, flickered in green light as if protesting, but soon became quiet because there was no one to listen to it.* * *Returning to my room, I sat on the sofa for a while to rest because of the magical power I had consumed. Jumping over space is not something you do multiple times, as a result I feel dizzy and numb now.In addition I consumed a lot of magic power using the spell and dealing with the Almighty Stone.[\u2500\u2500\u2500]A noise creeping through my brain, I frowned at it and shoved a pill into my mouth. The magical energy contained in the drug spreads through my body and replenishes the consumed energy, but it is not enough.This time, it took more time, especially since I consumed a lot of mana.In order not to hear this noise, I always had medicine in my mouth. This time, of course, I did benefit from this annoying noise.The Almighty Stone penetrated my mind, but thanks to that, I was able to get over it without being seriously injured. Still, I can\u2019t help but be annoyed. It\u2019s fortunate that this is \u2018stage 1\u2019, but if it gets worse than this, it will be hard to recover.I lightly pressed my finger on my flaky forehead as if it were acupressure. Perhaps thanks to being still for about 30 minutes, the noise from my head disappeared at some point.I sighed in relief and stood up. Now that I know the whereabouts of the fragments, I held the contact crystal ball, sent magical energy, and a response came immediately.[Brother, did you call?]\u201cYes.\u201dHans responded immediately even though it was already past midnight. He must have been waiting for me to contact him.[The fact that you contacted me now means that the work you were trying to solve is over?]\u201cIt ended sooner than I expected.\u201d[I hope that\u2019s good.]\u201cYou can advance the appointment. The weekend would be better.\u201d[I thought it was just the right time. I don\u2019t think you contacted me to say this, what else do you need?]He\u2019s been working with me for quite some time, so he\u2019s quick to see things like this.\u201cI found the whereabouts of another fragment.\u201d[\u2026Where?]\u201cIn Leathervelk. Look for it in the auction house.\u201d[There would be only one auction house in Leathervelk.]\u201cYes.\u201dLeathervelk\u2019s unique auction house <Kunst>. It is one of the auction houses operated by \u2018Luke\u2019, the largest auction company in the Exilion Empire, and the branch in Leathervelk is one of the largest in the continent.The influence of the Kunst auction house was not limited to just Leathervelk or the Exilion Empire. The Kunst auction house has a very high participation rate because rich people from all over the continent can gather to purchase goods.High-quality antiques, historical items, and even outstanding artifacts are good things that attract rich people and those people invest huge amounts of money to show off their wealth.That\u2019s what made the Kunst auction house that it is today and if my prediction is correct, the \u2018fragment\u2019 I\u2019m looking for will be in the Kunst auction house.\u2018The timing isn\u2019t bad because a big event will be held at the Kunst auction house soon.\u2019If it was Hans, he would be able to easily check the list of items that would soon appear in the Kunst auction house.\u201cCheck the list and find out when it\u2019s going up for auction.\u201d[You don\u2019t have to tell me that brother. Anyway, isn\u2019t the Kunst auction house a bit big?]\u201cYes.\u201d[Then I think the \u2018usual\u2019 method would be a little difficult.]At Hans\u2019s slightly worried voice, I realized what he was worried about.\u201cI know. For now, I plan to act as a guest properly.\u201dThe Kunst auction house maintained a terrifying security as it was a place where all the wealthy people gathered. When an auction is held, they hire knights to assure security. This means that the scale of the auction is huge, and the reputation of Luke, who conducts it, is great.Even wizards participated and the valuable items were enchanted with security magic. It was difficult to stick to the old way in such a place.\u201cDon\u2019t worry too much. There is still plenty of time left anyway.\u201d[I see. Let\u2019s check the list of items first. Huh?!]\u201cWhat?\u201dSuddenly Hans screamed, and I wondered if something had happened.[It\u2019s not really a big deal. It\u2019s because one annoying carnivore is smoking.]\u201cAnnoying carnivores?\u201d[Brother called them. One is already here.]\u201cI see.\u201dThey arrived earlier than expected.At that moment, a voice shouted from beyond the crystal ball.[Madam! Wait! I\u2019m going!]Seeing Hans shouting like that, she must have come first.[Anyway, brother. See you again in the near future.]\u201cYes. Suffer.\u201dI ended the call with Hans.I obtained something by using the Almighty Stone, and all those who tried to steal it died. With this, the case related to the wish-granting stone has come to an end.\u2018With this incident, almost all doubts the president had have been removed, so that\u2019s enough.\u2019It was now time to return to the daily life of the teacher, Rudger Chelici. The only thing that bothered me was Flora Lumos.\u2018I don\u2019t think we met by chance in the forest.\u2019She came to exactly where I was even in the Silent Forest? But if it wasn\u2019t just a coincidence and she came after me on purpose that\u2019s even more absurd.The \u201cAter Nocturnus\u201d I used erased my own existence, so it is not something that students could perceive.\u2018The good news is that, based on her reaction, she didn\u2019t see me using magic.\u2019Perhaps it was because the high-ranking destruction magic used by the president drew her attention instead but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that it makes me wonder why she was there.\u2018I have to be careful.\u2019 Flora Lumos\u2019 behavior was also worth paying close attention to. However, since I made a big point this time, I will be quiet for a while. With that in mind, I fell asleep since I have to get up early again tomorrow.* * *Early morning in front of my office I found a girl walking around.\u201cFlora Lumos.\u201d\u201cHuh? Ah, ah! Mr. Rudger?\u201dShe must\u2019ve been worried about me because of what happened yesterday and she was waiting for me in front of my office.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 68": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Academy\u2019s Undercover ProfessorCH 68Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayC68: Magical Synesthesia (1)I was sick so I couldn\u2019t post until today.\u201cFlora Lumos, what the hell is going on here?\u201dFlora hesitated to answer Rudger\u2019s question.Actually, she wanted to ask Rudger if he used unusual magic without anyone else\u2019s knowledge.\u2018But, how do you say that?\u2019Smell was the only proof that he had used magic and only someone with a special constitution like Flora could sense that unique fragrance.\u201cAh, that, so\u2026\u2026.\u201dWhy was Rudger there that night in the first place? And what was the medicine box he was carrying? She had several questions she wanted to ask, but at the same time she couldn\u2019t.\u2018Hmmm.\u2019Come to think of it, she wasn\u2019t particularly good with Rudger. Although Rudger himself says he does not understand at all, Flora still has not forgotten the humiliation she suffered on the first day of class.All of them were defeats caused by her shortcomings, and even the battle of insults that followed did not end nicely. To her, Rudger Chelici, was nothing more than a man worthy of her challenge.Flora was fiddling with the hem of her own uniform skirt.\u2018Yeah, that\u2019s right. Calm down Flora Lumos. Even Mr. Rudger is sick, that\u2019s not my business.\u2019Until Flora had put her thoughts together, Rudger just stood still and stared at her.Flora coughed a little, and she looked at Rudger.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dAnd she unwittingly turned her eyes to the side. She felt ashamed when she finally made up her mind and met Rudger\u2019s eyes.\u2018What? Those eyes.\u2019Rudger was just staring normally, but not at all in his predicament. Rudger is a man who turns into a picture just by keeping his mouth shut. His impression is sharp and charisma is felt just by looking at him. Those who receive such a gaze from him will automatically feel embarrassed.That intense, unshakable gaze had something that was difficult to face for more than 3 seconds. It was as if she was dealing with beings higher than the nobility.\u201cIs there nothing to say?\u201dRudger was not at all embarrassed as he was going to work early in the morning and a student was standing in front of the door, especially a student who may have witnessed his secret.\u2018Have you seen it? So you want to threaten me with it?\u2019Flora, unaware of his thoughts, panicked at Rudger\u2019s gaze. In the end, Flora had no choice but to bring out her purpose after hesitating.\u201cI heard that you are hiring assistants.\u201dActually, she didn\u2019t come here for anything related to teaching. She tried to ask what she had seen in the forest, but she dared not speak so she switched the topic.In fact, when Rudger hired an assistant, she was intrigued.\u201cObviously.\u201dRudger nodded her head and agreed with her.Flora clenched her tiny fist tightly and spoke with courage.\u201cI, I\u2026\u2026Can I help you with your work?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dRaise one of his hands and put it on his chest. For a moment, Rudger wondered if he had heard something wrong.\u201c\u2026\u2026What did you just say?\u201d\u201cI said that I could help you with your assistants.\u201d\u201cSo, did you say that you want to be my assistant now?\u201d\u201cNo. Not that!\u201dFlora pursed her lips.Still, she said that he would come and help with the work, as she is a senior in the second year. If it were another teacher, they would thank her immediately and hold her hand but Rudger\u2019s reaction was blunt.\u201cHey, even though I look like this, I\u2019m very talented at magic.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d\u201cIf you know why are you reacting like that?\u201d\u201cBecause I no longer need an assistant right now.\u201d\u201cYeah?\u201dFlora\u2019s eyes widened as if she had heard something wrong. Her long dark blue hair shook due to her emotions.\u201cThat, what now\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s as you say. I\u2019ve already hired one assistant, and I don\u2019t need another assistant right now. Above all else, I look at things other than magical skills when I hire an assistant. I\u2019ve already explained this in class.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u2026.\u201dRudger does not hire assistants simply because of their magical abilities or their background but because of how diligent and faithful they are to their role. That was the condition Rudger put forward.Flora was a little shocked because what she said with courage was so harshly rejected. She slightly bit her lip and lowered her head. At that moment, Rudger\u2019s voice rang in her ear.\u201cBut, I appreciate your kindness.\u201d\u201cYeah?\u201dFlora shook her head.\u201cThat\u2026\u201d\u201cWeren\u2019t you just here to help?\u201d\u201cOh, wasn\u2019t I?! That, didn\u2019t you misunderstand me?!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dRudger couldn\u2019t understand her and decided to act like an adult.\u201cThen do that.\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s not like that.\u201d\u201cIf there is nothing else to do, I will go in first.\u201d\u201cNo! I have one more question!\u201d\u201cOne more?\u201dRudger hoped that the last question would not waste his time or he would be really bitter. As he stared at Flora, she roused her magical powers even though she was pouting.\u201cIsn\u2019t that what Mr. Rudger said back then? If there is anyone who understands my magic, please come and find me.\u201dIn the last class, Rudger showed his students the coordinate designation magic and said that if there is a student who can imitate it he will give them extra points accordingly.\u201cLook at this.\u201dFlora said and created a tiny drop of water in the empty space between her and Rudger. She didn\u2019t stop there as small pieces of ice formed on the ceiling and the wind blew from the other side of the hallway.Rudger\u2019s eyes widened as he watched the scene. That was obviously the <coordinate designation method> he showed in class the other day.It wasn\u2019t as sophisticated and neat as he showed and even the effect is only at a weak level but the basis is definitely the same as what he showed.\u201cYou were successful.\u201d\u201cBecause I am a genius.\u201dAs Rudger graciously admitted, Flora naturally raised her nose.\u201cWhat do you want? Do you want to get the extra points as I said then?\u201d\u201cAt first, I thought I would just get the points.\u201dFlora didn\u2019t think it would be fun then and halfway through, she changed her mind.\u201cI want another reward that is equal to the points.\u201d\u201cAnother reward?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dFlora\u2019s request was bold, but she deserved it. Rudger pondered for a moment and then nodded his head.\u201cGood.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dShe didn\u2019t expect that Rudger would agree to her request. Of course, she also had her own inner intentions.She can\u2019t openly ask him to show her another magic and can\u2019t ask him to tell her a secret either. But what if she left that judgment to Rudger? She was sure that he would give her a suitable reward.\u2018Because Mr. Rudger is surprisingly knowledgeable.\u2019Rudger Chelici is blunt, hard-headed, and sometimes rude, but he is confident in his words.\u201cCome in.\u201dRudger said and opened the door to the office.\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cI told you to come in.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dFlora swallowed her saliva. Is he saying that the two of them are going into the office alone now? Flora had a strange thought without her knowing, but then she shook her head.\u2018Yes. He just told me to come in. Let\u2019s not think strange things!\u2019She said yes and followed Rudger into the office.The office was just like Rudger neat and tidy. It was well-organized and there was a strange sense of stability thanks to the pleasant smell of wood and the scent of ink and paper and even the light that softly illuminates the interior space.\u201cThis is it.\u201dRudger guided Flora through a door on one wall of the office. It was a private laboratory dedicated to teachers, where the assistants stayed and Rudger himself used to do magic experiments and research.Rudger opened the door and went in first, and Flora followed.\u2018Wide.\u2019Flora had such a sentiment as she looked at Rudger\u2019s laboratory. Usually teachers are all supported with similarly sized labs, but Rudger felt particularly large compared to other teachers because there was hardly any clutter that took up space.\u2018Is he really from the military?\u2019He didn\u2019t put anything aside, except for the bare minimum of books, documents, and materials he needed.On a long blackboard on one wall, dense magic circles and theories drawn with magic chalk were visible.\u2018What the hell did you study?\u2019Most of the writings were merely copying passages from papers or books, which Flora also knew. However, seeing a pattern drawn on one end of the magic board, Flora had no choice but to stop without her knowing.\u2018This is\u2026\u2026?\u2019Rudger researched the starting point for various magics. She didn\u2019t feel much inspiration there, but the pattern she\u2019s seeing now is different.\u2018Pattern? No. Is that alcohol?\u2019But for a drink, the shape is a bit strange. Basically, the magic technique takes on a three-dimensional form as if drawing a picture through lines and planes with magic in the air.Its appearance varies greatly depending on the magic, but there are many things that are basically splendid or create elegant beauty. However, that one painted by Rudger was strange, it looked like an ordinary cube.When asked to draw, she could draw even with her eyes closed. However, if there is another small cube inside the cube, and each edge is connected by a line, the story is different.\u2018Did he just draw it? No. It\u2019s not just a drawing.\u2019As she approached and tried to study it, Rudger opened his mouth.\u201cI was thinking about what to give you.\u201dFlora turned to Rudger, who looked like he had already decided.\u201cThe coordinate designation formula I showed. As you feel and use it, it is to set mathematical formulas and coordinates centered on the user, and to manifest magic from distance, controlling the mana used as much as possible, fixing it in the air, and manifesting another technique at the coordinates.\u201dOf course, students who can\u2019t understand even if I say this won\u2019t be able to do it. In fact, Flora Lumos was the same. She could only imitate Rudger thanks to her talent.\u201cIf it\u2019s you, it\u2019s okay if I show you this.\u201dRudger said and began to draw a magic circle in front of him. However, it was very different from the usual magic circle.\u2018What is that?\u2019Flora unknowingly shook her shoulder.The basic technique is to draw a line of magic in the air to create a three-dimensional picture but what Rudger showed her now was entirely different. It was a technique and magic that showed the possibility of another dimension beyond three dimensions.\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dAt the same time, Flora\u2019s \u2018synesthesia\u2019 was activated, a transcendent sense that it\u2019s beyond the limits of the human senses. The moment she felt it with her senses of sight and smell, Flora could not stand the shock and passed out.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Daily chapters until I finish the sponsored chapters(I hope).\u201cUmmm.\u201dFlora rubbed her forehead and slowly opened her eyes.\u2018What?\u2019She fainted when she saw Rudger\u2019s magic and had a dream that made her feel nostalgic and sympathetic. Her body felt warm as if she was in the arms of her mother who is now dead.Belatedly, Flora realized she was lying on the sofa.\u201cAh.\u201dFlora slowly raised her torso, and discovered that the coat covering her body was running down. She recognized the familiar black frock coat with golden thread.\u201cThis\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cAre you awake?\u201dUnknowingly, she turned her head toward the place where the voice came from and saw Rudger Chelici, sitting at his work desk, reading. Instead of the coat he usually wears, he wore a pure white shirt and a black vest.His long bangs were slightly pushed back, revealing his forehead and his usual sharp gaze was diluted thanks to the rimless glasses he wore on his face, further accentuating his intellectual feeling.\u201cYou don\u2019t remember?\u201d\u201cYeah?\u201d\u201cI showed you one magic.\u201dIt was only then that Flora could remember what Rudger was talking about. He showed her a magic and, stunned by the intense sensation, Flora fainted.\u201cNo, that\u2019s! Sir, that\u2019s\u2026\u2026!\u201dFlora got up from the sofa but perhaps because of the shock, her legs lost strength and she fell back on the sofa.\u201cKeep sitting. It seems that you have not yet recovered from the shock of fainting.\u201d\u201cHow long has it been?\u201d\u201cAbout 30 minutes.\u201d\u201cAbout 30 minutes\u2026\u2026.\u201dFlora shook her head and stared at Rudger almost as if she was about to eat him.\u201cWhat the hell was that magic?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cWhat you showed me right before I passed out!\u201d\u201cAh\u2026That.\u201dRudger replied in a muffled voice as if it was nothing.\u201cIt was just something I just came up with. It\u2019s called Klein disease.\u201d\u201cKlein disease? Did such magic exist?\u201d\u201cIt is not practical magic in the first place. It\u2019s more of an experiment.\u201d\u201cIs it an experiment?\u201dFlora wiggled her lips in disbelief. Others would have thought that it was an unusual type of magic but Flora knew that Klein\u2019s disease was different, it was an innovation.The level of magic that\u2019s limited to three dimensions was raised. Even after seeing it Flora could hardly believe that such a magic existed but she accepted it.\u201cYes.\u201dBut to Rudger it seemed as if it wasn\u2019t a big deal.\u201cThis is an experiment to see the extent to which the magic created through mana can reach?\u201d\u201cIs that great thing just an experiment? Teacher is\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u2018What the hell are you trying to do?\u2019Flora couldn\u2019t bear to ask about it because she couldn\u2019t possibly fathom the magic Rudger was trying to create.\u201cHmm.\u201dThe reason he created the Klein disease was because his curiosity for mana was not satiated.\u2018Does mana exist purely materially? If so, does mana receive full physical effects?\u2019Mana manifested in the form of magic, mana was already something beyond the laws of physics. Magic is the embodiment of mystery and mana it\u2019s the base.\u2018The unknown that has not yet been revealed.\u2019With mana one can jump through space and Klein\u2019s disease was created to prove that as it was a magic that can be manifested in 4 dimensions.\u2018Mana goes beyond mere space and can interfere with dimensions beyond that.\u2019However, Klein\u2019s disease only serves to prove the hypothesis because there was still not enough research to apply it to other magic.\u201cAnyway, I\u2019m glad you woke up.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dCome to think of it, Flora fainted in the lab, but when she woke up, she was in Rudger\u2019s office.\u201cDid teacher bring me here?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t leave a fainted student in the lab.\u201dFlora recalled the figure of Rudger who caught her when she fainted and her face turned red in an instant.\u201cThat\u2026!\u201d\u201cFlora Lumos, are your eyes and nose okay?\u201d\u201cYeah?\u201dWhy all of a sudden? Before Flora could question it, Rudger spoke first.\u201cHey, don\u2019t you feel magic in a different way?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dFlora was astonished because Rudger discovered the secret of her peculiar constitution that no one had noticed until now.\u201cDamn, how are you\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cBecause I saw it.\u201d\u201cDid you see it?\u201d\u201cEvery time you look at my magic, your pupils dilate greatly. I found out that you were not looking at the magic spell itself, but the secondary phenomena that resulted from the spell.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dFlora could not believe that Rudger had noticed such a reaction that she was not aware of.\u201cAnd every time you saw a new magic, your fingertips trembled, it\u2019s a reflex behavior that occurs when you feel momentary pleasure.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201d\u201cIn particular, it is good to change the habit of twitching the bridge of the nose. From the looks of it, it seems that you can accept magic with your sense of smell, but it wouldn\u2019t be good if you open your nostrils like that\u2026\u201d\u201cAhhhhh!\u201dFlora couldn\u2019t stand it and screamed.\u201cWhy are you screaming?\u201d\u201cWhat disrespectful words are you talking about a lady nose?\u201d\u201cI was talking about your habit. Be careful not to get caught by others.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026.\u201dFlora muttered as if fed up with Rudger.Rudger sighed, stood up from his seat, and walked slowly towards Flora.\u201cDon\u2019t come near me!\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what the misunderstanding was.\u201dRudger took his coat from Flora and after waving it in the air a few times, Rudger hung it neatly on the hanger.\u201cSeeing you screaming so loudly, it seems that your body has recovered properly. You should leave.\u201d\u201cYeah?\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t you hear me telling you to leave?\u201dFlora asked Rudger, still having not cleared her suspicions.\u201cAre you not curious?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cAbout my unique body.\u201d\u201cYou mean the fact you feel magic in a different way?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Right.\u201dFlora nodded her head frankly.Her Magical synesthesia body had two of the five senses. If he had been any other wizard, he would not have been able to turn his eyes away from this unbelievable constitution. That\u2019s why Flora asked in a worried voice.\u201cNot at all.\u201dBut Rudger was different and answered in a firm voice.\u201cYeah?\u201d\u201cI am not interested in what you are like.\u201d\u201cThat, what\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cHowever, it would be better not to tell other people about that constitution. Magicians are very dangerous when they discover something they don\u2019t know.\u201dFlora read something in Rudger\u2019s attitude because he seemed to be aware of the magical synesthesia she possessed.\u201cIn extreme cases, someone might abduct you and use you as a test subject.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dGulp.Flora swallowed at Rudger\u2019s heartfelt warning. At the same time, she couldn\u2019t help but think,\u2018Why are you so calm? Have you ever met someone with a similar constitution besides me?\u2019\u201cTeacher, do you know anyone other than me with a constitution similar to mine.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dRudger didn\u2019t answer, instead he raised his hand and pointed to the door of the office.Flora wiggled her eyebrows at the action, but did not follow it. It was a moment, but Rudger\u2019s face had a somewhat sad look on his face. So she did not dare to ask and had no choice but to leave the office.\u2018Teacher knew. He must have met someone else besides me.\u2019No rather than that, how did he know that it would be dangerous if her constitution was discovered? And the subtle expression he showed at the end.\u2018Did we know each other?\u2019Then Rudger\u2019s behavior was understandable. He said that he had an acquaintance with a constitution similar to her and that acquaintance suffered harm. If so, who was that person? Man? Woman? If it was a woman, what kind of relationship did the two have?\u2018No!\u2019Flora shook her head and stopped thinking about it.\u2018Yes. Let\u2019s just move on today.\u2019Just as she was thinking about it, Flora suddenly had such a thought.\u2018By the way, I haven\u2019t received another award instead of the extra points.\u2019Rudger showed her Klein\u2019s disease and did nothing else because she fainted. Flora looked back at the office door.\u2018If I go back in now and ask for the prize.\u2019That be a bit.\u2018I\u2019m stupid too. Why did I forget the most important thing because O was so caught up in something else?\u2019Flora wanted to rip her hair out but time that has already passed cannot be turned back. She left her regret behind and had no choice but to back down this time.At that moment, someone from afar approached her with staggering footsteps. No, to be exact, she was approaching Rudger\u2019s office.\u201cYou?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dHolding an old book in her arms and walking with careful steps, it was a girl with a rare gray hair color.\u2018I remember.\u2019Flora is not very interested in other people, but she remembers a few unusual children in her class and Rene was one of them. At the beginning of the semester she had a quarrel with an aristocratic student but the fact that she, a commoner, gets along with the 3rd princess overshadowed that.She is also strikingly beautiful in appearance, so even if people don\u2019t want to know her, they can\u2019t help but remember her.\u201cUh, you\u2026\u2026.\u201dRene also recognized her Flora and stopped her steps. If she were to name the most famous person in Theon sophomore year, it\u2019s her. She is the daughter of the Duke Lumos and has a natural talent for magic in addition to her beautiful appearance.She has no attributes like herself but unlike her non-attribute magic, which is difficult to understand the source of, her senior, has her own firm path. But why is that person in front of Rudger\u2019s office?\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe two looked at each other without a word. They take Rudger\u2019s class together, but other than that, there\u2019s almost no contact. However, Flora could not help but doubt why Rene had come to Rudger\u2019s office, especially when she was holding a book.Rene was also wondering why a senior like Flora was standing in front of Rudger\u2019s office.It was Flora who moved first in that subtle and uncomfortable silence.\u201cHuh.\u201dShe passed Rene as if she wasn\u2019t interested. Rene stared at Flora\u2019s back and remembered why she came to Rudger\u2019s office.\u2018Oh right. Book!\u2019After reading the book on non-attribute magic, she came to return it to the owner, Rudger. With that thought in mind, Rene gulped her saliva in front of the door to his office. It was the moment she was about to take a deep breath and then knock.\u201cCome in. The door is open.\u201dRudger\u2019s voice sounded from inside.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 70": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Academy\u2019s Undercover ProfessorCH 70Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayC70: Magical Synesthesia (3)After Flora left, Rudger recalled the conversation he had just had with her.\u2018I asked how she found me, but it was because of the smell.\u2019Flora Lumos was born with her constitution to feel magic in a different way. When she sees the same magic, she sees different colors and feels different smells.I was skeptical about her at first, but her reaction to Klein\u2019s disease convinced me.\u2018There was a loophole in my \u300cAter Nocturnus\u300d.It was not possible to avoid everyone\u2019s gaze by simply erasing my existence. Flora felt the very subtle magical reverberation that flowed in the magic water and found him.She perceives magic through her senses of smell and sight. Indeed, there must have been a reason for being number 1 in the 2nd year. It\u2019s understandable that she made fun of several teachers so far.\u2019If so, what to do next?From Flora\u2019s reaction, it was as if she had not seen what Rudger had done in the Silent Forest that day. She had a slightly suspicious gaze, but there was no solid evidence.\u2018The opponent is a daughter of the duke family that the Empire is proud of. If I touch her, it will be troublesome.\u2019Still, the academy is buzzing thanks to the recent events, and I can\u2019t do anything over the top. However, it seemed necessary to keep an eye on Flora more closely than usual.\u2018I\u2019ll let Hans do the background check. Even so, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll find someone with that kind of constitution in Theon.\u2019After all, this is the best academy that teaches magic. Both teachers and students are extraordinary people. Even those whom I have seen so far were only a small fraction of this academy.Do I have to live in a place like this for 2 years?\u2018It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve worked here, and two big incidents have already occurred. How many more will it happen?\u2019It was then that I felt a presence in front of the door.\u201cCome in. The door is open.\u201dAs Rudger said that, he felt a shudder through the door, and then the door opened cautiously. A girl with dense facial features, clear blue eyes and gray hair that is hard to find in Theon poked her face through the half-open door.\u201cIs it Rene?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWhat did you come here for?\u201d\u201cThe book\u2026\u2026I finished it.\u201d\u201cBook\u2026\u2026..\u201dRudger recalled that he had handed Rene a book about non-attribute magic. With only her face sticking out, Rene entered the office with her careful steps. She looked as if she couldn\u2019t make the slightest mistake.\u201cI thought I should give it back to teacher.\u201d\u201cYou mean that?\u201d\u201cYes, Mr. Rudger.\u201dRudger shook his head and said.\u201cThe book is not mine. I, too, am only giving further what I have received.\u201d\u201cThen this book\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cKeep that book with you.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cYou may have read it many times, but you will always need it. Sometimes you won\u2019t remember parts of it so it\u2019s better to have it just in case.\u201d\u201cStill\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cSome things show their value only when they have a suitable user. The book about non-attribute magic will shine more when you have it than if it is in my hands.\u201dRudger took a moment to catch his breath and took off the rimless glasses he wore on his face.\u201cI believe that you will take good care of it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dRene couldn\u2019t say anything because Rudger\u2019s words cluttered her head.\u2018Do you believe in me?\u2019Rene was dizzy as Rudger\u2019s words kept echoing in her head.\u2018Why do you believe? Do you have a good reason for that? Or is it simply because I am the owner of non-attribute magic?\u2019She suddenly had a thought.Rudger knew the previous owner of this book. If so, did he hear something from him?\u201cI\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThat, so\u2026\u2026.\u201dRene couldn\u2019t help but ask. Even when she opened her mouth, only unlisted languages come out. It was because of Rudger\u2019s outspoken words that her head was not spinning properly.\u201cIf you have nothing to say, just leave. Classes are starting soon.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Yes.\u201dIn the end, Rene gave up and was forced to leave the office. She walked down the hallway with staggering footsteps as her head was still a mess.* * *\u2018Oh right.\u2019It was only after she wandered aimlessly and reached her sparse garden that Rene finally regained her sanity.\u2018I was going to ask about the assistant position as well.\u2019She was so embarrassed and out of context that she didn\u2019t even think of asking.\u2018By the way, it seems that senior Flora also came to see Mr. Rudger. Did she come here for Mr. Rudger\u2019s assistant position too?\u2019As a senior in the second year who holds the title of genius, which is rare in Theon Flora Lumos was pretty popular even among the freshmen.Although she comes from a great family, she does not belong to a faction unlike other nobles and stays with her childhood friend.\u2018No. Let\u2019s stop paying attention for now. I have to start preparing for the next class at the library during the rest of the time.\u2019Just as I was thinking about it, I heard a conversation coming from over the trees in the garden.\u2018Uh?\u2019Rene had no choice but to stop her steps when she saw the students who had finally appeared. They were students from aristocratic families that stood out even from afar. Also, she doesn\u2019t get along well with them as usual.\u2018Ah\u2026\u2026.\u2019Among them there was a man who left a great impression on Rene when he approached her and wanted to date her as if he was doing her a favor. In the end, Rene relentlessly pushed him away, and naturally he began to harbor a grudge against Rene.\u2018I really hate it.\u2019In addition to that, a group of people who were jealous and secretly quarreled after seeing Rene getting along with the 3rd princess recently joined the situation.\u2018I didn\u2019t know she was going to meet them here.\u2019There was no way they would leave her alone. It was better to avoid any clashes and Rene has realized through her past experiences. She immediately turned her gaze away.\u2018Let\u2019s go inside.\u2019Rene headed deeper into the garden. Since the site of Theon is so wide, even the size of the garden was different. There were marble fountains, colorful flower fields, and a long avenue of trees. Even some artificial forests or small open spaces have been created, and sometimes the students used them to socialize outdoors.Some say that there is a secret place in this large garden that other people don\u2019t see, but she didn\u2019t know that.\u2018Let\u2019s hide for now.\u2019Rene moved immediately and went inside the garden.Vines and beautiful pink flowers grow to block the sunlight, creating a long tunnel of arched pergola.. As she walked through it, it was as if she were passing through a door to another world.As she exited the pergola, she saw the lush greenery.\u2018There was a place like this?\u2019She had just entered this place and was still not familiar with the geography or structure, so whenever she encountered a new place, she was simply amazed.Rene pricked her ears and listened to the situation outside.\u2018Did they go?\u2019She could still hear the soft chatter between them. Are they thinking of staying here?\u2018I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll come this far.\u2019Killing time in this area in moderation, avoiding the noble students, and going back through a detour were Rene thoughts when she leaned her back against a suitable tree and suddenly turned her head in one direction.\u2018Is this a song?\u2019A voice came from inside the forest.\u2018Who is inside?\u2019It was something she could just ignore but Rene was curious. Some of the songs are good to listen to, but it\u2019s because she felt a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu as if she had heard it somewhere.\u2018It feels similar to when I got the book from Mr. Rudger.\u2019Rene was curious and unwittingly moved her steps towards the source of the sound.\u2018Let\u2019s just check.\u2019There\u2019s still time until Rudger\u2019s class anyway. With that in mind a small open space that greeted Rene, who was heading into the forest. It was not a natural place since the vacant lot was very neat as if someone had been managing it before. Besides, there was even a small flower bed nearby.\u2018Who is it? Did the gardener do it?\u2019With that thought in mind, she slowly walked towards the center of the vacant lot. The melody that had been heard a while ago was no longer heard.\u201cWho are you? This is a place no one comes to.\u201dA voice came from behind her back.Rene looked back in surprise and saw someone sitting on a thick branch and looking down at her.\u201cWho are you?\u201d\u201cWell?\u201dThe young man, who seems to be the owner of the flower bed, questioned her reaction and eventually realized that he had just come here by chance.He let out a small laugh, then jumped off the tree and landed lightly in front of Rene.Rene\u2019s eyes widened at the quick movements.\u201cDid you come here by chance?\u201d\u201cOh that\u2026\u2026.\u201dRene was belatedly able to recognize who the other person was. He was a sophomore and above all, the dark blue hair color he had was easy to recognize.\u201cSenior\u2026.. Freuden?\u201dFreuden Ulburg, the eldest son of the Ulburg family, who symbolizes the wolf, one of the three duke families of the Exilion Empire. He is also a student who is regarded as the head of the noble faction in Theon.\u2018Is this the flower bed that senior Freuden was managing?!\u2019Rene realized that she had entered the tiger\u2019s den.The rumors about Freuden had already spread among other students and his notoriety among the commoners grew because he is the leader of a faction made up of noble students who openly despise and harass commoners.He was also the eldest son of the Freudian family, unmatched by anyone except the imperial family, so commoner students were afraid of Freuden. The fact that aristocratic students looked down on and harassed commoners was to the extent that it was even said that this man had given orders from above.For commoner students, Freuden was the final boss to be wary of and fear more than anyone else.To see such Freuden Ulburg alone in a place like this.\u2018No, it\u2019s ruined.\u2019Rene thought about whether she should run away right now.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Did the leader of the noble faction even recognize her? Will he remember the Dunema incident and ask her to take responsibility now?Rene\u2019s head was spinning in a complicated way.According to the rumors she had heard, Freuden was famous as a demon that hated commoners and had no mercy. Meanwhile, Freud did not take his eyes off Rene.When his gaze finally settled on the book about the non-attribute magic that Rene was holding in her arms she hid the book behind her back without realizing it.Freuden narrowed his eyes.\u201cYou\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cYes Yes?!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026No, nothing.\u201dWhen Rene reacted too violently, Freuden shook his head.\u201cHow did you get here? Ordinary students would not come this far.\u201d\u201cWell, that\u2026\u2026.\u201dRene pondered how she was going to answer.Freuden was suspicious of Rene\u2019s attitude and narrowed his eyes even more.Rene choked her chest at the sight.Freuden is a handsome man that stands out, his skin is white and his jawline is thin, so he has a very sharp image, but he has a lot of charisma because of his unique eyes and the parted hairstyle that exposed the forehead raised his mood even higher.Since the rumors were so strong Rene answered frankly to her fear that she might die if she lied.\u201cI heard someone singing.\u201d\u201cSinging?\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026.\u2026I wouldn\u2019t have come if I knew this was senior\u2019s space! Really! Trust me!\u201dFreuden looked at her with slightly widened eyes, then turned his gaze away and murmured.\u201cYou heard a song?\u201d\u201cYeah. Song\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cHow was it?\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure you came here by chance.\u201d\u201cI, really? Thank god.\u201d\u201cInstead, I want you to keep it a secret from other students. This is my personal space and even my bodyguards don\u2019t know about it.\u201d\u201cHuh\u2026\u2026.\u201dAt Freuden\u2019s attitude, which was completely different from what she had heard, Rene lost her voice for a moment.\u201cHey, aren\u2019t you mad?\u201d\u201cAngry? Why?\u201d\u201cOh no, I mean\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u2018I\u2019m a commoner.\u2019She couldn\u2019t even say those words, so she just muttered to herself.\u201cI will not blame you for coming here. All you have to do is keep what you saw in this place a secret.\u201d\u201cOf course! I won\u2019t tell anyone! Really!\u201d\u201cAre you going to promise?\u201d\u201cYeah! I promise!\u201dThe conversation went better than she expected and Rene started doubting the rumors about Freuden.\u2018Maybe you have mistaken me for a nobleman? I don\u2019t think so.\u2019At least according to the rumors she heard, Freuden Ulburg always had a cold attitude that seemed to prey on someone. However, the Freuden she is facing now did not do that at all and the cute flower bed jumped into her eyes.\u2018Did senior raise them all?\u2019Judging by his reaction, this must be Freuden\u2019s personal space.\u2018Senior Freuden made this.\u2019That Freuden? The eldest son of the House of Ulburg, one of the three dukes of the Empire? He is a symbol of fear for commoners and even for aristocrats.At least the aristocrats she knows are extravagant and brag all the time about their hobbies like buying expensive clothes, buying fancy accessories, or having tea parties but Freuden was different.\u2018What a simple noble. Is it possible that senior Freuden sang that song too?\u2019If so, from whom did he learn the song? Rene tried to ask, but she immediately withdrew.\u2018No. It\u2019s much better not to draw attention here.\u2019Freuden\u2019s unexpectedly merciful nature, contrary to what she knew, made it a better choice for her to take advantage of this opportunity to leave.\u201cSorry, I won\u2019t speak about this with anyone. Today I didn\u2019t see anything. Yep. So I\u2019ll just go.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dFreuden didn\u2019t really want to look down on her or make fun of her since she was a commoner.\u201cThen, I\u2019m going.\u201dRene stepped backwards slowly.\u201cRene.\u201d\u201cYeah?!\u201d\u201cIf you want to come, you can come again.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Yeah?\u201d\u201cYou can come. I will give you special permission.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dRene didn\u2019t understand what the hell this meant. She didn\u2019t know if he was serious or was just kidding with her.\u201cAh yes.\u201dAs she moved away from Freuden, she could only think that she was dreaming because today\u2019s been full of incredible things and with quick steps, she escaped from Freuden\u2019s secret garden.* * *Rudger\u2019s class has begun. He came in right on time for lecture and scanned the pulpit where the students were sitting. Before this, they seemed quite bored, but after showing the coordinate designation magic, the students\u2019 concentration had returned.\u2018In this state, a month should be sufficient.\u2019Rudger shook his head with satisfaction and opened his mouth.\u201cThe first test period is coming soon.\u201dThat soft voice reverberated throughout the classroom.There are many tests to be taken during the school year, but the word 1st came heavily to the students. In particular, this is the first exam for the freshmen who just entered Theon.\u201cAs I told you last time, I plan to teach <Source Code> only to high-ranking students who do well in exams.\u201dRudger continued.\u201cOf course, I am not teaching the entire Source Code. What you guys can get from the first test is one of the <frameworks> that make up the Source Code.\u201dThe Source Code formula consists of a total of four frameworks. In other words, if they want to learn the entire Source Code the students must be in top 5 for all 4 tests that take place during the semester.\u201cI wonder who will learn the entire Source Code this semester.\u201dGulp.Some of the students swallowed and clenched their fists.Their responses were half mixed with anticipation and tension but in the midst of that, there were some who showed leisure.\u201cAs this is the first test, there will be no difficult content. It\u2019s a test to check how carefully you listened to my classes based on the basics.\u201dA sigh of relief erupted everywhere at Rudger\u2019s words.\u201cI think you know everything about the subject itself, but just in case you don\u2019t know, I\u2019ll tell you again. If anyone doesn\u2019t know yet, write it down now.\u201dAs soon as the words came out, the students took out their pens.Even if they already knew, they decided to write it down in case of any unforeseen circumstances.\u2018Tsk. It\u2019s stupid.\u2019Flora laughed at the students\u2019 actions since she already remembered everything Rudger had taught in her mind.\u2018Of course, I remember everything because I\u2019m smart. It\u2019s not because I never thought that the teacher\u2019s class was good.\u2019While she was rationalizing herself, Rudger introduced the subjects one by one to the students.\u201cThe range of questions will be from Mana Mechanics 1st volume, the Basics of Natural Sciences, and the Basics of Understanding and Introduction to Elements. There are a total of 20 questions and all of them are subjective.\u201dIn addition, in the case of a problem that requires calculation, he even warned firmly to write down the entire math.\u201cEven if the answer is correct, if the explanation is strange, it will be considered incorrect. In the opposite case, I will still give partial points. So, don\u2019t go over what you know vaguely, and review properly.\u201dRudger\u2019s explanation was clear and the students didn\u2019t even have any more questions to ask.\u201cIt\u2019s my first test, so I\u2019ll go lightly.\u201d\u201cLightly?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s an open book test.\u201d\u201cYes?!\u201dTo that call, some freshmen responded by asking why while an unexpected reaction burst out among the second graders.\u2018You\u2019re still a freshman, so you don\u2019t know the meaning of the open book test.\u2019People think an open book test it\u2019s a very easy test because you just have to look at the answers and write them down but it\u2019s the opposite. There is only one case when a teacher has allowed students to open books.\u2018He will make the exam so hard that it will be difficult to solve it even if the students use the book.\u2019The second graders laughed at the first graders.Rene, who knew what open book meant, did not stop writing notes even though she had a slightly blank expression on her face. Then she suddenly felt a gaze and turned her head.\u2018Huh.\u2019Flora Lumos was looking at her but that gaze just disappeared as if passing by.\u2018What?\u2019However, Rene felt a strange sense of uneasiness. She felt as if Flora was somehow looking at her with a slightly wary gaze.\u201cThe explanation of the test ends here. I will start the class right away.\u201dWith the following words of Rudger, Rene had no choice but to put an end to her doubts.* * *Soon after the class was over, the night came, announcing that the holidays were approaching. Rudger immediately finished getting ready to go out, and rode a wagon down to Leathervelk.Today was the day of the meeting about how to deal with the behind-the-scenes world of Leathervelk.Dressed in a long black coat, he pressed his hat deep down as he stood on the sidewalk. At that moment, a black-coated car stopped in front of him. One of the car doors opened and a familiar face appeared.\u201cBrother let\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cWhere did you get the car?\u201dRudger asked, sitting in the back seat naturally.Hans, who took the steering wheel, responded while starting the car.\u201cWell, the enemies of the Red Society were working on this and that. Among them was the transportation industry, and I just brought the best performing vehicles they had.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201d\u201cOh, of course, I am not saying that I use it for personal purposes. We have to be stylish when we go to the meeting.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cHow are you going?\u201dRudger pulled out his one-eyed glasses from his inner pocket, put them on, and cleaned his collar.\u201cI will go as I always have.\u201d\u201cHa-ha. You are my brother.\u201dHans drove to the meeting point.Eventually, they stopped at a street side bar lit up with colorful lights. From the entrance, customers were swarming and nearby women were waving their hands in thick make-up to solicit.\u201cIt\u2019s needlessly flashy.\u201d\u201cWell, wouldn\u2019t it be better than doing it in a dirty and dreary place?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s get off.\u201dThe two got out of the vehicle.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 72": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Academy\u2019s Undercover ProfessorCH 72Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayC72: Back Alley Talk (1)The pub was cluttered by the laughter of women with heavy makeup and perfume, and men approaching like bees, drawn to the smell of honey. There were people who were drinking and shouting loudly, and there were people playing musical instruments.\u201cIt\u2019s pretty noisy.\u201d\u201cBecause this place is quite famous and it is a bar with a total of four floors, so there are bound to be many customers.\u201dRudger and Hans entered and looked around.\u201cWhere is the meeting place?\u201d\u201c4th floor.\u201d\u201cIs it at the top?\u201d\u201cUp to the second floor, the general public can use it, but from the third floor, it is agreed that only authorized people can enter.\u201dThe two had a light conversation and went up to the second floor.The second floor was not much different from the first floor. The place was full, and it was noisy like the first floor. The only difference is that there were guards on the second floor.As Hans said, the stairs leading to the third floor were blocked by two guards with a strong body.\u201cOnly authorized people go further.\u201d\u201cHere.\u201dHans held out the invitation he had prepared in advance.The guard checked it, and without saying a word, he turned to open the way.\u201cLet\u2019s go, brother.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dHans took the lead and Rudger followed. The guard\u2019s gaze lingered on his back, but he lightly ignored it.Eventually, when he reached the third floor, Rudger immediately understood why this place was a high-end bar.\u2018It\u2019s so quiet that it can\u2019t be compared to the noisy 1st and 2nd floors.\u2019Even though it was so noisy below, the 3rd floor was soundproof. The interior is more luxurious and the customers were all dressed in neat and tidy clothes, enjoying the moody atmosphere and sipping alcohol lightly.The scarlet light made the atmosphere dreamy but Rudger and Hans\u2019 goal is one floor higher. It was the highest place in this bar, where only the most important people could gather.The two climbed the wooden stairs and arrived on the fourth floor.Unlike the 3rd floor, which was like a wide hall, the 4th floor had a long hallway.\u2018Is it a room type?\u2019It was a very suitable place for a quiet conversation.\u201cWhat room?\u201d\u201cAt the end. It is the innermost place.\u201d\u201cIs there no one guarding this place?\u201d\u201cAh. Maybe it\u2019s because this place is so special.\u201d\u201cA special place?\u201dHans explained the information he had picked up.\u201cIt is said that this bar has been used a lot as a meeting place for the organizations behind Leathervelk from before. As a result, an unwritten rule was set among themselves, and it was that they would never fight within it.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t fight\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cWell, even those who betray each other and live a damn life have iron rules or beliefs that they follow.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dRudger shook his head.\u201cAs you know, this world also has its own rules. And this is where the discipline is most strongly applied.\u201d\u201cInviting us to such a place\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just to make sure we\u2019re really following the rules.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fun.\u201dRudger smiled slightly.They have guts to target someone who destroyed the Red Society alone. If Rudger had been a little more eccentric or cruel, blood would have flown through the 4th floor of this bar today.Still, to invite him would mean that they were confident.\u201cCome in.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dEventually, the two of them reached the end of the hallway, opened the door and went inside. Various foods were placed on a large round table made of wood and those who sat at the table kept a certain distance from each other.\u2018The number of important characters is four in total.\u2019Rudger\u2019s gaze first turned to the person seated to the right of the table. He had a beard on his face but what caught his eye the most was his absurdly small stature, unbelievably small for an adult.\u2018Dwarfism.\u2019Also called short stature, it has the same body structure as a normal person, but is close to a kind of disorder with only the height being too small.\u2018Is this person the leader of a group?\u2019In a world where human rights are not yet sufficiently developed, his disability must have made life difficult. Rudger noticed that this dwarf man was the leader of the Circus, Pinion.Next he looked at the two people sitting in the middle right opposite to each other.\u2018Is it an old man and a girl?\u2019This, too, was a striking combination. An old man with gray hair and a grumpy impression, and a cute blonde girl like a doll. However, since they are gathered here, those two are also the heads of one organization.They are the leaders of the group Old Kids, Mastella and Deon.\u2018The child is surprisingly the one who has the initiative.\u2019Ordinarily, the older Deon would be seen as the leader, but Rudger did not think so because he felt a strong analyzing gaze from Mastella. She knows how to manage her facial expressions, and although she is young, she is clever.\u2018And lastly, the women of the Black Rose.\u2019There was only one person sitting to the left of the table. She was a lady in a black dress, with hair braided up and her face was covered with black cotton.\u2018Is that woman, Violetta, the one who leads the women of the Black Rose?\u2019Except for the Red Society, the heads of the behind-the-scenes world of Leathervelk had all gathered in one place and even a small number of subordinates escorted them.Rudger sat down in the seat reserved for him and opened his mouth.\u201cJames Moriarty.\u201dHis monocle gleamed in the light.\u201cEveryone calls me that.\u201dThe first to react was Violetta and an alluring voice came from beyond the black cotton yarn.\u201cAre you really that legendary man who ruled the Delica Kingdom?\u201d\u201cYou know me well.\u201d\u201cJames Moriarty, the de facto ruler of the Delica Kingdom, famous for its steel industry, and who even worked with the military to start a war with other countries.\u201dAs those words came out of her mouth, the atmosphere in the room became even heavier. In particular, Hans, who stood almost behind Rudger, did not hide his uncomfortable feelings.Rudger nodded happily.\u201cOne troublesome detective ate it all up, though.\u201d\u201cAfter that I thought you died or were arrested, I didn\u2019t expect you would show up like this in Leathervelk. So, for what purpose did you come here? Are you planning to start a war in the Empire?\u201dVioletta\u2019s voice had a strange edge. The other leaders stared intently at Rudger, perhaps of the same opinion as her.\u201cThat\u2019s a nonsensical thing to say.\u201dVioletta\u2019s words were just ridiculous. How could they speak of war without knowing the reality of what happened in the Delica Kingdom?\u201cI don\u2019t think like that.\u201d\u201cDid such a person destroy the Red Society as soon as he came here?\u201d\u201cThere was something dirty in front of me, so I just cleaned it up.\u201dRudger said as if he was indifferent to the fact that he had wiped out the Red Society but no one argued because he did it with overwhelming skill.\u201cSo what do you want?\u201dIt was Pinion, the leader of Circus, who opened his mouth this time. He had a hoarse voice that didn\u2019t suit his small body and Rudger noticed that he was smoking.\u201cComing here and accepting our invitation means that you have a purpose.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dRudger had nothing to hide, so he meekly nodded his head.\u201cI want to build my power here.\u201dPinion tapped the armrest of his chair with his finger.\u201cThat answer is not enough.\u201d\u201cDo you need more explanation?\u201d\u201cIf you got rid of the Red Society simply to create your own force, that\u2019s fine. The Red Society had a dirty personality and was our enemy.\u201d\u201cThe important point is this. Is there any guarantee that the new organization created by the famous James Moriarty will not become a second Red Society?\u201dThe second Red Society, that\u2019s what they were worried about. The Red Society did anything that made money, and they crossed the line even in the back alley so they united to fight against them.Up until now the three organizations had only managed to maintain a balance by working together but that balance was broken by an individual who appeared out of the blue.\u201cWere you worried about that?\u201dThe complexion of the people hardened at Rudger\u2019s sullen tone. It was a serious matter to them but Rudger said it as if it was nothing. Of course he had the qualifications to do so.Rudger smashed the Red Society alone and in a way he was more dangerous than them.\u201cThen it would be better to clear up the misunderstanding.\u201d\u201cMisunderstanding? What misunderstanding are you talking about?\u201dDeon raised an eyebrow and asked.Rudger shook his head once and then pointed at Mastella with his chin.\u201cSay it yourself.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cGrandpa Deon, it\u2019s okay.\u201dMastella stared at Rudger with her curious eyes.\u201cYou\u2019ve noticed that I\u2019ve done it.\u201dA child with innate talents and circumstances is far more frightening than an old man who does nothing in the world.\u201cSo what are you saying we are misunderstanding?\u201d\u201cIf I was going to get rid of you because I thought you were annoying, I would have done that long ago.\u201dIt was a blatant remark, but no one was angry or upset.\u201cBut the reason I didn\u2019t do it is because I also have a line that I must keep.\u201d\u201cSo what are you trying to say?\u201d\u201cAt least you guys are far better than the Red Society dead at my hands. I don\u2019t have to pretend with you guys, that\u2019s why I joined this meeting.\u201dAt least, when he hinted that he had no hostility, their vigilant gazes faded a little. However they didn\u2019t trust him.\u201cSo what are you going to do now? All of the infrastructure and businesses of the Red Society are nominally owned by you.\u201dPinion wiggled his mustache and ate the turkey leg that was in front of him.\u201cPinion can\u2019t you please stay still, at least in this place?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Auntie. I\u2019m not as noble as you.\u201d\u201cAuntie? That\u2019s why you uncultured people.\u201d\u201cBoth of you, do it in moderation.\u201dMastella came forward and mediated.Rudger seemed to have a rough idea of how these three organizations worked. Their relationship is bad, but there are people who can mediate the situation in moderation.\u201cSo, are you going to keep the structure of the Red Society intact?\u201dAt Mastella\u2019s bold question Rudger shook his head.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t keep such a messy thing.\u201d\u201cThen you must be thinking of something great, right?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dWhen he decided to create an organization, Rudger had already made a plan and Leathervelk will be the cornerstone for that.\u201cI am going to start a new business different from what the Red Society did, a business that can be carried out more proudly.\u201d\u201cBusiness\u2026That sounds really interesting.\u201dVioletta said in a sarcastic tone. How proud would they be if the business they were running in the back alley was honest? Even if they don\u2019t do drugs and human trafficking like the Red Society, they can\u2019t brag about their business.Reading their thoughts, Rudger grinned.\u201cIf you think that way that will be your limit.\u201d\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d\u201cSince everyone is gathered, let me make one suggestion.\u201dIt was the time to reveal his purpose.\u201cEveryone, come under me. That will bring you success.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In the case of Pinion, his lips were twitching and he wanted to start spewing insults.\u2018Brother, what are we going to do now?\u2019Hans, who was standing behind me, signaled me urgently and asked. He also seemed a bit embarrassed by what I said.Did you think that I was here to have a peaceful discussion? If so, it\u2019s time to correct that misunderstanding.\u201cI think you didn\u2019t understand, so let me tell you one more time. Everyone will come under me.\u201dAt his arrogant words Violetta showed her objection.\u201cDisgusting.\u201dShe didn\u2019t hide her feelings.\u201cI thought you would be different because you got rid of the Red Society and still decided to have a conversation with us but you and the Red Society are the same.\u201d\u201cSame?\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you forcing us to work for you?\u201d\u201cDid it look like that?\u201d\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201dI know what they\u2019re worried about. Of course, I am not demanding unconditional submission from them.\u201cYou can keep your business.\u201dAs an organization, money is essential, and of course, they must earn money in the best possible way. However, the biggest source of money was held tightly by the Red Society.\u201cDon\u2019t you want to make big money?\u201dI made them an offer that they couldn\u2019t refuse.\u201cBig money?\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about all of a sudden?\u201dNaturally, the responses that come back are full of questions so I decided to kindly explain.\u201cI got rid of the Red Society and took possession of the various business sites they occupied, but to be honest, we don\u2019t have enough people to operate all of them.\u201dWhen I spoke openly about our weaknesses, Hans was astonished. He must have been desperately hiding this fact from other organizations but in this case, it is convenient to just let it out in the open.\u201cOur organization is not yet large. As a result, inevitably, there will be fields that have not been covered yet so I will hand over the business to you.\u201dMastella asked suspiciously.\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201dI shrugged.\u201cDidn\u2019t I say? You come under me.\u201d\u201cYou mean you\u2019re letting us take over part of your business instead of going under you?\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to come under me, you don\u2019t have to but I will give you a part of the business that I don\u2019t need anyway. How you use it is entirely up to you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026I do not understand. What do you want?\u201dAt this point, they will have no choice but to feel something beyond their doubts.\u201cAs you know, I am in a difficult position to be active right now.\u201dIf I try to act as James Moriarty, the Imperial Security Agency will probably move in and try to catch me as was the case with that detective kid.What I want is to build my own firm power. However, I didn\u2019t want to make pointless enemies.\u201cI don\u2019t want useless disputes.\u201d\u201cHuh. Is the person responsible for eradicating the Red Society saying that?\u201d\u201cIt was necessary to get rid of them. Had they been left, they would have caused problems in some way.\u201d\u201cSays the one who started a war in Delica Kingdom.\u201dVioletta said sarcastically while I shrugged lightly.\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to believe, you don\u2019t have to. However, I would like to hear your answer here. Will you join hands with me or not? Of course, I\u2019m not going to force you.\u201dEven if they don\u2019t hold hands with me, they will get a part of the business. For them, there is nothing to lose.The chiefs exchanged glances with each other and weighed whether what I\u2019m saying is true and whether it\u2019s really good to hold hands with me.\u201cHmmm. Can I know exactly what that business is?\u201dPinion coughed and asked.\u201cPinion, what are you doing?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t meddle, Violetta. At first, our Circus said that it was short on supplies. If we can make money, we will do anything.\u201d\u201cThis snob\u2026\u2026!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s talk straight. In the end, this is what matters in this world.\u201dPinion made a money shape with his hand and shook it left and right.\u201cAfter all, without money, we are nothing. Doesn\u2019t it mean that people who are despised need money to live like human beings in this world? I don\u2019t understand the way you live your life.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cWhen it comes to business that makes money, we welcome it with open arms.\u201dPinion said that, but he didn\u2019t fully believe me.\u201cOf course, I want to hear in advance what that business is. Well, no matter how dangerous it is, isn\u2019t our life like that? Don\u2019t feel bad.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201dI nodded.Pinion\u2019s attitude is understandable. He has a disability called dwarfism and the organization he leads is similar to a circus troupe of people with disabilities.There is a thing called a freak show, a show that gathers deformed people and turns them into spectacles and makes money through the circus. In the 18th century, when human rights did not really exist in Europe, this freak show was popular. This Circus run by Pinion is also based on this freak show.\u2018However, the general difference is that the manager himself has a disability.\u2019Pinion is not simply trying to take advantage of people with disabilities in similar circumstances. They made this choice only because they could not survive without doing a freak show.\u201cI promise. I will never do anything that puts you in danger.\u201dPinion\u2019s eyes widened at my words.\u201cSo, what kind of business it is, can we hear a little bit about it?\u201d\u201cOf course. Pinion, do you know what kind of entertainment the nobles enjoy?\u201d\u201cWell, that\u2019s\u2026\u2026they enjoy opera and music.\u201dWhat is often called opera is the main culture of the nobility of this era. Not only the aristocrats but also the wealthy enjoy this. It\u2019s a majestic tale of gods and heroes with boring and old-fashioned stories from the tragedy of the ancient kingdom.\u201cBut why are you asking that? Surely our Circus can\u2019t do that?\u201d\u201cNo way. Isn\u2019t it too old-fashioned for nobles to enjoy now?\u201d\u201cWhat I recommend is higher than that.\u201d\u201cMore than that?\u201d\u201cNot more flashy, more fun.\u201dPinion didn\u2019t seem to understand what I was saying.That\u2019s natural, for people of this day and age, what I am going to introduce is a very unfamiliar word.\u201cDo you know what a musical is?\u201d\u201cMusi\u2026\u2026cal?\u201dA splendid performance that combines singing, dancing and theater. It\u2019s lighter, more bouncy, and freer than opera, so it\u2019s the best way for them.\u201cIt\u2019s about telling a story with the right mix of play and song, and joyfully expressing it with colorful stage lighting and dancing.\u201d\u201cHow is that different from what the nobles enjoy?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s freer. You don\u2019t necessarily have to just sing. What is important is harmony and you can dance.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Is that what we do?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dI remember the first time I came to Leathervelk and wandered around the city, people singing and dancing on the street. There is music and dance in this world so I seriously considered the existence of musicals.\u201cDo you think it will work?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dAnd I\u2019m sure of this because history tells me. Looking at the development of the culture of this era, the appearance of musicals will happen someday anyway. Not now, but it is highly likely that it will appear in at least 10 years.\u201cAre you interested?\u201d\u201cHmm. I don\u2019t know yet.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry about that. Let me show you the materials I have prepared.\u201dObviously, there will be some backlash at first. There will be people who look down on them, saying it\u2019s a low-key thing. However, just like the flow of history, the emergence of popular culture is not something that a few incumbents can prevent.I took out the script book I had prepared in advance and handed it to Pinion.Pinion took it coldly and scanned the contents quickly. The sound of turning the pages ended and Pinion said.\u201cIt seems certain that you have a clear vision. Let\u2019s do well.\u201dThose words were, in effect, the same as declaring that he would hold my hand.\u201cIt\u2019s surprising.\u201dThe heads of Old Kids, Mastella and Deon, looked at me with slight disbelief. Did they think I would use my strength to suppress them?\u201cWhat the hell do you want here, Moriarty?\u201d\u201cChange.\u201dI answered without hesitation.Most of the people in the industrial area and Forges Street were not well-recognized. The only place to go for those living here is the soot-filled factories in the industrial complex. Over 18 hours of hard work a day, a dull gray world with no pleasure whatsoever that leads to a dark future.I want to change that.\u201cI want change.\u201dIf I do that, this Forges Street where ordinary people live will become the Broadway of Leathervelk. And, of course, that will start with the people gathered here.The first work\u2026yes. I like Leathervelk\u2019s West Side Story.\u201cThere are no more back alleys of the past. Now this place will change to a place where people can live, not a dark, damp, stinky place.\u201dIt is not possible to separate levels and divide classes forever. What they need to see is not a sludge of dirty, rotting water but to look at the sky and live.I decided to give them hope and that will look like the sweetest fruit to those gathered here.\u201cOf course, I can advise other organizations besides Circus on business ideas that are suitable for them.\u201dVioletta and Mastella\u2019s gaze contained a strange aspiration.\u201cAre you serious about listening to me now?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Even I, who is proud to say that I have seen and heard many things in my own way, have never seen such a thing in my life.\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s nothing.\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. Didn\u2019t you think of it all?\u201d\u201cI, too, just saw other people\u2019s things and thought of them. I can\u2019t say they\u2019re my ideas.\u201dI\u2019m just suggesting a path based on the history of Earth I\u2019ve seen. This is not something I came up with, but a path that pioneers of an era made with blood and sweat so there is no reason to pretend they were my ideas.\u201cStill, it\u2019s surprising, all the organizations have made a promise to obey your words.\u201dThey said they\u2019d come under me, but that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re completely obeying my orders. I understand their feelings so I don\u2019t regret it because I haven\u2019t shown much yet for them to trust and follow me. So, I must successfully finish this project and win their sincere loyalty.\u201cThere are many businesses that can be used and the basic funds are enough.\u201dBusinesses used by the Red Society or the money they have saved up and even Bellbot Rickson\u2019s slush fund.\u201cBut that\u2019s not what\u2019s important right now.\u201dI stopped, turned around and stared at the corner of the alley.\u201cIf there is something you want, come out.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dShortly after Hans asked what that meant, a woman hiding in the dark appeared, a lady with a black veil over her face and black old-fashioned attire. She was Violetta, leader of the women of Black Rose.\u201cLooks like you have something else to say seeing that you didn\u2019t even bring an escort.\u201d\u201cYes. I would like for the two of us to have a quiet conversation.\u201d\u201cHmm, that\u2019s right. Hans.\u201d\u201cYes, brother.\u201d\u201cGo first.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Are you okay?\u201d\u201cHmm???\u201d\u201cI was a little worried.\u201dHans shrugged his shoulders and quickly disappeared through the alleyway. It was only me and Violetta who were left in that place.\u201cWould you like to walk for a while?\u201d\u201cNo. We\u2019ll just talk here.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dThere were many things she wanted to ask me, so she brought up the subject right away.\u201cDo you really think our business will do as you say?\u201d\u201cWhen it comes to business, it is\u2026\u2026.\u201dI suggested a musical to Circus led by Pinion. It was because I had a vision that suited it, and I thought I could do it but the women of the Black Rose are different.I can\u2019t expect splendid showmanship like Circus has from them. If so, how should they conduct business?The answer I came up with was \u2018fashion\u2019. Clothing, apparel and design, that\u2019s what I suggested to them.\u201cDo you think you can\u2019t?\u201dIn this world, clothes occupy a considerable mainstream in the market. From time immemorial, people have tried to show off their style through clothing, and they do not hesitate to spend a lot of money for it. It was still the same today.\u201cThe clothing market is dominated by aristocrats and wealthy merchants.\u201d\u201cRight.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026They\u2019ve built their own solid brands and are solidifying their position every day. It\u2019s a place where no one can squeeze in.\u201dI nodded.Those who are considered the leaders in the current fashion world are brands that sell professional clothing to the aristocrats. Expensive and good material, beautiful and colorful design, that\u2019s called\u00a0haute couture.For the upper class, it refers to clothing and clothing stores that are custom-made by individual designers. It is no different in this age as it is the property of the nobles. Whenever a banquet hall or a party is held, the ladies always wear clothes with these brands.This culture or situation has already become entrenched and for the past decade or so, it has refused to change itself.\u201cDo you think we can break through?\u201d\u201cIt will be difficult.\u201dWhen it comes to fashion in this world, it is only for the rich and wealthy but that doesn\u2019t mean that people can\u2019t be involved in fashion just because they don\u2019t have enough money.Naturally, the logic of the market is, after all, the logic of money so the flow has no choice but to follow those who have money.\u201cFashion always changes and now fashionable clothes have been around for too long. It\u2019s time to slowly change the water.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not as easy as it sounds.\u201d\u201cSurprisingly, you know a lot about the fashion world, don\u2019t you?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dAt my point, Violetta bit her mouth like a person who has been fooled.\u201cYou must have been very interested.\u201d\u201cSo what?\u201dVioletta asked, furiously. Her job is to be a prostitute who is despised by society. Although she is the head of a group and she has beautiful looks, the stigma still remains. No matter what she does, she can never escape her stigma.\u201cThere is nothing that can\u2019t be done. No, rather, if there is a lot of interest, we can see that it is fortunate that we agree with each other.\u201d\u201cYou really think that is possible.\u201d\u201cDid you not see the design drawings I gave you?\u201dThe clothes designs I gave her were less than 10, but it must have been quite a shock to Violetta. Unlike the clothes that insist on only beautiful and flashy like now, it was rather close to the opposite lighter and more comfortable clothing.It is not a fashion that only a selected few can lead, but a method that the public can choose. Mass fashion aimed at the many, not high fashion for the few. No, in this case, I should call it Pret-a-porter (a ready-to-wear suit).The clothes that clothing brands are selling now are just for show and it\u2019s difficult to wear them in everyday life. So, clothes that have been sublimated into more practical designs were born, clothes that can be worn on a daily basis but with the image of luxury.It was not the exclusive property of the nobility, but a path that could be chosen by a larger number of the population. In fact, even in the history of Earth, after the Industrial Revolution occurred, large-scale production became possible, so the old fashion faded and these popular clothes began to take shape.The upper-level culture was left behind and inevitably pushed aside by the popular culture.\u201cYes, I saw them and they were definitely surprising. I didn\u2019t think a man like you would come up with such an idea.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not mine. I also got it from someone else.\u201d\u201cWhatever it is, this is definitely innovative. Of course, there are a lot of things that need to be fixed, and there are things that are annoying.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s up to you.\u201dWhat I am trying to do in the first place is to bring those who were in the shadows to the sun. At the same time, it is no different than declaring an all-out war against the culture enjoyed by the high society.It is said to be a change that will come someday, but as long as it is pushed forward, clashes with the older generation will be unavoidable.\u201cBut we will definitely win.\u201dHistory has proven it.Although magic that did not exist on Earth exists in this world that is full of mysteries, there are bound to be some similar situations in places where people live. Wherever people live, the winds of change are sure to blow.\u201cHow long can we live under the hood?\u201d\u201c\u2026It\u2019s surprising.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cAt first I thought you were a hard and cold man, but now I see that you have more ambition than anyone else.\u201d\u201cThanks for the compliment.\u201dI answered by gently lowering the fedora hat on my head. Anyway, the ladies of the Black Rose will open a clothing store based on some of the businesses I handed over. It is premature to start dealing with luxurious things like a tailor shop from the start.Right now, they will be selling mainly clothes that the public can wear but they will be different from the clothes that are now widely spread on the street.\u201cWe will start small but gradually expand our scope.\u201dIn particular, the woman in front of me has a better eye for fashion than others. Was it a natural talent, or was it that she worked hard? Maybe it was both.It seems that she has been holding back for a long time because of her lowly origin, but she doesn\u2019t have to now. She is free to use whatever she wants.\u201cNow I don\u2019t have to worry about protecting my sisters from others. If you are such a person, then I will come forward.\u201dIn order for them to freely do what they want, they need support and I will do that role.\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cIf you want to get some ground, you should think about applying magic to fashion.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dAt my words, Violetta trembled greatly. Her expression was invisible because of her black yarn, but it was easy to see that she was astonished.\u201cDid you think I didn\u2019t know?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026How did you know?\u201d\u201cA wizard recognizes a wizard.\u201dVioletta, who was only a high-class prostitute, was able to create a power like the Women of Black Rose in Leathervelk underworld, because she was a wizard.\u201c\u2026\u2026Yes, it is at a level that is insignificant.\u201d\u201cNo matter how insignificant it is, if you don\u2019t have talent, you won\u2019t be able to learn even that magic. Who did you learn from?\u201d\u201cIt was just one of those rich wizard guests. He gave me a little candy because I served him while wearing a mask, and he was so happy that he taught me some magic.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d\u201cYeah, I couldn\u2019t cast off the status of a high-class prostitute.\u201dNo matter how much she knows how to use magic, in the end, her identity is fixed there and does not change.\u201cAre you really going to lift us up like this?\u201dThat is Violetta\u2019s true intention after all. She had ambitions, but she had no choice but to hide them. That\u2019s how the weak are in society. They are despised and despised by everyone, and for that reason, there is only one place to lean on, the deep bottom of the class system.The wall they felt was so large that they had no choice but to give up before even trying to do anything. Even Violetta, who is trying so hard to pretend to be strong, has anxieties about this business in her heart, so other people will be shocked.\u201cSure.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Seriously.\u201d\u201cThe important thing is not who does it, but how well you do it. Aren\u2019t you curious?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026What?\u201d\u201cWhen they saw the people they had been ignoring and looking down on, horribly chasing up from below. How will those high-ranking people react?\u201d\u201cAhahaha!\u201dAt my words, Violetta grabbed her stomach and chuckled. It was not like a lady who had been polite before this, but like a girl who had thrown off a heavy load.\u201cHahaha. That would be really fun.\u201d\u201cYes. It is well worth the challenge.\u201d\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll admit it. James Moriarty, you win. We women of the Black Rose will trust you.\u201dAs Violetta said so, she lifted up her veil that covered her face.\u201cSince we\u2019ve decided to be together, I can\u2019t hide it forever.\u201dAs felt by her voice and graceful behavior, she was quite a beauty. However a terrible burn was engraved on one side of the woman\u2019s face, which should have been more beautiful than anyone else.\u201c\u2026\u2026Is it a burn caused by magic?\u201d\u201cWell, what can I do? A crazy wizard who mistook his twisted possessiveness for love did this because I decided to endure from the moment I learned magic.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dI didn\u2019t ask what happened to the wizard because a wizard will not be punished by the state for only inflicting a wound on the face of a prostitute.He\u2019s probably living a good life somewhere. Nevertheless Violetta stood up to protect women in a situation similar to hers, until she was subjected to such a thing. She gave up her dream and future as a woman to do that.\u201cIsn\u2019t it ugly?\u201d\u201cNo. You are a very strong woman.\u201dSo she liked it even more. She believes in such a person and can work with them.\u201cI appreciate the lip service.\u201d\u201cDid it sound like that?\u201dThen I should give her something too.\u201cSince you showed me something, it would make sense for me to show you one thing too.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cStay still.\u201dAs I said that, I slowly reached out towards Violetta\u2019s face.She opened her eyes wide and was bewildered at the sight, but when she met my gaze, she stood still with a determined face.\u201cAs you know, I am a wizard.\u201d\u201cYes. With that power, the Red Society was wiped out. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re trying to say such an absurd thing to use magic to heal my wounds, right? It\u2019s already too late to fix this burn. Healing priests of the Lumensis Church also gave up.\u201d\u201cThat would be the case with normal magic.\u201d\u201cNormal magic?\u201dVioletta didn\u2019t seem to understand what I was saying. Maybe I don\u2019t even know how to explain it.\u201cWhat are you trying to do?\u201d\u201cJust keep in mind that it\u2019s \u2018real magic\u2019.\u201d\u201cReal magic.\u201dI said only that and raised a small amount of magical power. At the same time, I used some of the power I normally suppressed.In a dark alleyway where only the moonlight that comes down through the cracks illuminates us a pure white light that warms even the heart gently rose and disappeared.\u201cOkay.\u201dEventually, I let go of the hand I had placed on Violetta\u2019s burn marks.\u201cYeah?\u201d\u201cCheck your face.\u201dVioletta immediately took out a hand mirror and looked at her face. The burn marks that had covered a side of her face had disappeared as if washed away.Her trembling gaze turned to me.\u201cDamn, how are you\u2026\u2026What did you do?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you?\u201dI shrugged my shoulders lightly.\u201cIt\u2019s real magic.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You have a beautiful face at best, but wouldn\u2019t it be better to show it off?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dVioletta\u2019s face reddened. She hurriedly backed away from her and pulled down her black veil to cover her face.\u201cThank you for your words, but I\u2019m comfortable with it for now.\u201dRudger did not respond and Violetta calmed her pounding chest. That\u2019s weird. Why is her heart beating so fast? It feels like someone is stomping their feet.\u2018No way.\u2019While doing this, I promised myself that I would not give my heart to anyone.She thought that her heart would not like and longing for someone, because she is a prostitute who is despised by everyone. She has been that way to this day and will always be.\u2018Yes. It\u2019s just the joy of having the old scars go away.\u2019Having sorted out her feelings, Violetta barely regained her reason. She touched the spot where her scar had been with her hand. The rough touch disappeared and her smooth skin was felt. He healed scars that even priests have given up on healing in an instant.\u2018Is this real magic?\u2019Magic is magic, but what is real magic? Even Violetta, who had learned magic over time, couldn\u2019t understand the words. He seemed to shake her whole definition of magic.\u201cSo what are you going to do now?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026For now, I\u2019m going to do the work as directed, starting from tomorrow.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s good because it\u2019s fast.\u201dVioletta has also seen and heard many things. How dangerous is this man named James Moriarty in front of her and how great he is.His abilities were clearly demonstrated a while ago. It was only a small favor that he erased her scars. He gave her good intentions as if it was only natural. The more he places a greater meaning on it, the more he loses.Naturally, Violetta realized in this dark alleyway, facing each other that he is a different person from her.\u201cToday\u2019s meeting was impressive but I\u2019ll be going now.\u201d\u201cVioletta.\u201dRudger\u2019s voice catches Violetta as she is about to leave and she stops walking.\u201cWhat?\u201dRudger was staring at her back as complicated thoughts rushed through her mind. His gaze glared over as if penetrating the darkness.\u201cWhy are you calling me\u2026\u2026Whoa!\u201dVioletta couldn\u2019t finish her words. Rudger stretched out his arms and hugged her back, pulling her tight.Violetta was taken aback by the sudden event.\u201cWhat are you doing\u2026\u2026!\u201dJust as she was about to argue like that, an arrow flew past her cotton yarn. The tip of the arrow that pierced into the wall trembled.Violetta saw it and murmured as if in dismay.\u201c\u2026Surprise attack?\u201d\u201cI think so.\u201dRudger said so and roused his magical powers.\u201cCome out.\u201dAs soon as those words were finished, people with weapons appeared one after another from all over the alleyways. Rudger narrowed his eyes as he looked at them.\u2018They didn\u2019t bring a firearm.\u2019In other words, knowing that he was a wizard, they even prepared for it. Come to think of it, an arrow that was fired during the surprise attack.\u2018Is it a crossbow?\u2019They are even using stuff like this?\u2018It\u2019s a deliberate way to target a wizard.\u2019Rudger had no choice but to nod his head as he recalled whether he had caused someone to resent him to the point where he was suddenly attacked in a back alley like this.\u201cIs it the rest of the remaining Red Society?\u201d\u201cJames Moriarty.\u201dAmong the besieging crowd, a man in his mid-30s with a messy beard revealed his yellow teeth and grinned.\u201cI can\u2019t believe that such a giant is walking around alone without an escort. Thank you for giving me the opportunity.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know who you are.\u201d\u201cYou are going to die soon anyway.\u201d\u201cYou fool. Do you not know how the Red Society disappeared?\u201d\u201cYeah, I know that you are a wizard but you think we weren\u2019t prepared for that?\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201dRudger realized that the magical energy he had been generating was not working properly and sighed inwardly.\u2018Things aren\u2019t very good.\u2019It took a lot of energy to fix the scar on Violetta\u2019s face and it takes time to recover. He didn\u2019t expect to be attacked at this time.\u201cLet me go.\u201d\u201cExcuse me.\u201dVioletta glanced at Rudger over her black yarn, and she then took her position.\u201cAre you going to fight?\u201d\u201cWe are already surrounded. You\u2019re not trying to tell me to run now, are you?\u201dVioletta said as if her self-esteem has been damaged.Rudger shrugged his shoulders.\u201cI apologize if I sounded like that.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s okay.\u201dAs Violetta said so, she pulled out a black parasol from the inside of her skirt full of black frills. This is no ordinary parasol, it was obvious that it was made from a special material. Rudger realized that it was a self-defense weapon used by Violetta.\u201cYou have some pretty interesting stuff.\u201d\u201cThe hot sun is poison to a lady.\u201dRudger grabbed his wand and laid his back against Violetta.\u201cWith James Moriarty, there is even Violetta who leads the women of the Black Rose. I didn\u2019t know when the meeting was going to end, so I was curious, but I was really lucky.\u201d\u201cYou waited so long for this? Those words bring tears to my eyes.\u201d\u201cAre you pretending to be relaxed in this situation? I\u2019ll see if you can keep that attitude after your limbs are cut off.\u201dThe remnants of the Red Society drew out their weapons and slowly approached them. Rudger scrutinized their faces, but he did not soften his vigilance.\u2018The one who shot the crossbow is not here.\u2019The man was nowhere to be seen, he hid immediately after shooting.\u2018Are you trying to hide yourself in the crowd and save your life?\u2019It\u2019s not a behavior that a back alley bum would have. Even if he was a member of the Red Society, he shouldn\u2019t be at this level.\u2018Pro.\u2019A type of person who has a knack for killing people also known as contract assassin.\u2018It seems that the remnants of the Red Society raked up money and hired them.\u2019If they kill him and take back the lost business, they can make money again.Rudger inhaled calmly.A subtle smell was felt through the stagnant air of the narrow alleyway. Not the musty smell of a dark and humid alley, but a scent that tingled the tip of his nose.\u2018Is it diffusion? A drug that interferes with the operation of magical power.\u2019It\u2019s a type of drug that interferes with the magician\u2019s operation of magic and causes a major setback in the manifestation of magic techniques but brings no harm to the body.The effect of diffusion incense is not to nullify the magic but the opposite, by increasing the conductivity of the magic too much, and instead of condensing the magic, it is spread around a wide area.In other words, even if I try to make a fireball, the flame will spread around me, so the power cannot be concentrated and the caster suffers damage.\u2018It\u2019s used to make artifacts, so it\u2019s hard to obtain and it\u2019s expensive. Are they trying to use something like this?\u2019Sealing the attack magic is painful for a wizard. Of course, magic like [Silence of Fire] spreads more widely, so they didn\u2019t bring any firearms but the most important thing would be the contract assassin hiding among them.\u2018There is nothing more fatal against a professional than showing a momentary gap.\u2019They are just waiting for me to panic.\u2018Foolish. Even if you didn\u2019t use this expensive diffuser, it was difficult for me to use magic right now.\u2019In fact, Rudger could use magic however, there are disadvantages. The power is reduced and the casting time is quite long, but in the case of the casting time, using [source code] makes it meaningless.\u2018Even so, if there is an assassin, this drug must be quite deadly to wizards. Even deliberately putting up these meat shields\u2026\u2026Is he cheating?\u2019Rudger, in a quiet voice, warned Violetta as she turned her back to him.\u201cIt is a scent that interferes with the operation of magical power. For the most part, I recommend not using attack magic. It will be scattered before it is even completed.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Do you know anything about that?\u201d\u201cThe more you experience, the more you know.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s annoying. I don\u2019t like to use my body.\u201dAs she said so, she was prepared to face the enemy. Did she learn something like swordsmanship?\u2018Well, in such a difficult world, you have to learn anything.\u2019It was the same for Rudger. He was a wizard, but he didn\u2019t just use magic.\u201cThe number is about thirty but there is a dangerous one hiding among them. There might be more than one person, maybe a team\u2026\u2026about three.\u201d\u201cAre they the ones who shot the crossbow? Those who take money and kill people.\u201d\u201cAre you acquaintances?\u201d\u201cWell, they\u2019re a little bit famous so I got an idea who it is. There are people from the southern desert. I know that they are very expensive, but the work is definitely done. It looks like they spent a lot of money to kill you.\u201d\u201cExactly, me.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m already on your boat, so I\u2019m the same.\u201d* * *Oddly enough, she is very stubborn in this area. Rudger shrugged his shoulders and grinned. He didn\u2019t really like her or anything, though.\u201cSo, Lady. Do you know how to dance?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dRealizing that they were not using magic, the raiders rushed in screaming. Each one of them was armed with an iron pipe or a knife. However, the look on Rudger\u2019s face as he greeted them was somber.* * *A harsh noise erupts from the alleyway, and a huge shadow flies in the sky and is thrown onto the garbage. The face of the remnant of the Red Society who had seen his comrade beaten by Rudger became pale.\u201cHe can\u2019t use magic, so why can\u2019t you defeat him!\u201dA black parasol was swung towards the face of the man who spoke. His face is deeply depressed, and his broken teeth splatter while feet in black shoes slammed down hard on his slanted head.\u201cDie!\u201dThe remnants of the Red Society rushed behind Violetta, who had just put one down and a long sword swung towards the back of her head.Rudger cut in the middle and raised his staff to block it. The sword and the staff clashed but surprisingly, the black staff could not be cut.\u201cWhat kind of wand\u2026\u2026!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a special product.\u201d Rudger said so and swung his wand gently. The upper body of the man who had been giving strength to the long sword was thrown forward.\u201cHuh?\u201dThe moment the man panics and tries to step forward with his feet to stabilize himself the wand that Rudger was rotating slammed upward towards his lower jaw. The moment he was about to turn his head backwards, the parasol\u2019s ring-shaped handle popped out and hung around his neck to prevent him from dodging.\u201cOnce more?\u201d\u201cHowever much.\u201dRudger swung his staff as hard as he could.After being hit in the forehead, he spins several laps in mid-air and falls to the floor. More than 10 people were already lying around him, foaming.\u201cYou\u2019re a magician, why are you fighting so well!\u201d\u201cThey are just two opponents! One is a woman!\u201d\u201cThey are tired! Just push it a little bit more and it will be over!\u201dSeeing the members of the Red Society chatting among themselves, Violetta shrugged her shoulders and took a deep breath.\u201cI\u2019m a little tired. Maybe it\u2019s the lack of exercise.\u201d\u201cAfter this is over, let\u2019s start with stamina.\u201d\u201cYou give encouragement at times like this\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a pity that I can\u2019t have such a friendly personality.\u201d\u201cHuh. Moriarty looks really good.\u201d\u201cActually, this is close to my main job.\u201dAs Rudger replied, he did not forget to watch the assassins.\u2018That man.\u2019The assassin from the south clenched his fists almost involuntarily, almost at Rudger\u2019s gaze.\u2018I\u2019ve been waiting for a gap to open for a while, but he never allowed one so far.\u2019Fortunately, the female side had a few openings, but every time that happened, the man named James Moriarty blocked them.\u2018I\u2019ve been vigilant here ever since the fight started.\u2019Normally, when such a large number of people do joint work, it would be impossible to not get distracted by it but Rudger was always on guard against him. Even in the midst of that fight, his eyes kept busy searching for something.\u2018That man\u2026\u2026it\u2019s like us. No, maybe more. It\u2019s not the first time something like this has happened to me.\u2019I heard he killed a sorcerer and two quasi-knights so I spent a lot of money to use the diffusion incense that interferes with the operation of magic.There must have been a mistake with the information so he had to level up his assassination target. Even if we receive 10 times or more of the existing down payment, it is not correct.\u2018But the contract has already been made.\u2019They said they were going to do it, so they had to do it. It was their absolute credo.\u2018Once the woman is tired, we focus on that part.\u2019The number of people still standing is quite large. If we wait a little longer in this state, we will have a chance but Rudger was suddenly behaving strangely.\u2018What are you going to do?\u2019He got rid of his cane and ran away with the woman.\u2018Damn!\u2019I didn\u2019t know he was going to run away at this moment. Several people have fallen and the encirclement is loose so there was enough way for Rudger to get out.\u201cChase!\u201d* * *\u201cWhat are you doing now?!\u201d\u201cIf we keep fighting on the spot it\u2019s our loss.\u201dRudger grabbed Violetta and ran quickly into the alleyway.\u201cTake me down. I can run too.\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you tired already?\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t they going to catch up quickly anyway?\u201d\u201cBe careful not to bite your tongue.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dBefore Violetta could even ask anything Rudger used a mechanism mounted on his left wrist. With the wire launcher Rudger\u2019s body soared straight into the sky along with Violetta.The assailants who were chasing from behind stared blankly at him.\u201cThis! He\u2019s going to the roof!\u201dThe assassins who were hiding from the crowd climbed the wall with agile movements. Two climbed up the crevice of the window frame and the wall, and the other ran up the iron stairs attached to the exterior wall of the building.\u201cThey couldn\u2019t have gone too far\u2026\u2026!\u201dThe blade of the sword stick greeted the assassin who reached the roof first. The assassin, who had his forehead pierced, fell backwards down the alleyway without stepping on the roof properly.\u201cThere are two left.\u201dRudger was waiting for this moment.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Thank you for your support.Rudger had been waiting for this situation from the beginning. He already knew that the assassins were hiding in the crowd, waiting for them to wear out.\u2018If we try to break the loose siege and run away quickly, they will have no choice but to come out.\u2019Assassins, given the circumstances, carry out their missions in a frighteningly calm manner and since Rudger broke the situation they have created, the assassins had no choice but to show up.Since their plan failed they had two options to step back or to complete the mission.As Rudger climbed onto his roof, he didn\u2019t forget to watch for the enemies following him. Indeed, as he expected, the assassins quickly climbed up to the roof, revealing their true colors.The number was three, as he initially guessed and he waited for the guy who was the first to climb up the outside stairs quickly then pierced him with the sword stick at the right time.\u201cTwo are left.\u201d\u201cWhat are you\u2026\u2026.\u201dVioletta stared at Rudger in disbelief.\u201cHow the hell did you know they would move like that?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s usually the case with Southern Assassins.\u201dThe reason Rudger was certain was because the opponent was an assassin from the southern continent. To be precise, <Calsapa Assassins> led by the Fatima dynasty. They are the most famous assassination group on the continent, and they are also the most infamous.Usually assassins retreat when things go like this, but they don\u2019t.When a task is given, it is accomplished no matter what. Its near-indoctrination teachings, combined with the doctrines of the religion they believed in and followed, made the Calsapa Assassins very famous.Because of strict discipline, they were able to grow and become stronger.\u2018But the rule that the mission must be completed binds them.\u2019It was impossible to point out that they were stupid when they had a bad opponent who was a mage, who knew how to engage in close combat and was armed with strange devices.\u201cI just poked that loophole.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026You are also knowledgeable about Southern Assassins.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been targeted a few times.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dVioletta asked in disbelief and Rudger suddenly recalled the past.When he was still a kid, he was targeted by the Calsapa Assassins. At that time, he thought he was really going to die.\u2018If it wasn\u2019t for Master, I would have already died.\u2019Because of that experience, he was able to deal with them so easily now. Compared to those who chased him in the past, those who are aiming for him now are like children.They were in Leathervelk because they were kicked out since they failed their mission or came to improve their skills. Whatever it is, if Rudger looks at them from an objective level they level was far below the real ones in the south.\u201cAre you coming again?\u201dRudger\u2019s gaze, standing on the railing, was directed down the alleyway. The two assassins are busy moving in the darkness.\u201cIt\u2019s because they\u2019re Calsapa Assassin, isn\u2019t it? Their comrade is dead, but they\u2019re not affected.\u201d\u201cWhat are we going to do now?\u201dWhile Rudger was troubled, the assassins who had hidden themselves in the dark moved. They popped out of the building crevices and quickly threw their daggers.\u201cHuh!\u201dBut Violetta did not stand still. She opened wide the black parasol she was holding in her hand. As if proving that it was not made of ordinary material, the sharp daggers could not penetrate her parasol.\u201cAh, this.\u201d\u201cIt seems that the parasol has no resistance to poison at all.\u201dThe poison applied to the tip of the dagger corroded her parasol. Meanwhile, the assassins hid themselves.\u201cHey, how have they done this\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cIt is a special poison used by the Calsapa Assassins. When it comes into contact with the skin, it seeps into the body and is quite dangerous, and it disassembles any armor.\u201d\u201cThey can throw it with a knife?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a special dagger. To be precise, it was coated on the dagger by melting celvantium, a rare metal from the south. Celvantium is the main export product of the Fatima dynasty, and it is a special product called the metal of the gods. It is very resistant to corrosion.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dWhen information leaked from Rudger\u2019s mouth, Violetta decided not to ask him any further. She had accepted that what this man said was not strange.\u201cSo how do we respond?\u201d\u201cYou have to hold out until they run out of daggers to throw.\u201d\u201cCan we?\u201d\u201cSince the parasol has melted, we can\u2019t and we can\u2019t even use magic right now.\u201dIn other words, if they do not dodge the next attack, they will die.\u201cThen we should move first.\u201d\u201cWhere?\u201d\u201cBack down.\u201dIt was perfect to become a prey for the assassins on the open roof.Rudger reached out to Violetta without a word. She hesitated and took his hand.\u201cHold on tight.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dRudger grabbed Violetta in one of his arms and jumped from the roof.\u201cHuh?\u201dOne of the members of the Red Society, who were scattered to chase after Rudger and Violetta, had his head smashed in Rudger\u2019s shoe.Rudger got down to the alley using one person as a buffer and ran blindly without looking for the assassin\u2019s location.\u2018Are you trying to hide?\u2019The assassins did not understand Rudger\u2019s actions at the moment. He went to the roof, and they suddenly came down again.\u2018It is an unpredictable target. I\u2019ll have to be careful.\u2019One of his colleagues has already been killed.The two Assassins exchanged glances at each other in the dark. That alone conveyed the meaning. One will chase right behind and the other will be moving from above and blocking the way.\u2018Catch them before they escape.\u2019With that thought in mind, the assassin, who was secretly chasing Rudger and Violetta, found a black shadow in front of him and stopped walking.He found the target but something is strange.\u2018The woman is alone? What about the man?\u2019Has he left her? Certainly, looking at the battle just before, the woman looked like a burden.\u201cCome on, wait! How could you leave me?\u201dAs if she had actually been abandoned, she stood up and screamed but the assassin wasn\u2019t sure if it was a trap or not.\u2018Maybe he never really left. Is it a trap? Are they trying to confuse me?\u2019The escape to the roof a while ago was also a trap. Perhaps a man named James Moriarty is hiding somewhere around him.The assassin slowly walked towards Violetta with a poisoned dagger in his hand. His gaze turned to Violetta, who was left alone, but his ears were set high to pick up the sounds around him.At that moment, he heard a small sound in his ear from the right.\u2018It\u2019s here!\u2019The assassin determined that this was where Rudger was hiding and immediately threw his dagger but nothing was hit.\u2018What?! There was definitely a sound.\u2019He is highly trained to handle such situations and could never have been wrong.\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate.\u201dA voice came from behind him as if it suddenly popped out of the air. Rudger stood behind him.How and when? Rather than having such a question, the assassin unconsciously moved his body based on the training he had received.He grabbed the dagger and swung it backwards\u2026\u2026But before the assassin could move, Rudger\u2019s sword stick pierced him from behind.\u201cHow\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe sound came from the right side, but he appeared from behind?\u201cIt\u2019s that kind of magic.\u201dRudger said as he pulled out the sword stick from his body. The remnants of the diffusion still remain but Rudger reversed the diffusion direction.He combined sound magic and coordinate designation magic to make the direction the sound came from difficult to distinguish.\u201cYou got him?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dVioletta was embarrassed when Rudger asked her to play the role of bait but she did as she was told and he killed one more assassin.\u2018Well, it\u2019s magic that lets out sounds from different directions. It must be embarrassing for those who suffer.\u2019But when you fight for your life, there is no need to be considerate to your opponent.\u2018Now there is only one left.\u2019At times, a cool breeze blows through the alleyway.\u2018The diffuse scent is slowly washed away.\u2019In the end, it has to remain in the atmosphere to be effective, and since we\u2019re in an alleyway, it is maintained for a long time but since the wind blows, it will eventually disappear.Now time was on Rudger\u2019s side and at that moment, a black shadow fell over his head.\u201cAbove!\u201dVioletta saw it and reacted, but it was already too late.The assassin threw something at Rudger.\u201cHmm.\u201dRudger raised his sword stick as if he knew this, but what the Assassin\u2019s threw was not a poisoned dagger, it was a hook on a chain.The hook caught the middle blade of the sword stick, pulled it with strong force and the sword stick slipped out of Rudger\u2019s hand. The assassin, who came down to the ground, threw the sword caught in the hook on the floor and rushed towards Rudger.A sharp dagger was pulled from his waist.\u201cIt\u2019s dangerous!\u201dVioletta exclaimed and the assassin was sure of victory. There was no time to use magic and he stole the target weapon. Two of his compatriots died, but he accomplished his mission nonetheless, the assassin thought so.Even on the brink of death Rudger did not lose his composure.\u2018What? Why the hell are you looking like that\u2026\u2026.\u2019He couldn\u2019t understand the situation but his thoughts didn\u2019t go any further. It was because in that moment when he ran towards him, Rudger\u2019s two hands moved faster and faster.\u201cHuh?\u201dThe assassin, who had precisely cut the nape of Rudger\u2019s neck, collapsed on the ground, his body relaxed.\u201cYou were distracted at the crucial moment.\u201dRudger lightly wiped his blood from the crescent-shaped karambit dagger held in his hand. The assassin in front of him revealed a gap in his conviction that got him killed. If you are going to kill your opponent, you have to be vigilant and do your best at every moment.\u201cThat momentary complacency killed you.\u201dRudger picked up the sword stick that had fallen on the floor. After checking to see if the blade had been damaged, he decided that it was still intact and put it in his bag immediately.Rudger gripped his staff and stretched his collar lightly.\u201c\u2026\u2026Did you best the Southern Assassin in close combat?\u201d\u201cWhy? What else do you want to know?\u201d\u201cEven if I\u2019m curious, I won\u2019t ask.\u201dIt was hard to count how many times Violetta was surprised today and at this time a cry from the Red Society was heard from afar.\u201cIt\u2019s here! The sound came from this way!\u201d\u201cCome on catch them! If they run away, it\u2019s all over!\u201dVioletta stared at Rudger.\u201cWhat are you going to do now?\u201d\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201dRudger shrugged his shoulders.\u201cAll the diffuse scent is gone.\u201d\u201cOh yeah?\u201d\u201cYes. So leave it to me.\u201dIn the black cotton yarn, Violetta smiled alluringly. The fact that she was able to use her magic, which had been banned for a while, means that she has an opportunity to do her own thing.She lifted the parasol, which was almost melted. It was a weapon for her self-defense, but at the same time it was also a staff that helped her concentrate her magical powers.\u201cI\u2019ll take care of the rest.\u201dThe sound of footsteps getting closer and a horde of the Red Society members appeared.\u201cIt\u2019s here! They are\u2026\u2026!\u201dAnd what greeted them was a blade of wind that sharply cut through the darkness.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There must have been quite a bit of commotion, but the cops don\u2019t come all the way here since this is a sparsely populated alleyway, that\u2019s why murders take place like meals here.\u201cIs it all over?\u201d\u201cYes. There doesn\u2019t seem to be anyone left.\u201dVioletta said as she shook her hand. Perhaps it was because she had wasted quite a bit of mana when she was using attack magic but her voice seemed to be a bit tired.I stood still and secretly took out a pill and chewed it.\u201c\u2026\u2026Really. If you\u2019re fine, please help me.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cIs this a test to check my skills?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. Oh, is it because I just watched the remnants of the Red Society get cleaned up? Because I can\u2019t spend mana carelessly, I just stayed still. Wouldn\u2019t I be a hindrance if I interfered when my allies use magic?Apparently, Violetta interpreted my attitude a little differently.\u2018It doesn\u2019t matter.\u2019I don\u2019t need to correct the misunderstanding, my priority is to restore my mana.\u201cThese guys did it pretty splendidly. After the organization was completely destroyed, they recruited people to launch a surprise attack.\u201d\u201cThey must have been desperate or maybe too greedy.\u201d\u201cWell, they must have thought that they would have everything if they killed us but they would know for sure that they would suffer losses unless they were idiots\u2026\u2026.\u201dVioletta couldn\u2019t finish her words properly because she had something to do with it. Come to think of it, the Red Society hired the Calsapa Assassins. No matter how novice they are, they are highly trained assassins so they should be very expensive.\u2018Did they have enough money?\u2019It wouldn\u2019t have been easy even if they had a slush fund that they hid. Besides, those bastards, knowing that the assassins failed to kill us, did not run away and rushed at us. Did they think we\u2019ve lost our strength? Didn\u2019t the people who lived in the back alleys know about it?\u2018They couldn\u2019t run away.\u2019They couldn\u2019t escape and had no choice but to fight us. Then why couldn\u2019t they escape?\u201cThey were pushed.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cThe remnants of the Red Society.\u201dAt my point, Violetta seemed to have realized something, and exclaimed,\u201c\u2026\u2026If so, then there are other people involved in this matter.\u201d\u201cThey probably provided the money to hire the assassins.\u201d\u201cWho are they? There can\u2019t be too many people who have that kind of power in the back alley\u2026\u2026.\u201dI shook my head.\u201cMaybe it\u2019s not someone from this world.\u201d\u201cI hope so\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cOkay. Someone up there, who doesn\u2019t like this situation, must have been involved.\u201dAlso, someone who is somewhat nimble about the situation here and can secretly provide money.\u201cI thought it\u2019s related to Bellbot Rickson, but that\u2019s not it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026There were suspicions that Dutri had ties with Bellbot Rickson.\u201d\u201cThere is no doubt. They actually had a connection.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve heard it from Dutri myself, so I\u2019m pretty sure.\u201d\u201cWait a minute. Did you hear it yourself? When? Before you kill him?\u201d\u201cI haven\u2019t killed him yet. Now, Dutri is locked up by my subordinates.\u201dVioletta was speechless for a while.\u201cAlmost everything was sorted out, but he is still the head of the Red Society. He should have spit it out if he knew anything more.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026You are strict.\u201d\u201cDutri took advantage of the Red Society to team up with Bellbot Rickson. He was paid and did the dirty work for him.\u201d\u201cBut Bellbot Rickson is dead. I saw in the newspaper, it\u2019s said he was attacked and killed by a werewolf.\u201d\u201cI killed him.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Yes?\u201d\u201cI was the one who killed Bellbot Rickson.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cIt is said that he was attacked by a werewolf, but the reality is different. Bellbot Rickson secretly used the Red Society to make tests on humans.\u201d\u201cWhy did you tell me that?\u201dWhen the story of the incident came out of my mouth, Violetta looked very embarrassed. It would be rather embarrassing to hear a truth that you didn\u2019t expect.\u201cSo I killed Bellbot Rickson. I gave a worthy end to a man who violated human dignity and when I searched his safe and ledger, I caught the tail of the Red Society.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026So you got rid of the Red Society?\u201d\u201cAnyway, I also have to settle here and I didn\u2019t really want to stand with them.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dWell, I understand the surprise and you\u2019ll wonder why I\u2019m saying this.\u201c\u2026\u2026I will make sure this is a secret.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s good that you understand quickly.\u201dThis will prevent Violetta from thinking of betraying me.Although we had already fought together and I gave her a vision for her organization to move forward as a human being, even if she received various benefits, later she will quickly forget and might betray me.\u2018This is a kind of intimidation.\u2019I killed Bellbot Rickson, one of the richest people in Leathervelk. In other words, unless it was a noble, I could kill everyone else if I wanted to. This fact alone will make my presence even greater for Violetta.\u201cYou are a smart woman. You will understand what I am trying to do.\u201d\u201cThis time, we have to find the person who instigated the Red Society that attacked us.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d\u201cI will be very busy. I have to carry on the business you told me to do.\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t you?\u201dAt my question, Violetta shook her head.\u201cThat\u2019s a statement that hurts my self-esteem but I\u2019m sure I can take care of it.\u201d\u201cSo be it. If you can\u2019t show that level of performance, you\u2019ll be in trouble. I\u2019ll hand over Dutri to you as a reward for your hard work.\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you still holding him?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s in a state of disrepair, unable to walk properly. You are free to use him to extract information or kill him.\u201dI could hear Violetta swallowing her saliva and smiled softly\u201cThere were a lot of things that were piled up, so you can use any method. This is also my gift to you.\u201dThe reason Dutri was spared was not to extract information, but to leave him alive and leave a good impression on the other three organizations.As they had many connections with the Red Society, they must be the ones who want to kill Dutri more than anyone else.\u201cI will work hard. More than you would expect.\u201d\u201cGood answer. I\u2019ll see you later.\u201d\u201cThe bodies\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cIn the back alleys, people don\u2019t ask the reason for death because the dead do not speak.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Yes. I know.\u201dVioletta bowed her head politely towards me. Nominally she is an equal partner with me, but already she has sworn allegiance to me.It wasn\u2019t a bad feeling.* * *\u201cIs brother done?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Somehow, a mysterious group was going to the place where brother was. Have you met?\u201dInstead of answering, I slowly removed the one-eyed glasses from my face and took off my coat.Hans nodded his head knowingly.\u201cI think you\u2019ve got it all sorted out.\u201d\u201cThey even hired the Calsapa Assassins.\u201d\u201cThose crazy\u2026.\u201d\u201cThey were newbies out to gain experience.\u201d\u201cBut isn\u2019t Calsapa still Calsapa?\u201d\u201cSo you have to move a little.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cThere are people behind the scenes who ordered us to be killed. It seems that the Red Society is disappearing and a new one is coming in, which is not a small thing.\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m dying to check the listings at the Kunst auction house right now\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cIf you can\u2019t, don\u2019t.\u201d\u201cNo, I will. It is directly related to my life, and I cannot afford to waste it.\u201dAs soon as I hung the coat on the hanger, the door swung open with a loud bang. This is our secret base, where people rarely come, even in the back alleys. It was a place where ordinary guests would never come but the door was opened and she appeared.\u201cIs it Seridan?\u201d\u201cFive.\u201dAt my words, the little girl who had just entered the room looked at me and her eyes lit up.\u201cIt was Nari after all!\u201dLightly tanned brown skin and white hair tied in two comfortably. The raised eyes and corners of the mouth look full of playfulness. She was wearing loose-fitting trousers and a loosely draped shirt with a lot of oil on it.Iron Feet Seridan is a dwarf girl who is the developer and inventor of the wire launcher I use.\u201cIt\u2019s still powerful and noisy.\u201dSaying so, I loosened the strap that had been attached to my left arm and threw it at her. She jumped out of her place, grabbed the device, and checked its condition right away.\u201cHmm\u2026The tip of the launcher is worn out, and some of the cog screws are loose. Besides, I have to change the wire.\u201d\u201cI had a lot to do.\u201d\u201cThis fitting is loose, I think it happened because one more person was added to the original weight? I told you to be careful, this is for a single person to use! It\u2019s just barely enough to raise a person with all kinds of stuff like Nari!\u201d\u201cI used it that way because it was strong.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t know how delicate machines are?!\u201d\u201cSo you can\u2019t fix it?\u201d\u201c10 minutes is enough!\u201dWhen it comes to machines, she\u2019s more of an expert than anyone else. The sword sticks and saw blade boomerangs I used were all made by her. Of course, it was me who provided her ideas.When I give her a rough idea, she gets stuck on it and invents like crazy.\u201cHey, assistant! Help me!\u201d\u201cWho is your assistant?\u201dWhen Seridan called, Hans shouted.\u201cIf your sister says come, you will come! Won\u2019t you come?\u201d\u201cI got it! So get rid of that mouse tooth!\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t listen to me you\u2019re getting stabbed by this. Okay?\u201d\u201cDamn it. Brother, please stop that bastard.\u201d\u201dIt\u2019s fine.\u201dThat\u2019s what I said, but actually, I can\u2019t stop Seridan either because she\u2019s impossible to control. I\u2019m just glad that she didn\u2019t cause such a fuss with me.Seridan\u2019s riot is mainly directed at Hans, because she knows his weakness and deliberately carried something like a mouse\u2019s tooth to threaten him.\u201cThen, I will go to the workshop first! Come quickly!\u201dHans clenched her fists as she watched her go away like a storm.\u201cThat little bastard.\u201d\u201cEven if she looks like that, she\u2019s older than you.\u201dSeridan looks like a little girl because she\u2019s a dwarf, but she\u2019s actually older than Hans.\u201cI know. Damn. Why is she only doing this to me?\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026\u2026.\u201dBecause she\u2019s happy, but I couldn\u2019t say that because Hans\u2019 expression quickly turned gloomy.\u201c\u2026\u2026Are there more people coming here?\u201d\u201cBy the way, Seridan is not allowed to touch gunpowder.\u201d\u201cI know that, because I don\u2019t want to die either.\u201dIron Feet Seridan is a great inventor and developer, but perhaps because of her terrifying personality, she was also a time bomb. However, the problem is that she\u2019s a time bomb not a metaphorical meaning. If she has real gunpowder, she will try to make all kinds of bombs.\u201cDo you remember when brother and I first saw that bastard?\u201d\u201cIt was an underground mine in the Kingdom of Delica. They illegally enslaved different races and forced them to mine day and night.\u201d\u201cI do. That guy was also caught there.\u201d\u201cIt would be foolish to say that she was caught.\u201d\u201cI think so too.\u201dWhen I was using the James Moriarty identity me and Hans sneaked into a mine and found Seridan who was secretly making a bomb to blew up the tunnel.\u201cIf it exploded, we would all be dead, right?\u201d\u201cIf the tunnel collapsed 1km below the ground, even the strongest knights would\u2019ve died.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026I have to take care of that crazy bastard who tried to destroy a tunnel.\u201d\u201cTake care.\u201dHans has a lot of trouble and surprisingly, only one member of our new organization <U.N. Owen> has come so far.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I wanted to resume releases last week but I\u2019ve been super busy these past 2 weeks. Now I\u2019m finally free so I hope to release 3 chapters daily this week.There were still ten minutes left until Seridan will fix the wire launcher.Considering her personality\u2026\u2026Perhaps she\u2019s got another flashy idea, and she\u2019ll add extra features.She said 10 minutes, but considering the process, it would probably take 30 minutes.\u2018If it\u2019s 30 minutes, I still have time.\u2019It\u2019s time to get some rest and then go back to Theon, he thought, as he looked down from the window on the third floor.\u2018What?\u2019Three black shadows were busily moving in the middle of the alleyway where no one was going. Second to their inconsistent movement, their steps are unusual.\u2018It\u2019s fast and light, well centered and their body doesn\u2019t sway.\u2019It was just a coincidence that I found them. Their movements were so secret that I would not have noticed if I hadn\u2019t looked down the window at the moment. They were covered in dark robes so I couldn\u2019t see them clearly, but I knew who they were right away.\u2018Highly trained knights.\u2019They were also of a different level compared to the two quasi knights who were working for Dutri.Ordinary knights wouldn\u2019t even be interested in the back alley, so why are they here? Besides, the direction they are heading is not the place where I and Violetta were fighting the Red Society just before.I narrowed my eyes and watched them carefully.\u2018If you are a knight and are not afraid to wander around a place like this\u2026\u2026.\u2019No way\u2026\u2026.The moment when I was about to come to a conclusion the knight who was moving at the forefront stopped his steps and threw his gaze towards me but I hid by the window.\u2018Did he notice?\u2019I was watching them carefully, but he has a better sense than I thought. Fortunately, the gaze that had been staring at me for a while was quickly removed.\u2018\u2026\u2026The security bureau.\u2019To be precise, the Nightcrawler Knights belong to the Intelligence Department of the Security Agency.Unusual people who move secretly contrary to the knights who stand on a shining stage where everyone is watching and do honorable things.The Nightcrawler Knights eliminate those who threaten the nation in a dark place out of the sight of people. A being that willingly chose and accepted to walk a path stained with blood and mud for the sake of the country.Therefore, they are a symbol of fear and a target of caution to those who know. They are also the most dangerous people to meet in such a dark and narrow street than on a highway in broad daylight.\u2018When I looked a little while ago\u2026\u2026At first glance, it looked like silver hair.\u2019When it comes to knights with silver hair in the Security Bureau of the Exilion Empire, there is one person that comes to mind.\u2018No way\u2026\u2026Is she here?\u2019The general commander of the Security Bureau and the commander of the Nightcrawler Knights, which consists of only elites, a guardian angel who protects the empire, Lord Protector Trina Ryanhowl.\u2018Why is she here? Maybe it was because of the werewolf incident.\u2019He vaguely guessed.The reason is probably the death of the cryptid, who appeared in Leathervelk, and the rich man, Bellbot Rickson.The Security Agency\u2019s intelligence network would have learned that Bellbot Rickson had partnered with someone to conduct some kind of experiment since their eyes are spread all over the empire.\u2018Even so, the Nightcrawler Knights will come out on their own.\u2019After all, they conducted human body experiments on ordinary citizens. Even a warlock was involved, so it would be strange for them not to come out of the security department.\u2018They should have investigated Bellbot Rickson\u2019s mansion and discovered the secret safe that had been stolen.\u2019They must have even noticed that the flames in the basement of the abandoned factory that I had burned down.Everything inside was removed without leaving a trace, but the problem is that no matter how much fire burned, the fact that \u2018something was there\u2019 cannot be erased.They may have launched an investigation in response to that. This is a bit of a problem since knights of the Security Agency, even the knight commander are in Leathervelk.\u2019In particular, Trina Ryanhowl was not a very good match for me. That monstrous woman is one of the few things I don\u2019t want to get involved with again in my life.\u2018I\u2019m glad I hid.\u2019If our eyes met and she had sensed something suspicious she would have come to me.\u2018It must have been a big deal because that woman has a very strong intuition.\u2019I have no choice but to move cautiously until the Security Agency decides that the case is a dead end and leaves Leathervelk.\u2018First of all, I\u2019m glad I don\u2019t have to step on my tail.\u2019They probably will close the investigation however if Trina Ryanhowl continues to stay in Leathervelk that might not be the case.She held a prestigious position in the Empire and if she wastes her time trying to catch the tail of an unresolved case, it will open a big hole in the security of the empire.\u2018Maybe she\u2019ll leave some of the knights behind.\u2019If that\u2019s the case, that\u2019s fine, without the leader Trina, I\u2019m confident that I can avoid their gaze, no matter how good they are.As I was thinking about it, I heard a thumping noise from below and the door was open. Soon after, Seridan appeared with a stick in her arms.\u201cI made it!\u201d\u201cIs it over? It was sooner than I expected.\u201dI thought it would take 30 minutes, but it took 20 minutes.I can tell by looking at whether there is so little to change, or whether her skills have improved by leaps and bounds.\u201cYes! Originally, it was supposed to take 10 minutes more, but when I was repairing it, I thought of some things and finished earlier!\u201dI looked at the armband that Seridan handed me.The one I was using was quite large enough to reach from my wrist to my forearm, but it was a pretty radical change this time and the size was reduced to less than half.\u201cIt\u2019s smaller and thinned out.\u201d\u201cAnd even more comfortable!\u201dSheridan\u2019s ponytails of pure white hair fluttered up and down her as she spoke. Even though my gaze was taken away from it for a while, I turned to the wire launcher I held in my hand again.\u201cHave you removed all the useless parts?\u201dSince it also serves to protect the forearm, the armband I was wearing was sized to cover the entire forearm.What Seridan has been able to fix this time around is only about 1/3 of the forearm from the wrist.\u201cYeah. You\u2019re not a hunter right now, are you? So I put more emphasis on convenience than performance.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right. I\u2019m not a hunter now, I\u2019m a magician.\u201d\u201cOh, what should I call you then? Van Helsing? Moriarty? Lupin?\u201d\u201cCall me Rudger Chelici.\u201d\u201cMmm. Rudger sounds amazing. This time you\u2019re a magic teacher, at Theon\u2019s! That\u2019s great!\u201d\u201cSomething happened.\u201d\u201cI know, I know. As expected you infiltrated the most famous place in the Exilion Empire. That was a piece of cake, right? Well, as expected, Nari.\u201dIt seems to her that I am a terrifying person with great ability. Becoming a teacher of Theon seems to have taken place because of my tremendous abilities.That\u2019s not the truth. That said, I was caught up in terrorist attack on a train, and I accidentally became a magic teacher, so I decided to just go along.\u201cAnyway, as Nari said, I boldly took off the troublesome things and put in only what you needed. The wire launcher will work properly, so check it out.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201dI put the brace on my left arm. Maybe because the material was changed, it feels like my arm is bent gently rather than the thick and hard texture from before, even when worn over a shirt.The fit has definitely improved, now let\u2019s see what it can do.\u2018I\u2019ll have to try it over there.\u2019I shot the wire launcher at an empty wall. The wire launcher fired at a terrifying speed and then pierced the wall. This is a bit surprising.\u201cThe power has grown considerably.\u201d\u201cYes. The output is almost doubled compared to the previous one! The wire strength has been increased, and the hooks have been renewed! It is now possible to move with one more person!\u201d\u201cIs that so? I think there are other features added.\u201dHaving retrieved the wire, I asked, pointing my finger at the small groove on the back of my hand.Seridan grinned, revealing her white teeth.\u201cOh, that? Nari is the best. You have good eyes. It\u2019s a new function that I added this time.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cThink of it as clenching your fists and flexing your wrists.\u201d\u201cLike this?\u201dRing.At that moment, a pure white sword came out of the thin groove in the wristband.\u201cThis\u2026\u2026.\u201dHow is it? Isn\u2019t that cool? It is made of the same material as the blade of the sword stick used by Nari, so it is very light and strong. Nari told me that there are some assassins who use these things.\u201d\u201cI did.\u201d\u201cI just thought of it and applied it. What do you think?\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201dWhen I relaxed my wrist lightly, the protruding blade went back inside. It would be perfect to use it in an emergency or when the opponent is careless. This wasn\u2019t made for fighting against cryptids but humans.\u201cAside from that, see the little hole on the left?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cYou can shoot a paralyzing needle from there! Of course, you have to load the paralysis needle in advance!\u201d\u201cWhoa.\u201dPreviously, only the wire launcher was fired from the lower part of the wrist, and its other role was to block attacks, but this time it\u2019s the exact opposite. It maximizes other factors instead of defense.In particular, for a person who has to use this secretly without being exposed to the outside like me, the newly changed wristband by Seridan was a very welcome item.\u201cI like it.\u201d\u201cAs expected! Nari knows well! That coward who was downstairs was only talking nonsense like that you shouldn\u2019t put such a dangerous thing in it.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be too harsh on Hans. He only said that because he\u2019s worried.\u201d\u201cYour opponents have to worry about it, not you.\u201dAs Seridan said so, she supported her chin with her index finger and thumb and stared at me with a mysterious gaze.\u201cWell, I\u2019ve always felt this way, but you look really nice in such a calm-looking outfit. It was not bad to wear wild clothes when you were a hunter, but I think this suits you better.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cYes. The moment I saw you, I immediately felt that you were a noble person. No, a nobleman is not enough, you look like royalty.\u201dAt Seridan\u2019s words, I couldn\u2019t help but laugh.\u201cI\u2019m glad you think so.\u201d\u201cNo, I have a feeling.\u201d\u201cAnyway, thanks for the new one.\u201d\u201cOh, you\u2019re leaving now?\u201d\u201cYeah. I have to be a teacher first, so I have to stay at the academy. Coming out today was part of my outing.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s too bad. It\u2019s been a long time since we met, and I thought we could have a long chat!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll take a rain check on that since we haven\u2019t all gathered yet.\u201dBesides Sheridan, there are a few more I have called.Sheridan nodded gladly, perhaps because she knew it.\u201cI know! They\u2019re members of the new organization, right? People I\u2019ve heard of!\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cDid you say the name of the new organization is U.N.Owen? Very mysterious, I like it because it suits you! So I became a member of this secret organization?\u201d\u201cAn executive.\u201d\u201cExecutive!\u201dDid she like her position as an executive? Her eyes sparkled even more.\u201cIf I\u2019m an executive, I can make anything without being interfered with by anyone, right?\u201dWas it because of that?\u201cI\u2019ll allow it for a while, but won\u2019t you refrain from making bombs that will blow up the surrounding area?\u201d\u201cOf course I know that! I also know how to read between lines. You\u2019re telling me to make enough bombs.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s best not to make them at all.\u201dWell, banning this crazy inventor would be crueler than forcing a bone marrow smoker to quit.\u201cJust do it in moderation.\u201d\u201cHehehe. Don\u2019t worry about it! So Nari, have you decided on that?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s a secret organization like this, there must be a code name!\u201dA code name? She must have heard something from somewhere.I didn\u2019t really care much about it but seeing Seridan like that I know she\u2019ll be disappointed if I don\u2019t agree with her. If that happens, Hans won\u2019t be able to handle her irritation.\u201cA code name?\u201dWell, there\u2019s nothing you can\u2019t name if you want.\u201cWells would be nice.\u201d\u201cHuh? Wells? That\u2019s a good codename. Good! I\u2019m Sheridan, the executive of U.N. Owen, from today!\u201dI\u2019m glad she\u2019s happy.\u201cWhere did this Wells come from?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the name of the greatest inventor I remember.\u201d\u201cOh, if you say so, he must be a great man.\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dHe is the creator of a machine that travels through time. The name Wells I gave her is from Herbert George Wells, the author of the novel Time Machine.In fact, I wanted to give her the name of the main character of the Time Machine novel, but the original story only mentions time traveler not his name. However, in the sequel that was officially recognized, George, the artist\u2019s middle name, was attached to respect the original author.But George is not a good codename for a girl so I gave her Wells instead of George. Seridan seems to like it, so everything is good.\u201cThen what about the assistant lying down there? Does the assistant have a code name too?\u201dSeridan asks with a twinkle in her eyes. She seems to be bothering him all the time, but did she still care about Hans?Considering Hans characteristics his codename should be\u2026\u201cKafka.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 79": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Academy\u2019s Undercover ProfessorCH 79Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayC79: The Approaching Nightcrawlers (1)Trina Ryanhowl, who was leading the way, stopped and looked back.\u201cLeader? What\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026No. Nothing. I just felt like someone was looking over here.\u201d\u201cNo way.\u201dLloyd said so by fixing his glasses under the hood, but Enya was different.\u201cThe leader has a better sense than us, so just in case. That\u2019s why we\u2019re here.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201dIt was Trina Ryanhowl\u2019s fault that the three men, sent to investigate the mystery of Bellbot Rickson\u2019s death, are now roaming the alleyways in the middle of the night.She, who has a good sense, came here with two deputy officials as if she were hooked on something.Lloyd was dissatisfied and complained. For him, who values reason and scientific thinking, the sixth sense seemed like a children\u2019s fairytale.\u201cThe back alley it\u2019s all about gangsters fighting and killing each other and vagrants anyway.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a little different this time.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the difference?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what my hunch is saying.\u201d\u201cAnother hunch?\u201dLloyd couldn\u2019t say anything to Trina, because Trina was clearly his superior, and above all, her senses were surprisingly good.She made a lot of achievements that didn\u2019t make sense thanks to her good senses and has been successful in missions, which others thought were impossible. Therefore, Lloyd did not show it on the surface even though he was unhappy.\u201cIt\u2019s here.\u201dThere were several bodies scattered at the scene.\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 quite a lot of bodies.\u201d\u201cIs there some kind of war going on here?\u201d\u201cThere must have been a fight between the organizations.\u201dTrina strode toward the bodies and confirmed it by squatting in front of one of the dead bodies, especially one that stood out.\u201cAn assassin.\u201d\u201cWhat? What?\u201d\u201cThis body. It\u2019s not just a regular assassin.\u201dTrina frowned at the sour smell from the bottle hanging from the waist of the body.\u201cIt\u2019s a poison. A special poison used by Calsapa assassins.\u201dThe body itself seemed no different from the others around it, but it was nothing more than a disguise to avoid being noticed by the other party.At Trina\u2019s words, Lloyd and Enya also came closer and checked the body.\u201cIndeed. There are definitely signs of training, rough hands full of calluses and even the small scars on the body. This is not something we can see in the back alley bastards.\u201d\u201cWow. The Calsapa Assassins are the famous assassination group from the Southern Fatima dynasty right?\u201d\u201cThey are terrifying bastards who don\u2019t even spare their lives to kill their targets. But why is he in this back alley\u2026\u2026?\u201dTrina got up.\u201cLeader?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s a Calsapa Assassin, but maybe he came all the way here because he was wandering around to gain experience after training, or he was kicked out for lack of ability.\u201d\u201cBut isn\u2019t he a highly trained assassin?\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s true that they\u2019re not the kind of people who would be stuck in this place.\u201dBut such a Calsapa Assassin died in the back alley, it was an unbelievable result.\u201cThe cause of death is probably a wound on the forehead. A thin blade pierced his forehead at once and it fell from top to bottom.\u201dTrina looked up at the night sky full of clouds that was blocked by the walls of the alleyway, making it seem cramped.\u201cI don\u2019t know who his opponent was, but he\u2019s very powerful, seeing that he finished it with a hit without any injuries on his body.The Calsapa Assassin was killed by a blow. Trina stopped the autopsy, and moved her steps to the darker side of the alley while Lloyd and Enya followed her in silence.When they arrived at another location, they saw another group of corpses.\u201cIs this by magic?\u201dEnya asked, looking at the corpses all over the place.It was impossible without magic that nearly 10 people were cut and killed by something at once in these alleys.\u201cI guess so.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s amazing that a wizard can participate in a fight in such a place like this. Then maybe that assassin too?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201dThen Lloyd, who found something, opened his mouth.\u201cLeader, there are more bodies there.\u201dIn the darkness beyond the crowded bodies, there were two more dead bodies.Trina realized that the two bodies were also Calsapa\u2019s Assassins.\u201cThis is the same as the first one. One died from having his heart penetrated and the size of the wound was the same as the first one, so he was killed by the same person. Was it a surprise attack from behind?\u201dSomeone made a surprise attack on an assassin. How the hell? And in the case of the second corpse, the neck was cut by something sharp.\u201cThe first two were killed with the same weapon, but the last one is different. Lloyd, check your feet there.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cThere are marks left near there.\u201dWhat do you mean, marks\u2026.?Lloyd looked carefully at the ground near his feet, half in doubt and as Trina said, there were slight traces of metal scratching the ground.\u201cThis is\u2026.\u201d\u201cThe weapon that killed the first two Assassins must have fallen to the ground. If so, the picture is roughly drawn. The Calsapa Assassins and these corpses we\u2019re trying to kill someone.\u201dHowever, the opponent was not an ordinary person and they were all killed. The last remaining Assassin succeeded in taking the opponent\u2019s weapon, but eventually lost.\u201cThe thing that cut off the neck was a sharp weapon. It specializes in cutting rather than stabbing. It must have been a dagger since the wound wasn\u2019t very wide. If so, it must be the black sword stick used in the first place.\u201d\u201cWhy are you so sure?\u201d\u201cYou might think it\u2019s a rapier, but look closely. The opponent who killed the assassin is a human who specializes in finding other people\u2019s loopholes. If such a human used a stabbing sword, he would have a sword hidden in his staff.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d\u201cAnd this trace. The assassin was trying to engage in a close-quarters battle with the opponent. If the opponent was a swordsman using a rapier, he wouldn\u2019t have tried to do that. He had guessed that it was an opponent that he had to fight at close range but that\u2019s not the case.\u201d\u201cYou have great reasoning skills.\u201dLloyd had no choice but to admire Trina\u2019s reasoning ability to grasp the course of the situation in an instant. Enya didn\u2019t even need to say anything because she was already staring at her boss with immersed eyes.\u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal. I also learned only moderately from someone I know.\u201d\u201cWho did you learn to reason from?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just a quick way to find clues around you rather than reasoning. He told me right away that I have a good sense and that I can learn easily.\u201d\u201cWho the hell is he? And when did you learn\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cA few years ago I met him when I was visiting another county.\u201d\u201cWhat is he doing?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s a private detective.\u201d\u201cWhat? Only a detective?\u201dObviously, a detective is a great person because he\u2019s specialized in finding clues and reasoning. Even so, he could teach Trina, whose senses are far beyond the general population?\u201cHe\u2019s a detective, but he\u2019s quite a freak. That\u2019s how good he is. Sometimes, I was surprised by his nonsensical reasoning.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t believe the captain said that\u2026\u2026.\u201dThey were surprised to hear Trina, who\u2019s always calm and charismatic, say that.\u201cWhatever it may be, this was no ordinary fight given the bodies scattered here. Since they hired the Calsapa\u2019s Assassins, the attackers have risked their lives.\u201d\u201cIs that related to the death of Bellbot Rickson that we are investigating?\u201d\u201cWe don\u2019t know that yet. However, it is certain that there will be quite a stir in the back alley of Leathervelk.\u201dTrina carefully looked around to see if there were any other clues.\u2018Well, the rough finding is that only two people who have made all this happen\u2019One man and one woman.The marks and traces of shoes carved on some bodies are clearly visible.\u2018One side uses a knife and the other is a wizard.\u2019Trina approached the wall of the alleyway and glanced at it with her fingertips. Then she rubbed her fingers and smelled it. A subtle scent was hidden between the stenches of this place. Traces of the smell still linger in the alleyway.\u2018This smells like diffusion.\u2019Diffusion incense was famous for increasing the conductivity of mana, but she knows that it is used when dealing with wizards.\u2018The Assassins moved knowing that their opponent was a wizard but they failed. Didn\u2019t they know he was using a sword?\u2019That means both the man and the woman were wizards. However, one of the two also handled the sword well. The assassins didn\u2019t know that so they died.\u2018A wizard good with swords\u2026\u2026.\u2019Trina\u2019s eyes shone sharply because there was a similar guy in her memory, a man who wore black shadows and stole all kinds of expensive things. The most famous thief she tried to catch again and again when she was not yet a Knight Commander, Arsene Lupin.\u201cThe safe in Bellbot Rickson\u2019s mansion has disappeared. Is that him?\u2019At one point, she thought he had disappeared without a clue, left this job and went into hiding.\u2018The mysterious thief that suddenly reappeared, a werewolf cryptid, suddenly appeared and the secret abandoned factory that was burned.\u2019Trina was sure that all these clues were connected.\u201cThe confirmation is complete.\u201d\u201cAlready?\u201d\u201cYes, I got everything I could get here.\u201d\u201cSo what do we do with the bodies?\u201d\u201cLeave it alone. I\u2019m sure the cleaners in the back alley will take care of the bodies in these places anyway.\u201dTrina knows the rules of this place. No one is surprised or asks about the corpses. Even if dozens of people die, it is not even listed in the newspaper the next day. It is natural for the world to disappear behind the emptiness without being part of the great flow of times.\u201cThen what are you going to do now? Does the investigation end here?\u201dTrina shook her head at Lloyd\u2019s question.\u201cThe investigation continues.\u201d\u201cBut we haven\u2019t had any results yet. If we keep going on like this\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cYeah, so this is actually the last time.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cSo, let\u2019s go to the place where the last clue might be.\u201dTrina turned her head and stared in the direction of the place.\u201cI\u2019m going to Theon Academy.\u201d* * *Early in the morning the birds were chirping.Rudger worked steadily in the teacher\u2019s office even on days when there was no class, but he decided to rest in his private accommodation today.It was because of the accumulated fatigue from having been too busy lately.He had to deal with the <Almighty Stone> incident and after that was over he has to take care of Leathervelk back alley.\u2018But it\u2019s a good thing.\u2019Rudger sighed, lying on a fluffy sofa.He was able to use the excuse that he was giving the test questions because it was the first test period. Thanks to this, he didn\u2019t have to go to the teacher\u2019s office and stayed in his accommodation and rested.\u201cKnock, knock.\u201dA knock on the door woke him up.Who is it? He tried to pretend he wasn\u2019t there, but if he dared to come all the way here, he must have known he wasn\u2019t in the office.Rudger immediately got up from the sofa and opened the front door.\u201cAh! Mr. Rudger!\u201d\u201cMiss Selina.\u201dSo it was Selina who came to visit him.\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d\u201cAh. Because Mr. Rudger didn\u2019t come to the office today.\u201d\u201cYes, I don\u2019t have classes today, and I\u2019ve been troubled by the exam questions.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dSelina stared at Rudger\u2019s figure, blurring the end of her words. This is because she saw Rudger dressed comfortably at home for the first time after seeing him dressed neatly every time.Of course, he was properly dressed with trousers and a shirt, but that alone was new to her.\u2018You\u2019ve loosened your hair too.\u2019The hair that he usually ties looked different because he completely untied it. Maybe he didn\u2019t sleep well, because he has dark circles under his eyes, but even so he has a decadent beauty.Selina sighed in admiration and remembered why she had come here.\u201cMr. Rudger. The reason I\u2019m here is because I have a guest looking for Mr. Rudger.\u201d\u201cA guest?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t you send an employee and Selina herself\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cHehehe. I can stop by on my way anyway, so I decided to come. That\u2019s good for each other, right?\u201d\u201cI see. So what kind of guest came to see me?\u201dSelina replied with a bright, innocent smile.\u201cKnights from the security bureau.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dRudger frowned, but Selina didn\u2019t notice it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 80": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Academy\u2019s Undercover ProfessorCH 80Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayC80: The Approaching Nightcrawlers (2)\u201c\u2026\u2026I\u2019ll be ready in a minute.\u201dI closed the door and returned to my room.I stood still in front of the closet and pondered why this happened. Did they come from the security department? If they were knights, of course it would be the Nightcrawler Knights.\u2018Is it the ones I saw last night?\u2019Why did they come here?They must be busy investigating the incidents that happened in Leathervelk, so why did they come to Theon to find me? Are they sure that I am the culprit?\u2018I\u2019m worried for nothing.\u2019If they knew I was the criminal, they wouldn\u2019t just come to me as guests, they would have issued a warrant and dragged me by force or sneaked up on me in the middle of the night.The fact that they came in such a polite way meant that they didn\u2019t know I was the criminal yet.\u2018Nevertheless, they came to me.\u2019I recalled why right away. The death of Bellbot Rickson in Leathervelk was determined to be caused by a werewolf and that werewolf also appeared in Theon.\u2018I was the one who killed the werewolf.\u2019That\u2019s probably why they came to see the teacher named Rudger Chelici.They are having a setback in their investigation of the case. I guess they know what happened, but the core of the puzzle is gone and the only clue left is in Theon.\u2018However, it is too early to let my guard down. If I show any signs of suspiciousness, they will immediately suspect me.\u2019Especially if the visitor this time is a woman I know, Trina Ryanhowl.Now, in a way, it could have been the biggest crisis of my life because her senses belong to something higher than a human. Even so I cannot refuse to meet them.When a new teacher suddenly refuses to visit the Nightcrawler Knights he will appear suspicious and if I don\u2019t meet them now that will give them an excuse to stick around.\u2018I\u2019ll have to meet them for now.\u2019After all, they know me as Theon\u2019s new teacher, Rudger Chelici. They don\u2019t know about the past me. In this meeting, I just have to lightly respond to the investigation.With that thought, I adjusted my collar and dressed neatly. I put on a black frock coat and tied my flowing hair with a string. Since it is still morning, the air is a little cool, so I put a muffler around my neck.After checking my clothes in the mirror, I put on my shoes and immediately opened the front door. And what I see is the pink cotton ball under my eyes.\u201cAh. Mr. Rudger! Are you ready?\u201dHearing the door open, the cotton ball, no Ms. Selina, looked back.\u201cWere you waiting for me?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dShe averted her gaze and smiled awkwardly.\u201cIf I knew it, I would have come out earlier.\u201d\u201cOh, no! I was the one who waited on my own, and Mr. Rudger didn\u2019t have to rush because of me!\u201d\u201cThank you for your consideration. Then let\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dWell, it\u2019s just two teachers going to school together, I\u2019m sure no one will think anything of it. Anyway, I also wanted to ask Selina about the whole story.I walked in step with her and naturally asked the question.\u201cThe security bureau suddenly came to see me, did you hear the reason?\u201d\u201cOh, yes. I think it\u2019s because of the investigation into the werewolf situation. Recently, a werewolf appeared in our Theon, and I think it\u2019s because Mr. Rudger solved the case.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dHmm. Is it because of that? But even if you ask me, you won\u2019t be able to hear the answer you want. You won\u2019t know that, but you\u2019re struggling to catch a rotten rope.\u201cMore than that, is Mr. Rudger getting ready for the exam? This is my first test.\u201d\u201cYes, I did it somehow.\u201d\u201cWow! That\u2019s amazing. I\u2019m worried about how to do the difficulty level and how to submit the questions so that students can do their best to solve them.\u201d\u201cI agree.\u201dObviously, from the point of view of a teacher, it is quite difficult to create a test question. It shouldn\u2019t be too easy, but not too difficult either.Although there are deviations in each problem, it is important to think deeply about them, rather than make the questions unnecessarily difficult.Questions that required a change of mentality were necessary. Wouldn\u2019t the students be satisfied with a problem that would give them a sense of accomplishment?\u2018However, it\u2019s not as easy as it sounds.\u2019Every man has his own way of accepting things and it was not possible to give everyone proper satisfaction, it was quite a headache for the examiner.Well, the first exam should be made easier anyway.The important thing is to make sure the students have a solid foundation. It would be appropriate to give tests that require advanced courses only after the 3rd examination round. At least I think so.Theon main building was up ahead so it was time to say goodbye to Ms. Selina.\u201cI\u2019ll go and greet the guests now. Keep up the good work.\u201d\u201cYes! Good luck, Mr. Rudger!\u201dAs she was about to leave, waving her hand to me, she called me as if she remembered something.\u201cOh, by the way, Mr. Rudger!\u201d\u201cYeah. Anything else you want to say?\u201dTeacher Selina opened her mouth with a slightly meaningful smile at my question.\u201cThey are quite scary, so be careful.\u201dThen she turned her back and walked away with fast steps.Be careful? I was already fully aware of that. They are scary? Did you meet them in person?\u2018But why would Selina tell me that?\u2019Is it a deliberate warning? Or is she just giving me advice because she thinks I\u2019m nervous?I don\u2019t know why, but that wasn\u2019t the point right now. I lifted my head and turned my gaze to where my office was.I went into the main building and headed towards my office. It was quiet inside and I didn\u2019t meet anyone on the way because it\u2019s the middle of the class.When I arrived at the teacher\u2019s office, I took a deep breath and opened the door.The door opens and what I see is my office and my personal space as it was before I left. The only difference is that someone was looking through the books in the study.I stared at the guest silently.\u201cAh, you\u2019re Rudger Chelici.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t who I thought it was. Instead a man with a stern look, hair neatly pulled back and no-rimmed glasses on his face was standing in front of me.He wore a black uniform and gold epaulet. It\u2019s clear from his attire that he\u2019s a member of the Security Agency.\u2018Wasn\u2019t it Trina Ryanhowl?\u2019Maybe I was wrong that day so I sighed in relief and accepted his greeting.\u201cNice to see you. I\u2019m Theon\u2019s teacher, Rudger Chelici.\u201d\u201cMy name is Lloyd, an agent from the Security Agency.\u201dLloyd, there is no last name, but I can\u2019t conclude that he\u2019s a commoner because the agents of the Security Agency do not properly reveal their identities.He didn\u2019t even say he was a knight, he just said he was an agent. Is he deliberately hiding it, or did he feel that there was no need to brag?I rolled my eyes slightly and looked at his outfit. It is a neat outfit with no wrinkles. His head is also free of clutter and his posture is straight as if a ruler was raised.I guessed it from the outward appearance, but it is clear that he\u2019s a pretty neat seeker.\u2018Is his hand bare, without gloves on?\u2019His stout physique and clunky hands exposed over his uniform clearly proved that he was a knight.\u201cI made you wait a long time.\u201d\u201cNo. Rather, we apologize for not contacting you in advance.\u201d\u201cSit down. Do you like coffee or tea?\u201d\u201cSorry, I don\u2019t eat during office hours.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dI sat facing Lloyd, with the guest table in the middle. He was staring at me with intense eyes, as if he was trying to pierce me. I was worried about the appearance of a lion, but only a wildcat came.\u201cSo why did you come to see me?\u201dI got straight to the point.\u201cI heard that a werewolf appeared in Leathervelk this time.\u201d\u201cYes, but it\u2019s been a while.\u201d\u201cAnd I heard that you were the one who got rid of that werewolf, Mr. Rudger.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right. I took care of it.\u201d\u201cAwesome.\u201d\u201cI was just doing what I was supposed to do as a teacher.\u201dThe questions and answers were light but there was subtle air current flowing through them.\u201cSo.\u201dLloyd, takes the rhyme for a moment and I thought it had come.\u201cDidn\u2019t you notice anything strange about the werewolf?\u201d\u201cSomething strange?\u201dThe Security Agency also noticed that the werewolves were strange but I didn\u2019t show my feelings on the outside. I just responded with a consistent attitude like the beginning.\u201cI don\u2019t know what you think is strange.\u201d\u201cIt was strange that a werewolf also appeared in Theon.\u201d\u201cThe investigation found that the werewolf came from outside through a huge sewer line that connects Theon and Leathervelk.\u201dI didn\u2019t lie. In fact, the werewolf climbed up the big sewer and came into Theon. It was impossible for ordinary people, but it was possible for werewolves.\u201cHmm. That\u2019s right. I heard that Mr. Rudger fought a werewolf head-on.\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s right. It tried to hurt the students, so I stepped up.\u201d\u201cHow did you fight?\u201dIt was a strange question. Maybe it\u2019s probably because he\u2019s nervous that he didn\u2019t receive the answers he wanted but instead of asking why he asked that, I answered the truth as it was.\u201cI used elemental magic. Avoiding his attack as much as possible, I burned his fur with flames and pierced him with a spear of ice.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d\u201cBut maybe because I was too strong, he felt threatened and ran away into the woods. So I chased him and I succeeded in eliminating him in the forest.\u201d\u201cWere there any other problems?\u201d\u201cThere was none, except that some of the energetic students went out to catch the werewolf.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dLloyd didn\u2019t look very surprised. His reaction was natural as if he already knew.I see. You already heard the report, so you knew how it happened, but did you ask me again to check it out? Is there any difference between my testimony and the circumstances he confirmed?Perhaps because he is a member of the Security Bureau, he showed a thoroughness not to miss any details.\u201cThen let me ask you another question.\u201d\u201cYes, please.\u201dLloyd has asked me several questions since then, but I answered naturally without panicking.The question-and-answer session that followed was over five minutes later. Lloyd stood up and shook hands with me.\u201cThank you for taking time out of your busy schedule.\u201dI shook hands with Lloyd.\u201cThen I\u2019ll be on my way. It was an honor to meet you Mr. Rudger Chelici.\u201d\u201cYes, it was an honor for me, too. Mr. Lloyd.\u201dLloyd nodded to me and left my office.The interrogation of the Nightcrawler Knights belonging to the Security Agency ended like this.* * *\u201cWhoo.\u201dLloyd waited for his boss at the meeting place, recalling the conversation he had just had. When the promised time was 10 minutes away, two familiar figures were seen from beyond.\u201cLeader, are you here?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dTrina Ryanhowl, the leader, and Enya, the deputy were also visiting Theon. However, unlike Lloyd, who met Rudger Chelici, the two went to check the scene.\u201cDid you find any clues?\u201d\u201cI got permission to investigate with the president\u2019s help, but I didn\u2019t find anything. What have you got?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t gain anything.\u201d\u201cWas anything about Rudger suspicious?\u201d\u201cFirst of all, to the best of my knowledge, I didn\u2019t feel anything strange.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201dTrina didn\u2019t get the answer she expected, but she wasn\u2019t disappointed.Just in case, she gave Lloyd one order.\u201cLloyd. Did I do what I said?\u201d\u201cYeah. Before we parted ways, I did as you told me.\u201dLloyd nodded solemnly at Trina\u2019s question.\u201cSo how was it?\u201dAs if this was the most important thing, Trina asked with a sharp gaze.\u201cDoes his hand, which you shook, belong to a trained man?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You know what I mean?\u2019Lloyd didn\u2019t even ask why.The night before in the alley Trina explained everything. The one who killed the Calsapa Assassin was a wizard who specializes in close combat so she wanted Lloyd to check Rudger\u2019s hand for traces of training.\u201cDid you shake hands with your bare hand?\u201d\u201cYes, but he was wearing gloves.\u201d\u201cIs that so? But there\u2019s no way you didn\u2019t notice with just one layer of gloves.\u201dLloyd nodded. In the end, all he was aiming for was a handshake at the end. The questions that he asked before were a trick to divert the other person\u2019s attention.\u201cSo how was it?\u201d\u201cYes, I felt it as I shook hands with him\u2026\u2026.\u201dLloyd delivered what he had confirmed as it was.\u201cHe\u2019s an ordinary wizard without any training.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dTrina frowned.* * *Rudger, who was left alone in his office after Lloyd left, sat in front of his work table and clenched his fist.\u201cHandshake, ok.\u201dIn the eyes of a third party, it would be thought that it was just a polite way to end the meeting but from Rudger\u2019s point of view, he had no choice but to think that it was a show of deceit.\u2018Lloyd of the Nightcrawler Knights under the Security Bureau. Age is late 20\u2019s, glasses were worn on his face, and his hair was neatly parted. It must be said that he has an unshakable gaze and a personality that gets things done neatly.\u2019He felt it during the conversation.As if he had prepared all the questions in advance, Lloyd calmly and confidently asked them one by one, like a well-written script.Rudger had the illusion that he was building bricks when asked. The bricks piled up and piled up, surrounded him before he knew it, so he wouldn\u2019t escape. And lastly, Lloyd\u2019s handshake.\u2018Keep asking questions, influencing the other person mentally, and throw a decisive shot the moment he lets his guard down at the end. It\u2019s a very sophisticated way.\u2019If it was a stranger, he would shake hands with him without much thought but Rudger guessed right what he was thinking.\u2018That man named Lloyd must have checked my office before I came.\u2019As Rudger entered through the door, his eyes were on the window sills and shelves, and his fingertips skimmed through the books in the library.He checked the places that are difficult to reach and where dust is easy to accumulate. His behavior was restrained and he even refused the light refreshments he offered.Rudger was convinced that a person like Lloyd would not ask for a handshake without gloves.\u2018He was trying to confirm something by shaking hands.\u2019So what was he trying to confirm? Was he trying to measure the other person\u2019s skills by letting the magic flow through the hand he was holding? That is a very rude act that can be considered an attack on the other side. Even the Nightcrawler Knights cannot do such a thing carelessly.Furthermore Rudger is a teacher of Theon and this identity can\u2019t be treated carelessly even by the Security Bureau.\u2018Then what can be confirmed simply by shaking hands?\u2019That\u2019s right, traces, traces on the palm of his hand.\u2018Last night, the security officers visited the scene where I and Violetta fought. I don\u2019t know how they got there, but it was a close call.\u2019And he must have gotten a clue from the traces of the fight there. The culprit is a wizard, but he also handles weapons well.How is that possible? Even if asked like this, it would be possible for Nightcrawler Knights.There was magic, and there was a corpse stabbed with a sword. As they belong to the Security Agency, they are also elite, so they should have noticed right away.\u2018Was he trying to see if I was the one by shaking hands?\u2019They\u2019re smart people, using a handshake to confirm if a suspect is the culprit. However, since I knew about it I could cope with it.Rudger recalled the conversation he had with Seridan before leaving his hideout.\u201cSeridan.\u201d\u201cHuh? What?\u201d\u201cBefore I go, I have a favor to ask of you.\u201d\u201cWhat is it? What do you need?\u201d\u201cCan you make some kind of gloves for my hands? They must be similar to human skin, but from a very soft material.\u2019\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIs it possible?\u201d\u2018Sure! However, it is difficult right now to be completely identical. I have to work on the material and that takes time.\u2019\u2018That\u2019s fine. I can do the rest with my magic.\u2019\u201cOkay. There are ingredients left from making the infinitesimal sphere that Nari used, so it will work somehow. Oh, but what happened to the infinitesimal sphere?\u201d\u201cI tore it up and threw it away.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dRudger added a portion of the artificial skin he received from Seridan to the palm of the inside of the glove. That\u2019s right, the skin Lloyd\u2019s felt in the glove as they shook hands, was not Rudger\u2019s real skin.\u2018Even if you\u2019re a security officer, you won\u2019t notice it.\u2019Seridan\u2019s skills are the real deal and the artificial skin she created is comparable to real skin. The face mask made of artificial skin can easily pass even thorough inspections in the border area.\u2018Officers of the Security Bureau have good brains, but that\u2019s it.\u2019Rudger rolled up the corners of his mouth and began reviewing the test questions for the first test.* * *\u201cSenior, is that true? Are you not mistaken?\u201d\u201cYou think I don\u2019t even know that?\u201d\u201cNo, but\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cStop it. There\u2019s no way Lloyd didn\u2019t notice.\u201d\u201cBut, sir\u2026\u2026.\u201dTrina was quite disturbed since Rudger was their only clue but nothing suspicious about him was found.\u201cThen is the case back in the labyrinth?\u201dIn other words, the real culprit was hiding somewhere in Leathervelk but she couldn\u2019t figure out who it was because the city is huge and she doesn\u2019t know many people.\u2018Arsene Lupin, I thought I found his traces.\u2019Is she going to not catch him again?Trina Ryanhowl clenched her fist.During the time when she was called the Patriotic Frontier and made her name as an elite of the Knights she was always on a roll without knowing her failure, but she experienced defeat for the first time.She was born as an aristocrat, had natural talents and with appropriate efforts, she never experienced failure until she met him. A man who steals what can\u2019t be stolen and plays a lot of tricks, Arsene Lupin.She wanted to find him right away if she could, but\u2026\u2018I can\u2019t spend my time on an investigation that doesn\u2019t make any progress.\u2019Her role ended at the point where she couldn\u2019t find any clues.She is the leader of the Nightcrawler Knights belonging to the Intelligence Agency and because of her position it was difficult for her to move around.\u201cLloyd, Enya.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m leaving for the capital again.\u201d\u201cThen the investigation into this case\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cWithout a proper clue, we can\u2019t go any further. I\u2019ll report to the top that the investigation is temporarily suspended.\u201d\u201cThen is it over?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t stay here forever, because I\u2019m busy. So, you stay here.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cStay here in Leathervelk, and if anything suspicious happens, don\u2019t hesitate to report it to me. Do you understand?\u201d\u201cYes, but what about senior?\u201d\u201cNo. Lloyd has something else to do. Lloyd, do you agree?\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s your order.\u201d\u201cUh, uh, but if you say this all of a sudden\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cEnya. Please.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dEnya nodded with a determined face when she realized that this was an order from Trina Ryanhowl\u2019s the \u201cindividual,\u201d not from the Security Agency.\u201cYes, sir!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll do well.\u201dTrina answered and was about to leave but at that moment, Lloyd exclaimed.\u201cAll right, boss! Are you going to keep going? Will you meet Mr. Rudger in person\u2026\u2026.?\u201d\u201cNo. I can\u2019t do that.\u201d\u201cWhat? Why\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cThe reason I came here in the first place was because of \u2018that kind of condition\u2019.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t believe it.\u201dIt was incomprehensible to Lloyd. Is it that hard to meet someone?Trina tried to explain the whole situation to her confused lieutenant, but felt someone approaching her and turned her head.\u201cJust in time.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dLloyd and Enya also starred in the direction that Trina was looking at. There was a woman approaching slowly towards them.\u2018Since when?\u2019Although she was close enough to be easily seen with the naked eye, she did not feel anyone approaching.A beautiful woman with white and pale pink two-tone long hair waving in the morning sunlight was approaching them. She smiled brightly and waved her hand.\u201cYay! Trina! Long time no see!\u201d\u201cElisa, we met earlier this morning, what do you mean a long time?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s how I feel.\u201dSeeing her talking to Trina in a friendly manner, Enya and Lloyd were embarrassed inside.\u2018Elisa? Elisa Willow?\u2019\u2018She\u2019s the president of Theon Academy, isn\u2019t she?\u2019A genius wizard who achieved the 6th rank, Lexorer, at a young age.\u201cElisa, what are you doing here?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re leaving soon, so I came to see my friend off.\u201d\u201cHuh. It\u2019s unnecessary consideration.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what friends are for.\u201d\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, then there\u2019s no reason why you couldn\u2019t arrange for that bastard named Rudger Chelici to meet me right?\u201d\u201cNo, that\u2019s different.\u201dElisa shook her head.\u201cDon\u2019t bother our talented newbie too much.\u201dLooking at Elisa talking to her with a mysterious smile, Trina swallowed her irritation inside.The reason she couldn\u2019t meet Rudger Chelici in person was because none other than Elisa Willow interfered.\u201cYou must like him quite a bit.\u201d\u201cBecause he is a rare and talented person, but what would he do if he met Trina in person?\u201d\u201cYou look at me like I\u2019m someone who destroys people.\u201d\u201cWrong.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dTrina stared at Elisha and then turned her head.\u201cWe\u2019re leaving Enya, Lloyd.\u201d\u201cOh, yes!\u201d\u201cYes, sir!\u201d\u201cTrina, you\u2019re going to go like this?\u201d\u201cI will go. So there is no need to see off.\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you going to see the princess?\u201d\u201cShe is also the blood of the imperial family. I don\u2019t have to check if she\u2019s doing well. You\u2019ll do well on your own.\u201dAs if she didn\u2019t want to talk anymore, Trina stopped coldly but Elisa was not dissatisfied or regretful with Trina\u2019s attitude. It seems to be natural between the two so she just accepted it.\u201cI\u2019m leaving.\u201dMaybe because of the old days Trina added the last words.* * *\u2018The president knows her?\u2019I shook my head as I watched secretly from the window. Even watching from afar, it is clear that the atmosphere between the two is not very friendly but not completely hostile either. Still, they don\u2019t look that close to each other.\u2018Is this an ambiguous relationship?\u2019Two people, who were originally friends, meet each other as leaders and keep each other in check.Maybe it\u2019s because there was some kind of incident between the two of them in the past.\u2018I don\u2019t know exactly what happened.\u2019I\u2019m glad that I don\u2019t have to face Trina Ryanhowl in person.\u2018It\u2019s all thanks to the president\u2019s protection.\u2019If she hadn\u2019t stopped Trina Ryanhowl she would\u2019ve been the one who came to see me, not Lloyd. I\u2019m truly fortunate and one thing I\u2019m sure about this situation.\u2018The president decided to trust me.\u2019After the Werewolf affair, Aidan and Jevan Pellio\u2019s duel and even the Almighty stone incident that followed I thought that the president acted when the Knights of the Security Agency came to visit meThe president promised to take care of me. In other words, I have taken a big step toward becoming a trusted teacher of Theon.\u2018However, this is different from unconditional trust. Now, she thinks I\u2019m a good guy, so she\u2019s protecting me.\u2019If there were any signs of doubt, the president might come forward and try to kill me. So I have to be as careful as possible to avoid that.\u2018Now, all that remains is to find the First Order of the Black Dawn.\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 82": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Academy\u2019s Undercover ProfessorCH 82Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayC82: The First Test (1)The day of the first test was near. Rudger finished reviewing the final exam questions in his office. Across from him, his assistant, Sedina, was sitting and diligently organizing all the papers.\u201cSedina.\u201d\u201cYes! Fir, no, Mr. Rudger!\u201d\u201cDid anything happen recently?\u201dRudger asked Sedina, keeping his eye on the test questions. Seeing his concentrating look, Sedina looked at the scene in a blank slate without realizing it, and then she came to her senses and answered.\u201cWell, there really wasn\u2019t anything.\u201d\u201cWell, what are the others in the organization doing?\u201d\u201cEveryone is taking care of themselves. All of them are cautious in their actions, probably because the Security Bureau recently visited Theon.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dRudger shook his head. He was quite relieved that the Black Dawn Society was not active at the moment and remained still.He doesn\u2019t know if they\u2019ll do anything during the first test. That would have been quite embarrassing.\u2018She\u2019s helpful at times like this.\u2019Trina Ryanhowl was a troublesome opponent in many ways when he met the enemy, but now it is different. Thanks to her visit to Theon to investigate the Leathervelk case, the members of the Black Dawn Society had to resign themselves.Being the shield that protects the Empire and the tycoon of the Security Bureau, she is considered the most dangerous existence for the Black Dawn. Considering her achievements so far, it is natural for them to lay low.How many secret organizations have been smashed by Trina\u2019s hands, and how many criminals have died in her hands? If Trina felt anything suspicious and started an investigation, there was a high possibility that the power of the Black Dawn Society would be greatly reduced.\u201cOf course, since this is an unprecedented secret organization, there are many powerful members hidden.\u201dIf the two fought, no matter which side lost, Rudger would not be disappointed.\u201cPerhaps that\u2019s why the members of the organization are careful and meet each other outside of Theon.\u201d\u201cIs there a meeting?\u201d\u201cYeah, that\u2019s what I think.\u201d\u201cSedina, didn\u2019t you go to such a meeting?\u201d\u201cYes? Yes. I just\u2026\u2026.\u201dSeeing Sedina getting pale, Rudger wanted to ask something. In the first place, she is also a member of the Black Dawn, so she should have been invited.Still, Sedina would have been visibly depressed in the past, but this time, she didn\u2019t think much of it. There was no one around her back then, but now there is Rudger.Just as the two of them were about to end their conversation, Sedina opened her mouth as if she remembered something.\u201cCome to think of it, there was one unusual thing.\u201d\u201cThere was?\u201d\u201cYeah. Actually, it\u2019s kind of weird to report to Mr. Rudger, but\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cExplain. I\u2019ll judge after hearing it myself.\u201d\u201cOh, yes. Three days ago, three members of the organization were caught by police. They\u2019re all only Third Orders though.\u201dCaught by the police? That was a little strange.\u201cWell, even if they were Third Orders, they wouldn\u2019t have been so stupid as to be caught by the police.\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cSomeone else got involved in the case. Who is it?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s said to be a student of Theon.\u201d\u201cStudent?\u201dRudger took his eyes off the questions and stared at Sedina.Embarrassed to receive that gaze from him, Sedina shrugged her shoulders even more and nodded her head.\u201cYes. There are three students in total, two boys and one girl. I don\u2019t know if you know, but they\u2019re also students in your class.\u201d\u201cStudents in my class?\u201dTwo men and one woman. Rudger could immediately recall the unusual combination.\u201cAidan, Leo and Tracy Friad?\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s right. I can\u2019t believe you remembered right away. As expected, First\u2026Teacher.\u201d\u201cHow did those kids caught the Third Orders in town\u2026\u2026Right. It was because of that.\u201dRudger remembered the existence of the \u2018Bulletin Board\u2019 in Theon. The exact name is <Application Board>. It is a legitimate means of making money that Theon students can use.\u201cDid the students carrying out the quest find any traces?\u201d\u201cYeah. I guess so.\u201dOf course, this quest is similar to what the mercenaries do.Some difficult quests will be formally requested through the mercenary request office, but there are also miscellaneous quests that mercenaries do not take.Theon tuition is expensive and although there is a scholarship system, it covers the pure educational expenses, but does not cover the cost of living expenses or other materials necessary for research and experiments.It is said that if you enter a club, research costs will be paid steadily, but establishing a club is not easy.\u2018After all, for students who are short of money, this is the only way to make quick money.\u2019Other than that, working part-time in Theon was also possible. Still, they are high-quality workers who can use magic, so wouldn\u2019t that hurt their pride? And so the \u2018Bulletin Board\u2019 appeared.\u2018It\u2019s mostly used by low-income students who lack money.\u2019A noble family, or a wealthy merchant family, is never short of money in the first place. The rich students always get plenty of support, and they can get most of what they want.Naturally, the main students who used this request board were the commoners or those who lacked money.Very often, there are nobles who apply for entertainment. This <Application Board> is said to be available to anyone, but of course there are conditions.There is also a difficulty or risk in the request, so the grade is important to receive the request. The higher the grade, the more difficult the request can be, but the lower grades could only take the easy requests.Of course, even if the student grade is low, a temporary would be issued by Theon if they pass a test.\u201cEven so, they\u2019re still in their first year.\u2019No matter how special Aidan magic is, he cannot receive high-level quests. Nevertheless, while carrying out his given mission, he made a contribution to catching as many as three Third Orders for the Black Dawn Society.\u2018Is it a coincidence or destiny led him?\u2019Rudger paid attention to Aidan since the werewolf incident. He felt that there was something about him that attracted the incident.Rudger thought of a board in his head, a large chess board made of black and white tiles. He checked his pieces one by one.\u2018The pieces I can use.\u2019The members of the <U.N. Owen> organization were elites who were united and had extraordinary abilities. Their roles are rook, knight and bishop.\u2018Aidan and his friends, on the other hand, are actually pawns.\u2019He was still an idealistic kid but the presence of pawns in chess was sometimes more threatening than anyone else. The pawn that survived could become a bishop or a knight.\u2018It could be a queen.\u2019Pawns are nothing but junk, but they have infinite potential to become anything. Rudger rated Aidan quite highly. He possessed talents, but in particular, his mental strength and tenacity were way above other students.Reality is different from chess, so even if he survived for a long time, he could not be promoted unconditionally but Aidan might go beyond queen and become a king.\u201cMr. Rudger?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201dRudger returned to reality at Sedina\u2019s voice.\u201cI asked about the treatment of those students.\u201d\u201cTreatment?\u201d\u201cYes. No matter how coincidental it was, they have been instrumental in the capture of our members of the Black Dawn. Besides, that student named Aidan also uses bizarre magic to nullify magic.\u201dSedina made a suggestion to cut out the sprouts of the student named Aidan in advance since he\u2019s dangerous.Rudger shook his head.\u201cAll right, let it go.\u201d\u201cAre you going to leave it as is?\u201d\u201cYes, it does not pose a threat to us right now. Moreover, if we mess with Theon students, we risk revealing our existence.\u201dBut more importantly,Those who were beaten by students and arrested are useless to our organization. It\u2019s a good thing.\u201d\u201cI see!\u201dSedina admired Rudger\u2019s words.Perhaps because he was a First Order, he had a different perspective on the incident. He may seem like a terrible cold-blooded man, but Sedina, who was by Rudger\u2019s side for a while, understood an executive\u2019s point of view.\u201cAnything else, Sedina?\u201d\u201cYes, the members are just saying to take care of ourselves until the test is over.\u201d\u201cIs that so? I see.\u201dRudger said and rose from his seat. Sedina stood up as if she had been waiting and picked up a bunch of test papers.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dIt was time for the first test.* * *There was tension in the 80 person lecture hall. It was natural to be nervous now that the first test was approaching, but this time the situation was a little different.Opening the long-awaited relay for the next three days is the test of Rudger Chelici. Even as it is an open book test, it was no exaggeration to say that the final boss came out from the beginning for students.\u201cArgh! I studied, but I have no idea!\u201d\u201cWouldn\u2019t you get the answer if you read the books?\u201d\u201cHow hard are you trying to make an open book test\u2026\u2026.\u201dAll the students who were seated had no choice but to tremble as they watched the flowing second hand. Some shook their legs and some bit their nails.The moment when the endlessly rotating clock hand points to the right time the sound of the door opening thundered through the quiet classroom.\u00a0 At least the students waiting for the exam had no choice but to feel that way.It was Rudger who opened the door and came in. Unlike usual coats, this time he wore a simple style with a gray vest and suit pants on top of a white dress shirt but his sharp gaze was still there, and his mood never softened.\u201cAs everyone knows, today is the first test.\u201dA small sized assistant who was standing next to Rudger whined and placed the test paper on the platform.\u201cThe total duration of the exam is 3 hours. As previously announced, it is an open book test. We\u2019ll start in five minutes, so if you haven\u2019t been to the bathroom yet, go now because once the test starts, no one can leave until the answer sheet is submitted.\u201dIt was to prepare for any possible negation. In fact, there are many cases like this every year.\u201cIf you study hard, you can do well on the test. There\u2019s also a partial score, so you don\u2019t have to give out a blank paper because it\u2019s difficult.\u201dAnd the important warning was this.\u201cI\u2019ll warn you of one thing. If you\u2019re caught cheating on my test\u2026\u201dRudger\u2019s voice, which was usually cold, fell even heavier.\u201cThen I promise you I\u2019ll make sure you pay the price.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe whole classroom was frozen by Rudger\u2019s warning.The students didn\u2019t even dream of cheating since they were afraid of Rudger but hearing the warning it became clear.Don\u2019t ever cheat.\u201cOf course, I will be the supervisor of this test.\u201dIf he was the supervisor, they would never dream of cheating even if they were confident in their magic skills. Some students had no choice but to close their eyes when even that last hope was trampled.The wind blew on the platform as soon as Rudger finished speaking.Under Rudger\u2019s spell, the test papers were scattered in all directions and came down slowly one by one in front of the students.\u201cWow.\u201dPassing test papers to 80 students with wind magic made them realize how ridiculous and great that Rudger is.\u201cIt seems that no students want to go to the bathroom. Looks like everything it\u2019s ready.\u201dRudger took a golden watch out of his pocket.\u201cThe test is starting now.\u201dThis was the first wall Theon students had to face.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 83": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Academy\u2019s Undercover ProfessorCH 83Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayC83: The First Test (2)I checked the Ko-fi page and I saw that it was taken down so I made another one, the link it\u2019s now working.I also worked on the comments issue(maybe you didn\u2019t notice but the comments didn\u2019t appear even though they were approved). Leave some comments to this chapter so I can check if everything works.Only the sound of magic pens across the paper echoed softly in the quiet classroom. It seemed like the sound of insects gnawing at something, but in a way, it was not a wrong expression. Because the students\u2019 mental strength was being gnawed by a bug called the pressure of the test in real time.\u201cUgh, it\u2019s hard. What is this?\u201d\u201cI saw it in the book, but why can\u2019t I solve it? Is this a real problem?\u201d\u201cHow could I be so stupid?\u201dHe didn\u2019t say those words out loud, but he can see the students\u2019 thoughts.\u2018It will be very painful.\u2019Rudger stood upright on the platform and stared at the students.As previously warned, the test is held in an open book test. It means that it doesn\u2019t matter if you look up the contents related to the problem in the textbook. But if you look at the textbook and know the answer right away, can it be called a test?\u2019It\u2019s not just about asking for one-dimensional knowledge. I twisted the questions over and over again, so you won\u2019t be able to see through the hidden trap.\u2019He added a trap in the middle of the problems. It\u2019s in all the test questions, so students will be troubled. There are only 20 questions, but that is the reason why the exam time was 3 hours.\u2018Oh my gosh. Even though I studied hard, it\u2019s difficult!\u2019Rene also felt steam coming out of her head. Her eyes are spinning, and the letters on the test paper seem to be dancing. It was very difficult, although she never missed a review.She was confident that the first test would check the basics, and from the moment she faced the first problem, her hair felt white.[Question 1][The magic liquid serves to store mana inside in the process of absorbing mana from the atmosphere. After 10 years of exposure to nature, the magic liquid can be converted into a magic stone that supplies mana that wizards can use. In order to induce crystallization with magic stones by refining this magic liquid in its pure form\u2026\u2026.]First of all, the relationship between magical liquid and magic stones is basic knowledge that is learned in the magic release class.The magic liquid that has matured for more than 10 years crystallizes and turns into mana stones and then it\u2019s processed in order to make artifacts or magic tools used by wizards. The wands that wizards use are made by mixing special wood with mana stones.\u2018I expected this to be on the test. Mr. Rudger said over and over again that it\u2019s going to be in the test.\u2019So she studied carefully and in order to not forget anything.\u201cBut it\u2019s still too hard!\u2019Rene kept on reading the question while screaming inside.[\u2026\u2026\u2026.Hereinafter, the magic solution was added to an aqueous contra solution and melted to form A, and B, which was aggregated by adding calidium metal. When you try to grind these A and B substances in the same laboratory under the same conditions, describe the formula for which of the two can be made first.](However, the temperature of the laboratory remains constant at 30 degrees, and the pressure is 0.982 atmospheric pressure.) The crystallization reaction of B applies the standard rate of change.)\u201cThis is only question number one?\u201dWhat\u2019s even more surprising is that this question #1 had the lowest score!She wondered if she was the only one who thought so, and the other students around her were also grunting.They were prepared, but the questions were more difficult than they expected, so the pressure felt by the students must be considerable.\u201cGet a hold of yourself!\u201dRene thought she was fine so far, and she glanced over the problems.Yes, it\u2019s all difficult, but if she read them carefully, she could see that the questions were only from what she actually learned.Rudger did not lie, the questions were from what he taught in class.She could be sure because she listened to his class more enthusiastically than anyone else.\u2018Maybe it\u2019s because you\u2019re a sophomore, but you\u2019re solving it right away.\u201dPrincess Erendir, who sits next to her, is already in the middle of solving the problems. She is a model student and Rene felt motivated seeing her.\u2018I can do it!\u2019Her eyes sparkled.* * *\u2018Hmm. It\u2019s a pretty complicated formula.\u2019Flora Lumos solved the test questions with a blank face. Her hand, holding the pen, did not rest for a while. Rather, it was almost twice as fast as other students who work hard.She also vaguely felt it. Rudger said they were given three hours of time, but that was cutting it close.\u2018If I write continuously without resting as much as possible, it will only take about 2 hours and 45 minutes.\u2019The questions were also tailored to the level of freshman, because Rudger understands the average abilities of students. Moreover, it is not just difficult to solve the problems.\u2018Hmm. This matter follows the Empire\u2019s basic standards, but it\u2019s actually a trap. The Ruplamosk Experimental Formula came from the Durman Kingdom, not the Exilion Empire, so of course I have to follow that standard. The standard itself is a kind of deception. He taught very little in class and if students neglect to take notes, they are bound to be wrong.\u2019Flora grasped the intention of the examiner at once and wrote down the correct answers. While looking calm on the surface she continued to explore the problem inside and was admiring the way the examiner made it.\u2018You\u2019re going to change the magic formula like this? Example 1 and Example 2 are superficially similar, but the direction of the flow is fundamentally different. Students who don\u2019t know will think it\u2019s the same.\u2019That\u2019s a good question.Flora thought she could solve everything in an hour at this rate.Realizing something, she suddenly stopped her pen.\u2018Am I really enjoying this test right now?\u2019It was unbelievable. For her, tests were nothing more than a boring event.Writing down and explaining all the facts that she already knew in a way that is not difficult. What could be less interesting than that?It is possible to fall into contemplation in a class where teachers with insufficient ability talk freely, but in a test, it is annoying to move your hands directly. Nevertheless, she did not miss the top spot.She is not only gifted with the ability to feel magic, but also has an excellent brain that understands magic. Therefore, it was true her life in Theon did not have any particular stimulation.She finished most of the tests in less than 30 minutes but for the first time she was interested in test questions and found them interesting.\u2018It can\u2019t be.\u2019I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m having fun on the test!What a disgrace!Flora shook her hand without a pen and clenched her fists.\u2018I can\u2019t help but solve the problem to build up my self-esteem.\u2019Flora imagined Rudger\u2019s reaction when she submitted a blank paper.[Hmm. Is that a blank sheet? I see, after all, this was your limit.]Yeah. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll say this.He won\u2019t get angry or annoyed, he will just bluntly point out her shortcomings. He wouldn\u2019t even ask why or what happened.Other teachers would make a fuss![No! I\u2019ve never seen anything like that!]So what should I do? There is only one way. The best way to surprise him is to do the best in this test.First place? No, the important thing is to aim for a perfect score.Yeah, this is a fight for pride. A fight between students and teachers, a fierce battle that has been going on between her and Rudger with her record being two wins and two loses.How can I forget those painful days of defeat?\u2018Not this time! I\u2019ll show you that I won by getting a perfect score!\u2019Rudger himself didn\u2019t think much of it, but Flora had already decided on her own.Flora showed strong motivation and began to focus on the problems. She defended herself that she was just trying hard to beat Rudger. She was not aware that the more she solved the problems, the more she was immersed in them.* * *\u2018It\u2019s quiet.\u2019At first, the sound of suffering that was heard here and there disappeared after about 30 minutes. Rudger, who was standing on the platform and monitoring possible cheating, thought this was enough, and gave Sedina a signal.\u201cYes!\u201dShe answered in a very small, yet strong voice.Without a word, Rudger pointed his finger at two chairs in the corner. Sedina nodded and brought the two chairs to the platform.\u2018What are you going to do?\u2019\u2018Let go.\u2019\u2018Yes! And?\u2019\u2018Sit down.\u2019\u2018Yes? yes.\u2019Sedina put a chair aside and sat down, Rudger also put a chair nearby and sat comfortably.\u2018Take a rest.\u2019\u2018Yes?\u2019\u2018There are still two and a half hours left before the exam is over. As it is the first test, I, a teacher, and you, an assistant, cannot be left out, but your legs hurt if you continue to stand for the rest of the time. So sit back and relax.\u2019\u2018Sir\u2026\u2026!\u2019Sedina looked up at Rudger with her impressed look. Rudger, who is now familiar with the gaze, suddenly realized that another gaze was on him and turned his head.Among the students taking the exam, a girl with pure white hair was staring at him with a strong gaze.\u2018Julia Plumhart.\u2019As soon as she met Rudger\u2019s gaze, she immediately focused on solving the exam questions, but Rudger was only bothered for a moment by the disrespectful gaze she had sent. Also her target was Sedina not him.\u2018Well, that\u2019s it. There is no need to point it out.\u2019Rudger sat in a chair with his arms folded and his legs crossed.The remaining time is 2 hours and 30 minutes. It\u2019s quite long from a waiting standpoint, but it will feel very tight from a student\u2019s point of view, because that\u2019s how he coordinated it.\u2018Even if it\u2019s only the basics I deliberately twisted the questions so it\u2019s going to take a while.\u2019If they can\u2019t solve all the problems, they need to focus on what they\u2019re good at. These students were not fools, so they were focusing on questions they could definitely answer.Even the least accomplished students will be able to specialize in some aspects as long as they enter Theon. As a result, the students were now in a trance and into solving problems.For a teacher, it was a very desirable appearance. Flora Lumos was also staring at the test questions.\u2018There are a lot of good students.\u2019Rene and the princess sitting next to her were working hard. Aidan and his friends sitting behind him also looked troubled, but they didn\u2019t seem to have given up.\u2018The beast girl over there is good too.\u2019Is she Iona Obeli?She had brown skin and much darker black hair and was working hard at the problems in an unflappable manner. He thought it would be difficult for her because she is a beastman, but she was surprisingly quick to adapt.\u2018Is it the beast people magic?\u2019The beast people also have their own culture, history and traditions. Instead of using magic the beast people used the power of Mother Nature called \u2018Spirit\u2019.Spirit is similar to the spirits of nature, but it is distinctly different. If the spirit is shaped in any form by the rich vitality of nature, Spirit is a big concept that encompasses not only nature but also ancestors and animals.\u2018In the magical summoning series, the specialization called <Negative> belongs to that.\u2019Originally, there was no <Negative> specialization in the summoning series, but it was added as humans in the past suppressed the beast people and absorbed their culture. Of course, the beast people were angry that humans had bound their long traditions to a category of magic.\u2018Because of the repulsion at that time, the beast people reject magic, so it must be the same now.\u2019But a beast girl came to learn magic at Theon, a general organization that teaches magic.\u2018Her last name was Obeli? I know that the surname of the beast people is influenced by their bloodline.\u2019Although her last name is Obeli, that is so it can be called comfortably in human society. In fact, her last name was O-Belly, which had to be said with a slightly increased accent. It means Belly\u2019s blood, and for humans, it was like a noble family.\u2018Belly, I think I\u2019ve heard of it somewhere.\u2019I don\u2019t know much about the beast people, so it was a little vague. I have no choice but to look it up later.Thinking so, two hours passed before I knew it.\u201cYou have 30 minutes to finish the exam. I won\u2019t accept submissions if you\u2019re even a minute late, so keep that in mind.\u201dThe students\u2019 pen speed became urgent at his words.\u2018The next test will be fun since it\u2019s a little different.\u2019Rudger took a strange pleasure from seeing the students in pain.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If you get caught doing something ridiculous here, I\u2019ll treat it as cheating and give you zero points.\u201dRudger\u2019s warning was effective as the students stopped moving their pens.\u201cAssistant Sedina.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dWhen Rudger called her name, Sedina rose from her seat and hurriedly collected the students\u2019 test papers one by one. When the test paper completely left their hands, the students sighed as they realized that the test was over.\u201cI should have studied a little harder.\u201d\u201cAh! I knew this! The formula is correct, but I made a mistake and the answer is wrong!\u201d\u201cHey, is this the right way to do it? What did you write?\u201d\u201cUgh, it\u2019s frustrating. I made a mistake!\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t tell even if I look in the book.\u201dThe students gathered among themselves and discussed briefly what the answers were, but that did not change the answers they had already written.After retrieving all 80 sheets of test paper, Sedina arranged them neatly and brought them to Rudger.\u201cGreat job.\u201dRudger picked up the test papers.\u201cEveryone had a hard time taking the first exam. There are still two more days left for the first test, so don\u2019t overdo it and try to adjust your condition to the best.\u201dOf course, even if he said this, the students who crammed will do the same. Still, as a teacher, he just advised his students.After saying these words, Rudger left the classroom.\u201cWhoa.\u201dThis was their first examination in Theon and although it just ended, Rene felt relieved as if she had crossed the biggest wall.\u2018No, we still have a lot of tests left, right? Let\u2019s not be lax already.\u2019Still, I can think this positively because I did pretty well on the test.Thanks to her constant review none of the 20 questions were submitted blank.When I first saw the test questions, I wondered what was so difficult, but when I looked carefully, I realized that it was not necessarily the case.As she felt the flow and solved the problems in a trance, 3 hours had passed.\u2018It\u2019s a relief that there was enough time to solve everything.\u2019Rene looked around with a little relief. She was going to ask Erendir if she did well.\u2018But since she\u2019s a princess and a senior, she must have done better than me.\u2019Unlike her, who was puzzled at first, Erendir immediately began solving the problems.Rene, who was going to ask Erendir had no choice but to postpone the action for a while.\u201cSenior?\u201d\u201cHuh? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cOh, no. The\u2026\u2026You looked a little bit embarrassed.\u201d\u201cOh, yeah? Is that so?It was as Rene said. Erendir was restless after submitting the test paper and her confidence was gone. Her legs were shaking and she was stuttering like a person who failed the exam.\u2018Oh no. There\u2019s no way, right?\u2019Rene ignored her negative thoughts and asked Erendir.\u201cSenior, did you do well on the exam? As Mr. Rudger said, everything was from what he taught in class!\u201d\u201cUh\u2026 Really?\u201dWhat do you mean, really? As soon as she heard Erendir ask back, Rene felt the corners of her mouth twitching unconsciously.Her anxious thoughts were gradually coming to reality.\u201cSenior. That\u2026I don\u2019t know if I can ask you this question.\u201d\u201cHuh? Yeah, it doesn\u2019t matter. Ask me anything you\u2019re curious about.\u201d\u201cTest\u2026Have you ruined it?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dErendir, who answered confidently, closed his lips tightly.\u201c\u2026\u2026Senior?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dShe was even turning her head to avoid her gaze and her ears were flushed red in the midst of her colorful blond hair. Erendir was ashamed.\u201cSenior, don\u2019t tell me\u2026.\u201dEven her own imagination seemed to insult her, but she couldn\u2019t help but ask.\u201cDid you really screw up on the test?\u201dFlinch!When asked by Line, Erendir shook her shoulders.From that gesture Rene realized that Erendir, the 3rd Princess of the Empire, who was called everyone\u2019s idol, ruined this exam.\u201c\u2026Really? No, is it because you\u2019re not feeling well today? Recently, you had too many things to think about. A review of the future of the country? Because of that, right?\u201dErendir focused on the test more than anyone else but Rene was so confused that she had to believe it.At least, she thinks the princess is a great person who can easily occupy the top ranks in any field.\u201cHmm. Junior Rene.\u201dErendir, who regained her composure to some extent, opened her mouth.\u201cPeople are saying that everyone has their own field. If there is something you are good at, there is something you are bad at. So what this means is that no one is good at anything. Do you understand?\u201d\u201cUh\u2026\u2026I mean, you\u2019re not in a bad condition, you\u2019re not particularly tired today\u2026\u2026You just failed the test?\u201d\u201cJunior Rene I didn\u2019t pass the exam because I wasn\u2019t good enough.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Just in case, what was your ranking last year?\u201dAs Rene remembers, Theon has more than 800 students per grade. Of course, the higher the grade, the more students drop out, so the number of senior students decreases considerably but every year, a corresponding number of new students comes in.Erendir is a sophomore this year so it would be no surprise if her grades were based on the 800 students when she was in the first grade.\u201c\u2026\u2026Why are you asking that? Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re judging people by their rankings, too, are you?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not in the top 500, are you?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dThe moment she saw that Erendir\u2019s eyes widened as she turned around, Rene was startled. Erendir, who looked like a model, is actually really bad at studying theory!It was a great shock.Even the other nobles were overwhelmed by her atmosphere and could not approach her recklessly, so the princess was always alone.She looks like a typical model student but she is actually in the middle and lower ranks in theory class!\u201cIn the practical classes, my ranking is high!\u201dErendir exclaims desperately.It wasn\u2019t a lie. In the theory classes she was ranked 500 out of 800 students, but she was in the top 30 when it came to practical skills.Because she was born into a good family and has a strong bloodline, her magical powers are far greater than that of other students. Her rank in the practical exam was only possible because she received a thorough early education before she came to Theon.When she saw that Erendir looked like she might burst into tears, Rene hurriedly nodded and responded.\u201cOh, well, that\u2019s possible! Besides, these days, there\u2019s a strong trend of putting more emphasis on practice than theory, right?\u201d\u201cRight? I admit that I\u2019m not good at theory and knowledge, but I\u2019m also proud of my skills as a wizard.\u201dRene responded to Erendir\u2019s words while sweating but inside she was a little disappointed.\u2018As expected, you shouldn\u2019t judge people by their appearance.\u2019She felt that the noble image of the 3rd princess she knew was ruined.* * *In her office on the top floor of Theon main building, the president, Elisa, looked down through the window.\u201cThe first test has finally begun.\u201dWilford, who brought the refreshments, nodded at Elisa\u2019s words.\u201cI hope all the students get good results.\u201d\u201cIf they\u2019ve tried, they\u2019ll definitely get them.\u201d\u201cI guess so\u201dA total of four tests are held in one semester and a year is divided into two semesters, so students have to take as many as eight tests a year.Not only students but also teachers who made the tests were tired. Above all else, because their job is to raise elites called wizards, the tests were quite intense and radical. That\u2019s why there were a lot of dropouts in Theon as each grade level went up.In the first test of the first semester students who were proud of themselves as geniuses competed with students who were in a similar situation for the first time and realized how narrow the well they were living in was.In the case of students whose hearts were broken, it was not uncommon for them to leave Theon after the first test was over.\u201cI hope many students can hold out this time.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why you asked them to take the first test lightly.\u201d\u201cI did. Of course, the kids who will fall will fall away.\u201dElisha felt sorry for that.She didn\u2019t view the competition itself as bad. However, it was her honest opinion that she wanted to avoid the fact that some students were ruined due to excessive competition.As Theon\u2019s president, she wanted to make sure a large number of students get a great education and spread their talents.\u201cHow about the new teachers? They must have given exam questions while working as a teacher for the first time. Weren\u2019t they nervous?\u201d\u201cWould you like to take a look?\u201dWilford brought the prepared test paper and handed it to the president. In the case of exam questions, it was possible because the president had the right to see it directly.Among the new teachers who gave theory tests were Bruno from the Golem Studies class, Chris Benimore and Rudger Chelici, who are in charge of the manifestation system.In particular, this test was a matchup full of curiosity among Theon\u2019s teachers, as the two new teachers, who are polar opposites, gave a theoretical test in the same field.\u201cWell, Mr. Bruno asked about the magic circuit that drives the Golem, and the structural mechanics of the Golem. The difficulty itself seems to be okay.\u201d\u201cYes. He has a special affection for golems, so I think it\u2019s okay.\u201dElisa glanced through the exam questions Bruno had made, and nodded her head with satisfaction. He didn\u2019t show anything that exceeded expectations and was just average, so it didn\u2019t seem like a problem.\u201cNext it\u2019s Chris Benimore and Rudger Chelici.\u201d\u201cDo I have to compare them?\u201d\u201cActually, you can\u2019t do it without making a comparison.\u201dWilford nodded with a wry smile.Elisa quickly scanned Chris\u2019s test questions.\u201cWell, Chris asked questions on the side of Mana Release and Elemental Attributes.\u201d\u201cYes, and it\u2019s\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cThe same goes for Mr. Rudger.\u201dNo matter how different the grades they were in charge of, to openly give exam questions in the same field was like declaring war on Rudger.\u201cIt must have hurt his pride to lose the bet.\u201d\u201cSince that day, Hugo Burtag faction has been forced to hang their heads down for almost a week.\u201d\u201cRight. It was so refreshing to see him keep his mouth shut. I feel like I have regained my old self-esteem.\u201dElisha smirked at Chris\u2019 test questions.\u201cI think this test is a simple revenge for Chris. No, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s simple, he seems to have put his heart and soul into it.\u201dAs a result, Chris Benimore\u2019s exam papers were filled with jargon-filled problems, dotted with all kinds of difficult words.\u201cWhat kind of test is this? He\u2019s just bragging about his knowledge.\u201dElisa clicked her tongue and shook her head.Chris Benimore\u2019s excessive arrogance and self-pride eventually led him to the point where he increased the exam difficulty to an absurd level.Will students be able to solve these problems properly?\u201cI told him to give the basics for the first test, but he\u2019s already playing around like this. In particular this theory is something students learn in the third grade.\u201dOf course, even though it was something that was taught in the third grade there were students who already learned it, the aristocratic students of the upper class because they were educated before they joined Theon. On the other hand, the commoner students weren\u2019t.The problem was that he discriminated against the commoner students and favored the noble students.\u201cReally.\u201dElisa had a headache but she couldn\u2019t blame Chris Benimore for this either. The test is up to the teacher, and if she interferes with this, it doesn\u2019t look good.Because she was Theon\u2019s President, she couldn\u2019t do anything she wanted.\u201cWell then, let\u2019s see how Mr. Rudger handled the problem.\u201dIf it were his usual self, it might be more or less the same as Chris or maybe the questions were monotonous because of his overly rigid atmosphere?Elisa looked at Rudger\u2019s test questions with that in mind.\u201c\u2026\u2026What?\u201dShe opened her eyes wide.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This, maybe\u2026\u2026.\u201dAfter muttering something unintelligible, she quickly pursed her lips, picked up her pen, and began to solve the problems.Wilford, who was watching the scene, quietly backed away. It was unusual to see Elisa, the president, like that, so he didn\u2019t want to interrupt her.If it\u2019s her ability, it\u2019ll take less than five minutes to finish it all. But Wilford\u2019s prediction was wrong.This is because Elisa showed no signs of ending even though it was more than five minutes after she started solving Rudger\u2019s test questions.Ten minutes.15 minutes.Twenty minutes have passed like that.Even then, Elisa focused on the problems by endlessly teasing the pen point like a person possessed by something.\u2018Has the president ever held on to a problem for so long?\u2019Wilford was inwardly taken aback by such an unexpected situation. Elisa would always write down the answers to the questions on the spot while looking at the test questions submitted every semester.It was a kind of evaluation of teachers in Theon. And all that assessment was made entirely by the president, Elisa herself.Elisa preferred to solve the test questions given by the teachers herself since she was also a wizard with a great passion for learning.It was a pleasant experience just to look at the problem in a new way she was unaware of. Occasionally, in the case of easy questions she would just skim over them but she never took more than 5 minutes to solve the questions even for the 4th and 5th grade exams, which are very difficult.Even the difficult questions that made her head throb didn\u2019t impress her much. Maybe that\u2019s why Elisa was feeling bored these days.So when she saw so few interesting things she would be too preoccupied with them, just like right now.Elisha recalled the previous her, when she was still learning and was eager to explore the unknown of magic. The sense of accomplishment and pleasure when you finally succeed, even though you feel hopeless about the knowledge you see for the first time.It took Elisa 30 minutes to solve Rudger\u2019s test questions, but it was also because of her desire to slowly savor the delicious dishes, although Rudger\u2019s questions were demanding in the diversity of thinking. Of course, it would have taken at least 15 to 20 minutes, even if she did her best.\u201cIt\u2019s amazing.\u201d\u201cAre you finally done?\u201dWilford, who was waiting, asked in a surprised voice.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I made you wait.\u201d\u201cHa ha. No, I\u2019m glad, it\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve seen the president so motivated.\u201d\u201cWell, that\u2019s true.\u201dElisha did not bother to deny that she was absorbed by the problems. She thought these were really good problems. While demanding a solid foundation, it asks for diversity of opinions and a flexible way of thinking.There were many pitfalls while solving the problem, but even when she saw them, she felt more pleasant than annoyed.\u201cIt\u2019s really amazing. These problems were created by a new teacher. I want to let other teachers solve them.\u201d\u201cIs it that good?\u201d\u201cMr. Rudger is such a boring person that I thought he would just give ordinary questions for the exam.\u201dElisa shrugged her shoulders.\u201cI was mistaken.\u201dCome to think of it, Rudger showed magic beyond basic common sense. Wasn\u2019t this the [source code] magic that he demonstrated to his students in his first class? Magic that enables magic to be implemented at a high speed by making it ridiculously fast. It was something that couldn\u2019t be created by ordinary people.\u201cIt was a flawless test paper.\u201d\u201cCompared to Chris\u2019 test questions?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no comparison. Serious exploration and respect for learning and a means to boast of one\u2019s knowledge. Putting them on the same line is an insult to one side.\u201dChris Benimore tried to prove he was superior to Rudger Chelici with the test questions but Rudger didn\u2019t care about Chris Benimore in the first place. He didn\u2019t even respond to his brawl, he just did the best he could.Indeed, can this be seen as a fight?\u201cIf you ask Chris to solve this, his expression will be quite impressive.\u201dElisa smiled playfully like a child, imagining what would happen sooner or later.Wilford shook his head at the sight, saying, \u201cI can\u2019t stop you.\u201d* * *Rudger put the test papers in his suitcase. Since he finished the test as the first batter, he will be able to take it easy and grade it for the rest of the test period.\u2018I\u2019ve put a lot of effort into this question, but I\u2019m also curious about what the students wrote.\u2019Will the students who usually listened to the class perform well? How many unexpected incorrect answers would the students who did not study properly give out?As a teacher, he had a strange expectation. Although it was a false identity, Rudger felt his own nature in his work.On his way back to his dormitory, Rudger found students gathered in front of him.\u2018Have they finished their test? Oh, is it a practical test?\u2019Rudger was quite familiar with the person who was leading the fifty or so students. The first thing he saw was pink hair that shines under the bright sunlight. She was kind to everyone and always smiling, like a princess from a fairy tale. It was Selina.\u2018It must be a test for the Spirit Studies class.\u2019Selina was in charge of the specialty <Spirit> in the summoning series. Spirits are the embodiment of the energy of nature that exists in Mother Nature. Spiritology is the study of borrowing their power through communication with such spirits.As a result, the theoretical part was all about the history of spirituality, and in fact, most of the conducted classes were practical classes. From how to summon the spirits, to the contract with the spirits, to how to communicate with the spirits and use their powers.It\u2019s still the beginning of the semester, so even if it\u2019s a test, it won\u2019t be that difficult.\u201cThere are no spirits around the students. Is the first test making a contract with a Spirit?\u2019Since there are only a limited number of people who can learn Spirit Studies, the test itself was focused on absolute evaluation rather than relative evaluation.Even if you are an average student, you will be able to pass if you succeed in signing a contract with a lower spirit.As Selina was thinking she saw Rudger getting closer.\u201cOh, Mr. Rudger!\u201dSelina greeted him with a smile.\u201cAre you done with your exams? Come to think of it, you said your test was first, right?\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019m on my way home after finishing it a little while ago.\u201d\u201cOh, I see. I\u2019m just starting an exam.\u201d\u201cIs this a Spiritism Test?\u201d\u201cYes, would you like to take a look?\u201dRudger, who was about to refuse, couldn\u2019t do it as she stared intently at him, because Selina was giving Rudger an SOS gaze.\u2018Are you nervous?\u2019Rudger understood why she asked him to come with her. This test must be the first for Selina and as a teacher, evaluating students can be a burdensome and stressful task. As a result, she turned to Rudger, who had already completed the exam, for help.Rudger wasn\u2019t in charge of Spirit Studies, so he couldn\u2019t really help her.\u2018It\u2019s also true that she would feel relieved when at least a colleague is around.\u2019Normally, it was something that he would easily overlook and make an excuse that he was busy with grading. But he suddenly thought that they\u2019ve been eating and talking together so far, and it would be cold to refuse her.\u2018No matter how fake you are, you\u2019re a teacher right now, it\u2019s not good to be hated by your colleagues.\u2019The aristocratic faction teachers led by Chris Benimore were already hostile to him.Could he reject Selina who was popular among students and teachers so easily? If he did that his reputation that he worked hard on would be ruined.\u2018In fact, I don\u2019t care about my reputation.\u2019The important thing was that he was also helped by Selina, and he couldn\u2019t ignore her request. Thanks to her approaching him first, he was able to talk to other teachers.\u201cI will.\u201dSelina\u2019s expression brightened noticeably as Rudger nodded while the students watched the two with strange eyes.\u201cWhat? Is Mr. Rudger coming?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the relationship between them? Are they dating?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think so. It\u2019s because they\u2019re both new teachers.\u201d\u201cOh, right. You like teacher Selina.\u201d\u201cWhat? It\u2019s not true\u201dSelina, who gained courage, opened her mouth while the students were talking among themselves.\u201cThe exam will start soon, so let\u2019s all move! Let\u2019s finish fast!\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe students moved busily according to Selina\u2019s words.Selina took the lead with Rudger followed by the students. The place that they arrived was the entrance of \u201cForest of Fantasy,\u201d one of the three forests of Theon. In it there are a huge flood of spirits, animals, and other ecosystems.Forest of Fantasy was the largest among the three major forests in Theon. The risk level is level 3, and the general public is prohibited from entering.However, compared to the other two forests with a risk level of 2 or higher, the Forest of Fantasy is relatively safe and it will not be a big problem as they stay at the entrance and don\u2019t go deep in the forest.\u2018In fact, I think this is a safe space because it\u2019s often used as a test site.\u2019Traces of humans were visible everywhere. Even the no-entry signs or guidelines made along the way.Rudger lifted his head and looked up at the endlessly towering trees. Trees with thick roots like large pillars soared high toward the sky. Their height seemed to be over 10 meters.Even though they haven\u2019t fully entered the forest yet, he thought that the inside of this Fantasy Forest would be so dense that it resembled the Amazon.\u2018Is that the Spirit of Light?\u2019Something was floating in the air, sprinkling a subtle light through the trees. Indeed, it is easy to notice the spirits from the entrance of the forest, perhaps because it was a forest full of vitality. Here it would be easy to sign a contract even for students who are not yet familiar with spirituality.\u201cI announced in advance that this test is about signing a contract with a spirit. You can use your magic to communicate with the spirit and become friends.\u201dSelina acted as she spoke. She closed her eyes and activated her magical powers. A warm magical light flashed around Selina and the students exclaimed in admiration.\u201cOooh.\u201d\u201cWow. That\u2019s the ability of a spirit studies teacher.\u201dSpirits hidden throughout the forest appeared one by one in response to Selina\u2019s magic. Some curious spirits flew into the air and wandered around Selina. In an instant, there were cute spirits around Selina.The beautiful sight of a princess in the forest kept the students silent.Selina, who opened her eyes, looked at the little spirits all around her and smiled benevolently, and then she reached out her hand towards the spirit that was like a pure white cotton ball.\u201cHello\u201d\u201cPpiyong!\u201dThe pure white cotton ball accepted Selina\u2019s greeting. Rudger also watched the scene silently.\u201cHehe. You all saw it, right? It\u2019s not difficult. You just have to do it like teacher.\u201dMaybe it was because her words gave them courage, the students immediately activated their magical power and attempted to communicate with the spirits.Small spirits gathered around the students.\u201cWow! It\u2019s working!\u201d\u201cOh, he\u2019s so cute\u201d\u201cHello\u201dThe students\u2019 joyful shouts erupted everywhere. The scene where spirits and students gathered was quite pleasing to Rudger\u2019s eyes.Not wanting to disturb them, Rudger stood a little far from the students.\u201cWould you like to try, Mr. Rudger?\u201dSelina approached Rudger and said.He was going to ask how the students\u2019 tests were going, but shook his head when he saw about three assistants working hard to guide them.\u201cThanks for the offer, but I refuse.\u201d\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not very welcomed by the spirits.\u201d\u201cWhat? No way. The spirits are so nice! Let me introduce you to a cute spirit! It\u2019s the Spirit of Light who signed a contract with me a while ago, and I named it Pongpong!\u201dSelina said so and held out a ball of white cotton on her palm to Rudger but soon she opened her eyes wide.\u201cHuh? Pongpong?\u201dThe spirit in her palm was shaking.\u201cPo, Pongpong? What\u2019s wrong with you?\u201dSelina immediately understood why the spirit was doing this.\u2018Are you afraid?\u2019It wasn\u2019t just Pongpong, the other spirits who wandered through the forest didn\u2019t approach Rudger either.Rudger replied familiarly to Selina\u2019s bewildered look.\u201cI told you.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThe spirits don\u2019t like me very much.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

That is why they are strong, beautiful, and the purest. There are only two kinds of emotions that such spirits feel toward humans, like and indifference.Therefore, when spirits sign contracts with humans, they determine the criteria based on curiosity. No matter how cruel the opponent is, even if they are pointed at by the same people, the spirits don\u2019t care. Because the standard of good and evil that humans share in front of Mother Nature was nothing more than a speck of dust.Nature is not afraid of humans and humans are also a part of Mother Nature. They were one of the elements of the world. Spirits derived from nature have no reason to fear humans, who are part of nature.However it was happening in front of her now. Spirits were afraid of one human being. Selina knew that there has never been a case like this.\u201cMr. Rudger, what\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cTeacher Selina, you don\u2019t have to be so surprised.\u201dSeeing Selina staring at him like he was something strange, Rudger thought he should calm her down a bit.\u201cThere are so many different people in the world. There is nothing strange even if there are people who hate spirits.\u201d\u201cYou look hateful to the spirits?\u201d\u201cYes. I have such a unique physique.\u201dRudger\u2019s excuses were, in fact, absurd to even call them excuses but this was the best excuse Rudger could give because she can\u2019t tell the truth of his true \u2018physique\u2019.\u201cReally?\u201dOf course, Selina was not a complete fool either. There is a degree of naivety but even she would never have believed such nonsense. However if the person who said it was Rudger, the story would be different.Rudger was a mysterious man. Since he came to Theon, he has shown great skills one after another, unbelievably good for a new teacher. Among them, the most famous is the creation of a new magic called Source Code, which has never existed before.Even her, who is a teacher, feels like she is going back to her student days whenever she sees Rudger. Even if people say the same thing, the persuasiveness of it depends on who the messenger is. The existence of Rudger to Selina now was reliable enough to believe whatever he said.\u201cAnd look. It\u2019s mostly the low-level spirits who hate me, other spirits do not.\u201d\u201cuh\u2026\u2026But are there only low-level spirits around?\u201d\u201cThen you can check out the spirit that Selina is calling.\u201dMost of the spirits floating around now are low-level spirits. Selina, on the other hand, has signed contracts with intermediate spirits or higher, as she was invited to become a teacher at Theon at a young age. She already signed contracts with three kinds of intermediate spirits of water, wind, and earth attributes.\u201cOh.\u201dIt was as Rudger said. Her contract spirits, invisible to the eyes of others, existed around Selina. The three intermediate spirits weren\u2019t afraid of Rudger, like the other low-rank spirits.The intermediate spirits that were only visible to her were rather curious about the appearance of other lower spirits.\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d\u201cOh? That\u2019s true. The intermediate and higher spirits who contracted with me are quiet.\u201dSelina\u2019s eyes glittered as she discovered something new.\u201cIt\u2019s more amazing than that! I\u2019ve never seen low-level spirits be afraid of anyone.\u201dSelina closed her face and Rudger pulled his upper body back slightly.\u201cThere are many kinds of people in the world.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I wish Ms. Rudger had also been friendly with her spirits.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s all right, Selina. Is it okay for you to lose this much time with me? The students are waiting.\u201d\u201cYes? Ah! What was I thinking in the middle of a test? Thanks, Mr. Rudger!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t mention it.\u201dSeeing her hurriedly approaching the students and arranging contracts with their spirits, Rudger sighed in relief. It passed like this because it was Selina, but if it was someone else, he might have questioned.\u2018I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t run out of magic.\u2019Rudger was fully aware that the spirits were afraid of him but it was not exactly him that the low level spirits were afraid of, but something else that was behind him.\u2018I still have a lot of magical power now, so I don\u2019t think the Intermediate Spirits saw it.\u2019But when he consumes a lot of his magic and if the [noise] resonates in his head, the intermediate spirits will respond. Otherwise, it would have been hard to even explain to Selina.\u2018Even in my condition, the lower spirits are aware of it. Ironically, being the weakest being, they are aware of this strange power.\u2019Far away from the students, Rudger chewed and swallowed a magic potion to avoid being caught by others.Rudger\u2019s gaze turned to Selina, who praised the student who had just successfully signed a contract with a spirit. She was genuinely delighted with her student\u2019s success as if it were her own.\u2018More than that, did Selina only contracted intermediate spirits?\u2019First of all, she is known to have a total of three intermediate spirits. Intermediate spirits of water, intermediate spirits of wind, and intermediate spirits of the earth, respectively.That was definitely a great skill but to become a teacher at Theon she should have one more thing she is confident in besides that.Rudger thought so, and narrowed his eyes at a sudden strange sensation.\u2018Sight.\u2019Rudger rolled his eyes and followed the owner of the gaze that was directed in this direction.\u2018Where is it?\u2019]First of all, it was not the students. The direction of the gaze was among the dense trees but it was hard to guess the exact direction, as if a fog had spread around.\u2018Is it a spirit?\u2019Low-level spirits fear him and are reluctant to even come near him and intermediate spirits roam only around Selina.\u2018The strange heat felt with the gaze. He must be quite powerful.\u2019Yes, this is definitely the Spirit of Fire. Just being a little interested in it is enough to affect the temperature of the surrounding atmosphere.It\u2019s at least an advanced spirit.When compared with wizards they exert at least the power of the fifth rank. Especially in the case of strong individuals, up to the sixth rank is possible. Above all, the gaze is full of vigilance.\u2018There\u2019s no way a superior spirit would appear in a place like this because it\u2019s the entrance to the Fantasy Forest.\u2019Besides, this is literally a forest. Spirits living in the forest are basically spirits of plants, light, water, wind, and land. Fire spirits were often seen in hot places, mainly in volcanic areas and deserts. But in this forest, even in the outskirts, an advanced fire spirit appeared.\u2018Other students didn\u2019t seem to be aware of its existence.\u2019Neither did Selina, who is very sensitive to spirits.\u2018He is not a guy that exists in a natural state. Someone artificially beckons him.\u2019From the gaze facing this direction, I can even feel the intention of criticizing what kind of person I am. Indeed, is he trying to confirm whether I\u2019m really a threat because I\u2019m feared by the spirits?It was a little annoying for Rudger, but he didn\u2019t mean to make it obvious in the current situation.\u2018Is there someone else in this forest who commands spirits? Or is someone hidden among the students controlling this spirit?\u2019He wasn\u2019t sure yet but if he shows his strength to identify the Spirit of Flame, he will run away immediately. For now, he had no choice but to let it act as it pleases.\u2018A person who commands higher spirits while hiding his identity.\u2019A spirit studies teacher in charge of senior students? The chances were extremely low. Rather, there is only one being who could do that, a First Order.A member of the Black Dawn Society hidden in Theon. Him or her, student or teacher, an existence that has not even been identified yet since unlike other Black Dawn members, it is the only one who may notice his strangeness.\u2018I don\u2019t know why he\u2019s suddenly looking at me like this. Or is it some kind of signal?\u2019If so, how do you react here? If he reacts explicitly, it can be counterproductive.The opponent is a First Order of the Black Dawn Society. As an executive of a secret organization, he will be careful when contacting an executive of the same rank.If so, what should he do?Rudger opened his mouth, just in case.\u201cIt\u2019s a little hot.\u201dA spontaneous murmur to oneself it\u2019s nothing more than a normal reaction. However, the meaning was clearly conveyed to the person staring at this side.\u2018There\u2019s a response.\u2019The source was not something that even Rudger could do. It can\u2019t be removed, and it\u2019s not something that can be ignored. On the contrary, if he doesn\u2019t maintain his mana all the time, that source would try to encroach on him.It was for this reason that he kept taking magic pills on a regular basis to keep his magic power to the maximum.There are a total of three restrictions so only the low-level spirits respond.\u2018It\u2019s just a prediction, but higher-grade spirits will respond if 2 or all 3 are lifted.\u2019It wasn\u2019t much of a pleasure for Rudger either. Even if only one restriction is lifted, Rudger would hear the tiresome noises in his head, if two are lifted he would feel their touch.And for the last restriction his teacher told him not to lift it even if he dies so it\u2019s hard to even imagine what will happen.\u2018How did this happen?\u2019Suddenly, he remembered what his mother said in his previous life.[All sorts of beings are watching you.]He didn\u2019t believe it at the time, but he\u2019s been aware of it every day since he came here. So he was annoyed because he kept remembering memories that he doesn\u2019t want to recall.At that moment a small spark ignited in front of Rudger\u2019s eyes and eventually turned into letters. Rudger was not surprised at the sight since he had already finished preparing his mind and calmly scanned the letters engraved with fireworks with his eyes.\u2018What\u2019s so frustrating is that the other side approached me first.\u2019[Three days later. After school hours. Here again.]The First Order, which he had been looking for so much, attempted to contact him first.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In the midst of extreme tension, they burn their competitive spirit towards each other and they\u2019re exhausted both mentally and physically.However, just as the rain at the end of the drought was sweet, the sense of freedom that came when the three-day test was completely over was indescribable.\u201cWow! It\u2019s finally over!\u201d\u201cOh, I\u2019ve had a hard time for three days.\u201dThe freshmen who just entered Theon were very happy that they finished their first test and even the senior students felt a sense of freedom after the test was over.\u201cHey, how was your test this time?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t mention it. I think I\u2019m screwed.\u201d\u201cI hope my ranking is at least in the middle.\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about? The lower ranks will be close.\u201dOf course, the main concern of the students gathering around the school was the test results. How was the test, who did well, and which teacher\u2019s test was the easiest and most comfortable.If they knew which teacher\u2019s test is reasonable, next semester will be aimed at completing the said teacher class.\u201cCurses are not my cup of tea.\u201d\u201cI think I\u2019m more suited to discharging magic.\u201d\u201cNext time, I\u2019ll focus on alchemy.\u201dStudents who have passed the first test will now have a sense of urgency. Do they choose a class with a bang or a honey class?\u201cMr. Merida\u2019s test was good this time. It\u2019s a theoretical part of drug manufacturing, and it was detailed.\u201d\u201cTeacher Selina\u2019s test was very simple. If you connect with a Spirit and sign a contract, you will definitely get a pass.\u201d\u201cHey, that\u2019s limited to students who met basic requirements for taking the Spirit Studies class. People with low affinity can\u2019t do it. I\u2019ll just choose Golem studies or something similar.\u201d\u201cI heard that certain maniacs are so good at Golem studies that it\u2019s hard to get in the top ranks\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t mention it. There are so many people who are wearing glasses and just mumbling about the parts.\u201dThere was a hot topic that came to mind among students while they were discussing this subject.\u201cDid you hear the news? I mean, Mr. Rudger Chelici test.\u201d\u201cYeah, I heard it was really hard\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not just that it\u2019s hard, but I heard people couldn\u2019t solve it properly even though it was an open book test.\u201d\u201cWow. Then was there something behind the scenes?\u201d\u201cNo, people said it was hard but rational. Anyway, it felt like that. In addition, the questions were given exactly from what they were taught.\u201d\u201cDoesn\u2019t Mr. Rudger teach manifestation?\u201d\u201cUh. It overlaps with Mr. Chris Benimore.\u201dOriginally, Chris Benimore, who is in charge of the first grade, and Rudger Chelici, who is in charge of the second grade, never bumped into each other. However, as Rudger accepted to teach first graders, the two could not avoid comparison.\u201cHow was Mr. Chris\u2019 exam?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t ask. We were tested in areas that were not taught.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cI heard it\u2019s a course that you can only learn if you\u2019re in the third grade or older and I just made a hard bet. It was ridiculous, really.\u201d\u201cWow, that\u2019s crazy.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t even mention it. The test papers are full of jargon I\u2019ve never seen before. You have to be able to use it even if you try to get a partial score. I really regret it. I should have just taken Mr. Rudger\u2019s class. Did you take Mr. Rudger\u2019s class?\u201d\u201cYeah. I was really lucky. Someone complimented me a lot on \u201cAkashic Records\u201d, so I just chose it half-heartedly, and it was awesome.\u201d\u201cHey, will Mr. Rudger teach you the source code magic if you\u2019re in the top ranks?\u201d\u201cIf you consistently finish in the top five, you\u2019ll learn complete source code magic.\u201d\u201cI envy you. At least you still have an award that motivates you, we don\u2019t even have that. What should we commoners do in this situation?\u201dChris Benimore\u2019s class was authoritarian, dismissive and contemptuous of the common people, so was not very popular with the students. With the exception of a certain few students who benefit from him, Chris\u2019s class is of the kind that is both terribly difficult and irritating.For students who took the class because of their high grades, they had no choice but to sigh every day in a class that was completely different from what they imagined.\u201cI will definitely take Rudger\u2019s class next semester.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not going to be easy\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cThere are a lot of competitors. They would all stand in line to attend Mr. Rudger\u2019s class. He even rarely selects assistant teachers unlike other teachers.\u201d\u201cReally? I have to take the manifestation class next semester, how do I do it?\u201d\u201cYou have to figure it out.\u201d* * *In a large office decorated with ornate ornaments Chris Benimore checked the questionnaire in his hand and soon twisted his face ferociously.\u201cRudger Chelici\u2026\u2026.\u201dChris Benimore didn\u2019t know how to cool off his anger when he saw the test questions that Rudger had given this time.[Mr. Chris. You did a great job giving the test questions. Here, take this!]Elisa Willow the president suddenly appeared and gave him a test paper but before he could ask what it was, Elisha smiled at him.[Chris, you\u2019re in charge of manifestation class, right? That\u2019s why I\u2019m giving it to you because I think it\u2019ll be helpful for the next exam. You don\u2019t have to say thank you.]Chris Benimore immediately recognized what the test questions the president handed him were, or, to be exact, whose.Rudger Chelici.It was the questions that the hateful man gave in the first test. Rather than wondering why it was given to him, his eyes were faster to scan the contents.Chris Benimore is also a wizard who explores the truth. It was natural to wonder what questions a teacher other than himself asked.Chris Benimore, who looked through all 20 questions in 10 minutes, was forced to crumple the test paper with strength in his hands.\u201cDamn it!\u201dHe realized why the president handed him the test paper.\u201cDo you want me to emulate the exam questions that Rudger Chelici gave?\u201dHow can he not know the intentions contained in the president\u2019s words?This is a test paper that was handed out openly to \u2018refer to it\u2019.From the fact that it wasn\u2019t just a test paper made by an old teacher, but a new teacher who was appointed at the same time as him it was obviously the president\u2019s insidious intention to blatantly check their side, which favors aristocratic students.\u2018Damn it! Why do I, the eldest son of the Benimore\u2019s, have to suffer like this?\u2019Chris gnashed his teeth, unable to contain his anger. He grew up as an aristocrat, learned magic, and was an elite of the empire. He even became a teacher at Theon Academy, a top educational institution that fosters wizards responsible for the continent\u2019s future.There was a family behind him, but he would not have been able to come this far if his skills were not good enough.Chris was proud of his accomplishments. He was convinced that he would be one of the pillars of the era but the blatant comparison with someone else was an unbearable act for him, whose pride was soaring in the sky.No, he was okay with the comparison but he was upset that the results were not what he wanted.\u2018You\u2019re comparing a fallen aristocrat to me?\u2019The President\u2019s tone even seems to say that he was clearly below Rudger. If she wasn\u2019t a higher-ranking wizard than himself, Chris would have been spoken back. But most of all, it was Rudger\u2019s test that made Chris Benimore angry.He didn\u2019t want to admit it, but the problems Rudger created were of a very high level.\u201cIs this a problem created by a fallen aristocrat?\u201dHe was really angry for another reason.As soon as he saw the problem of Rudger Chelici, who had ignored and looked down on it, he admitted it to himself without realizing it. The fact that he recognized the person who was supposed to be under his feet, not anyone else, left a big scar on Chris\u2019 pride.\u201cRudger Chelici\u2026\u2026!\u201dChris Benimore chewed out his name.He didn\u2019t like him from the first time he met him and after the bet they made under the pretext of the students\u2019 duel he hated Rudger more than anyone else in the world.\u2018I\u2019ll make sure you\u2019ll pay for this humiliation\u2019Chris was thinking of the Magic Festival day when he was going to defeat Rudger in front of everyone.To do so he had to find his weakness so Chris Benimore communicated with his family through a magic crystal ball.\u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d* * *Rene walked down the street with her lunch box. Originally, he had to eat with Erendir after the test, but Erendir, who ruined the test, became depressed and left her alone.\u2018I hope you get well soon.\u2019She was worried about Erendir and since her exam was over, she thought that she could relax a little but she met the aristocratic gang, whom she did not want to meet.\u201cSo there I\u2026 \u2026 uh?\u201dMoreover, the other party immediately recognized her and smiled. There were two men and two women and she didn\u2019t especially want to meet the rogue-looking man with drab blonde hair.Santoni Oatmouth is the descendant of a count and he has been vindictive since he confessed to her a while ago and was rejected.\u201cWho is this? A commoner who lives with a very proud and noble taste, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cOh, what? You\u2019re not going to accept my greeting? I\u2019m disappointed.\u201dInstead of answering, Line tried to avoid the gang, but Santoni blocked her way.\u201c\u2026\u2026Please get out of my way.\u201d\u201cWhat? I can\u2019t hear you well.\u201d\u201cAre you still holding a grudge for having confessed back then? You are so narrow-minded and don\u2019t deserve to be an aristocrat.\u201dRene also responded harshly. In the first place, she wasn\u2019t the type to bow down. She got into a fight with Dunema Rommli on the training ground for actually saying what she had to say.\u201cYou, you\u2026!\u201dWhen Rene revealed his dark history, Santoni grimly face distorted.He glanced around. In the first place, this neighborhood is near an artificial park where few people come and go. Before long a sadistic smile lingered on his face.\u201cFollow me.\u201d\u201cWhat? What is it? Let go of me!\u201dSantoni grabbed Rene by the wrist and dragged her into the park. Rene resisted desperately, but the difference in power couldn\u2019t be made up.In addition, other students with Santoni laughed, saying it was fun to see her in pain.\u201cIsn\u2019t it the job of the nobles to educate the cheeky commoners?\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201dSantoni, who dragged Line to a place where no one else would come and pushed her. Line collapsed weakly on the floor, and the lunch box in her hand rolled around on the floor. Her lunch, which had been kept inside, spilled on the floor.Rene raised her eyes at Santoni.\u201c\u2026\u2026Do you know what you\u2019ve done now?\u201d\u201cWow, look at these eyes. Do you still not understand the situation you\u2019re in?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dSantoni expected Rene to beg in front of him, tremble and apologize. Contrary to his expectations, however, Rene glared at him venomously. Facing her unshakable eyes, Santoni felt as if he had become a loser.Suddenly, he was fascinated by her appearance and remembered when I was dumped.\u201cHow dare you raise your eyes at me?\u201dShe was a dirty commoner but he treated her a little nice because she had a smooth appearance and now she was arguing with him.\u201cThat\u2019s why commoners need education.\u201dSantoni pulled a cane from his waist and aimed it at Rene.It was the moment when magic gathered on Santoni staff.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dSantoni hurriedly turned his head at the sudden voice. There was a man with his arms folded and his shoulders leaning against a tree in the garden, pale-looking skin, sharp eyes and dark blue hair.Santoni, a nobleman, recognized who he was at once.\u201cSir Freuden Ulburg?\u201dAlthough he is a sophomore in Theon, he is the leader of the noble faction, a man who is both awe-inspiring and a symbol of fear.\u201cSir, why are you here?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s strange. I asked a question first and I haven\u2019t heard the answer yet.\u201dFreuden eyes went back and forth between Rene, who fell on the floor, and Santoni, who pointed a cane at her.\u201cI\u2019ll ask again. What are you doing?\u201dHis voice was as cold as ever.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 88": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Academy\u2019s Undercover ProfessorCH 88Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayC88: Daily life after the test (2)Rene was just confused by the situation. It is true that she ran into Santoni\u2019s gang, was in danger and she thought it would be good if someone could help.However, she did not expect that the one who would help her would be Freuden Ulburg, one of the three dukes of the Empire.Even at a young age, he led a faction and stood tall on the heads of aristocratic students. Of course, Theon is full of geniuses and super humans who solve everything on their own without being ruled by anyone, but that doesn\u2019t mean that the light of the name Freuden is fading.That Freuden was now staring at Santoni with cold eyes.\u2018Senior, you\u2019re really a scary person, as the rumors say.\u2019The rumors of Freuden were also popular among the common people. So, when she first encountered him, she was afraid and she was surprised to discover that he was an unexpectedly easy-going person.But now Rene realized that rumors about Freuden were never wrong or misleading and the energy he exuded proved it.\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you answering? Did I ask a difficult question?\u201dSantoni sensed the danger and hurriedly opened his mouth.\u201cI was just educating a cheeky commoner.\u201dFreuden\u2019s eyes turned to Rene.\u2018Ugh.\u2019Rene trembled involuntarily. She froze up without even thinking of getting up from the ground. Come to think of it, it wasn\u2019t exactly a situation she would like to be in.The opponent was Freuden Ulburg, leader of the aristocratic students in Theon and she is just a commoner. Between Santoni and her, it was obvious who Freuden was going to turn to.\u201cSo.\u201dFreuden, who understood the whole situation, opened his mouth.\u201cAre you saying that the four of us are educating one commoner?\u201d\u201cYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\u201d\u201cYou. What\u2019s your name?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s Santoni Oatmouth.\u201d\u201cOatmouth, hmm. Is it the Earl of Oatmouth? I think I vaguely heard him.\u201dHe never heard of a count\u2019s family?Even Santoni, who was likely to feel insulted, accepted the fact as if it was natural because Freuden\u2019s someone who\u2019s in a position where he can do that.\u201cSo, the son of the Oatmouth family along with three others is in such a remote place bullying a commoner girl?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean bully?\u201dOne of the girls from Santoni group made an excuse in haste.\u201cThat\u2019s not true. We\u2019re just educating her. Yes, I was just trying to educate her.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s education?\u201d\u201cYes, yes!\u201dFreuden was popular with young women not only because he was the head of the aristocratic faction, but also because of his beautiful appearance. Therefore, the two girls who were with Santoni, desperately made excuses to look good in front of Freuden without knowing that their actions were irritating him.\u201cIt\u2019s the common girl\u2019s fault. She dared to stand in front of the nobles and ignore us.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right! We were just trying to lecture such a cheeky commoner!\u201dAt some point, Freuden frowned at the four people who started to talk believing that their actions were justice.\u201cNoisy.\u201d\u201cMr. Freuden?\u201d\u201cNot just noisy, it\u2019s disgusting.\u201d\u201cYes, yes?\u201dThe four didn\u2019t understand why Freuden was so hostile to them.Why is he staring at them like that? They were just punishing a commoner. Why is he so angry? Come to think of it, why was Freudian here?\u201cMr. Freuden. Is it because we interrupted Mr. Freuden\u2019s rest?\u201dThey thought he was angry because they were interrupting his resting time. However, Santoni made a big mistake.\u201cYou really don\u2019t know?\u201d\u201cWhat? What do you mean we don\u2019t know? No way. Because we\u2019re doing something about a commoner girl\u2026\u2026? Ha, ha, ha. No way.\u201dThat didn\u2019t make sense and Santoni laughed senselessly.That Freuden Ulburg was worried about the commoner girl and got angry at this situation?Santoni figured that Freuden must have felt bad because they showed a dirty commoner in front of him and nodded his head in a wild guess.\u201cI\u2019m sorry to interrupt your break. I\u2019ll take care of it in a quiet place right away.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026You really don\u2019t seem to understand me. Do you still not know why I\u2019m angry?\u201d\u201cWhat? If it\u2019s not\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t believe it.\u201dFreuden clicked his tongue and let go of his hands.\u201cI can\u2019t do this.\u201d\u201cWhat? What\u2019s\u2026\u2026.\u201dWhen Santoni was about to ask something the atmosphere became several times heavier, and pressed his body from top to bottom.Santoni fell flat on the floor and looked like a frog.Freuden looked down at Santoni, who was lying face down on the ground and couldn\u2019t even raise his head.\u201cMr. Freuden! What are you doing?\u201dSantoni\u2019s friend stepped up and asked. However, his protest was extinguished as easily as a candle in the wind when he faced Freuden gaze.Freuden\u2019s gaze went beyond him and reached the two noble girls who were observing the situation from behind. The noble girls trembled at the feeling of their skin getting cold.\u201cYou still don\u2019t know why I\u2019m doing this?\u201d\u201cYes Yes? We do not know why Mr. Freuden is doing this.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s enough. It\u2019s not worth it.\u201dFreuden released his crushing magic and barely free from the pressure, Santoni gasped and rose, his face covered with dirt.His gaze toward Freuden was a mixture of anger, embarrassment and fear.\u201cLeave the child and go.\u201d\u201cAre you defending the commoners Mr. Freuden?\u201d\u201cCommoners? That\u2019s funny.\u201dFreuden rolled up the corner of his mouth and laughed.\u201cI just didn\u2019t want to see the garbage that wasn\u2019t aristocratic. Why? Are you angry because you suddenly got into a rough situation?\u201d\u201cOh, no.\u201dSantoni bowed his head immediately. Even if he is the son of a count, his opponent is the son of a duke. Besides, he felt how strong Freuden was when he was under his spell a moment ago. There was no sign of the magic manifestation process and he was beaten without knowing how.He was angry, but also afraid of him.\u201cGo away. I won\u2019t say it again.\u201dFreuden hated repeating the same thing.Seeing Santoni and his lackeys running away like defeated soldiers, Rene could not close he her slightly open mouth, and could only watch the scene.Freuden sighed and approached Rene when Santoni\u2019s group completely disappeared.Line finally came to her senses.\u201cSunbae?\u201d\u201cGet up.\u201dFreuden said and held out his hand to Rene. Line looked at his face and hands alternately, and soon stretched on her own.Freudian shrugged his shoulders and put his hands away and Rene bowed.\u201c\u2026\u2026Thank you for your help.\u201d\u201cI just did what I had to do.\u201d\u201cWell, then I\u2019ll go.\u201dRene said and sighed as she looked at her lunchbox lying on the floor.\u2018I\u2019m having a hard time with the textbook costs these days, and I can\u2019t believe the rice I barely prepared is now on the ground.\u2019\u201cWas it lunch?\u201d\u201cIt was.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019ll be hard to eat. What are you going to do?\u201d\u201cNo, no! It\u2019s okay! But the potatoes can be eaten if I shake off some dirt.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 It fell to the ground\u201dLine also smiled awkwardly and covered it up.\u201cHehe. I\u2019m just kidding. I should just skip lunch. That\u2019s great. It\u2019s perfect if you think about dieting.\u201d\u201cThere seems to be nowhere else to lose.\u201d\u201cThank you for the compliment.\u201dRene smiled bitterly. She was very grateful that Freuden adjusted his mood.After a brief look at Rene, Freuden turned around and said,\u201cFollow me.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI was going to have lunch just now.\u201d\u201cUh\u2026\u2026 If it\u2019s lunch, are you eating here, Mr. Freuden?\u201d\u201cI like to eat in a quiet place.\u201d\u201cOh, in that garden?\u201d\u201cYes, and I basically pack my own meals.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dRene at a loss, thought it was already spilled water and followed in Freuden footsteps.The place she followed him to was the small garden she had visited before. Come to think of it, it was close to the garden where Santoni forced her. Maybe that\u2019s why Freuden heard the fuss and came to check.\u201cHere it is.\u201dFreuden grabbed a small bundle on one side of the vacant lot. Inside of it was a luxurious lunch box but the inner contents were more impressive than the exterior.It was full of luxurious dishes that she couldn\u2019t imagine and it was decorated nicely, so just looking at it made her mouth water.\u201cIs this your lunch?\u201d\u201cYeah, let\u2019s share it, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think I can finish it all by myself. I got excited and made too much.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dRene had no choice but to be surprised when she heard that Freuden made his own lunch.\u201cNo way. Did you make all of these?\u201d\u201cYeah, family cooks are not reliable. I\u2019ve read books since I was seven years old, and I\u2019ve always cooked and eaten my meals.\u201d\u201cSince you were seven years old?\u201dRene\u2019s head felt dizzy. What did she do at that age?Rene tried to recall the past, but nothing came to mind because she was an orphan with no parents and no home in the first place.When she came to her senses, she had been growing up in a church, and when she grew up, she got noticed by a strange wizard, learned a variety of magic and thanks to the preferential treatment system she was admitted to Theon.\u201cTry it.\u201d\u201cCan I really do that?\u201d\u201cHurry.\u201d\u201cOh, yes.\u201dIt was hard to bear the hunger to say no, so Rene nodded because it seemed like it was not polite to refuse Freuden. And as soon as she picked up a piece of meat with a prepared fork, Rene opened her eyes wide at the feast of flavors exploding in her mouth.\u2018Oh, my God. It\u2019s so good!\u2019She has a low appetite, so she eats almost anything, but it wasn\u2019t to the point where she couldn\u2019t tell the difference between the elaborate dishes.Rene came to realize how great Freuden was. He has a nice family, and he looks great. He\u2019s an aristocrat who even knows how to do housework. He\u2019s like the main character of a romance novel that\u2019s very popular among young people these days.Rene wondered why such a person took such good care of her.Perhaps?Rene, who had expectations, shook her head.\u2018I\u2019m sure he just thinks that I\u2019m a good person. Let\u2019s just eat.\u2019Eating something delicious washed away all the bad things that happened a while ago.Freuden stared silently at Rene, while she was eating.* * *Night fell.Street lamps, which were turned on by magic, brightly lit the road, and lights that had not yet been turned off from several buildings leaked out through the windows.I walked in darkness where even such a light could not reach, to the entrance of the Fantasy Forest because we promised to meet here.\u2018You haven\u2019t come yet.\u2019At that time, Selina came to this place so that the students could make a contract with the spirits, but no presence was felt around him now.Occasionally, spirits shining faintly in the dark appeared, but when they saw him, they were surprised and ran away.Today he will encounter a First Order for the first time and he wondered what kind of person he was and if his identity would be seen through.[You came early.]A voice came from the darkness. At the same time, flames fluttered in the air, and soon it turned into a ball of fire the size of a human fist.I stared at the flame with a subdued gaze.TL note: I don\u2019t know how I do it but I always end up with a cliffhanger. Sorry for the cliff\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019ll try to release some chapter tomorrow.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 89": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Academy\u2019s Undercover ProfessorCH 89Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayC89: First Order Esmeralda (1)One more chapter later.I\u2019m looking forward to meeting the First Order.Rudger, who confirmed that the opponent appeared only as a flame without showing up, had no choice but to bite his tongue inwardly.\u2018You don\u2019t reveal yourself, but we meet like this.\u2019In fact, it was not a situation that he didn\u2019t expect. A First Order will have to carefully hide its identity and not be exposed.Considering the way he was signaled to meet, he vaguely expected something like this.\u201cYou\u2019re late.\u201dWhatever the case, the owner of the flame in front of him is a First Order. Even if he doesn\u2019t know its true identity, he shouldn\u2019t show his disappointment.At this moment when they face each other and talk, if he let his guard down even a little bit, the other party might be suspicious of his identity.\u2018There\u2019s no such thing as regret.\u2019Rudger immediately washed away his miscellaneous thoughts. Even if they don\u2019t meet in person, there are plenty of ways to get to know the other person.A word that they say without any intention can be a great clue.[I didn\u2019t know you would be here so early]The answer came back in a slightly hoarse voice. Although the flames were fluttering and the voice reverberated, it was easy to tell that the subject was a woman.He didn\u2019t think that voice was used to deceive him.His opponent must be aware that he is Rudger Chelici, the \u2018First Order\u2019, and she wouldn\u2019t use such a troublesome way.\u201cSo what did you call me for?\u201dRudger said, trying to figure out the opponent\u2019s intention.The [John Doe] that he is impersonating right now is a very relentless and merciless human being, even when it comes to members from the Black Dawn Society. He\u2019s always annoyed and angry, and even kills them if he\u2019s too annoyed.Nevertheless, he maintained his First Order position because he was capable and Zero Order thought highly of him but there is no guarantee that it will be the same for the others First Orders.Would this [John Doe] character behave as usual to the other First Orders?Adding unnecessary words could have made him reveal who he really is so he must be careful with whatever he says now.[Hmm?]Was Rudger\u2019s question unexpected?A surprised voice came from the flame.\u201c\u2026\u2026What\u2019s wrong?\u201d[You\u2019re less angry than I thought. You used to try to tear me apart.]\u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of time and place. If I get angry in a place like this, is there any advantage besides getting caught?\u201d[Oh. That\u2019s definitely true, too. You\u2019re a teacher of Theon now.]\u201cI\u2019m very busy right now. I don\u2019t know why you called me, but I\u2019ll go back if you have nothing more to say.\u201dWith that said, Rudger turned his back. Of course, it is not right to leave as he has not yet fully figured out who his opponent is. However, a detailed review of the situation changes the story.In the first place, it was the flame in front of him, the other First Order, that asked for this meeting.Since the other party wants something from him he can leave without worries because the other party will try to stop him.[Wait.]Indeed, as he expected, the flame stopped him. Rudger stopped walking but he didn\u2019t look back.He\u2019ll listen for now, but it means he\u2019s not fully committed and the opponent didn\u2019t know that.[Okay. Sorry, I\u2019m late. I made an appointment first, but I offended you because I was just joking around.]\u201cJust get to the point.\u201d[Whew. You\u2019re still hard and cold. Anyway, I called you like this because I need help.]Only then did Rudger look back.\u201cHelp? You?\u201d[\u2026\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t normally do it, but this is Theon and I can\u2019t do things my way.]Do things your way. If you say that with your own mouth, , it means that what you\u2019ve been doing before was pretty glamorous.\u201cYou seem pretty impatient.\u201d[My second order disappeared recently]\u201cIt\u2019s because of the Almighty Stone.\u201d[Yes, that\u2019s it. They tried to take matters into their own hands, but they completely screwed it up!]Just thinking about what happened at that time made the flames stronger. The heat reached Rudger, but he kept a casual look on his face and the flame, which grew bigger, returned to its original size.\u201cBut they\u2019re all dead.\u201d[Right. Who knew the president would kill them all? It\u2019s even\u2026\u2026.]\u201cIt was a trap.\u201d[What? You know everything?]How can he not know that? If he had not left right away, he would have been swept away by the president\u2019s magic. Of course he can\u2019t be honest about it, so he\u2019ll just answer in a sloppy way.\u201cThere\u2019s no way I won\u2019t know.\u201d[As expected, of John Doe. Come to think of it, that was your role. Disguise yourself and hide in the enemy\u2019s camp to win the admiration of others and steal information. Your skills didn\u2019t die.]\u201cThat\u2019s enough nonsense.\u201dAt Rudger\u2019s reaction the flame, which was expanding playfully, became slightly withered. Surprisingly, she is a chatterbox.[Anyway, I lost a subordinate that I thought was useful, so my plan was disrupted. It\u2019s a plan that\u2019s left to be carried out right away.]\u201cBecause you treated such a person as a subordinate, you ended up like that.\u201dRudger said, giving his opponent a hard time.The flame remained silent because there was nothing to refute.[\u2026Well, I\u2019m in a different field than you. You just do things quietly on your own, but I can\u2019t do it.]\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d[What is that silence?] That\u2019s why you\u2019re not popular even among our First Orders. Because I don\u2019t get along with anyone.]\u201cI just didn\u2019t feel the need.\u201d[Ha. So funny. You\u2019re so handsome and you\u2019ve always been loyal to Zero Order. You\u2019re the only one who\u2019s good, right? Getting a lot of love from Zero?]\u201cNoisy. So what do you want help with?\u201d[Will you help me?]]\u201cLet\u2019s hear it first.\u201dAt Rudger\u2019s words, the opponent seemed dissatisfied and the flames were shaking. However, from their conversation, Rudger was convinced that he was in control.The Second Order, who died during the Almighty Stone incident, was her subordinate, and because her immediate subordinate disappeared it caused a major setback in her future plans.\u2018However, it would be impossible to use another Second Order and a third order. It\u2019s not good enough.\u2019One thing Rudger knew for sure while playing Sedina was that the Black Dawn Society consists of seven First Orders along with the Second and Third Orders under them which naturally divides the \u201cfaction\u201d inside.\u2018Perhaps the second order, who died trying to steal the Almighty Stone this time, is most likely her subordinate.\u2019Did he say his name was Demires? Even if he was a master of his own will, he must have been a competent subordinate. With such a man dead, the plan she had made must be completely blank. However, calling another Second Order will inevitably lead to hesitation because their \u201cfaction\u201d is different.If she uses the Second Order of the opposing faction, she will show another First Order her weakness.\u2018I see. That\u2019s why you asked me for help.\u2019Unlike other First Orders, Rudger Chelici acted alone, and he wasn\u2019t part of any faction. Those without factions were neutral.[You know, my specialty is setting fire but no matter how much I set fire in Theon, the wizards quickly extinguish the fire. It\u2019s an environment where I can\u2019t use my talents well.]\u201cYes.\u201dIn Theon, both teachers and students can use magic. Since the place is full of elites any fire can be easily extinguished. Above all, there is no way that there is no way that there is no preparation for a fire in Theon, where all kinds of things happen with the use of magic.In particular, it should have been considered impossible to set a fire in Theon, since strict preparations were made. Nevertheless, she did not give up.\u2018She\u2019s capable enough to set a fire, I guess.\u2019She could not have become an executive of the Black Dawn Society for no reason.[My role is focused on destruction but the defense here is solid. That doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t do anything. If you make the preparations, I can burn more brightly than anyone else]\u201cAre you asking me to prepare for that?\u201d[I\u2019d appreciate it if you did. If you help me, I will also give you the corresponding help. It\u2019s kind of a deal and a promise.]\u201cWhose deal is it with?\u201d[Of course] It\u2019s John Doe\u2019s deal with Esmeralda.]Rudger found out the name of the person who made the fire in front of him.I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a code name like John Doe or a real name.\u2018In the case of John Doe, he completely concealed his identity and called himself by a code name, but Esmeralda likely didn\u2019t just like Victor Dreadful.\u2019John Doe was an unusual case, and I didn\u2019t think the rest would.[\u2026Hey, do you have to check like this to make your stomach feel better?]\u201cIt\u2019s better to make a deal clear.\u201dRudger said calmly so as not to be caught rejoicing.[I told you honestly and now it\u2019s your turn to answer. Do you accept my offer?]\u201cI refuse.\u201d[What?]\u201cThere\u2019s nothing I can do for you in my situation.\u201d[Wait. Are you really going to do this after listening to everything?]The flames burned more strongly as if they were expressing anger but Rudger stared at the flames with a blank face and no sign of fear.\u201cAre you asking because you don\u2019t know my position? I\u2019m a teacher of Theon. Even if it\u2019s nominal, it\u2019s not an easy place to move.\u201d[If you\u2019re good enough, you can do it. You always try as hard as you can to hide yourself. It\u2019s just annoying, so can you do more than make an excuse?]\u201cI would normally have, but not now.\u201d[Why?]\u201cThe president is still suspicious of me.\u201dEsmeralda could not argue more and shut up when the president was mentioned.[You really can\u2019t? Even though it\u2019s a job that would put me in debt?]\u201cYes.\u201d[There\u2019s nothing we can do. Then we have to pick the right person]When she clearly drew her line, Esmeralda took a step back, fearing that hanging on to me would hurt her self-esteem.[But keep this in mind. If this is successful, it will help our Black Dawn Society a lot and you kicked the chance.]\u201cEveryone has their own thing to do. Just because I don\u2019t help you doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not loyal to the organization.\u201d[You talk annoyingly as well. Anyway I\u2019ll take care of it myself.]I was grateful that she would give up on her own. However, Esmeralda kept complaining because she was angry that she was rejected.[I was crazy to ask you for help.]\u201cSo what are you going to do in the future?\u201d[Are you curious now?]Even though the words were so blunt, she didn\u2019t hide anything.[What am I supposed to do? As always, I\u2019m doing what I\u2019m good at.]\u201cI see. Do your best.\u201dThere was nothing more to be gained by asking more questions. Above all, he already figured out what he can find out, so this meeting was not without benefits for him.When Rudger was about to say good-bye and leave.[Come to think of it, I heard some interesting news recently.]\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201dRudger felt anxious at the sudden remark. Why was she suddenly talking about interesting news at this time?[You said you had a subordinate]]The word subordinate flashed Sedina Rosen across Rudger\u2019s mind.[I mean, that\u2019s weird. The John Doe who claimed to be comfortable alone, has a subordinate? A third order, too?]Esmeralda was suspicious and asked him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 90": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Academy\u2019s Undercover ProfessorCH 90Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayC90: First Order Esmeralda (2)This chapter was sponsored by Misheru Hoshizora , Envy , Chrisoun and Punten . Thank you for your generosity.Rudger pondered inside. Did Esmeralda just ask this question without thinking?No. This is obviously a questionable remark about him.If it\u2019s not an illusion, it feels like the temperature has risen a few degrees around him. No, it was actually going up.[Tell me. What made you do that?]The question was simple, but the hidden meaning was not simple.The scorching heat surged, and then it began to take shape. At first, it was as big as a fist, but it was already encroaching on his surroundings, overflowing with tentacles made of flames.Ordinary people would have stuttered in embarrassment, or felt that their life was in danger and reflexively counterattacked because it was more important to live somehow than to die.That\u2019s a natural response.\u2018But not like that.\u2019Rudger suppressed his body, which was about to react on its own.Even though the rising heat bothered him, he stared silently at the flames without changing his breath.\u201cYou talk as if you know me very well.\u201d[What?]Provocative remarks are nothing short of crazy in this situation. If anyone had watched this scene, they might have asked why but Rudger did not hesitate.There was no need to do that.\u201cYou asked for help first, and then made your own conclusions. Do I seem weak because I stayed still after infiltrating Theon?\u201dEsmeralda took a step back at his remark.[What? You did something you won\u2019t usually do in the first place]]\u201cI always do my best depending on my identity and now I\u2019m a new teacher of Theon, Rudger Chelici. What would it look like if such a teacher didn\u2019t have an assistant?\u201d[\u2026So you choose a Third Order?]\u201cI just decided that this is better than having a guy who doesn\u2019t know anything. I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m trying to convince you.\u201dRudger was blatantly annoyed and said flatly that there was no need for explanation. Rather, if he tried to persuade her about why he acted like this in this situation, he could have raised doubts from the other party.The First Orders all had great skills but at the same time, they were all out of their minds. John Doe, Victor Dreadful, whom he just indirectly encountered, and Esmeralda in front of him were all the same.\u2018Being calm and rational with them would backfire.\u2019It was better to act annoyed to clear the other party\u2019s doubts and he made the right decision because the tentacles of the flame quickly melted into the air.[Just kidding. I was just joking, but aren\u2019t you overreacting?]\u201cEsmeralda, no matter what, it\u2019s clear that you\u2019re suspicious of my loyalty.\u201d[Okay, I\u2019m sorry. You\u2019re right. You didn\u2019t talk to anyone but Zero Order. Don\u2019t be angry, instead, I\u2019ll tell you a piece of good news.]\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d[Zero\u2019s order will visit to check our condition soon. I\u2019m serious.]When the name Zero Order came out, Rudger calmed down.\u201c\u2026\u2026I\u2019ll let it slide this time. However, keep this in mind. If you do something like this again\u2026\u201dRudger opened his eyes sharply and glared at the flames. No, the \u201cEsmeralda\u201d hidden in them.\u201cThen one of us will have to die.\u201d[Yes, yes. All right.]She took him lightly as if she was not listening, but if Esmeralda was talking like that, it was clear that the threat worked.[All right. Anyway, I\u2019m done with the message, so I\u2019m leaving. It\u2019s annoying to have a setback in the plan, but it can\u2019t be helped.]\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dRudger didn\u2019t respond to the monologue and left immediately.Esmeralda stared at the back of Rudger for some time but she lost interest quickly and the flame disappeared.At the entrance of the Fantasy Forest, darkness fell again.* * *\u2018I almost got in trouble.\u2019After leaving the Fantasy Forest, I wiped the cold sweat running down my forehead. My body was still tense because I barely escaped the situation with desperate acting a while ago.\u2018I\u2019m glad the other person stepped down, after pretending to be strong.\u2019That\u2019s how people in secret organizations in the underworld are. When you look weak or try to solve something with words, it looks ridiculous, especially in the eyes of executives.In such a situation, it is more effective to be aggressive. In fact, Esmeralda rolled up her tail and stepped back.\u2018Even so, it was dangerous. If I had any strange reaction there, she would have tried to kill me right away.\u2019At least until I got angry, Esmeralda\u2019s reaction was genuine, she was really going to kill me but it\u2019s good that we didn\u2019t fight otherwise it would\u2019ve been dangerous.The president is looking for suspicious people and has her eyes on him. What would\u2019ve happened if he would\u2019ve fought at the entrance of the Fantasy Forest in the middle of the night?Considering Esmeralda\u2019s level, she\u2019s not someone that could be defeated easily. The flames she deals with, seemed enough to burn the forest in an instant.\u2018Fortunately, nothing happened.\u2019It was fortunate that he knew John Doe character in advance.Although he has a filthy personality and is unbending against the other First Orders, he swore allegiance to the Zero Order, the leader of the Black Dawn.Even after killing the lower orders of the Black Dawn, the reason he remained in place was perhaps because he was favored by Zero Order.\u2019I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t get caught. And I got a clue about the first order, Esmeralda.\u2019First order Esmeralda.Gender is female. Age is still difficult to guess, but for now, it was clear that she was young.But the most important thing is her ability. The flame she used a while ago and the heat that quickly expanded.I noticed it from the moment I first felt her presence in the Fantasy Forest, but Esmeralda was a spirit warrior, a powerful elementalist who wields a spirit of flame that is at least at the advanced level.\u2018The fact that she can send her voice through her spirit means the spirit is very capable.\u2019In that case the number of suspects is reduced greatly. I can suspect people who specialize in spirits in the whole of Theon.\u2018The first thing I should suspect is the Elemental Studies teachers.\u2019From 1st grade to 5th grade, there are a total of five teachers. However, as far as their skills are concerned, they are all first-class without any doubt.Considering that she\u2019s a First Order it was very likely that she infiltrated Theon as a teacher.\u2018But that doesn\u2019t exclude the students.\u2019Rather, if you hide your identity, hiding among students it\u2019s much more likely to go unnoticed.Even if it was limited to female students among the students who were in the spirit studies class, the number would be quite high.However, if I look around for fire spirits, the range will narrow enough to count them on my hand.She contacted me when I came to see the test in the Fantasy Forest. That means that someone who can move freely at that time or someone who was on the scene must likely be the First Order.\u2019The scope has been narrowed further.In the case of teachers, he can focus on those who did not give tests or did not go to work. However, he can\u2019t go to them one by one and ask them where and what they did that day.\u2018But it\u2019s not like there\u2019s no way out.\u2019The first test is over.Although there are four tests in a semester, the first test is of course meaningful. Theon gives small gifts to those who took the test for the first time, saying that they worked hard.Students are given a total of three days off and the same is true of teachers.A welcoming party for new teachers, which should have been held at the entrance ceremony, will be held after the first test.\u2018Only after giving the first test and evaluating the students could one say that he took the first step as a teacher.\u2019The welcoming party held at the beginning of each year will be attended by all teachers of Theon, and outsiders who donate a huge amount of money to Theon will also come.It\u2019s kind of a banquet that\u2019s held in a large city near Theon and since there\u2019s only one city near Theon.\u2018A banquet in Leathervelk.\u2019He was going to attend and find the First Order.\u2018And what Esmeralda said at the end.\u2019Zero Order, founder of the Black Dawn Society will visit soon. Will Rudger be able to fool him?* * *Whoo.In a dark room the black shadow let out a small sigh. It was Esmeralda, who ended her meeting John Doe.\u201cGreat job.\u201dA small spark came to her side when she said so. It was small enough and looked cute, but with the power it contained and the true identity of the embers, no one would call it cute.The embers flickered a little, and then disappeared as if they were extinguished. Esmeralda got up and looked out her window.She is standing in a small research building and beyond the window, Fantasy Forest, one of the three major forests of Theon could be seen.It\u2019s a forest so huge that it\u2019s hard to see it at a glance, even inside Theon and it\u2019s not completely clear what\u2019s inside.As she gazed carefully at the entrance to the forest, she saw someone slowly walking out.Esmeralda narrowed her eyes. Even with the mana-enhanced vision, only the shape could be vaguely recognized.\u201cJohn Doe.\u201dThe man disappeared through the darkness with leisurely steps. It seems that he is just walking normally, but he is assimilated with the surrounding landscape and cannot be seen properly. Indeed, he deserved to be called a First Order like her.\u201cYou came here and did your best as a teacher without doing anything, so I wondered what you were thinking.\u2019She was anxious that he might have betrayed the organization, but she soon shook her head and shook off the idea. John Doe has the highest loyalty to the organization.Still, the reason she deliberately tested him is because he has drawn attention and his recent behavior has been excessive.\u2018I thought you\u2019d be very quiet because you said you\u2019d sneak in as a teacher, but it was unexpected.\u2019Esmeralda doesn\u2019t know exactly how John Doe handles things. She knew he\u2019s specialized in disguise and infiltration, but everything else is a secret. However, considering that he has not failed in his duties so far, his skills must have been verified.He tested him to find out his skills, because the existence of John Doe is different compared to the other First Orders.\u2018Those eyes. Even with my flame right in front of his nose, he didn\u2019t feel scared at all.\u2019John Doe shot back rather strongly, even in a situation where he might\u2019ve been burned to death by the Fire Spirit she was controlling.He didn\u2019t have any fear at all.It wasn\u2019t a bluff because he had enough power to respond to her attack. His attitude in the Fantasy Forest, as well as his new form of magic that Rudger Chelici showed were new to her.\u2018John Doe is a wizard of considerable ability. Maybe he\u2019s stronger than I vaguely guessed.\u2019He said he was wary of the president, but she didn\u2019t know if that was true or he just wanted his acting to be perfect.She thought it was the latter. Indeed, she could see why Zero\u2019s Order supported this man. He is loyal without forming factions, and has outstanding skills.It is understandable that John Doe infiltration played a major role.\u2018Tsk. I tested him, but I couldn\u2019t find anything.\u2019She had to take care of herself before she cared about John Doe.\u2018Come to think of it, I heard there\u2019s a banquet this time.\u2019She thought that she had to attend and was annoyed.Esmeralda was not very fond of such formalities.\u2018I should still go.\u2019The main role will be played by someone other than her anyway.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 91": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Academy\u2019s Undercover ProfessorCH 91Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayC91: Celebration (1)Chapter sponsored by mystichead, thank you for you support.Recently, Rene has been experiencing a series of things that made her lose hair.The arguments with the aristocratic students, the setback in class because of her non-attribute magic and the men who are interested in her and bother her.There were fun and happy things, but there were more things that she didn\u2019t like.It was the same now.Now that the first test was over, Theon students were taking a break to make the most of their few free classes.Some were already studying because their pride was hurt when they failed the test but it was none of Rene\u2019s business. She seemed to have done well on this test no matter how much she thought about it.\u2018I was going to take a break.\u2019The older students also agreed that it would be difficult to rest after this so if she was going to rest she should rest now. Rene agreed with them and tried to take a break.\u2018Why am I here\u2026\u2026.\u2019She lifted her slightly bowed head and looked at the man sitting comfortably opposite her.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201dFreuden Ulburg asked if he felt her gaze.Looking at him again, he is a very handsome young man. The eldest son of Ulburg and the man who will be the next leader of the Duke family was sitting face to face with her now. They were also eating alone in a small vacant lot where people do not visit.\u2018How did this happen?\u2019Rene was dizzy from the splendid taste of the food in her mouth and the gap between them.Obviously, they\u2019ve met and eaten like this before but she thought it was just Freuden pity because her lunch fell on the floor.I thought this would never happen again after that\u2026\u2026.\u2018We just ran into each other on the street.\u2019At that time, she was looking for a place to eat while holding a lunch box, thinking that she should be especially careful. However, she didn\u2019t really want to go to the student restaurant.She didn\u2019t have any friends to eat with, and going to a place where many people gather would attract too much attention.How could she eat peacefully when people are staring at her?In such a situation the food she ate made her stomach feel stuffy. But isn\u2019t it too much to eat in the bathroom?She doesn\u2019t want the rumor that she doesn\u2019t have friends and eats alone in the bathroom to spread, that\u2019s why she came outside.Who knew she would run into Freuden here?Maybe he was on his way to eat, too, since he was moving alone with a lunch basket.\u201cAre you going to eat?\u201d\u201cWhat? Oh, yes.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026Let\u2019s eat together.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dThere was no way she could refuse so Rene eventually ended up eating with Freuden, and that\u2019s the situation right now.\u2018Looking back, it\u2019s a really fancy meal.\u2019Looking at the Freuden lunch box, Rene realized how terrible the lunch box she had packed was. As she\u2019s pressed for money, all she\u2019s going to eat is steamed potatoes and some vegetables. Her reality was that she could not even dream of meat.While she was depressed, meat was piled up on her lunchbox.\u201cOh, senior?\u201d\u201cEat more.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cCome to think of it, mine has too much meat.\u201dFreuden said so and concentrated on the meal again.Rene thought about whether to reject this or not, but she decided to eat it because she thought it would be a waste to throw it away.\u2018More than that, it\u2019s amazing.\u2019While eating the delicious meat, Rene had no choice but to wonder.\u2018I think senior brought more food than before. Who was he trying to give it to?\u2019Maybe he made an appointment with someone, but he went with her instead because they met by coincidence.Is it good luck or bad luck?Rene decided not to dwell on it.\u201cIt\u2019s delicious.\u201dIt\u2019s been a while since she had meat.* * *It was so awkward, but the delicious meal was over.\u201cThen, I\u2019ll go now.\u201dFreuden stood up saying that he had to take care of the garden.At least for this moment, he didn\u2019t seem to want to be disturbed by anyone, so she nodded her head saying she enjoyed the meal and left.\u2018I think senior is a good person.\u2019She didn\u2019t think deeply about why Freuden was nice to her, She thought Freuden was just a good person.\u2018Because he didn\u2019t seem to have any bad intentions.\u2019He did not discriminate against her because she was commoner, and it was Freuden who even saved her when she was in danger. For some,Freuden may seem like a scary villain, but at least Rene didn\u2019t think so. She had a feeling that he was a good person.Rene had a special sense of recognizing the hostility or danger of others toward her. It\u2019s not magical, it\u2019s just a vague feeling, but she quite trusted this feeling of hers.In fact, this sense of hers was right almost every time.The atmosphere of those who approached her because they were attracted by her appearance and those who helped her with her pure good intentions were different.It was the same when I came to Theon. Jealousy, contempt, possessiveness, etc. all sorts of different emotions were directed at her, and Rene avoided them as much as possible.There was darkness behind the students who approached her and said they were the same commoners, and the aristocrats who approached with a friendly smile so Rene didn\u2019t get along with other people carelessly because she couldn\u2019t.She knew what was behind their smiles but Freuden was different, that\u2019s why Rene joined him and ate together. Otherwise she would\u2019ve rejected his suggestion.\u2018There aren\u2019t many people like this, it\u2019s fascinating.\u2019Currently, there are only a handful of people who do not have any ill will toward Rene in Theon.Among them, if she had to pick a representative person, there was Freuden Ulburg, whom she had a meal with a while ago.\u2018There is also senior Erendir and\u2026\u2026.\u2019The last thing that comes to mind is the figure of Rudger who gave her a book about non-attribute magic.\u2018Mr. Rudger Chelici\u2026\u2026.\u2019Rudger\u2019s sharp gaze towards her seemed to be filled with dissatisfaction in everything, but Rene knew that he was not hostile towards her. Rather he had goodwill that it was strangely different from others. He doesn\u2019t show his affection for her, but rather a slightly darker side.Rene felt that it was sorry or guilt.\u2018Why?\u2019She couldn\u2019t be sure, but it just looked like it.\u201cOh, my.\u201dRene rubbed her eyes with her hands. She didn\u2019t know if it was an illusion but Rene felt itchy around her eyelids these days.A person stood silently in front of Rene, who rubbed her eyes like that and looked straight ahead again.\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dShe was so startled that she didn\u2019t even scream.The man in front of her smiled and greeted her, regardless of her condition.\u201cHi, you\u2019re Rene, right?\u201d\u201cOh, yes, but who are you?\u201dHe was wearing the same student uniform as her but looking at his name tag it said second grade.He was a handsome man with a big smile and his slightly scarlet hair was tied in a tail. His slightly open squint seemed to be very nice, but Rene was under the impression that he was a little like a snake.That meant that he must have a motive to approach her but Rene didn\u2019t run away because she didn\u2019t feel any hostility from him. Instead she felt extreme curiosity from the man in front of her.\u201cI recently wondered what Freuden was doing alone.\u201d\u201cOh, are you a friend of senior Freuden?\u201d\u201cSenior?\u201dWas it unexpected that she called him senior Freuden senior without any hesitation?The squinty man opened his eyes slightly, and soon giggled.\u201cYes, we\u2019re friends. My name is Henry Presto, a friend of Freudian. Nice to meet you.\u201d\u201cMy name is Rene.\u201d\u201cYes, I already know that.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t look so wary. I was just amazed that my friend Freuden, who has always been lonely, packed a lunch box and moved to meet someone in person on a holiday. Have you two met before?\u201d\u201cWell, how do you\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cI have my ways.\u201dRene realized that Henry was an extraordinary man. He doesn\u2019t have any hostility towards her, but she was sure that he is dangerous. He knows things that other people don\u2019t know.\u201cHa ha. You don\u2019t have to be so wary.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Yes.\u201dEven if he said that, Rene stared at him with a disapproving gaze.Henry scratched his cheek with a smile, thinking he had made a mistake from the beginning.\u201cWell, am I being suspected? Then, I will give you good information as an apology.\u201d\u201cGood information?\u201d\u201cYes, good information. You\u2019re having a hard time these days, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201dLine reacted and regretted it later. She had to pretend she didn\u2019t, but he was so right on the point that she revealed it.\u201cAh, it\u2019s not.\u201d\u201cEveryone is the same. Other students need money, so they work a lot of part-time jobs here and there or go to the commission board and get a commission.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cBut, to be honest, accepting a request is cumbersome, and you can\u2019t tell which is dangerous and which is not. So, the most stable thing is to make a living by doing chores inside Theon.\u201dThat\u2019s true.In fact, Lynne was recently looking for a bunch of people to make money.\u201cI know a lot about the things that are convenient and make a lot of money. Honey information that other students do not know. I can tell you that.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 Aren\u2019t you a senior?\u201d\u201cYes, I am but I know a lot about how things work in Theon. What do you think?\u201dRene was quite suspicious of Henry\u2019s sudden offer. Normally, she wouldn\u2019t have listened to it, but things were different now because she was actually really short of money.Henry\u2019s offer came at the right time, moreover he had no hostility towards her.\u201cWhy are you telling me this? We met for the first time today.\u201d\u201cTo be honest, is it because of curiosity.\u201d\u201cCuriosity\u201d?\u201cIt was amazing that Freuden had a meal with a commoner girl.\u201d\u201cIs that amazing? I think it\u2019s because the senior is a good person.\u201d\u201cWho\u2019s good? Freudian? Hahahaha!\u201dHenry laughed out loud as if he had heard something funny.\u201cWhy are you laughing?\u201d\u201cOh, yeah, that\u2019s right. Freuden is a good man. That\u2019s how I felt after watching Freuden for a long time. Anyway, so I\u2019m kind of interested in you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dWhy does the word \u201cinterest\u201d make my heart flutter instead of pounding in my chest?\u201cSo I\u2019m going to help. It won\u2019t be bad for you either. If you listen to what\u2019s going on, you\u2019ll be tempted too. The work is easy, and the pay is high.\u201dThe pay is high? Line\u2019s ears pricked and moved.\u201cWhat do you think? Are you interested?\u201d\u201c\u2026 \u2026 Let\u2019s hear it first.\u201d\u201cYou will not regret it.\u201d* * *A large banquet hall.One by one, guests entered the banquet hall where beautiful light flowed out. All of them were high-ranking people dressed in luxurious clothes.\u201cHey, isn\u2019t this Senator Thomas?\u201d\u201cOh, Count Gerald, long time no see. You\u2019re still alive.\u201d\u201cHa ha. How could I possibly miss this.\u201dInside the colorful and clean banquet hall, well-dressed people gathered to chat.\u2018Wow.\u2019Classical music, a chandelier sparkling in vermilion along with the polished marble floor to the dining table around made Rene express her admiration on the inside.It was the first time in her life that she had come to such a place.The reason why she came here was simple. It was all thanks to Henry\u2019s recommendation.He said \u2018I just heard of a part-time job where you only need to carry plates at a party!\u2019But how in the world was this a party?\u2019But this is way beyond common sense. This kind of job is so uncomfortable.\u2019Rene swallowed the complaint inwardly. She feels like she\u2019s been tricked by Henry.\u2018Still, the pay is great.\u2019Whatever it is, there\u2019s really not much to do, and it\u2019s a simple part-time job where you just have to stand still. In fact, there were several other students of Theon besides her.\u2018What kind of party is being held here?\u2019It may not be once or twice that the upper class of society is having parties, but Line guessed that this party was not a usual one.The door of the banquet hall opened and new guests came in.\u201cOh, the main characters are finally here.\u201d\u201cAre they the newly appointed teachers?\u201dFollowing the crowd\u2019s gaze, Line turned and looked at the entrance. Familiar faces were seen through the wide open door.\u2018Oh, it\u2019s teacher Selina.\u2019Dressed in an unusually colorful dress, she was entering the banquet hall with a face full of pressure. Next to her, teacher Merida escorts her in a purple dress with a deep back.In addition, other teachers appeared one by one.There was Chris Benimore and teacher Bruno, all of them were new teachers.\u201cOh? Then\u2026\u2026.\u2019Rene\u2019s eyes naturally headed for the entrance of the banquet hall, which was wide open. There was one person who hadn\u2019t come yet.Thump.The sound of shoes knocking on the marble floor passed through the banquet hall. It\u2019s not just an illusion that the normal steps sound unusually loud only when people are buried in their own noise.\u201c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u201dThere is a moment of silence in the banquet hall. Even the soft sound of the instruments remained silent for a moment.All eyes turned to the entrance.\u201cWhoa.\u201dThere was a man coming into the banquet hall. He was wearing a long black tailcoat tailored to the dress code, a black coat over his shoulder and held a cane in one hand. Unlike usual, his bangs were neatly pulled back.\u201cRudger Chelici.\u201dThe man who received everyone\u2019s attention glanced over the banquet hall with an emotionless look.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 92": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Academy\u2019s Undercover ProfessorCH 92Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayC92: Celebration (2)Another chapter sponsored by mystichead . Thank you for you support.As he entered the banquet held to celebrate the appointment of Theon\u2019s new teacher gazes flew over him like arrows.\u2018There are a lot of people.\u2019I was embarrassed for a moment because the eyes were full of burdensome attention, but I kept my calm appearance and headed inside.Rather, when it comes to banquet halls, don\u2019t they usually play music to maintain a soft atmosphere? Why are they staying still?\u2018Hasn\u2019t the party started yet?\u2019With that in mind, I leaned my back against one of the walls to get a full view of the banquet hall.In an instant, the stopped time began to flow again. The people who were talking to each other continued the conversation from a while ago, and some of them rolled their eyes and burst into laughter as if they were having fun.However, the basis of such behavior was full of pretense that was hard to hide. I can even feel the illusion that it flows out and spreads around like a black fog.\u2018They\u2019re not talking to each other, they\u2019re watching someone else.\u2019Especially me.If I said this, I might seem paranoid but there\u2019s no way that I, who is sensitive to such gazes, would not know. Most of the people were either looking sideways at me, or glaring at me.I could fully guess why.\u2018This banquet is held with the purpose of making relationships.\u2019Theon\u2019s new teachers are young and have excellent magical skills, so they think that it would be good to make a relationship with them, even a little.Indeed, as I was watching the people in the banquet hall began to move.\u201cOh, Miss Selina. Good to meet you. I\u2019m a member of the House of Representatives, Charles.\u201d\u201cAre you Ms. Merylda? My name is Walt Miller, a director of a magic potion manufacturing company. Are you interested?\u201d\u201cOh. Count Chris Benimore. As rumored, you are really handsome.\u201dI checked the faces of the people in this banquet hall.All of them were rich and noble people, city councilors, aristocrats, wealthy businessmen, etc.\u2018All of them are Theon supporters.\u2019Theon needs a huge budget for operations like magic research, class materials, special materials, all kinds of infrastructure, etc.Considering the cost of raising a single wizard, the amount of money spent at the academy that trains a large number of elite wizards every year is bound to be astronomical.My starting salary as a new teacher right now made my mouth water. Considering other miscellaneous expenses, it would be difficult to imagine the detailed amount.\u2018It is difficult for the Theon Academy to cover the money on its own.\u2019Theon is not an international bank, and money cannot be printed and distributed like a factory.In order to invest a huge amount of money, it is inevitable to receive external support and all the people here smell of money.There are people who need money and people with money but who want to get something more and in this hall transactions that benefit both parties are made.\u2018That\u2019s why Theon belongs to the Empire, but it is not purely part of the Empire.\u2019All kinds of countries have invested in Theon. Not only the Exilion Empire, but also Delike, Queoden, Utah, Bretus, Fatima, etc.And even the huge capitalists without borders, regardless of country.It wouldn\u2019t be unusual for them to put a face stamp on talented people who might make a name for themselves in the future. This is a kind of annual event that is held to the point that it is tiresome to ask why. It is a place to build personal connections under the pretext of congratulating the new teachers.As I watched the desire wriggle, someone approached me.\u201cNice to meet you. Are you Professor Rudger Chelici?\u201dI replied with a slight nod.\u201cYes, but.\u201d\u201cNice to meet you. I\u2019m Count Deckers, one of Theon\u2019s supporters.\u201dI wondered why he didn\u2019t move until now, but he was measuring me.When Count Deckers stepped forward first, people who were only looking at him began to move one by one. Once someone started it was easy for others to move. I wasn\u2019t happy with the situation.\u201cWhat should I do? If I leave it like this, things will become messy.\u2019I\u2019m here not to have a formal conversation with strangers. I came with the intention of finding the First Order of the Black Dawn Society hiding in the banquet hall.The process had to be natural and I didn\u2019t want anyone to disturb me, but from the start I got tangled up by these people before I could even start.If this is the case, I have no choice but to push myself a little harder.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201dI spoke firmly to Count Deckers, who spoke to me with a heavy air.\u201cI don\u2019t feel like talking to anyone right now.\u201d\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d\u201cI said, I\u2019d appreciate it if you could step aside for a while.\u201dMy tone sounded like I didn\u2019t even want to come here.As I said it, narrowing my eyes, Count Deckers swallowed his saliva, and then hurriedly nodded his head.\u201cI\u2019m sorry I wasted your time.\u201dI\u2019m glad you\u2019re quick-witted and so were the people around him.When Count Deckers left without doing anything, those who were watching from a few feet away stepped back.They are clearly inferior to the Count Deckers and since he had not been able to speak with me they gave up.\u201cI think the first round is over.\u201dThe problem is, there are many people who haven\u2019t given up yet.I don\u2019t know exactly who Count Deckers is, but considering his position, he must have been above average among those gathered at this banquet hall.The fact that there are people who don\u2019t give up giving me persistent eyes when such a person has stepped down naturally proves that their level is high.\u2018I\u2019m sure they\u2019re pretty annoying people.\u2019I\u2019m not happy if such people come forward and talk to me. As I was thinking about how to solve this, I saw a woman with pink hair and a pink dress.It was teacher Selina who was embarrassed by a young man\u2019s blatant approach.Hmm. Maybe.I pulled my back from the wall and walked toward teacher Selina. Some people see me moving and look at me with curious eyes but I lightly ignored them.Someone plucked up the courage to try to talk to me in the middle, but I blocked all their actions by shaking my hand lightly.\u201cSelina, how about having a drink with me? I know a good place.\u201d\u201cEh, hehe. I\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t really like unfamiliar places\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cWhy are you refusing? It\u2019s a place where it\u2019s hard for ordinary people to go.\u201d\u201cOh, no. I mean, it\u2019s\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u201dAs I stepped up and spoke, the person who was flirting with Selina teacher looked this way.\u201cWhat is this?\u201dHe distorted his face with irritation, perhaps because he thought he was disturbed.I stared at him in silence.\u2018He\u2019s in his late 20\u2019s, clothing that looks luxurious, a bad posture with one leg without proper standing and a self-conceited, defiant look.\u2019I looked around.All the guys who were after Selina have gone awayAlthough Selina is a commoner, she is capable enough to become a teacher of Theon at a young age. In addition with her striking beauty and a good personality she must have been quite fascinating for people seeking personal connections,Rather, it would be easier to approach her because she was a commoner rather than aristocrat.\u2018It sounds like he\u2019s a high-ranking noble.\u2019His family is so strong that even small and medium-sized aristocrats can\u2019t speak but that doesn\u2019t concern me.\u201cIt\u2019s rude to trouble a lady.\u201d\u201cOh, so who are you?\u201dThen Selina looked back at me and opened her eyes wide.\u201cTeacher Rudger!\u201d\u201d Rudger? Who\u2019s that?\u201dHe doesn\u2019t recognize me.Seeing that he was saying that sincerely rather than deliberately, I was very embarrassed. It was at the moment I was thinking about whether I should introduce myself as a new teacher of Theon. A man who looked old among the crowd rushed up, approached the man in front of me and whispered something in his ear.He is dressed for the party but I could tell he is a wizard. Maybe he\u2019s telling me who I am.\u201cSo what?\u201dWith that intention in mind, the man let out a sigh as if it was ridiculous.\u201cOh, really. Maybe it\u2019s because he\u2019s a fallen aristocrat, but there\u2019s nothing in his head.\u201dThe words made the faces of the nobles watching the situation cold. However, some people who knew about this man were showing signs of resignation as if they knew it would happen. Judging by that reaction alone, it must not have been the first time he spoke such nonsense.\u201cMy name is Ivan Luke, have you heard of it? Don\u2019t you know Luke? When it comes to Luke\u2019s, it\u2019s a name even the back alley beggars have heard of.\u201dI know the name Luke well. Founded by Theodore Luke, Luke is one of the richest conglomerates in the empire. Luke\u2019s has spread its influence throughout the empire to such an extent that it is said to reach out to any field where money exists. Naturally, as a businessman, the name Luke could never be taken lightly.Above all Luke is the owner of Kunst, which hosts the upcoming auction. Given that Ivan\u2019s last name is Luke, he is probably the descendent of Theodore Luke, the founder of Luke\u2019s company.Thinking that he was the second generation of a rich conglomerate, I immediately understood the person in front of me.\u201cA fallen noble like you is not someone who should make eye contact and talk with others in this place.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cIf you understand, get out of my way I\u2019ll let you off the hook.\u201dThis is a bothersome situation. I just came in with the intention of removing the flies that were bothering Selina.Apparently, the person in cause was a descendant of Luke. It seems that while I was trying to remove some flies I pocked a beehive.Behind my back, Selina\u2019s slender hands were shaking as she held my sleeve.If I step down from here, that jerk will try to force Selina to go with him.\u2018\u2026\u2026I can\u2019t help it.\u2019\u201cHey, get out of the way\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201dI said, staring at Ivan with unwavering eyes.\u201cMs. Selina has a prior contract with me first.\u201dMy face didn\u2019t change while I lied.\u201cIsn\u2019t that so? Teacher Selina.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201dPerhaps reading something in that action, she nodded hastily.\u201cYes, yes, that\u2019s right.\u201dIvan Luke\u2019s face was horribly distorted.\u201cHey, are you kidding me?\u201d\u201cDo I look like I\u2019m kidding?\u201d\u201cWhat? Ha. You\u2019re a funny guy. Just because you\u2019re a Theon teacher or something, do you think I\u2019m going to quit?\u201dIvan strode up to me, saying so then he raised his right hand and tried to push my shoulder but he couldn\u2019t because I was faster and grabbed his wrist.\u201cYou\u2026What are you doing? Aren\u2019t you going to let go of my hand?\u201d\u201cIf you say so, I\u2019ll give you the same treatment.\u201dI said and increased the strength of my grip on his wrist.\u201cDid you think I\u2019d step down just because you\u2019re a member of the Luke family?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Let go of me!\u201dIvan Luke opened his eyes to the intense pressure on his wrist and tried to shake off his arm.\u2018Wow, what kind of power is that?\u2019His hand doesn\u2019t budge. As such, Rudger\u2019s grip was stronger than he could have imagined.Evan, who thought that the wizards were a group of people who only read books, was shocked.\u201cHey, aren\u2019t you going to let this go? You don\u2019t know who I am?! Do you want to lose your teaching job right now?!\u201d\u201cIf you can.\u201dThere was a slight shadow on Rudger\u2019s face as he looked down at him.\u201cTry it.\u201d\u201cThis, this\u2026!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s stop there.\u201dIt was Ivan\u2019s attendant who intervened between Rudger and Ivan. Rudger stared at him and looked around with a sidelong glance.Before he knew it, security guards stood around him as if they were surrounding Ivan. The attendant stared at Rudger with a gloomy gaze.\u201cStop there and let go of that hand. Otherwise\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cOtherwise, what do you intend to do?\u201dRudger asked back in a blunt voice.The moment the attendant was about to say that he would regret it his voice didn\u2019t come out properly. He gulped and felt a cold sweat running over his forehead.\u2018This guy. He\u2019s out of the ordinary.\u2019He thought he would win if they fought. Although Rudger is a teacher at Theon he is a professional wizard directly employed by Luke.Now he is bowing his head to a kid, who is much younger than him, and he is constantly swearing, but his skills are inferior and he can\u2019t do anything.\u2018This look. This spirit. I feel like my bones are freezing even though I\u2019m simply facing him. Is he really a new teacher?\u2019The aide changed his mind when he saw Evan huffing while trying to step back. He couldn\u2019t back down from here.Even if Ivan Luke\u2019s is a jerk, he is the chairman\u2019s only blood. Although Ivan does not have the ability to inherit his legacy, and the President also did not show much affection for Ivan, he was still treated like a blood relative. That\u2019s why he was looking after him.The three bodyguards were even made up of members of the Knights Academy.\u2018Yeah, we won\u2019t lose.\u2019However, the only thing that bothered him is that the location is not good. If there was a quarrel on a dark road with no one around, he could just deal with it quietly, but this a banquet hall full of people.All sorts of distinguished guests were watching the situation with interest.\u2018Although it is said that the character of the master has already spread throughout the society, if we try to suppress the situation here with force, the image of the group will be severely damaged.\u2019It\u2019s embarrassing and annoying, but in the current situation, he had to deal with it as best he could.The assistant finished his calculations and started talking.\u201cLet\u2019s stop here. If we start fighting in this location we\u2019ll hurt other people.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dAs the assistant said as gently as possible, Rudger let go of Ivan\u2019s hand. Barely freed, Ivan grabbed his throbbing wrist and licked his lips.\u201cHey, you bloody fallen aristocrat\u2026\u2026!\u201d\u201cYoung master, let\u2019s stop here. There are a lot of eyes on us right now.\u201dThe aide intended to end the situation as much as possible before Ivan did anything but when he tried to persuade him to stop Ivan slapped him on the cheek with all his might.\u201cHey, you punk. I told you to call me Director.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026I\u2019m sorry, Director.\u201d\u201cAnd, uh? My arm. Can\u2019t you see this? You want me to step down after all this? Do you want to get fired?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026No.\u201dSuddenly, the atmosphere began to take a strange turn. The assistant sighed inwardly as he saw Ivan\u2019s bloodshot eyes.It seemed that the situation could no longer be solved through conversation.\u201cDo you think I should just let it slide in front of people like this? Huh? Answer me.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cNo, right? Right?Ivan glanced at Rudger with eyes full of hostility.\u201cHey, you\u2019re done. I\u2019ll make sure you\u2019re fired on the spot. You know what? I keep my word.\u201dIvan Luke is a director of the Luke family, and under the protection of the chairman, he is a troublemaker, but the weight of his power was never light.It was nothing to cut a new teacher if Luke, who gives Theon a huge amount of funding every year, was determined to put pressure on it.Rudger, who was watching the scene from beginning to end, wondered what was going on. Originally, he should have quietly left his seat and started searching for the First Order but Ivan ruined his plans.\u2018There are a lot of eyes around, but it doesn\u2019t seem like anyone will stop me.\u2019Rudger was just thinking about how to do this when someone intervened.\u201c\u2026\u2026President?\u201dTheon President and genius wizard Elisa Willow wearing a black dress full of long frills appeared naturally at the breathtaking scene with an innocent smile.\u2018Are you here to help me?\u2019When Rudger had a curious expectation, Ivan Luke was already annoyed and when a new interrupter appeared, he stared at Elisa with an expression as if he wanted to eat her alive.\u201cWho are you?\u201d\u201cMe? I\u2019m the president of Theon\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dIvan looked at Elisa slightly bewildered. He\u2019s heard of Theon president, but it\u2019s the first time he actually saw her, so he didn\u2019t recognize her right away.A young woman like this is the president? Ivan rather thought it was good.\u201cHow did you educate your teachers?\u201d\u201cEducation? What education?\u201d\u201cThat fallen aristocrat has used violence against me!\u201dPeople who watched the situation would not have called it violence, but Ivan believed he was a victim.Elisa asked Ivan again, still smiling.\u201cSo?\u201d\u201cSo what? Fire him right now. If you want to continue to be sponsored by Luke, you\u2019d better.\u201d\u201cLuke? Ahhhhhhhhh. You were the son of Chairman Luke.\u201dAs if Elisa understood, she clapped her hands and nodded.Ivan smiled around, thinking that someone he can communicate with has come.\u201dHowever, Elisha\u2019s following words made his face collapse.\u201cSo?\u201d\u201cHuh? Didn\u2019t you hear me now? Luke\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cThe owner of Luke\u2019s company is Chairman Theodore, right? So why is it that you decided that on your own?\u201d\u201cAlthough I am a director, I am the only son of President Theodore, you know? I have enough power to decide.\u201d\u201cOh, really? So have you discussed all this with your father?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe remark left Ivan speechless.There is no way that he could have talked with his father since he got angry and shouted without thinking.\u201cOh, my father would feel the same way. I\u2019m his son. Don\u2019t you know that?\u201d\u201cOh, really? That\u2019s a relief.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean by relief?\u201d\u201cThe chairman just happened to be here!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026What?\u201dIvan\u2019s face turned stupid.The chairman is here? No, it can\u2019t be.\u201cA lie like that won\u2019t work\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be better to see for yourself if I lied or not?\u201dElisha said so, and moved slightly aside.Ivan was able to find a person spreading a strong presence beyond the crowd obscured by Elisa.A white-haired old man was standing on his cane and staring at him.\u201cHuh!\u201dIvan\u2019s face was as pale as a sheet of white paper. He was running wild without knowing the meaning of the word \u2018afraid\u2019, but he couldn\u2019t stand up to his father.\u201cOh, father?\u201d\u201cYou useless fellow, I told you to go and build a network, but what are you doing?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not it\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cStop making excuses. It was troublesome that I entrusted this task to an idiot like you.\u201dChairman Theodore Luke stared at Ivan angrily and bowed his head toward Elisa.\u201cSorry, President Elisa. My stupid son did this on his own.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine. On the contrary, there are not many people who dare to step forward like that to me these days, so it felt a little fresh.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Thank you for saying that.\u201dTheodore\u2019s gaze soon turned to Rudger.He was quite displeased with the situation. Even if Ivan made a mistake in the first place, there was no way he would have been able to admire a man who almost had a fight with his son.It was then that Elisa suddenly intervened.\u201cOh, but I think I\u2019ve been a little harsh on your son.\u201d\u201cPresident Elisa? Now it\u2019s\u2026.\u201d\u201cSo I\u2019d like to give you a chance. Now we are going to end the situation neatly between the parties.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dTheodore read something in her manner and immediately shut up and it was the same for Rudger, who was watching the situation.\u2018I was relieved that the president intervened.\u2019The president secretly glanced at him. The corners of her mouth were flinching as if she could not bear the entertaining situation.\u2018I think she\u2019s a little fickle.\u2019The fact that she has that kind of personality is something I\u2019ve come to realize from meeting her several times.I\u2019m thankful that she mediated the situation, but the president seemed to want to lead the game in the direction she wanted.\u201cThe two of you will compete in front of everyone. What do you think?\u201dAt those words, the eyes of the audience watching the situation lit up as if they were interested.What she said was simple. A duel.\u201cOf course! Ivan doesn\u2019t know magic, and Mr. Rudger is a wizard, right? In that case, it cannot be an equal match. So I will give Mr. Ivan a chance to choose someone to fight in his place.\u201dIvan didn\u2019t understand why Elisa suddenly said this but then he stared at Rudger, clenched his teeth and nodded.\u201cAll right! That\u2019s what I wanted!\u201dElisa tells him that he can use people, so he seems to think it\u2019s worth a try.While he was thinking Elisa looked back at Rudger as if asking \u2018What do you think? Can you do it?\u2019Seeing it, Rudger sighed inwardly.\u2018But I can\u2019t say no.\u2019It was Elisa who calmed down Ivan, who was about to run wild, no matter what anyone said. Besides, the method of duel wasn\u2019t bad for him either.If he forces the situation to end vaguely, Ivan will have bad feelings for him for a long time and act behind the scenes. However, if they have a duel in front of everyone and come to a clean conclusion, then the story will be different.Even the chairman is watching, so even Ivan can\u2019t go on a rampage afterwards.\u2018No, he\u2019s just confident he\u2019ll win.\u2019I will not retaliate for my defeat in a duel in the presence of so many eyes and if Ivan tries to do something, Theodore, the chairman, won\u2019t let him.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mr. Rudger. Because of me.\u201d\u201cNo. it\u2019s okay.\u201dRudger shook his head at Selina, who was sorry.\u201cEven so, I felt that I needed to be in this position at least once.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s something like that.\u201dIn no time, the center of the banquet hall was emptied, and a large space was created.The audience, who retreated outside, stared at Rudger with interest. Among them was contempt for Rudger coming from his enemy Chris Benimore.\u201c\u2026\u2026In the end, this is how it goes.\u201dIvan chose his assistant as Rudger\u2019s opponent. Although he\u2019s an assistant he is also a skilled wizard and a person who once served in the military.\u201cI\u2019m not going to hold back.\u201dHe pulled out a cane from his waist and aimed it at Rudger. Rudger answered with a shrug and lifted a large cane in his hand.Everyone watched the scene breathlessly.A duel between a professional wizard hired by Luke and a new teacher appointed at Theon was a special event that they couldn\u2019t see anywhere else.\u201cNow, show us a legitimate match! Begin!\u201dThe observers were President Elisha and Chairman Theodore Luke.At the same time as Elisa\u2019s cry, Ivan\u2019s aide quickly started casting a spell. He wanted to end it as fast as he could since it was the best he could do for a talented junior, as a senior on the magic path.\u2018I will finish this as quickly as possible without wasting time.\u2019The most important things in a magic battle are speed of casting and accuracy. In fact, the way he fought was to cast quick spells and immediately overpower his opponent.He also made significant contributions thanks to these abilities when he joined the military, and the reason why he was hired by Luke after his retirement was because of that.He had been through this kind of duels many times in the past and always won so he thought this duel will be just like those in the past.\u201cWhat?\u201dThe moment he was about to unleash his magic he saw that his opponent manifested a much greater amount of spells that swallowed down his magic like a tidal wave.He didn\u2019t even had time to respond.\u201c\u2500\u2500\u2500!!!\u201dWhat followed was excruciating pain running through his body and he fell back unconscious.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe surrounding area became quiet in an instant.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The duel, which they thought would be a long and fierce battle, ended too quickly with a one-sided victory.\u201cIs this possible?\u201d\u201cI heard that the other person is a professional hired by Luke.\u201dThey stared at Rudger in disbelief. From before and until now, Rudger had never changed his cane-raising posture. His expression also didn\u2019t change as if it was natural to win.\u201cWinner! Rudger Chelici!\u201dElisa Willow\u2019s bubbly voice signaled the end of the duel.The atmosphere of the banquet hall, which was filled with silence and surprise, finally returned to its original state.Clap. Clap.People began to clap their hands one by one. Just as water droplets fell on the calm water surface and caused a stir, the sound of applause spread like a contagious disease and filled the entire banquet hall.Clap clap clap clap clap, clap, clap, clap!\u201cWhat a surprise! Is this the power of a Theon teacher?\u201d\u201cThe wizard hired by Luke isn\u2019t ordinary but he was defeated so easily.\u201d\u201cWhat the hell were those spells just now? What a quick magic manifestation! I didn\u2019t even see him casting the spells.\u201d\u201cWas the rumor of using an unusual magic true?\u201dContrary to what I expected, the duel itself didn\u2019t feel like it ended too quickly. Still, for an impromptu event, it gave quite a lot of enjoyment, so the audience was satisfied.\u201cOh, my God, that\u2019s amazing.\u201dTheodore looked at Elisa smiling as if he knew this would happen next to him, and said.\u201cThe aide I gave to my son was a famous wizard, but he was beaten up in an instant. Are all of Theon teachers such monsters?\u201d\u201cHa ha. No way. Actually, Mr. Rudger is an exceptionally unusual person.\u201d\u201cHmm. Right. I don\u2019t think there are more people like him. I wonder if there\u2019s anyone worse.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry for being a worse person but I was able to show him that way in front of everyone.\u201dTheodore smiled and shook his head.\u201cI was worried about nothing. It\u2019s my fault for having an incompetent son. It was a fair duel, and I will accept this defeat neatly.\u201dHaving said that, he looked at Ivan, who was still sitting on his seat with a blank expression on his face as if he still couldn\u2019t believe his defeat.\u201cThat stupid fellow won\u2019t even accept it and will go wild, but you won\u2019t have to worry about it. I\u2019ll step up and block everything.\u201d\u201cAs expected, Chairman Theodore. It\u2019s nice to talk with you.\u201d\u201cSo I want to ask you a favor.\u201dElisha shook her head like a knife as Theodore Luke tried to speak.\u201cYou can\u2019t.\u201d\u201cI haven\u2019t said anything yet.\u201d\u201cYou want me to introduce you to Mr. Rudger, right? Well, you don\u2019t have to say that. I\u2019m sorry, but please refrain from reaching out to our teacher.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Huh. If you say so, there\u2019s nothing I can do.\u201dAt Elisha\u2019s subtle warning, Theodore was forced to raise his hands and declare his defeat.Rudger is clearly a person who is coveted, but he judged that he was not enough to offend the president of Theon in order to make a relationship with him.Theodore is a big hand who has a huge impact on both the political and business world of the empire, but there were a few people who he could not even touch carelessly and Elisa Willow, the woman in front of him, was one of them.\u201cWell, it would be shameless of me to bring it up.\u201dTheodore said so and glanced sideways at the entrance of the banquet hall.\u201cBut I don\u2019t know what they would do.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026That\u2019s right.\u201dElisha followed Theodore at the entrance to the banquet hall, and her complexion slightly hardened.Unwelcome faces were seen entering the banquet hall.* * *\u2018Oh, my.\u2019Seeing Ivan Luke\u2019s aide stretched out in front of my eyes, I was somewhat perplexed. I thought he was a good-looking person, who would have known that he would fall in vain like this?\u2018He said that he was strong, so I was serious.\u2019I was a little worried because I didn\u2019t know what kind of magic my opponent uses. Surprisingly, however, he was a wizard who excelled in rapid magic. The most important thing in a duel between wizards is the speed of casting.Considering that part, the man in front of me could be seen as a talent that specialized in one-on-one duels in a way, and was close to a first-class talent. That\u2019s probably why he said he\u2019d deal with me confidently.He must have been convinced that he could defeat me with his special skill.\u2018But why use that against me?\u2019This was why I was dumbfounded.I\u2019m not bragging, but even if a wizard of 5th rank or higher came, I could keep up with the speed of casting magic due to the source code.As far as third-tier magic is concerned, I can show a speed that I can beat anyone.At this point, I was embarrassed to the point that I thought he came out to lose on purpose.\u2018Did he not know?\u2019I deliberately spread rumors while showing the source code magic openly in the first class, but don\u2019t people know by this point?Nevertheless, the fact that he bet on speed, I had to say that the person in front of me didn\u2019t know the magic I used. No. Even if he knew, he didn\u2019t believe it was real like many other wizards around the world.\u2018It doesn\u2019t matter that I won.\u2019The fallen assistant was carried away by Luke\u2019s bodyguards.Ivan, the culprit of all this, was still stunned, unable to believe that he had lost the duel.\u201cThis\u2026!\u201dHe soon looked at me and clenched his fist but he couldn\u2019t scream like he did a little while ago and I also realized that his gaze was over my shoulder.\u201cAre you Rudger Chelici?\u201dI slowly turned my head to look at the owner of the voice. It wasan old man with a long white beard stood with a cane.He was an unusual old man. It was because everyone was wearing stylish suits and dresses, and he was wearing a robe.It wouldn\u2019t be strange to be kicked out for not following the dress code by the guard who stood at the entrance right away. However, if a logo symbolizing a specific organization is embroidered on the robe, then the situation is different.\u201cAre you from the tower?\u201d\u201cOh, you can see it right away.\u201dThe old man\u2019s eyes lit up at my words and he chuckled.Having a logo symbolizing a tall tower contained in a gold circle on his robe of course I knew the old man in front of me was a wizard from the tower.Even the foolish Ivan Luke was aware of the existence of the Tower, so he stayed in his place.\u201cSo why did you come to see me?\u201dHe didn\u2019t even come alone because behind him were five other wizards.\u201cI saw the duel a little while ago. The opponent\u2019s spell casting was quick but you were much more than that. I\u2019ve never seen anyone cast their magic so quickly in my life.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cIs that the rumored [source code] magic?\u201dI was wondering why you came here, was it because of this?I nodded because it was nothing to hide anyway.\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cOh! I see! I knew it!\u201dThe old man reacted like a child who found a great toy. His wrinkled face suddenly showed a strange reaction, and I frowned unknowingly.I asked in a slightly curt tone.\u201cSo why did you come to see me?\u201d\u201cOh? Oh, my. Come to think of it, we didn\u2019t even say our names to each other, did we?\u201dFar from answering my question, the old man immediately began to introduce himself.\u201c My name is Altego Dantes, and I am a member of the Tower Council .\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026I\u2019m Rudger Chelici, a teacher at Theon.\u201d\u201cI know. I went to this humble place myself in the first place to meet you.\u201dA humble place? But this is a banquet where VIPs gather, so I think it\u2019s too much.\u201cMe?\u201d\u201cI was going to visit Theon in person, but who would have thought that the wicked fox would interfere and sabotage me in every way?\u201dRudger immediately knew who Altego was talking about.\u201cOh. Isn\u2019t it Chairman Altego?\u201dBecause the person in question, came out with a smile on her face.Altego frowned outright when he saw that she came.\u201cElisa Willow. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m seeing you all in a place like this. Is it okay for the president to be in this? You\u2019re so light-hearted, why don\u2019t you step down?\u201d\u201cWell, what brings you here, Chairman? You said that you don\u2019t fit well with fancy events where you have to be formal.\u201d\u201cDo I have to tell you that? I\u2019m just here because I have someone to meet.\u201d\u201cAha-ha. The chairman is very honest. Are you here to see our new teacher?\u201dThe president\u2019s mood, which had been playful until now, had become sharp from the moment she met Altego.\u201cA young genius wizard like the president must be like water and oil with the stagnant and rotting Tower Council.\u201dThe council is a symbol of the old generation and the president is a symbol of the new generation who accepts change and wants to develop further.\u201cBy the way, this isn\u2019t a very suitable place for someone like the chairman to come, right? Did you come here to get something to eat?\u201d\u201cA wicked fox like you should not block my path. The reason I came here has nothing to do with you.\u201dHaving said that, Altego tried to ignore the president and spoke to me.\u201cI won\u2019t be able to talk for long anyway, so let me be straightforward. Why don\u2019t you join our Tower? I promise I\u2019ll give you the best treatment.\u201d\u201cChairman!\u201dPresident Elisa screamed and I was also surprised by Altego\u2019s blunt remarks. His behavior now was very rude but Altego continued, ignoring the reactions around him.\u201cShould a wizard your size just waste his talent teaching a bunch of kids? When I first heard the rumors about the source code, I was skeptical, but after seeing the duel a while ago, I was convinced. You are a talented person suitable for our tower.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cI will write a letter of recommendation myself. If you come to the tower, you can occupy a particularly high position.\u201dJudging from his reaction, it seems that he had tried to contact me before, but he was stopped due to the constant interference from the president so he decided to come to the banquet for new teachers.\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing for you, too. You won\u2019t have to waste your time teaching some little kids. Would those young bastards even know what magic is? But the tower is different; it\u2019s the place where every wizard on the continent wants to join!\u201dAltego talked excitedly about the tower.The summary of what he said was the Tower it\u2019s the best and everything else is trash. He was really arrogant, but in a way, he was not too wrong. The majesty of the tower was definitely something he could be proud of.I paused for a moment, pretending to think about it, and then opened my mouth.\u201cIf I were to go to the tower, what could you do for me?\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d\u201cMr. Rudger?\u201dAltego knew this would happen but President Elisa couldn\u2019t believe it.\u201cHaha! What do you want? Do you want a lot of money? The amount of support that comes into the Tower every year is second to that of Theon! I don\u2019t know how much they give you, but we can give you at least three times that!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cOr do you want power? If you come under me and submit a magic thesis, you\u2019ll win the position of chief wizard directly under the Council! Or do you want a great artifact? I can give it to you if you want to!\u201d\u201cIn that case.\u201dI brought up the subject.\u201cIf I ask for a seat in the Tower Council will you give it to me?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dAltego\u2019s face contorted for a moment. The same was true of the five wizards who were lined up behind him and listening to the conversation. They soon realized what I was saying and turned hostile.\u201c\u2026\u2026What does that mean? You want a seat in the Council?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cAre you crazy? When you enter the tower, you need to know how to say \u2018thank you\u2019. We even give you money! But a seat in the Council? Do you not know what kind of position that is?!\u201d\u201cI know very well.\u201dHow can you not know?\u201cIsn\u2019t it a place for old people who don\u2019t have skills?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Are you serious? Or are you drunk and don\u2019t know what you\u2019re saying?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m wide awake.\u201d\u201cAre you out of your mind?\u201dAltego\u2019s face changed to that of a dove that had been shot. He glared at me and gritted his teeth.\u201cIt\u2019s not enough to dare to reject the Tower offer and blaspheme the name of the Magic Tower? Are you still sane? Now that you\u2019ve developed a new magic, have you ever mistakenly thought that you\u2019ve become something?!\u201dThe old man, who had been chatting happily until a while ago, was nowhere to be found. Altego\u2019s forehead was filled with blood, and his face was red.\u201cThere are things that should be said and things that shouldn\u2019t be said\u2026\u2026!\u201d\u201cI guess I put it in a difficult way.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cSo here\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about.\u201dI looked down at the old man in front of me and said.\u201cNo matter what you give me, I won\u2019t come to the Tower.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Thank you for your support.When Rudger told them directly that he would never join the Tower, Altego just opened his mouth and didn\u2019t say anything. It was the same with the five wizards who followed him.Although they are now called the old guard and have declined considerably compared to the heyday of the Tower, which wielded absolute power, there were still countless wizards who dreamed of joining the Tower.Altego was one of the 12 members of the Tower Council that only a selected few members of the Tower could join and the reality was that he couldn\u2019t even put pressure on the wizard in front of him.\u2018But, what?\u2019What did the boy in front of him say now? Even if they give him a seat in the Council, he won\u2019t join the Tower?\u201cYou punk! How dare you say that in front of me?\u201dThe first to grasp the situation was one of the five disciples Altego brought.\u201cThe chairman is kind to the teachers of Theon, so don\u2019t be arrogant! Master, you should just ignore a guy like that.\u201dHe couldn\u2019t control his anger, and he looked like he didn\u2019t want to be here for even a second. But as soon as he was about to leave, he heard Elisa\u2019s giggling, not Rudger\u2019s reply.\u201cHahahahaha\u201dInstead of her usual fake laughter, her laughter was 100% real this time.Altego was embarrassed by her laughter and it was the same for the five disciples. After a long giggle, Elisha laughed so hard that she had to wipe away her tears with her fingertips.\u201cIt\u2019s so funny. I don\u2019t know how long it\u2019s been since I laughed like this.\u201dSaying that, she returned to her usual appearance.\u201cMr. Rudger doesn\u2019t want to go, so what can I do? You came all the way here for nothing.\u201dIt was a good opportunity for Elisa to tease Altego since he was rejected by someone much younger than him and had his pride hurt.\u201cI told you~ you\u2019ll be rejected anyway, so why bother visiting the academy? Do you think the current Tower is still the old one?\u201d\u201cYou! Can\u2019t you watch your mouth?\u201dOne of Altego\u2019s five disciples stepped up in a fit of rage and Elisa\u2019s expression changed in an instant.\u201cWhat if you don\u2019t like it?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cWhat are you going to do if you don\u2019t like it?\u201dAt the moment Altego\u2019s disciple panicked, a chilling spell erupted from Elisha and began to tighten his body.\u201cCough!\u201dHe couldn\u2019t breathe properly and stared at Elisha with disbelieving eyes.He knew that Elisa Willow was a genius wizard who achieved the sixth rank at a young age. Even though she was a member of the Tower she suddenly left, and became the President of Theon.When the public praised her as a genius, he couldn\u2019t take it. If she were a real genius, she should have stayed in the Tower and made a name for herself. Why did she left and became Theon president?Of course, he thought that she ran away and went to an academy where she played house for children because she was afraid that she couldn\u2019t handle the situation in the Tower.He thought that the rumors about her were exaggerated and if he met her he could prove that he was superior.\u2018Different dimensions.\u2019He couldn\u2019t move even a single tip of his finger. It is difficult to even breathe, let alone use magic. He felt like he was deep in the deep sea filled with endless darkness. But what makes him even more distressed is that Elisa was at least considerate of him so he could breathe.\u2018I\u2019m not her opponent.\u2019This was the power of the youngest 6th-level wizard, the power of the [Lexorer] rank, which is the 3rd highest among the existing 8 ranks.\u201cStop it.\u201dIt was Altego who broke the overflowing tension with a single word.Elisa sighed inwardly and withdrew her magic power. Despite his personality, she knows Altego abilities are real. He is a 6th level wizard like her, so if they clash for nothing, things will only escalate.Altego restrained his disciples with a calm voice.\u201cYou should stop, too.\u201d\u201cOh, but, sir,\u201dAltego looked back at his disciples in silence. The disciples, who tried to refute something, shut their mouths when they saw Altego\u2019s expressionless face.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dBefore leaving, Altego glared at Elisa for the last time and then glared over her shoulder at Rudger, staring at him with a blank face.\u201cYou\u2019ll definitely pay for it later.\u201dEven if he\u2019s a no-nonsense person, he\u2019s just backing down because his personality isn\u2019t so bad that he would make a fuss in a place like this.Altego promised time and again that he would never forget this disgrace. Usually, in this situation, the other person will also react nervous or embarrassed but Rudger didn\u2019t, he only nodded his head slightly.It was like he was saying \u2018try it if you can\u2019.Altego left the banquet hall, biting his molars and the five students, who were at a loss, rushed to follow after Chairman Altego.\u201cPhew.\u201dWhen Altego disappeared completely, Elisa relaxed her shoulders. Then, unlike usual, she smiled at Rudger with a little tired look.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mr. Rudger. I should have been more thorough.\u201d\u201cNo, the president helped a lot.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to say that. Anyway, the reason I interfered is because I have a bad relationship with them.\u201dAfter saying that Elisa asked abruptly.\u201cDo you hate the Tower?\u201dIf he had to answer, he would say yes and it was the same with Elisa.\u201cActually, I was a magician from the Tower.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s actually harder to find a wizard on the continent who\u2019s not from the Tower, anyway I called a genius there\u2026..Oh, that\u2019s too much bragging about myself.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s all right.\u201d\u201cI worked hard there but the Tower is a bit old-fashioned, isn\u2019t it? These days, science and magic are advancing, so it was hard for old people in the Tower to accept them and we fought a lot.The old and new towers are separated.The old Tower is a place where pure wizards gather. Their mindset it\u2019s that magic is the greatest and only the chosen ones should practice it.\u2018On the contrary, the God Tower is a faction trying to cast off the authoritarian mask of magic and combine it with modern science.\u2019It may have been hundreds of years ago, but human history has made rapid progress in the last 200 years. Cars appeared instead of carriages, and weapons using gunpowder instead of simple swords were the mainstay.Nevertheless, the existence of wizards and knights was still an axis of the world, but they could not completely reject change either, especially the wizards.Magic and science seem to be the same, but they are different.The Old Tower wizards argued that science should be rejected, but the New Tower wizards thought science and magic should be combined so they acted and created magic engineering by combining magic and science.The birth of magic engineering made the world develop faster. Steamboats, engineering trains, steam golems, flying airships and all sorts of things were born, and even now new things are continuing to appear.In such a turbulent world, the tower was torn apart by the two forces. The confrontation between Altego and Elisa shows the relationship between the old and the new and Rudger was a new-age wizard.To be more precise his mind is that of a new-age wizard but his magic is old fashioned. The \u201creal magic,\u201d which he did not show well to others, was much closer to old-fashioned magic than to new-age magic.However, it was not something to brag about, so Rudger nodded and only responded to Elisa\u2019s words.\u201cDid I talk too much? Still, this is a banquet for a long-awaited celebration, and Mr. Rudger must be tired.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll leave you alone now, I have a lot of people to deal with. Mr. Rudger, enjoy yourself today but with just a little bit of alcohol! You get it, right?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dElisa disappeared from his sight, fluttering the hem of her black dress as she did when she appeared.\u2018Is it finally over?\u2019Following a quarrel with Ivan Luke, the wizards of the Tower came and bothered him. It was quite a mental exhaustion, but Rudger soon got back on track, because he came here for a purpose.\u201cAh! Mr. Rudger!\u201dAs Rudger approached, Selina, who was with the others, welcomed him.\u201cTeacher Selina, are you all right?\u201d\u201cYes. The president of that Luke Company personally came and apologized.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a relief.\u201dNo matter how incompetent his son was, the chairman apologized himself. He may have an ulterior motive, but he is certainly not a fool like his son.Rudger glanced back and looked at the faces of the people with Selina.\u201cYou were talking to other people.\u201dSelina had very few friends present in the banquet hall, but besides her was Ms. Merylda who often takes care of her.\u201cOh, nice to meet you.\u201d\u201cYou are the one from the rumors\u2026\u2026.\u201dThree women and a man open their eyes in surprise at Rudger. They were people he met for the first time, but faces that he passed by at least once. They were the teachers in charge of Spirit Studies at Theon.There were four of them, each taking up one seat from the second grade to the fifth grade.Rudger greeted them courteously.\u201cI am Rudger Chelici, the teacher in charge of the 2nd grade Manifestation class.\u201d\u201cI heard of the new teacher in charge of the second grade. I\u2019m Sethruna, the second-year Spirit Studies teacher.\u201dSethruna was a woman with short red hair. For a moment, Rudger suspected that she might be Esmeralda, the First Order.\u2018No. I can\u2019t make a decision yet.\u2019The other teacher introduced themselves as well.\u201cMy name is Partonya, and I\u2019m in charge of the third grade.\u201dPartonya, who teaches third-grade students, was an impressive lady with a great presence.\u201cMy name is Vierano Dentis, and I\u2019m in charge of the fourth grade.\u201dThe teacher in charge of the fourth grade was the only man in the Spirit School and he looked rather timid with a small frame. Surprisingly, he was an elf with pointed ears.\u2018Is he an elf?\u2019There was nothing particularly strange about having multiple sub-races in Theon so an elf in charge of the Spirit Studies class is nothing special.\u201cI\u2019m Angela Anderson.\u201dFinally, the 5th grade teacher in charge of the graduating class was a sharp-looking woman wearing glasses. She was strict but quite beautiful and looked like she was hard to approach.\u2018If I narrow down the list, one of those three should be Esmeralda.\u2019The problem is who the real one among the three is. Esmeralda knows about the identity of Rudger so she might show some kind of reaction when they shook hands but none of them showed any particular reaction towards him.\u2018Could it be that it\u2019s none of them?\u2019Esmeralda\u2019s personality is fiery and tricky and she gets annoyed quickly when things don\u2019t go her way.\u2018The second grade teacher Sethruna it\u2019s the most suspicious.\u2019Only teachers with experience are appointed for the third grade and higher and the new teachers are mainly in charge of the first two grades so if the Black Dawn Society wants to plant people they would most likely be there.\u2018Should I get Hans to find out about the person named Sethruna?\u2019As his worries deepened, he was a little thirsty and as he was about to call a waiter he had no choice but to pause for a while because she looked familiar.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.Rene?\u201dA student who attends his class and possesses non-attribute magic and because she was paying attention to him she was staying close to Rudger.Wearing a black and white waitress suit and holding a silver tray in one hand Rene also froze when she saw Rudger.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I heard that the pay is good and the job doesn\u2019t take long.\u201d\u201cIs it a part-time job?\u201dI wondered if it was necessary to entrust it to Theon students, but surprisingly, this kind of thing happened quite often.Leathervelk once had an agreement with Theon. It is said that Theon\u2019s students are specially hired for various necessary tasks in Leathervelk.The same is true of the bulletin boards that exist in Theon. The purpose of the agreement was to hire Theon\u2019s students for less difficult work and give them the opportunity to earn the necessary funds.This was also good for Leathervelk because they could have the opportunity to meet Theon\u2019s students and put a face stamp on talented people who would become great wizards in the future, along with a positive image of the city.Even with these banquet halls, it was not uncommon for some students to come as part-time workers.\u201cBesides me, there are several other seniors, so it\u2019s okay.\u201dLine smiled and replied.According to Henry this was an easy part-time job and she could earn a lot of money but she didn\u2019t expect that it would be a banquet hall where teachers and important people gather?\u201c\u2026\u2026Yes, I see.\u201d\u201cWould you like a drink?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dRudger took a glass from Rene\u2019s tray and immediately drank it.It was a little unexpected to have Rene in a place like this, but it wasn\u2019t really a problem. It was just a little surprising.This wasn\u2019t something he needed to worry about.\u2018But.\u2019Whenever he sees her, he suddenly remembers what happened in the past. It\u2019s even more so when he sees her standing still and looking at him having a drink with sparkling eyes. She has the same appearance as Rene and he couldn\u2019t get her out of his head.\u201cRene. You\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dRudger, who was suddenly going to say something to Rene, could not finish his words properly.\u201cNo, it\u2019s nothing.\u201dI can\u2019t tell her because of that promise. Giving her the book it\u2019s the only thing I could do.\u201cDon\u2019t overdo it, go home early.\u201dAll Rudger could say was, after all, just some advice.\u201cOh, yes. Thank you. I\u2019ll be on my way.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dAfter Rene bowed her head and backed away, Selina, who found her late, approached Rudger and asked.\u201cThat kid just now was Rene?\u201d\u201cYou know her? I thought she wasn\u2019t in your class.\u201d\u201cYes. We got to know each other the other day but what is Rene doing here?\u201d\u201cShe said she had a part-time job.\u201dSelina clapped her hands.\u201cAha. That\u2019s right. I think I heard that some students who don\u2019t get scholarships make money from other jobs. No wonder my assistant was here.\u201d\u201cYour assistant?\u201dAt the word assistant Rudger remembered how Selina took the students to the Fantasy Forest for the test.\u201cWho is it?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s that kid over there.\u201dSelina raised her hand and pointed to one side. There was a girl with dark brown hair and long braids over her shoulder.He couldn\u2019t see her face well because she was wearing big glasses, but Rudger recognized her immediately.\u201cHer name is Joanna Lovett, a freshman who entered Theon and I took her as an assistant because she has a deep knowledge of spirituality.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dJoanna Lovett? It was his first time taking her name because she was not a student taking his class.Rudger stared carefully at the figure. She stood still with a tray that had now been emptied, looking like the other students who were working here.\u2018Hmm. Come to think of it, among the people on the scene at the time, I didn\u2019t pay much attention to the assistants.\u2019Esmeralda wields a high level spirit of fire, so that was the reason why he thought she would be at least a teacher. With Esmeralda\u2019s real identity unknown, Joanna Love could not escape from the suspects list.Just as I thought so, Joanna Lovett, who was standing still, began to move.\u2018What is she trying to do?\u2019Rudger watched her movements closely. She was now glancing around secretively so that no one else would notice her, but Rudger could tell.Joanna moved cautiously, placing a silver tray on the table at the center of the banquet hall.\u2018Where are you going?\u2019After she put her tray down, she went back to her place and stood still.\u2018Was she just trying to put an empty tray away?\u2019Maybe I\u2019ve become too sensitive.Rudger looked away from Joanna Lovett and glanced over the banquet hall and he could hear people talking.\u201cDid you hear the news this time?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cThey\u2019ve been saying that the back alley vagrants have been acting extraordinarily lately.\u201d\u201cYou mean the low class? That\u2019s what happens all the time.\u201d\u201cIf it was the same I would have lost interest but this time it\u2019s a little unusual.\u201d\u201cWhat is so unusual?\u201dThe middle-aged man who opened his mouth nodded and cleared his throat.\u201cWould you believe me if I say they\u2019re doing business?\u201d\u201cHahahaha.\u201dThe laughter was indistinct because everyone was talking, but Rudger, who was listening, certainly heard it. It was obviously a laugh.\u201cHuh. The lowlifes doing business? Did you see it wrong?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t see it either, I just heard the rumors, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s just false rumors.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not a false rumor?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s been going on in the back alley recently, but they said the guys who were fighting everyday are now holding hands.\u2019He said everything he knew.\u201cThey cleaned up the slums and started using a building as an office. People said they even saw a large amount of fabric going into it.\u201d\u201cHuh. What the hell are they doing?\u201d\u201cI heard they\u2019re trying to get into the clothing business but they don\u2019t have a chance.\u201d\u201cHahaha. That\u2019s right. What can the lower class do since the luxury clothing stores are holding the market as tightly as they are now?\u201dOverhearing this, Rudger realized that what he had ordered was going well.\u2018You\u2019re moving faster than I thought. Since people noticed what\u2019s happening, it must have been quite a while since you started moving in earnest.\u2019They tried to pretend not to, but they were desperate and the strategy that Rudger showed them was more than effective and a little overkill.People who used to roll in the dark, dirty mud found hope. They who lived their entire lives down there realized that they might be able to go up, so how can they stay still?And that strong desire will be a huge wave that no one can stop.\u201cNo matter what the lower class do, it\u2019ll be from there.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. What about the money they need for business? Will the back alley prostitutes, beggars, and bastards come together change anything?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s amazing that there\u2019s someone who\u2019s funded them. I can\u2019t even borrow money because my credit rating is low.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it because the royal family is all for the common people these days? So the lower ones are climbing up.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous. They\u2019re just going to eat the piece of bread that rolls down from the top, and are going to enjoy some kind of wealth.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be so angry. Still, we don\u2019t have to step up and trample on them, do we? What can they do? They\u2019ll just destroy themselves. Let\u2019s have wine while watching the scene.\u201d\u201cHa ha ha ha.\u201dEventually, they couldn\u2019t hold back and burst into laughter among themselves.\u2018You fools.\u2019Rudger shook his head. They won\u2019t be able to laugh in the future. They\u2019re just individuals who can\u2019t read the tide of the times. The human world is so small, and on the contrary, the world is so huge. More than what we see, what we know by knowledge, and what exists on a map.From their point of view, the immeasurably huge world inevitably seems to stand still but that doesn\u2019t mean the world has stopped.\u2018The world is moving endlessly toward the future.\u2019History proves it.Nothing seems to have happened in a day or two, but a surprisingly big change will happen in a year and two since the world is changing in every moment.\u2018You\u2019ll find out soon.\u2019After thinking that far, Rudger stumbled in his seat without realizing it.\u201cTeacher Rudger, are you okay?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. The floor is a little slippery.\u201dSelina asked anxiously. Rudger responded lightly, but couldn\u2019t come to his senses because of the ringing sound in his head.\u201cAre you all right\u2026I\u2019ll\u2026.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to get some fresh air.\u201dThe words around him began to be eaten up by the noise.Rudger cleared his breath and left immediately. Selina looked worried, but she didn\u2019t follow him when he refused.He came out on the balcony. There was no one here because the banquet was in full swing.\u201cWhoo.\u201dRudger held on to the marble railing with his hands.The noise, which was not heard properly, began to take on the shape of a clear language.[Accepting\u2026][Let\u2019s\u2026Let\u2019s\u2026Let\u2019s\u2026\u2026.][You\u2019re\u2026You\u2019re chosen\u2026.]\u201cShut up.\u201dRudger ignored the voice and took out his pills. Unlike the usual two or three pills, he put as many as he could in his mouth this time. At the same time, his voice, which had become increasingly distinct, began to be crushed again, as if trapped behind a fog.Soon the noise gradually decreased and disappeared like an echo leaving the mountain.\u201cWhoo.\u201dRudger sighed with relief and stared at the night view of Leathervelk over the railing on the balcony.The city, where light flowed everywhere, was shining brilliantly in the dark and Rudger felt the night breeze over his body.He closed his eyes for a moment and thought about what he should do in the future, what he can do and soon the answer was clear in his mind.* * *\u2018Rudger Chelici?\u2019Chris Benimore, wandering around to take a break, unwittingly hid behind a wall when he saw Rudger Chelici standing alone on a balcony.\u2018What are you doing here alone?\u2019It was 30 minutes ago that he defeated the wizard hired by Luke in front of everyone.Chris Benimore had also watched the duel. He had hoped Rudger would be brutally defeated there, but the reality was not the same as his wishes.Rudger knocked down his opponent with overwhelming force in front of everyone. The speed of his casting was instantaneous, and Chris realized it was the [source code] magic.\u2018He\u2019s a formidable man.\u2019As he thought so, he struggled to ignore the growing sense of inferiority he had in his heart.\u2018By now, you should have been surrounded by people and hearing all kinds of praises.\u2019But he was alone on the balcony.\u2018You\u2019re eating something?\u2019The man, who was usually expressionless and emotionless, was now so exhausted that he was unrecognizable.He took something out of his arms and began to pour it into his mouth.\u2018Is it medicine?\u2019Is it what he usually eats? Does he have a chronic disease?Chris Benimore reached a conclusion at this moment.\u2019Too much medicine it\u2019s harmful to the body but there\u2019s only one kind of medicine that isn\u2019t.\u2019A drug that restores mana.\u2018Although there are very few magic recovery drugs in the form of pills, it cannot be said that there are none. Are you eating them because you are suffering from a lack of magical power?\u2019If yes, why? Chris\u2019 head was spinning.\u2018It\u2019s because of the duel a little while ago.\u2019Rudger knocked down his opponent using a series of colorful magic in front of everyone. The magic power was not great and it was all second and third-tier magic, but Chris could tell that Rudger was now struggling with a lack of mana.Chris Benimore was the first to notice the weakness of Rudger.\u2018I see. That\u2019s why he ended the magic duel quickly.\u2019The hidden secret of Rudger Chelici, unknown to others, was that the amount of magical power he possesses is absurdly low.\u2018So far, you must\u2019ve been regularly taking a magic pill to not get caught.\u2019Chris Benimore couldn\u2019t help but smile since he found Rudger\u2019s weakness that no one knew about.\u2018The magic festival is about to take place. I can do it there.\u2019Chris Benimore ran away before he fully recovered, fearing that he might be caught by Rudger.* * *\u2018Is it over?\u2019The cause was that he used too much magic during the magic duel a while ago. At first, he thought it was okay, but he didn\u2019t notice that he was running out of magic because he took his time talking to other people.\u2018I have become too lax.\u2019He used to live with a pill in his mouth like a habit, but he forgot even that. There were so many other things to care about, but it seemed necessary to reflect on himself a little.\u2018At least I managed to narrow down the list of suspects and I\u2019m one step closer to discovering Esmeralda\u2019s identity.\u2019When he came back to the banquet hall thinking that screams erupted from everywhere.\u201cAhhhhh!\u201d\u201cA monster, a monster!\u201dEveryone shouted in a tearful voice. Rudger, who had just returned to the banquet hall, could also see that in the center of the banquet hall the figure of a giant of blazing fire appeared on the table.\u2018It\u2019s Esmeralda!\u2019Rudger realized that the Black Dawn Society First Order Esmeralda summoned the spirit.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Thank you for your support.The sudden appearance of the fire giant turned the banquet hall into a crucible of chaos in an instant.\u201cWell, what the hell is that!\u201d\u201cArgh! Run!\u201dPeople were startled and scattered around but ended up colliding with each other. Most of the people who gathered here were incompetent. As a result, they failed to maintain their reason in the sudden situation and panicked.The giant opened his mouth when he saw them. When the mouth full of sharp fangs like that of an animal opened, what was seen inside was a bright red wiggling flame like the one on the bottom of hell.The people watching the scene turned pale and they felt instinctively what the giant was going to do.A flame that was so hot that their skin burned even if they were far away for it was spewed out from the center of the banquet hall but at that moment, the guards moved.Since it is a banquet hall where important people gather, all the guards were knight in case something happened.The guards in black suits pulled out the sword worn on their waist and swung it right away. Even if the number of guards is not large, considering that one knight is equal to several dozen or more mercenaries, the security of this banquet hall was not low.The first sword wielded by the guard hit the flame. The aura contained in the sword cut through the flames and deflected it in another direction.A long stream of fire turned and engulfed the ceiling of the banquet hall. The fire spread like concentric circles on the ceiling and burned up all the chandeliers hanging in the air.The chandelier, unable to withstand the heat of the fire, melted and fell to the ground.\u201cAvoid it!\u201d\u201cRun away!\u201dScreams resounded everywhere.The panicked people bumped into each other and fell but others stepped on them and kept running. The banquet hall was instantly filled with chaos, reminiscent of a battlefield. It was then that Theon\u2019s teachers acted.\u201cThis way!\u201d\u201cSlowly! Move calmly!\u201dSpirits appeared everywhere to block or remove debris falling from the sky. The Spirit of the Wind helped those who fell, and the Spirit of Water extinguished the flames on the ceiling.Other wizards didn\u2019t sit still either as magic erupted from everywhere and was shot at the fire giant but the fire giant blocked the magic with his body.\u201cWe must defeat that monster!\u201d\u201cWhere the hell did it come from?!\u201d\u201cJust buy some time! People\u2019s evacuation comes first!\u201dRudger stared at the figure of the fire giant. It\u2019s his first time seeing it, but that energy definitely looked familiar. It was clear that it was the advanced-level spirit of fire he encountered at that time.\u2018Advanced?\u201d No. It\u2019s stronger than that.\u2019At that time, he felt that it was at least an advanced-level spirit, but now that he sees it, its majesty is quite extraordinary. At this level, it seems close to a supreme-level spirit that has an extremely low probability to be born from the essence of nature.\u2018The supreme level is the level directly below the elemental lords that are representing the attribute of the elements. To think she called a guy like that.\u2019On the continent, spirits are graded from the lowest to the highest. Among them, the advanced-level spirits belong to the 4th and 5th ranks compared to wizards, and the supreme-level spirits are close to the 6th rank. And on top of that was the elemental lord.The giant of fire, who just broke into the banquet hall, is a supreme-level spirit, which can be said to be just below the elemental lords.Since it was such a powerful existence, the attack magic used on the spot was not able to deal it a proper blow.\u2018Esmeralda\u2026Where is she?\u2019Rudger rolled his eyes. The most suspicious person was a girl named Joanna Lovett whom Selina had been talking about. However, she has not been seen since the fire giant appeared.He needed to find her.As soon as he thought so, the giant of fire, which had been under attack, moved again. The fire from the ceiling which had not been extinguished stretched down as if responding to the cry of the giant. It felt more like a thick liquid with high viscosity, rather than a fire.As it fell, the guards moved in haste.\u201cDon\u2019t let the guests get hurt!\u201d\u201cCut it down or get rid of it! Do as you please!\u201dOne of the guards who shouted like that immediately swung his sword and cut the falling drops of fire.\u201cWhat?\u201dThe thick flame he had cut with his sword was not properly cut, but rather stuck to his sword. If that was all it wouldn\u2019t have been an issue however the flame attached to the blade spread to the body of the guard in an instant.\u201cArgh!\u201dThe guard, who hit the falling drops of fire, was caught in flames in an instant and rolled on the floor. Even with the superior physical ability of a knight he had no power at this moment.The power of fire possessed by the supreme spirits is different from ordinary fires and has an extremely high temperature.The faces of the other guards who saw the scene turned white.\u201cEveryone, be careful! You must not touch it!\u201d\u201cIf it attaches to your sword, throw it away otherwise, you will die!\u201dMaybe it was because the call was a little late but three more guards were burned to death after the first victim.Rudger frowned at the sight.\u2018Is it because the spirit used the element? It\u2019s not like a normal fire but more like magma.\u2019For a fire, the shape is clear, and even though it is small in size, its calorific value is unimaginably high. In fact, if one looked closely at the giant of fire, there were black spots all over its body, it was literally the embodiment of living magma.\u2018I heard that spirits usually show the mystery and magnificence of nature.\u2019It is said that the form of the spirit is not fixed but there are some rules. Basically, a spirit takes the form of an animal, plant, or other deformed structures.It is the same as the spirit level increases. The spirit\u2019s rank changes depending on how much nature\u2019s energy it holds.The higher the rank, the stronger the energy of Mother Nature, and the more it is, the more it becomes something other than the form of a living being.Long ago, while wandering the world with his master, Rudger once witnessed the Elemental Lord of Water.The appearance he saw at that time was quite different from what people assumed and talked about. It looked like a mixture of oriental dragons and giant whales.The being that was bigger than an island was moving above the sea level, scattering countless white manes like a huge sea fog behind its back because it literally embraced the wonders of natureBut the fire giant in front of him did not do that, it was close to being tailored to human senses.\u2018A supreme-level spirit that has human form.\u2019Human form with arms crossed. Although it is large, it looks more like a bizarre lump of fat rather than muscles. The black spots that appeared all over its body made the appearance of the fire spirit even more ghastly.\u2018A Twisted Spirit.\u2019That was the best way to describe it and as Rudger stared at the spirit he noticed something strange.\u2018It has no lower body?\u2019Compared to the giant\u2019s peculiarly enlarged upper body, the lower body was almost invisible. Probably because he didn\u2019t have a lower body and I knew right away that it was because it wasn\u2019t summoned properly.\u2018She used a medium.\u2019There are two ways to make a spirit manifest when summoning a spirit. The first is to summon a spirit through the contractor\u2019s magic. However, if this method was used, magicians sensitive to magic could immediately recognize the identity of the summoner.In that case, the second method is used. That is, using a medium to summon a spirit. It depends on the type of medium, but a top-tier spirit won\u2019t be summoned properly unless a very expensive ore is used.\u2018But the advantage of using a medium is that the summoner won\u2019t be discovered.\u2019Esmeralda\u2019s choice was the second method and she used a medium to summon the fire spirit.\u2018The silver tray on the table.\u2019It was obviously the tray that Joanna Lovett had secretly brought in the middle of the banquet hall. Even if it was incomplete, it was not a common tray if it had enough power to summon a supreme-level spirit.It\u2019s fortunate that Esmeralda has been identified, but the situation was not been quite favorable for Rudger either since he can\u2019t go after Joanna until the spirit is taken care of.\u2018Now it\u2019s not the time.\u2019Rudger looked around.The guards were working hard to restrain the giant and some wizards are also hitting him with water and ice magic.In the chaotic situation, Rudger found a person who had not yet been evacuated.\u2018That\u2019s\u2026\u2019His expression hardened quickly.* * *\u2018What\u2019s going on?\u2019Rene opened her closed eyes. She remembered walking around and serving people until a while ago, but she couldn\u2019t remember anything clearly after that.The last sight she had seen was something exploding in front of her.Did she faint?Raising her upper body by gripping her dizzy head, she finally realized what had happened at the banquet hall.\u201cWhat?\u201dThe center of a banquet hall, the place where the party was supposed to be in full swing, was a complete mess and a fire giant was wreaking havoc.\u2018A spirit? Is that a spirit?\u2019A giant of her great stature was fighting against the guards and magic teachers in her banquet hall, it was so powerful that she couldn\u2019t guess its level.\u2018It\u2019s not the time for this. I have to run!\u2019As Rene tried to move her body, she felt a burning pain in her ankle and frowned.\u2018My legs.\u2019She had a scar on her ankle, the wound wasn\u2019t deep, but she couldn\u2019t move.\u2018I have to crawl and run!\u2019At that moment, the fire giant scattered flames around. It must have intended to get rid of all the flies that bothered him at once.\u201cAh.\u201dRene saw the scene and realized that she couldn\u2019t avoid the fireballs that have the power to turn a person into ashes.Rene closed his eyes tightly and waited for death but at that moment, she had a feeling that something had covered her body and pulled her strongly somewhere.\u2018Huh? Doesn\u2019t it hurt?\u2019Rene carefully opened her closed eyes and saw Rudger looking down at her.\u201cRene.\u201d\u201cMr. Rudger.\u201d\u201cAre you okay?\u201dWhy is he here now? No, more than that\u2026 Did he save her? Rene was desperately rolling her head that didn\u2019t work well, and realized what was going on.Rudger saved her life.\u201cSir\u2026\u201d\u201cStay still.\u201dRen\u00e9 struggled with her face dyed red, but Rudger remained motionless. He held Rene in his arms, withdrew to a safe place, and immediately checked her legs.\u201cThe wound is not deep. I have a recovery pill, so wait.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dSeeing Rudger immediately taking out the medicine bottle from his arms, Rene felt a strange feeling.\u2018What is it?\u2019Obviously, Mr. Rudger and her had little contact. To be honest, she didn\u2019t have much to do with him. But at this moment, Rudger saved her from a crisis and was even treating her. It occurred to her that she had seen this sight somewhere.\u201cTeacher.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201dRene didn\u2019t know why she\u2019s saying this, but she really wanted to ask.\u201cWe. Didn\u2019t we meet before?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Thank you for your support.At Rene\u2019s question, Rudger trembled for a moment but it was only for an instant and Rene didn\u2019t see it.Rudger replied calmly.\u201cWhat are you talking about? Did you see anything?\u201d\u201cWhat? Oh, no. Just. I suddenly felt that way.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s enough nonsense. The treatment is over.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201dRene\u2019s injured leg immediately recovered thanks to the medicine.\u201cRene, leave, it\u2019s dangerous here.\u201d\u201cWhat about you?\u201dI will do what I have to do here as a teacher. You\u2019re the only one left, so go ahead.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dRene was about to say something, but she stopped. Because she couldn\u2019t ask Rudger all the questions she had in a dire situation like now.\u2018Nevertheless, what is this feeling?\u2019She was clamoring in her head to ask Rudger the questions as soon as possible.\u2018No, I can\u2019t disturb Mr. Rudger now.\u2019Rene tried to shake off her lingering feelings of regret and bowed to Rudger.\u201cThank you for saving me.\u201dThen she ran out in the direction pointed by Rudger.Rudger turned to the banquet hall after confirming that Rene had completely disappeared out of his sight.As the fire giant began to move, wizards and guards were being pushed helplessly. Still, the number of deaths did not increase due to ignorance as before, but it was be only a matter of time now.Rudger checked his physical condition.\u2018This noisy banquet is going to end now.\u2019* * *Countless spells flew through the air targeting the supreme-level spirit, the main culprit for the current situation. Eventually, magic collides with the spirit of fire, explodes, and scatters powerful shock waves around it.\u201cWe got it?\u201dAs soon as a wizard\u2019s murmur, which had been sweating due to excessive mana consumption, ended the fire giant appeared from the foggy smoke and he looked even more ferocious than before.\u201cGet out of the way!\u201dAt that moment Theon\u2019s Spirit Studies teacher stepped forward. Among them, Angela Anderson, who is in charge of fifth-grade classes, took the lead.\u201cBite it! Ventuswalpe!\u201dVentuswalpe, a supreme-level spirit of the wind, who looked like a giant wolf with a fluttering white mane jumped at the giant of fire at the order of the contractor and bit his neck.\u201cKuo!\u201dThe fire giant, who did not even move even after being attacked by magic, responded for the first time.The giant of fire, who was screaming in pain, clenched his right fist and tried to swing it toward the wolf hanging from his upper body.\u201cYou can\u2019t do that.\u201dIt was Vierano Dentis, the fourth-grade Spirit Studies teacher and an elf who spoke. Behind his back was a tiny salamander made of pure water swimming around.Vierano pointed his hand at the giant of fire and the Spirit of Water moved. He rolled his little body in a circle, and soon shot out like a shell.\u201cBoom!\u201dIt collided with the fist of the fire giant, which had just been aiming at Ventuswalpe.No one on the scene thought that the little lizard could stop the giant\u2019s attack but the result of the crash was surprising. The fire giant\u2019s right fist turned black after the fire was extinguished under his elbow.Compared to Ventuswalpe, the supreme-level spirit of the wind, it was shabby in size but its power was that of a supreme-level spirit and since the opponent was a fire spirit it had the advantage.\u201cWell done!\u201d\u201cWith this, we can win!\u201dSome people watching the situation from behind cheered but Unsilane\u2019s contractor, Vierano, frowned secretly.\u2018It was a powerful attack, but it didn\u2019t completely defeat him.\u2019Others don\u2019t know, but he did. In particular, Unsilane, who signed a contract with him, was not maintaining its form properly due to the collision just now.Even though it only bounced the giant fist, Unsilane was significantly pushed back.\u2018Isn\u2019t it possible to deal with a supreme spirit using a supreme spirit?\u2019The supreme spirit of fire that appeared in the center of the banquet hall was unlike ordinary spirits and it also took the form of a human being.\u2018If the president was here, the situation would have been different.\u2019The President left the banquet a little while ago and the Spirit of Fire appeared after that, so the president couldn\u2019t come to help.Maybe the person behind this attack now may have been aiming for the President\u2019s absence. Even so, there are a number of Theon\u2019s teachers here, knowing that they still started the attack.Is it because they were confident in their power?\u2018Who the hell summoned a supreme-level fire spirit here? A person of that level shouldn\u2019t be a terrorist.\u2019But his thoughts didn\u2019t last long.The supreme spirit of fire, which had slowed down for a while, began to move. The fist of his right hand, which had been extinguished, burned again.Seeing that he wasn\u2019t affected by Unsilane hit Vierano made a bold decision.\u201cTeacher Angela, have Ventuswalpe step back!\u201d\u201cAll right.\u201dAngela heard Vierano\u2019s words and Ventuswalpe immediately stepped back. Soon after, a scorching heat spread around the fire giant\u2019s body.Had she been too late to withdraw Ventuswalpe, the spirit would have been engulfed by the heat.Teacher Angela murmured in a faint tone.\u201cThat\u2019s the power of a supreme spirit.\u201d\u201cWe can\u2019t take it down but we can buy time if we work together.In a little while Leathervelk\u2019s police will move after hearing the news, the Knights of the City that exist above them, to be exact.If they step forward, it will be easier to defeat the fire giant.\u2018But he\u2019s really hot right now. Even if we work together to defend ourselves, how long will we last?\u2019Even though he was prepared for the aftereffects of this, he didn\u2019t know if he would have to squeeze out all his strength.The moment he was determined to do so and wanted to convey his opinion to others, Vierano noticed a black shadow rising above the fire giant\u2019s head.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cWhat is that?\u201dIt was the same with other guards and wizards.A man was looking down at the giant of fire, floating high enough to cling to the ceiling while holding a staff.\u201cRudger Chelici?\u201dThe most frequently mentioned name in Theon recently.\u2018But why now?\u2019He was fully aware of his skills after seeing the magic duel at the beginning of the banquet but this is a different case. The opponent is a supreme spirit of fire. No matter how powerful Rudger Chelici is, he can\u2019t deal with that\u2026\u2026.\u2018You got caught!\u2019What Vierano was worried about happened. The fire giant discovered the existence of Rudger. The two eyes that contain the essence of hot fire were raised and faced Rudger.Rudger stared silently at the ugly monster.Did you not like that look? The fire giant contorted his face and clenched his fists.At that moment, Rudger\u2019s magic appeared. Third-tier magic combined with the source code was unfolded at a swift speed, appearing around him one by one.Around Rudger, like countless clock hands, spears made of each element appeared. However, they were not only small in number, but also had insufficient power against the enemy in front of him.Then, the hand holding the staff pointed at the fire giant and at the same time, the magic moved.\u2018That\u2019s not going to work\u2026\u2026.\u2019All the teachers watching the scene had the same thoughts. The fire giant will receive Rudger\u2019s attack with its body and block them.The scene in everyone\u2019s head was all the same but\u2026\u201cKuah!\u201dThe giant of the fire suddenly screamed and curled up. It was like trying to protect something from Rudger\u2019s magic.Rudger\u2019s magic struck the fire giant in the back and even those watching were embarrassed by the sudden action of the giant.\u2018What\u2019s wrong? Why is it moving like that?\u2019Vierano recalled one thing he had overlooked.\u201c\u2026\u2026Medium? Did he aim for that?\u201d\u201cWhat? Mr. Vierano. Are you talking about the medium for spirits?\u201dVierano nodded at Angela\u2019s question.After he became convinced, he began to see things he had not seen.Why has such a huge spirit suddenly appeared in the center of the banquet hall?Because it was summoned using the highest quality medium.Most of the spirits are summoned only with the contractor\u2019s magic, so he forgot about the other case.\u201cNow, Mr. Rudger is directly targeting the medium from which that spirit was summoned. So the spirit responded to it and crouched down.\u201d\u201cIf it is a medium, is there a problem?\u201dAngela answered Partonya\u2019s question with a stiff face.\u201cIt\u2019s a big problem. The spirit of fire is protecting it with his body so it would be impossible to even pierce it without a high amount of firepower.\u201dShe said because all the attacks that Rudger threw were blocked by the fire giant\u2019s body and disappeared. No matter how much magic he used, he will not be able to penetrate the fire giant and eliminate the medium inside.Rudger also felt the same way.\u2018I don\u2019t have enough power but to be honest, it would be difficult to use other magic here.\u2019It had been a while since he had almost exhausted himself from consuming too much mana. If he consumes a large amount of magical power here, he will not be able to recover it even with medicine for a while. Besides, there were too many eyes to see around.If he uses his \u2018real magic\u2019 here, the aftermath will be so huge that it can\u2019t be compared to when he showed the source code.\u2018Then.\u2019It can be used with less magical power, and it was enough to use the magic that could most effectively overcome the current situation.Rudger immediately stopped his floating magic and descended to the ground. He stood in front of the crouching fire giant who raised his head and stared at Rudger.\u201cThe festival ends here.\u201dRudger said in a low voice that only the fire giant could hear and activated his magic which was a little slower since he didn\u2019t use source code but as soon as it was completed the fire giant rattled, perhaps feeling something strange.The metal tray, the medium of summoning, that he hid under his bloated upper body broke in half with a sudden bang.\u201cNo matter how much you surround it, you can\u2019t fully protect it.\u201dHis attack went through space and reached the target, it was the coordinate designation magic.The magic that Rudger used was not a big deal but the situation was different since he destroyed the summoning medium of the fire giant.The fire giant opened his eyes in disbelief but now that the medium of summoning disappeared, there was nothing he could do. The heat so strong that it melted everything around it gradually disappeared and the fire giant stared at Rudger as if to kill him, and his mouth opened wide.Was it going to breathe fire in as a last effort? When everyone thought that, what came out of the spirit\u2019s mouth was completely unexpected.[Human. Hateful scum.]The will of the spirits can be said to be part of Mother Nature, so everyone was surprised that it could speak.[I\u2019m going to burn them all!]There was no change in Rudger\u2019s expression in the face of the incredible sight of the Spirit speaking the words of hatred.\u201cTry it.\u201dHe even provoked the spirit.The Fire Giant was reverse-summoned without doing anything else. Countless sparks scattered in the air and fire giant disappeared as if it had melted away like a flame that burns without leaving ashes.\u201cOh, my God.\u201dThe people who were watching the scene couldn\u2019t help but be astonished.The supreme spirit of fire that could not be defeated even by countless wizards and knights was subdued by Rudger Chelici alone.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The Discord server is almost done and will be made public this week.The fire giant had completely disappeared, and the case was quickly closed. The wounded were treated and all healthy people were sent home but the outside was cluttered with citizens who flocked to see what was going on.Rumors of a fire giant appearing at the banquet hall have spread widely. Reporters flocked to try to figure out what was going on, and the police stopped them with their bodies.\u201cAre all the students safe?\u201d\u201cOh, Mr. Rudger.\u201dIn the temporary clinic that was made to treat the injured Selina and Merylda, who were waiting nearby, brightened their faces when they saw Rudger approaching.\u201cMr. Rudger! As expected, you\u2019re safe!\u201d\u201cYes, are you two all right?\u201dMerylda replied, waving her hand.\u201cWe\u2019re fine. I only helped students and guests evacuate.\u201d\u201cI see. Where are all the students?\u201d\u201cI sent them all back. They were just doing part-time work at the banquet so there was no need to have them stay but why are you asking?\u201d\u201cI just wanted to make sure everyone is alright.\u201dIf he persists in asking about Joanna Lovett\u2019s whereabouts here, they\u2019ll get suspicious so Rudger made up an excuse.Merylda smiled gently as if Rudger\u2019s answer was unexpected.\u201cMr. Rudger is really interesting, too. When I first saw you, you looked like you wouldn\u2019t bleed even if I poked you, but you worried a lot about the students, I guess you care a lot about them.\u201d\u201cI hear that a lot.\u201dRudger looked around and saw that the injured were taken to hospitals, and the remaining people were cleaning up the scene.Some people were talking to the police about how the incident happened.The incident was clearly defined as a terrorist attack, causing 12 deaths and about 80 injuries. And considering that most of the casualties are people with considerable status in society, the damage could be said to be even greater.\u2018If Esmeralda was aiming for this,, I\u2019d say she was half successful.\u2019While the president was away, she used a summoning medium to summon a supreme spirit of fire. She should\u2019ve had the intention to kill everyone around using the spirit. Fortunately, the victims were few because of the strong resistance of the guards and wizards.Although the incident wasn\u2019t big it wasn\u2019t without damage. The fire spirit might\u2019ve been summoned through a medium but it was comparable to a sixth rank wizard.The impact of this incident was beyond description because it imprinted in people\u2019s minds that no matter how high the security attacks will happen somehow.\u201cMr. Rudger?\u201dThen someone approached Rudger and called his name, it was Vierano Dentis, one of the wizards who fought against the giant of fire until the end at the scene. The elf teacher played a big role with Angela until Rudger came forward.\u201cYes. May I help you?\u201d\u201cCan I talk to you for a moment?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s possible, but\u2026\u2026.\u201dRudger slurred and the quick-witted Merylda immediately grabbed Selina\u2019s arm and slipped away.\u201cMiss Merylda?\u201d\u201cSelina, let\u2019s go this way.\u201dWhen the two were left alone, Vierano bowed to Rudger.\u201cThank you. You helped us end the situation before there were any more victims.\u201d\u201cI just did what I had to do.\u201dRudger got to know the elf teacher a little better. Although at first glance he seemed a little soft, he was the one who played the biggest role in fighting the supreme spirit of fire.In particular, as the fourth-grade teacher, he seemed much better at dealing with spirits than Angela, the fifth-grade teacher.\u2018In terms of skills, he is superior to Angela Anderson, but is he deliberately staying as the fourth grade teacher because he feels burdened by such a position?\u2019Elves are a long lived species, so they are actually older than their outward appearance.He had the skills but he was not in charge of the fifth, so he most likely refused to take the position.\u201cSo you came to me to say thank you?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true, but I have one question.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cYou know how strong that fire spirit was, right?\u201dRudger nodded his head.He knew the power of a supreme fire spirit without fighting it. Although the medium could not properly handle the power of the spirit, only his upper body came out and his essence was a little twisted but his power was the real deal.\u201cHow did you do it?\u201dAt Vierano\u2019s sudden question Rudger asked back with a wistful smile.\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cYou knew the spirit was summoned through a medium, right?\u201d\u201cYes. To be precise, I found out later.\u201dRudger explained to Vierano how he knew that the fire spirit was summoned through a medium.\u201cThe lower body didn\u2019t come out properly.\u201d\u201cPerhaps the spirit\u2019s power was so strong that it couldn\u2019t be summoned properly through the medium. It was a coincidence that I realized it.\u201d\u201cI see. But you\u2019re still amazing. Even if it was a coincidence, Mr. Rudger noticed the weakness at a glance.\u201d\u201cWhoever was there would have known right away. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because I\u2019m special.\u201d\u201cNo. If it were me, I wouldn\u2019t have noticed right away as you had seen it.\u201dVierano laughed bitterly as if he realized his lack of ability in the incident.\u201cI\u2019m an elite in spirit science but because this was so unexpected I couldn\u2019t realize it in time.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dRudger didn\u2019t bother to blame him. In the first place it is very rare for someone to use a medium to summon spirits so it was an unexpected situation.Spirits are nature\u2019s beings, and signing contracts with them and summoning them is the power of Mother Nature and the energy of the contractor. On the contrary, in the case of a medium, it is said that most spirits hate it because it is an artificial summon.In particular, the higher the rank, the stronger their pride, so spirits reject summons through mediums even more. It is not a forced contract between contractor and spirit, but an equal contract with each other that can never be done.\u201cI overlooked it because I thought it was too obvious. I didn\u2019t think there was someone who could summon a supreme spirit through a medium.\u201cThe opponent may have so much power.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s definitely that, but I think the fact that the spirit was different from the ordinary spirits played a part.\u201dRudger felt that it was different from ordinary spirits.\u201cI\u2019ve never heard of a spirit that hates humans.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that the case with ordinary spirits?\u201d\u201cThe spirits are the image of the energy of nature itself and nature energy is the source of this world.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d\u201cSpirits are part of nature and Mother Nature doesn\u2019t think about the species that exist inside her.\u201dRudger suddenly remembered a lesson he had learned in a previous life.\u2014The pursuit of the heavens and the earth and all things.It comes from Laozi moral scriptures. People want to influence heaven\u2019s will, but heaven doesn\u2019t have a will. All things are just beings that live in harmony with nature like grass or dogs.Even if something goes wrong and something terrible happens, nature does not become a particularly frightening thing.Even if there\u2019s a typhoon, a flood, a drought and countless beings die, nature it\u2019s just nature and so are the spirits. But the fire spirit was different. Rudger could clearly sense his hatred for humans.\u201cI didn\u2019t think there would be such a spirit in the world. It hates humans and doesn\u2019t care about being summoned through a medium. And even the fact that there is a person who made a contract with such a supreme spirit.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026That\u2019s pretty serious.\u201d\u201cAlthough it\u2019s too late to understand the situation Mr. Rudger did his best Especially the magic you used at the end.\u201dVierano immediately noticed what magic Rudger used.\u201cIt must have transcended space, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be too sensitive about it. Because I\u2019m an elf and I\u2019ve seen as many things as I\u2019ve lived for a long time. So what I saw is correct, right?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right. It was a coordinate designation magic, a method of fixing magic in a specific space and manifesting it in that place.\u201d\u201cSetting the coordinates. Was that possible?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s hard at first, but it\u2019s easy once you get used to it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dVierano didn\u2019t quite believe what he said. Others might not understand it but he was an elf. Although he may look like a small boy in his mid-teens, he has lived more than a century.Even if his main interest was spirit science, he could confidently say that his knowledge of magic was second to none so he knew that the coordinate designation magic that Rudger used was not ordinary magic.\u2018There\u2019s no way it can be done that easily.\u2019Recognizing everything in the world as \u2018coordinates\u2019 and designating a formula there, can\u2019t be easy.If anyone can do it it\u2019s either because they were born with an excessive perception of space compared to others.\u2018Or the brain\u2019s limiter is completely off.\u2019The average person would think it was the former, but Vierano could not dispel his doubts. He thought that Rudger might belong to the second category.Can a person with good brains designate space coordinates leisurely in such an urgent situation? Besides, he invented an extraordinary magic called source code.Vierano asked, slightly concerned.\u201cAre you okay?\u201d\u201cWhen you use magic do you feel worse than usual?\u201dRudger, who was trying to ask back what it meant, realized that Vierano\u2019s expression was very serious.\u201cThis may be an old man\u2019s nosiness but please keep it in mind. There\u2019s a story that I heard when I was very young.\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\u201cThere are some people who think too much compared to others.\u201dVierano took a breath and spoke again.\u201cThey\u2019re often called geniuses, but they\u2019re a little bit different from real geniuses. Geniuses break through their specialized abilities within a given framework, but they are completely different.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the difference?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no given framework.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dRudger lost his words for a moment and then opened his mouth.\u201cThat\u2019s a good thing.\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t have a frame, you don\u2019t have limits. You might think you\u2019re blessed in a way, but you\u2019re not. People don\u2019t know that the frame is in fact, a strong barrier protecting them from the outside.\u201dThe moment the word \u201coutside\u201d came out Rudger clenched his fist unconsciously but Vierano didn\u2019t realize the strangeness of Rudger.As if preoccupied with his explanation, he asked, staring at Rudger with a serious gaze.\u201cI\u2019m asking just in case. Mr. Rudger do you sometimes hear strange sounds?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 100": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Academy\u2019s Undercover ProfessorCH 100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayC100: Source of sound (2)I wanted to post 2 chapters today but as I was eating dinner yesterday all of a sudden I heard a \u2018snap\u2019 sound and I couldn\u2019t turn my head to the left. My neck hurts a lot and I can\u2019t stay to much up, so until I get better only 1 chapter a day.\u201cCan you hear anything?\u201dVierano, who asked that, seemed to have some kind of certainty but Rudger shook his head and denied it.\u201cIt didn\u2019t happen.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cYes. Mr. Vierano\u2019s comments are very interesting, but unfortunately they have nothing to do with me. However, it is a little strange that there are people who do not have standards in their talents and thinking. Do you know anything more?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know because I\u2019ve come across it in an old literature. That\u2019s all I heard about when I was a kid.\u201d\u201cIf that\u2019s what Mr. Vierano, an elf, says, I think it\u2019s almost a legend for humans.\u201dAt Rudger\u2019s words Vierano smirked.\u201cYeah. Maybe.\u201dVierano was disappointed that the man in front of didn\u2019t have a framework but he somehow expected that.\u2018If you\u2019re an ordinary person, you\u2019ll never be able to endure it.\u2019People will not know since they live less than 100 years and tried to record a lot of history, but in many cases not all the facts that actually happened are recorded, at most, 70% of them are.Thirty percent is so forgotten by humans but the elves are different. They have a lifespan over ten times that of humans and they\u2019re like observers of history.Although their numbers are extremely small and were reduced even more in the wars up until 50 years ago they still remember it all.\u2018There are beings far beyond human cognition in the world.\u2019Huge spirits that exist in Mother Nature, higher races far superior to humans and even existences like monsters and demons that disappeared beyond the barrier of shadows in the Giant\u2019s Spine Mountains.And lastly, looking down at the world.\u2018God.\u2019Therefore, humans without a framework are quickly destroyed. Their vessels are so small that they dare not contain all the water of higher being\u2019s interest. A talented man may have a bigger bowl, but all he can do is hang in there a little longer.\u2018But Mr. Rudger is fine. I didn\u2019t feel anything strange before, and I don\u2019t feel anything now. I guess he\u2019s not the latter case.\u2019He was a little disappointed, but was relieved because he liked this human teacher in front of him.As soon as he thought so, Rudger opened his mouth and asked a question.\u201cI have a question.\u201d\u201cYes, go ahead.\u201d\u201cYou said that people who don\u2019t have a frame hear voices of being outside.\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s right although it might be a false rumor.\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s true, then there\u2019s more than that?\u201dMore than that?Vierano stroked his chin and groped his memory but shook his head immediately.\u201cNo. As far as I know, there are only cases where people heard voices.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cThere may be more but the average person wouldn\u2019t have endured that much to make it there.\u201d\u201cIf they endured it, what do you think will happen?\u201d\u201cWell, I\u2019ve never heard of that, but if they really get through it, there might be a next step. Just like how symptoms get worse.\u201dVierano lifted his index finger.\u201cI think the next step after hearing voices is seeing things.\u201d\u201cYou mean visions?\u201d\u201cYes, but it\u2019s just a hypothesis. There\u2019s no way there\u2019s such a person in the first place. If it was, they\u2019d be crazy. Wouldn\u2019t anyone be crazy if they had to see things they didn\u2019t want to see all the time?\u201dEven long-lived species, especially nature-friendly elves, would have a hard time bearing it let alone humans.\u201cAnd this is just in case, but if there\u2019s another one, I think it\u2019s probably this.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cIf you can hear the voice and see it with your eyes, there\u2019s more to it than that.\u201dVierano said that it wasn\u2019t a big deal and it wouldn\u2019t happen anyway.\u201cYou can have direct contact.\u201dAnd added one more word.\u201cGod.\u201d* * *Vierano left to explain the details of the incident. It was in the midst of his busy schedule that he had come to say thanks to Rudger.Rudger watched his back for a while before moving.\u2018Is it contact with God?\u2019Vierano\u2019s hypothesis was interesting. No, beyond interesting, Rudger was deeply impressed.\u2018Because it\u2019s all true.\u2019As expected of an elf who lived for a long time. Narrowing the truth all the way here with a story he read a long time ago.\u2018But I\u2019m not going to tell you anyway.\u2019His constitution was not something that could be easily talked about. That\u2019s why he\u2019s trying to suppress it with his own magic but this wasn\u2019t important now.\u2018Joanna Lovett. No, Esmeralda, First Order of the Black Dawn Society. What should I do with her?\u2019Rudger contemplated a lot while talking to Vierano. Should he hint at the real culprit of the \u201cspirit of fire\u201d terrorist attack?If he does that, he can clean up one of the most intrusive first orders but he will also be suspected if Esmeralda were to be identified.She, who has not been active until now, is identified as the culprit the moment she moves for the first time?If that happened Black Dawn might start an investigation and that would be a disaster for Rudger.\u2018If I make assumptions without proof things will be troublesome.\u2019It was clear from the circumstances that Joanna Lovett was Esmeralda. However, her opponent is a contractor who wields the highest level of fire spirits.The power of the supreme spirits is close to that of the 6th rank. In particular, the fire spirit may be even more dangerous because it is so different from normal spirits. It will not be easy to overpower such an opponent without considerable force.\u2018To do that the president must step in but when that happens, it will become difficult to hide the truth.\u2019In other words, Rudger\u2019s immediate income was that he discovered Esmeralda\u2019s identity but he couldn\u2019t decide what to do with it yet.\u2018Is it better to pretend that I don\u2019t know?\u2019He had no choice but to since Esmeralda would have noticed that Rudger had come forward and cleaned up the scene. Unless she\u2019s a fool, she won\u2019t argue why he interrupted her. Rudger also went out when he thought it was appropriate.He came to a conclusion immediately.\u2018I can\u2019t touch her for now.\u2019If Esmeralda\u2019s identity is revealed immediately after the incident has just begun, the Black Dawn will suspect a traitor.He\u2019s doing it for his safety but if he touches Esmeralda he would be in more danger so he had to wait and see.\u2018When she acts next time and shows her tail, at least a little.\u2019At that time, he will use Theon power to secretly reveal her true identity.\u2018So I\u2019m waiting.\u2019Patience was one of his greatest weapons.* * *The next morning the fire spirit terror incident was featured on the front page of the newspaper.[Terrorists attacked the banquet hall! Who is the culprit?]The provocative title, which was largely written in black, naturally caught the eye.I sat at an outdoor table in a secluded cafe and opened the newspaper.\u2018Well, it caused a riot, but it would be rather strange if it\u2019s not known.\u2019Leathervelk expressed its regret for this incident and threatened to find the culprit but Rudger didn\u2019t think they could do anything.If they could catch the Black Dawn Society they would have done it long ago.\u2018There are all sorts of conspiracy theories regarding the culprit\u2019s identity.\u2019Starting with lunatic terrorists, the opinion that the perpetrator of the terrorist attack was the work of the Liberation Army was dominant.In particular, considering that the majority of the victims who died this time are high-ranking members of society, it was inevitable that people would think it was the Liberation Army.\u2018They didn\u2019t do it but took the blame.\u2019Rudger felt that it was a bit silly but he didn\u2019t like the Liberation Army anyway. To put it bluntly, he was closer to hating the Liberation Army.\u2018Because of them, I am suffering now.\u2019My teeth are still gnashing at the thought of that time.If they hadn\u2019t stormed the magic train he was on, his hidden face wouldn\u2019t have been destroyed and he wouldn\u2019t have been forced into Theon Academy.But what can he do? It already happened. Now all that remained for Rudger was to do his best in the current situation.On the next page of the newspaper, there was an article written in small letters about the fact that the security of the auction at the Kunst auction house would be strengthened. And the fact that Luke\u2019s director, Ivan Luke, is the main host of the Kunst auction house.The man\u2019s rude face came to his mind.\u2018Is he the main host of the auction this time?\u2019Perhaps Ivan Luke will make the event even bigger, especially to make up for the scandal at the banquet hall. It will attract people, hold more spectacular ceremonies, and increase costs. He will restore his collapsed image by making a big fuss this time, and solidify his stake as a director at Luke.A faint smile formed around Rudger\u2019s mouth.\u2018I\u2019m looking forward to it.\u2019If the auction ends without a hitch, Ivan Luke will be able to make up for what happened out of his father\u2019s sight.\u2018If it ends without a hitch.\u2019It\u2019s a pity for Ivan that he does not know that the man he quarreled with at the banquet hall is secretly attending the auction.Rudger, who had been thinking that far, folded the newspaper because the person he was waiting for came.\u201cAre you here?\u201d\u201cYou said you were a teacher. Can you come out like this early in the morning?\u201dLooking at Violetta staring at me with a slightly dissatisfied gaze, I got up from my seat.\u201cYou don\u2019t seem to be in a good mood.\u201d\u201cIf you call someone as a guide early in the morning, everyone will be like that.\u201d\u201cFor that, I think you put a lot of effort into your makeup.\u201d\u201cMakeup is like armor to a woman. It takes a long time to prepare.\u201d\u201cSo it was.\u201dVioletta was dressed a little differently than before. At that time, she wore a black dress with a strange atmosphere to be formal, but this time, it was more of an easy-to-move activity suit.She wore long leather boots on the legs and a leather corset fitted to the waist and a wide-brimmed hat that blocked the sunlight on her head.After all of her burns were healed, she no longer wore the black cotton yarn that covered her face.\u201cIt\u2019s a suit that an adventurer or mercenary would wear.\u201d\u201cThere is nothing more comfortable than this when moving around. Let\u2019s go, we have to see what has changed.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dThere is only one reason why Rudger came out to Leathervelk early in the morning. It was to confirm the changed appearance of the slums.Violetta was already anxious to show him the changes. Her thorny attitude from when they first met disappeared and now she looked like an excited young woman.\u201cNow, look, this is the new street.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201dThe streets of the dirty, smelly slums I had seen before were completely cleaned up.\u201cAs you said, I used the money and hired people.\u201dCleaning, grooming, eliminating the existing shabby buildings and building new ones required a huge amount of money and manpowerand this is a place full of surplus manpower that other people don\u2019t use.\u201cI spent more than 80% of the budget on this.\u201dThe huge amount of money in the vault of Bellbot Rickson and the money from the Red Society was used to fix the slums.The effect was clear because the dying streets were starting to come alive.\u201cAs you said, I will make this road a street of artists.\u201dThe dark and dull slums were gone and carpenters were seen tearing down shabby houses and working hard on new houses.The children, who used to always sell newspapers, were seen running around.\u201cThis is the newly opened clothing store.\u201dVioletta had brought Rudger to a clothing store with large glass windows showing the inside display.There, people belonging to the Women of the Black Rose were moving around eagerly arranging and cutting clothes but out of sight countless steam engines were also moving and pulling out fabric.\u201cFirst of all, I\u2019m focused on using machines to pull out as many clothes as I can. Popular clothes come first but when we get to a certain level, we\u2019re going to challenge the luxury brand.\u201d\u201cYou must be confident, right? The opponents are those who have long taken root in the Empire beyond this city.\u201d\u201cI have always dreamed of this moment.\u201dVioletta smiled confidently.\u201cNo matter how deep the roots of a tree are, if it is rotten, it will fall down when the wind blows.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a good resolution\u201d\u201cWould you like to look inside?\u201d\u201cNo, thanks. I\u2019ll check the other places.\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019ll show you somewhere else.\u201dRudger has only checked one clothing store but there are more places that need to be inspected.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
