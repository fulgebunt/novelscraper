Happy reading!When most parents dream of their children\u2019s future jobs, they would recommend higher-level jobs such as doctors or judges since all jobs that end in the letter \u2018sa\u2019 are well-recognized. Or at least a civil servant called a stable iron rice bowl. No parent wants their children to go down a difficult and difficult path.However, in my case it was a little different.\u201cSon. You become a shaman.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dIt was the words my mother told me when my father passed away early and I was growing up together with my ferocious little sister.Although my family wasn\u2019t very lean or poor, I still wanted to earn money by studying hard and becoming a doctor, a scientist or a developer.However, what my mother recommended to me, who had meticulously crafted such a scientific route, was not a liberal arts route, nor even an artistic or physical education, but a path on a completely different level.What should I say about this Theology major?\u201cUh, what?\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t hear me well, so I\u2019ll say it again. You have to become a shaman.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t like it.\u201dMy answer was adamant.I\u2019m not going to be a shaman. Why all of a sudden in the first place?In response to my bold answer, my mother raised her eyebrows once, and spoke in a strong tone.\u201cYou have the qualities of a shaman. All kinds of spirits are watching over you. There is no other way for you than a shaman.\u201dHearing that, I was stunned. Do you have such talent? Beyond the absurdity, I just didn\u2019t think about it.From then on, my mother mostly said things that shouldn\u2019t be said to her son, such as that I have unique qualities, that I am destined to be harmed if I don\u2019t become a shaman and do not receive divine guidance.What did I reply back then?\u201cNever, I won\u2019t.\u201d\u201cYou will get hurt one day. They are all worried about you.\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s for me, you should support me on the way I go!\u201dI remember saying so firmly and locked up in my room.To be honest, it just made me sad and angry. You can\u2019t make a child who has properly designed his life since middle school to give up everything and become a shaman.At that point, I studied even harder with a sense of repulsion.My mother constantly bothered me and forced me to do religious things, and she taught me all kinds of bizarre knowledge such as poetry, magic, and witchcraft. But I didn\u2019t give up. The more I did it, the more I acquired all kinds of rational knowledge to make my head stronger.When more than 10 years passed like that, and as an adult, I finally settled down as a member of society but I died in a car accident.\u2018It was really absurd.\u2019Was this what my mother said about getting hurt? And what was even more surprising was what happened after that.\u2018I\u2019m alive.\u2019To be precise, I died once, but it would be correct to say that I was born anew.Does the afterlife exist? I thought everything my mother said was a lie, but it was all the truth. Through the experience of death, I felt deeply that human beings do not fully realize what they have not experienced until they experience it.What am I doing now?\u201cOpen the textbook. Continuing from last time, I will teach you how to draw a magic circle.\u201d\u201cI am a teacher at the Magic Academy.\u201d\u2026\u2026How did this happen?* * *A mechanical engineering locomotive emitting pure white steam arrived at the station. The sound of compressed steam spewing out as iron reverberated.The passengers waiting at the station got on the train one by one, and watching the scene, I took a deep breath before boarding the train. It felt like my body was becoming clearer as the fresh air seeped into my lungs.The sky was clear without clouds, and in the cold air of winter that was just coming to an end, I could even feel a pleasant refreshing feeling.The departure time of the train to the Exilion Empire was short.I raised my hand and lightly brushed my face. A strange sense of alienation felt between the gloved hand and the skin.\u2018The mask is firmly attached.\u2019I had to hide my identity, so it was unavoidable.I got on the train at a natural pace so as not to cause suspicion.\u201cI will check the ticket.\u201dAs I got on the train, the conductor spoke to me.I took the ticket out of the pocket of the frock coat I was wearing and handed it over.\u201cIt has been confirmed. Mr. Gerard. Have a nice trip.\u201dAfter receiving a courtesy greeting from the conductor, I responded with a light nod of my head.When I checked the ticket that was handed over to me, there was a number 403 written on it. In other words, it was the 3rd room of the 4th wagonThe hallway was narrow but long enough for only one person to walk through, and there were large gaps in the door on one side. The magic engineering train I was on was not called a luxury train for nothing, so all the seats in the long corridor were divided into rooms.401.402.403.\u2018Here it is.\u2019After checking the nameplate, I opened the door and entered. The moment I opened the door, I could smell the old wood.The inside wasn\u2019t that fancy, but it had everything. The soft seats are divided on the left and right and the storage space where luggage can be put. And even a signal bell installed so passengers can call the staff if they need anything.\u2018Not bad.\u2019I didn\u2019t have a heavy luggage bag, so I moved my body and sat down lightly. Even the seats were soft because it was a luxurious train.As I looked out the window, the vast landscape of the northern mountains caught my eye. The peaks of the soaring steep mountain range are covered with pure white snow, like giants wearing white cone hats. The train will soon pass through the crevices of that mountain range.\u2018Now that I\u2019m here, I can relax.\u2019My name is Gerard. I was once an ordinary member of society living in Korea. Of course, it was my previous life, and I died in a car accident.After that I woke up in the present world, a mysterious world where magic and science coexist, completely different from Earth. Here I was starting a new second life.\u2018I\u2019m on the train for the Empire, so I can rest until I get there.\u2019Exilion Empire, the largest and most powerful country on the continent. It is the birthplace of magic engineering, where magic and machinery coexisted equally, and where wizards and magic towers exist.I am heading to the empire now.\u2018Is the stop in the middle of a big city Leathervelk?\u2019I pulled out an informational pamphlet stuck next to my seat and checked the contents. The final destination of the Magical Engineering Train, which is currently scheduled to depart, is the capital of the empire. However, there is no way that there is a train going directly from the border of a country to the capital of another country.There are two stops along the way. Leathervelk is the first of them, and in some respects it can be seen as a more famous city than the capital. It is the place where the magic academy, the dream of all aspiring wizards, is located.\u2018A magic academy? What an amazing world.\u2019Decades have passed since I started living a second life, but there are still many things I can\u2019t adjust to. There must be a sense of separation from my previous life but the academy has nothing to do with me anyway. I don\u2019t need to worry about it.Rumble.While thinking that, the train vibrated slightly.\u2019Are you going to start slowly?\u2019Paaaang!!!As expected, the train honked its horn to signal its imminent departure. In as little as a minute, the train will run through the vast northern mountains.\u2018Am I going alone in this room? I hope it\u2019s comfortable.\u2019The moment I had such a futile thought, the door of room 403 creaked open as if it had been waiting.The one who came in was a well-dressed man in his mid-20s. He\u2019s tall and wears a brown frock coat similar to the one I\u2019m wearing. There is no way the train staff would wear such clothes, so it was obvious that he was a passenger in the same room as me. Even a tiger comes to me when I say it.As I was sighing inwardly, the other person looked at me and greeted me.\u201cHello.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe other side greeted me first, so I nodded my head slightly and accepted it. I didn\u2019t want to talk for a long time, so I responded as if I had a quiet personality.The man didn\u2019t care too much about my behavior and sat down on the seat opposite me.Paaaaaaaang\u2500\u2500\u2500!!!The train departed with a loud horn. At first, it was the locomotive that rattled and swayed, but as the speed started to increase, the shaking disappeared.It was not for nothing that the tickets were expensive. The common people could not even afford to pay such a high price, the speed and convenience were different from the general steam locomotive.The scenery outside the transparent window passed by quickly and the appearance of the pure white snowy mountain that covered everything was so beautiful that it automatically took your eyes off it. But after 10 minutes or 20 minutes, if you keep watching it, you\u2019ll get tired of it because it\u2019s monotonous.I took out the newspaper that was placed next to the pamphlet and unfolded it. Because there are no laptops or smartphones in this world, there is nothing other than books and newspapers that can kill time.[End of Civil War in the Utah Kingdom][It ends with the victory of the princess faction]On the front page of the newspaper, such an article was published in a wide open space.Not long ago, a civil war broke out and the Utah Kingdom was recruiting mercenaries from all over the world. It is also the country where the train station that this magic train departed from a while ago was located.Black and white photos were embedded between the articles printed in black letter font. It was a picture of the princess group announcing their victory in the war.\u201cThe civil war in the Utah Kingdom is over.\u201dA voice came through the newspaper. I pulled down the newspaper that covered my face and faced the man opposite. Since he spoke to me directly like this I couldn\u2019t ignore him.\u201cYes, it seemed to have ended unexpectedly, so I\u2019m glad.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been a while since the Prince\u2019s faction gathered forces from all over the world, but I\u2019m glad it ended early.\u201d\u201cStill, it is not without damage.\u201d\u201cIs that so? Ah. My introduction is late. I am Rudger Chelici.\u201d\u201cAre you an aristocrat?\u201dHowever, he does not show the arrogance or arrogance characteristic of aristocrats.\u201cI am Gerard.\u201dNo last name, this shows that I\u2019m a commoner.\u201cAh. It\u2019s okay you don\u2019t need to feel too uncomfortable because I am from the Fallen Nobility.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201dIf you\u2019re a fallen nobleman, it\u2019s understandable because they are nobles but not nobles.\u201cWhere are you going, Mr. Gerard?\u201d\u201cI am going to Lindebrugne, the capital of the empire. I have business to do there.\u201d\u201cIf someone like Mr. Gerard has a business, it must be a big deal, right?\u201dI laughed and shook my head at Mr. Rudger joke.\u201cIt\u2019s not a job, it\u2019s just a visit.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good too. I was just listening, but I heard that the Exilion Empire has a lot to see because of its advanced mage engineering.\u201d\u201cWhere are you going, Mr. Rudger?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to Leathervelk.\u201d\u201cLeathervelk is where the academy is. Do you have anything to see there?\u201d\u201cYes. Well, I\u2019m not proud of it, but I\u2019ve been appointed as a teacher at Theon Academy.\u201d\u201cHoo.\u201dI was purely amazed.The Empire\u2019s largest magic academy <Theon> it\u2019s the place where all the talents that exist on the continent gather and is a hotbed of the future where the gemstones that will carry this world are carved into jewels.Naturally, the students who gather there are made up of only the most talented children, and the teachers who teach them are strictly selected.The man in front of me was also said to be one of them.\u201cYou seem young, but you have great skills.\u201d\u201cNo. It\u2019s just that the public gave me a high rating. In fact, I narrowly passed the selection.\u201d\u201cI heard that there are a lot of people who fall, you should be proud of yourself.\u201d\u201cThank you for such a rating. Oh, more than that, it\u2019s because of the civil war in the Utah Kingdom, did you hear the rumor?\u201d\u201cWhat rumor?\u201d\u201cIt is said that there was a protagonist who made this civil war lead to the victory of the princess faction.\u201d\u201cHmm. You are the protagonist.\u201d\u201cBut surprisingly, he said that he was a wandering mercenary, not a high-ranking wizard or a high-ranking knight.\u201dA wandering mercenary who made a significant contribution to ending a nation\u2019s civil war. It hasn\u2019t been revealed in the newspaper yet, but word of mouth was spreading among people.\u201cMercenary Machiavelli. He said that was his name.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dI answered him in a slightly sarcastic tone.\u201cAren\u2019t you very surprised?\u201d\u201cHaha. I thought it was just a rumor.\u201dI said I didn\u2019t know, but it\u2019s actually a lie.The name of the mercenary Machiavelli is familiar to me because it was the identity that I was using before I became Gerard.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 2": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Academy\u2019s Undercover ProfessorCH 2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayC2: To the Capital of the Empire (2)But why did the man in front of me ask about the existence of Machiavelli? Is he doing it on purpose?\u2018What do you mean?\u2019For a moment, I wondered if he was a pursuer sent by the Princess faction of the Utah Kingdom, but it doesn\u2019t seem like that.Except for asking, Rudger took no action. Rather, his eyes and actions were closer to those of pure curiosity. So, is it just a coincidence?\u2018You are a Theon\u2019s teacher\u2026.\u2019Theon Academy is so famous that word-of-mouth spreads among people even when they are staying in a faraway foreign country. The fact that such a young man became a teacher there means that he is a person with great talent.I didn\u2019t know for sure when I first saw him, but I knew that this person was a bit unusual but instead of raising my alert, I shook my head inwardly.\u2018Let\u2019s call it a coincidence for now.\u2019I naturally turned to the next page of the newspaper and accepted his words.\u201cIf such a person existed, it would have been in the newspaper.\u201d\u201cHaha, there are some things that are not easily revealed to the public.\u201d\u201cCan you say that to a person you met for the first time today?\u201d\u201cThere is nothing wrong with it, is there? And Gerard, it\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve seen you today, but I think we\u2019re on a good note.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m thankful that Theon\u2019s renowned teacher took such good care of an old man.\u201dPerhaps in the current situation he\u2019s trying to project the image of being kind to others but Rudger didn\u2019t seem to want to turn off the interest he had in me.Since this has happened, I have decided to respond appropriately. Still, having a companion isn\u2019t a bad thing.\u201cMr. Rudger, if you go to Theon, are you going to teach right away?\u201d\u201cNot right away, I will have to wait.\u201d\u201cFirst year?\u201d\u201cNo, I will be in charge of the second year.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t new teachers usually teach first-year freshmen? You are more impressive than I thought.\u201dI heard that Theon is similar to universities on Earth even though it\u2019s a magic academy.All kinds of buildings were built on a huge site, and there were only thousands living and working there. Although it is adjacent to a large city, Theon itself is literally close to a small city, so the saying goes that it is a city next to the city.Theon students are divided from 1st to 5th grade. Usually, the higher the grade, the smarter the children, so it would be basic to have a competent teacher in the upper grades and new teachers for the first graders.\u2018It\u2019s not like he became a Theon\u2019s teacher for nothing.\u2019Although this world achieved the industrial revolution of iron and steam, if there is one thing that sets it apart from the Earth, it must be the presence of magic.\u2018I\u2019ve only seen it in fantasy novels.\u2019The existence of magic was inseparable from this world, and of course, of course, such magic has always been reserved for a select few.But unlike in the past where only aristocrats of noble bloodlines could learn magic, these days, there is a growing trend towards the supremacy of skill, in which commoners can learn magic if they have talent.Theon is the number one magic academy that anyone can enter if they have that skill.\u2018I\u2019m curious about what kind of place it is.\u2019When it comes to the magic academy, I have no choice but to think of a famous book from Earth. Students fly on broomsticks and use magic wands\u2026\u2026Perhaps the children who had been exposed to movies or books in childhood had dreams of such a magic school.In this world, academies where students can learn magic and enjoy their youth actually exist.\u2018Youth\u2026\u2026is it.\u2019In my previous life, my father died early, so I didn\u2019t have time to enjoy such things because I studied frantically out of a sense of duty to support my family, and was compelled to succeed.The second life, the present life, was not much different from the previous life. No, on the contrary, it was even worse. There is a reason why I hide my identity as I do now.After living for 27 years in this world I was no longer a hot-blooded youth. The magic academy and stuff like that are just otherworldly stories. The same goes for the man named Rudger, who is closely related to it.The man who stands on the shining stage called Theon and me, who lives with a false identity and hides his identity, are very different. Still, since he became a teacher at Theon at a young age, I should congratulate him.\u2018Because he is a fallen aristocrat.\u2019This world is still a hierarchical society and the nobles are, of course, those who belong to the apex of such a class society.However, there are those who fell to the abyss after being in such a place. Either they revolted against the state, or they hated the people of higher rank, or they owed a lot of money. Anyway, there are nobles who fell to the abyss for various reasons.Considering that the fallen aristocrats are more despised by the same nobles than the commoners, the man named Rudger in front of me must have put in a lot of effort to become a teacher at Theon.As I was thinking I heard something strange from the outside.\u2018What?\u2019I threw my gaze out the window, and I couldn\u2019t help but feel a strange sense of anxiety. The atmosphere is strange, as if something was about to happen.\u201cWhat is it?\u201dRudger asked, as if puzzled by my reaction.I did not answer and focused my five senses\u2026Something is coming.\u201cNow\u2026\u2026.\u201dThat was the moment when Rudger was about to open his mouth.\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500!!!A huge explosion shook the train wildly. The cabin shook, and the train running on the railroad staggered sideways.I held onto the handle of the chair strongly to balance my body.\u201cWhat is this\u2026\u2026? Did the engine explode?\u201dRudger asked, but I shook my head in disbelief. The engine does not appear to have exploded because there\u2019s no way the entire train will shake from one exploding engine.\u2500\u2500\u2500!As if my anxious imagination was not wrong, a thumping sound was heard from the ceiling of the train, and something began to run busily. At the same time, a loud noise was heard from the vehicle in front.After hearing the sound of something breaking and people screaming I realized exactly what happened.\u201cIt\u2019s an attack.\u201d\u201cAn attack on this train?\u201d\u201cMost of the guests of the Magic Train are wealthy merchants and nobles. It must have been the robbers of the Northern Mountains who were aiming for them.\u201dMost of the guests on this expensive train are rich people. Naturally, there were many people who were aiming for their money and valuables, so robbers\u2019 targeting the trains was not something unusual.\u2018Even so, doing this at the border to the Empire.\u2019The ones who attacked now are also not regular robbers.\u2018The explosion that shook the train just before was not an ordinary power.\u2019I narrowed my eyes because there was a part that I could guess.\u2018Is it magic?\u2019There is a wizard among the raiders.If a wizard is involved, it will be easy to rob the train and escape quickly in the mountains.There\u2019s no way big organizations that possessed wizards who could produce this level of firepower and attacked the train on which there were nobles were regular robbers.Since it is a world where magic exists, there are people who do bad things with magic.\u201cMr. Rudger. I think we should hide for now.\u201dRudger nodded at my words and packed his luggage.Why are you trying to pack your bag in this situation? Looks like there\u2019s something important inside. I was not in a position to worry about anyone else, so I got up but Rudger who took the lead.\u201cI\u2019ll go in first just in case.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dFirst of all, it is because I am a commoner in my 40s who has only a lot of money and this guy who became an academy teacher in his mid-20s would fight better.Rudger took out a small wooden staff in his right hand and held it up. The two of us opened the door to the room and looked at the corridor of the 4th vehicle. It was empty, I think the passengers were waiting quietly in the safe rooms now.\u2018It\u2019s the wrong choice.\u2019The rooms are protected by magic, but the robbers who have attacked are not ordinary people. To sit still inside in such a situation it\u2019s like waiting to get caught.In this case, it is best to stay away from them as much as possible.\u2018Even so, those who entered Vehicle No. 3 haven\u2019t come here yet.\u2019I thought that they would immediately disperse and extort money from the guests but maybe they are aiming for the first vehicle in front.Car No. 1 is a first class seat for nobles.It was a special room that was so strictly protected, but in other words, it was the golden egg with the most money.\u2018I\u2019m happy if that\u2019s the case.\u2019As long as their eyes are drawn to the No. 1 car it\u2019s good for us. These magic engineering trains are equipped to send a rescue signal in case of an emergency, like an unexpected attack.Reinforcement troops will probably come rushing in sooner or later. I just have to hold on until then.At that moment, a man broke the window in the hallway, the snow he had not brushed from his shoulder flew down. Sensing our presence, he turned his head and stared at us, there was a lot of blood in those eyes.\u2018Did you take any medicine?\u2019His appearance, dripping with hatred and anger, seemed different from a robber. Waiting for the train in this cold, maybe he succumbed to evil?\u201cWhat\u2026\u201dBut before I could even reveal my doubts, he started yelling at us. At the same time, Rudger\u2019s magic was manifested.As if drawing a three dimensional picture in the air, the engraved formula soon sublimated into a single magic.\u2018Crazy!\u2019I thought a as blue lightning bolt formed, and then in a single flash of light pierced the intruder\u2019s chest.\u201cAww!\u201dThe robber, who was running towards this side, fell to the floor and trembled.I looked at Rudger and asked.\u201cYou killed him?\u201d\u201cNo, I just stunned him.\u201dRudger, who answered that, slowly approached the fallen robber with a cautious expression on his face while keeping his wand pointed at him.\u201cWait Mr. Rudger. It is dangerous.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m only going to do a light interrogation to find their purpose for attacking this train.\u201d\u201cNo\u2026\u2026.\u201dI tried to say more, but Rudger didn\u2019t listen and moved. He pushed the robber, who had fallen to the floor, with his feet.\u201cSay it. For what purpose did you raid this train?\u201d\u201cHehehe\u2026\u201d\u201cLaughing in a situation like this\u2026?\u201d\u201cEveryone, everyone, must die.\u201dIn the stuttering voice, there was a cold madness that made my skin tremble. The robber laughed as his body convulsed and bled from his nose. At the same time, the shirt he had tightly wrapped around was unraveled, revealing what was hidden inside.It was a huge bomb.\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dWhen Rudger saw it, his eyes widened and he activated his magic and the robber pressed the detonator he was holding in his hand.\u201cBoooom!\u201dA huge explosion swept the No. 4 vehicle.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Fortunately, there were no injuries because even the shattered shards couldn\u2019t penetrate the coat I was wearing.\u2018It was good to wear sturdy clothes.\u2019The hallways and vehicle walls that had been intact until a moment ago were completely blown away. The cold wind blew through the open cracks and scratched my face like a knife.\u201c\u2026\u2026I thought he was just an ordinary robber.\u201dDetonating a bomb wrapped around his body while being suppressed by magic, this is by no means the behavior of a train robber. He was more like a fanatic, with a mindset of dying together with the enemy.\u2018A remnant of the prince faction from the Utah kingdom? No, they\u2019re busy hiding now. These people belong to another organization.\u2019As I wiped my face with my hands in frustration, I sighed as I felt my skin sagging. For some reason, I felt the cold wind blowing straight into my face.\u201cIt was expensive, but it\u2019s a pity.\u201dI took off the mask I was wearing on my face. There was no point in keeping it on my face since it was broken. The face of a man in his 40s with wrinkles and a beard couldn\u2019t do his part anymore, so I threw it out of the train.\u2018By the way, where is that man?\u2019Rudger, who was appointed as a teacher at Theon Academy, was nowhere to be seen.Immediately after, I realized that when the explosion occurred, the man did not react and he was swept away. A wall was blown away and Rudger was gone without a trace.I leaned my head out slightly and looked down to see a distant cliff. A blizzard still raged below the cliff, and it was covered with foggy snow clouds.\u2018\u2026\u2026He must have died.\u2019If he had known in advance, he could have prepared for it with magic, but unexpected situations always happen. He is a pitiful man, dying on the day he became a teacher at Theon Academy.I silently prayed for Rudger\u2019s well-being.\u2018It\u2019s not the time for me to relax either.\u2019Knowing that these guys are not ordinary robbers, the risk has increased a few times. If all of them use bombs even this sturdy train, protected by magic, might derail.\u2018Maybe derailing the train might be their goal.\u2019Having made a decision, I headed back to the car. At that moment, the door of Car No. 5 opened and the conductor with a very nervous face appeared.\u201cWhat? Customer, are you okay? Gee, what is this..\u2026.\u201dHe was a little perplexed as he saw me standing alone in the hallway next to the wall that had been blown off and stuttered.I answered calmly.\u201cA robber attacked. He was armed with a dangerous bomb and I was almost swept away by the explosion.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d\u201cThey seem to be mainly targeting Vehicle No. 1, so I think it would be better for us to step back.\u201d\u201cMost passengers have been evacuated to the back of the train.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201dI approached the conductor with a relieved face and as soon as the distance was narrowed enough I stretched out my arm and grabbed the conductor by the collar.\u201cWhy, why do you do that?\u201d\u201cDid you think that such fake acting would work in front of me?\u201d\u201cYes, yes?\u201dThe conductor looked at me with a puzzled face. If it had been someone else, this would have erased their doubts, but not me.\u201cI thought something was strange. How can a magic train, which is equipped with magic crystals and protected by strong defensive magic, be infiltrated so easily? Besides we\u2019re going at high speed through the rugged Arete Mountains, how could those people know exactly when to attack?\u201d\u201cThat\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s virtually impossible without having someone on the inside of the train that could turn off the magic that should work.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dAt that moment, the conductor\u2019s face changed. He moved his hand and tried to get something out, but I knew he would and prepared for it.I thrust a sharp knife under his chin.\u201cStay still.\u201d\u201cUgh.\u201d\u201cYou act fast, that means you\u2019re no ordinary robber. Where do you guys come from?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cAre you going to keep your mouth shut? Well, that\u2019s good too.\u201dI wasn\u2019t even curious about it anyway.If my prediction is correct, something might have happened to the 5th vehicle that this guy passed over.\u201cMove!\u201dI held the knife in my right hand at the guy\u2019s neck but the bastard refused to move so twisted his arm a little until he obeyed.\u201cHow many comrades do you have on the train?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cAre you not going to tell me? Then I\u2019ll have to make you talk.\u201dAt that moment a sound was heard from Vehicle No. 5, which the conductor came from.It was a small sound that could not be heard from Vehicle No. 4, where the bulkhead was blown away and the cold gust of wind outside the train blew but my ears we\u2019re extremely alert and caught the sound properly.It\u2019s something I\u2019ve heard a lot of times, metal meets metal.Having reached that point, I threw the conductor forward and immediately fell flat on my seat.Tutatattattattattatta!Shortly afterward, a blast of bullets shot through the door and passed over my head.\u2500\u2500\u2500!The conductor that I pushed out became a beehive. Scattering the debris and powder I covered my head with my hands and looked out the door but the bullets showed no sign of stopping.\u2018Is it a submachine gun? They are very well prepared.\u2019If that\u2019s the case, I\u2019ll have to deal with this one as well.They thought that this was enough, so they stopped shooting.\u2018They shoot without mercy even though their comrade was there and didn\u2019t even let him send any signals.\u2019That means that if they don\u2019t hear from him after a certain time they\u2019ll open fire.\u2018The suicide bombers and now this, it\u2019s obvious these people are crazy.\u2019Why did this happen when I got on this train\u2026 I sighed and stood up.After wiping off the powder and dust from my body, I looked over the door. Soon after, the door was smashed, and three tall men rushed into the hallway.\u201cSomeone is still alive?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you say that anyone would die after that?\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just kill yourself so I don\u2019t have to hear you talking?\u201dI looked at them chattering amongst themselves and said with an annoyed voice.They exchanged glances and then began to approach me. The hallway was narrow enough for only one person to come, so I had to deal with only one person at a time but the other side it\u2019s plump and a lot taller than me. To be honest I didn\u2019t want to fight here because I\u2019m at a disadvantage.\u2018Even if I surrender now they won\u2019t accept it.\u2019Seeing them, it looks like they have no intention to keep me alive.\u201c\u2026\u2026There is one thing I want to ask you.\u201d\u201cWhat? You want to beg for your life now?\u201dNo way.\u201cWith what guts did you attack this train? Is it worth it to throw your lives away? Besides the rescue team will be here soon.\u201d\u201cDo you think your threat will work on us?\u201dThe guy who took the lead at my warning snorted and drew his sword.\u201cI\u2019ll kill you with a single strike.\u201dHe came towards me but I slowly retreated back. However, space was limited and I had to stop. If I go back anymore I\u2019ll fall from the train.\u201cYou have nowhere to go.\u201d\u201cRight.\u201dIf I jump out of the train here, I will be following Rudger\u2019s.\u201cI\u2019m busy, so I\u2019ll finish it as soon as possible!\u201dThe moment he spit those words out and tried to attack me I activated the magic I had prepared in advance.With the sound of the air exploding, the body of the guy who was about to slam his sword at me bounced back like a cannonball. The ones standing behind him didn\u2019t react in time so they we\u2019re thrown to the floor together.\u201cOuch. uh, what\u2026.\u201d\u201cWizard?!\u201dThey didn\u2019t show any signs of being greatly distressed, perhaps because they were quite strong. No, they were wearing something under their clothes. Is it like a protective suit?I released the magical energy I had accumulated and engraved the runes. The three-dimensional figure drawn in the air eventually turned into magic, and in an instant, it became a huge wind and lifted up the guys in the air. It was like an invisible hand was holding them.\u201cUh, huh?\u201d\u201cLet me go! Put me down!\u201d\u201cAs you wish.\u201dI used the wind to move them and threw them out of the train.\u201cSave me! Please!\u201dThey are the ones who attacked the train with the intention to kill everyone so I won\u2019t spare them. After throwing them out of the train their screams echoed and slowly moved away.After dealing with them I pulled out a string from my pocket, tidying up my slightly messy hair. I don\u2019t pay much attention to my appearance, so my hair is quite long, and if I don\u2019t tidy it up in time, it becomes quite cumbersome.\u201cIt\u2019s better now.\u201dI was thinking of running away now, but this time the door of the 3rd car opened and new guys appeared. When you deal with one, another one keeps coming out. There seems to be no end, that\u2019s why I wanted to leave quickly.\u201cWhat is this\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe guys who came over from Car No. 3 looked at the inside of Car No. 4, which was half-destroyed, and me standing alone, and their faces became cold.\u201cKill him!\u201dThe guy who seemed to be the captain gave the order. At the same time, the guys who were waiting pointed their rifles at me.Seeing that scene, I desperately wanted to let out a sigh. What can I do? If I\u2019ve come this far, I have to see the end.\u201cShoot!\u201dThe captain gives orders and his men pull the trigger but the bullets didn\u2019t go out.Clap! Clap!\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\u201cSecond, the gun is broken!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dWhile they were confused I prepared my next magic. However, there was one thing that I overlooked, there was a magician among them too.Paah!The magic I cast is canceled in the air.The wizard, who pointed his wand towards this side, looked at me with a wary gaze.\u201cHe is a wizard.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter he must die as well.\u201dWhat\u2019s wrong with this? You were trying to kill me from the beginning.I\u2019m sure these guys are terrorists, and whatever I say here won\u2019t work. I took the watch out of my pocket and checked the time. Less than 10 minutes had passed since the attack started.\u2018Time is\u2026\u2026still a little lacking.\u2019The scenery passing by outside is still cold and airy. I thought it was very beautiful when I looked through the window, but it became terrifying since a wall was destroyed.There was still time before the train left the Arete Mountains and it will be difficult for the reinforcements to come right away.\u2018I can\u2019t help it.\u2019Considering the location and the time, reinforcements will need at least 5 minutes to arrive.\u2018I have no choice but to persevere.\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They stared at the man left alone in car No. 4 with slightly nervous faces.A black frock coat with gold stitching over a neat suit that clings to the body, long black hair tied at the nape of the neck, those sharp eyes that felt colder than the cold wind blowing outside.His appearance and momentum were unusual. In fact, in his hands, their compatriots who rushed in from the rear of the train were killed.\u2018Who the hell is he?\u2019The terrorist who led the train raid frowned at the man in front of him. He couldn\u2019t understand how such a wizard could be at the board of the train.\u2018No, it doesn\u2019t matter who he is. We have five wizards here.\u2019They recruited a large number of people who learned magic. Even if there is an unknown internal security manpower, it can be wiped out with overwhelming force.He didn\u2019t expect that there would be a wizard, but even if it was, there was only one opponent. They had 5 wizards and their leader, Mayhem, was a 4th-rank wizard.\u2018Unless the opponent is at least a 5th-rank wizard there will be no problem.\u2019There aren\u2019t many wizards on this continent with that much skill and if he had achieved 5th rank or higher at such a young age, rumors would have already spread. At most he could be at the 4th-rank like Mayhem. Maybe the man in front of him knew about it, so he didn\u2019t want to use magic.\u201cHmm\u2026.5 wizards.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s too late for you now.\u201d\u201cThen, I have no choice but to change my method a little.\u201dAfter saying that, the man fluttered the hem of his frock coat and threw himself out of the wrecked train.\u201cUh, huh? Did he jump?\u201d\u201cDid you choose to commit suicide because you thought you couldn\u2019t win?\u201dOne of them, one of the wizards, stuck his head out over the broken bulkhead, but he couldn\u2019t see anything under the distant cliff.\u201cHe must have fallen down and died!\u201d\u201cI thought he would do something, but he was just a coward.\u201dThe moment everyone was about to come to that conclusion.Pussack!A flash of light pierced the head of the wizard, who was looking down. His body, which lost balance, leaned forward and fell out of the train.\u201cWhat?!\u201d\u201cHanson is dead!\u201d\u201cWhere did the flash just come from?\u201dWhile everyone was puzzled, Mayhem, the leader of the wizards, twisted his face and looked up.\u201cHe\u2019s on the roof!\u201d\u201cOn the train? But didn\u2019t he jumped down a little while ago?\u201d\u201cDid he use flying magic?\u201d\u201cIs it possible to catch up and get on a moving train with flying magic?!\u201d\u201cHurry up and chase him!\u201d* * *\u2018I was going to eliminate another one while they were distracted.\u2019Loud noises came from below. Now that they realized I\u2019m alive they will try to kill me with all their might.I pretended to jump, hung from the wall, and then climbed right up to make them lose their vigilance.I can\u2019t help but be satisfied with taking one of the five wizards.\u201cGo up!\u201d\u201cKill him!\u201dA voice echoed through the car, and then one by one they started climbing up the ladder to the roof, but it won\u2019t be that easy.I fired a magical energy at them, turned my back and ran towards the vehicle behind me. Those who tried to climb up had no choice but to descend again due to an attack passing overhead.Thump thump thump.As I ran and made noise on purpose the people waiting in the vehicle heard the sound and followed me.\u201cHe\u2019s going to the back of the train!\u201d\u201cChase!\u201dThey easily followed me. I guess getting rid of one wizard seemed to have a pretty big effect.Even if they risk their lives and commit suicide, does it mean that it is unacceptable for a colleague to die at the hands of others? It is indeed a contradictory attitude.\u2018If you become emotional like this, I will be more grateful.\u2019* * *The terrorists split in half to catch the wizard who escaped to the rear of the train. After all, even if the opponent is a wizard he\u2019s not their target.Except for a few who will assist the wizards, the rest decided to aim for the first class of the first vehicle that has not yet been penetrated. The wizards headed to the rear and the other group to the front.\u201cDamn! Where is he?\u201d\u201cIs anyone on the roof? Why don\u2019t you say anything?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go back!\u201dThey opened the door in a hurry.\u2018Quaaang!\u2019The door exploded and a bright red flame engulfed the terrorists. In an instant, the five of them turned into black charcoal and fell to the ground.The magical flame went out like a candle after it had faithfully performed its role.\u201cWicked bastard!\u201d\u201cTo set a trap in front of the door!\u201dThe wizard\u2019s leader, Mayhem, wept as he looked at the corpses of his dead compatriots.\u2018Did you magically set up a trap in front of the door in that short time?\u2019His swiftness was astounding, but what made him even more nervous was his opponent\u2019s behavior. Usually, the wizards from noble families he knows are extremely reluctant to move because of their arrogance since birth.When they use magic, they always stand in the open as if to show off their magic. But the man he\u2019s following now didn\u2019t.\u2018I feel like the situation is unfavorable, so I immediately run away, and then, after arousing the other person\u2019s carelessness, I attack. There is no way this is the way of a normal wizard.\u2019Rather than being a wizard, this move was closer to a mercenary or hunter.\u2018What the hell is this guy\u2026\u2026\u2019At first, he thought that a sorcerer who killed his compatriots. After all, most of the people on this train were either nobles or wealthy merchants. They are all sucking the blood of poor commoners and standing on it.\u2018But he\u2019s different.\u2019Mayhem, who was worried, opened his mouth with a more heavy expression on his face.\u201cEveryone be careful. From now on, we take the lead. We don\u2019t know what trap he may have placed, so move as carefully as possible.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dWith Mayhem in the lead, the wizards took the lead and moved while checking if there were any traps installed in the hallways or walls. As a result, a considerable amount of time was consumed.\u201cDon\u2019t be in a hurry. After all, he can\u2019t get off the end of the train.\u201dThe wizard\u2019s leader, Mayhem, was walking slowly and suddenly stopped. She felt a sense of alienation that could not be described in words and quickly realized the reason.Rumble!A loud noise echoed from the end of the train. The slow-moving terrorists instinctively knew something was wrong the moment they heard the sound.\u201cAh! He disconnected the train and ran away!\u201dIt was too late to stop him. In the first place, the opponent did not have to fight them. It was enough to just run away and waste their time after deliberately he raised their awareness with his trap.\u201cChase! Don\u2019t let him run away!\u201dThey are now in a hurry, and have no choice but to chase and kill the sorcerer who has fled.They hurriedly ran through the train, and eventually arrived at the nose of the last vehicle, No. 12. When they opened the door, all they saw was the snow-capped mountain range and railroad tracks, not the scene of Vehicle 12, which should have been there.Mayhem clenched his teeth.\u2018I made a mistake. He kept reminding us that he didn\u2019t have to fight us.\u2019He overlooked an important fact.Who would have expected that the opponent would run away with such a determination?\u201cDamn, did I miss it?\u201d\u201cI will definitely find you and kill you.\u201dWhile everyone was clenching their teeth and stared outside Mayhem felt a surge of powerful magic behind his back.\u201cWhat is this\u2026\u2026.\u201dHe hurriedly turned his head and looked back and saw the figure of the man who should have disappeared with the detached vehicle No. 12.\u201cWhy are you here\u2026\u2026\u201dBut it wasn\u2019t the man\u2019s existence that mattered. The most important thing to pay attention to is the magic that was completed in front of him, almost before it was activated. It was a very ferocious and dangerous type of elemental magic.\u201cAvoid it!\u201dMayhem cried out and raised his magic power as much as possible to create a barrier of strong magical power.Immediately afterward, a huge magic engulfed the entire vehicle No. 11 and swept the interior like a storm. The pure white flame swept away all the terrorists who had not yet evacuated or responded.* * *\u201cIs it over?\u201dI muttered as I watched the magical flames gradually disappear.They thought I was going to run away in Vehicle 12, and they were focused on it. Everyone would have thought so since I used a trap to buy time and detached vehicle 12.In the end, running away was nothing more than a deceptive tactic to deceive them. Thanks to that, I was able to gather them all in one place and deal with them at once.\u2018It seems that there are still guys left in the leading vehicle, but it doesn\u2019t matter since I\u2019ve dealt with all the wizards.\u2019As I was thinking, something rose from the rubble.\u201cYou were still alive.\u201d\u201dBoy\u2026\u2026.\u201dIt was the leader who led the wizards who got up. At that moment, perhaps he had defended himself with a barrier and escaped the explosion but his physical condition was so disastrous that he was barely alive.He couldn\u2019t completely block the explosion and his face was half melted, while his whole body was burnt, even one of his arms was missing.\u201cWhy the hell did you kill them? Isn\u2019t it pitiful for our compatriots who are working hard for the world?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dWhat the heck did he say, isn\u2019t this a very naive bullshit? When I shut my mouth in bewilderment, he looked at me with angry eyes.\u201cDon\u2019t you feel sorry for the people who died at your hands?\u201d\u201cI thought that you were crazy from the beginning, but you were crazier than I thought.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about when you attack the train and kill all the passengers?\u201dThese guys raided the train and killed the passengers there on sight. Now they treat me like a bad guy because their co-workers are dead, honestly, it\u2019s just annoying.\u201cEven if they died, they were cheap!\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you the one who tried to kill me in the first place? We already have to kill each other, so what are you talking about now?\u201d\u201cThat\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIf I couldn\u2019t kill you, I would have to die.\u201d\u201cYou boy\u2026\u2026Who the hell are you?\u201dHe gave up arguing and asked about my identity but I couldn\u2019t answer because I saw countless shadows flying towards me from the outside.Even in the midst of a raging blizzard, the sound of drawing a sword is eerily heard. A white light flashed through the wide open back door and cut the wizard in half.A solid line is drawn from the head to the groin and the moment the pure white shadow jumped over the wizard and landed on the ground, his body split apart and he fell to the side.No blood flowed from his body because the cut section was frozen with pure white ice. Behind the fallen corpse a knight with a white cloak fluttering appeared.\u201cAre you okay?\u201dI answered with a nod of my head.The pattern on the shoulder strap is in the shape of a pure white eagle. It was a mark of the Border Guard Knights in charge of protecting the empire.\u201cDon\u2019t worry we will deal with them.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They are powerful enough to catch up with a running horse on two legs and crush rocks with their leg strength.They were the knights in charge of the most rugged section of the Exilion Empire.\u201cAaaah!\u201d\u201cThe Empire\u2019s Border Guard! Everyone run away!\u201d\u201cHelp me!\u201dThe terrorist\u2019s screams echoed everywhere, they stood no chance against the border guards.* * *\u2018Is it over?\u2019The Cold Steel Knights under the Border Guard Corps.It may not seem like a big deal just by hearing the name, but as it is made up of those who work in this rugged and cold Arete Mountains, meaning that every member is an elite.I returned to room 403, which was still intact and stumped in my seat. The inside of the train was full of cuts and marks that remained from the fierce battle.Fortunately, a defensive magic circle was engraved on them; if it had been an ordinary train, it would have already derailed and fell down the cliff.\u201cWe have subjugated all the thieves, so please rest assured. The train will arrive soon, so please wait for a while.\u201dKnights were seen walking around the inside of the train, calming the survivors. In fact, even if they were survivors, they were all first-class people who were protected in the safest place.It was hard to find survivors except for the 1st cabin, everyone else was practically annihilated.It was unfortunate even considering the small number of people on the train.\u2018I\u2019m glad they got rid of all the terrorists though.\u2019All those who attacked the train were killed by the knights. For bringing so many wizards, it was truly a vain result.\u2018Ah. I\u2019m the one who killed the wizards.\u2019Now is not the time for me to worry about that.Soon the train will arrive at its destination. As it passed the mountain range covered in pure white snow, fresh vegetation began to appear sporadically. The icy mountain range disappeared and was replaced by a wide plain.What was visible beyond the horizon was Leathervelk, one of the major cities of the Exilion Empire.\u2018Big.\u2019Even though it is far away, the majesty of the city is enough to be seen at a glance. Buildings soaring high like towers towards the sky, factory chimneys constantly spewing white smoke and even large flying boats fluttering among the clouds dyed with light.Mechanical boats made of windmills and brass are lined up above the river that runs through the city, and steamships move quickly between them.Magical engineering created by combining advanced mechanical engineering with magic. The civilization it has achieved is very similar to the so-called \u2018Steam Punk\u2019.\u2018Now that I\u2019m here, it\u2019s not really surprising.\u2019Still, I couldn\u2019t erase the strange feeling that the sense of disparity created by the memories of my previous life disappeared.I died in an accident in my previous life, and when I woke up, I was shocked to find out that I was reborn as a baby in this world but that was already 27 years ago.The years have gone by so quickly.This world is a unique world of the Victorian era and what is commonly called the Belle \u00c9poque, where magic, sub-races and monsters exist.I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because I\u2019ve entered the world of a game or a novel I liked\u2026\u2026This is a different world that doesn\u2019t even exist in my memory, literally without any connection.\u201cAre you okay?\u201dSomeone spoke to me as I sat still and stared at the approaching destination. When I turned my head, I noticed neat black hair at the entrance to the half-broken room. Was it the woman who saved me?She was looking at this with worried eyes.\u201cWas it possible that some kind of harm was done to you by the terrorists a while ago?\u201dI immediately shook my head.\u201cNo. Thanks to the knights\u2019 help nothing happened to me. I was just thinking about something.\u201d\u201cAh. If so, I\u2019m glad.\u201dIt was like a rose blossomed when she smiled.She was quite a beauty, pure white skin and white armor without blemishes. Contrasting black hair further accentuated her strong image. She is a good person with no ambiguity in her personality. Otherwise she wouldn\u2019t have been worried for someone like me.Being a member of the Cold Steel Knights at such a young age means she is a genius. I felt like I was living in a different world.\u201cMy name is Veronica Deville. What about you?\u201dDeville.I\u2019ve heard of it. It\u2019s said to be a prestigious company that produced many famous knights in the empire.\u201cI am\u2026\u2026\u201dPaaaaang\u2014!!!As I was about to say my name, the train blew his horn to signal its arrival.I shut my mouth, and Veronica turned her head to look outside.\u201cWe have finally arrived at Leathervelk.\u201dThe train, which slowed down slowly, came to a complete stop at the train station.The station seen through the window was crowded with people. It seems that people had come to take a look after hearing the news that the train had been attacked. When they saw the appearance of the broken train, they started talking among themselves.The police stepped forward and built a wall to prevent people from approaching, and there were also reporters trying to get a scoop through the cracks.Like a big city, Leathervelk was crowded from the start.\u201cThere are so many people. It seems that the news has already spread.\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201dBecause it has nothing to do with me anyway.If there is one thing I regret now, it\u2019s that this train, which was originally supposed to go to the capital, had to stop at Leathervelk due to the attack. However, there was no way to get a refund for the tickets I had already paid, so I had no choice but to get off here.Swoosh.At that moment, the closed door swung open and police officers in uniform rushed in.What happened all of a sudden?\u201cPassengers, please do not leave and wait in your seat. I have something to check.\u201d\u201cWhat is this?\u201dWhen Veronica asked, one of the cops asked.\u201cWho are you?\u201d\u201cMy name is Veronica from the Cold Steel Knights. I\u2019d like to ask how the hell this happened.\u201d\u201cAh, you were a Knight of the Cold Steel Knights. Nice to meet you, I am Officer Remlus from the Leathervelk Metropolitan Police Agency.\u201d\u201cYes, Officer Remlus, nice to meet you. So what is this?\u201d\u201cI heard the train was attacked in the Arete mountains.\u201d\u201cYes, that is correct. We took care of all the raiders.\u201d\u201cThank you for your hard work but there\u2019s something suspicious in the report we received.\u201d\u201cSuspicious\u201dAt those words, I became anxious, but then something caught my eye.\u201cEven though there were wizards among the raiders, there was no way that a magic train protected by magic would be so easily attacked.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cIt is clear that there was someone from the inside involved as well.\u201d\u201cThat\u2026\u201dVeronica\u2019s eyes widened in surprise but she nodded her head and agreed with the officer\u2019s words.His assumption was correct, I actually ran into a guy who disguised himself as a train employee and dispelled the magical veil from the inside. It made it easy for the terrorists to get into the train, and the passengers inside were killed.\u201cSome of the survivors might be working with the terrorists so we\u2019re just trying to verify their identities. Don\u2019t worry too much. Those whose identities have been verified will be sent back immediately.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dVeronica said and looked back at this side with a smile. Her smile was full of relief, but a cold sweat ran down my back.They\u2019re verifying identities but my mask is gone. I gently stroked my face with my fingertips.\u2018This is a big deal\u2026!\u2019I was on this train as a wealthy merchant in his mid-40s named Gerard. Naturally, a person named Gerard would be listed on the list of passengers. That\u2019s fine, but the problem is my face right now.How can this face without a beard or wrinkles belong to someone in their mid-forties?\u2018\u2026 What should I do?\u2019I did not lead the terrorist attack and I was a passenger who was unfairly involved, but I couldn\u2019t be proud of it either.Gerard is a fake identity to hide my identity and fake identity is a felony in any country.If I\u2019m lucky enough I might be hanged, but there\u2019s a high possibility that I would be subjected to severe torture since I\u2019m suspected of terrorism. If I was a normal person there would be no need to change my identity.Should I run away?\u2018No.\u2019Now, there are Cold Steel Knights on this train, and even the Imperial soldiers are spread outside the train just in case. The moment I try to run away from here, I\u2019ll be dead in less than a minute.Running away is the worst option. But if I stand still, my identity will be revealed.I tried not to show my anxiety.Meanwhile, the police brought documents and were trying to compare them with the people in the train.I was asked.\u201cIn what room were you staying?\u201d\u201cNumber 403, here\u2019s my ticket.\u201dI calmly took out a train ticket from my inner pocket and showed it to the officer. After confirming that the ticket was not a fake, he shuffled through the documents immediately.\u2026\u201d403, here it is. Two guests stayed in the room. Rudger Chelici, a man in his mid 20\u2019s and Gerard, a man in his 40s.\u201dThen he lifts his head and glances at me. It was like asking why you are alone when there are two of you.\u201cWhy are you alone?\u201d\u201cGerard was swept away by an explosion during and fell down a remote cliff in the Arete Mountains.\u201dHe fell down the cliff of that rugged mountain range, so even his body would not be found.My words made the police even more suspicious. I clenched my fists, and desperately kept my expressionless face.If I go on like this I\u2019ll be caught. But that doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s no way out of this situation.\u2018Escape? It\u2019s impossible in the first place.\u2019And another problem is Veronica, the woman with a fluttering white cloak in front of me. She is the woman who, not long ago, had split in half a terrorist.She had no hesitation in killing people.She\u2019s smiling at me now, but when it turns out that I\u2019m suspicious, she\u2019ll be the first to draw her sword. Considering her ability to join the Cold Steel Knights at a young age, she must be much more intimidating than the police outside the train.All sorts of thoughts were swirling around in my head.Veronica, who had been silently watching the situation, stepped forward.\u201cWait. He was not a suspect in the first place.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cBecause he was fighting terrorists before our Cold Steel Knights arrived. I saw it with my own two eyes.\u201d\u201cDid you fight?\u201dThe officer mumbled in disbelief and looked over the list again. Then he nodded his head as if he had understood something, and looked back at me with a changed face.\u201cThen it means that Mr. Rudger Chelici is alive, and Mr. Gerard died in the explosion.\u201d\u2026uh?No wait. What now?The face of the officer, who was checking the list more closely, was astonished.\u201cHuh? You are a new teacher who has been assigned to the Theon Academy?!\u201d\u201cTheon teacher? Really?\u201dAt the cry of Officer Remlus, Veronica also widened her eyes.Watching the two people\u2019s reactions, like a scene from a comedy, I realized how things were going. It was really unbelievable, but\u2026\u2026They believed I was Rudger. It was so sudden, but I made a quick decision.I immediately regained my composure and nodded.\u201cYes. That\u2019s right.\u201dI picked up the suitcase that Rudger had dropped before he died. It was a good idea to have it ready in advance, just in case.\u201cI am Rudger Chelici.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Most of the photos exist only in black and white and the quality is not very good, so detailed comparison is impossible.When comparing people, in the end, they have no choice but to rely on clothes, age, and overall physique. It was not unreasonable that they were mistaken.\u2018I\u2019m sorry. Mr. Rudger.\u2019It\u2019s a pity for the dead, but that doesn\u2019t mean I can die too, right? The living must live.Rudger\u2019s status was very helpful in escaping this situation.\u201cUnbelievable. You were a new teacher at Theon Academy. The magic I saw back then..\u2026\u201dThe moment the name Theon appeared, Veronica\u2019s voice toward me changed.Did she see me using magic? Maybe that\u2019s why I gained her trust even more.Even the officer who was half-doubting me and who was about to interrogate me immediately nodded his head.\u201cPlease forgive me for being rude because of the circumstances.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201dEven as I said that, I thought to myself that the name Theon was really great.The only magic academy that exists in the Empire, and even on the continent, the best academy is Theon.The name \u2018Theon\u2019 was never taken lightly, and it was natural for them to be surprised when they heard that I was a teacher there.\u201cYou\u2019re a Theon teacher.\u201d\u201cAt such a young age, that\u2019s great.\u201dThe other guards and the police also whispered among themselves.Whatever happened, I decided to act more shamelessly. From this moment, I will become Rudger Chelici.\u201cI, we will guide you to the exit.\u201d\u201cFine.\u201d\u201cYou are one of those who will nurture the future of the empire, how could we let it go? You were wasting your time because of us.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d\u201cIt is because we are sorry.\u201dNo, moving with you guys is inconvenient!I couldn\u2019t say those words, so I accepted with a blunt face.\u201cMs. Veronica, it was a short meeting, but it was nice.\u201dIt was a short meeting, but I don\u2019t think it was bad. She smiled and waved her hand at me, perhaps thinking the same thing.\u201cYes, Mr. Rudger! See you later if you have time!\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dI\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll see each other again in the future.Guided by the guards, I was able to safely escape the crowd to the exit of the train station. It was a train station with a lot of people coming and going, so the exit was also crowded with people.I opened my mouth thinking that this was it.\u201cIt is enough to have come this far. From here on, I will move on my own. More than that, I feel burdened.\u201d\u201cAh yes!\u201dThe guard saluted me and then disappeared back into the station.I greeted him with a light bow, and let out a sigh.Seriously, it would have been a big mess. I\u2019m glad the other side misunderstood me for a moment, otherwise, my fake identity would have been exposed and I would have been accused of being an accomplice in terrorism.Now that the emergency is over, I\u2019ll be fine.\u201cAre you Mr. Rudger Chelici?\u201dAt that moment, I could feel my blood freezing coldly at the sound of a voice coming from behind me.When I slowly turned my head to look back, I saw an old gentleman with a rather stern posture looking at me.I calmed my startled heart and answered calmly.\u201cYes. That\u2019s right. Who are you?\u201d\u201cHello. My name is Wilford, a user of Theon Academy. I came to meet Mr. Rudger.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Do you mean pick up? Me?\u201d\u201cYes. I heard that the train was attacked. I came to see you in a hurry to see if something had happened, but I\u2019m really glad that you seem to be okay.\u201dWilford said so, and he opened the door of the carriage next to him.\u201cGet in.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dI rolled my eyes. Can I say that I\u2019m the wrong person?I don\u2019t know when that old man named Wilford got here but I\u2019m sure he saw me with the officer. It is practically impossible to pretend that I\u2019m someone else and refuse. Above all else, there was no sign of presence when he first appeared, this man is no ordinary user.\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201dI had no choice but to get into the carriage.* * *Veronica, the deputy commander of the Knights of Cold Steel, remembered the departed Rudger.\u2018Rudger Chelici.\u2019From the first time I saw him, I thought he was unusual because I saw him sweeping away all terrorists with pure white flames.The other knights might not have been able to see well because they were far away, but she was confident that she had better eyesight than the general.In a situation where he was outnumbered Rudger defeated the opposing wizards easily.\u2018He\u2019s not an ordinary person.\u2019A simple yet gorgeous black frock coat with a neat suit and golden thread over it, a reticent impression and serious eyes, the long hair slightly pulled back, from the nape of the neck into a ponytail.Looking closely he seemed like a nobleman with a sharp impression but above all, what stimulated her nerves the most was the spirit that subtly emanated from Rudger.\u2018At first I thought it was a royal family member who hid his identity.\u2019The elegance that emanated from Rudger was similar to what Veronica felt when she faced the nobles in the imperial court. So when she was told that Rudger was going to be a teacher at the Theon Academy, she was convinced of his identity.No, she even thought that even the huge name of Theon would not be a medal for this man. No one marvels at fish swimming well and birds flying through the sky. The same was true for Rudger\u2019s position as Theon.Her strong sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu became certain when she heard his name.\u2018Rudger Chelici, a young wizard with a lot of fame recently. He was the youngest to achieve the fourth rank, submitted 12 papers to the Mato, and even redefined one of the most difficult things: Langerister\u2019s formula.\u2019Other than that, I heard that he had a history of serving as an officer in the military, and it is said that he majored in cryptid hunting.\u2018My younger brother is attending Thorn. I\u2019ll have to ask him how are the classes he\u2019s teaching.\u2019* * *My plan to run away as soon as I left the train station was thwarted from the start. I didn\u2019t expect the academy would send someone directly to pick me up here. I thought it was too much of an exaggeration, but the fact that it was the Theon Academy convinced me again.If you are a teacher assigned to the best academy in the empire, you will be welcomed wherever you go. Hearing that such high-quality manpower was involved in the terrorist attack, Theon must have been worried.\u2018It\u2019s a big deal.\u2019I looked inside the carriage.A soft red chair and colorful patterns around it. No matter how I look at it, it was a carriage that could only be thought of as luxurious. There is almost no vibration even when it\u2019s going so fast.Leading this black chariot was a golem in the form of a steaming horse. It was simply amazing to see this vehicle, one of the latest magical engineering results, made with a half-mix of machine and magic.Knights don\u2019t get old easily just because they age. Rather, the old knights are more dangerous because they have superhuman bodies and years of experience.\u2018If I try to leave here with an excuse, he\u2019ll get suspicious. I can\u2019t run away secretly, and even if I succeed, I\u2019ll be tracked down as soon as a report comes in.\u2019A number of other problems arose.First of all, it is about the identity of Gerard that I used to use. Since this fake identity was effectively treated as dead, it was necessary to create a new identity and that would require a lot of time and money.Usually I would find a place to stay until I gather information and create a new identity since having lost my existing identity, means I am an illegal immigrant. The absence of an identity is no different from the absence of human rights.After considering all these possibilities, I decided to give up running away for now.\u2018For now, I\u2019ll not do anything that will make me suspicious.\u2019First, let\u2019s go to Theon Academy. It wouldn\u2019t be a bad idea to think about the future there.When the speed of the fast-moving carriage slowed down, I had a gut feeling that I had finally arrived at the Theon Academy.As if to prove that, the carriage\u2019s front window swung open to the side, and Wilford spoke up.\u201cMr. Rudger, we\u2019re here.\u201dAt Wilford\u2019s words, I glanced at the scenery outside the window. The first thing I saw was a grand gate and beyond that was a vast expanse of land. The road for carriages was paved neatly and green trees were evenly planted to the left and right, adding to the refined beauty.In the dazzling sunlight, the buildings of the Theon Academy shone white.\u2018Are those the main building, the villa, the park, and the auditorium?\u2019Apart from the fact that each one was large in scale, it was not possible to estimate exactly how wide the site was.\u2018Isn\u2019t this bigger than any other city?\u2019The security guard at the front gate opened it immediately and bowed lightly toward us.Passing through the front door, I could see how much magic was engraved in the vicinity. The number of magic circles stacked on top of each other was so great that the original shape could not be seen.\u2018Crazy.\u2019There won\u2019t be any big guys coming through the front gate, but if there\u2019s really a guy like that, it will turn to dust and disappear in a second.The place where the steel horse leading the carriage stopped was a building further inside than the main building. Soaring high like a crown, it was truly a magnificent castle.\u201cIt\u2019s here. Get off.\u201dAs I was about to get my bag, Wilford stopped me.\u201cWe\u2019ll come back, so you don\u2019t have to carry your luggage with you.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201dI got out of the carriage and followed Wilford past the fountain and the beautiful statues into the building. The inside was just as spectacular as the outside.The light from the glass window spreads like a soft reflection inside, creating a warm color and gently wrapping the skin. A fragrant smell from somewhere tickles my nose, and I hear the chirping of birds. It felt like a dream.The interior has a refined and neat design, looking like the beautiful architecture of medieval Europe. If the adjacent city Leathervelk has a steampunk atmosphere full of steam, this one is much more focused on fantasy.-Hahaha.\u2013 Baby, don\u2019t do it.As I went up the stairs along Wilford, users and students in academy uniforms passed me by. Every time they do that, I can hear them having a conversation behind me, so I guess they\u2019re gossiping because I look like a country peasant, right?Eventually, I arrived in front of a large elevator.\u201cCome this way.\u201dI boarded the elevator with Wilford. I thought it was high from the outside, but seeing it was almost 30 stories high, I was surprised once again.When the elevator arrived and the door opened, there was a long hallway covered with red carpet and a single door made of wood at the end.\u201cThe President is inside. I will be waiting here.\u201d\u201cThanks for the guidance.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s my job.\u201dI crossed the hallway and stood in front of the door to the president\u2019s office. Just as I raised my hand to knock on the door, I heard a languid yet alluring voice from inside.\u201cCome in.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dI opened the door and went inside.\u201cNice to meet you.\u201dA woman sitting at her desk with her back against the window greeted me.Considering that she has to be a lexer who is at least a 6th rank among the existing 8th ranks to be able to sit in this position, she is an undisputed first-class wizard.She had just been organizing papers, and was holding a fountain pen in her right hand, put it down aloud and stared at me. Her white hair, flowing down like a curtain, shines even more dazzlingly in the light of the glass window behind her. The hair on the outside is white, but the inside is a two-tone hair that is subtly tinged with pink.\u2018What.\u2019The moment her golden eyes turned towards me, I felt an indescribable feeling.I said in a hard voice, trying to ignore the strange sensation.\u201cThis is Rudger Chelici. The president has called me.\u201dFirst of all, I am now Rudger Chelici.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Are you alright? I was told that you were involved in a terrorist incident.\u201d\u201cIt was nothing special. I got help from the Cold Steel Knights at a dangerous moment.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s really nice. I was pretty terrified too. You\u2019re a new teacher I\u2019ve been looking for with a lot of effort, but I was wondering what to do if you got hurt. If that happens, our face won\u2019t stand up, right?\u201dSeeing her openly commenting on the school face, she certainly doesn\u2019t seem like an ordinary person.Everyone who has ascended to a high position is bound to be twisted somewhere, especially if you\u2019re a member of a wizard\u2019s family.My master was the same and so it\u2019s this woman in front of me. It wasn\u2019t too surprising.\u201cAre you not feeling well?\u201dSeeing the president staring at me with a soft smile in her eyes, I wondered if she realized something. Come to think of it, has the Chancellor ever met Rudger before?As anxious thoughts passed by, her voice awakened my thoughts.This is the first time I\u2019ve seen you in person, but you\u2019re pretty tall.\u201dFortunately, it seemed that this was the first time that \u2018Rudger\u2019 had actually met the president.I answered with a sigh of relief.\u201cThank you for the compliment, even if it\u2019s empty words.\u201d\u201cNope, it\u2019s not empty words. The students\u2019 reaction to such a handsome teacher will be positive, right?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s overrated.\u201d\u201cOkay, take this first.\u201dThe president handed me a piece of paper.\u201cIt was announced in advance, but it\u2019s good to have a thorough contract. The contract period is 2 years and the pay is as written there. Food and drink are provided automatically, so be aware.\u201dI accepted the contract and looked at the contents carefully.Anyway, the moment the preliminary status came out, I was going to throw it away and leave, so I didn\u2019t take it too seriously until I read it.\u2018Uh, what is it? Wait a minute.\u2019What was written in the contract was so surprising that it made my eyes widen.\u2018A month\u2019s salary is 30 imperial gold coins?\u2019One imperial gold coin is equivalent to 1 million denars in the continent\u2019s common currency, \u2018denar\u2019.In other words, 30 imperial gold coins means 30 million denars, this was a huge sum of nearly 300 million won on Earth in my previous life.At this point, I had no doubt about the power of Theon academy.It was the best magic academy in the empire. Even in the district where I lived, the annual salary of a lecturer at Gangnam Academy was not even 10 billion won.\u2018And there is a bonus for each semester, and another bonus at the end of the year? Is it even possible to increase pay based on performance? If students\u2019 evaluations of faculty and staff are good, the salary will increase?\u2019If the teacher does really well and gets good evaluations then together with the bonuses the annual salary will become over 500 million denars.The contract period is two years, and in total, more than 1 billion denars. With this money, I could go anywhere and make a living. I could even do a side job if I get a permit.\u2018Gulp.\u2019I swallowed saliva without realizing it.It\u2019s amazing that the salary is like this, but the subsidy when conducting classes is huge. Even more subsidies may come out depending on teacher evaluation.In addition to that, I can find a house separately and eat here, so I don\u2019t have to spend money on anything else.\u2018If I survive for two years, I would get 1 billion denars. In terms of Earth money, that\u2019s a whopping 10 billion won at a minimum. If I do well, I can even increase my salary, and I can also extend it after the contract is over.\u2019This contract was crazy. Is this the best academy in the empire?The life I\u2019ve lived so far\u2026\u201cHow is it?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Not bad.\u201dThis is awesome.I took a deep breath and read the contract again. But there was a fundamental problem.\u2018It is true that Theon is great enough to give me this amount of money, but at the same time, I also have a considerable sense of weight as a teacher.\u2019Will I be able to bear the seat?In this place where geniuses were thriving would I be able to work properly as a teacher?\u2018No way. It would be rather a miracle that my lowliness didn\u2019t show up in one day.\u2019Still, I\u2019m confident in my mouth and bluffing ability, because I grew up in an environment where I could die if I didn\u2019t.I quickly shook my head and analyzed the situation.\u2018The salary alone is attractive, but it is burdensome. I can\u2019t refuse because I\u2019ve already come this far. Rudger has already become a teacher here and I became Rudger Chelici.\u2019Can I say no in this situation in the first place?My appointment as a teacher has already been confirmed, and I can\u2019t suddenly say that I won\u2019t do it now or else people would get suspicious.In fact, the answer I had to give was already decided.\u2018I have no choice but to do it.\u2019I have now made up my mind on how to use Rudger Chelici identity.\u2018Just close your eyes and survive here for two years.\u2019In two years, this life could be over, they would give me a lot of money and I would be free to leave, so isn\u2019t this better than the military?Thinking that way made me feel at ease.I handed the contract to the president and opened my mouth.\u201cI checked everything.\u201d\u201cThen I wish you all the best in the future. Mr. Rudger.\u201d\u201cYes. I will leave it up to you president.\u201dI shook hands with the president who smiled towards me.I was very happy but I tried my best to maintain my expressionless face.* * *After meeting with the president, I followed the guidance of Mr. Wilford, who was waiting outside, and headed to my assigned dormitory.Should they really call it Theon Academy?Even the teacher-only building on the site looks expensive.I couldn\u2019t believe that the two-story house I saw in a fairy tale was my home.\u201cThere are still three weeks left until the start of the class, so you can rest until then.\u201dAfter saying those words, Mr. Wilford led the carriage again and disappeared. He did not forget his modest attitude even when he left. He was truly a model gentleman.\u2018Shall I go?\u2019Packing my suitcase, I entered the house. I saw it from the outside, but when I went inside, it felt very different. The furniture was also equipped with all sorts of things, and there was no dust to be seen due to regular maintenance.I checked the bathroom just in case, and was surprised again. The bathroom was filled with pure white tiles and looked like something aristocrats would use. There is water and even a bathtub where I can take a bubble bath.After checking every corner of the house, I sat down on a soft sofa.\u2018From now on, I will be an academy teacher\u2026\u2026\u2019So many things happened today.I was unintentionally involved in a terrorist attack, mistaken for someone else, and even came to the Theon Academy to work as a teacher.It\u2019s just a wonder how the heck it came to be like this, but since I\u2019ve come this far, I can\u2019t escape.If I suddenly disappear my Rudger identity will be under suspicion and I\u2019ll have no place in the Empire since my real face was seen.In the end, I had no choice but to act as Rudger Chelsea.\u201cWhoa. It\u2019s hard.\u201dIt has been 27 years since I came to this world.I was reincarnated in this world with no special abilities and only memories of my previous life. However, the existence of my parents in the present life was so daunting that in the end, I had to survive on my own.My life was strange and I had to overcome crises of death several times while getting caught up in all kinds of events.For me, the current situation is just embarrassing. How did I end up as an academy teacher? And even at the best academy in the Empire.\u2018This is actually a fake job.\u2019I wasn\u2019t even aiming for it, but that doesn\u2019t mean I can stop now.The moment I get out of here, I\u2019ll be eaten by a tiger. That was my situation now.\u2018Okay 2 years. I only have to survive 2 years. That\u2019s enough.\u2019I also needed a new identity so in this situation being Rudger was very attractive. Rudger Chelici is a man who crossed over to the Empire from a distant land. Here he will never run into anyone who knows him.I decided to find out a little more about the person called Rudger, just in case.I grabbed the suitcase and climbed into the bedroom on the second floor. When I entered the room, I put the curtains on the window and looked carefully inside the room to check for any unexpected external surveillance.\u2018Nothing caught.\u2019I opened the suitcase right away because I thought it was okay now.\u2018Rattle.\u2019\u201cHmm?\u201dIs it locked?I carefully checked the suitcase made of leather. Upon closer inspection, a fine magic circle was engraved on the metal lock.\u2018This\u2026\u2026It\u2019s security magic.\u2019Although the scale is not large, it was a magic circle with a high level of difficulty, which requires detailed mana management, to be engraved in this place.\u2018Is this because he\u2019s a teacher assigned to the Theon Academy?\u2019Stepping away from the suitcase, I pondered how to do this. It wasn\u2019t that I gave up, it was to devise a way to open it.\u2018It would be convenient if there was a reagent, but the existing luggage has been mailed in advance, so I have no choice but to use another method.\u2019I took a towel and wet it with water in moderation. Having set aside the wet towel, I grabbed a stick and started a small fire at the end.I used \u201cPyro,\u201d which could be said to be a basic elemental magic. It is only about the size of a lighter flame, but its heat is considerable.I brought the fire from the end of the stick to the clasp of the suitcase. The scorching heat began to heat the brass. A few minutes later, as the brass heats up and turns red, I grab the wet towel.The heated metal cooled rapidly with the sound of water evaporating. Instantly, the lock was twisted, and the magic circle engraved on it was also twisted.Of course, doing this doesn\u2019t make the magic circle\u2019s effect disappear. Because magic isn\u2019t that easy.\u2018But I can make a momentary gap in a strong wall.\u2019Without missing the moment, I shot my magic sharply and pierced the center of the magic circle, an important part that can be called \u2018core\u2019 in the magic circle.\u2018Paching!\u2019\u2018Done.\u2019When it was destroyed, the effect of the magic circle disappeared. At the same time, the lock opened with a click sound.\u2018Opening this was a piece of cake.\u2019It is not uncommon to have a magic circle or barrier engraved on a suitcase like this. Most wizards are very sensitive to security, so security magic is close to basic knowledge.If you can\u2019t open it yourself, you can even ask an acquaintance or a professional engraving company.If someone tries to forcibly remove the security magic, discarding of the contents is activated. It was a demonstration of the extreme ideology unique to wizards that they would rather destroy their data than have it revealed.However, in order to safely disarm the security magic, it is necessary to analyze the magic to see how it is implemented. Naturally, the process took a very long time, and I couldn\u2019t afford to do that.So this method was chosen. A method close to trickery that does not require analysis of magic.\u2018It is enough to know where the magic circle was engraved and its material.\u2019Usually, strong metal is the mainstay for engraving such a magic circle because it can\u2019t be engraved all over the leather bag.Leather is a very poor medium for transmitting magic power, the same goes for fabric and paper. With the exception of parchment made by peeling the bark of hemp, it was impossible to engrave a magic circle or barrier on cloth or paper unless it was an Arch Mage of at least 6th rank.Conversely, it is metal that has a fairly good conductivity of magic. The most popular are iron and brass. Better materials are silver, gold, and platinum.The best thing is a gem made by crafting a raw stone, but since the material itself is so expensive, it is not used unless you are a high-ranking nobleman.Of course, cheap iron or brass is the most popular, and I was fully familiar with the properties of both materials.Heating and expanding the metal engraved with the magic circle, then cooling it with cold water quickly to shrink it again. The magic circle engraved on the metal will be misaligned and twisted in the process of expansion and contraction of the metal.Even if there is a deviation like this, the magic circle will try to recover automatically in a line so it\u2019s not a big problem. However, the gap that is created is very fatal. At that moment I used my magic power and destroyed the magic circle core.\u2018I\u2019m glad it went well.\u2019Well, it\u2019s not a commonly known method, it\u2019s just a trick made by appropriately applying scientific knowledge.Most of the wizards are people who are hung up on history and tradition, so they often overlook science. As a result, there were many cases where they did not prepare for, and that was what this company was hoping for.\u2018If he was a real madman, he would have carried an iron case covered with magic circles.\u2019Fortunately, Rudger Chelici wasn\u2019t that far off.I opened the suitcase and checked the contents of what was inside.\u2018Hmm, this\u2026\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 8": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Academy\u2019s Undercover ProfessorCH 8Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayC8: False Identity (3)There wasn\u2019t anything in Rudger\u2019s suitcase that could cause an eye-opener, just a change of clothes and books. Other than that, a lot of paperwork and miscellaneous things.\u2018I thought there would be something bigger.\u2019I grouped the textbooks, magic books, and thesis together and set them aside, and also sorted out the clothes and put them away.In the case of books, there were many other things such as popular novels and essays by famous scientists in addition to magic books.I\u2019ve read all sorts of miscellaneous things. Other than that, a few letters, identification, and personal belongings are all things.Even tools are just a pocket watch or a small pipe to be used as a magic medium and a wallet with money.I immediately checked the ID and documents one by one.\u2018Rudger Chelici, a descendant of the fallen nobles of Queoden, a small to medium-sized kingdom in the northern continent. He has no siblings and both of his parents are dead.\u2019It\u2019s not bad.He is a fallen aristocrat, but he nominally holds the title of nobility, so he will not be greatly disregarded wherever he goes, and since he has no family, no one will recognize me.His history is incredibly splendid. He submitted 12 papers to the Mattapan, and he was the youngest person to reach the 4th rank? He even became a military officer?\u2019No wonder he became a teacher at Theon.At such a young age, his record is already very impressive.\u2018Is the subject he would\u2019ve teached magic manifestation and specialization? Mana emission and elemental elements are the main things.\u2019Considering that he specializes in apparitions, there is a high probability that he will teach actual combat in the subject.I opened the letters and looked at the contents. If there was a conversation he had with an acquaintance, I had to catch his small habits and learn them.\u2018The content of the letter is irrelevant.\u2019The letters, presumed to have been exchanged with acquaintances, consisted of formal conversations such as the soon to be assigned to the academy, what books he liked, and where and what happened.Even when he was in the military, I don\u2019t think he had any close friends.Given that there is very little personal content, he didn\u2019t seem to be particularly close with the person he was writing to.\u2018Now all that\u2019s left it\u2019s\u2026\u2026\u2019It is information about the basic content of classes to teach students after the start of the semester, and how the Theon Academy was formed and operated.First of all, it was necessary to go around and learn about the topography of Theon.\u2018Gurgling.\u2019As I was about to go outside right away, I had to stop at the roaring sound of my stomach. Come to think of it, I haven\u2019t eaten anything since today\u2019s train.I am mentally exhausted because I have so much work to do today. Let\u2019s eat rice first and rest well today.* * *Two weeks have passed since then.In the meantime, I went to every nook and cranny of Theon Academy to learn about the geography of this place. As expected at first glance, the site of the Theon Academy was truly unimaginable.I sat on an outdoor bench in a secluded cafe and watched the peaceful scenery. I\u2019ve just finished checking everything out, and now I\u2019m just thinking about the classes I would have to teach.\u2018Is it because the opening time is approaching? I see students often.\u2019Students in Theon Academy uniforms were seen walking around. The uniform design is cool for men and pretty for girls. Did I mention that it was a uniform made by a famous designer in the empire?Perhaps it was because it was an academy that taught magic, some of them flew on broomsticks or moved on strange mechanical dolls. Seeing young people laughing and talking to each other, I thought they had a good time.Since I came to this world, every day has been a fierce battle, but these children are living a blessed life thanks to their innate talents and circumstances.\u201cHmm.\u201dTwo female students passing by this way glanced at me and started whispering to each other. Since I\u2019m someone they don\u2019t usually see it\u2019s normal for them to be suspicious.I was sipping coffee because I noticed them. After drinking it all, I have to go back to the dorm and prepare for the orientation that will be held in a week.With that in mind, I drank all the coffee and was about to get up, when a woman came and sat down at the table next to me and spoke in a voice so low that only I could hear her.\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re safe,\u201d she said. Why haven\u2019t you contacted me for two weeks?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dMy instinctive intuition stopped my head as I was about to look at her without realizing it.\u2500\u2500Chin.I naturally put the finished glass on the table.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dAre you talking to me now?I looked around. Maybe it wasn\u2019t me, but someone else, and if I reacted here, what could be more embarrassing than that? But no matter how much I look, there are no other people around.The only ones sitting at the outdoor table were me and the woman at the table next to me.That means that this person is talking to me now. How should I respond?As I continued to remain silent, she continued.\u201cI was worried about whether there was something wrong with you. Other members are also wondering what happened to the First Order.\u201d\u201c\u2026 \u2026 .\u201dMember.First Order.Someone who cares about me.* * *\u2018What.\u2019I fiddled with the handle of the coffee cup in my hand.I was just drinking coffee enjoying the wind at an outdoor table in a cafe, but suddenly a strange woman came up and talked to me.However, the words she said to me are very serious. She said the other members are wondering what happened to me.\u2014No. Not me, but a person named Rudger Chelici.The moment I judged the situation, my mouth moved naturally as if it had been greased.\u201cThere were a few things to check.\u201d\u201cIs it about this terrorist attack? It was just an accident. After all, no one knew that the rebels would attack the train on which First Order-sama was on.\u201d\u201cEverything else. Rough information about Theon.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you have the information you received in advance?\u201d\u201cThat alone is not enough. There is a big difference between hearing and seeing.\u201d\u201cYeah, that\u2019s right.\u201dThe woman nodded her head as if she understood something.\u201cDid you do well?\u201d\u201cYes, of course. Completed all Assassinations of Academy Members before entering here. Most of them were users.\u201dWhat? Assassinate the Academy Members?My body almost shook but I managed to hold it in.\u201cAnd in the meanwhile, a traitor in the organization was discovered and we dealt with him as well.\u201dWhat? Traitor? Dealt with him?Unknowingly, I swallowed my saliva at the word traitor.I asked without showing my embarrassment.\u201cHow did you do it?\u201d\u201cI pulled out a limb, grinded it, and stuffed it into his mouth. The rest of the body was said to have been fed to wild dogs. I haven\u2019t seen it myself, but I\u2019ve heard of it from other members. It could be said that it was a death worthy of a traitor.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dThey were crazier than I thought but the more I was in this situation, the calmer my mind became.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I should have listened and reported\u2026\u2026!\u201d\u201cWhy did you suddenly come to me now?\u201d\u201cFirst order came in here, but there hasn\u2019t been any news for the past fortnight\u2026\u201d\u201cSo, at this crucial moment right now?\u201dI analyzed as I spoke.They called me First Order, not Rudger. Looking at the First in front of the name, there is a high possibility that it is a fairly high position within the organization.I believed in that and tried to brag a little, and I think that was the correct answer.\u201cSorry!\u201dI responded with a cold voice to the woman who seemed to be bowing her head straight toward this side.\u201cBe quiet. Do you want to win the suspicion of those around you?\u201d\u201cSorry\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t even say you\u2019re sorry.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cOkay. Anyway, it\u2019s time to check it out. How many members are here now?\u201d\u201cYes Yes?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s about how many members are in here.\u201d\u201cAh!\u201dShe looked around as much as she could and lowered her voice.\u201cCurrently, 31 people from the 3rd order and 7 people from the 2nd order have succeeded in hiding. And the other First Order-nim came in first as planned and took a seat.\u201d\u201cHmm. That\u2019s right.\u201dWhile nodding my head formally, I put together as much information as possible.What I barely noticed was that there was one other person named First Order besides me, and that there were almost 40 of them.Although the scale is not large, their ability is unusual if it is enough to plant this number of people in Theon. The fortunate thing is that this woman in front of me doesn\u2019t even question my identity. Rather, she sends awe-inspiring gazes of fear and respect at the same time.\u201cChecking is over, so I\u2019ll leave now.\u201d\u201cAh! After that, you can come to the designated place if you want to connect.\u201dMeeting place? Was there such a place?But there\u2019s no way I would be able to ask questions like, \u2018Where is it?\u2019As I was thinking about how to do this, a good idea came to my mind.\u201cCome? Are you telling me what to do?\u201dAs I deliberately lowered my voice and sent a cold gaze, I could see her complexion turning pale.Whether this bluff had been paid off, she desperately made excuses while shaking her body like a baby squirrel.\u201cIt is not. I, I just\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t like to hear excuses. If a meeting is necessary in the future it will be here. The same is true of place and time. Do you understand?\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d\u201cIf it is necessary to go, I will only allow it if a First Order like me or someone higher than calls it.\u201d\u201cHigher than you? Would it be Zero Order-sama?\u201dSo there is a Zero Order.\u201cDon\u2019t bother me with trivial matters other than his words. Do you understand? This is a warning.\u201dI said that and got up from my seat.I was about to leave without looking back, but she called me from behind and said, \u201cThere.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThat, that\u2026\u2026What will we do when you call us?\u201dThe moment I heard those words, I felt like shit.Come to think of it, I didn\u2019t explain it. But I can\u2019t possibly explain to you something I don\u2019t know.\u201c\u2026\u2026Do I have to say that with my mouth?\u201d\u201cOh no!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to let it pass this time.\u201dWith those words, I quickly left.* * *\u2018Thump thump!\u2019Upon returning home, I hurriedly went up to the bedroom on the second floor and took out the suitcase I had put in the closet.After scattering the letters in Rudger\u2019s suitcase on the bed and checking them one by one, I realized that my anxious imagination had finally become a reality.\u201c\u2026\u2026Haaa, damn it.\u201dThe strange sense of alienation I felt while reading the letters.Why did he have to exchange these formal words with an acquaintance who has not family?Why did a man with such a splendid record restrained his private life to such an extent that it was close to nothing?All those questions were finally answered.-In the first place, this was no ordinary letter.I scanned the special characters of a specific word written inside the letter. The heterogeneity that I instinctively felt was in a certain pattern of these characters.\u2018Okay.\u2019This was the \u2018password\u2019. Their own passphrase they use so they don\u2019t get caught by others.Throwing away the letters, I re-read the documents proving my identity.\u2018Fallen Nobility? No family? From a foreign country that is very far from the empire?\u2019All of that is fake.\u2018Then, the true identity of the Rudger I met on the train\u2026\u2026.\u2019A member of the secret society hidden in the Theon Academy, even an executive with the title of First Order and now, I\u2019m wearing that guy\u2019s mask.My legs got soft and I flopped down on the bed.\u201cCrazy.\u201dThis identity of Rudger Chelici, which I thought was ideal for starting a new life\u2026\u2026In fact, a nuclear bomb was more dangerous than anything else.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I didn\u2019t have the strength to do anything right awayAt this point, I felt a sense of shame.No, how the hell does a secret society executive get caught up in a train attack and die?A secret society executive who planted nearly 40 spies in Theon Academy should have survived that situation!\u201cSigh.\u201dEven if I get angry like this, the dead won\u2019t come back. All of this is just pointless consumption of emotions.I\u2019m now Rudger Chelici, and I have to hold on to this damn status for two years.\u2018Honestly, I thought that it would be okay if only the Academy didn\u2019t find out, and that\u2019s difficult enough.\u2019Still, having experience, I thought that I could plausibly pretend to be a teacher. Because I also know how to use magic, and there is no shortage of theoretical knowledge.The fact that I could spend two years without problems was not arrogance, but a conviction made up of thorough calculations. But now I became an executive in a secret association and they\u2019re very dangerous.Assassination of some members of the academy, dealing with traitors, their methods are quite cruel. Even the gangsters and mafia on Earth don\u2019t do this and that\u2019s enough to show they are a radical group.The situation just went from normal mode to hell mode.\u201cLet\u2019s think.\u201dNow I have one more thing to deal with thanks to this fake identity.The Academy and an unknown secret society, if either of these groups find out that I\u2019m not Rudger, I\u2019ll die.Whether at the hands of the Chancellor, or by the laws of the Empire, or by the secret society\u2019s own purges.Now death is closer to me than it was in any other moment.\u201cI have to think.\u201dRudger Chelici is an executive of the secret society. The name Rudger was also created, so it\u2019s a pseudonym, but anyway, he\u2019s in a position called First Order.Among the secret society members that permeated the academy, the First Orders were alone, including me. I don\u2019t need to know right away what their purpose is.What matters is who the other First Orders are. I couldn\u2019t ask about it openly, so there was no way to know right away unless they made contact with me.\u2018For now, I can ignore the second and third orders.\u2019It is presumed that the real Rudger had a very eccentric personality within the organization. Even though I only changed my voice a little, it was a fact that could be inferred from the expression on his subordinate\u2019s contemplative expression.His personality is bad, so his subordinates wouldn\u2019t want to deal with him for too long. That is welcome on my part.In the end, I only had to care about other First Orders. Who the hell are they?\u2018I can\u2019t ask. I don\u2019t know how the executives recognize other executives. If I do that, I will immediately be suspicious.\u2019Now, I had to deal with not only the Academy and the Empire, but also the secret societies that were secretly hiding within the Empire.I thought I was riding on the back of only one tiger, but I was riding on the back of two. The moment when either side goes wrong, it\u2019s over.\u2018Okay. After all, since this has happened, I have no choice but to do it.\u2019I immediately took out the books from the suitcase and opened the letter next to it.\u2018Getting information comes first.\u2019This letter must be the password used by their organization, it was necessary to interpret it.A certain pattern exists in all passwords and the one that can analyze the pattern is this book in the bag.\u2018I\u2019m a teacher at the Magic Academy, so no magic books. Other than that, there were a few unusual books.\u2019I looked through the books.[Watcher of the Rye] [Ringerk\u2019s Philosophy] [Traces of Totalitarianism] [A Hundred Years of Solitude], novels, autobiographies, non-fiction and bestsellers. Among them, there was one book that stood out to me.[Gentleman\u2019s Culture]\u2018This is it.\u2019I remembered Rudger on the train, his actions, how he shacked his legs slightly or waved his hands. If the man had really seriously considered the culture of a gentleman and had read this book, he wouldn\u2019t have behaved like that.\u2018This book was the most touched.\u2019A part of the cover was worn and deteriorated. It appears like he reads a lot, but is there really a reason for that?\u2018This book was being used as an interpretation of the password.\u2019I opened the book of [A Gentleman\u2019s Culture] and turned the page. The irregularity hidden slowly caught my eye. Traces of burns can be seen in the book. Some pages were not read, and some pages were read until the paper ran out.Looking carefully at the particular worn-out page, I could see something between the letters. I immediately took the letter and compared them.\u2018It is said that the continent uses a unified language, but each country has a slightly different language.\u2019Since the traces of Rudger Chelici originated from the Queoden Kingdom, I can think of the Queoden language. In particular, the letter explicitly contained traces of some proper nouns or dialects used in the Kingdom of Queoden.Although it is a small and barren kingdom in the north, Queoden, which has produced quite a number of great writers, has only about 20,000 words used in that dialect, of which 8,000 are advanced vocabulary.Obviously this is the point of the password.It\u2019s not difficult to tell the code apart, considering the arrangement of the language and the connection with the letters because I know Queoden.\u2018Also.\u2019My prediction was correct. When I checked the code in Queoden, I saw connections between words and letters.<Greetings> <Goodbye> <Farewell Party> <New Meeting> <Crow> <Eyes> <Starlight> etc.Next to them, some words that symbolize numbers were mixed together.The number probably represents the page of this codebook, and if I interpret it by combining other words\u2026.\u2018First Order, infiltrate Theon Academy as a teacher and win their favor. After that, I will pass on the next order while monitoring the situation.\u2019I couldn\u2019t get any conclusive information, but this was enough.I closed the book [A Gentleman\u2019s Culture] and tilted my head back.\u201cWhoa.\u201d2 years left. I had to live as an academy teacher and as a secret society executive.Of course, I couldn\u2019t live like that forever. Even after spending two years as a teacher safely, the issue of the secret society remains.Their presence was very annoying to me. If I make a mistake in the middle, I have the highest chance of getting killed.\u2018But I can\u2019t get rid of the secret society by myself. I don\u2019t know how the organization is structured, but it was enough to plant spies in Theon Academy. They must be pretty dangerous.\u2019It is impossible to deal with them personally.But let\u2019s leave it alone for now, this secret society is a shackle holding my ankles, and I had to erase it.But how?\u2018I must use the power of the academy.\u2019There is a saying \u2018Deal with barbarians to subdue barbarians.\u2019Theon Academy is not just a school. It is a place that symbolizes the future, nurturing the future of the empire.Despite the name \u2018academy\u2019, it is not impossible because it is a place with enormous power to affect any country.If Theon and the secret society face off against each other, no matter how great the secret society is, they will have no choice but to be pushed back.How many soldiers and wizards are there? Even within the Imperial Territory, there is a possibility that the Templar Knights will move. They know that too, so they planted spies instead of choosing to break through head-on.In other words, I had to carefully dig up their information so as not to be caught by the secret society, and then leak that information to the academy.\u2018Of course if I take too long I might die in the process.\u2019The secret society could purge me because I betrayed them, and conversely, the academy could suspect me as a spy and exclude me. In the end, it was important to maintain a certain rhythm.The moment I lean to one side, the only thing waiting for me is ruin.\u2018For now\u2026\u2026Let\u2019s start with the first class in a week.\u2019There was no specific instruction but buying favor is to imprint my image clearly as a teacher. If so, first of all, fulfilling my duty as a teacher is a priority.Since Theon is a place where smart students attend, if I show a lack of appearance even a little, I may be bitten by them.At the age of growing up, talented children usually think that they are the best, and even ignore their teachers.I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like here, but I\u2019ve come to realize through long experience that people are the same no matter the place.\u2018\u2026\u2026There are so many things to consider.\u2019Don\u2019t look silly to students, don\u2019t get suspected by the academy and don\u2019t get caught by the secret society guys.I was wondering what the hell I was supposed to do, but if I endure all of this, I will obtain a great reward. For that I\u2019ll have to endure for now.I got up from bed and went into my personal study room and opened a magic textbook.I had to come up with a plan for the future and prepare how to proceed with the class.There are 2 years left, I couldn\u2019t just play.* * *The first day of school has arrived.The students who went to their hometowns during the vacation are returning one by one, and with the new semester, this year\u2019s freshmen also arrived.The students who were in the first year went up to the second year and crossed the school gate with their hearts full of anticipation of what new classes they could take in the future.From all corners of the classroom, students met friends they hadn\u2019t seen in months and greeted each other warmly. However, although all of them are attending the same academy, not everyone is the same.There are noisy students and quiet students. Naturally, the atmosphere was divided among the students, of course, their status in society was also determined.Inside Theon Academy, students are divided into three classes.The upper class, led by royalty, nobles, and high-ranking priests, middle class led by wealthy merchants and finally, the lower class occupied by the poor commoners.Even if they were studying at the same academy, they could not ignore their status, and as a result, they built walls without realizing it and divided the classes inside the academy.The nobles smiled brightly and greeted each other, while the commoners, on the other hand, often looked at each other or gathered quietly among themselves.\u201cDid you hear the news?\u201d\u201cWhat news?\u201d\u201cThere is a class on the theory of the manifestation system and the understanding of elements? Are you saying that the new teacher is doing it?\u201d\u201cThe new teacher is not teaching the first year, but the second year? Does he have any skills?\u201d\u201cHe can\u2019t help it, his predecessor went out. When I heard the news, I heard that his past record was splendid? It\u2019s said that he also wrote a lot of theses while in the military.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t he a great person then?\u201d\u201cBut you know what?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThat person is a fallen aristocrat.\u201dAt the word \u201cfallen aristocrat\u201d, a laugh naturally crept into the lips of the person that was leading the conversation.Fallen nobles were usually treated worse than wealthy merchants among nobles.Since he was appointed as a Theon teacher, he had some talent, but to the upper-class students, he was looking ridiculous.At the same time, the aristocratic students had similar thoughts. If the new teacher is a fallen aristocrat then earning credits in his class will be a breeze.The moment they talked about what kind of person he was, the front door of the classroom opened silently.All eyes turned to the front door, there was a man entering the classroom through the open door.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Even when the classroom door closes, when the footsteps of the shoes go up the pulpit, and when he puts documents on the desk, there is no sound.That silence engulfed the entire classroom like ripples on the water.\u201cHuh\u2026\u2026\u201dEven the aristocratic students who continued to talk were swept away by the atmosphere and kept their mouths shut.The students, who had been quiet, turned their eyes to the main character standing on the podium, their eyes shining with curiosity.The suit commensurate with his stature did not have any wrinkles. On top of that, a black frock coat that fits snugly on the body is added. A stylish, yet not overdone attire.As the man took off the hat on his head and threw it lightly, it flew gently toward the hanger in the corner of the class and landed. In the midst of a series of movements that were so natural, his appearance hidden behind a hat was revealed.A sharp jawline, straight nose and unshakable eyes. His strong, yet charismatic eyes were sharpened to the point that he could hardly be seen as a new teacher. His long hair for a man was tied neatly around the nape of his neck.\u201cGulp.\u201dSome aristocratic students who were secretly gossiping were crushed by the momentum and swallowed their saliva without realizing it.\u201cNice to meet you. My name is Rudger Chelici, and I\u2019m your new teacher.\u201dThe moment he opened his mouth and made a sound was as if water was poured on watercolors scattered dreamily. The atmosphere of the classroom, which had been immersed in stillness, returned to reality.* * *\u201cIt\u2019s the first day of class, so I won\u2019t start teaching right away.\u201dI slowly hung the frock coat I had taken off on the hanger.It wasn\u2019t difficult to keep the conversation going. It was enough to just recite the words that came to mind in advance at the right time.This is a kind of play.I am the actor on the stage, and the students are the audience. I just have to keep the monologue naturally in line with the breath, following the flow.Because the script is all in my head.\u201cMy class is theory of the manifestation but there will be no teaching purely on the manifestation system. Rather than that, we will focus on applying the principles to real life beyond the practical ones.\u201dTaking a quick glance at the crowd, I saw a few people shrugging their shoulders.That\u2019s a good response.Since Rudger was a soldier there was no student who looked strangely at me, even though I maintained such a tone and intense eyes.\u201cIt is possible to apply for my class not only in the second year, but also in the first year. In other words, it can be viewed as a joint class for the first and second graders.\u201dAll the students gathered now were in their second year, so it was just embarrassing. However, there is no school rule stating that classes should be unconditionally divided by grade level, so it was not impossible.The moment the noise gradually subsided, I opened my mouth at the most appropriate time.\u201cStop.\u201dIn an instant, the noise inside the classroom disappeared.Everyone\u2019s eyes turn in this direction again.\u201cIt is natural to feel dissatisfied with the fact that as second year students you\u2019ll have to attend the same classes as the first year students but don\u2019t worry. Considering the first graders, I will not teach the obvious things that even beginners can learn.\u201dA response filled with relief flows from all over the place.Theon Academy\u2019s teaching method is more like a university than a high school in terms of earth. However, since it is not completely a university, it can be seen that the mixture is a little vague.Theon students choose the lectures they want to take according to their specialties, and receive credits by completing the subjects.\u2018There\u2019s no big difference between the first and second year students.\u2019With that in mind, I decided to conduct a joint class between the first and second graders.Why?When only second graders get together, inevitably, the story of the teacher comes up. The curiosity and main target of second-year students who have known each other enough for a year will be the new teacher, not a classmate in the same grade.But what if a freshman is in the same classroom? The attention of the second graders is dispersed to the juniors in the first grade.Then there will be significantly fewer cases of people talking about me.The existence of the first-year students is a kind of smoke screen that keeps the second graders from doubting my qualifications as a teacher.\u201cWhy do you let first-year students attend classes?\u201dSomeone raised a hand and said,When I looked, it was a girl with wavy blonde hair that reached her waist. Her unshakable eyes that are facing this way have a strong sense of certainty.Her face is familiar\u2026.Where have I seen that face before?\u2018The kind of person who is reluctant to think of something\u2026\u2026.\u2019Once the question was asked, I decided to answer it.\u201cBecause I thought they needed a chance too.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean by chance?\u201d\u201cI think it is very unfortunate that I have to take my classes only for a certain grade, that\u2019s absolutely the wrong attitude as an educator. To provide equal teaching to all regardless of grade level, that is my opinion.\u201dWell, they\u2019re going to ask me why I didn\u2019t mention the 3rd graders.Of course, they can also take my classes if they want. However, it will be difficult for 3rd graders to digest the essential subjects they are learning right now.In fact, it would be up to 2nd year if I could afford it.\u201cOf course, that means that the classes I teach do not depend on the grade level.\u201dWell, it\u2019s not like I\u2019m just saying things without thinking because I made sure I was prepared for class.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to understand if you don\u2019t explain exactly what the class is.\u201d\u201cIf you are curious, you can come to my class. It\u2019s not fun to tell in advance.\u201dA small wrinkle appeared on the forehead of the blonde girl. I\u2019m sorry, but I have no intention of telling you what I will teach right now. Rather, it was meant to make you more anxious and curious.There is nothing that students attending the academy are wary of as much as an unknown class.\u201cJust one warning. If there is someone who wants to take my class with the stupid idea that I am a new teacher and that they can easily get credits.\u201dAfter deliberately adjusting my breathing and inhaling I spit out the last words strongly.\u201cAt that time, I will carve into their bones what real education is.\u201dThe last sentence means \u2018please don\u2019t come to my class.\u2019If they had to take a class with the first years, their pride would be quite hurt. I even warned them that the class will not be easy. There was a great chance that the students would not attend.If a landmine was thrown openly like this, and it explodes after being stepped on, it is the fault of the person who stepped on it.\u2018Everything is there for a reason. You\u2019ll find out when you go to class.\u2019\u201cAny questions?\u201dI asked the students.* * *The classroom was quiet.When Rudger asked if they had any questions, none of the students raised their hands.It\u2019s not that there aren\u2019t any questions. I also liked the trivial questions about how the assignments were going to be done, what the exact curriculum was for the class, or what was taught before but no one said anything.Everyone was overwhelmed by the spirit of Rudger Chelici.\u2018Is that the new teacher?\u2019\u2018I heard that he came from the military, so the atmosphere is not a joke.\u2019\u2018There was a saying that he was at least a fourth rank. Is it true?\u2019Even the noble students who ignored their opponents as the fallen nobles avoided Rudger\u2019s gaze and swallowed only dry saliva.The upper class, however, couldn\u2019t possibly have the other students dare to step forward. Everyone felt it implicitly as they listened to Rudger\u2019s words.That man never uttered everything in vain.Unless a person is genuinely proud of their class, they can never show such a reaction.What the hell are you trying to teach? If it is not bound by theory, is it practical? If so, how is it in practice?In everyone\u2019s head, only those complicated thoughts popped up and disappeared like bubbles over and over again.But one thing is certain, the class led by the teacher named Rudger Chelici is never going to be easy.\u201cAny questions?\u201dHis voice asked again. It was like that of a person who wanted to ask a question, but the students were not deceived.The moment you raise his hand here and open your mouth, you will immediately be caught by Rudger.Looking at those staring eyes that seem to eat them the will to never allow questions is conveyed.The blonde girl who first raised her hand was now still.\u201cNo. Then the opening ceremony will end with this.\u201dThe breathtaking orientation ended just like that.* * *When the orientation was over, the students got up one by one and left the classroom.I watched the scene carefully from the platform. Once I said everything I wanted to say, I guess they understood everything, right? But honestly, I was shocked that no one raised their hand when I asked them if they had questions.Up until the night before right now, I was prepared to receive all kinds of questions and prepared answers for them, but all of them are useless.Aren\u2019t academies like this usually all about children with strong egos? I thought they would make fun of me and pour out questions, did I overthink it?\u2018No. Wait a minute.\u2019It could be the other way around. What if they were intentionally chewing on my words? Isn\u2019t that often the case in 21st century Korea?When a new teacher arrives, the students deliberately ignore him without paying any attention. This is especially the case with female teachers.\u2018Well.\u2019I said it as seriously as I could on purpose to be scary, but did that have the opposite effect? Perhaps these coercive tones and actions touched the self-esteem of students who considered themselves geniuses.\u2018Then it\u2019s a bit of a big deal.\u2019In the military, the successor is the senior, in the workplace the lieutenant is the gunner, in the school the student ignores the teacher.It is self-evident that if I lose control of the atmosphere at the beginning, it will cause setbacks for future classes. If so, should I treat the students with a friendlier attitude?\u2018No, if I suddenly change now things will become strange. I just have to push through to the end.\u2019Being friendly and smiling for nothing is actually not my temperament, it\u2019s my nature, and most of the roles I\u2019ve been acting with have been like this.Besides, it\u2019s been three weeks since I\u2019ve been here and everyone already knows who Rudger is.Meanwhile, the remaining students in the classroom did not come to me. It\u2019s not that they\u2019re not interested, because I clearly felt their gaze.Still, I thought they would ask me some clich\u00e9 questions like how old you are or if you have a girlfriend, but I didn\u2019t know that they wouldn\u2019t open their mouths.Kids these days are scary.* * *\u201cThump. Thump.\u201dI left the classroom at a leisurely pace and walked slowly down the hallway. It was the first day of school anyway, so this was the end of today\u2019s work.Since the course registration correction period is not over yet, the students still have time to decide the classes they want to attend.The first class in earnest is 3 days later. Until then, let\u2019s think seriously about how I can take the lead in the class from the students.At least I should avoid being told that I\u2019m not qualified as a teacher. Thinking like that, I checked the front, and saw all the students walking down the hallway looking at me and clearing the way.Boys and girls alike, when they see me walking, they are startled and stick to the wall or window.\u2018What. Why?\u2019Could it be that the rumors of a new teacher, who seem bubbly, have already spread throughout the academy?I heard that there is a community like the university community \u2018Everytime\u2019 where the students can exchange opinions with each other inside the academy, is that because of that?Just when I thought that the next class would be quite difficult, someone spoke to me.\u201cHello.\u201dI stopped and stared at the woman speaking and smiling towards me.\u201cYou are the new teacher Mr. Rudger Chelici?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dShe was a charming pink haired woman with slightly wavy ends and a warm smile like a sheep. She\u2019s not wearing a uniform, so I don\u2019t think she\u2019s a student.Perhaps?Before I could say anything, she spoke again.\u201cNice to meet you. My name is Selina, I\u2019m also a new teacher at Theon Academy just like Mr. Rudger.\u201d\u201cOkay. Nice to meet you.\u201dWhen I glanced at her as to what she had come for, Selina looked into my eyes, a little perplexed, she spoke quietly in a crawling voice.\u201cThat\u2026\u2026Have you eaten?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In fact, when I followed Selina, there were three other people besides me, two men and one woman.They all look unique as if shouting, \u201cI am a wizard.\u201d\u201cHello.\u201dThe first person to reach out and shake my hand was a very warm-hearted man. He seems to be quite aged but he smiled haphazardly like the friendly man next door.I shook his hand lightly\u201cRudger Chelici, I am in charge of the manifestation system.\u201d\u201cBryno, I am in charge of golem summoning.\u201dThe next person who spoke to me was a bewitching beauty with long purple hair that covered one eye.\u201cYou are a handsome man, nice to meet you. My name is Merylda, I\u2019m in charge of charms and hallucinations.\u201d\u201cYes. Nice to meet you.\u201dThe last one left felt a little different from the previous two. He was a man with dark blue hair all-white and rimless glasses on his face, and his appearance alone looked quite strict. He had a frown on his face all the time, as if he wasn\u2019t very happy with the fact that he was here with us.When I looked at him, he looked at me, and then he turned his head. It was an expression of his will not to even introduce himself.As I was puzzled, Merylda laughed and explained in a low voice.\u201cMister Chris Benimore. As you can see, he\u2019s a nobleman, different from commoners like us.\u201dAh. So that was it.For Chris, even if he\u2019s an academy teacher, he probably doesn\u2019t want to be friendly with commoners. In my case, I am a fallen aristocrat, so it is natural for him to look down on me.\u201cIsn\u2019t Mr. Rudger going to ignore us because we are just commoners?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201dWhen I answered Merylda opened her eyes wide, and then withdrew with a soft smile.Hmm. After all, there are five new teachers, including myself. One noble, one fallen noble, and three commoners. However, since they became teachers at the Theon Academy, they must be talented people who went far in the field they teach.\u201cI can\u2019t stay here any longer. The newly appointed teachers besides me, are commoners and fallen nobles.\u201dChris\u2019s cold voice rang out. Bryno smiled awkwardly at those words, and Selina flinched, while Meryl glanced at Chris with a sullen face.Me? I don\u2019t care.It\u2019s hard for nobles to get used to mingling with commoners in only a day or two. As I was showing an attitude saying, \u2018If you\u2019re going to just go, go on your own,\u2019 Chris looked at me sharply.\u201cDon\u2019t be pretentious.\u201dYou wanted to leave, why are you looking at me like this? Were you originally acquainted with Rudger? It doesn\u2019t seem like it at all.\u2018It would be nice to be friendly with fellow teachers, but I think it would be difficult to get close to him.\u2019I ignored Chris and looked at the other three. Maybe there is a spy planted in the secret society among them.\u2018Is there a first order among these three?\u2019Currently, nearly 40 members of the Secret Order are hiding inside Theon Academy. Of course, considering the total population of Theon Academy with it\u2019s large size, 40 is an insignificant number, but that does not mean that there is no chance that I will not run into the other members along the way.Except for the Third Orders, some of the Second Orders may have infiltrated as students. In particular, in the case of the First Order, teachers cannot escape suspicion.\u2018Rudger took the position of a teacher and he\u2019s a First Order. There\u2019s no way other First Orders wouldn\u2019t do that.\u2019The question is who.Since they\u2019re new teachers like me it narrows down the range. Of course, I had no choice but to be suspicious of those who asked me to eat because they might be trying to trick me.I have to be vigilant. I struggled to keep my expressionless face and followed my fellow teachers to the dining room. Still, I don\u2019t eat alone, so I\u2019m holding on to the idea that it\u2019s not bad.* * *Selina, the new Elemental Teacher. She recently joined Theon Academy and teaches spirit summoning. She couldn\u2019t help but be quite nervous when she arrived.Theon Academy is well known in other kingdoms beyond the Empire. The students who enter here are geniuses who will take important positions in the future. It came as a great burden to her to teach such children.\u2018What if I make a mistake? What if I can\u2019t teach? Besides, there are many noble children here!\u2019There is a big difference between commoners and nobles.Thanks to the advancement in magic engineering, the world has gradually changed, and the common people have become members of the House of Representatives and intervened in politics. However, the wall of status was still high.The reason why there were 5 teacher positions this time was because the teachers who were in charge of the class until last year had retired and the reason why is unknown.Before coming here, her wizard acquaintances warned her about the territoriality of noble students. There are students who secretly look down on their teachers and try to win over them.Selina was terrified.\u2018It is said that even royal family members attend this school.\u2019It was mentioned that the third princess is a sophomore. She\u2019s in charge of her first year, so she won\u2019t be related right away. It seems that the orientation on the first day of class went smoothly, but it is also true that she is still anxious due to low self-esteem.Selina didn\u2019t want to be like this, so she decided to make friends with the other new teachers, like herself. If she had colleagues she could share hard work with, life at the academy might be better.She then became friends with Merylda and after calling people one by one, she went to find the last one left, Rudger Chelici.A man of noble origin, not a commoner, however, since his family had fallen, he was not a burdensome person to approach. Until she met him, she certainly thought so.\u2018Wow.\u2019At first, she wondered what was going on as the crowd in the hallway split left and right. Could it be that the imperial family, who she had only heard of, came?It was a man in a well-groomed outfit that broke her expectations and slowly went her way. Gray suit, black frock coat and a silk hat on his head.\u2018Wow, my God.\u2019When she first met Rudger, Selina\u2019s feelings were the highest of admiration.She was told that he was a fallen aristocrat but as she watched him, Selina was forced to correct her own narrow thinking.Slowly walking, scattering his majesty around him, he seemed far nobler than any noble she had ever seen. Every step he took was like a painting, so she stared blankly without realizing it. Selina recalled her purpose for her belated visit to her Rudger, and she hurriedly went to him.\u2018I\u2019m scared.\u2019As he paused and turned around, it felt like her heart was dropping. Still, Selina grinned as she struggled with her smile, and cautiously told Rudger that she would like to eat with him.It seemed that Rudger would immediately look at her with contempt and say something unpleasant.\u201cSure.\u201dBut Rudger accepted her offer with all too much ease. As she walked in her path, he matched her stride and kept his distance from her. His consideration for others was felt in his every little action.\u2018You have a very warm personality unlike how you look.\u2019Even when introducing him to other colleagues, Rudger didn\u2019t care whether they were a noble or a commoner. Although Mr. Chris Benimore showed an openly hostile attitude towards him, Rudger did not respond much.He is usually irritable but he never loses his nobility. It was as if he was alone standing on a cloud in the sky. As I heard later, it is said that he was a former military officer and a great man who even submitted several academic papers to the Tower.\u2018Mr. Rudger is a wonderful person.\u2019She also wanted to become a teacher with such charisma. Even when eating, Rudger simply ate quietly without saying a word.His posture in handling forks and knives was restrained as if he was living in a different world by himself, even the passing students were glancing at him.In fact, he acts as if it is natural or as if he doesn\u2019t care about the reactions of those around him. Rudger\u2019s attitude was the same even when we greeted each other after dinner and dispersed to our private dormitories or teachers\u2019 buildings.When everyone waved to see you later, Rudger greeted me with a nod of his head.Selina, returning home with Merylda, remembering her brief meeting with Rudger today. She tried to make her face deliberately expressionless as she inhaled deeply. Merylda, who was walking by her side, noticed her behavior and asked.\u201cSelina. What are you doing?\u201d\u201cMerylda, doesn\u2019t it make me look a little older?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dMerylda burst into laughter as she tried to ask what that meant.\u201cAhaha! Selina, are you pretending to be Mr. Rudger now?\u201d\u201cYes? Oh no, that\u2019s not it\u2026\u2026\u201dMerylda waved her hand to Selina, who was spurring gibberish in embarrassment, saying it was okay.Mr. Rudger is so unique that it is hard to believe that he is a new teacher like us. But considering that person\u2019s past, it was worth it.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t know? I checked out who all the people who came in this time were and he was a military officer.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s even more amazing is that Selina, you, me and the others came here with a tower or an elemental society on their backs and got recommendations. That man didn\u2019t. He didn\u2019t belong anywhere, but he came in on his own.\u201d\u201cWow. No wonder.\u201d\u201cThe teaching method of such a person must be great. Still, we have no choice but to teach our students our way. Don\u2019t be too swayed by others. It\u2019s okay if you don\u2019t pretend to be strong for nothing, because we also became teachers at Theon.\u201d\u201cAh yes!\u201dThe two met for the first time today, but quickly became close friends, chatting warmly and heading to the teacher\u2019s dormitory.* * *Three days have passed since the orientation on the first day of class.Since these three days are the course correction period, it must have been quite a busy time for students who have not yet made a choice about which lectures to take. Of course, that didn\u2019t matter to me.The long-awaited first class came and I crossed the hallway with excited footsteps.Three days ago I gave enough warnings.My class is like a landmine.Rumors about me must have already spread widely among the students. Having said that, I wonder if there are any students who want to take my class?There will be some. When the other classes are full they will have no choice but to choose with tears in their eyes in order to forcibly complete their credits.The important thing is that the fewer students I teach, the more comfortable I am.Classes can have a minimum of 15 and a maximum of 80 students. Lectures are not closed because there are few people, so if there are fewer people, it is enough to lead them well.Of course, there is no possibility of a minimum of 15 people, so I can compromise with 30 people in moderation. With that thought, I opened the door and entered the classroom.\u2018What?\u2019I saw students filling the inside of the classroom. That number was more than double the 30 people I had thought of. No, it was actually the maximum number of people the classroom could accommodate.Why are there so many?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 12": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Academy\u2019s Undercover ProfessorCH 12Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayC12: First Class (2)Only 2 chapters today but I\u2019ll try to post more tomorrow.About 3 days before, the first day of orientation. When Rudger showed the guts to keep his teaching methods secret, the reaction among his students was not so good.A number of students resented the fact that the new teacher, even a man from the Fallen Nobility, showed such behavior at the Theon Academy. In particular, students from aristocratic backgrounds were the angriest.But, ironically, the students who actually witnessed Rudger\u2019s orientation didn\u2019t say much. Only some high-respecting noble students seemed to have been ignored for nothing, but out of the 50 or so students in the classroom that day, nearly 40 admired Rudger\u2019s guts.He became a teacher at Theon Academy, so wouldn\u2019t there be something to believe in?Of course, as no detailed information about Rudger was yet known, students had no choice but to be cautious. On the first day of his class, it was a very self-evident fact that they would suffer for a semester if they took the wrong class.If even a little bit of information about Rudger was released, it would increase the students\u2019 trust and they would take his class once.The second morning of the second day when many students were worried a single article was posted on the community called <Akashic Records>, the student-only magic exchange book of the Theon Academy.Title: Did you hear about the new teacher, Rudger Chelici?A title that was intentionally created to grab people\u2019s attention, whether it\u2019s good or bad. Naturally, the students had no choice but to click on it, and the contents unfolded as if waiting.An extreme tribute to Rudger Chelici.The youngest fourth rank, military officer appointment, Cryptid Hunting Contributions. As a freelance mage, he also made a name for himself in the Tower of Magic.It contained past deeds of Rudger.For students who did not know that it was a desperate undercover operation of a secret society to somehow lift the First Order, it was enough to raise their expectations.In particular, the person with the most enthusiasm and sincerity was the Third Order member who was the first to contact Rudger.\u2018No one can\u2019t ruin First Order-sama\u2019s class! I have to get as many students as possible to hear it!\u2019She\u2019s been writing all day about just how cool, amazing he is.Perhaps because of the two days of persistently posting praises about Rudger and drawing attention, more people are interested in Rudger\u2019s classes than those who reacted with excessive praise.In particular, the fact that they were able to attend classes together with the older students stimulated the interest of newbies who did not know anything yet.During the correction period, the number of students who wanted to attend Rudger\u2019s class increased dramatically, and the maximum capacity of 80 students was filled with excitement.And the long-awaited first day of class.All the students sat down and waited for Rudger with anticipation, half of it out of pure curiosity, and half out of a desire to see where and how well he can teach.When the class started at 9 am the classroom door opened and Rudger entered.* * *What the hell is this situation?The classroom was full with no empty seats. The maximum number of people thought to be about 30 at most achieved the maximum.With 80 students ahead of me, I felt a headache.Why? Surely I must have subtly issued a warning that my class was a landmine at orientation three days ago?Above all, the students whose uniforms have blue badges are freshly enrolled first-year students and they accounted for more than 60% of the number of students gathered in the classroom.\u2018Why are the first graders again?\u2019Shouldn\u2019t first graders avoid taking classes with the seniors since it\u2019s burdensome?I never expected that there would be so many first year students. At this point, it makes me wonder if someone intentionally spread malicious information about me somewhere.\u2018Maybe I\u2019ve been looking down on the students too much.\u2019Of course, the Theon Academy is a place where only carefully selected students can enter after a fierce competition. It is a place where children from all over the continent, beyond the Empire, gather, so it is problematic to think of them as ordinary students.I decided to humbly accept my mistakes.Instead of raising students\u2019 vigilance, my actions ignited their self-esteem.Looking at their gazes I saw wild hyenas that will bite me if I ever make a mistake.It\u2019s my first class today, and I\u2019m under such pressure. If I go on like this, I will be eaten by the students in the classroom.\u2018Since this has happened, I have no choice but to do my best to conduct the lecture.\u2019I looked at the faces of the students gathered in the classroom. It is full of children, each with their own hair color. I guess that\u2019s common in this world.Some of them stood out more than others, especially the girl with the ears of an animal on her head. They are the beast people who live in the desert area of the southern continent.Well, in this world where there is magic and witches exist, the sub-races are a minority, even more so at Theon Academy.Until 50 years ago, the beast people were a race that was subjected to colonial rule and were treated like slaves, and even after 50 years, the remnants of discrimination and persecution against them still remain.Proof of this are the gazes of other students looking at the beast girl with subtle gazes. That child seems to have entered the school, but life in the future will be very difficult.\u2018Well, I\u2019m not in a position to worry about anyone right now.\u2019First of all, the progress of the class comes first.\u201cI\u2019m Rudger Chelici and I\u2019ll teach the whole process of the manifestation system.\u201d\u201cWhat about the four specializations?\u201dSomeone raised a hand and said so. He was a male student with a somewhat unlucky impression.I immediately chided him.\u201cAsk only when I allow you to.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Yes.\u201d\u201cIf there is another person who breaks the flow of my class at will, I will give a penalty point. The same is true for blatant challenges to my authority as teacher.\u201dSome students shouted in shock,\u201cBut students who do that well will be given a bonus. The higher the bonus, more benefits will be given, so work hard.\u201dIt is a well-known fact that first or second year students, when they are at their peak, do not care much about penalty points. However, there is a big difference between what a teacher warns about and what they don\u2019t.\u201cIf I had to answer the question a while ago, it would be \u2018yes\u2019. I will teach you one by one about the general aspects of <Emission>, <Elemental Attribute>, <Telekinesis>, and <Fortification>, which can be said to be the entire manifestation system.\u201dMost of what I said was unbelievable. Even within the same system, every specialization is a completely different field.The <Emission>, <Elemental Attribute>, <Telekinesis>, and <Fortification> that I mentioned a while ago are the four specializations of the [Manifestation System] that I talked about. They are often referred to as the four specializations of manifestation.Usually, it is said that it is enough to teach only two of these, but I said that I would teach a whopping four. To the students, it would sound like an unbelievable lie, as if I was bluffing.But this is by no means a lie.I did not achieve first-class in any of them, but I am proud that my overall spectrum of knowledge is quite wide as I have lived through the years.\u201cI\u2019m going to begin.\u201d* * *\u201cYou know, Cheryl. Isn\u2019t that teacher really funny?\u201dSheryl tried to hide her anxiety at the voice calling her, and turned her head to the friend sitting next to her. A girl with translucent, pure white skin, with her long indigo blue hair growing down to her waist.She was so beautiful that resembled a doll made by a craftsman with great care, and even the boys sitting next to her kept glancing at her.\u201cFlora, you again\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cExcuse me. So what have I done?\u201dCheryl couldn\u2019t keep up with Flora, who asked playfully and subtly.Flora Lumos, the daughter of Duke Lumos, one of the noblest families in the Exilion Empire.Beautiful and charming, as if she was a picture just by standing still, she was famous for the title of \u2018genius\u2019 in Theon sophomore year.Even the students who are called geniuses in the world become ordinary at Theon Academy.Theon, a group of only geniuses from all the countries of the continent, raised the standards of the students too high, and those with low talent were bound to become ordinary.It was not surprising that a child who was praised as gifted in his hometown became ordinary at Theon. \u00a0However, Flora is a girl called \u2018genius\u2019, even in Theon.She has a good family, her looks are beautiful, and her abilities are excellent, her only flaw was her character.Flora Lumos was notorious among the teachers, even inside Theon Academy. Because she was a genius, she did not want to receive proper instruction from anyone. Rather, she challenged the teacher\u2019s authority and won.It was not uncommon for her to point out the teacher\u2019s mistake in the middle of a class. On the contrary, she devised a spell on the spot that was far superior to what her teacher could teach, and she shattered the teacher in front of the students.She has steadily built up such notoriety since her freshman year, and it\u2019s still the same now that she\u2019s in her second year. In particular, the fact that two teachers in charge of the manifestation class retired last year was because of her.Flora became a sophomore, and she came back to take the manifestation class and this time it\u2019s the class of Rudger Chelici, who has been evaluated as unusual from his first appearance.Flora\u2019s friend Cheryl prayed that she wouldn\u2019t do it this time, but when she looked at Flora\u2019s expression, it seemed that her wish was nothing more than a vain hope.Flora\u2019s nickname \u201cLittle Demon\u201d was notorious among teachers because she eats away the souls of her teachers in every class she takes. Considering that people who have been beaten by her trembled so much that it was not enough to even call her the Great Demon King, let alone her Little Demon.Flora decided that her prey for this semester would be the new teacher Rudger Chelici.\u201cSheryl. Honestly, isn\u2019t it funny? He looks like he\u2019s only in his 20s, but he\u2019s teaching all four specializations of the manifestation system. To be honest, isn\u2019t it an exaggeration to teach them all?\u201d\u201cThat\u2026\u2026\u201dCheryl had no choice but to agree with that part.She didn\u2019t know if it was his pride as a new teacher, or if he really had the ability to do so.\u2018But, has he really mastered the four major specializations well enough to teach them?\u2019There are a total of 5 classes of magic, and each class has different specializations.The three specializations of the [Implementation] system are <Material Generation> <Transformation> and <Alchemy>.The four specializations of the [Manifestation] system are <Emission> <Elemental Attribute> <Flame copper> and <Fortification>.The 4 specializations of the [Summon] system are <Spirit> <Golem> <Magic Beast> and <Necromantic>.The 6 specializations of the [Curse] system are <Astrology>, <Enchantment>, <Hallucination>, <Pharmacology>, <Witchcraft>, and <Enchant>.The 5th system is called [Arcane]. It is vague to say that it is magic, but it clearly refers to a system that can be manifested through magic.Arcane magic that has been passed down from generation to generation in families or someone pioneered a unique method of their own belongs to this type of [special]. Of course, no teachers teach in this particular class.At the same time, Rudger engraved a magic formula on the magic board.When the magic was poured on the board that had nothing written on it, the formula was drawn on its own. It was [Fluttering Flame], one of the 3rd-tier flame elemental magic.\u201cOn the basis of manifestation, a total of six elements namely heating, combustion, compression, acceleration, expansion, and diffusion complement each other and form the formula.\u201dEven though it was only a 3rd tier spell, it was a magic that had to be manifested by placing six elements that make up the procedure in the right place. If time permits, even students attending this class could use it.\u201cToday is the first class, so before starting the main class, I will teach you something that will arouse your interest. It is a way to express the magic much faster than the conventional method.\u201dFor the first time, curiosity arose in the minds of the students.\u201cLet\u2019s see. Speed, yes. It can be said that it is three times faster than the existing method\u201dThe students\u2019 eyes widened at those words.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 13": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Academy\u2019s Undercover ProfessorCH 13Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayC13: First Class (3)\u201cDo you want to shorten the onset time of the procedure?\u201d\u201cIs that possible?\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you lying?\u201dUnlike the first-year students who do not know well yet, the second-year students doubted Rudger\u2019s words.Before teaching the basics in his first class, he promised to show them how to speed up the unleashing of magic. They couldn\u2019t help but doubt them.The speed of magic manifestation is always considered as the top priority for wizards to overcome. One second is a long time in a life-and-death battle.In particular, unlike knights who move their bodies in real time and wield swords, wizards who take time to manifest their magic feel the sense of danger much more.With the advancement of science, even wizards were less exposed to the same dangers as before, but they did not disappear completely.Since they were wizards who always had to think clearly and rationally, they had no choice but to hang on to this part more.In such a situation, what Rudger said now was not just to satisfy the expectations of the students, but to light the eyes of all wizards and inspire them.Flora\u2019s best friend Cheryl asked her.\u201cFlora. Is that really true?\u201d\u201cHmm. Well. Has there ever been a proper shortening of the procedure so far?\u201dThere was definitely a way to reduce the casting time. A typical example is scroll magic, which is performed by storing existing magic in a medium in advance.However, in this case, there is the limit of a single-shot. Scrolls once cast will lose their effect.Alternatively a magic called [Reverberation of Memory] that activates magic in advance and stores it can be used. Even in this case, it is impossible to use it continuously because there\u2019s a limit to the maximum amount of spells that can be stored according to the skill level.\u201cAs long as we don\u2019t change the structure of the magic itself, I think it\u2019s impossible.\u201dIn the end, in order to shorten the time, fundamental techniques need to be improved, but even that is impossible. Commonly used magic is the most optimal method that has been refined, devised, and created by wizards who will go down in history for thousands of years.To some, it may be only a third-level flame elemental magic, but behind the magic there are traces of countless geniuses in history. Even those who are called geniuses in modern times can\u2019t improve existing magic because it\u2019s so perfect that there\u2019s nothing to improve.That was something that had already been decided over a hundred years ago. Even Flora Lumos admitted it.\u2018Nevertheless, if you dare to change a part, you have no choice but to lose something.\u2019If the manifestation speed of a technique increases, other parts will inevitably become weak. The power decreases, the range narrows, or the accuracy decreases. However, if the elements involved are reduced can it still be the same spell?No. From then on, it\u2019ll become a completely different magic.For wizards who value legitimacy very much, it would be an issue.\u2018If you really meant to increase the casting speed with what I thought of.\u2019Flora\u2019s gaze narrowed narrowly.\u2018I will be very disappointed, teacher.\u2019No. Rather, Flora wished Rudger would have done it so that it would make it easier for her to act.\u2018I think our handsome princess felt the same way.\u2019The three princesses boast a beauty different from their own, with hair that looks like weaving gold threads.Contrary to her side, even for a woman who likes her straight and dignified appearance, her opinion of Rudger will inevitably be offensive. As if to prove it, her princess-sama\u2019s face also sat down coldly.The moment when the atmosphere in the classroom gradually begins to flow strangely Rudger clapped his hands to refresh the atmosphere.\u201cStop. The chatter ends there.\u201dAll the students kept their mouths shut, but the atmosphere itself did not change. Rudger said with a smirk as if he wasn\u2019t aware of it.\u201cYou seem to have a lot of questions. Good. Before I show you, let me answer a few questions.\u201dAt that moment, the students immediately raised their hands.Rudger pointed to the first student to raise his hand\u201cTell me.\u201d\u201cMy name is Alex Salane, a sophomore. Mr. Rudger you said that you\u2019ll shorten the time of magic manifestation, what exactly did you mean?\u201d\u201cShortening the manifestation time is literally shortening. Be more precise when you ask a question. Next.\u201d\u201cThis is Dahlia in sophomore year. By any chance, shortening the manifestation of a spell means that you want to improve the spell?\u201d\u201cNo. The trick is to keep it the same, but to cast it faster.\u201dAt those words, voices came from all over the place.\u201cCan you really increase the speed of spell manifestation?\u201d\u201cThat can\u2019t be possible. Wasn\u2019t it a challenge that no wizard had ever been able to overcome?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s absurd. There\u2019s no way it\u2019s possible.\u201dFlora had the same thought. How can the speed of speed manifestation be increased without modifying or improving the magic?Isn\u2019t it supposed to be an obvious way to increase the proficiency through countless repetitions? But looking at that imposing Rudger\u2019s expression, she felt a little nauseous.\u201cThat is impossible.\u201dFlora couldn\u2019t stand it and opened her mouth.An icy gaze flew towards her and fixed her. Flora felt her self-esteem slightly hurt.\u201cI am Flora Lumos.\u201dAt her self-introduction, the noise around her grew louder.Flora came out.\u201d\u201cHa-ha. That teacher is done for.\u201dEven among students, Flora\u2019s reputation was impressive. It was the same for the new students who entered this time.A 2nd year genius. Retaining the nickname of a genius in Theon, she was already famous among the freshmen.It was only natural for all of her students to pay attention as she raised her objection to Rudger\u2019s approach right from the first day of class.\u201cI don\u2019t remember allowing the question, but let\u2019s just skip it this time. Why is the student saying that it\u2019s impossible?\u201d\u201cThe only way to shorten the casting time of a spell without modifying or improving it is to increase your master over it.\u201d\u201cWhy do you think there isn\u2019t another way?\u201d\u201cBecause no one has ever done it, not even the geniuses of history, even the high-ranking arch mages could do it. But since teacher said he did it, I couldn\u2019t believe it.\u201dEven now, countless wizards in the tower continue their quest every day, squeezing their heads in search of the truth. Nevertheless, unlike in the past, there were areas where no progress was made any more, and shortening the casting of spells was a typical example.A new teacher saying that he managed to do it meant more than a simple bluff, it was close to a general insult to the magic world.At Flora\u2019s words, each student nodded in agreement with her opinion.No students believed Rudger or sided with him. Little by little, the atmosphere in the classroom became hostile to Rudger. But Rudger did not wriggle an eyebrow.He did not waver, as if no external pressure could even scratch him.\u201cNo one couldn\u2019t? That\u2019s funny. I think it was rather no one tried.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cMagic is based on tradition and history. But it has been brought to stagnation from a certain moment. Now that science has advanced, magic is under threat.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Are you saying that science is superior to magic?\u201d\u201cI just think that magic has room for further development, just like science. To say \u2018there is no room for improvement\u2019 is wrong.\u201d\u201cThere has never been such a case.\u201d\u201cBecause no one did it.\u201d\u201cEveryone who has done it has failed.\u201d\u201cThen I will be the first to succeed.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Are you serious right now?\u201d\u201cThere is no reason for me to lie in front of everyone like this.\u201dFlora was ecstatic at his impudence. Does that teacher not know what he was talking about?\u201cWell, it seems you don\u2019t understand, so let\u2019s start the class right now. Did you say Flora? Do you know how long, on average, it takes to compose the [Fluttering Flame] formula I wrote on the magic board right now?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Depending on who\u2019s unfolding it. 10 seconds for a wizard who just reached the 3rd rank. As you become proficient and increase your rank, it will be shorter, under five seconds.\u201d\u201cOkay. However, I do not like the frivolous method of increasing the speed by increasing your rank. What I\u2019m saying is tailored to the level of the students I\u2019m teaching. Then, no matter who casts the spell, it will be five seconds.\u201d\u201cIs this your method?\u201d\u201cYes. You are very confident. Can you show us right now?\u201dFlora was not frightened by the provocative words.\u201cSure.\u201dFlora went down from the church with dignified steps and stood on the top of the pulpit. She raised her personal wand and immediately used [Fluttering Flame].The basis is manifestation and the attribute element is fire, in addition to the elements of heating, combustion, compression, expansion, diffusion, and acceleration.The magic that rises in the air is in the form of blazing flames. Its speed was like a raging wind, and the students who had been paying attention burst out in exclamation.Rudger checked the golden pocket watch in his hand.\u201cTime, 4.78 seconds. A speed that doesn\u2019t look like a 2nd grader and the process was perfect.\u201d\u201cIt didn\u2019t matter.\u201d\u201cBut it\u2019s still slow.\u201dRudger\u2019s cold voice flew over to Flora, who was conceited.\u201c\u2026Yes?\u201d\u201cThe record for the fastest casting of [Fluttering Flames] among the third rank wizards is 4.41 seconds but that\u2019s still slow.\u201d\u201c\u2026I can do it faster once I get used to it.\u201d\u201cI said that even 4.41 seconds is slow.\u201dEveryone was taken aback by Rudger\u2019s very dignified declaration.Rudger decided to show them why he said that. Standing on top of the pulpit, Rudger began to concentrate his magic.\u201cLook carefully. This is how [Fluttering Flames] is used.\u201dMuttering that, he raised a small staff and pointed it into the air. The magic that flowed out from the tip of the wand soon began to form a rite but something was strange.What unfolded after the expression-based procedure was not the stage of heating and combustion that was supposed to constitute the [Fluttering Flame]. It was just a straight line, a flow of magic that had no meaning.Aren\u2019t you using [Fluttering Flames]?When students thought that the magic of [Fluttering Flames] in the air was completed. It happened in the blink of an eye.\u201c\u2026\u2026!!!\u201dThe entire classroom was filled with silent clamorsNo one had seen In the first place, Rudger slowly showed how he casted the magic.The first step was not the magic of [Fluttering Flames]. The operation of magic was completely different from the usual method.However, the result was the same.What was completed was the magic of [Fluttering Flames]. It was perfect, just like in the textbooks.How?Only the beginning and the end exist, and the middle process seems to have been cut off and disappeared.The speed is surprisingly fast. 1 second? No. It took almost 0.3 seconds. It was incomprehensible to the common sense of the students.\u201cDid you see it?\u201dRudger\u2019s voice was flat without any highs or lows. He had no sense of excitement for what he had done.\u201cWhat the hell.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll show you one more time for those who haven\u2019t seen it.\u201dRudger said so, breaking the existing technique and repeating the process that had been seen a while ago. Slower this time, so that everyone can see properly.The students opened their eyes to see if there was something they had missed, and looked at Rudger\u2019s technique.Magical energy spewed out from the tip of the wand, and it again proceeded in a strange way, just like the first time and immediately [Fluttering Flame] was completed.\u201cCrazy.\u201d\u201cIs that possible?\u201d\u201cHow?\u201dHe didn\u2019t use an artifact of [Reverberation of Memory.No matter how fast it was, the process had to exist. But he skipped the process and showed only the result. There is cause and effect in everything and so it\u2019s magic.But Rudger\u2019s way wasn\u2019t like that at all. He removed that cause but the effect was still the same.\u201cNo, just what the hell\u2026\u2026\u201dEven Flora, who was watching from the nearest point, did not understand what Rudger had shown her.\u201cFinally, everyone\u2019s eyes have changed.\u201d\u201cGulp.\u201dThe sound of someone swallowing saliva resounded throughout the classroom. To that extent, the students focused on what Rudger would say next.\u201cCasting [Fluttering Flame took me 0.24 seconds. It is very different from the previous record but at the same time, you will find it strange. Because the first magic was not [Fluttering Flame].\u201d\u201cI definitely used magic. To be precise, it was used for the sake of speed.\u201d\u201cFor speed?\u201d\u201cWhat the hell is that?\u201dThe students who muttered to each other shut their mouths again\u201cI call this, Source Code.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 14": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Academy\u2019s Undercover ProfessorCH 14Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayC14: Source Code (1)At my words, the students catch their breath. Because some people don\u2019t know what the source code is.\u2018From their point of view, it would be a real surprise.\u2019No matter how advanced science is, this world is around the 19th century in comparison with Earth. Because magic, not science, was the mainstay, so it made a much more dramatic development than I originally thought.Still, living in the 19th century, there were many things that were lacking. This was particularly the case in the absence of a computerized computing system.\u2018A source code is a kind of blueprint that outputs a set result immediately by inputting a value. I made it by grafting it into magic.\u2019Of course, I didn\u2019t make this by myself. To be precise, I came up with the idea, but the actual composition and completion was possible only with the help of the master who taught me magic.Still, I have a stake in what I made, so there shouldn\u2019t be any problem in teaching the students.Considering Master\u2019s personality, it\u2019s not like he would say anything about this. Rather, it was the problems I would face once I ran into them.The source code is a method that is close to a kind of trick, created based on my memories of living on Earth.It must be unbelievable for students who know algorithms but do not know about computer hardware, software, programs, input and output, and code.Above all, the level of wizards was stagnant due to excessive selection and self-confidence, and yet there was a prevailing tendency to make fun of science.They would never accept the contributions science can make to magic. I\u2019m sure they would be foaming at their mouths saying \u2019This isn\u2019t magic!\u2019Compared to those guys, I have a freer way of thinking.In order for the software called source code to operate, a body called hardware, programs, and data are required.Here, hardware means a wand that can apply magic or the wizard itself. A program is a crafted spell, and data is the magic to make it come true.In the end, the source code I used is through the biological hardware of humans. It consumes data called magic.With the source code even complex spells can easily be casted by simply injecting a little magical power.To put it simply, while others carefully draw each stroke to implement magic, I just slam like a stamp. It\u2019s easy considering the difference in speed between handwriting and printing.No matter how fast a human being can copy, there is no way he can keep up with the speed of a person who uses a printer.People even make a lot of mistakes if they are impatient. If the procedure is out of order, the result will be wrong. Naturally, the spell loses its power and cannot be used or the reverse flow of magic power can put your life at risk.With source code these issues don\u2019t exist.In any situation, only certain values are provided. Its speed is something that other wizards can\u2019t follow.\u2018Of course, a rank 6 wizard or higher would be faster.\u2019In the first place, they are superhumans with supercomputers in their heads.For the students of Theon Academy who have not yet fully matured, source code must be a really great revolution.\u2018It\u2019s not without flaws either. The only spells that can be used are those 3rd rank and lower. Beyond that, it causes overload due to the amount of magical power. And it\u2019s just that making the source code is so complicated and difficult.\u2019It is not for nothing that computer programmers go through tests while diversifying all kinds of patterns for debugging. Because I also wrapped my hair so much that I made it. However, once made, it can be used over and over again, so it is very convenient.In particular, I don\u2019t have to use the 3rd rank or lower spells by using troublesome incantations one by one.After all, the magic of source code is the product of an invention made to catch up with those who have talent as much as possible.In this academy, where only geniuses gather, if I want to do well as a teacher for two years, I have to go ahead and teach classes with even these basics.* * *All the students kept their mouths shut at the emergence of a groundbreaking magic called source code. In particular, first-year students were excited.\u2018I felt half cheated, so I chose Rudger Chelici\u2019s class, but to witness this.\u2019Some students felt a cooling sensation on their backs.\u2018If only I didn\u2019t take this class today.\u2019A new type of magic manifestation that transcends common sense.They cannot see its appearance with their own eyes, and in addition to that, they will be deprived of the opportunity to learn.It was such a terrible nightmare for the students who were about to walk the path of a wizard, just imagining it sent chills down their spine.\u2018\u2026\u2026I\u2019m really happy.\u2019All the students gathered here shared the same thoughts.They looked at Rudger again. Obviously, his first impression was very serious, profound, and intense, contrary to what they had expected. Even so, the most important thing for a magic academy teacher is magic skills.Just repeating what others have said is not enough to earn students\u2019 respect.But now all students who saw the new magic had feelings of reverence beyond respect for Rudger.Above all, Rudger\u2019s behavior was surprising.Although he demonstrated in front of everyone a new method that could be called the discovery of the century, his expression showed no sign of excitement.For this man, even the groundbreaking magic called source code was simply something that could be unfolded in front of everyone.\u2018Perhaps aside from source code he has other secrets.\u2019If you invent something like this and show no excitement, there\u2019s no doubt that you hide other secrets.At that moment a spark ignited in the hearts of the 80 magic academy students present in the classroom.\u2018If I can learn that magic I can make further progress.\u2019That strong will is revealed in their eyes, and is shot towards Rudger.Rudger\u2019s half-opened eyes gave them an ok response, but his back was damp with cold sweat inside his cloak.\u2018Why are their eyes like that?\u2019For Rudger, who was expecting only opinions that he was moderately great and that he seemed like a good teacher, the students\u2019 reaction was surprising.Their eyes were hotter than the lava that just broke through the strata.Feeling like he was going to burn, Rudger focused and maintained his poker face. But he knew he couldn\u2019t depend on source code for the 2 years he would be here.He didn\u2019t want others to discover that he\u2019s an impostor. He had to prepare more in the future.\u2018Let\u2019s go to the end. But first of all, what should I do with the daughter of the duke who is on the platform?\u2019\u201cFlora Lumos.\u201dFlora, who had been focused on the source code magic that Rudger had unfolded, finally came to her senses.Rudger\u2019s cold, sharp eyes looked at her and felt like a cold blade had cut through her heart.\u2018This guy is\u2026\u2026\u2019She thought of herself as a genius and she had the talent to match it. No one doubted her and to those who did she demonstrated her skills in person.Even though he was an academy teacher, she was embarrassed in front of him. No matter how old she is, no matter how long she learns science or magic, and no matter how hard she tries she is already ahead of her teachers.But Rudger was different. He neither reveals nor brags about himself. In addition, he does not sway anyone else. It is as if she was looking at a pillar of steel that is deeply embedded in the ground and stands tall. It does not rust and does not wear out even in storms, rain and snow.\u2018How the hell is this person a new teacher? Source code? I\u2019ve never heard of such magic.\u2019The intimidation was enough to affect even Flora, who had met the royal family several times. Even the noble princess had her eyes wide open at the sight of Rudger.\u201cA groundbreaking method of shortening the spell casting time. Has your question finally been answered?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Yes.\u201dFlora tried to pretend to be calm and replied that way. She kept her posture neat and leaned back to not show any flaws.Was her behavior funny?There was a slight but smile on the corner of Rudger\u2019s lips. As if he had already seen through this desperately strong pretender.\u201cFlora Lumos.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Yes. Teacher.\u201d\u201cYou couldn\u2019t overcome your own intolerance, and you asked questions without my permission. Do you admit it?\u201dFlora bit her lip. She was proud of herself, but she couldn\u2019t argue with that.\u201cYes\u2026I admit it.\u201dA feeling of defeat that she had never felt before. The envy of the students, which she usually felt, had never been as painful as it was now. Suddenly, a memory of her childhood that she wanted to forget came to her mind.The figure of her father looking down at her with a cold gaze. She wanted to be recognized for her skills and had a goal. She was desperately holding back her tears because she was about to cry but she couldn\u2019t break down here yet.\u201cI won\u2019t say more than this, because I know it myself. However, your actions clearly challenged the school authority. As I warned you in the beginning, I am not going to let this go.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Yes.\u201d\u201cFlora Lumos I give you 10 penalty points.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t that surprising, but if the subject was Flora, the story was different.Theon genius who has never had any flaws until now. She had absolutely nothing to do with penalty points, and she was the kind of woman she never thought she would ever be, so she was shaken, even for receiving only 10 penalty points.\u201cAre there any complaints?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026No. I think it makes sense.\u201dFlora bit her lip.\u201cOh my gosh.\u201d\u201cThat Flora\u2026\u2026\u201dEven the other students were surprised that Flora had been penalized. Much less that this was not a forced accusation, but a reasonable punishment that even the person herself had no choice but to admit.Flora came down from the pulpit with weak steps and returned to her seat.\u201cThe spell [Fluttering Flame] you showed me was more perfect than anything I had ever seen.\u201dShe turned around and looked at the pulpit. Rudger was staring at her with an infinitely straight gaze.\u201cI don\u2019t hate students with skills. So Flora Lumos you receive 10 bonus points.\u201dAs a result, her 10 penalty points are virtually gone.Some students felt relieved and some were envious but Flora felt unprecedented shame.Even is the penalty points are gone her memory of receiving them is still there. Ten years from now, or maybe even the rest of her life, it was something she would never forget.Flora interpreted Rudger bonus points as the victor\u2019s mercy on this foolish student who dared to attack him. It left a deep scar on Flora\u2019s self-esteem.\u201cThank\u2026\u2026you.\u201dAll she could say was this.As she returned to her seat and sat down, Cheryl, who had been watching the whole thing, asked in a worried voice.\u201cFlora, are you okay?\u201dCheryl knew how strong Flora\u2019s pride was. She said that exactly what she had been through as a child forced her to be that way.She had a hard time imagining how humiliated Flora felt when the new teacher reprimanded her in front of everyone.\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201dFlora replied with a smile. Her relaxed appearance was no different from her usual one and she didn\u2019t look like her wounded person at all.\u2018Ah. That\u2019s fine. Because it\u2019s Flora, I think she\u2019ll be able to brush it off quickly.\u2019Cheryl sighed in relief. She thought that her friend might be going in the wrong direction.Flora looked at the podium with the same face as usual but she didn\u2019t see Cheryl or any of the students in the classroom. A scorching fire burned in Flora\u2019s eyes, igniting everything.* * *I went back to my seat and looked at Flora\u2019s condition. Belatedly, I remembered that the Lumos family was a famous duke in the Empire.Is she not going to use the power of the family to put pressure on me for what just happened? Do you go home and tell your father?However, Flora\u2019s expression as she sat down was calm. There\u2019s nothing strange about the way she naturally communicates with her friend sitting next to her.I can see, she\u2019s a smart kid, so I\u2019m not going to keep this in my heart. In the first place giving her those bonus points was a kind of reconciliation attempt to avoid fighting and encourage her to do better in the future. I\u2019m really glad that she accepted it.\u201cThen I will start the first class.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Dang. Dang.\u2019When I finished explaining the theory and simple method of discharging magic, the clock tower bell rang to end the class. I breathed a sigh of relief in my heart, thinking that I had finished the class safely without receiving any tackles.The students did not seem to feel anything particularly suspicious as I continued to briefly explain the contents of the textbook by mixing them with practical tips.The first lesson was done without problems, so I can carry on to the next class as it is.I teach a total of 4 hours a week. Classes are held twice a week, divided into two hours each, so I had quite a bit of time until the next class.As I put on my coat and was about to leave the classroom, I saw some students staring and approaching me.I did something for a moment, but I later realized that I was missing one thing.\u201cAh. By the way, I will not give you homework from the first day. Go back and review today\u2019s lesson.\u201dAt my words, the students smiled and rejoiced.Even if it\u2019s an academy where geniuses gather, they are students after all. Seeing them so happy for not receiving homework for once, I thought they were still kids.I can\u2019t give homework from the first day no matter where I\u2019m. After all, other teachers besides me will give the homework. Teachers who give homework from the first day are often criticized throughout the semester.In regards to classes, everything I give can be seen as a kind of calculation. The more gossip and dissatisfaction with other teachers, the less mention of me.I got out of the classroom with the list of students on the pedestal. When I left, the eyes of the students flew, but I naturally ignored it.To proceed with the next lesson I needed basic personal information about 80 students attending my class. Also, considering the unresolved issue with the secret society, I had to move as quickly as possible.* * *\u2018Wow. Really.\u2019Aidan, a freshman at Theon Academy, realized that he really had come to Theon after taking Rudger Chelici\u2019s class.\u2018I thought it was a vague feeling, but it was amazing.\u2019Aidan, who came up from the countryside, was a commoner, but he was a proud young man with a passion for magic more than anyone else.Thanks to the hard work he had accumulated so far and some luck, he was able to pass Theon entrance exam, and as a freshman, he took his first classes with a bright attitude.[Rudger Chelici lectures on the manifestation system.] He honestly wasn\u2019t expecting much.When I first entered the classroom, I secretly picked up the voices of other students, and found that the class I had chosen was more talkative than I expected.Originally, there are a total of two manifestation system classes, and this one is taught by a fallen noble. A new teacher wouldn\u2019t be able to teach this class but he was lucky because 5 people retired last year.All the rumors circulating in <Akashic Records> were fake. Of course, it was the noble students who had a low mouth and looked down on others.However, Aidan, who came to Theon from the countryside, knew only that they were seniors and did not know that they were great nobles, so he did not doubt their words.\u2018Is the teacher named Rudger Chelici that bad?\u2019It was just a class I chose without much thought, so I regretted it for nothing. However, Aidan realized how short his thoughts were, as soon as Rudger appeared.The man, who overwhelmed 80 students even though he was standing on the pulpit, was like a soldier on the verge of a fierce battle. And what happened afterwards made Aidan even more astonished.He had a conversation with a female senior about the impossibility of shortening the casting speed and then she showed everyone a technique.The moment he encountered the magic that Rudger Chelici called the source code, Aidan felt the blood boil all over his body.It was like fireworks exploded in front of him. It was the light of knowledge that appears when you clearly witness a mystery that you have never encountered before, and it was the moment of opening your eyes to a wider world.It sounded like an excessive leap, but at least Aidan himself felt that way.When he was a child who didn\u2019t know anything yet, a wandering wizard showed him magic. That magic was only 1st rank, and now that he thought about it, the wizard technique was not perfect and it was even crude.At that time, Aidan thought that the figure was very cool.Since then, he has continued to study magic under the guidance of the wandering wizard, although he did not feel the shock he had when he first encountered magic he remembered learning magic itself was so much fun.Aidan grew rapidly day by day thanks to his passion for magic and, surprisingly, his talent for magic. In this way, he was able to enter the magic academy, Theon, through fierce competition.He took his first class here, thinking that he might satisfy his craving for magic and open up a new world but instead witnessed something extraordinary.\u2018Mr. Rudger Chelici is a wonderful person!\u2019He thought it was unusual from the first impression, but he was the real deal.Aidan couldn\u2019t hide his excitement, thinking he was really lucky to have taken this class.\u201cHuh.\u201dIt was then. A voice of blatant contempt could be heard from the seat next to him.When he turned his head, a first-year boy from somewhere was looking at him with her arms crossed. His face is good-looking, but it looks quite greasy because of the blonde hair that was parted to show his forehead.Aidan then looked around. Now that most of the students had already left the classroom, there were not many left.\u201cAh! You were talking to me!\u201dThe face of an aristocratic male student was distorted by Aiden\u2019s innocent reaction.\u201cYou. Are you mocking me now?\u201d\u201cYes? I didn\u2019t mean that.\u201dAidan smiled shyly and tried to say that he never meant that, but the situation in front of him was already overturned by the fact that the person in front of him had been insulted.\u201cYou dare to ignore me, the first son of Baron Pellio?!\u201dAidan broke out in a cold sweat. It seemed that he was wrong in many ways to pass for good.\u2018What?\u2019A helping hand came to Aidan the moment he was contemplating how to handle this situation.\u201cIf it\u2019s Baron Pellio, isn\u2019t he at the edge of the Empire?\u201d\u201cWhat?! Who are you?\u201dIt was a blue-haired boy who went out to help Aidan.Jevan Pellio looked at the boy and put a smile on his lips.\u201cThe Theon Academy admitted such a little boy?\u201d\u201cIt would be better than having a child of a poor baron family pass.\u201d\u201cWhat?! You dare insult the Pellio family?!\u201dAs Jevan clenched his teeth and tried to increase his magical power, the light blue-haired boy, Leo, did not lose his smile.\u201cI will make you pay the price for the words and deeds that dared insult the nobleman\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cTry.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cTry it. What will happen if you unleash your magic here and attack us?\u201dEveryone was shocked at Leo\u2019s bold statement. He thought that ordinary people would bow their heads if they were moderately intimidated.\u201cDo you know that this is your family? Wake up. Even if you\u2019re a noble, if you make a little fuss here, it\u2019s not worth it. Didn\u2019t you get any notice of that before you came in?\u201d\u201cYou \u2026\u2026!\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t know what to do other than stare because there\u2019s nothing to say.\u201dAt Leo\u2019s words, Jevan realized that there were still several students left in the classroom. Among them, there were children of high-ranking nobles whom they did not dare look up to.Jevan looked at Aidan as if to kill him, and left the classroom without saying anything.Aidan thought about whether this might be good or not. But right now, his priority was to thank that friend for helping him.\u201cThank you for your help. I am Aidan.\u201d\u201cI am Leo. Oh, and no need to thank you. I just acted because it was disgusting to see people calling themselves aristocrats.\u201d\u201cAre you a good person?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026What did you hear me say?\u201dLeo looked at Aidan like a strange person and then shook his head.\u201cI\u2019m just going to go.\u201d\u201cAh! I will go with you.\u201d\u201cDo you know where I am going?\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you going to the next class? From the book I see in your hand I\u2019m going to the same class.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Sheesh. Do whatever you feel like.\u201dLeo spoke bluntly, but he didn\u2019t turn down his offer. Aidan had an intuition that Leo\u2019s behavior was just a bit strange, and he was a good person.Leo, who was looking at Aidan who was packing his textbooks for the next class, suddenly opened his mouth.\u201cIt would be nice to go around without showing too much.\u201d\u201cYes? What?\u201d\u201cTry not to look like a plain villager who didn\u2019t learn magic properly.\u201d\u201cOh, is that so? Sorry. I don\u2019t know that.\u201d\u201cDo not forget. This is Theon Academy. It\u2019s full of all kinds of great people.\u201d\u201cGreat people? Ah. I think I can figure it out by looking at Mr. Chelici.\u201dLeo let out a sigh in response to the frigid reaction. Apparently, this poor friend had a lot to learn.\u201cListen. Once you\u2019ve taken the class, you too need to know how this place works. And you have to be careful about certain students.\u201d\u201cSpecific students?\u201d\u201cEven within Theon, there are students who have an exceptionally overwhelming position. Right now, our first-year students have just come in and don\u2019t know what to do, but from the second year on, they do.\u201dThe most representative example was Flora Lumos.\u201c2nd year Flora Lumos. I didn\u2019t know that we would be taking the same class, but it\u2019s good to be careful.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cThere are rumors that she has a bad personality. The teacher who was in charge of the manifestation class last year suddenly quit because she had a big influence. She honestly thought she could do the same again\u2026\u2026\u201dLeo also remembered Rudger Chelici class. The groundbreaking magic called source code he showed was definitely great. Because that Flora Lumos left without a click.But he didn\u2019t think Flora Lumos was going to collapse just because of that. Rather, there was a possibility that sparks of anger could be thrown at other people.\u201cSo it\u2019s best to avoid her as much as possible.\u201d\u201cAnyone else?\u201d\u201cThere is. One of the noble bloodlines of the Exilion Empire.\u201d\u201cAh. I heard that rumor too. It\u2019s said that there was a princess in second grade?\u201d\u201cThe Third Princess Erendira von Exilion. She was so noble and the emperor loved her, so she must have been able to come here. Of course, there\u2019s nothing good about us being commoners.\u201d\u201cAh. Her.\u201dAidan thought of a woman who had hair like gold threads. Blondes aren\u2019t that rare, but there\u2019s only one blonde with a sense of nobility.\u201cAnd finally, Freuden Ulburg.\u201d\u201cThat Ulburg? One of the three great duke families\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat other Ulburg could be in the Empire? Freuden, the eldest son of the Duke family of Ulburg. He is the man who leads the biggest faction in sophomore year. To be precise, it is an upper-class faction made up of only nobles.\u201d\u201cUpper tier\u2026\u2026clique.\u201d\u201cPeople like us are like roadside bugs, so it\u2019s better not to get involved. Fortunately, Freuden doesn\u2019t take this class. By the way, the idiot who quarreled with you a while ago seems to belong to that faction.\u201d\u201cBecause it was unavoidable. Is there anyone else out there?\u201dLeo couldn\u2019t figure out what kind of person Aidan was. But he was sure at least he wasn\u2019t a bad guy or a dark-hearted guy.\u201cThere are a few more.\u201d\u201cOh yeah? Who is it?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll explain that later.\u201d\u201cGreat! Ah. Would you like to eat together later?\u201d\u201cWhat? Why me?\u201dAidan and Leo left the classroom murmuring. Not knowing that one of the remaining students in the classroom was watching them.* * *\u2018Hmm. Is this a private classroom?\u2019Standing in front of the room called the laboratory, I felt a little strange.As it is Theon, the new teachers are given a considerable amount of personal space. The name plate at the entrance also had the name Rudger Chelici.\u2018Let\u2019s go inside.\u2019I was curious to see what the inside looked like, so I decided to check it out.I opened the door and entered the classroom and I couldn\u2019t help but be surprised to see the person who was inside.\u201cOh. Mr. Rudger. Come in.\u201dOne of the people I have to watch out for here, the president of Theon Academy was inside.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Naturally, I sat across from the president who was sitting on the guest sofa.She looked at me and smiled but it was the president who spoke first.\u201cHow is it? The interior design is so pretty, isn\u2019t it?\u201dThere is no point in saying such things.\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cTheon Academy provides each teacher with their own personal space. Ms. Rudger is free to do anything you want to feel comfortable here.\u201d\u201cI like that.\u201dThe president\u2019s golden eyes turned to me. I also looked at her without avoiding her gaze.I saw myself in the beautiful amber-like eyes. It was the same when we first met, but when I looked into the eyes of the president, something made my body itchy.I immediately switched the topic.\u201cWhat did you come here for, sir?\u201d\u201cDid I come to a place I shouldn\u2019t be?\u201d\u201cIt is because I am curious that a busy person like the president would come to the personal space of a new teacher like this.\u201d\u201cThen it\u2019s not like I\u2019ve come to a place I couldn\u2019t come?\u201d\u201cBut it\u2019s burdensome.\u201dWhen I spoke directly, the president kept her mouth shut.The gentle smile was still there, but in her eyes, a strange emotion that was hard to understand was spreading like drops of ink dropped into water.The president shook her head.\u201cThere is no particular reason.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cNo matter how new Mr. Rudger is, he is a precious teacher who has been assigned to the Theon Academy. Of course, as president, I have to pay attention.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dWhen I nodded, she showed a sullen expression as if she was dissatisfied.\u201cYou can be a little more surprised.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m already surprised enough.\u201dIt\u2019s not a lie, it\u2019s true.I opened the door with a pounding heart because it was my personal space, but when I saw the president, I was very surprised. Even if I ran into a ghost on the street in the middle of the night, I was confident that I wouldn\u2019t be more surprised than this.In fact, even now, my heart is beating like crazy, so I\u2019m worried that the president might hear it.\u201cAll the other teachers were surprised.\u201d\u201cHave you visited other teachers?\u201d\u201cMr. Rudger is the last.\u201dWhy was I last? And does the president plan to interview the new teachers? I suddenly remembered the existence of the secret society that had permeated Theon.\u2018Perhaps.\u2019The president noticed something? No matter how secretive it was, it was impossible to completely hide its tail.\u2018She must have noticed that those with suspicious movements had entered Theon.\u2019If I didn\u2019t realize before but now that I know there is a secret society here, the attitude of the president seems to be different.Does she doubt me?\u2018There is a possibility.\u2019It\u2019s a bit unfair for me, but honestly, I have no objection. I\u2019m not a member of the secret society, but I\u2019m a secret society executive.I wonder how the hell this happened, but this is actually my situation right now. When I think about it, my real identity is not so proud, so I have to work hard to avoid being found out.\u201cWhat did the president come to ask me?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m also going to check how the first class was. You had just finished class, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWas there ever a case where the students had a hard time or something like that?\u201d\u201cThere was nothing.\u201dRather, I wondered if it would be okay if the students didn\u2019t ask me questions like this.Well, there were times when I was intentionally telling them not to approach me, but I just meant not to bother me too much, I didn\u2019t know anyone would do it. Ah. Still, the daughter of the Lumos family asked a question.\u201cHmm. That\u2019s amazing. I looked at the list of students attending Mr. Rudger\u2019s lecture this time, and there were many famous students.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cDid you not see the list?\u201d\u201cNow I have brought it for you to see.\u201dI waved the paper in my hand.\u201cWell, Mr. Rudger is up to you, but just in case you don\u2019t know. The princess is also there, so please be careful not to cause any problems.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dPrincess? I wonder why someone like the princess came to my class.Suddenly, I remember the blonde student who asked me a bold question. Come to think of it, when I said that she had a familiar face, was it her bloodline?\u201cAnd I heard that there are many freshmen. Originally, I thought you would only teach the second years, but I think you taught it as a joint class with the first years.\u201d\u201cBecause I had no intention of differentiating between the first year and the second year.\u201d\u201cI am not trying to blame you. Rather, I\u2019m in favor of Mr. Rudger\u2019s method of making a change of his own. Especially among the first graders, I see some pretty amazing kids.\u201d\u201cAmazing kids?\u201d\u201cYes. [Unusual] There are children who use magic, there are children from great families, and there are children who have been raised quite hard in the tower. I usually think that there is a gap when there is a difference in grades, but I think that will be rare for these freshmans.\u201dThinking of her students and smiling brightly, I thought she deserved the position of president of the academy.Every time I see that smile, my skin tingles.First of all, I\u2019m not in a position to speak with confidence in my conscience, so I just gave a brief reply while listening to the president\u2019s words.\u201cWell, anyway, our Theon has high expectations for Mr. Rudger Chelici.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re praising me too much.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m glad that there were no problems in the first class and that the first impressions with the students seemed to be okay. No need to worry.\u201dAfter saying these words, the president got up from her seat.I asked politely.\u201cCan we have a cup of tea?\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dWas it surprising that I said this? She showed a slightly bewildered expression, and then she rolled her eyes like a crescent moon.\u201cI appreciate the suggestion, but I have a lot of work to do.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d\u201cAnd Mr. Rudger has just arrived, so do you know where the car is and where the cup is in this office?\u201d\u201cIt must be on the inside of a shelf somewhere.\u201d\u201cDing. In fact, we only prepared coffee. If you want to drink tea, you have to apply separately for it.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cYou can find out in the future. Then, I wish you all the best in the future.\u201dThe president greeted with a playful smile and left behind those words. She was truly a gentle storm.I let out a small sigh and rubbed my eyelids with my fingers.* * *\u201cHow was it?\u201dWilford, an old gentleman, followed the president as she walked down the hallway with a leisurely pace and asked.\u201cAre your doubts about Mr. Rudger cleared?\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026Well.\u201dThe President recalled the conversation she had with Rudger Chelici, specifically the restrained attitude he showed.\u201cNot completely.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201dRudger Chelici was a unique man. The president thought so.When anyone meets her gaze they are captivated by her golden eyes. To be precise, her eyes themselves are a reverberation of her innate magical power, enchanting magic.It is the power that the president possesses, and the number one reason that made her rise to this position.Of course, she didn\u2019t intentionally use the magical eyes of charm on her opponent. This is a kind of innate constitution, so if anyone makes eye contact with her, they will get caught without her intention.Thankfully, she was able to control it to some extent now, but her daily life was difficult in the past.Now that she has become the president, she admits frankly that she would not have been able to come to this position without her eyes.She tried to open up her inner thoughts using her personal interview as a pretext.\u2018My magical eyes tend to be more influenced by the other person\u2019s magic power.\u2019Her magic eyes can affect even 4th rank wizards. Of course, the premise is that the opponent did not use mind-defense magic.In particular, the greater the magical power they have, the more easily the opponent would succumb. The power of the magic eye is proportional to the total amount of magic the opponent has.But Rudger didn\u2019t.He must be in the 4th rank, but his reaction is completely different from other teachers.The first time she met him was when he had just entered her office and this is the second time. The man did not show any shaking even after seeing his magic eyes twice.Did he resist the power of her magic eyes only with his steel will? The president\u2019s eyes lit up.\u2018He\u2019s a fun guy.\u2019The president had no choice but to think so but she can\u2019t express her feelings explicitly.\u201cA suspicious movement has been caught, so we are looking at the people who are most dubious, but there are no results.\u201dEver since she found out that an unsavory group has been hiding in Theon, she had been unable to ignore even the smallest of things.Among them, Rudger Chelici was embroiled in a train attack while on his way here. It\u2019s not his fault though.What if the train attack was a diversion and the person named Rudger Chelici was swapped out in the meantime?The president sent Wilford, the henchman she trusted the most, and one of the strongest among this Theon\u2019s powers with the pretext of escorting him to the academy.\u201cWhat do you think, Mr. Wilford?\u201d\u201cHmm. I don\u2019t think I can trust him right away, but I haven\u2019t found anything particularly suspicious about him.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201dIf Wilford said that, he would be one of them or he could be innocent. Or maybe he\u2019s such a great guy that he completely fooled them.\u2018For now, I can only hope that it is not the latter.\u2019There are so many things to be concerned about right now, so she decided to stop worrying about Rudger.\u201cAh. But I can be sure of one thing.\u201d\u201cWhat is that?\u201d\u201cThat man, Rudger Chelici, is by no means ordinary.\u201d\u201cWhat did you see to say that?\u201d\u201cI can only answer that it is an old man\u2019s sense.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dWilford seemed quite sympathetic to Rudger Chelici at first.If Wilford, who has a clear eye for people, says that, she can believe it. Still, she didn\u2019t completely dismiss her doubts because at any moment, that possibility could lead to the worst outcome.A wizard is a being who needs to think deeply about every possibility. Above all else, she is the president of Theon Academy.Since she is a person who has risen to an impeccable position that does not tolerate even an inch of negligence, she has no choice but to be careful in all cases.* * *Left alone, I was able to relax my shoulders and let out a sigh only after I saw her step away from the door. I\u2019m tired.\u2018The president visited me suddenly.\u2019Well, in her words, it\u2019s like a normal personal interview with new teachers. The president or someone who is going to be the president suddenly comes and says it, but who would believe it?I think they were all interrogated.\u2018That\u2019s not what\u2019s important.\u2019I went straight to my personal desk and sat down. The desk made of luxurious wood looked quite expensive. A clock made of cog wheels on one wall and on the other wall, the map of Theon is fixed to the board and spread out.Red curtains are spread to the left and right by the window with an antique design, and even the chair I\u2019m sitting on is very luxurious.I was once amazed at Theon resources for allocating this amount of space to a new teacher, and again admired that it was filled with all kinds of luxurious things.I looked through the list of students attending my lectures.\u2018It was real.\u2019On the list of students taking classes, there was a student with an unusually long and wonderful name.2nd year Erendira von Exilion.If has the name of the empire Exilion as her surname, one would know that she is of noble blood, unless one is a fool.\u2018Isn\u2019t that the kid who boldly asked me during the first orientation?\u2019The princess taking my class is burdensome.Even though Theon is said to be like a third area where autonomy is guaranteed even in the Empire, it is a different story if there are people from the imperial family.If something happens to her, I will be involved as well.\u2018In the first place, there is no way that something will happen to her in Theon, but no one knows what will happen.\u2019I cannot rule out small incidents and accidents that occur when experimenting with magic reagents, conducting actual battle simulations, or performing alchemy.Even if I care about the safety of my students as much as possible, there are cases where students fight each other out of the reach of teachers.In order to eliminate such a situation as much as possible, teachers are also given the duty to protect students\u2026\u2026Now that I think about it, there is also a secret society hidden in Theon.Still, nothing will happen right away, so let\u2019s think about it calmly.I also looked closely at the list of students. Among the first and second graders, there were quite a few children who stood out.\u2018Flora from the Lumos family, and even nobles from other kingdoms?\u2019Then all of a sudden, my eyes turned to a student and stopped.\u2018Aidan.\u2019He wasn\u2019t brought up in a particularly great family, and he wasn\u2019t taught by a famous wizard. He was just a commoner.Since he came here, he must have had some talent, but I couldn\u2019t find anything special about him compared to other students.\u2018Something familiar.\u2019There was something that strangely caught my attention.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 17": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Academy\u2019s Undercover ProfessorCH 17Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaygot a fake job at the academy C17: Doubt (2)\u2018I can\u2019t remember right now.\u2019Even when I thought about Aidan, nothing immediately came to mind, so I decided to move on.I put all the personal details of the rest of the students into my head. A total of 54 students in the first year and 26 students in 2nd year.The ratio of 1st and 2nd graders is roughly 2:1. I thought that the number of first graders was higher because of the color of the nameplate, but it was more than I thought.\u2018Even among first-year students, there are some guys to be wary of, especially the newcomers promoted by Magic Tower and the Alchemy School.\u2019Even students with mediocre grades in Theon are called geniuses if they go outside and it is said that all geniuses are out of line somewhere.After checking the list of all the students, I put the papers on the desk and pressed my finger on my flaky forehead.\u2019I am tired in many ways.\u2019I reflected on the meeting and conversation with the president a while ago. When I think of the president coming to me, it means that I haven\u2019t fully earned her trust yet.She\u2019s not completely suspicious, it\u2019s probably half and half. Depending on how I act in the future, there is a high possibility that her gaze towards me will be different.\u2018I do not care.\u2019As long as I have already decided to take on the role I am assigned to, I have no intention of showing suspicious behavior. The president is a <Lexorer> at the sixth rank, which is almost the highest among the eight existing ranks.I heard she\u2019s very close to the 7th rank.Even 100 rank 4 wizards have no chance against her.\u2018Even so, the biggest problem is the secret society.\u2019The secret society is quiet because it is the beginning of the current semester, but if time passes and there is a chance to move around, it will move right away.The question is why have they infiltrated Theon Academy? What are you trying to do by planting people here while dealing with some members of the academy? Are they hoping to overthrow Theon? Or is there something in Theon?\u2018Maybe it\u2019s some kind of action against the Empire.\u2019I took a piece of newspaper stuck between the papers and unfolded it. Newspaper articles written in black letters still talked about the last terrorist attack on the magic engineering train.[The magic engineering train terror incident was eventually revealed to be the work of the revolutionary army.]It seemed almost certain that the revolutionary army was behind the train attack.\u2018To be honest, I am nothing more or less than a terrorist.\u2019If it was the original history of the earth, the politics at this time would have felt like a parliamentary system was added to the modern constitutional monarchy, but in this world where magic exists, the kings and nobles still had very strong authority.Still, seeing all kinds of various movements taking place in this world over the past 50 years, this world also tends to flow similarly to the trend on the Earth where I lived.Magic has stagnated and science has risen rapidly. At the same time, even magic engineering was born by combining science and magic. It is simply surprising that this drastic change took place less than a century ago.That was the reason the revolutionary army arose.\u2018However, there is a high possibility that the secret association has nothing to do with the real revolutionaries.\u2019To put it bluntly, the death of the real First Order, Rudger Chelici, assured me of that. If they were in the same organization, why would he have died because of the train attack?His reaction then was from someone that had never expected the train he was riding on would be attacked. \u00a0It can be said that the train attack was not expected at all by the secret society.\u2018It would be right to separate the secret society and the revolutionary army.\u2019And there is one more fact that can be guessed here.The First Order, Rudger Chelici, was not suitable for battle. He definitely had a talent for magic and pretty good judgment. He must have been highly trained.\u2018When my subordinate saw my face, she just passed me on as the First Order. That means that even they don\u2019t know the face of Rudger on the train.\u2019Why? They thought it was normal for Rudger to change his appearance?\u2018If they thought it was natural for Rudger\u2019s face to change, I can tell the character of the dead Rudger Chelici.\u2019In other words, the characteristics of the First Order are disguise and infiltration. That was rather fortunate for me. At least, there is no reason to doubt other members of the organization by their appearanceIt\u2019d be nice to be at peace.\u2018For now, I\u2019m not going to do anything using my First Order identity in order to clear the Academy\u2019s suspicions.\u2019The troublesome things can be done by my subordinates, so I only have to focus on solidifying my position as the First Order. I probably won\u2019t have to worry about it for a while.However, when the secret society rises to the surface and becomes active the problems will arise in earnest. From planting an executive-level figure as a teacher, it was clear that they were planning to overthrow Theon in some way.\u2018It\u2019s complicated.\u2019It doesn\u2019t look like Theon will be destroyed easily, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s an impenetrable fortress. No matter how powerful an empire is, it is bound to collapse, history has proven it.In particular, in an era of extreme transitional form like these days, the possibility becomes closer to reality even the slightest possibility that the secret society will overthrow Theon cannot be ignored.\u2018In that case, it would be better to leave Theon and entrust myself to the secret society.\u2019No. That\u2019s not okay. I have to do that to live, but I won\u2019t last long.It shouldn\u2019t be a problem if I\u2019m pretending to be a teacher for now under the guise of Rudger Chelici but what if the other First Order notices Rudger\u2019s subtle change?\u2018They will definitely find out.\u2019I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to face when they discover that I\u2019m a traitor. I\u2019d rather have the best chance of surviving if I intentionally interfere with their plans while maintaining this teacher\u2019s position. But again, if I openly stand on the side of Theon, the society will immediately notice my betrayal.\u2018I\u2019m walking on an extremely thin rope.\u2019Unless I know what the purpose of the secret society is, I can\u2019t plan my course of action right now.I picked up a pen and wrote down on a blank piece of paper what I was planning for the future.-Be on the lookout for the First Order of the secret society. I need to quickly find out who it is. After that, avoid contact as much as possible.-Maintain your position as a teacher. Don\u2019t neglect the class.\u2013 In order not to raise suspicions on the side of the academy, for now, focus on working as a teacher.Roughly speaking, it\u2019s these three for now.I didn\u2019t worry that anyone would ever see this post since I wrote it in Korean, so people in this world will not know what this means even when they read it.\u2018Hmm. All I can do right now is do my best as a teacher.\u2019\u201cTock tock.\u201dI tapped the wooden desk with my fingertips.If the secret society contacts me and asks why I\u2019m not acting I can use my job as an excuse for now.I immediately pulled out a new piece of paper to write on and picked up my pen. I had an acquaintance who was originally supposed to meet somewhere else, but I had to tell him that I couldn\u2019t go there.\u2018I have a lot of work to do.\u2019Actually, I had to deal with it on the first day, but I forgot because there were so many things to take care of. Well, there\u2019s nothing to regret about this, so the guy won\u2019t say anything.I thought of the possibility that someone might open this letter, so I wrote it in a roundabout way as much as possible instead of speaking directly.Like Rudger Chelici\u2019s letter, I also used a passphrase. Finally at the end of the letter I added one more phrase.[Don\u2019t forget to bring my luggage.]* * *The reply to the letter I sent came the very next day. The promise written in the letter is to meet next weekend at the Leathervelk industrial park.As for me, I wanted to meet him a little earlier, but I agreed since I understand that we\u2019re busy with work in our own way.After checking the letter, I immediately burned it in case something happened. \u00a0I immediately got out of the office and headed to the dormitory in light clothes.\u201cExcuse me\u2026!\u201dThen someone hurriedly came up and called me.He seems to be a Theon employee, but seeing that his clothes are neater than other people\u2019s, he seemed to be an errand man.\u201cAre you Mr. Rudger Chelici?\u201d\u201cYes. What do you want?\u201dWhen I asked that, the messenger flinched and showed a slightly terrified expression.While I wondered if even the employees were avoiding me, the messenger handed me a document.\u201cWhat is this?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a patrol watch ticket.\u201dWasn\u2019t that usually done by the members or the guard? Why do teachers do that?As I stared at him with that kind of gaze, the messenger broke into a cold sweat and made excuses.\u201cIt seems that this time there was an instruction from the president. Now that the new students enter the school, it is the most lax period for the students of Theon, so this was done in order to prevent the students from causing any problems.\u201d\u201cEven teachers have to participate?\u201d\u201cThe president said the teachers would be the most effective and in the contract, there is a clause that teachers must also step in to prevent problems that occur inside Theon.\u201dCome to think of it, there was such a clause. However, I thought it was meant to be done in moderation at the discretion of the teachers.I didn\u2019t know I would be so active.\u201cHmm.\u201dMaybe it\u2019s because I accepted my attributions differently?The messenger was sweating in a cold sweat and hastily added an ambiguous explanation.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to stay up all night. You just need to check from time to time until the dorm curfew.\u201d\u201cAnd today is my turn?\u201d\u201cYes\u201dI got my watch ticket from the messenger without a word. It had the name Rudger Chelici written on it for today\u2019s date. Since there are many other teachers besides me at Theon, I think they only do this kind of patrol once a week.It\u2019s going to be a little annoying if I have to do it on the weekend.\u201cOkay then.\u201dThe messenger, who had delivered everything he had to say, hurriedly left the place as if running away from me.I ignored the messenger and looked through the list.\u2018Since Theon is so wide, every teacher moves around his designated area?\u2019Today, there were three more people on the watch besides me. Among them, I saw the name of Selina, the new Elemental teacher who was assigned with me this time.Well, since our areas are different, we won\u2019t run into each other, but if we do, let\u2019s say hello.\u2018More than that, the fact that this was not the case in the first place, but suddenly implemented under the direction of the president, means that the president also suspects that there are spies among the teachers.\u2019Perhaps the reason teachers were called this way is to detect suspicious contact or movement. If you are a spy, you will not act hastily unless you are an idiot, but that does not mean that the president\u2019s policy is meaningless.The fact that the president gave such an instruction is because it acts as a deterrent by itself to instill a sense of awareness so that the other party does not act recklessly.This is kind of a warning.From the president\u2019s point of view, it is a policy where there is nothing to lose if a suspicious person is caught and a warning can be sent even if no one is caught.\u2018Nominally, there is no objection to the fact that the excited students might cause problems at the start of the school year, so the teachers are taking steps to prevent the incident.\u2019They\u2019re not ordinary students, they\u2019re geniuses who use magic, but of course, the scale of thinking is different from the general ones.What new teacher would dare to reject the president\u2019s order? Even in an academy, hierarchies exist. If it\u2019s black, it should be black.For reference, the patrol area I was assigned to was <Magic Training Grounds>.\u201c\u2026This is true.\u201dThe training ground was a place frequented by students to show off their magic skills, so it was difficult not to have any problems.Did she send me here on purpose? I hoped not as I was heading to the patrol area.* * *The magic training ground was not far from the main building. Close enough to reach in 10 minutes on a well-paved footpath.A large structure can be seen through the trees in the moderately manicured garden. The overall design is an exterior reminiscent of a super-large greenhouse.\u2018It\u2019s filthy big.\u2019Even on Earth, the size of the training ground is so large that it cannot be properly viewed. There are three such buildings.They are called Training Grounds 1, 2, and 3 respectively, and Training Ground 3, the largest of these, is also the main stage of Theon Academy\u2019s Event, \u300cMagic Festival\u300d.First, I looked at the nearest training ground 3, and there were no problems, so I passed.There were only a few people at the second training ground that I stopped by after that, and most of them went back to the dormitory after finishing their training.Now, I was just about to check the last remaining training ground No. 1.\u201cHow dare you, such a lowly commoner!\u201dAlong with the high-pitched voice that seemed to tear in octave units, I could feel the magical energy fluctuating inside the training ground.Sensing that my anxiety had become a reality, I immediately ran to the inside of the training ground.When I ran down the hallway and arrived at the handrail of the audience a girl was seen trying to shoot her magic at another girl. The magic she used was\u2013Second-level spell [Burning Thunder].Even if it is a second-level spell, it is a magic that can inflict fatal damage if the opponent is defenseless.\u2019I shouldn\u2019t be late.\u2019I immediately activated a spell. Even though the magic that the student casted was almost complete, with the source code, my 3rd level and lower spells are faster than anyone else.The magic I used is a first-class release magic [Shining Stone]. Just before the student magic was completed by my [Shining Stone] pierced the center of the magic circle and smashed it.\u201cWho is it!\u201dThe student whose spell was destroyed glared at me with an angry gaze.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Since it is so wide and there are as many as three such training grounds, students can freely practice their magic in a spacious space wherever they go.In particular, first-year students who are curious about the prestigious Theon facilities are the ones who use the training ground the most at the beginning of the semester. As a result, it was only the first graders who naturally had minor accidents.The children, who entered the school, heard that they were geniuses wherever they went. Freshmen who have not experienced proper competition have strong self-esteem because they believe they\u2019re the best.As they progress through classes gradually, there will inevitably be conflicts and it was at Training Ground No. 1 where that happened most often.Just like right now.\u201cWhat? Say it again.\u201d\u201c\u2026This is a place that everyone can use freely. I don\u2019t have any reason to leave.\u201dRene frowned as she saw the three students staring at him with contempt.She had her gray hair, which is rare even in the Empire. She visited the 1st training ground out of her curiosity a little while ago and she got into an argument.The reason didn\u2019t matter. They\u2019re just going to use this place, so they told Rene to go somewhere else.She didn\u2019t want to leave since there aren\u2019t that many students using the training ground, and there\u2019s plenty of free space and got into an argument with the three of them, one woman and two men.All of them are children of aristocratic families and among them was a first-year student named Dunema Rommli, the daughter of Count Rommli, she was the one who told Rene to leave.\u201cIf it\u2019s uncomfortable, why don\u2019t you guys go?\u201d\u201cHow dare you talk to me? How dare a vulgar and cheeky commoner talk back to a noble blood like me?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Theon does not divide classes by nobility or bloodline. You didn\u2019t even know about that when you entered here?\u201d\u201cI guess that\u2019s what you guys just want to believe.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, Lady Dunema. That\u2019s why low-ranking commoners can\u2019t do it.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s not for nothing that people say that you shouldn\u2019t be nice to the lower ones.\u201dTwo male students flirt with Dunema from both sides.Rene bit her lip. At first, they didn\u2019t even try to listen to what she had to say because she is a commoner and if she continued to argue with them nothing would change.Rene just turned her back and ignored them, but that action must have properly touched the heart of Dunema, who had high self-esteem.\u201c\u2026\u2026Commoner, how dare you ignore what I say?\u201dCount Rommli was a typical aristocrat who fell in love with the idea of the chosen people and made fun of the common people. And Dunema, the only daughter of such a count, also deeply inherited her father\u2019s inclinations.As she grew up seeing and hearing only such things since she was a child, she had no choice but to become such a character.Dunema thought that she should be the lead role in the academy. She had a lot of great seniors in the second year, so even so, she said that she has to be the most dazzling among these first year students. But everyone who came to Theon was a genius and it was hard for her to adapt.\u2018I can\u2019t do this!\u2019Even taking classes in the same classroom as common people was embarrassing, but she didn\u2019t want to accept the fact that there were students with more talent than her. Nobility should always be lofty and stand above all, for she was the chosen one and the commoners were but her discarded tools to make her stand out.To Dunema, the commoner named Rene was an annoyance. The first time she noticed her was when she was in the classroom.Ash gray\u2019s hair color, which is rare to see around, also drew attention, but it was Rene\u2019s beauty that bothered Dunema more than anything else. She was like a doll made by the goddess of beauty, as if she was not of this world.Her self-esteem was hurt and Dunema could not forgive that. Dunema needed a target for her anger, and the target was, of course, Rene, who evoked these feelings in her, so she quarreled with her.\u2018What the hell is that cheeky attitude?\u2019Rene\u2019s eyes looking at them as if they\u2019re pathetic. Dunema gritted her teeth and glared at the back of Rene\u2019s head.\u2019You dare ignore me and think I would accept it?\u2019Dunema pulled out her wand and lifted it. It happened so unexpectedly that even her two followers did not respond.It was the same with Rene. She never imagined that Dunema would do such a thing in Theon.\u201cHow dare you, such a lowly commoner!\u201dA spell is formed with magic power, and seeds of lightning are splattered around.Rene sensed something and looking back her blue eyes widened.\u2018Stupid. It\u2019s already too late.\u2019A cruel smile formed on Dunema\u2019s lips, she didn\u2019t want to kill but ruin Rene\u2019s face.At the moment when she wanted to shoot the prepared magic into the face of that heinous commoner white flash of light pierced her magic. Seeing the reverberation of the scattered lightning, Dunema contorted her face like a demon.\u201cWho is it?\u201dShe looked in the direction the while flash came from and saw a man looking down from the audience.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dThe moment that voice mixed with subtle anger reached her ears, her skin reacted. That momentum and spirit that made her teeth collide by themselves.Dunema knew who the man was.\u201cMr. Rudger?\u201d\u201cWhile on patrol, I suddenly felt a wave of magical power and came to see it.\u201dHis gaze glances at the gang of Dunema, Rene and the students who have only watched from the vicinity, but have not stopped them.There is no such thing as a fight between students. To be precise, it is an incident where one side unilaterally tried to surprise the other.\u201cIt seems that you don\u2019t take Theon seriously.\u201dRather, if they had fought each other head-on, it could have ended with just a warning.However, arbitrarily launching a surprise attack on an opponent who is not willing to fight is undoubtedly a one-sided negligence injury. The teacher even witnessed it clearly with his own two eyes.\u201cWhat does that mean?!\u201dDunema, already full of anger, cried out in protest to Rudger.\u201cThis is to protect our authority as nobles\u2026!\u201d\u201cAuthority? What authority?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s because this commoner\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIn Theon, all students are equal. Learning, teaching, and magic are only judged by their talent and passion. I don\u2019t care what noble blood you have.\u201dRudger\u2019s words meant not to pretend to be aristocrats here.Dunema bit her lip but Rudger shook his head at the completely unrepentant act. He was convinced that the first graders would cause problems. Rather, it was possible because they were freshmen who did not know about the world yet.Of course, freshmen who don\u2019t know how Theon works, make their decisions based on the environment they\u2019ve been living in. Their narrow way of thinking where they believe that the world they lived in is everything is causing the problems.Just like Dunema Rommli in front of him right now. But not knowing is not an excuse.\u201cIt has not been long since the start of the classes, but you already caused such a big problem, please be aware that discipline cannot be avoided. You follow me right now.\u201dRudger said so and immediately turned his back.I thought that issuing a warning like this would reduce the issue. Of course, it wasn\u2019t just a warning, it was meant to be a real punishment.\u201cOnly a Fallen Nobility\u2026\u2026\u201dAfter the words of Dunema Rommli the training ground, which was still quiet, became even quieter.\u201cDu, Lady Dunema?\u201dThe two students, who could be described as followers of Dunema, were sweating profusely. This behavior was not what they wanted it to see. Even Rudger Chelici, who was about to leave, stopped walking.The faces of the students who watched the situation became pale.Dunema belatedly realized what she said but she couldn\u2019t take back the words that had already been uttered.\u201cWhat did you just say?\u201dRudger\u2019s even more subdued voice turned towards Dunema. It didn\u2019t stop there, but his body floated in the air. As if walking in the air, Rudger slowly descended from the audience, landed on the ground, and slowly walked towards Dunema.\u201cThud. Thud.\u201dWith each step Rudger took, Dunema felt as if the world was collapsing. She didn\u2019t know it when he was far away, but when she met him up close, the pressure that Rudger exuded was beyond imagination.Its appearance was like a giant, she felt that Rudger could crush her with a finger.\u201cAhhh.\u201dWithout realizing it, she said something harsh. Even so, there was something she shouldn\u2019t have said, but she crossed that line. It is no wonder that Rudger was angry.\u201cDid you say I was a fallen noble?\u201d\u201cOh, uh. Ah\u2026\u2026\u201dDunema couldn\u2019t even move her mouth properly as she looked up at Rudger. The atmosphere was almost bloody and it wouldn\u2019t be strange if someone died.\u201cMr. Rudger!\u201dFrom outside, Selina hurriedly ran and called for Rudger to stop. She, too, had just arrived after hearing the news. But as soon as she arrived, all she saw was the figure of Rudger staring intently at a shivering girl.\u2018No way. Perhaps. perhaps.\u2019Anxious thoughts ran through her mind and she hurriedly tried to stop Rudger but at that moment Rudger opened his mouth.\u201cYou\u2019re not wrong.\u201dIt was a completely unexpected thing to hear.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cNow what the teacher said\u2026\u2026\u201dShe thought he would be angry or that he\u2019d give her corporal punishment on the fly.\u201cObviously, I am a fallen nobleman but this is Theon, and I am Theon\u2019s teacher. Dunema what you said was clearly a student challenging the authority of the teacher.\u201dRudger spoke in an infinitely calm voice.\u201cYou are still young and before coming here you were an aristocrat. If it\u2019s your first time, you might not know.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cSo, I will let it go this time but know that there is no next time.\u201dA completely unexpected, yet very mature response.The students had no choice but to stare blankly at Rudger.\u201cOf course, what you did to your classmate will be punished accordingly. I hope that has enlightened you.\u201dDunema felt that the world was collapsing at his words of discipline, but she could not protest. Rudger\u2019s point-by-point remarks were far too rational, to the extent that she thought that doing this was meant to teach her.Rene shrugged at the fact that Rudger had called her name.\u201cAnd you Rene.\u201d\u201cYes, yes!\u201dRene shrugged at the fact that Rudger had called her name.\u201cAre you injured?\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cAre you injured?\u201d Rudger asked again.\u201cNo, teacher helped me so I\u2019m okay.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201dRudger immediately turned his head to look at Selina.\u201cMiss Selina. Please go back.\u201d\u201cAh yes!\u201dRudger left her training ground with those words to Selina.No one dared to move, until he disappeared into the darkness of the hallway.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Intense magical power spread in my mouth with a bitter yet elegant sensation that touches the tip of my tongue.\u2018Whoa. I will live.\u2019As the medicinal energy spreads and magical powers are supplied to the brain, the organ that had been damaged gradually returned to its original state.I sat down on a quiet bench and caught my breath.The first signal came when I stopped at the 2nd training ground. My fingers tremble slightly and my head feels dizzy. It was kind of like a chronic disease after I came into this world.\u2018If it wasn\u2019t for the medicine, it would have been a disaster.\u2019Still, I thought it was tolerable, so I checked up to Training Ground 1 and tried to take the medicine right away but I had to intervene in the freshmen\u2019s fight. No I shouldn\u2019t call it a fight since there was a clear distinction between victim and perpetrator.So I intervened in the middle and managed to prevent things from escalating. Afterwards, while talking about punishment, I felt the wave that had subsided once soared. Feeling my body telling me to put the medicine in my mouth, I quickly settled the situation and tried to leave but there was a problem.Who would have thought that she would boldly say things like fallen aristocrat there? For a moment, I didn\u2019t even know if she was talking to me, and I thought deeply in my head for about three seconds.I wonder if it was something the kid really said, and I had all kinds of complicated and long lines in my head, but my communication skills were poor. But the problem is that after hearing this, I can\u2019t just go as a teacher.\u2018I mean, why did you have to say that at that time?\u2019If I was alone I would have pretended not to hear it and passed it on, but there were too many witnesses around. In the end, in order to protect my authority as a teacher, I had to say something first, but my head did not work well, so there was nothing plausible to say.-Originally, what you did is a clear challenge to the authority of the academy.\u2013 It may be referred to the disciplinary committee according to the school rules.-You may receive a penalty or even get attention from the president.Well, I should have said these basic words, but I couldn\u2019t remember them.\u2018So I just spit out whatever came to mind.\u2019I was trying to manage the expression on my face that almost collapsed while I spoke. Maybe my face was a little distorted. There is a little bit of blood in my eyes.\u2018It won\u2019t be a big problem, will it?\u2019Anyway, Selina-sensei also came, so I succeeded in leaving in a hurry.I got up from the bench, gulping the pills in my mouth. Fortunately, it is an early symptom. If this had gotten worse here, other people might have noticed my weirdness.\u2018Is this the last medicine?\u2019When I saw that the medicine box was empty, I sighed. I put the extra medicine in the pre-mailed bag, but I didn\u2019t know it was going to turn out like this because things went wrong in the middle.\u2018Next weekend, I decided to meet him. To be honest, it seems difficult to hold on until then, so I\u2019ll have to send him another letter and tell him to come earlier.\u2019If not, I have to rent a private medicine room and make it myself, but if I do, it will be recorded in the records, which is a big deal.\u2018I hope nothing will happen until then.\u2019With my head getting clearer, I took a deep breath and set out on patrol again.* * *\u201cAre you okay?\u201d\u201cYes. Thank you for your concern.\u201d\u201cThis is my job.\u201dAlthough she vehemently said that she was okay Selina took her to her infirmary.Selina gave her a warm smile and waved her hand, but Rene was sincere.\u201cThat\u2026\u2026Teacher Selina.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cHow is that kid?\u201d\u201cYou mean Dunema? I\u2019m not sure.\u201d\u201cOh right\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cStill, according to the school rules notified in advance, it wasn\u2019t just a fight, it was a one-sided attack, so I wondered if she would receive disciplinary action even if she wouldn\u2019t be expelled from school.\u201dIt would be better if the academy would give stronger discipline to people with strong self-esteem like Dunema but both of them had a vague feeling that they wouldn\u2019t.She was still a freshman who didn\u2019t know what to do, so the lenient punishment also played a part, but above all else, since her father is a count, they will try to take care of it.\u201cWhy? Are you worried?\u201d\u201cNope. I\u2019m just curious.\u201dTo be honest, I don\u2019t feel sorry for Dunema, who attacked this way. On the contrary, it was surprising that she was not expelled from school for what she did. I was just asking because I was confused.\u201cAre you worried?\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cYour expression is showing it.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026\u201dRene nodded her head slightly.\u201cIt just seems to be more intense than I thought when I came here. I thought Theon was a place full of dreams and ideals.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cBut this time, when I spoke with a noble student, it didn\u2019t seem like that at all. Even though the person who did the wrong thing will be punished, there is no guarantee that something like this won\u2019t happen again in the future.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026yes.\u201dSelina also agreed with Rene\u2019s opinion.In Theon, royalty and commoners are said to be equal, but that was rarely true. \u00a0Even if teachers mediate students as much as possible in a neutral position, there is no way that problems won\u2019t arise when students are alone.Even some aristocratic teachers discriminated against commoners and subtly favored noble students. As a result, some who were proud of being nobles looked down on the teachers just because they were commoners or fallen aristocrats. Dunema\u2019s abusive language to Rudger was an extension of this situation.\u201cThat\u2019s right. To be honest, I also think that was harsh on Mr. Rudger.\u201dRene put her hands on her waist and puffed her cheeks as if she was trying to prove she was mad.Selina smiled softly as she looked at Rene, who had her eyes widened as if she didn\u2019t know what the teacher would say.\u201cBut it\u2019s because Mr. Rudger passed on it. There is nothing more we can say.\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you mad?\u201d\u201cOf course I am angry. I\u2019m trying hard but it must have been Mr. Rudger who had the most complicated thoughts at the time.\u201d\u201cAh.\u201dRene remembered the expression Rudger had made at that time. A shadow was cast on her face so she couldn\u2019t see well, but she must have been terrified.After she met those eyes, Dunema\u2019s face turned white. Rudger was originally a terrifying teacher, but she couldn\u2019t imagine how terrifying he would be if he was truly angry.Even so, Mr. Rudger offered to take care of her Dunema\u2019s mistake only this time. \u00a0He must have been angrier with himself than anyone else.It\u2019s not just about surrendering to the other\u2019s family and passing on it. Rather, it was more of a mercy for educating a student who was truly in need.Sure enough, Rudger had consistently looked at her with her cold gaze. There was no way that a person who showed such an attitude would have resigned from the authority of the other person\u2019s family.When he admonished Dunema, he frankly told herself that she was right. Rene looked at him and was completely surprised.\u201cSo I\u2019m going to try to believe it too. She must have done something wrong, but we\u2019re still young students, aren\u2019t we? I think there is an opportunity to change.\u201d\u201cAh.\u201d Selina scratched her head.\u201cHehehe. Sorry. Did I talk too much like an aunty?\u201d\u201cNo. Teacher Selina is also young enough. I would have called you sister if we had met outside.\u201d\u201cOh, thank you for the compliment. Rene is a good kid.\u201dSelina herself would think she was getting older, but in Rene\u2019s eyes, she was so young that if she wore her school uniform, she would only look like her senior.She is beautiful and always smiling, Selina has already been the object of adoration by some boys but she\u2019s not really aware of it.In the first place, I wonder if the mid-20s are that old.\u201cYes. Sister~. That\u2019s a good word. I wish I had a younger sister like Rene.\u201d\u201cI wish I had an older sister like Selina.\u201d\u201cReally? Oh my, you\u2019re pretty.\u201d\u201cHehe. Then, can you give me a little more points for the Elemental Studies class?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019ll depend on how hard you work.\u201dSelina smiled and returned Rene\u2019s prank.\u201cThe time has already come. I\u2019ll go look around the rest of the patrol area. You have to tell me if there is something wrong with your body.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dSelina waved and left the infirmary.She was left alone, and Rene looked at her body and thought she was fine, so she got up from the bed.\u2018By the way, Mr. Rudger called my name.\u2019When she used the training ground, she wore comfortable clothes because she was afraid that her uniform would get dirty. Naturally, back then, she didn\u2019t have a name tag, so no one knew her name. \u00a0But Rudger Chelici called her name naturally.\u2018Did you remember my name after one class?\u2019For Rudger Chelici, she\u2019s just one of 80 students, and a commoner who doesn\u2019t even need to be noticed. Still, Rudger remembered her name.Suddenly, she remembered what he said to Dunema.\u2018In Theon, everyone is equal.\u2019Like throwing a stone into a calm water surface, those words ripple through Rene\u2019s mind.If he had only said it but didn\u2019t mean it Rene would have been disappointed but Rudger didn\u2019t. \u00a0Through his actions and his unshakable convictions he instilled hope for a fair Theon.\u2018My first impression was obviously that he was a scary teacher.\u2019As a new teacher, I didn\u2019t expect much when I took his first class. However, I was surprised by the innovation of source code that Rudger showed.Even after Flora\u2019s actions he mediated the situation, he ended up warning the student even though he had been insulted.The figure that suddenly appeared and saved her in a moment of crisis was momentary, but it was like seeing a prince riding a white horse in a fairy tale. Involuntarily, her heart was pounding.\u2018No. Mr. Rudger probably didn\u2019t care just about me.\u2019I\u2019m here to learn magic, not for dramatic encounters.* * *After the incident at Training Ground No. 1, nothing unusual was found on the patrol, so I was able to return to my dormitory with peace of mind.When I got home, I immediately sent a letter to him. It was difficult to wait until next weekend, so he had to come earlier.The reply came back early in the morning.What was written on the inside was simple. The task at hand was finished earlier than expected, so he was going to come immediately.The meeting point is in the factory area beyond the eastern commercial district of Leathervelk. I wrote the letter, thinking that it would be a suitable place for people not to see.\u2018Today is Friday. Tomorrow is Saturday, so one day should be enough.\u2019It\u2019s the first weekend after the start of the semester, so the students may be excited, but will the same thing happen as the day before?With that in mind, I heard a strange story from Selina, who was having lunch with me.\u201cWerewolf?\u201d\u201cYes, werewolf.\u201dRumors about a werewolf began to circulate in Theon.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 20": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Academy\u2019s Undercover ProfessorCH 20Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayC20: Abraham Van Helsing (1)Teacher Selina, who was smiling brightly today as well, nodded her head at my question.\u201cYes. Rumors have already spread among the students. Werewolves exist only as urban legends. Is it funny?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cNo matter how many geniuses there are, I think they are still students. You don\u2019t have to care about such a joke.\u201dSelina laughed bashfully saying that the students\u2019 imaginations were so cute, but I couldn\u2019t help but sigh.It is said that the first source of the rumor was students who had gone out to the nearby city of Leathervelk the day before. At sunset the first eyewitness saw a black shadow gliding across the roof of a building through the night mist that subtly descended.I shook my head.\u201cAren\u2019t they still children?\u201d\u201cYes. Still, it was a little strange to hear that the werewolf that was seen outside the city was also seen in Theon.\u201d\u201cIn Theon?\u201d\u201cDid the children in the city spread the word, so the students inside the school saw something and thought it was a werewolf?\u201d\u201cTheon is so wide and since it is a place where all kinds of magic are spread, it is said that there are cases where strange phenomena occur due to magical powers. There really are 7 ghost stories, right?\u201d\u201cAre you talking about the 7th ghost story?\u201d\u201cYes. Did you not know?\u201d\u201cMs. Selina is well aware of ghost stories.\u201d\u201cYes Yes?!\u201dThese were just words of praise, but for some reason, Selina-sensei overreacted a bit. Her eyes widened and her cheeks flushed pink. Her hair stood up as if it had swelled a little.When she looked at me wondering why she was reacting like that, she hurriedly said as if making an excuse.\u201cI was just thinking about what topics would be good to have conversations with students\u201d\u201cOkay, calm down.\u201dSeeing her arms swaying to and fro, it felt like if I made a mistake, she might bump into a plate and spill food.\u201cNo. Not really.\u201dHowever, Ms. Selina continued to make more desperate excuses as to whether she felt something impatient in my attitude.When I thought our meal was unlikely to continue as it is, Ms. Merylda, intervened.\u201cAh. Come to think of it, Mr. Rudger, I heard that you did quite splendidly during your first class, is that true?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cIt is said that I showed a groundbreaking magic that increased the speed of spell casting. What did they say the name was?\u201d\u201cSource code!\u201dSelina also forgot her embarrassment, turned on the lights in her eyes and shouted. Due to her loud cry, a momentary but silence lingered in the teacher\u2019s dining room.Selina realized her own mistake and bowed her head. Her earlobes, exposed through her pink hair, were dyed bright red.I sighed a little and nodded my head.As I nodded my head in agreement, eyes flew in from all directions. It was the gaze of the teachers who were eating at the other table.As I was wondering why, Ms. Merylda came closer and explained it to me so that I could hear it.\u201cIt\u2019s because everyone is interested in Mr. Rudger\u2019s magic,\u201d she said.\u201cMy magic?\u201d\u201cOh. Are you pretending not to know? Mr. Rudger had already shown his magic in his first class, and rumors spread within Theon.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201dI put a piece of meat in my mouth and figured out how things were going.\u2018Are they interested?\u2019From the first day of class, I vaguely guessed that it was going to be like this.From the point of view of the people of this world, the source code borrowing the 21st century computer programming method would be truly innovative. It was fully expected that the ripple effect would surely reach other teachers as well.\u201cI heard that it dramatically shortened the speed of spell casting. Is it true?\u201d\u201cYes. That\u2019s enough to make a lot of money by filing a patent to the tower.\u201dSelina responded as well.Well, to say the least, it\u2019s not wrong. Source code will become a wind of change in the now stagnant magic society. In fact, if I provide this kind of magic to the tower that has a magic patent system, I will be able to sit on a cushion of money.\u201cI don\u2019t care about that.\u201dI pretended not to be humble, but I know better than anyone that it is better not to apply for a patent.For those who do not yet know what it is, providing a newly developed magic to the tower would be a great thing, but the reality is a little different. There is definitely a magic patent system in Magic Tower.Wizards who lack money want to make money using such a patent system, but such a good appearance is only superficial. Even a patent becomes a patent only if it is properly recognized by the tower.The problem is that most of the magic that is submitted as a patent is usually hit with all kinds of excuses in the Magic Tower.\u2018I\u2019d rather just make excuses. There are many people who would abuse this.\u2019Other new teachers may still have a positive perception of the tower, but I have a different perspective because I have already experienced how dirty and degrading the tower is.Indeed, even if those old judges developed a new magic that could not be criticized, the problem still exists.\u2018If you don\u2019t have a supporter or the backbone of an aristocratic family, you will be robbed of the magic to be patented.\u2019Or, if a person is dissatisfied with the tower and does not apply for a patent, he may be dragged into a back alley and forced to give up the magic.Actually there was such a case.In other words, the patent system used by the tower is nothing more than a fake with no reputation. Knowing that, I did not dedicate my magic to the tower to make money.\u2018At least, Rudger\u2019s status is better now.\u2019Although he is a fallen aristocrat, he is currently working as a teacher in Theon, so it is not bad in terms of awareness. However, even with such a status, if I\u2019m careless, my nose will be cut with my eyes open.A stagnant place where greedy old men are rampant it\u2019s like gooey mud.In any country, such a place is disgusting and deliberately showing the source code in Theon was an act that involved some calculation.First, spread the word to the students and tell them that the groundbreaking magic source code was invented by Rudger Chelici.Rumors among students spread will to the teachers, and even among teachers, rumors will spread to the outside of Theon. That\u2019s how it\u2019ll get into the ears of the tower.For a person to go in with their head bowed first and apply for a patent, it is a mistake, however, when the other side approaches me because they are anxious about the appearance of a new magic, then our positions are reversed.And the status of the Rudger will rise even higher. He is a teacher of Theon with considerable talent, rather than a new teacher who has nothing.If you have a business card like this, they won\u2019t be able to ignore me easily. It will take some time, but there is nothing better to solidify my position.\u2018But the problem is that other teachers are turning their eyes to me.\u2019Selina and Merylda are fine because of their good personalities, but the other teachers have been blatantly jealous of me. In particular, Chris Benimore\u2019s eyes, one of the teachers who joined at the same time as me, seem to have the magma seeping in his eyes.I\u2019ll kill people with those eyes.\u201cI\u2019m sorry though\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be sorry for showing it to students first.\u201dI turned around like that and got up from my seat.\u201cI will go first. I have my next class.\u201d\u201cAh yes! Work hard!\u201d\u201cGoodbye~.\u201dI nodded my head lightly to the two teachers who greeted me, and then quickly walked out of the teacher\u2019s dining room.* * *Merylda narrowed her eyes as she looked at Rudger as he left. From the first time she saw him, she thought he was a great man, but after talking to him a while ago, she realized for sure.\u2018Instead of revealing it to the tower, he kept it secret until now and showed it in the first class.\u2019From Merylda\u2019s point of view, Rudger\u2019s behavior was not like a wizard these days. Because he is too cold-hearted, he lacks a lot of empathy, so he is selfish and lacks consideration for others.In the world of magic now, even a master who should teach someone does not trust his pupil. She felt desperate because she had also been through a similar situation.But what about Rudger?Although he possessed that great magic, he did not show off his skills around him. And what\u2019s even more surprising is that his magic was used in front of the students.\u2018No matter how young the students are, if you show them how to use magic, some savvy people might catch it.\u2019Doesn\u2019t that guy even worry about losing his magic? There are only two reasons for doing this. One, the magic is too difficult.\u2018Or.\u2019I determined that it doesn\u2019t matter if I lose it.\u2018Ah, maybe.\u2019But it wasn\u2019t until then that he showed the dignified attitude he showed when he ate a little while ago.That can\u2019t be the explanation.\u2018This kind of person is a new teacher like me.\u2019The more she thought about it, the more humble she felt. Merylda sighed and turned to her side. \u00a0Selina, her classmate and close friend stared blankly at Rudger\u2019s departure.\u2018I\u2019m pretty obsessed with this one too.\u2019After Merylda shook her head, saying she couldn\u2019t help it, she immediately smiled mischievously and tapped her fingertips on the nape of her Selina\u2019s neck.* * *The Saturday after the theory class.At noon, when the sun was shining brightly, I went to Leathervelk, a city near Theon. First of all, it was nominally a simple walk to see the nearby city, but in reality, it was because I had a prior commitment.The appointment is in the evening, but there is still plenty of time left. I came out earlier to see what Leathervelk was like.\u2018The city itself looks pretty cool.\u2019Leathervelk, a city with advanced engineering, is a huge city with more than 500 km of Ramzier River flowing through its center.The flowing rivers and countless railroads on the ground were blood vessels that instill the vitality of the city, and the people living in it are full of vitality.Leathervelk, which has become the center of all kinds of commerce, magic, and engineering, has earned the reputation of being the most developed city because it is adjacent to Theon Academy.I walked through \u2018Center Pod\u2019, the main street of Leathervelk. Unlike other districts, here, gentlemen and ladies in suits were quietly enjoying their leisure time.Center Pod, a place that symbolizes the revival of Leathervelk. This is a residential complex inhabited by the wealthy, the trees were beautifully carved, and steam and golem wagons roamed every road.I sat on the terrace of a secluded cafe and drank coffee. Even on weekends, the subtle scent of coffee beans that permeated the quiet cafe and the scent of the coffee I drink mix to evoke a strange mood.\u2018That\u2019s cool.\u2019It is a beautiful place and I want to live in a place like this at least once. It is natural to have such a thought.\u2018A house is definitely expensive.\u2019I got up from my seat, paid for my coffee and I headed to the next area.\u2018Grand Chapel\u2019 is the downtown area most frequented by people in Leathervelk. A huge white cathedral in the Gothic Revival style stood tall. It wasn\u2019t just the downtown area but it was full of all sorts of things that I had never really seen before.Machines that emit white steam from external combustion engines made of brass and mechanics that work on those machines.Children playing with small clockwork toys.People on the street playing accordions, cellos, and violins, and citizens dancing while listening to the music.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dAs I wandered around the city like that, the sun was setting.\u201cDang. Dang. Dang.\u201dHuge clock towers towering all over the city rang the bells announcing that it was 6 o\u2019clock. Since it was early spring, when there were still traces of winter, the sun set early and the air that touched the skin quickly cooled.I fastened the front of the black coat I was wearing and headed to the meeting place.So far, I have only seen the beautiful appearance of Leathervelk, but the place I go this time is the opposite. Shadows cast clearly under intense light. It was a place called the ugly bare face of this city.Pushing the wide-brimmed hat on my head even deeper, I walked through the mist rising from the waters of the Ramzier River.When even the clouds of blazing scarlet flames drifted westward, and the dark blue skies covered the entire city of Leathervelk I stood in front of an alleyway in the factory area where there was a thick fog.There is no one here. Street vagrants also gave up begging and returned to the depths of the alleyways, and children coughing harshly and working to earn a living went home.I am the only one hereThe scarlet light from the street lamp collides with the fog and scatters haze. In that empty stillness, I leaned my back against the smudged bricks, waiting for the person I was supposed to meet.\u2018I came early and you\u2019re late.\u2019Just as I was thinking about it, I heard a sound from the back of the alley where I was leaning.\u2018Creepy.\u2019It is a sound that a human vocal cord can never make.I turned my back from the wall and looked into the alleyway. A pair of red eyes appeared from the inside of an unknown space where gray mist and black darkness were half mixed.\u2018It\u2019s true.\u2019I remembered Selina words from the previous day in the dining room, the rumor that the students saw werewolves. She went on to say that it was just a ghost story, but looking at that now, I wondered what she would think.At that moment the being in the dark rushed forward in an instant. I stared at it and immediately raised my fist and slammed it on his head.\u201cKoo!\u201dScreams spread briefly in the fog.I looked down at the guy sitting in front of me.\u201cWhy are you late, are you trying to play with me?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time.\u201dSaying that, the guy who pats his aching head with his hand is the acquaintance I was going to meet, and can be called my subordinate.\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time, Hans.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time, older brother.\u201dHe was the one who spread rumors of a werewolf among students.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Call me Rudger Chelici.\u201d\u201cYou mean Rudger Chelici? Ah. Come to think of it, that was the name that sent me the letter. What the hell happened? Why aren\u2019t we meeting in the capital where we were originally supposed to?\u201d\u201cIt is long to explain. Rather\u2026.\u201dRudger glanced at Hans and shook his head.\u201cEven now an accident happened. What kind of bullshit is that?\u201d\u201cDamn it. Who wants to be like this?\u201dHans\u2019s current appearance resembled that of a werewolf and anyone who would see him on the street would scream and run away.It\u2019s dark now, but if they saw this in broad daylight, people would have felt puzzled rather than running away because Hans\u2019s appearance did not have the ferocity characteristic of a werewolf. To be precise, he even had a cuteness that did not match his size.\u201cWhat bit you this time?\u201d\u201cA brown puppy in the arms of an old woman suddenly ran up to me and who knew she would bite me?\u201d\u201cLooking at your expression I can roughly tell what happened.\u201dHans, half-human and half-beast, has brown hair. However, rather than the dark and dull color of a wolf roaming the wild, it is closer to the conspicuous bright side.Above all, the shape of the face is very different from that of a wolf. A little shorter than the long head of a wolf, with a short mouth and bright eyes.Its appearance was very similar to the [Pomeranian], which is famous as a cute pet dog. The hairy puppy that bit him was a Pomeranian.\u201cI\u2019ve felt it for a long time, but you are born with a very interesting constitution.\u201d\u201cDamn it. Don\u2019t laugh at someone else\u2019s business. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve been cursed or anything.\u201dHans is a human born with a slightly unusual constitution. That is, when an animal bites him, he changes into its form and right now he looks like a werewolf.\u2018However, it\u2019s a flaw that it\u2019s different from a normal werewolf.\u2019Werewolves, as the name suggests, only transform into wolves during a full moon, but Hans did not. Hans remains normal even when he sees the full moon, but only forcibly mutates when bitten by an animal.It can be said that Hans, who can change in this way, has quite a lot of power, the problem is the timing.\u2018In today\u2019s advanced age of civilization and science wolves, tigers, and bears are found only in the mountains.\u2019And the precondition that he can only change through bites is absurd.As a result, Hans said that the animals he could easily encounter in the city were stray cats, wild dogs, or pet dogs kept by the ladies.It even overlaps with the problem of whether his unique constitution is working in some way, or whether the animals rush to him when they see Hans.If Hans is a little careless, he will get bitten by a small beast and forcibly transformed into a half-human and half-beast.Hans\u2019 powers are different from magic and closer to supernatural powers.\u201cTake it.\u201dRudger took an injection ampoule of green reagent from his pocket and threw it at Hans.Hans hastily grabbed the ampoule with both hands and put it directly into his forearm with a happy face. Then immediately a change occurred.The hair that had grown on the body decreased, and his size that had grown was gradually reduced. The bright and cute Pomeranian face also changed into a man with a slightly mean look.Hans, who returned to normal, touched his body here and there, and sighed in relief.\u201cWheeyu. If it wasn\u2019t for the hyung, I would have been struggling for a few more days.\u201d\u201cIf you think about it, yes.\u201dIt\u2019s been quite some time since Rudger met Hans. At that time, Hans could not control his constitution, so he was called a monster and was being pursued.Still, if he had the power to turn into a beast, he could act as the king in a back alley, but he was a guy who couldn\u2019t fight by nature, so he just wandered around to avoid persecution.Meeting Rudger at that time was the fortune of a lifetime for Hans.\u201cI almost died when we first met,\u201d he said.\u201cI thought you were a cryptid wandering the city.\u201dCryptid refers to a monster that appears in various parts of the city now that real monsters have disappeared. These guys can be seen as the remnants of monsters.Compared to monsters that exist in reality, it was more of a supernatural phenomenon. Demon beasts, spirit beasts, and other strange beasts or beings shaped by negative emotions in response to magical powers.The reason Rudger sought Hans was because he received a cryptid subjugation quest. But when he first met Hans, Rudger was quite embarrassed to realize that he was not the werewolf he had envisioned.Hans at that time was half-human, resembling a Chihuahua.\u201cI was quite surprised to find out that you were a human being who could speak properly.\u201d\u201cWere you surprised by that? I was even more surprised by your behavior, who developed a cure so quickly.\u201d\u201cIt is not a cure. It\u2019s more like a neutralizer.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201dHans snorted.Rudger nodded as he did not deny it.\u201cRather than this, your pseudonym is Rudger Chelici. Are you also a teacher at Theon Academy? When the hell did you change your identity as Rudger Chelici? It sounds like you blew it up a bit. Do you know how surprised I was that you suddenly became a teacher at Theon?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a long story.\u201dStarting with the terrorist train attack, Rudger explained how he became a Theon teacher.After hearing the last words, Hans couldn\u2019t help but burst into laughter.\u201cPu ha ha ha! Big brother is great. How could you say you were Rudger there?\u201d\u201cIf I wanted to live, I had to.\u201d\u201cIf it were me, I would have considered it rather suspicious. Rudger is even a member of a mysterious secret society?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s an executive called First Order.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026.First Order.\u201d\u201cDo you know anything?\u201dHans patted his chin and fell into anguish. It was his habit when he was trying to think of something.\u201cHmm\u2026I think I\u2019ve heard of it. No, I definitely remember. Have you ever heard of the recent uproar outside the Empire?\u201d\u201cNot yet.\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s completely recent, so you might not know. They say there\u2019s been a bunch of new guys lately that are pretty strong and crazy. They grade their members by Order.\u201d\u201cIt seems you are certain. What is the name of the organization?\u201d\u201cSome call it the Black Dawn.\u201dRudger pondered the name. Those with whom he was associated were certainly not normal.They planted that many people in Theon and assassinated members of the academy to hide their identity.\u201cDo you have any more information about them?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s so recent, I don\u2019t know the details. All I know is the name of the organization and its ranking. But now you\u2019re the First Order there?\u201d\u201cIt was a situation where I was wearing the mask of the guy who was originally the First Order.\u201d\u201cYou were lucky enough to get over it, but if you make a mistake, it won\u2019t be noticed, right?\u201d\u201cFor now.\u201d\u201cIf caught, you will be tortured in ways beyond your imagination.\u201dRudger grunted and rummaged through his pockets.\u201cSo I have to be prepared.\u201dRudger, who took out the medicine box, was about to eat the medicine inside, but realizing that he had eaten the last yesterday, extended his arm to Hans.\u201cMy bag.\u201d\u201cAh. I brought it here.\u201dHans immediately took the black suitcase hidden in the dark alley and handed it to Rudger.Rudger checked if his luggage was in good condition.\u201cYou open it?\u201d\u201cAm I crazy enough to open your luggage? Even if I wanted to open it in the first place, I couldn\u2019t.\u201dHans shrugged and denied Rudger\u2019s half-joking and half-serious words.Rudger opened his suitcase and looked at all of his personal belongings inside him. It was the same as when he put it in after organizing it before sending it off.Rudger took out two pills from the vial and popped them into his mouth.Hans looked at Rudger with a slightly pitiful gaze.\u201cBrother is suffering too. Now that I think about it, both brother and I are in a position where we have to live on drugs.\u201d\u201cUnlike drugs, it doesn\u2019t have any side effects, so it\u2019s a shame.\u201d\u201cSo, what are your plans for the future? You must have been restrained a lot because of your new identity.\u201d\u201cI will have to think about it later.\u201dOriginally, I had planned to use Theon power to suppress them or sabotage their plans, but that alone felt insufficient. It is too optimistic to hope that Theon will take care of the Black Dawn.It was necessary to move a little more actively and uproot them.\u201cHmm.\u201dRudger, who was about to lock the suitcase that had been opened, suddenly remembered something and asked Hans a question.\u201cHans. If you had already arrived here two days ago, why did you ask me to wait?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cRumors of a werewolf appearing spread all over Leathervelk, even in Theon, there was someone who saw you.\u201d\u201cYes? Older brother, what do you mean? I came to Leathervelk today.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dRudger asked the question without realizing it.It was the same with Hans.\u201cThere were rumors of a werewolf in Leathervelk? Before I came?\u201d\u201cI thought it was you.\u201d\u201cNo, I came today and you know my personality too. If I had come yesterday, I would have asked to meet you right away.\u201dThe two were speechless for a moment. So, who the hell is the werewolf in the rumor that is spreading now?\u201cOoooooooo!!!\u201dAt that moment, a cry was heard from beyond the misty darkness. There was no way the two men present could not hear the cry of this iconic beast.\u201cOlder brother.\u201d\u201cHuh.\u201dRudger leaned his back against the wall and looked around him. The sound of something moving fast along with the harsh breathing in the wind resounded in his ears a little.\u201cA real werewolf.\u201d\u201cYou mean it wasn\u2019t a rumor, it was true?\u201d\u201cMaybe.\u201dAt that moment, Rudger and Hans lifted their heads at the same time and looked up. Above the high roof, just then, a black shadow could be seen passing swiftly across.A black-haired beast shed blood-red traces of its eyes in the air. The foul odor peculiar to the beast filled their nostrils.\u201cCrazy, it was true\u2026\u2026 Brother, shall we leave for now? I don\u2019t think he recognized us right away.\u201d\u201cIt is only a matter of time.\u201dWerewolves were moving around quickly but it didn\u2019t go far. He was roaming around the factory area, wandering here and there.The bastard is now looking for his prey.\u2018I thought there was something on the werewolf\u2019s neck.\u2019When the werewolf appeared in an instant Rudger\u2019s eyes pierced the thick fog and scanned his body clearly. What caught his attention in particular was something similar to a dog tag on the guy\u2019s neck.\u2018Is belonging to someone he ate? No. Rather, it was more like a restraint, a leash.\u2019Maybe I saw it wrong. It was such a fleeting moment, so I might have misunderstood something. However, the fact that that werewolf had appeared in Leathervelk and the rumor had spread to Theon was caught up in the news.\u201cHans. I\u2019ll have to check it out.\u201d\u201cAre you sure? Are you going to catch that werewolf?\u201dRudger said so, picking up items from his suitcase one by one.He wore a leather belt around his waist and the multifunctional belt was full of empty holsters. Rudger put all the objects one by one into the empty slots on the belt: throwing weapon, melee weapon, vials of reagents and finally, two revolvers. Rudger quickly checked his guns, and then crossed them onto his back.Rudger finished by wearing gauntlets with mechanical devices on both forearms.Watching Rudger put on his gear one by one, Hans remembered the first time he had met him.\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve seen brother use it.\u201dAlthough all kinds of equipment were added, Rudger\u2019s appearance did not change. As such, the tools they are using now are very secretive.\u201cIt\u2019s the same equipment you used as a cryptid hunter? You used a pseudonym even then?\u201d\u201cI did.\u201d\u201cWhat was that name? Brother has to use a lot of pseudonyms and I can\u2019t remember it.\u201d\u201cVan Helsing.\u201dRudger, with all his gear, closed the suitcase and stood up. A shadow fell on his face, with his hat pressed down deeply.\u201cAbraham van Helsing.\u201dIt was the name Rudger once used as a hunter.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I finally made up for the missed releases.5 years ago Durman Kingdom, one of the small and medium-sized countries in the southern part of the continent, suffered from a headache due to the sudden infestation of cryptids.The nightmare continued for over a month, with wolves roaming in the middle of the city, bizarre beasts devouring people every night, and the smell of blood lingering for more than a month.Even if the soldiers and knights were put in, the cryptids flirted with the knights and avoided their encirclement. The situation escalated without a solution.Among them was one of the most infamous Cryptids. It was a monster who was active in J\u00e9vaudan, one of the major cities of the Durman Kingdom. This guy was a rare monster that ate three knights who could be called elite soldiers. It was J\u00e9vaudan nightmare, and the worst cryptid that reigned as the kingdom\u2019s terror.King Durman sent out an official announcement that he would give a huge reward to those who subdue the Cryptids and all kinds of freelance wizards, wandering knights, and famous mercenaries from the continent that had heard the rumors gathered in the Durman Kingdom and started a massive cryptid subjugation operation.Countless cryptids have died, and many hunters have died as well. People called the hunt at that time \u2018The Bloody Night\u2019 because the blood that was shed at that time stained the ground red.The Bloody Night was enough to establish the reputation of many people. At that time, there was one man who left the greatest achievement. \u00a0A person who defeated the most notorious monster in J\u00e9vaudan alone, and achieved the highest killing record for other Cryptids.He was neither a famous wizard nor a famous high-ranking knight, nor an elite mercenary, he was just a hunter.The hunter was adept at handling all kinds of tools and weapons, and for a year after Blood Night, he traveled all over Durman, killing more than three digits of Cryptids.The name of the hunter who is also famous for not revealing his identity was \u2018Abraham van Helsing\u2019.* * *Rudger, fully equipped, walked slowly to the side of the road.A damp night mist fell over the coat. Around the street lamp, a hazy scarlet light spreads dimly, as if it drank water from the mist. The stench of the beast, which secretly wafted through the smell of the mud, brushed the tip of his nose.\u2018It\u2019s a memory.\u2019\u201cBang!\u201dRudger immediately kicked a drum blown in the street with his foot.\u201cKudang!\u201dAs the drum collapsed, an intense noise echoed through the air. The werewolf, who was searching for his prey, heard the sound and turned his head. Those ferocious eyes found Rudger standing alone in the center of the boulevard.\u201cCrung.\u201dThe werewolf jumped from the roof of the building and got down in front of Rudger.\u2018Big.\u2019Rudger was able to take a closer look at the werewolf. His height was about 2.5m or more, his eyes were blood-drenched and his body was full of black hair.He had sharp claws on both hands, which were so eerie that the anticipation could be felt through the skin. But most of all, what caught the eye was the metal restraint ball on the werewolf\u2019s neck.\u2018I wasn\u2019t wrong.\u2019There is no way that a beast that has lost its sanity would wear something like that around its neck.\u2018Someone purposefully raised or created that werewolf.\u2019I didn\u2019t think it was impossible. This is a world where magic exists and science has developed in a strange direction, even Hans, whom he knew, has the constitution to change into a beast when bitten.Even if a secret organization made a werewolf as a test subject, there was nothing strange about it.\u2018The question is, why now?\u2019So far, there has been no news, but the incident happened not long after the opening of the Theon Academy? And in the year he took office? He couldn\u2019t help but be suspicious of such a situation.\u2018Well, if I catch him, I\u2019ll know.\u2019Rudger immediately took a stance.The werewolf contorted his face, presumably displeased when the man in front of him rather than running away was confronting him.\u201cOoooooooo!!!\u201dThe werewolf let out a roar and rushed towards Rudger. A werewolf, who sprinted through the ground on four legs, was faster than a car.Rudger watched the movement and slid behind him. The werewolf\u2019s claws cut through the air in the spot where Rudger had been a while ago.The werewolf swung its arms non-stop but Rudger continued to back step and concentrate on dodging.As soon as the tip of Rudger\u2019s brown shoe touched the ground, a strange wave spread out around him.With each miss of the werewolf\u2019s attacks, Rudger continued to pound the ground with his toes, spreading waves of his magic. In an extreme situation where even a single touch could shred his bones, Rudger never allowed the werewolf to hit him.\u201cWooooo!!!\u201dThe werewolf roared and spread his arms wide. He was going to attack him in that state and hold him so he couldn\u2019t escape.Rudger\u2019s mouth, which had been covered by the brim of his hat, smirked, the werewolf, who was about to run to Rudger, suddenly contorted his face and fell to his ground.\u201cUh, huh?\u201dHans, who was watching anxiously from afar, suddenly opened his eyes wide and puzzled to see the werewolf collapse.\u201cIt will make your head pound a bit.\u201dRudger gently trampled the werewolf\u2019s back.Werewolves are more like beasts than humans. And since it is part of the canine family, it is particularly sensitive to high frequencies that ordinary people cannot hear. Rudger prepared such a magic while dodging the werewolf attack.A magic that properly mixes sound waves and vibration magic is okay for humans, but if used on werewolves who hear sounds beyond a certain band. \u00a0Even now, the werewolf\u2019s ears are ringing in real time and the ultrasonic waves are still shaking the surrounding area.\u201cThere is no need to use expensive silver or the like.\u201dThere was no more suitable method than this, since the purpose was suppression and not killing in the first place.Now, let\u2019s check where the hell this guy was made.It was at that moment when Rudger pulled out a syringe and was about to draw his blood.\u201cBeep!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s here! Here comes the sound!\u201d\u201cEveryone, move quickly!\u201dWith the sound of a whistle, uniformed police officers rushed towards them from beyond the fog. The police, who had been patrolling because of rumors of a werewolf from two days ago, must have come to hear the commotion here.\u2018At this time.\u2019At that moment when Rudger had lost focus for a moment, the werewolf, who had been quiet, jumped to his feet.Rudger hurriedly stepped back and was wary of the werewolf\u2019s counterattack, but the werewolf had no interest in Rudger in the first place\u2026The guy shook his head a few times, then turned his back and ran away.\u2018This.\u2019Rudger sighed, dispelling the high-frequency magic that had spread around him.As police officers carrying his magical powers appeared one by one, Rudger decided that he had to step down.\u201cThere! There is someone over there!\u201d\u201cArrest all suspicious people!\u201dAt some point, the werewolf was climbing up the walls of the factory to the roof, Rudger ran after him.As Rudger was going through the dark alleyway, he felt the werewolf\u2019s presence receding and stretched his arms out into the air. The mechanical mainspring under the gauntlet\u2019s wrist turned quickly, and then a wire hook shot towards the roof.The moment the hook was fixed to the roof railing, the gears rotated and the wire was wound at high speed Rudger used the recoil to fly to the roof. Commonly called wire launcher, it was the favorite object of Rudger when he was active as a hunter.Rudger landed on the roof.After pulling the wire to retrieve the hook, Rudger found the back of a werewolf running away in the distance.\u2018I won\u2019t let you escape.\u2019Rudger put magical powers around his legs. In this world, magicians also use magic to strengthen their bodies in case of unforeseen circumstances.Rudger kicked off the roof with enhanced leg strength and followed the werewolf. The night scenery of the factory area passes quickly and the figure of the werewolf running away in the distance could be seen gradually getting closer.While running, the werewolf looked back at something strange and found Rudger chasing him, spurring the speed of his escape.The werewolf, who had been skipping non-stop between the roofs of the factory, jumped down onto the large railroad tracks below. At that moment, a freight train loaded with magic stones was passing underneath.The werewolf landed rough on the cargo hold. Rudger didn\u2019t want to let him escape so he jumped on top of the cargo hold as well.Rudger lightly patted his shoulder with his hand, staring at the werewolf. Realizing that he could no longer run, the werewolf got up and looked back at Rudger.On top of the train, Rudger and the werewolf faced each other about three meters apart. The hem of Rudger\u2019s coat was blown away by the strong wind as the train ran.\u201cAt first, I was just trying to capture you but now I changed my mind.\u201dMy vision was blurred for a moment as the night wind brushed my cheeks and the steam from the train\u2019s head. Through the gap, the werewolf rushed towards me.A fairly sharp movement that takes advantage of the blind spot and pierces the opponent\u2019s loophole, however the werewolf rushing towards Rudger stopped at the strange noise ringing in his ears. It was a kind of instinctive intuition he had as a beast.That judgment was correct as something sharp swept past the werewolf\u2019s neck at both ends.\u201cIt feels good.\u201dIt passed through the skin of the werewolf\u2019s neck, spinning and returning to Rudger. It was a boomerang with sharp blades spread out like a fan and if he had been a little late, the sharp circular saw blade would have cut the werewolf\u2019s throat.The werewolf quickly regenerated the wounds running down his neck. He was furious at the fact that he had been hurt, and veins sprouted from his body.\u201cI was going to finish it in one shot.\u201dRudger put his regrets behind him and took out a wand hung from his waist and held it. This time it was Rudger\u2019s turn to run.He holds a staff in his right hand and uses his left hand to gather magical energy to use [Shining Stone] and fires it straight like a bullet at one of the werewolf\u2019s eyes.\u201cSwish!\u201dThe werewolf bowed his head straight away and avoided the [Shining Stone]. At that moment, Rudger snapped the index finger of his left hand and the [Shining Stone] that passed by the werewolf turned in mid-air and hit the werewolf in the back of the head.As the werewolf panicked by the intense pain he felt in the back of his head, Rudger ran up to the werewolf and swung his staff towards his face with all his might.The werewolf tried to block it with both arms but a saw-bladed boomerang flew and pierced the werewolf\u2019s hands. The boomerang was thrown in advance by Rudger.The werewolf caught the staff with his mouth and his eyes curved like a crescent moon. The moment the wound on his arm would be regenerated, he was thinking of tearing the cheeky human right in front of him but as if to ridicule the werewolf\u2019s inner heart, Rudger made his next move.The handle of the staff was pulled and a pure white sword came out of it. The sight was so unexpected that the werewolf did not even think to drop the empty shell of the staff he had bitten in his mouth.Rudger\u2019s body rotated once in place and a white line was drawn in the air. The light that was so thin but clear cut the werewolf\u2019s neck softly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Seriously, I almost got caught.\u2019Hans, carrying Rudger\u2019s suitcase, walked slowly down the dark alleyway, avoiding the eyes of the police who suddenly came to the scene.He arrived here today, but didn\u2019t get lost because Hans already had a map of Leathervelk in his head.\u2018You went to catch a werewolf. When are you going to come back?\u2019As he was thinking, something fell in the air in front of Hans. It was the head of a giant wolf that rolled to his feet.Hans shrugged his shoulders, pinched his lips, and desperately resisted the screams that were about to escape.\u201cAre you surprised?\u201dIn the darkness of the alley opposite, Rudger slowly walked out. Shoes and leather pants together with white shirt and a brown leather vest over it along with the long drab coat on the outside, and the hat on his head.\u201cDamn it, older brother when you show up, talk to me! I almost dropped your bag!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s good you didn\u2019t.\u201d\u201cIs this the werewolf? Well, it\u2019s not that I\u2019m ignoring my brother\u2019s skills, but I didn\u2019t think you could catch this terrifying guy in that situation.\u201dAfter checking the dead werewolf\u2019s head with his tongue sticking out, Hans shook his body and handed the black suitcase to Rudger. Receiving it, Rudger turned his back and walked forward, Hans followed him.\u201cCan I leave that as it is?\u201d\u201cI do not need it anymore.\u201d\u201cNo, then why did you bring it?\u201d\u201cYou were surprised.\u201d\u201c\u2026Did you still have in your heart what you were trying to scare your brother in the alleyway?\u201dWhen Rudger was silent, Hans sighed and raised his hands.\u201cI lost, so let\u2019s not do that again in the future.\u201d\u201cLook at what you\u2019re doing.\u201dThe two of them got out of the alleyway and came out onto a busy road where passersby could be seen to some extent.\u201cSo what the hell was that werewolf just now? Was it really cryptid?\u201d\u201cNo. It was an artificially created test subject.\u201d\u201cExperiment? I\u2019ll have to take care of myself because the people who made it are here.\u201d\u201cAnyway, I have something to tell you about that.\u201d\u201cWhat to say? I am suddenly very anxious right now, can I not listen?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cOh, okay! Say something.\u201d\u201cI have to move ahead with what I originally planned.\u201d\u201cOriginal plan? No way\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI think this is better than the capital.\u201dRudger tossed two pockets at Hans.Hans took them and checked the contents. One was full of gold coins and the other was his beast neutralizer.\u201cOlder brother. This\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cShouldn\u2019t we settle down too?\u201d\u201cIn this place where the secret society, Black Dawn, might exist? Even in a big city, there are gangs in the back alleys.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll try.\u201d\u201cYou have plenty of money, so try hard.\u201d\u201cOlder brother?\u201d\u201cFirst of all, I am a teacher, so I can\u2019t move freely. The president is still suspicious of me.\u201d\u201cSo now you want me to do this all by myself?\u201dRudger shook his head.\u201cFirst of all, it is important to gather important information. Who are the gangsters and the mafia in this city, and how the backstreet world flows. And how can I get a seat there? Find out and tell me.\u201dHans, who understood what Rudger was saying, swallowed his saliva, then smiled and nodded his head.\u201cThat is my specialty.\u201d* * *Returning to the dormitory of the academy, I unpacked all my belongings. I\u2019ve left Hans alone to gather information for now, but he\u2019ll be fine, his ability to gather information is unmatched.\u2018I will have to develop my own power in case of an unexpected situation.\u2019I can\u2019t move right away, so I decided to just prepare.The president is still suspicious of me, and I\u2019m not sure exactly what the secret society, the Black Dawn, is up to, so moving prematurely is counterproductive.Having simply finished organizing my belongings, I sat down on the comfy sofa and replayed the events of the day.\u2018That werewolf wasn\u2019t a pure Cryptid, but someone deliberately created it.\u2019The existence of werewolves is no surprise. Monsters existed in this world as well, and they were driven out beyond the shadow barrier, which is now outside the continent, but their traces still remain.Cryptids are a prime example of this. These beings, subspecies of monsters, are now more like urban legends or ghost stories from non-ideal occurrences of magical powers rather than real monsters.The werewolf I caught this time is also a type of cryptid, but to be precise, it\u2019s just a fake.\u2018Experiments and witchcraft to create werewolves have existed since ancient times.\u2019There is a cursed potion made by adding various medicinal substances to the water with wolf paws and mixing it with wolf\u2019s fur, a transformation potion that allows ordinary humans to turn into a beast by drinking it. Of course, this is black magic.Black magic is banned at the national level, so the death penalty is unconditional regardless of the reason for being caught.\u2018But how dare you make such a werewolf openly. Seeing that there is even a mark as a test subject, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s at the level that some power has touched it.\u2019Judging from the leash, did they capture a wild wolf and mixed it with human factors? The marks of restraints, as well as the traces of various experiments engraved on the corpse of werewolf were clearly the result of science.Potions that corrupt humans and transform them into beasts are the exclusive domain of warlocks that have almost disappeared. That\u2019s where science intervened.\u2018Someone deliberately insisted on it.\u2019If so, who is it? In order to make a subject of that level secret, it requires a fairly large laboratory of the public eye. Space, confidentiality, and even experimentation, considering all that, means that a big hand who can provide a huge financial line is involved in this work.Aristocrats, or millionaires.\u2018There are people in the Empire who are rich enough to be suspicious.\u2019I shook my head. I don\u2019t know who might be suspicious, but since I\u2019ve killed the werewolf and collected my serum, I won\u2019t need to worry about this anymore.It\u2019s a long weekend, and I don\u2019t want to get involved in troublesome work anymore. Tomorrow is Sunday, so let\u2019s take a good rest.\u2018More than that, I have to prepare for the next class.\u2019There are so many things to deal with, it hurts my head.* * *Monday morning marks the beginning of a new week after a peaceful Sunday.After eating a light toast and coffee for my breakfast I went to work in my private office in the main building. Class is tomorrow, but first of all, as a new teacher, I have to show myself to go to work because that\u2019s social life.After sitting at the desk in the office, I opened the newspaper I brought from the dormitory.\u2018\u2026\u2026What the hell is this?\u2019On the front page of the newspaper that came out this morning, there was a single headline engraved.[An unidentified killer appeared in Leathervelk!]\u2013 Last Sunday, there were 5 additional deaths in Leathervelk. This brings the total number of deaths to over 10. The identity of the perpetrator has not yet been revealed, but eyewitnesses say it is a terrifying beast with black hair. Police have announced that he is just a maniac murderer and will be arrested soon, but citizens are still terrified.\u2018What is this?\u2019I read and read the article on the front page of the newspaper. This was, after all, the werewolf incident that I killed Saturday but the newspaper said the deaths were on Sunday.\u2018At that time, I definitely stopped his breath. And yet, when there are new victims, does that mean that there wasn\u2019t only one?\u2019There was a moment when I felt that things were going to be strange.\u201cBeep! Beep!\u201d The translucent crystal ball placed on the work table began to flash with a strange sound. I know what this is.\u2018The president calls.\u2019Precisely, it\u2019s a kind of signal for teachers to gather.\u2018I have to go.\u2019I got up and put my coat on the hanger. Suddenly, I remembered what Ms. Selina had said during the meal last Friday.She said there were testimonies from students that they had seen a werewolf even inside the academy.\u2018Victims in Leathervelk, even eyewitnesses within the academy.\u2019Even if I excluded the one I hunted, the number of remaining werewolves is at least two, maybe more than that.Trying to put away such anxious thoughts, I headed to the conference hall where the teachers were gathered.The conference hall, located on the upper floors of the main building, was full of teachers. Each of them is clearly competent in the field they teach.As I entered, people\u2019s eyes turned to me. Most of what was in their eyes was curiosity, but I know that it wasn\u2019t for me, it was for the source code I invented.\u2018Mr. Rudger here!\u2019In that corner, I could see her familiar pink hair swaying. Seeing Ms. Selina waving her hand towards this side, I headed towards her.\u2018Is that person Rudger Chelici?\u2019\u2018I heard he invented some pretty cool magic, is that true?\u2019Among some teachers, there were quite a few people who looked at me hostilely, as I was a fallen aristocrat. Their hostility and jealous gazes were quite stinging, but I simply ignored them.As I sat in an empty seat next to Selina, she greeted me.\u201cDid you have a good weekend?\u201d\u201cI had a good rest. Did Selina have a good rest, too?\u201d\u201cYes. I also took a really long break. Did you hear the news? Last night, two first-year students were attacked by a gangster and were seriously injured.\u201dAfter listening to Selina\u2019s explanation, the situation was like this.Last night two first-year students returning to the dormitory after going outside the academy were attacked inside Theon. It was not life-threatening, but it was a serious injury, and it was a great shock that this happened even inside the academy.One of the students who just woke up this morning said that a terrible beast attacked him.\u201cThe werewolf rumors that have been around since last week must have been true. It is said that victims have also appeared in the nearby Leathervelk.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dIt is difficult to dismiss it as simply seeing something in vain, and it is said that the wounds engraved on the victim\u2019s body are like being scratched by an animal.This is probably the reason why they gathered all the teachers this time. First of all, the contract said that the teachers of Theon had to work with all their might in case of emergency.That would mean that it would be difficult to calm the situation with only internal guards or users.\u2018If the opponent is a werewolf, it would be much better to send elite teachers than to pour in mediocre manpower.\u2019Being a teacher at Theon doesn\u2019t mean just teaching students in a normal way.\u201cThe president is coming.\u201dWhen the woman, who looked to be in her mid-fifties with wrinkles on her face, spoke, all the teachers they were conversing with became silent.I looked to see who it was, and Selina explained it to me.\u201cMiss Marie Ross. She\u2019s been in office for over 20 years. Her field of teaching is pharmacy.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dShe held her position for more than 20 years? That is to say, she has great powers. As she stepped forward to sort out the situation, the other teachers kept their mouths shut.\u201cThe president is coming.\u201dThen the door opened and the president entered. She always looked beautiful. In addition to the alluring golden eyes, the two-tone hair of white and light pink naturally catches people\u2019s eyes.\u201cGood morning everyone. The reason I called this urgently today is because I have something to announce to you all.\u201dThe president went straight to the main topic without wasting time.The mention of the rumored werewolf caused a stir among teachers as well.\u201cIt cannot be. President, have you misunderstood? Cryptids in Theon.\u201dIt was a greedy middle-aged man who appeared to be in his mid-50s who stood up blatantly. He had his oily, turbid blonde hair neatly parted 2 to 8 and grew up to his mustache. It\u2019s like seeing an old-timer that exists in every school. However, when he appeared, the atmosphere of the meeting room changed strangely.\u201cAnything you want to say? Mr. Hugo Burtag?\u201d\u201cThis is Theon, a place that is protected by the Exilion Empire. I think the students made some kind of mistake by believing the ghost stories that were floating around.\u201d\u201cMr. Hugo, didn\u2019t I just tell you there were two victims?\u201d\u201cI know, the victims were both children of noble families so I don\u2019t think there is a werewolf.\u201dHugo Burtag took a glance at the crowd.\u201cI think the culprit is a student of Theon, this is commonplace.\u201d\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d\u201cOtherwise, of the many students, only the children of the aristocracy have been injured. Werewolves attacked this Theon? Rather, it is far more credible that some students deliberately pretended to be werewolves and started the case.\u201dThose words certainly had some plausible persuasive power, but I had to feel something instinctively offensive by Hugo\u2019s words. He\u2019s just trying to take the president\u2019s words and pass the fault of this case on to certain students.I looked at the atmosphere and nodded inwardly.\u2018Ah. I guess I get it.\u2019As long as Theon is an organization, the existence of factions within it is inevitable. Students are divided into commoners and nobles, but what about the teachers?The reality is that teachers, too, have a subtle current between teachers from commoners and teachers from aristocrats.Chris Benimore, a new teacher, refused to eat with me since I was a fallen aristocrat.\u2018I thought the Black Dawn would be at a disadvantage, but I guess that\u2019s not the case.\u2019Rather, I would not have known if Hugo was the only one who thought like that but, there were quite a few people who subtly agree with his opinion.The aristocratic teachers were united and a faction was formed. And that faction didn\u2019t seem to get along very well with the president\u2019s faction. Even if we all work together, it\u2019s not enough for such a conflict to exist.As I was wondering about Theon actual situation, a tiny bug crawled up the wall and climbed onto my shoulder. The moment I threw it down with my hand, I couldn\u2019t help but stop. It wasn\u2019t a worm but a small, thin piece of paper in the shape of a worm.Fortunately, the others haven\u2019t noticed yet. I grabbed it naturally and checked the contents so that others wouldn\u2019t find out.It was fortunate that most of the teachers\u2019 attention was focused on the nerve war between the president and Hugo.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAfter checking the contents, I pressed my finger on my slightly stinging forehead.[Three test subjects escaped. Immediate capture. If not, remove them.\u201d]I will quickly find out who sent this message and who was behind the creation of this werewolf. But the most important thing was the last sentence.\u201cThere is a risk that the person\u2019s identity will be exposed if the subject material is stolen.\u201dWhy are you giving me such an ordeal?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, the escape of a werewolf was probably unexpected, given that I was given the order to remove him if capture was not possible.\u2018The problem is that if caught, Black Dawn will be severely damaged.\u2019If they take a hit, that\u2019s good news for me but the problem is that my identity might be revealed. In other words, Rudger Chelici has something to do with the creation of the werewolf.You need to catch all 3 of them. No, now there are two. In other words, I have to find and catch the werewolves before Theon, and then kill them.\u2018By the way, the werewolves had a mark.\u2019Perhaps the mark itself has something to do with the guys who did the experiment. The problem is that Rudger Chelici has something to do with it in some way.To be honest, if this had nothing to do with me, I would have just left it to Theon. But if I\u2019m involved here, it\u2019s a different story. If caught, I die.\u201cMr. Rudger, is something wrong?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201dI shook my head in response to Selina\u2019s question.First of all, it was confirmed that there were three werewolves. I got one, so there are two left, one in Theon and one in Leathervelk.\u2018I have to hunt them down.\u2019Meanwhile, the war between the president and Hugo was almost over.\u201cWell, it\u2019s up to you to act like that, Mr. Hugo. However, I hope that the given task will be handled seriously.\u201d\u201cSo you are going to strengthen patrols?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not just that. We as teachers cannot sit still until the number of victims increases, and above all, late at night when all the students go home.\u201dAt that, Hugo had an annoyed expression on his face. Rather than worrying about the student, he seemed dissatisfied with the fact that a person his size had to go around patrolling.However, the incident has already occurred, and the seriousness of the situation is also recognized by other teachers. Even Hugo was in a position that he could not openly oppose.\u201cThe teachers should warn their students not to run around late at night. It doesn\u2019t matter if you give a penalty point for any violation of it. This is an instruction given by myself as the president. Do you understand?\u201d\u201cAll right.\u201dAfter the meeting, the teachers got up from their seats and dispersed one by one.I also got up and tried to go back to the office, but some people blocked my way first.\u201cAre you Mr. Rudger Chelici? Nice to meet you. My name is Daniel Masrak, the astrologer.\u201dIt was obvious why they approached me, the greed in their eyes said it.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m busy, so I\u2019ll go first.\u201dI immediately dismissed their interest and left the meeting room.* * *Instead of heading straight to my office, I moved to a less crowded warehouse.\u201cCome out.\u201dIf it was the guy who sent me a message in the meeting room, he would have been waiting for me to come out. It is not possible to convey all of your wishes in a few lines of messages, so there must be something he wants to say.As I was afraid to speak, I could feel a shriek from behind the pillar, and then someone stuck his head out.\u201cI\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cTell me.\u201dIt was the Dark Dawn\u2019s member who tried to approach me after I joined Theon.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cThat, so\u2026\u2026\u201dShe was visibly embarrassed, not knowing that she would ever see me again. Then she revealed herself completely behind her pole, and I was a little surprised to see her in Theon\u2019s uniform.Maybe she was a student here. The reason most Black Dawn members are hiding as users is that the student\u2019s identity cannot be so easily manipulated.In order to enter this place, you need to have the talent or skills to pass the entrance exam, if you don\u2019t know anything else.At the time of our first meeting, she wasn\u2019t even wearing a uniform, so I didn\u2019t know she was a new student.\u201cJust move on. Follow me.\u201d\u201cAh yes.\u201dI took the lead, and she followed.Something came to my mind, so I looked back at her and asked.\u201cDo you like coffee?\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d* * *We sat facing each other in a quiet cafe. She had been shrugging her shoulders for a while, not knowing what to do.I glanced at her. White skin and dense facial features, with voluminous brown short hair and a slightly delicate physique. I can\u2019t see her ears and her bangs are long, that are about to cover her eyes. She literally looks like a little squirrel.I shouldn\u2019t have threatened her so much the last time we met. I took a sip of the hot coffee placed in front of me and placed it aloud on the table.Just right.\u201cHey!\u201dShe shrugged her shoulders as the coffee cup and table made a sound.\u201cName.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t ask you twice. Name.\u201d\u201cSedina Rosen.\u201d\u201cIs that your real name?\u201d\u201cYes Yes.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that a pseudonym?\u201dThis is surprising, having a surname in this world means that you are not a commoner, but a higher class. Noble, priest or the wealthy.Why would someone who grew up in such an environment where there was nothing lacking, had enough talent to enter Theon, but was only the lowest third order, join a secret society?\u2018No. On the contrary, the more you come from a family like this, the less you may be treated.\u2019The strangest part is that there are only third-orders with this kind of talent. Well, I\u2019ll ask about that later.I flicked my fingers lightly.\u201cTell me exactly what happened without missing anything.\u201d\u201cUh, I\u2026\u2026around\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI used voice-blocking magic. Even if we scream here, the conversation won\u2019t leak out.\u201d\u201cVoice blocking magic? W, as expected, First Order-nim.\u201dIt was really strange that she kept calling me First Order. No, to be honest, it\u2019s uncomfortable.\u201cFirst of all, you need to change the name. Don\u2019t call me First Order from now on.\u201d\u201cYes?!\u201dAt my words, Sedina opened her eyes wide.\u201cI am now a teacher at Theon and you are a student.\u201d\u201cYes Yes.\u201d\u201cFrom now on, call me Mr. Rudger.\u201d\u201cHow can I be disrespectful\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cIt is an order.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dWhen I said strongly that it was a command, she nodded, saying she understood. However, as opposed to being mournful, her lips kept trying to rise because she was happy that she was allowed to call me by my name.\u201cSo what is the situation?\u201d\u201cOh, yes. I\u2019ll explain everything. The recent werewolf incident happened in our Black Dawn, or to be more precise, in an affiliated organization that has teamed up with us.I was momentarily taken aback by the sudden change in her tone of voice, but I naturally nodded.\u201cKeep talking. Every detail, without omission.\u201d\u201cFactions exist within the Black Dawn, as the First\u2026Mr. Rudger, knows. In particular, Victor Dreadful, another First Order-nim, was the one who worked hard on this project.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dActually I don\u2019t know anything. I pretended to know everything, and responded to her words.Victor Dreadful, I\u2019ll have to remember this name.\u201cThe Shamsus School, which was created by gathering scientists expelled from the Society for conducting unethical experiments with the warlocks of the back alleys, engaged in Cryptid Experiments as they did before.\u201d\u201cExactly what kind of experiment did they focus on?\u201d\u201cOnly a few people know that, so I\u2019m up to that point\u2026\u2026 Oh, and by the way, when Victor asked Mr. Rudger to help him, he lent him his name.\u201d\u201cHe only lent me his name. I never knew it would come this far.\u201dFrom the reaction, it seems that Rudger was quite close with the person named Victor, but it has now become poison.The Shamsus School must have studied the cryptids, and the subject eventually escaped, that\u2019s what\u2019s happening now.\u201cAt first, it was their fault, so we had to let them take care of it, but in the end, one of the escaped subjects hid in Theon through the sewer pipe.\u201d\u201cSo there must have been a victim the day before.\u201d\u201cYes. This was something that our Black Dawn never expected.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cOh, sorry. I talk too much\u2026\u2026When I get excited, I often make this mistake. Um, like me\u2026\u2026\u201dSedina Rosen\u2019s attitude changed noticeably and passively, perhaps because she thought my stare had a different meaning.I immediately shook my head.\u201cNo. Unlike the stuttering when we first met, you were surprisingly good at explaining, so I just admired it.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cYou are surprisingly good at talking. Could you explain more? It was good to hear.\u201d\u201cI, really?! Yes! All right!\u201dSedina continues the explanation as soon as I throw a few words of praise.I sighed in relief, if she stops explaining, I can\u2019t figure out any more information. Now I had to pull out everything I could pull out while I was in Sedina\u2019s respect by putting on a shell called First Order.First of all, Sedina Rosen is the lowest third order member in the Black Dawn, but her own abilities are quite outstanding. From gathering information to continuing the explanation, the conversation itself is quite smooth, without interruption.The note I received must\u2019ve been sent through one of her secret spells. But why is someone with this level of ability only a 3rd order?First of all, the fact that Sedina has a surname means that her family is a pretty good place.\u2018Reaction that causes rejection when she says her last name in her self-introduction. That is, she doesn\u2019t like her family. Rejection? Resistance? Something much bigger than that?\u2019The problem is that she must have joined the Black Dawn of her own will, but it didn\u2019t seem that way to the other members.She may be a spy, or she herself is a character with a screw loose somewhere, so she probably didn\u2019t get along well with the other members.\u2018Secretly sending a magic note to me, gathering information quickly and even entering Theon. Her position is low compared to her superior ability. The organization wants to throw her away after using her?\u2019Sedina herself must be passionate enough to swear allegiance to the Black Dawn by devoting her body and soul, but the organization itself doesn\u2019t like her. She tries hard but her situation doesn\u2019t improve and she gets bogged down further.\u2018From the standpoint of the Black Dawn, I\u2019d like to have it for now, but I\u2019m hesitant about how to use it.\u2019The First Order that she\u2019s under doesn\u2019t care about her. Maybe she\u2019s just trying to use it like a consumable item for a mission that requires her life to be thrown away. Her future was already decided.\u2018Will a Second Order take care of her?\u2019I just saw a crack in Theon for the first time at the previous meeting and now I could also see one in Black Dawn. There is no perfect group in the world.\u2018Maybe this\u2026\u2026\u2019Knowing that Theon and Black Dawn both have significant problems felt like a way out for me. Hopefully I can get something through Sedina.\u201cOnce you capture the specimen, it is better not to leave any evidence behind. Capture is a priority, but in the current situation there is no other choice but to get rid of them as quickly as possible. Since there are three, we can do our best\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cNo. Two.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dI took out the werewolf restraint orb from my inner pocket and showed it to Sedina.\u201cThis is\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cOne guy was already caught.\u201d\u201cDamn, when\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cTwo days ago in Leathervelk.\u201dPerhaps she didn\u2019t know that I had already caught one of the three, so her face went hazy.\u201cFirst Order-nim.\u201dShe has a very respectful expression.\u201cAnyway, are there two left now?\u201d\u201cYes, yes.\u201d\u201cYou said that one hid here through a sewer pipe, so we will have to widen the search around that area. Theon doesn\u2019t know this information yet, right?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201d\u201cThen I must move right away.\u201dI said that and got up from my seat. Sedina looked up at me, wondering if I was already finished, but I thought she was rude, so she immediately bowed her head.I unblocked the sound barrier and said,\u201cSedina Rosen. See you next time if you have a chance.\u201d\u201cYes Yes! That\u2026\u2026Rudger, sir.\u201dSedina blushes shyly while she speaks. Looking at it this way, she just seems like a young girl of my age. How did such a child somehow end up joining the monstrous organization called Black Dawn?\u201cThen.\u201dI left the cafe after emptying my coffee.* * *Flora Lumos was going to study at the library leisurely because it was a public class today.In her usual way she would have pranked someone today but she recently found herself unable to sit still because a teacher ignited the magical will within her.As she thought so, she was walking through an outdoor corridor lined with arched columns.\u2018Huh?\u2019Through the glass window on the second floor of a cafe not far away, she saw a familiar face, Rudger Chelici. But there was something strange about the man\u2019s attitude.\u2018Who\u2019s the girl on the other side?\u2019Now, Rudger, who exudes a softer feeling than usual, was talking to a girl face to face.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 25": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Academy\u2019s Undercover ProfessorCH 25Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayC25: Black Dawn (2)Chapter 3/3 for the week.\u2018What are you two talking about now?\u2019Rudger was having an in-depth conversation with a girl. At least that\u2019s how it seemed. However, no matter how much I paid attention to my ears, I could not hear the conversation between the two of them from far away.If that had been the case, Flora would have just thought that Rudger was giving students career advice or talking about lectures but she saw that a strange magical field was spread around Rudger and the girl.\u2018What is that? Magic? Does the field block out the sound?\u2019Flora Lumos has a secret she hasn\u2019t told anyone.The reason why she was able to keep the title of genius even in Theon was because she has a peculiar constitution called <Synesthesia of Mana>. She could feel the \u2018color\u2019 and \u2018smell\u2019 of mana.Most people perceive mana or magical power itself only as a visual thing but Flora also senses color. She sees a well-crafted magic recipe as a picture, and also feels the scent of delicious cuisine.Born in an aristocratic family, she is very sensitive to such things, so she can easily find the difference in her manners even a little more than anyone else. It doesn\u2019t harmonize with other colors in particular, and it splashes out, or the stench mixes between the good smells.Naturally, when she feels the right magic, she sees it with a completely different sense from other people. Like the colors floating around Rudger now. The magic that spread almost around Rudger was perfect.It was far away, so I couldn\u2019t feel the smell, but the color of magical power was very clear through the glass window of the terrace.\u2018What the hell are you talking about?\u2019I was curious. If he was an ordinary teacher I would\u2019ve ignored it but I couldn\u2019t help but wonder since it was Rudger.\u2018Shall I just pretend it\u2019s a coincidence and go?\u2019After thinking that far, Flora shook her head. Isn\u2019t that too deceitful?\u2018Absolutely not!\u2019Rudger was a wall she had to overcome.On the first day, how much insult she felt in front of everyone. Of course, there was no dispute about her defeat. The source code that Rudger showed off was so strong that she had no choice but to lose.\u2018Still\u2026\u2026It was something strange.\u2019When Rudger performed the source code magic, Flora\u2019s first sensation was visual pleasure and sweet fragrance that cannot be expressed in words. In particular, the source code magic unfolded by Rudger was like looking at a beautiful painting in which countless silver and gray metals were densely and firmly woven together.Because of her unique constitution and talent, Flora felt boredom towards magic but source code shown by Rudger, rekindled her passion.\u2018One swipe\u2026\u2026\u2019The moment Flora is about to move.\u201cFlora? What are you doing here?\u201d\u201cDamn?!\u201dAt the sudden voice coming from behind, Flora stood up and was surprised. Looking back she saw that her best friend Cheryl was looking at her with a questioning gaze.\u201cCheryl, what\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? It was Flora who told me to study together in the reading room.\u201d\u201cAh, ah right. I did?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Are you really okay?\u201dCheryl gave her a subtly worried look. It\u2019s already well known that Flora was mistreated on the first day of class. Because of this, some students, who had always regarded her with respect, ridiculed her.\u201cYes? Just~. Nothing.\u201d\u201cWhat is there? I think you were watching.\u201d\u201cNo no. It\u2019s not like that. Come on, let\u2019s go study.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201dFlora pushed Cheryl and headed for the library. Still, her gaze did not fall from the second floor of the cafe far away.* * *Having obtained information from Sedina Rosen, I left her a message that I would see her next time, and went back to my private office right away.I hung my coat on the hanger and sat on the comfy sofa, stroking my chin.\u2018Let\u2019s organize everything first.\u2019There is a place called the Shamsus School, where warlocks and mad scientists join hands. It was them that made the werewolf as a test subject.Although it is a separate group from the Black Dawn, they are still allies for now. One of the Black Dawn executives, Victor Dreadful, joined hands with the Shamsus School.From Sedina\u2019s explanation, I guess she was in charge of research within the Black Dawn.\u2018The problem lies with the Shamsus School.\u2019The three werewolf subjects that the Shamsus School had secretly experimented with had escaped. I don\u2019t know the exact location of the lab, but if I look at the riots in Leathervelk, it\u2019s probably in the vicinity.If the werewolf had been captured as soon as possible at the beginning of the incident, rumors would not have spread in the city. There were even deaths, so it is impossible to simply cover it up.One of the werewolves even sneaked into Theon and put two students in the hospital. It is fortunate that there are no fatalities in Theon, but the problem is that the situation is out of control.\u2018It\u2019s their fault, so it\u2019s right to tell them to take care of it, but the problem is that the Black Dawn gave some support for this Shamsus school experiment.\u2019My Rudger Chelici identity is also involved in this and if other members are captured I might be caught as well. I want to survive, I have to catch the werewolves before everyone else.\u2018For now, my priority should be to get rid of the werewolf hiding inside the academy.\u2019At the same time, security patrols have been strengthened. Aside from the existence of the werewolves, it is certain that there are monsters wandering inside Theon, so the teachers will patrol until late at night.No one would be surprised if I got rid of the werewolf here.\u2018I thought I quit my job as a hunter a long time ago.\u2019Five years ago, I ended my blood hunt and practically retired because I was too famous. Of course, I used the pseudonym of Abraham van Helsing in order not to reveal my true identity. However, after hunting the J\u00e9vaudan cryptid, I became so famous that more and more people tried to approach me so I retired and changed my identity.\u2018I changed my identity so many times.\u2019The last identity I used was Gerard, a wealthy middle-aged man with a lot of money. It\u2019s a fake life, not the real thing, but I didn\u2019t feel that I was particularly dissatisfied or frustrated. Was it because I was reborn in this world after I died once?Little by little, my perception of life and death became different from that of others.\u2018Even so, I don\u2019t want to die again.\u2019I\u2019ve already died once, so I don\u2019t want to die again. If possible, I wanted to live longer and more comfortably. But there were things that had to be done in order to do that.Heading to the imperial capital this time was part of that but the train attack changed my life forever.\u2018For now, let\u2019s focus on catching werewolves.\u2019This must be dealt with first before anyone else finds them. I shook my head as to how to catch the werewolf.* * *Rumors of a werewolf among Theon students were like a hot potato.Even the students, who had dismissed it as just a rumor, accepted the existence of a werewolf when they heard that there were two injured students this time.Naturally, the teachers had to suppress the curiosity and vigor of such students as much as possible.\u201cStudy! What nonsense are you believing? You\u2019ll have an exam today, so focus on it!\u201d\u201cEveryone, this is patrol reinforcement week, so please go home as soon as the sun goes down. If you get caught walking around, you will be penalized.\u201dSome students, who were timid at the teacher\u2019s warning, thought that they should return to the dormitory immediately after class, but there were not a few students who did not.Naturally, the stronger the child, the more they want to do it when told not to do it.\u201cAren\u2019t you curious about the werewolf?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s do this.\u201d\u201cWhat? Haven\u2019t you heard that there is a penalty point for staying late outside?\u201d\u201cThink about it. If we catch a werewolf, wouldn\u2019t the school reward us for doing well?\u201d\u201cThen what if we get caught by the teachers before we find the werewolf?\u201d\u201cWe can\u2019t get caught!\u201dThere was even an official notice in the newspaper stating that if a werewolf was caught in Leathervelk and a reward was published.First-year students, who have not yet tasted the bitterness of the reality that they are not that great in Theon, dreamed of becoming a hero by hunting the werewolf.\u201cAidan, what do you think?\u201dLeo asked, looking intently at the students who were clamoring for what to do with the bounty they would receive after catching the werewolf. At the same time, Aidan, who had finished writing a formula on the magic board, asked when he heard the voice calling him.\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cWeren\u2019t you listening?\u201d\u201cWhy? What did you ask?\u201d\u201cWhat do you think about the werewolf incident?\u201d\u201cOh, that?\u201dAidan laughed softly.The teachers told us to be careful, so I guess we should just do it. If we get caught, we\u2019ll receive a penalty point.\u201d\u201cI thought you would say that.\u201d\u201cLeo, are you?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not the type to particularly like to go out. If there are going to be victims in the first place, this is something teachers should take care of.\u201dA female student approached the two of them while they were having a conversation. Her red hair was tied in large ponytails and her sharply raised eyebrows were of a very attractive beauty. She stood in front of Aidan\u2019s desk and pounded her table with her palm.Leo had a reaction like, \u2018That woman is here again\u2019, but Aidan was different. He smiled brightly and greeted her girl, who was staring at them.\u201cHi Tracey. Good morning.\u201d\u201cGood morning?\u201dThe girl who received the greeting, Tracey Friad, wiggled her eyebrows at Aidan\u2019s greeting.Leo sighed in response.\u201cIf you lost against Aidan then, isn\u2019t it time to stop?\u201d\u201cLost? It was a draw. I haven\u2019t been able to properly settle with Aidan yet and this is mine and Aidan\u2019s business. Would you mind not interfering?\u201d\u201cUgh.\u201dLeo shook his head.It wasn\u2019t long ago that Tracey Friad approached Aidan. The trigger happened during a real magic battle. Aidan, who didn\u2019t know anything yet, got into a match with Tracey, and that\u2019s where the relationship between the two began.The situation was favorable for Tracey, but the problem was the unusual magic that Aidan possessed.\u201cLet\u2019s fight again with all our might.\u201d\u201cUh, huh? That, well.\u201dThe match then ended in a rather ambiguous result of a draw, but Tracey could not accept it. In order to revive the now-defunct Friad family Tracey has always done her best to study magic and worked hard.She wanted to be the best in the first grade, in fact her admissions grades were in the top five. However, the fact that she could not win a proper victory over a commoner hurt her self-esteem.\u201cIn the evening after class.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Tracey, I don\u2019t think I can do it today.\u201d\u201cThen tomorrow!\u201d\u201cTomorrow too\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy!\u201d\u201cBecause there is a werewolf out there and we can\u2019t be active at night. If caught by the teachers, we\u2019ll be penalized.\u201d\u201cUgh.\u201dAt Aidan\u2019s excuse, Tracey folded her arms, and then a smirk crept across her lips.\u201cAre you using that as an excuse to run away from me? I know everything. Are you scared?\u201dCaught by this, Aidan said,\u201cYes. Okay. Then like that.\u201dAidan didn\u2019t want to fight with his friend\u2014even though he would vehemently deny Tracey was his friend\u2014so he decided to surrender.Tracey raised her eyebrows and shouted into Aidan\u2019s face.\u201cI will win Aidan!\u201d\u201cYes? What?\u201d\u201cIf you can\u2019t fight, can you do something else?\u201d\u201cNo, so that\u2019s\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWerewolf.\u201dWhen the topic came up, Aidan and Leo looked at each other and then stared at Tracey again.He was already worried about what kind of absurd proposal she would come up with.\u201cLet\u2019s say whoever catches the werewolf first wins the bet. How is it? Are you sure you won\u2019t be scared and run away?\u201d\u201cNo\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cOkay. I will do it.\u201d\u201cLeo?!\u201dAidan tried to say no because it was dangerous, but instead he was astonished at Leo\u2019s action, which intercepted his words.\u201cGreat! The loser grants a wish to the winner!\u201dTracey replied \u2018Of course!\u2019 to Leo\u2019s provocation and left the room.\u201cLeo. Why did you suddenly accept such an outrageous offer?\u201d\u201cIdiot. If you don\u2019t do it there, she\u2019s sure to annoy us again. So, I gave it a fair shot and passed it on. Look, she left right away now peace has come.\u201d\u201cStill\u2026Lying is bad. I don\u2019t even care about the werewolf in the first place.\u201d\u201cYou idiot. Is that the problem now? After all, the teachers will take care of the werewolf. We just have to stay still.\u201d\u201cUnless she\u2019s an idiot, she wouldn\u2019t do such a reckless thing on her own.\u201d\u201c\u2026 No way.\u201dAidan and Leo looked at the back door of the classroom where Tracey had disappeared at the same time.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dNo matter how reckless you are, you can\u2019t do something like that.\u201c\u2026No way?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m afraid so.\u201dTracey was the kind of person who would do anything.The two of them looked straight out the window. There, they saw the familiar red hair sprinting and heading somewhere. The direction was on the opposite side of the women\u2019s dormitory.It was in the direction of a dangerous forest where teachers had warned never to go at the beginning of the semester.\u201cSomething has happened.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I was not wrong.\u2019Rosen, a family that is the most important object of the empire. Sedina was born there. It may seem like a good family to others, but to Sedina, the Rosen family was a more terrifying place than hell.Her surname, Rosen, has always followed her cursedly, even when she came out of her family. In order to break free from her hated family, Sedina joined the Black Dawn.She wanted to get rid of the Rosen name and to find the true self in the Black Dawn. Knowing it was anti-social and unethical, she chose that path.\u2018Here I can live on my own, not as a little girl from the Rosen family.\u2019But the reality didn\u2019t work out that way.Black Dawn was a place of resistance to the world and most of its members were low-class or criminals who ruled the bottom of society. In such a place, Sedina, who had the last name Rosen, was a very foreign entity.-What? You have a surname? Really?\u2013 Rosen? Why the hell is a person from such a great family here?-Look out. She could be a spy.-It\u2019s like the damn upper classes.Unlike them who came up from the mud, there was no way they could acknowledge Sedina who came down from the top. That\u2019s why even though she\u2019s gifted in magic and enrolled in Theon she\u2019s still a Third Order.\u2018I just wanted to be recognized.\u2019She wanted to get rid of that hateful family so she joined the Black Dawn. It wasn\u2019t her goal to eat well and live well. She believed that if she worked hard, their vigilance and contempt for her would gradually reduce.However, the Black Dawn members\u2019 boundaries toward Sedina grew stronger, and she became a target of envy and jealousy because she even had the ability to enter Theon.Without even receiving the attention of the First Order, she was kept at the end of the Third Order because of the restraints of other members.The name of the Rosen family could be used, that intention was conveyed so clearly that it brutally pierced Sedina\u2019s delicate heart.\u2018But I met him.\u2019Now when she was tired and thought that everything was over new orders came from the organization. She was ordered by the Second Order, to meet Codename <John Doe>.Unlike other First Orders, he was an unknown existence whose true form and identity are not revealed. She was told to contact him and check the progress of the mission.This man, now known as Rudger Chelici, was a master of disguise and an executive specializing in infiltration and assassination, who never revealed his true identity. However, there was a flaw: his personality was very dirty.If disturbed even members of Black Dawn were beaten on the spot or even killed in extreme cases. Even such behavior was tolerated by the Zero Order, the leader of the Black Dawn. Unless one was a First Order cadre, Rudger was a symbol of fear within the Black Dawn.To be given a mission to meet Rudger was the same as sending her to die at his hands. Sedina Rosen was in tears from her displeasure. The Black Dawn\u2019s comrades told her to go die.She even thought of returning back to her family.\u2018I do not like it.\u2019She hated her family so terribly that she would rather die so she went to Rudger with a mindset of being prepared for death. But when she got closer, the man\u2019s charisma was beyond imagination, and Sedina trembled without realizing it.She made mistakes, and her voice was shaky. She committed almost everything she was told not to do in front of him.\u2018I might die.\u2019She thought so but surprisingly Rudger didn\u2019t kill her. Even his murderous intent was not revealed. As rumored, she felt that his personality was dirty and eccentric during the conversation, but in the end that was all.Rudger let her go without saying a word and today even complimented her for being good at explaining. If it was just the words that came out of his mouth, she wouldn\u2019t have been so happy. But in Rudger\u2019s words, there was sincerity in his actions.He listened more carefully than anyone else, from correcting her to addressing him as Professor Rudger rather than First Order.She thought she might be able to help someone.\u2018First order. No, Mr. Rudger Chelici is really great.\u2019From the first time they met, seeing him, she felt her heart pound. She thought it was her because of her nervousness and fear at the time, but with their meeting today, she was sure.She has an endless adoration for someone she truly cares and desires to serve. She doesn\u2019t think she\u2019s been treated this way because she\u2019s special. She was only rewarded a little for the misery and hard work she had been through.Rudger Chelici may have done some good deeds for his subordinates as an executive of the organization.It is too early to judge him but for the first time she had been praised by someone for doing something right.* * *When the sun was setting and it was time to go home, Rudger put on his coat and checked all his gear. In order to hunt werewolves in earnest, speed was essential, and of course he had to prepare all the necessary tools for hunting.These are highly confidential items that are not revealed much on the outside, so people passing by will not be suspicious of them. With that in mind, Rudger left the classroom and met Hugo who had just come to him.\u201cHuh! Mr. Rudger!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Sir Hugo Burtag.\u201dMarquis Hugo Burtag, leader of the Burtag family, a famous magician with a long history in the Exilion Empire. However, the family is gradually declining because of its excessive magic and authoritarian tendencies, unable to properly accept modern science.A man, who had a confrontation with the president, came to Rudger.\u201cDo you have anything to do with me?\u201d\u201cHuh. This man Do I have to do anything big to find you?\u201dHugo showed a friendly attitude that said he came to Rudger to make him an offer.\u201cYou haven\u2019t met the other teachers properly yet, right? You seem to be getting along only with the other new teachers.\u201d\u201cIs there any problem with that?\u201dHugo\u2019s eyebrows twitched at Rudger\u2019s stern attitude, not even bending over, let alone embarrass himself however Hugo decided to bear with it.\u201cI would like to introduce you to professors I am close with.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAt Hugo\u2019s subtle restraint, Rudger knew at once what he had come to see him for.\u2018Faction recruitment.\u2019Hugo intended to bring Rudger to a faction of teachers made entirely of aristocrats. Even in this situation where students are trembling with anxiety because of the werewolf, they are fighting to divide sides for power?Rudger shook his head at Hugo\u2019s funny attitude.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m comfortable right now.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dHugo\u2019s face turned red at Rudger\u2019s direct refusal.\u201cDo you know how many years I\u2019ve been a teacher here?\u201d\u201cShould I know?\u201d\u201cAbout 15 years. Except for Marie Ross, that old woman, I\u2019m the next oldest person. I should be a distant senior and superior to you!\u201d\u201cAre you talking about superiors?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cThat is strange. The only supervisor I have is the president.\u201dHugo clenched his teeth at the word \u2018President\u2019.To Hugo, the word president was not at all pleasant. Rather, it was more like a repulsion that awakened his inferiority and anger.\u201cMr. Rudger. I heard you were in the military before you came here.\u201d\u201cIt was just a short stay.\u201d\u201cWasn\u2019t it said that while hunting cryptids, you also made a major breakthrough?\u201dHave you gotten that information already?No, it was intentionally leaked from the Black Dawn anyway, so it wouldn\u2019t be strange to say that someone like Hugo knew about it.Rudger nodded his head.\u201cI\u2019m speaking in high regard for your abilities. Do you have any desire to re-establish your family? With the support of our noble faction, this is possible.\u201dHugo chose to make the most concessions where he could step back, he was impatient.The faction of the president was getting stronger day by day. In particular, the current president, despite her young age, is a 6th-level Lexer-class wizard and possesses her innate political abilities, making her an opponent that even Hugo couldn\u2019t be careless about.\u2018If it wasn\u2019t for that woman, I would have been the next president!\u2019Hugo was dissatisfied with that. Even now, instead of being nice to the noble students, the president is showing more care towards the commoners.There are as many as five new teachers this time, of which three are commoners, one is a fallen nobleman and only one pure blood noble.\u2018It hurts my self-esteem but we must bring Rudger Chelici to our faction.\u2019He already knew that Rudger was a Fallen Nobility. Normally, he wouldn\u2019t have looked at him, but the situation was urgent, so he had no choice. Besides, Rudger Chelici was a wizard who reached the fourth rank at a young age, and he was quite a talented man.Aside from his origins, he was perfect in everything so Hugo himself had come to see him.\u201cI can help you. So what about it? Holding hands with us.\u201d\u201cWhat exactly do you mean by holding hands?\u201dThis time, instead of rejection, a question came back.Hugo continued, thinking that Rudger was finally interested.\u201cAll we need to do is to build friendships with each other, get support from other nobles, and take better care of their children.\u201d\u201cIn other words, you mean to provide convenience to noble students?\u201d\u201cUh-huh. It\u2019s just a little bit of flexibility.\u201dHugo thought Rudger was almost won over. The fact that this man was a soldier in the first place must have been because he was planning to rebuild his family again by obtaining achievements somehow. Hugo judged Rudger\u2019s actions that way.\u201cThen I can\u2019t do it.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dHugo, who didn\u2019t expect an answer of refusal, asked stupidly.\u201cI appreciate the offer, but I will decline it.\u201d\u201cAre you serious?\u201d\u201cYes. Saying that students should be treated differently, I\u2019ll pretend I didn\u2019t hear it.\u201d\u201cNo discrimination! We just want to be flexible!\u201d\u201cThen I will ask. If the president gives a better benefit to certain commoner students and wraps it up as flexibility, are you willing to follow it?\u201d\u201cWhat? No, are commoners and nobles the same? You have to say something that makes sense!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dHugo had a blank face. That\u2019s it. What do you mean by that?\u201cFlexibility is something that should be applied to both sides, not one-sided. But if flexibility applies only to nobles, it is no longer flexible. It\u2019s a privilege.\u201d\u201cNo, so the nobility\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThere are no commoners, nobility, or royalty within Theon. All of them are just students learning magic. I have no intention of giving up on this idea.\u201d\u201cThis\u2026\u2026!\u201dHugo clenched his teeth at Rudger\u2019s words.Shaking his anger, Hugo rolled up one of his lips and grunted at Rudger.\u201cOkay. I was short sighted. By the time I came here, I overlooked that the president might have used her hand.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean.\u201dRudger was sincere.In the first place, he had absolutely no intention of joining a man like Hugo.He\u2019ll help build his family up? If he does, it will be revealed that this family is a fake. From Hugo\u2019s point of view, he said he would help, but to Rudger, it was only a hoax that would reveal his identity.In the first place, he had no intention of rebuilding a fallen family. His only purpose is to stay here for two years without being discovered. Besides, he was concerned about holding hands with Hugo and fighting the president.No matter how he looked at it, Hugo and the president were not equal. Hugo himself wouldn\u2019t think so, but in Rudger\u2019s eyes, the president was far more overwhelming.\u2018If I do something strange and get caught in the president\u2019s eyes it won\u2019t be worth it.\u2019Tigers exist in the mountains, but there is no fool who holds hands with foxes. It would be ideal to play tightrope without belonging to either side, but Rudger had no choice but to make a decision when his opponent was so direct.If he had to choose between the two, he would choose the president. It\u2019s more comfortable with the president, who treats everyone equally, rather than the authoritarian character of the aristocracy.\u201cI have to patrol so I\u2019ll take my leave. Sir Hugo it can be dangerous outside so you should stay inside.\u201d\u201cYou will regret it.\u201dRudger\u2019s provocative words made Hugo\u2019s face red like a boiled octopus. His thick cheeks quivered, but Hugo didn\u2019t say anything to Rudger\u2019s back as he was already leaving.To be honest, it was because he was frightened by the sight of Rudger staring at him. Hugo didn\u2019t want to admit it but he was scared.Hugo stomped on the pitiful ground with his feet and left, groaning.He cherished the idea of penalizing a student if he catches one.* * *After leaving Hugo, Rudger went on patrol outside. As the sun went down, the magic lamps were turned on inside Theon, and the light spread all around.Rudger sighed inwardly and headed for the nearby bush.\u201cYou must have been told to go back to the dormitory right away.\u201dRudger said coldly, staring at the three students looking up at him with puzzled faces.\u201cOr, you heard it, but decided to play around.\u201d\u201cThat teacher, that, not that\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cAll three of you will receive five penalty points.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 27": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Academy\u2019s Undercover ProfessorCH 27Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayC27: Werewolf (2)After that, I went on patrol, captured nearly 20 students, penalized them, and forced them back to their dormitories.Why do these bastards keep walking around at night? They\u2019re freshmen, so they\u2019re immature but seeing sophomores also involved is giving me a headache.\u2018That means everyone is interested in this werewolf incident.\u2019The sun has already set, and darkness is all around. Although there are security guards and teachers patrolling, there are still quite a few students hiding inside this beautiful property.\u2018Students are children who can use magic, so ordinary users will not be able to find the hidden ones.\u2019That must have fueled their sense of adventure even more. To be honest, I was going to just ignore it and pass by, but every time I pass by, one or two stand out.\u2018A lot of them.\u2019Most of the students were obsessed with their own ambitions to capture the werewolf because an official notice came from Leathervelk. Anyone who could kill or capture an werewolf would be rewarded.\u2018In addition to wanting to become a hero, if they catch it, Leathervelk will pay them money and increase their reputation, there is no one who will turn away from such a chance.\u2019For commoners who lack money, the bounty obtained by defeating the werewolf must be very attractive.In the case of the commoners, there is a system that provides them scholarships within Theon internally, but that doesn\u2019t mean they will receive all of the magic textbooks and other supplies. There are many things wizards need money for and it\u2019s the same for students.If they become heroes and get noticed by some rich people they might get sponsored by them.Some boys seem to have done this because they couldn\u2019t beat their youthful energy just to get the attention of the opposite sex.\u2018It seems that I have sent everyone back, so I have to start tracking the werewolf again.\u2019I wasted a lot of time. Besides, I realized that the situation was more serious than I had thought. I had no idea that there would be so many students.The other teachers will feel something strange and work harder. If someone other than me finds the werewolf first and discovers that it\u2019s been created in a lab the situation will get out of control.\u2018So before that, I\u2019ll take care of it.\u2019I headed to the sewage treatment plant, the most likely route for the werewolves to sneak into Theon Academy.As Theon has a vast site, it uses quite a lot of water, so there is a huge sewage treatment facility on the outskirts of the campus. A place that draws in huge amounts of water from the Lemzier River and at the same time discharges a large amount of water through huge earth pipes.Considering the size of the werewolf I encountered at that time, there is a high probability that it came through the earth pipe.\u2018Fortunately, no one seems to have come this far.\u2019Most teachers go on patrols and send students back just in case something goes wrong. No one, like me, wondered where the werewolf came from and followed its tracks because that isn\u2019t the wizard\u2019s way, but the hunter\u2019s way.After wandering around the darkened sewage treatment plant, I finally found a trace.\u2018Footprint.\u2019The footprints clearly marked on the bushes looked like they had been engraved for several days. When I got closer and wiped it with my hand, it was clear.\u2018Comparing the size of the footprint, it\u2019s slightly smaller than the one I saw at that time.\u2019But there was one problem. There were two types of footprints.Everyone believes that there\u2019s only one werewolf but there might be 2 of them inside Theon.\u2018I thought there was only one, but looking at the imprints, it seems that the guy who ate people from Leathervelk came all the way here.\u2019I moved slowly and followed the trail of footsteps. The two footsteps moved in the same direction at first, but then split in two directions, small ones to the right, large ones to the left.I didn\u2019t expect these guys to separate here. Wolves are pack animals so werewolves who inherited that tendency are the same. Normally, they should have stayed together.I don\u2019t know why, but they started to move apart so I had to make a choice.* * *\u2018It\u2019s late.\u2019Rene, with her ash gray hair color, which is rare even in Theon, was running around the lot with a magic textbook in her arms. It had been a while since she fell asleep while studying in the library.She looked out her window, pulling the hair clinging to her cheeks, and, seeing the sun set, hurriedly ran out of the library. As she ran towards her dorm, Rene had no choice but to blame herself.\u2018You idiot! Why did you fall asleep there?\u2019Over the past few days, while reducing her sleep time, fatigue has accumulated due to immersion in homework and study.The teacher decided that students should go back to their dormitory after classes but she fell asleep in the library. It is the duty of the students to control their physical condition. Just because she fell asleep doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not her fault.If the teachers caught her she had no excuse for getting penalized.\u2018Still, it\u2019s a bit painful to receive a penalty point.\u2019Running out of money, she was living on her scholarship. However, if the student has a penalty point, the amount of the scholarship will be reduced. In some cases, the scholarship application would be rejected when the student has too many penalty points.She hoped that she wouldn\u2019t be penalized so badly for this incident, but the fact that she would be penalized was a burden to her.\u2018But can\u2019t I just go back to the dormitory as soon as possible before I get caught?\u2019She had to avoid the dormitory supervisor\u2019s eyes, but in the case of the non-teachers, she was confident that she would not be found out. She already thought that the penalty points were certain. There was a glimmer of hope that she might not get caught, as she hid her body in the dark.\u2018Even so, it was too much. How can no one wake me up?\u2019After thinking about that, Rene sighed deeply.Originally, it was the basic thing for students attending the academy to make friends and get to know each other, but in fact, from the beginning of the semester, she had a quarrel with an aristocrat and was swept away by turmoil.Because of that conflict she was targeted by the noble students and other commoner students stopped approaching her. Still, there were some boys who asked if she was okay the next day after the incident. They were all enamored with her appearance and approached with certain thoughts.She said that she didn\u2019t want to be friends with people like that.\u2018The librarian was also absent. They didn\u2019t even want to wake me up in the first place.\u2019Perhaps the person who works as a librarian is also on the side of the aristocrats. Feeling embarrassed about her own situation, Rene bit her lip.It was at that moment when she vowed to go home and wash up and organize the contents of today\u2019s class.\u2500\u2500Crush.\u201cHey, why are you there?\u201dRene unconsciously stopped his steps and shook her body. The fact that the grass beyond the darkness, where the trees were planted moved wasn\u2019t her imagination.\u201cCome out otherwise, I will call the teachers.\u201dThe rumors of a werewolf that have been circulating recently had been well heard by Rene and she couldn\u2019t dismiss it as a mere rumor since 2 students have been injured. Thinking that the werewolf was real a chill ran down her spine.Rene moved her trembling feet and stepped back. At that moment, the rustling in the darkness came swiftly towards her and something popped out from a bush.Rene squeezed her eyes shut and shouted.\u201cI have no taste at all! If you eat something like me, you will only get a stomach ache!\u201dBut the wolf\u2019s cry was not heard. There was no pain either.Rene opened her eyes and the first thing she saw in the light of the street lamp was blonde hair.The student had leaves all over her but her nobility never faded. She put her hands on her waist and stared at Rene with a curious gaze. She was a year older than Rene and was a princess of this country.\u201cAren\u2019t you too rude?\u201d\u201cUh, huh?\u201dRene immediately recognized who was in front of her.\u201cWow, Princess?\u201dThird Princess Erendir von Exilion.Rene saw her in Rudger class, so she immediately shook her head. But when Rene tried to bow her head, Princess Erendir stopped her.\u201cNo, it\u2019s ok.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIt was my fault that I surprised you in the first place but this is Theon and in Theon, everyone is equal. You and I are the same.\u201dAt Erendir\u2019s confident words, Rene opened her mouth without realizing it. She didn\u2019t know that she would hear Theon ideology from the princess.\u201cUh, why is that princess here\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t call me princess. Are you in 1st grade? Then you can just call me Erendir-senpai.\u201d\u201cMe, me?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m more comfortable with it. In the first place, I have no intention of arbitrarily using my position in Theon. Junior, did you say that your name was Rene?\u201d\u201cHuh? Do you know me?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re taking the manifestation class together. I have a good memory.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s great.\u201d\u201cWell, actually, the class is very special. It remained in my memory quite strongly, and most of the students in that class remember it. And you are quite conspicuous.\u201dIs she talking about hair color? Rene smiled brightly. The color of my hair attracted the attention of the princess.\u201cSo, why is junior Rene, wandering around here late at night? Didn\u2019t the teachers warn you?\u201d\u201cWell, that\u2019s\u2026\u2026\u201dRene candidly answered why she was moving alone this late at night.Erendir, who had heard everything, widened her eyes.\u201cWhat? Nobody woke you up? Isn\u2019t that too much?\u201d\u201cIn the end, it was my fault for falling asleep.\u201d\u201cNo! I can\u2019t let this go. Why are they doing such a boring thing? I will talk with the librarian right now\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cMore importantly, what are you doing here?\u201dRene hurriedly changed the topic.\u201cOh, you mean me? I am currently in the role of finding and returning students who have not yet returned to the dormitory. Everyone is so noisy now.\u201d\u201cHuh\u2026\u2026Aren\u2019t seniors also students?\u201d\u201cYou do not have to worry because I am moving with permission.\u201d\u201cOh, I see.\u201d\u201cAnyway, let\u2019s go back. Oh, if you keep going like this, there will be a teacher, you should go back this way so you won\u2019t be found out.\u201d\u201cAh yes! Thank you!\u201dIt was at that moment when Rene nodded and was about to leave.\u201cCrung\u201dRene and Erendir heard a strange sound.\u201c\u2026\u2026Rene. Step back.\u201dErendir stared into the darkness and pulled out her staff. Two red eyes appeared in the darkness and slowly approached the two of them.A werewolf appeared in the light of a street lamp.\u201c\u2026\u2026Werewolves are real.\u201d\u201cThe rumors, weren\u2019t they fake?\u201d\u201cWhat are you surprised about? You were surprised when you first saw me.\u201d\u201cOh, that\u2019s\u2026everyone is surprised when something pops out of the dark!\u201d\u201cAnyway, this is a big deal.\u201dThe werewolf in front of them didn\u2019t look weak at first glance. There was an obvious murderous intent in its eyes.Neither Rene nor Erendir showed it but they were afraid. Still as rank 3 wizard she couldn\u2019t lose without doing anything.\u201c\u2500\u2500Get out of the way.\u201dAt that moment, a strong fire broke out in the air. A high-temperature flame engulfed the werewolf and burned him.\u201cKyaah\u201dThe werewolf screamed and rolled on the floor. He didn\u2019t die perhaps because of the beast\u2019s instinct to avoid fire, but his flesh and skin burned and melted, so he could not escape the blow.The wound was also recovering quickly, but they had enough time. Their eyes turned to the place where the magic flew. A man was standing there.Rene called out his name without realizing it.\u201cMr. Rudger!\u201dRudger Chelici.Rudger\u2019s ice-cold gaze moved from the werewolf and turned to Rene and Erendir and slowly opened his mouth.\u201cRene and Erendir von Exilion.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cYes, teacher.\u201dThey were glad that Rudger had come to the rescue, and waited for his next words.\u201cBoth of you will receive five penalty points.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Also I changed Tracey to Tracy.\u201cYes?! Wait! Aren\u2019t you supposed to ask if we\u2019re okay at times like this?!\u201dErendir thought she had heard wrong.The teacher who saved them from the werewolf instantly gave them penalty points, this seemed quite unfair to Erendir.\u201cErendir, are you saying you did well?\u201d\u201cI got permission from another teacher!\u201d\u201cNoisy. Even if you get permission, you should act carefully. Don\u2019t you know what could\u2019ve happened to you just now?\u201d\u201cThat, that\u2026\u201dRudger was merciless even if his opponent was a princess. Even Erendir couldn\u2019t really refute Rudger\u2019s words.It was her status as a princess that allowed her to wander around at night like this and made it easy for her to make the excited students bow their heads and send them back to their dormitory.\u201cThen, at least make up for the penalty points of this child.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dRudger\u2019s gaze turned to Rene.\u201cRene.\u201d\u201cYes. Mr. Rudger.\u201d\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you go back to the dormitory?\u201d\u201cThat, that\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI admit that you are passionate about studying, but don\u2019t you know that doing such a thing in this kind of situation will cause trouble to others?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026I\u2019m sorry.\u201dRudger shook his head.\u201cErendir.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cTake responsibility for Rene and send her back to the dormitory. That way, she\u2019ll be free of the penalty points she just received.\u201d\u201cYes?

Most of the wounds from the magic had healed, but the guy was still distracted by the shuddering pain.The werewolf, who had been staring at them with eyes full of endless hostility, suddenly moved but instead of attacking he ran away.\u201cOh! It escaped!\u201dAt the same time as Rene shouted, Rudger followed the werewolf. He never meant to miss the werewolf he had barely found.Rene and Erendir haven\u2019t noticed yet, but that werewolf\u2019s neck was also stuffed with restraints. It was fortunate that the restraint ball was covered with hair and could not be seen properly. However, if someone else finds it later, it will be difficult to even destroy the evidence.Rudger filled his legs with magic and ran.As he chased the werewolf through the dark grass and across the garden, he saw the werewolf crawling up the outer wall of the nearby research building to the roof.Sharp claws pierced the exterior walls of the building with ease, and its gigantic body eventually reached a rooftop full of spires.\u2018Can\u2019t let it escape.\u2019Rudger immediately soared vertically into the air using a wire launcher and landed on the roof. Erendir and Rene, who were still watching the scene from afar, opened their mouths in admiration.\u201cIs that just floating magic?\u201d\u201cMaybe?\u201dThe two people, who could not see the wire launcher because it was dark at night, thought that all of Rudger\u2019s movements were thanks to magic.Two silhouettes stood on the roof facing each other. It was not clearly visible from a distance, but it wasn\u2019t difficult to tell who Rudger was based on its size and approximate appearance.\u201cFull moon.\u201dThe clouds in the sky lifted, and before long a cold and cozy silver light poured down like the hem of a curtain. Tonight was a full moon night.Rudger moved first and the werewolf\u00a0 also rushed to Rudger. The two of them crossed each other and a close battle ensued.\u201cWow.\u201d\u201cOh my gosh.\u201dThere was something about Rudger\u2019s appearance that was hard to take their eyes off of. Under the moonlight, Rudger moves were like a dance, as he avoided the werewolf\u2019s attacks.Even though the girls were far away, they could feel the trembling attacks on their skin but nothing could touch Rudger.He used multiple attributes magics arrows like fire, ice, wind and although their power was only around second rank they precisely targeted the werewolf\u2019s vital parts and inflicted him with wounds.\u2018It\u2019s said he was in the army before he came here.\u2019Erendir thought of Rudger Chelici. She wasn\u2019t particularly interested in him, but her maid brought her his information, just in case, so all she saw was on a whim. As she remembered, Rudger Chelici was in the army, and even achieved a record while hunting cryptids.As she watched Rudger fight Erendir thought that he looked more like a hunter than a wizard.The werewolf made a rough noise and rolled over the roof, then glided down the slope. Rudger did not miss it as a predator that never misses the gap created by its wounded prey.Three ice spears the size of a fist pierced the werewolf\u2019s body in a row and fixed it on the roof. Even though a werewolf has excellent regenerative ability he still pierced instantly because of this attack.The fight was over.\u2018Whoa. I\u2019m tired.\u2019Rudger realized that he had expended considerable mana in the fight.\u2018It\u2019s not good to use a lot of magic power.\u2019Luckily, he met Hans and was able to bring his medicine back. If he hadn\u2019t, it would have been a big deal.Originally he didn\u2019t want to use magic against the werewolf but because he\u2019s in Theon and many eyes are watching him he couldn\u2019t use other methods.\u2018It\u2019s impossible for a magic teacher not to use magic in front of his students.\u2019First of all, he is a famous teacher of Theon, but if he uses tools or other methods he used in his hunter days, not magic, that would raise suspicions.\u2018I need to finish it before it gets any more troublesome.\u2019Aside from this guy, there is still one more lurking in Theon.\u2018I was planning to finish both werewolves by the end of today.\u2019As Rudger slowly approached, the staggering werewolf suddenly flashed his arms.His doubts disappeared the moment he saw the fragments of the building thrown by the werewolf.\u2018What?\u2019Rudger immediately unleashed his magical powers, creating a barrier around his body. The shards that flew in were hit and bounced off, but the problem was that the werewolf bought time for his next move.He immediately raised both of his hands up and slammed them hard on the roof. Due to the werewolf\u2019s strong muscular strength, the roof collapsed, and the werewolf also fell. Debris spread and a cloud of dust rose around it.Rudger narrowed his eyes at the sight.\u2018A Werewolf his head?\u2019Even if they are artificial creatures that are not cryptids, as they are based on wolves, their instincts as beasts are of course the most advanced.Not only did he run away when he felt a crisis, but Rudger didn\u2019t even expect that he would throw up the wreckage of a broken building.\u2018Did I miss it?\u2019Rudger, who entered the building through the hole in the roof, realized that the werewolf had disappeared and clicked his tongue. However, he didn\u2019t completely miss it because there was a scent that subtly stimulated his nose in the air.\u2018It was good that I buried the incense in the middle of the fight just in case.\u2019Rudger followed the scent of the werewolf\u2019s traces. He still had the thoughts of finishing the entire thing today because he wanted to live.* * *\u201cTracy! Tracy! Where are you?\u201d\u201cAidan. I can\u2019t see her no matter how much I look around. Wouldn\u2019t it be better to just give up?\u201dAidan and Leo were diligently searching out of sight to find Tracy.The last time they heard that Tracy had gone to the forest to the east, the two continued to search for her even as the sun went down. However, no trace of Tracy could be found.Leo, who was starting to get annoyed, spoke first.\u201cI thought Tracy couldn\u2019t do it, so she would have resigned on her own. Wouldn\u2019t that be the case since we can\u2019t find her?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s our fault for not properly rejecting Tracy\u2019s bet, no matter how absurd it was.\u201dLeo put on a sullen expression at Aidan\u2019s reply.It was Leo\u2019s fault that Tracy made the bet and he was feeling a little guilty, that\u2019s why he kept looking for Tracy even after nightfall.\u201cStill, if we get caught by the teachers, we are at risk too. Others will say that it is only a penalty point, but from the point of view of the person who has to be concerned about his rank, such a penalty point is too important.\u201d\u201cI still can\u2019t let it go.\u201d\u201cDo you really believe Tracy is still looking for the werewolf?\u201d\u201cIf it was someone else I wouldn\u2019t but Tracy\u2026.\u201dIn fact, even Aidan didn\u2019t know why he was so sure what he had said.There was something familiar in Tracy\u2019s eyes: it was the obsession of a person who always wanted to achieve something. He thought that if she was like that, maybe she could really mess around with her life to catch the werewolf.\u201cUgh. Okay. Let\u2019s search for another 30 minutes. If we can\u2019t find anything we\u2019ll go back.\u201dLeo sighed as he looked at Aidan. He knew enough that this good-natured guy was stubborn and didn\u2019t make any compromises at important moments.It was the moment when the two of them, who had taken a little rest, were about to move again.\u201cKyaaaaaa!!\u201dA girl\u2019s scream is heard from afar. The strangely familiar voice was, of course, the voice of Tracy Friad, whom they had been looking for.\u201cLeo!\u201d\u201cOver there!\u201dThe two ran through the grass and branches to where the scream was heard. At that moment, the grass on the other side shook and someone jumped out and Aidan, who was running in the lead, collided with it.\u201cWhat is it all of a sudden?\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dAidan lifted his head as he felt the strong pressure on his body had fallen backwards. The first thing he saw was red hair that did not lose its presence even in the soft moonlight.\u201c\u2026\u2026Tracy?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Aidan?\u201dTracy, realizing who she was hugging on top, got up in a hurry.\u201cYou! Why are you here?\u201d\u201cI heard your screams\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat?! What scream?!\u201dSeeing Tracy blushing and yelling at Aidan, Leo sighed, thinking that he was worried about nothing but then the cry of the beast was heard.\u201cUgh! Aidan, you heard it?\u201d\u201cHuh. Is it really a werewolf?\u201dThe vigilant gazes of the two men turned towards the bushes and they both pulled out their wands but then Tracy stood in front of them.\u201cBoth of you wait a minute.\u201d\u201cTracy what are you doing?\u201dAt Aidan\u2019s question, Tracy hesitated then placed a finger on her lips and motioned for the two of them to follow.Aidan and Leo looked at each other wondering what this was, but eventually decided to follow Tracy\u2019s footsteps. The three of them moved quietly and eventually reached the front of the basin where the ground was swept away.\u201cLook over there.\u201dAs they looked in the direction she was pointing in a quiet voice, they saw something wriggling in the center of a basin full of fallen leaves.\u201cThat\u2026\u2026\u201dAidan, a country boy with good night eyes, immediately recognized what it was.\u201cWerewolf?\u201dIt was definitely a werewolf. There were scars all over the place, and he was still gasping for breath, but that was definitely the case.\u201cAre you a kid?\u201dThe small werewolf was a baby that had not yet become an adult.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Sorry for not posting any chapters last week I\u2019ve been very busy. I will post at least 1 more chapter today.Aidan and Leo only looked into each other\u2019s eyes. The culprit who drove Theon into the chaos was now in front of them but he was still a cub. Even the grunting made it clear that he was injured somewhere\u201cI stumbled upon it a while ago.\u201dWhy was Tracy screaming? She was wandering around without much thought and suddenly found a werewolf. Tracy, who blushed as if she was ashamed of that fact, immediately raised her nose.\u201cWhat do you think? Did I win the bet?\u201d\u201cYou just found it. Wasn\u2019t the bet capturing it?\u201dAt Leo\u2019s point, Tracy immediately became furious.\u201cYes? Then I, right now\u2026\u2026!\u201d\u201cTracy, wait a minute.\u201dAidan pulled Tracy back as she was about to descend into the basin.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\u201cOh sorry. I did not know.\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you too rude to a lady?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not what\u2019s important right now.\u201d\u201cWhat is it then?\u201dA smirk crept across her lips as if Tracy realized something immediately.\u201cHeh heh\u2026Aidan Are you impatient because I found that werewolf? You were secretly pretending not to, but you were also concerned about losing to me.\u201d\u201cTracy, didn\u2019t you feel something strange?\u201dWhen a serious question came back to answer provocation, Tracy pouted her lips as if she had lost steam.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cOver there is a werewolf cub. Regardless of whether it is possible for a werewolf to have a cub, the cub over there right now looks injured. I can\u2019t seem to move properly.\u201d\u201cYes. But why?\u201d\u201cLook, there are fallen leaves all around. Besides, it\u2019s a clever location that people don\u2019t notice around here. No matter how wide Theon is, I have never heard of a place like this in the forest.\u201d\u201cNo, I mean, what does that mean?\u201d\u201cDo you think that little werewolf settled down here alone and collected fallen leaves?\u201dHaving heard that Tracy realized something and kept her mouth shut. There\u2019s no way an injured werewolf cub could have come all the way here alone. It sounds like there is something else out there that has helped him.\u201cWho the hell?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know who it is. Perhaps\u2026\u2026There may be another werewolf.\u201dEven as Aidan said that, he did not take his eyes off the werewolf baby because by any chance, he might notice their existence and attack them all of a sudden.Although he is a cub, he\u2019s bigger than most large dogs. Risk factors could not be ruled out.\u2018Uh?\u2019Aidan, who was closely examining the werewolf, noticed something strange. Near the nape of the werewolf\u2019s neck, covered in fallen leaves and showing only a bust, it was as if he had seen something glistening in the moonlight.\u2018That\u2019s a collar\u2026\u2026?\u2019At that moment, Aidan decided that the werewolf was not simply a natural occurrence.\u201cAidan? What are you doing?\u201dLeo spoke, feeling that Aidan\u2019s expression was unusual.Aidan glided down the basin as if he had made up his mind to do something.\u201cAidan! Hey, hey!\u201dLeo was perplexed, and so was Tracy. The two hurriedly followed Aidan, who came down to the center of the basin that was more than 5 meters high and slowly approached the werewolf cub.\u201cAidan! What are you doing now! It\u2019s dangerous!\u201d\u201cThere is something strange about it.\u201dAidan wanted to confirm it with his own two eyes. At that moment, the werewolf cub opened his eyes and stared at Aidan.Aidan paused as he approached cautiously. Their gazes were entangled in the air, and a suffocating tension lingered.\u2018Gulp.\u2019Aidan swallowed his dry saliva and slowly reached out his hand.\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I mean no harm.\u201dThe reason he said that was because he saw the werewolf\u2019s eyes and there was no hostility or intent to kill in them. Those transparent, clear eyes staring at him were filled with only the innocence of a country dog.A werewolf with those eyes attacked people and sent them to the hospital?Aidan didn\u2019t think so.Leo and Tracy had no intention of stopping Aidan. The cub, who was staring at him, immediately turned its head and closed its eyes again.Aidan sighed inwardly and moved closer to the cub. As expected, he was quiet. He even made a growling noise as Aidan swept his hair once with his hand.\u201cIt hurts a lot.\u201dSaying so, Aidan looked at the wounds exposed outside the fallen leaves.\u2018Isn\u2019t it bitten by an animal?\u2019The marks on his body were not from being attacked by other beasts. Rather, it was more like a cut.He touched his neck with the hand that had been stroking his head, and felt the touch of a hard, cold metal.\u2018I thought he was just a werewolf, but there\u2019s something more.\u2019While Aidan was thinking in the darkness the sound of something approaching was heard. Leo, who recognized the abnormality first, shouted.\u201cAidan! Be careful!\u201dAs soon as Aidan heard the sound, he flew in the opposite direction of the sound. Immediately after, a huge shock hit his body.\u201cBig!\u201dAidan, who bounced more than 3m and rolled on the floor, corrected his dizziness, and looked at the unknown entity that blew him away.\u2018Werewolf!\u2019It was an adult werewolf, 1.5 times larger than the cub werewolf. He glared at Aidan as if he was going to kill him, and then stood as if protecting the baby.\u201cGee, an adult werewolf.\u201dTracy trembled at the sight, and then, as if she was prepared for something, raised her wand and generated magical power. The werewolf also glared at her if she thought Tracy was doing something.\u201cWhat are you doing!?\u201dLeo tried to stop her, but Tracy didn\u2019t listen. A werewolf, the root of all of the chaos in Theon, was in front of her. If she could deal with it she could revive her family that collapsed.The figure of the mother who struggled to smile saying that it was okay for her and trash-like people who turned to the subject that they usually cling to, as soon as their family collapsed as she thought of that she became more agitated.\u2018Only I can bring the Friads back to life. The werewolf in front of me is just a stepping stone for that.\u2019Hunting only one werewolf does not resurrect a destroyed family, Tracy knew that. It was okay just to collect the bounty from Leathervelk and establish her reputation. To do that, she learned magic, and came to Theon to succeed.\u2018I\u2026\u2026!\u2019The werewolf ran towards Tracy, it was fast and very threatening. Tracy, who tried to cast a spell, made a mistake because of the werewolf rushing towards her.Because of her impatience the magic that had barely been gathered was scattered in vain.Beyond the disappearance of the magic the figure of the werewolf approaching with its teeth facing her was seen.\u2018Is this the end?\u2019As he thought that, Tracy felt her body shove to the side. The sharp claws of the werewolf passed through the air right in front of her. As she rolled the floor with someone, Tracy was stunned.\u201cUh, huh?\u201d\u201cTracy, are you okay?\u201dIt was Aidan who saved her from her crisis. He is a boy that she keeps bothering and insists on fighting with. Had he been too late to push her, Tracy would have had her head blown away.\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re safe.\u201d\u201cYou, you. Why me\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cMy friend is in danger, and I can\u2019t just stand by and watch.\u201dFriend, at that one word Tracy was speechless. Aidan looked at the werewolf, not paying attention to Tracy\u2019s reaction.\u201cThere is something strange about his movements. I think it was seriously injured. Maybe that\u2019s why we were able to avoid it.\u201dAs expected, there were three large unclosed holes in the werewolf\u2019s chest, which was revealed in the dark. Aidan swallowed his saliva and opened his mouth.\u201cSorry. It wasn\u2019t intentional. We have no intention of doing any harm to your child.\u201d\u201cAidan? What are you doing now! There is no way a werewolf can understand you!\u201dTracy shouted from behind saying what a fool he was, but Aidan was serious. Aidan continued to speak, staring at the werewolf in front of him with an unshakable gaze.\u201cYou. Can you understand us?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026\u2026\u201dLeo and Tracy looked puzzled. However, the werewolf\u2019s reaction was strange. He was staring at him like he was going to kill him but calmed down and went back to the cub.Leo, who watched the scene, did not keep his mouth shut.\u201c\u2026\u2026Does this make sense?\u201d\u201cA little while ago, it overreacted because it was afraid the cub would be in danger.\u201d\u201cBut he attacked two students. Right now, he\u2019s quiet because of his cub, but I don\u2019t know when it will suddenly reveal his true colors.\u201dLeo\u2019s point was valid, but Aidan felt something indescribable. He knew it because he got very close to the werewolf cub. The moment he looked into the child\u2019s eyes, Aidan felt something.\u2018He said please help.\u2019\u201cLeo, Tracy I know what I\u2019m saying is nonsense but believe me just once.\u201dAidan said so and slowly approached the werewolf.The presumed mother looked at Aidan and threatened him by exposing his teeth, but Aidan raised his hands and made a gesture that it was not dangerous.\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201dWith that the distance gradually narrowed and the werewolf who was glaring at Aidan also stopped showing its hostility. Rather, it was because the condition of the baby was not good.\u201cUse this.\u201dAidan took out a small vial from the pocket he usually carried. It was a very basic healing potion that was completed while taking the curse and pharmaceutical classes.It may not be able to perform properly due to his insufficient skills, but at least it will be of sufficient help to improve the condition of the cub who is currently panting.At that moment a pure white light flew from somewhere and penetrated the mother\u2019s body.\u201cUh, huh?\u201dAidan, who was approaching slowly, and Leo and Tracy, who watched the scene while holding their breath from behind, were shocked and could not help but panic.Penetrating the mother werewolf\u2019s body was a shiny silvery metal. At first, it was thought to be a sharp spear, but eventually its shape collapsed and turned into a net, binding its mother\u2019s body.At the moment everyone panicked, a black shadow fell from the sky.\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201dIt was someone they know well.\u201cMr. Rudger?\u201dRudger, who subdued the werewolf with a surprise attack, narrowed his eyes at the three students.\u201cAidan, Leo, and Tracy Friad, what were my students doing in a place like this at this late hour?\u201dThe three of them trembled as their names were called. They knew that after getting caught by a teacher in this situation they couldn\u2019t escape punishment especially since it was Rudger who caught them.\u201cI will hold the three of you accountable for this later. Just step back.\u201dTracy and Leo followed suit but Aidan was different. He intervened between Rudger and the werewolf, blocking Rudger\u2019s path.\u201cWait!\u201d\u201c\u2026Aidan, what are you doing?\u201dAidan\u2019s body trembled at Rudger\u2019s cold voice, but he did not back down.\u201cMr. Rudger, wait a minute!\u201d\u201cWould you like me to wait?\u201d\u201cThere is something strange about that werewolf! No, I mean, to be precise\u2026\u2026You seem to understand people! So please reconsider killing that werewolf for a second!\u201dAidan spit out what he had learned like a rapid-fire cannon. Otherwise, he thought Rudger would choke the werewolf out of breath at any moment.\u201cWhat nonsense are you talking about now?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not bullshit. Maybe that werewolf\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI hate to hear it. Back off.\u201d\u201cMr. Rudger!\u201d\u201cI told you to leave.\u201dAidan did not step aside despite Rudger\u2019s warning.As Rudger gazed at Aidan, he noticed a figure of a werewolf baby over his shoulder, licking with his tongue the face of his mother. Without any viciousness, he was just purely worried about his family.The baby lying down got up. When the fallen leaves covering the entire body are pushed away and the rest of the body is exposed. Rudger saw it and his eyebrows twitched.\u201cUh?\u201dAidan, who was staring at Rudger, immediately noticed such a subtle change in Rudger.\u2018Why is the teacher like that?\u2019Aidan tried to turn around without thinking. At that moment, his body flew through the air as if strongly pulled by something and gently landed on the ground without a wound. A buffering effect using the power of wind, it was all Rudger\u2019s work.\u201cTeacher?\u201dThe moment Aidan was about to say something Rudger\u2019s magic was manifested. A hot fire that erupted in an instant, it swallowed the two werewolves and scattered a dazzling light in all directions.He could feel the heat even though he was far away. It was obviously an attack magic that would surely kill the opponent.There was no screaming from the werewolves swallowed up in the flames. Because there was no time for that, and without even feeling the pain, they became ashes and disappeared.When the magic fire was completely extinguished there was not even a trace of the werewolves left, there were only black ashes.\u201cGo back to the dormitory.\u201dRudger said so without looking back.\u201cYou will take responsibility for your deviant behavior tomorrow.\u201dThere was no emotion in his voice.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 30": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Academy\u2019s Undercover ProfessorCH 30Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayC30: The person who sees, the person who solves (2)Rudger stood still, staring at the place where the werewolf had been before. He burned it all down without a trace. All the evidence that he was a test subject, not a real werewolf was gone.\u2018It\u2019s over now.\u2019But Rudger\u2019s heart was not at all at ease. Until the other teachers who turned on their magic lights from afar arrived at the site one by one Rudger stood still.* * *The werewolf incident that made Theon Academy tumult came to an end when new teacher Rudger Chelici eliminated the werewolves.Several students argued that this incident was simply an inflated rumor but Rudger\u2019s bloody battle with a werewolf on the roof of a building under the full moon has already spread among students.Students have already talked about this incident in <Akashic Records>.-Is it true this time it was a real werewolf?-I actually saw it. On the roof of the laboratory building, the new teacher was fighting a werewolf, and it was really cool.-It\u2019s not a lie?-Actually, a part of the roof of the lab 3 building was broken, and there were signs of a fight.-Wow. So, did the real new teacher catch the werewolf?\u2013 Even if he\u2019s a new teacher, it was said that he is a former soldier. Then it is possible.-Awesome.So there was a question as to what the werewolf was and where it appeared. Some even argued that the werewolves were actually controlled by someone in the dark. However, in the absence of any clues, such opinions were nothing more than gossip.-Ah. I got caught and got 5 demerit points.-Me too.-Yes. I don\u2019t mind with 5 points~. I got merit points in advance.\u2013 Where do you live?Most of the students who went out to catch the werewolves this time were caught and were baptized with demerit points.130 out of all students and there were even 3rd graders among the dogs, so it was noisy.They set out to become heroes but instead they got penalty points so most of the students ripped their heads off in regret as to why they did it.It was the same for Aidan, Leo, and Tracy.\u201cAww! It\u2019s ruined! After all, it was taken by Mr. Rudger!\u201dCurrently, the three have been called to the interview room for a meeting with the president.Aidan had a serious face as if he was still pondering something, but Tracy was different, she was restless.She should have never have thought of using a loophole to rebuild her family, but this werewolf incident did not compensate for it, but rather was stamped out by Rudger.Tracy, out of anger, glared at her Aidan, but then she bit her lips and ruffled her hair wildly. She couldn\u2019t blame Aidan. It was, after all, Aidan who rescued her by throwing her away from her werewolf attack.\u2018Yes. I was just, I couldn\u2019t do anything back then\u2026\u2026.\u2019Feeling so foolish for herself, Tracy grabbed the skirt of her uniform with trembling hands. Did 10 minutes pass like that?The door to the interview room opened and the three Musketeers Aidan, Leo, and Tracy, who were sitting, jumped up.The president had pure white hair on the outside but inside she had an unusual pink e colored hair and she was walking into the interview room with a smile on her face.Following in the footsteps of the president was a man with a sober impression. It was Rudger Chelici, who had defeated the werewolf the night before.Rudger looked as usual. His attire was a long red coat, not the black frock coat he wore in the past, but his unwavering cleanliness was still there.\u201cNow. All three of you sit comfortably.\u201dAt the president\u2019s words, Aidan and the three other people looked at each other and sat down again.The president also sat in the empty chair.\u201cSit down, Mr. Rudger.\u201d\u201cI will stand here.\u201d\u201cWell, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re comfortable with. So, let\u2019s get to the point then. Do you know why I called the three of you?\u201dNo one answered hastily but they knew. There is only one reason why the three of them are here. Because they witnessed the werewolf up close and got caught up in it.Tracy, who didn\u2019t know she was going to face the President, thought that Rudger was really determined and sharpened her teeth. What does it mean to tell the president not to just give penalty points? Isn\u2019t this a declaration that it will never end with ordinary discipline?\u2018Damn!\u2019She was desperately holding back her tears. From that day on, she never forgot that she had vowed to herself that she would never cry again. Above all, she was also stimulated by the way Aidan and Leo were sitting casually.\u201cHow are you doing?\u201dThe President opened her mouth first but as she spoke, Aidan\u2019s gaze did not depart from Rudger.\u201cWhy do you think I called you?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026It doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s just to give us penalty points.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dIt was then that Rudger opened his mouth.\u201cThe three of you ignored Theon warning and went all the way to the forest to endanger yourself. If the situation had changed a little, someone in this place would have been dead.\u201dThe three of them had their mouths shut.\u201cThere was no accident and no one died, but I thought you should know for sure how serious your negligent behavior was. That is why I made a suggestion to the president.\u201dThey knew that those words had absolutely no good intentions for them. As a heavy atmosphere lingered in the interview room, the president clapped with both hands.\u201cNow, now. Everyone, don\u2019t look like the world is collapsing, think positive. Mr. Rudger, your words were a bit harsh and scared the students.\u201d\u201cPresident, this is not something to pass on like that.\u201d\u201cOf course, it is true that no one was injured thanks to Mr. Rudger\u2019s struggle, and it is also true that the students behaved complacent. But in the end, it ended well, didn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026I do not understand.\u201d\u201cThey are still children and Mr. Rudger already explained to me the situation. Aidan?\u201d\u201cYes Yes!\u201dWhen his name was suddenly called, Aidan hurriedly answered.\u201cI heard that you intervened to save Tracy from danger?\u201d\u201cOh no, that\u2019s\u2026\u2026just.\u201d\u201cCompetition among students is important, but it is better to help each other live than that. You also stayed with Aidan and faced the danger together.\u201dAt the words of praise that came out of the president\u2019s mouth one by one, embarrassment lingered on Aidan, Leo, and Tracy\u2019s faces. Why is the president like that?\u201cYour actions are clearly wrong. So I decided to take Mr. Rudger\u2019s opinion and give you 10 penalty points each.\u201d10 points is twice the number of points the other students received.\u201cBut.\u201dAt that moment, the president\u2019s clear voice awakened the three of them from their thoughts.\u201cYour actions at that moment of crisis are definitely worthy of praise. So I\u2019m going to give all three of you ten merit points.\u201d\u201cYeah?\u201d\u201cOh, is that really true?\u201dThe 10 penalty points disappeared in an instant but the president\u2019s speech did not end there.\u201cAidan. You showed the courage to think of your colleagues before your own body in a moment of crisis. I will give you an additional 10 merit points.\u201d\u201cUgh!\u201d\u201cLeo. You did not forget to grasp the situation calmly even in an emergency, and you deliberately left a trail here so that others can follow along.\u201d\u201cHow\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll give you 10 additional merit points and Tracy Friad.\u201d\u201cYes, yes!\u201d\u201cThe courage to fight a werewolf without running away, some will say that you\u2019re naive but you\u2019ve probably realized something. I hope you will keep that unshaken heart forever.\u201d\u201cYes Yes! All right!\u201d\u201cI will also give you 10 merit points.\u201dAs a result the three of them received 10 merit points each.\u201cMr. Rudger, don\u2019t you have any complaints?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026If that\u2019s what the president wants.\u201dRudger took a step back and drew a line that he had no objections.\u201cCongratulations. Keep working hard in the future.\u201d\u201cAh yes! Thank you President!\u201d\u201cBut don\u2019t overdo it. Alright you can leave now.\u201dThe three students left the interview room feeling like they were still dreaming. Aidan, who was going out last, stopped and looked at Rudger, but Rudger didn\u2019t even look at him.\u2018What was the reaction that Mr. Rudger showed at that time?\u2019Aidan left the interview room with unresolved questions. The door closed, leaving only Rudger and the President in the interview room.\u201cMr. Rudger, are you satisfied now?\u201dThe president said that when she completely lost sight of the students.\u201cI was really surprised. Mr. Rudger himself is asking me to take care of those children.\u201dWith her head tilted back and her legs waving, the President glanced at Rudger with half-open eyes.\u201cBesides, do all these things like I did.\u201d\u201cBecause it wasn\u2019t a very good picture to do like I did there.\u201d\u201cI know. Are you saying good cops are bad cops? Do you consider yourself a villain? Aren\u2019t you sorry?\u201d\u201cI just chose the most efficient way.\u201d\u201cOh yeah? Well, you\u2019re fine, so I won\u2019t ask any more. In the end, it was a good thing for the students.\u201dThe president jumped up from her seat, approached the window where she could see Theon, and wiped the transparent window with her slender fingertips.\u201cMr. Rudger. You said you dealt with the werewolves yourself?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWhat did you see there?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cDid something unusual happen?\u201dDespite the president\u2019s words, which seemed to be somewhat sharp, Rudger\u2019s expression did not change.\u201cI didn\u2019t feel that way.\u201d\u201cOkay?\u201d\u201cYes. I just pursued the werewolf and removed it for fear of being a threat to the students, just like I did in the military.\u201d\u201cHmm. Well, then there is nothing I can do.\u201dThe President did not ask any further questions. Rudger\u2019s protection of students and fighting werewolves was already famous enough to spread throughout the school.\u201cAnyway, I have to thank Mr. Rudger once again. Thankfully, no one died.\u201d\u201cI was just doing my job.\u201d\u201cSuch a proud attitude, I like it. Can I expect more from you in the future?\u201dRudger nodded without a word and returned to his office.As Rudger sat down, leaning against the back of his chair, he remembered what had happened the night before.He was surprised to see that the body of the werewolf cub that was hidden in fallen leaves that others had not yet discovered was obviously of a human child without animal hair.\u2018The Shamsus School did not use wolves as subjects to create werewolves.\u2019Rather, it was the opposite: they used humans. Instead of substituting human genes into wolves, they captured humans and forcibly mixed them with the elements of beasts.The bizarre behavior of the werewolf, who threw the shattered debris with his hands when it became an emergency, was now understandable. He wondered why his head was spinning so well that he didn\u2019t seem like a beast that should have no reason.\u2019A cub and his mother?\u2019The three werewolves who made Leathervelk and Theon noisy were a family. Child and two parents, just ordinary people caught up in an unfortunate incident. Rudger killed the three with his own hands.He clenched his fists.\u2018I have no regrets for my actions.\u2019If he had gone back to that time, Rudger would have made the same decision. Otherwise, he would have been in danger. All subjects had to be eliminated, and the clues that he was involved in the situation had to be erased. There was no other way.There have already been deaths due to werewolves. They killed and ate people so they were killed. Yes, that was it.\u2018Pupil.\u2019Those clear eyes of the baby that looked back at him at the end while licking his mother. Even while he was preparing his magic to kill them, the eyes staring at him did not contain any rebuke or anger towards Rudger.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dRudger stood up.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Only 1 chapter today.Aidan, Leo, and Tracy, who were sitting on a bench in a quiet garden, thought that what had just happened was like a dream, and had not returned to reality yet.It was Tracy who came to her senses first.\u201cWe really didn\u2019t get punished. It still feels like a dream.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t believe the president stepped forward and supported us.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201dLeo, who had always had a sharp conversation with Tracy, completely agreed with her opinion this time around.The eyes of the two of them eventually turned to Aidan.\u201cHey Aidan. Aidan?\u201d\u201cYes? Uh, yes.\u201d\u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201dUnlike the two people who were happy to receive the merit points, Aidan had a serious face all the time.\u201cAidan, what are you worried about?\u201d\u201cNo. Should it be a concern? That\u2026\u2026It\u2019s kind of strange to come and say something like this now.\u201d\u201cWhat is it? Don\u2019t be stingy and tell me!\u201dWhen Tracy slapped him hard, Aidan hesitated, and then he confided his concerns to his friends.\u201cIt\u2019s just something strange.\u201d\u201cStrange? What\u2019s strange?\u201d\u201cYou may not have seen it, but the werewolf had a strange silver restraint on his neck.\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201d\u201cShhh!\u201dAs Tracy\u2019s voice rose, Leo immediately told her to be quiet.\u201cQuiet. What would you do if someone heard it?\u201dThe three of them looked around to see if there were any other witnesses, and then put their heads together and spoke in a quiet voice.\u201cKeep talking. Is that real?\u201d\u201cYes. That\u2019s why I tried to stop Mr. Rudger.\u201d\u201cAre you saying that werewolf is no ordinary werewolf?\u201d\u201cI wonder if it really isn\u2019t a subject that someone deliberately created.\u201dIf that was true, it couldn\u2019t have been more serious. Leo also opened his mouth with a heavy expression as if he was thinking of something.\u201cI, too, have heard some news recently.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThere are suspicious people hiding in Theon.\u201d\u201cSuspicious people? What is that, some kind of secret organization? Isn\u2019t that just a secret club made by students or a rumor?\u201dThere was nothing special about Theon students having secret meetings.Leo shook his head at Tracy\u2019s question. If it was just that, he wouldn\u2019t even say that he was suspicious.\u201cI\u2019m not even sure. However, it seems certain that a secret organization that has not been revealed has infiltrated Theon. I realized this while watching the werewolf incident.\u201d\u201cWait a minute. Then there are dangerous people in Theon.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s still at the stage of doubt, but I think so. Aidan, do you think so too?\u201d\u201cYes. To be honest, it\u2019s not a good thing to doubt someone, but he definitely has something to do with it.\u2026\u2026\u201dAidan was about to say something, then shook his head and bit his mouth.\u201cNo, no.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIs it because of Mr. Rudger?\u201dAidan couldn\u2019t help but nod his head at Tracy\u2019s piercing remark.The reason why Aidan\u2019s heart had been heavy for a while was because of the radical behavior that Rudger had shown the day before.\u201cI don\u2019t want to suspect Mr. Rudger,\u201d she said, \u201cbut the teacher I saw last night was somehow suspicious.\u201d\u201cWas he suspicious?\u201d\u201cYou guys may not have been able to see it properly because you were behind Mr. Rudger, but I was facing him from the front. Mr. Rudger saw something.\u201dAidan didn\u2019t miss Rudger\u2019s reaction but before he could ask, Rudger forcibly removed him and set the werewolf on fire.Hearing Aidan\u2019s words, Leo bit his chin.\u201cThat means Mr. Rudger was trying to destroy the evidence?\u201d\u201cWhat? Mr. Rudger? Does that make sense?\u201d\u201cWhat kind of stupid thing is that?\u201d asked Tracy.\u201cIt\u2019s not certain. However, I keep thinking that Mr. Rudger might know something. The teacher at that time seemed desperate to hide something.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dMaybe it was an illusion. There\u2019s no way a Theon teacher would do such a dangerous thing. But what if it\u2019s real? What if Rudger Chelici belongs to a secret organization that is too dangerous to even talk about?What if the werewolves were actually killed to destroy evidence?\u201cAre you stupid? Anyway, you went too far.\u201dTracy rebuked the two, putting her hand on her waist and shaking her head.\u201cMr. Rudger must have had something in mind and when we met the president earlier, didn\u2019t you think something was strange?\u201d\u201cUh? what?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t feel anything.\u201d\u201cUgh\u2026Stupid guys. Do you remember what the president said when he praised us? She gave each of us a little bit of a hint that we did well and what we did.\u201d\u201cOh, right. I didn\u2019t even think of it because I was concerned about other things.\u201d\u201cThink about it. How would the president, who was not present at the time, have known that?\u201d\u201cUh, that\u2019s\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cOf course, someone told the president everything. Who could tell her what we did?\u201dRudger Chelici, was the only one who knew.\u201cMr. Rudger definitely saw everything we were doing. If he had tried to scold us, he would not have told the president what we did well.\u201d\u201cAh.\u201dHearing Tracy words, it certainly seemed that way.It is the same with the fact that only the president and Rudger entered the interview room, and when the president said that she would give them merit points, Rudger took a step back and made concessions.\u201cYou mean it was all Mr. Rudger\u2019s plan? Why?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know that either. Still, Mr. Rudger was considerate of us and only said good things to the president. To be honest, isn\u2019t it too far-fetched to be suspicious of Mr. Rudger?\u201dAidan and Leo had nothing to say, even if they had ten mouths.If Rudger was a dubious person, would he have taught them the groundbreaking magic source code from his first class?A person, who has to hide his identity, rather than trying to reveal himself, is contradictory.\u201cIs it?\u201dAidan scratched his head, but couldn\u2019t shake his subtle suspicion about Rudger.He\u2019s definitely a respectable teacher, but there\u2019s no denying that he\u2019s got something odd about him.\u201cYes. Tracy I think you\u2019re right. It is meaningless to even think about it right now.\u201d\u201cHuh. It\u2019s okay to know.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m hungry. Have you guys eaten?\u201d\u201cNot yet.\u201d\u201cTracy?\u201d\u201cWhy me?\u201d\u201cIf you haven\u2019t eaten, why don\u2019t we go to dinner together?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dAt Aidan\u2019s words, Tracy wondered if she had heard wrong.\u201cMeal? With me? Why?\u201dEmbarrassed for nothing, Tracy twisted her hair with her fingertips and muttered a little with his flushed face.\u201cWith friends\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cAre we already friends?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dSeeing Aidan smiling brightly as he looked at her, Tracy dyed her earlobes red as well. Leo, who watched the scene from the side, sighed and shook his head.It seemed that their Theon life would be eventful in the future.* * *\u201cAh! Mr. Rudger!\u201dOn my way back to my dorm, I met Selina who ran towards him looking more like a student than a teacher.\u2018Aren\u2019t you really lying about your age?\u2019\u201cAre you off work?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cI heard the news. Yesterday, I heard that Mr. Rudger caught a werewolf.\u201d\u201cYes. I took care of it.\u201d\u201cWow. Really?\u201dSelina-sensei looks at him with a burdensome gaze. Still, she\u2019s also a new teacher, but I think she\u2019s looking up too much.\u201cRecently, I\u2019ve only been hearing about Mr. Rudger. How did you catch the werewolf?\u201d\u201cWait.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a little busy today, so we\u2019ll talk about it later.\u201dAt my resolute remark, Selina nodded her head slightly with a pale face like a child scolded by an adult.\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry. You\u2019re busy.\u201d\u201cNo. Not to that extent. Selina, please rest well.\u201d\u201cYeah. Mr. Rudger too.\u201dI said goodbye to Selina and parted with her.Unlike other teachers, she is a good person who cares about me. However, I couldn\u2019t get close to anyone because I was in a difficult position.It\u2019s possible to eat together as a group, but that\u2019s all. And above all, I had one thing to do now.When I returned to my private residence, there was a parcel at the door. Having packed the parcel, I went inside the house and checked the contents.It was the material that Hans sent me, about areas where missing people and certain people gather in Leathervelk recently.After lightly checking the contents, I headed to my personal study. On one wall of the study was a map of the city of Leathervelk, along with pictures pinned everywhere.I cut out some content from the document and pinned it to one corner of the map, an area full of abandoned factories in Leathervelk that has a laboratory nearby.After finishing the work up to that point, I immediately took out a portable crystal ball.[Brother, have you checked all the materials I sent?]\u201cYes.\u201d[As brother told me yesterday, I checked the area. In an abandoned factory, about ten strong men rushed to and fro. I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s there.]\u201cRight.\u201d[And I checked out what you personally told me to find out. Some workers have recently gone missing on the outskirts of the city.]\u201cWas there a family of three among them?\u201d[There was. It\u2019s the only case where an entire family has disappeared. The police didn\u2019t do much research and let it go, but the neighbors should have been very anxious.]\u201c\u2026\u2026I get it.\u201dI left those words and cut off communication.After staring intently at the map fixed on the wall for a moment, I walked out of the dormitory wearing a dull brown coat, unlike usual.* * *The factory area of Leathervelk where even the light of the stars and the moon disappeared due to the thick clouds in the sky.The chimney of the factory, which stood tall without emitting soot, was itself a tombstone in memory of those who died in the shadow of the city. Considering that there are people who actually died in difficult circumstances, the term tombstone was not particularly wrong.The slum district, called the abandoned district, had no street lights, which gave a strong feeling of desolation. All he could see was a rat that quickly swept across the floor.Rudger arrived at the place where even the vagrants gave up begging and escaped.\u201cAre you here?\u201dHans, who had come first and was waiting, greeted Rudger.Hans looked at Rudger\u2019s walk and shook his head, sticking out his tongue. Although he looked casual on the outside, Rudger was already heavily armed.From the chill that was flowing from him, Hans felt that he was thoroughly prepared for the fight to come.\u201cAre you going alone?\u201d\u201cWill you help me if I ask for help?\u201d\u201cNo, I just wondered if you would be able to deal with them alone.\u201d\u201cAlone is enough. What about the guys inside?\u201d\u201cThere are about forty. However, these guys know that their feet are on fire and are slowly trying to escape. If I was only three days late, they would have disappeared.\u201d\u201cWhat are their powers?\u201d\u201cIt would be nice to see that even a trivial person has at least one gun. Well, my brother, who is a wizard, doesn\u2019t like firearms, but there are about three of them wearing reinforced armor.\u201d\u201cElite power?\u201d\u201cTwo warlocks.\u201d\u201cRight.\u201dRudger, who was about to head straight to the laboratory, stopped his steps and asked Hans.\u201cHans, the family I asked about.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cHow old was the child?\u201dWith his back against the wall, Hans looked up as if to recall something.\u201cHe was seven years old, such a young kid.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Seven years old.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The rust and stench everywhere looked real, but as soon as he went a little deeper, that changed.The inner wall became clean and even the stench that was wafting disappeared.Rudger immediately killed his presence and moved slowly.\u201cI\u2019m bored to death. How much longer do we have to stay here?\u201d\u201cWe still have more than two days left, so shouldn\u2019t you wait a little longer?\u201d\u201cI mean, why did those damned subjects have to escape?\u201d\u201cMaybe it\u2019ll be okay because they haven\u2019t caught the tail yet. They\u2019re trying to organize everything and leave.\u201d\u201cStill, it would be better to stand guard like this. It\u2019s crazy to organize the equipment inside right now.\u201d\u201cIf only those dog-like bastards didn\u2019t escape.\u201dRudger leaned his back against the wall, listening to their conversation. The two of them, who were bored of standing by the guards at the entrance, did not stop chatting.\u201cI was out then, how did that happen?\u201d\u201cThey must have made a mistake. It was said that the kidnapped kid didn\u2019t get his medicine well, so his cryptidization was incomplete. Maybe it happened because he was young.\u201d\u201cSo?\u201d\u201cWhen I pulled him out to give him more test drugs, resistance developed.\u201d\u201cI heard that medication is very painful, is that true?\u201d\u201cThe problem was that his parents interfered.\u201d\u201cWhat? Parents? You said they were already werewolves, but they were trying to protect their cub?\u201d\u201cYes. Scientists didn\u2019t even know that could happen. They did more than expected, and the inside was a mess.\u201d\u201cDamn. So did they escape? Isn\u2019t it a bit dangerous then?\u201d\u201cPooh! The risk is bullshit. Do not worry because someone they trust was asked to deal with them. Anyway, if he had been there then, those bastards would have been unable to escape. We would not have to suffer like this.\u201dRudger felt he no longer needed to overhear their conversation because he knew everything about how things went.At the sound of Rudger stepping on the stagnant water, the two men, who were chatting, immediately shut their mouths and stared in his direction.\u201cWho is there?\u201d\u201cMaybe rats?\u201dMagic lamps were illuminating around the entrance, but the place where Rudger was standing was relatively dark and invisible.The two pulled out guns from their waists but before that, two rays of light flew out of the darkness and pierced their foreheads. Without even screaming, the two men guarding the entrance collapsed from their seats.Rudger slowly walked out of the darkness. From shin-high leather boots, black pants, a gray vest with full pockets with a shabby brown coat over it. A black hood was draped over his face, reaching up to his nose, and covering his head.* * *\u201cAww! Help me!\u201dThe man patrolling near the entrance desperately ran away from the monster that appeared from the dark and killed all his companions.Like a mirage, he appeared out of nowhere and instantly killed all of his comrades patrolling with him.\u2018What did the bastards who guarded the entrance do?\u2019The moment he thought about it, his vision changed.\u201cUh?\u201dHis body leaned forward and fell.\u201cWhy?\u201dHe looked down at his legs and only then did he realize. His two legs were cut off under the shin. The moment I realized it, the pain came.\u201cAgh!\u201dHe clenched his teeth and glared at the darkness behind him. Beyond the huge passageway, all the lights were off and it was pitch black.There was the sound of footsteps. His back became cold and the hairs all over his body stood up.It was the intruder who suddenly appeared and killed all his companions, he\u2019s already been chasing him.The intruder slowly emerged from the darkness. He appeared through the black veil, and his identity was unknown because his face was tightly covered but looking at his strong physique, it was clear that he was a man.He warned in a trembling voice.\u201cDid you think you will be okay if you touch us? I don\u2019t think you know who you are, but you\u2019re dead.\u201dThe man had no reaction, rather, the eyes seen through the shadow on the hood became sharper.His lips were dry and his throat burned. The moment he was wondering if he should beg for his life, a large number of people rushed through the passage.\u201cOver here!\u201dHe saw mercenaries approaching this way with magical lamps from afar. They were all carrying firearms, and among them, a particularly heavily armed figure stood out.\u201cThis way! Hahaha! You are finished now!\u201dRudger thrust his dagger into the man\u2019s mouth. As he drew his dagger, blood spattered and his body fell to the side. It was at that time that the troops that arrived just in time discovered Rudger.\u201cThere! Shoot it!\u201dAs it was a well-trained force, they aimed their guns straight at Rudger without asking anything. Rudger, meanwhile, remained silent.\u201cShoot!\u201dThey pulled the trigger right away.\u201cUh?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dNo matter how hard they pulled the trigger, their bullets didn\u2019t go out. It wasn\u2019t that the gun itself was broken, it was that the gunpowder had stopped working.A cold sweat ran down the cheek of the captain who gave the order to shoot, he knew from his own experience.\u201c[Silence of fire]! A wizard!\u201dA considerable amount of time has passed since the appearance of weapons made of gunpowder as the world changed. But even so, wizards and knights maintained their positions with one of the best powers in this world.It was because guns were not a threat at all to knights and wizards. Knights with superhuman physical abilities could easily dodge or cut through ordinary bullets. Conversely, the wizards did not need to do that because the magic called [Silence of fire] made it possible.[Silence of Fire]Literally, it is a magic that suppresses the performance of gunpowder within a certain range centering on the wizard. Its power can be used to neutralize even machine guns when used by a 3rd-level wizard. If it is used by a rank 5 or so, it can neutralize cannons.If it was used by a Lexorer-class wizard of the 6th rank, the war would change from then on. Even when the age of guns and gunpowder came, the wizards and knights were able to keep their place.However, the magic that Rudger can use ended at the 3rd level. Then, Rudger realized that he could not go any further and made up for his weaknesses by strengthening his existing magic.When a normal 3rd-tier wizard uses [Silence of Fire], the maximum effective range is a radius of 20m. And the effective range of [Silence of Fire] used by Rudger was 200m.\u201cDamn it! Pull out the knives!\u201dThose who belonged to the Shamsus School were quick to judge. They threw away the meaningless firearms and immediately took out their swords and clubs and grabbed them.An electric current flowed over the clubs. Rudger looked up and raised his hands. In each hand he held a revolver.\u201cYou idiot! If you use [Silence of Fire], your weapons are useless\u2026\u2026!\u201dThe man who was laughing at Rudger fell backwards, blood spraying from his forehead.Everyone watched the scene with a pale complexion. What just happened?\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cHow\u2026\u2026?\u201dRudger shot him but it wasn\u2019t a bullet he fired, to be precise it was magic in the shape of a bullet, therefore was not affected by [Silence of fire].\u201cThis person\u2026\u2026!\u201d\u201cDid you want us to have an equal fight?\u201dRudger laughed at the soldiers and fired magic bullets at random.\u201cBang! Bang!\u201dBut even though it seemed like rough shots, his muzzle was aimed precisely at the forehead and blew off the mercenaries heads. Blood and screams erupted in an instant.\u201cYou idiots! Everyone out!\u201dA figure dressed in huge armor stepped forward. The reinforced armor made of black synthetic metal easily deflected the magic bullets Rudger fired. It was an external suit called reinforced armor made thanks to the development of engineering.Although the speed was slow, it was very sturdy and produced an enormous amount of power to be used exclusively against knights.\u201cDie!\u201dThe warrior in reinforced armor ran towards Rudger with his arms wide open. Rudger wasn\u2019t frightened and after retrieving the lifted revolver, he pulled out two crescent-shaped karambit daggers from his waist and held them.\u201cA wizard fighting with daggers?\u201dThe moment he stretched out his arm to almost grab Rudger by the neck, Rudger disappeared.\u2018What? Where did he disappear?\u2019The moment the man in reinforced armor was bewildered by the sight, a terrible pain ran down his forearm. Blood gushed out through the gaps in the armor.\u201cAww! What!?\u201dIt was because a dagger was pierced through the seams of the armor.\u201cHow? No, it was so fast I couldn\u2019t even see it\u2026\u2026\u201dThe moment he tried to move his left arm, there was no force in it. It was because something cold and sharp grazed past his armpits.\u201cUh, what\u2026\u2026\u201dThen it was both ankles.Before he could come to his senses, the tendons in both of his legs were cut off and he knelt on his knees and lastly cold steel touched his neck.\u201cLive\u2026\u2026\u201dRudger listened no further and cut off his throat with a karambit dagger.\u201cDamn it! Gabe died!\u201d\u201cMove! I\u2019m out!\u201dWhat came out this time was a slightly different form of reinforced armor. He was wearing brass armor that was more yellowish than black and white steam gushed out from behind his shoulders.A reinforced exoskeleton made from a steam engine. He held a giant barrel in both hands, and the tip of the barrel was connected to a large Tesla coil hanging from his back.\u201cDie!\u201dA purple current engulfed the passage. The high-voltage current of the Tesla gun, which cannot be suppressed by [Silence of Fire], spread in all directions.\u201cKah ha ha! How about this?\u201dBut he had to stop laughing.It was because the high-voltage electric current he had fired was not moving as if it had been blocked in front of Rudger\u2019s nose.\u201cWhat?\u201dNo, to be precise, it was seeping into a single piece of metal that rose in front of him. Was that metal magic with alchemy? Perhaps he was a wizard who handled metal among the elemental elements?The Tesla gun that fires high voltage does not work against wizards who use metal elemental magic. He realized that, but it was already too late. Rudger pulled out his revolver and shot. It hit the muzzle of the Tesla gun and it exploded.Electricity spread all over the place, and everyone nearby was charred. The only one who managed to survive, leaning his back against the wall, stared at Rudger, who was slowly approaching him. His half body was already charred and he was barely breathing.\u201cThis crazy bastard. Why are you doing this to us?\u201dHe asked that because he didn\u2019t understand, but Rudger didn\u2019t even respond and just passed him by.He couldn\u2019t survive in that state anyway, so he decided to leave him in the pain longer.\u2018How many people have I dealt with so far?\u2019About twenty people so only half are left inside. Seeing that they weren\u2019t coming this way, it was clear that they were preparing to fight him inside.Most of all, I felt the gaze. The gaze pierced through the cracks in the pipes that filled the wall.\u2018Is it black magic using worms?\u2019Hans said there were two warlocks inside. Some of the warlocks share vision with worms so they can explore hard-to-see areas. It\u2019s probably one of them watching him right now.\u201cWhoa.\u201dRudger exhaled lightly and lifted his right foot, rolling it lightly to the ground.\u201cTung\u201dThe sound of crashing the floor was heard and it became a wave that spread wide.* * *Inside the laboratory the scientists had no choice but to tremble with great anxiety.\u201cIs this okay? We need to destroy the data right away and get the experimental drugs\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cOh, it\u2019s okay because I said it\u2019s okay.\u201dIt was a blond man with a tattoo on his neck that stifled the ill scientist. His attire was also quite light, and he didn\u2019t even have a weapon, so it looked as if he was out on a picnic.But everyone knew that this man was the most influential warlock in the laboratory. The same goes for the tall, bald-haired man who was quietly standing next to him.The bald man\u2019s name was Veron and the blonde man was called Bruno. Although they were not related by blood, the two were called worm brothers.\u201cAfter all, there is only one opponent.\u201dBruno divulged the information he had discovered.Surprisingly, there was only one intruder. Only one person wiped out an army equipped with firearms and two people in reinforced armor alone.\u201cDamn, who\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWell, we don\u2019t know. Perhaps the Imperial Security Agency noticed us.\u201dAn organization made up of only the most elite of the Empire, they even had a knight order belonging to them, the Nightcrawler Knights.Of course, they are slightly different from the ordinary knights. The scariest thing about them was that their individual force was powerful, but they used any means and methods to achieve their goals.Although they\u2019re knights, they don\u2019t act as sternly as other knights. Rather, they thoroughly scrutinize the opponent\u2019s weaknesses, dig into them, and kill them. They can mercilessly kill even a three-year-old child if judged to be harmful to the country.\u201cThe way he fights is a little bit strange. I wanted to see more with the bugs, but I don\u2019t know what kind of trick he used, that all the signals from the bugs were cut off.\u201d\u201cMaybe he noticed that you were watching.\u201d\u201cBrother we need to prepare.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe older brother, Veron, got up and the men guarding the laboratory were also very nervous and raised their shields and weapons. They stared intently at the passage from the entrance to the center of the laboratory and got ready to meet the intruder.A strange wave swept through the interior of the laboratory, then all the lights went out and darkness fell.\u201cWhat?! Come on, turn on the lights!\u201d\u201cUse the reserve generator!\u201dSeeing the men moving in haste, Bruno turned to his older brother.\u201cBrother, I think he must have done his tricks.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cBrother?\u201dThere was no answer from Veron.Bruno looked at Veron and even in the dark, his bulky figure was clearly distinguishable by his silhouette but his head was cut off and rolled on the floor.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Brother!\u201dAs soon as Bruno saw that Veron\u2019s head had been severed, he responded immediately. Countless insects squirmed from the crevices of his clothes. Bruno quickly shook his head.\u2018He used sound waves and even metal.\u2019Attribute elements are divided into a total of 10.<Fire> <Water> <Wind> <Earth> <Wood><Lighting> <Metal> <Ice> <Dark> <Light>And unknown ones that have not yet been discovered.In the case of sound magic, it used vibrations in the atmosphere, so it was often viewed as a derivation of the wind element and when Rudger stopped the Tesla Gun, he used <Metal> attribute magic.\u2018Metal element is derived from the earth. Attribute elements that can be used usually consist only of similar series.\u2019Bruno judged that there were three elemental magic\u2019s Rudger used: <Wind>, <Earth>, and <Metal>.In the case of ordinary wizards, there are only two or three attributes that they could use.No matter how much ability they have, up to 4. From 5, it can be said that is the realm of innate talent. As a result, wizards basically set their opponents to three elements because that was common sense and it was natural.\u2018When it comes to the wind element, tiny flying insects are not good. If that\u2019s the case, then I\u2019ll have to release the big guy.\u2019He did not rule out the possibility that Rudger could use a fourth element, just in case.Protruding from Bruno\u2019s sleeve was a giant centipede with a thick carapace. It was a worm that was not found in the general ecosystem, but was created through black magic and subspecies hybridization with a special object caught in the southern jungle.However, the head of the centipede that Bruno pulled out was cut off in an instant. It took less than a second for that sharp sword to target his neck.\u201cWhat!\u201dBy twisting his body, Bruno was able to deflect Rudger\u2019s blade and block it. Hard scarabs were wrapped around his body, hidden under his clothes, like chain armor.\u2018A close-up fight? Maybe it\u2019s a war mage?\u2019Bruno immediately tried to distance himself from Rudger but at that moment, a formula was engraved on Rudger\u2019s face. Bruno\u2019s eyes widened.\u2018That\u2019s [Fluttering Flame]!\u2019The third-tier flame elemental magic, the fluttering flame, blew out intense flames in less than a second and engulfed Bruno.\u201cAww!\u201dWith Bruno\u2019s scream, a fire broke out and the surroundings became brighter. The soldiers, who had been staring at only the entrance, looked back and widened their eyes.\u201cThe enemy!\u201d\u201cHow the hell?!\u201dBut in the meantime, Bruno twisted his body in the scorching heat. Fire was the most difficult magic for those who deal with bugs.He was using an element completely unrelated to the other three. It was unbelievable.\u201cDamn, how can you?\u201dAll the bugs managed to survive, but Bruno\u2019s condition was not very good either. His face half melted from his full body burns, and he flopped down, staring at Rudger.\u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dInstead of answering, Rudger pulled out his revolver and blew off Bruno\u2019s head. At the same time, the reserve power was activated and the light returned to the inside of the laboratory.\u201cHuh!\u201d\u201cThe bug brothers are dead.\u201dThe soldiers who were in charge of the security inside were at a loss as they saw the bodies of Bruno and Veron. The soldiers lost their will, they couldn\u2019t fight a monster like that.Everyone backed away from Rudger in fear, but a change took place in Veron\u2019s corpse, which had fallen after his neck had been cut off.\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dRudger responded immediately. The moment he threw his body forward, a huge hand scraped through the space where Rudger had been a while ago. It was an insect\u2019s forelimbs, full of sharp thorns on a bare carapace.The other people who were watching the scene were stunned.\u201cIsn\u2019t he dead?\u201dRudger asked as he looked at Veron moving with excitement.After his head was cut off, Veron\u2019s body stood up again. What struck Rudger a while ago was his bizarrely deformed right hand. Veron held out his left hand, which was still in human form. The palm of his hand had a mouth.\u201cYou became an insect?\u201d\u201cSurprised?\u201dBruno dealt with bugs. Conversely, his older brother, Veron, was large and did not deal with insects. But then I wondered why they are called worm brothers.\u2018It was like that.\u2019Veron was a warlock whose body itself mutated into a kind of bug. Since such a body could not change naturally, he actually used his body as an experiment in black magic.Why Warlocks are crazy people, Veron gave a clear example of that.\u201cEven so, your head was cut off, but you\u2019re fine.\u201d\u201cMy body is no longer like a normal person.\u201dAt the same time as those words, Veron\u2019s body changed with a horrifying sound of \u2018Kudduk!\u2019The black robes surrounding his body swelled and then countless thorns popped out.Rudger stepped back. Still, the gigantic Veron turned even bigger and looked down at Rudger. He was a monster that looked like a mixture of several insects. At this point, Rudger couldn\u2019t tell if he was a warlock or a cryptid.[You killed my brother. I\u2019m not sad, but you have to take responsibility for that.]Veron\u2019s arms were being pulled back, and then shot towards Rudger like an arrow. Rudger immediately flew upwards using a wire launcher. Veron\u2019s stab passed almost under Rudger\u2019s feet, and the soldiers behind him were pierced instead.\u201cAww!\u201d\u201cRun away!\u201dEven though his men were screaming and dying, Veron didn\u2019t care. Veron lifted his head and looked at Rudger.\u201cKugugung!\u201dAt that moment, the steel structures on the ceiling collapsed and fell on Veron\u2019s head.Even though a significant amount of reinforcing bars had fallen, Veron remained intact. There were only a few scratches on his carapace, but no wounds.[Did you mean to draw my attention with something like this?]Veron turned his gigantic head and looked at Rudger as he rode the wire and landed on the ground. He was clearly provoking him, but Rudger didn\u2019t show much of a reaction.\u2018It bothered me.\u2019Veron\u2019s body was already out of the realm of ordinary bugs. With such a gigantic body, the carapace that wraps around it was also hard, so it was no wonder that it was actually called a monster that surpassed a warlock.\u2018That\u2019s why I hate warlocks.\u2019Rudger stopped firing the revolver and retrieved all of his weapons. Because he realized that even if he shot a hundred bullets, he wouldn\u2019t hurt him.[Are you giving up?]Veron laughed at Rudger\u2019s behavior, but instead he stretched out his hand towards Veron.[What are you trying to do?]Rudger\u2019s gesture of extending his arm toward him not only stimulated Veron\u2019s curiosity, but also aroused discomfort.Was he trying to use magic? However, it was virtually impossible to damage Veron unless it was a 4th rank or higher magic and he judged that Rudger was a wizard of the third rank.The speed of the magic unfolding was bizarrely fast, but that\u2019s all. He didn\u2019t think that such a Rudger would be able to deal a decent blow to him.Veron decided to wait and see what the intruder would do.\u201cI didn\u2019t want to use something like this in this situation.\u201d[Hmm?]\u201cWell, I can\u2019t help it.\u201dA pure white light filled the inside of the laboratory.* * *\u201cWhoops. It\u2019s still chilly.\u201dHans, who was waiting for Rudger outside the abandoned factory, trembled as he put his hands in his pockets in the still chilly night air.Thirty minutes have passed since Rudger went inside.\u2018The end is near.\u2019Rudger didn\u2019t try hard enough, but Hans realized he was a bit angry, after all, he did it himself.They kidnap a 7-year-old kid and his parents and use them as human experiments. No matter how dishonest he is, there is a law called \u201cgoodness\u201d that must be observed even for those who do such things. That Shamsus School crossed that line too badly.\u2018He\u2019s a little late. Is it because there were two warlocks?\u2019Especially if those warlocks were the Bug Brothers but Hans didn\u2019t think Rudger would die. He\u2019s known him for several years and if Rudger would\u2019ve died it would\u2019ve happened a few years ago, that\u2019s how strong he became.Wasn\u2019t he a human who hunted monsters in J\u00e9vaudan alone when he was working as a hunter in the first place? The number of knights that the monster ate alone was over five but Rudger hunted it alone.Rudger was not only the only hunter named \u2018Abraham van Helsing\u2019 he was also a private detective, a thief, crime consultant, mercenary, artist and so on.He had many faces, and the masks he wore in the past always made a big impact.Flash!At that moment a strong light that hurt his eyes was emitted from the entire abandoned factory. At the same time, the light turned into flames, turning the abandoned factory into a sea of fire. The terrifying power that blew up a large factory.Hans knew very well whose work it was.He once asked Rudger what it was and the strange answer he got was \u2018real magic\u2019.\u2018If it\u2019s magic, it\u2019s magic, what is real magic?\u2019Anyway, the fact that Rudger used it would mean that the opponent was formidable.* * *Rudger came out with the materials in the laboratory and the experimental drugs used on the subjects in a suitcase. Hans, who was waiting outside, greeted him.\u201cAre you here? Let\u2019s leave first. Even if the factory was abandoned because it was so flashy, the police will come.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s all taken care of.\u201dAfter defeating Veron, Rudger checked the depths of the laboratory. He saw the appearance of terrible subjects trapped in iron cages in the dark. All of them were ordinary people who had their own daily lives however, their daily life eventually fell apart.Those who suffer as their bodies mutate, lose their reason, and cross borders where it is difficult to call them human. The only mercy that Rudger could bestow upon them was to let them go without pain. So Rudger blew up the entire laboratory, killed the scientists, and left with their research reports and experimental results.\u201cIs this it?\u201dHans asked, looking at the tube with the red liquid inside the suitcase he had received from Rudger.\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThe world is very scary. There must have been some people in a place like this who did experiments on humans. I never imagined that scientists and inventors would have teamed up with warlocks.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not just that.\u201d\u201cWhat else have you found?\u201d\u201cHow do you think they hid a secret lab that big?\u201d\u201cThat\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThere is someone behind the scenes who has given them a huge amount of funding.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026I don\u2019t think that\u2019s normal.\u201dThey would need a large amount of money to build a laboratory like that without anyone else\u2019s knowledge.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Because I already know who they are.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dAt Rudger\u2019s answer, Hans felt uneasy.\u201cTake this.\u201dHans immediately accepted the suitcase.\u201cI will go to the hideout first. Stop by after work.\u201dHans left without hearing Rudger\u2019s answer.Rudger stood still for a while. From afar, the bright red flames from the burning factory lit up the dark abandoned factory area. It was like a candle burning most brilliantly just before it went out.* * *Inside a gorgeous mansion Richie Bellbot Rickson threw a plate of food brought to him by his maid. The maid hit by the plate fell bleeding from her forehead. The food on the plate stained her clothes and face but no one supported or helped her.The old man in his 60s, with a white beard growing tired of it, glared at the maid disgustedly.\u201cDid you serve this as food? It\u2019s like garbage that can\u2019t properly pay for it even if I give it money.\u201dBellbot got up and left, he was a man who stood out as a very successful capitalist in the changing times. But when he achieved success, he was an old man full of tiny wrinkles. In the end, he sacrificed his youth to get to this position.He wanted to get his youth back so he supported the warlocks in some kind of experiment. Recently, he heard that some of the subjects escaped and the experiment was disrupted.\u2018Damn! Stupid bastards! Garbage bastards!\u2019Bellbot was so angry inside and returned to his room.\u2018Still, the experiment wasn\u2019t meaningless. Sooner or later, the right results will come out.\u2019A drug that will restore a weakened human body to its heyday, the elixir of youth was not far away. It\u2019s not just about getting younger, it\u2019s about becoming healthier and stronger.Thinking like that, he was about to turn on the light in his large room that had been turned off.\u201cBellbot Rickson.\u201d\u201cWhat?! Who are you?\u201dThere was someone in the middle of the room. Bellbot tried to turn on the magic light, but something went wrong and the light wouldn\u2019t come on. In the darkness where even the moonlight does not enter, Bellbot was trapped in a room alone with an unidentified intruder.\u201cGuards! Security!\u201d\u201cThey can\u2019t hear you even if you scream.\u201dThere was already a sound barrier around the room, of course, since it is the house of a wealthy man. If he used that kind of magic, an alarm would go off right away but Rudger\u2019s magic was so secretive that he didn\u2019t activate the alarm magic.Rudger, who was sitting in his chair, got up and slowly approached Bellbot.\u201cBellbot Rickson, I will ask you one thing.\u201d\u201cWhat? Who are you? Reveal your identity!\u201d\u201cA seven-year-old child desperately tries to survive this horrific reality while watching himself and his parents become monsters.\u201d\u201cAww!\u201dRudger reached out his arm, grabbed Bellbot by the collar, and brought him close to his face. His eyes glowed red in the darkness.\u201cHow do you think a person who has no choice but to burn them to death even though he knows it feels?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Sorry for the irregular releases, I\u2019ll try to get back to the normal schedule from next week.Rudger still remembered that moment. Those clear eyes that looked up at him while licking his injured mother. Even though he used magic to kill them, he was grateful for that innocence.\u201cI don\u2019t know! How do I know! Who are you?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t know?\u201dRudger tossed the Bellbot Rickson to the floor. Bellbot, who was old and ill, fell to the floor and grabbed his waist.\u201cGreat. you, what are you?\u201d\u201cDo you know what this is?\u201dRudger took a pre-packaged test drug from his pocket and tossed it in front of the Bellbot. A red liquid that looks like melted ruby was inside the transparent glass tube.Bellbot who gave the instructions for it to be made couldn\u2019t ignore it.\u201cThis!\u201d\u201cNow do you understand?\u201d\u201cWhat do you want from me? Do you want money?\u201dBellbot realized his opponent caught his weakness. He was capable of sneaking into his own room, and he didn\u2019t know how he got it, but he even had a drug from an experiment he was involved in. Maybe he was from the Nightcrawler Knights?\u2018Damn! How the heck did those worm brothers do their job!\u2019He invested a huge amount of money into the experiment and now a stranger entered his residence but he couldn\u2019t show dissatisfaction. He didn\u2019t know who the man in front of him was but he was holding his lifeline.\u201cI won\u2019t hold you accountable for sneaking in but you must want something since you decided to see me in secret.\u201d\u201cWhat do I want?\u201d\u201cDo you want money? I have a lot of money and I can give you anything you want.\u201dBut the answer that came back from Rudger was far beyond Bellbot\u2019s expectations.\u201cAnswer.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cAnswer the question I just asked.\u201dBellbot shook his head as much as he could, trying to recall Rudger\u2019s question.\u201cWere you the one who got rid of the escaped specimen by any chance?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cSo it was you! I think there was a misunderstanding. Thanks to you, the situation didn\u2019t get much worse.\u201d\u201cJust answer my questions.\u201d\u201cOh, okay! That 7-year-old child test subject, right? What\u2019s wrong with that? He already became a monster, and he\u2019d rather die before being discovered.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t they low-class citizens who people don\u2019t even know that they exist? No matter how many of them died, what would be sad about that? Rather, they gave their lives to achieve great results, so they made a noble sacrifice.\u201dBellbot said they were making a noble sacrifice.Workers or the poor, how many of the lower class who roll in the mud of society die, what does that have to do with him?Rather, if they become a cornerstone for completing a drug that brings human youthfulness as test subjects they would at least contribute to mankind.\u201cEven if dirty people work in a factory for a hundred days, sweating profusely, how much money can they really make?\u201dIt was far more productive to use that meaningless life for something more important.\u201cIs the answer enough?\u201d\u201cYes. That\u2019s enough.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026\u2026\u201dRudger grabbed Bellbot\u2019s neck. Bellbot rolled his eyes and grabbed Rudger\u2019s forearm with both hands, but his hand was too strong to be resisted by Bellbot\u2019s old body.\u201cWhy?\u201dI answered correctly! Bellbot\u2019s eyes were protesting towards Rudger.Rudger did not answer, but instead placed the bottle of the drug he had brought in front of Bellbot\u2019s face and poured it into his mouth.Bellbot desperately tried to resist, but even that was impossible because his neck was caught.The red drug passed through Bellbot\u2019s throat. At the same time, changes began to take place in his body.\u201cAaaaaaaaaaaah!\u201dAlong with the pain as if it was being torn apart, Bellbot\u2019s body began to slowly swell. After Rudger released his neck, he retreated and watched the scene.As the time passed, his wrinkled skin became taut, and eventually split to the left and right, and his hair grew abundantly. But his changes did not stop there. The hair that had grown out fell out, revealing the reddish skin, and it started to swell like a bubble.Bellbot drank an entire bottle of the drug while the test subjects were only administered a small part of a bottle at once. The amount that Bellbot drank had already far exceeded the standard.\u201cOuch! Why! Why!!!\u201dEven as his body was torn, twisted, and changed, Bellbot couldn\u2019t help but cry out to Rudger. His face was strangely contorted and half mixed with that of a beast and from his throat came a cry that didn\u2019t sound human or animal.\u201cAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah\u201d\u201cNo matter what I say, you won\u2019t even understand, let alone repent.\u201dYou don\u2019t have to understand. Instead, feel the pain you inflicted on others. Rudger canceled the sound blocking magic he had spread out.\u201cTirriririring!\u201dAt the same time, an alarm in response to magical power went off throughout the mansion. After that, the screams of Bellbot, who had become a monster, reverberated.\u201cKwaaaaaaah!\u201d\u201cWhat is this sound?!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s an intruder! The alarm came from Bellbot-sama\u2019s place!\u201d\u201cThud! Thud\u201dA guard from outside knocked on the door. Suddenly, the locked door shattered and strong men rushed inside. Among them was a freelance mage hired to guard Bellbot.\u201cA monster!\u201d\u201cWhere is this monster from?\u201d\u201cEveryone get out of the way!\u201dThe wizard immediately performed fire magic and burned the monster. Contrary to its bizarre appearance, the monster caught fire so easily.Thanks to its tenacious life force his body regenerated as it burned and the process of burning it down continued. Even the wizard felt a sense of crisis and poured out all his magical powers to set off fire.An hour passed like that and the monster\u2019s body, which could no longer regenerate, collapsed.\u201cUgh. It\u2019s finally over.\u201d\u201cWhat about Bellbot?\u201d\u201cFind him.\u201dNo matter how bad-tempered he was, he was the employer who paid their salaries, so people were desperate to find Bellbot Rickson.However, no matter how much they looked around, they could not find Bellbot, and there was no trace of him. They had no choice but to come to the conclusion that Bellbot Rickson was eaten by the monster.At the same time they did not know that the secret safe hidden inside Bellbot\u2019s room, which contained his entire wealth, was stolen.* * *\u201cAre you here?\u201dThe hideout that Hans told me about was a shabby house nestled deep in the alleyways of Leathervelk commercial district.However, the only bad thing was the exterior, and when I went inside, there was no smell and the interior was very neat. It looks like an ordinary tavern from the outside, but it was just a trick.\u201cYou picked a pretty good place.\u201d\u201cIt is a commercial area adjacent to the factory area.\u201d\u201cWhat about the surrounding area?\u201d\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been confirmed yet, but it is certain that the ecology of Leathervelk Backstreet is quite complicated. We need more time.\u201d\u201cRight.\u201dRudger said so, and he put the safe he had brought on the floor.Hans\u2019s eyes widened.\u201cWhat is that? It must have taken a lot of effort to bring it.\u201d\u201cNot really.\u201d\u201cSo this is a safe?\u201d\u201cYes. It had magic security, but I unlocked it on the way.\u201dHans opened the door to the safe to check the contents, and immediately closed it.\u201c\u2026\u2026So many?\u201d\u201cSpend some of it on work and hide the rest in a suitable place for now.\u201d\u201cUnderstood. Are you going to go now?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cYou look a little tired, so go take a break. I also have a separate room for you.\u201d\u201cI will check it later. It seems that I will come back soon anyway.\u201d\u201cWith what kind of status will you come next time?\u201d\u201cThe thing that suits you best when you\u2019re moving in the underworld.\u201d\u201cOh, you mean that?\u201dHans didn\u2019t ask any more since Rudger must have been quite tired from today\u2019s fight.\u201cGet a good rest. I will try to finish my work as soon as possible.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dRudger came out of the hideout with weary steps. The air in the back alley, where people don\u2019t come and go, melted and stuck to the skin like glue.While walking Rudger could sense that people were watching him from beyond the darkness of a deeper alley. They hyenas in the back alley glanced at Rudger but withdrew, realizing that they were no match for him.When he was completely out of the alleyway, Rudger took off the hood over his head and pulled down the fabric that covered his mouth and nose.As he was still gazing at the Ramzier River, where some steamships were roaming, a loud bell rang out from the towering clock tower in the center of Leathervelk.\u201cDang! Dang! Dang!\u201dIt was the sound of midnight.Rudger continued to stare at the darkened Ramzier River.* * *[The death of the rich man, Bellbot Rickson]It was a headline that adorned the front page of a newspaper issued to the city of Leathervelk the next day.The death of Bellbot, a vicious entrepreneur and one of Leathervelk richest people, was enough to heat up Leathervelk. Even more so if his cause of death was from a werewolf attack.The monster was exterminated by the wizard who was guarding the inside of the mansion, but the death of Bellbot himself was quite a big issue.Some said that Bellbot had been punished, while others said that Bellbot used evil black magic and died because he couldn\u2019t control it. Reporters have been clamoring for days in front of Rickson\u2019s mansion to be let in.A black car stopped behind the reporters.\u201cYes?\u201dThe reporters stared at the man who got out of the car.There were a total of three people who got off, and they were all wearing the same outfit, black uniform with golden epaulets.The reporters\u2019 eyes widened when they recognized the attire that only authorized people could wear commonly referred to as a black coat.\u201cThe sheriff!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s also the Nightcrawler Knights!\u201dThe Sheriff\u2019s Office wasn\u2019t exactly a secret organization. On the contrary, it had a tremendous reputation in the bright field, and a terrible notoriety even in the shade.The reporters gulped their saliva.They came to the entrance of the mansion simply for the sake of gossip, but if the security bureau stepped in, the story would be different.\u2018Scoop.\u2019One word kept running through the reporters\u2019 heads.\u2018We won\u2019t be able to get inside anyway, so we have to write something related to the security department.\u2019\u2018If the security bureau stepped in, it means that it was a serious matter. Even that person at the forefront\u2026\u2026\u2019Cold silver hair that perfectly contrasts with the black coat with gold and red stitching in harmony. The woman with the sharp impression who turned it up to reveal her forehead was a very famous person.\u201cTrina Ryanhowl.\u201dThe head of the marquis Ryanhowl family, who symbolizes the protection of the empire. She belonged to the Security Bureau, and was the Knights Commander leading the Nightcrawler Knights. Her nickname is widely known as Lord Protector.The reporters quickly got out of the way as they saw Trina walking towards the mansion. With a sharp charisma, she was the idol of all knights in the empire.\u201cOpen the door.\u201dWhen the security bureau stepped in, even the guards guarding the entrance had no choice but to sweat.\u201cDon\u2019t let anyone in\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cDoor.\u201dTrina said, pointing her finger at the guard.\u201cOpen it.\u201d\u201cYes Yes!\u201dThe contemplative guard moved immediately.The gate of the Rickson mansion, which had been firmly shut, opened wide.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The police inspecting the scene of the crime saw her and saluted by standing upright.\u201cMarquis Trina! It\u2019s an honor to meet you! My name is Inspector Tevoran!\u201d\u201cOh, yes.\u201d\u201cMay I ask what the cause of Marquis Trina\u2019s coming here is?\u201d\u201cAs of now, all investigation rights into the murder that took place at the Rickson Mansion will be done by our Sheriff\u2019s Office.\u201d\u201cThe Sheriff Office?\u201dInspector Tevoran, with a long beard and sideburns, swallowed his saliva.He didn\u2019t think it was just a simple murder case, but it\u2019s had to be extremely dangerous if the security bureau came.\u201cSir, I\u2019m sorry! Everyone get out!\u201dThe inspector and his subordinates quickly escaped from the scene. What they had to do now was to stop reporters from the front door, who still had their eyes on what was happening inside the mansion.As their sight faded, the younger of the two lieutenants, a man and a woman who followed Trina, relaxed.\u201cUgh. I\u2019m bad at setting the mood.\u201d\u201cEnya, even if others don\u2019t see, act up to the reputation of the Nightcrawler Knights.\u201dEnya rolled her eyes at the nagging of Lloyd, who was scolding her.\u201cNo, old man. Anyway, there is no need to go all the way here.\u201d\u201cEnya, you\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cStop it, Lloyd. You just have to not show yourself that way in front of others.\u201d\u201cLook. That\u2019s what the manager said too.\u201d\u201cThis little thing\u2026\u201dLieutenant Lloyd finally shook his head and raised the white flag.The Nightcrawler Knights was a place where only the elite gathered like the knights that guard the center of the empire, but it was also a place where seniors and juniors talked comfortably among themselves. It was all because Trina, the commander of the knights, liked that kind of atmosphere. However, the rules were not loose.Above all, the fact that the discipline of the Nightcrawler Knights has not collapsed is proof that the current leader, Trina Ryanhowl, possesses great power and charisma.\u201cDo not forget why we came here.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dThis case was evaluated not as an ordinary case, but as a serious matter that even the Security Agency had to step in. In particular, in terms of the connection between cryptids and black magic, it was unusually serious because Trina, the commander of the knights, came out directly.\u201cAlthough it\u2019s still just a rumor, the dead Bellbot was a man on our security bureau\u2019s list of things to watch out for because of his suspicious behavior. The fact that he was suddenly killed by a monster cannot be considered a mere coincidence.\u201dLloyd and Enya nodded at Trina\u2019s words.The three immediately began exploring Rickson\u2019s room. Broken windows that looked like an intruder had entered and black marks that could be said to be traces of a dead monster. There was also blood, presumably belonging to Bellbot, scattered around.According to eyewitness accounts, a monster appeared and Rickson was murdered. Given that their statements are all identical and consistent, she didn\u2019t think they\u2019re lying.For more than 10 minutes, they moved in search of clues, but there was no sign of anything special. Lloyd was about to say something, thinking he had searched everything. It was then that Trina, who had been contemplating with her arms folded, suddenly strode towards a wall.\u201cChief?\u201d\u201cCome here.\u201dTrina stared at the pictures hanging on the wall. Bellbot, as one of the wealthiest people in Leathervelk, decorated his room with all kinds of colorful artworks.She came closer to the wall and touched the frame borders of the picture then she lifted it in the corner and set it aside.\u201cChief, what is that picture?\u201d\u201cThere is space behind it.\u201dEnya asked, staring at the empty space with curious eyes.Trina crossed her arms and said in a hoarse voice.\u201cGiven its size and location, it was probably the place where he hid a secret safe.\u201d\u201cA secret safe?\u201d\u201cBecause Bellbot Rickson was notorious for being a wealthy man and a vicious entrepreneur he must have evaded the eyes of the Empire and hid his black money.\u201d\u201cIs this the safe where he kept them?\u201d\u201cBut there is no safe.\u201dLloyd, realizing something about, opened his mouth with a heavy face.\u201cSomeone took it.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThen who took it? The users of the mansion? Shall we start with the most suspicious butler first?\u201dAt Enya\u2019s words, Trina shook her head.\u201cNo it won\u2019t make any sense. The butler has nothing to do with this.\u201d\u201cYeah?\u201d\u201cThere is no way a man like Bellbot would have entrusted his slush funds to anyone else. He probably hid it thoroughly so that only he knew.\u201d\u201cBut this place is empty.\u201d\u201cJust because he didn\u2019t tell doesn\u2019t mean people don\u2019t know.\u201dTrina also discovered this secret space right away.\u201cEntrepreneurs, wealthy people, and merchants all have the same thoughts. They\u2019re not very fond of opening an account in a bank. They always want to have a spot or gold coins within their reach that they can use right away. That makes them feel comfortable.\u201d\u201cThen who took it?\u201d\u201cWe have to find out. It\u2019s just a guess, but the person who stole the safe must have something to do with Rickson\u2019s death.\u201d\u201cBut everyone said Bellbot Rickson was eaten by a werewolf.\u201d\u201cI doubt it was a werewolf. Look at the traces that still remain. Nearly half the floor of this spacious room is on fire. It was burned by magic, so it did not spread into a fire. They say it was burned only with a precise range of flames, but it is still that size.\u201d\u201cThat is\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThe height of a werewolf won\u2019t exceed three meters. It is very large, but even if you burn such a being to death, the traces won\u2019t be of that size.\u201dAnd it is said that those who actually witnessed the werewolf mistook it for a \u201cmonster\u201d at first.\u201cThe result is that someone was involved in the death of Bellbot Rickson. Unnatural death, the appearance of a monster and even the bad rumors about Bellbot, there is still a lot left to check.\u201dWhat bothered Trina more than anything was the ability of an unidentified intruder to take the safe that should have been inside without leaving any trace.\u2018No way. There must have been a safe here. Until last night, too.\u2019The proof is that the floor has not yet accumulated dust. Even in an enclosed space, air and dust are bound to pass through.\u2018If so, who took it?\u2019This feeling of trying to grab a blurry mirage with her hands was not unfamiliar to her. She felt a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.A few years ago there was a thief who made the continent tremble. Blurred as if wrapped in the darkness of the night, his movements were so unpredictable that no one had ever seen his true face. The person who easily broke through any strict security and wiped away valuables without leaving a trace, making many rich people weep, Phantom Thief <Arsene Lupin>.\u2018Maybe that phantom\u2026\u2026 No, no. It\u2019s been a few years since he stopped working, but now he came back?\u2019Even if it wasn\u2019t him, she couldn\u2019t deny the possibility that it was an acquaintance, an accomplice or a disciple.\u201cLloyd.\u201d\u201cYes, chief.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t there anything unusual about the incident that happened in Leathervelk?\u201d\u201cUh, um. There was one thing.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cOne of the factories in the abandoned factory area has been burned down in a fire on the same day Bellbot died.\u201dWhat could have caused an abandoned factory to be burned down?* * *The werewolf situation that had made Theon and Leathervelk noisy came to an end with the death of a rich man. By the way, I was ill right now in my dorm room.\u2018If I had known this would happen, I would have prepared a little more. It\u2019s a good thing I don\u2019t have classes today, otherwise it would have been a disaster.\u2019Rather than my aching body, the subtle headaches are the most painful.Lying on the bed, I took out three pills and popped them into my mouth. Others may think of it as a headache or pain reliever, but this is literally a chewable mana potion that replenishes magical power.Usually, when it comes to recovering magical power, it is mainly to recover automatically over time or drink a potion but now, with the development of pharmaceuticals it became possible to grind the magic recovery potion into a powder and drink it with water, or to mix it with starch and eat it like me because powder or pills are easier to store and carry than to hang around with potions.In other words, the pill itself that restores magical power is not a very strange product. Now it\u2019s just the difference in how effective the same drug is. Therefore, what is important in pharmaceuticals is the efficiency of how well it works compared to the ingredients used.Effect risk and efficiency. Combining these three factors, the drug is graded from the best grade 1 to the lowest grade 10. The pills I am currently taking are my original recovery pills that I made myself.An item that maximizes the effect at the cost of slightly increasing the risk because of my \u201cbody condition\u201d. Because it\u2019s my special product that wasn\u2019t entrusted to clinical trials, a grade tag wasn\u2019t attached.\u2018The problem is that I used too much force. I always finished my battles quickly, but who would have known that he was a warlock who had changed his body in that way?\u2019Because of the older worm brother Veron, I had no choice but to use the \u2018real magic\u2019, not the magic of this world. It\u2019s not about magic or knowledge of this world, but magic with the occult and mythological knowledge of the world I used to live in.If there\u2019s a problem, it\u2019s that the aftereffects aren\u2019t a joke. The fact that I periodically take medicines that replenish my magic power was something I had to go through because I learned this magic.[\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501]The sound that kept tormenting me gradually fades away and then disappears. This voice can only be suppressed by using magic power, so I have become a constitution that consumes magic power even if I normally breathe. Therefore, it is necessary to periodically replenish my insufficient mana.\u2018It\u2019s a little better.\u2019As the headache subsided, another thought occurred to me. This werewolf incident was able to end once I took the initiative. Since they were all burned without a trace, there is no way to find any evidence.If there is a problem, it must have been an eyewitness at the scene.\u2018Aidan.\u2019A first-year student who stopped me from killing a werewolf.With brown hair that doesn\u2019t stand out that much, he has a pleasing impression but perhaps the greatest thing about him is his personality. It was a rare act to take a risk to protect a friend, or to take action on his own when he thought he might be in danger.To put it bluntly, he was like the main character of a boy cartoon-style game or novel.In the case of the students taking my class, I remembered them all, and Aidan in my memory was a model student who focused on my class with brighter eyes than anyone else.Unlike other people who learn magic as if they are being chased by something, he is a hard worker who enjoys learning because he purely likes magic. Such a guy witnessed the secret of the werewolf.If this was a game, it would probably be [Act 1]. The title \u2018The Werewolf of Theon\u2019 came to my mind.\u2018Maybe I\u2019m being suspected because I killed that werewolf.\u2019Fortunately, Leo and Tracy Friad, who were also there, didn\u2019t notice but if Aidan tells them, the story will change.How the heck did a freshman get caught up in an incident like this and approached the truth? It wasn\u2019t intentional, but things were twisted and turned like this.I put my hand on my forehead and brushed my bangs back. If things keep going like this should I kill him?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 36": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Academy\u2019s Undercover ProfessorCH 36Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayC36: Elemental Attribute Class (1)Contemplating whether to kill Aidan, I remembered him carefully approaching the werewolf, that stupid act of taking out a crude recovery potion, holding it, and smiling at the cub.Contemplating Aidan\u2019s life or death, I shook my head. If I had to deal with him, I could do it as carefully as possible, but I couldn\u2019t completely rule out the situation in which I was suspected.What happened to this situation where I became a teacher who got caught up in a terrorist attack while riding a train? In the end, it\u2019s normal for something completely unexpected to happen.There is something called the Black Swan Theory. When an event that was completely unpredictable occurs, it is analyzed by fitting the cause through the results, and in fact, it is claimed that there was a precursor to the occurrence of this event and that it could be predicted.It is said that post-mortem analysis is easy, but pre-investigation is difficult without realizing it.\u2018More than anything else, I can\u2019t touch Aidan even more since he got the president\u2019s attention through this incident.\u2019Of course, I was the one who suggested the president to give them a prize. But this was unavoidable. It cannot be denied that Aidan, Leo, and Tracy were present at the scene at the time.And in a situation where the president has not yet cast doubt on me, what would happen if I told her to punish Aidan thoroughly? Rather, secretly suggesting that Aidan be rewarded in order to make a good impression was a much better choice for managing my image.In fact, the president didn\u2019t like the aristocratic-oriented atmosphere of the academy, and was satisfied with the appearance of a commoner boy who played a big role this time.\u2018Besides, Aidan is a commoner, but he also possesses a rare [Unusual] type of magic.\u2019It is said that his master, who was a wandering wizard, taught him when he was young.Anyway, Aidan is a guy who knows how to use such unusual magic, so he has subtly attracted the president\u2019s attention. Touching Aidan is risky and suspicious.\u2018How about using Aidan?\u2019The same goes for the [Unusual] type magic he possesses, but I had a strong feeling that it was going to bring all kinds of events. If it were Aidan, I thought that he might even face the Black Dawn hiding in Theon.\u2018It\u2019s not bad, but I\u2019ll just keep the possibility open.\u2019I don\u2019t even know what Aidan thinks of me after that night, and no matter how much he learns unusual magic, he\u2019s still only a student.It would be better to watch him the next few days, or weeks. It will not be too late to make a judgment at that time.\u2018For now, let\u2019s focus on recovery.\u2019The voice had completely disappeared, but I still ached from the after-effects. I\u2019m worried about tomorrow\u2019s class, but based on my current situation, I\u2019m sure I will be completely restored by tomorrow morning.I thought so and closed my eyes.* * *Trina Ryanhowl frowned at the burnt marks. The site that used to be an abandoned factory was now left with nothing but black traces of what used to be a factory.\u201cCaptain. What can we check from this condition?\u201d\u201cNo matter how you look at it, it looks like everything is burned out.\u201dAs the two lieutenants said, the factory was completely burned down, leaving no clues or anything about the incident.Trina tapped the ashes with the tip of her boots.\u201cIt\u2019s strange. A fire breaks out in an abandoned factory where no one has come and everything in this area is burned down.\u201d\u201cDid they burn everything fearing that they might be discovered?\u201dAt the time she heard the news of the fire, she vaguely assumed it was something like this but when she saw the ruins where there was actually nothing left, she felt a bitter taste.Terry patted her chin to organize her thoughts.\u2018The death of Bellbot Rickson, the unidentified thief, the werewolf and the abandoned factory fire all occurred on the same day.\u2019All the pieces of the puzzle are in place, and a picture is drawn to some extent. However, there was a big hole in the center of the puzzle, which is the most important part. The culprit behind the incidents was unknown.\u201cLloyd, have there been any other incidents besides these?\u201dAt Trina\u2019s question, Lloyd pushed her rimless glasses over his face to the tip of his finger.Lloyd, whose hair was also neatly tucked into a pomade, had an appearance that was closer to a scholar rather than a knight. In fact, his main tasks were related to obtaining and organizing information and identifying incidents.\u201cThere was nothing special, but.\u201d\u201cBut\u201d\u201cI heard the news that a werewolf also appeared in Theon Academy.\u201d\u201cTheon Academy?\u201dNot even Trina knew about Theon.The Empire\u2019s best educational institution that trains wizards established with the full support of several kingdoms had a history and tradition that spanned hundreds of years.In particular, it was famous not only for the aristocrats and wealthy people, but also for the commoners and the lower classes, where anyone with ability was given equal opportunity.It is within the Empire, but a place that is freer from the influence of the Empire than anyone else.A werewolf appeared in such a place?\u201cYes. It appears that the Werewolf of Leathervelk entered through the sewer pipe.\u201d\u201cIt must have been a big deal for the students.\u201d\u201cFortunately, there were no fatalities. There were a couple of wounded, but none of them were life-threatening.\u201d\u201cWhat happened to the werewolf hiding in Theon?\u201d\u201cA teacher killed it.\u201d\u201cAs expected of Theon\u2019s teachers. What about the werewolf body?\u201d\u201cHe burned it.\u201d\u201cBurned?\u201dFor a moment, she thought that the teacher was related to the factory fire, but this must be an overestimation. In the first place, fire the elemental magic that can effectively defeat monsters like Cryptids.\u201cHmm\u2026.Theon\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cWould you like to go to Theon? We might get some clues that we might not be aware of.\u201dAt Lloyd\u2019s question, Trina shook her head.\u201cNot yet. For now, let\u2019s focus on gathering clues in this area.\u201dHowever, it seemed necessary to keep in mind that there might be something in Theon.\u201cSomeday I will find out.\u201dBecause she had to uproot the beings who are secretly hiding in the Empire and restore national stability. That was the mission and significance of the Nightcrawler Knights.* * *The classroom where Rudger\u2019s manifestation system magic is taught.The students who had gathered there kept talking among themselves about what had happened. Naturally, the topic of conversation was werewolves and Rudger.\u201cDid Mr. Rudger really hunt werewolves?\u201d\u201cHe said he was a soldier. I heard that he also had a history of subjugating Cryptids, which is probably true.\u201d\u201cWow. From the first day, I thought he was no joke, but it was true.\u201dIn addition, Rudger stopped the fight between Rene, a commoner, and Dunema Rommli, a nobleman. Even before the start of his first day of classes, the evaluation of Rudger among students was not so good.As Rudger\u2019s past activities were revealed, the evaluation improved, but there were still negative views. But the groundbreaking magic source code that he showed in his first class caused the students\u2019 evaluation of Rudger to change.The fact that Rudger was a new teacher and a fallen aristocrat alone was not only disappointing to the students who did not attend his classes, but there were also some students who tried to change their lecture hours and enter Rudger\u2019s class.It is said that even 4th graders, who will be busy preparing for graduation, applied for lectures late and were rejected. Even teachers were interested in Rudger\u2019s source code magic, and rumors have spread that the news has also reached the tower.Now, among the first and second graders, the name Rudger Chelici was known by everyone.\u2018Mr. Rudger\u2019s name is often mentioned.\u2019Erendir, who was quietly listening to the conversation about Rudger, recalled the appearance of Rudger that day. The man who spoke coldly about her princess identity. No, that attitude, which seemed to be oddly hostile to her, was definitely upsetting. No matter how wrong she is, what could she say?\u2018Besides, he was kind to junior Rene.\u2019At that time, the situation was so urgent that it passed, but now that she thought about it, something was wrong. There are people in the world who ignore a princess and take care of the commoners. Isn\u2019t it usually the other way around?Of course, that thought came to her as she watched the scene where Rudger was fighting a werewolf under the moonlit night. Just then, the back door of the classroom opened and a female student entered. Ash gray short hair with relatively long side hair, it was Rene.She shuddered at the burdensome gazes of some students who turned to her. Because of an incident with Dunema at the beginning of the school year, the aristocratic students hated Rene. As a result, she could not even make friends and was always alone.Seeing the almost full seats in the classroom, Rene was forced to go to the only empty seat in the end, the most burdensome place next to princess Erendir.\u201cHi junior Rene, how have you been since that day?\u201d\u201cErendira-senpai.\u201dEven aristocrats who wanted to make a connection with the princess and avoided the burden, and Rene, a commoner, was given the seat. As Erendir greeted her warmly, the gaze of some students had no choice but to become mysterious.What is that commoner doing now? When did she become so close with the princes?Rene had a hard time raising her head as the gazes on her increased.\u2018Why are you only doing this to me?\u2019It was her honest feelings that she didn\u2019t want to get involved with anything. What happened at the beginning of the semester was just an accident.After she did something wrong, Dunema was punished accordingly, so she didn\u2019t want to say anything more.Suddenly the front door of the classroom opened and all the students shut their mouths.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dThey all stood with their backs straight and stared at Rudger entering through the open door.The man was the same as they had seen the first day. His movements were restrained, and his steps silent. The only difference was his clothes. He wore a black frock coat and a silk hat over a gray suit on the first day, but this time he had a long white coat with a black suit on the inside.He wore a red tie and a long wine-colored scarf around his neck and didn\u2019t wear a hat. His sharp gaze and sculptural appearance were clearly revealed.The students were drawn to the sight and some of the girls stared blankly at Rudger with hazy eyes.\u201cClass begins.\u201dAt the same time as his words, the pile of papers that Rudger had brought scattered in the air. A total of 80 sheets of paper were blown away by the wind and landed naturally on the students\u2019 desks. It was a handout printed on a copy machine with the content to be taught today.\u201cToday, I will explain the basics and principle of <elemental attribute>, which is one of the specialties of the manifestation system.\u201d<Elemental attribute >, one of the four specializations of the manifestation system. It is the most important field for wizards, and it was also the most popular specialization that most people think of when they hear the word \u2018magic\u2019.Even though magic has developed in various directions, children still think of magic that evokes fire, water, ice and wind but that was just the basics that most freshmen who have just entered Theon have learned.When it comes to re-learning it, the students who were expecting a unique class were somewhat disappointed.\u201cBut this alone will not satisfy your passion and greed for learning. So today I am going to teach you a new method.\u201d\u201cNew method?\u201dWhen the students were all puzzled, some who had already taken the advanced course noticed what Rudger was trying to do.\u201cA way to increase the power of the elements that you can use from a minimum of 20% to a maximum of 80%.\u201d\u201cIs there such a thing?\u201d\u201cHow is it?\u201dRudger asked, scanning the classroom.\u201cAre you interested now?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 37": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Academy\u2019s Undercover ProfessorCH 37Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaySome students had bewildered faces.Rudger pointed to one of the students sitting in the front row.\u201cThe student in the front row. Anthony was it?\u201d\u201cYes teacher!\u201d\u201cWhich elemental attribute can you use?\u201d\u201cThat, that\u2026\u2026Water, ice and plants.\u201d\u201cWhich of them are you most confident about?\u201d\u201cThe ice element.\u201d\u201cThen, can you show the ice element right here?\u201dTo Rudger\u2019s words, Anthony answered yes and a magical sphere appeared in his right hand. The basic mana emission began, and the properties of mana were included in earnest.It was a pure white sphere. To be precise, it was close to a ball of snow that had been pressed tightly.\u201cIt\u2019s normal.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cYou sound like a no-brainer.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAnthony\u2019s face darkened at Rudger\u2019s words.\u201cLook at what I do.\u201dIn Rudger\u2019s right hand a magical sphere appeared. It was a mass of ice properties like the one made by Anthony, but something was different. No, it was still changing.\u201cDo you feel it?\u201dThe student did not respond to Rudger\u2019s words. He was just staring at the chunk of ice he had created as if possessed. The sphere Rudger created was much colder and sharper than his, and it felt like the perennial snow sleeping deep underground in the North Continent.Rudger compressed the sphere even more and turned it into ice crystals. The blue crystals blew a cold chill around, creating the illusion that the classroom itself was covered with ice.\u201cCan you see the difference?\u201dThe students still stared blankly at the place where the element was. Although it was the same ice element, Rudger\u2019s and Anthony\u2019s manifestations were very different.Did he use more magic power? No, the efficiency itself was different. And that\u2019s what Rudger was trying to teach them today.\u201cIs there really something different?\u201d\u201cHow did teacher do it?\u201dThe atmosphere in the classroom gradually heated up. There is no magician who would refuse anything that would make his magic skills better.\u201cOf today\u2019s two hours of class, 30 minutes will be about basic theories, and in rest you will learn how to increase the manifestation efficiency of your elements.\u201dThe students all focused on Rudger\u2019s words, with their eyes shining brightly.\u201cBefore we get into the principle of manifestation, let\u2019s get into the basics of <elemental attribute >.\u201dAll students glanced at what was written on the handout.\u201cElemental attributes are a specialization with a deep history and genealogy that even appeared in the manifestation system right after the release of magic.\u201dMagic can only be used with magical powers and primordial magic, a very primitive form of magic, is based on the manifestation of this magical power.That was the first specialization of the manifestation system, named <Magic release>.From the release of such magical power the <Elemental Attributes>, which contains the elements of nature in the magic, was developed.\u201cIt has now been established as a part of the manifestation system, but in the early primitive forms of magic, elemental attributes were called the basis of all magic.\u201dRudger said so and floated 4 magical spheres in the air.\u201cCurrently, it has been established to manifest the power of an element that matches one\u2019s own magical power through natural science, but in the early days of manifesting elemental attributes, we focused on the relationship between nature and humans.\u201dEach of the magical spheres began to take on one attribute.Fire, water, earth, and wind.\u201cThese are the first four attributes. Compared to now, when the number of attributes has increased to 10 or more, the number is very small. However, we cannot see this simply as an attribute. These four elements are not just pure elements, because they contain the symbolism people thought of in those days.\u201dEarth is hard and strong.Fire is powerful and destructive.Water is soft and acclimatized.Wind is freedom.The students listened to Rudger as if possessed. A theoretical teaching on origins should be boring but no one thought so.\u2018I already know this.\u2019Flora was dissatisfied with the content.After all, she knew the origins of elemental attributes, having to listen to what she already knew were terribly tedious and laborious. But even knowing this, she was humiliated by the way she was subtly drowning in Rudger\u2019s voice.\u201cSince then, elemental attributes have been developed and analyzed from a rational point of view rather than a natural symbol. The number of elements that used to be four has increased to ten.\u201d\u2018He keeps saying words I already knew.\u2019\u201cA conflict has arisen between the mystic school, which values tradition, and the natural science school, which seeks to further develop modern science by applying it.\u201d\u2018It\u2019s just that you have a pretty face and a good voice.\u2019\u201cIn the end, we have no choice but to adapt to the changes in the world. Not the teachings of the Order, but where to use the magic of nature.\u201d\u2018\u2026\u2026Still, it\u2019s worth listening to.\u2019Rudger, who removed the magic that was floating in the air, glanced around the classroom and asked a question.\u201cDoes any student know for what reason elemental magic has developed so dramatically? I\u2019ll give 5 points to the person who answers correctly. An example is the flame element.\u201dThe students immediately raised their hands.Rudger named them one by one.\u201cThere.\u201d\u201cIt is to light the light and drive out the darkness.\u201d\u201cWrong. Next.\u201d\u201cIt is to clear the forest by burning it.\u201d\u201cToo formal. Next.\u201d\u201cUh, um. Is it to get rid of the primal human fear of darkness?\u201d\u201cYou would be more suited to writing poetry.\u201dLaughter erupted among the students.Flora Lumos raised her hand proudly.\u201cYes. Flora Lumos.\u201d\u201cTo burn something to death.\u201dSilence lingered in the classroom because Flora\u2019s words were so direct and unconventional.\u201cCan you tell me exactly what it is?\u201d\u201cOf course it\u2019s a person.\u201dThe students rolled their eyes in a frozen state. Everyone in this room now had the same thoughts. Rudger is going to rebuke Flora hard but Rudger nodded his head.\u201cThat\u2019s right. Flora Lumos, you receive 5 points.\u201dThe eyes of the students rested on Flora and then turned to Rudger again.\u201cFor what did elemental magic develop? The answer is slaughter.\u201dAfter civilization was established and took shape, magic continued to develop. The hierarchy was divided, and the higher the magic hierarchy, the stronger the power and the higher the lethality.\u201cThe first target was a monster. However, even after the monsters were driven out to the continent of shadows, magic grew stronger. Why? Because of the cryptids. But there are very few cryptids so for whom was magic made stronger and sharper?\u201dMagic was developed to kill humans.War, colonial rule and violence were the driving force that further strengthened and developed magic. In the current era of peace those words were nothing short of taboo for the students learning magic.To compare magic history and tradition to something like murder meant that Rudger was just telling everyone here right now that they were pre-murderers but this was undeniably true. It was also a reality that wizards who value tradition deny.\u201cFire to burn, water to drown, wind to cut, electricity to support. Magic that developed along with human history grew with the driving force of war and slaughter. It is a truth that can never be denied. Yes. After all, the elemental attribute we learn is the Tower of Babel built on top of countless lives and corpses.\u201dRudger took a breath and continued.\u201cYou who learn it are the executioners of the slaughter.\u201d\u201cGulp.\u201dThe classroom was enveloped in silence to the extent that the sound of someone swallowing saliva echoed through the classroom. The subject Rudger was talking about was sensitive to all wizards, not just students learning magic.\u201cBut we can change.\u201dRudger\u2019s voice gently wrapped around the entire classroom.\u201cThere is no guarantee that this has been the case in the past and that this will be the case in the future. Now that the world has changed, fire is not only used to burn. Look at the back of the handout I gave you.\u201dCome to think of it, there was a handout handed out right away as soon as he entered the classroom but they were so focused on Rudger\u2019s teaching that they forgot.The students hurriedly turned over the handout and looked at the contents of the back page. There were crude pictures of various structures printed in ink. However, there was no difficulty in recognizing the picture itself.\u201cFire doesn\u2019t just burn, it provides energy with its burning power. In the cold, fire is a symbol of survival, not destruction.\u201dThe flowing water turns the water wheel, and the river that collects the water becomes a passage for countless ships.The wind drives the windmills to provide wind power, and the electricity itself replenishes energy and emits light.Water and ice wash away the heat in the blazing desert.\u201cAs we learn, the meaning of an element changes depending on how we behave in the future.\u201dRudger\u2019s voice echoed through the classroom.To make something, not to destroy it. Not to erase the world, but to lead it in a better direction.\u201cThat is the basic mindset you need to learn before learning the elemental attributes.\u201dNo one dared to open their mouths. It felt like a huge wave came crashing down and engulfed their body. However, what they felt was not unpleasantness, but rather a refreshing feeling as if something covered in their heads had been removed.Even Flora Lumos, with her mouth wide open, stared intently at Rudger.Rudger showed them a new world.\u201cStrive for a better world. The teachings of my elemental attribute are a lesson for it.\u201dRudger grinned at the students and came down from the pulpit.\u201cNow, let\u2019s start implementing elements in earnest.\u201dThe students gathered in the classroom started learning the elements in earnest. What element they are specialized in is to be learned fundamentally from the time they first learn magic.The children, who had been taught magic before entering Theon, used their magical powers without difficulty and covered them with their own elements.Rudger walked slowly through the classroom, pointing at the elemental spheres the students had made one by one.\u201cJoseph, concentrate the flow of magic a little more. The element itself is fine, but the release of magic power is inexperienced. Are you really a Theon sophomore? Don\u2019t be distracted.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cIrena Caroman, did you make a plant attribute now? The plant attribute should embrace the freshness of nature but yours is like seeing rotting leaves on the ground in late autumn. Keep your mind straight and make a strong image in your mind of a sprout that has just broken through the ground.\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026\u2026\u201dRudger never spoke kindly. Every time he threw a word, the faces of the students fell horribly but what was even more unfortunate was that Rudger\u2019s words were not wrong at all. Beyond that, his advice was far too accurate.It may sound harsh, but Rudger sees the weaknesses of his students, and at the same time provides a way for them to get better. His words seem to hurt their pride but when they meditate on them the students realize that Rudger is helping them. But even so, Rudger\u2019s Spartan teaching style is scary to young students.Every time Rudger took a step towards a student, that student was not able to properly manifest his attribute elements because they were concerned about Rudger.\u201cWhat are you doing now? Does magic look like a joke? If you can\u2019t stay focused, it\u2019s not even worth taking my class.\u201d\u201cSorry!\u201d\u201cBefore you speak, pay more attention to your magic. Close your ears and look only in front of you.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dEvery time Rudger passed by, the students\u2019 voices spread like ripples, forming harmony. Aidan, a commoner boy attending Rudger\u2019s class, broke into a cold sweat as he saw the teacher getting closer and closer.This was because Aidan had not yet been able to properly manifest his elemental attribute.Rudger stopped in front of Aidan. His sharp gaze turned to him, who was unable to do anything.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I asked him to stop at that time, but is he expressing his dissatisfaction subtly now?\u2018Looking at his reaction, it doesn\u2019t seem like that\u2019s the case.\u2019He doesn\u2019t know what to do. There\u2019s no way he\u2019s acting. In other words, Aidan doesn\u2019t really know how to manifest his elemental attribute, which can be said to be the basis of elemental magic.I can\u2019t believe it. The owner of a rare [unusual] type of magic can\u2019t do such a basic thing?\u2018How should I do this?\u2019I thought he was a promising player, but seeing that he is blocked in this part, it seems that he is not. Was it because of the special type of magic that he was allowed to enter Theon in the first place?\u2018Ignoring him like this would be the way to go.\u2019There is no need to take care of a guy who can\u2019t even follow the basic lessons. The more I do that, the more I eat up the precious time of the other students.Wasn\u2019t that something I said when I had the 1st and 2nd graders listen together in class in the first place? I have no intention of being considerate of a guy who can\u2019t keep up.It may be nice for me that Aidan, who may know my secrets, will fall behind in class on his own. Yes, I don\u2019t need to do anything. The world is, by nature, a cold place.* * *\u201cAidan. What are you doing?\u201dAidan closed his eyes tightly saying that it was finally coming.\u201cI, that\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t even manifest the elements. Are you going to rebel against me now?\u201dAll eyes of the students turned to Aidan and Rudger.Rudger frowned and turned to the students.\u201cHave the students who are paying attention to this area already perfected their element manifestation? I\u2019ll have to check it myself.\u201dThe students immediately turned their heads and began to focus on their elements again.Aidan was sweating profusely and didn\u2019t know what to do.Rudger asked, leaning back.\u201cAidan.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Yeah.\u201d\u201cHave you not been able to properly express the elements yet?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Yes. I\u2019m ashamed.\u201dAidan wanted to hide in a mouse hole. All the other students who came in were following the course content brilliantly, but he was lagging behind.Aidan\u2019s entry into Theon was also due to the fact that a kind of \u2018special exception\u2019 was applied, and the basic magic that other people could do basically was still lacking.\u201cWhat attribute elements can you use? Do you know that?\u201d\u201cFire, water and wind.\u201dI thought he would specialize in more elements just because he dealt with a special type of magic, but he wasn\u2019t. It is common knowledge that the more talented a person is, the more elements he can handle.\u201cThen I\u2019ll start with fire.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cI am going to teach you because I can\u2019t just let students fall behind from the first class.\u201d\u201cBut I\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI absolutely loathe having such a guy in my class. Disagreements are not accepted. Concentrate.\u201d\u201cAh yes!\u201d\u201cGather your magic. A basic manifestation should be possible, right?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dAidan nodded his head and created a sphere with magic. It was a basic manifestation that anyone could do if they learned a little magic, which could not be called first-level magic.\u201cThink of turning that magic power into an attribute. As I just said, it\u2019s a flame.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201dAidan looked intently at his magic sphere.Tracy and Leo silently gave Aidan their supportive gaze.However, no matter how focused Aidan was, it was difficult to properly manifest the fire attribute. At the moment when he wondered if this was the case, Rudger, who had been watching silently, opened his mouth.\u201cDon\u2019t overthink it and take it easy. No matter how hard you try to think of fire in your head, it is difficult at first. So don\u2019t just think with your head, feel with your senses.\u201d\u201cFeel\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cUse your senses. Picture the image of a blazing fire. Close your eyes and focus.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dAidan concentrated on Rudger\u2019s advice, and an image of fire came to his mind, however it was not easy.\u201cConcentrate. Relieve the moment when fire was the most intense in your memory.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dWhen he said that, he felt like he was holding on to something. Concentrating his mind, Aidan was able to slowly recall the most impressive moment from his memory.\u2014The feeling of burning firewood in a country house.His family watched the fire. At that time, the scarlet fire fluttered to and fro inside the hearth.Rudger\u2019s voice rang in his ears.\u201cNow think of the sound of fire.\u201dInstead of answering, Aidan followed Rudger\u2019s instructions.The sound of fire rising in the wind and the sound of burning firewood at the same time. The puzzles were put together one by one in Aidan\u2019s head.Rudger\u2019s voice was heard.\u201cNext is the sense of smell.\u201dAidan traveled to the depths of his unconscious. The pungent odor from burning firewood and the subtle scent of charcoal. Aidan\u2019s family used to cook stew over such a fire.\u201cYou have no sense of taste, so think of the sense of touch. It\u2019s about reliving the sensations you felt with your skin when you faced the fire.\u201dFollowing Rudger\u2019s guidance, Aidan created a picture-perfect memory of his past. The senses that were put together one by one vividly recalled the memories of the past.He recalled a memory from 8 years ago. One day during the cold winter a blizzard blew through the dark blue windows outside. Wrapped in thick clothes to avoid the cold, he put firewood into the stove to keep the burning fire from going out.His two sisters clung to him and whined that it\u2019s cold so the whole family sat down in front of the fireplace and ate together. His sisters chattered, his mother nagged, and his father smiled softly at them.He couldn\u2019t even eat fancy food, and a cold wind blew through the cracks in his clothes that weren\u2019t tucked properly. Clearly, the memory of that time is as vivid as it had just happened a moment ago.The fire was not hot and wasn\u2019t scary either. The flame he felt then was warm. He remembered being able to spend the cold winter comfortably.\u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d\u201cAh.\u201dAidan opened his eyes at the sound of Rudger\u2019s voice and saw a small sphere of flames burning in front of his eyes.\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dAidan widened his eyes as if in disbelief. It seemed to be like the flame that existed in his memory. It was warm rather than hot, soft rather than destructive.\u201cNot bad.\u201dAidan was stunned at Rudger\u2019s compliment. Rudger, who had only cruelly criticized the students who were called geniuses, praised him. He wondered if he could call that a compliment, but Rudger\u2019s words were positive.Most of the other students, who had pricked their ears, pretending not to pay attention, were astonished by what he said.\u201cThe flame is more than a normal element, it can be called your own flame. Rather than copying what others have taught and blindly manifesting that, you are expressing the fire element that you felt. That is your magic.\u201d\u201cIs this my magic?\u201dAidan stared at the sphere of flame he had created, like a man half lost in spirit but he lost his concentration and fire disappeared like a mirage.\u201cAidan.\u201d\u201cYes, teacher.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t forget that feeling.\u201dRudger left those words and moved to find the next student.Aidan still felt like he was dreaming. Leo and Tracy, who were watching anxiously next to him, tapped Aidan\u2019s arm.\u201cAidan, you are awesome!\u201d\u201cHow did you do that?\u201d\u201cUh, huh?\u201dRudger\u2019s praise for Aidan fueled the enthusiasm of the students who had not yet been evaluated. He glanced at those students and opened his mouth.\u201cAs you may have noticed, this is the method I was trying to tell you at the start of the lecture.\u201dAll the students pricked up their ears.\u201cThe application of the senses through experience.\u201dThe students waited for the next explanation at the words application of the senses.\u201cElemental attributes should be based on a basic understanding of the element. Even a three-year-old knows that fire is simply hot and ice is simply cold. If you are a true wizard, you have to put something special in it.\u201d\u201cSomething special?\u201d\u201cThink of the element you wish to manifest, not as a vague memory, but as an intense moment you actually encountered. Use not only sight, but the five senses to feel the elements.\u201dAfter following his advice, the students responded with joy from all over.\u201cWow!\u201d\u201cMuch better than before!\u201dThe students, who felt the joy of learning magic, focused more on not forgetting this lesson.Rudger\u2019s words were not false. By comparing their memories and experiences, they recalled the elements more meticulously and understood them, much more intense elements were manifested than before.Even the feeling of the element itself changed according to their experience and inclination.At that moment, a strong shout erupted from one side.\u201cOMG. Crazy. What is that?\u201d\u201cNested elements? Is she already using that?\u201dFlora Lumos was at the center of the place where the astonished gaze turned. She created an element with a confident expression. To be precise, it was a combination of two elements into one.Fire and ice.The shape of the blazing fire had changed to light blue ice but it was moving little by little, like a ripple. It was the so-called frozen flame.\u2018Huh. This is nothing.\u2019At first, Flora was planning to create only one attribute element in moderation. It was simply because she thought it would be enough to keep her from getting criticized by Rudger.She had already learned how to manifest elements through her five senses, and her unique magic Synesthesia made it possible to manifest the elements with a much higher degree of perfection than others.But when Rudger carefully taught a first-year kid, and even praised him at the end. Something hot jumped up in Flora\u2019s heart and her pride did not tolerate this situation.\u2018You\u2019ll praise me too.\u2019It is not enough to simply implement one element perfectly. She was Flora Lumos and even within Theon, she has never given up the title of genius.Wouldn\u2019t it be damaging to her self-esteem if her magic was only a single element? So she made two elements, fire and ice, which can be said to be opposites.Fire and ice can coexist if the two magic techniques are coordinated so that they do not infringe on each other and are weaved together. Their characteristics are merged and transformed into a new form.The nesting of elements that can be said to be an advanced level of <elemental attributes>.Flora Lumos could easily combine two elements but she suddenly got greedy. She thought that it was because she was in a strangely good condition and was in a high state of mind. Maybe if she were now, she\u2019d be able to achieve triple element nesting that she had never done before.\u2018Frozen fire. If I put the wind element\u2019s magic in it and make it swirl.\u2019Flora started making another new magic. Three overlaps of elements by adding one element to the existing two elements overlap. She never managed to do it before but she felt that could succeed now.When she imagined how Rudger\u2019s face would look after she succeeded she felt like laughing but it didn\u2019t take long for Flora\u2019s complexion to change.\u2018Uh, huh?\u2019Flora was the first to \u201csee\u201d with her eyes. The moment the three colors were about to blend beautifully, they suddenly lost their shape and started to collide with each other. That meant that the magic flowed in a direction different from her intentions and failed.\u2018No!\u2019In the end, greed turned to anger.The three attributes collided with each other, generating intense energy. Flora clenched her teeth and tried to restrain them, but it wasn\u2019t as easy as she thought.The magic that had already crossed the threshold was out of her control. As the three elements merged into one, they began to emit increasingly intense light.\u201cUh, huh?\u201dThe intense magic felt in the center of the classroom also made the students realize that something was strange.\u201cFlora! Stop it!\u201dHer best friend Cheryl, who was sitting next to her, shouted, but Flora couldn\u2019t answer. Biting her lips tightly, she could only desperately suppress the magic that was about to run wild. However, she began to lose control more and more.\u2018I have to stop it somehow!\u2019If this continues it will explode. In that case, with a determination not to inflict any damage on the surroundings, Flora surrounded herself with a magical barrier. Even if the magic goes wild like this, the magic storm will not spread outside.Flora tightly closed his eyes but at that moment she felt a warm hand.\u201cUh?\u201dFlora opened her eyes and Rudger was standing in front of her. He faced her, his hands gently clasping the back of her hand, grabbing her magic.\u2018How?\u2019Rudger, who came in after breaking the barrier of magic so easily, added his own magic and said,\u201cConcentrate, Flora Lumos.\u201d\u201cSir?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t give up, control your magic.\u201dFlora stared blankly into Rudger\u2019s eyes. There was no sign of fear in Rudger\u2019s eyes, even in front of the magical power that might explode at any time.\u201cI will help you.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The overlapping elements that were exploding in all directions gathered in a circle and gradually began to stabilize.When Flora saw the scene, she thought she was going to stop breathing. At that moment, Rudger\u2019s voice awakened her mind.\u201cIt\u2019s not over yet. Don\u2019t lose your concentration.\u201dFlora regained her consciousness and concentrated on manipulating her magic.\u201cIf you stop here, your magic will vanish without achieving anything. Can you accept that?\u201dAt those words, Flora clenched her teeth.The magic that was about to go astray gradually returned to stability, but if it stopped here, it wouldn\u2019t work either.\u2018Yes. I can\u2019t stop now\u2026\u2026!\u2019She couldn\u2019t let the magic she was trying to unleash disappear like this. Flora responded by squeezing out all of her remaining magical power. She had to perfect this spell now, even in order to live up to the expectations of Rudger who helped her.The three elements gathered in a circle gradually decreased in size, and eventually began to take on the form of something. Flora\u2019s eyes widened at the sweet scent that brushed the tip of her nose.\u2018Color.\u2019The color that had been scattered and ran wildly returned to its original position.\u2018No.\u2019Beyond that, it began to harmonize beautifully.\u2018Ah.\u2019With trembling lips, she stared at the magic that was embodied in front of her.The reason she challenged the overlap of 3 elements was because she wanted to get praised by Rudger. For Flora, innately gifted with her talent for magic, even the difficult, high-hierarchical magic was something she could eventually achieve someday. For this reason, Flora\u2019s magic was considered so easy and natural.She was not happy with her success but also did not dwell on failure. Because it was something she could reach naturally one day.She thought that even if she succeeded in what she had failed so far, she wouldn\u2019t be happy.\u201cYou succeeded.\u201dAt Rudger\u2019s words, Flora\u2019s voice did not come out.It felt like something was pounding in her chest. Her gaze was nailed to the finished element. A white wind whirls fiercely in orbits around a frozen flame like a sharp awl.She managed to combine 3 elements into one. Flora felt the illusion that her soul was taken from her beyond her gaze at the dazzling beauty that it gave off.\u201cPretty.\u201dSheryl, who was watching the scene nervously next to her, said so.Yes, the magic she wanted to create was as beautiful as a work of art. Flora\u2019s reaction was far more passionate than that of the other students.What excited her more than her vision and olfactory pleasure was a feeling of invigorating her spirit that bubbled up deep in her chest.She completed a magic that she has never done before and felt a sense of accomplishment that she had overcome a wall. Although she did not achieve this on her own, she could not deny this joy.The magic that had exhausted all its strength eventually turned into a splendid powder of light and disappeared. As he watched the scene as if possessed, Rudger opened his mouth.\u201cFlora Lumos.\u201d\u201cYeah. Mr. Rudger.\u201dFlora appeared calm but that was only on the outside.If Rudger had spoken words of praise here to her, she might have shed her tears from so much joy.\u201cYou have done something stupid,\u201d he said.\u201cYeah.\u2026\u2026Yeah?\u201dBut at the chilly words that came out of Rudger\u2019s mouth she realized what she had done. She almost endangered the entire student body in the classroom for her own greed.When she faced the reality she had forgotten about her joy of having succeeded in magic, Flora had no choice but to bow her head in gloom.\u201cAnyone can try new magic and fail but in the end, you have to bear the price of that failure yourself. Not the other students, but you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Sorry.\u201dWhat Rudger said was a hundred times right. She almost put the other classmates at risk. At the end she felt a sense of responsibility and surrounded herself with a magical barrier, but could she have completely stopped the damage with it?If Rudger hadn\u2019t come forward someone may have died.\u201cBut above all else, I rebuke you Flora Lumos, for the immaturity of your magic.\u201d\u201cYeah?\u201d\u201cWhen you first overlapped the elements, you mixed fire and ice, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cFire and ice are opposites to each other so it\u2019s hard to mix them together. Beyond making sure that they do not collide, you need to create a stronger effect by harmonizing them.\u201d\u201cYes, that is correct.\u201dAnd Flora Lumos did it.By mixing opposing powers, she embodied a single magic.\u201c\u2026\u2026How is my magic immature?\u201dThere was a mix of sadness in her voice. If he was just going to rebuke her, he could point out her overlapping of 3 elements but Rudger pointed out the perfect overlap of fire and ice.Flora thought that Rudger was trying to use her mistake as an excuse to devalue the existing overlapping elements.\u2018No, but still\u2026\u2026\u2019When she was in danger Rudger helped her control her magic or else she would\u2019ve died. There was absolutely no reason for Rudger to simply belittle her after helping her.Just as she was about to be disappointed, Rudger used his magical powers and created spheres of ice and fire.\u201cI will show you why your magic is immature.\u201dRudger merged the two elements he had created into one while adjusting the magic so that the magical powers of both attributes won\u2019t collide.Flora stared intently, not wanting to miss any detail. The whole process was obviously similar to what she tried but the results were not the same.\u201cUh?\u201dBecause the overlapping elements the Rudger created were different from Flora\u2019s.Flora Lumos compared the overlapping elements she had created herself with those created by Rudger. In terms of elements, there is no difference at all; however, the results produced by the two elements were very different.The energy of the overlapping elements was fundamentally different. Flora, who is particularly sensitive to magic, could feel it more clearly than anyone else. The color and smell were different from hers.\u201cFlora Lumos. Do you know what this overlapped element I created is like?\u201dFlora hesitated for a moment, then nodded her head.\u201c\u2026\u2026Yeah.\u201d\u201cThen please explain.\u201d\u201c\u2026 \u2026 The overlapped element you created has different wills of magical power. The spread of the flame and the power to engulf the surroundings, and the chilling of the ice attribute coexist.\u201d\u201cOn the other hand, what about yours?\u201d\u201cYeah?\u201d\u201cI asked you what about yours.\u201dFlora only licked his lips, but couldn\u2019t speak. In the end, Rudger opened his mouth instead.\u201cFlora Lumos the overlapping element you created is a magic that is only beautiful in shape, and has no practicality.\u201dAt those piercing words, Flora trembled.\u201cMagic must be practical. If not, at least there shouldn\u2019t be any magic without meaning. This is the base of all magic.\u201dRudger said to the students.\u201cYou need to use magic in a better way. Magic it\u2019s not about killing, it\u2019s about creating something that will lead the world in the right direction. But Flora How was your magic?\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cFrozen fire it\u2019s in the form of the ice element wrapped around the fire element. Yes, it\u2019s beautiful but that\u2019s all.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dFlora had nothing to say because everything Rudger said was true.\u201cAre you planning on getting a job in a circus with this magic? Or, were you planning on going to the Crystal Palace in the capital and displaying your magic in a beautiful way?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026It\u2019s not like that.\u201d\u201cThen what is the significance of your magic? Is it just a show off to show off that you can overlap elements?\u201dRudger\u2019s point was irrefutable. She didn\u2019t know where it can be used, it\u2019s just beautiful magic. She wanted to brag about being able to overlap elements, nothing more, nothing less.\u201cYou even tried to mix wind with ice and fire but in the end you failed.\u201dFlora bowed her head at the last wedge.Cheryl, who was sitting next to her, looked at her with a worried expression, but she, too, could not offer the consolation she would have liked in this situation.Rudger threw the magic sphere he had created into the air. The overlapped element climbed up close to the high ceiling of the lecture hall and exploded like firecrackers. For a moment, all the students in the classroom had the illusion that they heard the sound of ice \u201cburning.\u201dThe white frost-like cold air spread widely throughout the lecture hall without even touching the ceiling. It fell and melted away before it even reached the students.\u201cFlora Lumos combining 3 attributes was quite interesting. I\u2019ve never seen a wizard with that level of skill at your age.\u201dFlora\u2019s eyes, which had been taken away by Rudger\u2019s magic, turned to Rudger again. The moment she met the face of the man looking at her with regretful eyes she felt guilty, and her heart sank.\u201cBut the direction of your actions is wrong. I\u2019m not discussing your skills. We\u2019re talking about something much more fundamental than that.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t just use your magic to show off; this will lower your value, Flora.\u201dFlora had no choice but to agree with Rudger\u2019s words. He said that the magic she had created was just a gimmick to show off her skills and to win the praise of others. Conversely, what Rudger made was much more practical, even with the same elements as her.\u2018Again, I lost.\u2019She thought she would get recognition this time, but she didn\u2019t. Flora realized how impatient and immature he was.\u2018I\u2019ve never had anything like this before.\u2019Above all, the sincere gaze that Rudger showed her. It did not disappear from her mind. Rather than ridicule or despise, it was an attitude of genuine concern.\u2018Is there anyone who looked at me like this?\u2019There was no one. The gazes on her were always envy and jealousy. Not to mention her family, her brothers and sisters who hate her. Not only her classmates, but even her seniors were jealous of her and the same was true of Theon\u2019s teachers.Even after more years of learning magic, Flora\u2019s talent quickly caught up with them. Whenever this happened, the eyes of the teachers were always enveloped in unbearable flame-like jealousy.Flora knew it, but didn\u2019t show it. Because that\u2019s what her real talent was. There was no need to flinch in the eyes of those who were jealous of her talents.But today for the first time in her life, Flora was taken aback by Rudger\u2019s unfamiliar attitude.\u2018Mr. Rudger.\u2019He saved her, who almost failed her magic and helped her overcome the barrier of three overlapping elemental elements that had not been crossed before.Flora suddenly realizes that she is now dizzy and short of breath. She wanted to overlap 3 elements and consumed too much mana.\u2018I feel like I\u2019m going to die of exhaustion, but is the teacher okay?\u2019Rudger, who suppressed the exploding mana, would have consumed much more mana, but he did not lose a single breath.For the first time she felt the real \u2018wall.\u2019 And that wall was so high and thick that she wasn\u2019t sure if she could ever get over it. Still, she didn\u2019t want to give up.Flora felt good and made a strong promise to herself that next time she would definitely surpass him.\u2018Hmm?\u2019Rudger trembled involuntarily as he chewed the magic recovery pill he had hidden in his mouth.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 40": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Academy\u2019s Undercover ProfessorCH 40Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayC40: Flora Lumos (2)Chapter 3/3 for the week.Ever since I pointed out to Flora, I have been monitoring the condition of several students and giving them advice.\u2018It\u2019s not that difficult to tell.\u2019The manifestation of elemental attributes is the foundation of the basics. Some may think that it is easy and trivial, but there is nothing more important in < Elemental Attributes> than to get the basics right.\u2018Actually, I didn\u2019t even know the foundation would be so important.\u2019Elemental magic used by wizards is slightly different from simple elements that exist in nature. To be precise, the mana floating in the air is close to mimicking the elements with a strange power. Of course, if the world recognizes that \u2018imitation\u2019 as \u2018real\u2019, and is hit by fire magic, it burns.Naturally, things that cannot occur naturally, for example, the warm and cozy flame that Aidan created a while ago, can also be created with magical power. In other words, the element created by magic coexists in two contradictory terms, both fake and real.Elements created by such magic naturally follow the inclination of the wizard. The ice magic used by a cold and sober person and the ice magic used by a hot blooded person produce completely different results.A wizard who has more and more diverse experiences while wandering the world can put more diverse \u2019emotions\u2019 into the magic than a wizard who is confined to a room.After all, magic itself is close to putting human emotions into magic. Just like there are songs that have emotions in them and songs that don\u2019t. However, as the current magic unfolds only through theories and calculations, this method is very old and doesn\u2019t remain in the history books anymore.Perhaps it was written in an old and worn out book in the far corner of the tower\u2019s library. It\u2019s not that everyone doesn\u2019t know, but still, only a small part of it is known compared to the past.\u2018Even though Master originally taught me to maximize elements through the senses.\u2019This method was only taught to me as a disciple, but this insensitive disciple is now disclosing Master\u2019s tips to the public because he wants to live.I\u2019m sorry, Master. However, if I don\u2019t do this, my life will be in jeopardy. Anyway, magic is such a mysterious science.\u2018I remember the first time I learned it.\u2019When I first found out that magic existed in this world, I believed that I would become an archmage that would go down in history. The fact that I was reincarnated in another world was enough to make me hope.Of course, that dream was soon abandoned because I didn\u2019t have a great talent to learn magic. It\u2019s possible up to the basics, but that\u2019s all.It was virtually impossible for me to be a great wizard who will go down in history. So I had no choice but to change the direction of learning magic.Basically, my limit is up to the 3rd rank, and if I overdo it I can use the basic magic of the 4th rank.In terms of my level, I am at the beginning of the 4th rank and this is also my limit. I couldn\u2019t use more magic than that, so I chose to increase the quality of magic that could be used up to the 3rd rank.It was for that reason that the foundation was laid down. Above all, because I had memories of my previous life, I was able to look at magic with a slightly different perspective from others.For them, the scientific knowledge of the early 21st century was grafted into the procedure. Source code was a prime example of that.In addition to that, I received Master\u2019s spartan teachings, so I was able to confidently say that my basics of magic were more solid than anyone else\u2019s and the method I have been adhering to so far has shone in Theon.\u2018At that time, I complained about why I had to do this, but now that I think about it, there is nothing better than this.\u2019Perhaps magic using the five senses is a method not taught even in the Magic Tower. It\u2019s like a secret sauce for a restaurant that\u2019s only told to the important talents that are pushed from within by the schools and I said it in the open.In fact, the students were satisfied because there were noticeable changes or achievements.\u2018Still, I can\u2019t help but be vigilant.\u2019Overlapping elements is not simply merging different elements together. It is necessary to modulate the composition of the magic so that they do not collide with each other, but it is a dangerous thing that could lead to more serious consequences if mishandled.Therefore, when overlapping elements, those that are compatible with each other were often combined. Like water and ice, fire and wind, wind and electricity. However, Flora superimposed elements opposite to each other: fire and ice. However that alone was not enough and she tried to overlap 3 elements.I realized anew that Flora wasn\u2019t called a genius for nothing in this group of people.\u2018Even so, it would have been a failure.\u2019I desperately suppressed it, consumed too much mana and got dizzy. Fortunately, there was a magic potion that I had poured into my mouth beforehand, and I recovered quickly, otherwise I might have staggered in front of the students.That\u2019s why I didn\u2019t feel like I was scolding Flora a bit harshly. In the past, I was so confident in this new magic trick, but I was so broken by Master. At that time, I also did a lot of dangerous things, thinking that I would unleash some great magic.Flora\u2019s shrugged nose after successfully stacking two elements overlapped with my old self while learning magic from Master. That\u2019s why I pushed Flora a little harder. Belatedly, I thought I was a bit harsh but she\u2019s still a girl called genius, so I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll get through this.I decided to turn off Flora and focus on the rest of the students.\u2018Because this is Theon, I only give some simple advice, but everyone made good progress.\u2019There were a few students who stood out in particular. The first one was a brown-skinned schoolgirl with beast ears on her head that embodied an element that looked as if it had pulled up a vein that existed deep underground.\u2018Iona Obeli was it?\u2019I saw her on the first day. In the first place, she was the only benefactor in this classroom. She looked back at me to see if she felt my gaze. I simply nodded her head lightly to express that she embodied her element nicely.Was my behavior strange? She said \u2018ah\u2019 and opened her mouth. I ignored her and looked at her other students.Next was a blue-haired girl with her hair in two braids, wearing large, round glasses that covered half of her face who was manifesting the wood element. Her looks say \u2018I\u2019m good at studying\u2019, and she was a girl supported by the Alchemy School, who had a reputation for herself among the freshmen.\u2018Her name was Clara Harness? She\u2019s pretty good.\u2019In addition the twin sisters from aristocratic families that are quite famous in the Eastern Kingdom, and even newcomers who are supported by the tower. This rookie seems to have quite a rivalry with Flora Lumos.\u2018I heard that only amazingly great students gathered for this year\u2019s freshman year. I also came in at a very odd time.\u2019Can they be called the golden generation? At first glance, it seemed that Selena had heard that there are many such children in this first year and surprisingly, most of them are taking my classes.When I try to teach these good guys one by one, I feel like I\u2019m getting nervous.It was then.As the class was almost over, I found a student who was the only one who couldn\u2019t manifest an element.\u2018That kid.\u2019I was familiar with that striking light gray hair and heavenly beauty.\u201cWhat happened, Rene?\u201d\u201cAh. Mr. Rudger.\u201d\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d\u201cOh, no. That\u2019s\u2026\u2026\u201dRene hesitated to answer.Next to her sat princess Erendir. Have you two been friends since then? When I glanced at Erendir, she shook her head without saying a word.Eventually, Rene sighed and released her own magical energy, floating her sphere. She has the basic knowledge and talent for magic as long as she was enrolled in Theon.She was fine up until there, but the problem was next and I caught exactly what the problem was.\u201cIt seems that the element cannot be manifested. No. To be precise, the element itself does not exist.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Yeah.\u201dRene was a possessor of non-attribute magic that was said to appear very rarely.* * *\u2018Ruined.\u2019Rene was afraid that she was wasting her time for nothing. As she bowed her head, the clock bell rang in the classroom, signaling the end of the class.\u201cToday\u2019s class will end with this. Let\u2019s all review what we have learned today. The homework will be replaced by that. Don\u2019t even think about going overboard. I\u2019ve memorized all the elements you used today, so I\u2019ll check it out in the next class.\u201dOnce again, some students, who were delighted to hear that there were few assignments, hurriedly averted their gaze when they met Rudger\u2019s.\u201cThe guys who don\u2019t practice properly will get a kick out of it. I look forward to that time.\u201dThe students ran out of the classroom. Just as Rene was about to get up from her seat, Rudger called her.\u201cRene.\u201d\u201cYeah? Yeah!\u201d\u201cYou follow me to the office.\u201d\u201cUgh!\u201dRene swallowed her breath involuntarily.The remaining students looked at Rene with pity. In the manifestation class, elemental attributes are the most important specialization after magic release, but non-attributes are not like that.Perhaps he is calling her to advise her to look into other lectures because she cannot participate at the lecture properly. Although this is only the second week, Rudger\u2019s class has already been rumored to be one of the best in the world.In particular, his teaching, which strengthened the foundation of their elemental attributes, was enough to set a wedge in the students\u2019 expectations. Not being able to take such a class in the future was more than just learning in Theon and it\u2019s probably a loss of nearly half of her life.She wouldn\u2019t know if she didn\u2019t participate from the beginning but it was a different matter for her to drop out of a class she had already taken. Of course, most of the students were relieved that the subject was not themselves.Following Rudger\u2019s slow walk down the hallway, were Rene staggering footsteps\u2018Why did he call me? Maybe a personal interview? Is he trying to kick me out of class?\u2019Although she had only seen him three times, including the incident at the training ground the day before, Rene knew enough about who Rudger was.\u2018Ahhh! I\u2019m done.\u2019Rene got depressed for nothing, so she bowed her head. It was very painful that she had to change classes during the semester. She accidentally picked up a jewel on the way, and nothing would be sadder if she had to throw it back on the roadside.\u201cCome in.\u201dArriving at the office, Rudger opened the door with his nameplate on it and went inside. Rene entered Rudger\u2019s office with the spirit of a death row prisoner heading to the gallows.The interior itself was quite stylish and neat. Was it said that the place also resembles the owner? It was a space with an old-fashioned atmosphere like the man was.\u201cSit down.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dAt Rudger\u2019s words, Rene sat down on the sofa, completely frozen. Obviously, the leather of the luxurious sofa was too soft and should be comfortable, but Rene had no choice but to keep her back straight.Rudger sat down at his desk, opened a drawer and pulled out a pile of papers. Seeing that, Rene closed her eyes tightly.\u2018Ahhh! He\u2019s trying to send me to another teacher\u2019s lecture!\u2019Should I get on my knees and beg him to let me go to his class? But what if he would despise me even more?! At that moment when my head was spinning, a thin book was suddenly handed to her.Rene closed her eyes tightly and shouted.\u201cI\u2019ll do anything you tell me to do, so please don\u2019t tell me to stop taking classes! If I can\u2019t attend this class, I\u2019ll be in trouble!\u201dDespite Rene\u2019s desperate appeal, Rudger did not waver.\u201cWhat are you talking about? This is not about that.\u201d\u201cYes Yes? This\u2026\u2026Isn\u2019t this a course change application?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cWasn\u2019t it that I couldn\u2019t attend Mr. Rudger\u2019s class anymore?\u201d\u201cYou sound weird. Come on and get it.\u201dRene politely accepted the book Rudger had handed over with both hands.\u2018What kind of book is this?\u2019With that thought in mind, Rene, who looked at the title of the book, had no choice but to open her eyes wide.[Understanding non-attribute magic]The large letters on the cover of the book caught her attention.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Mr. Rudger? What is this\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cRead.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cIf you read what\u2019s there, you\u2019ll at least see a road you\u2019ve never known before.\u201dRene still didn\u2019t understand how this happened. Why did Rudger bring her to his office and gave her a book?\u201cIs this real?\u201dWith a look of disbelief, Rene stared intently at the title [Understanding Non-Attribute Magic].To her knowledge, her non-attribute magic is extremely rare, and she never used it in public. When she looked closely at the cover, the name of the author was not on the book, and there was not even a seal indicating that it was published.\u2018Isn\u2019t this fake?\u2019It was natural to have such doubts.\u201cIt is natural to doubt it.\u201d\u201cYes? Oh! Oh no! It\u2019s not like that\u2026\u2026!\u201dDid it show on her face? Rene hurriedly touched her cheek and controlled her expression.Fortunately for her, Rudger didn\u2019t seem to have any intention of reprimanding her for that.\u201cIt\u2019s okay to read and judge. It will be more helpful than not knowing anything.\u201d\u201cEven in the tower, there was no information about non-attribute magic\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cIs my source code a magic that existed in the tower?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dIn response to such a wonderful rebuttal, Rene bit her lips tightly. So is this really real?\u201cUh, where did you get something like this\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI was able to obtain it through a connection.\u201dAt that, Rene\u2019s head tilted slightly to her side. What kind of connection could obtain something like this book?Confused Rene asked Rudger.\u201c\u2026\u2026Do you, Mr. Rudger, also know anything about non-attribute magic?\u201dThe Rudger Rene saw was so natural that she had no choice but to think that he had acquired knowledge by actually experiencing non-attribute magic.If he was the Rudger who created the magic source code, she had the expectation that he might know something that others didn\u2019t know.\u201cI met such a person once before.\u201d\u201cOh my gosh. There were other owners of non-attribute magic besides me. So where is he now?\u201d\u201cHe is dead.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026.\u201dRudger\u2019s voice as he said that seemed to be somewhat remorseful, unlike usual. At least, that\u2019s how Rene felt because Rudger\u2019s usual cool and sharp appearance felt like a cotton pad soaked in water at this moment.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a thing of the past.\u201d\u201cThen, is this the last book he left?\u201d\u201cYes. It is the result of his research on his own magical powers during his lifetime. It\u2019s something that doesn\u2019t even exist in the tower.\u201d\u201cWhy\u2026\u2026?\u201dDid he not hand it over to the tower and gave it to Rudger? Rene couldn\u2019t keep up with that.\u201cBecause she wanted it.\u201dAh! She was a woman.Rather, what does he mean by she wanted it? Rene suddenly wondered who the other non-attribute magician was.\u201cBut wouldn\u2019t it be better for the public to hand it over to the tower?\u201d\u201cEven if you hand it over to the tower, a place full of greedy old people will not recognize this book. No, some will admit it and they won\u2019t show it to anyone else, they\u2019ll just keep it among themselves. It is far better to give it to someone who really needs it. So I will keep it until I meet someone who is worthy of this book.\u201dIn response, Rene looked at Rudger again.\u201cIf you read the book and work hard, you will surely find a new way there.\u201d\u201cThen, is there no way to learn magic of other attributes?\u201d\u201cAs far as I know, yes.\u201dAlthough she did not show it, she had a desire to use elemental magic that was as colorful and beautiful as her others.\u201cAre you disappointed?\u201d\u201cTo be honest, yes. Even just one element is good, so I wanted to use it.\u201dOthers deal with two, three or more, and talented people deal with five or more. Suddenly, Rene remembered what Rudger had shown her in class.Come to think of it, how many elements could he use? He showed fire, water, earth and wind, and even used the element ice at first. Then 5?\u201cOne element.\u201dIn fact, Rudger quietly pondered what she had said, not knowing Rene\u2019s heart.\u201cRene, you\u2019re saying it because you don\u2019t understand, but using just one element is never to be taken lightly.\u201d\u201cYeah? Wouldn\u2019t it be nice to use one?\u201d\u201cEveryone, to be exact, wizards have at least two innate elements. So, if you only deal with one element, what do you think will happen?\u201d\u201cUh, um. No talent?\u201d\u201cRudger shook his head.\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cA person who uses only a single element is a person with endless talent that is unmatched in that element.\u201dAs Rudger spoke, Rene opened her mouth in disbelief she could not believe but Rudger\u2019s words were not false.There were only a few of the wizards who could only use one attribute element. But they weren\u2019t weak because they couldn\u2019t handle other elements. Rather, it was more than that.\u201cRene, do you think the elemental magic used by a wizard can affect magic of the same attribute? For example, a sorcerer who deals with fire element suppresses flames.\u201d\u201cUh, isn\u2019t it normal?\u201dRene had that kind of common sense.Being able to use fire elements doesn\u2019t mean you can actually handle fire. It is also a factor that many people misunderstand. If you\u2019re a fire wizard, you can handle fire, so you won\u2019t be affected by fire.If it is a magician who handles metal, he can handle all kinds of metal, so why not show great power in war?That\u2019s wrong. The \u2018expression\u2019 of an element and \u2018handling\u2019 of the element are two completely different concepts.\u201cYes. Usually it is. However, there are wizards who are born with only one element. The magic they use is completely different from the elemental elements that ordinary wizards deal with.\u201dInstead of being unable to manipulate other attribute elements, they can \u2018control\u2019 only the elements they are using.\u201cA single attribute wizard known to the public is given the title \u2018color of the element\u2019 in the magic tower. They are all said to have reached the extreme of their element.\u201d\u201cSo this is what using a single element means\u2026\u2026.\u201dRene felt that her own knowledge was lacking, and her face reddened.How could even a single element be such a great wall? If so, does she really have to live like this for the rest of her life without being able to deal with the elements?Rene was terrified.\u201cRene, what do you think of non-attribute magic?\u201d\u201cUh\u2026\u2026Doesn\u2019t it literally mean that properties don\u2019t exist?\u201dRene answered.\u201cIf I ask a passing child about that, I will get the same answer.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Sorry.\u201d\u201cThe world says it has no attributes, but it is not clear whether there are actually no attributes in non-attribute magic.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cA typical example would be the magic of sound.\u201dRene opened her eyes and tilted her head slightly at the words magic of sound.\u201cDoes the magic of sound exist?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cBut sound is, precisely, a kind of wave that travels through the medium of the atmosphere\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cDo you think it\u2019s the same as the wind attribute?\u201d\u201cI just knew that.\u201d\u201cWrong. Wind and sound are completely different things. Although it is derived from it, sound is more precisely like a wave caused by vibration.\u201d\u201cUh, something else?\u201d\u201cEven if it is not air, the sound wave spreads through water. Then can sound be said to be a property of water?\u201d\u201cThat\u2026\u2026No.\u201dRudger asked again.\u201cThen what is poison?\u201d\u201cPoison\u2026\u2026huh?\u201d\u201cIt is a little more common than the so-called non-attributes, but even so, magicians who deal with poison are rare. Can the poison they deal with really be an element of nature?\u201d\u201cUh, um\u2026\u2026Similar to plants?\u201d\u201cThen what is the poison of animals?\u201d\u201cYeah, there\u2019s that too.\u201dRene explained poison from what she knew.\u201cUgh. In the first place, poison itself is a kind of self-defense created by plants or small animals to survive in an ecosystem, isn\u2019t it? Wouldn\u2019t it be a bit vague to call it an element of nature?\u201d\u201cYes. It is unreasonable to regard poison as a property of nature in today\u2019s era of chemical knowledge along with the development of science. But poison exists as an attribute after all. Magic itself corrupts and melts something. Otherwise, the decomposition property might have to exist.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cBut in the ten elements except for non-attributes, poison and sound cannot be included. Why is that?\u201d\u201cUh, is it because the number of people using it is small?\u201d\u201cIf you look at it that way, people with the magical powers of light and dark attributes also fall under that category. They are also rare cases.\u201d\u201cBut light and darkness exist in nature.\u201d\u201cThen I will ask. Rene, what is nature?\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u2026\u201dWhat is nature? What are the properties and elements implied therein? Nature? Isn\u2019t that the world? But is the world too inclusive? Then what about elements?\u201c\u2026\u2026Come to think of it, I don\u2019t think I can clearly define nature.\u201d\u201cOf course. Because humans cannot define the world in the first place.\u201d\u201cYeah?\u201dAt the words that were unlikely to come out of her teacher mouth, Rene immediately put on a stupid expression.Watching her open mouth, Rudger kept his relaxed expression and continued\u201cMagicians judge themselves to be rational and try to see the world by putting themselves within the framework of such reason.\u201d\u201cYeah, of course it is. In the first place, magic is the expression of mystery through human reason and will\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cFrom that point on, it was a stereotyped idea. Rene have a more free mind. When do you think the metal that exists among the ten properties now appeared?\u201dMetal was not even originally evaluated as an attribute element. Metal comes out of the ground and has been grouped together with soil as an attribute of the earth. However, as science advanced and all kinds of machines and tools made of iron became more and more popular metal was proudly added to the list of the 10 elements.\u201cIt is the same with ice. Ice is just a change that eventually happens when water goes below its freezing point. After all, aren\u2019t water and ice the same thing?\u201dHowever, in the end, the properties of water and ice are separated. The same goes for light and darkness.\u201cRene, you think of the magic that exists now as something perfect, with no room for improvement.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026.\u201dAt Rudger\u2019s words, Rene felt a lightning bolt hitting her head. Her shoulders trembled and her back stood erect. Up until now, she had thought of magic itself as something that could no longer be touched, something at a very distant stage. But is it really? Can magic no longer change?Rudger, noticing that Rene felt something, shook his head.\u201cI finally figured it out. A wizard should control magic, not be controlled by magic.\u201dRudger got up and walked towards the window. Through the transparent glass window, he can see the scenery of the Theon Academy, which will be responsible for the future of this era.\u201cThe world changes and, of course, we who are part of that world change too. It\u2019s the same with magic. Attributes that were initially four have now become ten, but those ten do not constitute everything. There may be unknown attributes that have not yet been revealed. It could be 20, 30 or even more.\u201dRene\u2019s heart was pounding when she heard him speak.\u201cThe same goes for the non-attribute magic you have. It is non-attribute now, but in the future, it may get a name as a new attribute. Not now, but definitely at some point in the future.\u201dAt those words, Rene saw a vague vision of something. She had nothing but a successful future in which she achieved great achievements in one field. It was the look she had dreamed of, and she was so dazzling that she unwittingly clenched her fists.Rudger looked away from the window and turned around.\u201cAh.\u201dRene, who returned to reality, let out an exclamation without knowing it. For some reason, the appearance of Rudger looking at her with his back to the light coming down from the window was very different from his usual coercive appearance.The man who was like a pillar of steel was nowhere to be found. Standing here was a seeker like her.\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid to be different. Don\u2019t be afraid of the unknown. Trust that you can become a pioneer that will go down in history.\u201dRene opened her lips to say something, but no voice came out.As if something heavy was pressing on her chest, even her thoughts were distorted and her words could not be expressed but it didn\u2019t feel tedious and painful. This was the greatest joy she had ever tasted.Rudger\u2019s words ripped open the precarious future she had been holding until now. No words came out but she still wanted to say thank you.\u201cSo, good luck in the future. Be sure to read the book given to you today. This is a personal assignment given only to you.\u201dRudger said so and created a light breeze. The wind gently wrapped around her body, lifted her up from her seat, and led her out of her office.\u201cAh, I\u2026\u2026!\u201dRene turned back and tried to say something to Rudger but the door closed before she could speak.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In her arms, there was a book about non-attribute magic that Rudger had given her. Even though she was lost in her mind, she instinctively felt that she had to treat the book as something precious.Rene, who was walking down the hallway at a rapid pace, stopped her steps when she heard a voice calling her.\u201cRene.\u201d\u201cUh, what?\u201dA soft and pleasant voice called her; it was Erendir, the third princess of the Empire.\u201cWhat is senior doing here?\u201d\u201cI was worried, so I waited for you since you\u2019ve been called by Mr. Rudger.\u201d\u201cYeah? It\u2019s alright hehe\u2026\u201d\u201c???\u201dErendir felt suspicious at Rene\u2019s strange reaction.\u201cRene. Maybe Mr. Rudger did something to you\u2026\u2026\u201dErendir didn\u2019t like Rudger\u2019s actions even before this. Probably because her first impression of him was the worst.During the first orientation, Rudger didn\u2019t even say what he was going to teach in his class. Because of that, there was a lot of talk among the students in <Akashic Records>, so it must have been disappointing.For her, with her values of justice, Rudger behavior was almost unacceptable. Afterwards, the content of his class was quite impressive, and she admired it, but that alone did not immediately dispel the bad perception that was ingrained in her at first.Rather, her attitude towards Rudger worsened during the werewolf incident so when Rudger took Rene to his office it was normal for her to have bad thoughts.\u201cNo way!\u201dRene hurriedly defended Rudger.\u201cMr. Rudger was just giving me advice\u2026\u2026! He never touched me! Mr. Rudger is not a pervert!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dHaving said that, Erendir was rather perplexed.\u201cI, I didn\u2019t mean to say that. Junior Rene\u2019s\u2026\u2026pretty sassy.\u201d\u201cYes?!\u201d\u201cI was just thinking that he would force you to take another class. I remember the relationship between a man and a woman\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cUh, huh? Come on, wait! Not like that!\u201dRene also realized that she had made a big mistake, and her face flushed red from embarrassment.At this sight Erendir started laughing.\u201cAhaha. Okay. It didn\u2019t happen that I was worried about you, so I\u2019ll take it that way.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Senior Erendir!\u201d\u201cSo nothing really happened?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cThen what is that book?\u201d\u201cAh.\u201dErendir found Rene holding a book she had never seen in her arms, and she pointed it out.What she did not know was that Rene was now handling the book with care as if it were something very precious.\u201cThis is from Mr. Rudger.\u201d\u201cMr. Rudger?\u201dRene nodded her head and Erendir opened her eyes a little in disbelief.She didn\u2019t know much about Rudger, but she never thought he would take care of Rene, since she couldn\u2019t keep up with his class due to her nature. She thought he was going to kick her out of class.\u201cYeah. He told me that learning this would help me a lot in following the class.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dErendir couldn\u2019t believe it even more when she saw Rene smiling bashfully. Rudger would do her this favor?Wasn\u2019t that man poignantly and cruelly pointing out the students\u2019 manifestation of attribute elements even in the previous class? Of course, that\u2019s all true, and she understood that it was a way to inspire motivation by touching the other person\u2019s self-esteem but Erendir didn\u2019t like it.\u2018For a moment, he seemed to have been particularly kind to Rene.\u2019When the werewolf attacked she remembered Rudger being rather harsh on her, the princess, and speaking a little softly to Rene. Of course, the memory at that time was slightly distorted due to a bad feeling towards Rudger, but the overall context did not change.If she looked at the fact that he called Rene separately this time and handed her the book.\u2018No way\u2026\u2026\u2019A word came to Erendir\u2019s mind but she didn\u2019t say it, instead Rene asked her.\u201cIs it possible that teacher likes me?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe thought that Erendir had been holding in her mind was actually brought out by Rene herself. Erendir shook her head as she pondered how to explain this.\u201cNo, that\u2019s not it.\u201d\u201cNo?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dEven Rene thought that she had said something that was not true but when she actually said that, she became suspicious.\u2018Mr. Rudger really doesn\u2019t like me?\u2019It sounds like she\u2019s proud of her saying this, but Rene was confident in her looks.\u2018Aren\u2019t I pretty enough?\u2019Rene actually had a beautiful appearance that drew the attention of even a few nobles. Her hair color is also a rare hair color, but the heavenly beauty that goes with it was enough to make Rene\u2019s name rise among the male students of Theon.Suddenly, Rene imagined the scene where she was with Rudger. She thought they would be a good-looking pair, but Rene hurriedly shook her head.\u2018Ah, anyway. Being with someone you don\u2019t know well yet\u2026\u2026\u2019Rene had a strong conservative personality in this direction.Erendir asked her carefully, seeing her blank face and then shook her head.\u201cHave you eaten?\u201d\u201cYeah? Oh no, not yet.\u201d\u201cThen do you want to eat together?\u201d\u201cAre you really okay with that?\u201dRene was so happy at the princess\u2019s suggestion, that she didn\u2019t know where to put herself. It was because she thought that if it was Erendir, there would be people waiting in line to eat with her other than herself.But that was Rene\u2019s mistake, Erendir had rarely traveled with anyone until now. Her status as a princess was great, but she was shunned by other students because it was so high.Occasionally, there were students from noble families who spoke to her, but they only contacted her for political purposes. They didn\u2019t come because they were purely in love with the person named Erendir. All they saw was that she was the third princess, she wasn\u2019t Erendir.\u2018Oh my gosh. It\u2019s the first time a senior has asked me to eat together!\u2019In the eyes of Rene, who was alone all the time because of the incident at the beginning of the semester, it reflected like the great mercy of seniors.Perhaps she thought Rene would refuse since her reply was delayed and Erendir said as she rubbed her blonde hair with her fingers.\u201cIf you don\u2019t like it or feel uncomfortable, there\u2019s nothing you can do about it\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cNo! I want to eat!\u201dAt this moment, Rene and Erendir have become friends that will eat together for the first time.* * *Having sent Rene back, I sat alone in the school office and remembered the meeting with her a while ago. It seems she doesn\u2019t know herself, but I do know what power she has.\u2018Non-attribute magic. It is not so surprising that the attribute itself does not exist.\u2019For me, it is a new form of magic that has not been discovered before because it has no attributes, and there was nothing new about it. Because magic has always been new to me.Since I was living in a world without magic, the magic that exists in this world has always given me a mysterious experience.Ironically, compared to the wizards who are residents of this world, I, who has the memory and knowledge of another world, perceive magic as magic differently.Today\u2019s wizards with a clogged mindset were isolated and stagnant in their lives but after being reborn I must say that my brain limiter has been released.Other wizards reaction when discovering new magic.\u2018-Non-attribute magic? There can be no such thing!\u2019But for me.\u2018-Non-attribute magic? In a world where magic exists, there could be such a thing.\u2019I reached the point of being flexible. Even my point of view was different from that of the wizards in this world, it was very different. Even that strict master stuck out his tongue in this area when he taught me.However, what I paid attention to as I looked at her was not the magical powers she possessed, but her eyes. Her non-attribute magic is only a part of her power she possesses. The real thing is her \u2018eyes\u2019.\u2018Those eyes. I think I saw her somewhere.\u2019My master had all kinds of old books that I can\u2019t find now, and the typical ones were books about monsters and demons that are hundreds of years old.There are no monsters except for a very small number of cryptids now, but it is said that in the past, this continent was full of monsters and even demons that controlled those monsters.I thought of Rene\u2019s eyes. Her eyes were pale blue however, while we were talking a while ago, I noticed that the color of Rene\u2019s eyes had changed subtly.Among the deep blue irises, a pure white light shone like the stars in the sky. Her eyes resembled the calm waters of the Milky Way in the night sky. There was no way I could not have been unaware of those peculiar eyes.\u2018An eye to distinguish between good and evil, the Judgment. Unless I\u2019m mistaken, Rene is the owner of that eye.\u2019The Judgment is an eye that distinguishes between good and evil in others, and clearly shows whether there is any hostility or not. A power that can\u2019t be called magic, but is literally close to a miracle and a mystery.The great thing about this eye is that it can reveal the appearance of \u2018demons\u2019 hiding in the crevices of humans.\u2018Now, those demons are only treated as legends.\u2019To people today, demons are just bad guys with horns on their heads and red skin that appear only in fairy tales. A product of lies to scare children, however, looking at the old books, it seems that they exist.\u2018In a world where magic exists, there must be demons. I also died and came back to life, isn\u2019t there something like that?\u2019And Rene\u2019s eyes had a lot to do with it.I have seen with my own eyes that the Judgment that only existed as a record is real. In other words, the existence of the Judgment that distinguishes demons determines whether demons exist or not.Another characteristic of the Judgment is that if it appears, a big event will occur regardless of the age. Fortunately, Rene\u2019s Judgment was not in a state of being fully awakened, and it seemed that she didn\u2019t even know that she had that kind of ability.But someday she will realize.\u2018Is this also a relationship after all?\u2019No wonder the book she wrote ended up with Rene.\u2018It hurts a little.\u2019It seems that she doesn\u2019t remember but one day she will.To think that I would find the owner of the Judgment eye and face a past relationship like this.\u2018To be involved in this kind of thing in Theon.\u2019I sighed and got up from my seat.I thought that if Rene can use the Judgment properly, maybe I will be able to find out all the members of the secret society who are hiding in Theon.In particular, the most threatening thing to me right now was the First Order, which is still difficult to identify.\u2018They are as vigilant as possible, but there must be something that I can find.\u2019As long as I didn\u2019t know where the first order was and what it was doing, I had no choice but to be as careful as possible. However, if Rene\u2019s Judgment works properly, maybe it will be of great help to me.Aidan and his friends plus Rene. If I cleverly use the power of these children, maybe\u2026\u2026After putting on my coat and opening the door to leave the office, I finally heard a creaking sound outside the door and had to stop.\u201cOuch.\u201dA blue-haired girl sat on the floor, clutching her head. Looking down at her, I spoke with a cold voice, contrary to my bewildered heart.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on here, Flora Lumos?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Why are you hanging around my door like a thief?\u201dAt Rudger\u2019s words, Flora jumped up from her seat and coughed, wiping the dust off her school uniform skirt.The forehead Rudger bumped into as he opened the door was still red and flushed, but she tried to pretend it was okay and opened her mouth.\u201cHmmmm\u2026.I came here because I wanted to ask you something.\u201dShe acted gracefully, but she couldn\u2019t hide the subtle trembling of her voice.\u201cIf you have any questions related to the content of the class, you can come to me anytime, don\u2019t wait outside like this.\u201d\u201cNo, not that. First of all, I would like to express my gratitude to Mr. Rudger.\u201d\u201cGratitude?\u201d\u201cI, that\u2026\u2026You saved me by stopping magic that almost went crazy.\u201dSo it was because of that. She came here to say thank you? As Rudger stared at her with a look of surprise, Flora was furious.\u201cWhy are you looking at me like that?\u201d\u201cIt is nothing.\u201dPerhaps it was because she had never expressed gratitude to anyone like this, so Flora was very awkward about herself. She felt something tickling her skin to say this, but she was determined to say it.\u201cThank you for saving me.\u201d\u201cI just did what I had to do as a teacher.\u201dRudger spoke so succinctly, that it seemed like he had no feelings of selflessness at all.Flora seemed fortunate, but it also strangely hurt her self-esteem. Still, since she came to apologize, she decided not to complain about the little things.\u201c\u2026\u2026I thought that what the teacher said was not wrong at all.\u201dShe rubbed the hair with her fingers and hit her feet.Rudger pondered what else to say and immediately realized what she was talking about.\u2018Use meaningful magic. Do not lower your value.\u2019\u201cI wish I had known.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Rather, are you okay, sir?\u201dAt Flora\u2019s question, Rudger asked, wriggling his eyebrows.\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cThe power consumption must have been great. I too was exhausted from suppressing my magic power, wasn\u2019t it harder for teacher than for me? The burden of helping people is several times higher.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201dRudger said so, but in fact, he almost passed out from the depletion of his magical powers.He had a magic potion that he had prepared in advance in case of any unforeseen circumstances, otherwise he might have collapsed in front of the students.He was fortunate enough to have a lot of medicine in case he would be short of mana. Of course, he ended up using almost all of the medicine he had prepared to stop Flora\u2019s magic.\u2018Well, I can make it again.\u2019This is Theon so there are places that teach pharmaceutical classes, and there is also a pharmacy room where teachers can freely enter in the research building.Since the pharmacy room, where he can make any number of medications you want, is equipped with all kinds of materials, it doesn\u2019t matter if the teachers just fill out an access list whenever they want and start experimenting right away.Flora wiggled her fingers and asked.\u201cHow many elements does Mr. Rudger handle?\u201d\u201cWhy are you asking that?\u201d\u201cYou talked about 5 in class. Isn\u2019t that quite a lot?\u201dRudger suddenly wondered why Flora was asking him so many questions. Most of the children called geniuses move on their own, and because of their strong ego, they don\u2019t have much conversation with others.Rudger thought that Flora was like that. In the class, he thought that she tried to combine 3 elements because of that reason.A student is still a student, right? She probably wanted to check the level of skill of the teacher who teaches her.Rudger pondered what to answer.\u2018Actually, I know how to handle almost everything.\u2019The 10 most common elements. Rudger knew how to use them \u2018all\u2019. He was the exact opposite of a single attribute wizard who achieved the ultimate in that element. However, for that reason, he did not achieve a certain level in any element.In the eyes of others, he may seem like an all-rounder with great talent, but in reality, Rudger himself evaluated himself as an incompetent bastard.\u2018Even so, if I say I can use every element it will be a problem.\u2019Among the wizards remaining in the history of the Magic Tower, 8 are known to have handled the most elements. This is the official No. 1 record specified in the <Wizard Book>, the history of wizards but now, Rudger has already broken that record.If this fact is known, the tower will probably be overturned once more and there will be chaos. A quick-tempered person might want to dissect Rudger alive. In fact, Rudger did not consider it unusual that he dealt with all of the ten elements.\u2018At first, Master didn\u2019t say anything good to me either.\u2019If I had to pick the person who had the greatest influence on me after I was born in this world, of course Master is number one. He is the one who taught me magic since childhood, how to live in the world, and other miscellaneous tips and knowledge.He took me as a disciple purely because he thought that I was unique and fun. Even considering that, I felt quite grateful to my teacher. However, since he was such an eccentric person, he only evaluated my source code as \u2018not bad\u2019.Naturally, it was his teacher who advised Rudger, who uses all the 10 elements, to say, \u2018you won\u2019t go anywhere with that kind of stuff\u2019.So, under the serious advice and teachings of his master, Rudger was never arrogant, even if he knew how to handle all ten elements.\u201cFive elements.\u201d\u201cFive\u2026\u2026Surprisingly a lot.\u201d\u201cIs that the end of the questions?\u201d\u201cI have one more question about the source code. Will the source code be taught to all the students in the class?\u201dIn the first class, Rudger deliberately showed the source code to attract the students\u2019 interest.He didn\u2019t stop at just showing. Rudger actually intended to teach students the source code. However, he did not properly explain to whom, how much, and when.\u201cNo, because this magic is like the bottom line for me as well. There are conditions.\u201d\u201cWhat are the conditions?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s something I will pass on to only the top five students.\u201dIn response, Flora smiled curiously.\u201cThat\u2019s few since the total capacity of the class is 80 people.\u201d\u201cBecause that\u2019s magic.\u201d\u201cWhat about the evaluation? Are you lowering it as a final evaluation of the semester? In one semester, the evaluation is divided into 4 parts in total. It must be difficult to make a decision as the rankings are constantly changing for each evaluation.\u201d\u201cI expected that to happen, so I devised a way.\u201dRudger immediately activated a magic trick on the palm of his hand.It could be seen as monotonous because it was made of only pure white magical lines, but the complex structure it created made it impossible to take this magic lightly.Flora also exclaimed softly at the color felt from the magic itself.\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u2026.a part of the source code.\u201d\u201cYou saw it right.\u201dRudger nodded his head.As Flora said, the magic technique he has now demonstrated is one of the main components of the source code.\u201cI call this <Framework>.\u201d\u201cFramework\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cSource code consists of a total of four frameworks.\u201d\u201cSo you want to give this framework to the top 5 on a quarterly basis?\u201d\u201cYes. The semester is divided into 4 parts, and each of the 4 frameworks will be delivered one by one. In other words, someone who doesn\u2019t consistently make it into the top 5 won\u2019t get the entire magic.\u201dThe students can\u2019t get the complete source code just because they got in the top 5 just once. If they want the entire source code the students will have to attend classes, submit assignments, and pass the exams well for a semester.Flora, realizing this, looked at Rudger with a slightly bewildered look.\u201c\u2026\u2026You are very calculating.\u201d\u201cI wonder if this solves the problem?\u201d\u201cBy the way, can you just show me this?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t this a framework? What if I analyze it?\u201dFlora pointed to the framework technique still floating on Rudger\u2019s hand.It\u2019s impossible for a wizard to keep revealing his magic so openly, unless he trusts the other person.\u2018Ah.\u2019Rudger realized his mistake. Wizards basically do not show the magic they have developed to others for a long time. They don\u2019t publish a thesis or submit a patent, because if someone copies their technique and claims it\u2019s theirs, it will be a headache.In fact, that often happens. It was for this reason that wizards thoroughly kept their arcane magic a secret.Rudger recognized his mistake, but he decided it was no big deal.\u201cDoes not matter.\u201d\u201cYeah?\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you see it.\u201dRudger knew that Flora Lumos is a genius and after seeing what she did in class today he realized that she\u2019ll take the first place.\u2018No matter what she does in my class, she\u2019ll get first place.\u2019Even if she doesn\u2019t, she\u2019ll be consistently in the top 5, so it won\u2019t be a problem if he shows her a framework anyway. If it were her, she would be able to learn the whole source code.\u201cYes?!\u201dBut Flora took Rudger\u2019s words differently.Her face reddened, and then she began to stutter her words out of nowhere, despite her usual arrogance.\u201cWhy are you so upset? After all, aren\u2019t you going to confidently take first place in my class and receive a framework?\u201d\u201cOh, no, but\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cStill, it\u2019s against the law to say that\u2026\u201dFlora Lumos replied in a low voice so that Rudger could not hear her. But as she thought about it, she couldn\u2019t stop her heart beating.Even if she pretended not to be blunt on the outside, the fact that this man was taking good care of her made Flora wince her lip and try to keep going up.\u201cThen I\u2019ll let you go.\u201dAs Rudger turned his back, Flora unknowingly called him up and stopped him.\u201cSir!\u201d\u201cWhat else? Do you have any more questions left?\u201d\u201cNo. That, ah, nothing.\u201dAs she turned around and saw Rudger\u2019s face staring at her with an unwavering gaze, Flora\u2019s face flushed red as if it was about to explode.Hearing those words a while ago, she couldn\u2019t possibly look directly at Rudger\u2019s face. Just the touch of his eyes made her skin tickle.\u2018Strange. I\u2019ve never had anything like this before.\u2019Rudger looked at Flora, who was bewildered and helpless, and then he turned his back on her and left.Flora, who had been staring endlessly at Rudger\u2019s back as he was leaving, finally regained her reason and calmed her excitement.\u2018Yes. Calm down Flora Lumos. You aren\u2019t like this.\u2019Wasn\u2019t she the one who always made fun of others with her own abilities?To Rudger, although she tried on the first day, she failed horribly, and she lost again this time but her will has not yet been broken.Didn\u2019t she promise to surpass him next time? Her heart should not have been weakened like this. Flora made up her mind to be weak.\u2018Come to think of it, I was going to ask what he was talking about with that commoner girl, but I forgot.\u2019Even if she pretended not to be, she was curious about why Rudger had called Rene separately.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 44": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Academy\u2019s Undercover ProfessorCH 44Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayC44: A Dangerous Bet (1)After all of the pharmacy classes taught by Marie Ross were over, Aidan immersed himself in magic practice, recalling the technique that Rudger had taught him in the last class.Next to Aidan were Leo, who was now a close friend, and Tracy, who had recently joined Aidan, and often spends time with him. The three of them worked hard to master the elements by embodying each element in the first training ground.\u201cWhoa. Almost done.\u201dAidan wiped the sweat running down his forehead, looking at the element of wind embodied on the palm of his hand.It was like the memory of the warm and cool wind that he felt while running through the wide fields in the countryside.He didn\u2019t know anything about the elements, so Aidan couldn\u2019t hide his excitement at the fact that he was able to manifest elements like this.\u2018It\u2019s amazing.\u2019The advice Rudger gave was practical enough so that nothing could be missed. Not only Rudger\u2019s advice, but also his attitude towards magic that he showed in class was enough to touch Aidan\u2019s heart.\u2018I wonder if I was mistaken to suspect Mr. Rudger back then?\u2019Rudger\u2019s words and actions are always cold, but in his voice it was evident how much he liked magic and how he truly considered it.There\u2019s nothing wrong with a person who likes magic.Above all, if Rudger was a bad person, he would not have been able to pass on to the students in class such a precious method that others did not teach.\u2018I don\u2019t know yet.\u2019Aidan vaguely sensed that he had something to do with Rudger. But that didn\u2019t mean he didn\u2019t feel that Rudger was a bad person. Maybe it\u2019s because his head got complicated because of those contradictory emotions but the wind element he barely manifested disappeared without a trace.Aidan, who had lost his appetite, looked at Leo and Tracy. The two of them were sweating and working hard on the manifestation of elements. It was because both of them were impressed by the warm flame that Aidan showed in the class.He didn\u2019t want to interfere with them, so he was just watching, and then, a group of students entered the training ground.\u2018These kids\u2026\u2026.\u2019Among some students, there was a person who caught Aidan\u2019s attention. Dark blue hair with a slight blue tinge, a neat hairstyle with a parted forehead that shows it. Conversely, white skin to the extent that it felt pale, a sharp nose, and sharp, narrow eyes stood out.He seemed to be a sophomore, with a natural quirk, and all the students gathered around him.\u2018Who is it? Noble students gather like that. He seems like a great person.\u2019As he was watching him like that, he turned his head and looked at Aidan. Their eyes met in the air and Aidan suddenly remembered what Leo had said.Did he tell him not to make eye contact for a long time and not even pay attention to noble students?Aidan wasn\u2019t stupid enough to say, Nice to meet you\u2019, so he naturally looked away. The other party didn\u2019t even point it out.Aidan had also taken a moderate rest, so he decided to focus on practicing magic again.\u201cWhat? Who is this?\u201dUntil one of the aristocratic students in the crowd approached Aidan with a loud voice.Leo and Tracy lost their concentration at the voice, and looked at their opponent. A male student with a mean smile was gazing at Aidan, raising the corners of his mouth.\u201cAh, you.\u201dHe was Jevan Pellio, the eldest son of the writer Pellio Nam, who had an argument with Aidan, but withdrew after hearing a bitter voice from Leo.\u201cWhy is he suddenly pretending to know you again?\u201dRecognizing him, Leo\u2019s expression rotted in an instant.Jevan Pellio, not paying attention to it, deliberately approached Aidan and the others as if to show off.\u201cAren\u2019t you, Aidan, who didn\u2019t even properly manifest the elements?\u201dThere was no way that Aidan and his friends could not know his heart.Leo replied with a cynical smile.\u201cWe\u2019re busy practicing magic right now, so why don\u2019t you go in that corner?\u201d\u201cSo it\u2019s that cheeky commoner from back then? After all, you two got along well, didn\u2019t you?\u201dLeo\u2019s gaze was over Jevan\u2019s shoulders, as he turned to the noble students who watched this situation with interest, especially the man who stood at the center of the group.\u201cSince there are seniors here, are you trying to show off your good side on this occasion?\u201dLeo knew very well who the senior at the center of the aristocratic students was since there were very few celebrities like that in Theon.Freuden Ulburg, the eldest son of Ulburg, one of the three duke families of the Exilion Empire, symbolizing the wolf.It was understandable that Jevan was suddenly arguing, he wanted to stand out since Freuden, who can be said to be the center of the noble students, was present.\u201cWe have no intention of playing with you, so get out of here. This is a place to practice magic.\u201dAt Leo\u2019s words, Jevan sneered.\u201cA commoner like you shouldn\u2019t speak to this body of noble blood.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s because you don\u2019t understand the situation yet\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cAnd I spoke to Aidan, so why would a little kid like you intervene at will?\u201dTo Leo, the words \u201clittle boy\u201d were close to abhorrence because Leo was short compared to his peers. Some girls liked Leo, but Leo hated being treated like that. For Leo, his small height was his Achilles tendon.\u201cYou\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cLeo, calm down. Just leave it to me.\u201dAidan stopped Leo from getting angry and stepped forward. At this rate, it seemed that the situation would not end.\u201cI don\u2019t know why you started this all of a sudden, but let it go. I don\u2019t want to fight with my friends.\u201dJevan\u2019s face contorted terribly at Aidan\u2019s words.\u201cFriend? Why am I your friend? This filthy trash.\u201d\u201cOh, weren\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cAre you crazy?\u201dJevan was annoyed by Aidan\u2019s stare.\u201cIf you are a commoner, you should bow your head in front of the nobles like a commoner.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what offended you, but I apologize. Sorry. So, can\u2019t you just let it go?\u201dThe boy who had never received any unprovoked hostility from anyone, but he did not want to bring himself into a fight.Jevan responded with a smirk to Aidan\u2019s words.\u201cGreat. Then I\u2019ll let it go, so just do one thing.\u201dThen he pointed his hand at his feet.\u201cKneel down.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u2026!\u201dTracy stepped forward.\u201cDo it in moderation. Do you have no shame as a noble?\u201d\u201cWhat? Why does a fallen nobleman intervene at will?\u201dAt those words, Tracy\u2019s face hardened.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIs embarrassing to even call you a noble, so shut up because that disgusting smell is going to come to me as well.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Do you want to die?\u201dFor Tracy her family situation was taboo of taboos but Jevan was careless with his words. When her magical powers overflowed from her body everyone laughed at her.\u201cYou don\u2019t have a proper education\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cJevan Pellio.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dIt was none other than Aidan who called his name. However, Aidan\u2019s voice was different from usual and made Jevan tremble without realizing it.\u201cI can\u2019t do anything about you being dissatisfied with me. If you\u2019re going to insult me I\u2019ll let it pass. But\u2026\u201dAidan strode towards Jevan. His eyes blazed with anger glared at him.\u201cI won\u2019t let you insult my friends.\u201d\u201cHahaha. What if I do? Great, then let\u2019s duel.\u201dAs if waiting, Jevan took out his white gloves from his pocket and threw them at Aidan.\u201cIt\u2019s a magical duel. If you\u2019re scared, run away.\u201dAidan shook his head as he watched the gloves hit his own chest and fell.\u201cDo I really have to do this?\u201d\u201cYou can refuse if you\u2019re scared.\u201d\u201c\u2026Great.\u201dAidan nodded.\u201cAidan!\u201d\u201cWhat the hell are you doing?!\u201dTracy and Leo wanted to stop him, but Aidan\u2019s intuition was telling him not to back down. He didn\u2019t even want to escape.\u201cGreat. The loser gets down on his knees and apologizes to the winner. Do you agree?\u201d\u201cIf you promise to keep your word.\u201d\u201cHahaha! Yes! If you can defeat me.\u201dEveryone was confident. Although they are said to be first year students of Theon, Aidan is a beginner who has not yet learned the basics of magic properly.Jevan, who has been learning magic from a private tutor since childhood, was confident of defeating Aidan. It was the moment when a fight was about to take place around the two of them.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dA cold voice strongly pressed the shoulders of all the students present at the scene.* * *I was patrolling. Although the werewolf incident is over, the patrol will continue for a while since the president isn\u2019t sure if something will happen.It\u2019s annoying, but somehow I can\u2019t help it, so I was just wandering around thinking about going for a walk to cool my head.\u2014And it took me less than five minutes to realize how easy accidents could happen.\u201cWhat are you doing now?\u201dSeeing the two students almost on the verge of a fight, I asked.I was a little annoyed, but I still have to listen to them before acting. Perhaps they did not know that I would appear, and some of the students\u2019 complexions turned white. Anyone who sees them would think that some kind of ghost appeared.\u201cYou two there. What are you going to do now?\u201dI asked, pointing to the two students at the center of this case. One of them was particularly familiar, and when I looked closely I realized it was Aidan, a brown-haired country boy.\u2018\u2026\u2026It\u2019s you again.\u2019Is his opponent an aristocratic student? I think his name was Jevan Pellio.I sighed.\u201cThe training ground is for honing your magic, but you\u2019re trying to fight each other.\u201dAs I approached slowly, the students who were nearby opened the way to avoid me. Strangely, I was taken aback by the way I was treated, but I decided not to care.Ignoring everything I said to Aidan.\u201cTell me what happened.\u201d\u201cThat, that\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cThis is a fair match!\u201dJevan shouted from behind me. I looked at him without a word.Is it because you think I\u2019m ignoring him? The guy was staring at me with courage, not hiding his anger.\u201cIs this a fair fight?\u201d\u201cYes. I\u2019m going to have a magic duel with Aidan, it\u2019s not a fight.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s funny that the first year students are having a magic duel.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it okay for first-year students?\u201dWhy is this kid doing this? What did he eat wrong? I was a little embarrassed when a guy normally wouldn\u2019t stand out spoke boldly and I could understand why.It was because of the other students standing behind him, as if supporting him. One guy in particular stood out.\u2018That guy\u2026\u2026.\u2019Looking at the subordinates he has around him, he is considered a captain. He also looked at me and gave me a slightly puzzled look.\u2018It was a confrontation between commoners and aristocrats in the first training ground. This situation is somehow familiar.\u2019Somehow I thought it was familiar, but it was the same as the last fight between Rene and Dunema. However, in the case of Rene, it was a surprise attack, and this time, it seems they were trying to fight each other.I have a headache.Well, boys fight each other. Even in a world like this, it\u2019s not strange, but why does something like this happen when I\u2019m on patrol? One of them is even Aidan, whom I had been keeping an eye on for a long time.\u201cJevan Pellio and Aidan, I have no intention of holding you accountable for something that hasn\u2019t happened yet. So, all of you go back to the dormitory.\u201d\u201cMr. Rudger!\u201d\u201cI told you to go back.\u201dAs he stared at him strongly, I wondered if he would challenge the authority of the teacher head-on, since he has the noble faction on his back.\u201cJust leave it alone.\u201dA new voice was heard. The eyes of the students turned to the entrance opposite the one I entered. There I saw a man approaching and staring at me.\u201cMr. Chris.\u201dThis time, it was Chris Benimore, a new teacher who joined Theon with me and belonged to the noble faction.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 45": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Academy\u2019s Undercover ProfessorCH 45Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayC45: A Dangerous Bet (2)The atmosphere was changed by Chris Benimore\u2019s appearance. In particular, the reaction of the noble students was hot, and the reason was simple. This is because Chris Benimore comes from a noble family and was a teacher who pushed other noble students from behind.Rudger stared at him and opened his mouth.\u201cMr. Chris Benimore. I do not understand what you are saying.\u201d\u201cIt will not be difficult. Literally.\u201d\u201cLiterally?\u201d\u201cEven if we are teachers, we cannot control all the behaviors of our students. Listening to the story, it seems that both students are arbitrarily trying to compete. Isn\u2019t it too much of a violation of freedom for a teacher to step in and stop it?\u201dAt Chris\u2019 smirk, Rudger\u2019s eyebrows twitched slightly, but that was only for a moment.Rudger glanced at the mood of the other students. Looking at the reactions, he could see some students nodding their heads at Chris\u2019 words. It would be an abuse to interfere since the students want to compete.\u2018I made a mistake.\u2019Chris Benimore is a teacher who favors noble students. His appearance boosted the students\u2019 momentum considerably so Rudger decided to take a step back.\u201cEven so, it is problematic for students to engage in magic duels without the teacher\u2019s permission. If students are seriously injured, it is also a loss for Theon.\u201d\u201cOf course it is. But how about doing this?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThe two of us will observe.\u201dAt Chris\u2019 words, the students murmured.\u201cWill Mr. Rudger and Mr. Chris supervise the duel?\u201dJust imagining it makes my heart ache with the burden.Some students were perplexed, but the noble students were different, there was a twinkle in their eyes. The teacher said that he would take care of it himself, so my justification to stop the match with the pretext of danger disappears.\u201cOr are you going to say that this is also dangerous? Mr. Rudger Chelici.\u201dChris smiled cynically, deliberately provoking Rudger.\u201cI didn\u2019t know that you would care so much about the children that you protected them like that.\u201d\u201cI just considered the possibility of possible danger.\u201d\u201cBut if the two of us go, there\u2019s no risk. How is it? Those two students want to fight each other.\u201dAt Chris\u2019s words, which had an explicit intention towards this side, Rudger could roughly guess the situation. Prior to this, Chris Benimore had not been very fond of Rudger Chelici.He is also a new teacher at Theon but unlike Rudger, who\u2019s a fallen aristocrat, Chris is still a noble. For Chris, who is deeply aristocratic, the very existence of Rudger has always bothered him.\u2018Rudger Chelici, I didn\u2019t like you from the first time I saw you.\u2019The other commoner teachers were still just plain commoners. No matter what he did, he was fussy, lacked nobility, and was not restrained at all but Rudger was different. He shone more than anyone else and was far more aristocratic than himself, a nobleman.Even after the fall of his family he didn\u2019t lose his brilliance. That\u2019s not what Chris liked. It was like that when they first met. There was no sign of surprise at all when he saw him, but Chris thought that something was creeping inside him at the behavior of Rudger, who just shook his head.\u2018Anyway, I didn\u2019t like it when Hugo-sensei asked us to invite him into our faction.\u2019Rudger is said to have even told Hugo openly that he would not go into such a place.\u2018Such a place? What do you mean by such a place\u2019Chris didn\u2019t understand. The more he tried, the darker his feelings for Rudger grew and at this moment, Chris got a chance to win one over Rudger.\u201cHow is it Mr. Rudger? Isn\u2019t this enough?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s hear from the students.\u201dRudger said so and turned to Aidan. It was a gaze that meant do you really want to have a magic duel with Jevan.\u201c\u2026\u2026Yes. Certainly.\u201dAidan nodded with determination.Aidan, too, at first thought that he wanted to solve the problem verbally without fighting however Jevan crossed the line too much. He said such harsh things to his friend and Aidan couldn\u2019t forgive that.Rudger sighed inwardly at the sight and looked back at Chris.\u201cStudent Aidan said he would do it, too, so I\u2019ll allow him to attend on condition, as Mr. Chris said.\u201d\u201cOh, that\u2019s good.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cAh. Mr. Rudger. Wait.\u201d\u201cWhat else?\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t we make a bet too?\u201d\u201cBet? It\u2019s such a sudden proposition.\u201d\u201cIt seems that Mr. Rudger really cares about that commoner child.\u201d\u201cI am Aidan, not a commoner. Please beware of discriminatory remarks.\u201d\u201cAh, you are student Aidan. I didn\u2019t know because I didn\u2019t take my class. Anyway, I think of Jevan Pellio as a pretty talented wizard.\u201dIt was a word of mouth, but Jevan had already taken it seriously, and his expression changed.Rudger responded in a cold voice, as usual.\u201cSo what exactly are you going to do?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s up to each other to decide who will win. Of course, I\u2019m betting that student Pellio will win.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s funny that someone who became a teacher makes bets in front of the students.\u201dChris was annoyed at those words, but he managed to hold it in and kept his smile.\u201cSo what are you going to do? Well, if you don\u2019t like it, there\u2019s nothing I can do about it. I wouldn\u2019t bet on the losing side like Mr. Rudger did.\u201dThe students murmured at those words. As Rudger took care of Aidan in the eyes of the students the situation became Aidan and Rudger vs. Jevan and Chris.Rudger found Chris\u2019 behavior funny. It was enough to simply reject neatly and step away but even so, he couldn\u2019t erase this feeling of regret.It was Chris who encouraged the fight that could have been stopped in the first place, and he was even subtly making moves on him. There were too many eyes so Rudger couldn\u2019t ignore the situation and he was getting annoyed.\u2018Why do I have to step back?\u2019The reason he hasn\u2019t paid much attention to Chris, who has been hostile, is simply that he didn\u2019t feel the need to. After all, there is no need to expend his energy against a person he didn\u2019t like from the start. But now that he tried to make a move against him things were different.\u2018Yes. Let\u2019s hang out a little.\u2019He really wanted to check out Aidan\u2019s true skills through this match so Rudger nodded his head.\u201cSince Mr. Chris wants that, I will join you.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t think Mr. Rudger would accept this. So, Mr. Rudger, who do you think will win?\u201d\u201cOf course, Aidan.\u201dAidan\u2019s eyes widened at Rudger\u2019s unwavering voice. He never thought that Rudger would choose him here. It was the same with other students on the other hand, Chris seemed to know this. In fact, he nodded his head satisfactorily, as if he had hoped for this to happen.\u201cGood.\u201d\u201cWhat will be the outcome of the bet?\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026Well, we\u2019re still teachers of Theon, but aren\u2019t we magicians? We are also teachers who teach classes on the same manifestation system.\u201dAt that, Rudger asked, seemingly surprised.\u201cYou also teach the manifestation system?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dRudger was asking because he really didn\u2019t know but Chris\u2019s face turned red.\u2018Hey, you damn fallen noble!\u2019This was one of the reasons Chris hated Rudger. Chris Benimore came to Theon to teach the manifestation system, he was proud of that fact. Then, out of the blue, he found out that an unheard-of fallen noble named Rudger Chelici was in charge of the same manifestation class as him.Rudger was even in charge of the second year, and Chris himself was in charge of the lower first year.It is natural for someone with more skill to take charge of a higher grade. In other words, Chris Benimore already knew the fact that he was one step below Rudger Chelici.Rudger even allowed the first graders to attend his classes, so he took many talented students out of his first year class. He had good reasons to hate Rudger.\u2018You think you\u2019ll be safe after insulting me like that?\u2019In fact, Rudger was unaware of his own actions. Because he didn\u2019t even know that Chris Benimore was a teacher of the manifestation system like him. That fact further crushed Chris Benimore\u2019s self-esteem but Rudger barely understood Chris\u2019 behavior.\u2018No wonder that he was hostile to me. So it\u2019s because we\u2019re both in charge of the same manifestation class.\u2019Chris was pissed off and being compared to a teacher who teaches the same class only made him angrier. Rudger even showed the source code a magic that would never be taught in a normal class. Unknowingly, the comparison Chris was experiencing among the students must have intensified.Chris managed to calm his anger and fixed his glasses.\u201cHmmm\u2026In any case, we\u2019re going to offer each one a field of magic or theory that we have studied in the manifestation system. Oh, of course, it\u2019s not important data, but wouldn\u2019t it be enough to make a bet?\u201d\u201cShouldn\u2019t we also state what level of theory we have to offer?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s up to each individual to decide.\u201dAt your discretion, there is nothing more difficult than that. When it comes to food, it is no different than saying to add ingredients in moderation.If you give something that is so ridiculously useless, you\u2019re revealing that your level is only this but if you give something too good, you will lose a lot.In the end, it was said that \u2018moderate\u2019 among wizards was just the middle line that would not damage his reputation and would not damage him. Rudger didn\u2019t really care what it was, so he decided to accept it.\u201cGreat. However, it would be impossible to compete right now, so let\u2019s give it some time.\u201d\u201cHow much time?\u201d\u201cThree days later would be appropriate. Then we will have a public match.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026.3 days?\u201dHe didn\u2019t know if his opponent would do anything to the student he was supporting, but the time of three days was quite tight for that.Even a genius cannot learn new magic in 3 days. All you have to do is analyze your opponent and maintain your best condition.\u201cThen we\u2019ll do it again at this location in three days.\u201d\u201cGreat.\u201dThe news that a public magic duel was decided with the consent of two teachers spread through Theon in an instant.* * *With everyone scattered to spread the word about the duel somehow, Aidan looked at Rudger who was still there and was at a loss for what to do. He felt guilty about thinking that Rudger had been swept up in this case because of him, and he opened his mouth, wanting to apologize.\u201cI, Mr. Rudger. Sorry. Just because of me\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cDone.\u201dRudger cut Aidan\u2019s words coldly.\u201cYeah? But\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cIt has already happened. What you need to worry about now is not how to apologize for what happened, but how to win the duel against Jevan Pellio.\u201d\u201cUh, um. That is correct.\u201dRudger\u2019s words were right. It was too late for regrets. Still, Aidan wasn\u2019t sure about something. He didn\u2019t know if he\u2019d be able to defeat Jevan since he was just a beginner at magic.\u201cWhat are you so worried about?\u201dRudger pushed Aidan.\u201cAre you saying you can\u2019t do it now?\u201d\u201cThat, that\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cAidan, you told me you would do it. Then, was your answer at that time just a lie that you were forced to bring out because you were swept away by the atmosphere?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026It is not.\u201d\u201cI hope you were serious when you accepted the duel.\u201d\u201cBut in practice\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cNot different. Jevan is from a noble family, and he must have received personal education before joining Theon. He is already different from you and you know it too.\u201dAidan couldn\u2019t argue with that because everything Rudger said was right.\u201cHowever, it is too early to make a hasty conclusion. Aidan, what do you think is important in a fight?\u201d\u201cUh, um. I do not know. Is it your skill?\u201dRudger shook his head.\u201cNo matter how talented someone is, it is not uncommon for him to die at the hand of someone weaker. The world doesn\u2019t just flow by the logic of power. A battle is won or lost in an instant.\u201d\u201cThen what is it?\u201d\u201cYou already have it.\u201dAt Rudger\u2019s point, Aidan kept his mouth shut. It must be referring to the [special] type of magic that he possesses.\u201cYou only need to use it for the important moments.\u201dThere was only one reason Rudger took Chris\u2019 bet so easily. Because he was sure that Aidan would win this fight.\u201cBut I\u2026\u2026I want to win only with my pure skills!\u201dBut Aidan was different. He was obviously grateful for the magic that made him enter Theon, but he was unwilling to win with it.\u201cMr. Rudger! Please teach me!\u201dAidan stared at Rudger with an unwavering gaze. Rudger, who looked down at Aidan with a cold gaze, was bewildered inside.\u2018Why is this guy here?\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 46": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Academy\u2019s Undercover ProfessorCH 46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayC46: A Dangerous Bet (3)Chapter 3/3 for last week.To be honest, at first, when Chris wanted me to bet with him on the result of the duel I was happy on the inside but I didn\u2019t show it on the outside because this was a sure win bet since Aidan managed to enter Theon then he must have enough talent and skills.Even though students from wealthy merchant families and aristocrats have been thoroughly educated from an early age, so it is natural for them to be far ahead of commoner students at the beginning of the semester.It was only two weeks after the new semester started and the common students did not have enough time to catch up with the aristocrats but Aidan is different from normal students.\u2018Mr. Chris Benimore doesn\u2019t seem to know that at all.\u2019If I were in charge of the first-year manifestation system class, I would have checked the list of students who were unusual among the first-year students. Still, Chris didn\u2019t think much of Aidan.Here I realized one thing; Chris Benimore said he didn\u2019t even pay attention to the commoner students.\u2018Perhaps he only memorized the names of students from noble families whom he should be concerned about.\u2019It is a disqualification as a teacher, but I understand. A person who was born as a noble, lived as a noble, will continue to live as an aristocrat. If such a person had a commoner living in a world completely different from his own, he would of course be offended. In that case, it is quite wise to simply not even pay attention to it.I have no intention of blaming students for judging by class or discriminating against students because this is such a world.\u2018But he never thought it would hold him back.\u2019Even if Aidan lacked magical knowledge, he was able to enter Theon because of the [Unusual] type of magic he possessed. He got some sort of admissions benefits, but that doesn\u2019t mean Aidan is bad because it is the president\u2019s greatest wish right now for more students who have learned such rare magic to gather at Theon.\u2018Perhaps it will be too late to realize what kind of magic Aidan has learned later.\u2019The bet has already been placed. Claiming invalidity for not knowing is rather an act of revealing one\u2019s own shortcomings in not being able to confirm information in advance. Even if Chris would probably realize Aidan\u2019s skills, he would have no choice but to carry on the bet.\u2018But what the hell is this guy talking about?\u2019What? You want to win with your own strength? For a moment, I didn\u2019t understand what the heck he was talking about. I had no choice but to realize how outgoing and righteous this guy Aidan was. He is a guy who is willing to help a werewolf who was threatening his own life.I was thinking of saying something to calm myself down, but I got a little worried.\u2018Isn\u2019t it a good thing to check it out once in a while?\u2019It didn\u2019t seem too bad to take this opportunity to check his will and talent to learn something new. The elemental manifestation was too basic, so it was impossible to gauge Aidan\u2019s talent with that alone.\u2018I should teach you something a little more advanced.\u2019I glanced down at Aidan. Perhaps he sensed my gaze but I could see him shaking his shoulders.\u201cAidan.\u201d\u201cYes, yes.\u201d\u201cIf that\u2019s what you want, it\u2019s fine. For the remaining three days, I will teach you how to prepare for the duel.\u201d\u201cReally? But that\u2019s\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cThe dices have already been cast. Maybe Mr. Chris will give Jevan some advice or teach him how to polish his basic magic. This isn\u2019t a confrontation between students, it\u2019s a matter of pride between me and Mr. Chris as teachers and wizards.\u201dIf it is something completely basic, such as implementing an attribute element, there is no need to think about it again.\u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t anything to teach.\u201dA match between wizards and wizards is not purely magic. The casting speed, the magnificence of magic and the magical accuracy are not enough. It is only a prejudice that wizards fight only with magic.\u201cAidan. I will teach you how to fight against wizards.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cYes. However, the remaining period is 3 days. It\u2019s tight, so what I can teach you will be only the very basics. It will be very difficult and you may fail. Will you still do it?\u201d\u201cYeah! I\u2019ll do it.\u201dAidan answered in a loud voice that he had made up his mind.\u2018Good attitude.\u2019\u201cThen let\u2019s start today.\u201d\u201cYes? Really?\u201dAidan had a slightly confused face as he didn\u2019t know that we would start right now. I nodded and pointed at the two who were watching us from a distance.\u201cThe same goes for both of you.\u201d\u201cYeah?\u201d\u201cMe too?\u201dLeo and Tracy were both embarrassed when I called them, but they couldn\u2019t refuse. Aidan is not going to be the only one that has to improve and I think they will continue to be together in the future.With 3 days remaining Chris and Jevan must have been thinking that they had won and I let them enjoy themselves for now. But, will they still be able to smile after what will happen three days later?I started to look forward to the day a little.* * *\u201cUgh. I will die.\u201dIn the dark night after the sun has completely set, Aidan returned to the dormitory and laid down on the bed with his exhausted body. He prided himself on not skipping training since he came to Theon, but Rudger\u2019s training was unimaginably hard. Maybe it was because he was also a soldier.Aidan remembered the arduous training of Rudger, who was teaching Leo and Tracy with him, and rubbed his stingy body with his hands.\u2018I didn\u2019t know I could use my body like this.\u2019What Rudger taught him wasn\u2019t the manifestation magic or other spells, but how to use his body.He has to use his body and his head at the same time. Because of that, he didn\u2019t know how many times he rolled on the floor of the alternate training ground. He couldn\u2019t believe he had to do this for the next two days.\u2018Still, it feels like something has improved.\u2019Rudger\u2019s teachings were difficult enough to overwhelm the body, but Aidan did not harbor any dissatisfaction and silently carried it out because he instinctively felt certain that this method would help him.\u2018More than that, why did Mr. Rudger say that he would trust me?\u2019Didn\u2019t he think he was going to lose to Jevan? If so, what is the reason?\u2018Is it because of the magic I use?\u2019There was a possibility since teachers have the right to access students\u2019 information but it didn\u2019t make sense for Rudger to be convinced of something with that one thing.Rudger must have never seen him use [Unusual] type magic himself, so why was he so sure? The magic he learned was passed down directly from his master, so it would be difficult to fully understand just by hearing his name.\u2018Does Mr. Rudger know anything about my teacher?\u2019Aidan closed his eyes with that thought in mind. The day was so hard that he fell asleep without even thinking of changing his clothes.* * *Two days after that Aidan was running through the outdoor training ground out of breath.\u201cHeh heh heh heh.\u201dOn the road that Aidan was heading to, Rudger was standing with his back clasped.Aidan, who discovered Rudger, spurred on running even more. Rudger, who was holding his back, stretched out his right hand. At that moment, a sphere of pure white magic flew towards Aidan.Aidan looked at it, clenched his teeth and turned his body to the side and at the same time his magical powers awakened.His leg was twisted and he fell but he managed to avoid the magic by rolling several laps on the ground.Rudger slowly approached Aidan.\u201cThe cycle of magic is circulation, and moving the body is moving the body. Don\u2019t try to overlap them, but recognize them separately.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dAidan, who had become muddy, jumped up from the ground.\u201cYou failed again so run another lap.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dAidan ran back to the training ground.Leo and Tracy, who were sitting on chairs at the training ground and were resting, stared at Aidan with the same gaze as if they were looking at a monster.I\u2019m already tired and I don\u2019t have the strength to run anymore, but Aidan has good stamina.\u201dTracy was purely admiring Aidan\u2019s tireless stamina. She had been cultivating her stamina even before she entered the age of three, but she was not at the level of Aidan. She clenched her teeth and tried to catch up with Aidan, but she eventually lifted the white flag.\u201cHe has great will.\u201dOn the other hand, Leo was taking a break first because his stamina was inferior to that of Tracy due to his small stature but his eyes were sharper than Tracy\u2019s.Although it may seem okay to Tracy, Aidan was in a situation where he was physically at his limit. Nevertheless, the reason for running is probably because of the will to not lose in the duel.\u201cUgh.\u201dTracy ignored Leo\u2019s words and stared blankly at Aidan. He was a boy who didn\u2019t say he hated her even though she acted so badly. Rather, he smiled and asked her to eat together and was the stupid guy who reached out his hand first as her friend.She couldn\u2019t take her eyes off of Aidan\u2019s hard training. He looks dirty with sweat and dirt, but is it too far-fetched to think that he is cool?At some point, Aidan had completed one lap again and was rushing towards Rudger and Rudger raised his hand.\u2018Come.\u2019Leo and Tracy were nervous and a cold sweat was forming on their clenched fists.Rudger\u2019s magic flew towards Aidan, who was panting on the verge of exhaustion. It was the [Shining Stone], a basic manifestation type magic.Because Rudger was watching and shooting, it was not a problem to avoid it as long as he focused on it. The problem is that it\u2019s not easy to dodge while running but seeing Aidan swiping sideways in his running stance, almost avoiding Rudger\u2019s magic, Tracy jumped up from her seat without realizing it.\u201cAvoided!\u201d\u201cNot yet. What\u2019s important is the next step.\u201dLeo said.Dodge the magic and then counterattack. Aidan immediately gathered his magic power while running and wanted to activate a spell. This is a technique that requires separate use of the head and body and it may seem simple at first glance, but for those who have not yet mastered magic properly, there is nothing more difficult than this.It\u2019s more difficult than drawing a square with one hand and a triangle with the other. Moving the body and casting a spell at the same time were a division of thinking.\u2018Aidan, you can do it.\u2019Leo clenched his fists.Wizards must concentrate a lot of their minds in order to cast spells so when they do so they don\u2019t move at all so the wizards were always exposed to danger.Wizards have taken the path of putting a barrier around or shortening the casting time in order to safely manifest their magic but there were also people who walked a completely different path.There were those who had the idea that if it was dangerous to be immobile when using magic, they could use magic while moving. They are wizards, but they do not sit still and train their bodies to the limit to implement magic.Unlike those who learn science and explore magic, they wander around the world to challenge and fight the unknown. They are known as [War Mages]. The method that Rudger taught was the [Moving-Magus], which is the most basic fighting method that the war mages learn.\u201cSuck!\u201dAidan took a deep breath and raised his magic power. His running legs didn\u2019t stop and he didn\u2019t even have time to catch his breath but no words were needed. What mattered was the will. A spell manifested on Aidan\u2019s hand, who was running. Leo and Tracy, who were watching the scene from afar, opened their eyes wide and mouths fell open.Aidan\u2019s magic unfolded. It was the first-tier basic magic, and the same [Shining Stone] that Rudger had shot at him.It was weaker than Rudger\u2019s spell but he managed to cast the spell and shoot it towards Rudger. However, Rudger raised his gloved right hand and caught Aidan\u2019s [Shining Stone] with great ease.Leo and Tracy, who were watching the scene, unknowingly said, \u2018Ah!\u2019, exclaiming with regret.\u201cHuh. Heh.\u201dAidan, who was panting for breath, stopped in front of Rudger.\u201cAidan.\u201d\u201cHuh. huh. Yes. Teacher.\u201d\u201cYou pass.\u201dBefore Rudger\u2019s answer came, Aidan fell on the floor with a smile of accomplishment.\u201cThe duel is tomorrow, so get enough rest today.\u201d\u201cHuh. Heh.\u201dAidan couldn\u2019t afford to answer.Rudger grinned at the sight and turned his back.\u201cYou can do it.\u201dAidan, who was so exhausted, did not hear him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 47": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Academy\u2019s Undercover ProfessorCH 47Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayC47: Student DuelWhen Chris Benimore received a letter from his private office, he read it at one glance and immediately set it on fire.\u201cYes. I knew that too.\u201dThe report that came in was the material sent by a user of Theon and the content was related to Rudger Chelici.\u201cAre you teaching that commoner hard? Even if you pretend not to be, you are desperate to win the bet.\u201dHe murmured and laughed at Rudger\u2019s actions, but that didn\u2019t make Chris Benimore stand still. He turned his head to look at the boy standing in front of him tensely.\u201cJevan Pellio.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cI think you know what I want to say to you.\u201dJevan nodded his head with a determined face.\u201cYeah, I know. I have to win against that cheeky commoner in this duel.\u201d\u201cIt is not enough to just win. You have to show the gap between nobles and commoners with overwhelming power.\u201dIt was a demand that was a little too harsh, but Jevan Pellio didn\u2019t think he was going to fail.When he heard that Aidan was being taught by Rudger Chelici, he was terrified, but he had Chris Benimore.\u201cTake it.\u201dChris tossed a reagent bottle at Jevan.Jevan, who took it in a hurry, looked at the blue liquid inside and asked with a puzzled face.\u201cIs this?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a magic booster. Drink it before the duel.\u201d\u201cBut isn\u2019t this against the rules?\u201d\u201dThis is a special product of our Benimore family that leaves no trace if taken in advance, so there is no need to worry.\u201d\u201cThis\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cWhen you drink it, your magic power is instantly amplified, but the duration is less than 5 minutes.\u201d\u201cFive minutes. It\u2019s short.\u201d\u201cYes it won\u2019t amplify your existing magic, but will increase the limit of the output. The traces of the drug disappear immediately, leaving only the effect. Just pay attention to the magic power exhaustion after 30 minutes.\u201dAt Chris\u2019 words, Jevan swallowed his saliva. In fact, it was close to a drug that allowed you to use the magical power you had at once. His pride would not allow him to drink such a drug against a commoner.\u2018But if it\u2019s for a sure win.\u2019As long as Rudger is behind Aidan, he may have received something like himself because he\u2019s a dirty commoner.With that in mind, Jevan put the amplification potion into his pocket with a stiff face.Seeing that, Chris laughed.* * *The auditorium of the 2nd training ground was more than half full of people who had come to see the new student\u2019s magic duel today. Most of the first-year students gathered but there were also second-year students and other teachers.If it was simply a fight between first-year students, they would have ignored it, but since it was a match between two teachers, it was a different story.Rudger Chelici and Chris Benimore have just been assigned to Theon and they both have in common that they are in charge of the manifestation class.However, one is a fallen aristocrat, and the other is a noble and even a high count. The difference between them was quite large and Rudger supported the commoners while Chris Benimore supported the nobles.In the end the soon-to-be-scheduled duel transformed into a battle between commoners and aristocrats.\u201cWho will win?\u201d\u201cAre you sure it\u2019s a freshman fight? Then the nobility has an advantage. Commoners are not educated from an early age.\u201d\u201cI heard that this commoner freshman is not weak. They say he made a big contribution during the werewolf incident.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t know but Mr. Rudger trained him.\u201d\u201cIn that sense, there was Mr. Chris on the other side.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know the teacher. Was he in charge of the first year?\u201d\u201cEven though they are both teaching the same manifestation system, it seems that Mr. Rudger is better.\u201dDuring the conversation, people\u2019s eyes turned to the top, where only teachers could sit in the audience.\u201cLook.\u201d\u201cUh. It\u2019s real.\u201dChris Benimore, who had just entered the teacher\u2019s seat, sat down calmly while maintaining his dignity as a nobleman. Because of his intelligent appearance, the adoring eyes of the female students naturally followed Chris. Chris also lightly enjoyed the gazes.At that moment, the murmur of the students grew louder. It was quite different from when Chris showed up.\u2018What?\u2019He looked at who the hell it was, and it was that man, Rudger Chelici. He had long black hair tied in a ponytail, a sharp jawline and a high nose bridge. His cool facial features and deep sunken eyes made many women\u2019s hearts flutter.He wore a black shirt and black trousers with a black tie and even his long coat was black. The overall impression of the black color is reminiscent of a raven. Holding a staff in his right hand, he looked like the head of a prestigious mage family.\u201cWow. Look at Mr. Rudger.\u201d\u201cAre you crazy?\u201dAll eyes of the students, who were distracted by Chris\u2019 appearance, turned to Rudger but Rudger didn\u2019t even care how much attention was drawn to him, and he went to the empty seat of the professor\u2019s lounge and sat down.\u201cSaw that?\u201d\u201cUh. The atmosphere is really not a joke. It\u2019s understandable why the rumors spread like that.\u201d\u201cIs he really a fallen aristocrat? I thought he was nobler than the other noble teachers.\u201dChris, who overheard the students talking like that, smirked and clicked his tongue, not hiding his unpleasant feelings, turned to Rudger, who was sitting in the row next to him.Rudger would probably look around this way, but he was staring at the training ground with a smirk in his eyes that didn\u2019t show what he was thinking. Chris bit his teeth in response as if he didn\u2019t even care about this.\u2018That naughty attitude is now over. I will make you feel defeated in front of everyone.\u2019This fight will be won by Jevan Pellio. Aidan, that commoner? Chris didn\u2019t even know such a student existed. He didn\u2019t even check the list of commoner students.\u2018Anyway, commoners are commoners. Even those who were not properly educated entered the school with preferential treatment.\u2019When he was thinking that, the commotion in the audience reached a climax. Feeling noisier than when Rudger appeared, Chris looked back and he could see why.\u201cPresident, you come.\u201dWhen Elisa Willow appeared, Chris jumped up from her seat and greeted her. The president smiled broadly and accepted Chris\u2019 greeting.\u201cHello sir Chris Benimore. Wow. There are many people here.\u201d\u201cPresident, what are you doing here?\u201d\u201cI heard that something interesting was going on, so I came to see for myself.\u201dThe teachers who followed as if assisting the president were Marie Ross of the Pharmacy department, who is said to have served the longest in Theon, and Hugo Burtag, who leads a faction of noble teachers including Chris.When all the most famous people in Theon gathered, the students expressed their surprise, saying they had no idea that this duel could have been this big.It was the same with Chris. He just thought that the two students would have a simple fight but he didn\u2019t think the president would come forward.\u2018The president had no choice but to come because it was a fight between commoners and aristocratic students?\u2019The president is nominally neutral with no push for either side, but Chris knows that the president values commoner students more than nobles. That was the reason why Hugo had a confrontation with the president in the first place.\u2018Will it be okay?\u2019He was worried about what would happen if the president interfered, but it didn\u2019t seem necessary. The president, who wanted to remain neutral, had no reason to intervene in this matter.\u2018Rudger Chelici.\u2019Even when the president appeared, the man did not look behind him and just sat still. His behavior was cheeky and rude but thinking that it was manly Chris got annoyed.\u201cMr. Rudger! Long time no see!\u201dThe president greeted him with a smile. At that moment, Rudger, who had been still, turned his head to the president. He slowly got up from his seat and bowed to her.\u201cHello President.\u201d\u201cYeah. Hello Mr. Rudger. How have you been?\u201d\u201cI am doing well.\u201d\u201cI was really surprised. All of a sudden, Mr. Rudger and Mr. Chris said that they would like to watch the students compete so I wanted to know what was going on.\u201d\u201cWe were just making a simple bet.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026Who did Mr. Rudger bet will win?\u201dKnowingly, the president asked if she wanted to hear from Rudger directly.\u201cI bet on student Aidan victory.\u201d\u201cBetting doesn\u2019t happen unless you choose the opposite, so Mr. Chris must have been betting on the victory of student Pellio?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Yes.\u201dChris had no choice but to answer reluctantly. The president smiled softly and clapped her hands.\u201cI am really looking forward to it. Of course, the priority is to ensure that the students are not injured, right?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about that. We have put in place as many safeguards as possible.\u201dMarie Ross answered from the side instead. Even if the students competed in an informal match, there was a high possibility of hurting the opponent therefore they wear light protective gear before entering the duel.Metal protective gears that can be worn on the chest, shoulders and both knees resonate with each other and a thin magic barrier is placed over the student\u2019s body in the end the student whose barrier runs out of energy first loses the duel.\u201cThen I\u2019m happy.\u201d\u201cAh, just in time, a player appeared.\u201dThe first to stand in the center of the training ground was Aidan with a very nervous expression. He had a face that looked like he was about to vomit because he wasn\u2019t used to the gazes pouring down like a spotlight on him.\u201cAidan! Go for it!\u201d\u201cBreak his cheeky nose.\u201dPerhaps it was thanks to Tracy and Leo, who cheered for him, Aidan nodded with a more relaxed face and waved his hand toward the audience. Commoner students cheered Aidan in hopes that he would raise the status of the commoners.Then Jevan appeared through the opposite entrance.\u201cJevan, I believe in you!\u201dThe noble students cheered for Jevan who nodded his head with a smile as if he was familiar with this situation. The two stood facing each other and Jevan looked at Aidan with a smirk.\u201cYou didn\u2019t run away?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cAre you nervous? Commoners would not be accustomed to a place like this. If you ran away you would not have suffered a catastrophic defeat in front of everyone.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026If I win.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cApologize to Tracy and Leo.\u201d\u201cWhat? Hahaha!\u201dPerhaps he didn\u2019t know that Aidan would say such a thing here, so Jevan burst into laughter.\u201cYes. If you win, I\u2019ll get down on my knees.\u201d\u201cYou said it.\u201d\u201cBut what should you do after I beat you?\u201dHe was confident as he felt the powerful magic in his body. It was thanks to the magic boosting potion that he drank a while ago before going on stage, an item whose duration is so short that it is unknown whether it has been used or not.There was a condition that the match had to be over within a short time of less than 5 minutes, but with this strength, it seemed that it would not be too difficult.\u2018If the same magic is used the one who has the most magical power wins.\u2019There is nothing more advantageous than the superiority of firepower in a duel between wizards. Even if the same spell is casted at the same speed, it is possible to defeat your opponent with brute force.Before starting the match, the referee checked the status of Aidan and Jevan. This was to verify if any irregularities were involved in the duel. Jevan believed Chris\u2019 words, so he nodded proudly.Eventually, the referee, who was checking Aidan\u2019s condition, saw the object hanging from his waist and widened his eyes.\u201cStudent, what is this?\u201d\u201cAh, this is my staff for this duel.\u201dAidan replied with a smile, but the referee was still puzzled. The staff that Aidan had was basically different from the wands made of unusual materials that wizards deal with, and the shape itself was different, it was in the form of a sword.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 48": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Academy\u2019s Undercover ProfessorCH 48Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayC48: Student Duel (2)The blunt tip and thick blade looked like something for hitting, not cutting. It was closer to changing a magic wand than a sword, so the danger or lethality was close to zero. The referee thought about it for a while and decided it would be okay.\u201cGet ready.\u201dFollowing the referee\u2019s instructions, Aidan and Jevan stood at both ends of the arena. The audience, who had been shouting, shut their mouths and the second training became quiet.In the center, Aidan and Jevan stared at each other with intense eyes.\u201cStart!\u201dAs soon as the referee\u2019s cry fell, the two aimed their wands at each other. The most basic step in a battle between wizards is to analyze the gap between the opponent and oneself first and that is done through the exchange of first-level magic.\u201cPaah!\u201dThe magic that Aidan activated was [Flowing Water], a first-class water element spell. Conversely, the magic that was activated by Jevan was [Stinging Fire], a first-class fire-attribute spell.\u201cThey\u2019re fast.\u201d\u201cIs their speed the same?\u201dThe spells unfolded at the same time. In other words, Aidan, who everyone thought would be at a disadvantage, implemented the spell faster than expected. And there was also a difference in the elements that the two used.Aidan used water and Jevan used fire. There would be no need to ask which attribute is superior.\u2018Yes!\u2019Aidan was happy.In order to have the edge in the first clash, he had to occupy an advantageous position in the attribute. It\u2019s kind of like rock, paper, scissors, and it wasn\u2019t pure luck.\u2018I thought he would definitely use fire-attribute magic.\u2019Jevan has a fiery personality and he expected that the first magic he would use would be the fire since it has the highest attack power.Aidan read the opponent\u2019s magic in advance through psychological warfare and prepared the corresponding magic. Some students would have thought it was just a coincidence, but the teachers were different.\u201cHe is ahead from the start.\u201dNext to the president who spoke happily, Hugo frowned without hiding his discomfort.\u201cThe duel isn\u2019t over yet.\u201dAs Hugo said, it didn\u2019t turn out to be Aidan\u2019s win. When the two magic collided in mid-air, contrary to what people expected, it was the fire that destroyed the water magic.\u201cOh my gosh.\u201d\u201cYou can beat water with fire?\u201d\u201cIs the difference in magic power that big?\u201dNo matter how much a counter exists in an attribute, if the mana is higher, even that counter will be ignored.The flame that quickly evaporated water and it flew towards Aidan before long. Aidan hurriedly bent down to avoid the flying flame while astonished gazes turned to Jevan.\u201cHahaha\u2026This is the difference between you and me, insignificant commoner.\u201dJevan did not stop using his magic while talking.While Aidan evaded, he prepared the next magic. Aidan, who had corrected his posture, also immediately activated his magic. This time Jevan used the lightning attribute while Aidan used fire.The two spells collided and canceled each other out in the air. However, the difference from a while ago was that the place where the magic was offset this time was that it was a little closer towards Aidan.\u201cHahaha!\u201dJevan used magic again, and it was the same with Aidan. Their magic collided in the air again.Aidan knew he was at disadvantage in terms of firepower, so he put in more of his mana and activated his magic. A third crash occurred and it happened right in front of Aidan.\u201cWah!\u201dAidan staggered due to the shock of the magic explosion.\u201cAidan has been pushed!\u201d\u201cIs the difference between nobles and commoners that big?\u201dEveryone was chatting among themselves in the audience.\u2018Chance.\u2019Jevan did not miss the gap where Aidan had collapsed and immediately used the next magic. He was going to use the momentum and put an end to it.Aidan took hold of his stance and tried to point his wand for defense, but immediately changed his judgment.\u2018No. It\u2019s too late to use magic now!\u2019Jevan has already started implementing the technique. Even if he tried to catch up in a hurry here, in the end it all depends on who casts his spell first.If he focused on speed and used a simple spell, there is a high probability that the magic will fail. It\u2019s power is also inferior to the opponent.If he had Rudger\u2019s source code he could use magic to win but he didn\u2019t.\u2018In the first place, it\u2019s impossible right now.\u2019He realized he couldn\u2019t cast a spell so he chose another method.\u2018From here on, I\u2019ll use what I\u2019ve learned from Mr. Rudger.\u2019Instead of using his staff, Aidan rushed towards Jevan.\u201cWhat?!\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s running?\u201d\u201cHas he given up?\u201dMost of the audience thought that Aidan had given up since no normal magician would use his body in the current situation.\u201cIt\u2019s savage. That\u2019s why the common people.\u201d\u201cAidan\u2026\u2026What are you going to do?\u201dWhile everyone despised or felt sorry for him Jevan magic was complete.\u201cIn the end, did you give up because you couldn\u2019t do it?\u201dJevan smiled cruelly and used the second-level magic [Burning Thunder]. It is a very powerful magic among the second-level magic that pierces the opponent\u2019s with a quick lightning strike.Aidan won\u2019t die because there is a safety device on his body, but considering this overflowing magical power right now, he\u2019ll be able to make him feel pain enough to die.Jevan aimed the magic at Aidan\u2019s forehead.\u201cTake it!\u201dJevan thought that Aidan had reached his limit since was running towards him and activated [Burning Thunder]. The yellow current in the air eventually turned into an arrow and flew towards Aidan.Everyone who watched the scene thought the fight was over.\u2018It\u2019s over. In the end, Jevan won.\u2019Chris grinned as he watched the match go by as expected. He had already looked back at Rudger, anticipating what kind of face he would make.\u201c\u2026\u2026What?\u201dRudger was watching the duel with a nonchalant face as if the fight wasn\u2019t over yet. Suddenly, an unfamiliar chill-like anxiety ran down Chris\u2019 spine.\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dChris\u2019 eyes hurriedly turned to the stadium and saw Aidan turning his upper body and heading to the side in a running posture to avoid the magic that flew in front of him.\u201cWow!\u201dThe [Burning Thunder] brushed past Aidan\u2019s cheeks and shoulders. Aidan\u2019s face was slightly distorted because of the pain, but that was all Aidan didn\u2019t stop.Chris was shocked to see the scene. He had noticed how Aidan had evaded the attack.\u2018Even in the midst of that, he didn\u2019t take his eyes off the other person?\u2019Usually, when new students engage in magic battles, those who are not yet accustomed to fighting between wizards may behave like a beginner and look away from the other person, or close their eyes tightly and raise their arms when magic flies towards them, instead of defending properly.When you realize that pain is approaching, your body moves instinctively because that is human nature. There is no way to change that other than to train for a long time. However, Aidan was a freshman who had just entered the school. He was a beginner who didn\u2019t know much about magic.But Aidan was not afraid of the magic flying towards his forehead, and he kept going without averting his gaze. It wasn\u2019t just a matter of luck, he had a will strong enough to overcome pain. It was an action that was possible because he was convinced that he could avoid it.\u2018But it will take time to get up and use magic!\u2019Chris\u2019 judgment was correct. After all, Jevan still had the initiative. As if responding to that will, Jevan took action. When he realized that his attack had missed, he was embarrassed for a moment, but Jevan prepared the next magic right away.\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dHowever, seeing the magic formula created in front of Aidan\u2019s nose, Jevan had no choice but to open his eyes wide. It was the same for Hugo and Marie, and even the president looked with interest.Chris had nothing to say. He immediately recognized the technique Aidan was using.\u201c[Moving-Magus]!\u201dA practical skill that battle wizards learn to cast magic while moving their body.Chris turned his head to look at Rudger. The man who had not taken his eyes off the duel for a while and there was a faint smile on his lips.In a short period of three days, this man taught the commoner the \u201c[Moving-Magus], which is the technique to outperform the opponent in a magic duel.\u2018Did he learn that in 3 days?\u2019Aidan had learned the [Moving-Magus] in just three days?\u2018Are the commoners born with such talent?\u2019Chris didn\u2019t know.While Jevan and he were already intoxicated with the toast of victory, Aidan worked hard while being taught by Rudger.\u2018Jevan! You idiot! Stop the magic!\u2019Chris tried to shout, but the last remaining reason made him shut his mouth. If he shouted here it was like giving instructions to Jevan, that would ruin a fair match, and it would be an act of eroding his image.He had no choice but to hope that Jevan would notice and take a different action.\u2018Wrong.\u2019Chris closed his eyes tightly.Jevan had never expected that Aidan would use magic while running, so he was preparing his next magic. When Aidan evaded his magic, it would have been better if he didn\u2019t continue his next attack. However, his innate ability became a shackle holding his ankles.He quickly reacted to the first anomaly he encountered. There was nothing wrong with that judgment, but Jevan did not respond at all to the fact that the anomaly unfolded twice in a row, not just once.\u201cWhat?\u201dSeeing the completed magic formula in front of Aidan, Jevan realized that things were going strangely. However, he had no way to first complete the spell he was casting now.The magic that Aidan fired was the [Shining Stone] he had practiced so much. It\u2019s a very simple rank 1 spell but it was lethal since Jevan was careless.The shining stone hits the forehead of Jevan.\u201cGreat!\u201dIt wasn\u2019t fatal, but the pain was great. Jevan was dizzy from the shock and his movements became blunt.Everyone stood up in a hurry but Aidan, who had been given the opportunity, was watching silently.\u2018It\u2019s over.\u2019Seeing the scene, Rudger was satisfied. From the moment he lost his composure, Jevan\u2019s defeat was decided. Aidan pointed his staff at Jevan.\u201cNow it\u2019s my turn.\u201d\u201cOh, no!\u201dBut despite all the screams Aidan\u2019s magic, which was immediately activated, hit his body countless times.The moment the total amount of magical power of the armor surrounding the body became 0, the victory or defeat of the match was decided.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Conversely, the noble students were displeased, and stared at Jevan who was on the floor.\u201cThat bastard spoiled the honor of the nobility.\u201d\u201cIt bothered me that he was trying to make moves here and there.\u201d\u201cHe lost to a commoner. It\u2019s a shame for aristocrats.\u201dJevan looked around with a blank expression on his face.\u2018I lost?\u2019He couldn\u2019t believe this was real but when he tried to wake up from the dream, that didn\u2019t happen. Because this wasn\u2019t a dream, it was reality. The hateful gazes and arrows of criticism that were flying towards him were all real.On this stage, it was not him who got the joy of victory, but the insignificant commoner who had been so neglected.\u2018No. There is something wrong!\u2019He couldn\u2019t have lost. Yes. There must have been some mistake. That dirty commoner must have used some cowardly trick otherwise, there would be no way to use magic while moving.\u2018You fucking commoner\u2019s bastard!\u2019The fact that he took a potion before the duel was erased from his mind. All that was left now was his endless hatred for the commoner who insulted him in front of everyone and his will to kill him.\u2018I will kill you!\u2019Jevan started squeezing out all of his magical power. Everyone was focused on Aidan, who was in the spotlight as the winner, so no one noticed Jevan behavior.Who would have known that a man who had been defeated in a fight would suddenly lose his mind and use magic by surprise? Jevan squeezed out all of his own magical power and performed a second-level magic.It takes about 4 seconds for the magic to be formed. It is quite a long time for an opponent to focus on it, but now that everyone wasn\u2019t vigilant, 4 seconds is a very short time.\u201cHuh?\u201dAidan was the first to notice the strangeness. When he just looked around Jevan, his eyes met with Jevan, who was staring at him.\u201cJevan?\u201dHe saw that Jevan used the second-tier fire magic [Raging Wave].Now that the match was over, Aidan had removed the safety device attached to his body. [Raging Wave] is an attack with the widest range among second-tier magic, so it is virtually impossible to avoid.However, it was impossible to defend because time was running out. The magic was manifested and bright red flames fluttered.\u201cHuh?\u201dThe referee, who was trying to check Aidan\u2019s physical condition, was also perplexed. He didn\u2019t even think that Jevan would do something like this, so he hurriedly pulled out his staff and raised his magical powers.He is an employee at Theon, but he can also use magic to some extent but he was too late. The magic was already approaching him.Aidan jumped out like a spring, grabbed the referee\u2019s back, threw him behind and gripped the sword-shaped staff with both hands.In the slow flow of time, he could see the audience widen their eyes in amazement. Even the teachers who realized the situation belatedly rose from their seats one by one but it was already too late for them to step forward because the flame waves were approaching Aidan\u2019s nose.\u201cAidan!\u201dTracy shouts spread out but Aidan did not look back at her. With his gaze fixed in front, he raised his sword-shaped staff and struck.\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dThen the unbelievable happened. Following the trajectory of Aidan\u2019s wand, the [Raging Wave] magic used by Jevan was split in half and scattered.After a while, [Raging Wave] lost its power and disappeared as if it were scattered in the air.\u201cJust now\u2026\u2026What happened?\u201dWhen students mutter blankly at the scene they do not understand. Rudger stared at Aidan as if he knew this.\u2018Did you use that magic because the moment of crisis came?\u2019Aidan is a wizard who can use [Special] type magic. Unlike the other four series, [Special] is not classified properly as modern magic, and is not widely known to the public.[Anti-Magic], one of the [Unusual] series magic, also known as magic that erased other magic, that\u2019s what Aidan was using now.\u201cIt can\u2019t be!\u201dChris was on the brink of a blackout. He couldn\u2019t believe that Aidan could use anti-magic.\u2018I hope that man knows this\u2026\u2026!\u2019Chris\u2019 eyes turned to Rudger. He was not surprised when Aidan was attacked and sat still.He had no reason to be surprised because he knew that Aidan would win this battle and that he was the owner of an [Unusual] type of magic.\u201cOh my God.\u201dIt was the same for Jevan Pellio. He saw the [Raging Wave] that he used with all his magical power disappearing in vain.Aidan strode towards Jevan, who had completely lost his will.\u201cJevan\u2026\u201d\u201cYou, how can you? How could a commoner use such magic\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cOkay. F*ck this.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dBefore Jevan could ask anything, Aidan moved. His clenched fists slammed his cheeks hard. Aidan looked down at the fallen Jevan and said,\u201cI thought you would at least accept your defeat honorably but I didn\u2019t expect you to be such garbage.\u201dJevan didn\u2019t answer because he was already completely defeated by Aidan physically and mentally, and he couldn\u2019t keep his reason.Belatedly, the referee rushed out and checked Aidan\u2019s body.\u201cStudent Aidan! Are you okay?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine. Is the referee okay? Do you have any injuries anywhere?\u201d\u201cNo I don\u2019t. Thank you. Without you, it would have been very dangerous.\u201dThe teachers and the audience who watched the scene had no choice but to check Aidan again.\u201cOh my gosh. He said he was a user of anti-magic, and it was true.\u201dMarie Ross, who had already heard vaguely about Aidan, put her hand on her lips and smiled. On the other hand, Hugo and Chris\u2019 faces were dark. Only Rudger expected this outcome and maintained a consistent attitude.The students\u2019 reaction was very enthusiastic.\u201cDid you just see it? He cut the magic with his sword!\u201d\u201cIdiot. It\u2019s not a sword, it\u2019s a staff.\u201d\u201cEven so, I didn\u2019t feel that he was using magic. What was it?\u201dFor students who were unaware of the existence of anti-magic, Aidan\u2019s performance a while ago was almost like something out of a fairy tale.Among the amazed students, there were some students who realized what Aidan\u2019s magic was.\u201cThat kid. Did he use anti-magic a while ago?\u201dA beautiful girl with pure white hair and an impression as cold as snow stared intently at Aidan. Her words sounded like she was older than Aidan, but she was also one of the freshmen who had just entered Theon.A girl who deserves to be arguably the best among these first-year freshmen. She is the top student with the highest admissions score and a rookie of undisputed talent who is promoted as a promising wizard in the Tower, Julia Plumhart.\u2018I just came to watch for fun but I saw something interesting.\u2019She looked at Aidan with interest. Because of her character, she wouldn\u2019t even have been interested in a duel between students.However, this time, the case became particularly large, and it turned into a battle between commoners and aristocrats rather than students. Even after that, it was said that the fight was for pride between two teachers, so she came to watch.\u2018The first time I fought, I was so miserable and it was hard to keep my eyes open, so I wanted to go back right away.\u2019Others thought Aidan was lucky that she didn\u2019t.\u2018Where did that commoner learn anti-magic? Hmm. I\u2019m a little intrigued.\u2019Julia left the arena as she looked at Aidan who had knocked out Jevan. Besides Julia, there were some people who were interested in the magic that Aidan showed. It was Freuden, the student with the most power in the sophomore year.\u2018Did he say Aidan?\u2019When Baron Pellio wanted to join his faction, Jevan said he would fight. Freuden didn\u2019t bother to stop him. It must have been his true intention but he was not even interested in the first place.No matter who he fights with, he thinks it\u2019s enough if he doesn\u2019t push himself. However, his opponent was a commoner who used anti-magic.\u2018The freshmen are strong this year.\u2019Freuden highly valued Aidan\u2019s anti-magic. Of course, he didn\u2019t know high Aidan mastery was, but his value was at least higher than that of an idiot aristocrat.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dFreuden glanced at the fallen Jevan with a pathetic gaze and got up from his seat. Following Freuden, the students of his faction rose up.Before Freuden left, he glanced at Rudger, who was sitting in the professor\u2019s seat.Freuden, who stared at him for a moment, turned his gaze away as if he was not interested and left the training ground.One by one, people left and talked loudly about the events of the duel.\u201cThis.\u201dAidan scratched his head. He originally had no intention of using anti-magic in this battle. No, he had no intention of using it in the future while he was in Theon.His master told him that this magic was very important and not to use it unless he\u2019s in a crisis or else he\u2019ll be in trouble.\u2018This is what Master said.\u2019Seeing the passionate eyes of the students, Aidan instinctively sensed that his academy life would be really hard in the future.\u2018Ouch.\u2019Aidan immediately turned to the place where the teacher\u2019s seat was. He looked for Rudger, who had helped him win this fight. Fortunately, Rudger remained there, and finding him was not difficult because his black outfit stood out.Rudger had a normal face. He wasn\u2019t particularly or visibly happy that he won the duel. After making eye contact without saying a word Rudger nodded his head.\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dOf course, that alone was enough for Aidan.\u201cAidan!\u201d\u201cGood job! You won!\u201dTracy and Leo approached Aidan and smiled broadly. Aidan looked at his friends and smiled.After watching the three of them for a moment, Rudger stood up. The match is over, now it\u2019s time to look at other things.\u201cMr. Chris.\u201dChris Benimore, who had been sitting uncomfortable all the time, trembled at Rudger\u2019s call.His gaze turned to Rudger.\u201cWe still have business to finish.\u201dAt those words, Chris\u2019 face fell even more horribly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 50": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Academy\u2019s Undercover ProfessorCH 50Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayC50: Anti Magic (2)Chris thought that it had finally come. He had offered to bet with Rudger and the loser will hand over one of the magic research papers to the winner.It was Chris himself, no one else, who suggested this. Since he declared in front of many students that he would bet on it, he couldn\u2019t even say no.\u201cDid you know that commoner student possess anti-magic?\u201d\u201cYes. That\u2019s right.\u201dChris cried out with tears in his eyes at the answer that seemed to come in as if it was natural.\u201cDid you make this bet knowing that?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t understand why Mr. Chris is so angry.\u201d\u201cYou say that now\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cMr. Chris, didn\u2019t you know that Aidan was the possessor of anti-magic?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dAt those words, Chris was stunned. It was as Rudger said, he did not know that Aidan possessed anti-magic.\u201cI heard that Mr. Chris is in charge of the first year, but didn\u2019t you check the first-year students who were admitted this time?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cAbove all, Aidan never used anti-magic during the match. Did you see that his mastery of anti-magic had an effect on the victory or defeat of the match?\u201dChris shut his mouth.As Rudger said, Chris was not in a position to dare to argue with the result of the match. The fact that he didn\u2019t know was his fault since he didn\u2019t check the students.Because Aidan was a trivial commoner he was unimportant. The narrow-minded thought he always had turned into a boomerang, and hit him in the back.Who is to blame for that? Rudger who knew but didn\u2019t say it? Aidan who learned anti-magic even though he is a commoner?It was his fault because he made no thorough preparations, and without even thinking of gathering information beforehand, he just assumed that he was going to win. His arrogance was the cause of his defeat.\u201cIf you had checked the students, something like today would not have happened.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dChris didn\u2019t answer. Yes. It was obviously his mistake for not taking the duel seriously.However, what hurts his pride more than that is that the outcome of this match was not determined by the anti-magic. Aidan didn\u2019t even use the anti-magic during the duel. He used only what he had after he came to Theon and defeated Jevan.Seeing Chris trembling and not saying anything, Rudger continued.\u201cI remember that we bet on an academic thesis on magic.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026We did. What can I give you?\u201d\u201cNothing.\u201dChris was perplexed at that.\u201cWhat the heck\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cI am not taking anything.\u201d\u201cWhy all of a sudden\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cNot all of a sudden. This is what I was thinking from the beginning.\u201dChris couldn\u2019t understand Rudger\u2019s words. No, he actually understood but wanted to deny it.\u201cIt is inferior to extort other people\u2019s teachings in bets.\u201dAfter saying those words, Rudger turned his back and left.At that sight, Chris turned into a bewildered person.He wasn\u2019t even this annoyed when he was ignored by him, or when he lost the bet. But even though Rudger won the bet, he did not receive anything from him, but when he said that the act of betting itself was inferior Chris felt more than annoyed, he also felt a sense of disappointment.The mirror of the heart that reflects the ugly side of the man, the more he stared at him with hostility and hatred, the more disgusting he was, and the more it reflected on him.\u2018Me, this Chris Benimore\u2026\u2026Are you saying I\u2019m inferior?\u2019 Chris bit his lip. A stream of blood ran down the corner of his mouth. He didn\u2019t even think to clean it. He was just staring at Rudger\u2019s back with a blood-soaked look in his eyes.\u2018Rudger Chelici.\u2019How much longer do you have to trample on my pride? Next time, for sure, I will pay back the disgrace I suffered this time.\u201cMr. Chris.\u201dHugo approached and called him, but Chris didn\u2019t respond. Now he didn\u2019t want to show anyone this ugly figure, so he hurriedly ran away from his seat.Hugo contorted his face at the sight, but then saw the president looking over and smiling softly, and he couldn\u2019t help but swallow his annoyance. This event will be remembered as a shameful day for the aristocrats.\u2018Rudger Chelici.\u2019Thinking of the man who caused all this Hugo Burtag grimaced inwardly.* * *Aidan, drunk with the joy of victory with his friends, suddenly remembered the promise he had made with Jevan. He staggered his gaze and turned to Jevan, who stood up from.The three of them looked into each other\u2019s eyes and then nodded their heads towards Jevan.\u201cWhat?\u201dJevan looked at Aidan and his friends coming towards him and asked with a weak voice.\u201cYou came to laugh at me?\u201d\u201cJevan, have you forgotten the promise you made before the duel?\u201dAt the word of promise, Jevan\u2019s face wrinkled. He couldn\u2019t even think about it because he couldn\u2019t break free from the shock of defeat.\u201cJevan Pellio politely apologize right now for being harsh to my friends.\u201d\u201cNow, you dare\u2026\u2026Make me apologize?\u201d\u201cYou were the first to place a bet and apply for a duel Jevan. I\u2019m just telling you to keep it. Come on, apologize respectfully.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dJevan clenched his fists tightly, but that was all. He was completely defeated by Aidan and even his surprise attack was unsuccessful. He didn\u2019t just lose, he was totally defeated. There was no place for him to stand in Theon any longer.\u201cDamn it. All because of you! Because of you I\u2026\u2026!\u201d\u201cJevan.\u201d\u201cShut up! Don\u2019t call my name! If it wasn\u2019t for you, I wouldn\u2019t have gone through such an ugly thing in front of everyone! Yes! It\u2019s all your fault!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dSeeing Jevan talking half-dazed, Tracy wanted to say something but Aidan raised his hand and stopped her.\u201cAidan. Why?\u201d\u201cBecause there\u2019s no use going on.\u201dAidan knew that no matter what Tracy said, Jevan wouldn\u2019t listen. Aidan realized something when he saw the behavior that Jevan was showing.He believed that people fight because they don\u2019t know each other, and once they get to know each other, the story will be different.Meanwhile, Jevan cried even more desperately.\u201cDamn it! Damn it! Because of you filthy commoners, I can\u2019t stay in Theon anymore! We, the Pellio family, can\u2019t raise their heads no matter where we go! Because of you! Because of you!\u201dJevan had already erased the foul or cowardly act he had committed from his memory. He simply couldn\u2019t bear it because he was so angry that he had to go through this.\u201cWhy! Why do people like you have such powers? Why don\u2019t I have it?\u201d\u201cJevan.\u201d\u201cDamn it. Damn it I just\u2026\u2026I just wanted to increase the reputation of the family!\u201dJevan bowed his head and screamed. He wouldn\u2019t have stopped if he knew it was the wrong way because he only aimed for that purpose.Aidan looked at Jevan like that and tried to say something, but then shut his mouth. Far from receiving an apology from Jevan in that state, it was difficult to continue a proper conversation.Even Tracy, who would normally be angry, was silent as she saw Jevan that was ruined.To raise the status of the family, she also felt a sensation as if her chest was tightening at the appearance of Jevan acting like that.\u2018Maybe I, too, might have become like that.\u2019When she thought of that, she trembled in fear but at that moment, a cold voice fell between them.\u201cThe match is over, what are you still doing here?\u201d\u201cMr. Rudger.\u201dDressed in an all-black outfit, Rudger exuded a strange atmosphere that could not be resisted. He stared at Aidan and his friends, then slumped down in his seat and fired a cold shot at the crying Jevan.\u201cJevan Pellio, after losing the duel, what are you acting in an unsightly way?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t accept your defeat and even made an ugly surprise attack and then shed tears because it was so unfair? Do you deserve it now?\u201d\u201cMr. Rudger.\u201dAidan called but Rudger continued.\u201cThe way you are now, isn\u2019t it much worse than the commoners you used to hate and despise so much?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026What do you know?\u201dIn the end, Jevan, unable to bear it, jumped up and looked at Rudger.\u201cYou don\u2019t know how I feel!\u201d\u201cShould I know?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026What?\u201d\u201cDo I really need to know that?\u201d\u201cThis person\u2026\u2026!\u201dJevan was about to shout something, but when he met Rudger\u2019s eyes, the burning anger was quickly extinguished, and fear took its place.Rudger\u2019s cold gaze staring at him was like he faced a nightmare in the pitch black darkness.\u201cYou fought at will, and lost at your own bet. You didn\u2019t accept even that but you want others to measure your feelings. Why do I need to know how you feel?\u201d\u201cThat, that\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cDo you think this is still your family? Do I look like a nanny who listens to your complaints?\u201d\u201cI, I\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cYou, who do not know how shameful your actions are, are disqualified as a wizard. What is a noble and what is a wizard?\u201dUnlike the usual Rudger, Jevan couldn\u2019t keep his sanity at the almost violent words.\u201cI, I\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cNoisy. I don\u2019t even want to listen to your excuses. What you did a while ago will be referred to the disciplinary committee, so know that and get out of my sight right now.\u201dJevan, whose complexion had turned pale, backtracked and then fled out of the arena.\u201cAidan.\u201d\u201cYes, teacher.\u201d\u201cYou have successfully used the [Moving-Magus]. Well done.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s all thanks to teacher.\u201d\u201cBut it didn\u2019t look too good.\u201d\u201cThat\u2026\u2026.\u201dAidan couldn\u2019t understand why he was feeling so down. Obviously, in front of everyone, he won the duel brilliantly.\u201cWell\u2026\u2026I do not know.\u201d\u201cYou do not know?\u201d\u201cAt first, obviously, there was a sense of exhilaration. Jevan insulted my friends and argued with me. My desire to defeat all of those things has definitely not changed. But\u2026\u2026After that, it was a problem.\u201d\u201cDid you get swayed by that nonsense?\u201d\u201cObviously I didn\u2019t have to listen to that. Yes. It ignored it.\u201dAidan smiled bitterly and spoke frankly.Rudger looked at Aidan without a word. He knew from before that Aidan was overly just and had the right values, but he didn\u2019t expect his heart to be this weak.He had sympathy for even Jevan, who had been ignoring and looking down on him. Aidan is a young student who is part of the brilliant world called Theon. He was young he couldn\u2019t blame him for being stupid or stuffy because that was the way a child looked at the world.\u201cAidan.\u201d\u201cTeacher.\u201d\u201cAs you go through life, you will run into various people.\u201d\u201cYeah?\u201d\u201cNot everyone is like you. Some people will hate you and even be hostile to you. In the end, that\u2019s it. Your world is different from others.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Is that so.\u201d\u201cBut it depends on how you behave.\u201dAt those words, Aidan, Tracy, and Leo looked at Rudger slightly surprised.\u201cThere is nothing wrong with trying to take care of yourself and it\u2019s not stupid to give up everything you have but in the end, all you need to live in this world is moderation.\u201d\u201cAppropriate\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cAidan\u2019s selfishness and altruism are about half and half. If I yield half instead of taking half to someone the day will come when we will understand each other to some extent.\u201dWith that said, Aidan turned to Tracy. He clearly remembers his first meeting with her and that she wasn\u2019t all that good. Tracy was like a rose full of thorns; however, from a certain moment, the two became attached to each other.\u201cI will not tell you not to yield to anyone or not to be considerate because that is impossible. I\u2019m saying that it\u2019s okay to be at least half selfish.\u201dAt those words, Aidan felt as if he was about to catch something.\u201cI talked too much. I\u2019ll go now.\u201d\u201cMr. Rudger!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI will definitely remember what\u00a0 you said.\u201dRudger glanced back at Aidan, who answered with a determined face, and then left the arena with a light nod of his head.The three of them stared at Rudger\u2019s back without saying a word until he disappeared.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
