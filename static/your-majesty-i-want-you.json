Some scenes may have you feeling sick to the core. Be warned. Don\u2019t read if you can\u2019t handle the first arc.The hunters returned with their hunted beasts at dusk. Echoing sounds of merry laughter, chatters, hoofing, and ironing quickly spread all around, creating a noisy environment.The Emperor, sitting under a large shaded area, frowned faintly. She was forced to watch the event despite her blatant despise of hunting for the sake of mere amusement. As the scent of the beasts neared closer, the Emperor endured, feeling slightly nauseated.The nobles who arrived before her proudly displayed their beasts they\u2019d caught during their hunt for it was the Emperor\u2019s decision to distinguish the honorable and award the title of winner among the participants.After a brief discussion, the candidate for the prize was picked \u2013\u2013 Countess Francis. She caught a fox with vivid red fur\u2026 the others caught a humongous boar, a surprisingly rare silver deer species, and\u2026The Emperor turned her gaze away from the last candidate and raised her finger to the fox.\u201cThe bright vivid scarlet caught my eyes. There are a few scratches on the leather, proving the hunter\u2019s skills are excellent. That\u2019s a fact. Countess Francis, you are this year\u2019s winner.\u201dIt was considered a great honor to win the Konkuk Hunting Competition.The Countess was surprised. Not only her but the others hungry for the title.The Countess quickly knelt down on her knees and spoke in a polite manner.\u201cIt is of great honor for Her Majesty to find my humble hunting skills appreciable, but, it\u2019s too much of an honor for someone like me. With all due respect, Your Majesty, it would be reasonable to grant the honorary title to Grand Duke Roark for the capture of the rare and beautiful silver deer.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re too reasonable. It\u2019s a valid decision and a reasonable one choosing you as the honorary winner. Behold, the Marquise\u2019s wild boar was stabbed in the guts, its skin all damaged, and the Grand Duke Roark\u2019s deer looks promising but its mouth is bloodstained, a sign of harassment through the passing hours without intentionally killing it. On the other hand, your fox, it has no blemishes except for the fatal wound in its neck. From the strike alone, your intent was to lessen the fox\u2019s pain. In hunting, one must be polite and respectful when taking a life. Sure, there are others who\u2019d hunted far better ones than you, but there is no hunter here more qualified than you.\u201dAt the Emperor\u2019s reasoning, the Countess could no longer remain stubborn.\u201cYes. Thank you, Your Majesty.\u201dShe responded and bowed her head.Only then did sounds of applause rang out.Now that the winner had been decided, it was time to return to the Imperial Palace and enjoy the banquet in celebration of the 200th anniversary of the empire\u2019s inception. This year\u2019s banquet was rumored to be far grander and bigger than its previous predecessors.As the servants diligently waited on their masters to make their way over after the game, the Marquis of Bjorn approached Grand Roark, who at this time, climbed his steed.\u201cI don\u2019t understand, Grand Duke. Isn\u2019t this the prize you deserve? Oh my god, to choose a fox over a silver deer? Her Majesty believes herself to be too knowledgeable. I hope you\u2019re not feeling too hung up over it.\u201d\u201cNo, Her Majesty is right. I was so excited when I found the silver deer that I\u2019d forgotten the etiquette and mannerisms one must keep. The Emperor was able to enlighten me. That much is enough.\u201dThe Marquis grumbled at the Grand Duke\u2019s humble words.\u201cYou\u2019re the most loyal subject in the empire. I do not know why Her Majesty would\u2026\u201d\u201cMarquis.\u201dThe Grand Duke cut his word shortly and his pupils shone a cold, bloody red.The Marquis grew nervous and swallowed the dry saliva in his throat. He\u2019d been guarding the border half his lifetime. And though he was older, the Marquis was confident that he wasn\u2019t lagging behind the young ones. But now, he was like a mouse who had met a tiger \u2013\u2013 that tiger was the Grand Duke who was younger than his son.\u201cWatch your mouth, Marquis. There are many knowing ears. And you, a noble, should mind what you say.\u201dAt the end of the sentence, the Grand Duke pulled on the steed\u2019s reins and approached the carriage the Emperor was on.Looking at the Grand Duke\u2019s back, the Marquis of Bjorn swallowed his cursing. He didn\u2019t want to admit a young man put him in his place. The thought of it angered him so.\u2018That bastard! Does he not know that his nickname is the loyal dog of the Emperor? What ears?! Aren\u2019t you the Emperor\u2019s knowing ear\u2026?!\u2019When the Grand Duke stood behind the Emperor\u2019s carriage, like an escort, the carriage suddenly stopped and the window curtain opened.The Emperor\u2019s face was shown. She looked like she had caught motion sickness.\u201cAre you all right, Your Majesty?\u201dThe Grand Duke Roark approached the carriage and thrusted out his handkerchief.The Emperor turned her head coldly, staring at the handkerchief and at the Grand Duke\u2019s face before pulling the curtains to a close without a word.Shame as it might be, the Grand Duke casually handed the handkerchief to a nearby maid.\u201cYou may need it. Keep it for use.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe maid\u2019s face reddened as she shyly accepted the Grand Duke\u2019s handkerchief. The maid, for a brief moment, could hardly comprehend the Emperor who disregarded the wonderful and friendly man\u2019s kindness.All the way to the Imperial Palace, the Emperor did not request for the handkerchief, allowing the maid to enjoy the small fortune of keeping the Grand Duke\u2019s personal belonging.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",

It was a shame the Emperor could not play with them.When the Emperor returned to her quarters, she immediately changed into comfortable attire and pulled off the robes that seemed to weigh her down. She felt a little relieved. But then she remembered those red bloody eyes and it caused her to stumble, albeit slightly.He must have been dissatisfied with the results of the Konkuk Hunting Competition, but that didn\u2019t matter much to the Emperor. She\u2019d been worrying lately to the point of her health deteriorating.The Emperor sighed, a little too heavily.\u201cYour Majesty, how about dinner?\u201d Asked the maid standing beside her.\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d The Emperor shook her head slowly. In her current condition, she barely had the appetite.She sat down in a chair, holding back her dizziness. She felt light-headed. Her work was endless and she could not skip it. Her royal duties forbade her to.There was a roar of laughter, shouting, and music in the distance. They usually had the bearing of a decent aristocrat, but today, all their masks fell off. They drank as much as they were given in excitement; even shouted and roared in merriness.The Emperor suddenly remembered the figure of a man.Was he playing part in the fuss? He\u2019d probably whisk a noble lady off her feet and pull her closer for a kiss.The Emperor bit her lip. No matter. Whatever he did was none of her business.She focused her mind on the letters, trying to dispel her mixed feelings. Fortunately, she was able to drown herself in her work, forgetting the outside noise and the man\u2019s face.She did not know how long time had passed. She looked up, realizing someone was knocking on the door.\u201cWho\u2026\u201dThe door sprang open without warning.\u201cAre you still drowning in paperwork?\u201dA tall man set foot in the Emperor\u2019s bedroom without permission. The Emperor slowly raised her head, not replying.\u201cI thought it\u2019d be alright. You didn\u2019t answer and you looked distracted.\u201dHe clicked his tongue. The Emperor looked at the door. Before she knew it, the maids were gone.She couldn\u2019t keep them if she wanted to. They weren\u2019t her people. From the closest attendant to the escort knight and all those assisting her in the inner circle, they were not hers.As she heard the door closing, the Emperor\u2019s face turned white.\u201cThe banquet hadn\u2019t finished yet. Why not enjoy it some more?\u201d She tried to stay calm, but she could not help but let out a shaking voice.\u201cThe Emperor\u2019s not feeling well. We can\u2019t enjoy the feast in peace. As your servant, it is my duty to check on your well-being.\u201dThe man\u2019s tone was full of worries, but the Emperor knew it was all a lie.\u201cI\u2019m fine, so\u2026\u201dShe was keen on ordering the man to head back to the banquet, but before she could, the man quickly came up to her. A light flashed across his face; it was incredibly beautiful.But to the Emperor, his eyes looked like a messenger from hell.Matter of fact, he did take and killed countless of lives.The man reached out and stroked her face and neck. The Emperor shook off his hand. Rather than an angry gesture of his rudeness, her actions looked more like a desperate gesture of a frightened animal.The man grabbed the Emperor\u2019s hand and kissed it lightly.\u201cYou look pale. I\u2019m worried because you\u2019re always pushing yourself too hard.\u201d\u201c\u2026.Yes, I\u2019ll need to take a rest today. So, why don\u2019t you go back now, too.\u201dThe Emperor took a step backward and shook her head.The man, he was the Grand Duke who had red eyes the color of blood. She was always frightened when facing him, even more so when she saw innocent blood today; she trembled remembering the face of the silver deer.\u201cOf course, I\u2019ll go back. After making sure your jade body isn\u2019t feeling uncomfortable.\u201dThe Grand Duke smiled softly. Then he placed his hand on the Emperor\u2019s back waist, who at this time, stumbled.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 3": "Chapter 3 - Desire You (1)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 3: Desire You (1)Due to the wide difference in power, the Emperor was forced into the arms of the Grand Duke. She was taken away by him. She wasn\u2019t short as a woman, by no means, but the Grand Duke, he was tall to the point that she could hide her entire body when hugged by him.The Grand Duke\u2019s temperature was hotter than usual. The area that seemed hotter was the thing that poked her in the stomach. The Emperor looked down, stunned at the thing\u2019s flaunting presence that hid behind the Grand Duke\u2019s attire.\u2018I hadn\u2019t done anything\u2026\u2019But that wasn\u2019t the point. She recalled that all she wore was a thin nightgown. It was her regret thinking that she\u2019d not meet anyone until dawn. The Emperor shook her head bitterly.The Grand Duke lifted up her quivering chin.As their eyes met, the Emperor shrugged off her nervousness and closed her eyes tightly.\u201cPlease, I don\u2019t feel like it today\u2026\u201dIn front of him, neither the Emperor\u2019s dignity nor authority would do her any good. All she could do was plead.\u201cNormally, I would ascend to your request, but I can\u2019t do it today either.\u201d It was a half-joking tone, but his voice was subdued with a deep sense of honesty.The Grand Duke eased off his grip on her waist; the wind brought down the hem of her dress, revealing her alluring shoulders and upper chest.She had fair skin, the Emperor, and seductive neck and clear skin that, strangely, could stimulate men. Then, her naked body was pecked away and her panties ripped open and fell to the floor.\u201cI\u2019m really not feeling well today. Please go back for now.\u201dThe Emperor tried to act coolly and calmly, but her mind went black when seized by a big hand. She tried to twist her body out of the Grand Duke\u2019s embrace, but the more she resisted, the closer she was to his chest.With all his might, the Grand Duke remained as still as a rock. Unlike his obedient self, he was a completely different person.He relentlessly and resolutely suppressed the Emperor\u2019s resistance, then dipped his head and kissed her long neck, upwards to her lips; as if heated by the sensation, he gradually slid downward and bit off her erect bosom.\u201cAh\u2026!\u201dWith her sensitive spot bitten, a small moan broke out unknowingly.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but it might be a little rough today,\u201d the Grand Duke whispered with her bosom in his mouth.Was he upset because of the hunting competition, or was it because she ignored him in the carriage?She did not know.\u201cIt was just a prey that I thought would please Your Majesty. Didn\u2019t you like it?\u201d the Grand Duke spoke again.He grabbed her chest, flicking his finger over her erected spot, albeit somewhat painfully.The Emperor managed to answer, quelling the mysterious pain arising from within. \u201cI swear I didn\u2019t mean to denigrate your kill. But your methods are too cruel\u2026 I\u2019m sorry if I offended you.\u201dThe Grand Duke looked up at the Emperor. There was a smile on his cool mouth.\u201cYour Highness\u2026 I wasn\u2019t asking asking about that.\u201d He kissed her on the cheek and whispered, a faint smell of wine in his breath.Only then did the Emperor realized that she had been deceived, again.The Grand Duke turned her helplessly up and prostrated her upper body on a table strewn with papers.\u201cWait a minute. I don\u2019t like this\u2026\u201d\u201cLies. Don\u2019t you like it best when you\u2019re stabbed from the back?\u201dHe licked her entrance, tasting her whole. The Emperor shuddered.\u201cNo, I\u2026!\u201dShe denied strongly, but she could not keep a proper stance.\u201cYour Highness is very cute. I would do as you ask of me, but today, I can\u2019t. I don\u2019t want to hurt you, so please, relax,\u201d he said gently.She knew he was reaching his patience and limits.In the end, the Emperor lowered her eyes. She had given up. She\u2019s learned from experience that it was better to give him what he wanted.The words on the document was blaring. It was the document she had been looking at a while ago.\u3010Report On the Port Trade In the Torner Sea\u3011She recklessly read out the letters to forget her current situation. She needed something to make her forget, even if she knew it would be of no use.\u201cDon\u2019t think about anything else. I\u2019m starting to get annoyed.\u201dThe Grand Duke clapped her perky butt with his big hand. It didn\u2019t hurt, but that alone made her dizzy.The Emperor nodded hurriedly. She had to please him first. Soon, he unwrapped his trouser buckle and placed his shaft next to her womanhood.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She wanted to get this over with as soon as possible and have the Grand Duke satisfy his own lust so he can go away. She wasn\u2019t in the mood. However, her body was nervous that she wasn\u2019t able to open up easily. And most of all, he was too big to begin with for her to accept him even when she was dripping wet.After a series of failed inserts, he grew irritated.\u201cReally, you\u2019re such a handful.\u201dAn angry and untold desire smeared his every word. The Emperor trembled and awaited for her punishment. The Grand Duke held her neck and laid her upper body completely on the table.The trade report document crumbled up. She could feel the paper getting wet from her tears. By tomorrow, it\u2019s unlikely that she\u2019ll be able to recognize the document report.\u2018I can\u2019t\u2026\u2019His long fingers touched her flowerpot; her thoughts faded to white.The frightened Emperor raised her body reflexively. The Grand Duke placed his hand on her gently to keep her from moving. In the meantime, his finger slid deeper inside her.\u201cHhh\u2026\u201dHer dried-up flowerpot was tightly closed, refusing to allow anyone entrance, but still, he moved his finger back and forth.Without consideration, the Emperor muttered out in pain.\u201cIt\u2026 hurts\u2026\u201dShe gasped for breath, feeling his finger wriggling inside her. A hand with nowhere to go clutched the papers on the table, her joints turning white. Moans of pain mingled with swishing sound.\u201cOnly one finger is in. Don\u2019t be afraid.\u201dThe Grand Duke spoke coldly. It wasn\u2019t too painful, as he said. It was the fear that overpowered the pain she felt.A little while later, her little tight nether region loosened slightly; one more finger dug in without missing a gap.\u201cAhh\u2026!\u201dEvery time his finger stabbed her garden, her body rose slightly to the beat. The flickering sound further aroused her shame and the Grand Duke was aware of it, even relished in it.His grip on her waist quickly turned red. Every time she felt his fingering, her insides tightened.\u201cYou must be feeling better, seeing you bite my finger like this.\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about\u2026?\u201dThe Emperor shook her head vigorously. But, surely, a little tickling was mixed in with the dull pain. She was slowly getting wet, proving true to his words.She closed her eyes tightly and tried to calm down her burning body. Contrary to her intention, she could feel the tingling sensation from her lower area.\u201cNo\u2026\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s another woman like you. Surely, you feel the pleasure but you\u2019re resisting so fiercely. It\u2019s amusing. Looks like I\u2019ll have to work harder.\u201dAs he said so, he steadily worked his fingers inside her. His skill was smoother than before, but it wasn\u2019t enough. The sound the Emperor made was akin to a painful groan than sweet, melodic moans.The Grand Duke briefly clicked his tongue and rubbed her sweet spot, his thumb covered in fluids that dripped out.\u201cAh\u2026.\u201dLike an open dam, the Emperor twisted her back unknowingly and let out a shriek. She could hear his dull laugh, her face red with shame.\u201cHa\u2026 no\u2026 don\u2019t\u2026\u201d\u201cBut you\u2019re holding on to me too tight.\u201d\u201cNo, no\u2026! Unnh\u2026.\u201dThe fingers that rubbed her sensitive areas poked her over and over. The Emperor shook her hips to avoid his hand. But to the Grand Duke, her action looked all too different, almost like she was enjoying it. The last resistance and patience from his handsome face soon disappeared.His fingering became rough all of a sudden. The tickling sensation of her lower abdomen turned to something prickly. The burning heat in her nerves seemed to be concentrated from below.The Emperor shook her head vigorously, suppressing a groan that was about to leak. The thin string that tied her hair broke and a long, golden hair cascaded down and covered her back. The Grand Duke, who was focused on her flowerpot, suddenly stopped.Was he finished?She hoped so and took this time to breathe.His hand, which held her head, fell down to her neck, caressed it, then combed his fingers through her light, golden hair; and then his lips fell on hers. The Emperor did not resist, afraid the man\u2019s fingers would work again.As if praising her for her immobility, the Grand Duke kissed her neck and ear affectionately. And much to her expectancy, his fingers started moving again and pricked her insides. Unlike his lips, his hands moved roughly. There was wet sounds that played out each time he moved in and out.\u201cJust\u2026 nghh\u2026 I\u2019d rather just do it\u2026\u201d\u201cYour Majesty is too confident. If we continue like that, we\u2019ll probably keep on going till tomorrow.\u201d\u201cPlease\u2026\u201dHe continued to rub her tenaciously. Love juice overflowed and dripped down her thighs.\u201cDo you really hate it?\u201d\u201cI\u2026 stop\u2026 please\u2026\u201dThe Emperor sobbed and pleaded. Tears trickled down her eyes; it was one of absolute misery and shame. She was the Emperor of the empire \u2013\u2013 she held the throne, but here she was crying on the table and being held down by a man beneath her no less. He wasn\u2019t even properly undressed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I am your eternal servant. You need not be ashamed,\u201d the duke growled in her ears.He liked this. It was amazing. Why does such an amazing woman exist? He loved looking at her, loved watching her growing full of shame and loved her response. Deep down, he knew she loved the humiliation.The Emperor could not think clearly. Her fingers were tightened deepy and her toes curled, her garden continuously provoked from an outside invasion.\u201cAh\u2026 haah\u2026\u201dAt last, she was at her wits end and nearing climax. She sobbed out a soft moan while her waist, hips, and thighs trembled violently. Her wet insides convulsed as she bit her lip, attempting to contain her escaped groan.Once her body calmed, she breathed and stretched her body on the table. Tears streamed down her pretty face.It was over.No it was not.It was just beginning.\u201cYour Majesty,\u201d the Grand Duke called out to her soothingly.\u201cThat\u2019s enough\u2026\u201d She wanted this to finish, but her body was weak. She could not lift a finger even if she tried. \u201cAah\u2026\u201dShe moaned, again, feeling her lower body tightly opened. The Grand Duke inserted his manhood inside her, slow and steady.The Emperor closed her eyes, feeling a distinct thickness digging her insides. It was hard to tell what she was feeling \u2013\u2013 fear or excitement?\u201cHaaa\u2026\u201d he sighed deeply, inserting all of him inside her roots. Then, he bent forward and kissed her weet cheek. \u201cI would have never expect an Emperor as beautiful and alluring as you to exist in this sinful world. Any man would shrivel up once they have a taste of you, my dear angel. And I know for one that I am addicted.\u201d\u201cStop\u2026 please\u2026\u201dThe Grand Duke, all at once, plunged his sh*ft deep inside her.\u201cNnngh\u2026\u201dHe had endured long enough; he began to move back and forth. The Emperor\u2019s body swayed at his gesture.\u201cAh\u2026 haaah\u2026 haa\u2026.\u201dBurst of desires roused her delicate flesh that was being rammed over and over. Every time his manhood pierced her garden, her eyes seemed to flash white. Before she knew, her inner walls that had been gently loosened clung obscenely to his manhood. She felt ashamed.Her moans of denial became one of acceptance and fear turned to one of excitement. She shook her hips frantically to match his movements. The sordid sounds of flesh meeting one another and separating only to meet again rang through the Emperor\u2019s bedroom quarters.The Grand Duke, who held her waist and pelvis strong enough to leave a hand print, slowly raised the Emperor\u2019s long hair with one hand and raised her upper body. The Emperor swallowed her breath and instinctively grabbed the documents on sprawled on the table. The papers crumpled under her grasp.He pounded her, again and again, his sh*ft poking her insides while her chest shook up and down. Her bosom, he found it enthralling, so he clasped her ch*st and pinched her hardened n*pple with profound excitement.\u201cAh!\u201d The Emperor yelped, immediately biting her lips to hold back her groan.The Grand Duke opened her mouth forcefully and slipped a finger in \u2013\u2013 it moved inside her mouth and explored every single inch of her. Froths of wet saliva slipped out of her mouth and covered his palm.The Emperor was at nigh pleasure; he pulled her hair harder.\u201cNothing good comes from being stubborn, Your Majesty,\u201d his voice seemed lower and rough, more so than the usual.\u201cNo\u2026 I\u2026 ah\u2026\u201dEnjoying her attempts to deny herself, the Grand Duke pulled his manhood out for a slight moment before plunging deeper and harder inside her. The shock sent her toes curling tightly, her lips wide open and leaking erotic sounds.\u201cAh\u2026 ah\u2026 hah\u2026\u201d she moaned. \u201c\u2026ha\u2026\u201dHe fooled around with her mouth, \u2018till finally, he was fully satisfied.

But he could not. She was unique and once broken, the damage could never be undone. The Grand Duke held himself back and kissed her cheek.\u201cYou amaze me, Your Majesty.\u201dThe Emperor moaned in reply. She was nearing close to climax, he could tell. He pulled out of her for a moment and turned her body around, her back now lying on the table and her front facing him.\u201cHaaa\u2026. what\u2026\u201dThe Grand Duke stretched out her legs and hung it over his shoulder and pulled her hips closer to him. Subconsciously, the Emperor clenched the edge of the table as if she was going to fall. It was an uncomfortable position, but it was better than holding on to the Grand Duke.He seemed to have read her mind; he snorted.The Emperor habitually lowered her gaze and saw histhing.It was long, thick, and ugly. How it managed to fit\u2026 she did not know\u2026Feeling her gaze, the Grand Duke smirked and drove his m*nhood inside her, penetrating her wet insides easily.\u201cYour Majesty, do you see how well your hole swallows men? Sometimes I feel like I shouldn\u2019t be the only one to monopolize this er*tic hole.

That\u2019s\u2026\u201d the Emperor shook her head desperately and shut her eyes.The Grand Duke kissed her closed eyelids, wiping away the tears flowing from the corner of her eyes. He tightened his grip on her waist lightly as if to punish her for keeping her eyes closed.The Emperor was in danger, she was close to reaching her peak climax. But the Grand Duke did not go easy on her and continued hammering and thr*sting inside her.\u201cYour Majesty, I want to see the face you\u2019ll make.\u201d\u201cAahhhh\u2026 haaaaa..!\u201d the Emperor could not reply for a rush of pleasure drowned her whole body. Her body and head rose high in the air and her ch*st heaved dramatically. She felt weak. Eventually, she fell back but she did not feel the pain from falling for the Grand Duke wrapped his arms around her back and head to prevent herself from falling hard.When she opened her eyes, she saw bright red eyes before her. She was afraid and tried to turn her head but the Grand Duke locked her lips with his before she could move.\u201cNnmm\u2026\u201dHis waist stopped moving as he focused on the kiss. Meanwhile, he clutched on the Emperor\u2019s p*lvis while hot liquid caressed her insides. It was not until the last drop was released inside her that he removed his m*nhood.The Emperor, weak, drooped on the table. She wanted to leave and wash herself thoroughly but she was too tired to lift a finger. She was completely exhausted while the Grand Duke was still full of energy and vigor.\u201cPlease stop\u2026\u201d the Emperor implored with great difficulty. But that was a mistake. Her voice sounded ever so sensual and carnal, causing her partner\u2019s genitals to harden again.The Emperor\u2019s face turned white. \u201cNo, I can\u2019t do this anymore\u2026\u201dBut he did not comply. He stretched her legs open. Again.The Emperor and the Grand Duke drowned in euphoria all night long.***Aranrhod Linister, Aran for short, was the 17th Emperor of the Linister Empire. It was purely thanks to Grand Duke Roark that she was able to overtake Orabi\u2019s throne and become Emperor.She was a daughter born to the imperial family. The previous Emperor thought her precious. She monopolized his love the moment she was conceived into the world. But despite the great love shown towards her, she was far from power for the first prince, five years older than her, had already been designated as successor and the crown prince. Moreover, the Emperor wished for his daughter to live in peace with a husband who loved her dearly rather than to jump into troublesome political disputes.The Emperor who loved his daughter far too much had once tried to marry her to a nobleman of low nobility who had little to no ambition of seeking power for he feared she may die in the process. He sought to have his daughter live a peaceful life even after marriage. But the Empress objected. The man she was to marry was unqualified and unfitting of her status so the Emperor was forced to create a list of men who had nothing but good looks and redeeming qualities.Under her father\u2019s extreme love and affection, Aran grew up as innocent and beautiful as a deer. Her weakness was her innocence, but that, too, was her strength.At the age of thirteen, a marriage agreement was made to Enoch Roark, son of Prince Roark. The Emperor disapproved of Enoch, stating his red eyes full of rebelliousness. But Aran disagreed. She was fascinated at once by him.On the other hand, Enoch, who was sixteen at the time, was not particularly attracted to her. Still, as her fianc\u00e9, he treated her with courtesy and politeness.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

A year after their marriage agreement, the Grand National Party revolted. Enoch Roark\u2019s mother and father were found guilty and executed immediately. Enoch\u2019s life was saved by Aran\u2019s innocent cries and pleading, her arms wrapped around him. Though he was demoted as a common folk thereafter, he did not become a slave. Meanwhile, Aran refused to eat her food for three days straight, causing the king to become nervous. He quickly placed Enoch inside the royal palace for fear that his precious daughter may do something tragic.Although no longer her fianc\u00e9, Aran took care of Enoch gently. There were times she intoxicated herself in the thought that she was the only one who could help the man she was infatuated with and content that her lover was safe despite his tragic fate. There were times she saw Enoch weeping in tears and she did nothing but wrap her arms around him like the time she pleaded for his life.Unfortunately, her happiness ended as quickly as her marriage agreement. Her most reliable ally, her parents, met a tragic accident during their journey. The emperor died instantly and the empress became crippled and confined to bed.The crown prince ascended the throne and immediately enlisted Enoch in the army, kicking him out of the royal palace. Aran desperately opposed the idea, but her brother, Ourabi, was not her father. Ourabi noticed Aran\u2019s beauty and femininity. He planned to sell her to the wealthy Marquis Maxwell. The Marquis was an old man fifty years older than Aran.The newly ascended emperor, Ourabi, pushed for the wedding of Aran and Marquis days after his ascension.On the day of their wedding, Enoch, who infiltrated the royal palace in advance, made his appearance. The imperial family and their loyal subjects were beheaded by his soldier. Aranrhod Linister was the only surviving royal blood.Enoch spoke in a carefree tone as he looked up at his ex-fianc\u00e9\u2019s face in horror. \u201cA long time ago, you saved my life. In return, I\u2019ll give you a choice. Will you kill yourself with honor, or will you live sucking my d*ck?\u201dAran, afraid to die, chose the latter without a second thought. Wearing her blood-stained wedding dress, she clumsily bit Enoch\u2019s manhood in her mouth. As a reward, Enoch appointed her not as empress, but emperor, an evident proof that she was the only surviving royal family.***By the time Aran opened her eyes, the sun had risen, filling the skies with orange and red before the blue skies overtook them. When she saw the warmest hues of rainbows, she jumped up in amazement. Well, she was going to\u2026 but a little bit of movement caused her body to flutter and she fell down back to her bed again. Her body was as heavy as wet cotton.There were no maids nearby.\u2018Today\u2019s schedule is\u2026\u2019Yesterday\u2019s important events she needed to go through had been completed. She had a small window left to attend the banquet, but she missed all of them. Aran curled up in shame. She worked her muscles, her lower muscles in particular, deep and hard last night. Literally. The thought of it sent a shiver down her back.Aran bit her lips. Even though she requested, pleaded even, Enoch did not let her go. She knows he did it on purpose. That rough little play they did would quickly raise her fever and keep her immobile for the time being. She fell asleep right after their deed was finished.The embarrassment\u2026Aran turned her head a little and looked at the table. Her face lying down on the table and the papers sprawled every seemed like a dream, an illusion.She carefully touched her nether regions. There were no signs of bodily fluids. Someone must have wiped her sweaty and sticky body clean.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dBut her coochie was swollen enough to the point of Aran groaning at the slightest touch. It would be uncomfortable to sit down for a few days.As Aran pulled her hand out from her nether regions, the door opened and someone came in. For a moment, she crouched and lowered her head at the thought that it would be Enoch, but fortunately, it was one of her maids.\u201cYour Majesty, are you awake?\u201d the maid asked, putting down the tray next to the bed. The tray had cool honey water and watery soup. \u201cYou didn\u2019t wake up yet and here I was wondering whether to wake you up, but it\u2019s good that you\u2019re up. Would you like to eat?\u201dShe was polite but indifferent. Aran did not bother her attitude. She knew her position as emperorwas merely a false title with no power. It was Grand Duke Roark who wielded the true power.All those loyal to the imperial family since the rebellion was removed from power or beheaded. Enoch filled the empty position with his loyal men thereafter. Aran was simply a nominal emperor who the Grand Duke sponsored. Without his support, she would be brought down from her position immediately. Aran knew that Enoch Roark was the true emperor of the empire.\u201cI have no appetite.\u201d\u201cBut the Grand Duke told me to make sure you eat well. He was worried because of what happened last night.\u201dAt her comment, Aran\u2019s face turned red.Aran\u2019s personal maids were no stranger to their nightly throes of passion. Aran was weak, as of recent. Maybe it had to do with her schedule or the deeds with Enoch, so it was natural that her maid worried for her. Of course, Aran knew that but the thought of them hearing her groans all night long caused her cheeks to turn a rosy red.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 8": "Chapter 8 - Aran And Enoch (2)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 8: Aran and Enoch (2)Aran begrudgingly listened to Enoch\u2019s command. If she refuses to eat, she and the maid would meet trouble. This was certain.Outwardly, the Grand Duke was a calm and cool-headed man, but the truth of the matter was that Aran saw him as a volatile and crazy man. She never knew what to expect from him.Like yesterday night\u2019s deed\u2026Aran forced herself up and roughly pushed the soul into her mouth.\u201cWho cleaned the documents?\u201d Aran asked.\u201cThe Grand Duke took it with him,\u201d the maid said.That was fortunate. If confirmed by Enoch, the trade case could be approved in time. After all, they did not need to ask Aran of her opinion or consent. It was Enoch, not her, who dictated the matters of the kingdom.Though strangely enough, she had no anger at her loss of power. Aran knew best that she was no emperor material long before the rebellion. Nevertheless, she would cling to political and state affairs until she could no longer do so. It helped her to forget her situation when she drowned herself at work.After a spoon or two, Aran finished and the maid removed the dish away from her. It was time to take her medicine.After swallowing the bitter medicine, her tongue was numb, but at least she had the slight energy to stand up.The maid changed her clothes. She had wanted to wash up because she sticky and full cold sweat, but she could not. She was wrought with fever.Aran sat in a chair and opened a book. Since her schedule was messed up, it was best that she study. She knew next to nothing about being an emperor due to her reluctance and disinterest in politics at a young age.Sitting on the chair, pain ran through her n*ther regions. She turned the page over, concealing her discomfort.The maid wrapped a thick blanket over her shoulder upon noticing her body tremble and said, \u201cJust relax today, Your Majesty.\u201dAran nodded but stubbornly refused to take her eyes off the book. \u201cIt\u2019s alright. You should go take a rest.\u201d\u201cHow can I rest at ease knowing Her Majesty is ill?\u201d the maid said awkwardly.,Aran was grateful for her kindness but slightly agitated. She could not switch to a comfortable position in the maid\u2019s presence. What\u2019s more, the maid\u2019s words reminded her of what Enoch said yesterday, causing Aran to feel frustrated.In the end, Aran was forced to evict the maid out.Soon as she went out, Aran sat on the chair with her feet up and knees bent. She sighed comfortably. The pain had gone away. Then she leaned over and looked at the book.\u2018What a helpless emperor\u2026\u2019There had never been an emperor more pathetic than her\u2026 a helpless emperor who knows nothing and could do nothing. Sometimes she thought it better to fall in the abyss that is death.Aran looked at the book blankly and sighed. She could not give up easily. Her reason for living was not a matter of pride or face but something\u2026 that aside, while she sits on the throne, she hoped to do good to the people and the common folks.Aran picked up the book again and forced herself to read but with the pain tingling from her lower region, it became a difficult feat.\u201cYou haven\u2019t done anything all day, so why are you having trouble reading?\u201d Aran rubbed her temples. \u201cI can\u2019t spend the rest of my life like this in vain.\u201dMeanwhile, footsteps from afar could be heard.The heavy, wide-footed echoing sound was not that of a woman\u2019s step. There was only one man who\u2019d come to the emperor\u2019s bedroom at this time of the hour.Aran was frigid.\u201cIt\u2019s me. May I come in?\u201d a low, resonant voice said, betraying Aran\u2019s hopes.Aran looked around, as if looking for a place to hide. She hurriedly closed her book and laid back down on the bed. She thought it better if she pretended to sleep.\u201cYour Majesty,\u201d Enoch called Aran\u2019s name again, this time more rushed.Aran closed her eyes tightly and pulled the blanket over her head. She did not expect to see him again, not today, not when she was in no condition to plunge herself in pleasure. It was obvious that his lower weapon would only cause her pain.Aran bit her lips. What if he grows angry? The thought scared her. Enoch had never threatened to beat her or throw her away, but she\u2019s not sure it will remain the same in the future. He could kill her, take the throne if he so wished. Aran could never forget her brother\u2019s blood scattered on the floor.Enoch lost his patience. He opened the door and approached the bed where Aran laid with a steady gait.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Enoch looked at her amusingly and smiled, staring at her with glittering eyes. He picked up his feet and flopped down on the edge of the bed next to her.Aran quivered.\u201cI see,\u201d Enoch nodded. \u201cI\u2019m here to make sure you\u2019re feeling well, Your Majesty.\u201dHe said that yesterday and looked at what occurred thereafter\u2026 Aran was in disbelief. His words were a lie. Enoch shrugged and turned his head, eyes landing at the book resting on the table.\u201cWere you reading a book?\u201dAran gave up and nodded. Lying would only anger him.\u201cHmm\u2026 don\u2019t do that, Your Majesty. You\u2019re sick. Just relax and rest.\u201dHe was the cat chasing her, the mouse.\u201cIf I knew this would happen, we should\u2019ve played more last night. Now you\u2019re stuck in bed all day.\u201d Enoch grinned softly, finding her current predicament enjoyable.He leaned forward, reaching out and touching Aran\u2019s forehead. His large hands, which was once hot yesterday, was now cold as ice. Aran flinched and suddenly the blanket covering her came off.\u201cWha\u2026!\u201d A startled Aran pulled on the covers.\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t wrap your body with this thick blanket when you have a fever,\u201d Enoch said calmly.Aran let go of the cover. \u201c\u2026Okay\u2026\u201dShe did not have the strength to argue with him, so she did as he instructed. Though her nerves were walking on thin ice for fear that at any moment he would ask her of the thing she could not do at this very moment. Aran could not relax nor could she let her guard down.Being in the same room with him at her current state was uncomfortable. What more when he was at her bed\u2026 their distance only a few short inches away.\u201cWhy do you act like this? You look like you want to run away. It\u2019s like I\u2019m the bad guy,\u201d Enoch frowned.\u201cI\u2019m not running away\u2026\u201d Aran managed to speak her thoughts out loud, but her voice wavered that Enoch might\u2019ve noticed that she was lying through her teeth. Cold sweat suddenly broke out not from fever but the fear instilled from the man before her.\u201cYou\u2019re sweating. Didn\u2019t the maid bring you the medicine?\u201cYes\u2026 earlier.\u201d\u201cYou should drink up another one.\u201dEnoch called for the maid and ordered her to bring a tray of simple dishes and medicine. Not long after, the maid walked in carrying a tray of soup mixed with medicine. Aran stared blankly at the bowl and looked at Enoch.\u201cEat it,\u201d Enoch said.But she hesitated.\u201cDo you want me to feed you, Your Majesty?\u201dStartled, Aran shook her head and hurriedly picked up the spoon and ate as much as she could.\u201cHave some more.\u201dBut she did not want more. Fortunately, she managed to finish the soup and looked at the cleaned medicine bowl proudly.\u2018Is he really not going to do anything today?\u2019Normally, he would seek her body, but today, he seemed controlled. Maybe things would turn out well today.Aran was relieved. Meanwhile, Enoch pulled the strings on the back of her dress. The strings unraveled and her dress rolled down. A startled Aran struggled and covered her chest as her naked form suddenly came to view.Enoch ignored her fidgeting as he unrolled the rest of the strings one by one with finesse.\u201cD-don\u2019t\u2026! I can\u2019t do anything today\u2026!\u201dAs she struggled, Enoch grabbed her two wrists and pressed down on her body. She could not budge even if she wished to.How pathetic it was to think that he would not do something.\u201cYou\u2019ll get a fever,\u201d Enoch said, stripping her bare in the process.Aran looked at him with a puzzled look.\u201cWe\u2019re not doing that. Don\u2019t worry.\u201dBut his fastened breathing said otherwise.Aran nodded and covered herself with her arms. She found it shamefully embarrassing that she was n*ked \u2013 the only one n*ked, but it was better than having their bodies entertained. But\u2026 however, Enoch\u2019s gaze was extremely uncomfortable. In particular, his red eyes looked at her erect mounds rising from the chilly cold.Aran shuddered and covered herself, subconsciously pulling on the covers but Enoch would not let her.\u201cYou must be cold,\u201d Enoch said.After a moment of thought, he suddenly lifted her up and placed her on his lap. His warm heat passed through her over his thin shirt. It was still cold, but much better than before.She leaned her back on his ch*st. She wanted warmth and she sought that warmth, but she dared not move any closer for fear of touching that thing of his. Aran moved her hips to avoid his cr*tch.\u201cIf you move like that, it\u2019ll be hard on me. Or are you thinking of something er*tic, Your Majesty?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Ignoring Enoch\u2019s hardening from below, she remained still with great effort. Should he change his mind, the deed from last night would replay again.But\u2026 his manhood seemed ready to break through his pants, and slowly, his hands began touching her naked body.Aran turned around briskly and avoided his touch, her hips touching his manhood in the process.Enoch grunted lowly and he whispered in her ear and bit it lightly. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to do anything, but my will is shaking.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t do this\u2026\u201d Aran pleaded.\u201cWhat am I to do, Your Majesty?\u201dHe clasped her ch*st; his other hand penetrated the inside of her th*ghs and caressed her smooth crack.Aran stiffened.\u201cIs this too much?\u201dAran could not reply so she nodded, fearing that she\u2019d cry out when she parted her lips open. She could feel his thick fingers.\u201cI won\u2019t ask you to do that. But asking to do it with your mouth is okay, right?\u201d Enoch kissed her ear.Aran closed her eyes tight and endured his touch.\u201cJust listen to me, alright?\u201d\u201cOkay\u2026\u201dAran thought this was better than last night.\u201cLoosen my belt, Your Majesty.\u201dAran went down between his legs, knelt down, and loosened his belt. She was at a standstill after doing as Enoch instructed.Enoch laughed softly and patted her head. \u201cStop pretending to be naive, unless you intend to give me something else.\u201dAran unbuttoned his pants with trembling hands desperately wondering what to do. His vicious m*nhood popped out and patted her head and cheek laudably.\u201cThis reminds me of our first time,\u201d Enoch smiled.He had a fishy smell and Aran unconsciously quickened her breath, not because she could not stand the smell but because her mind wandered back to that day where she saw blood \u2013 blood in the floor, blood in her dress, in her hands while she caressed Enoch\u2019s manhood to survive.She remembered Enoch pushing his manhood deep in her throat. He smiled merrily at her, at Aran whose body was tainted with blood, tears, and white fluid. It was at that moment that Aran grew afraid of blood and its mere sight alone.\u201cIt was a pleasant experience, Your Majesty.\u201dAran could not answer. Enoch\u2019s m*nhood crushed her lips.Enoch picked up a small bottle next to the bed. Liquid poured out and he spread it on her ch*st and stomach. Her body glistened with oil.\u201cStand a little bit higher and get on your knees.\u201dShe did as she was told, her mounds now touching his manhood instead. Enoch sighed pleasurably.\u201cWrap it in between.\u201dAran tried to place his manhood in between her ch*st, but due to the oil, her hands kept slipping. Embarrassed, she looked up at Enoch who remained silent all throughout.Enoch thought her behavior clumsy but it was not so bad to see his towering manhood being crushed between her ch*st. In particular, he thought it interesting that Aran was trying her clumsiest best to meet his demands. He saw her long, voluminous eyelashes quivering with humiliation.\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 not\u2026 working\u2026\u201d Aran opened her luscious lips as if asking for help.Enoch clicked his tongue exaggeratedly. \u201cIf you can\u2019t, then stop.\u201dSoon as he said those words, Aran knew how this would play out thereafter. She quickly moved her body and rubbed her ch*st against his m*nhood by diligently moving her upper body.They had done many salacious acts, but this was their first. She knew this act was embarrassing despite her being ignorant of carnal pleasure. If she had the choice, she\u2019d rather be doing other things, but she had to follow his orders.Her soft ch*st and erect n*pple grazed his manhood. Enoch managed to resist the urge to grab her hair and plunge his shaft deep in her mouth. If he had done as his instinct told him to, Aran would be stuck in bed for days.He needed her. Her presence as Emperor was needed. Aran may not believe it, but Enoch treated her with great care like a glass doll that could break at any moment\u2019s notice.Aran, who had no clue what Enoch was thinking, sought to satisfy him and get out of the uncomfortable situation as soon as possible.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 11": "Chapter 11 - Her Dignity (1)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 11: Her Dignity (1)Aran placed her hand on Enoch\u2019s thigh and continued to rub his manhood with her ch*st. Disgrace and shame sprung across her face, but she ignored it. At this moment, she was no emperor, nor a fianc\u00e9, but a toy that needed to prove her usefulness.When his hot pillar touched her n*pple which had become sensitive due to her rising fever, Aran trembled. She did not know why she felt breathless, why her body had reacted in such manner.Had she truly become a lewd woman as Enoch said? The thought of it frightened her so.Aran shut her eyes tightly. If Enoch learned of this, he\u2019ll surely laugh at her.\u201cHa\u2026\u201dBut eventually, a quiet groan unwittingly came out and Enoch snickered. Arans\u2019 face turned red.\u201cSo, you\u2019re feeling it too.\u201d Enoch patted her head gently while smiling. \u201cYou\u2019re beautiful, Your Majesty.\u201dAran ignored Enoch\u2019s shameful remarks and continued the disgraceful act.Enoch grunted, and soon, white fluid splashed all over Aran\u2019s face and ch*st.It was over.Aran sat still on the floor panting heavily. The hot fluid dripping down her face and ch*st was unpleasant, but even so, she could not wipe it off in his presence.She could feel his intense gaze despite her lowered gaze. That piercing red eyes made her feel miserable. Even a thousand words couldn\u2019t describe this feeling. But, regardless, she could not rebel. She had chosen shame instead of honor.As if appreciating her deeds, Enoch brought a wet cloth and wiped her face and body.\u201cI\u2026 I\u2019ll do it.\u201dBut her words were ignored.And then, Enoch was finished.\u201cWait\u2026 I\u2026 I want to take a shower.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t. Rest first. You have a fever.\u201dEnoch shook his head and placed the palm of his hand on her forehead, his touch friendly and loving. He pulled back her sweaty hair and brushed it aside. And then, he pulled her up and pulled her close to his embrace and onto the bed.Aran had no power to answer and stretched out her limbs as if she had given up. Even after wiping off all traces of the white fluid, her body smelled fishy. Perhaps he intentionally buried his fluid in her body as if to insult her more.Aran bit her lip.The medicine soon kicked in and she\u2019d soon sleep. She tried to open her eyes forcibly to keep awake, but Enoch covered her eyes with his large hand, his other hand rubbing her head back and forth.Before falling asleep, Aran asked him, \u201cYou know, today\u2019s schedule is\u2026\u201d\u201cRest.\u201dHis soft lips fell on her forehead and Aran suddenly remembered Enoch\u2019s old self which caused her heart to ache. But her thoughts did not last long and she fell asleep.***Despite the maids\u2019 failed dissuasion that the empress regnant rest a few more days due to her accumulated fatigue, Aran stubbornly refused.The lady-in-waiting who saw her body trembling, asked anxiously, \u201cYour Majesty, why don\u2019t you rest?\u201dAran shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019ve had too much rest.\u201dThe lady-in-waiting did not ask again.Aran, who changed in a new set of clothes, requested that she wear thick makeup. She usually did not enjoy wearing makeup. It made her feel stuffy, but she was not confident at this very moment. It was a matter of self-esteem. She did not want to show weakness, even if it was a trivial matter, to the aristocrats bent on biting her neck at any moment\u2019s opening.\u201cWhat do you think, Your Majesty?\u201dThe maid brought her a mirror after finishing her makeup. Reflected in the mirror was a face that looked tired veiled with dark makeup.\u201cI like it. Thank you.\u201d Aran nodded.She did not look weak.The maid smiled proudly.Before leaving her bedroom quarter, Aran took a deep breath. Her trembling body was hidden under her dress. She straightened her back and looked up squarely. Like her thickly painted makeup, her false dignity and bravado were the only means she could protect herself with.Note: Because I have trouble labeling Aran as the Emperor\u2026 since she technically is in KR raws\u2026 though it doesn\u2019t exactly translate well in English. With that said, Aran\u2019s position as Emperor will be localized as Empress Regnant or Empress for short from this point forward. An Empress Regnant is a female monarch who reigns in her own right over an empire. She possesses and exercises sovereign powers in the absence of an Emperor.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Her unusually thick makeup made her look more like a doll.She was beautiful, powerful, a face rarely found. Though not many remembered her as the girl who once smiled as bright as a spring flower.\u201cWhy are you all deathly silent?\u201d Her voice was cold.A while ago, an uncomfortable air hung in the conference room when she proposed a lowered taxation amongst their citizens.The oldest participants, Marquis Kelon, opened his mouth. \u201cYour Majesty, taxes have not risen significantly compared to previous years past. And with all the budget put in place the following year, a sudden tax cut would erroneously hurt our budget.\u201d\u201cIndeed. But I can\u2019t allow my subjects to suffer in poverty for three consecutive years. Don\u2019t you think so, marquis?\u201d the empress replied coolly.Marquis Kelon clenched his fist. \u201cYour Majesty, while I find it mirthfully pleasant that you care formypeople, you do not need to worry too much. Each territory has its own remedy.\u201dThe latter spoke exaggeratedly, voice tinged with soft sharpness. He hinted that the empress not meddle euphemistically at his affair in a roundabout, childish manner.A sneer slipped out from the mouth of some aristocrats.The empress did not budge.\u201cRelief to the subjects is what we need to think about after the precedents of tax breaks.\u201dHaving spent her entire life enjoying the pleasant privilege of wealth within the corridors of the palace, she did not know the experiences of the common people, but, still, a small analytical calculation could show that their lives, at this moment, was in dire need of help.The three-year crop failure and famine had brought the households of the common people to impoverishment and some extreme poverty. Many would die before the winter season ends should the discussion lead to failure. Puppet or not, she\u2019ll use her power as empress regent to make sure her subjects are fed.\u201cYour Majesty, the reduction of taxes will only reduce the tax revenues flowing into the royal family. How do you intend to fill the national treasury? Do you have a plan?\u201d asked Duke Silas, an official prominent figure despite his young age.The empress confronted him without avoiding his keen gaze. \u201cI will send an audit to each estate to collect illegal taxation. As you may already know, there are aristocrats who enjoy excessive luxury and pleasure, yet never care to pay a penny in taxes for their expediency. They\u2019ll be fined for illegal use of taxes. It\u2019s more than enough to fill our national coffers. I should note that luxury items will end up taxed. It is not a necessity but awant. We cannot afford luxury in times when our subjects need our help.\u201d\u201cYour Majesty,\u201d Duke Silas did not care to hide his ired countenance and continued, \u201cdo you think there exists a nobleman who would accept such proposal?Think carefully.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no reason not to accept the proposal. Is it not our duty as nobility and of the ruling class to give when the country is in times of trouble, our duty to serve the people?\u201dHeavy silence fell.The empress\u2019 recalcitrant words were like cold water poured down onto them. A tense tension of energy poured between the empress and the aristocrats.Aranrhod Linister was a usually calm empress regent, but at times, she was stubborn and often stuck to her views. She was unaware of it.Duke Silas kicked his tongue inwardly and looked at the empress with a determined faceHe himself was too weak to sit on the throne. Duke Silas always made enemies playing devil\u2019s advocate though he could hardly protect himself. He was fond of the empress, fond of her kindred spirit, something he found the other aristocrats lacking. But, he, too, did not want to involve cutting his flesh to give to the masses.The duke glanced back and looked at the Grand Duke. He was the empress\u2019 loyal supporter and wielded more power than anyone in the room combined. Because of him, the empress was able to speak her thoughts out freely without obstruction. Duke Silas wondered how the proceedings of the meeting would turn out.Everything was in the Grand Duke\u2019s hands.All the great events that occurred as of late came from his very own hands. He would be hit the hardest should the audit take place. Duke Silas turned to the empress again. Her face hidden under heavy makeup was bound to turn pale.A few other aristocrats who noticed the Grand Duke had yet to side with the empress began to protest their thoughts loudly. The empress remained silent all throughout as the atmosphere of the conference room grew more and more heated.The less-than-expected Duke Silas came up with a compromise. \u201cYour Majesty, realistically speaking, it is difficult to lower taxes, but as your will is stubborn, we can consider freezing it to last year\u2019s level. Your Majesty, please make concessions.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026.\u201d The empress hesitated, not readily able to give a proper answer.As her silence grew longer, the aristocrats\u2019 sneering eyes grew harsher.The Grand Duke had yet to give his opinion, so until then, they grew bolder.The empress clasped the hem of her clothing. She predicted vehement reactions from them. Never did she naively believe that all her intentions would be carried out. But she thought she could persevere\u2026 she did not realize that both her mind and body were too tired. She was tired. She wanted to get away, to escape.\u2018\u2026Do we have to compromise when our people are suffering?\u2019She should not have expected much from them. It might be better to make a compromise as the duke said than nothing at all.The empress straightened her back and looked squarely at the aristocrats. Dozens of pairs of eyes looked at her wolfishly as if ready to pounce on her at any moment.She clenched on her clothing tighter.She knew she had been defeated. Their eyes spoke of victory. A deep sense of helplessness struck her in the chest.\u2018\u2026Do I have to sit on the high throne as I watch my subjects suffer helplessly?It was when the empress was about to hopelessly accept the duke\u2019s proposal that the Grand Duke, who watched the proceedings from the sidelines, opened his mouth. \u201cYour Majesty, I, Grand Duke Roark accept the audits and reduction of taxes.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

When their eyes met, Enoch\u2019s lips drew a gentle smile. He remained loyal to the emperor since her ascension, always deferring to her decree and recognize it to existence.\u201cI will always follow your will, Your Majesty.\u201dIn a flash, the tables had been overturned. The aristocrats flocking and vying to bite the emperor\u2019s neck at a moment\u2019s notice drooped their head and wagging tails at Enoch\u2019s edict.Duke Silas, watching the scene from the sidelines, hid his innermost thoughts.\u2018Are you still that friendly fianc\u00e9, Grand Duke?\u2019Duke Silas thought it amusing. He looked at the Empress\u2019 expression. Towards the Grand Duke who saved her, she said no word of thanks, only a reluctant nod.Such demeanor played an integral part in the Empress\u2019 reputation among the aristocrats that she treats the Grand Duke, the head of nobility, with begrudging inclination.The Grand Duke placed her at the seat of power, on the throne as sovereign of the nation prior to being sold off to a marquis fifty years older than her. In the eyes of the wolffish aristocrats, the Empress brushes off the Grand Duke\u2019s kindness without grace. Some diehard loyalists of the Grand Duke once openly spoke that it would be for the best that he hangs the emperor\u2019s head and take the throne. The Grand Duke did not take to their words kindly, thus resulting in heavy punishment.But Duke Silas understood the Empress\u2019 train of thoughts to an extent. He recalled the event known as theBloody Wedding.Duke Silas remembered that chaotic day when he attended Aranrhod Linister and Marquis Maxwell\u2019s wedding. He saw the deathly still bodies of the royal family scattered over the marble floor, their pools of blood fusing together.It chilled his core.He did not know the details occurring between Her Majesty and the Grand Duke that very day nor could he understand why the Empress flinched faintly at the Grand Duke\u2019s sight each time.Though whatever the circumstances, she was able to achieve her goals at the Grand Duke\u2019s support despite the aristocrats detesting her view that undermined their territorial rule.\u201cThis concludes today\u2019s meeting. Until then.\u201d Aran declared the end of the meeting and hurried out of the conference room.She was no longer present, but none mouthed a word of complaint. Enoch Roark remained in the conference room.\u201cHer Majesty is truly blessed. It is rare for an emperor to have a loyal subject as great as the Grand Duke himself,\u201d Duke Silas said to Grand Duke Roark, his voice tinged with subtle sarcasm.The Grand Duke\u2019s expression did not change. Duke Silas was disappointed.\u201cIs that so? I don\u2019t think so,\u201d the Grand Duke answered bluntly.\u201cYou are cold, Grand Duke, but you remain ever so loyal to Her Majesty.\u201dEnoch laughed at the duke\u2019s remark. To witness his laugh outside the emperor\u2019s presence was rare and Duke Silas was floored.\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m a loyalist,\u201d he answered lowly and followed after the emperor.Regardless, Grand Duke Roark was a military god and Duke Silas shrugged, pondering over something.***Aran was in misery. She was to meet the foreign envoys in an hour, but her sour mood had not gone away.She comforted herself, said to herself that it was fortunate the taxes were lowered, but the sense of helplessness washing over her grew bigger. She was perplexed. Her decree did not garner the support of the aristocrats and instead relied on the support of the Grand Duke.She sat on the bench, the sunshine bough drifting through as the gentle wind soothed her melancholic heart. She felt the presence of her servant and said without turning her head, \u201cDid I not say that I wish for time alone?\u201d\u201cI came to check up on you, Your Majesty.\u201dThat familiar voice\u2026 Aran hurriedly raised her head.\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d he asked.\u201c\u2026To rest.\u201dEnoch sat next to her, his large hand cupping her cheek.Aran pushed his hand away and whispered weakly, \u201cPlease, Grand Duke, when others see\u2026\u201d\u201cI wish you\u2019d value me more in the eyes of others.\u201d\u201c\u2026..\u201dEnoch held Aran\u2019s chin and turned it towards him, their eyes meeting. Aran gazed into his blood-red eyes. His lips were slightly open.\u201cYou don\u2019t look good in dark makeup.\u201dHe rubbed his thumb over her lips. Aran shut her eyes. She did not notice the sad look on his face.\u201cI put you on the throne to close your eyes and cover your ears and merely enjoy the luxury provided to you. Why do you act a saint?\u201d\u201c\u2026But taxes needed to be lowered. The harsh winter last season was\u2026\u201d Aran said carefully but shut her mouth seeing his cold gaze.\u201cAnd do you think they\u2019ll be grateful to you? They do not know that the seat of power has changed. They know not your name, Your Majesty.\u201d\u201c\u2026..\u201dEnoch Roark brutally penetrated Aranrhod Linister\u2019s mind.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Her hair ran freely down her shoulder, revealing her slender neckline. Nervous, she swallowed her throat dryly.He gently caressed her legs, his long fingers grazing against her skin.She looked at him with frightened eyes. Those eyes she once thought beautiful was now a nightmare. His eyes indicated sadism.He did not wait long.To him, spreading her legs in a secluded area where no one came was easy like a child rubbing their wrist. His fingers on her legs slowly climbed the inside of her th*ghs.Aran read his bestial intentions and swallowed her breath roughly and before she knew it, she laid on the bench with her legs open and the hem of her clothes pulled upwards.\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s still daytime\u2026!\u201dShe made futile attempts to close her legs but Enoch skillfully blocked it without much trouble. Aran desperately grabbed hold of Enoch\u2019s wrist. Their eyes intertwined and Aran shook her head with eager eyes.\u201cAt night, I\u2019ll do anything, but\u2026 not now\u2026\u201dShe held back the tears forming from the corner of her eyes and begged.\u201cI\u2019ll finish up quickly,\u201d he said.The hem of her garment rolled up to her waist. Aran resisted his advancements desperately, but no matter how difficult she pushed, Enoch would not budge. He was a stiff rock.She exhausted herself after several rebellions and gave up thereafter. She could feel the warm air looming over her n*ked body in full view under the blue sky. She closed her eyes tightly and turned her head away.Hot hands swept through her thighs\u2026 her p*lvis\u2026 her lower abdomen\u2026 each time Enoch\u2019s hand touched her all over, her ch*st swelled.Since it was like this, Aran was eager to finish their deed quickly, however, Enoch had yet to move on to the next stage, only looking at her body quietly.He\u2019d never seen her beauty clearly at night, but when daylight was in full view, he saw traces of theirlovemaking. Her thighs, in particular, were full of bite marks and discoloration, the original color of her skin unable to be seen. He\u2019s sure that it\u2019d be the same as well on her ch*st.\u201cI\u2019m an animal.\u201dHis desires subsided. He desired Aran, but not like this.Sighing, he pulled down her clothes.Aran, nervous and waiting for the action to begin, opened her eyes carefully.\u201c\u2026What\u2026\u201dEnoch raised her up and pulled her closer to his ch*st.The bench in the palace garden was wide but too small and cramped for two people to lie down. And Enoch himself was much larger than the average man.Aran flinched unconsciously at his touch.Pulling Aran closer to him, her face ended up being buried in his arms. She could feel his pulse beating vigorously.Enoch cupped her cheek and whispered in her ear, \u201cYou\u2019ll be having lunch with Henen\u2019s envoys.\u201dShe nodded. \u201cYes.\u201dShe did not know what went through his head, but this was fine, no, great.Though his touch brought her a sense of shameful excitement\u2026\u201cI\u2019ll have food prepared for your liking. Though I\u2019ve told you before, don\u2019t leave anything behind. Eat all your food.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201dAran carefully raised her head and looked at Enoch\u2019s face. His eyes were closed and he looked asleep. His hand was still pressed against her.\u201cExcuse me.\u201d\u201cSpeak.\u201d\u201cThat\u2026 you\u2019re not doing it?\u201d\u201cIf you want, we can do it now.\u201d\u201cNo! It\u2019s fine!\u201d believing that he\u2019d change his mind at any second, Aran answered urgently.With his eyes still closed, Enoch smiled a little. \u201cThough I am disappointed that you\u2019d so stubbornly deny me.\u201dAran blinked. Yes. She never knew what went on his head, but this time, it did seem like he had no intention to commit the deed.She could relax.Her body, once nervous, calmed over time. The sound of Enoch\u2019s pulse beating rhythmically and the warm sunshine made her drowsy.She was in the arms of the most dangerous and capricious man she knew\u2026 the man who killed her family, the man who insulted her, that man\u2026 but\u2026 somehow\u2026 she was able to sleep comfortably in his arms.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 15": "Chapter 15 - Enoch (1)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 15: Enoch (1)Flashback\u2026Aranrhod Linister, the empire\u2019s first and last imperial daughter, slipped out of the bed and pulled out the clothes hidden under her bed. She managed to obtain loose-fitted-shirts and tight trousers by coaxing a young servant who had similar height and built like her.To the young servant, it sounded akin to a threat but to Aran, it was sincere.She changed her clothes, tied her long platinum blonde hair in front of the mirror. She looked at herself. It was a man\u2019s clothing and it looked awkward, but it was not too bad. Rather\u2026 she liked it. It was more comfortable than the everyday dress she wore.\u201cOkay.\u201dShe stirred under the bed one more time and grabbed the wooden sword and book. She carefully picked up the wooden sword and looked around, stumbling slightly due to the weight. She fell, almost\u2026 but she was not discouraged.She\u2019d come to admire the female knights of the Imperial Knights these days. She\u2019d steal a furtive glance each passing day as she watched them in their black uniform while skillfully handling the sharp sword.Forgetting her weak body, she imagined herself a knight.Once upon a time, on her thirteenth birthday, she asked her father to teach her swordplay as her birthday present. Her father doted on her and would always ascend to her request but this one\u2026 he almost fainted attempting to appease her. He tried, albeit a failure, to reject her, but the look on her face was not something he could ignore. Eventually, he was forced to accept her pleading.She would learn the way of the sword when she grew of proper age.But she had no intention of waiting till she was of age.Fine.If it was like that, then she\u2019d learn the way of the sword on her own.Aran slipped out of the bedroom through the window with the sword tied around her waist with a string. She was glad that her bedroom was not too high up, otherwise, she\u2019d have a difficult time escaping her bedroom.Hiding in shades of darkness, she trotted to the place she longed to be in during the day. When she arrived at the place, she took out the candles fastened under her arms and lit it on fire. Then, she opened the book and looked at the knight. She copied the knight\u2019s posture as written in the book, but all efforts were sloppy.But she did not give up.Each time she swung the wooden sword, her breathing grew heavier and heavier till she was out of breath.Unable to continue any further, she flung away the wooden sword to the side and laid still on the floor.It was in the midst of the night, but the moon had yet to shine. Though it looked like it looked to break free alongside the twinkling stars.The breezy night cooled her damp forehead and Aran closed her eyes pleasantly.At that moment, a sudden movement echoed.\u201cWho is it?\u201d Aran questioned as she quickly rose up. She picked up the wooden sword next to her.No matter how late it was in the night, the chances of an imperial daughter facing imminent danger was as low as that of a commoner being struck by lightning in the middle of the street, but, still, Aran wielded the wooden sword tightly.\u201c\u2026..\u201dThe only folks who\u2019d come out at this time of the year were the maidservants. Maybe they planned to scare her or snitch on her father that they saw the empire\u2019s imperial daughter sneaking late at night.At that thought, Aran\u2019s eyes flashed and she stared at the darkness intently.\u201cWho is it?\u201d she asked again.\u201cIt\u2019s Enoch\u2026 from the House of Roark,\u201d the voice said.Then a boy appeared.\u201cHouse of Roark\u2026?\u201d Aran opened her mouth blankly, immediately forgetting her determination to scare the stranger.Maybe she was not as confident as she thought, similar to the moon who had yet to make its appearance in the night sky.The boy looked at Aran\u2019s hair.Blonde hair that was pale enough to appear silver at first glance\u2026 was the imperial family\u2019s symbol.Recognizing Aran, the boy immediately knelt.\u201cYou are Princess Aranrhod. It\u2019s a pleasure meeting you, Your Highness.\u201dAran was embarrassed at the sight of the boy greeting her politely. She\u2019d never seen such a beautiful human being in all her life.Her heart began to beat.\u201cUm\u2026\u201dShe was relieved that it was late in the night. That she was veiled with darkness, the boy would not be able to see how much of a mess she looked with sweat and dirt. And her cheeks\u2026 it was red like a ripened apple.Enoch, unaware of Aran\u2019s circumstances, tilted his head and looked at the princess hesitantly.\u201cAre you unwell, Your Highness?\u201dHe did not know what she\u2019d been doing here all this time, but her posture\u2026 it looked clumsy.Was she in danger? Was he hurt?Enoch stood up at the immediate thought that something terrible occurred to the princess.\u201cNo! Stay away!\u201d Aran stepped back and shouted sharply.She was embarrassed. She smelled of sweat.Shame\u2026 it was an unfamiliar feeling. She, who was always praised, never felt this way. The thought shocked her. Was she a shy person?Her pleading cries stopped Enoch from approaching.\u201cYou\u2019re not hurt?\u201d he asked.\u201cNo. I\u2019m not hurt. So\u2026 don\u2019t come any further, okay?\u201d\u201cYes, Your Highness.\u201dWith his calm disposition, she realized the stupidity of her act. Her response was in no way or form rational, but what she was certain of was that the longer she lingered, the higher the possibility that she would do something ridiculous.She decided to leave before she made a complete fool of herself.\u201cK-keep it a secret that you saw me\u2026 otherwise\u2026\u201d Aran hesitated, unable to speak out the words lodged in her throat.How could she dare threaten this beautiful boy?She quickly turned around and left.Returning to her room, Aran threw away the wooden sword and slumped on the bed. She had trouble sleeping. Her heart kept pounding. The image of that beautiful boy pervaded her mind.\u2026Was this love?The next day, she learned the boy was her fianc\u00e9.It was the happiest day of her life.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She was entering her stage youthfulness. She had no care for the rumors as her mind was full of Enoch.Enoch, on the other hand, was somewhat bashful and shy by the princess\u2019 overly active tendencies. He, who was sixteen years of age and was almost as tall as an adult, treated Aran as his sister, the princess whose height barely reached his chest.The emperor resented the sight of his daughter being overly fond of Enoch. She began growing indifferent to him. Each time there was an argument involving Enoch, his daughter sided with him and the emperor had no choice but to swallow his bitter disapproval inwardly.Unfortunately, Aran was unable to see Enoch often. She had a weak constitution and sickness always plagued her weak body. Especially during the winter months, Aran would suffer from severe cold and thus the emperor had to limit her and Enoch\u2019s meeting to once a month.\u201cI miss Enoch,\u201d Aran mumbled.\u201cGet well soon. Isn\u2019t that the only way you\u2019ll see him more often?\u201d the Empress said.\u201cWhy was I born weak? Why can\u2019t I be strong and healthy like the others?\u201d Aran voiced her thoughts loudly.The immature and young Aran did not know that her words broke the empress\u2019 heart. Looking at her daughter with pitiful eyes, she secretly invited Enoch to the palace.Enoch, after journeying to the palace for several days, nodded upon hearing that his fiance\u00e9 was afflicted with sickness. The empress\u2019 face turned ashen cold at the sight of the boy whose face remained unchanged even when hearing that Aran, his fianc\u00e9e, was sick.\u201cEnoch.\u201d\u201cYes, Your Majesty.\u201d\u201cThis is probably troublesome for you. That the Empress called your presence in the palace probably irritated you. If that is so, how immature of you.\u201d\u201c\u2026No.\u201dThe empress did not miss a moment to voice her thoughts. Enoch was mature for his age, but he was still a boy, and a boy could not hide all his thoughts.\u201cSince she was a child, my daughter was always at death\u2019s door. The Emperor and I never scolded her despite her faults. After all, it\u2019s our fault that Aran was born like this\u2026\u201d the Empress said with bitter voice and looked at Enoch\u2019s eyes, \u201cThough I may not look like it, I see my daughter as something so dearly precious that not even all the riches of the world could be traded. Enoch, I want you to be kind to her, even if it\u2019s a little bit. I won\u2019t forgive anyone who hurts my daughter.\u201dThe Empress\u2019 voice was soft but it was tinged with warnings.Enoch nodded. \u201cI understand, Your Majesty.\u201dAt that, a kind smile appeared on the Empress\u2019 lips. She looked like a gentle and loving mother.***Enoch and the empress knocked on the imperial room before entering.\u201cAran, I have a present,\u201d the empress said gently.\u201cIf it\u2019s medicine, I don\u2019t want it,\u201d Aran buried her head in the pillow.\u201cDon\u2019t be like that. You\u2019ll change your mind once you know who your mother brought. Come on, get up.\u201dAt the empress\u2019 words, Aran looked up reluctantly. Her eyes bulged immediately at the sight of Enoch standing before her.Enoch looked at her silently.Aran screamed inwardly and immediately covered herself with a blanket.\u2018Wh-why is he\u2026\u2019It was Enoch, the boy she dreamed of. He\u2019s here. But\u2026 no\u2026 she didn\u2019t want him to see her like this. She was sick and she couldn\u2019t wash herself properly, let alone dress up. And\u2026 what\u2019s more\u2026 the clothes she wore where childishly patterned pajamas suitable only for children.Enoch, on the other hand, was dressed in perfect gentleman-like clothes from head to toe.\u201cAran.\u201dIt was the first time she heard her mother\u2019s voice sounding somewhat strict.\u201cThen\u2026 wait\u2026 could you come back in a minute? I\u2026 I need to change my clothes\u2026\u201dThe empress immediately noticed Aran\u2019s heart and thoughts. She covered her mouth with raised lips. She never thought her daughter would grow embarrassed at the sight of the opposite sex looking at her with childish clothing.It was amusing.The empress looked at Enoch. \u201cThen Enoch\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Your Majesty. Her Highness is always lovely. She should continue wearing comfortable clothes if she\u2019s not feeling well,\u201d Enoch said as he approached Aran\u2019s bed.If Aran had been a little less flushed with embarrassment, she\u2019d realize that those words held no truth, but she was unable to judge from false to truth with fever afflicting her.She poked her head out of the blanket and asked, \u201cReally?\u201dEnoch nodded. \u201cYes.\u201dThe empress noticed his white lie but said nothing. Regardless of Enoch\u2019s sincerity, it was fine as long as her daughter was happy. After all, happy times often never lasts.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Oh, the Empress asked me to deliver this to you, princess. She said you must eat it.\u201dEnoch passed her a small paper bag stuffed with powdered medicine.Aran wore a sullen look and grabbed the bag hastily. \u201cI don\u2019t want to take medicine\u2026\u201dEnoch pretended that he did not hear her grumbling.Aran looked at him for a moment and asked carefully, \u201cUm\u2026 can\u2019t you feed me?\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dEnoch\u2019s face reddened. He\u2019d grown a little embarrassed at her unexpected request. He, too, was of noble blood and the heir to the Grand Duke Roark\u2019s dukedom and the House of Roark. He\u2019d never done anything like this.\u201cYes, Your Highness.\u201dBut upon recalling the Empress\u2019 warning, he nodded vehemently.He opened the medicine bag with a slight clumsy hand and put it in Aran\u2019s mouth. Aran did not complain. It\u2019d be unfair for Enoch who made every effort to feed her the medicine. She took it all in with great strides.She expected Enoch to praise her and she to revel in it, but Enoch, unaware of her current thoughts, said nothing and stuffed more medicine into her mouth like it was candy.Aran\u2019s eyes widened and Enoch let out a sudden laugh at Aran\u2019s bulging cheek.Aran\u2019s heart warmed. She did not know why he laughed, but she liked it. She liked his smile.Enoch stroked Aran\u2019s head unconsciously.\u201cYou\u2019ll be okay,\u201d he said.Aran was pitiful. She spent most of her time in the bedroom at an early age. Enoch was aware that though she looked calm, her heart must\u2019ve longed to journey outside and leave the confines of the palace walls. The her who bravely wielded the wooden sword in the midst of the night suddenly came to mind.Enoch\u2019s hand cupped her cheek and Aran\u2019s eyes opened wide. She carefully leaned against his hand. The temperature of her body rose. Enoch could feel it.\u201cIt\u2019s strange,\u201d she muttered.\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cEnoch, you\u2019re sweet,\u201d Aran smiled weakly, \u201cIf it\u2019s like this, I hope I\u2019ll be sick every day.\u201d\u201cEveryone looks forward to your speedy recovery, Your Highness.\u201dAran looked up at him. \u201cYou too?\u201dEnoch nodded. \u201cOf course.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026 I\u2019ll get better soon.\u201dLooking at Aran\u2019s innocent face, Enoch could see why the Emperor would not allow his daughter to experience much of the terrible world. Maybe because she\u2019d grown up protected due to her weak constitution, but the princess was overly naive and frank. And she was weak. She\u2019d become the target of everyone should she hold a clumsy grip on power.The Grand Duke, Enoch\u2019s father, had always traditionally been at odds with the Imperial Family, but regardless, the Emperor pushed ahead with the engagement of his daughter to the Grand Duke\u2019s son to prevent others from using her.Enoch wondered what it felt like to be loved.Both father and mother were always mercilessly\u2026Aran twisted her body and saw Enoch\u2019s gaze.He looked down and smiled lightly.\u201cEnoch,\u201d she called his name.\u201cSpeak.\u201dShe smiled softly. \u201c\u2026I\u2019m happy you\u2019re here.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dHis answer was blunt, but Aran did not care. She laughed and enjoyed his simple presence.But in Enoch\u2019s eyes, the princess lived in a completely different world. He and his parents lived in an estranged relationship. No\u2026 he disliked them. How does it feel to like someone else the way the princess liked him? He wasn\u2019t quite sure how to. Maybe he\u2019ll figure it out one day. But for now, the thought of having to keep the Emperor\u2019s daughter happy and in a good mood for the rest of his life seemed to tire him.Flashback End\u2026***The zephyr wind from outside blew. Aran, the Empress Regnant, was in the office busying herself with work. The Grand Duke had yet to visit her. She was fortunate for that. But much to her dismay, whenever time allowed it, he\u2019d bother her at every opportunity.And she was aware of what would become of Enoch\u2019s occasional rendezvous to visit her.And right\u2026 now\u2026 she was looking at the man buried in between her legs and eating her flesh like sweet nectar. She wanted him to stop, but she did not have the power to speak. If she did, a groan would slip out of her mouth.Despite the building excitement of pleasure, Aran looked at the door uneasily. She could hear passersby busily wandering around outside the office.An hour ago, she had no idea she\u2019d be spreading her legs wide open on the desk. She never thought they\u2019d commit to passion and pleasure in broad daylight when she accepted Enoch\u2019s request for an audience.Aran bit her lips and covered her mouth with her hands to avoid making a sound.Meanwhile, Enoch flicked his tongue around and bit her tender and hard cl*toris lightly.Aran\u2019s waist twisted slightly and a nasal sound leaked out.\u201cHa\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Aran felt it and she shivered, her soaked flesh accepting his finger without qualms.Slurping wet sounds echoed in rhythmic notes.It was melody to his ear.She was nearing her peak and he knew it.\u201cYour Majesty.\u201dAran stiffened at the rough voice calling her.Enoch opened her legs wider and bent down to inhale her sweet, sweet entrance and lick the outer lips lightly.Aran quivered.Perhaps she did not hear him.He called her again.\u201cYour Majesty.\u201dHe\u2019s sure she had heard him this time. He stopped his act and looked up at her.Aran sighed in relief and said, \u201c\u2026What is it?\u201d\u201cDuke Silas requests an audience with you. What do you want me to do, Your Majesty?\u201dDuke Silas?She tried to make a reasonable judgment but her mind was hazy. She\u2019s sure the duke was not among the people she\u2019s to meet today.\u201c\u2026What do you mean? Wait\u2026 ah\u2026\u00a0haa\u2026!\u201dSuddenly, Enoch\u2019s tongue penetrated her wet insides. She had almost reached the dam of breaking. Her senses stood at its height peak. She was sensitive and she trembled with each lick Enoch\u2019s tongue tended to her flesh.\u201cYour Majesty, are you ill?\u201d When Aran said nothing and simmered down, Enoch asked lowly.\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine,\u201d she said with a muffled voice, \u201cask him what the matter is and if it is not urgent, then order him to go back.\u201d\u201cYes, Your Majesty.\u201dAran, who overcame the crisis, stared at him with a ball of bundled resentment. Unlike the nervousness corroding her, Enoch was too relaxed.\u201cPlease, not right now. We\u2019re in the office.\u201dNo one would willingly enter the empress regent\u2019s office without permission, but the mere thought of people passing by and standing at the foot of the door heightened her sense of nervousness.Aran had tried to push his head away from her, but Enoch caught her wrist and gazed into her eyes.\u201cWhy? Is that a problem?\u201d\u201cOf course\u2026!\u00a0Nnghh\u2026\u201dEnoch dived inside her garden without a moment\u2019s hesitation and licked the fleshy lips of her taco. He moved upwards and flicked his tongue on her erect cl*t.Aran bit her lips. A mildew of blood slipped out, but despite it all, she could not help but let out a low moan. Her toes curled up as she twisted in the caress of Enoch\u2019s tongue.\u201cI hope you enjoyed it, Your Majesty.\u201dAran was unable to refute. Even she could not believe the irregular gasps akin to a lustful animal belonged to her.Under Enoch\u2019s lead, he grabbed onto her leg with one hand while the other moved its way onward to her wholesome flesh.\u201cStop\u2026\u201dBut stop he did not.His finger touched her s*xual\u00a0zone and he moved his finger up and down voraciously. Aran could not withstand the waves of pleasure that she let out that she came lightly. She was drenched with wetness and her moist green eyes the color of evergreen had been thrown in a whirlpool of pleasure.Enoch kissed and sucked on her cl*t while inserting a finger inside her. Aran\u2019s hot inner walls quickly accepted him while contracting vigorously as his thumb pressed down on her swollen cl*t.\u201cAh!\u201dAran shrieked in astonishment.\u201cYour Majesty? Is something wrong?\u201dOne voice called for Aran when he heard her voice piercing through the door.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d the voice asked.Enoch did not stop moving his hand and pleasured Aran as freely as he could.Arian\u2019s waist arched up. Coincidentally, Enoch\u2019s tongue slipped inside her inner flesh, causing Aran to let out a muffled sound.The voice noticed something was strange when there was no answer from the other side.\u201cYour Majesty, may I come in?\u201dAran tried to resist desperately from Enoch\u2019s touch without making a sound, but the body that was immersed in pleasure was not strong enough.She looked at Enoch with a pleading look but he wore a mere look of amusement.\u201cExcuse me, Your Majesty. I\u2019ll be opening the door.\u201dAt the voice\u2019s words, Aran stiffened and she could hear the doorknob spin.\u201cYou don\u2019t need to come in. The cups spilled,\u201d Enoch said before the door opened fully. His voice was incredibly dry. \u201cI\u2019ll have the maids clean it up.\u201dThe voice heard Enoch\u2019s rough voice and he immediately stopped.Meanwhile, Enoch\u2019s hands did not stop his playful banter. Aran\u2019s lips were wide open. She moaned silently.On the other side, the voice still held onto the door.Aran closed her eyes hopelessly. She\u2019d no longer be able to endure the moan this time. As she felt the burst of groan leaking from her small voice, a large hand covered her mouth.\u201cYou can leave now,\u201d Enoch said.\u201cYes, Grand Duke,\u201d the voice said meekly.Enoch watched the doorknob twist. He could hear the footsteps moving further away. He turned his head back to Aran.\u201cHaaaah!!\u201dAt the same time, the struggling Aran let out a pent out groan while a terrible climax that she had long endured followed. Even after experiencing her nigh peak, Aran was unable to recompose herself properly and she trembled intermittently.\u201cIf I knew you\u2019d like it this much, we\u2019d have done this more often,\u201d Enoch whispered as he left a kiss mark inside her trembling thighs.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

His sleeves grew damp from her wetness. He could feel an air of sorrow scattered all over the room. He thought of poking her a bit more, but he noticed her shoulders fluttering. A small, quiet sob followed.Was she happy? Was this the reason for her tears? Enoch wondered, finding her figure cute and endearing.Aran stood up, but she had trouble doing so. Regardless, she shook it off fiercely. She stumbled and came down from the desk. As her feet touched the ground, she staggered. Had Enoch not quickly help her, she\u2019d have injured herself.\u201cLet me go\u2026\u201dAran twisted herself out of his embrace. Enoch let her go without a hitch. Aran stood upright and looked at him. Her strained body trembled visibly. A mixture of sorrow and anger rolled over her cheeks.\u201cYou\u2019re\u2026\u201d Her voice was coarse and broken. Aran let out a deep breath. \u201c\u2026 Do you find this amusing?\u201dAran drew out her courage and spit out the words she longed to say. The man\u2019s presence choked her like a mountain weighing her back.The act they had done early was nothing as their rendezvous had all been done in secret, but today, Enoch brutally trampled down the smallest bit of pride she had left.\u201cTell me, do you find seeing me in misery amusing?\u201d Aran let out an angered and seething voice.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing more important to me than you,\u201d Enoch\u2019s calm voice further fueled Aran\u2019s anger.\u201cWhy not put me in the dungeon for the rest of my life? Why do you continue to trample me down like this? Why not mock me more\u2026?!\u201d\u201cYour Majesty?\u201d Enoch asked. It seemed he did not understand. \u201cYour Majesty, I am a servant ready at your command. You need not feel shame or pride. What you need and what, ask away.\u201d\u201cLies\u2026 even at this moment, you\u2019re deceiving me\u2026 you\u2019ve never once followed my will!\u201dHis arrogant lips drew to a haughty smile. \u201cWhat I gave you, that\u2019s what you truly wanted.\u201dAran felt her eyes turn white.The next moment, a sharp frictional sound cut the air.Aran surprised herself. She swallowed a breath and stepped back. There were clear handprints belonging to her printed on his beautiful face.Enoch reached out his hand towards her, his countenance expressionless.The fearful Aran tried to escape in a hurry, but he was faster. She stiffened reflexively and curled her shoulders as tears welled up in her eyes.Contrary to her expectations, Enoch swept over her disheveled hair. Enoch laughed as their eyes met.Aran came to the sudden realization that her defiance further egged him on and further amused him. Her defiance was but a mere cat scratching its owner.\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid of me, Your Majesty. I won\u2019t do anything to harm you.\u201dAran looked at her handprint on his cheek.\u201cThis isn\u2019t what you do to the empress you serve\u2026\u201d Aran answered powerlessly. Her anger did not subside, she had lost all her fighting spirit in a moment of fear.Enoch pressed his luscious lips on her cheek.\u201cBut you chose to be my pawn in the first place, Your Majesty.\u201dAran shook her head at his whispers.He was right.It was she who chose a miserable life at his shallow mercy. If she was unable to withstand this life any further, she could merely run away and meet the hands of death. Countless of her forefathers were willing to die in the name of fame and pride.Unfortunately, she did not inherit those traits from them.\u201cI\u2019ll always be here for you, Your Majesty.\u201dThe palm of Enoch\u2019s neck slowly stroked Aran\u2019s neck.Aran realized that he was warning her.His lips came down hers and bit her tightly closed lips. Aran could not refuse his kiss. The tongue which licked her lips several times gently penetrated into her mouth. Aran opened her mouth as Enoch wished. The hot tongue scoured her teeth and the roof of her mouth.Much to her dismay, Enoch knew her weak points.\u201cUnngh\u2026\u201dAs he sucked her tongue slightly and bit her lips softly, Aran let out a small nasal sound.Enoch chuckled lowly.The vibrations from her throat were transmitted through her lips and to Enoch.Fearing that she\u2019d fall, Aran hugged his neck and Enoch lifted her body firmly.It looked like a sweet kiss between lovers, but Aran and Enoch knew that it was a cruel violence full of deception.Aran trembled with fear throughout the kiss while Enoch licked her teardrops in the most cordial way.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Those who saw him hurriedly bowed their heads and struggled with all their might pretending they had not seen his swollen cheeks glowing bright red. They heard the Empress\u2019 anger directed towards the Grand Duke and they heard the clear and crisp slap too.\u201cAre you alright, Your Majesty?\u201d asked the aristocratic noble with a blushed look.\u201c\u2026..\u201dAran said nothing.\u201cHer Majesty is in a terrible mood. Pay extra attention.\u201dThough the nearby onlookers were curious about Enoch\u2019s behavior who they knew to be cold-hearted and vicious remained calm and gentle to the Aran, they said nothing. They knew his keen senses and wits were the foundation that kept the Imperial Palace and the empire together. They could only guess that the Grand Duke said words that made the Empress feel helpless.Enoch walked down the hall and touched his red and swollen cheek. Today\u2019s incident would bring Aran into the limelight and he had no plans to clear up any misunderstanding. The more isolated she was from the outside world, the more fun it would become.Before long, he encountered Duke Silas.The duke looked at his face and reacted wonderfully. He, too, heard the rumors of the Grand Duke angering the Empress, but he was not aware that she had slapped him.\u201cOh! Good Lord! I can\u2019t believe this happened\u2026 Her Majesty is too much.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s\u00a0only a given. I offended her. She had given me mercy with only a slap in the cheek. This is nothing,\u201d Enoch answered faithfully with a stunning smile.\u201cI wonder what you did that she would raise her hands at you, Grand Duke,\u201d Duke Silas said curiously.\u201cYou\u2019d not be able to imagine.\u201dDuke Silas tilted his head at his words, but Enoch had no intention to explain any further.\u201cYou seem to have more in your hands than I expected. You look tired, Grand Duke. I regret applying for an interview right away. Who knows what would become of\u00a0me.\u00a0Will I get a slap too?\u201d Duke Silas spoke jokingly.\u201cEverything will be fine,\u201d Enoch replied with a calm smile.\u201cHow can you be so sure?\u201d\u201cBecause I\u2019m the only one in the world who can make Her Majesty upset.\u201dEnoch\u2019s voice was full of conviction as his red eyes flashed for a moment.Duke Silas frowned faintly.The world venerated the Grand Duke as a saint, but somehow Duke Silas felt a strange air whenever he was near the Grand Duke. No matter how gentle he seemed, Duke Silas felt an aura of danger and a conscious warning not to get too close.\u201cBut what brings you here?\u201d Enoch asked.\u201cOh! I have something to speak to you about the consensus decided at the last meeting.\u201dEnoch looked back at the Empress\u2019 office. He was lost in thought for a moment before parting his lips, \u201cHer Majesty is upset right now, so if you don\u2019t mind, let me hear what you have to say first.\u201dThen he reached out his hand to the document Duke Silas was holding.Duke Silas lowered his gaze and looked at Enoch\u2019s wet sleeves.\u201cIt\u2019s from spilt tea,\u201d Enoch answered calmly seeing his gaze.\u201cAh!\u00a0So\u00a0Her Majesty slapped you in the cheek and dared to spill a cup of tea.\u201dAt the duke\u2019s joke,\u00a0Enough\u00a0gave an impervious and meaningless smile.\u201cWhat is it that you need to speak to Her Majesty about?\u201d Enoch asked.\u201cWell\u2026\u201dDuke Silas trailed off without much thought. He felt an impending sense of doom and incompatibility with Enoch. It was a great sin to have the documents be read by anyone else before the ruling empress could take a look, yet Enoch had no qualms with it. It was the first time the duke saw Enoch exceed his authority despite serving as a de facto.Even so, he felt a slight sense of fear from Enoch, but when he saw the marks on his cheek, he suddenly shut his mouth. He remembered that small, pale face desperately holding on to her opinions despite the wolfish aristocrats hounding at her earlier. It fascinated him.Duke Silas had seen the Empress once as a child. She was stubborn and kind and never one to easily anger despite her rough personality.What was it that caused her to become angry?\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s good to share right now. Maybe later.\u201dEnoch\u2019s red eyes flashed and stared squarely at Duke Silas.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He doubted whether she\u2019d been slapped in the face for a moment, but upon a closer look, her white face was smooth and without a small blemish.\u201cFirst of all, I apologize for the sudden request to meet you.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m very tired today, so let\u2019s hurry and get down to business.\u201dThe empress waved her hand weakly. She had picked the wrong day. It was unpleasant to see a new face and to suddenly drown in piles of work.Yes.What a terribly, horrid day.\u201cIt\u2019s about the tax agenda you spoke of at the last meeting,\u201d Duke\u00a0Silar\u00a0said.\u201cHasn\u2019t that agenda already been decided?\u201d Aran cocked an eyebrow.\u201cYes\u2026 but there\u2019s strong backlash amongst the older members. Several of them have expressed their intention of not attending the next meeting. We\u2019ll need to discuss the matter of reconsideration, Your Majesty.\u201dThe empress gave a slight sigh, her long and thick eyelashes blinking. The duke realized that her eyelashes were wet and moist. And when he looked closely, her eyes were red and there were marks on her lips.Was she crying?\u201cI see.\u00a0So\u00a0they\u2019ve probably chosen you as their mediator.\u201d\u201c\u2026Y-yes.\u201d The duke laid down the documents he brought. \u201cThis is the renegotiation they asked for.\u201dThe empress looked over it with tired eyes. She, who had always maintained a perfect persona even if it was all a mere lie, did not care to hide her tiredness today.The duke, staring at her figure, hurriedly bowed as his eyes met with hers.\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d he asked.\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you unhappy with the decision? It\u2019s not sincere.\u201dPerhaps because of what he had seen, the duke looked at her lips closely. He felt his heart-stirring. He had almost forgotten what he came here for. His gaze turned away from her, a sense of dizziness flooding his mind.Then, he saw a cold cup of tea.It had been spilled earlier\u2026The duke blinked.\u201cWhat do you think, Your Majesty?\u201d\u201c\u2026..\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t mean to blame you. Tax evasion is a custom that is prevalent and age-old amongst the aristocratic nobility, Your Majesty.\u201dThe duke could not concentrate. His thoughts were on other things. He wondered why the crumpled documents laid on the empress\u2019 desk, and the\u00a0liquid soaked\u00a0sleeves of the Grand Duke\u2026The empress read the proposal while leaning on the chair in a drowsy manner disturbed Duke Silas\u2019 concentration. He looked at her beautiful face before looking down at her white wrist for a moment. The hem of her sleeve was dripping wet.\u201cYou must know that it\u2019s felony to look at the face of the empress without permission,\u201d the empress said without taking her eyes off the document.\u201cI apologize.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to hear your apology. Leave, now,\u201d her voice was sharper than usual.Duke Silas bowed his head deeper.After leaving the empress, office, the duke\u2019s wild thoughts continued. He couldn\u2019t remember their conversation. Only the afterimage of her light-green eyes, white wrists, and the crumpled documents remained in his mind.He had never thought of the empress as a woman. She tried to play the part of an emperor, not a woman, in front of the nobility, but today, she showed him something that shook his wild heart.It was obvious the Grand Duke did not want him inside her office. Perhaps he, too, found the empress a little too strange today and did not want others to see her woman-like appearance.The two were once engaged. It was a well-known fact that she, a princess at the time, chased after the Grand Duke\u2019s love persistently.Maybe\u2026The duke shook his head with a bitter laugh at his sudden thought of nonsense.What crazy thing was he imagining now?Whatever their relationship was in the past, the moment the Grand Duke killed off her bloodline and family members, the two then had an irrevocable relationship that could never be amended. No matter how loyal the Grand Duke may be, one could clearly see the great hatred in the empress\u2019 eyes.The duke looked back at the palace before mounting his horse.He had a hunch that he would never forget the face of the empress he saw today, and perhaps\u2026 for a very long time.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Enoch said that he\u2019d support her will and not many people openly opposed it, but some of the higher-ranking aristocracies were keen on making trouble.Aran sighed and looked over the documents Duke Silas left her.Cleared\u00a0Changeback, Duke Heston, Marquis Bjorn\u2026The names on the document were the all-powerful aristocracy. Aran rubbed her temples and singled out those who were likely to be persuaded and those who she\u2019d have trouble convincing.Clared\u00a0Changeback\u00a0was a man whom she could persuade and sway to her side. She had known him since childhood and the late emperor helped his father oftentimes. It was worth making the effort to change his mind.Duke Heston seeks a marriage partner for his successor. There\u2019s potential to conciliate with him on the condition that she introduces him to a suitable and stable house.And\u2026Aran\u2019s face darkened when she saw Marquis Bjorn\u2019s name one the list. He was tough, vicious, and a difficult person to work with. He had no antipathy towards her. Duke Silas agreed to persuade him, but even he was skeptical of the outcome. He wasn\u2019t sure how effective the plan would be.If she was unable to change Marquis Bjorn\u2019s mind, her plans would all but go down in smokes. The only reason the aristocracy accepted her will was due to the power of the Grand Duke she borrowed. They\u2019ll readily accept Enoch\u2019s will but it didn\u2019t mean that they\u2019d not snap back.Aran looked down at her palm and bit her lip like a bad habit. She could still feel the sting in her hand.Was he angry? Would he reverse his decision?Aran knew this well\u2026 without him, she was nothing but a weak empress. She was in a precarious situation. She despised him, loathed him to the core, yet she had no choice but to rely on him.With a heavy heart, Aran wrote letters to\u00a0Clared\u00a0Changeback\u00a0and Duke Heston. It was too much for an empress to send a personal letter with hopes to change the minds of noblemen, but\u2026 she was helpless and she didn\u2019t know what else to do.Finishing the last two letters, she put it to the side and pulled out another paper. The previous two letters had been difficult, but this one, this one stumped her.In the end, she couldn\u2019t write a letter to Marquis Bjorn.She knew she couldn\u2019t avoid conflicts with him forever. Still, her mind told her to avoid him so. She hoped that Duke Silas would be able to persuade him.***The first person to reply to the empress\u2019 letter was\u00a0Clared\u00a0Changeback. He expressed his intention to visit her and exchange opinions as soon as he found the time.Aran\u2019s downtrodden face brightened after a long time hearing a positive answer she did not expect. They were estranged now, but they were once friends.It would be easier to deal with Marquis Bjorn if she could change\u00a0Clared\u00a0Changeback\u2019s\u00a0mind. Maybe she\u2019d be able to solve the problems without borrowing Enoch\u2019s powers.Aran\u2019s face, reminded of that man, sank again. She hadn\u2019t seen him since that\u00a0day. She was pleased that he hadn\u2019t shown himself before her at first, but as the days passed and grew longer, he hadn\u2019t visited her once and she began to feel uneasy.Things had changed the first time she met him. At first, it was she who took the initiative, always anxious to see him, to see his face. A large hole filled her heart whenever his presence was not around.Especially when he was a servant. He was always on edge, always afraid, always angry. His life turned upside down. The thought of\u00a0it\u00a0broke Aran and she could do nothing but throw away her pride and hug him tight.But things have changed since the Bloody Wedding. Perhaps Enoch hoped to see her plead and clinging crazily to him like she used to.She suddenly felt a sense of loss thinking of it. Aran never thought of a life without him. She had loved him affectionately when they were young and now, when she loathed him, she couldn\u2019t do anything without him.She gave a mixed, complicated sigh. Marquis Bjorn was nothing compared to Enoch. Regardless, it was better to deal with the marquis herself than to ask for Enoch\u2019s help.Aran finished her day a bit late due to her prolonged worries, returning to her bedroom quarters thereafter with heavy steps.She placed the letter from\u00a0Clared\u00a0Changeback\u00a0on the table and took off her heavy dress.Dressed in thin layers, she refused to allow her maidservant to follow her and headed to the bathroom alone. Only after she was alone did she take off her panties.Since the Bloody Wedding, she had never undressed in front of anyone\u00a0other\u00a0Enoch. No matter how skilled the maid was in cleaning, Aran was embarrassed to show her dirty body in front of others due to her s*xual\u00a0intercourse with Enoch. The habit still lingered even when the purple marks were no longer visible.Aran threw her body in a bath of hot water without hesitation. Unlike her troubled mind, her body quickly warmed up.Soon, sleep washed over her and darkness came.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The warm water cooled off during the amount of time she slept. But the cold was strangely unfeeling.Later on, she realized that a hot body temperature was tightly wrapped around her body from behind. A big band gently covered her mouth, which was about to scream in surprise.\u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201dIt was a voice she grew far too familiar with. Aran looked back slowly. Enoch smiled as their eyes met.Aran couldn\u2019t keep up. She expected that he\u2019d visit her sooner or later, but not like this, not so suddenly\u2026 and in a bathroom no less.She had never dreamed that they would commit to salacious acts in the bathroom.\u201cWhen did you get here\u2026?\u201d Aran asked, hiding her surprise.\u201cNot too long ago. You were asleep and I didn\u2019t want to wake you up.\u201d\u201cDid you\u2026?\u201d Aran replies slowly, pretending to act natural as she tried to free herself from the man holding her tightly around the waist.When she managed to pull his arms away, Enoch pulled her back in and roamed his hand around her belly, waist, and thighs.\u201cYou\u2019ve gained weight in the last few days.\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201d\u201cYou must\u2019ve been comfortable while I was away.\u201dThe hands of Enoch wandering around her waist moved upwards and grabbed her pillowy marshmallows which gently fluttered in the water.\u201cThis here seems to have grown bigger, too.\u201dA voice mingled with laughter could be heard right next to her ear. He nibbed in her ear. Aran, who wasn\u2019t ready yet, was frightened, her body stiffening.\u201cYou won\u2019t ask what I\u2019ve been doing?\u201d said Enoch, tone full of sadness.\u201c\u2026How have you been?\u201d Aran asked reluctantly.The large hands touching her legs and other parts of her troubled Aran, but she decided to endure it. In broad daylight, this was tolerable if not for what had occurred in her office.\u201cI went to visit a certain marquis.\u201d\u201cIs it Marquis Bjorn?\u201d Aran asked back in surprise at the unexpected information.\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWhy\u2026 what\u2026!\u201dEnoch\u2019s elegant but calloused fingers grazed over her nipple. The stubborn nipple hardened and stood up.\u201cYou didn\u2019t disapprove of him, so I went and gave him some advice.\u201dIt was true that she was having a difficult time with Marquis Bjorn, but she never expressed her thoughts out loud. How did he learn of this?\u201cEvery time you look at him, you frown a little,\u201d Enoch replied as if he had read Aran\u2019s thoughts.\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 too much\u2026 for\u2026 a\u2026 simple marquis\u2026nngh\u2026!\u201dSuddenly, his hand dug between her thigh and he inserted a finger inside her fleshy garden without warning. At the sudden act, Aran swallowed her breath and frowned.\u201cDon\u2019t\u2026 ha\u2026 tell me\u2026 you\u2019re\u2026 here to\u2026\u201dThe tearful Aran looked back. Her heart sank when she saw the eyes of the Grand Duke burning with desire.\u201cIf you don\u2019t like it, slap me in the face. I\u2019m willing to accept that much.\u201dOne more finger clung to her coiled flesh, immediately tightening.Instead of saliva, the water helped facilitate the sudden invasion. His hot finger stabbed her deepest parts with obvious intentions. Aran trembled with fright. She was prepared to have a relationship with him since the Bloody Wedding, but she never dreamed that they\u2019d do it in the bathroom.A finger hastily pressed down her sexual zone.\u201cHuguuuh\u2026\u201dAs she groaned, Enoch squeezed her pillowy mounds and sucked her nape and slender shoulders hard.It was an unusual hasty move from Enoch who\u2019d usually take the time to persistently harass her until she heated up to the point of no return.Before Aran was ready, he slid his fingers out and lifted her body so her fleshy entrance sat on top of Enoch\u2019s manhood.\u201cNo\u2026 wait\u2026 hold on\u2026 ahh\u2026!\u201dAs she struggled, Enoch\u2019s hand grabbed her knees and spread her legs wider. A hot, thick rod rushed inside her flower, the water swirling around.Aran was unable to make a sound under the pressure of the water and opened her lips wide. It was more difficult to take Enoch\u2019s manhood in since it had been a while.\u201cAh\u2026 it\u2026 hurts\u2026!\u201dAran complained of pain, but Enoch continued. Finally, his manhood poked her deepest parts.\u201cHa\u2026 alright.\u201d a sigh of contentment rang out in Aran\u2019s ear.Then, Enoch immediately began to lift her waist. The water splashed, in line with his movement.\u201cNo\u2026 not yet\u2026 don\u2019t move!\u201d\u201cJust hold on a little, Your Majesty.\u201dShe couldn\u2019t feel any calm composure in his voice.\u201cNo\u2026\u201dAran\u2019s body was turned around so she was facing him. It wasn\u2019t easy to resist his intentions for Enoch had easily handled her.He lifted Aran from the waist up and lowered her down, her coiled flesh devouring his shaft. It wasn\u2019t fast because they were in the water, but when her flower ate his manhood, a surprised pleasurable moan came out and her insides immediately tightened.Enoch uttered an incomprehensible curse and quickly thrust his waist forward.\u201cUguuuh!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 24": "Chapter 24 - Water (2)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 24: Water (2)A nagging groan rang in the bathroom. Enoch\u2019s hot manhood and the cold water kept Aran awake. Then, at some point, her body began to heat up, too.\u201cAh\u2026 ha\u2026 ah\u2026 ah\u2026!\u201dWhen Aran began to exhale a nasal moan, Enoch stopped thrusting and looked at her face. Aran looked at him with hazy eyes gasping for breath.As Enoch moved his waist around lightly, she groaned and flinched. It was evident that the inner walls squeezing his manhood tight were hotter than before. The liquid swirling around inside was also becoming sticky.Her wait hair curled back; her long neckline and watery collarbone were more visible and exposed. Enoch kissed it as if he possessed ownership of it. As he explored her again, Aran\u2019s heart shook accordingly.\u201cAhhh\u2026!\u201dAran reached out desperately and clung to Enoch\u2019s neck. It was something she\u2019d never find herself doing, but she couldn\u2019t help it because there was only water all around her and she had nothing to hold onto. Her legs, which also didn\u2019t know where to go, were wrapped around his waist.Enoch soon realized that she was reaching her peak.\u201cHa\u2026 haa\u2026 \u201cAran groaned, biting Enoch\u2019s shoulder. At the same time, Enoch pounded and ravished her.Aran swallowed her breath and tried to lift herself up by giving strength to her limbs hanging about languidly, but Enoch embraced her harder, causing her to lean in his arms.Without the strength to fight back, Aran gently laid her head on the nape of his neck. Her soft marshmallows were crushed under the firm, hot chest of a man. Her arm, which wrapped around his neck, lost its strength and scratched Enoch\u2019s muscular back.Enoch\u2019s naked body was full of scars. Traces of it were from the time spent around the battlefield. Enoch\u2019s body flinched for a moment as her fingers touched the scar on his back. The half-dazed Aran didn\u2019t notice it, but she could feel him becoming hot.It was very rare to be tangled up with each other like this. Enoch would usually never take off his clothes, and Aran didn\u2019t intend to either. After all, what he wanted from her was neither communion nor warmth, Aran thought with a hazy mind.In the meantime, Enoch continued to play with her body. When she trembled she could feel his manhood stretching, causing her grip around his neck to tighten.\u201cAre you cold?\u201dNot having the strength to answer, Aran nodded lightly. Her body had cooled down and she felt a chill. She couldn\u2019t help but get close to his warmth to escape the cold.Enoch held her waist firmly and thrust again.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dIn succession, when her body was lifted into the air, a startled Aran hung from his neck. She could hear a short chuckle. And before she knew it, a lump of completely erect meat pierced her.\u201cUngh!\u201dAran clung to him and groaned.When Enoch opened the door and walked across the bathroom, Aran suddenly came to her senses late. She shook her head and asked, \u201cThe lady-in-waiting\u2026?\u201dUsually, whenever Enoch arrived, her servants would walk away, but today she felt uneasy. She couldn\u2019t confirm whether there was no one outside.Anxiety immediately flashed through her eyes. She didn\u2019t think he\u2019d have done this with her servants on standby. She couldn\u2019t predict his unpredictable nature at times.\u201cAre you worried that eyes are watching?\u201d Enoch looked at her with a look of amusement. \u201cI guess you shouldn\u2019t go out then. Her Majesty doesn\u2019t like to show her naked body to others.\u201d\u201cWait\u2026 that means there\u2019s someone out\u2026\u201dBefore she could finish her words, Enoch stood up and walked towards the door, her back pressed against the wood. Without realizing what was happening, Aran unconsciously wrapped her legs around his waist and tightened the grip of her arm around his neck.As Enoch hammered her fleshy coils, his manhood going in and out were clearly revealed. Only then did Aran realize his intention with an astonished face.\u201cSt\u2026 st\u2026\u201dEnoch moved around roughly before she could speak out. His manhood poked her womb each time he thrust forward.Aran swallowed her moaning scream.Every time he thrust forward, her body bumped against the door and thumped. The uneasy posture in the air made Aran anxious. Her cold body began to heat up after several pounding from Enoch\u2019s thick rod.The rattling of the door and the clatter of flesh mixing together sounded dizzying.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dEvery time his shaft stabbed her deeply, a spontaneous sound came out of her lips. If her servants were outside, they\u2019d surely wonder what she was doing. Her back and plumpy bottoms tingled, but she couldn\u2019t care less about it.\u201cAh\u2026 stop\u2026 stop\u2026 ugguh\u2026!\u201dAran cried and begged, but Enoch didn\u2019t listen. Rather, he began to move violently listening to her cries. He stabbed her harder, pounded her roughly, hammered her insides as if to incite tears from her.Aran could not recover her senses from pain, pleasure, and fear. Whatever reason that ran through her head had all been melted away and she let out tears.Enoch kissed Aran several times around her furrowed brows. Then, he licked and swallowed her tears greedily.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He shuddered, releasing his white fluids inside her. The white fluids mingled with saliva and soaked Aran\u2019s bottoms.Enoch opened the door thereafter.Frightened, Aran searched the bedroom in a hurry. There was no one. Only then did she realize that he was playing with her. At the same time, as the tension eased, a sense of shame surged in.Enoch slowly pulled himself out, looking at her face stained with anger and shame.\u201cAre you going to slap me again?\u201dAran didn\u2019t answer. Her clumsy anger would only entertain him further.Enoch walked all the way to her bed, keeping her hold and making sure she not slip from his grip.A fluffy sheet touched her back. The sheets got wet but there was no one who cared.Enoch climbed onto her. She tried to get up, but he pressed her shoulders down to keep her from moving.\u201cStop\u2026\u201dAran shook her head.He stroked her pale face with his big hand. The touch at first glance was friendly.\u201cYou must reward the servant for his service.\u201d\u201c\u2026I\u2019ll give you what you want\u2026 so hurry up and leave\u2026\u201d\u201cI want you,\u201d Enoch smiled, slowly spreading her legs.Aran\u2019s eyes widened and she tried to close her legs back, but it was futile. Enoch\u2019s strength was greater than hers.\u201cStop\u2026\u201d\u201cYour Majesty, all you can offer to me is this body. You\u2019re mine, Your Majesty.\u201dBefore Aran could reply, a large swelling meat entered her roots. The sensitive inner walls spat out moist wetness and coiled around his shaft in full.\u201cAh!\u201dAran unknowingly dug her nails on Enoch\u2019s back. Enoch didn\u2019t care even though her sharp nails hurt. His manhood repeatedly devoured her and all Aran could do was writhe under his arms.***Aran had washed herself earlier and already she\u2019d been ruined by Enoch\u2019s white fluids. He embraced her with all his might and enjoyed himself to the fullest. Her sticky body felt unpleasant.Aran turned her head towards the table, ignoring the persistent stroking of his manhood.\u201c?\u201dThere was nothing on the table. She blinked her eyes. She was sure that she put Clared\u2019s letter there.\u201cAre you looking for Clared\u2019s letter?\u201d Enoch asked, pressing down on the nipple which rose with excitement.Aran bit her lip and nodded.\u201cI threw it into the fireplace.\u201d\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d asked Aran in a restless voice.Instead of answering, Enoch took his hand off her and rose from the bead.\u201cHe said he\u2019d visit the Imperial Palace sooner or later.\u201d\u201cYou won\u2019t be able to meet,\u201d Enoch replied.The sound of water pouring into the empty glass echoed and Aran felt a great thirst when she heard the noise.Enoch returned to bed with a glass of water, but she didn\u2019t have the slightest strength to lift her hand. Enoch was aware of it and didn\u2019t bother to hand over the glass. Instead, he supported Aran\u2019s back, raised her upper body, and pressed the tip of the glass on her lips.The water, apparently preheated, was moderately cooled, neither too cold nor too hot. Aran carefully stuck out her lips and drank the water, but she couldn\u2019t swallow properly and most of the water spilled.\u201cYou\u2019re cute,\u201d Enoch said.Enoch smiled, drank a glass of water, and kissed Aran\u2019s mouth.The water from Enoch\u2019s mouth came through her lips. Aran gently swallowed the water he handed her. After repeating the action several times, her thirst had been quenched.Aran looked up at Enoch with wet eyes as she demanded an explanation. Enoch looked at her cold face and light-green eyes. Her eyes glowed as if the disgrace from before was nothing. Her ever-consistent stubbornness was something he loved but sometimes it got annoying, like now.\u201cHe\u2019s an influential nobleman. If I don\u2019t persuade him, people against my will become aggressive,\u201d Aran said.\u201cAnd how will you persuade him?\u201dYou\u2019re helpless. It was as if Enoch looked at her with those silent words in mind. Aran bit her lips.\u201c\u2026But I can\u2019t let go of the chance. Clared\u2019s a sweet guy, so if I tell him, I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll understand. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll help me out.\u201dAran\u2019s voice grew smaller and smaller. She knew how stupid her words sounded. Clared Changeback was a great lord defending the southern border before he was her childhood friend.But Enoch was right. She had nothing to offer him.\u201cIf you knew how he looked at you, you\u2019d have no desire to meet him.\u201dEnoch smiled and caressed Aran\u2019s cheek with his long fingers.Aran didn\u2019t understand a word he said and blinked blankly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The foolish empress still believes that Clared Changeback was a friend, but that shallow friendship had long gone sour.Clared Changeback, remembered by Enoch, was an absent-minded man who always looked at Aran\u2019s neck and ankle with passionate perverted eyes.When Enoch was still Aran\u2019s servant, it was hard to count the many times Clared bullied him.The passing time would not have waned that perverted man\u2019s shady desire. The thought of Aran, who had no sense of humor, sitting in front of him and talking of the perverted man made him upset.Why? He didn\u2019t know why\u2026 he simply didn\u2019t like the idea of her seeing him.\u201cIf you want to change the mind of Clared Changeback, it would be faster for you to ask me than to meet him in person and convince him.\u201dEnoch, hiding his innermost thoughts, raised Aran\u2019s helpless hand and kissed it.\u201cI don\u2019t care how you treat me in front of others. If you act cute and pretty like this on the bed, I\u2019m always willing to play as the empress\u2019 voice. Isn\u2019t that easy?\u201dAran\u2019s face trembled with contempt. As she blinked slowly, tears flowed down silently. Somehow, the look on her face made Enoch\u2019s heart bleed.\u2026Why was she crying?Enoch drew her in his embrace without hesitation. The weak woman clung to his arms without resistance.She was calm even when he was touching her pillowy mounds and groping her wet crevice. She wasn\u2019t sure if it was his condescending words or that she didn\u2019t have the strength to resist, but it didn\u2019t matter.She allowed her to vent his pent-up desire inside her.* * *Aran sat still with a stiff face, lowering her gaze. Sometimes, she was required to attend a banquet because she was empress.She sighed a small sigh that no one could hear.Today\u2019s banquets was to mark the first anniversary of her succession as empress. The banquet was smaller than all previous banquets.Aran had a difficult time leaving the banquet in the middle for she was the main character of the show.Though it wasn\u2019t so large, there were a few aristocrats attending. They made false congratulatory remarks to the empress while their eyes searched for the presence of the Grand Duke who they were sure was hiding somewhere in the banquet hall.Aran moistened her lips with wine in celebration. She couldn\u2019t drink well, but she thought she\u2019d be able to endure this time, but eventually, her head became dizzy. She put down the glass of wine that was not even half empty.When she was young and immature, she yearned to attend a banquet several times, now she despised it and loathed the backbreaking work. Back then, when she had no worries in the world, she\u2019d excitedly change into many dresses throughout the banquet and danced joyfully. It felt like a dream.What she was wearing now was a worn-out dress with a dull green color and high collar covering her neck. Her hands were covered with gloves.The weather now was in late spring, and it felt a little too hot to wear such clothes, but she had no choice. Enoch left marks all over her body.Aran pulled the black mesh gloves up to cover her slightly exposed wrist.\u201cYour Majesty.\u201dAran raised her head to the voice of a poet. Only then did she realize that the eyes of the aristocrats watched her keenly.\u201cThe first dance should be performed by Her Majesty,\u201d someone shouted.\u201cI don\u2019t mind. They can dance without me.\u201d\u201cBut only after Her Majesty dances can the others dance.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201dAran looked at the aristocrats with a flushed face. She had no choice but to dance with one of them because there was no Enoch around. And besides, she didn\u2019t know who to dance with.The young noblemen were aware of these and looked at each other.The empress\u2019 current position was ambiguous. Her popularity among the aristocrats due to the tax audit was at rock bottom. However, there were many people who greedily sought after her as the position of emperor was vacant.\u201cWould you dance with me, if you don\u2019t mind, Your Majesty?\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d Aran asked with a perplexed face.\u201cIt\u2019s a joke,\u201d the poet said. \u201cDon\u2019t mind it.\u201dAran breathed deeply. No matter who became her partner, it would be uncomfortable. She intended to grab the person closest to her and quickly dance to put an end to this embarrassing situation.And just in time, she saw Duke Silas not far away.In conclusion, she would\u2019ve ended up dancing with Enoch, the Grand Duke who handled those who opposed her, but Duke Silas, he was simply trying to help her out of goodwill. It wouldn\u2019t be bad to thank him on this occasion.As soon as Aran took a step forward, someone grabbed her hand.\u201cWhere are you going, Your Majesty?\u201d Enoch looked at her with a curious face. \u201cIf you haven\u2019t decided on a partner, why don\u2019t you dance with me?\u201dEnoch knelt, kissing her hand. His hot lips touched the back of her hand, his fingers brushing the inside of her wrist.Aran bent her fingers unknowingly. Those red eyes she was unable to read stared at her.The young noblemen after the unmarried empress lost their motivation as soon as the Grand Duke appeared. No one would be willing to dance with her now that Enoch stepped out.Aran, who knew him, nodded reluctantly.It wasn\u2019t a seemingly strange combination.Aran was the empress of the empire and Enoch was the noblest man in the empire. Besides, he was always at the empress\u2019 side.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 27": "Chapter 27 - A Proper Partner (1)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 27: A Proper Partner (1)Enoch naturally led Aran to the center of the hall. The musicians played an elegant song and soon, the dance began accordingly.\u201cThis reminds me of your debut ball. I danced with you for the first time that day,\u201d Enoch laughed, recalling those happy memories.Aran\u2019s face paled. She, too, clearly remembered that day.Her fourteen-year-old self wore a white dress she long prepared months ago. She was happy and eager to hold her fiancee\u2019s hand tightly. Until then, she didn\u2019t have the slightest idea what would happen to her and Enoch in the future.When the young lover finished dancing, the knights suddenly rushed into the banquet hall. The knight, who looked to be the highest-ranked, ordered his men to bring down Enoch and his family down with a cold face Aran had never seen before.The House of Roark was a noted house of warriors, but it was not enough for the Grand Duke to deal with the fully armed knights without weapons. The once-elegant Grand Duke rolled onto the floor in a disarray. Their son, Enoch, was also overpowered by the knights.\u201cWhat are you doing? Stop! Stop!\u201dAran tried to stop the knights, but all was futile.\u201cFather!\u201dAran looked at the emperor with hopes that her father would intervene. Staring at his daughter\u2019s face for a moment, the emperor shook his head coolly.\u201cTake the princess to the bedroom.\u201d\u201cWait a minute\u2026! Father! No, Enoch\u2026!\u201dA knight dragged her back as she clung to Enoch.When their eyes met, Enoch said calmly, \u201cNothing will happen, Your Highness. Don\u2019t worry.\u201dThose words were the first lie Enoch had ever told Aran.The Grand Duke and his wife were executed the next morning. News of Enoch\u2019s execution date was set a week later.When the shocked Aran refused to eat, eyes devoid of life, the emperor showed mercy to Enoch and demoted his status to a common servant.Aran, who recalled those old memories, shivered.She was sure that day was a terrible memory for Enoch.Enoch laughed, finding her expression amusing.\u201cWhy are you so nervous? Are you afraid I\u2019ll commit a crime here?\u201d he whispered in a small voice, lips pressed close to her ear.Aran couldn\u2019t face him and turned her head.She couldn\u2019t remember how the dance ended. In a few minutes, her fatigue grew and Aran went back to her seat with a dazed mind.Meanwhile, a duke followed her and sat on the table next to her.\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve seen you dance, Your Majesty. You haven\u2019t grown rusty.\u201dAran turned her head towards the man speaking to her.It was Duke Heston.\u201cOf course. It was a pleasure to dance with the Grand Duke,\u201d she said, smiling.\u201cThank you,\u201d Enoch answered absentmindedly.Duke Heston frowned faintly. His purpose was the empress, not the Grand Duke. Putting his composure together, he said, \u201c It would have been better if your partner is your husband.\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Aran expressed a face of embarrassment at his abrupt remark.\u201cYou\u2019ve passed eighty seasons, Your Majesty, making you twenty this year. It doesn\u2019t make sense that you\u2019ve no emperor next to your side yet.\u201d\u201cI haven\u2019t thought of getting married,\u201d Aran answered sincerely.She wasn\u2019t in a proper place to properly love someone.Duke Heston clicked his tongue.\u201cThat can\u2019t be, Your Majesty. It\u2019s important to have someone by your side to strongly rule over the empire. And who will succeed after you?\u201dSuccession.Aran\u2019s face hardened. She knew this. However, she doubted whether she\u2019d be able to fulfill her duty well.Years had passed since she last had her menstruation. Originally, her monthly cycle was irregular, but it hadn\u2019t arrived after ascending the throne. The thought of it embarrassed her and she wasn\u2019t willing to relay the information to the duke.\u201cYour Majesty\u2019s position will be enhanced with a proper partner of strong background and a successor.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not easy to decide on a national marriage, right? But I\u2019ll sincerely consider your suggestion.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re still young, but you might miss the door of opportunity after a year or two. You\u2019re not a man, so you don\u2019t have much time left.\u201dThe longer the duke spoke, the more flushed Aran became.When Duke Heston tried to speak more, Enoch, who was listening, intervened.\u201cDidn\u2019t Her Majesty say she hasn\u2019t considered it yet? She\u2019s still young. It\u2019s not too late to wait and see,\u201d said Enoch.Duke Heston furrowed his brows. \u201cPardon my words, but it\u2019s not strange for Her Majesty to have two children at her age. The issue of succession isn\u2019t something of a problem, it\u2019s the when. If you, the Grand Duke, are a proper candidate, why not propose yourself?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 28": "Chapter 28 - A Proper Partner (2)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 28: A Proper Partner (2)Duke Heston was feeling somewhat uneasy. He didn\u2019t fear the Grand Duke. He\u2019d even recently visited a spy agency for an audit, but his attempt to monopolize the empress was distorted.\u2018You still think you\u2019re the empress\u2019 fiance,\u2019 the duke thought.He believed Enoch was responsible for eighty percent of the empress\u2019 failure to marry. It was not unreasonable to hear rumors of both the empress and the Grand Duke in their prime and single and that the two still harbored past affection.The Grand Duke\u2019s attitude of being so close towards the empress also stirred up many rumors.But those who watched the two closely knew that it was all nonsense. The empress was cold to the Grand Duke, and it was the Grand Duke who acted plainly to the point of holding affection for the empress alone.Duke Heston could not understand why the Grand Duke stuck to the empress\u2019 side and claimed to be his loyal dog. The empress didn\u2019t even have a decent bone of loyalty to throw at the Grand Duke.One this was for sure, the Grand Duke won\u2019t do good for Duke Heston\u2019s plan. He had the ambition to place his son on the seat of the throne as the emperor. The weak and docile empress was the perfect fit to string around in his grasp.Duke Heston would have a rocky path, but he was confident in his plans.\u201cIt isn\u2019t too late now, so why not try to figure out suitable candidates as your partner, Your Majesty.\u201d\u201cStop talking about the matter, Duke,\u201d Enoch spat out coldly.Duke Heston\u2019s flushed face turned red.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to say this, but it seems as if you don\u2019t know your place. Her Majesty is the ruler of me, the ball, and the empire, not some seed that she\u2019ll give birth to. Oh, but if she does, her partner won\u2019t be from the House of Heston.\u201dThe surrounding air cooled down.At Enoch\u2019s wild and blatant words, Aran forgot what to say. When the two of them were alone, she knew Enoch loathed the aristocrats in official positions and poured out all kinds of vulgar words, but in public, he\u2019d keep his manners in mind.What was he doing now?Duke Heston\u2019s face looked like it was about to burst.\u201cIsn\u2019t the Grand Duke a bit too unbecoming? How dare you criticize me for putting out a suggestion?! How dare you say such vulgar words\u2026\u201d\u201cI only speak of this because I can see right through you,\u201d Enoch continued his words, not bothering to hide his ridicule, \u201cAs you said, Her Majesty is a woman, not a man, so why don\u2019t you find someone else for your son to give birth a descendant to without involving Her Majesty?\u201d\u201cWh\u2026 what?\u201d\u201cGrand Duke\u2026\u201dSurprised, Aran unwittingly grabbed Enoch\u2019s arm, but he showed no signs of stopping.\u201cAre you suggesting that we put an illegitimate child on the throne? Seeing that you have ignored the legitimacy of the six-hundred-year-old royal family\u2019s history, I doubt you\u2019d have a different mind!\u201d Duke Heston protested loudly.\u201cI\u2019m merely speaking the truth. Whether the child is illegitimate or not, whether the father\u2019s of high status or low, whether he\u2019s a mere commoner, it doesn\u2019t matter. Whoever Her Majesty chooses doesn\u2019t matter. What are you planning? And who in the world has more legitimacy than a child born of the empress\u2019 womb?\u201dDuke Heston shut his mouth. He thought about how to refute the Grand Duke\u2019s words, but he couldn\u2019t think of anything. If he were to deny the legitimacy of whom the empress gave birth to, it would be tantamount to insulting the imperial family.\u201cStop it, both of you.\u201dAran eventually could not stand the sight any further and intervened in between the two men. Except for Enoch, she, who had no experience with men, was perplexed and embarrassed by the topic that drove her wild.\u201cI still have much to take care of in terms of the empire\u2019s affair. I\u2019ve only recently ascended the throne. It\u2019s better we talk about the matter of a partner and succession after the political situation has stabilized,\u201d said Aran, calmly.\u201cYes, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Enoch bowed his head.\u201cI, too, was rash. Know that I had no other ulterior motives, Your Majesty,\u201d Duke Heston reluctantly apologized.\u201cI understand.\u201dOf course, Aran didn\u2019t believe it, but she accepted the duke\u2019s apology to quickly remedy the boiling situation. However, the cold mood hadn\u2019t been easily resolved.The duke secretly clenched his teeth and glared at the Grand Duke.The empress hesitated when speaking about the matters of succession. A little push might have led to a meeting with his son\u2026 but the Grand Duke had to interfere. Now the guarantee that the empress would listen to his plea disappeared.Enoch ignored Duke Heston\u2019s blazing glare while Aran, nervous, picked up a glass of wine and took a sip. Enoch frowned, knowing she had low resistance to wine and alcohol.\u201cSuch matters only occurred because of their excessive loyalty, so don\u2019t worry. It\u2019s a good day, so enjoy to your heart\u2019s content.\u201dAran forced a bright smile to calm the awkward atmosphere.Enoch looked at her strangely.Meanwhile, some brave souls approached him while Duke Heston, with an astringent face, went away, glaring at the Grand Duke.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

That day, she couldn\u2019t sleep and eat.Still, she couldn\u2019t allow herself to show her feelings. Enoch didn\u2019t like annoying girls. He was always polite to Aran, but sometimes her heart sank when she saw his red eyes filled with unseen irritation.What was his intention of bringing up the story now?\u201cI was young and immature then. Though it\u2019s a bit too late now, I apologize.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to apologize.\u201dIn a somewhat irritating gesture, Enoch beckoned the servant over to fill the empty glass with wine.Aran looked at his beautiful profile.He looked irritated, sure, but she didn\u2019t know why. Even if the situation changed, she\u2019d not be able to understand him and she didn\u2019t have the courage to ask either.All Aran could do at times like this was stay still.Aran\u2019s gaze moved to his neck and shoulders, then to his left hand holding a glass of wine. There was nothing on his ring finger. His empty fingers bothered her, perhaps reminded of the tradition.Like the royal imperial family, high-ranking aristocrats tended to marry early. Aran wondered why Enoch hadn\u2019t chosen a partner yet. She also wasn\u2019t aware if he was dating someone.The House of Roark was a famous house notorious for its skilled warriors. Enoch was the only child born from that house. The late Grand Duke didn\u2019t want his son to marry Aran, who was weak.Now that Enoch was no longer Aran\u2019s fiance, he could have any woman he liked.Somehow, she thought of how Enoch would treat his wife.Would he be overbearing like he was to her, or as friendly like he was to those noblewomen a little while ago? If he had a wife, he wouldn\u2019t look in her direction, right\u2026?Suddenly, she felt strange. She wasn\u2019t sure what it was, but she felt something strange.Enoch, noticing Aran\u2019s gaze, looked at her.\u201cIs there something you want to say?\u201d\u201cWhy did you\u2026\u201dAran, who was about to ask why he hadn\u2019t married yet, shut her mouth quickly.

It was the least confident thing that she could do. Her menstrual period was long gone and it was questionable whether she would be able to conceive with a weak body like hers.The Grand Duke and Duke Heston\u2019s argument today ended in a small uproar, but in the future, pressure on succession and marriage would adamantly continue in earnest. It was clear that her position would weaken if the would-be emperor found out she was unable to bear a child.Aran thought that if somehow, life was like a fairytale, then she\u2019d like to give birth to a child.No\u2026Aran cancelled the thought.Miraculously, even if she did bear a child, she wasn\u2019t sure what would become of that child. Would her child be like her? Weak in both body and mind? No\u2026 Aran didn\u2019t want her child to go through the same thing like she did.Even though the empress was right next to Enoch, the aristocrats, ignoring her, were busy flattering the Grand Duke.

Regardless, I appreciate your effort,\u201d said Aran.\u201cI didn\u2019t do anything big that would warrant your gratefulness. All I said was a simple greeting. It was the Grand Duke who persuaded the marquis.\u201d\u201cRegardless, you came forward and mustered the courage to face them. It\u2019s quite brave of you.\u201dOn that day\u2026 when she slapped Enoch on the cheek, Aran wanted to throw everything away and run away to a place where no one would find her. She was grateful the duke appeared wanting to help her.Suddenly, she felt apologetic.She was overly insensitive and cold to him that day.Duke Silas looked at Aran, her face a little sullen with remorse. She looked real pretty.\u201cSometimes I wonder\u2026\u201dAran looked up.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201c\u2026Your innermost thoughts. I often feel like you\u2019re walking the hard road on purpose,\u201d Duke Silas said.Aran laughed bitterly.\u201cWhat person in their right path would want to take the difficult path? There\u2019s no easy option.\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you making a choice right now, Your Majesty?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not an option. It seems like it from an outside onlooker. Do you think there\u2019s an emperor and empress able to turn a blind eye to the people of the empire due to the sensibilities of the aristocracy?\u201d Aran\u2019s voice was unusually clear and sharp.\u201cI know I look incompetent, but if I don\u2019t step up, they\u2019ll squeeze the blood of the people in cold blood without care.\u201dHowever incompeted Aran was as an empress, she would never forget her duties and responsibilities to the people.Duke Silas remained silent for a while.\u2018Maybe he\u2019s laughing,\u2019\u00a0Aran thought.\u201cYour Majesty, I\u2019m afraid that if you hadn\u2019t ascended the throne\u2026 then you\u2019d have become a revolutionary.\u201dIt was an unexpected remark. Aran looked up at Enoch. His eyes were as blue as the clear sky on a clear day.\u201cEmperor, empress, and revolutionary\u2026 isn\u2019t it too extreme? And if someone like you who thinks herself incompetent, then you\u2019re bound to fail long before it starts,\u201d Duke Silas answered, smiling. \u201cI\u2019m sure your revolution won\u2019t ever become a success.\u201dAran missed the moment to scold the duke for his bluntness, agonizing whether he was making fun of her.\u201cYou need to become an inspiration to the people, Your Majesty.\u201d\u201c\u2026Are you mocking me right now?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not joking.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

At least I\u2019d have been someone else\u2019s manure.\u201dDuke Silas tilted his head at her words.\u201cWhy do you say that, Your Majesty? Isn\u2019t the Grand Duke like a limb to you? As long as his loyalty towards you remains strong, there is nothing you can\u2019t achieve.\u201dThe empress tended to underestimate herself too much, but in the eyes of the duke, she was quite rational and of sensible judgment. It was a great problem that she didn\u2019t think too highly of herself. If she had risen to the throne normally, she\u2019d be a great soldier. This was the duke\u2019s thoughts.For a moment, Aran staggered. Fortunately, the duke firmly supported her back. Aran was nervous. Her petite back and waist could be felt under his palm.Aran, who took the center stage again, answered calmly, \u201cIsn\u2019t his authority not mine?\u201dAs usual, the empress was sensitive when it came to the issue of the Grand Duke.\u201cYour Majesty, does the Grand Duke make you feel uncomfortable?\u201dDuke Silas asked a question he had long been curious about.He\u2019d not have believed it even if the mores declared that she\u2019d welcome the Grand Duke warmly. Though the Grand Duke brutally killed the late emperor, it was understandable. This was the way of politics and power.If only things were different, the duke believed Aran would have made a great empress. No matter the environment she grew up in, she probably didn\u2019t expect to have her own blood sell her off as if she was a mere pr*stitute. Her own brother had tried to sell his only sister to the old Marquis Maxwell to fill his own interest.Marquis Maxwell was a rich man, though he had a bad habit of changing his wife regularly. If the duke was in her place, he\u2019d have longa*sassinated his brother before the Grand Duke could take action.The empress lowered her gaze.\u201cI\u2019ll pretend I didn\u2019t hear the question just now. I had a great time. Thank you, duke.\u201dLike he saw in the office, coldness and heavy fatigue appeared on her small face. The duke realized his mistake and tried to apologize, but Aran let go of his hand. At the same time, the music came to an end.Duke Silas asked her to dance again, but Aran declined.Aran returned to her seat and quenched her dry throat with a glass of water.She knew that her personal opinion towards Enoch in an official position was inappropriate to speak loudly. Yet whenever she saw his face or even the name of it, a complicated mix of emotion came running down.Setting the glass down, Aran quietly rose from her seat and headed for the deserted garden. She needed fresh air and she was sure Enoch wouldn\u2019t notice whether she went away. He was too occupied. Besides, there won\u2019t be many people who\u2019ll notice her absence for a while.But choosing the garden wasn\u2019t the best decision. The lovers, who had left their seats earlier than Aran, were whispering words of love between the trees and the flowers. The man\u2019s courtship and the woman\u2019s moans could be heard from all over the place.The poet who followed her was also embarrassed. He was confused whether to expel the half naked lovers or turn them away by informing them secretly that the empress had come.Aran put her finger on her lips, hinting at the servant\u2019s silence before hurriedly walking away before the half-naked lovers noticed her presence. It was a hundred times better to go back to the banquet hall and sit down than to hear that woman\u2019s voice full of excitement.Aran, who couldn\u2019t see in the dead of the night, followed the servant with squinting eyes. As she neared the banquet hall, a hand suddenly pulled her in the dark and hugged her waist tightly.

The fingernail marks on her cheeks had faded and weren\u2019t particularly noticeable.He didn\u2019t talk to Aran nor set his gaze on her \u2018till he arrived at the bedroom.The maidservants opened the door. No one questioned why the Grand Duke was with the empress.Aran flinched\u2014a habit\u2014 when she heard the heavy door closing. After that, Enoch looked down at her. The courteous mask he wore in front of others was no longer.Aran looked away, unable to make eye contact. Enoch tried to keep her in bed, but Aran shook her head.\u201cI have to change my clothes,\u201d she said.It was dark. It wasn\u2019t obvious at first, but it was clear that her dress was full of grass and soils staining it. She didn\u2019t want to lie in bed with her dirty dress.\u201cYou can change the sheets in the morning,\u201d said Enoch, calmly.\u201cIt won\u2019t feel right.

Now please\u2026 ah\u2026!\u201dCarefully trying to get away from him, Enoch suddenly pulled her roughly towards him and began taking off her dress. The thin dress had almost been torn at his hasty touch.\u201cYou don\u2019t need to call anyone. I\u2019ll take care of you whenever you want.\u201d\u201cWait\u2026 stop\u2026\u201d\u201cJust bear with it a little bit, even if it\u2019s disgusting.\u201dHe crept close to her and brought her to the bathroom to wash her dirty hands, feet, face.Fearing his manner which was more violence than usual, Aran had no choice but to follow his will. A day or two had passed since they last did it. He would seek her presence again, but this time, he seemed genuinely angry.Bringing her back to her bed, Enoch stopped off her wet panties, laughing ferociously as she trembled. His eyes glistened with unrelenting desire looking down at her fullness.\u201cYou can stop shaking the bed,\u201d he whispered, stroking her white-skinned chest. He looked like he was asking for permission, but Aran knew otherwise. \u201cI thought all you knew was being fearful of me or shaking, but who knew that you were good at being nice to a man.\u201d\u201cWhen did I\u2026 when\u2026\u201dAran clenched her fist. She tried to remember why he was angry, but nothing came to mind.Seeing him continue to bring up Duke Silas\u2019 name, Enoch might have been unhappy that she was dancing with him, but this was normal. It often occurred at a regular banquet. Also, the conversation she had with him wasn\u2019t much.Enoch punched her n*pple as if reprimanding her for not being able to concentrate.\u201cNnghh!\u201dIn an instant, Aran flinched. A large hand grasped her mounds firmly like soft marshmallows ready to melt.\u201cIt hurts\u2026\u201d Aran, terrified that she\u2019d melt, begged.Enoch pretended indifference and looked at her, but in truth, he was blinded with anger. He knew Aran was unwell, but he ignored her current state. What he wanted was to dig inside her body and former her with pain and without preparation. She wanted to let her know that he could do all he desired and pleased.Aran kept trembling for a while. She She couldn\u2019t read his mind, she couldn\u2019t, but she did react sensitively to his feelings. After all, she had a habit of looking at his face and current mood when they were young.She was somewhat proud at this thought.Enoch relaxed his grip on her mound and bit on her n*pole through the crack of his fingers. This pink nipple so sensitive to the slightest touch was one of his favorite parts about her. It stood firmly.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dAran let out a nasal sound when he ducked her proper.

As she reached her peak, her loins heated up again. \u201cHaaa\u2026\u201dWas it due to the blindfold that her senses were heightened? Her body was hotter than usual. Enoch\u2019s hand rubbing her meaty flesh was not enough to satisfy her. She needed a far greater stimulus. The itchiness which began under her heated entrance spread all over her body.\u201cAh\u2026 Enoch\u2026 no more\u2026\u201d Aran murmured an unexpected entreaty and gasped. However, Enoch\u2019s finger lingered on her innards. He stopped caressing her when she reached her peak and touched her again when she cooled down. Eventually, she could stand it no longer and raised her waist up, her shoulder shuddering.\u201cTell me you want it,\u201d Enoch whispered in her ear.Aran could hardly utter a word. Still, there was that strand of pride left. She was not willing to follow him. Her pride was hard to break, but her subconscious knew that it would soon break.Enoch immediately let go of his hand. Not only his hand, but the warmth around her back disappeared.Without realization, Aran turned and reached for the air, but she caught nothing. She was close to tearing up.

Aran hesitated what to do. It was solely up to Enoch what to do with her. She turned to the side and slowly moved to reach the edge of the bed. She went down to her knees. She could not see the front. Aran moved, almost crawling. Her pride slowly bubbled up. She had many regrets, but it was too late. She would always make the same mistake knowing that there was a price to pay.Aran, in a hurry, stretched out her arms wide when she could not find him. She was not sure what she was doing.\u201c\u2026..\u201dIn an instant, she lost her balance and fell to the floor. But before she could, a large hand hurried to catch her. He safely put her back on the bed.\u201cYour Majesty, you need to be careful. I\u2019d hate to see you injured.\u201dSomehow, Aran was relieved. Pleasure would come to her and everything would soon be over.\u201cHonestly, I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d be so anxious to find me.\u201dHe looked at her like she was a cute puppy drenched in rain and needed tender care. Slowly, he spread her legs and smiled softly.Soon, something thick and blunt slowly rubbed the entrance of her flesh. An unfamiliar touch caused her to stiffen. The size and shape of this thing was familiar, but she could not feel the heat of warmth that she had taken for granted. It was immediately apparent that it was not Enoch\u2019s manhood.\u201cWha\u2026 no\u2026!\u201dWhen the astounded Aran tried to move, Enoch slowly pushed the toy inside. She did not know what this material was, but it was cold, very cold. She could feel it forcing itself inside her in a downward force.\u201cRelax, Your Majesty. If you don\u2019t, I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll get hurt.\u201dIt was a soothing and gentle tone, but it further sent Aran in a fearful spiral.\u201cThis\u2026 no\u2026 Enoch\u2026 stop\u2026 no\u2026 please\u2026 stop\u2026\u201d\u201cRelax, Your Majesty.

There was a difference in temperature and texture she felt that was distinctly different from that of Enoch.\u201cI prepared something different because you don\u2019t seem to want mine, Your Majesty.\u201dAran did not notice anything unusual in the bedroom. He must have hidden this foreign item somewhere she could not see. She did not have the mind to think about it. If she knew there was something like this, she would have hurriedly thrown it away.\u201cEnoch\u2026. aah\u2026 haaa\u2026 stop\u2026\u201dThe foreign item invading her private parts sent her in a shock. She never expected nor thought that something not human would be inside her.At first, it was a slow prickling feeling, but it suddenly picked up speed and sank deeper inside her. The feeling of it rubbing against her delicate fleshy meat was overly stimulating. Aran forgot the faint dull ache as she felt her core rising to its peak.\u201cHaaa\u2026\u201d A mixture of both cries and moans flowed constantly. She could not bear it any longer. \u201cNnghh\u2026\u201dShe was reaching her peaks. It was coming. Her inner walls contracted and relaxed as the foreign item went in and out of her. Her body trembled to the point of almost losing consciousness. Enoch pleasurably enjoyed the expression she made. He relished in it.His manhood grew erect watching her feel good with the fake genitalia which had been warmed with her body temperature. He pulled it out not long after. Aran laid on her side covering her face. She was beyond embarrassed. Enoch saw the face she made.\u201cI\u2019m a bit jealous, Your Majesty. It looks like you love this toy made of ivory.\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201dAran had a vague idea, but it shocked her when she heard it from Enoch\u2019s mouth. The pleasure was over, finally, and soon came the sense of shame she felt from the pleasure of being stabbed by a toy built in the shape of a genitalia.\u201cDid it feel special? Something other than my own was inside you.\u201d\u201c\u2026..\u201d\u201cWould you like to compare it with mine and tell me what you think?\u201dEnoch turned her around and held her ankle gently.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Please wait a little longer.\u201d\u201cOn my birthday, you\u2019ll postpone it again under the pretext of my weakness,\u201d said Aran, without even looking at the emperor. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you let me learn anything?

Being loved is completely different from not being an idiot.\u201dThe emperor sighed. His daughter was just immature, not stupid.He knew what the fate of the imperial family members, who failed to ascend the throne but had outstanding talent, was, so he deliberately did not teach the princess anything.The princess, who did not know her father\u2019s inner thoughts, always wanted only things he couldn\u2019t grant her. He would have let her closet overflow if she wanted dresses, jewelry, or even a fancy villa.\u201cYour brothers don\u2019t want to study nor learn swordsmanship, so they\u2019re always playing tricks, but contrarily, you are always hurting your father\u2019s heart.\u201d\u201cJust grant my request so your heart wouldn\u2019t hurt.\u201d\u201cDo you know how difficult it is to study and to practice swordsmanship?

I also want to do my share.\u201dThe emperor stroked Aran\u2019s long hair. \u201cYou\u2019ve done enough of your share just by being born. Didn\u2019t you bring joy to your father, to your mother, and to all the nation? It\u2019s something your brothers could never do. By the way, did you hear that? These days, its trendy to hang your portraits in every house.\u201d\u201c\u2026You mean I\u2019m worthless if I can\u2019t give you joy. Then what\u2019s the difference between me and a clown?\u201dRealizing that the time had come when his sophistry will no longer persuade the princess, the emperor sighed sadly. \u201cAranhrod, I want to show you my heart if only you\u2019d be able to understand my feelings, I\u2019d be happy to show you. The reason I don\u2019t give you the right is that there are too many obligations after that which would follow you. You are too weak and soft to handle them.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dAran didn\u2019t fully understand what her father emperor said, but she could feel that he was grieving. So she held back what she wanted to say.\u201cCan\u2019t you just live happily without rights or obligations? That\u2019s all I want. If by chance heaven and earth are overturned later and you become empress, then I will admit that this father of yours was wrong.\u201dLater on, heaven and earth were overturned, and Aran became the sole empress of the empire. But her father, who would admit his mistake, had already passed away.Father.Aran shed tears even though she knew it was a dream. She finally understood what he meant. If she were to go back to that time, she wanted to remain a lovely clown who knew nothing and could do nothing she wanted.Someone gave her a tight hug as she sobbed in a quailing voice. A big hand soothed her head. Somehow she shed more tears. Aran burrowed into a wide, cozy chest. She fell asleep again, and her dreams continued.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Then what\u2019s the difference between me and a clown?\u201dRealizing that the time had come when his sophistry will no longer persuade the princess, the emperor sighed sadly. \u201cAranhrod, I want to show you my heart if only you\u2019d be able to understand my feelings, I\u2019d be happy to show you. The reason I don\u2019t give you the right is that there are too many obligations after that which would follow you. You are too weak and soft to handle them.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dAran didn\u2019t fully understand what her father emperor said, but she could feel that he was grieving. So she held back what she wanted to say.\u201cCan\u2019t you just live happily without rights or obligations? That\u2019s all I want. If by chance heaven and earth are overturned later and you become empress, then I will admit that this father of yours was wrong.\u201dLater on, heaven and earth were overturned, and Aran became the sole empress of the empire. But her father, who would admit his mistake, had already passed away.Father.Aran shed tears even though she knew it was a dream. She finally understood what he meant. If she were to go back to that time, she wanted to remain a lovely clown who knew nothing and could do nothing she wanted.Someone gave her a tight hug as she sobbed in a quailing voice. A big hand soothed her head. Somehow she shed more tears. Aran burrowed into a wide, cozy chest. She fell asleep again, and her dreams continued.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The elegance and beautiful appearance of the Grand Duke he inherited had been factors that evoked jealousy and dirty desires on others ever since he became a servant.The fellow servants vented all the resentment they had received from their masters on Enoch. Now that his status was that of a commoner, there was nothing to hold them back. Even the servants who were originally from the common people ignored him. It was very natural for him to get punched in his sleep for no reason or to have trash in his food.Enoch had enough power to stop them but never resisted. As a result, minor injuries to his body had not ceased since his demotion to a servant.Sometimes ladies and high-ranking maids tried to seduce him. Whenever he politely refused, abusive language and sharp criticism replaced their coquettish gestures. They sometimes left more scars than physical violence.Despite the insulting treatment, Enoch quickly accepted his situation and chose to survive. However, the dumb princess openly treated Enoch with special care, and for that reason, the harassment did not go away no matter how hard Enoch tried. No matter how strong his resolve was, Enoch was also a man and at a young age, so he couldn\u2019t bear but to be angry with the princess at times.\u201cDon\u2019t get things wrong.

You don\u2019t have to pretend to like me. Just let me protect you.\u201dAran looked up at Enoch with wide eyes. He never had much interest in the young princess\u2019s appearance, but her green eyes, which were close to light green, certainly added a strange air to her.\u201cHow do you intend to protect me?\u201d Enoch asked, hiding his ridicule.\u201cI won\u2019t let anyone bother you. I\u2019m going to\u2026 I\u2019ll make you happy.\u201dIt was an annoyingly naive answer.Enoch gave up his mind to be nice. She needed to face up to the reality a little. The relationship between the two had long since been in ruins, and he decided to teach this stupid woman that the princess and her servant, who was also the son of a traitor, could never be together.\u201cHappiness. Can I feel it? With the daughter of the man who killed my parents?\u201dAran\u2019s eyes grew bigger. He said it in such a cold voice that it made what he said the last time he visited sound romantic. Enoch was always friendly when he was with his fianc\u00e9, so she never imagined he would be the one to speak so acrimoniously.What made her heart ache more than that, however, was that all his words were true. Enoch smiled looking up at the hardened face of Aran.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to feel guilty. If my parents\u2019 treason was successful, the one who lost his head would have been the emperor and empress. I wouldn\u2019t be able to guarantee your life either. Of course, I wouldn\u2019t have skipped meals to save you. It wouldn\u2019t have worked in the first place.\u201d\u201c.\u201dAran couldn\u2019t speak, but her lips were quivering. Her fine eyebrows and lovely lips were distorted and she was about to shed tears.\u2018I will have nothing to say even if I was sold as a slave.\u2019Enoch, looking at her face brimming with tears, thought that he kept saying hurtful things whenever he was with the princess.It was strange. There were plenty of sc*mbags around him who were more deserving of this treatment. But he didn\u2019t know why he felt this way only for the princess. He wanted to say more hurtful and painful things to her still.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

But I have something to tell you\u2026 can you listen if you don\u2019t mind?\u201d\u201cOf course, you are my master.\u201dAran tilted her head. She seemed to be trying to gauge out whether his reply was sarcastic or not. Enoch burst into laughter. The time he spent wondering if she had had a change of heart was a waste.However, as it had been a long time since he\u2019d seen her and since she did something to be thanked for today, he decided to be kind to her.\u201cI was so rude the other day. I apologize.\u201d\u201cHuh? Oh, no. I\u2019m sorry. I wasn\u2019t thinking right.\u201d Aran glided toward Enoch. Her long hair gave off a subtle fragrance.

He licked the bowl clean, leaving nothing behind. It was a very satisfying meal.Aran was furious to learn that it was the same servant who bullied Enoch every time. But Enoch, who knew she was weak-minded, didn\u2019t expect much. It was just his feeble hope that the beating and bullying would decrease.But that night, he found Aran to be more driven than he thought.After dining with the princess, someone secretly called him back to his quarters after finishing the rest of the work. The woman with a familiar face, it was the princess\u2019 lady-in-waiting who served her the longest. She led Enoch into a wide dark room.Enoch, who was looking inside with curious eyes, soon found James and his gang. They were all bound by their hands and feet and Aran was sitting in front of them.\u201cYour Highness?\u201dAran looked up at Enoch\u2019s call. Somehow he looked somber. Enoch passed James and the other servants and approached her.\u201cI originally tried to punish them myself by just doubling what you\u2019ve been through, but on second thought, I don\u2019t know how much you\u2019ve suffered.\u201dAran glared at the servants.\u201cThey only asked for me to forgive them.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why you wanted to ask me?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dShe shook her head and gestured at the lady-in-waiting. The latter brought a long wooden box and handed it to Enoch. Inside the box was a whip, a sword, a dagger, and so on.\u201cGive it back to them yourself. I\u2019ll take responsibility for everything that happens here.\u201d When Enoch did not answer, Aran quickly added, mistaking the meaning behind his silence. \u201cIf you can\u2019t, you can ask my escort to do it instead.\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m just surprised because I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d care so much.\u201d\u201cBecause I\u2019ve been so indifferent\u2026 this won\u2019t cover all the pain you\u2019ve suffered, but I want you to feel a little better.\u201dThe majority of them were aristocrats, even though she was a member of the royal family, and even though they were servants, there was no escaping the consequences of this action. Aran decided to pay all the price for Enoch. He was willing to accept her kindness. If he were going to borrow the hand of the princess anyway, he had better make use of it completely rather than take a step back halfway.Enoch picked up the most placid looking whip of the lot. Seeing that, Aran got up from her seat.\u201cI have to go back now. I\u2019ll leave an escort here just in case.\u201dEnoch bowed his head and thanked Aran.Aran closed her eyes once in acknowledgement and soon left the room. She left because she didn\u2019t have the courage to watch violent scenes, but she also meant for him to punish them with ease. The level of punishment has not been set so she did not know whether he had remembered her promise that she would kill them if he so wanted.Enoch approached James in no hurry. The latter looked up at Enoch with a frightened face. His face was already covered with tears and snot.Enoch broke him free of his bindings and let him go.\u201cWhat\u2026 what are you..?\u201d James asked with great nervousness.\u201cBecause an opponent who can\u2019t resist is not fun,\u201d Enoch answered in a nonchalant manner.Understanding his meaning, James blinked several times, and soon laughed meanly. \u201cAre you saying that your pride is left intact? You\u2019ll soon regret your decision!\u201dEnoch beat him mercilessly as he rushed in. Soon the unilateral violence began.***After some of the servants were called by the Imperial Princess and were returned wrapped in burial shrouds, there was no one to pick a quarrel with Enoch anymore.Concerned about the heavy burden of the princess, Enoch did not take the lives of his servants or inflict fatal injuries. Not out of consideration for Aran, but because of the emperor who watched over him. The emperor knew that Aran had yet to completely shake off her old fianc\u00e9.Enoch did not forget that he was a toy the emperor gave her. Aran was still young and Enoch had not caused much trouble, so he let him be, but if he had a chance, the emperor would immediately get rid of him. Enoch didn\u2019t have any complaints, as it was enough to make an example out of them.Funnily enough, when the bullying disappeared, he fell badly ill, perhaps because he got relaxed. He thought his health was okay because he didn\u2019t care even if he got hit every day, but maybe it wasn\u2019t like that after all.Enoch laid alone in bed and looked at the dizzyingly shaky ceiling. After the incident, he started to use the room alone. It was a luxury that a low-level servant, or even a commoner, could not enjoy.He had no family or friends, so no one came and cared for him. But he wasn\u2019t hurt by that. On the contrary, he felt that it was fortunate that no one was bothering him.

He licked the bowl clean, leaving nothing behind. It was a very satisfying meal.Aran was furious to learn that it was the same servant who bullied Enoch every time. But Enoch, who knew she was weak-minded, didn\u2019t expect much. It was just his feeble hope that the beating and bullying would decrease.But that night, he found Aran to be more driven than he thought.After dining with the princess, someone secretly called him back to his quarters after finishing the rest of the work. The woman with a familiar face, it was the princess\u2019 lady-in-waiting who served her the longest. She led Enoch into a wide dark room.Enoch, who was looking inside with curious eyes, soon found James and his gang. They were all bound by their hands and feet and Aran was sitting in front of them.\u201cYour Highness?\u201dAran looked up at Enoch\u2019s call. Somehow he looked somber. Enoch passed James and the other servants and approached her.\u201cI originally tried to punish them myself by just doubling what you\u2019ve been through, but on second thought, I don\u2019t know how much you\u2019ve suffered.\u201dAran glared at the servants.\u201cThey only asked for me to forgive them.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why you wanted to ask me?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dShe shook her head and gestured at the lady-in-waiting. The latter brought a long wooden box and handed it to Enoch. Inside the box was a whip, a sword, a dagger, and so on.\u201cGive it back to them yourself. I\u2019ll take responsibility for everything that happens here.\u201d When Enoch did not answer, Aran quickly added, mistaking the meaning behind his silence. \u201cIf you can\u2019t, you can ask my escort to do it instead.\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m just surprised because I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d care so much.\u201d\u201cBecause I\u2019ve been so indifferent\u2026 this won\u2019t cover all the pain you\u2019ve suffered, but I want you to feel a little better.\u201dThe majority of them were aristocrats, even though she was a member of the royal family, and even though they were servants, there was no escaping the consequences of this action. Aran decided to pay all the price for Enoch. He was willing to accept her kindness. If he were going to borrow the hand of the princess anyway, he had better make use of it completely rather than take a step back halfway.Enoch picked up the most placid looking whip of the lot. Seeing that, Aran got up from her seat.\u201cI have to go back now. I\u2019ll leave an escort here just in case.\u201dEnoch bowed his head and thanked Aran.Aran closed her eyes once in acknowledgement and soon left the room. She left because she didn\u2019t have the courage to watch violent scenes, but she also meant for him to punish them with ease. The level of punishment has not been set so she did not know whether he had remembered her promise that she would kill them if he so wanted.Enoch approached James in no hurry. The latter looked up at Enoch with a frightened face. His face was already covered with tears and snot.Enoch broke him free of his bindings and let him go.\u201cWhat\u2026 what are you..?\u201d James asked with great nervousness.\u201cBecause an opponent who can\u2019t resist is not fun,\u201d Enoch answered in a nonchalant manner.Understanding his meaning, James blinked several times, and soon laughed meanly. \u201cAre you saying that your pride is left intact? You\u2019ll soon regret your decision!\u201dEnoch beat him mercilessly as he rushed in. Soon the unilateral violence began.***After some of the servants were called by the Imperial Princess and were returned wrapped in burial shrouds, there was no one to pick a quarrel with Enoch anymore.Concerned about the heavy burden of the princess, Enoch did not take the lives of his servants or inflict fatal injuries. Not out of consideration for Aran, but because of the emperor who watched over him. The emperor knew that Aran had yet to completely shake off her old fianc\u00e9.Enoch did not forget that he was a toy the emperor gave her. Aran was still young and Enoch had not caused much trouble, so he let him be, but if he had a chance, the emperor would immediately get rid of him. Enoch didn\u2019t have any complaints, as it was enough to make an example out of them.Funnily enough, when the bullying disappeared, he fell badly ill, perhaps because he got relaxed. He thought his health was okay because he didn\u2019t care even if he got hit every day, but maybe it wasn\u2019t like that after all.Enoch laid alone in bed and looked at the dizzyingly shaky ceiling. After the incident, he started to use the room alone. It was a luxury that a low-level servant, or even a commoner, could not enjoy.He had no family or friends, so no one came and cared for him. But he wasn\u2019t hurt by that. On the contrary, he felt that it was fortunate that no one was bothering him. He was already tired, so he laid in bed and slept all day.Enoch then opened his eyes in the middle of the night, feeling a gentle pat on his cheek.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was a wet towel.\u201cOh\u2026 oh\u2026 you woke up?\u201dHe could hear the voice of the princess. His eyes fluttered. She seemed surprised.

Well, I brought a little food because I wasn\u2019t sure if you had dinner.\u201d Aran wiggled and took out a soup full of meat, soft bread, and fruits. Contrary to her words that she had just come, the soup was cold. Aran looked embarrassed when he found her out. \u201cWhy did it cool so fast? I\u2019ll bring another one.\u201dUnder the lampshade, her face was visibly red.\u201cNo thanks. Leave it there and I\u2019ll eat it later.\u201d\u201cI brought some medicine, so take it after the meal.\u201d\u201cYour Highness.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dWhen he saw her innocent face, his heart felt a little wheezy.

He didn\u2019t know what all the princess\u2019 private tutors and maids were doing without her.\u201cThat\u2019s a secondary problem. What if I do something to you?

Why would I need to?\u201dThinking it\u2019d be faster to say it to Aran clearly once than uttering the words deftly a hundred times, Enoch gently grabbed her by the shoulders and pulled her closer. Aran allowed him to lead her without any resistance. Her face, which turned a rouge red, turned hotter as she neared his nose.\u201cYou need to watch out for men, Your Highness. There are many men in this world who are anxious to lure in the princess who\u2019s almost at a marriageable age.\u201dIncluding me.\u00a0Enoch didn\u2019t say his thoughts aloud.

It\u2019s nighttime. I need to listen to small noises far away. What if someone catches us?\u201d\u201cOh, yeah\u2026 sorry.\u201dA heavy silence fell as the princess shut her mouth.

The rope clumsily made of silk seemed dangerous to look at.\u201cAre you thinking of climbing it up?\u201d Enoch frowned.\u201cYes. Why?\u201d\u201cHa\u2026 really\u2026\u201dHe didn\u2019t have the strength to be annoyed. It was a mystery how such a child came to be born to the sly emperor and empress.Aran blinked. She didn\u2019t know what Enoch was sighing for.\u201cExcuse me, Your Highness.\u201dEnoch removed Aran\u2019s hand which held the rope rather roughly and carried her up. Surprised, Aran tried to scream when her feet suddenly lifted. Enoch quickly covered her mouth.\u201cDon\u2019t scream unless you intend to execute me.\u201dAran nodded. Enoch, who confirmed that she had calmed down, took his hand off her lips. He raised Aran higher.\u201cStretch out your arms, grab the window frame, and step on my shoulder.\u201d\u201cHuh\u2026? H\u2014how can I?\u201d\u201cJust step on me,\u201d Enoch sighed. \u201cIf you hesitate and lose your balance, we\u2019ll both get hurt.\u201d\u201cWhat? You\u2019re going to get hurt\u2026?\u201d Aran said in a tearful voice.Enoch thought that maybe he shouldn\u2019t have said what he was thinking.\u201cIt won\u2019t happen. I\u2019ll hold you tight so you won\u2019t get hurt. Step on me.\u201dAt Enoch\u2019s urging, Aran reluctantly groped the window frame and lightly put her feet on his shoulders.\u201cYou should lean your weight on me. The day\u2019s about to break.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t until he was thoroughly irritated that Aran closed her eyes tightly and gave strength to her feet. It took a while, but she was able to get up to her bedroom safely.It was fortunate that the princess was light. If she had been six pounds heavier than she was now, Enoch would have suffered multiple fractures.\u201cThank you.\u201dAran waved at him from the window.Enoch bowed mechanically and turned his back. He was completely exhausted after overdoing it in the midst of his illness.

Little Aran was able to pass through easily, but Enoch had to walk sideways like a crab to get through the narrow path.Aran shook her head as she looked at Enoch\u2019s shoulder width and compared it to the road.\u201cI\u2019m going to have to walk alone from here. And\u2026 thank you so much for walking me here,\u201d said Aran.\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I don\u2019t mind,\u201d Enoch replied.\u201cIt must be hard for you because it\u2019s so narrow. I don\u2019t mind going alone.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t make me say it twice.\u201d\u201c\u2026Okay.\u201dThe road was narrower than he thought. It was probably a passage used by maids a long time ago but now was completely abandoned and forgotten through the ages of time. The princess walked naturally along the hideous path, which was not lacking with cobwebs.\u201cYou can go back anytime if you change your mind.\u201dThrough the passage, Aran looked back and forth.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect to walk here with you,\u201d Enoch let out a sigh.\u201cIt\u2019s a secret passage that I\u2019ve known for a long time.\u201dEnoch\u2019s headache seemed to worsen when he heard her endless unilateral chatter.\u201cAnd don\u2019t talk to me. It\u2019s nighttime. I need to listen to small noises far away. What if someone catches us?\u201d\u201cOh, yeah\u2026 sorry.\u201dA heavy silence fell as the princess shut her mouth. The two said nothing until they reached Aran\u2019s bedroom.\u201cI came back safely thanks to you. I\u2019m sorry for making you walk so far when you\u2019re sick,\u201d Aran whispered.\u201cIf you already know, don\u2019t come to see me at night.\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Aran answered sullenly and caught a long stretch of rope dangling through her bedroom window. The rope clumsily made of silk seemed dangerous to look at.\u201cAre you thinking of climbing it up?\u201d Enoch frowned.\u201cYes. Why?\u201d\u201cHa\u2026 really\u2026\u201dHe didn\u2019t have the strength to be annoyed. It was a mystery how such a child came to be born to the sly emperor and empress.Aran blinked. She didn\u2019t know what Enoch was sighing for.\u201cExcuse me, Your Highness.\u201dEnoch removed Aran\u2019s hand which held the rope rather roughly and carried her up. Surprised, Aran tried to scream when her feet suddenly lifted. Enoch quickly covered her mouth.\u201cDon\u2019t scream unless you intend to execute me.\u201dAran nodded. Enoch, who confirmed that she had calmed down, took his hand off her lips. He raised Aran higher.\u201cStretch out your arms, grab the window frame, and step on my shoulder.\u201d\u201cHuh\u2026? H\u2014how can I?\u201d\u201cJust step on me,\u201d Enoch sighed. \u201cIf you hesitate and lose your balance, we\u2019ll both get hurt.\u201d\u201cWhat? You\u2019re going to get hurt\u2026?\u201d Aran said in a tearful voice.Enoch thought that maybe he shouldn\u2019t have said what he was thinking.\u201cIt won\u2019t happen. I\u2019ll hold you tight so you won\u2019t get hurt. Step on me.\u201dAt Enoch\u2019s urging, Aran reluctantly groped the window frame and lightly put her feet on his shoulders.\u201cYou should lean your weight on me. The day\u2019s about to break.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t until he was thoroughly irritated that Aran closed her eyes tightly and gave strength to her feet. It took a while, but she was able to get up to her bedroom safely.It was fortunate that the princess was light. If she had been six pounds heavier than she was now, Enoch would have suffered multiple fractures.\u201cThank you.\u201dAran waved at him from the window.Enoch bowed mechanically and turned his back. He was completely exhausted after overdoing it in the midst of his illness. It was equally irritating to go back to that narrow road, and too tiring to deal with the princess.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When she was growing up, she was uniformly immature and foolish.

He often started ridiculous quarrels with Enoch whenever Aran wasn\u2019t looking. Sometimes Claude made unreasonable demands, and when Enoch refused, he hit him in places that Aran couldn\u2019t see.His outstanding fists of a warrior dealt a considerable number of blows to the rich young master body that is Enoch. Enoch didn\u2019t think he would lose to him in skill, but he had no choice but to endure now because no matter what, his opponent was an aristocrat.In front of Aran, Claude pretended to be a kind angel. His friendly smile which he only flashed when he chatted with the princess was abominable. And the worst thing was the look he gave Aran. Unlike Aran, who treated him as a pure friend, Claude looked at her like a rutting b*stard.His eyes got more irritating as the days went by and Enoch wanted to poke the b*stard\u2019s two eyes if he could.Aran, unaware of the circ*mstances, tilted her head. \u201cYou look like you\u2019re in a bad mood.

The accident left the empress dead on the spot, and the emperor had a severe head injury and did not recognize the face of his beloved daughter. Prince Luazan, the great brother of Aran, became the acting emperor to fill the void.Before the accident, the emperor handed Aran dozens of large gold mines over at the Setia province, the country\u2019s largest reserve.Greedy Luazan and Second Prince Dylan coveted their sister\u2019s wealth. Up until recently, the emperor was holding out, so they didn\u2019t dare to intercept it, but now there was nothing for them to be bothered about. The two princes, who were usually at odds with each other, were willing to join forces to achieve their ends.It was not that the emperor did not recognize the greed of his sons. The emperor, who expected that they would leave their sister needing after his death, intended to keep Aran safe through her marriage to the heir to the Grand Duke of Roark, but his plan was thwarted by the rebellion of the Grand Duchy. Having been unaware of his upcoming betrayal, the emperor could not come up with any other contingency plan.Aran placed a bouquet of white flowers on the empress\u2019 coffin. The emperor was unable to attend the funeral, so the princes and the princess organized the funeral.Aran barely came to her senses the night before and managed to attend the funeral, but she shed so much tears that she almost collapsed again. Luazan helped the wavering Aran.\u201cHow could mother close her eyes in peace seeing your current state, Aranrhod?\u201d\u201cOlder brother\u2026\u201d Aran looked up at Luazan, a little surprised.She wasn\u2019t very friendly with her two older brothers. The princes, who had been severely educated as members of the royal family since childhood, were not keen on Aran, who had made no effort and still monopolized their parents\u2019 love, and Aran also had difficulties communicating with her older brothers with whom she had a wide age gap.\u201cWe\u2019ve been too indifferent to you. But in times of need, blood draws on blood. From now on, Dylan and I will protect you.\u201dLuazan spoke in a fleshy tone. Dylan wiped away her tears. The sorrow still lingered, but the kindness of her remaining blood-relatives was a deep consolation to Aran. As a young and naive girl, she had no talent to know the blackness of her older brothers\u2019 hearts.The two brothers pretended to take care of Aran for a while and before she knew it, she became completely dependent on the princes.After the empress\u2019 funeral, Aran\u2019s daily routine became very simple. As soon as she opened her eyes in the morning, she visited the emperor, paid her respects, and nursed him until sunset. The emperor not only became an idiot, but he hardly moved. However, Aran spared no effort, believing that he would soon get well.And when the emperor fell asleep, she went to see Enoch.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The accident left the empress dead on the spot, and the emperor had a severe head injury and did not recognize the face of his beloved daughter. Prince Luazan, the great brother of Aran, became the acting emperor to fill the void.Before the accident, the emperor handed Aran dozens of large gold mines over at the Setia province, the country\u2019s largest reserve.Greedy Luazan and Second Prince Dylan coveted their sister\u2019s wealth. Up until recently, the emperor was holding out, so they didn\u2019t dare to intercept it, but now there was nothing for them to be bothered about. The two princes, who were usually at odds with each other, were willing to join forces to achieve their ends.It was not that the emperor did not recognize the greed of his sons. The emperor, who expected that they would leave their sister needing after his death, intended to keep Aran safe through her marriage to the heir to the Grand Duke of Roark, but his plan was thwarted by the rebellion of the Grand Duchy. Having been unaware of his upcoming betrayal, the emperor could not come up with any other contingency plan.Aran placed a bouquet of white flowers on the empress\u2019 coffin. The emperor was unable to attend the funeral, so the princes and the princess organized the funeral.Aran barely came to her senses the night before and managed to attend the funeral, but she shed so much tears that she almost collapsed again. Luazan helped the wavering Aran.\u201cHow could mother close her eyes in peace seeing your current state, Aranrhod?\u201d\u201cOlder brother\u2026\u201d Aran looked up at Luazan, a little surprised.She wasn\u2019t very friendly with her two older brothers. The princes, who had been severely educated as members of the royal family since childhood, were not keen on Aran, who had made no effort and still monopolized their parents\u2019 love, and Aran also had difficulties communicating with her older brothers with whom she had a wide age gap.\u201cWe\u2019ve been too indifferent to you. But in times of need, blood draws on blood. From now on, Dylan and I will protect you.\u201dLuazan spoke in a fleshy tone. Dylan wiped away her tears. The sorrow still lingered, but the kindness of her remaining blood-relatives was a deep consolation to Aran. As a young and naive girl, she had no talent to know the blackness of her older brothers\u2019 hearts.The two brothers pretended to take care of Aran for a while and before she knew it, she became completely dependent on the princes.After the empress\u2019 funeral, Aran\u2019s daily routine became very simple. As soon as she opened her eyes in the morning, she visited the emperor, paid her respects, and nursed him until sunset. The emperor not only became an idiot, but he hardly moved. However, Aran spared no effort, believing that he would soon get well.And when the emperor fell asleep, she went to see Enoch.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNovel InfoNovel Info",
