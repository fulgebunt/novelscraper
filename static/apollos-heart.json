In particular, due to the low-fat levels in aging bodies, the movement of knives had to be more attentive and precise.The blade must glide between the red flesh and the white layer of fat at a rapid rate.Although the temperature in the workplace was intentionally set low just enough to prevent decay, drops of sweat still formed on the forehead of the man who looked intent in his work. By the time he finished, he cast a glance at the nearby window and in time, saw the break of dawn.Alas, he lost track of time, being so absorbed in what he was doing.The light creeping from outside soon enveloped his large silhouette moving around the room. His torso glistening with sweat, trailing from the deep ridges of his sculpted chest to his narrow waist.He lit his cigarette as he sat down on the stairs and took a sip of the acrid smoke\u2014one of his sources of comfort at this particular time. It filled his guts, ebbing the obnoxious smell of flesh.He sighed. The number of cigarettes he consumed had significantly increased lately. The ashtrays filled in less than a few hours in his office was the glaring proof.Once a year, this happens to him\u2026 Like a fever that hits him in a schedule. He crumbles in heaps\u2014a disastrous feeling then rages inside him.Here we go again.His heart pounded. As if with life of its own, his hands started fishing for his cellphone in his pocket. Opening a folder from his gallery, his mouth was pressed into a thin line, especially when the screen revealed a picture of a woman sleeping peacefully.The man looking down at the image froze. Like a sculpture, he stared at his phone unblinkingly. What on earth was he thinking? The memory of the time he took this picture rushed into him nostalgically. As soon as he woke up from a deep slumber, he carefully took a picture of the woman dozing next to him.Nevertheless, the woman in the picture was a person whose heart was beating and whose blood was rushing hot. However, things had long changed\u2026She\u2019s no longer in this world.***Dozens of journalists and celebrities from all walks of life flocked to the West In Hotel ballroom, where an engagement reception was in full swing.\u201cAre all the reporters gone?\u201dAmidst the turmoil of the party, the baritone voice of a man demanded a quick answer. His long fingers enclosed around a glass of champagne looked rough and callous, resulting from yesterday\u2019s work. Standing tall at a height of 180 centimeters, his sleek and sensual figure towered amongst almost everyone in the room.There was no denying that among the glamorous guests, he stood out. What\u2019s more, tonight, he was the highlight of the engagement ceremony. Seo Tae-Jun, the Chief Executive Officer of West In Group of Companies joined this event.When asked by his boss, Chief Of Staff Yi Jung-Su quickly confirmed the departure of the reporters by looking at a long list. \u201cYes, a little while ago. The K reporters were the last to leave.\u201dThe fact that there were dozens of journalists who attended the engagement ceremony only showed how massive the event was.The engagement between the West In Group, which owns pharmaceuticals, distribution, and hotels based on military classes, and Daejin Group, which has taken over the distribution market for generations was surely a scope everyone was eager to hear.With the exit of the nagging reporters, the mood of the party began to lighten up. Formalities from the members of each family reverberated as they began to strike conversations that would last until midnight. Even so, Tae-Jun was not entertained one bit.He was lost in his own thoughts when suddenly, a slap to his shoulder jolted him to consciousness.\u201cWhy the straight face? You are the man of this evening!\u201dTae-Jun\u2019s cousin, Lee Jae-won, was the one who spoke in a cheery manner, flipping his thick brown hair to the back of his head\u2014his known mannerism.As the planning director of the Seoin Hotel, he was also the general manager of today\u2019s party. But having noticed Tae-Jun sulked in one corner in company with his wine and barely socialized, he couldn\u2019t help but approach him. Since he entered the hall, Tae Jun\u2019s face looked already grim, quite contrary to what he had expected.Lee Jae-won looked around and whispered into his ears, \u201cSomeone might think that Yoon forcefully brought you in this position\u2026 What\u2019s the matter?\u201dAnother main character of the day was Tae-Jun\u2019s fiance, Yoon Si-Yeon. Jae-won and her were close friends who spent time together in elementary, middle, high and high schools.For Lee Jae-won, it was a surprise that Si Yeon would become a part of the family, not to mention, she would be Tae-Jun\u2019s future wife! But he had no power to argue with his grandfather\u2019s decision.Despite Lee\u2019s persuasions, Tae-Jun answered indifferently, \u201cI went to the villa last night and came back in the morning.\u201d\u201cWhy in the villa?\u201d\u201cI got a word that Sebastian died,\u201d He answered.With the mention of the familiar name, Lee Jae-won\u2019s forehead creased. \u201cAh!\u201d He exclaimed upon remembering Tae-Jun\u2019s favorite English pointer.\u201cThe hound in the villa? I didn\u2019t think he was still alive. He was too old.\u201dTae-Jun replied flatly, \u201cThirteen.\u201dIf Lee remembered correctly, Sebastian was a hound given by his grandfather, Chairman Seo Jung-ho, to Tae-Jun on his 22nd birthday. The dog was a loyal helper who spent more than a decade with them.\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you stayed up all night for a dead dog the day before this event? Since when have you been so sentimental\u2026\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cYou can\u2019t skin it if it\u2019s already decayed.\u201dWait a minute, skin it? For a moment, Lee Jae-won almost dropped the champagne glass he was holding.\u201cDon\u2019t tell me that you \u2018stuffed\u2019 the hound?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dHis pupils narrowed and seemed to flee from the expanding whites of his eyes, \u201cAre you out of your mind?\u201dNovel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",

It\u2019s not like this was our first time stuffing animals.\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s not that, but\u2026\u201d Of course, it\u2019s not the first time. It was their grandfather who taught them to hunt and stuff animals since they were teenagers. In particular, Tae-Jun, who showed the greatest talent, started making stuffed animals when he was 15 years old.But isn\u2019t that limited to the \u201cloot\u201d hunted?Looking around the hall with disdain, Tae-Jun told Lee. \u201cI\u2019ll be out for a minute. Call me when the atmosphere is a little more to my liking.\u201d\u201cYou mean empty and silent?\u201d Lee said playfully, but when Tae-Jun\u2019s face remained stoic, he added, \u201d But we are having a party right now!\u201dTae-Jun shrugged his shoulders before saying, \u201cIt seems like someone would still enjoy this party without me.\u201d He pointed to someone and Lee Jae-won craned his neck to see who it was. A couple of meters from them, Si-yeon was enjoying champagne in the centre of the hall with her chin up. Wearing Oscar de la Renta\u2019s dress, she flashed the brightest smile and enjoyed the attention she was receiving.When Jae-won whipped his head back to address the man he was talking to, Tae-Jun\u2019s broad, retreating back was already facing him. Left alone so suddenly, he could only massage his temple in annoyance.\u201cWhat just happened?\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cMr. Lee, what\u2019s going on with the chief executive?\u201d Jeong Jin-Wook was suddenly in front of him.\u201cNothing. Don\u2019t mind him. At this time of the year, he always gets moody.\u201dThis was an annual event that has been repeated every year but Tae-Jun seemed to have despised this event. Lee remembered that time when his change became drastic. Four years ago, his cousin became very sick, which was quite bizarre since Tae-Jun had always been healthy as a horse. In fact, since they were kids, he was the one who rarely had colds and fever.Noticing the sorrow that had filled his grandson, President Seo placed someone next to Tae-Jun to investigate like a shadow. And it was not long before the truth came to light\u2014Tae-Jun had a woman who died in an accident.All the family members were anxious that he would follow the precedent of his father, Seo Jeong-hoon, who went crazy over women and abandoned his family and even died.Fortunately, Tae-Jun returned to his usual self, as if nothing had happened. But once in a year, he would be sick and distant like this. Like what his father did, he isolated himself and avoided everyone\u2026 he was mourning. The wound caused by the woman\u2019s loss had never healed.Jae-Won asked Ji-Wook while he was at it. \u201cYou said you didn\u2019t know the\u201cI\u2019ve told you before. I don\u2019t know anything about it. He\u2019s such a private person, keeps things to himself.\u201dIn particular, Chung\u2019s secretary, Jeong Jin-Wook, has been by Tae-jun for almost 20 years. Though they belong in the same company, there was an implicit rule to never mix business with personal affairs. Hence, employees never intrude on each other\u2019s territory.He kept his mouth shut as much as he could about the woman.What kind of woman was she?To Jae-won, Tae-Jun was an object of awe even if he had grown beside him.Tae-Jun was Chairman Seo Jung-Ho\u2019s only \u201cSeo\u201d grandson. Since childhood, he has never been swayed or revealed his feelings, thanks to his strict upbringing and the pressure that left weight on his young shoulders.With this, sometimes Lee wondered if Tae-Jun had a heart at all. If so, is the blood flowing properly? And, is it red?It was only natural for him to be curious about the woman who captivated such a man. Jae-won\u2019s face looked torn as he watched Si-Yeon quietly. Poor Si-Yeon\u2026After leaving the banquet hall, Tae-Jun received a call from one of his co-workers.\u201cThere is no need to negotiate further with them. Yes, I\u2019ll come forward if it gets more complicated. That\u2019s how we must deal with it.\u201d He said with a slight sneer.It was not an easy problem as three competitors were after the pharmaceutical company\u2019s purchase of new sites. The end of the call made him crave cigarettes; so he fetched a stick from the cigar case he kept inside the breast pockets of his tux.As he tried to light a cigarette in his mouth, he soon remembered the hotel\u2019s prohibiting rules about indoor smoking, and his hand ceased with its actions.I\u2019m getting sick.Throughout the evening, Tae-Jun was forced to stand up and do little chats. Now, he felt suffocated, his chest seemed to be clogged.I need to get some fresh air and clear my head.Even though it was quite late, the lobby was still crowded with guests, attendants and reporters invited.He got off the elevator with a look of indifference and set foot in the lobby. At that moment, a woman brushed past him, talking on her cell phone.Tae-Jun\u2019s eyes widened when he caught a glimpse of the passing woman\u2019s side profile. Her voice chimed in his ears\u2026His gaze was glued on her back. Terrible disbelief hitting him at once.Jin Hye-Yeon?Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euA tall woman, with long hair tied in a single braid which runs down her skinny back, bore an expressionless face while crossing her way to the exit of the hotel.It\u2019s her. No, it can\u2019t be.However, before he could even realize it, the name of the woman he lost years ago slipped out of his lips.\u201cJin Hye-Yeon\u2026\u201d He never thought he would hear himself speak this particular name again.The doubtful tone soon changed to a desperate shout, \u201cJin Hye-Yeon!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

In desperation, Tae-jun started running without even realizing it. All eyes were on him as he bumped into people. But he couldn\u2019t care more, catching up to the woman before him was the only thing that mattered.However, as soon as the woman stepped out of the hotel lobby, she quickly boarded a waiting taxi and immediately drove out of sight\u2026 far from Tae-jun\u2019s reach.Was it an Illusion? Or a ghost?She had remained a vivid figure in his mind\u2026Too vivid to be a mere imagination. He could not be mistaken. She was the person that he pictured in his head thousands of times. More than anything, she was the very reason for his life\u2019s eclipse\u2026Tae-jun clenched his teeth and placed his hand on his chest. This painfully beating heart was proof of what he had seen. He felt his mouth dry up and even so, his brain. After four years\u2026 The woman whom he thought was dead and had mourned over, just appeared before his very eyes.<b>\u2746\u2746\u2746</b>\u201cAre you out of your mind? You left the party all of a sudden only to come back to ask for the guest list?\u201dA mithering Jae-won opened his office door, his steps heavy and brows furrowed. Upon walking in, he pressed the power button of his computer and crossed his arms in displeasure. Jae-won was on the edge.Tae-jun, annoyed by his endless complaints, tapped the plaque on his table bearing the words \u2018Lee Jae-won, Planning Director, Seoin Hotel\u2019 with his long fingers. The tapping sound seemed like a death wish to Jae-won\u2019s ears.\u201cDo you want to lose your title?\u201dSh*t.Jae-won cursed in his mind.Jae-won sighed and recalled what had happened a while ago.It was only ten minutes ago that Tae-jun, who said he would step out from the event hall for a moment, came back inside with a ghostly, pale face. And it was probably seven or eight minutes ago when he looked around the hall and like a mad man, snatched Jae-won by the collar without a moment\u2019s hesitation. Hauling him into the elevator forcefully was perhaps 5 minutes ago.Along the way, not a soul dared to talk to them and somehow stop Tae-jun\u2019s barbaric actions. Not even his manager, Mr. Lee, who had been with him for seven years or so.His fianc\u00e9e, Si-yeon, could only manage to open her eyes wide and mouth: \u201cJae-won, what\u2019s going on?\u201dWow, what a surprise-filled engagement party.Once the computer booted, Jae-won keyed in the security code and opened the guest list. This process, at best, took only five minutes or less. Nevertheless, he felt that Tae-jun\u2019s patience was running out in real-time, so his hair stood on end.\u201cWhat the hell are you looking for? Is a notorious terrorist on the guest list? Like IS?\u201dHotel Seoin was a go-to place for domestic and international VIPs, celebrities, and millionaires. So, the reservation system was under constant scrutiny spanning over several stages. Of course, terrorists couldn\u2019t stay, but who knows if one snuck in?!Instead of a proper reply, Tae-jun simply uttered a name, there was no telling whether it was a joke or not.\u201cHye-yeon Jin\u201dClearly, it was a girl\u2019s name. Jae-won asked back in a puzzled voice. \u201cHye-yeon Jin?\u201d\u201cFind her on the list.\u201dAt that moment Jae-won\u2019s lips pursed.Nonetheless, Jae-won\u2019s fingers flew over the keyboard trying to press his anxiety. A \u2018Not found\u2019 message appeared on the screen.\u201cShe is not on the list.\u201d\u201cHow about the foreigners\u2019 list?\u201dTae-jun closed his eyes and touched his furrowed brows.\u201cThere is none. Who is she?\u201dTo Tae-jun, the Jae-won\u2019s voice coming from just next to him sounded distant. He was immersed in recalling the details of Hye-yeon and the phone conversation.What was she wearing?Two words came into his mind. Additionally, she was talking in quite a friendly voice.\u201cIs there any foreigner who made a reservation then cancelled it?\u201d Jae-won quickly searched on the list.\u201cWe have two.\u201d\u201cName?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cCHRISTOPHER SHAWN, LOUIS ERNEST. I do not see them as girls\u2019 names?\u201dTea-jun\u2019s gaze went dark by Jae-won\u2019s next words. \u201cCould be her husband or boyfriend.\u201dIf she had got out of the situation \u2018in that way\u2019 four years ago, she would be twenty-nine years old now. That seems old enough for her to have a husband or a boyfriend.Tae-jun pushed Jae-won aside, sat down and skimmed through the details of each and every guest. This information was confidential. Still, unable to get the information that he wanted, he gave Jae-won another order.\u201cCall the security department and tell them to bring the original CCTV footage of the lobby over here.\u201d T/N: Liking the story so far?

What if we get into trouble\u2026\u201dHowever, Tae-jun just shrugged off the latter\u2019s concern, \u201cIf something happens, refer it to the board of directors.\u201dRefer it to the board of directors? How\u2019d anyone dare to do that to Tae-jun Seo?Jae-won contacted the security department immediately, holding back the desire to pull his hair out.Jae-won\u2019s request also flustered the security officer but soon tucked his tail as more quickly once he heard the name, Tae-jun Seo. While waiting for the security officer with the original footage, Jae-won checked Tae-jun\u2019s mood\u201cSo\u2026 who is this \u2018Hye-yeon Jin\u2019 you\u2019re looking for?\u201dInstead of answering, Tae-jun pulled out a cigarette from his cigarette case and held it between his lips. Jae-won had to stop himself saying, \u2018No smoking inside\u201d as he watched the unruly man\u2019s cigarette catch fire. However, no matter how hard he tried, he was not able to stop his curiosity.\u201cIs that the woman who died four years ago?\u201dTae-jun stared at Jae-won fiercely. Jae-won flinched as if his insides were being twisted.\u201c\u2026 how do you know about her?\u201d\u201cGrandfather investigated on his own.\u201d\u201cThe chairman has figured it out?\u201d\u201cYes. He also asked questions about her to me and your manager Mr. Lee.\u201d Jae-won obediently and truthfully apprised him.Tae-jun\u2019s mouth holding a cigarette twitched.\u201cYes, she is the woman,\u201d Tae-jun answered, puffing out cigarette smoke, realizing that there was nothing more to hide.\u201cOh my God!\u201d Jae-won raised his voice as if it sounded nonsensical.\u201cAre you doing this because of a dead woman? You mean that the dead woman turned into a ghost and came to your engagement party? What desperate love!\u201d\u201cShe is neither a ghost nor desperate,\u201d Tae-jun said as if blurting out. He looked at Jae-won with a fierce gaze; one laced with violence.He then dropped his cigarette on the floor and stubbed it out with his foot. \u201cI was a \u2018curse\u2019 to her.\u201dYes, he was. To her, their one year together was nothing but a curse, a shackle.One year. They were given one year. It was the same time when Jin Myung-Je, the CEO of Jinseong Construction offered his daughter and along with Hotel Jinseong.\u2746\u2746\u2746\u201cYou\u2019ve read the death report her brother, Hye-Seong Jin, showed you. You\u2019ve even seen the scene of the accident. Hye-yeon Jin is dead, boss.\u201dTae-jun\u2019s secretary, Mr. Jeong Jin-Wook, was having a good time with his family. It had been a long time since he had one, so when he got a sudden call from his boss, he turned solemn. His wife, who was bringing him a fruit plate, sensed his stiff face. She quietly just closed the door and left the room. A faint sound of the kid\u2019s favorite weekend tv show was coming from the living room. When Jin-Wook checked the clock, it was supposed to be the time for the engagement party.But the woman who died four years ago showed up? Jin-Wook furrowed his brows and felt like his mouth was drying up.\u2013 I am aware of it.Tea-jun\u2019s voice coming from the phone was heavily low. This, as far as Jin-Wook knew, was not a good sign. It had already been twenty years since he watched Tae-jun by his side. Perhaps he could boast that he knew this man better than his family. However, Tae-jun\u2019s obsession with Hye-yeon was hard to understand even for Jin-Wook. It was the same in the past when she was alive and still the same now since she died.Five years ago, Tae-jun met her for the first time in Jin-Seong city where his father Jeong-Hun Seo spent his later years. Jin Hye-yeon was the daughter of Jin Myung-Je, president of Jinseong Hotel, and a college student taking a leave of absence at that time. It\u2019s not clear what features of her attracted him so much, but anyway, Tae-jun wanted her. Soon, he managed to get her with a condition called \u2018One-year contract.\u2019But Hye-yeon found the relationship with Tae-jun hard enough to vanish herself before the end of the contract and end her life in a way that disgusted him the most.She threw herself into the flowing Jinseong River surrounding the city. The cause of death was drowning. And it was obviously a suicide.\u201cBut it is a truth that she appeared before me.\u201dTae-jun bit his lip slightly and looked down at his hand. The woman was right in front of him, a completely living human being.\u201cIs there any chance that the autopsy report is wrong?\u201d\u2013 I am not sure if the drowned body was not found, but the family found the body and cremated it. There\u2019s not much chance.\u201dAt that instant, the words that suddenly popped into his mind disturbed him deeply.There\u2019s something you\u2019ve misunderstood\u2026 A mistakeThat was what Hye-yeon said when she came out to reject his offer.Tae-jun murmured what she said unwittingly. \u201cMistake.\u201d-A mistake?\u201cI do not know yet. I have to figure out what it is from now on. 30 Ga 12**, is the plate number of the taxi she took. Start looking for her from there.\u201dYes, boss.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euTae-jun hung up and revived the meaning of the word.\u2018Mistake\u2019 that Hye-yeon mentioned.At that time, I should have listened to her first and called President Jin.

    "Chapter 5": "Chapter 5 - Start of an Unseemly ContractPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 5 \u2013 Start of an Unseemly ContractThe face of the woman, who was here to say no, was livid. If looks could kill, then the seething hatred in her eyes would\u2019ve turned him into ashes already. She seemed to know no fear; there was no admiration that women normally had when looking at him. All there was, was pure, unveiled disdain.Tae-Jun carefully studied the woman sitting opposite him. It was unexpected to see her upset, but it wasn\u2019t as bad as he thought. She had delicate features. Her white face was unusually flushed, and her hands on the table were slightly shaking.He observed the woman\u2019s hand interestedly. Unlike the smooth hands of the women around him, hers seemed rough albeit with neatly clipped nails.Is she into hard labor?Nonetheless, he couldn\u2019t stop thinking of licking the back of her hand where blue veins could be slightly noticed. As opposed to her trembling hands, Hye-Yeon\u2019s voice sounded quite firm. Neither did she waver, nor did she break their eye contact.\u201cYou didn\u2019t think I\u2019d accept it, did you?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s different from what your father told me, Miss Hye-Yeon Jin.\u201d\u201cMy dad\u2026\u201dWith interest, Tae-Jun looked at her red fluttering lips that seemed to indicate she was thinking of something to say. The thought of those lips being all his sooner or later thrilled him.\u201cThere\u2019s something you\u2019ve misunderstood\u2026 A mistake,\u201d Hye-Yeon said urgently.He laughed at her clumsy and urgent\u00a0tone.\u201cSomething I\u2019ve misunderstood? Let\u2019s hear from your father first what I\u2019ve mistaken. \u00a0He asked me to call him if you\u2019d come to say something different to what I have settled with him.\u201dHe immediately dialed her father\u2019s private phone, and Hye-Yeon seemed to tense up\u2026\u201cMr. Jin, as you said, your daughter is telling me a different story. What must I do?\u201dIn only a brief moment, he pushed his cell phone toward Hye-Yeon without saying anything, her white hands trembled even more than before.Intrigued, he watched what words would be exchanged between the two. However, from the moment she picked up the phone, Hye-Yeon didn\u2019t say a word. Perhaps Mr.Jin told her just to stay quiet and listen, for her fair face turned paler and paler, and in the end, she closed her eyes tightly.Hye-Yeon slowly put his cell phone down on the table. Tae-Jun knew by intuition\u2013there was no hope for her.It was the very next day that Hye-Yeon, who\u2019d returned home wordlessly after receiving her father\u2019s call, contacted Tae-Jun. He invited her to the hotel room to meet him.Arriving first, he whiled away, sipping wine and playing with a cigarette in his mouth. Not long after, he opened the door at the doorbell, and Hye-Yeon slipped in quietly.Passing by her, who was standing in a daze, Tae-Jun sat on the sofa, stubbing his cigarette on the ashtray.\u201cHave a seat,\u201d he said.She came over to the side hesitantly. Looking at her slender legs stretched under her dress got him excited a little bit.Tae-Jun took out the prepared contract. Hye-Yeon, who read the contract through with a stiff face, opened her mouth slowly.\u201cThe contract is for one year.\u201dTae-Jun made a slight impression. It was enough time to get bored with a woman but was too short for the money he paid.\u201cIsn\u2019t that too short for the money I would pay to buy Jinseong hotel?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know about that. One year is the maximum that I can give.\u201dShe was calm but firm. Tae-Jun stared at Hye-Yeon\u2019s face trying to read her mind. To his surprise, she didn\u2019t avoid his eyes and continued talking.\u201cTake it or leave it.\u201dShe meant it. She was not playing mind-games in order to increase her worth. Nor were her words lacking conviction. Tae-Jun was not happy with her half-standing position, which implied she was ready to leave. He hated that he was losing control over her already. He bit the cigarette and lit it up then asked her a question as if he was exhaling the smoke.\u201cWhy just a year?\u201d\u201cI should finish my degree.\u201d\u201cDid you say you majored in Western painting? If so, getting my support would be an advantage for you. An exhibition or a gallery, whichever you want to open.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want you to take control of my future with this relationship.\u201dHe thought she was bold. Tae-Jun smoked his cigarette to its end and then opened his mouth.\u201cAll right. I accept your offer, but you have to move in here.\u201dHe didn\u2019t even know why he\u2019d set such a condition on it. He just wanted to keep her by his side. She had to be there whenever he wanted. He didn\u2019t want her to be involved with other men. He had claimed her.\u201cYou are saying\u2026 moving in with you?\u201d she asked him back with her eyes wide open. And her, with those eyes, got him curious out of the blue. It was quite tempting to imagine what she would be like in bed.\u201cI also don\u2019t want to lose out or waste my time. No refusal when I want to, if you accept this condition, I\u2019ll take yours, too.\u201dHye-Yeon was silent for a long time. Tired of waiting for her answer, Tae-Jun took out another cigarette. Just before he lit it up, she spoke below her breath.\u201cOkay, I will.\u201dTae-Jun tapped the table and put down the lighter.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThe house will be prepared. Make sure you have nothing to make trouble and move in one week later. Our contract will begin on that day. And when I said making trouble, it includes guys around you. So don\u2019t forget to cut them off before you arrive.\u201dHye-Yeon had lost all her pallor. All she could do was nod. Tae-Jun relaxed and shifted into a more comfortable position on the sofa.\u201cIs there anything else you want? Jewels, designer bags, or cars, \u00a0just tell me\u2026 whatever it is you want.\u201dWeren\u2019t those what girls usually wanted? Well, he was going to be generous; all he wanted was to close the deal.\u201cI don\u2019t like the smell of cigarettes.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Tae-jun thought, once again, she was bold. He smirked and broke the cigarette that he was holding between his lips without lighting up then threw it along with the others into the ashtray.\u201cThat\u2019s a difficult condition. But, okay, I will try.\u201dTae-jun stretched out his hand. Surprised by the hand that suddenly approached her face, Hye-yeon curled up but gave up as soon as she realized her position. She closed her eyes while his hand stroked her face. His delicate fingers trailed down from her forehead to her nose, then down her lips.Gently, his fingers drew circles along her lips. His mellow voice drifted to her ear.\u201cHere\u2019s the deposit. Take a shower and get ready.\u201dAs Hye-yeon entered the bathroom, Tae-jun undid his tie and the cuffs. He went on to unbutton his shirt, loosen the collar, and poured himself another glass of wine. She was taking longer than he\u2019d expected. But he was determined to be patient.By the time Hye-yeon got out of the bathroom, he\u2019d half-emptied his third glass of wine. By how she was clutching her robe, which would be taken off anyway, he could tell that she was nervous.Maybe it was because he was starting to feel tipsy. He felt rushed by the fresh scent effusing from her. All he could think of was hurrying to taste her.In his haste, he hurriedly tried to take her dress off. His rough gesture sent a shiver down her spine. She looked at him, scared.\u201cI am a v*rgin.\u201dHer unexpected confession stopped his hands, trying to pull down the dress. He thought she had a boyfriend. He grinned.\u201cIt\u2019s my first time sleeping with a v*rgin.\u201dHe lifted her chin and made her meet his eyes. Her eyes were still full of anxiety. Tae-jun held out a glass of wine.\u201cDo you want some wine? It can help you relax,\u201d he said.\u201cI don\u2019t feel like getting drunk now.\u201dHonestly, he was afraid she\u2019d bite her tongue right away, but she stood buff. Tae-jun pulled her chin to put his lips to hers. Her lips were sweet. Her soft tongue and saliva were as sweet as her lips. Having tasted her for so long that his tongue was tingling, Tae-jun moved his lips to her ears with a satisfied look.\u201cLet me treat you well.\u201dHis nimble hand moved along her body and dropped her dress on the floor. In turn, he also stripped off her underwear. Her naked body was breathtakingly beautiful.He had imagined her naked body several times. He knew it would be his type, but he liked it much more in reality. He liked her white skin, long arms and legs and not big but perfect sized mounds as well.Her body trembled greatly as he grabbed her b*som and put her pink bud in his mouth. She was sensitive.With Tae-jun\u2019s skillful caresses, Hye-yeon bit her lips, her eyes tightly shut. He wanted to see her other facial expressions, and just couldn\u2019t take his eyes off of her\u2026 The expressions she gave upon discovering new sensations fascinated him.In addition, her body was so addictively tasty that it was not a waste to go slow with her. Her whole body was soft, sweet, and moist. The more he tasted it, the more he was thirsty to indulge it.It was not long until Hye-yeon felt the foot of a bed behind her, and Tae-jun gently laid her down atop it. As the large man joined her, the soft mattress sunk under his weight. She was underneath him.His lips, which wandered around her body to quench his thirst, headed to her lady garden. Hye-yeon, who was holding back the sound so much that her knuckles turned white in gripping the sheets so tightly, shouted embarrassedly.\u201cWhat are you doing..!\u201dThe frightened woman struggled, but he held her spread legs firmly. He opened up her already wet l*bia and excited the small bud at the center with his tongue. She shivered. He placed his head to her lady parts and kept exploring her folds. She, who had been suppressing her moans, jerked out her words with a sobbing sound.\u201cNo, please. Just do it without this part.\u201dHis member was pretty huge and long. As for a woman who has had a lot of experience could take it, but Hye-yeon would barely be able to endure.\u201cStay still. You will thank me later.\u201dHe continued licking her cl*t with the tip of his tongue and put his finger inside of her. Her vu*va, which was too tight to have no more than one finger a moment ago, had become much softer. Opening up a narrow, stiff spot, he added another finger. As his fingers continued to penetrate her, his mouth didn\u2019t stop sucking her hardened bud.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euFinally, Hye-yeon twisted herself and moaned. \u201cAh, aah!\u201dHye-yeon quivered slightly. The groan that escaped her mouth for the first time turned him on extremely. Only after seeing that her whole body was soaked with his saliva, did Tae-jun raise his head with great satisfaction. Hye-yeon\u2019s eyes were blurry and in tears.He touched the entrance between her legs with his finger. Her wet folds were still quivering as if it was ready to suck his fingers inside.\u201cThis will do.\u201dHe took off his pants and brought out the c*ndom he had prepared.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She realized that the real thing was about to start. She didn\u2019t know what to expect, and her heart was in her mouth.She was brusquely brought out of her inattention when she felt him grab her waist and pull her lady garden closer to his member. Sensing a completely different feeling of his thing than ever, she looked up at him with astonishment. Without warning, Tae-jun slowly slid his length into her.Her eyes opened wide, she gasped, feeling as if the air was stuck in her throat. She tried to get away from him.\u201cAh, please, it hurts!\u201d\u201cFirst time always does. You\u2019ll feel good soon when you get used to it.\u201d His voice was brimming with lust.Tae-jun went all the way into her in one, slow push, pressing her down so she wouldn\u2019t escape. Hye-yeon whimpered and tightened her grip on the sheets. Her body shivered, finding it still difficult to accommodate him, even though he\u2019d stimulated her before penetrating her.Her quivering, too hot and tight va**na that had accepted a man\u2019s meat for the very first time sent him in delirium. This was a sensation that no woman had ever given him. The initial distaste of indulging a vestal was replaced with an insatiable desire and never like before pleasure.Left to him, he wanted to pin her down and penetrate her as much as he could. And yet, he didn\u2019t. He had Hye-yeon for himself; there was no rush. Today was not the last chance to gratify his desire. There would be many more coming.She was his for a year. What he was doing to her was a ritualistic act of imprinting himself on her. He would relish every bit of it.He lowered his head to kiss her forehead and cheek. He had never put so much effort into caress before. Feeling her breath slowly stabilize, he moved.\u201cAh, mmh.\u201d Hye-yeon groaned.He could no longer wait. When he saw the tears stream down her eyes, he was aroused like never before. She was a woman whose tears were seductive, and he was a man enthralled.He licked her tears and pushed his meat to its hilt. He slid in and out of her beautiful pink, wet, lady parts repeatedly. As he stamped her body with his lips and tongue, he could feel her shudder aimlessly.\u201cDon\u2019t you dare close your eyes.\u201d He commanded.Her eyes, dimmed by the building pleasure, fluttered open and fixed upon his dark gaze. His dark pools seemed to pull her. As he looked into those dark orbs, Tae-jun felt an intense explosion within. It felt like the emotions that were caged since eons, were released.He let go, succumbed to his passion, and in a few intense thrusts which caused her head to bang against the headboard multiple times, he reached his climax.Sweat trickled down her back, Hye-yeon struggled to catch her breath. When she finally did, she couldn\u2019t help but utter. \u201cWill our relationship be like this?\u201dHer soft voice was as dismal as the darkness that shrouded the room. Burying his lips on the woman\u2019s bare shoulders, Tae-jun spoke.\u201cI will have you whenever I want to.\u201d\u201cThen I am a doll named \u2018Hye-yeon\u2019 to you.\u201dHe didn\u2019t remember what he\u2019d said when he heard her voice, but by the sound of it, it seemed like she\u2019d given up everything.\u2746\u2746\u2746It was a dream.Tae-jun rubbed his face up and down vigorously. He reckoned he fell asleep leaning on the sofa.Whydidhedreamofthefirsttimehehads*xwithHye-yeon? He sighed.These past few days, he had slept but for less than two hours a day. It was also a hassle that the land deal overlapped with the annual event. To him, showing up for such dos was merely a duty, throw in a few interviews and personnel appointments in the mix and he went about the job mechanically.Furthermore, he had to fight against the myriad of emotions that hit him like a plague at this time of the year\u2013this was the month Hye-yeon died.Hye-yeon Jin\u2026 whenever he thought of her, the dark and deep Jinseong river would appear before his eyes; the cold winds that gently touched his body and cut his heart, the sound of the softly flowing water that wreaked havoc in his senses.It was still fresh like it\u2019d happened just yesterday. And why not? Forshewas the woman who had given him hope only to beat him back to the bottomless abyss fiercely.Time and again, he\u2019d asked himself how much longer it would take him to forget the woman who still lived in his dreams and memories. Time and again, the answer had been more dreams and memories.[E/D: Really? Wonder who wanted it only for a year!]Tae-jun\u2019s eyes were fixated on the large TV screen. The video was paused on a face. It looked very\u2026alive.The film still before his eyes was certainly not a dream. It was definitely her on the original CCTV in the lobby of Hotel Seoin. The very woman who had learned, felt, and gasped for pleasure underneath him.It seemed like time had stood still, too. Her white skin, straight nose, and deep black eyes looked just like they did then. Those slender fingers holding the phone, plump lips, were as inviting as they were before.He couldn\u2019t believe that she was standing there in flesh and blood, in the pink of health, pretending to be someone who\u2019d nothing to do with him.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euDidshereallythinkshe\u2019snothingtodowith me now?Tae-jun wouldn\u2019t allow that. Never would he let any man, boyfriend or husband, linger around her. No one but him was allowed to touch and feel her. She was his and only his.He\u2019d vowed to find her. If she were alive, he would find her, even if it meant turning the whole world upside down. If not? He would bring back her lifeless body, but find her, he would.He pulled out a cigarette and flipped it into his mouth. The moment he lit it, his eyes inadvertently gazed into those on the screen. He was reminded of how she hated cigarette smoke. She\u2019d made him, a heavy smoker, give up smoking.He wondered if she still hated it. He puffed out smoke on the woman on the screen.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He seemed more convinced by the bundle of banknotes that was pushed in front of him. Anyway, he called Hye-yeon Jin an impressive beauty. Well, at least that part, he had it right.The problem was what came after. Hye-yeon had gotten off at a busy subway station. What with about 100 hotels and an equal number, if not more, residences in the vicinity, this station was hustling and bustling with foreign tourists and commuters alike. Jin-wook had his underlings investigate by questioning the nearby stores and subway stations. Clearly, it was like looking\u00a0for\u00a0a\u00a0needle\u00a0in\u00a0a\u00a0haystack.After the investigation turned up with decisive naught, Jin-wook wasn\u2019t surprised. This was an expected result. Soon, he started deliberating about other possible means of solving this conundrum. However, after hitting a lot of dead ends, what got him thinking eventually, was Hye-yeon\u2019s death.The fact that the dead woman was alive meant that the case hadn\u2019t been handled properly at the time. There had to be loopholes in the flawless story that was played before them. He was certain, now more than ever, that this \u2018death\u2019 was not as simple as it seemed. And there was only one way of finding out\u2026Jin-wook was no ordinary assistant. Neither was his background ordinary. In his days before Tae-jun, he was a fierce detective whose forte was finding people. No matter what, no matter where; dead or alive, if a person wanted to be found, Detective Jeong would never turn up empty-handed. His superior acumen had earned him the sobriquet \u2018cadaver dog\u2019.Jin-wook was an astute mind. He was someone who knew the importance of cultivating resources, and he\u2019d diligently done just that. Over the past 20 years, he had built an enviable network of police and people alike. And now that he worked for the Seoin family, this network was a very handy asset. Thus, through his acquaintance, he was able to be introduced to the officer who\u2019s in-charge of Hye-yeon\u2019s case back then.However, the officer had been transferred to Paju. Without delay, Jin-wook made an appointment to ask him about the incident.On the said day, Jin-wook arrived at the meeting place well before the scheduled time. As a detective, he had picked up certain habits along the way. He\u2019d always made meticulous notes to enable him to have the bird\u2019s eye view of the case in hand. And given his track record, this little habit had indeed brought him a long way. As he waited for the officer to arrive, he took out his usual notebook and started to recount the events surrounding Hye-yeon\u2019s disappearance.At that time, Tae-jun was on a two-week business trip to Europe. He was usually accompanied by his manager Mr. Lee, but Jin-wook was the one taking care this time as the continent was a little chaotic due to the terrorist attacks on people of color.It was on the second day of Tae-jun\u2019s business trip that Hye-yeon disappeared. She hadn\u2019t returned home since the time she had stepped out in the morning. The CCTV installed outside the house only showed her getting into a taxi in a hurry.By the time Tae-jun realized that she had vanished, it\u2019s the fifth day of his business trip. Her cell phone was off, and there was no sign of her whatsoever. He\u2019d immediately contacted her father. Mr. Jin said he would persuade his daughter as she seemed to be fickle for a moment, but Tae-jun didn\u2019t hear from him since.Throughout his stay in Europe, Tae-jun was a bundle of nerves. He was on the verge of losing his sh*t, especially when his stay was extended due to airport closure in the wake of the fresh terrorist attacks.To Jin-wook, that time when he had to watch Tae-jun, was no different from walking on thin ice.No sooner had their plane landed in Korea than they headed directly to President Myung-Je Jin\u2019s house. Tae-jun issued a gruesome warning in the car.[I won\u2019t let her out of the house for the time being.]However, what greeted him was a Hye-Seong Jin in mourning and not Hye-yeon, who\u2019s supposed to be waiting for Tae-jun at the residence of CEO Myung-je Jin. Tae-jun was shocked but said nothing. Yet, something hard to describe seemed to have been broken in him. Recollecting that very moment, Jin-wook rubbed his rough jaw.\u201cExcuse me, are you Jin-wook Jeong?\u201dA man with a\u00a0stocky\u00a0build approached him. He was the person who Jin-wook was supposed to meet today.Jin-wook rose from his seat and held out his hand for a handshake.\u201cNice to meet you. I heard you were in Jinseong city at the time.\u201dThe man remembered Hye-yeon Jin\u2019s case even though it had been quite some time. They ordered coffee and went straight to the main point.\u201cI\u2019ll be blunt. Can Hye-yeon be alive?\u201dCanshebealiveallthistime?\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m asking about the probability that the body of the autopsy report was not Hye-yeon\u2019s.\u201d\u201cHaha, this is so. I\u2019ve never had such a question in my police career.\u201dIfadeadwomanwasalive,itwouldmeanthatshewasn\u2019tdeadinthefirstplace,Jin-wook thought.It was the first time that the identity of the dead body was questioned. The death report could only be completed if the body examination report was required. What Jin-wook doubted was its authenticity. But the other man waved his hand.\u201cIt can never be.\u201d He outrightly rejected the theory. He was confident that there were no errors. \u201cThe DNA and the fingerprints were a perfect match. Also, the bereaved family confirmed that the body was Hye-yeon\u2019s.\u201dThe man\u2019s words were no different to those officials who\u2019d conducted the preliminary investigations. She was found in the river with no particular external injury. After identification, the body was handed over to the family. There was nothing strange about her death, no signs of struggle or robbery.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euWhothehellisthewomanwalkingaroundalive,whatisgoingonnow?!Jin-wook was confused.Jin-wook could only scratch his wry ballpoint pen on his notebook as if it\u00a0was\u00a0to be\u00a0blamed.\u00a0The man who had been talking for a long time said nothing that was not already known. Then, he suddenly lowered his voice\u2014he looked to have come to a decision.\u201cThe truth is\u2026 to be honest, I don\u2019t know if I can say this. But\u2026 there was\u2026 something strange about this case,\u201d he said, cautiously.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Jin-wook couldn\u2019t mask his eagerness.\u201cThe body was supposedly drowned, but her lungs were not filled with water.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

If so, wouldn\u2019t there be a possibility of murder? A chance that someone killed her and then put her in the river?\u201cThen, what is your opinion on the real cause of death?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. The prosecutor in charge was stopped from asking the National Forensic Service to look into the matter. From his immediate superior, no, maybe someone higher. He\u2019s been on TV a lot these days. You know, he\u2019s mentioned as the next presidential candidate. In-bae Lee, former mayor of Jinseong and the current governor of Gyeonggi.\u201d\u201cWhat about him?\u201d\u201cI was just a minor official at the time, so I didn\u2019t know what was going on. Anyway, we had to discard all the records pertaining to this case, so I don\u2019t have a picture left. I still remember this case because the way it was processed was very strange.\u201d\u201cCan I see the prosecutor who was in charge?\u201d\u201cYou can try, but he won\u2019t be helpful. He\u2019s been a part of In-bae\u2019s team from the start.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t her family raise any questions about her death?\u201d\u201cNot at all, and I heard she was cremated without a funeral.\u201d\u201cWasn\u2019t there a reinvestigation?\u201d\u201cWho would do it? The dead woman is the daughter of CEO Myung-je Jin. No one would have wanted to get involved in this matter unless CEO Jin himself stepped up. As did I. Back then, Jinseong City was like that\u2026 like Gotham City in Batman.\u201dJin-wook frowned thinking about Gotham,thecityofevilandcorruption.He was also well aware of the notoriety of CEO Myung-je Jin, who once controlled the city of Jinseong. Apart from helming a promising company, Jinseong Construction, he was also the head of a gang called Jinseongpa.Under the Jinseongpa banner, Myung-je Jin conducted all sorts of dirty works, including but not limited to smuggling, drugs, and prostitution. Being in cahoots with In-bae Lee, the then mayor of Jinseong City, unbridled, he\u2019d thrived. Whenever In-bae connected with entrepreneurs, politicians, and lawyers, the ties were forged with the money, drugs, and, of course, women supplied by Myung-je Jin. The two ran a systematic syndicate, righteous on the surface, vile underneath.They were absolutely evil and had the power to back it up. No one dared oppose them. So this officer\u2019s remark, expressing his flat refusal in getting involved in this shenanigan, was fully understandable.Finally, Jin-wook revealed the picture from the CCTV footage he\u2019s carrying in his notebook. He laid it on the table for the man to see.\u201cDo you know this woman by any chance?\u201dThe man took a few moments to look at the picture carefully. Then he shook his head and said, \u201cSorry, not familiar.\u201dJin-wook closed his eyes tight and rubbed his head. The discussion had come to an end. There was nothing else he\u2019d glean here. Taking a deep breath, he adjusted his thoughts and opened his eyes. He handed the man the payment that was agreed upon. The man thanked him, shook hands and took his leave.When he was finally all by himself, Jin-wook made a call to Tae-jun. He\u2019d to report to his boss, albeit an interim one. There was a lot of information, definite and ambiguous, explicit, and implicit. But for now, he decided to save his words on issues related to Hye-yeon\u2019s death. What mattered was confirmation of her death.\u201cHer whereabouts after getting out of the taxi are unknown. Where she got off was such a crowded place. And I met the police officer who was in charge of Hye-yeon\u2019s case. He said it was hard to find anything strange with the corpse. There was no rigged evidence.\u201d\u2013 So, is he sure that the body was Hye-yeon\u2019s?\u201cYes.\u201dThe dead girl was definitely Hye-yeon. He had hit a dead-end here. Jin-wook stared at the picture on the table before him. His instincts told him that the woman in the picture should be what he had to have doubts about. And never had his instincts failed him.\u2013 All right.Tae-jun said from the other side. There was not much emotion in his voice, not even dejection; as if he hadn\u2019t expected much from the start.\u2013 Then they would\u2019ve known.\u201cThey?\u201d\u2013 Hye-yeon\u2019s family.Jin-wook had also considered her father, CEO Myung-je Jin, and brother, Hye-seong Jin. However, the two most closely related to Hye-yeon had not been accounted for after the bankruptcy of Jinseong Construction. Jin-wook reported to Tae-jun his findings.\u201cMyung-je Jin died shortly after Jinseong Construction went bankrupt.\u201dThere was a brief silence.\u2013 What was the reason?\u201cHe was stabbed in the neck. It seems he\u2019d interfered in a scuffle between gangsters. Rumor has it that In-bae Lee hired someone to kill him.\u201d\u2013 He probably had a disagreement with Lee In-bae, I guess. He\u00a0was\u00a0only\u00a0reaping\u00a0what\u00a0he\u00a0had\u00a0sowed.\u00a0What about Hye-seong?\u201cRegarding Hye-seong\u2026 after his father\u2019s death, he went into hiding. It will take a while to find him.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u2013 Okay, keep working on it.Tae-jun finished the call with a short message.With the end of their conversation, thoughts reeled in Jin-wook\u2019s mind. He had been with Tae-jun for 20 years but the man had somehow developed some kind of sharp, barbaric desire after Hye-yeon\u2019s death. He seemed to be obsessed with her at every waking and non-waking moment. At first, he had brushed it off as a fleeting obsession, but four years hence, he held a different opinion. He knew his boss had yet to come to terms with her death. And now, this girl had shown up out of nowhere.Isitagoodsignorabadsign?Moreimportantly,whoisthisgirl?Jin-wook tapped on Hye-yeon\u2019s photo in his notebook with a ballpoint pen. This was a conundrum, perhaps the biggest in his life, and the \u2018cadaver dog\u2019 was determined to get to the bottom of it at all costs.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Jae-won smiled awkwardly and raised his head to look at the woman. She was looking back at him.\u201cWow\u2026\u201dHe felt dazed for a moment. The woman whose eyes met his was a great beauty. Jae-won stepped back without realizing it, feeling himself sinking into the depths of her eyes, which twinkled as bright as the stars.\u201cThank you.\u201d The woman gratefully said before bowing her head.Even with her departure, Jae-won\u2019s feet were nailed to its place; his gaze followed the woman walking away further in the distance.Whoisshe?Doessheworkhere?I\u2019msureIsawherleavetheGeneralManager\u2019soffice.\u201cDirector Lee? What are you doing here?\u201dIt was Ji-soo Kim, secretary to Si-yeon, who snapped Jae-won out of his reverie.This lovely woman was also the nanny who had been taking care of Si-yeon since she was a child. Once her ward had grown up and donned the professional hat, she was promoted to the position of secretary. For this, Jae-won knew her very well, too.\u201cOh, hello, Mrs. Kim. It\u2019s been a long time since I saw you at the engagement party. Is Si-yeon inside?\u201d\u201cYes, sir. What brings you here?\u201d\u201cI came here to deliver a gift,\u201d Jae-won said humorously.\u201cOh, the gift from the Seo family.\u201dAfter seeing the present that Jae-won was holding, Secretary Kim hurriedly opened the office door which revealed the Si-yeon sitting at her desk staring at something.Noticing her friend\u2019s presence, she looked up. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201dJae-won lifted the piece of artwork he\u2019d brought along and showed it to her. \u201cHere\u2019s your engagement gift.\u201dDelighted, Si-yeon rose from her seat with a glow on her face. She came over to him, hitting the floor rhythmically with her stiletto heels.\u201cIs that Delacroix? Seo family\u2019s personal collection?\u201d Si-yeon received the painting from Jae-won and carefully unwrapped it.\u201cBy the way, how long will Tae-jun stay in that boss\u2019 position? Is he trying to make it to 10 years? He\u2019s already engaged, so he should change a little now.\u201d\u201cWell, that\u2019s up to him. To be honest, the title doesn\u2019t matter. He is the next chairman anyway and already has all the power to make practical decisions. Now, he seems to be putting pressure on the executives. Like I\u2019m watching you guys.\u201d Jae-won imitated Tae-Jun\u2019s cold, dark gaze.\u201cHe\u2019s amazing anyway.\u201d Si-yeon shrugged her shoulders.Letting his gaze wander, Jae-won noticed scattered pictures on the desk. He picked one.\u201cWhat\u2019s this? It looks like a sculpture.\u201d\u201cThat is a sculpture I recently bought for the VIP lounge.\u201d\u201cDid you buy it again?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean again?\u201dSi-yeon, the heiress of Daejin Group, was interested in art, even though she took up management lessons. It had started as a rebellious streak to make use of her father\u2019s fortune to the fullest but then, by the time she took charge of the department store, she began to graft her interests with business.And her exquisite artistic sense made a big hit. She had a flair for this. Creating a gallery inside a department store, selling the works of famous artists in the lobby and sponsoring new artists were all projects undertaken by her.Above all, she\u00a0was a materialistic woman.\u00a0She spared\u00a0no\u00a0expense in collecting paintings and sculptures she deemed as decent pieces of works.\u201cYou bought another one which was a billion-dollar picture a few months ago. How much is it this time?\u201dSi-yeon took a moment to answer Jae-won\u2019s question. \u201c12 million.\u201d\u201c12 million won? That\u2019s good. You know, your usual spending is\u2026\u201d\u201c12 million dollars. You better wait until I finish my sentences.\u201dJae-won was lost for words. Since childhood, he was influenced by his mother, the gallery director and took art lessons in vain. In the world of art, he was a hopeless case. Delacroix\u2019s work, which Si-yeon had longed for, didn\u2019t impress him at all. What he saw in the picture now was not something marvelous either. The sculpture was a half-body of a woman, her feminine parts obscured by leaves. He was shocked at its price.\u201cAre you crazy?\u201d\u201cMy VIPs spend hundreds of millions of won a year, and only luxurious, high-quality artworks in the lounge can satisfy them. That is the most famous one in America right now, after Jeff Koons and Damien Hirst\u2019s works.\u201d\u201cNo matter how famous it is, this unfinished looking artwork is worth $12 million?\u201dShe put her hands on her waist and grumbled. \u201cIt\u2019s not incomplete. It\u2019s perfect! It\u2019s called \u2018The Heart of Apollo.\u2019 Look at the subtitle below.\u201dSmall letters were inscribed on the statue\u2019s base which read \u201cApollo\u2019s Broken Heart.\u201dThose words rang a bell and Jae-won recalled one of the tragic myths he happened to read during his school days.Apollo, one of the twelve gods of Olympus, was the god of music, poetry, art, the sun, reason and a great warrior. Also a patron of archery, he\u2019d mock the god of love Eros* for his use of bow and arrow.Upset by the constant ridicule, Eros decided to avenge himself. He prepared two arrows: a gold and a lead. There, he shot Apollo with the gold arrow, making him fall madly in love with Daphne, a nymph of the forest and here, he shot Daphne the lead arrow making her hate Apollo endlessly.[T/N:ErosistheGreekgodofloveandsex.HisRomancounterpartwasCupid\u201cdesire\u201d.Herewe\u2019retalkingabouttheverycherubwiththatsymbolicbowandarrowinhand,makingpeoplefallinlove.]With that began, literally, the love-hate saga. Daphne\u2019s deep-seated hatred for Apollo drove her farther and farther away from him, but the god never ceased chasing her. And at the moment she was finally caught by Apollo, Daphne pleaded her father to turn into a laurel tree to escape him. His love ended up destroying her.BrokenheartofApollo\u2026.Jae-won mumbled to himself, studying the painting.\u201cThen, is this half-woman Daphne?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dThe statue that looked sad in some ways, reminded Jae-won of the woman with impressive eyes he had just encountered.Immediately, a boyish grin emerged on his lips. \u201cSo, I just bumped into someone while I was coming here.\u201d\u201cOh, Miss Yuri Han?\u201d Strangely, her name matches well with her appearance, he thought. She looked as exquisite as an expensive crystal.[T/N:Yu-ri(\uc720\ub9ac)meansglass/crystalinKorean.]\u201cWhat does she do? Is she your employee?\u201d\u201cNo, not our staff. I told you before, right? She is Roy Jean\u2019s assistant.\u201d\u201cWhat was Roy Jean\u2019s assistant doing here?\u201d\u201cShe is going to take care of \u2018Heart of Apollo\u2019, which originated in the United States until it is installed in the lobby of the Daejin Department Store. Today, she stopped by for actual\u00a0inspection.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you think Roy Jean should be here when that amazing work costs around $12 million? What kind of assistant takes this big event?\u201d\u201cHe has a restoration\u00a0job in Japan, and I couldn\u2019t wait for him to be finally free and do his work here. Anyway, Yuri is an assistant recommended by Roy Jean. She also participated in the \u2018Heart of Apollo\u2019 work.\u201dSi-yeon stopped talking as she realized something.\u201cOh, you\u2019re interested in Yuri, aren\u2019t you?\u201dJae-won flinched at her guess but immediately cleared his throat and avoided her searching gaze.\u201cI only saw her once just now.\u201d\u201cYou always fall in love at first sight. Come to think of it, Yuri is your type.\u201d\u201cMy type?\u201d\u201cLong, skinny, white girls. You used to have the nickname \u2018model sucker\u2019, didn\u2019t you? You only like fair and thin women.\u201d\u201cThat was a long time ago.\u201d He frowned, \u201cThis is exactly the reason why having an old friend who knows your past is not good.\u201dSi-yeon giggled, seeing the red hue adorning Jae-won\u2019s cheeks.\u201cUnfortunately, you\u2019d better give up on her.\u201d\u201cWhy, is she married?\u201d\u201cNot that point, but there\u2019s a rumor that Roy Jean and her are having a quite special relationship. Assistants in this field usually are expected to be lovers of the artists they work for. It is too obvious. They actually travel together.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cReally?\u201dJae-won was a little disappointed because as his old friend had just pointed, she was indeed his type.Even so, he didn\u2019t mean to meddle in other people\u2019s love affairs. He didn\u2019t want to attract troubles. When it comes to life, work and love, he always preferred smooth sailing. That\u2019s why he moved into his mother\u2019s family side to avoid his father\u2019s company, where he had to compete fiercely with his brother.As a matter of fact, his dating life had always been \u2018successful\u2019. Of course, there were times that he met turbulence along the way, but the break-ups never caused him any problem.He never chose a complicated woman. Hence, the beautiful woman who caught his attention not too long ago was just a passing wish. Jae-won smirked and got rid of the image of the woman in his head.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She tried to hold her ground, fighting that surging emotion, reining in her sanity. And yet, as the unknown force firmly spread across her legs, her resolve quivered\u2014she surrendered.She felt his hands hold her thighs tightly as if afraid she\u2019d move. But only she knew that she wouldn\u2019t. She was inching deeper into the torrent of undercurrent, refusing to swim to the surface. Just then, something like an electric current jolted her body.The man had buried his face between her legs; a moan escaped her lips. Every time his lips and tongue tickled and sucked her sensitive part, her sight turned white. She felt a gush of pleasure, and finally, something burst forth.She shivered along with the sensation that swept her from head to toe. Calming herself, she lifted her eyelids at the touch. His lips that had made love to her were wet and velvety.The moment she felt that she gritted her teeth as she reached her peak. The dam broke. At the same time, the man in the dark made a rough insertion. Her hands, clutching the sheets, trembled at the sudden rush of stimuli into her.His tongue, which had been teasing her sensitive cl*t for a long time, was now tending to her aroused buds. Her body twisted in response. The rough movements that hit her deep quickly brought her out of ecstasy. Unlike the tremors, his fierce thrusts were inducing in her lower parts, his lips and tongue tasting her silky skin were relaxed and gentle.The man tossed her sweaty hair behind her ear and licked her earlobes. Her body swayed to his movements. She wondered when it would end; a guttural cry, which she belatedly realized, came from her.\u201cAh!\u201dHer eyes flew open; she was panting. She looked around her. It was still dark. Although she was certain it was a dream, her body dripping with sweat made it feel like she\u2019d actually had s*x. She felt hot and cold at the same time.Even being wide awake, Yuri Han couldn\u2019t find even a semblance of reality for a while. She looked around everywhere as if seeking for something reassuring. On the side table, the medicine sat untouched. She seemed to have fallen asleep while fiddling with the medication, which she ought to take before going to bed.It\u2019sthatdreamagain.She buried her face in her hands, barely catching her breath\u2014a result of the excitement she had just experienced.It\u2019sallright, it\u2019sallright.She mumbled.Taking a long deep breath, she got herself off the bed. She could feel her legs quiver as they touched the ground, her trembling hands brushed aside the damp hair on her face. She took a moment to collect herself, or rather she thought she did.Trudging to the bathroom, she dragged herself to the edge of the bathtub. Turning on the faucet, she blankly stared at the hot water filling the bathtub. Then, bit by bit, she lowered herself into the tub. When she felt the heat around her, she hugged her knees, closed her eyes, and buried her face. She could do nothing else, Yuri was drained. It\u2019s not like she\u2019d not slept enough, even then she was exhausted.Gradually, as she analyzed her dream, the past events surfaced to her mind.These \u2018dreams\u2019 had begun only after the hypnotherapy she\u2019d undergone as a part of her treatment. Since then, she had regular bouts that always threw her into disarray\u2026 And each time, the content of the dream was the same\u2014the same darkness, the same sounds and the same man indulging in an intense s*x with her.She never really understood why this kept repeating, neither could she ask the doctor about it\u2014 after all, what girl could describe the salacious scene without being embarrassed, even to a professional. \u00a0At some point, she even doubted if she were a nymphomaniac.Yuri\u2019s hand unconsciously touched where the man had put his tongue. The caresses, the rapture, and the pain\u2014 the dream was as vivid as reality. When the scenes flitted past her mind again, her body heated up.Whoareyou?She leaned her head on the edge of the bathtub and asked the man in her dream\u2026 as if he\u2019d look into her eyes and answer.At the end of every dream, she would be filled with curiosity as much as confusion. \u00a0She was intrigued by his identity, her connection, if any, to him.Whydoeshekeeponvisitingherdreams?And yet, despite it all, this man also evoked an unknown fear\u2026 as if he were the harbinger of despair and destruction.She came out of the bathroom only after the water had cooled. There was still time before dawn, but she couldn\u2019t dare to fall asleep again.Turning on her laptop, Yuri started working. Establishing a concept wasn\u2019t an easy task. A lot had to be considered. While the theme, locale, and color schemes were the prerequisites, setting up the background and lighting were vital for the installation process. She took a while to compile the details.Once done, she quickly composed an email to Roy Jean. She attached an image of the site inspection along with the exhibition concept portfolio presented by the Daejin Department Store. She didn\u2019t forget to mention her opinions and suggestions. When she was through, she hit send.For some time, Yuri stared blankly at the computer screen bearing the search engine. \u00a0Taking a deep breath, she typed in the search bar: Psychogenic Amnesia.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euA memory disorder resulting from psychological trauma.The exact cause cannot be determined, the possibility of healing varies from person to person\u2014the explanation she had read over a hundred times, the disease she had been suffering from for some time.Somehow, Yuri had no memory of five years ago. That didn\u2019t mean all her memories were gone. No, it wasn\u2019t the case. It was just that, as someone cut it out, only a year of time that should\u2019ve been stored in her brain had disappeared.The doctor who\u2019d first treated Yuri said that her memory was not lost but that it was hiding somewhere in the deep recesses of the brain refusing to surface right now. However, he\u2019d the confidence it\u2019d return and naturally in a few months or years. He\u2019d also added that there would be no significant confusion because people\u2019s memories are unclear anyway.All this while, Yuri had also tried to take it lightly. There was no problem with her day-to-day life, and there was nothing majorly upsetting either. As the doctor had said, no one in the world could remember absolutely everything. She was quite resigned to this logic, save one slight problem.The hidden memory had stowed away something vital to her. This memory was akin to gravity; yes, the very one that keeps things glued to the ground.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

That fine line between real and surreal seemed to have faded. And as cracks piled up one by one every day, something popped through the cracks. In her case, self-harm or suicide attempt.After going through it twice, alarmed, her uncle inquired around and took her to Dr. Davis.Dr. Davis added another name to Yuri\u2019s psychogenic memory illness. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). He was one of the leading doctors in the PTSD field.Davis had urged her to tackle the psychological trauma first. In order to do so, it was necessary to know where the whole thing stemmed from. He\u2019d tried hard to bring it out, even going as far as creating traumatic scenarios to stimulate her latent memory. In turn, this would trigger her auto-defense mechanism and she would be able to at least share, if not get rid, of the harrowing experience.But treatment had repeatedly hit a snag. Yuri\u2019s rejection was beyond his expectation. Whenever she tried to recall even a little bit of memory, she would have severe pain and vomiting after which she\u2019d faint.Thus, Davis took a step back, saying, \u201cLet\u2019s take our time and go slowly.\u201d He then introduced \u201cRoy Jean\u201d, saying that someone had shown interest when Yuri was undergoing art therapy.Roy Jean, a famous installation artist, was also a close friend of Dr. Davis. At the time, he was a kindred spirit\u2014 down in the dumps, taking a long break from work and under his friend\u2019s professional care. Yuri was offered the position of his assistant. Thereon, he went on to become a teacher, boss, and benefactor to her.One by one, people started to appear on the empty street. The sun was gradually rising, the day had officially kickstarted.She was looking out the window, a cup of coffee in hand, when her cell phone rang. It was Roy. Putting her cup down, a surprised Yuri answered the call.\u201cRoy? How are you doing?\u201d-I got your email.\u201cYou didn\u2019t sleep?\u201d-I can\u2019t sleep because of the rain. It\u2019s been raining here since last night. And you?\u201cI just woke up.\u201d-Are you uncomfortable at the new hotel?\u201cNo, it\u2019s not. I just had a bad dream.\u201dHer first stay was at Hotel Seoin. Since the Daejin Department Store had offered to take charge of accommodation during her stay in Korea and made the reservation, she had no say in it. It\u2019s not a standard, but a deluxe room.At first, she was excited by the unexpected luxury. However, her joy was short lived. She had hardly stepped into the room when Yuri felt her head spinning; her hands and feet began to tremble, she felt her chest tightening. It was a feeling similar to a panic attack. It was a miracle that she\u2019d managed to leave the room without a complication. She had no choice but to ask Daejin Department Store to cancel her stay.Roy\u2019s voice calmed her thoughts. Somehow, he always reassured her. Ever since he\u2019d saved her from being stuck in that room\u2026 dying, she\u2019d developed an uncanny relationship with him.She could never forget Roy\u2019s face from that day, his eyes that were looking at her when she\u2019d opened her eyes. They held\u2026 regret. Since that day, time and again, she had seen Roy look at her with the same emotion.\u2013 When will \u2018heart\u2019 get there?\u201cWell, it\u2019ll be delivered in two days.\u201d\u2013 I see. I checked your email and I think you should change the tone of the main light in the showroom to darker\u2014to bring out the feeling of the abyss. Make the surrounding brighter.\u201cYes, I will forward your opinion to Daejin Department Store.\u201d\u2013 How does it feel to be visiting your home country after a long time? Davis said it might help you with the memory.\u201cTo be honest, I don\u2019t know.\u201d\u2013 Is that so?After talking a while more, as she tried to wrap up the call, Roy suddenly asked\u2026\u2013 Yuri, do you still draw \u2018The Man\u2019?She was speechless and suddenly felt out of breath. She tried to compose herself by taking a breath.\u201cNo, I don\u2019t draw anymore,\u201d she said.Davis\u2019 art therapy included a session of painting in which she was bizarrely obsessed with one object. No matter the hour, no matter the scenery around, her hands would always end up painting the man. And should she defy this coercive cycle by refusing to draw altogether, the man would visit her in her dream. Simply put, there was no way she\u2019d escape this man.After she\u2019d hung up, Yuri simply slumped on the bed. She felt like someone had sucked the life out of her. For a long time, she kept staring at her own hands. These were the very hands that had once created masterpieces. They were her magic wand, doing her bidding and leaving everyone mesmerized. Their partnership made for stellar shows.But now, all that felt like another lifetime. For these hands could do nothing now. They were just that, hands; the magic seemed to have been\u2026 lost. They felt soulless\u2026 dead. She wondered how it had come to this. She wondered if she were cursed.Yuri closed her eyes feeling hopeless.By the time Yuri had wrapped up her meeting with the planning team of Daejin Department Store, it was lunchtime. She was hungry. She, who was thinking of going back to the hotel, rode down the escalator and into the food section of the department store for a simple meal.Even as she neared the food court, she could smell the delicious aroma wafting from its direction. What greeted her when she entered was a spacious and lively area lined with a variety of kiosks. She was not new to this concept, however, she was intimidated by the food which looked spectacular.It was a dumpling shop called \u201cSeohwadang\u201d where Yuri circled around and stopped at.As soon as she checked the sign, she had a slight doubt.Huh?! Seohwadang\u2026 in a department store?!Seohwadang was the oldest dumpling shop in Jinseong. The \u2018shop\u2019 was actually an old hanok that lent a warm touch to its homestyle food and ambience. It was also a popular place to steam dumplings. In the large hanging cauldron in their courtyard, anyone was welcome to dump a few dumplings on their own. Patrons loved the idea of creating their own dumplings and as it gained fame, this cauldron came to symbolize this quaint place. Anyone who was remotely aware of this joint, would recognize the pot at a glance.Although it was different from how she remembered it to be, right now, in this modern setting, the cauldron was the only item serving as evidence of authenticity. What\u2019s more, the steam rising from it assured her that neither was she mistaken nor delusioned. Indeed,thiswas her favorite dumpling place![T/N: Hanok</u> is a traditional Korean house. They\u2019re quite pretty, take a peek.]Standing by the order counter, a pleased as punch Yuri, ordered chicken and chives dumplings without further ado. She\u2019d loved this in the past and couldn\u2019t wait to taste. However, the staff who received the order looked troubled.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but the item you ordered will take a long time, so why don\u2019t you change it to something else please?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euOuch, what a disappointment! But\u2026 that was something she wanted to eat the most!Just as she was considering waiting until the staff made a fresh batch, a voice stopped her in her thoughts.\u201cMinus a serving from my order please. I\u2019ll change it to shrimp.\u201dYuri raised her head.A tall guy, with bright brown hair and beautiful eyes, was looking down at her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Yuri, shying away from the stranger\u2019s kind gesture, shook her head and said, \u201cAh, no. It\u2019s fine.\u201d\u201cCome on. It\u2019s really okay. I also like shrimps, so it won\u2019t be a problem.\u201dShe was about to refuse again when the clerk, seeing the long line behind them, gauged her to accept his offer, \u201cYou\u2019re too kind, sir. Thank you.\u201d\u201cMy pleasure. You see that quote up there?\u201d He pointed to a dangling piece of paper plastered on the wall, \u201cIt is better to share delicious food with others. And the food here is excellent if you might ask me.\u201d He grinned.The man winked at Yuri and, to her surprise, continued to converse with her.\u201cDo you \u00a0remember where we met before?\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d She looked up at his face and narrowed her eyes, trying to see if his face would indeed ring some bells.Is he hitting on me?Seeing her confused and clueless face, the man felt disappointed. Hence his eyes lost its cheer. \u201cWe met a few days ago, on your way out of the office of head director.\u201dOh, I remember. He was the man who was holding an item which looked like a painting covered in paper!Putting on a small smile, she nodded, \u201cI remember you now.\u201d\u201cI think it is destiny so, why don\u2019t we ask each other\u2019s name? I\u2019m Jae-won Lee, and you are?\u201d He confidently prodded, his face bright as he expected an immediate answer.\u201cI\u2019m Yuri Han.\u201d\u201cMs. Han, will you go to Si-yeon\u2019s\u2026 Ah no, the head director\u2019s office today? I\u2019m asking because I\u2019ll be visiting her office later.\u201d\u201cNo. I don\u2019t have a reason to go to the head director\u2019s office today.\u201d\u201cAh, really. Too bad,\u201d said Jae-won while scratching his head in embarrassment.At that time, the clerk from the counter gave Yuri a box of dim sum and a couple of take-out orders to Jae-won. When she got the tray, she turned her head at the generous man, who winked at her again, \u201cEnjoy your meal.\u201dYuri nodded and emitted a small thanks.He held many packages on both of his hands, but still, he was able to wave one hand to Yuri.Left alone to her peace, at last, Yuri sat on the corner and followed Jae-won\u2019s retreating figure with her gaze. He was heading out of the store in wide strides like he was in a hurry.What is his position that he could call the name of the head director so casually? With his looks and confidence, he doesn\u2019t look like an ordinary employee.It wasn\u2019t long when the scent of the dim sum wafted up to her nose, and her stomach grumbled in protest\u2013she was quite famished. Hence, she picked up the chopsticks while she continued to think over the man she just encountered.Ms. Si-yeon, the head director, is already engaged. Is he her fiance then?With this, came the image of the diamond ring that glinted on the fourth finger of Si-yeon. That must\u2019ve cost a fortune, she thought to herself.While her mind drifted, she unconsciously began cutting the fat dim sum into half with her chopsticks.When Yuri lived in Jinseong, her dad sometimes brought dim sum from Seohwadang on his way back from work. But\u2026 he had long left her alone\u2013her father was already dead.What was more, distressing was the fact that she had no memories of his death. According to her uncle, who arranged the funeral, it was a car accident. He was intoxicated when he drove his car one unfortunate night. It was such a tragedy\u2013which she couldn\u2019t quite recall.Her memory was vague, as if a dark veil covered it. Hopefully, coming back to her hometown would help her regain her lost memories.She heaved a sigh and decided to start on her meal. However, when she gazed at her plate, she was dumbfounded\u2013the aligned dim sums were all divided into half.Am I the one who did this?[It\u2019s too hot, let me cut these for you]As if on cue, a manly voice suddenly sliced through her head. Her hands shook, and the chopsticks fell from her grip.What was it just now?The voice was familiar yet; she couldn\u2019t figure out who its owner was. In her past, far long buried with her memory loss, there was someone who knew how she loved the dim sum from Seohwadang. That person used to bring her these treats and divides them for her into half, so the heat dissipates.From the short memory that rose to her head in a flash, Yuri felt nauseous. Eventually, she felt the bile coming up her throat. Covering her mouth, she headed towards the comfort room in wobbly but rushed steps.* * *When Jae-won went to the head director\u2019s office, he thought Secretary Kim would greet him as usual, but surprisingly, another man, whom he knew very much, was also in the room. When their eyes met, Mr. Lee stood up and bowed his head to him. Jae-won returned the gesture.\u201cOh, Mr. Lee, you are also here! Is my cousin, Mr. Seo, here too?\u201d\u201cYes, with his fiance, Ms. Si-yeon.\u201dNot a surprise at all.Upon his engagement with Si-yeon, Tae-jun was pushing his business in full gear. However, Si-yeon proved to be his match\u2013she was not just an ordinary, foxy woman who would risk everything. A true tactician, she didn\u2019t give it all without earning a massive profit on her end.The two were indeed fit for each other, people said. Their upcoming union would be a win-win situation for both of them\u2013and their families, of course. Their engagement gave birth to the steel partnership of two powerful companies.Yet, in terms of genuine affection between the couple, no one was certain if it ever existed between them.Not that it was necessary. Love isn\u2019t needed in flourishing a wealthy empire, isn\u2019t it?This fact made Jae-won wonder if compared to them, he could be considered abnormal. Why not? In this kind of world, he couldn\u2019t afford to do the things they do.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euWith a broad smile, he offered one streaming box to Mr. Lee, \u201cAre you hungry? I brought dim sums with me. Try some! I bought a lot,\u201d Ms. Kim then appeared in the doorway, \u201cAh, Ms. Kim, these dim sums are from Seohwadang! It\u2019s still a good business.\u201dTwo years ago, Si-yeon, in search of profitable business partners, went to Jinseong to try the dim sums from Seohwadang. A tiresome transaction which led to fruitful results\u2013Seohwadang dim sums are now offered in Daejin Department Store. Ms. Kim, who was aware of her boss\u2019 efforts, smiled and nodded her head.\u201cIt still has the highest rank in sales in the food court. I heard that Seohwadang dim sums were introduced by Mr. Jae-won Lee?\u201dJae-won was indeed the one who introduced the delicious dim sums to Si-yeon, but he was not the first one to have seen potential in the small, dull shop in Jinseong\u2013it was none other than Tae-jun.Five years ago, Tae-Jun would travel to Jinseong, which was 2 hours away from Seoul, just to buy the dim sums of Seohwadang. In the long run, he also invited Jae-won to try the said delicacy.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The mixture of chicken and chives is fantastic.\u201d He beamed, \u201cWill the meeting inside take long?\u201d\u201cNo. It will end very soon. Mr. Seo will leave at lunch.\u201dThe pointed words of Ms. Kim made Mr. Lee cleared his throat. The couple was willing to meet at a business meeting, but couldn\u2019t spare time for a short lunch together.How odd.As Ms. Kim had said, a staff member went out of the conference room, just minutes away from lunch.Jae-won simply nodded at him, and boldly, peeped at the now open door. Inside, two people faced each other, looking at documents. It was not a romantic sight.Who would say that they are an engaged couple?Si-yeon\u2019s eyes were glued on the papers she held. When she looked up and saw Jae-won, she instantly brightened up and greeted him cheerfully.\u201cWhat brings you here?\u201dSitting opposite Si-yeon, Tae-jun also noticed his cousin\u2019s arrival. He took off the glasses perched upon his aristocratic nose and rubbed the area between his eyes. Without his spectacles concealing his features, his gaze now looked sharper.Bare face, Jae-won could finally see his sour mood. Soon, Tae-jun\u2019s pointed gaze landed on Jae-won\u2019s full hands.\u201cI brought dim sums from Seohwadang. If you haven\u2019t taken lunch yet, let\u2019s take one each.\u201d\u201cDid you come here just to bring dim sums?\u201dHe shook his head, \u201cIt\u2019s Director Seo\u2019s birthday in a few days. I went out to buy a gift and stopped by Seohwadang on my way back.\u201dSi-yeon perked up on her seat as she heard of this, \u201cOh, which made me remember\u2013I will have to purchase a gift too. I got an expensive painting as an engagement gift, so I\u2019ll have to reciprocate.\u201dHer hands dug into the bag, which still had several dim sum boxes, and gave on to Tae-jun, \u201cTake this, Tae-jun.\u201d\u201cNo. It\u2019s fine.\u201dSuch a cold-hearted man,was the first thought that came to Jae-won\u2019s mind as soon as he saw the scene unveil right before him.To save Si-yeon from embarrassment, he spoke, \u201cIf you don\u2019t have any appointments for lunch, just take one so that my efforts won\u2019t be in vain.\u201dHence, Tae-jun had no choice but to take the lunchbox. And as his habit, upon opening it, he divided the dim sum into half by his chopsticks.\u201cWhy are you doing that? Chopping the dim sums in half when you can just swallow it whole?\u201d Upon seeing the bizarre habit, Jae-won couldn\u2019t help but ask.\u201cIt\u2019s hot.\u201d Tae-jun inattentively responded.Due to his body\u2019s natural hot temperature, he hated hot food and even drank iced coffee in the middle of winter.As soon as he did so, the tantalizing smell of chicken and chives permitted in the air. But instead of devouring the dish, a frown marred Tae-jun\u2019s face, and he dropped his chopsticks,Jae-won asked Tae-jun with an odd face, \u201cDon\u2019t you like it?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not my type.\u201d\u201cBut, why did you take me there befo\u2013\u201d Jae-won murmured to himself and stopped, wary of Si-yeon\u2019s presence in the room.He knew Tae-jun liked a girl, who used to love these dim sums before. Her name was Hye-yeon Jin.What happened on his search for her?Quick-witted, Si-yeon felt something strange immediately, so she stared at Jae-won with wide, curious eyes. In his defense, the latter quickly changed the subject and shook off his friend\u2019s inquisitive gaze.\u201cOh, about the upcoming exhibition in the lobby of Seo-in Hotel, why don\u2019t we suggest the work of Roy Jean?\u201d\u201cRoy Jean?\u201d\u201cHe is a Korean-American artist and is popular in his sculptures in America. It would be good to feature his works here in Daejin department store. I met his assistant too. It will be easy to gauge them into an agreement.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s up to you,\u201d Tae-jun held his documents with a stoic face and stood up.\u201cAre you leaving?\u201d Si-yeon questioned Tae-jun with a surprised face.\u201cWe are done. I will send you again the draft of the plan after modifying it as you requested.\u201d And with that, Tae-jun went out as cold as winter.Jae-won clicked his tongue.That\u2019s why Ms. Kim is displeased.Fortunately, Si-yeon, the person involved, showed interest in other things instead of her uncaring fiance.\u201cWhy \u2018Roy Jean\u2019?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThe exhibition in the lobby of the Seo-in Hotel. Didn\u2019t the exclusive writers of Seo-in Gallery usually do it?\u201d\u201cIt was a decision made from an internal meeting of the planning team. There is a rumor that the tax investigation will be reinforced, so If possible, I am planning to recruit artists from overseas. And quality-wise, I like his artwork. To add on to that, he is one of your favorite artists.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the catch? I thought you were not interested in him. Is it because of Ms. Yuri Han?\u201d Her eyes flashed with mischievousness.\u201cI know how to separate the business with pleasure,\u201d replied Jae-won defensively.He didn\u2019t have the desire to tell Si-yeon that he met Yuri a while ago in Seohwadang. She would only tease him of it.All this time, he remained curious.Did she eat the dim sums I gave her?\u201cAre.. are you already leaving?\u201dMr. Lee, who was in the office pantry, popping one dim sum in his mouth, stood up when he saw Tae-jun coming out from the Si-yeon\u2019s office.\u201cIt\u2019s done.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026 Jae-won came just now.\u201d\u201cShould that be relevant to me?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euMr. Lee glanced up and read the face of Ms. Kim, who was beside him. Jae-won was his cousin, and Si-yeon was his fiance. Would a little time spent with them hurt?Indeed, the engagement was far from being romantic\u2013it was only for the sole purpose of convenience.But, is it okay for him to let her fiance have a closer relationship with another guy, not to mention, his cousin?Tae-jun handed over the document to him. Mr. Lee nodded to Ms. Kim and followed his boss in haste.The two hopped on the elevator, Tae-jun pressed the basement button and thought deeply about Jin-wook\u2019s latest report.Her trace was still unknown. When Tae-jun was trying to find Hye-yeon Jin, he had not much idea about her. Her father was Jin Myungje, the CEO, and her brother was Jin Hyesung. She majored in sculpture from H Art university.

But her name is not on the school register for the year you mentioned.Really? Did you try enough for sure?I\u2019ve checked through all the departments meticulously, but there\u2019s no mention of her. Just in case she enrolled in a different year, I looked through the list of graduates for the last five years too. There is no such name, nothing even similar. By the way, how did you know about her school? I don\u2019t think you did any background check on Hye-yeon Jin.She\u2019d accidentally mentioned it once. There\u2019s no reason to lie. Why are you suddenly curious about that?There\u2019s a few moments of silence from the other end. Then, at the words that Jin-wook said next, Tae-jun\u2019s breath stilled.The woman we are looking for may not be Hye-yeon Jin.What?!I can\u2019t give you any more details because I still have things to check. I will be heading to Jinseong City to find people close to her family, former employees of Hotel Jinseong and anyone who was remotely associated with the Jins. This is the best I can do for now.Death\u2013fake, school\u2013fake, identity\u2013fake\u2026 Tae-jun laughed at the thought that he knew nothing about Hye-yeon Jin. He had spent a whole year with this woman,one whole year\u2026and he still knew absolutely nothing!What we had\u2026 was that fake too?Bitterness wreathed his heart, he felt an ineffable pain.Just like him, she especially loved the chicken and chives dumplings from Seohwadang. Though, unlike his ravenous appetite, she nibbled like a bird. Every time she ate them, her eyes shone with a glint of unusual happiness.For a whole year, they had lived under the same roof, breathed the same air. And a year is not a short time to know someone. No! She was definitely not a stranger to him.He genuinely fell for the woman\u2014far from his original intention of using her for her body alone. And until this very moment, he still was hopelessly in love with her.Hye-yeon Jin\u2026It was not like he knew nothing about her. In fact, he did know quite a lot about her. Her likes, habits, the books she read, the food she loved and even her favorite brand of ice cream\u2026 \u00a0how she sought warmth in his embraces, the sounds she made when he touched her, her joy and smiles, tears and despair\u2026 he knew them all. Yes, he knew her.Unbeknownst to her, Tae-jun also knew that she drew sketches of him while he was asleep. Whenever she\u2019s not around, he would look them over.It was not until now that he realized that there were still a lot of things he didn\u2019t know about Hye-yeon. What he knew about her, wouldn\u2019t help in finding her. And what he ought to have known, was thoroughly concealed from him.\u201cAhem\u2026 sir?\u201dIt was his manager, Mr. Lee\u2019s troubled voice that pulled him from his reverie. They were already on the ground floor but the other seemed hesitant about getting off the elevator.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I think I left the documents given by the head of Seoin Food upstairs.\u201dTae-jun\u2019s eyebrows shot up. He glared at Mr. Lee and turned on his heels.\u201cYou have five minutes. I\u2019ll wait in the car.\u201d\u201cYes, sir.\u201dFive minutes was too short to make it, but Mr. Lee couldn\u2019t dare to complain about it. Instead, he hurriedly pressed the button of the elevator again, intending to reach the head director\u2019s office in the briefest time.Darn those dumplings!!!He was merrily stuffing one in his mouth, when who knew his capricious boss would suddenly decide to leave. It was too hot and had even burned his palate . Distracted by the pain and his boss rushing him to head out immediately, he forgot the important documents behind. Hence, he was in this position\u2014muttering curses under his breath as the seconds swiftly ticked by.Fortunately, Secretary Kim had noticed the papers he left behind and brought them to the lobby on the first floor. When he received her call and even before she could finish his words, he had already wedged his arms between the closing elevator doors to keep it from closing.Hence, sensing the sudden obstruction, the door of the elevator opened wide again. Wasting no time, Mr. Lee dashed out. However, in his haste, his shirt suddenly hooked on to something on the bag of a woman standing just outside the elevator.\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m in a bit of a hurry.\u201d He apologized profusely, glancing at the woman\u2019s face before heading off.He hurriedly wrested his arm away from the woman\u2019s bag and darted towards the lobby. The sound of his shirt tearing was quite loud, and the woman heard it too. She looked on at the rushing figure in perplexion. However, the sprinting figure couldn\u2019t afford to care about his ruined shirt\u2013after all, he was racing against time.He found Kim, took the documents, shot her a flying thank you, and ran towards the nearest emergency exit. He didn\u2019t waste time waiting for the elevator and instead took the fastest route to the parking lot. Climbing down two steps at a time, huffing and puffing, he made it to his destination.As he opened the rear door, he saw Tae-jun looking at his watch as if he had been waiting for a long long time.\u201cExactly five minutes.\u201dAt those words, Mr. Lee, who was granted a new lease of life, heaved a sigh of relief. Sweating and breathing raggedly, he handed the documents to Tae-jun and sat beside him, closing the door as he did so. But, something he didn\u2019t expect happened in a flash.Tae-jun\u2019s serene face morphed into a look of agitation and he grabbed Mr. Lee\u2019s wrist which catapulted his body to Tae-jun\u2019s enormous build. Mr. Lee gasped, eyes widened in shock.Perhaps, if this scene transpired between two people of the opposite gender, it might appear romantic. But for him, who was terrified, he felt nothing less than fear. If anything, more fear.\u201cSi-sir?\u201d\u201cWhat is this?\u201d Tae-jun pointed to his cuff.Mr. Lee frowned as he saw something stuck on it. He took it off with a surprised face. Looking closely, it was an ornament made of agate stone.Only then did his encounter with a woman back in the elevator resurfaced in his mind. There was no doubt that she was the owner.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThis is a bag embellishment.\u201d\u201cWhy is it with you?\u201d\u201cMy sleeve got caught in a lady\u2019s bag when I hopped out of the elevator in a frenzy. She was carrying quite a multi-decorated bag, I remember. This is definitely hers.\u201d Mr. Lee explained as he gazed at the colorful ornament.It was an unusual ornament, reflecting its equally unusual owner. She was a tall and beautiful lady, but her eyes looked cold, devoid of any light when she lifted her gaze to meet his.Suddenly, Tae-jun froze\u2014the expression on his face becoming ten times more serious than when Mr. Lee said he left the documents.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Left to him, he\u2019d shake the answers out of this dimwit called assistant.Mr. Lee stuttered and described the woman as her image came to his mind. \u201cShe was tall and fair\u2026 I think she had big eyes.\u201d\u201cWhat floor?\u201d\u201cFirst-floor lobby.\u201dIt was Tae-jun\u2019s turn to bolt now. Getting out of the car, he made it straight into the building. Mr. Lee, stunned, chased after him.Arriving in the lobby on the first floor, Tae-jun scoured the surroundings, his sharp eyes darting in all directions. His heart was beating fast, blood gushing through his veins wildly. Like a hound in search of a hidden prey in a deep thicket, he felt his senses heightened.After a long time, his senses as a hunter had come alive. Amidst the crowd, Tae-jun snatched a woman\u2019s arm out of the blue.\u201cAh!\u201dThe woman held up by him looked at him in surprise.\u201cWhat?\u201dNo.Thisisn\u2019ther.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201dGoddamnit!He muttered under his breath. The energy he felt right around here was gone. He felt as if his life was sucked out of his mouth, helplessness, dejection, and grief suffused his dark eyes.The woman slipped out of his grasp\u2026 a second time.\u2746\u2746\u2746Tae-jun, who\u2019d changed his schedule to visit the company and thereon his parents\u2019 home, did a u-turn and went straight to his place. All along, he held the ornament between his fingers and examined it closely. It was not branded nor a ready-made product.As soon as he reached, he went directly to his study and opened the drawer. Taking a picture out of the paper bag in the drawer, he put it on his desk. It was a picture of CCTV footage of the Hotel Seoin.\u201cHye-yeon! Itisyou!\u201dTae-jun contrasted the ornament in his hand with the ornament on the woman\u2019s bag in the picture. There was no way he could miss this unique design. It matched! Then he poured out the contents of the paper bag onto the desk and picked out all the other pictures that featured the bag and compared them again, just to be sure. Match again! He glared at the photo to the point he got goosebumps all over his body.Then, in frustration, he banged his fist on the desk. The pictures laying atop sprang in the air and scattered all over the floor\u2026 mirroring the master\u2019s mood at the moment.Tae-jun, who\u2019d smoked two cigarettes in a row now, called Jin-wook.\u201cHow are things in Jinseong?\u201d-Sir, I think there was a mistake, just like you said.Jin-wook\u2019s voice sounded urgent.\u201cMistake?\u201dTae-jun ran his tongue over his dry lips to moisten them. In the back of his mind, he was swiftly surmising.DeadHye-yeonJinandalivingwoman.Allpersonalinformation\u2013false.Right now, his conjecture was leading him to a terrible conclusion, the one he hoped against hope would be untrue.-I found someone who used to work at the Hotel Jinseong.

But\u2026 Hyun-ah says the woman in the picture is not Hye-yeon.Tae-jun closed his eyes, feeling dizzy. It was a different person. The woman who he believed was Hye-yeon for years was a completely different person!From the moment he saw the girl walking in the hotel lobby, to the time when he received Jin-wook\u2019s report, a tiny assumption had crept in his mind, the kind he had hoped would be proven wrong and sooner.Alas, it had been quite the opposite.***Upon returning from the department store, Yuri made an international call to Dr. Davis, ignoring the time difference.When the half-asleep doctor received the call, he knew the reason without needing to be told. However, he was reluctant to give more medicine.Listening to his worried voice, Yuri realized she was still a pretty troubled patient, still under observation.\u2013 Your problem is memory loss. If fundamental trauma treatment is not preceded, taking medicine will not solve the problem. You\u2019re not going to eat it all at once, like last time, are you?No\u2026She didn\u2019t mean to, but she couldn\u2019t get herself to say. The last time it happened, she didn\u2019t do it because she wanted to.Heck, she didn\u2019t even remember doing it.It was like she was stuck between the passing time of reality and some parts of the past, and when the gap closes, she explodes.Davis\u2019 soothing voice wafted from the other end, seemingly aware of the turmoil she was going through at the moment.\u2013 As I\u2019ve said before, this medicine is quite dangerous. I gave it to you because you\u2019re in so much pain, but you shouldn\u2019t keep relying on meds. You know it is not good for you.After some more advice and soothing, the worried Davis hung the call.It was not like she was oblivious to his concern, she too was helpless. As his worried voice rang in her ears, Yuri fidgeted with the part where the bag ornament had fallen off. It was only when she was in the taxi that she realized one of the ornaments had disappeared. It seemed to have fallen off when it was caught by a man\u2019s cuff in the elevator. She felt bad for losing it because it was handmade from agate stone.The headache, which started from walking around the department store, was still tormenting her. When she put one hand on her head, she was able to feel the heat. It was a recurring symptom. Davis said she shouldn\u2019t rely on medicines, but Yuri crawled to take medicine and lay in bed after downing one.

As soon as her father went away on a trip, she would jailbreak. And in such situations, she needed Yuri to pull off a ruse for her father\u2019s eyes were everywhere.\u201cYes. Dad\u2019s on a business trip and he\u2019ll be back in three days. Please cover me for three days. I\u2019ve decided to go on a trip to Japan with my boyfriend.\u201d\u201cBoyfriend? I heard you broke up a while ago. You\u2019ve gotten back with him again?\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about? This one\u2019s brand new! This time I found a really nice one. I mean, please\u2026 be my substitute for the last time?\u201dWhen she saw Yuri\u2019s figure burying itself under a blanket not caring a hoot, Hye-yeon panicked, \u201cI\u2019ll double\u2026 no, triple the hourly wage,\u201d she said in desperation.When the pitiful voice reached the sleep-deprived ears, the blanket was voluntarily pulled off. Money or not, Hye-yeon could never be refused.By the time she entered middle school, Yuri\u2019s father, who had failed to do business in Seoul, returned to his hometown of Jinseong City and took up a job as the driver of President Myung-je Jin. Thereon, Yuri had lived in the president\u2019s house for five years before going to art school in Seoul.Even though Hye-yeon and Yuri were friends, a huge social division was wedged between them. But that didn\u2019t stop them from helping each other and most importantly trusting one another. They knew of all the skeletons hidden in the other\u2019s closet, and well, they\u2019d even helped put some there.\u201cYou said you lost the chance to study abroad, but then why are you putting so much effort into drawing?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t just let go. I\u2019ll look for another chance.\u201d\u201cYour dad didn\u2019t say anything else about you losing the opportunity?\u201d\u201cHe thinks it\u2019s just because I\u2019m not good enough. I didn\u2019t tell him the details. So you keep it a secret, too.\u201d\u201cHow can I tell him that the professor blatantly offered you a \u2018sugar daddy-baby\u2019 relationship? Don\u2019t worry.\u201dUsing her delicate fingers, Hye-yeon then made a gesture of zipping her mouth to express her solidarity.\u2746\u2746\u2746Upon entering the bathroom, Yuri dipped her hands into cold water. She held them there until they were tingling. She looked alternately at her hands and herself in the mirror. She didn\u2019t think that she\u2019d lose everything in such a short time. Years of hard work was gone in a jiffy.She was a top graded student that had never missed the grand prize and the first place in the art contests, from elementary school to all the way to high school. The university she went to was also the most well-known art school in Korea, where her talent was recognized and she was successful. She would be the only student who would have won a chance to study abroad and hold an exhibition if it wasn\u2019t for the absurd demands of the professor who called her to his studio that day.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euShe was neither young nor na\u00efve to not know what he was asking for. It was very common in the art field. Nevertheless, Yuri couldn\u2019t stand the unpleasant touch from the professor who was groping her body. Disgusted at the very sight of him, she had stormed out of his office.However, the cost of refusing his offer was worse than expected. The exhibition that Yuri had been nominated for was canceled, and the opportunity to study abroad was also gone with it. As the professor held the highest authority in this field, it was a child\u2019s play to raze Yuri down to the ground and bury her dreams and aspirations.In vain, Yuri had vehemently complained and protested. There was no one to support her or worse hear her claims. She didn\u2019t have any evidence to back her and given the other party\u2019s lofty status, she was simply insignificant to be bothered with. The pervert professor had even assured her that he was going to destroy her career in the future.In the end, she was forced to take a semester break before graduation. Even so, she did not intend to visit the professor and beg him. She didn\u2019t want to gain her chance in that way nor give him the satisfaction of subjugating her.Yuri tried to smile at her pale face in the mirror.

It was something that she had seen growing up and was used to it because it was also something she usually did during her vacation to earn some extra money.As per usual, the front desk manager, Mr. Kim was attending to his duties when Yuri walked over. She was a known face here and well-liked too, but her presence only spelled tension for it guaranteed the absence of someone. As he looked at her joining Hyun-ah Kim in the reception area, a sigh escaped his lips but he said nothing.\u201cDid the princess go out again?\u201d Hyun-ah Kim asked in a whisper.The \u2018princess\u2019 was Hye-yeon. Since the moment she was born as the daughter of the President Myung-je Jin, she was often referred to as such.Front Desk Manager Kim and Hyun-ah Kim were experienced hands who\u2019d been working for Hotel Jinseong for 10 years now. They knew the ins and outs of the Jin family and were no strangers to the antics of the president\u2019s daughter. It was just that she would always land them in a spot and as much as they hated it, they had to suffer in silence.Yuri nodded and lowered her voice.\u201cIt\u2019ll take a few days for her to return.\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s good for us that you are better at work and English than the princess, but isn\u2019t it hard for you? Taking care of a princess.\u201d A curt Manager Kim sounded.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing like babying her. We are friends.\u201dHis terse words went in through Yuri\u2019s one ear and out the other. Unaffected, she went about her work.The city of Jinseong was situated along the Jinseong river. It was known for its picturesque settings mingled with reed fields. In particular, the Hotel Jinseong, located in the area where visitors could glimpse the river, was one of the most popular local attractions.However, the hotel\u2019s front desk during the daytime on weekdays, where there were no group tourists, was rather quiet. It was almost time for guests\u2019 check-inAs she saw a woman in her mid-to-late thirties rush to the front desk, Yuri looked to check the time thinking she must be a check-in.\u201cI am the one who stayed in room 1002 and called yesterday.\u201d She blurted.Hyun-ah Kim recognized her and soon addressed the matter.\u201cOh, are you Ms. In-sook Jung? I do remember you, ma\u2019am.\u201d\u201cCan I look in the room one more time? The thing I\u2019ve lost is really important to me.\u201d\u201cAs I said over the phone yesterday, our cleaning staff checked every corner of the room but couldn\u2019t find it.\u201d\u201cMy boy must have lost it while playing with it in bed. Please look for it one more time. It\u2019s my mother\u2019s keepsake.\u201d\u201cI am afraid I cannot.\u201dThe woman looked desperate and Hyun-ah Kim, troubled.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Yuri asked her colleague.\u201cShe\u2019s the guest who stayed in room 1002 two days ago. She said she\u2019s left something in the room. So I checked with the staff, they said they found no such thing when they\u2019re cleaning.\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t we look behind the side table or the bed? If the child lost it while playing with it, chances are it would have rolled away.\u201d The woman interjected, clearly not wanting to give up.\u201cMa\u2019am, the room is booked for two days from today. Plus, it\u2019s check-in time, the guest will be here any minute now.\u201dIt\u2019s two o\u2019clock when Yuri had checked. She wouldn\u2019t have interfered with this problem because it involved breaching the protocol, but the mention of \u2018mother\u2019s keepsake\u2019 had her wavering. It must be something she cherished. Yuri had lost her mother early and was raised by her grandmother. She could understand the woman\u2019s feelings. Thus, she quickly made an abrupt decision.\u201cI\u2019ll take a look at it.\u201d She declared.Hyun-ah Kim was taken aback. Here she was explaining, and there she had decided to help! She tried to stop her.\u201cWhat are you going to do? It\u2019s check-in time.\u201d\u201cNot many people check-in at exactly 2 pm on weekdays. Ten minutes should be enough. If the guest checks in, I\u2019ll provide a satisfactory explanation.\u201d After settling it with Hyun-ah Kim, she turned to the woman. \u201cMore than that, what does it look like, ma\u2019am?\u201dThe woman eagerly described the necklace. Yuri politely asked her to wait and then picked up the master key.\u201cI don\u2019t know if the manager\u2019s going to go crazy.\u201dYuri simply nodded at Hyun-ah Kim\u2019s remarks.\u2e19\u2e19\u2e19Room 1002 was on the top floor and the one with the most splendid view of the reed fields of the Jinseong river. Needless to say, it was one of the most expensive rooms in the hotel and came with a mandate:Atnocostshouldthisguestbeinconvenienced.Yuri hurriedly entered the room. She had no time to lose for she knew not when the guest would arrive. She got on all fours and began by looking under the bed and the nightstand. Next, she looked carefully under the dressing table and the cabinet. Since the housekeeping had not been able to find it, it only meant the necklace should be hidden from plain view. Even so, she didn\u2019t find it in those places.She got up and went to the middle of the room. She looked around as she pondered over. Soon her darting gaze stopped at the bed. Then, suddenly, she went over to it and put her hand behind the bed head.This was a place all too familiar to her. Little Yuri had often been scolded by her grandmother for losing things under her bed. She was especially scolded for missing her grandmother\u2019s cherished ring. When they looked, they had finally found it in the crevice on the bed head. \u00a0As her hand went in, her fingers touched something. It felt like a hook of a necklace. Yuri carefully pulled it out.ThankGod,Ifoundit.It was the moment when she held the necklace in her hand and was still rejoicing in her fortune, that she heard a voice.\u201c\u2026 what are you doing in my room?\u201dHer heart almost stopped. Slowly, she turned her head around and found a man standing there. He was a handsome, tall, and scary man with sharp, cold eyes and an aristocratic nose. He seemed to be the guest who\u2019d booked this room from today.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I can explain\u2026\u201dIn a trice, a flustered Yuri made an attempt to explain the situation. But the man\u2019s approach was faster.\u201cAh!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euIn an instant, her arm was bent and her head pressed against the mattress. And even before Yuri could figure out the situation, the man loosened his tie and bound her wrist. It all happened in the blink of an eye. There was no time to resist or struggle.Yuri breathed hard. She didn\u2019t know what to say\u2026 she panicked.\u201cOh, well\u2026.\u201d\u201cShh, stay still. If you don\u2019t want to get hurt.\u201dHe lightly pressed her head and looked into her face. She gulped hard her saliva. The man\u2019s pressure was overwhelming. Looking into those deep dark eyes, a muddled Yuri could only manage to nod.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There was no way to free herself and set the record state right now. But that didn\u2019t stop her from thinking of ways to get out of the situation. Turning her head sideways, she strained to look at what the man was up to.The man looked down at her for a brief moment before tightening his grip on her further. Then, freeing his other hand he fished something out of his bag. It was a black thing with a small antenna. She was terrified at the sight of this queer object and almost screamed for help, but soon gave up the idea upon realizing this was a soundproof room. This fellow looked quite natural with what he was doing as if he\u2019d overpowered and subdued people many times over. The dexterity with which he\u2019d bound her hands with a mere tie, sent a shiver down her spine.Few in the city of Jinseong were unaware that President Jin, a competent builder, and hotelier, was a forerunner in the crime circles. And having seen this middle-aged man\u2019s brutality from up close, Yuri was clear about the workings of the likes of him. Seeing how this fellow had made a short work of her, she vaguely assumed he must belong to the same fraternity as the president. And if so, there was nothing good about getting on his nerves.After a while, she noticed the man was not around her. Slowly, she pulled herself up and sat on the edge of the bed. Her eyes soon found him who was busy placing a radio-like object all over the room. It seemed like a scene from the TV show had come alive.For a while now, the man had been coming and going around the room like she didn\u2019t exist. He was in his own world, doing god knows what. Even after hooking her gaze on him for this long, she couldn\u2019t figure him. But then, suddenly, he just turned towards her and met her eyes.Yuri was startled at first, but upon seeing those dark, menacing eyes a sense of panic started to surge within. However, before it could manifest, a quote abruptly floated from the deep recesses of her mind:\u2018When encountering a tiger, you can survive if you hold yourself tight\u2019\u2026 In fact, the man, dressed in all black, looked like a black leopard.Slowly, the leopard approached her, she started to collect herself, determined to face him head-on.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like there\u2019s a camera or a bug, or is it yet to be installed?\u201d he asked abruptly.\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d She\u2019d imagined various scenarios in this short span of time, but this wasn\u2019t one of them!While Yuri was preoccupied with puzzling over his words, he ran an electronic device down her body as if scanning her. Only then did she realize that it was a bug detector and shook her head.\u201cOh, no, no, this is not what you think. The guest who stayed in this room a few days ago claimed to have left something behind, so I just dropped by to check.\u201d She hurriedly explained.\u201cWhat thing?\u201d He was clearly not buying it.\u201cThis\u2026 necklace.\u201d She pointed to the necklace that was now lying on the bed thanks to their prior scuffle.He looked in the direction she was pointing at and then at her with a gaze full of suspicion.\u201cHye-yeon Jin?\u201dSaying so, he abruptly reached out and yanked her name tag on the uniform. She didn\u2019t even have the moment to think that the man who put out his hand to her chest was rude.\u201cAre you Myung-je Jin\u2019s daughter, the president of this hotel?\u201dThinking on her feet, she tried to discern who he was. Seeing how he was testing rather than stating, she surmised he was not close to the Jins. And it seemed like he\u2019d only heard of Myung-je Jin\u2019s daughter, Hye-yeon, and never once seen her in the flesh.Yuri knew every single person around Hye-yeon, including the few scumbags she\u2019d dated. But the guy before her had never been included in any of those lists. That was another proof that he hadn\u2019t seen or met her.She was at a loss over what to do now. She was treading on thin ice and her next words would seal her fate. If she were, to be honest, and say she wasn\u2019t Hye-yeon, would he believe her? Or if she pretended to be her, would this dangerous man let her go?Throwing caution to the wind, she decided to bite the bullet. After all, she\u2019d to urgently get out of here first even if it meant getting caught later.\u201cYes, I am!\u201d she said, in a clear voice.\u201c\u2026 Let\u2019s get things straightened out, shall we?\u201dOn that note, he drew closer and started loosening the tie around her wrists. She groaned as she gently rubbed her red wrists.It was the first encounter\u2013straight out of a fairytale; the prince and the pauper had traded places.Yuri had become Hye-yeon.\u2e19Cold water slowly trickled down on Tae-jun\u2019s perfectly sculpted body. His mind had wandered off.So, you are President Jin\u2019s daughter.He\u2019d smirked at her.She was slender, tall, and fair\u2026 when he\u2019d untied them, her wrists were a deep red. Big, dark eyes graced her delicate face\u2026 showing resilience all along. She had a pleasant fragrance around her.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euInitially, he had qualms about her after all the whole scenario was uncanny. She wasn\u2019t a spy but the daughter\u2026 like in a movie\u2026 Heck! What are the odds of such a happening in real life? She had sworn not to reveal anything, going as far as to make him promise the same\u2026 perhaps a ruse to convince him? She was more daring and intelligent than he thought.Although they\u2019d struck a deal, he was sure, as soon as he set her free, she would run and tell all. But somehow, now that he thought about it, he felt the woman would probably not say a word, especially to her father. He didn\u2019t know why he felt so, but by and by his confidence deepened.Before his arrival, he\u2019d run a thorough check on all the personnel in Jinseong Construction and Hotel Jinseong. He only knew the name of the president\u2019s daughter who had nothing to do with the business. Little had he expected that Myung-je Jin, who was like a snake, had such a beautiful daughter. As her dazed, frozen face when he\u2019d bound her, came to his mind, his nether region stood erect.What the..!Perplexed, he looked down at his hard member.

Standing tall by the window, he looked at the Jinseong River. The very one that had devoured his father. The dark, still waters were unsettling, making him want a cigarette. He walked over to the table and picked up a pack and a lighter. The moment he had lit one, his cell phone buzzed. He checked the caller\u2019s name before answering.-Hello. Where are you now?\u201cHotel Jinseong.\u201d-Why the hell are you there? We get nothing good if President Jin knows.It was the boss of LJ Partners. Tae-jun called him \u2018Jay\u2019.LJ Partners was an investment firm on the papers, but in reality, it held a strong footing in M&A*. In particular, Jay had an outstanding ability in money flow and was an astute businessman. He went to the same university with Tae-jun. And both recognized the value of partners at the very first meeting. Since then, their partnership had only flourished.[*M&A is Mergers and Acquisitions.]-Oh, is today your father\u2019s death anniversary?Jay asked as if he had only just remembered. Instead of answering, his friend changed the topic.\u201cPresident Jin isn\u2019t here right now. I checked his schedule. What\u2019s your situation now?-Panic.Tae-jun smiled ever so slightly, the other side continued.-I\u2019m going crazy trying to figure things out somehow. Mr. Jin, this man, as we expected, has dragged In-bae Lee into the \u2018Star Road\u2019 betting game.\u201cOf course, he will not be able to get the land without Lee In-bae\u2019s power.\u201d\u2018Star Road\u2019 was a large-scale shopping mall project that Yuseong, a mid-sized construction company, was working on in collaboration with Jinseong Construction. Located in the Q area where the complex transfer station was, since the onset, this project was touted as the proverbial \u2018goose that lays golden eggs\u2019. Needless to say, it had garnered a lot of attention.Tae-jun did not miss the point that Star Road was situated around a traditional market. It was obvious that there was bound to be a conflict during the process of doling out the demolition compensation due to poor business registration and lease contracts.Jay had sent out the so-called \u201cnail house*\u201d people to the merchant association in secret. The effect was dramatic. In the form of a \u201cStar Road fire incident\u201d the entire nation was enraged.[*Nail house is a private home whose owner refuses to move to clear way for new real estate developments despite offers of huge monetary sums from a private developer or expropriation attempts by the government.]-What shall we do? Shall we take action right away?\u201cDon\u2019t play the joker yet. It\u2019s no fun finishing the game now.\u201d-It reminds me of our hunting days. What about Yuseong? It\u2019s not the main target, but it\u2019s fallen into the trap.\u201cIt\u2019s too risky to catch it even though it is trapped now. Just focus on the game as planned.\u201d-Ugh, that\u2019s too bad. Speaking of hunting, how about hunting in Canada..it\u2019s been a long time? Bear hunting is the best.\u201cBy all means.\u201dUpon wrapping the call, Tae-jun stubbed out his cigarette. His gaze went back to the Jinseong River outside the window again. Like Jay had asked, tomorrow was indeed his father\u2019s death anniversary.His father was a man who\u2019d abandoned everything for love. The woman his father loved was an orphan sponsored by the Seoin Group and personal secretary to Tae-jun\u2019s grandmother.He\u2019d fallen in love with her since childhood. However, Tae-jun\u2019s grandfather, who was obsessed with mergers through marriage, did not approve of their relationship. He separated the sweethearts through force. His grandfather sent away the woman, leaving his father, \u00a0who did not what had transpired, deeply disappointed.Then, in desperation, his father married his mother and Tae-jun was born. Though it didn\u2019t start with love, their marriage was not bad. They respected one another and did not intrude on personal turf.However, their marriage ended with the return of the woman who was in a wreck. His father, without any hesitation, abandoned everything he had for her. Property, status, family, and in the end, even life. It was a ridiculous clich\u00e9.Tae-jun became\u00a0deeply disillusioned when he recalled his father. He felt the same about the great \u201clove\u201d his father had dedicated to the woman. Tae-jun never meant to follow in his father\u2019s footsteps. The \u201clove\u201d may have been great, but it brought him and his mother nothing but desolation. Had his father never loved him? One day, early in the morning, his father went to the field\u00a0of\u00a0reeds for a walk. He never returned. But it seems he got his answer.It was the first time he\u2019d visited here since his father\u2019s death. On the first anniversary of his death last year, Tae-jun was abroad. However, this time, it\u2019s not clear why he came to this place without stopping by his home as soon as he returned to Korea. He didn\u2019t even contact Jin-wook who\u2019s always by his side.This morning, he had somehow found himself walking along the river. Every time he stepped forward, reeds made a sound. Beyond this field was the villa where his father and his woman had lived together.After his father threw away everything he had and hid in the city of Jinseong, Tae-jun had once come here alone. He was only twelve at the time and could not fully accept his father, who\u2019d on one night, simply disappeared from his life without so much as a word. He did know the reason but from what he heard, it seemed to be because of a woman. He set off in search of his father\u2026 to bring him back.When he found the house they now lived in, his father was away. He saw her for the first time then. The woman, who was so skinny that she was about to fall down, was sitting in a chair in the garden. He was unable to understand why on earth his father loved that woman who was dying. She was far behind when it came to beauty compared to his mother.\u2026Hello?She recognized Tae-jun and was at a loss. He looked at the woman in the eye and spoke.Give me back my father!As soon as his words fell, the woman had an asthma attack. He didn\u2019t know what triggered her, but he assumed that it was because of his eyes that looked just like his grandfather\u2019s.And that day, his father, who came to the emergency room for the woman, slapped his son on the face for the first time. It was the last time he had seen his dad.People said he would come back when the woman died, but he did not return even after 10 years had passed, nor did he find his father anywhere. So, it was the first and last time Tae-jun saw his father as a picture at his funeral.Where Tae-jun stopped walking was quite far from the trail. The water of the lake fluttered in the sun. He was standing at the place where his father jumped in. It was also where only anglers visited.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSadly, his dad was already a long-lost person to the Seoin Group, and the media did not make a hue and cry because the Seo patriarch quickly worked on it to hide things. Chairman Jung-ho Seo dismissed his son\u2019s death as an accident, but his family did not believe him. Neither did they investigate it.After the woman\u2019s death, unable to cope up, his father had relied on psychiatric help. There were witnesses who saw him jump into the river on his own. Without a doubt, Jung-ho must have bought the witnesses\u2019 silence. The truth never saw the light.\u201cBe careful! It\u2019s deep there.\u201dTae-jun turned to where the sharp voice came from. He could see a familiar face.It was the woman whom he met in the room yesterday\u2026Hye-yeon.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Perhaps, it was because he was buried in the workload that he got so attracted to the woman he just met.The way she\u2019d diligently translated Mr. Shin\u2019s sign language was still vivid in his mind.\u201cIwasonmywaytocollectwastepaperandjunkasusual.Theoldman\u2026Imean,thepresidentofthevilla,wasfishing.Ithoughtsobecausehehunganemptyfishingrodtwoorthreetimesaweek.Buttherewasasuddengustofwind.Thewindblewthepresident\u2019shatintothelake.Thishat\u2026It\u2019sacommonthingherebecauseit\u2019scalledthegoblinwind,butsuddenlytheoldmangotuptograbhishat.Hewouldn\u2019thavesteppedonthatdangerousspotifhehadn\u2019tjusttriedto.Itwassosudden\u2026\u201dThroughout the man\u2019s gestured communication, Tae-jun\u2019s gaze never left Mr. Shin\u2019s hat.That hat was given to Tae-jun on his birthday that year before his father left. It was the only hat in the world\u2014custom-made in England.Whyisthehatstillhere?Whydidmyfatherjumpintotherivertocatchthe cap?No,whydidhestillhavethathat?Nomoney,noposition,nowife,noson\u2026butjustthehat.Feeling Tae-jun\u2019s gaze, Shin took off his hat.\u201cIpickeditupafewdayslaterbytheriver.\u201dWhen he was somewhat collected, Tae-jun brought out a check and extended it to Shin. The man\u2019s grateful eyes upon receiving it needed no translation.He didn\u2019t know what was more perplexing\u2014his father who jumped into the river because of this hat, or the man who kept it. One thing was clear, it was comforting as the sound of footsteps of the woman following him.In all his life, no woman had shown him concern, as she did. As a rule, he always chose women who would not give him problems and had a proper relationship. A proper relationship meant a beneficial one.It always started on a high note, rosy and cozy. But as soon as the honeymoon period ended, reality would barge in. Greed, jealousy, possessiveness\u2026 aren\u2019t they the mother of all problems? He hated it when problems arose. No matter who, no matter where, this was typical of women.He had seen how his father had enough problems with women. He had resolved to steer clear from them\u2014women!However, Myung-je Jin\u2019s daughter seemed to be quite the contrary. Well, at least the few times they\u2019d met, seemed to say so. But, now was not the time to delve into this. For it was about time for his interest in that woman to wane slowly.Shortly after, Tae-jun was invited to the opening ceremony of an art center at H Arts University, his mother was the chairperson of the board.\u2e19The H Art College\u2014Mecca of the Korean Art World\u2014seemed to share an interesting bond with the Seo scion. This place, his mother now helmed, was her alma mater too. His aunt, Jung-hee Seo, director of the Seoin Gallery, majored in Oriental painting here.Every year, this institution produced winners of contests and world champions\u2014students making their debut as rookie artists. As such, it was a place of pride as the best art school in Korea.His mother, whom he had not seen for almost half a year, was still an elegant and beautiful woman. A year after his father left home, his mother left home too. It was the divorce of the century; while the whole world was in a shock, his world turned tumultuous.Upon his son\u2019s death, Chairman Jung-ho Seo promised his daughter-in-law and grandson unprecedented wealth and status. Had she been an ordinary woman, she would have just lived, satisfied with her status as the \u201cSeoin Group\u2019s Daughter-in-law.\u201dButshewas the only child of the founder of the art school that produced remarkable talents and educators of different generations. She was a woman of high pride, not someone obsessed with wealth or honor. How could a paltry Seoin Group compare?Eventually, his mother left home after agreeing to his grandfather\u2019s proposal that she had to relinquish all rights related to the Seoin Group. Of course, that included the only \u201cSeo\u201d grandson of Chairman Jung-ho Seo and her prerogative as a mother.Despite it all, Tae-jun neither condemned nor resented his mother\u2019s decision. It was his father who had erred from the beginning, and what came after was his mother\u2019s choice for her life. It didn\u2019t matter if he didn\u2019t feature in it. All in all, in this game of cause and effect, the final winner was abandonment.Since his mother\u2019s departure from the Seo Family and his life, Tae-jun had met her only through formal settings. There was a distance that neither could cross, willing, or not. There was nothing that they had to say to each other. After all, the most sacrosanct bond in the world, mother and child, built upon flesh and blood, was now connected by a mere piece of paper: the certificate of birth.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euOn that day, he left the office early after a round of meetings. When he reached the university area, he made his way towards the event\u2019s location. He saw his mother; she was overseeing the last minute things.Suddenly, she looked in his direction, seemingly wanting to say something to her son. However, it didn\u2019t matter. Just like she had made the choice to abandon her son, he had made a choice for his mother, too.He walked around the venue for a little, looking for a quiet spot to smoke. This newly opened art center boasted artistic symmetry. A lot of thought was put into the building, but its grounds didn\u2019t lack care. As he strolled around the lush landscape that stood as a testimony to the artistic verve, his eyes caught something familiar.Sitting on a bench in the most inconspicuous corner, head buried deep into the sketchbook, delicate fingers wielding the pencil with aplomb, eyes fixated, utterly oblivious to the surroundings was a woman.Such a pristine scene brought two words to his mind\u2026Hye-yeon Jin.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Tae-jun walked towards her as if dragged by force. Her hand continued to hover above the sketchbook until he was standing inches behind her.\u201cHye-yeon.\u201dShe turned towards the low voice resonating above her head. Her eyes widened in surprise at seeing Tae-jun. She soon smiled.\u201cHello, what a surprise running into you here.\u201d Her eyes were clear and bright. Tae-jun felt a commotion in the corner of his heart.\u201cI didn\u2019t know you were a student here.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m on leave at the moment.\u201d\u201cWas your work part of today\u2019s exhibit, by any chance?\u201d Considering the high-profile guests invited to the exhibit, it was an important event for the art students. The guests were their future clients and sponsors.\u201cAlmost.\u201d\u201cAlmost?\u201d He turned his gaze to the sketchbook. Her skills were impressive, even at a quick glance. Rather than answering his question, she handed him the beer can. His cigarette smoke was bothering her. At her firm gaze, Tae-jun reluctantly took the cigarette out of his mouth and discarded it to the can. Satisfied, she threw the can into a trash bin.\u201cIt\u2019s a long story.\u201d\u201cThe kind of story that made you drink alone in the middle of the day?\u201d\u201cAre you always this curious about other people\u2019s private lives? And why are you so informal with me? We\u2019re not at the hotel anymore.\u201dLook at this!Tae-jun scoffed and replied, \u201cThat makes us even, don\u2019t you think? You\u2019re the one who started. You can go ahead and be rude to me if you\u2019d like.\u201dShe stared at him as though dumbfounded. He fixed his gaze upon her eyes. He suddenly felt a wave of a nausea-like sensation. Something shook violently within, and she permeated into his jolted heart. It was an intense attraction that he had never experienced before.\u201cWell\u2026\u201d As soon as she parted her lips, her cell phone rang. She glanced at the caller ID and closed the sketchbook.\u201cI have to go.\u201d She staggered as she put her heels on and got up from the ground. Tae-jun held her arm to steady her. A shiver ran down his spine the moment he grasped her slender limb.\u201cAh, thank you.\u201dA burning sensation spread, from the fingertips that touched her to the rest of his body. He felt unbearably thirsty.What is this?Tae-jun stood and stared down at his hand for a while and turned toward the direction in which she had left.He saw her walking away with a man. He felt an ache in his heart as he watched her smile at him.At this moment, Tae-jun did not care. Whether this feeling was love or lust, he was going insane in his desire for her. He wanted to make her his, and only his.<b><\u2014 Flashback Ends \u2014></b>He dreamed that he made love to the woman.She said she was Hye-yeon, but she was not Hye-yeon.He took his time with her. He relished the moments in which she clung to him with a gaze filled with ecstasy. Wrapped in his arms, she always received him with such softness.They had been well suited from the beginning, and the more he tamed her, she continued to fit him even better.He adored her madly, so much so that he could not imagine being with any other woman.\u201cHa\u2026\u201d A sweet moan oozed out of her mouth. Tae-jun took out the finger that had been deposited deep inside her. The red flesh twitched and expelled liquid down his finger. He slowly licked his hand. It was fragrant and sweet. It was as if she was a fruit, given to him for his consumption only.Something that was his only, something that only he could have.Tae-jun spread her legs and inserted himself. As he entered all the way in, without even an inch of room, she twisted herself slightly. He squeezed her waist and thrust into her repeatedly.As he moved faster, she began emitting a sobbing noise. He felt as if all her parts were musical instruments, producing sound at his touch.

She drew the curtains aside, letting the sunlight stream in and fill the room.It was the first time in a while that she had had a dream involving anyone other than \u2018him\u2019. The dream was about Hye-yeon. She had tried to reach Hye-yeon when she was in the US, but both her cell phone and home numbers had been disconnected. Hye-yeon\u2019s social media accounts, which she had often used to upload pictures, were inactive. Yuri was curious to know how she was doing.Noting the time, Yuri called her uncle in New York. By now he would have closed the restaurant for the night.\u201cUncle, it\u2019s me, Yuri. Are you busy?\u201d\u201cNo, we\u2019re just winding down now. Are you okay? What\u2019s going on?\u201dHer uncle was, in addition to being her mother\u2019s brother, her father\u2019s best friend. Her father had fallen in love with his friend\u2019s younger sister at first sight, and started visiting his shop every single day. For that reason her uncle was particularly devoted to his orphaned niece. Without his material and emotional support, it would have been impossible for Yuri to survive.\u201cOf course I\u2019m doing well. It\u2019s nothing special, but I wanted to ask where my dad\u2019s ashes are kept. I\u2019d like to visit while I\u2019m in Korea. It\u2019s somewhere in Jinseong, right?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea,\u201d he responded with firmness in his voice. Early in her treatment, when Davis had suggested that she visit the places associated with her past, her uncle had fiercely opposed it. He had not wanted Yuri to take this trip to Korea, either.Yuri did not understand. \u201cWhy? Why shouldn\u2019t I\u2026\u201dHer uncle emitted a long sigh. After a moment of silence, he began with a low voice, \u201cThere\u2019s something that I haven\u2019t been able to tell you, considering how sick you were feeling\u2026 Actually, last time you were there you went missing for ten days.\u201d\u201cWent\u2026missing?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know the details, either, since you had already disappeared when I heard about your dad\u2019s accident and managed to get to Korea. I searched all over for you while I arranged the funeral, and some strange men came looking for you. They threatened me not to do anything stupid. Some of them were police officers.\u201dHer head began to spin. She gripped her phone tight. Her uncle continued the story.\u201cI couldn\u2019t bear to stay there, so I went to Seoul as soon as the funeral was done. Just in case, I gave my contact information and the name of my hotel to your friend. I think her name was Hye-yeon Jin? And a week later, very late at night, you showed up looking like a mess, and fainted right away. When you came to, you had already forgotten all about what had happened.\u201dA long silence lingered. She had never heard this before.\u201cAnyway you shouldn\u2019t go to Jinseong. Please don\u2019t go there, Yuri,\u201d her uncle repeated his plea as if casting a spell. Yuri\u2019s mind felt like a tangled mess.Getting off the phone, she stared into her reflection in the vanity mirror.What on earth has happened to me?Apparently it all began with those \u2018missing ten days\u2019.She remembered calling her uncle about her father\u2019s accident, but recalling what happened next was the problem. As she closed her eyes and tried to drag out the memory in any way possible, she began hearing a ringing in her ears. It was a warning siren that appeared every time she attempted to break the seal of her memory. She ignored the warning, which made it only louder and imposed intolerable pain in her head. She stumbled and steadied herself against a wall.It\u2019s no use. She had to find a better way of going about this. She searched through her uncle\u2019s account for clues. The person to whom he had given his contact information. The person whom she must have met at the end of her \u2018missing ten days\u2019.I need to find Hye-yeon.She might know what had happened during these ten days. Determined, Yuri went to the bus terminal and bought a ticket to Jinseong. Her uncle\u2019s warning lingered in her ears and made her heart sink.The situation felt similar to the beginning of a horror film that she had seen. The heroine had gone to the village that she wasn\u2019t supposed to visit. What happened to her? Did she die, or escape?Yuri sat in the bus to Jinseong and looked out the window. She remembered the day she had returned to the city after dropping out of university. She had sat alone in a corner seat of the bus and cried, as scathing sunshine streamed through the window and the bus rattled along.Memories are strange. How could she remember small things like that, but forget all about the important ones?Yuri hailed a cab at the bus terminal in Jinseong.\u201cJinseong Hotel, please.\u201dThe gray-haired driver glanced at Yuri through the rearview mirror. \u201cYou mean, the hotel that used be Jinseong Hotel?\u201d\u201cSorry?\u201d\u201cThat place is called \u2018Seo-in Hotel\u2019 now.\u201dSurprise spread across her face. The city\u2019s landmark hotel had closed down? What happened Mr. Jin? And to Hye-yeon?She turned her eyes to the view outside the cab window, trying to contain the chaos brewing in her chest. The city had changed vastly in five short years. Large new buildings had replaced the old ones, and the run-down market had been transformed into a clean shopping center.Stopped at the red light for a moment, the driver asked Yuri, \u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you were here?\u201dYuri counted the number of years since the last visit that she could remember. \u201cAbout five years, I think.\u201d\u201cAh, of course you\u2019re surprised, then. It\u2019s really changed since, right?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cYes. It really has changed a lot.\u201d\u201cI think it was three or four years ago? Things started developing after Seo-in Hotel opened. More shops came in, and young people started moving here. We get a lot of foreigners here, too. And there\u2019s a rumor that they\u2019re opening a casino here soon.\u201dYuri nodded and listened to his story.The cab soon arrived at the hotel. She was amazed by its exterior. The hotel that she remembered was nowhere to be seen. Its fa\u00e7ade, decorated with black marble, was impressive to the intimidating degree.She approached the front desk, but Hye-yeon was not there. Only employees dressed in fancy uniforms greeted her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Luxurious lighting, exuberant d\u00e9cor\u2026 guests accoutred. There were no families or tourist groups in hiking gear. All around, there were just\u2026 foreigners. It was as though she had got off the cab and into an utterly different world.Overcome by a nauseating sensation of racing through time after a long state of suspension, she ran out to the street.She was breathing heavily, trying to gather her bearings. As she looked around her\u2026 she could recognize a brick nor tree. Everything had changed. The place, the people\u2026 the air. Nothing felt the same any more. Just when she was on the brink of feeling hopeless\u2026 something caught her eye.Standing tall, swaying in a rhythm of its own, on the river bank were the once all too familiar reeds. At long last, a welcome sight!A blithe smile graced her lips as she walked on the dry grass allowing the blades to caress her as they wished. She took a deep breath and looked towards the sky, the glistening water\u2026 her heart started to settle. Slowly, she went along the path behind the hotel and across the field. She was happy to find the same old shortcut leading to the residential neighborhood still waiting for her. Her steps finally came to a halt upon reaching the largest independent house in the area: the Villa President\u2019s abode.She stood at the street corner and gazed at the house. Thankfully it was just as she remembered. The wooden gate\u2026 the high walls, it was all still the same. This was one of those places that held fond memories. Her father used to wash the car in front of the house.She stopped herself short of excitedly ringing the doorbell. After all, the nameplate at the door had changed. She quickly came to her senses and chided herself for losing her composure.Of course, the hotel wouldn\u2019t be the only one with new owners!What\u2019s she thinking!!!No wonder I haven\u2019t been able to reach her.She swallowed the bitterness brewing within and looked around the neighborhood. She reminded herself about the purpose of her visit. She deliberated over what to do next as she slowly trudged away.Where could she find Hye-yeon? Should she go back to the hotel, and see if she could find anyone from the Hotel Jinseong days? Perhaps, she could go into stores and ask about Mr. Jin? Anyone living in Jinseong would know him\u2026While she was lost in her musings, she heard someone call out to her.\u201cYuri? It\u2019s you, isn\u2019t it?\u201dShe turned towards the voice and was surprised by what she saw. Although it was difficult to make out her face in the glare of sunlight, it was definitely Hyeon-ah Kim from the old hotel.Hyeon-ah smiled happily. \u201cI heard you were in Korea and knew you would visit. It\u2019s been a while!\u201dYuri hesitated at the warm welcome of her old acquaintance. She was happy to see her, but something was off.How did she know that I was in Korea?\u201cCome in, this is my place.\u201dHyeon-ah led Yuri to a small caf\u00e9 near the hotel. It was bustling even at this time of the day, a sign that business was doing well. It appeared to turn into a bar in the evenings. Yuri looked around its small interior while her host prepared coffee.Hyeon-ah was different from how she remembered her. She had never seen her with this much makeup before. Her straight black hair had been replaced by a beautiful brown, wavy one. Her previously short nails were now long and manicured, and instead of a clean-cut suit, she was wearing a tight dress that perilously showed off her cleavage.\u201cSo you don\u2019t work at the hotel anymore?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. They cleaned the house when the new owners came in. First, they moved me from the front desk to the kitchen, and then to the laundry room. I couldn\u2019t handle it. The manager is still holding on, though.\u201d As she spoke, she sat opposite Yuri with two cups of coffee and lit a cigarette in her mouth.Seeing the surprise on Yuri\u2019s face, she said as if explaining herself, \u201cOh, this? I started when I opened this place.\u201dFor some inexplicable reason, the smoke made Yuri\u2019s heart race. Even so, she asked in the calmest voice that she could muster, \u201cHow\u2019s the business?\u201d\u201cWhen I first left the hotel I was at a loss about what I should do to feed myself. But turns out I\u2019m really good at this stuff. I had learned a lot at the hotel, too. It was pretty hard at first but thankfully things are stable now. I even have some regulars. How\u2019ve you been?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been living with my uncle in the US.\u201d\u201cAnd what do you do these days? Still painting?\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019m still working in the art industry. I\u2019m in Korea on business.\u201d\u201cSo you\u2019re going back to the US?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m leaving in three days.

Yuri took a deep breath and shed all pretences.\u201cHow did you know that I was in the country?\u201dHyeon-ah slightly raised a corner of her mouth and put out the cigarette.\u201cA man came to see me\u2026 With a recent picture of you.\u201d She was forthright with her reply.\u201cWhat picture?\u201d\u201cIt looked like it was from a CCTV footage. You had your hair up in a ponytail, wearing a trench coat.\u201d Hyeon-ah walked over to the counter as she talked and fetched something. It was a business card\u2013 gold-colored text printed on black paper.<Jin-wook Jeong, President, J Consulting>Yuri had never heard of the man or the company before.\u201cI\u2019m not familiar with him.\u201d\u201cI figured. He claimed to be some kind of consultant but he was suspicious as hell. He was about fifty, his eyes looked incredibly sharp. My guess is he\u2019s ex: police or military.\u201dHaving spent years at the hotel front desk, Hyeon-ah had a keen eye for people. One glance, and she could read them like a book. This skill was very handy in dealing with the guests then as it was now.Yuri carefully inspected the card. She read and re-read the name and other details. She\u2019d a gnawing feeling within, but she couldn\u2019t put a finger on it.Sensing her misgivings, her friend decided to put her at ease.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I didn\u2019t have a good feeling about it either, so I just told him that I didn\u2019t know you.\u201d\u201cCan I take the card with me?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cYeah, go ahead.

For a brief moment, the crisp shattering of porcelain fractured the gaiety of the caf\u00e9. Even so, the source of interruption was oblivious to it all.Who could blame her?Still unaware of the wreckage she\u2019d created on the floor, a flustered and pale Yuri asked, \u201cHye\u2026 Hye-yeon is\u2026dead?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You\u2019re looking white as a sheet. \u201dHyeon-ah\u2019s voice felt strangely distant. Yuri shook off Hyeon-ah\u2019s hand trying to hold her steady, and stumbled out of the caf\u00e9. She was floating in a dreamlike state, as if her brain had melted. Her head refused to think. She moved mechanically for some time and finally came to her senses at the lobby of Hotel Seoin. It was unclear how she had managed to take the bus back to Seoul.Why am I here?Yuri slowly inspected her surroundings, blinking. Sounds from all around her, which had been blocked as if the speaker had been turned off, suddenly rushed in at once and crashed into her eardrums. Her sensations, previously disappeared, returned.This was not the first time that she had moved around in an unconscious state. It had been happening frequently since she had lost her memory. She would wander the boundaries between reality and fantasy, as if she was looking for something, sometimes running away. Each time, she had done something that she could no longer remember, or found herself in an unexpected place.But why this hotel, when she had canceled the reservation a few days before? What was she supposed to find here?Was this because the image of the new Hotel Seoin in Jin-seong had left such a strong impression? And who was the man that was going around and looking for her? Jin-wook Jeong from J Consulting\u2013who was he? Was he related to the people who had threatened her uncle?She suddenly noticed the CCTV camera hanging at a corner of the ceiling, and recalled what Hyeon-ah had said.It looked like it was from a CCTV footage. You had your hair up in a ponytail, wearing a trench coat.That must have been her first day back in Korea.Was the footage from here? She peered up at the camera.How had the man obtained a copy of the footage?She knew, from her days working at Hotel Jinseong, that it was not easy to get one\u2019s hands on the lobby surveillance footage. An upscale place like Hotel Seoin would require a warrant from the police.That man must be an insider here. A shiver ran down her back. Perhaps she was being filmed right now.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euYuri took a step towards the exit. At that instance, the floor sloshed and things began spinning in front of her. Her knees gave out and she dropped to the floor. She felt the impact against the surface and began hearing the murmurs of the crowd around her.\u201cAre you okay, miss?\u201d Urgent footsteps stopped next to her and a man\u2019s voice echoed. The world in front of her swayed up and down and nauseated her. She wanted to say that it was nothing, that she was all right, but it was difficult for her to even breathe.\u201cYuri? Yuri Han? Are you all right?\u201d She managed to regain composure at the sound of a familiar voice. A tall man with light brown hair, slightly drooping eyes, and firm hands. Jae-won raised her upright from the floor.\u201cJae-won?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, Yuri. We meet again.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

We have a nearby physician on retainer. She can be here in five minutes. Wait here.\u201d Jae-won produced a cell phone from his jacket. Yuri shook her head.\u201cNo, please. I\u2019m really fine. I don\u2019t need a doctor.\u201dSeeing her frantic face, he put the phone back into his pocket. He led her to a sofa.\u201cPlease wait here just for a moment,\u201d he said in a stern voice and disappeared. Yuri tried to move while he was gone, but her muscles were devoid of energy. Why am I feeling so weak? That\u2019s when she realized that all she had eaten all day was the coffee from Hyeon-ah\u2019s caf\u00e9.\u201cHere, drink this.\u201d Jae-won suddenly rematerialized and handed her an open bottle of water. Feeling grateful and thirsty, Yuri brought the bottle to her lips. She felt a small relief as the cold water traveled down her throat.Seeing the half-empty bottle, Jae-won asked again, \u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t need me to call the doctor?\u201d\u201cYes. Thank you so much for your help.\u201d She was still feeling weak, but thankfully the dizziness and nausea had disappeared. She would start getting better once she had a chance to return to her room, take her medication, and rest.Yuri gave him a slight nod, \u201cThanks again for this. I\u2019ll be going now.\u201dBut Jae-won stood up in front of her. \u201cWhere are you headed? Let me drive you.\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m totally fine. I don\u2019t want to be a nuisance.\u201dJae-won would not back down. \u201cIt would be a nuisance for you to just walk out in your state. I\u2019d be so worried about you for the rest of the evening, that I won\u2019t be able to get anything done.\u201dThe parking attendant had already brought Jae-won\u2019s car to the lobby entrance. Jae-won opened the passenger-side door for Yuri. \u201cGet in.\u201dYuri reluctantly climbed in. Seated at the wheel, Jae-won asked, \u201cWhere to?\u201dShe named the hotel where she was staying. He entered it into the navigation system and started the car. A calm piano music streamed out of the speakers.As though mindful of Yuri\u2019s weak state, he refrained from talking too much. She sat with her eyes closed, feeling the silence that wasn\u2019t entirely uncomfortable.They had arrived at the cross-section near her hotel when she opened her eyes.\u201cActually, I\u2019ve been meaning to reach out to you,\u201d Jae-won started.\u201cTo me?\u201d\u201cAh, I guess you haven\u2019t heard from the agency yet. Director Yoon told me that you are Roy Chang\u2019s assistant. My team is planning on acquiring one of his pieces for the hotel lobby, so I thought I\u2019d ask you a few questions.\u201dFor the first time that day she pictured the emails and messages that must have been piling up on her phone. Normally she would check them as soon as they came in, but she could hardly think about those today.\u201cWould you be interested in getting dinner with me?\u201d Jae-won added.She accepted after a moment of hesitation. She was starting to feel hungry anyway. Jae-won flashed a pleasant smile.\u201cLet me suggest the menu. There\u2019s a great place not so far from here.\u201dJae-won took her to a traditional Korean-style house with a gracious, vintage exterior. He led her inside while she marveled at finding such a house in the middle of the city. A woman clad in a semi-traditional dress greeted them at the entrance with a delighted face.\u201cDirector Lee, it\u2019s been a while.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have a reservation, but would it be possible to get a table?\u201d\u201cYes, of course.\u201d The woman guided them to the annex. Treading on the beautiful steppingstones on the garden path, Yuri pondered about the title that the woman had used to call Jae-won.This man who works at Seo-in Hotel. Given his proximity to Shi-yeon she had figured that the two would be on similar levels, but she was surprised to learn that he was so high-ranking.\u201cYou\u2019re dining with a beautiful lady this evening.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll try to come more often.\u201d\u201cI\u2019d be so grateful, sir. I haven\u2019t seen Director Yoon since she became engaged.\u201d\u201cShe seems rather busy these days.\u201dYuri took in the view of the garden outside the window while Jae-won chatted with the owner. A pond was situated in the middle of the garden, next to a small pavilion. They were nestled among expensive viewing stones and old pine trees. This was not an ordinary restaurant for ordinary people.\u201cIs there anything you can\u2019t eat?\u201dYuri turned her gaze to Jae-won and shook her head. \u201cNo, I can eat anything.\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019ll order the chef\u2019s tasting menu.\u201d Jae-won motioned to the owner. \u201cWe\u2019ll do the usual. It would be great if you could serve everything at once. I skipped lunch and am about to starve to death.\u201d\u201cCertainly, sir.\u201dOnce the owner left the room, Yuri sat face-to-face with Jae-won and began, \u201cHow do you know Director Yoon?\u201d\u201cAh, she\u2019s a friend. We go way back. And soon she\u2019s going to be family, too.\u201d\u201cFamily?\u201d\u201cYes, she\u2019s engaged to my cousin.

The large table was soon filled with clean and beautiful fare.\u201cWould you like anything to drink, sir?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m all right. Yuri, would you like something?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m okay as well.\u201d\u201cPlease enjoy your meal.\u201d The server left the room and closed the door. Jae-won attentively encouraged her to eat.\u201cPlease go ahead.\u201d He took a piece of savory pancake and placed it on the plate in front of Yuri. Whether it was due to her hunger, or the chef\u2019s skills, everything was absolutely delicious. Yuri was honestly impressed.\u201cThey do a great job here.\u201d\u201cRight? The owner\u2019s family has been running the place for three generations. I\u2019m here pretty often. Please have as much as you want.\u201dJae-won comfortably led the conversation, occasionally recommending dishes for Yuri to try. He asked about the piece that his team was looking to buy, and she answered to the best of her knowledge. His experience in the hospitality industry had extensively trained him in table and conversation manners.\u201cHow\u2019s New York these days?\u201dJae-won had spent most of his childhood in the US, and knew New York City very well. He would still visit a few times a year, to see his brother who lived there. The conversation naturally became focused on the city. Amazingly, his brother\u2019s apartment was very close to Roy Chang\u2019s studio. Jae-won seemed surprised when Yuri mentioned this.\u201cI\u2019ve always been curious about that building, since it has such a unique exterior. I had no idea it was his studio. Does it by any chance also serve as a gallery? I\u2019d love to come visit.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. It has some of Roy\u2019s work, as well as some pieces by his assistants.

Seeing her hesitation, he added, \u201cDon\u2019t feel pressured. I just want us to be friends. Please, I\u2019m starting to feel a little embarrassed here.\u201dYuri reluctantly took the card from his hand.\u201cI may not have a chance to call you before I go.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s okay.\u201d He smiled gently. She gave him a polite nod and went into the hotel. What a long day this had been. Yuri dropped to the floor as soon as she entered her room.***Tae-jun buried himself deep in the seat of his car, feeling as if all sensations in his body were being focused on one thing, as vivid as the perception of a hunter who finally re-encountered, after a few days of waiting, a prey that he had lost. He could barely contain the excitement that brewed in his body ever since he had been informed of Hye-seong Jin\u2019s capture.Instead of pulling the trigger of his shotgun, the hunter clasped his hands together and closed his eyes.Jin-seong Construction. It had been one of the top fifty construction firms in the country, built upon the reputation of Jin-seong Hotel and the influence wielded by Jin-seong\u2019s mayor, In-bae Lee.Tae-jun had lusted after Jin-seong Hotel. This was when Seo-in Group was devoting itself to its hospitality business, in an attempt to rid itself of the foul reputation from its beginnings as a weapons company. He needed to absorb Jin-seong Hotel, the key tourist landmark in the region.But Myeong-je Jin, a man who had gotten his start in a local gang, was not the type of person you could talk things out with. The negotiations had gone down the drain. The only remaining option was to exercise force. Tae-jun and Jay came up with a plot to destroy Jin-seong Construction. Their target was the Star Road Shopping Mall project, Jin-seong Construction\u2019s collaboration with Yu-seong Corporation.Jay managed to win over the shop owners at the open-air market, on whose land the shopping mall was supposed to be built. The shop owners refused to sell the land under his orchestration, while Tae-jun put pressure on the finance industry and successfully limited the cash flow into Jin-seong\u2019s project.Unable to handle the debts snowballing due to the delay in construction, Jin-seong Construction ended up setting fire to the market where some shop owners were still holding out in protest. Ten or so people were killed or injured. The Jin-seong gang and the construction company were tried in the court of public opinion.Jin-seong construction\u2019s downfall followed according to Tae-jun\u2019s plan. Mr. Jin had invested everything in Star Road, including In-bae Lee\u2019s election funds, and he was desperate enough to sell the hotel to make up the losses. And when he finally did, he also sold a woman pretending to be his daughter as part of the deal.Tae-jun slowly opened his eyes.At first he thought a year would be enough. Enough time for him to satisfy whatever it was that he was feeling\u2013possessiveness or perhaps simple lust\u2013and get tired of her and leave without regrets. He had had actresses, models, and even women from upper-class families at his side, and a year had always been enough. In some cases it was too long.So he did not understand why he lusted after Yuri more intensely the more he had her. He did not have the capacity to understand his own heart, which was continuing to react with such force after four years.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe car arrived at Jay\u2019s vacation house after two hours or so. The house was perfect for secretive or unseemly business, isolated from the quiet village nearby. Jin-wook and his men were waiting for him.The men recognized Tae-jun and bowed their heads. Jin-wook, who was standing at the entrance, approached him and reported, \u201cHe was in Incheon, trading US dollars against Russian sailors, the Chinese, and Korean-Chinese.

The boy was a literary sort, having studied Russian literature at university, and was obsessed with Tolstoy. The author\u2019s emphasis on mercy, pacifism, and self-control probably had made him resent and shun his father\u2019s work at one point. Not that he had managed to escape the path that his father had taken.You can\u2019t run from your bloodline. Tae-jun saw his own reflection on the glass cupboard in the hallway. Perhaps this applied to him as well. Not being able to avoid his father\u2019s fate, of letting women drive him insane.He wiped the smirk off his face and walked into the living room, where a pale, skinny man was sitting with an anxious look on his face.Seeing Tae-jun, the man bounded up from his seat. \u201cTae-jun Seo! It was you who dragged me here?\u201dTae-jun spotted \u2018relief\u2019 in the sea of emotions wavering in the man\u2019s eyes. Relief? How funny.\u201cSo I\u2019m guessing that there are others who are trying to find you.\u201dHye-seong flinched, as if Tae-jun had read his thoughts. But he soon began bluffing. \u201cThat\u2019s none of your business. So, why were you looking for me?\u201dInstead of replying, Tae-jun sat on the sofa across the room from Hye-seong. Jin-wook ordered his men to leave the room and closed the door. Hye-seong glanced at Jin-wook, who was standing at the door, and Tae-jun, who was seated in front of him. He awkwardly sat himself back down. Tae-jun sized him up from head to toe. He was much thinner than Tae-jun had remembered, somehow radiating a precarious atmosphere.He did change a bit, Tae-jun thought to himself. Hye-seong Jin had always had a rather weak look about him. But looks really must not be everything, given the magnitude of what he had done, daring to sell a stand-in to Tae-jun.Hye-seong began with an uneasy face, \u201cMr. Seo, I can\u2019t think of a reason for us to meet like this.\u201d\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Tae-jun scoffed, bringing a cigarette to his mouth. He had instructed Jin-wook to simply bring Hye-seong here, and not to provide any explanation.Hye-seong still pretended not to know anything, \u201cMy sister is dead, and Jin-seong Construction went bankrupt. And you took away all that was left of the company. So what more do you want from me?\u201d\u201cHye-yeon was dead, which meant that there was no reason for me to be lenient with Jin-seong Construction, right?\u201d Tae-jun exhaled a long trail of cigarette smoke. Unable to understand, Hye-seong furrowed his eyebrows.\u201cWho was that girl?\u201d A sudden question, intermingled with the gray smoke.\u201cWhat girl?\u201d Hye-seong was not getting it, as if the smoke had slowed down his brain.\u201cThe girl that you and your father sold to me. I know she wasn\u2019t your sister.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026what the hell do you mean?\u201d Hye-seong asked, his countenance turning blue.With a crashing sound, Tae-jun violently kicked the table. Hye-seong recoiled in surprise.\u201cThe fact that I\u2019m sitting here with you means that I know everything. You\u2019d better not try to trick me again. If I had my way, I would skin you alive.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s try this again. Who was this Yuri Han?\u201d It was difficult for Hye-seong to fathom why Tae-jun was asking this, when he apparently knew everything already. But it was also difficult not to answer. Without any choice, he began, \u201c\u2026the chauffeur\u2019s daughter. My sister\u2019s friend.\u201d\u201cAnd?\u201d\u201cAnd what? I just told you.\u201d\u201cWhat you gave her in return for standing in for your sister.\u201dHye-seong closed his mouth. Tae-jun slowly put out the cigarette against the ashtray.\u201cI\u2019m asking you again. What did you give her in return?\u201d\u201cWhy would you\u2026\u201d\u201cDo you need some help remembering?\u201d Tae-jun signaled to Jin-wook, who put his hand into the inside pocket of his jacket, flashing a handgun.How could someone carry something like that here, in South Korea? This isn\u2019t the US, or Russia. Then Hye-seong remembered that Seo-in Holdings was a weapons company that produced firearms. They were the first to create the first privately sponsored shooting team, and each year they donated a considerable amount of money to the shooting sport federation.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAnd the man sitting in front of him was a noted marksman, who had won a gold medal at the Asian Games. He was the man who had the easiest access to guns in the country.\u201cMoney!\u201d Hye-seong shouted desperately. \u201cDamn it, it was money.\u201dHye-seong was confident that he had seen a wide range of people, especially those classified as unsavory, since he was a child. But the energy that was emanating from this man was much more dangerous than he had ever felt from anyone else. It was as if Tae-jun\u2019s entire body was about to produce a cold blade and cut into Hye-seong.\u201cMoney.\u201d This was not the answer that Tae-jun was looking for. He took out another cigarette and tapped the filter against the table. He slowly brought it to his lips and lit.Tae-jun\u2019s outline became blurry behind the rising smoke. As Hye-seong closed one eye in a grimace, a hand emerged from the smoke and seized him by the collar.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It!\u201d Tae-jun spat out word by word through gritted teeth.\u201cWhy\u2026\u201d There was some disbelief in the voice.\u201cHad she asked, I would have given her a lot more!\u201dIt was as if he was sledgehammered. Hye-seong went numb all over, his lips went dry. Deep inside, he knew how ruthless a man Tae-jun was. To say he was a devil personified, would be an understatement. His instincts were screaming to him: to survive, he had to tell the truth!He licked his parched lips, then looked squarely at the other. \u201cI heard it directly from Yuri.\u201dTae-jun took a drag deep into his lungs. Nicotine soothed his mind. He was able to make better decisions under the influence. He gazed at the man with measured eyes.Could he believe this man\u2019s words?\u201cThe Yuri Han I knew wasn\u2019t interested in money. She had no desire for materialistic things.\u201d He countered.He was clearer than anyone about the kind of woman she was. Money? Ha! That woman was wooden; no matter how expensive the gift, it would never evoke so much as a glint in her eyes, let alone a smile! What\u2019s more, when she had actually disappeared, all she brought along was her small handbag. The jewels, bags, even cards, and cash, she\u2019d left them all behind.But she sold herself for money?\u201cYes, that\u2019s what Yuri was\u2026 originally. But you ruined it all!\u201dAbruptly, unable to contain himself, Hye-seong lashed out.He remembered Yuri all too well. Pretty, shining like a gem\u2026 he had first seen her when she had first moved into the staff quarters in their premises with her father.He knew her better than anyone else, for she was that woman who would be standing right next to him now, if only his father, President Myung-je Jin, had not been infatuated with an unspeakable offer by Tae-jun.Thatone offer\u2026 ruined everything!\u201cBecause of me?

No, it wouldn\u2019t have happened if you hadn\u2019t been looking at her in the first place! My father didn\u2019t suggest anything to her! She never went to you on her own!\u201dTae-jun glared at the man coldly. The image of a man walking side by side with Yuri Han struck him.I see. This guy, he liked her. Because of his father\u2019s coercion, he lost Yuri to me! She was also his sister\u2019s friend.\u201cStop talking nonsense! Your father should have told me. The woman I wanted was Yuri Han, not Hye-yeon Jin. Of course, that meant the Hotel Jinseong sale deal would not go through.

Why does it feel like there\u2019s something more to it? A sense of incompatibility that is hard to pinpoint\u2026Tae-jun thought.Tae-jun started grilling again.\u201cWhat a coincidence! Do you know where Yuri Han is now?\u201d\u201c\u2026 I heard she went to America.

That\u2019s how he\u2019d felt from the moment he\u2019d first met Yuri, a middle school student, and lived in the same house. The voice that had shattered the belief that one day she would be his bride was cruel.\u201cI need some money.\u201d\u201cMoney? You, are you kidding me? You\u2019re gonna do that for money?

It looked like she had forsaken everyone\u2026 even hope\u2026A desperate Hye-seong roughly shook her soft shoulders, as if doing so would wake her up.

The next moment, a tremendous shock hit his left shoulder. When he looked down, he saw a scarlet spot steadily growing bigger.It was not until a few seconds after that Hye-seong realized Jin-wook had shot him.\u201cAhhhhhh!\u201dHye-seong rolled on the floor screaming. Hot blood spurted and the fireball seemed to poke his shoulders.Tae-jun lit a fresh cigarette, looking down at the man squirming and rolling on the floor with impassive eyes. The cigarette smoke rose from his long fingers, adding to the haze.Hye-seong gritted his teeth and glared at Tae-jun.\u201cI can\u2019t believe you asked him to shoot me!\u201d\u201cI made it clear not to test my patience.\u201dTae-jun smiled. Then he flicked the cigarette ash over Hye-seong\u2019s wound.SCREAM!Once the shrieks died, Tae-jun squatted.\u201cThe damage won\u2019t be serious, no need to worry.

His words were like a thunderbolt.\u201cYou have to admit she\u2019s the best\u2026 given this whole ruse she pulled off. Are you going to bring her in too\u2026 and shoot her?\u201dIt\u2019s a question that was not worthy of an answer. Tae-jun walked without looking back. But as he exited the villa, his face hardened.Was it really money?Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euIt had all been obvious, staring him in the face. But he refused to see it.Firstly, he\u2019d asked President Myung-je Jin to bring the woman as bait for money.

Bang!A barrage of bullets continuously hit the bull\u2019s eye.The man deftly reloaded his shotgun after he hit the last target. He\u2019d lost track of time, soon his shirt under the bulletproof vest was soaked in sweat.You, what if you find Yuri Han?His ears were covered with ear protectors, blocking all sounds, even that of his own heartbeat. And yet, Hye-seong\u2019s words resonated, drumming his senses.He was determined to find Yuri ever since he\u2019d seen her in the hotel lobby, not once had he considered what he would do after. Well, at the moment he was oblivious to this subterfuge. But now, things were different.As regards the question, first, he\u2019s going to ask why she lied to him, why she left, and\u2026No one has deceived you like she did. Don\u2019t you think so?Right, Yuri will pay the price.When he\u2019s changing his heated-up gun barrel, Jin-wook took the opportunity to pass him a bottle of water. It didn\u2019t escape his sharp eyes, that the other was drenched in sweat.\u201cYou haven\u2019t lost your touch. You are still as good as active athletes.\u201d He admired this man\u2019s skills whole-heartedly.Shooting, as a sport form, has a range of sub-disciplines; trapshooting being one of them. Here, one is required to shoot saucer-shaped clay targets flung into the air from a spring device called trap. Needless to say, this demands dynamic visual acuity and exceptional focus.Tae-jun was nineteen when he won gold for trapshooting in the Asian Games. As such, the majority of his youth had been spent as a part of the Junior National Team, but the Asian Games was the swansong of his career as an athlete. His grandfather did not want Tae-jun catching the public eye anymore, nor did Tae-jun. However, to retain his firearms license, he maintained his athlete qualification.Tae-jun took off his protection glasses while he downed the water. Both men stood in silence for a while.\u201cWhat about Hye-seong Jin?\u201d Tae-jun gazed into the distance as he asked.\u201cI put him in Dr. Yang\u2019s clinic, nice and neat.\u201d Jin-wook replied.Only a day had passed. For Tae-jun, time seemed to be dragging, there was nothing he could except endure. But it was proving to be hard.Laying his gun on the table, Tae-jun drew out a cigarette. As he lit it, his phone rang. It was Jay.\u2013 \u201cHello!\u201d\u201cDid you find her?\u201d\u2013 \u201cWow! Do you know how many Koreans live in New York City?\u201d\u201cCall me when you find her.\u201d\u2013 Wait, wait! You need to let me finish.

He ran his fingers through his hair, starting to get impatient.\u201cAnswer my questions now. Did you find out anything about Yuri Han?\u201d\u2013 As of now, she lives in the East Village. She\u2019s not married and lives with her uncle. Oh, by the way, her uncle is quite big in the Korean Community here. He runs two big restaurants. Her aunt is from here and is a well-known Human Rights Lawyer. They seem like a power couple.\u201d\u201cWhat does Yuri do for a living?\u201d\u2013 \u201cShe is an artist affiliated with an agency.

But that\u2019s not important.\u201dThen, Jay lowered his voice.\u2013 \u201cUm\u2026 There\u2019s a rumor about her, and it\u2019s not nice.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u2013 \u201cPeople say that she has mental problems. She\u2019s attempted suicide a few times already.\u201dYuri tried to take her own life!She even has psychological problems?!Tae-jun\u2019s heart thumped frantically, his eyes betrayed his anxiety albeit for a moment, while his mind raced to make sense of this information.She seemed to be living a nice life in the Big Apple. She had a family, her uncle seemed like a nice man for he took her in. She\u2019s talented with a stable job and a bright future. The way he saw it, there should be no reason to attempt suicide.\u201cDo you know why?\u201d\u2013 Nobody knows why except for the doctors. Her psychiatrist is an authority in the PTSD field.\u201dTae-jun took a deep drag of his cigarette, trying to calm his nerves. His next words fell flatly.\u201cI want to see her records.\u201dJay was first baffled then stunned. He just couldn\u2019t believe his ears!Did that guy actually ask what I think he asked?!He replied in a monotonous tone, like perfunctorily reading out the rules.\u2013 \u201cUnfortunately, only doctors have access to patient\u2019s medical charts. Medical law in the US is ironbound. Plus, the clinic she goes to is noted for their patients\u2019 privacy protection. \u201cTae-jun sneered and spoke with sarcasm.\u201cAnd since when did you become a law-abiding citizen?

Do you want me to know why she\u2019s getting counseling and stuff?\u201dJay was back to his peppy self.

I also want something critical and solid that can put them in trouble, if needed.\u201d\u2013 \u201cHey, ain\u2019t that my specialty!\u201dGiggling, Jay hung up.Throughout the telephonic conversation, Jin-wook had kept silent, listening attentively. By the time it came to an end, his wooden face had turned grim.\u201cAre you really planning to go that far?\u201dHe\u2019d been associated with Tae-jun long enough to glean his thoughts without being explicitly mentioned.

She needed to thoroughly examine for any possible damage to the art piece during transit, thereon, prepare an inspection report. The report would then be confirmed by her agency and subsequently by the client, Daejin Department Store. The entire process had to be filmed, a mandatory requirement for the approval.After spending the entire day drafting the report, Yuri returned to her hotel room and headed straight to the bathtub. She immersed her exhausted body in hot water for a while and followed it up with a shower.Feeling refreshed, she stepped out of the shower. She patted herself dry, wrapped a robe, and walked out. She was drying her hair when two cards sitting on the vanity grabbed her attention. One was black, the other ivory.I forgot about these.It was about time for Yuri to make up her mind.After gazing at the two cards for a moment, she picked up the black one. J Consulting, Jin-Wook Jeong.She quickly opened her laptop and searched for J Consulting. Numerous companies with the same name filled her screen in a second. As vague as \u201cConsulting\u201d sounded, every \u201cJ Consulting\u201d offered its own service of all sorts.After clicking a couple of websites from the top, she concluded this was a wild goose chase and shelved the idea. Her reason was simple. What ordinary company would dig up people\u2019s background, and those that did, would they leave their background in the open just to be dug up?After picturing some of the faces she saw at Myung-jae Jin\u2019s office before, she reminded herself of what Hyeon-ah had said.He didn\u2019t talk about you in the beginning. He asked me about Hye-yeon first.Why did he ask about a dead person?Wavering, Yuri searched for Jinseong City\u2019s local newspaper. At long last, she found an article about Hye-yeon. It was from four years ago. It mentioned that the body of Ms. Jin was discovered by an old man, Mr. Cho, who was out fishing. The body was lying on the edge of the riverside with no visible injuries.Four years ago\u2026.Yuri\u2019s eyes were shifty. Her father\u2019s death, her own disappearance, and Hye-yeon\u2019s death were all aligned in the same timeline. To see it as a coincidence, too many pieces of the puzzle were missing.What happened?One by one she started to put all that she knew thus far before her.Scenes from what she\u2019d glimpsed at Hyun-ah\u2019s shop flashed before her eyes \u2013Splash, a woman sank to the bottom of the water.A stranger called Jin-wook Jeong asked around about Hye-yeon and her. How she\u2019d ended up at Hotel Seoin, the CCTV. All of it replayed before her eyes, again and again.Is this an indication of a correlation between Hye-yeon\u2019s death and me? Even if that is the case, why is he looking for me after four years?She decided to call the man and get to the bottom of this for good. However, right before calling the number on the card with her cellphone, she barely strained her nerves. She realized it was too risky. Without grasping his intention and identity, it was perilous to call the stranger and reveal her privacy.Slipping on her jacket, the next moment, Yuri stashed the card inside the pocket and recklessly left the hotel. There should be a payphone around for her to use. However, contrary to her expectations, the proliferation of cellphones precluded her from finding a payphone nearby.At last, after a long stroll, she found a payphone. With quivering hands, she inserted coins and entered the phone number on the card. The sound of the dial tone made her heart pound. Some minutes later, the call was finally answered.\u2013 \u201cHello.\u201dA man answered in a low voice. Surprised, Yuri dropped the receiver. The voice was familiar, she could not remember the person, but she recognized the voice.But how?\u2e19Unexpectedly, the sky began to cloud over abruptly and it started raining. Through the window, the uproarious sound of the pouring raindrops flowed in. Intermittently, the man on the bed groaned.Like a tramp, Hye-seong was wandering about in a piece of his memories. He stopped at one point. It\u2019s about five years ago, on that day\u2026In the court of public opinion and press, Jinseong Construction was already shredded into pieces. Prosecutors summoned every executive of the company for investigation and confiscated anything and everything that belonged to Jinseong Construction, even if it was a mere hard drive. Adding insult to injury, In-bae Lee delivered an ultimatum, requiring recovery of his campaign funds in a month.\u2013 Let\u2019s meet.It was late in the afternoon when the Seoin Group contacted him. It was the call the father and son duo, Myung-jae and Hye-seong, had been waiting for all night and day.As a matter of fact, it was not surprising to Hye-seong that Seoin Group had been coveting Hotel Jinseong for a long time now. Myung-jae was apathetic. Jinseong Construction was running on the track and the hotel was expected to produce significant financial benefits to the company as it was located in the prearranged lucrative development area close to Jinseong River.When the tables had turned and Jinseong Group rushedly struggled to liquidate the hotel, Seoin Group had disregarded their efforts to connect. The intention was clear \u2013 the court receivership was expected, and they anticipated a dirt-cheap price for the hotel.In this situation, Seoin Group contacting them was the only salvation Jinseong could hope for. Another door was opening. Perhaps, this was what Hye-seong\u2019s father thought.Soon, a private bar located in Hotel Seoin\u2019s sky lounge was decided as their rendezvous point. The one who appeared, was Tae-jun Seo, the executive director of Seoin Holdings.Hye-seong was surprised to see Tae-jun in flesh. The man who was at the top of the food chain was uncannily handsome with piercing eyes. It was not a secret that he was the practical ruler of Seoin Group, despite his young age.Instead of drinking from his wine glass, Tae-jun chain-smoked. Feeling uptight and nervous, Myung-jae Jin initiated the conversation.\u201cWe will accept your previous conditions. Let\u2019s proceed with disposal procedures.\u201d\u201cPrevious conditions? \u2026 Aha!\u201dSlowly, Tae-jun tapped the ash off his cigarette, intensifying the tension.\u201cExcuse me, but that is a \u2018previous\u2019 condition, not the latest.\u201dSilence descended. Hearts stifled, the pair was finding it hard to even breathe.Wiping his brows, the elderly man managed to speak.\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cWhat I mean is, you are not in a position where you can demand or suggest something to me.\u201dAs a man his son\u2019s age humiliated him, Myung-jae\u2019s face turned red. He was seething within.\u201cThen why did you want to see me?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cBecause I have a proposal.\u201dWith a cigarette in his mouth, Tae-jun\u2019s lips twisted, emanating a cold aura.\u201cAnd what do you propose?\u201d Myung-jae asked diffidently.Looking straight into Myung-jae\u2019s eyes, Tae-jun stubbed his cigarette out. He took a moment, it heightened the anxiety before dropping the bomb. Then, his cold voice sounded.\u201cMr. Jin, what if I date your daughter\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They\u2019d thought of a million things that this man could demand, but when he did open his mouth he threw them into utter confusion.Did he just say that he would like to date Hye-yeon? Myung-je mumbled to himself, still trying to grasp for the last straws of sense.As hard as the words were to digest, his curiosity got the better of him. He swallowed hard, took a deep breath, and carefully spoke.\u201cHye-yeon? Have you ever met Hye-yeon before?\u201dThey lived in a different world, moved in completely different circles, he wondered how their paths had crossed. He was more inclined to believe that the Hye-yeon in question was a namesake and someone else altogether.\u201cYes. At H University Art Hall\u2019s opening ceremony. She is such a talented lady.\u201dThat was the second jolt of the day. His eyes widened to their limits at the appreciation his no-good daughter was garnering.\u201c\u2026 She is?\u201d His tone didn\u2019t veil his skepticism.With a tilt of his head, Myung-je questioned Tae-jun again.\u201cWhat do you mean by dating her? You mean you would like to get married to her?\u201dTae-jun chuckled, his eyes looked at him in ridicule.\u201cYou can be so greedy, Mr. Jin. Let\u2019s not skip steps. How audacious of you to want me to become your son-in-law? Do you really think you can handle it?Embarrassed, Myung-je stared at the young man in front of him. This man was cold-hearted, he was destined to rule the near future. He was a rising star, while the Jins a falling star. And he didn\u2019t spare them any courtesy in pinpointing the fact.Hye-seong could not hide his embarrassment as well. He\u2019s flushed, at the same time angry at being humiliated as such. But what could he do?Watching the father and son\u2019s discomfiture, Tae-jun was satisfied. He continued.\u201cMr. Jin, I know what you are well-known for. I\u2019ve heard stories about you. They say you get everything for your business partners, no matter what they want. Money, drugs, girls\u2026The problem is, I don\u2019t need money. I obviously am more affluent than you. Drugs are not my thing, but I could be interested in girls.\u201dThis time Myung-je was quick to grasp where the other was pointing at. He simply looked at the man, knowing there was more to come.Taking his time, Tae-jun slowly and calmly delivered his offer.\u201cIf your daughter were to come in the package, Seoin Group might be interested in Hotel Jinseong.\u201dEven before the father had reacted, the youth stood up in anger.\u201cCome in the package? Are you mad? Money isn\u2019t everything, you jerk.\u201d He didn\u2019t care how powerful the other was, he couldn\u2019t take it anymore.What kind of crazy freak is he?Hye-seong kicked his chair to vent his aggression for he could not strangle the man.\u201cSit!\u201d A terse tone put a halt to his frenzy spree.\u201cFather, we don\u2019t need to listen to this a*s*ole.\u201d He raised his voice, red with rage.He was done with this man, it\u2019s a question of his sister after all. She was not a commodity for trade!One brusque glance and Myung-je had restrained his agitated son. Unlike his son, he knew not to wear his heart on his sleeve.Just by the look in his eyes, Hye-seong could instantly discern his conniving father\u2019s intention. Astonishingly, his father was weighing up the price ofhisdaughter! What kind of a man was he?!It was no secret that Hye-yeon was the thorn on his side, his despair. In his eyes, aside from her beauty, she had no redeeming qualities. She was a wastrel, squandering his hard-earned money bringing nothing but trouble in return. As if it wasn\u2019t enough, in order to live up to his \u201cexpectations\u201d, she also fooled around with any and all kinds of guys she could lay hands on. He\u2019d gone all out to discipline her, to the point of threatening to cut her loose\u2026 and yet, she was far from it. So, now that his daughter was of some \u201cuse\u201d, would he pass on the opportunity\u2026 And that too in such dire circumstances?Still, it was unacceptable to Hye-seong. No matter what, no father would sell his own daughter. Why even the vicious tiger wouldn\u2019t devour its young ones!\u201cFather!\u201d His voice was a mixture of wrath, indignation, and helplessness.Even so, the old man turned him a blatant blind eye and an air-tight deaf ear. He ground his teeth, glowered at his son and barked.\u201cI. Said. Sit. And. Shut. Up.\u201dWith that Myung-je ignored his son and his antics and turned to Tae-jun. He leveled his gaze, neither haughty nor humble.\u201cHow much will you pay?\u201d he asked, his tone as if he was trading an object.Hye-seong sank in despair, he knew there was no turning back now. His beast of a father was set to wolf down his offsprings.A hint of a smile appeared on Tae-jun\u2019s lips. All along, he had been quietly watching the goings-on between the duo. He wasn\u2019t surprised by the outcome, had he not known how \u2018ethical\u2019 President Jin was, he wouldn\u2019t be sitting here in the first place. His son was still living in Utopia it seems.\u201cI\u2019ll decide on it once I talk to Ms. Jin. Her decision is critical in this kind of agreement.\u201dHe didn\u2019t want to give this foxy old man the satisfaction of calling the shots. He wanted to keep the reins in his hands, lest he were played by the other.\u201cLet me talk to her. I\u2019ll take care of it,\u201d Myung-je said hurriedly.\u201cYou have four days, so we can complete the disposal procedure before receivership begins.\u201d\u201cIt is not happening!\u201d Hye-seong gave Tae-jun a fierce scowl. He wasn\u2019t going to let his father and this equally vicious man have their way!\u201cYou never know, Mr. Jin. Seems like your father has already made up his mind.\u201dAs if he\u2019d seen something funny, Tae-jun laughed sarcastically still looking at the fellow, and then turned on his heels and walked away.Hye-seong could not swallow his anger, but Myung-je hurriedly heaved himself.\u201cLet\u2019s go to the hotel. Hye-yeon is at the hotel, right?\u201d\u201cFather!\u201d\u201cListen to me, son. This is our chance. She messes around with everyone anyway, and he is not some random dude. It\u2019s actually better for her own sake to deal with him. Not only that, do you think In-bae Lee will let us be if we don\u2019t pay him back by disposing of the hotel?\u201dHe tried to breathe some sense into his son, they were in no position to pick or choose now, that is if they wished to continue living.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cHe\u2019s not the only one who\u2019s got the length of our foot. We also have something on him. As long as we have the ledger, he can\u2019t do anything to us.\u201d His son countered.\u201cIt\u2019s not about that. I have invested in him for so long. For twenty years, ever since he was a councilman, I have done all the dirty work like a dog! The next election will make him a governor, then he\u2019s going to be the president. I am not going to stop now. Don\u2019t you know what it took to get me here? Do you want us to lose everything?\u201dHye-seong agonized. Myung-je\u2019s voice reminded him of the young days.Back in college, a young Hye-seong, sick of Myung-je\u2019s ambitions and avarice, left his home. But soon, reality slapped him hard and harsh. He realized, without his father\u2019s name and wealth, he was nothing. He struggled to find part-time jobs, and when he did find after a long ordeal, what he could make every month was far less than what he used to spend on drinks on a night out. Life on budget brought Hye-seong, with his tail between his legs, back to Jinseong City in just one year.Hye-seong lowered his head. Although he didn\u2019t want his sister to be the sacrificial lamb, he knew the worth of power and money. Compared to living a life of destitution, his sister suffering a year in the hands of the monster was\u2026 acceptable.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Why are you here instead of her?\u201d He demanded gruffly.\u201cUm, that is because, um\u2026 Hye-yeon is away for a moment\u2026\u201dShe didn\u2019t know what else to say, this was too sudden. Mr. Jin was supposed to be on a business trip, not in the lobby, and least of all looking for his truant daughter!\u201cFor a moment? Then why are you in her uniform?\u201dHis piercing eyes seemed to look right through her, she was intimidated.At that moment, Hye-seong noticed her uniform and name tag \u2013 \u2018Hye-yeon Jin\u2019. Right then, Tae-jun\u2019s words surfaced in his mind.Yes. At H University Art Hall\u2019s opening ceremony. She is such a talented lady.H University\u2019s opening ceremony\u2026.One by one, the pieces started to fall in place. Yuri went to H university \u2013 Hye-seong recalled the day when he picked her up after school. She said she had an event to attend, and that day was possibly the day that Tae-jun referred to.Hye-yeon and Yuri were so alike in height and silhouette. People often took them as sisters if not cousins. The girls hung out together too and were exceptionally close.At that moment, the same thought flashed through Myung-je\u2019s mind as well.\u201cYuri,\u201d he said, his stern gaze never once leaving her quivering face.\u201cYes, yes sir.\u201d She managed to say.\u201cHave\u2026 you\u2026 by any chance\u2026 attended H University Art Hall\u2019s opening ceremony?\u201d\u201cYes, I did. Even though I could not make it to the exhibition.\u201d She replied honestly.Something glinted in the father\u2019s eyes, and the son clenched his fist.\u201cI met someone who mistook you for Hye-yeon today. What happened?\u201d Seeing how unsuspecting she was, he prodded.Yuri sighed, she knew which situation the president was referring to. She had no other choice but to be forthright.\u201cThere was a guest who\u2019d left her belongings in the room, so I entered the room with a master key. However, the new guest checked in while I was in the room. He thought I was Hye-yeon, because of my name tag and I thought it was unnecessary to explain that I am not her. I am very sorry.\u201dLike a dead person, Myung-je\u2019s face turned ghastly pale. It was this simple?\u201cAnd then, you met him at the opening ceremony?\u201d Disbelief wreathed his eyes.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect to see him there. I didn\u2019t correct him because I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever see him again. Did something happen because of this?\u201dWith a troubled face, Yuri looked at two men in front of her.Did something happen? Yes, it did and it couldn\u2019t be worse.Having learned all that there was, without a word Myung-je and Hye-seong headed back home in silence. They sat on the bar. This turn of events, mistaken identity\u2026 their situation\u2026 one by one it played before their eyes.The silent Myung-je quickly downed a glass of whiskey to calm his nerves.\u201cFather, we should give up on this plan. He\u2019s mistaken Yuri for Hye-yeon.\u201dHye-seong tried to comfort his father, but Myung-je murmured riddling things after downing two more drinks. A few moments later, he pulled out his cellphone and made a call.\u201cGet me everything about my driver\u2019s daughter. Han.\u201dHye-seong could not repress his shock. How could he not know what his sly father was up to?! He was trying to stage a fraud!\u201cFather! What are you doing? Are you\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the problem? Hye-yeon, Yuri\u2026..it doesn\u2019t matter now!\u201d He bellowed.He\u2019d been given an opportunity to survive, to fight back, and even rise\u2026 how could he let it go in vain? Whether it was his daughter or someone else\u2019s, if she served his purpose, he would not shy away.\u201cNo, not Yuri. Yuri is\u2026.\u201d He was trembling.Myung-je knew his son all too well. He was too softhearted for his own good. He detested such useless emotions.\u201cYou moron! Do you still have a feeling for her? Didn\u2019t I tell you I can\u2019t accept her.\u201d<\u2014 Flashback Ends \u2014>A whiskey glass flew, and something flashed before Hye-seong\u2019s eyes \u2013 darkness shrouded his sight.

I need to go see Yuri now and dad took my keys away. Hey, brother! Where\u2019s your key?\u201dAnnoyed by Hye-yeon\u2019s constant chattering, he pointed at the drawer. Little did he know it would be the last time he\u2019d see his sister alive.Two days later, when the police contacted him, what was waiting was a cold corpse of his sister.She said she was going to see Yuri\u2026 to see Yuri\u2026.Yuri\u2026.Yuri\u2019s name incessantly echoed in Hye-seong\u2019s mind, stirring his pain. After tossing and turning, he arduously lifted his eyelids. As deep as the pain in his shoulders pierced, as clear as his mind focused on some memories.I am sorry\u2026The memory of Yuri became vivid and apparent to Hye-seong again. To him, she was enchanting, even when she turned her back on him. \u00a0With vacant eyes, he murmured.\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have come back, so I could forget you.\u201dThe rain continued until dawn. Tae-jun was looking out the window.One such rainy night, he\u2019d cast a furtive glance on the back of a woman. Quiet and pensive, she seemed to be immersed in looking out of the window. She was oblivious to her surroundings, it appeared only the pitter-patter of the rain and she existed in her world.That was what he\u2019d asked himself then. That\u2019s what he asked even now.Often, that scene would revisit Tae-jun. And each time, he wondered what could\u2019ve been going through her mind in that moment. On a night like this, his own question was unbearable to him. He\u2019d thought he could read Yuri like a book, but in fact, he\u2019d come to realize he knew nothing about her.Day by day, he had more sleepless nights. He\u2019d experienced insomnia before, but not as bad as now \u2013 he reckoned he might need to take sleeping pills.When another cigarette was lit, the buzzing of his phone broke the dismal silence. There was only one person who would call him this late at night. \u00a0As if he already knew who the caller was, Tae-jun pressed the button without even glancing at the screen.\u2013 \u201cHello\u201d\u201cAny progress?\u201d Tae-jun never bothered with pleasantries and got straight to the brasstacks.\u2013 \u201cWell, I think I am going to be on a date with a nurse who happens to work at the clinic Yuri undergoes her therapy. Which means, we\u2019re getting close to her medical records. I\u2019ve done more research about what Yuri does for a living. She is an assistant to some well-known plastic artist named \u2018Roy Jean\u2019.\u201d\u201cAssistant?\u201d\u2013 \u201cYes, kind of, like a helper. But you know, some people say assistant, and others say something else. Sponsors and patrons are common in this field. From what I\u2019ve heard, their relationship is ambiguous. People don\u2019t think Yuri is just an assistant to him. This Roy Jean guy has a reputation of his own. Seems like he turned into a womanizer ever since his wife\u2019s passing, and that\u2019s why he came to Korea before.\u201dClenching his fists, Tae-jun bit the bullet.How dare you to find someone else?! By the way, the name sounds familiar\u2013 Roy Jean. I must\u2019ve heard of him somewhere. But where?While Tae-jun was lost in thoughts, Jay brought up something unexpected.\u2013 \u201cSo here comes the highlight. Do you know where Roy Jean traveled for work with Yuri? I will give you a hint.\u201d\u201cStop clowning around.\u201dWhen he detected fury in Tae-jun\u2019s voice, Jay checked himself and hastened his reply.\u2013 \u201cAll right, all right. You have such a hot temper! The answer is\u2026 DaeJin Department Store in Korea\u2026 Where Mr. Tae-Jun Seo\u2019s fianc\u00e9e works as a director! What a coincidence, isn\u2019t it?\u201dJae-won\u2019s voice echoed in his mind.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euFor Hotel Seoin\u2019s lobby, what do you think about a piece from Roy Jean?He\u2019s Korean-American, and the hotshot plastic artist in the States nowadays.

Two days since the dinner, in other words handing over the business card.In general, the women Jae-won flirted with contacted him in two days \u2013 they usually took one day to explore his personality and background through their own means and spent another playing hard-to-get. But it would all end up with them calling him.Will she contact me?It\u2019s certainly not the first time that Jaewon had taken fancy to a woman. That said, she certainly wasn\u2019t the first to have his business card either.However, it was most definitely a first that this hot shot was a nervous wreck waiting for her call. Women would surely call him back, and in those rarest of the rare cases of no contact, he was totally okay with it. There was no end to the women constantly expressing their interest in him, and such, Jae-won Lee shall want for nothing.However, this time was different. Didn\u2019t they say three coincidences is a proof of destiny and Yuri seemed like a destiny to Jae-won. They\u2019d already had three coincidences \u2013 first at Si-yeon\u2019s office, second was at Seohwadang, and the last at Hotel Seoin.Ever since having a conversation with this attractive woman, Jae-won found her even more enchanting that he leered at her despite the rumor that she already had a man. Yuri gave him the screaming habdabs.If she doesn\u2019t contact me, should I visit her studio in New York City in winter holiday season? No, no, I\u2019d look too desperate. While Jae-won was sat brooding on how to approach Yuri, his phone in the pocket vibrated. It was his Secretary, Choi.-Mr. Yoon, where are you?Jae-won detected a note of urgency from the voice on the telephone. What has happened? Jae-won checked the time. It\u2019s 7:30am. As Jae-won had a meeting to attend in the morning, he was already on the way.\u201cI already arrived at the hotel. I just need to get off.\u201d-Please come quickly. Quickly!\u201cWhat? Why?\u201dJae-won got off his car wondering what had happened. When he entered the lobby, secretary Choi, who had been biting his nails from anxiety, dashed to Jae-won.\u201cWhat took you so long, Mr. Yoon! I have been waiting for you!\u201dJae-won instinctively straightened his spine, because he had never seen his secretary as nervous as now. Something must have happened at the hotel.\u201cWhat is it? Did something happen?\u201d\u201cUm\u2026\u201dChoi lowered his voice as if it was something serious. Jae-won also became serious.\u201cDirector Tae-jun Seo is waiting for you in the office.\u201dLike a popped balloon, Jae-won\u2019s anxiety dissipated immediately. What\u2019s the big deal about Tae-jun\u2019s visit? He often comes to the office. Uncomprehending his secretary\u2019s fuss, Jae-won continued asking.\u201cSo what? He comes over often.\u201d\u201cBut..but it\u2019s different this time! I was scared to death.\u201d\u201cYou are always afraid of him, anyway.\u201d Jae-won replied flatly and continued walking to his office.\u201cSo, when did he come?\u201d\u201cI\u2026I don\u2019t know.\u201dJae-won stopped. What? His secretary comes to work before 7am every day.\u201cI checked in as usual, and he was already sitting in your office.\u201dOh, Lord. Slowly understanding the gravity of the situation, Jae-won turned pale as ashes.\u201cYou should have called me right at that moment!\u201d\u201cI also thought he just came in to say hi in the beginning\u2026.\u201d\u201cDid he just sit there and wait for me?\u201d\u201cNo, I wouldn\u2019t make such a fuss about it if he just sat and waited for you.

In terms of career and private life, Jae-won had been a good boy so far and had not done anything to agitate his cousin.\u201cI was behaving well recently, right?\u201d\u201cYes. You were such a good boy.\u201d His secretary was fast to supply, in a rather comical way.After getting off the elevator, Jae-won stood in front of the office door.

The office was filled with thick smoke of cigarettes, and Tae-jun was sitting in the middle with one between his lips.\u201cOh, hey. How long have you been waiting?\u201dTae-jun slowly glanced at Jae-won and stubbed out the cigarette in an ashtray. When Jae-won wondered who brought the ashtray to his office, his secretary pointed at himself, winking.\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d\u201cSeven Thirty.\u201d\u201cOk, then I must have waited about two hours.\u201dFor the love of God, two hours? From 5:30 in the morning?Tae-jun, as far as he knows, hated waiting and the amount of cigarette that Tae-jun smokes is in proportion to the depth of this agony. If Tae-jun spent two hours in an empty office, filling up the entire space by cigarette smoke, something must have happened.Jae-won quickly snatched the ashtray in front of him and gave it to his secretary. Then he rushed to open the window as he could not tolerate the thick smoke and gloomy air surging in the office.\u201cYou should stop smoking. You actually quitted before. I know you\u2019re a heavy smoker, but this is too much.\u201d\u201cMaybe, soon.\u201dWhat does he mean by that? Maybe? Soon?With his head tilt, Jae-won sat in front of Tae-jun. He pretended that he is calm, but he could not hide his shaky voice.\u201cYou could have just called me or come to my house. Someone would have prepared a jaw-dropping breakfast for you.\u201d\u201cI wanted to find something\u201dOnly then Jae-won realized the mess in his office. Every drawer was recklessly opened, the documents had fallen on the ground, and his desk was at its own war.God, help me.Jae-won felt delirious. After taking a few deep breaths, he took out words.\u201cIn case you were wondering, I don\u2019t keep a ledger in secret, nor do I have a safe in disguise. I don\u2019t know what you heard from whom, but I will never betray Seoin Group. I swear to god.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good to know. But that\u2019s not what I was looking for.\u201dDumbfounded, Jae-won was at a loss for words. Tae-jun pointed at the document in front of him on the table \u2013 It was Roy Jean\u2019s resume and portfolio which was a part of Seoin Hotel\u2019s new exhibition project proposal.Why did he look for that?\u201cDid you say you met his assistant?\u201d\u201cYes, I did. I went out for dinner with her a couple of days ago. What about it?\u201d\u201cYou went out with her?\u201dTae-jun\u2019s sharp eyes were stuck at his face.Appalled, Jae-won tried to read what is on his cousin\u2019s mind. With his straight face and monotonous tone, it was hard to read Tae-jun\u2019s real intentions. Honestly speaking, Jae-won could tell he was angry, but he did not know why.Jae-won confessed. \u201cI think I have a thing for her. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll draw a clean line between business and my private life.\u201dImmediately, Tae-jun\u2019s face turned stone-cold.

Tae-jun interrogated him as if his lover cheated on him with Jae-won.What is happening?While sweeping his face, something came to Jae-won\u2019s realization.You went out with her?Did I ever mention Roy Jean\u2019s assistant is a woman?\u2e19Leaning on the window, Yuri organized her thoughts with a cup of coffee on her hand.I need to remember my past.When she came back to her hotel room from the payphone booth, it poured. Maybe because of the sound of raindrops or maybe because of her deep thoughts, she could not fall asleep.After a long contemplation, Yuri concluded one thing. That is: the year that she has forgotten, is not just another year. She could not remember a thing about it, but she could fathom the frightful fear that it hid.After tossing and turning all night long, she left her bed when she received an approval from Daejin Department store\u2019s new exhibit.

So\u2026 I think I am going to stay in Korea for a bit after work is over.\u201dA heavy silence hovered over the phone. Yuri patiently waited for Roy\u2019s answer. After a short sigh, Roy asked.-Why did you make that decision?\u201cI want to regain my memories.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euYuri brought up what she thought about last night when the rain poured. Finding her memories was what she had been intentionally avoiding for the past four years.In the beginning, she tried her best to regain her lost memories. She tried counseling, medication, and even hypnotherapy. What welcomed her instead, were serious side effects, and she was labeled a \u201chabitual attempted suicide patient.\u201dAfter that, she did not put more effort on regaining her memories. Thinking what is lost is lost, she comforted herself. It was regrettable that she could not remember the death of her father, but she did not want to risk anything anymore just to find her memories.However, ever since she came back to Korea, the pieces of her memories came back and told her there is more behind the year she lost. If it was about the deaths of her loved ones, she needed to know more.She was resolutely determined.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

With a heavy heart, Roy eventually spoke\u2026-Do you have a place to stay?\u201cI am looking for a place available to rent for a short while only. I will let you know once I find out more about it.\u201d-Will you be ok doing everything all alone?\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I am taking my pills regularly, and I am paying attention to myself. It won\u2019t take that long.\u201dHer last sentence was said more of a hunch than an actual fact. For some reason, she could feel that it was close.After the call with Roy, she put her phone back in the purse and checked her makeup one more time. Eventually her eyes gravitated to the business card on the vanity table.Ivory color, Seoin Hotel, Director Jae-won Lee.If it is ok with you, can you give me a call before you go back to the States?He was a well-mannered man, equipped with a kind face. He seemed like a guy who would have numerous suitors, but Yuri did not feel any chemistry with him.She appreciated his favor, but she did not want anything personal from him. Yuri picked up the card, and tore it up bit by bit, before depositing the remains onto the nearby trash bin.***Si-yeon received a notice that the installation had been completed, she was about to step out of her office and head to the lounge. However, an unexpected visit stopped her. Even the visitor had left Si-yeon\u2019s secretary, Kim, wide-eyed after their encounter.It was Tae-jun, who stood in front of Si-yeon\u2019s office.Tae-jun had visited her office before, but this time it was different. He came without any notice, not even his secretary accompanied him.What is going on? Secretary Kim quickly shot up from their seated position, and bowed to Tae-jun before inquiring.\u201cGood morning, Director Seo. How can I help you?\u201d\u201cI would like to talk to her.\u201dOf course, that would be his reason. But the question is, what would he want to talk about?Si-yeon stared at Tae-jun, trying to read his intention, but she could not find a single clue. His expression was impassive, and his voice monotonous. If it was work-related, he would have been accompanied by his secretarySo Si-yeon was left to be clueless.\u201cWell, please come in.\u201d Si-Yeon opened her office door, allowing him in.\u201cCould you wait for a moment? We just installed a new exhibit in the VIP lounge. I need to confirm if everything is ok for the last time. It won\u2019t take long\u2026\u201dHowever, Tae-jun seemed to have no intention to enter the office, as he remained glued to where he stood.\u201cAren\u2019t you coming in?\u201d Si-yeon wondered.\u201cI will come with you. I would like to see it as well.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI want to see the Heart of Apollo.\u201dSi-yeon and her secretary stared at him agaped.Tae-jun did not even give them room to answer \u2013 instead, he pushed the button to call up an elevator. As discreetly as she could, Si-yeon ordered her secretary to figure out what is going on with Tae-jun. Kim quickly texted his secretary and asked why his boss was in Si-yeon\u2019s office.Waiting for the elevator, Si-yeon reinitiated the conversation.\u201cI didn\u2019t know you were interested in the Heart of Apollo. Did you know Roy Jean?\u201d\u201cYes, but not for long.\u201d\u201cSo, you\u2019ve only heard about him recently?\u201dSi-yeon asked again when the elevator reached them, and the door slid open. Tae-jun entered first and leaned against the furthest wall in the back. Si-yeon and her secretary followed shortly after him. Kim pushed the button to reach the VIP lounge.\u201cJae-won had mentioned he\u2019s been planning to purchase Roy Jean\u2019s pieces for Seoin Hotel\u2019s lobby.\u201d he eventually explained.\u201cAlright, that\u2019s why you came.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cIs Roy Jean here?\u201d\u201cNo, he\u2019s not here.\u201d\u201cWhy? It is such an important and expensive project. He should be here.\u201d\u201cHe had previous responsibilities in Japan. I was desperate, so the installation was managed by his assistant.\u201d\u201cOk, then she must be alone.\u201d Tae-jun mumbled in a low voice.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Even though she was conversing with him, she felt as though he was not there. He behaved as if they belonged to different worlds.The door opened, and Si-yeon found she could not take her eyes off his back. Tae-jun walked out before she could.Kim leaned in, and whispered quietly to Si-yeon.\u201cDirector Seo\u2019s secretary also does not have any idea. He said Mr. Seo did not even show up to the office today.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked in surprise, when Kim winced at her volume, and brought a finger up to their lips.\u201cShhh..He might hear us.\u201dTae-jun stopped and turned back towards them.\u201cLet me make a call first, before we go.\u201dHe went outside to the terrace garden, before entering the VIP lounge.Tilting her head, Si-yeon then entered the lounge first.The newly remodeled interior of VIP lounge was exquisite and held a somewhat secretive aura in it. The high ceilings and the blue lighting overhead were reminiscent of the deep ocean and its abyss. Located at the heart of this mystic space, was Heart of Apollo.Other employees bowed at Si-yeon and her secretary upon entry. A few steps away, was Yuri, recording the installation of the piece with her tablet. When she sensed Si-yeon approaching, Yuri lifted her head and greeted her.\u201cOh! Hi Miss Lee.\u201d she greeted jovially and Si-yeon\u2019s eyes glinted in satisfaction at the design.\u201cThis is beyond my expectation! The lounge and the Heart of Apollo complement each other spectacularly!\u201d she praised.\u201cI agree with you.\u201d Yuri put a soft smile on her face. The deal was fair for both parties involved, and she was proud to present a work, in which a great amount of effort had been invested in by her.Looking closely at the Heart of Apollo, Si-yeon posed a question to Yuri.\u201cI didn\u2019t realize it when I saw it for the first time in New York\u2026. But this piece somehow reminds me of you. Were you the inspiration?\u201d\u201cNo, I am not.\u201d she laughed sheepishly.\u201cReally? Haven\u2019t anyone told you that the piece resembles you?\u201dYuri glared at the Heart of Apollo.She had recorded and taken pictures of it numerous times, but it never came across her mind who the inspiration was. It must be someone else \u2013 Roy\u2019s late wife, most probably. After all, he still wore the wedding ring he shared with his wife.Yuri shook her head.\u201cI am not the inspiration. It\u2019s someone else.\u201d she replied confidently.\u201cOh, yes?\u201d\u201cMaybe the resemblance is due to Roy\u2019s environment. Artists are always influenced by their surroundings. I do spend a lot of time with my Roy as an assistant.\u201d\u201cAha, that makes sense.\u201dWhile Si-yeon appreciated the work, Yuri got lost in her thoughts.Although she had decided she\u2019d regain her memories, she did not know where to even begin.The first piece of the puzzle was obviously the man in her dreams. He seemed like a key player of her lost memories, but she had no clue about his identity or whatsoever. The only thing she knew about him was his face.At that moment, a shadow of a tall man blanketed in front of Yuri. Yuri unconsciously raised her head to identify to whom the shadow belonged to. When her eyes met the face of the stranger, her jaw slightly dropped, as her eyes widened upon seeing him.\u201cH\u2026How..?\u201dIt seemed surreal.The man in front of her was the one from the dreams. Instinctively, she took a step back.The boundary between reality and dream collapsed. From dizziness, her sights spun like a puppet in the music box. Yuri dropped her tablet in her hands.Right before it would hit the ground and clatter to the floor, the man in front of her catches the tablet.\u201cYou should be careful, Yuri Han.\u201d his cool voice told her.This low voice. All of a sudden, the air surrounding her felt suffocating to Yuri \u2013 am I in another dream? Is he coming after me? He is going to grab me by the arms, push me against the wall, and force raw and violent intercourse \u2013 I have seen this gaze, the gaze of a brute. He will devour me like a beast.The voice of Si-yeon rescued Yuri before she fell into deeper panic.\u201cLet me introduce my fianc\u00e9, Yuri. \u00a0Director Tae-jun Seo from Seoin Group.\u201dTae-jun Seo.Yuri repeated his name in her head. She did not know this name, nor did she know this man. She surveyed Tae-jun from bottom to top with her eyes.The strong jaw, sophisticated lips, sleek nose\u2026 As if someone threw her off a perpendicular cliff, something vertiginous flashed before her eyes when her eyes met his.She was determined to identify the man from her dreams, but she did not expect his appearance in such an abrupt way.\u201cTae-jun, this is Yuri, Roy Jean\u2019s assistant.\u201dTae-jun introduced himself even before Si-yeon finished her sentence.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cHow do you do, Miss Han.

Yuri pulled out her business card, flashing him a faux smile.\u201cYuri Han.\u201dAs if Yuri\u2019s entire resume was written down on it, Tae-jun took a close look at the card in his hand: Her name and phone number were the only things printed on it.Si-yeon cut in.\u201cSeoin Hotel also intends to change up their exhibits, and they are interested in Roy Jean\u2019s pieces as well. He came along to check our new pieces by Roy. What do you think? Do you like them Tae-jun?\u201d she asked eagerly, and Tae-jun nodded.Another lie.He claimed to be interested in purchasing art pieces, but not once did he even turn to look upon the Heart of Apollo when he entered the gallery. The only thing, or person, that Tae-jun had ever laid his eyes on was Yuri.As if she was the sole reason for his visit. He did not even pay attention to any other of Roy\u2019s pieces.Like a finely sharpened knife, his keen eyes penetrated deep into Yuri\u2019s soul. Cold sweat ran down Yuri\u2019s spine. Everywhere Tae-jun laid his eyes on, Yuri felt the burning sensation of cuts all over her skin.\u201cMiss Han. Is Yuri Han your real name?\u201d Tae-jun asked.\u201cExcuse me?\u201dYuri was confused. She could not understand what he was getting to. Staring at Yuri, Tae-jun continued.\u201cI think I saw someone once, greatly resembling you. Well, not even that. Who looks identical to you, but I think I remember them having a different name.\u201d He feigned forgetfulness, as Yuri\u2019s eyes narrowed at him.What kind of answer does he want from her? Turning her face away, Yuri hands fisted at her skirt.\u201cThat\u2019s interesting, but it is my first time meeting you,\u201d she stated determinedly, and Tae-jun nodded in mock understanding.\u201cAlright, if you say so.\u201d As if he heard something funny, Tae-jun raised his brows. Yuri was uncomfortable because she felt like Tae-jun was toying with her. With a final glance, Tae-jun finally faced Si-yeon.\u201cIf you have some spare time today, we should have lunch together. With Yuri as well.\u201d he casually suggested.\u201cThat sounds like a plan.\u201d Si-yeon agreed excitedly, \u201cYuri, are you free?\u201d\u201cI appreciate it, but\u2026\u201d\u201cI would like to discuss purchase plans over the table.\u201dAs Roy\u2019s assistant, discussing sales with a possible client on a lunch table was a suggestion Yuri could not easily reject. Reluctantly, Yuri answered.\u201cOk\u2026 Thank you.\u201dAt that moment, a ghost of a smile appeared on Tae-jun\u2019s face.\u201cSeems like lunch works for Yuri as well.\u201dSi-yeon\u2019s secretary pulled out her cell phone. \u201cI will make a reservation immediately. Director Seo, what would you like?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t care. You can decide.\u201dSecretary Kim reserved a table at the most popular French restaurant in the department store.The chef had a reputation he gained from his exceptional record at a two-star Michelin restaurant in France and a hotel as well. Usually a reservation would be required to at least be notified a day in advance, but such trivialities did not apply if it was Si-yeon calling.On the way to the restaurant, Yuri\u2019s mind delved into her possible relationship with Tae-jun in the past.What was their relationship? How did they know each other?Associating her dreams to what was in front of her, she presumed it to be something very private and close to the heart. Close enough to warrant sexual and physical intimacy with one another.But that was her assumption so far, until the moment she realized he was an executive director of Seoin Group.His identity and social position threw Si-yeon into the crossfire.Even though she could not recall what happened in her past, in general, it was difficult to draw a connection between an art student with an unimpressive and underprivileged background and a person in such a position.Even when they sat down on the table and opened a menu, Yuri\u2019s mind was preoccupied with a snaggle of confusion. Sitting next to Tae-jun, who sat across Yuri, Si-yeon stared into Yuri\u2019s face.\u201cAre you okay, Yuri? You don\u2019t look well.\u201d she remarked.\u201cOh.\u201d Yuri raised her head and blanched, as she caught Tae-Jun\u2019s eyes. Was he staring at her the whole time? \u201cI am alright. I am just a bit dizzy, but that\u2019s not new. It happens sometimes. Thank you for asking.\u201d She laughed sheepishly.Yuri turned her mouth up slightly to be polite. Even then, like a ferocious beast preparing to hunt its prey, Tae-jun still did not take his eyes off of her. Enduring his piercing gaze, Yuri reached to the water glass to ease her dry mouth.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAs if waiting for an opportune moment, Tae-jun finally spoke once more.\u201cYuri, how long have you been working as an assistant to Mr. Jean?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been three years already.\u201d\u201cThree years.\u201d Tae-jun tapped his long fingers on the table.A big strong hand \u2013 the hand that opened and caused Yuri\u2019s body to shake in her memories.

And he happened to reinitiate his work three years ago.\u201d\u201cExcuse me, but I don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re trying to say.\u201d\u201cWhat are assistants usually responsible for?\u201d\u201cWe assist with creation of work, or whatever needed.\u201d\u201cDoes it include something personal and private? For example, if he needs someone in his bed\u2026\u201d\u201cTae-jun!\u201d Si-yeon exclaimed indignantly, slamming her water glass back on the table at his audacity to suggest such a thing, and shot him a scathing look. \u201cYou are being rude. That\u2019s such an indelicate question to ask.\u201dHe did not reply to Si-yeon, in fact he ignored her as if she did not exist.Yuri was the only person worth laying his eyes upon. His eyes were prodding for her to offer an answer. His eyes roamed all over her.His glances were burning, cold and passionate at the same time. Yuri could sense one thing \u2013 whatever relationship they had in the past; it definitely did not end well.Tae-jun did not try to veil his curious glances towards Yuri in front of his own fianc\u00e9, nonetheless. He did not even care if anyone saw him.The question itself did not surprise Yuri. Roy Jean had a reputation for not hiring a female assistant in the industry.After he separated from his wife by death at a young age, he had pursued his own celibacy for a long time, mourning for his loss. In order to avoid any kind of women-related rumors, he was reluctant to hire any female assistant.When Yuri was hired as an assistant to Roy Jean as the first female assistant in over ten years, they became a hot topic for gossip. As a result, Yuri had to repeat the same answer over and over again like a parrot.\u201cI and Mr. Jean do not share such a personal and intimate relationship. He is simply my boss and teacher.\u201d\u201cA boss and a teacher. I apologize. I was ignorant.\u201d Despite the apology, his tone suggested otherwise.Thankfully, the lunch was served before further conversation. The star chef appeared in front of them, as if on a cooking show, explaining the menu of the day next to the table.House-made cheese, top graded beef, and abalones freshly delivered from the seaside every morning could not impress Yuri. She could not taste anything, and it seemed the same to the man seated before her. He seemed like he would rather cut, chew, and swallow Yuri instead of the food.To cut the tension in the air, Si-yeon started speaking.\u201cYuri, other than assisting Roy Jean, do you work on your personal pieces?\u201dYuri was thankful for the change in topic.\u201cFor the moment, I don\u2019t have anything that I am working on my own.\u201d\u201cWhy? Actually, the agency told me that there was a piece that inspired the Heart of Apollo, and I heard it was created by you. I was dying to see it, but it was not open to the public.\u201dAt that instant, Yuri dropped her fork.Clink!The clashing noise of the fork hitting on the ground rang through the air.\u201cAre you okay?\u201d\u201cOh, I am sorry.\u201dWhen Yuri tried to pick up the fork, Si-yeon called up a waiter.\u201cYou seem dizzy. You\u2019re pale as a sheet!\u201dSi-yeon\u2019s voice was muffled like a drop of paint in water before Yuri\u2019s ears. She was panicking.She did not expect to hear anyone mentioning Apollo. The piece that her hands obsessively created, the only piece Yuri had ever created \u2013 it had the shape of the man in front of her.Apollo was Tae-jun.She clenched her fists tightly beneath the table, feeling the blood circulation begin to get cut off, and they eventually resumed to eat their meal.After a long and tense lunch, Si-yeon whispered at Yuri while Tae-jun paid for the meal.\u201cYuri, I am sorry for what my fianc\u00e9 said. He\u2019s not a rude person, but he\u2019s been in a bad mood nowadays because of work. I whole-heartily apologize for him. I am sorry.\u201dGlaring at Si-yeon\u2019s glistening diamond ring on her ring finger, Yuri nodded. It was not Si-yeon\u2019s fault.\u201cIt\u2019s ok. I was not angry. I should leave now, thank you for inviting me.\u201d\u201cOf course! Thank you for your work. I hope to see you again. Please say hi to Mr. Jean for me.\u201d\u201cSure. Thank you for hosting me.\u201dWhen Tae-jun finally came out of the restaurant, Yuri said her parting words to him as well.\u201cThank you for inviting me. It was a pleasure to meet you.\u201d she rewarded him with another faux smile.Of course, it was a lie.However, one more lie should not be problematic to a conversation which was already covered with rampant lies.Keeping his straight face, Tae-jun nodded back at Yuri.Yuri turned to the elevator. As soon as her entrance, Yuri pressed the lobby and frantically pushed the close button over and over again. She wanted to escape from the place as soon as possible.I need to get out of here.Warning bells rang in the back of her mind.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe man with the penetrating eyes, looked at Yuri like a fierce beast right before biting the neck of its prey.

Didn\u2019t you find anything weird?\u201d She asked, trying to make sense of what she\u2019d seen.\u201cYou mean, visiting you without notice?\u201d\u201cThat as well, and\u2026\u201d she trailed off, not voicing out her thoughts.I feel like I was used as an excuse. Or a bait.A bait to bring Yuri to the lunch table.Si-yeon assumed Tae-jun would accompany her back to the office, but he left her right after lunch, saying he was under a work schedule.The way how Tae-jun behaved today was completely new to Si-yeon \u2013 he seemed excited and most importantly\u2026 at the lounge and at the gallery, his eyes were glued solely on Yuri. For some reason, Yuri seemed to know Tae-jun in person as well.How do they know each other?Considering their backgrounds and social status, they shouldn\u2019t have been able to cross paths with each other, enough to make an impression.Si-yeon had known Tae-jun ever since they were children. Of course, she expected Tae-jun to have past relationships before their engagement. However, if he was dating someone currently, it was impossible for her mother to be unaware of it, as she was the one who had insisted on her engagement to Tae-jun.\u201cAnd?\u201d Kim strained her ears to listen to the answer. Awkward situation, uncomfortable feelings and an ominous presentiment.What are these pointing at?After a moment of hesitance, Si-yeon only shook her head. If she talks more about her gloomy thoughts to her secretary, it was only a matter of time before her mother, Mrs. Go, would know about it.To be honest, Si-yeon wanted to avoid the fuss her mother would cause once she learns of this, at all costs.\u201cNothing special. By the way, where\u2019s the Pepcid?\u201d She asked, changing the subject.\u201cWere there any problems with lunch?\u201d\u201cNo, not really.\u201dSi-yeon swallowed the pill with water. Dining in an uncomfortable situation usually upset her stomach all the time. And of course, her secretary, who had overseen Si-yeon ever since she was a child, was well aware of it.She could easily sense whenever her boss had troubling thoughts.\u201cDo you think you can get married to him?\u201d Kim eventually asked and Si-yeon let out an amused chuckle.She could read what was on her secretary\u2019s mind \u2013 Kim thought Si-yeon was so uncomfortable with her own husband-to-be that she could not even dine with him without it upsetting her stomach.\u201cI have to. That\u2019s Mrs. Go\u2019s lifelong wish.\u201d she answered resignedly.Si-yeon was seven years old, when the woman from her father\u2019s past showed up at her house with a boy who was a year older than her.After pointing her fingers fanatically to the boy and his mother, Mrs. Go fainted at the sight. At that moment, she had been pregnant with another baby\u2026A baby that never had the chance to be born.It was after that moment when Mrs. Go became another person. The once na\u00efve woman with a soft heart, became a stone-cold, heartless person.Since then, she wished for nothing but one thing \u2013 her daughter, Si-yeon becoming the ruler of Daejin Group. To claim her rightful kingdom from her two older step brothers and two younger step brothers, Si-yeon needed a partner with power.A partner who is so powerful and heartless that he would eliminate any contestant that Si-yeon ever has to compete with. Tae-jun ticked all the boxes that Mrs. Go had ever hoped for. And Si-yeon wanted to grant her mother\u2019s wishes by all means.Should I figure out what happened between them?Si-yeon mused to herself.Si-yeon did not want to be a pathetic woman who secretly does background checks on her fianc\u00e9\u2019s past relationships, but she was his fianc\u00e9e and she was not open to the thought of any kind of an affair in their marriage.Stroking her bloated stomach absent-mindedly, Si-yeon tapped her temple.\u2e19\u201cWait at the hospital. I\u2019m on the way. She fainted out of blue.\u201dDriving like a madman, Tae-jun stroked Yuri\u2019s cheek with his freehand; Yuri collapsed shortly before and lost her consciousness. Tae-jun suddenly felt a chill. run down his bodyHe might have to change his plans.After gathering every bit of her personal information, it was not difficult for him to find Yuri.According to the agency, the Heart of Apollo\u2019s installation was to be completed today, and that was where his prey had been hiding.Tae-jun did not hurry to back Yuri into a corner. After all, cornering a prey was always entertaining to him. Taking Yuri back as he wanted would require great patience on his part.Surprisingly, Yuri\u2019s reaction at the lunch table was unwaveringly poised.She was clearly agitated by Tae-jun\u2019s presence, but she was not afraid, nor did she try to escape from him. Rather, she seemed to have been exploring something.Was she bold, or was she simply a good actress? Only time would tell him.When Tae-jun received a text message reporting everything was prepared, he began his hunt.When he slid his hand between the closing doors of the elevator, the woman inside glared at him with wide, frightened eyes. Every step that Tae-jun took towards her made her take a step back until there was no more room.Her pupils dilated and were filled with fear.Yes, that\u2019s how I like it. That\u2019s the fun part of hunting.He thought maliciously to himself.Tae-jun unhurriedly entered the elevator and pushed the close button. As the doors slid close, the thin air in the small elevator started to suffocate both Yuri and Tae-jun. Yuri dropped her gaze and desperately tried to compose herself.Stuffing his hands to his pockets, Tae-jun leaned against a wall before her.

Does she even eat at all anymore?Jay\u2019s phone call flashed in Tae-jun\u2019s mind.\u201cShe already attempted suicide a few times.\u201dIs it related to her mental problems?As Tae-jun held Yuri in his arms, a violent and compelling appetite surged from deep within that it devoured the rest of his rationality. The appetite that Tae-jun had lost for quite some time \u2013 the desire to hold her and taste every bit of her, suddenly welled up in him.Unconsciously, Tae-jun\u2019s grip on Yuri tightened.When Tae-jun arrived at Seoin Hospital, Jin-ho was already waiting for them by the entrance.Jin-ho, an internist, was Jin-wook\u2019s brother. To Tae-jun, he not only considered him as an employee, but also a good friend.Instead of carrying her by a rollaway bed, Tae-jun carried Yuri in his arms all the way to a private ward. Surprised, Jin-ho only took a bag from Tae-jun\u2019s hand.Like his brother Jin-wook, who had known Tae-jun for over twenty years, Jin-ho had also known him for a long time. However, Jin-ho had never seen Tae-jun treating someone else with such obsessive behavior.Jin-ho scowled at the unconscious woman in Tae-jun\u2019s arms. She seemed like someone who was weak. She was tall, but very skinny. And even though her eyes were closed for the moment, he could tell she was beautiful.\u201cWho is this?\u201d he asked.Laying Yuri on the bed in the private ward, Tae-jun answered.\u201cMine.\u201d\u201cWhat? Then what about your fianc\u00e9e?\u201d Jin-ho asked incredulously.Regardless of their close friendship, Jin-ho was well aware of the line drawn between them. Briefly, Jin-ho examined the woman in front of him before he prepped her up for an IV.\u201cPsychological shock from an abrupt stress. She seems weak. If you want, I can run some further tests to examine her health in detail.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dPsychological shock?That\u2019s no good. Tae-jun crossed his arms. After giving Tae-jun a narrowed stare at the moment, Jin-ho finally left the ward.About half an hour later, Yuri groaned, her eyes still closed. As if she was suffering from something excruciating, she tossed and turned on the bed. Yuri shrieked from fear, before bolting awake, and letting out a gasp.\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Tae-jun lowered himself on her level, to check on her. Blinking her eyes in anxiety, Yuri rushed into Tae-jun\u2019s arms.\u201cI am sorry, I am sorry.\u201dTae-jun flinched.Ever since he started tracking Yuri and discovered her real identity, Tae-jun enjoyed guessing what her first words were going to be, numerous times. Will she be surprised? Will she be afraid? Will she panic? However, apology was not one of his many assumptions.Clinging onto his jackets, Yuri put her cheeks on Tae-jun\u2019s chest. A strange feeling clambered up Tae-jun. Just for Yuri, he had prepared a long list of vengeance, yet his resolve quickly crumbled at this moment.Patiently, Tae-jun planned a well-planned revenge, and Yuri\u2019s first words mysteriously unarmed him. Well, a ward is an inappropriate place to share the happiness of a long-waited reencounter.Tae-jun chuckled coldly and put his hands over her shoulders to pull Yuri apart from him gently, as to not startle him. At that moment, Yuri opened her lips.\u201cRoy.\u201d she gasped out in a breathy voice.As if he was doused in ice, Tae-jun\u2019s face hardened as he heard the name out of her lips.Damn you. How dare you call another man\u2019s name in my arms?!Tae-jun breathed in, trying to extend his patience a thousandfold, to try not to grip her throat; instead, he only seized her shoulders in a deep-seated anger.\u2e19Her shoulders hurt. When she lifted her eyelids, the first thing that came into Yuri\u2019s blurry sight was a man. Next to him was another man in a white gown. He seemed like a doctor.It soon came to Yuri\u2019s realization that she was at the hospital. Yuri could not see the man\u2019s face, but she could easily visualize the look on his face. He would have a sad, concerned and a perplexed look, as it always had been for the past three years.\u201cAre you okay?\u201d\u201cI am sorry, I am sorry.\u201dOver and over again, Yuri had been repeating the same thing tediously, but he deserved an answer to it. She wanted to explain to him that she did not mean to die this time. A deep sigh would come out between his lips.In regret, Yuri called his name.\u201cRoy.\u201dHowever, this time was different. The man\u2019s face contorted in displeasure. As if he was going to crumple her like a flimsy piece of paper, the man grabbed her shoulders with brute force.Yuri grimaced her face in pain.\u201cRoy?\u201d\u201cAnd you claim that he\u2019s just a boss and a teacher.\u201d the man spat at her in disdain.The man\u2019s callous voice fell over Yuri\u2019s head, freezing every part of her body.Like parting clouds, her consciousness cleared the haziness away, and soon she zeroed in on the actual man before her.Roy was not a smoker \u2013 but this man smelled like cigarettes. Every fiber of his body exuded masculinity all over her. Yuri relaxed her grips on his arms and looked up.Yuri\u2019s confused eyes met the man\u2019s \u2013 by wrath, his eyes were ablazed with anger at her.\u201cLook at me, look at me in the eyes. Can you see who I am now?!\u201d He demanded.Frightened, Yuri turned pale as ashes and tried to break out of Tae-jun\u2019s arms.\u201cH-How..Why..\u201d she asked shakily, as she tried to yank herself away from him in panic. HIs grip only tightened at her resistance, as he sneered at her\u2026\u201cDon\u2019t you remember? You passed out in the elevator.\u201dSlowly, Yuri traced her vague memory. She got into the elevator, and he followed her. Her head started hurting and cold sweat ran through her back. His entrance was the last thing she could remember.Yuri began to tidy up herself.\u201cIf you helped me when I fainted..\u201dWith furious eyes, Tae-jun cut off her words.\u201cWhy did you disappear four years ago?!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euYuri froze at his question.Four years ago?His question shook Yuri.

If that\u2019s your only excuse, come on, that\u2019s not fun.\u201d\u201cI am serious! The only thing that I know about you is that you are Director Yoon\u2019s fianc\u00e9 and that\u2019s it. I was just introduced to you.\u201d She appeared incredulous, her eyes wide in shock.\u201cDon\u2019t give me that crap. I am not in the mood to play games.\u201d\u201cI am not trying to play anything! I do not have any memory\u2026\u201dBANG!Tae-jun slammed the bedhead with his fist. Because of the deafening noise, Yuri covered her ears and closed her eyes. Tae-jun reached his hand to Yuri and twisted her hair with his fingers.\u201cI hate wasting my time. We have a lot to talk about from now on.\u201dThe voice falling down to Yuri\u2019s earlobes sounded excited. Contrary to his heated voice, his eyes sunk to the abyss. Is it how being eaten by a beast feels like? Yuri could only breathe and glare at Tae-jun.What created the fracture in suffocating silence in the ward was Tae-jun\u2019s phone inside his jacket. Tae-jun checked the name on the screen, and with an annoyed voice, answered the call.\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you not to call me today?\u201dAn anxious voice murmured that the president had summoned Tae-jun through the phone. While Tae-jun answers the phone, Yuri pulled out the IV needle on her arms.I hate it, I hate these needles.Yuri was disgusted with the same repetitive situation where the fluid enters her body through the needle whenever she wakes up in the hospital.\u201cI will come in soon. Buy some time, I am nearby.\u201dAfter the phone call, Tae-jun spoke to Yuri in a commanding tone.\u201cCome see me when I call you.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d\u201cIt is going to happen.\u201dWhen Tae-jun left the ward, Yuri quickly stood up from the bed, put on her jackets and tidied herself. Her shoulders were still hurting, and her hands shaky. She struggled to pack her bag and rubbed her shoulders. At that moment, the door opened, and the doctor entered the ward.Yuri quickly noticed his name tag on his chest. Seoin Hospital, Internist Jin-ho, Jeong. Jin-ho approached Yuri.\u201cDid you get hurt?\u201d\u201cNo, I think I just bumped into something and it hurts a little bit.\u201d\u201cDo you have any medical conditions or medicine that you take?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dYuri intentionally shook her head. She did not want to speak a word. Since she was at Seoin Hospital, everything she says to the doctor would go to Tae-jun\u2019s knowledge, from which medicine she takes, and how her condition is. She did not want him to have any information about her.\u201cOk. So I am going to check your blood pressure and run a brief blood test\u2026\u201dTest?Immediately, Yuri waved her hands.\u201cNo, no need for the tests. I have been tired for the past few days. I didn\u2019t sleep well as usual. I think I am okay now.\u201d\u201cBut..\u201d\u201cActually, I have some urgent things to take care of. I need to go.\u201d As Yuri refused flatly, Jin-ho shrugged his shoulders.\u201cAlright then, please take a good rest when you go home. I would still like to recommend you get tested. You have a bad complexion.\u201d\u201cI will see. How can I pay?\u201d\u201cOh, don\u2019t worry about it. It\u2019s already taken care of. You can just leave.\u201dIt is Tae-jun. Yuri fathomed. While opening her bag again to put her wallet back to the purse, Yuri realized something that she did not notice before.\u201cUm, is this everything?\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s everything we have. The person who brought you passed it to us\u201dHer tablet was gone. It was not in her purse anymore. Only then she realized what Tae-jun meant when he said, \u2018it is going to happen.\u2019\u201cBastard,\u201d Yuri clenched her teeth.When she came back to her hotel room, Yuri searched Tae-jun Seo. Executive director of Seoin Group. An Asian Games gold medalist at trap shooting, and the successor of Seoin Group which includes eight subsidiaries. The man who had everything by birth, and also destined to have more in the future.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euStaring at the picture of Tae-jun on her screen, Yuri dwelled on her current situation. Her dreams, and his attitude. From what she could assemble from his reactions, she could vaguely assume what their prior relationship was in the past. But judging from his untowards reaction to her, their relationship could be something more serious than a fling. She frowned.\u201cBy the time I lost my memories, I was dating Hye-seong. Didn\u2019t I?\u201dWhen she came back to Jinseong city after being almost hustled out of her school and art industry, Hye-seong was the first one to offer her a friendly helping hand. As Yuri was mentally exhausted, he who she had known ever since she was a child, was a great comfort.Of course, she was aware of his father\u2019s concerns about their relationship, hence did not expect a future with Hye-seong. Yuri simply pocketed her feelings \u2013 she also had her own plans in her mind. She already knew that they are to split their ways when the time comes.Even then, she could not believe that she must have moved on so fast with another man; with a man who had a matchless prominent background compared to Jin family.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Burying her head between her knees, Yuri scorned herself. Why did she lose so many memories? The death of her father, the death of Hye-yeon, and the man who could have possibly been her lover.If there is one thing that she could be certain about, it is that the relationship did not end on good terms. Either him or her left the other, and what was written on the ending page of their relationship was not happily ever after.Yuri would not be surprised if he left her as that is more realistic than the other way around, but seemingly, the circumstances pointed at the opposite way. Either way, she could not understand why Tae-jun was still antagonized by her as it had been four years already and he, by all means, engaged to another woman.We have a lot to talk about from now on.Something to talk about from now on? Then why did he not talk about it in the past four years? Is it because of his engagement?Surging questions occupied her mind. Soon, she could vaguely assume Tae-jun\u2019s intentions. Engagement between two of the most powerful families required precautions. If Yuri was one of his women in the past, her presence might be quite disturbing to his current fianc\u00e9e. Is that the case? Whatever the answer is, another encounter with Tae-jun did not seem like a good idea.After a profound sigh, Yuri stood up.It was already dark outside. To send the agency and Roy the final installation report by the end of the day, she needed to retrieve her tablet back from him. Most of her installation notes were copied in her laptop, but the pictures that she had taken earlier at Daejin Department Store were not updated yet and she needed them for the report.Most importantly, in order to find her memories back, she needed to meet Tae-jun, the man in her dreams and flashbacks.Should I go visit his office?When she entered Seoin Holdings to a search engine, her phone next to the laptop rang. An unfamiliar number.However, Yuri could easily guess who the caller was. After taking a few deep breaths, she pushed the answer button.\u201cHello.\u201d-You answered late.Ignoring his response, Yuri started talking.\u201cI need my tablet back. It is important to me.\u201d-You need to come and get it yourself.Deridingly, Tae-jun answered in a low tone. Yuri tried her best not to react emotionally.\u201cWhere should I come? To your office?\u201d-Seoin Hotel, Suite, Room 3001.\u201cWait, hey!\u201dRuthlessly, Tae-jun cut off the line. Yuri did not even have a moment to be antagonized by his rude attitude. He did not need to provide anything but a hotel room number, because at that moment, Yuri found the room number somewhatfamiliar.I know this room number.Oozing sound began pounding inside Yuri\u2019s head. Stumbling, she massaged her forehead.***\u201cHere I am, again.\u201dAfter getting off the taxi, Yuri glared at the overwhelmingly lavish appearance of Seoin Hotel. This was her third visit. She visited this hotel for the first time because Daejin Deparment Store\u2019s reserved a room in the hotel as her accommodation during her stay for installation work. Second time, she unconsciously was driven to come, after her visit to Jinseong City.Last time when she visited the hotel, she could understand what brought her there. Now, she knew why. Because the man, Tae-jun Seo, was here.\u2018Did I remember this place somehow?\u2019Something was still engraved deep in Yuri\u2019s mind \u2013 even after removing the death of her father, ten days, and the death of Hye-yeon from her memories completely. After she collected better pieces of information about Tae-jun, she was able to make sense out of the man who had the security camera video from Seoin Hotel. Presumably, the man named \u2018Jin-wook Jeong\u2019 works for Tae-jun.Now the question is, why did he delve into Hye-yeon Jin\u2019s death? Is her death related to Tae-jun?\u201cMiss Han?\u201dA familiar voice dragged Yuri out of her deep thoughts. The voice was from the cousin of the man she needed to confront. The man who possibly could have been her lover in the past. What a perfect timing!\u201cHello, Jae-won. Are you off now?\u201d\u201cYes! By the way, what brought you here today? Is it a coincidence? Or did you come to see me?\u201d\u201cOh no, I came to visit one of my acquaintances.\u201d\u201cI see. Well, unfortunately, I also have a plan that I cannot skip. I was worried that you came to visit me!\u201dJae-won seemed disappointed, but he hid his disappointment. As Yuri had realized it from the beginning, Jae-won always made her feel at home. Anyone could see that he was well-educated from a respected family with care and love.Why are Tae-jun and Jae-won so different from each other as cousins? When Yuri reminded herself of the man who she needs to confront, her face clouded over.Jae-won quickly changed the topic. \u201cIs the installation finished?\u201d\u201cYes, it is done today.\u201d\u201cThen, are you leaving Korea soon?\u201dAfter taking a few seconds, Yuri answered. \u00a0\u201cI think I am going to stay for a bit. I need to take care of some stuff.\u201d\u201cWell, that is great news to me!\u201dJae-won smiled.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cYou can take your time. I can wait for your call.\u201dNothing forceful, but an insisting voice of Jae-won landed on Yuri\u2019s ears.After entering the elevator, she closed her eyes. Whenever she breathed, something suppressed her chest, and left her feeling nauseated. Even when she walked through the lavish aisles, she felt queasy.In front of the suite 3001, she dropped her head and looked down at her shoes. Somehow, she felt like she had done this before. Here, in this place, at some moment that she does not remember.With shaking fingers, she rang the bell. Without making a single noise, the heavy door opened.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He noticed she still had her sharp tongue.\u201cCome in,\u201d he said unceremoniously.However, the girl stood rooted to her spot, she had no intention of stepping in and she made sure to make her purpose of visit clear.\u201cI only came to get back the tablet.\u201dTae-jun shot her a lazy glance, his eyes still and unfathomable.\u201cYou\u2019re free to stand there all night if you want.\u201dHe went back inside without another word. He knew her all too well, her defiance and courage. He also knew how to get her to do his bidding.Yuri had no choice but to follow him. The door closed behind her with an ominous sound. Tae-jun was sitting on the living room sofa with a lit cigarette. Yuri felt his gaze on her through the smoke as she slowly sat on the opposite side. She tried to speak without betraying any emotion.\u201cPlease give it back to me.\u201dTae-jun\u2019s smile did not reach his eyes, and Yuri was afraid all the more for it.\u201cYou still don\u2019t know me?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t remember.\u201d\u201cThen, I\u2019ll have to make you.\u201dTae-jun rose, and his hand found Yuri\u2019s face.

Yuri gasped out loud and sank back to the sofa.\u201cW-wait.\u201dSurprised by the sound she made, Yuri clasped a hand over her mouth. Her heart was pounding as it would burst. Tremors ran down her body in fear.Tae-jun only laughed at her response.\u201cDo you remember now?\u201d\u201cI, I don\u2019t know what happened, but I lost parts of my memory. Especially the last four to five years of my life. So I can\u2019t remember you.\u201d\u201cI remember telling you not to fool around with me.\u201dThe ends of his lips twisted.

Don\u2019t you have a better excuse or an explanation?\u201dHis sneer deepened instead, which made Yuri feel faint. She did not want to face him, who seemed to be not interested in having a conversation and only interrogated her. Yuri was tormented by her memory loss. She had lost her father, her friend, and herself. The trauma burdened her so much that Yuri could not create her pieces anymore. If there was an excuse or an explanation, she was the one who wanted to hear it the most.\u201cWhat do you want to hear from me?

He pressed the speed dial to call Si-yeon, and turned to speaker mode and placed it on the table.\u2013 Yes, Tae-jun.Yuri flinched, hearing Si-yeon\u2019s voice. What was Tae-jun thinking?

Who is this?Yuri hesitated as she remembered the wife of a professor she had met before. When Yuri asked for help, the wife had told her that it was her fault of having given him leeway. Yuri could not open her mouth as the image of the woman shielding her husband latched in her.Si-yeon was repeating herself.-Hello? This is Si-yeon Yoon. Tae-jun, is there something wrong?

Yuri instinctively tried to pull back, but she was always against the wall. Tae-jun held her waist tightly with the other arm.\u201cYou say you don\u2019t remember.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t, but I know that much. Because we broke up, you didn\u2019t look for me in America\u2026and even got e-engaged.\u201dIt was difficult for Yuri to open her lips. She trembled wherever his breath brushed against her. Yuri\u2019s head was spinning from his scent mixed with cigarette smoke. Tae-jun brushed her hair away and whispered with his lips against her ear.\u201cI knew you to be \u2018Hye-yeon Jin.\u2019\u201dWhat did he mean by that? Yuri had no time to think as Tae-jun roughly held her head back and kissed her.\u201cUh!\u201d Tae-jun strengthened his grip on her chin to pry Yuri\u2019s lips open. His tongue ravaged hers in a breathtaking kiss. His sensual scent tinted with cigarette smoke overwhelmed her. She tried to push him away, but it only made Tae-jun move in closer and deeper until she felt numb. No matter how Yuri tried to get away from him, the kiss became rougher, and the wet sounds they made were becoming messier.His tongue was forcibly taking her breath away. He slipped Yuri\u2019s trench coat off her with a hand while Yuri was trying to get her breath back. He then violently pulled her blouse down. The buttons fell off, and the opening revealed a simple beige bra.Yuri screamed and tried to hide what was displayed in front of him. Tae-jun spoke in a level voice even after that passionate kiss.\u201cIt\u2019s not my type. Is it his?\u201dHe recklessly pushed up her bra and squeezed her breasts. Yuri shuddered everywhere when his hands pressed her hardening nipples.\u201cStop!\u201dTae-jun easily grabbed both of her wrists with one hand and held them up her head. She felt his tongue wrapping around her nipples and sucking. Tae-jun rolled one in his mouth while fondling the other with his other hand.He left red marks on her white skin as he hungrily sucked and grabbed. Yuri let out a shaking breath. She trembled everywhere Tae-jun\u2019s hands, lips, and tongue roamed. Her skin began to show a faint blush.Tae-jun was enjoying her sweet skin to his heart\u2019s content when he saw the marks left by his hand on Yuri\u2019s shoulder.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cIt must have hurt. You always bruised so easily.\u201dHe kissed the bruise on her shoulder. Yuri was writing as she felt Tae-jun hardening against her stomach.\u201cLet go! I don\u2019t want this!\u201d\u201cDid you already forget? I said you couldn\u2019t refuse when I want you. Stop moving. I never did it like this, and I don\u2019t want to hurt you.\u201dTae-jun\u2019s voice had a threatening tone as he lifted her up. His body, remaining immobile no matter what Yuri did, told her everything. It did not matter whether she shouted, cried, or resisted. He would have her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As the long cloth snaked down her thighs, her slim legs and [email\u00a0protected] came into view. Her blouse was already wide open and could no longer hide her bre*sts. The red marks left on her white skin drove him crazy.He hurriedly stripped his clothes off, displaying his sculpted physique and er*ction as he came to her naked as the day he was born.As the bare-bodied man neared, Yuri drew back; not out of fear but astonishment. She had sketched the body of the man in her memories. Yuri had even made molds of the beautiful body she could see whenever she closed her eyes. She just had never imagined that it would now come to her in flesh. What\u2019s more, belonging to Tae-jun Seo\u2013the man who wreaked havoc into her life just recently.Tae-jun grabbed her ankle and roughly pulled her to him. He removed the clothing that remained on her and spread her legs out.\u201cAh!\u201dYuri shuddered like a fish forced out of the water as his thumb touched the most sensitive spots deep inside her. The man chuckled and relentlessly pushed his fingers into her.Yuri was still dry and hence, in pain. She grabbed his wrist and pushed his chest away.\u201cIt hurts!\u201d She glared at him.\u201cYou\u2019d become wet with only a kiss before.\u201dDisregarding her words, he simply plunged his fingers deeper. Her face creased in pain as she felt his digits moving inside her.\u201cIt hurts! Please, stop.\u201d\u00a0 She pleaded.\u201cIt\u2019s so tight. Your old teacher hasn\u2019t had you much.\u201d He sniggered.\u201cI said that\u2019s not true!\u201d She glared daggers at him. \u201cI\u2019m not in that kind of relationship with Roy \u2026\u201dHis fingers came in deeper after stroking her cl*toris. He licked her earlobe as if to soothe her, circled his fingers in as she became less tight than before.Yuri shut her eyes tightly as his fingers seemed to be everywhere inside her. He pressed a particular spot while observing her response.\u201cDo you still like it here?\u201d he asked in a raspy voice.\u201cAh!\u201d\u00a0She felt electrified.Tae-jun had once known her body better than Yuri did. Even after four years, he found the places that aroused her quickly.She grabbed his shoulders as tremors overtook her. She felt herself getting damp under his relentless ministrations.He stirred her until wet sounds filled the room. She turned her head away in embarrassment, but the man forced her to watch him with a hand on her chin. He slowly licked his fingers as he met her eyes.\u201cI remember your taste.\u201dYuri blushed as she watched him lick her juices.\u201cDon\u2019t do this!\u201d she said softly.\u201cYes, I did not plan to do this, but now you rush me.\u201d Saying so, he held one of her legs over his shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s been too long.\u201dHe rubbed his erect*on just before he entered and lightly bit her lower lip. Yuri gripped his shoulders tighter as she felt a massive heat against her body. She felt as if she was split in two when Tae-jun thrust inside her.\u201cAh!\u201dShe was hit with excruciating pain. Even though she had become wet under his caresses, it had been too long since she had accepted a man inside. He was too big and hot as he forced his way inside her walls.She tilted her head back, her lips trembled. Above her, Tae-jun groaned as he reached her deepest regions.\u201cIt should be like this.\u201d He whispered hoarsely.Lodged deep inside her, he stared into her eyes without moving. Teardrops hung on her long and lush eyelashes. He held her in his arms while she struggled to get her breath back. He traced along her forehead, brows, the bridge of her nose, closed eyelids, lips with his eyes, and his gaze traveled down her delicate neckline, collarbone, arm, hands, fingers, and nails.His gaze stopped at Yuri\u2019s hands that were fisting the bedsheets. They had the same short nails as a child\u2019s but were homely compared to the rest of her body. They were continuously drawing and making something, so her hands were wreathed with calluses. Everything about her was beautiful, but Tae-jun remembered her hands best.\u201cI finally found you, Yuri Han.\u201dTaking her hand, he planted a kiss on her warm palm. He then grabbed her thighs and pushed her body closer. She felt like she was being impaled, ravaged by a monster even. She clenched her teeth as he forcibly opened her to himLarge hands soon found her pair of mounds kneading them to his contentment while he softly bit the soft skin of her neck. Yuri felt arousal taking over pain as he rubbed her reddened n*pples and moved his hips in a fast rhythm.It was a sensation long left in the past. As he moved in and out with long and deep thrusts, the top of his head hit the headboard.His movements were violent and rough, but her body remembered him. The bond with Tae-jun Seo was something deeper than a simple physical encounter.Strange sensation filled her as the passionate sex she had in her dream became a reality.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As pain turned to ple*sure inch by inch, Yuri felt [email\u00a0protected] escaping from her mouth.\u201cAh, ah!\u201dYuri felt heady as she felt him inside, and the sensations were waking something that was lying dormant in her. A light blinked beyond the black curtains of her memory.What is this?Something was trying to rip and come out of the curtains. Yuri reached out and tried to grab it without thought. However, her hands touched Tae-jun\u2019s face instead of her fragmented memory.A suppressed [email\u00a0protected] slipped out of Tae-jun\u2019s mouth. Yuri was startled to find a strange sensation of something burning rolling within her.

He caressed where they met and thru$t deeper.\u201cWe are going for it now.\u201d He declared.\u201cStop!\u201d She made a feeble attempt.He was deep inside her. Her walls engulfed and tightened their hold on him as if she had been waiting for this very moment. She was shocked, her body betrayed her and welcomed him in. Her body was now thoroughly awake from this brief experience. He filled her, and she felt her body fit him in. Her skin was so sensitive that she could feel his shape and pulsating veins.\u201cAh-\u201cHer [email\u00a0protected] were different from before. Her twin peaks were crushed in his grip. As he rolled her buds with his palms, her husky groans became louder.\u201cAh, umm-\u201cThe sound was pure music to his ears. Tae-jun\u2019s hand lowered to stroke her intimate spots. He was still ravaging her, where they remained connected. The lewd noises and the springs of the mattress rang in her ears.He worked her sweet spots.\u201cYou\u2019re incredible. Still so tight.\u201d He whispered between pants.She felt herself being pulled along with him with each movement. She was already soaked, and her body pulled as if to suck him in. He knew that he should not overwhelm her with his strength, but Tae-jun could not control himself. Every time he plunged into her, Yuri\u2019s body rattled as she was about to break.\u201cAh-\u201cYuri gasped in shock and passion with every movement Tae-jun made. He stared at her face overwhelmed with pleasure.\u201cWhy did you disappear?\u201d He demanded out of nowhere.He spoke in a voice that froze Yuri\u2019s flushed body.\u2e19Yuri managed to open her mouth only after the movements stopped.\u201cWhat?\u201d She was still dazed.\u201cWe had been doing this until the morning of my business trip.

Her world turned black as a fierce pleasure pierced through everywhere.\u201cAh-\u201cYuri\u2019s thighs trembled and her back arched. She tightened her hold on him as juices flowed out. Tae-jun also creased his face and stopped breathing. He had come and was trying to enjoy her as much as possible, but he found it impossible to control himself.\u201cLet go a little. The night\u2019s still long,\u201d he said.Then, he began to stroke her cl*tor*s, but Yuri was limp from the sensations that repeatedly overwhelmed her. Tae-jun clicked his tongue as he observed Yuri panting with her face buried in the bed sheets. He was not dense not to know how a woman felt when he was inside her. Tae-jun had overwhelmed her, and her body was too weak to go further.Though lean, Yuri had smooth muscles on her arms and legs. Now, she looked almost emancipated and too frail for him.Tae-jun\u2019s erecti0n was still high as he extracted himself from Yuri. He had forgotten carnal desires for years, and now they seemed to be revived.He gulped some wine and fed it to Yuri with his mouth.

Following his instincts, he plunged deep into her core and stroked the inside walls. His taut abdomen crushed and rubbed her cl*toris.Yuri shed incessant tears as waves of pain and [email\u00a0protected] deluged her. However, the man still dominated her without any mercy. He thrust relentlessly, using his tongue and fingers to make her respond to him whenever she would span.He came when her vision blurred like when she was in the nightmare. Tae-jun poured himself into her as he kissed her neck and collarbone with a low groan. Wholly spent her hand on his shoulder dropped with a thump.\u201cHey!\u201dTae-jun lightly tapped her cheek but got no response. Finally, his senses seemed to return, he was able to think.He had not had s*x like this even during his twenties. Such verve and the uncontrollable, obsessive passion that made him forget himself and focus only on the co!tal [email\u00a0protected] , was foreign to him. But he knew, this woman was the only one who had such an effect on him.Tae-jun pulled away from Yuri and ran his hand through her rumpled hair. Her swollen red lips stood out on her pale face. A mix of liquids from what they had just done spilled in his tracks. There was a still unsatisfied desire within the s*xual afterglow he was feeling at the moment.\u201cYou drive me crazy.\u201d He whispered in her ear.Holding her head, he gently put a pillow underneath. After covering her naked body with a quilt, Tae-jun put on a bathrobe and grabbed a cigarette. He went to the terrace and lit it, trying to suppress his hankerings with long swallows.He was on the verge of mounting and feasting on her like a beast\u2026 it didn\u2019t matter whether she could take it or not\u2026 it was like the pent up emotions from these past four years, had found a release.After determinedly reining in the brute of desire, he took another puff before called Jay.\u201cHave you checked Yuri Han\u2019s treatment records?\u201d Was the opening sentence.\u2013 \u201cThe doctor in the clinic is careful with managing the documents, so it will take some time to get the records in full. Her illness is so tricky that there\u2019s a mountain of consultation records.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the name of the illness?\u201d\u2013 \u201cTransient global amnesia. It\u2019s a memory disorder from psychological trauma rather than the workings of the brain. This woman seems to have lost her entire memory of a specific period.\u201dMemory loss of a particular period?Tae-jun\u2019s brows furrowed.Was it true she did not remember him?Her temperature, pulse, and breathing he felt in his hands were too real for Yuri to be feigning. No matter how good an actress she was, it would be impossible to control those things.As he listened and thought, he did not know how much he should believe.He ended the call and went back to the living room. Picking up Yuri\u2019s bag lying at the entrance, he sat on the sofa and rummaged through the contents. Writing supplies, notebook, catalog, a cosmetics pouch, her passport, and a wallet\u2026 most of her belongings were simple black without any embellishments.The ends of Tae-jun\u2019s lips lifted.Still the same taste.One thing they had in common was their preference for clothes and ornaments with clean cuts. And by the sight of it, it seemed to have remained despite the memory loss. Somehow, this trivial discovery brought a tinge of warmth within him.Lighting another cigarette, he took out her wallet and passport. He compared the picture in the passport with her name. The pictures used in her license and passport were a younger version of Yuri, but they were undoubtedly her.Setting these aside, he reached out to the booklet. It was a catalog showcasing the profiles of artists in an exclusive contract with the agency Yuri belonged to.When his eyes landed on the picture on the opening page, they were suffused with malice.\u201cSo, this is her teacher and boss.\u201dFrom the picture, it was obvious Roy Jean was a handsome man. He was forty-four but looked younger as some artists did. Ash hair, sharp eyes, and a lean and muscular body showed through the image.Tae-jun went livid whenever he remembered Yuri going straight to Roy, calling and hugging him the moment she woke up. According to a report from America, this Roy was the most intimate relationship Yuri had there.He was roughly turning over the pages until he found Yuri\u2019s profile at the end. Since she had just made her debut, there was nothing noticeable except for her photo and pictures of her work. Tae-jun\u2019s gaze fixed on the list of her works for a moment. There was a name that stuck out.Apollo.Was this the work that was the motif for the \u2018Heart of Apollo\u2019?There was no way to know as this particular work, unlike the rest, was without an image. Since a price tag was not listed, this work was not for sale.Tae-jun kept digging through the bag until he found something out of the ordinary. It was a pill bottle. Actually, it was a transparent plastic box that was the size of a small book containing neatly packaged pills in ziplock pouches. There were at least six different kinds in large amounts. They could\u2019ve been vitamins, but the colors of the pills were too bright to be so.Tae-jun did not specialize in medicine but knew what medicine Seoin Pharmaceutics, a subsidiary, developed. Taking his knowledge into account, these vibrant pills were typically psychotropic drugs. He wondered at the sheer amount of pills Yuri carried with her.Opening the pillbox, he examined each pill with a stiff face. Opiates, stabilizers, antidepressants, and painkillers. He knew most of them but could not recognize the white pills.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSince the product name was not listed, he deduced they must be a prototype.If she needs to take this much medicine at the same time, what happened to Yuri?She is said to have mental problems. They say she tried to take her own life multiple times, and it\u2019s become a habit.Jay\u2019s report echoed in his head.I don\u2019t know what happened, but I lost parts of my memory. Especially the last four to five years of my life. So I don\u2019t remember you.Yuri\u2019s voice rang in his ears.Furthermore, the fact she left him\u2026 disappeared, lost her memory, and now was taking all these drugs. Tae-jun\u2019s thoughts sank deep in his eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He opened his eyes and turned on the bedside lamp only to find Yuri huddled on the bed, shaking in a cold sweat.Tae-jun laid a hand on her forehead and immediately retracted it. Her entire body was burning up. Wasting no time, he called Jin-ho, who was quick to respond despite the early hours.\u201cI need you to come to the hotel right now.\u201d\u2013 \u201cNow? What happened? Are you hurt?\u201d A puzzled voice queried.\u201cNot me, but someone else. She has a high fever.\u201dEnding the call, Tae-jun went to the bathroom and fetched a damp, warm towel. He carefully wiped Yuri\u2019s frail body covered with the marks he had left. She looked as if she would crumble to pieces at any moment like a dry flower.Tae-jun was slowly moving his hand when his gaze stopped between Yuri\u2019s legs. Watching the c*m slowly flowing out of her swollen nether regions, he felt himself going hard. He had intentionally left his marks on her and dressed her in his shirt. He was marking his territory\u2026 it brought him satisfaction.Shortly after, Jin-ho arrived. He gaped at the room filled with traces of what had happened and the Yuri lying unconscious on the bed.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t forced, right?\u201dJin-ho looked as if he was going to call Jin-wook right there as he took out his cell phone. If it was a criminal case, it was for his brother, not him.Tae-jun simply ignored the implications.\u201cWhat\u2019s the problem?\u201dThe question galled Jin-ho. He didn\u2019t know if Tae-jun was blind or deranged. He was screaming in his mind:Look at her! The parts that are visible are wreathed with palm prints and crimson bruises.However, Jin-ho managed to swallow his words and put his cell phone back where it came from. He carefully checked her temperature and blood pressure, injected an antipyretic, and an IV drip.\u201cShe seems to be weak from fatigue, and I can only give her fever reducers because she has a high fever. We have to wait until she wakes up. She doesn\u2019t have any chronic diseases, right?\u201d\u201cThese were in her bag. She seems to be taking them.\u201dTae-jun showed Jin-ho the pills he took one by one from Yuri\u2019s bag. Jin-ho adjusted his glasses with a frown as he examined each one.\u201cThese are psychotropic drugs, antidepressants, and sedatives. And these are-\u201cJin-ho also carefully went over the white pills. \u201cI have seen these for the first time. There\u2019s no name, and what\u2019s more, she\u2019s taking them all?\u201d His shock was evident in his eyes. He turned to look at the unconscious figure, and then again at the medicines in his hand and shook his head.\u201cAnalyze the components. Don\u2019t take them to Seoin Pharmaceutics but to another lab.\u201d\u201cA different lab?\u201d He wasn\u2019t sure what the man, who owned a state-of-the-art lab, intended.\u201cSomewhere not under the chairman\u2019s influence.\u201dNow that the purpose was clear, the doctor bobbed his head in understanding.\u201cI know a place personally. It will take some time, though.\u201dTae-jun nodded. He was determined to get the bottom of those pills and away from the prying eyes of his grandfather.While Jin-ho was packing his medical bag, Tae-jun gently held a cold towel on Yuri\u2019s forehead. Looking at the scene, the doctor was stunned, mouth agape.Recovering his senses before he was even discovered, he said, \u201cI\u2019ve injected some antipyretics into her, but she needs to be checked upon because her temperature is too high. I\u2019ll send a nurse along.\u201d\u201cNo need, I\u2019ll do it. Leave the fever reducers and the IV drip.\u201d A cold voice instructed.\u201cYou\u2019re going to do this by yourself?\u201d Jin-ho asked in surprise.Tae-jun had received a well-rounded education since his childhood which even included simple treatments.But to think this frosty devil would nurse someone\u2026?Jin-ho shrugged and put the fever reducers, and the IV drips out.Tae-jun headed to the bar in the living room as Jin-ho cleaned up again. He filled a glass with his favorite whiskey and asked Jin-ho if he wanted one. Jin-ho shook his head.\u201cI have a special case early in the morning,\u201d he said, declining the offer.\u201cI need to ask you one thing. Can memories of only a certain period disappear? It\u2019s a memory loss that does not affect daily life or one\u2019s personal information, but pertains to a certain period and a certain person.\u201dThis particular thing had been hounding Tae-jun ever since he\u2019d found out about it. A person with a memory loss was not uncommon. An accident, age\u2026 many had suffered from this. However, this whole 'selective amnesia\u201d was a novel concept to him\u2026 and preposterous at that. If one had to forget, one would forget everything, why just a specific thing?Jin-ho tilted his head at the sudden question. Since his arrival, this man had been tossing him surprises. The room, the girl, and now this question.Sighing inwardly, he said, \u201cI\u2019m not a psychiatrist, but to the best of my knowledge, it is plausible. A person can lose memories of some months or years, or perhaps a certain person or a case. There are many examples, and films and TV shows have used this quite often.\u201dTae-jun\u2019s brows furrowed. \u201cWhat\u2019s the cause?\u201d\u201cThere are many. It might be a physical accident or the aftereffects of an operation. There could also be psychological issues, and I can\u2019t say anything for certain because the human brain is delicate and complicated.\u201d\u201cAre those symptoms permanent, or can they be cured?\u201d\u201cIt depends. Transient global amnesia is different in cause, symptom, and period case by case. Fortunately, memory loss of a certain period can be cured through the passage of time or when an opportunity pops up. Of course, there is a chance the loss is permanent.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cOpportunity?\u201d Tae-jun\u2019s sharp eyes hooked onto the doctor.\u201cPlaces, people, and actions that are relevant to the lost memory. Why do you ask?\u201d The doctor didn\u2019t want to let go of the rare chance to ask a question of his own.However\u2026Tae-jun emptied the glass and went back to the bedroom instead of replying, throwing back a \u201cYou did well. Go now.\u201d as he did.With an impassive face, Jin-ho watched Tae-jun walking away from him. Something was happening. Perhaps it had already happened, like how a butterfly\u2019s wings fluttered in the air heralding torrential rains.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The long path ended in front of a massive door. The passage crashed down with booming noises as she tried to open it. As she fell into the abyss, someone grabbed her hand.Yuri woke up with a gasp. She opened her eyes to find a sleeping face in front of her. As she blinked, a ray of light shone through the crack between the curtains on his face. Perhaps she was still dreaming. The person who had held her hand when she fell was Tae-jun.As Yuri organized her thoughts, Tae-jun seemed to be mocking himself.\u201cThen I got to know of something even more shocking. I found the woman I lived and slept with for a year was a completely different person. Do you know how I felt when I didn\u2019t even know the woman I held in my arms?\u201d he asked her with a piercing gaze.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what my name is. I was \u2018Hye-yeon Jin\u2019 during our contract.\u201d She nonchalantly replied.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter because it was a contract?\u201d His tone was chilling.Yuri took a breath before meeting his gaze.\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThen, you know our contract has not ended yet?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Isn\u2019t this a clear breach of our contract? I require an explanation.\u201d His lopsided grin evinced how much he was enjoying cornering her.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cOf course, you have nothing to say because you lost your memory.\u201d He jabbed. \u201cHowever, our contract needs to be fulfilled.\u201d His frosty words were a reflection of his mood.After a moment of sullen silence, Yuri Han looked at him squarely and said, \u201cYou know I\u2019m not Hye-yeon Jin. What are you asking me to do?\u201d\u201cAs you said, it doesn\u2019t matter whether your name is Hye-yeon Jin or Yuri Han. It\u2019s you who is in bed with me, aren\u2019t I right?\u201dHe had used her own words to trap her. He was making it amply clear there was no way she could escape his clutches.However, the woman in question was incredulity personified. It was such twisted logic. \u201cYou are crazy!\u201d She spat out.Tae-jun chuckled softly, not minding her harsh words one bit. His smile was cold as ice, he lifted her chin and forced her to look into his eyes.\u201cNow, you know. I regret that I hadn\u2019t told you sooner. If you knew I was crazy, you wouldn\u2019t have pulled off this doubling stunt on me.\u201dYuri flinched at Tae-jun\u2019s darkening eyes, those orbs seemed to have the power to engulf anyone they desired. She tried to wrest herself free, but his grip was tight.Like this, the prey and the predator were in a stalemate until the doorbell rang. Tae-jun looked at the clock and let go of Yuri\u2019s chin.As soon as Tae-jun left the bedroom, she straightened herself. Just then she felt something flow between her legs when she tried to get out of bed. She was dumbstruck when she looked inside her shirt.Her thighs and p*bic hair had dried cum on them, she could still feel some inside her. The stinging in her lower stomach and the numbness in her nether regions, painstakingly helped her recollect that she had had s*x with Tae-jun.Yuri was wiping herself down with a cloth when she heard a familiar voice.\u201cDon\u2019t be so cold-hearted. I found the hotel kitchen bustling when I went there to get something for my hangover. I was thinking of you, and I thought we could have breakfast together, but you seem not to have slept at all. Did you work all night?\u201d\u201cWhy do you want to know that?\u201d a cold voice said.\u201cThe room lacks your signature cigarette residues. Do you have a guest?\u201d The inquisitiveness was evident in the tone.Yuri hid below the blankets as soon as she recognized Jae-won\u2019s voice. Thankfully, the bedroom door closed immediately, and his voice faded away.A little while later, Tae-jun came into the bedroom.\u201cWake up. Let\u2019s eat,\u201d he said to the figure huddled under the quilt.\u201cIs Mr. Jae-won gone?\u201d she asked, peeking her head out ever so slightly.\u201cHow do you know Jae-won?\u201d Tae-jun demanded instead of an answer.\u201cI met him by chance at Daejin Department Store. We had dinner over the discussion of purchasing works for the exhibition.\u201d She replied honestly.Tae-jun\u2019s voice dripped with sarcasm as he helped a tittering Yuri up. \u201cShould I have shown Jae-won that the woman naked in my bed is Yuri Han?\u201d\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have anything to do with our relationship. Where are my clothes?\u201d she said, irritatedly.\u201cI\u2019ll tell you after we eat.\u201dYuri frowned at Tae-jun\u2019s callous treatment of her things\u2014from the tablet PC to her clothes. However, she had no other option but to do as he wished.The table was filled with food for more than two, from Korean and western dishes to porridge and juice.\u201cEat.\u201dTae-jun dished small portions of each dish on Yuri\u2019s plate. However, her mouth dried upon seeing the exquisite spread, she felt no appetite. Instead, she found this whole situation of Tae-jun feeding her quite unsettling.She was unable to make out this man\u2019s persona or intentions. His words were curt and cold, but his actions of meticulously serving her food were quite the contrary.In the end, Yuri managed to take small bites of melon and some soup only because she thought she needed to eat something to find the strength to get out of here. That was her goal no.1 at the moment\u2014freeing herself from the devil\u2019s clutches.Tae-jun looked at her gingerly nibbling and smirked. \u201cEat other dishes too. You\u2019re too thin. You must have lost at least ten pounds since we last met.\u201dHow does he know such things?Yuri pulled at the front of her shirt and ignored his comment.\u201cI don\u2019t have any appetite. Just give me back my clothes and the tablet PC.\u201d She wanted to get out right now, she had been on tenterhooks right from the moment she woke up.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cWe should finish our conversation first.\u201d\u201cWhat conversation?

I\u2019ll even raise the ante, anything you want.\u201dYuri could only scoff at his offer and glared at Tae-jun. \u201cI have nothing to say.

His eyes had a dangerous glint that would accept no opposition.Still looking into his eyes, she heard him stand up. As those eyes drew closer and closer, Yuri clenched her fists on the side. Then, he reached out and stroked her neck.She felt goosebumps wherever he touched her. Suddenly, she found it hard to breathe even though his fingers were gentle on her skin. His hand moved from her neck to grab her hair.\u201cI don\u2019t go ahead with only one plan for anything I do because I hate variables.\u201d His voice was growing chillier with every word. \u201cIf I don\u2019t receive the answer I want, I\u2019ll just rattle you with other options, like your uncle or your teacher.\u201dTae-jun declared that the result would be the same no matter what Yuri tried to do. Veins stood out on her white hands. She knew that Tae-jun had won because it was exactly like this five years ago.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

An entire wall of the tub was made of glass, she could see the blue sky and the buildings below spread out in front of her. She rested her head on the window and thought back to what had happened just now.\u201cYou just need to wait at my house on my bed like before. The condition is the same that you cannot refuse me when I want you.\u201d\u201cIs this revenge for my deceiving you?\u201d\u201cRevenge?\u201dTae-jun laughed sarcastically.\u201cIf I really wanted revenge for that, you wouldn\u2019t be standing here now. However, I think another condition should be added that you should not deceive me.\u201d\u201cWhat are you going to do with me?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m looking into it now.\u201dYuri sighed and wondered if she made the right choice. Tae-jun\u2019s threats were not the only reason she had accepted this absurd offer. She wanted to find her lost memories as they were a gaping hole inside her. She\u2019d often thought that the rift in her memories was like sinkholes, a curse within their suddenness that broke down her daily life.So, to find her memories she needed the cause for them \u2013 Tae-jun. Dr. Davis had emphasized this \u2018cause\u2019 throughout the treatments, and the rigid seal on her memories seemed to be now crumbling readily with her encounters with Tae-jun Seo.Another point she was considering was the unidentified men who threatened her uncle. Yuri did not believe them to be irrelevant to Hye-yeon\u2019s death, and that meant they could make a repeat appearance. The best choice she could make to ensure her safety from them was being by Tae-jun Seo\u2019s side.\u201cDon\u2019t deceive me.\u201dShe was not deceiving him but using him just like he was her body. Bizarre\u2026 selfish\u2026 crude\u2026 ruthless\u2026 be it as it may, they were here now, willingly or unwillingly. Now on, her sole focus was on retrieving what was hers- her memories.Yuri closed her eyes and slowly leaned back when the bathroom door suddenly opened. She sat straight and turned her gaze to the door in surprise. Her eyes held Tae-jun taking off her shirt.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dTae-jun took off his pants and underwear before she had a chance to be astonished. His p*nis was fully e*ect, and Yuri\u2019s gaze avoided the reason why her body was so sore now.\u201cHaven\u2019t we done this often? You\u2019re being shy.\u201dTae-jun was telling the truth, as Yuri had taken showers with him, and they had done it often in the bathroom. Yuri had been astonished and embarrassed every time, and after four years, she was even more nervous than she had been at that time. Also, whenever Tae-jun ravaged her in the bathroom, the act tired her out at least by double.He stepped into the bathtub, and despite escaping to the corner, Yuri felt his taut chest on her back. \u00a0He gently stroked her shoulders.\u201cYou\u2019re too thin for my taste.\u201dYuri was indignant at Tae-jun\u2019s dissatisfied voice.Who was it that had ravished her disagreeably thin body?She could feel his hard-on at her hips that seemed to be waiting to delve between her legs. She pushed away his hands on her chest and responded in a chilly voice.\u201cFind a woman to your taste then.\u201d\u201cThat was a flat joke.\u201d He immediately retorted.\u201cIt\u2019s not a joke\u2026 ah!\u201dTae-jun\u2019s hand slid between her legs. Her nether regions were still a bit swollen from last night, and when he touched her, she felt at once a sore yet strange sensation. She breathed in and drew her legs together.\u201cStop. I don\u2019t want to do it here,\u201d she said tersely.\u201cI\u2019m trying to wash you down since I filled you up last night.\u201d Tae-jun calmly covered her most intimate place with his hand and whispered to Yuri as he licked her earlobe and added. \u201cI thought I told you you had to spread your legs whenever I want you to.\u201dIt was an accurate and menacing statement, and he forced her with a low laugh.\u201cSpread your legs.\u201dYuri chewed on her lips and relaxed her thighs as Tae-jun gently stroked her wet p*bic hair. He found her cl*toris and started rubbing it. It immediately responded and stiffened at his ministrations.She flinched and leaned back from the stimulus. Tae-jun supported her body from behind and pushed his middle finger in the wet crack, his other hand squeezed her br*ast. While her size wasn\u2019t satisfying, her hard n*pples were. The crack that held his fingers pulsed as he slightly twisted her n*pple.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euWith a moan, Yuri tried to endure the sensations inside her, with him supporting the entire weight of her body. The sound of splashing water and her moans filled the bathroom, and it was impossible to stop the sounds escaping her mouth no matter how hard she pressed her lips. Tae-jun continued to move his fingers deftly and stroked her n*pples harder\u2026 endless pleasures filled her.\u201cYou\u2019re eating me up, and maybe I can put one more in.\u201d His raspy voice spoke by her ear.His pair of fingers moved like living entities in her, and Yuri held his thrusting hand inside the water.\u201cHaven\u2019t you had enough\u2026?\u201d\u201cYour inside is still slippery, so there seems to be some left.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His fingers filled her to the extent her stomach felt tight, she squeezed her toes to endure the sensations. However, when Tae-jun\u2019s fingers touched her clitoris with force as if to claw her walls, her body jumped, and an explosive sound made by water rang loudly in the bathroom.\u201cAh, ah!\u201dYuri\u2019s eyes filled, and her vision blurred. Something flowed from her as Tae-jun took his fingers out.\u201cI seemed to have made a mistake. This is not mine.\u201dTae-jun put his finger in Yuri\u2019s shaking mouth that was gasping for breath. The thick liquid that mixed with her tongue was definitely not \u2018his\u2019. He rolled his fingers in her mouth until she finished sucking them.He then roughly kissed her\u2013his tongue wrestled with hers until she felt she was about to faint. She couldn\u2019t take it any longer and tapped his chest. Tae-jun reluctantly let go of her lips and made Yuri hold his p*nis in her hand.\u201cSpread out and place it in.\u201dThis was the first time Tae-jun made such a request. Yuri tried to remove her hand with a shake of her head, but he did not allow her to let go.\u201cIf you do it well, I\u2019ll end after once.\u201dYuri had no other choice as Tae-jun had been too much for her when she was healthy. Then, of course, having sex with him in her current state would be near impossible, and Tae-jun had to know her present condition to make such a demand.Yuri carefully slid on her body and adjusted her position. However, she began to hesitate when faced with putting his penis in because it was so big and vicious.Would this go inside her?She could not believe that this man had been inside her before, and even last night seemed to be a dream.Tae-jun pressed with the head of his p*nis, and Yuri felt his pre-cum ooze. She closed her eyes tightly and lowered her hips.With a groan, Yuri felt her body spread out. It was already difficult for her to move only halfway in, and when she tried to pull out, Tae-jun became impatient and roughly pushed inside her.\u201cAh!\u201dYuri let out a shout as she jerked her hips \u2013Tae-jun was fully inside her. She sat on his thighs, her brows furrowed as she felt the flaming shaft penetrate her. It was a size she could not manage no matter how many times he had been inside her, and with her added weight, the pressure was immense.Being inside her seemed to be not enough for Tae-jun, and he pulled her into his arms. Yuri could feel his rapid heartbeat as her chest pressed his.\u2018This is strange.\u2019Yuri stared up at Tae-jun and wondered if this was the heartbeat of the man who was tormenting her without a change in his expression. It might be an illusion, but Tae-jun\u2019s face seemed to be more flushed than usual. Tae-jun opened his mouth as he pushed back Yuri\u2019s wet hair.\u201cMove.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you want to end this quickly?\u201d He grabbed her bottom with a languid expression and slowly moved his hips to find her weakest spots.Yuri awkwardly moved her hips, recollecting the past pleasures a little by little. She had welcomed him in this position, and when he hit a particular spot, she felt a low and steady sensation.She began to move up and down when she felt they were connected, and the water overflowed whenever she moved. While her simple actions were not enough for Tae-jun, her swinging up and down in front of him was an exquisite sight.Tae-jun observed her\u2026 wet and writhing, and bit her br*ast. When he sucked at her n*pple, the contractions her inner walls made aroused him.Tae-jun teased her mercilessly.\u201cLike this, we would do this all day.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euYuri frowned and moved more quickly. She went up until she was almost separated from him before she crouched back. While she was trying her best, her strength ran out quicker than the speed with pleasure mounted her. She buried her face in his shoulder and sighed after moving like that a few times.Tae-jun began to move when he saw Yuri was near her limit. He grabbed her hips and bounced his own, her entire body shook from his thrusts. She instinctively bent her back and jerked her head.Sweet moans escaped from her mouth, and the sounds reverberated much more loudly and lewdly in the bathroom. The sound of splashing water rang everywhere, and the light from the window was heady. Yuri\u2019s head span when she realized that she was being ravished in this bright room, making those noises.She hung onto his shoulders, her nails clawing into his flesh. While she was trying to stop his violent movements, she only aroused him further. He roughly forced her to sit on his lap, she felt she would melt whenever his erection pierced and stirred in her. Whenever he moved, hot water would splatter from where they were connected. She could feel his sharp breath next to her ears.With a shout, Yuri felt her vision go white and shivers down her spine. Tae-jun stopped moving and groaned in a low voice. She could feel hot c*m beating inside her. Her inner walls instinctively contracted not to let a drop go, but some of the c*m that she could not hold fell into the water despite her body\u2019s efforts.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Two still bodies lay entwined basking in the afterglow.Eyes closed, Tae-jun enjoyed the lingering sensations. He had lost count of the women he had, their faces a blank, names long forgotten. And the pleasures they brought\u2026 none could compare to the woman in his arms right now. The more he indulged in her since their reunion, the truth behind his four years of celibacy became jarringly clear: no Yuri, no pleasure.Breathing still ragged, he pressed his lips on the top of her head, then her brow. He held her tightly as if doing so would merge them into one, leaving no gaps whatsoever. His heart was still beating frantically but with a sense of calm that had abandoned him for four years.On the other hand, Yuri limply leaned in his embrace; shallow breathing, closed eyes that were masking her haziness, pallid face, and body wet like cotton, queasy insides\u2026 there was little doubt that the s**ual escapade in the narrow bathtub had sent her into overdrive.Her present condition didn\u2019t escape the culprit\u2019s notice, his brows furrowed. Taking a deep breath, he reluctantly extricated himself from her core. At the sight of the swiftly oozing c*m, his subdued fire, once again, started to rage\u2026 he wanted to thrust himself into her yet another time, ravage her without an end. And yet, giving in to the beast within would only wither the fragile flower.Tae-jun stood up while carefully holding her in his arms. He gently helped her stand in the shower booth. So slack, she could not move a finger. She just let him do as he wished, taking the support of his taut body.His large hands meticulously cleansed her body down, her eyes closed when the hands gently massaged her head. She let go of herself.A memory that she knew not before suddenly resurfaced. She remembered it was the first time she did not feel a shooting pain.It was like this then.On the last day they had spent together four years ago, Tae-jun had brought an exhausted Yuri and washed her himself.\u201cThink about it.\u201dHis low voice had rung in her ears. It was a sweet and gentle voice of a man who was caressing her. His tone then had made her believe that he really wanted her.\u201cI\u2019ll expect an answer on the day I return.\u201dWhat was the question, and what would have been her answer?Yuri\u2019s eyes met Tae-jun\u2019s as she opened them, his gaze was not that of a man who was tormenting her. He kissed her palm as if she was the most valuable treasure in this world.Was this her memory or reality?She could feel his hot breath, and their lips met this time. It was a kiss that seemed to console her swollen lips from the night they spent together and was the gentlest one she had ever received from him.\u2e19Although Tae-jun kept his promise that he would release only once, he still made her give a bl*wjob. His erect*on writhed like it was alive and splattered liquid over her hand and chest.Yuri was lying on the bed when Tae-jun came in with a shopping bag in hand.\u201cWake up and change. We have somewhere to go to,\u201d he said.\u201cWhat about my clothes?\u201d she asked as she started to get up with the help of her hand.\u201cThey\u2019re ruined.\u201d Came the flat reply.At that, she finally remembered her torn blouse. She didn\u2019t jog that memory of her ripped clothing strewn the room over and quickly reached out for the bag.She opened it with a sigh only to find an expensive designer suit complete with shoes and undergarments. She had to wonder when he had prepared all this since even the size was perfect.Once she was dressed and ready, she asked where they were going.\u201cA house.\u201d\u201cHouse? What house?\u201d Yuri asked since she could not understand the meaning of the word.Then suddenly something struck her. \u201cYou can\u2019t mean your own house\u2026\u201d she said tentatively.Tae-jun smirked. \u201cThe house we lived in together. Have you forgotten that? I asked the hotel you\u2019re staying at to check out and send the luggage there, so don\u2019t worry about that.\u201dYuri frowned at his nonchalant reply. The implication of \u2018our house\u2019 surprised her more than the fact that he had gotten the hotel she was staying to check out and send her luggage.They had stayed together in a townhouse on the outskirts of the city. It was a large two-storey building with a basement. Tae-jun had allowed Yuri to use the basement as her workspace where she spent most of her time, that is in his absence. Her daily routine involved watching films on cable, studying English, drawing, and making models except when Tae-jun was home.\u201cThat house\u2026 is still yours?\u201d she asked softly.\u201cYes. I didn\u2019t sell it for no special reason. It\u2019s not the only house I own after all, and there\u2019s a caretaker,\u201d he said tersely before adding, \u201cI didn\u2019t know that I\u2019ll be returning there with you, though.\u201dYuri blinked at him and said no more. Suddenly, she felt a headache coming. She took out a medicine box from her bag. Since the pill also comprised sedatives, she felt her body would escape her control if she were to take it now. But her head was splitting and she knew it would only worsen without the aid of the medicine.\u201cWhat is that pill?\u201d Tae-jun asked as he watched her take the pill.\u201cIt\u2019s for headaches since I have migraines.\u201d She answered.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThis headache was a part of her transient global amnesia, among other things of course. She had started with mild ones before landing on this high-quality drug with drowsiness as the side effect.\u201cYou\u2019re taking too much for only a headache.\u201d He noticed she took more than just one pill.\u201cI also took some vitamins with it.\u201dTae-jun did not speak further. Soon the effects of the medicine kicked in and Yuri started to drowse after only a few minutes in the car. In no time, she was fast asleep.Tae-jun muttered in a low voice as he continued to drive. \u201cVitamins with sleep inducer and anesthetic components.

She dropped her phone, and the face that picked it up was full of despair. The woman ran out to the road without confirming whether she was wearing shoes as the front door closed. The moment a taxi was in front of her, Yuri opened her eyes.I remembered something again!Yuri\u2019s eyes were filled with the red sunset. She must have been sleeping for at least three hours because of the medicine and overexertion of her body. She was alone with her seat rolled back with a man\u2019s jacket covering her like a blanket. She could sense the smell of cigarettes and the man\u2019s essence. Tae-jun was vicious but could be gentle at times too.She organized her thoughts and posed a question on her past self.Where were you trying to go?A whirring sound like a broken machine rang in her head. She did not know the answer, and the headache she\u2019d repressed with the pill started again. Yuri held a hand on her forehead and looked out the window.Where was here?It looked like an outdoor parking lot. Yuri raised her head as she heard a tap on the window to find Tae-jun smoking a cigarette. He crushed the butt with his foot and opened the door of the car bringing in cold air and lingering cigarette smoke.\u201cYou slept long enough,\u201d he said.\u201cYou should have woken me.\u201d\u201cThe pills seem intense. You didn\u2019t wake up when I shook you. I thought I was driving with a corpse next to me.\u201d His words were sans emotions.\u201cI was tired. You know the reason why.\u201d She looked at him accusingly.But when his eyes swept across her, she ignored his gaze as she spoke. \u201cAnyway, weren\u2019t we going to that house? Where is this place?\u201dYuri could not recognize the view no matter how hard she tried.\u201cIt\u2019s nearby. I came here to eat.\u201dYuri had thought she was asleep for three hours, but it may have been more. She followed Tae-jun to a building with modern design like an art museum. The owner and the chef courteously greeted them, and the table they were guided to had already been set with dishware.As soon as they sat, they were served food. \u00a0by Tae-jun must have ordered it while she was sleeping, was the only logic she would come up with. Each dish seemed to be made of the finest ingredients, Yuri was afraid to know the price. Even so, \u00a0she could not swallow it. Her mouth was dry from the medicine.Tae-jun\u2019s brows furrowed at the sight.\u201cShould I ask them to serve us other dishes?\u201d He had clearly misunderstood her reaction.An apologetic voice answered the irritated one. \u201cThere\u2019s no need. I just don\u2019t have any appetite.\u201d\u201cYou know the state your body\u2019s in, right?\u201dHe couldn\u2019t fathom the girl before him. She was frail, she needed food. But instead, she preferred to thrive on the vitamins that contained god knows what and even put her to sleep!\u201cYes. You said I\u2019m too thin for your taste. Come to think of it that would be much better for you and me.\u201d She retorted.\u201cDon\u2019t expect me to let you go for a reason like that.\u201d He warned her. \u201cTry to make me angry if you want to, but there will be consequences.\u201dIn response, Yuri simply lifted her fork again and Tae-jun brought the owner in to order other dishes. While she could not eat meat, she could swallow some of the marinated seafood.The meal ended without any more conversation between them. She felt a headache coming again and fingered the pillbox after she was in the car.\u201cYou\u2019re going to take that pill again?\u201d he asked in disbelief. She had had a bunch of pills not long ago, and now she was ready for more!\u201cMy head hurts.\u201d She replied flatly.She had these bouts of migraines often. There was no helping it and the pills were her only recourse unless she wanted to be tormented endlessly.\u201cNothing good will ever come by taking that sort of medicine.\u201dYuri hurriedly grasped Tae-jun\u2019s hand as he took the pillbox from her.\u201cWhat are you doing? Give it back to me!\u201dYuri\u2019s hand was cold as ice, Tae-jun\u2019s expression darkened. He drew away from her and tossed the pillbox to the backseat.She stared at Tae-jun with resentment. She did not know why he wanted to interfere with this issue since s*x and medicine were not correlated. However, she did not want to stimulate the man, as she would be the one left exhausted. She turned around and watched the view out the window in resignation as the car sped.The townhouse they had lived in together was precisely the same and in the same secure complex consisting of individual houses. Tae-jun passed the garden and entered the front door as if he had only left the house yesterday. Yuri stopped in the garden because of the memory that had only just resurfaced.Tae-jun turned his gaze back to Yuri when he saw that she was not moving.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euYuri shook her head and entered the house perfectly organized by the caretaker. The house was in the exact same state as she remembered. She found herself going back to the first day she had come here. She had lied to her father that she would be living in another artist\u2019s workspace.A housekeeper welcomed Yuri in and showed her room and the things Yuri would be using. The dressing room connected to hers was already full of stuff. Clothes, shoes\u2026 cosmetics had been neatly lined up. She was taken aback, thinking they were another woman\u2019s, but she found that they were all new things with tags still attached. She soon discovered that they were all of her sizes, however, she felt disconcerted when she saw underwear and sanitary products.Tae-jun returned late at night. Unlike the first time, they\u2019d spent quite a long time together. He\u2019d whispered obscene words and Hye-yeon\u2019s name, Yuri\u2019s mind would turn cold everytime, unlike her body.That\u2019s not me. He only wants a puppet and not my heart. Relax, I\u2019m only a doll named \u2018Hye-yeon Jin\u2019.That night, Yuri came numerous times\u2026 but never as herself. Perhaps it was then that she felt her mind and body divided, the boundaries of dreams and reality blur, and the past and present mix.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Neither was there the warmth typically associated withhomenor a sense of unfamiliarity.For some time now, Yuri had been looking around the house dejectedly but when her eyes caught sight of a strange object she stopped. It was a large dog, white fur spotted with yellow-brown, pretty large ears, and a beautiful straight back. It sat on the fireplace mantel in the living room.Ah, why is such a large dog in this house?Yuri took a closer look and immediately stepped back. It was not a living dog but a taxidermied animal!Yuri gasped in surprise because it was the first time she had seen such a delicate specimen, not to mention that it was an everyday dog rather than a bird, deer, or a tiger.Suddenly she felt an arm around her shoulders and Tae-jun, pointing at the stuffed dog said, \u201cAre you surprised? That\u2019s Sebastian. He was a smart and well-trained English Pointer. He was thirteen when he died.\u201dYuri\u2019s face stiffened.\u201cWas he yours?\u201d She barely whispered.\u201cI raised him for over thirteen years from when he was born until he died of old age.\u201d His voice was sans emotions still.\u201cThen why did you taxidermize him?\u201dThe rational thing to do when a treasured pet died was to bury or cremate the body. This was the first time she had seen it so. Needless to say, she found it a little creepy and the man scary.\u201cI want what is mine to remain as it is whenever I want.\u201d Tae-jun answered nonchalantly.Yuri had to wonder what went in this man\u2019s head. She could not understand his actions, such as stuffing his pet dog, maintaining the house as it was, and bringing her here. For the callousness he evinced, his actions were eerily opposite.Yuri swallowed a sigh and asked, \u201cAre my things as they were?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dUpon the reply, Yuri wanted to see the basement she used as her workspace. While it was only a temporary measure for a year, Yuri had drawn and created a lot of things. Since she had lived alone in the house without going out anywhere once, the only thing she could do was to create art.\u201cI want to see the basement.\u201dYuri felt that she could get a hint about her lost memories. However, Tae-jun held her arm with a hand as she turned to the basement.\u201cLater.\u201dTae-jun\u2019s eyes darkened, and Yuri knew what it meant.Without a word, he took off his jacket and threw it on the bed as he entered the bedroom on the second floor. He unbuttoned his shirt and sat on the bed before undoing his fastener.Yuri stood in the doorway as he motioned her to come.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dYuri knew what he wanted, but she wondered who liked sucking another person\u2019s c*ck. Of course, Tae-jun enjoyed licking her down below, but she did not. She stepped closer, forcing her legs to walk.Making her kneel between his legs, he gently stroked the back of her neck.\u201cS*ck.\u201d He commanded.Yuri could never get used to the size and its throbbing veins. She closed her eyes and pressed her lips on his hard length. Once she felt his hand on her nape tighten, she hesitantly opened her mouth. She used her tongue to lick its head and maneuvered her mouth as his erect*on began to get even bigger.He forced her to face upwards as she started to do it.She shook her head with a disapproving sound, but he did not let her go. He did not want to miss a moment of her flushed face. She slapped his hand away when he stroked her cheek, and her insolent actions made him chuckle. She was never the obedient type. Nor was he.Tae-jun jerked his hips in retaliation, and Yuri furrowed her brows as his erect*on scraped her throat.\u201cYou\u2019re still awkward.\u201d He murmured languidly and caressed her hair.He seemed to be enjoying Yuri\u2019s unskilled moves because it confirmed that she had not experienced other men. The hand that had been stroking her hair slid to the earlobe and then went on to undo her blouse. Putting a hand between the slit, he glided on her smooth back before squeezing her mound.Yuri made a sound and looked up at the errant man as he toyed with her hardened assets. He was driving her crazy as he continued to bother her while she was being forced to do something she had little experience in. However, uncaringly, the man continued to play with her small, taut n*pples.\u201cI\u2019ll go on if you don\u2019t do well.\u201d He warned.Yuri placed a hand on his thigh and wrapped the other around the base because she found it difficult to keep her hold as his erect*on began to reach the cl*max. She s*cked him deep enough, her lips almost touching the small hair.The sensations of her dainty tongue groping and wrapping him were exquisite. While it was not enough for him to eject, the sight of her face between his legs and her fervently moving lips drove him in a frenzy. He wanted to grab the back of her head, thrust deep into her throat and let go.Tae-jun imagined Yuri\u2019s expression when he filled her mouth. His own mouth watered when he thought of his c*m dangling from her long eyelashes\u2026 however, now he chose to console her endeavors rather than satisfying his desires. The night was still young, after all.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cLet\u2019s stop there.\u201dTae-jun slowly removed his length. He helped Yuri stand after rubbing it off with his finger. He then positioned her such that she was lying downward against the bed and rolled up her skirt. He slid a finger between the red flesh that revealed itself.Yuri\u2019s body shook, and her juices matted the fiddling fingers. He was satisfied that she had wet herself but was still too dry. The man lowered his lips to between her legs, the woman could not repress a shout.\u201cAh! Ah\u2026\u201dHer spine tingled, her arms swept the bed as she tried to escape the sudden sensations. However, her legs spread on their own accord, and Tae-jun\u2019s head delved deeper.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She put a hand to her mouth as she gaped at the strange sounds she had just made. Tae-jun\u2019s tongue flicked in and out and licked the outer rims before wrapping her cl*toris. She felt faint at the heat that surrounded her sensitive areas, juices continued to flow out of her body.Tae-jun moved his neck making deliberate sucking noises, her small opening flared whenever he did so. He removed his lips with some satisfaction once he\u2019d finished the preparations.With a warning, he grabbed her hips and pushed in his pen*s at once. A burning stake seemed to fill her stomach. She screamed as his pubic hair was pressed on to her bottom. It was always difficult for her at the beginning, no matter how wet she was.Tae-jun put one arm around her and the other on her flat stomach to raise her lower body. They were positioned like animals in heat. Yuri shuddered as she felt even more deeply penetrated. However, she could not move an inch from the pressure that came behind her. She buried her face in the bedsheets and swallowed her moans. However, the man knew exactly what to do to please her.Yuri jerked her hips instinctively whenever he pressed a certain spot, he also felt his limits as he saw her respond to his movements. His nerves were on the edge as her hold on him tightened with each thrust, with that Tae-jun began to roll his hips.As his chest covered her back, her slim body was fully shielded by his. Her muscles contracted when he bit on the neckline partly revealed through the veil formed by her hair. He pushed his hips forward as the sounds of rough breathing, sheets sliding, and flesh meeting flesh rang in his ears.Yuri cried and reached her cl*max, and Tae-jun also came deep inside her. He growled a low groan as he leaned back. Her hold tightened over him again as he moved, he buried his face on her quivering neck\u2026 taking deep breaths in and out.\u201cStop doing that since you can\u2019t endure anymore.\u201dYuri only blinked vaguely as if she had not enough strength to answer. He took off the rest of her clothes, her eyelid lowered as she allowed him to do what he wished.She did not move a muscle even after Tae-jun had finished his shower. He went out of the balcony in front of the bedroom and lit a cigarette. The cold night air was pleasing to his still flushed body.Tae-jun watched Yuri sleep as he leaned on the balcony railing. She was still too weak to satisfy his desires fully. Nonetheless, he felt deep satisfaction as he saw her wreathed in the marks he had left on her fair skin. When he thought of his seed inside her, he was even more exhilarated. The fact she was with him in his space made him happy.Yuri washiswoman, the one who would be forever his and bear his child\u2026Scream!His musings were shattered by a piercing shriek in the quiet night. Taken aback he dropped the cigarette he held. When he looked towards the source, he saw Yuri push herself up with her hands clutching her head.\u201cYuri!\u201dShe was sleeping only a short while ago. But now, her pale face tinged with blue didn\u2019t seem normal. Yuri flew into the bathroom faster than Tae-jun could hold her and threw up violently right after she found the toilet.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? What happened?\u201dTae-jun rubbed her back as she retched everything she had eaten. She was so thin that he could feel each disk of her spine. He watched as she shuddered, sweated profusely, and gasped for breath. He grabbed a bathrobe and placing it on her back continued sliding his hand up and down.It was a while before Yuri was able to speak.\u201cMy head hurts so much,\u201d she said with great effort, \u201cPlease\u2026 bring the pills in the car.\u201dTae-jun remembered the pillbox he\u2019s tossed in the backseat because they seemed too toxic.\u201cWait! Can you do that?\u201dYuri nodded as she sat limply on the ground when the final grain of strength had betrayed her. She threw her head to the back and closed her eyes, her deeply furrowed brows bore testimony to the writhing pain she was in.Tae-jun rushed to the basement parking lot in his bathrobe. The pillbox was right where he\u2019d thrown it in the backseat. Yuri\u2019s condition seemed far more severe than he had imagined. In hindsight, he regretted not heeding to Jin-ho\u2019s advice of a thorough medical examination on the day they met. He felt anger at having ravaged a woman who repeatedly fainted in his arms.When he dashed back with pills and water, an exhausted Yuri had slumped to the bathroom floor. If he didn\u2019t know better, one would think she\u2019s dead at the sight of her ashen face. Tae-jun shook her awake and handed her the pillbox.\u201cTake them, and we\u2019ll go to the hospital.\u201dYuri shook her head weakly and swallowed the pills.\u201cThis happens sometimes.\u201d She mumbled.\u201cWhat is it?\u201dYuri simply closed her eyes as an answer.\u201cI said, what is it!\u201dYuri frowned as Tae-jun held her shoulders and rattled her. She wanted some quiet, she didn\u2019t want to speak\u2026 this man, would he let her be in peace!\u201cIt\u2019s not a disease. This happens whenever a memory turns up.\u201d She muttered between her laborious breaths.\u201cWhat did you remember?\u201d He demanded.Yuri closed her lips tightly.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cLet me rest.\u201d She was losing it. Her eyes were white, lips trembling\u2026Tae-jun gave up trying to talk to her and just held her in his arms. He then carefully laid her on the bed and covered her with a quilt. It was only then, that her expression eased albeit slightly. He stretched out next to her and rested her head on his arm.The woman fell asleep again from the sedatives in her pills, and her pale face looked even more like a corpse.\u201cIf you won\u2019t speak, I\u2019ll have to find out by myself.\u201d Tae-jun murmured with his lips on her forehead.Yuri burrowed into his arms as if she were cold, breathing heavily.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When she did, she noticed there was no sight of the man in the empty room. Instead, a middle-aged woman wearing a nice suit came in and greeted her as she rose.\u201cI hope you had a good night\u2019s sleep.\u201d She smiled politely.\u201cWho are you?\u201d Yuri asked in a hoarse voice as she tried to sit up.\u201cI am Department Head Yun-hee Choi, and I\u2019m in charge of taking care of you while you\u2019re staying here. Please call me Department Head Choi.\u201d The woman still wore a smile.\u201cI don\u2019t need to be taken care of.\u201d Yuri flatly refused, she was no kid needing a sitter.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but that question is out of my jurisdiction. Please discuss it with the director.\u201dYun-hee Choi looked uncomfortable, and if Yuri insisted further, she would be the one in trouble. For now, she suppressed a sigh and instead, stated a question.\u201cWhere is Mr. Tae-jun Seo?\u201d\u201cHe had an early morning. I was told not to wake you up, but I thought you needed to eat.\u201d She smiled again.Yuri looked at the clock and saw it was noon. Yun-hee Choi drew the curtains and went on.\u201cI prepared porridge and soup, and if you have other preferences, I will bring them to you. Is there anything you want to eat?\u201dYuri was a little baffled at the moment. By the woman\u2019s words, there seemed to be another person who had prepared the meals \u2026 she was even told to not wake her up.Why all this attention?The man was a conundrum, he was brutal yet attentive. He would ravage her in bed, but tend to her in his callous ways. For that matter this woman, Yun-hee Choi\u2026 She was definitely not your ordinary housekeeper. She seemed a seasoned hand, someone who had earned her boss\u2019 explicit trust. And here she was, minding an adult in the guise of a butler.Yuri tried to rise from bed but felt faint. She tried to fist her palm, but felt them numb. It\u2019s only now that she remembered she\u2019d thrown up everything she had eaten; her body lacked strength and food right now.Yun-hee Choi brought the meal in with quick sense. She noticed the girl struggling, but said nothing simply going about the motions of serving the food.Yuri sensed her appetite crawl in when she saw the tray of abalone porridge, mushroom cream soup, fruit, and other side dishes. Without a preamble, she slowly started to chew down the food. Right now, her mind was focused on regaining her strength.When Yuri had eaten as much as she could, Yun-hee Choi spoke again.\u201cI\u2019ll come back to you after you\u2019ve washed and dressed. There is a doctor\u2019s examination scheduled.Yuri\u2019s appetite fled top speed at those words. She lowered her spoon, looked at the woman and said in a soft, but assertive tone, \u201cI\u2019m not going to a hospital because there\u2019s no reason to do so.\u201d\u201cHowever, the director\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll tell him myself. I have another errand to run.\u201d Her stance was loud and clear, she wouldn\u2019t budge.\u201cAll right.\u201d Yun-hee Choi could only step back.Yuri took off her gown in the bathroom after the housekeeper went out with the tray. The red marks and fingerprints on her body reminded her of Tae-jun and the times they spent in bed. She remembered his tongue that ravaged her, the strength that held her, and his body that drove her to sensual pleasures. She breathed in deep and tightly shut her eyes seemingly ridding herself of the thoughts.She waited until the bathtub filled, stepped in and sat with her knees drawn up making herself as small as possible. As the warm water seeped into the nooks and crannies of her body, her sore muscles started to slowly relax. However, her mind was another matter.Right now, the memories she\u2019d retraced the night before, inundated her, wreaking havoc in her consciousness. The voices tormented her, a part of her wanted to shut them out, but another part bravely confronted it \u2026 it was a conversation.\u2013What idiot lost her? The b*tch\u2019s intoxicated with drugs!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u2013There\u2019s an idiot with bloodshot eyes who wanted a chance at the pretty girl. She was smart, whispering that she would let him do as he wished and then escaped. Well, things turned out well since we are going to profit from that idiot. The more important thing is whether President Jin\u2019s daughter is not around.\u2013 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve confirmed that the red sportscar is not nearby.

Like father, like daughter.Then, Yuri heard doors break down and felt a heady shock like someone had hit her on the head.A stream of tears trickled down Yuri\u2019s eyes, and she finally realized what the conversation was about \u2026 her father\u2019s death. She had vaguely believed he had been in an accident, but it was not true for her father and Hye-yeon Jin. And she was now certain she had stumbled upon an important puzzle piece.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The agony was too hard to endure, her heart ached so much that she felt it would burst out of her chest any moment now.When she had felt she had cried her heart out, crimson-eyed, she trudged out of the bathroom. Unhurriedly she changed her clothes and sat at the dressing table. The mirror who looked back at her through the mirror seemed like a ghost- ashen, desolate and helpless. She looked at her woodenly for a while, then slowly brushed her long tresses and put on makeup \u2026 perhaps this would conceal the despair within.When Yuri finally went downstairs, Yun-hee Choi approached her from the living room.\u201cWhere are you going?\u201dYun-hee Choi looked surprised when she saw Yuri, which was only natural as her eyes were swollen and bloodshot.\u201cI have somewhere to go.\u201d Yuri replied in a downcast voice.\u201cI\u2019ll get the car ready.\u201d The woman hastily made for it, but the next words brought her to a halt.\u201cI want to go alone.\u201dTaken aback, the housekeeper gazed at the pathetic figure before her, but evinced no sympathy. \u201cYou cannot,\u201d she said matter-of-factly and moved to block the front door.Seeing that there was no room for negotiation on this matter, Yuri simply went straight to the waiting car. Yun-hee Choi handed her an ice pack from who knows where.\u201cUse this.\u201dYuri smiled listlessly and received an ice pack.The middle-aged driver wore a suit and asked with respect, \u201cMadam, where would you like to go?\u201dThe word Madam sounded strange to Yuri. She could feel Yun-hee Choi listening in as she saw her off.She reclined on the seat, put the ice pack on her eyes and vacantly said, \u201cThe Daejin Department Store please.\u201dYun-hee Choi wished Yuri a good trip, and the driver smoothly put the car in motion after the door closed.By and by, as the coolness soothed her burning eyes, she delved deep into thoughts. She was seeking the truth that had long been eluding her, hiding in the deepest crevices of her mind, refusing to surface at her command \u2026 tantalizing and torturing her. But now that had decidedly moved in the direction to confront it, it seemed to readily come to her.Who were they?The only clue she had was their voices, and there was no way of knowing who they were. Neither were they familiar nor decent. But one thing was certain, all this was connected; her father\u2019s death, her lost time, Hye-yeon Jin\u2019s death.She was wading through an intricate web of deceit and lies that would only grow treacherous with each step. The question was not whether she could uncover the truth, but if she could bear the burden of it all when she reached it.No matter what, she could not turn back now. The only way out was through. She decided to investigate her father\u2019s accident, and to do so, needed to go to Jinseong City. There would surely be an officer who was in charge of the case in the police station, and she was determined to meet him.The driver parked in the Daejin Department Store VIP parking lot when Yuri\u2019s swollen eyes had become a little less evident.\u201cMy shopping will take some time.\u201d Yuri spoke carefully.\u201cPlease shop as long as you wish, Madam. Shall I accompany you?\u201d The diligent chauffeur offered.\u201cNo, I want to do it alone since I have some personal items in mind. Please wait here.\u201d She tactfully declined.\u201cI understand. Please call me on this number when you finish your shopping.\u201d The driver politely handed her his card.Soon after, Yuri went to the VIP elevator. However, she went to the lobby instead of the VIP lounge to go to the back gate and hail a taxicab. The taxi driver merrily stepped on the accelerator with a smile when she told him to go to Jinseong City as it was lucky for him to find a long-distance customer at midday.Yuri connected her cell phone as it had run out of battery on a portable battery in the taxi. She first confirmed missed calls and messages and left a message for Roy Jean. Thereon, she spent the rest of the drive managing work regarding her contract with the Daejin Department Store.The taxi arrived in front of the Jinseong Police Station after about an hour. Getting off the cab, Yuri stared at the building for a while contemplating until she caught sight of the Public Service Center. She hoped that the detective in charge of her father\u2019s case or Hye-yeon\u2019s still worked here.A few men came down the stairs just as she was about to press the sliding door button to enter the department. She could hear their voices as they were in conversation behind her.\u201cI thank you for your efforts Chief. Our governor has been worried about this issue.\u201d A cheerful voice floated.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cHe should not be worried about trivial matters like this when he is heading for greater things. We will handle this problem as we had done so when he was the mayor.\u201d A man reassured.\u201cOf course! The governor knows Chief\u2019s efforts. Things will be better in the future.\u201dThey were laughing as they went out of the station while Yuri stood frozen in front of the door. Her eyes span, and the only thing that was clear for her was the voice she had just heard.\u2013That b*tch is fierce and tiresome. Like father, like daughter.It was the same voice that had been talking with the police chief just now.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She desperately repressed a queasy feeling churning inside her as she broke out in a cold sweat.Just then, a policeman approached her probably because he thought a shaking woman standing in front of the door looked out of place.\u201cIs there a problem?\u201d he asked.\u201cNo, I\u2019m just unwell.\u201d Yuri shook her head and went back the way she had come.She finally knew who was behind the threats made to her uncle \u2013 In-bae Lee, the former mayor of Jinseong City and the current governor of Gyeonggi Province. The police had moved strictly under his orders from when he was the mayor of Jinseong, so Yuri could not trust the police if he was behind all this.But why?As far as she remembered, In-bae Lee and President Jin were in a symbiotic relationship, and Yuri\u2019s father and Hye-yeon were President Jin\u2019s people. So why did In-bae Lee go after them? Tae-jun had told her that President Jin was also dead, and In-bae Lee could be the culprit.As she processed the new-found information, affirming and negating, her head gradually started to hurt. She, as soon, closed her eyes, and covered them with her hand. But the wheels in her mind refused a respite.What problems had arisen between In-bae Lee and President Jin?There was no other explanation as to why the two most savage villains of their times, running the most profitable organized crime syndicate in the city, had gone after each other\u2019s throats.If she wanted to make any progress in this matter, she had to take this detour and find out what went down between the two big bullies. And there was only one person who would know the truth of this matter.Hye-seong!When Yuri opened her eyes she knew where she had to go next.\u2e19 \u2e19 \u2e19\u201cYou lost your memories?\u201d Hyeon-ah Kim lowered her coffee cup in astonishment.Once she had zeroed in on the person she could gather info from, Yuri had headed straight to Hyeon-ah Kim\u2019s caf\u00e9. This former associate had welcomed her because she had only been looking at her cell phone.Then, Yuri had gone on to explain her situation in a calm voice. Even so, the shock the other felt was genuine and but natural.\u201cIs this the \u2018Where am I?\u2019, \u2018Who am I?\u2019 situation we see in tv shows?\u201d she asked in incredulity.Yuri didn\u2019t take those words as ridicule for anyone would react just the same. Amnesia, after all, was more rampant in fiction than in reality. More often than not, people in real life would always think the other was faking it, it was just that implausible.She shrugged before continuing in a soft voice. \u201cYou can say that. In my case, I don\u2019t remember as far as from my father\u2019s accident to the beginnings of the time I spent in America. My doctor says that it\u2019s not uncommon to forget a certain period, a certain person, or a certain incident.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the cause? Were you in a car accident?\u201d Hyeon-ah queried. She was no medico to have in-depth knowledge, but she had enough common sense to discern that such an incident always fell in the \u2018response to stimulus\u2019 category. For a perfectly normal young girl to abruptly wake up without memories, there had to be a grave reason.\u201cI don\u2019t know since I don\u2019t remember. My diagnosis is transient global amnesia, which occurs due to psychological shock instead of an external accident.\u201dYuri\u2019s memory loss was a defense mechanism of her body to avert the greater harm. As to what that harm was, it was what she needed to find out.\u201cYou really don\u2019t know anything from that time?\u201dHyeon-ah still had her suspicions, and Yuri was hesitant to trust her enough to discuss the doubts surrounding her father and Hye-yeon\u2019s death. The woman before her went a long way, she not only knew her father but also President Jin\u2019s family.Even so, for an inexplicable reason, she felt something stuck in her throat, forbidding her from sharing anything more. It was an omen she could not elucidate, but one that she could not ignore either. Thus, she swallowed down her thoughts and schooled her expression.\u201cYes, so you can imagine my surprise when I heard what happened to Hye-yeon, and that I was the last person to see her before she died. Can I know more about her death?\u201d She deftly steered the topic in another direction.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cI don\u2019t know much \u2018cause I only heard Hye-yeon talk to you over the phone. She was discovered at the Jinseong River later.\u201d She stated nonchalantly.\u201cWas an autopsy performed on Hye-yeon?\u201d\u201cI believe there wasn\u2019t. The circumstances made it unnecessary, and President Jin said he would not do so.\u201d Hyeon-ah took out a cigarette and lit it.\u201cWhat happened to President Jin? I heard that he was involved in a gang dispute.\u201dTaking a long drag, Hyeon-ah puffed out, her vacant gaze trailing the wafting smoke. \u201cOn the surface, yes. I personally think In-bae Lee had something to do with it since they were bitter enemies after the Star Road incident.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The two were privy to each other\u2019s dirty secrets and had arrived at a precarious pact. Thus, each was using the other as one\u2019s tool, but the upside was they were both profiting from it. At least until they had friction.Myung-je Jin was a wily old fox who had more underhanded means than he let on. Yuri was certain that his man must have had something up his sleeve that led to the two biggest bullies falling out. And if she wished to obtain the details of the transaction to the last letter, she knew just the person.\u201cAre you still in contact with Hye-seong?\u201d Yuri asked.\u201cMr. Hye-seong Jin? What about him?\u201d Hyeon-ah quirked her eyebrow.\u201cI want to know more about Hye-yeon. I might have heard her last words if I was the last one to meet her before she died.\u201dHyeon-ah was silent for a moment and slowly shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t know about Mr. Hye-seong Jin. He disappeared after President Jin\u2019s death.\u201dIs she telling the truth?Yuri could not think of a reason as to why Hyeon-ah would keep things from her if she knew something about the man in question. And given the circumstances surrounding that incident, it was only an eventuality for the president\u2019s son, and sole survivor of the Jin family to go into hiding.She sipped her coffee while shaking her head slightly. She had met her first obstacle too soon.Where would she find Hye-seong Jin if he were off the grid? Is there another way to gather information about President Jin?A pensive Yuri, at the moment, was oblivious to Hyeon-ah\u2019s scrutinizing gaze on her.After a moment or so, the other woman suddenly asked, \u201cHey, didn\u2019t you say that you were going back to America?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll be staying in Korea for now because I have to wrap up some things here.\u201d She answered vaguely.\u201cWhere are you staying?\u201dYuri hesitated for a moment before answering. \u201cI\u2019m staying with a person I know in Seoul.\u201d\u201cThen give me a card or your phone number, and I\u2019ll ask the people I knew in the hotel to see if anyone knows about Mr. Hye-seong Jin.\u201d She offered.Yuri instantly brought out her card from the bag, Hyeon-ah leaned forward to receive it, her voice barely a whisper. \u201cDoes he have anything to do with the things you have to finish?\u201dYuri glanced at the window and thought her breath stopped. There was a classy car, a foreign make, in front of the caf\u00e9, and a debonair Tae-jun was smoking a cigarette leaning against it.Before she knew it, amidst an eerie silence, the man shoved her into the passenger seat and roughly cranked up the engine. She could see Hyeon-ah look out the store window with worried eyes.As they sped past, Yuri looked straight ahead and wondered how Tae-jun had found her so quickly.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d she asked, breaking the jittery silence\u201cI told you. I dislike variants.\u201d He roared.Yuri\u2019s eyelids fluttered, and Tae-jun reached out to fasten her seatbelt.\u201cI want to know why you had to lie, saying you would go shopping instead of going to the hospital.\u201dEven under his piercing gaze, Yuri was quite resolute about not going to the hospital. \u201cI know my body. The problem I have is with my memories.\u201dShe had been undergoing treatment, knew everything she had to, what more could a doctor tell her?\u201cSo, you came here to find them? What\u2019s the reason for this sudden decision?\u201d Tae-jun demanded.\u201cIt\u2019s not a sudden one. I\u2019ve tried before but nothing worked. However, since I remembered you somewhat easily, I thought it might be the same for others.\u201dTae-jun drummed his fingers on the wheel. Yuri turned her gaze to the window under the uncomfortable silence. They were passing by the beautiful and deep Jinseong River, she felt a chill all over as she remembered Hye-yeon\u2019s death.Judging by their conversation, Hye-yeon had not been the target. So why did she die, and what was the reason In-bae Lee wanted to kill me?The question overwhelmed her. One question only ushered in several more, and Yuri felt more helpless than when she could not remember a thing. Closing her eyes, she endured the incoming headache. She did not know how much time passed until Tae-jun stopped at an exclusive Japanese restaurant.\u201cLet\u2019s go, we\u2019ll be having dinner here.\u201dSo, it was already dinnertime. An employee guided them to a reserved room when Yuri got out of the car. It was a large one, and the scenery of the pond in the garden, and the simple pavilion was beautiful. The folding screen and the interiors of the room hinted at money.The food placed on delicate and expensive dishes was exquisite. Yuri strived to eat digestible food as much as she could. She had to eat to have enough strength to go through what lay before her. Also, she did not want to offend Tae-jun by not eating.Thankfully, he only placed certain dishes on her plate and did not speak.Yuri was surprised as the food he served her were those she thought delicious.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe waiter brought fruits, sweet red bean jelly, and warm tea for dessert. Tae-jun made a phone call once the server had left the room.\u201cBring it here.\u201dThe paper panel door opened after a little while, and a man with short hair, sharp eyes, and a well-trained body walked in with an envelope in hand. When he got closer, Yuri recognized him as Jin-wook Jeong.Jin-wook handed Tae-jun the envelope and slightly bowed to Yuri before going out. The man then handed the documents over to Yuri.\u201cRead it.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

And you\u2019re still asking me to bear your child?\u201d She retorted.\u201cWhat\u2019s the problem? I\u2019ll recognize the child as mine and provide the best environment and education there is.

She laughed and glared at him. Did he really weigh the world in terms of money?! Where the heck had his demented notion stemmed from?She had been goaded into signing the contract once before, did he think there would be a second time? This was simply outrageous, and she didn\u2019t want any part in it. Not now, not ever.She gritted her teeth and said, \u201cI will never bear your child, so there\u2019s no need for this nonsense.\u201d\u201cYou might already have one, or there will be one in the near future.\u201d Tae-jun\u2019s hawk-eyes seemed absolutely determined.\u201cI haven\u2019t had a period for two years, so there will never be a child.\u201dPerhaps this was her way of saying that he couldn\u2019t control everything in the world, and most certainly her menstrual cycle.\u201cWhat?!\u201d He bellowed.Tae-jun\u2019s brow furrowed, he didn\u2019t like her attitude. More importantly, he disdained things that went out of his control and even so those that played him. And right now, the woman before him was doing exactly that. She had done so four years ago, and she was doing so now. He would tolerate nothing, especially her slipping out of his grip.He brusquely grabbed Yuri\u2019s wrist on the table and demanded. \u201cAnd you say that you\u2019re not going to the hospital?\u201dYuri did not avoid his penetrating gaze and boldly looked right into his devilish orbs. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of my body, and to make things clear, I am not going to agree to a contract like this.\u201d\u201cAre the terms not enough for you?

His harsh and cold eyes, filled with the murderous rage of a beast, bored at her.\u201cWas I not enough for you?\u201d He sniggered.She had enough of this man now, him and his twisted theories. She was furious. Just because she had entered a contract with him, he was questioning her integrity now.

However, he was the man himself, perhaps in his truest form.Fifty-five-year-old Seok-ha Yoo, a famous Western-style painter had won many accolades in the world of paintings and held a prestigious status in Korea and abroad. He was Yuri\u2019s advisory professor, the very one to openly demand s3xual gratifications in return for establishing her career in the realm of arts.However, when the girl had refused his \u2018kind\u2019 offer, he had spared no effort to torment her.

Seok-ha sneered as he looked back and forth between the man and Yuri.\u201cMadam? Ah, Yuri Han, you\u2019ve climbed the ladder. If you\u2019re being called madam and going to this kind of place, you must have secured a man after giving up painting.

Door after door he opened, room after room he checked; the entire second floor was scoured and he found not a shadow of the girl.He made down the stairs, jabbing his memory about the places she could be in, her former habits. It was then that it struck him that when they\u2019d lived together, she would often spend time in the basement, painting, sketching, or doing something else. She was never the one to rest her hands.Tae-jun loosened his tie and opened the basement door. He had been using it as a private home bar and wine cellar, but Yuri had used it as her workspace.The basement was dark, so he turned on the lights but did not see her. He felt a strange premonition just before he turned the lights off, closed the door again, and moved towards the bar at the corner. He saw something in the small space inside the bar table.Soon he was facing a Yuri who sat huddled, her face buried in her lap.\u201cI never knew you had a penchant for hide-and-seek.\u201dShe didn\u2019t move until Tae-jun opened his mouth.

Her dry laugh annoyed him, and he held her hand grasping the glass that was en route to her lips.\u201cStop. You\u2019ve had enough,\u201d he said, sternly.\u201cWhat\u2019s the problem? You\u2019ll be having your way.\u201dHe wrested the glass and put it on the table. He helped her stand up, her weightless body folding into his arms.

However, he called me to his workspace before an exhibition and told me to take my clothes off. He then asked me whether I wanted to be his Camille Claudel.\u201dCamille Claudel was Rodin\u2019s student and muse. Tae-jun\u2019s expression grew stony when he understood the meaning.

No one said a word nor did he stop her from crying.A long while passed, and the girl had cried herself to sleep. Sensing that she had quieted down, Tae-jun carefully held her in his arms and brought her to the bedroom.

One, this man wasn\u2019t related to this matter whatsoever; two, he was already a bully interfering in her life and she hated him for that. Besides, they had about two months left, and it would end earlier if she found her memories.Fortunately, Tae-jun did not speak of what happened that day. He seemed to be busy, coming late at night and going out early. Also, he did not brandish the contract or ask her to lie with him. It had never been this peaceful in his presence, or rather his absence.After downing the medicines, Yuri went to the living room and turned on the TV. Her eyes met Sebastian\u2019s, who she could not decide was sitting or adorning the corner of the living room. She wondered whether the dog was happy or sad.And when she thought deeper, she realized she couldn\u2019t tell the difference between a taxidermied dog and her current situation. After all, she was only an item to collect for Tae-jun Seo.The lingering bitterness of the medicine was still in her mouth, drawing her attention back to now. She turned her gaze away from Sebastian, her thoughts were now on In-bae Lee who was scheduled to be on television.In the past few days, she had not been idle. Slowly but surely she had scraped together information on him after having discovered that the owner of the voice in Jinseong City was the governor\u2019s underling.This man was the proverbial rag to riches story. Born to a poor factory workman, In-bae Lee did not receive proper education and instead worked at a plant. Rendered immobile due to an industrial accident, he had managed to pass the high school qualification exam. Right after graduation, he took up the judicial examinations and went on to become a lawyer. And in just a year, he had been elected as the youngest city councilor in the history of Jinseong City.In-bae Lee and President Jin\u2019s prosperous association had probably begun from thereon. Twice he was elected the city councilor and congressman. He served as the mayor for two consecutive terms and was now the governor of the Gyeonggi Province. He had been widely touted as the most influential presidential candidate.But why would a man like him try to kill me?Yuri could not see a connection, and there were limits to the information she could find at home on the internet.What should I do?As she mulled, she almost dropped the remote controller as she changed the channel. She stilled when she saw a familiar name on the news.\u2e19<A beginning of the Me-Too Movement in the Art Industry: Artist Seok-ha Yoo accused of s3xual abuse.>Yuri abruptly got to her feet in shock. On the screen right now was a group of women, of varied ages, exposing the savage brutality of the revered Seok-ha Yoo. One by one, the women were recounting their horrific tales, breaking down as they did.Toe the line or be buried in obscurity- each woman was threatened, coerced, and shoved to the brink of helplessness. One would argue that they should have stood their ground and not yielded, but only those who were in it knew that they had tried and failed miserably.Who would willingly jump into a pit of fire? Between the struggle to eke out even the simplest living and trading one\u2019s body with the villain in return for a roof on one\u2019s head, what would one choose? Besides, who would believe them, help or hear their plea? It was their, a nobody\u2019s, word against the celebrated professor\u2019s.How did this happen?When she was a student, a Me-Too movement would\u2019ve been impossible to end up making any progress no matter how hard she tried. Firstly, she wouldn\u2019t have the support of the fellow victims who would be scared to go against the man. If they weren\u2019t afraid of him, to begin with, why else would he have had his way? Secondly, even if one or two did brave it, they would have hardly lasted what with the backing this man had. It would be a miracle if they would make it to the court alive.With an atmosphere that publicly acknowledged the existence of sponsors and patrons, Seok-ha Yoo\u2019s actions were nothing peculiar. This barter seemed to exist from time immemorial.Willingly or unwillingly, people had ended up in this situation. Also, when it came to the morality of the rich and famous, the public had a tendency to turn a blind eye toward the victims. They would even go as far as to recriminate the aggrieved party which would be worse than the harassment one had been through.So then, what broke the norm?The news was now showing a middle-aged woman with her head deep down. She could be identified as the sitting chairman of the Fine Arts Association and the chief director of the H School of Fine Arts. She stated deep grievance on the issue surrounding Professor Seok-ha Yoo and promised to compensate the victimized students. She also calmly stressed that the fine arts field would try its best to prevent such horrendous events from recurring ever again.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euManager Choi let out a gentle gasp as she watched the TV with plates of fruits and dessert in her hands\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Yuri asked.\u201cShe tends to dislike appearing on TV. Is something going on? Are there issues at the school?\u201d\u201cDo you know who she is?\u201d\u201cOf course, she\u2019s our director\u2019s mother.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Not many people visited this place, so it was relatively peaceful and slow.Eyes closed, a towel covering the face, reclined, Tae-jun was attentively listening to the news streaming on the TV. Since the art industry had stayed out of controversy unlike the movie community and the athletic field, the accusations against Yoo were being excitedly broadcast with deep insight on the crimes of the once renowned artist.Jin-wook started talking as he brushed off his sweat with a towel. \u201cThe impact of the current issue is slated to be greater than expected.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s no surprise. It\u2019s a wonder how silent everyone has been until now. Rape, assault, painting fraud \u2026 he\u2019s done so much to ruin the students\u2019 lives.\u201d\u201cStill, I didn\u2019t expect you to reach out to your mother first.\u201d Jin-wook remarked.\u201cWhat\u2019s so weird about a son calling his mother?\u201d Tae-jun retorted.\u201cBecause it\u2019s never occurred until now.\u201dAs much as Tae-jun blamed his father for ruining the peaceful childhood that he had had, he bore a deep resentment toward his mother too. She had, without batting an eyelid, relinquished him like he were an object in her possession and not her son. And what child could endure his parents\u2019 abandonment?He had taken a stand right there and then. Gone was the affection he had for his mother, and instead, he treated her as a stranger. He wouldn\u2019t talk to her when they met, which would be mostly in a public setting, behaving like associates. Those who didn\u2019t know better would never be able to connect them as such.That said, the man had never called his mother, not when he was a twelve-year-old in need of motherly affection nor upon attaining adulthood as filial piety. He had behaved like she didn\u2019t exist in this world, rather his world. So, this sudden change would solely be attributed to Yuri.\u201cIt was necessary. I could\u2019ve handled things my way but that wouldn\u2019t suffice. Let karma slit his own throat. I wish Yoo would lose his entire career, be shunned by his loved ones, and helplessly crawl on the ground like a limbless bug.\u201d\u201cIf the chief director has resigned, then it seems impossible for Yoo to come back to that field for a while.\u201d\u201cFor a while?\u201d Tae-jun scoffed audibly. \u201cImpossible \u2026 forever \u2026 because he\u2019s going to have his wrist chopped off from a very unfortunate accident. There\u2019s no way he\u2019ll be holding a paintbrush ever again. That\u2019s how I roll. \u201dHis voice was low enough to instantly cool down the steamed room. Tae-jun asked Jin-wook as he ran his hand through his moist hair, \u201cAnd about my request?\u201d\u201cIt was a car crash. The victim jumped towards the car intoxicated. The driver was sentenced for a year and a half and is currently out of prison.\u201d\u201cA year and a half? Why so short?\u201d The man was surprised.\u201cThe driver confessed, and the accident occurred on a very isolated road without any cameras or streetlights in sight. Most essentially, there was a witness who stated that the victim threw himself to the car first. Moreover, the toxicity report showed exceedingly high levels of alcohol in his blood system. The initial sentence was to serve three years but the extenuation of the case shortened it.\u201dTae-jun ruminated on what Yuri had said.He hadn\u2019t believed Hye-seong Jin entirely when he said everything was about \u2018money.\u2019 The woman that he had observed was full of pride and far from materialism. She was also extremely conservative when it came to s3x. And the father whom she tried to protect so desperately, going so far as to throw aside her self-respect and sell her body, had jumped toward a car intoxicated.Was this what actually happened?\u201cWhat about the black box?\u201d\u201cIt was coincidentally out of order that day so the power was turned off.\u201d\u201cLogically, none of this makes any sense. There was a witness on a road without any cameras, black boxes, or even streetlights?\u201cIt seems suspicious to me too. But what\u2019s fishier is that the driver who hit the man has worked on In-bae Lee\u2019s election campaign.\u201d\u201cHmm, In-bae Lee gets involved once again.\u201dIt was a name that kept coming up during the investigation of Yuri\u2019s case.Why In-bae Lee instead of Myung-je Jin? What sort of contact did Yuri and In-bae Lee ever have?Jin-wook seemed to be asking the same question. \u201cMy instincts are telling me that there\u2019s something more to this accident. But it would do you no good to have beef with In-bae Lee. After All, he is the strongest presidential candidate.\u201dAs long as the Seoin Group kept its major business in the defense industry, it would always be correlated with politicians. Lee\u2019s speech about increasing the military budget made him the most supported individual by the conservatives. It was crucial to stay on the same wavelength with a soon-to-be man of authority. But Tae-jun was without the slightest doubt.\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter.\u201d He declared flatly.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cI understand, Sir. I\u2019ll take a deeper look into Suwon Han\u2019s accident.\u201dEverything was hazy at the moment. What was at the end of all of this? Whatever it was, as long as it was related to Yuri he was never going to stop investigating. To be more exact, he wouldn\u2019t be able to stop himself.Tae-jun spoke as he was reminded of something. \u201cAnd did you meet the owner of the building?\u201d\u201cYes, Sir. He said he\u2019ll sell it for 50 million more.\u201d\u2e19\u2e19\u2e19Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Why are you suddenly so interested in the building?\u201d Jin-wook said.\u201cI was thinking about giving it to Yuri Han.\u201dJin-wook looked briefly surprised before his brow furrowed. \u201cHas Ms. Han agreed to this?\u201d\u201cThe one thing I know for sure is that she has high bars for her career. Once she gets her own gallery and starts regaining the opportunities she lost because of Seok-ha Yoo, she might change her mind about this.\u201d Tae-jun seemed quite positive about her changing her mind.But his retainer didn\u2019t seem to share the boss\u2019 views. \u201cI doubt it, Sir. If she could be swayed by something like this, I don\u2019t think she would have resisted Seok-ha Yoo.\u201dTouch\u00e9!Jin-wook\u2019s words had hit home the bitter truth and Tae-jun was forced out of excuses. \u00a0The latter knew that such things had little effect on Yuri. Even so, he wanted to be assured that he\u2019d be able to make her stay beside him.How could he not understand the other\u2019s intention? Jin-wook gave out a small sigh. \u201cIf all you want is for Yuri to stay beside you, you\u2019re already doing a great job. Otherwise, just try to have dirt on her uncle in America or Roy Jean. Just like President Jin did.\u201dTae-jun frowned at the hint of poignance in Jin-wook\u2019s voice, unlike his normal, impassive tone.Nevertheless, the man ignored his boss\u2019 displeasure, and stubbornly continued on with his opinion. \u201cIf not, you need to earn her trust. You need to make Yuri Han herself long for you Sir.\u201dThere was no rebuttal to that. Tae-jun stood up with a stiff face.As they got out of the sauna, the duo bumped into a group of employees moving frames covered in fabric.Tae-jun asked Jae-won, \u201cWhat is that?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re changing up the paintings in the banquet hall.\u201d\u201cFor what?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you see the news? Artist Seok-ha Yoo is in deep trouble. We bought these a couple of years ago for a really high price and it\u2019s making me regret it big time. I don\u2019t know, maybe we got lucky since we chose to display Roy Jean\u2019s work instead of Seok-ha Yoo\u2019s art at the very last minute.\u201d Jae-won put his hand on his forehead as if it ached.\u201cHow are things at Hotel Seoin?\u201d\u201cMother was never fond of Seok-ha Yoo\u2019s artwork so I doubt she ever owned any. The problem is Si-yeon Yoon. She even collaborated with Yoo for the merchandise last year.\u201dJae-won\u2019s reply reminded Tae-jun of Si-yeon for the first time in a while. That woman was a flawless fianc\u00e9e. She was the goose that would lay golden eggs for Hotel Seoin. Growing up in a similar environment and being friends ever since childhood, the two felt comfortable around each other. He especially liked the fact that she did not expect any \u2018affection\u2019 or \u2018care\u2019 from him. All he needed was to put on a show of a \u2018perfect marriage\u2019 for everyone to see, and this woman seemed to be a sufficient fianc\u00e9e for this act. Nothing needed to be changed because of Yuri Han\u2019s existence. There were various ways to keep her alongside.How do I earn her affection?He had already gotten off to a bad start with Yuri. He had forced her to stay with him, but he was still very clueless about the woman. If he could, he wanted to dissect every part of her to fully understand her.Slowly, he approached the sleeping beauty. He stroked her face ever so gently as if he were touching fragile glassware.

She had stumbled upon this piece of information when she was mindlessly sifting through the women\u2019s magazine at a hair salon one afternoon. Most pages of the magazine were filled with the upcoming nuptials of Seoin Group and Daejin Group.Hyeon-ah meticulously read through the article. She remembered him perfectly well. After all, how could she forget an attractive face like his?When exactly was it \u2026 the Asian Games a few years back?The wealthy and good-looking shooter who was a hot topic back then happened to be the same person. She also realized that she\u2019d seen him visit Hotel Jinseong a few times, although it was much later that she found out that he did so with an intention to purchase the hotel.Back then he\u2019d used a different name. Perhaps, \u00a0that doesn\u2019t matter so much?So, what did the Seoin scion have to do with the insignificant Yuri Han?How were they associated in the first place? It was kind of obvious that their relationship was nothing typical. The silence between them felt nerve-wracking and breathtaking to watch. To flirt with a guy like him, Yuri must have a game.Hyeon-ah leaned back and stared at the ceiling with a cigarette between her lips. As she mulled, she recalled what Yuri had told her.Was this all true, or was the story fabricated?Smoke gradually escaped her lips.No memory? \u2026 Things are getting very interesting.Her musing was interrupted by the sound of a door opening.\u201cI\u2019m sorry but the caf\u00e9 is closed for the day.\u201dAs she was turning, she froze at the sight of the unexpected guest waiting for her. Her red lips immediately lifted up into a hearty grin. She did not seem to be startled even in the slightest bit.\u201cOh my, I\u2019m seeing so many unexpected faces these days.\u201dStanding at the door was Hye-seong Jin.\u2e19That night, Yuri did everything but sleep. In truth, she had not been sleeping from the start. \u00a0Once he had sedately closed the door behind him, and she was certain he had left, did she open her eyes and gazed at the door.Before he had walked into the room, she was at the peak of researching In-bae Lee\u2019s acquaintances. She was able to acquire most of the information from his fairly \u2018active\u2019 social media. Most of it was glorified, but those who knew to read between the lines would sniff out the shenanigans at a glance. The old newspaper reports from Jinseong City and the data from the City Hall collectively offered her abundant facts about the man.Among Lee\u2019s family, assistants, bodyguards, and election camp members, one of them had to be the owner of the voice she was desperately looking for. That person was most likely the suspect. However, the labor of searching for this mysterious man was intolerably arduous and dull.A male in his 40s or 50s, relatively tall who happened to live in Jinseong for a significant amount of years: this was basically the only material Yuri had on him. And sifting through the thousands of Lee-followers on social media, matching their pictures with their names was nothing short of looking for a needle in a haystack. After quite a few hours scouring, she recognized a very familiar name.Sang-gu Park \u2026Park was a manager at an NGO owned by Lee\u2019s wife. She swore she recognized the name \u2026but from where?It was at that moment, she heard the main door unlock. She reckoned Tae-jun must have returned. She quickly locked her laptop and lay in her bed. She was hoping he would sleep in his own room just as he had done for the past few days.As if he was ignoring her hope, the man opened her door. She instinctively shut her eyes and pretended to be asleep. She could hear him walk towards her, and sit at the corner of the bed. His long fingers gently brushed away her hair from her face, then traced along her forehead, nose, and down to her lips \u2026 It felt unnecessarily soothing and also uncomfortable and painful at the same time. It felt even more awkward than when she was stripped, legs pulled wide apart, pressed underneath his body.He had stayed beside her for a long time caressing her cheeks. She couldn\u2019t tell what the man was thinking, but she was constantly on the edge.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAfter she was left alone again in the room, she blinked. His warmth and aroma lingered in the air.What if she hadn\u2019t barged into his room to help out a customer that day? What if she\u2019d never pretended to be Hye-yeon Jin? What if she\u2019d never resolved the misunderstanding he had about the father? Then would things have been different? What if \u2026 what if \u2026.One thought led to another and another until a whole train was formed. The train only got longer and longer \u2018til took her far away from sleep. In the end, she had stayed up all night.She painfully got up to the sound of Ms. Choi waking her up for breakfast. She sauntered to the dining room, then twitched at an unexpected view.At the table was Tae-jun sitting before her.Why is he here?It was 9 a.m. on a weekday. He should have gone to work hours ago.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I\u2019m taking a break until the weekend.\u201d Tae-jun replied as he scooped a portion of porridge.A break from work, huh?This unexpected development had wrecked her plans. She needed to look for evidence on Sang-gu Park and investigate In-bae Lee further. They all needed to be done without Tae-jun knowing. But he\u2019s on break, for four whole days, how was she to even move an inch in the direction? Yuri was so annoyed that her appetite had immediately flown far away. Ironically, the man, oblivious to her thoughts, placed pieces of meat on her plate for her to eat.Tae-jun interrupted her as she was getting up without finishing even half of her meal. \u201cShall we go somewhere?\u201dThis random question made Yuri malfunction for a second. She looked at Tae-jun with a blank, puzzled face.\u201cGo\u2026 anywhere?\u201d\u201cShopping, movies, long drive \u2026 wherever you want to go.\u201d He looked expectantly at her.\u201cWhy?\u201d She really didn\u2019t know the purpose behind these things that had popped up from his mouth out of nowhere. The times they had spent four years ago, she had been cooped up in the house. But now, he was suddenly proposing to go out\u2026 This was indeed shocking.Tae-jun lightly frowned at her condescending question. \u201cWhat do you mean \u2018why\u2019?\u201dShe noticed that she\u2019d inadvertently made him upset, but her lack of sleep ended up making her attack him otherwise.\u201cI don\u2019t want to go anywhere with you. We\u2019re not acquainted that way\u201dHer words were scorching. Tae-jun couldn\u2019t take it anymore and talked back with a deep voice.\u201cThen what kind of a relationship do we have? Just have s3x and that\u2019s it?\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cJust having sex in the bedroom like animals? Is this what you\u2019re into? I wouldn\u2019t mind so much but you won\u2019t be able to tolerate me.\u201dThis instantly put a frown on Yuri\u2019s face. His tone was cold and disparaging.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to trigger me to sleep with me, because I sleep with you when I feel like it. If there\u2019s nowhere you want to go, then I\u2019ll decide. Go get ready to leave,\u201d he said, marking the end of the conversation.Yuri reluctantly put on a dress and makeup.When she got in the car, the man started driving without a word.Where is he going?Though curious, she stayed silent for some time. But when she saw the sign board ahead, \u00a0she let out a gasp.\u201cAre we going to Jin-seong?\u201d she said in disbelief.\u201cYou told me you want your memories back. Isn\u2019t that why you were searching for Hyeon-ah Kim and Hye-seong Jin??\u201d His tone was full of sarcasm.\u201cTrue, but\u2026\u201dShe was at a loss for words now. She thought he was acting especially weird today.

So, visiting a place related to your lost memory might trigger something.\u201dIs he genuinely trying to help? All of a sudden?Questions she had a many, but reluctance even more. Thus, she let the awkward silence linger on, and turned her eyes towards the window and away from the man.The car drove past downtown to a familiar neighborhood. The car finally came to a stop before the Jinseong Art School- Yuri\u2019s alma-mater. On the field were students in the middle of a lesson.\u201cIt\u2019s not like I can\u2019t remember things from high school,\u201d said Yuri.\u201cLet\u2019s just call it a warm-up. It might help to start with the small things, right?\u201d He was surprisingly polite.Why would she need a warm-up \u2026Even so, she felt strangely refreshed coming back to her school after so many years. The front entrance, the pole in the field where her friends and she gathered for a chat, the art room where she spent most of her time \u2026 nothing seemed to have changed.The only change, she reckoned, was in herself. Actually, there was one more irreversible change- Hye-yeon Jin. The person she had spent her entire time, her growing years \u2026 the closest she had for a sister \u2026 Glimpses of the past rushed to her. She could still see the young Hye-yeon running towards her, her mirthful laughter, mischievous eyes \u2026 like she was there right now. As she trailed the girl, her eyes suddenly met Tae-jun\u2019s. Just like that little her little friend disappeared, permanently from her life.She stared blankly at the man and was brought out of her trance by his voice.\u201cHow was your school life?\u201dWhy does his voice sound so affectionate as if he was talking to a loved one?She blinked at him for a fleeting moment and decided to stop analyzing his intentions. There was no point delving into a contractual relationship, drawing meaning to his every action. It would do her more harm than good, and in the end, she would only be left with a wounded heart and eternal solitude.As such she responded drily. \u201cNothing special. I studied, drew a lot \u2026 did some volunteering.\u201d\u201cVolunteering?\u201d\u201cHm. Tending to people with special needs located just around the neighborhood. It was worth a lot of points.\u201d\u201cIs that when you learned sign language?\u201dHow did he remember all these?Yuri wondered as she nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cSchools these days teach quite a lot.\u201d Tae-jun looked genuinely amused.He and Yuri were only apart by \u2026 no more than six years? Schools were always making changes to their curriculums, but he didn\u2019t expect it to be this drastic.\u201cYou sound like you\u2019ve never gone to school.\u201d Yuri mocked.\u201cYou\u2019re right, I never did. I only attended to take my exams and spent the rest of my time at the range.\u201d He didn\u2019t take offense to her tone and plainly revealed the fact surrounding his growing years.While children his age spent the most time at school building memories and relationships, having fun, Tae-jun had spent his time at the shooting range establishing a strong bond with the rifle, target, and competitions.\u201cThen how did you get your education?\u201d she asked puzzled.\u201cI was homeschooled.\u201dHis childhood is definitely not typical.Just then she remembered something.\u201cBy the way, weren\u2019t you a professional shooter?\u201d\u201cHow do you know this?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThe internet told me everything about you.\u201d She shrugged and asked, \u201cWhat made you quit?\u201d\u201cIt was about time, and I haven\u2019t given up completely. I still go to competitions from time to time because I need to maintain my athlete license to own a gun.\u201dIt was such a dry response. Completely apathetic and straight to the point, just like the relationship the two shared.However, before she got lost in thoughts, the bell rang for the lunch break. After checking the time, Tae-jun started the car again.\u2e19\u2e19\u2e19Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Unlike the building, the parking lot was enormous with a sign that said \u201cSeo Hwa Dang\u201d.What were they here for this time?A bewildered Yuri was led into a wooden door by Tae-jun. The restaurant was crowded with a constant stream of patrons since it was lunchtime on a weekday.The pair was guided to the seats right away. The outdoors were left disheveled, but the indoors was remodeled. Yuri astounded looked around the drastically upgraded interior.\u201cAnything you\u2019d like to eat?\u201d Tae-jun passed the menu to her.\u201cIs this also a warm-up?\u201d she asked, taking the menu.\u201cYou can say so. And you like it here; you like the dishes here.\u201d He sounded as if he were reminding her.That\u2019s true \u2026She blinked as she read through the lengthy list of the menu.Since when were there so many options?Tae-jun ordered not only her favorite chicken dumplings but also the newest menus and a large hotpot.A moment later, they were presented with a banquet. Yuri was appalled.\u201cIsn\u2019t it too much food for the two of us?\u201d she said, as she looked around the tantalizing spread.\u201cYou don\u2019t need to finish it all.\u201dEasy said it looked hard to even go close to finishing!Tae-jun eagerly sliced a dumpling in half and placed it on Yuri\u2019s plate, he had done so before too. The man didn\u2019t eat much himself but would always buy a bunch of food and try to feed her.Then he, rather abruptly, asked, \u201cWhy do you like the food here?\u201d\u201cThe nanny who took care of me when I was young was from North Korea. Her cooking tasted similar to this.\u201d She replied without thinking.Perhaps because Yuri hadn\u2019t visited the restaurant for such a long time, or maybe because she hadn\u2019t had much breakfast, she was eagerly devouring the dumplings and curiously trying out the new dishes that Tae-jun had ordered for her. One with mala, one with curry, and another with cheese.After watching her eat for a few minutes, he said, \u201cThis one seems to be your favorite.\u201d He was pointing at a curry dumpling that she was enjoying the most.Yuri stared into his eyes with visible awe. \u201cHow did you know?\u201dThis wasn\u2019t the first time he\u2019d guessed on point.Is he a psychic?Tae-jun smirked as he replied. \u201cI was just being observant. You tend to chew longer when you\u2019re enjoying it.\u201dIt was a habit acquired from living with her grandmother. She was scolded when she was being picky with her food, so she\u2019d swallow it fast to finish the dishes she disliked. It felt weird that Tae-jun noticed her smallest habits, and that he was meticulously observing her every moment.After their meal, they strolled on the promenade along the Jinseong River. The river looked the same, but around it, everything seemed different. As they walked, Yuri slowly drifted into her thoughts.Retrieving her memories was in a state of stagnation. Off late, those fragments of memory that hounded her in the name of dreams seemed to have vanished. Nothing new came to her mind, at least not when she was sleeping. But the same could not be said during her waking hours. The sequence of recollections after meeting Tae-jun had given her the hope and confidence of resolving this mystery once and for all, and sooner. However, ever since the last piece of that conversation, there had been zero progress.She had thought that her looking into In-bae Lee\u2019s case would help her reach ultimate evidence that would solve the case, but things weren\u2019t that easy. The more she discovered, the more complicated it became. She knew with her current resources and the non-existent power that she possessed, she could do nothing.Yuri was in the midst of letting out a deep sigh when Tae-jun asked her a question.\u201cAny thoughts on going back to school?\u201d\u201c\u2026school?\u201d she said, rather befuddled.\u201cYou wanted to go back. You said you only have one more semester left. The school\u2019s trying to let the students who were victimized by Seok-ha Yoo return without any unfair consequences. If you\u2019re going to remain in this field, won\u2019t it be better to at least get your degree at H University?\u201d He explained.Graduating from school and getting a job in the field were things she wished for but had long given up on. She didn\u2019t expect him to bring this up.\u201cWere you involved in the Seok-ha Yoo incident by any chance?\u201d she asked about the hunch she had been long harboring.\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWhat for?\u201d\u201cWhat do you think?\u201dYuri was at a loss for an appropriate reply, so she just stared at him. Her eyes met his, and they remained so for a moment.Tae-jun lit his cigarette. \u201cYou should hazard a guess as to why I was involved in Seok-ha Yoo\u2019s case. Oh, and also, think about going back to school too.\u201dThey were interrupted by an incoming call. Tae-jun frowned looking at the caller, it seemed like he had to take this call. While he was preoccupied with the conversation, Yuri started walking along the river. Her head was full of thoughts.What exact feeling does Tae-jun have for me?She knew he had positive feelings for her. To be exact, he enjoyed having s*x with her.So all of this just for it?No, that didn\u2019t sound right.Then is it love?Absolutely not!What kind of love makes a guy think it\u2019s normal to blackmail her with a contract while being someone else\u2019s fianc\u00e9?He was just crazily attached to her like a greedy man.Yuri fiercely shook her head as if doing so would eliminate these useless thoughts. She didn\u2019t want another thing added to her list of problems. For now, she had to focus solely on her work, her purpose.The very next moment, she froze as she fixed her eyes on the river ahead.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cHere\u2026\u201d She mumbled, her breathing automatically turned erratic.She looked around in a trice. The enormous bud tree across the river looked very familiar. She was certain that she knew this place. In fact, it wasthe placein her lost memory.Yuri walked closer to the river for a confirmation. Not even the \u201cHazardous: Do Not Enter\u201d sign could stop her. The closer she got, the more horrified she looked.It was here \u2026 This was where Hye-yeon died.Before she noticed, the ground sank.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The accident occurred all so suddenly. She closed her eyes shut.\u201cYuri! Yuri Han!\u201dStruggling to float up pushed her even deeper into the water. She couldn\u2019t breathe. The water was so freezing that it stopped her from making a sound.That sounded like Hye-yeon\u2019s voice, or maybe Father\u2019s. Or actually maybe\u2026\u2026.The very next moment, she felt a strong force pulling her up. Gradually, she moved towards the sky and out of water. She arduously lay on the ground, and when the fit of cough abated, she finally took a deep breath.\u201cWhat were you thinking?! Are you out of your mind?\u201d Tae-jun yelled furiously.It was only now that Yuri noticed he was soaked as much as she was.Did he just \u2026 throw himself into the river to save me?Tae-jun looked confused and constricted. He didn\u2019t know how a seemingly perfect girl, without a preamble, abruptly jump into the water.\u201cI just \u2026 I just remembered something.\u201d Yuri slowly murmured as her lips trembled. It was so cold that her teeth were clenching.\u201cYou remembered something?\u201d He still couldn\u2019t connect the memory and the jump.But when he noticed her darting gaze, he followed her line of sight. One by one, people had started gathering around them.Visibly annoyed by the crowd, without a word, Tae-jun pulled her up. Yuri shook as she tried to stand.\u201cAre you able to walk?\u201dWhen Yuri nodded Tae-jun held her by the wrist. The air was unbearably cold for the two of them, he lifted her trembling body into his arms.\u201cI know it\u2019s really cold, but hang in there. There\u2019s a pension nearby.\u201d He reassured her.Tae-jun was also completely soaked from jumping into the water. Was this why his voice seemed to tremble with a deeper tone? Just like he had said, a pension appeared after a few minutes of walk.\u201cIs this \u2026 where \u2026?\u201d\u201cCorrect. This is where the Villa President used to live.\u201dHe had passed away years ago, but the house must have remained. Like Tae-jun said, maybe nobody cared about this house because he had so many already. He entered the passcode, and the heavy steel door opened up without a racket.The house was empty with a few furniture covered in white fabric. He took off his jacket and immediately walked up to the fireplace. Fortunately, there were some woods left. He lit up the fireplace with a lighter and walked to the master bedroom to bring towels and a blanket.\u201cTake off your clothes first, \u00a0or else your temperature might drop.\u201dShe struggled as she tried to take off her wet clothes because her trembling fingers kept slipping from the zipper on the dress. Soon he lent her a hand and helped her unzip the dress, effortlessly taking off her bra and pulling down her tights and underwear. When Yuri rapidly covered up her body with a blanket, Tae-jun shot her a judging glance.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen each other n*ked countless times.\u201dShowing her n*ked body was always embarrassing. Unlike Yuri, Tae-jun actively got undressed and brought the teapot and a couple of mugs. While she dried off her damp hair with a towel, Tae-jun hung his wet clothes near the fireplace and steamed up the teapot.\u201cWe only have underground water available since nobody really lives here. but I guess it\u2019s better than nothing.\u201d He cussed quietly as he took out his phone, cigarettes, and his wallet from his soaked clothes.\u201cWhat?\u201d His eyebrows quirked up when he noticed her staring at him.\u201cIt comes so naturally to you.\u201dFor a man of wealth who had the best servants at his beck and call, he was pretty adept at lighting the fireplace, drying soaked clothes, and boiling water in the pot.\u201cDone it quite a few times when I go hunting. Sometimes I even bivouac.\u201d He shrugged.\u201cWhat\u2019s bivouac?\u201d She was curious.\u201cTo put it simply, it means to sleep outdoors in the mountain. I\u2019ve gone without three days of sleep when I was super unlucky.\u201d\u201cThat sounds extreme.\u201d It was an honest reply.Tae-jun poured hot water into a mug and passed it to Yuri. She blew on the water to cool it down and took a small sip. Finally, her frozen body seemed to warm up. The sudden feeling of relaxation led to great fatigue.She felt as though she could fall asleep any second. She tried to take another sip of the water when she noticed the small letters on the handmade mug. Looked like an insignia, or maybe a brand name. Yuri read the letters as she tried to escape from drowsiness.\u201cJi-ye.\u201dTae-jun stiffened. He spat out his words. \u201cIt\u2019s the name of the woman that lived here with my father.\u201dOh, that\u2019s what happened.Yuri slowly put down her cup.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euTae-jun looked rather dismayed. \u201cI guess this isn\u2019t news to you since you don\u2019t look so surprised?

Don\u2019t you recall?\u201d She looked directly into his eyes.\u201cI did?\u201d He looked totally puzzled.Yuri wasn\u2019t at all surprised at his reaction.

It was dead into the night, and when she had gone to bed she had been alone. When she went to the living room downstairs to check, she found a piss-drunk Tae-jun, staggering, grabbing anything that he could hold onto to steady his out of control body in vain.Hair out of place, unkempt clothes, reeking of alcohol, he looked every bit the roadside drunkard at the moment.When he noticed her standing by the stairs, he waved to summon her. Yuri was kind of intimated because she had never seen Tae-jun this drunk before.He\u2019s in this again, In-bae Lee.Tae-jun chewed on his cigarette.\u201cIf it was a murder, then who killed Hye-yeon Jin, and for what reason?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Also, if Hye-yeon Jin was murdered, then why did Myeong-je Jin act so atypically towards his own daughter\u2019s death?Yuri had indeed never called. He thought she was only flirting when she said so but allegedly she meant her words. He should\u2019ve been able to tell that she wasn\u2019t playing hard to get.He got her contact information from the agency, so he could always come up with an excuse to talk to her.What should he do?He didn\u2019t want to appear desperate but she was perfectly his type.Should he keep his ego or follow his instincts?It was one helluva question to decide.While he was in a dilemma, the bartender served him a second glass of Glenfiddich. When he held up the glass, he noticed Si-yeon walking in through the door. It seemed like he had no choice but to take her home.After his family told him not to get 's*xually involved with a future family member\u201d when he took her home after an after-party, he was reluctant to get into that misunderstanding again. He looked at her pathetically.\u201cWhy are you so drunk?\u201d\u201cI wasn\u2019t in the best condition these days. It was my party with that branch \u2026 I kept accepting drinks to be polite and I went past my limit.\u201d Si-yeon took a seat and ordered 3 cocktails. It was an old habit of her to order a bloody mary with a tomato when she thought she was getting close to her limit.\u201cWhat did your department store decide to do regarding Seok-ha Yoo?\u201d Jae-won asked Si-yeon.\u201cWe\u2019ve decided to sue him, of course. There are still two years left on the contract for our collaboration. There\u2019s a rumor that his wife is filing for a divorce.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s stupid.

It\u2019s funny how the first person I was reminded of was Tae-jun, but he does have strong features.\u201d Suddenly, her smile disappeared, she gazed at her best friend suspiciously. \u201cBut what\u2019s up with that reaction? You know something about this?\u201d\u201cI-It just doesn\u2019t make any logical sense. You know Tae-jun\u2019s on vacation, right? He usually goes hunting bison or something in some wilderness or practice shooting at the range. But he\u2019s seen at Seohwadang? It\u2019s so random \u2026\u201dHold a second, Seohwadang?Jae-won was thinking rapidly.Isn\u2019t Seohwadang the favorite restaurant of that woman?The woman Tae-jun is looking for, the one who\u2019s dead, the one\u2019s who\u2019s Hye-yeon Jin but not actually Hye-yeon Jin\u2026 It\u2019s good that he actually found her, because he would\u2019ve done anything to find her until he actually did. But wasn\u2019t it too risky to go places and be exposed to the public with her?The Seo family tended to not interfere with their son\u2019s dating life. However, marriage was a completely different story. As long as Tae-jun was compliant with an arranged marriage, the family did not care about anything else.This went on to say that ethics and morality took a backseat when it came to business-marriage. So, matters like how many mistresses he kept, brothels he visited, so long as they were away from the limelight no one batted an eyelid.Mrs. Go, Si-yeon\u2019s mother, on the other hand, was well-known for her feisty personality. She held a tight leash on matters business and personal. Si-yeon herself too was cold-hearted compared to her bubbly appearance. Many things that girls her age took an interest in, like affection and love, this businesswoman had never paid mind to them.The reason behind Jae-won\u2019s exaggerated reaction was the person he was most afraid of- Chairman Seo, Tae-jun\u2019s grandfather. No matter what the members of the Seo family were up to, they could never escape this old tiger. He would turn a blind eye to everything his children and grandchildren did,exceptfor matters involving the arranged marriage. In this regard, the old man would spare no one who interfered with his arrangements.His worst fears were becoming reality. Jae-won emptied his glass in one go as dread smuggled upon him.\u2e19On the ride back, Yuri was lost in thoughts. She had visited the place Hye-yeon died in order to retrieve her memories but had failed to do exactly so.Why did it have to be there out of all the places?If her memory was accurate, that place was an old storage area of Jinseong Province. The more she thought, the more confused she was. More questions whose answers she knew not emerged.Why was she with Hye-yeon in the first place?She tried to clear his thoughts but it was easier said than done. She tried to think hard, trying to piece the bits of information she had \u2026Yuri scowled in frustration which caught Tae-jun\u2019s attention.\u201cAre you not feeling well?\u201d he asked.She turned to look at him. \u201cNo, I\u2019m fine. It\u2019s nothing to worry about.\u201dWith that, the car returned to silence. Between her musings, it struck Yuri that she didn\u2019t feel uneasy like expected after a bout of drenching. She was susceptible to cold, just a few minutes under a drizzle would set her up for days with a blocked nose and fever to say nothing of a dip in freezing water. She was a hundred percent sure that she would catch a cold, but surprisingly, that never happened. It probably helped to fall asleep in the arms of a man with a warm body temperature and to have a hearty meal.When they were almost home, Tae-jun broke the silence by asking Yuri a question.\u201cSo, what\u2019s your plan afterward?\u201d\u201cPlan? What do you mean?\u201d She looked at him confused.\u201cYour plan after you regain your memories. If you were right about Hye-yeon Jin\u2019s murder, what are you going to do about it? Are you going to call the police? That would be tricky since the investigation ended years ago.\u201d\u201cI know it\u2019s going to be difficult. Nobody is going to be kind enough to reopen a case that was finalized years ago simply because of my memory and no evidence.\u201dShe knew that the police would not cooperate especially if the suspect was In-bae Lee. She knew her recollection would only throw her into another kind of torment- seeing the guilty live life king size. But what could she do? Go up against them with nothing to back her, not even a shred of evidence? Who would heed her?She had thought of this eventuality, her silence right now was proof.Tae-jun tapped on his steering wheel as he wondered curiously. \u201cYou were looking to retrieve your memory without any plan?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t understand. You never will. You\u2019ll never know the pain of not being able to remember something so significant. A person I loved died before my eyes. I should never forget that.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThat wasn\u2019t all. Who, and why, was anyone trying to kill her? She had to know the truth to protect herself. She didn\u2019t know if she was out of danger for sure, she didn\u2019t know if it was being in the States that got her four years of lease to her life. Right now, she needed to unearth the truth in order to keep herself secure, no matter how twisted the logic sounded, this was all she had.Tae-jun leaned his elbow on the window deep in thoughts.Yuri was struggling with fatigue. She wanted to go home and take a long rest.Oh, the medications\u2026She suddenly remembered she had not taken her medications for the past few days. The antidepressant wasn\u2019t that essential, but she thought she should not forget to take the other medications when she got back home.They drove away from downtown and entered a calm suburban neighborhood. The car entered the parking lot and came to a stop.Yuri hastily unfastened her seat belt to get out of the vehicle, but the door stayed shut.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Tae-jun attached himself onto her body and roughly pressed his lips onto hers and unzipped her dress.\u201cWa \u2026Wait!\u201d Yuri grabbed his hands bringing him to a halt.\u201cDoes it have to be\u2026 HERE?\u201dThey were a staircase away from home. At home, there was a large soft bed. Yuri couldn\u2019t understand why this man was throwing his body onto her in the car at a parking lot.Tae-jun was not pleased when she stopped him. He raised his eyebrows and pulled down her hands. His hard member was bulging in his pants. Yuri was so surprised that she tried to get away from him, but he stopped her.\u201cI was like this the whole time I was driving \u2026 All because I want to pen3trate you.\u201d His voice dropped, his head even more.He impatiently took off her [email\u00a0protected] and devoured her brea*ts.

His hand was already playing around with her private area underneath her [email\u00a0protected] As her cl!t was rubbed, she cried out in rapture.\u201cI want to shove mine into you and come inside you-\u201d He mumbled, while a long finger made it into her entrance. She arched her head back as the sharp sensation assaulted her senses. His moist tongue l!cked her neckline and yet another finger made its way in. \u201c- until it squirts out of you.\u201d\u201cOh \u2026 Hmm~.\u201d Muffled moans slipped her lips, she turned her head to the side.\u201cYou\u2019re getting wet easily now.\u201dSatisfied and excited by her response, his fingers wandered inside her. He started to kiss her lips. Her cave greedily swallowed his fingers, tightening around them firmly soaking them in her juices. His trail of kisses made their way downwards to her neck and rosy buds. By now, her whole body was bathed in a hue of wine under the ministrations of the man intoxicated by pleasure.Now that her den was moist enough, he retrieved his fingers, stripped his pants, and freed his throbbing shaft. Then, immediately grabbing her ankles, he placed them on top of the seat.\u201cWhat are you doing!\u201dYuri was startled to find herself sitting in a position that resembled a perfect \u201cM\u201d. Her hidden features were so visible.\u201cLicking it, of course.\u201d His lu*stful eyes never once left her honeypot.\u201cNo, just \u2026 let\u2019s just do it \u2026 I haven\u2019t even washed-\u201dOther than being inundated, she hadn\u2019t taken a proper shower. She felt disgusted at the thought. However, Tae-jun did not stop and spread her folds with his finger. It was completely w*t from excitement. It looked quite delicious to his eyes.Tae-jun tickled her den, Yuri helplessly squirmed. He then opened up her legs further.\u201cYou know that your scent turns me on so [email\u00a0protected] ?\u201d Tae-jun growled.Her heavy breathing made him crazy. Her soft [email\u00a0protected] were music to his ears.Yuri could not help but twist her waist. Her legs were wide apart, and her tongue was trembling. She tried to stop the man attacking her cherry with his tongue, but her ankles were firmly held. It was going to leave a mark, a symbol that represented her everlasting attachment to Tae-jun.Whenever his tongue moved into her, she squeezed her toes from the tickling sensation. Her sensual voice rang through the car.\u201cHmm\u2026 my\u2026 goodness-\u201d She could not stop the notes of plea*ure leaving her full lips. Suddenly, her body froze and unrestrained rained over the leather seat.\u201cI should change the seat covers.\u201d A pleased Tae-jun murmured.Yuri was busy panting when he pulled down his pants. His already erect rod glided smoothly into her hold. She arduously held back her scream.Tae-jun sank as deep as he could, zealously swaying his hips. It was his first time indulging at a place other than a bedroom.

To be more exact, she could not leave Tae-jun\u2019s arms. He ate most of the meals in bed and even carried her to the bathroom. Was it because he worked out intensely on a regular basis? His energy and virility were simply incredible. He coveted her as if it was the sole purpose of his vacation.It was ironic. He had tasked Manager Choi to help recover her health with nutritious meals, but now that she was healthy again, the very man was exhausting her even more. She had to endure him twice and even thrice in one night. To his credit, this avaricious man was actually controlling his pace. What\u2019s more, he even kept her hydrated and let her get enough sleep.But he tried to stick to her skin every little second. Her body was filled with his seed. Even beasts that lived for s*x, by s*x, and because of s*x would not act as wildly as he was. It was appalling how a person\u2019s desire could be so intense.But who was she to blame?

Tae-jun finished dressing up, walked towards her, and patted her bare back.\u201cI should tell Manager Choi to get some expensive supplements for you.\u201dSupplements to make me more exhausted?Yuri deliberately let out an audible sigh.\u201cYou\u2019re insane. Instead of getting me supplements, you should think about refraining yourself. \u201d\u201cDid you not look at the mirror yesterday? You were so beautiful nobody could have refrained from you.\u201dThe word \u2018mirror\u2019 made her blush. Last night, he was enjoying a session in various positions in front of a mirror that covered an entire wall in the dressing room.\u201c\u2026 You pervert.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like I enjoyed it by myself? And I\u2019m actually trying my best to stay on the same pace as you.

Yuri\u2019s body reacted immediately. She pushed him back and pulled up her blanket.\u201cYou\u2019re not thinking about staying home today, are you?\u201d She glared at him.Ta-jun chuckled as he got up from the bed.\u2e19It was an hour after Tae-jun left, that Yuri finally got out of bed. She wanted to get some sleep while she was free of his touch but instead decided to do some more research on Sang-gu Park.She stopped her indifferent steps to the restroom when she was in front of the mirror in the dressing room. The dresser that was completely sabotaged last night was squeaky clean and neatly organized.

She didn\u2019t completely trust the former manager, but she worked for the Jins for a decade or so. So, she was someone who would know something about them better than her. She had to face this no matter what it held in store for her.A sudden phone call almost jolted the jittery Yuri. She thought it must be Tae-jun checking on her, but instead, it was Roy Jean.

By the way, who drove you here? There are some suspicious-looking people outside over there.\u201d\u201cI told you before. I know a person. They\u2019re all hired by that person.\u201d She wasn\u2019t comfortable with how the woman was being nosy. If it weren\u2019t for the information, she would have walked out.\u201cOh right, Tae-jun Seo.\u201dYuri\u2019s eyes widened when Hyeon-ah mentioned his name.

Sooner than later they were to part.More so because she was of the opinion that her relationship with Tae-jun should only last until she recovers her memories. She didn\u2019t want him to go through her struggles. There was no point in bothering him with her problems.He didn\u2019t owe her anything. Also, she couldn\u2019t be a part of his life either. They came from different worlds that were never supposed to intersect. It was a trick of fate that their paths had crossed, but it was only for a short time.

I need to talk to the agency manager about the period remaining in my contract too.\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t do that in Korea?\u201d He was obviously annoyed. He was not about to let her out of his sight.Fearing things will go south before even she had a chance at it, she persuaded him as desperately as she could. \u201cI need to get a refill from my pharmacy too. I\u2019ll be back as soon as possible.\u201dTae-jun fixed his eyes on the girl for a while. The cry of plea in her voice and eyes were hard to miss. After a moment, he reluctantly nodded.

If he took things up as a challenge, it would be even worse. She simply sighed, resignedly. \u201cFine, I\u2019ll get an examination.

Or do you want Assistant Jung to go instead?\u201dApparently, she was not going to go alone, so it was better for Manager Choi to follow her than Assistant Jung. She was comfortable with this woman. Yuri agreed and just when she thought this was the end of the conditions, the man spoke again.\u201cYou will call me from there. Morning and night, twice a day.\u201dHow many conditions were there? And a phone call twice a day? It\u2019s not like she was a prisoner that just got released. He has Manager Choi to watch her every move!Her mind was screaming at the man\u2019s unreasonable demands.

This way, he would always have his way no matter what.To be honest, she was tired of it. But there was nothing that she could do about it. she just shook her head and rose from her seat, about to leave but Tae-jun grabbed her arm. There couldn\u2019t be something else he wanted to add.

Senator Lee was an old politician who was friends with his grandfather. He was now retired, but he used to be a man of significant authority to both parties, so the attendees to the ceremony were influential people.Also, he recognized some of the names of popular candidates for the upcoming presidential election. One name that he particularly focused on was In-Bae Lee.\u201cIn-Bae Lee is attending.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s an acquaintance of Su-Kwang Lee, and it is an appropriate ceremony for him to show up at.\u201dIt was then that Manager Lee received a text message from Assistant Kim. He was notified that Si-yeon had already arrived at the boutique.\u201cGeneral Manager Yoon has arrived first.\u201dThe two had the same meetings to attend after their engagement ceremony. Tae-jun and Si-yeon\u2019s stylist prepared matching outfits at Song\u2019s boutique.With his eyes fixed on the list in hand, Tae-jun said, \u201cWhen we arrive, you can go home, Manager Lee.\u201d\u201cThank you, Sir.\u201dWeird. Something was different. Everything seemed normal and today was a typical day. So why did something feel so off?Manager Lee carefully turned to look at his boss.He\u2019d never seen Tae-jun in such a great mood after his vacation. It seemed logical though. After all, taking a break from work was a burden to the scion of the Seo Empire. While other heirs spent vacationing in exotic locations, this former athlete would be seen carrying his shotgun up the mountains. Once there, he would not come down for days or lock the shooting range. He would stay there all by himself.Whenever he had something bothering him or an important decision to make, he acted that way, isolating himself from everyone and everything.So why did he all of a sudden become a whole other person?His face was not only flushing but also glowing. Even the female employees who were used to his handsomeness were blushing.He was so positive today. What\u2019s more, there was even a rumor \u2026 An employee who arrived early to finish up his task witnessed the stone-cold boss \u2018smile\u2019.It was clear that he was in the best mood he could ever be in. But no one knew the source of this delightfully shocking change.\u201cYou got something to say?\u201d\u201cOh, no sir.\u201dTae-jun must have felt his stare. Manager Lee quickly turned to face forward lest the pleasantness turns to wrath. Contrary to how Tae-jun was being perceived, the man was deep in thoughts.Director Seo was at the helm of Seo Group at the young age of twenty-eight. Unlike the men his age, he had never shown an extra ounce of emotion than was necessary. A man of few words, no matter the circumstances, failure, or success, remained perpetually aloof. Nothing, person or object, had ever lifted the corners of this facially paralyzed man\u2019s lips.But \u2026 today \u2026Tae-jun had never been in a better mood than he was today. And Manger Lee was certain that this miracle was courtesy the person on the other end of the line. His boss had spent the entirety of the lunch break glued to the phone. The man never took a dedicated lunch break as such. He would have lunch in his office wrapping pending work the whole time. Thus, when the boss stayed, naturally, the employees in the secretarial department would stay back too ordering takeout.However, Tae-jun, who was in a superb mood today, happily lent his card to the employees. Needless to say, the people of this department were on cloud nine. They took their time enjoying the rare meal, all except Manager Lee who finished his meal quickly and returned to the office.It was there that he heard Tae-jun talking over the phone with someone. The door that was usually shut tight, was ajar. Thanks to this, Manager Lee discovered that his cold boss could also speak in the most affectionate way.Was it a woman? It won\u2019t be his fianc\u00e9e of course \u2026 Argh, what was he thinking?!\u2e19When the car entered the parking lot, Manager Song of the Song Boutique was already waiting to greet him. She welcomed Tae-jun inside.\u201cManager Yoon is already in the fitting room.\u201d\u201cHow many outfits did she choose?\u201d he asked.\u201cShe has chosen six.\u201dTae-jun looked at his watch to calculate the time. \u201cMight take about half an hour. I\u2019ll get changed later.\u201dRead latest chapters at wuxiaworld.euHe didn\u2019t like shopping. He hired a professional shopper to get all of his outfits for official meetings. Song, whom he had worked with for the past three years, was talented enough to please him every time. Today\u2019s suit was also a match to his taste.\u201cThen I\u2019ll notify you when it\u2019s time.\u201dTae-jun normally looked through papers or made business calls while Si-yeon got dressed.

Is it a gift? May I see the profile\u2026?\u201dUsually, Tae-jun would hand Song a profile of the woman when he was looking for a gift. Then, Song would choose something befitting and gift wrap it. She would diligently save all of the profiles she was handed on her tablet so as to avoid recommending the same outfits in the future.The young director would usually prepare gifts for his aunts and female cousins, or important women in his business. This time, his fianc\u00e9e Si-yeon was added to that list.Tae-jun stopped Song, who was going through the previous profiles.\u201cIt\u2019s fine; I\u2019ll choose myself.\u201dThe boutique manager\u2019s fingers involuntarily slid off the tablet screen.Choose by himself?What she heard was simply unbelievable.A person who would not even choose his own outfits wants to choose a gift for someone else?Song tried her best to keep her polite smile on and not reveal the shock in her heart. \u201cOf course. This way please.\u201dBut it seemed like today was the day when Manager Song\u2019s emotions would be put to test and how. Before she could recompose herself from the initial shock, the man carelessly tossed her into a maze. The clothes he was choosing right now, to be precise the feminine pencil skirt or the long flared dress, weren\u2019t meant for a petite woman with a glamorous body figure like Si-yeon\u2019s. Rather they did justice to the slender and tall ones with a fashion-model like figure.When was it?She remembered the clothes Tae-jun bought one day. Early in the morning he had randomly summoned her to his office and handed her a shopping bag with heels and clothes, and asked her to come back in an hour with an outfit, innerwear, and heels of the same size. \u00a0That was the first time Tae-jun ordered her to do so in three years.The clothes back then were also for a woman of the same body type \u2026Tae-jun meticulously scoured over ten outfits, four pairs of heels, three bags, and even lingerie. In the end, he said to wrap them up in a gift box and he would send people over to collect it.He spent so much money during his thirty minutes shopping, but there was not a trace of vexation or displeasure. Pure delight laced his handsome visage, with excitement lingering on. However, that excitement disappeared as soon as he saw a decked up Si-yeon walking out.Manager Song escorted the pair of VIPs and wrapped the outfits Tae-jun had chosen.Just then, one of the employees hurried over to the boss with a query. \u201cManager, the Louboutins Mr. Seo chose a few minutes ago are out of size 36.

She had known the girl for some time now, and being in the hospitality business she knew to read people. Yuri and she had spent a lot of time working whenever the former would fill in for Hye-yeon, which would be quite often. So from the way the other had reacted, it wasn\u2019t the same as when she had discovered that her friend was dead. She was surprised for sure and genuinely, she could say that. However, she did not seem shocked enough. On the contrary, her intelligent mind seemed to be probing something.\u201cIt was as if she already knew her father\u2019s death was not an accident.\u201d Hyeon-ah muttered as she mulled.\u201cShe lost her memory. Is that a lie?\u201d The man conjectured.\u201cNo, it\u2019s not a lie.\u201d Hyeon-ah countered. \u201cShe was really shocked when she heard about Hye-yeon Jin. She wouldn\u2019t have stayed still for four years if she didn\u2019t actually lose her memory.\u201dThe girls were thick as thieves. they had grown up together and their friendship ran deeper than it seemed. They would always look out for each other, especially Yuri. She could never say no to her best friend and always covered for her when the other was indulging in her escapades. So, it was impossible for Yuri to have not been in the country knowing her friend was dead. She was too loyal for her own good.\u201cThen how did she find out?\u201d Hey-seong demanded. If she didn\u2019t lose her memories, there was no way she would know her father died as a result of foul play and not a freak accident.\u201cI don\u2019t know, but a daughter can have doubts about her father\u2019s mysterious death for sure. She\u2019s a smart girl so she must have done some research. Look at how she\u2019s staying near Tae-jun Seo.\u201dHye-seong grasped his cup when he heard Tae-jun\u2019s name. His shoulder burned, he clenched his jaw discreetly.But none of this escaped Hyeon-ah\u2019s discerning eyes. \u201cThat injury \u2026 you didn\u2019t get beaten up or stabbed by a knife. Did you get shot?\u201d She prodded.\u201cNone of your business!\u201d He snapped at her.\u201cHow did you get shot in Korea? Unfazed, she went on asking. \u201cThat\u2019s an unlikely thing to happen. Did someone keep a gun at home?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s someone. He\u2019s completely insane.\u201dHyeon-ah was amused. She chuckled. \u201cBy the way, what was it likely to see Yuri for the first time in forever? You guys used to go out. She\u2019s even prettier now. I guess life got easier with a guy like Tae-jun Seo beside her.\u201dHyeon-ah\u2019s words stung. Hye-seong was always uncomfortable around this woman. It was ever since he saw her, a girl only five years older than him, encounter his father late in the night. However, he ironically acknowledged the fact that she was the only person he could get help at the current situation.She asked a question as she took out a new cigarette. \u201cSo what are you going to do now? Even if Yuri finds \u2018it\u2019, it won\u2019t be easy to talk to her with Tae-jun watching her.\u201d\u201cWe need to come up with a method.\u201d He had thought about this hard. He knew the guy was a hunter and he was certainly on the lookout for him. Now he even had Yuri in the den. It was not going to be easy.\u201cCan I ask you something?\u201dHye-seong gestured her to go ahead with his eyes.Hyeon-ah\u2019s red lips lifted up. \u201cDo you want to avenge for Hye-yeon, or do you want to find \u2018it\u2019?\u201d\u201cBoth.\u201dWhat Hye-seong Jin was never going to admit was the truest reason. Yes, he wanted to avenge his sister, and that thing held mammoth importance, but he wanted this most to satisfy his wounded ego.The flower that once he had strongly desired, that was once almost at hand, was abruptly and ruthlessly snatched away from him. He had held it in for far too long, first because of his father and then again because of his father\u2026 The man had made sure to torment him even after his death. But now that the opportunity had befallen him, he would seek his retribution\u2013 if he couldn\u2019t have the flower, then he would trample on it so no one else could ever have it.The shoulder stabbed again, Hye-seong growled a curse under his breath at the man who had inflicted the pain. Engorged in his loathing, he squeezed on his shoulder without noticing it bleeding.He wanted to ruin Yuri Han. That was the probably the greatest revenge he could have on Tae-jun Seo.\u2e19 \u2e19 \u2e19If you want to support the Lunar Letters team, you can do so by pledging to us on Patreon and get to read advanced chapters of our novels!

    "Chapter 89": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Apollo\u2019s HeartChapter 86Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 86\u201cThis is the list of people attending Senator Su-Kwang Lee\u2019s publication ceremony today with General Manager Si-yeon Yoon.\u201d Manager Lee got in the car with Tae-jun and handed him the list.Tae-jun indifferently read through the list. Senator Lee was an old politician who was friends with his grandfather. He was now retired, but he used to be a man of significant authority to both parties, so the attendees to the ceremony were influential people.Also, he recognized some of the names of popular candidates for the upcoming presidential election. One name that he particularly focused on was In-Bae Lee.\u201cIn-Bae Lee is attending.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s an acquaintance of Su-Kwang Lee, and it is an appropriate ceremony for him to show up at.\u201dIt was then that Manager Lee received a text message from Assistant Kim. He was notified that Si-yeon had already arrived at the boutique.\u201cGeneral Manager Yoon has arrived first.\u201dThe two had the same meetings to attend after their engagement ceremony. Tae-jun and Si-yeon\u2019s stylist prepared matching outfits at Song\u2019s boutique.With his eyes fixed on the list in hand, Tae-jun said, \u201cWhen we arrive, you can go home, Manager Lee.\u201d\u201cThank you, Sir.\u201dWeird. Something was different. Everything seemed normal and today was a typical day. So why did something feel so off? Manager Lee carefully turned to look at his boss.He\u2019d never seen Tae-jun in such a great mood after his vacation. It seemed logical though. After all, taking a break from work was a burden to the scion of the Seo Empire. While other heirs spent vacationing in exotic locations, this former athlete would be seen carrying his shotgun up the mountains. Once there, he would not come down for days or lock the shooting range. He would stay there all by himself.Whenever he had something bothering him or an important decision to make, he acted that way, isolating himself from everyone and everything.So why did he all of a sudden become a whole other person? His face was not only flushing but also glowing. Even the female employees who were used to his handsomeness were blushing.He was so positive today. What\u2019s more, there was even a rumor \u2026 An employee who arrived early to finish up his task witnessed the stone-cold boss \u2018smile\u2019.It was clear that he was in the best mood he could ever be in. But no one knew the source of this delightfully shocking change.\u201cYou got something to say?\u201d\u201cOh, no sir.\u201dTae-jun must have felt his stare. Manager Lee quickly turned to face forward lest the pleasantness turns to wrath. Contrary to how Tae-jun was being perceived, the man was deep in thoughts.Director Seo was at the helm of Seo Group at the young age of twenty-eight. Unlike the men his age, he had never shown an extra ounce of emotion than was necessary. A man of few words, no matter the circumstances, failure, or success, remained perpetually aloof. Nothing, person or object, had ever lifted the corners of this facially paralyzed man\u2019s lips.But \u2026 today \u2026Tae-jun had never been in a better mood than he was today. And Manger Lee was certain that this miracle was courtesy the person on the other end of the line. His boss had spent the entirety of the lunch break glued to the phone. The man never took a dedicated lunch break as such. He would have lunch in his office wrapping pending work the whole time. Thus, when the boss stayed, naturally, the employees in the secretarial department would stay back too ordering takeout.However, Tae-jun, who was in a superb mood today, happily lent his card to the employees. Needless to say, the people of this department were on cloud nine. They took their time enjoying the rare meal, all except Manager Lee who finished his meal quickly and returned to the office.It was there that he heard Tae-jun talking over the phone with someone. The door that was usually shut tight, was ajar. Thanks to this, Manager Lee discovered that his cold boss could also speak in the most affectionate way.Was it a woman? It won\u2019t be his fianc\u00e9e of course \u2026 Argh, what was he thinking?!\u2e19When the car entered the parking lot, Manager Song of the Song Boutique was already waiting to greet him. She welcomed Tae-jun inside.\u201cManager Yoon is already in the fitting room.\u201d\u201cHow many outfits did she choose?\u201d he asked.\u201cShe has chosen six.\u201dTae-jun looked at his watch to calculate the time. \u201cMight take about half an hour. I\u2019ll get changed later.\u201dHe didn\u2019t like shopping. He hired a professional shopper to get all of his outfits for official meetings. Song, whom he had worked with for the past three years, was talented enough to please him every time. Today\u2019s suit was also a match to his taste.\u201cThen I\u2019ll notify you when it\u2019s time.\u201dTae-jun normally looked through papers or made business calls while Si-yeon got dressed. So, Song ordered an assistant to lead him to a private room.\u201cActually, I want to look around.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d Manager Song was genuinely surprised.\u2e19\u2e19\u2e19If you want to support the Lunar Letters team, you can do so by pledging to us on Patreon and get to read advanced chapters of our novels!

Is it a gift? May I see the profile\u2026?\u201dUsually, Tae-jun would hand Song a profile of the woman when he was looking for a gift. Then, Song would choose something befitting and gift wrap it. She would diligently save all of the profiles she was handed on her tablet so as to avoid recommending the same outfits in the future.The young director would usually prepare gifts for his aunts and female cousins, or important women in his business. This time, his fianc\u00e9e Si-yeon was added to that list.Tae-jun stopped Song, who was going through the previous profiles.\u201cIt\u2019s fine; I\u2019ll choose myself.\u201dThe boutique manager\u2019s fingers involuntarily slid off the tablet screen. Choose by himself? What she heard was simply unbelievable. A person who would not even choose his own outfits wants to choose a gift for someone else?Song tried her best to keep her polite smile on and not reveal the shock in her heart. \u201cOf course. This way please.\u201dBut it seemed like today was the day when Manager Song\u2019s emotions would be put to test and how. Before she could recompose herself from the initial shock, the man carelessly tossed her into a maze. The clothes he was choosing right now, to be precise the feminine pencil skirt or the long flared dress, weren\u2019t meant for a petite woman with a glamorous body figure like Si-yeon\u2019s. Rather they did justice to the slender and tall ones with a fashion-model like figure.When was it? She remembered the clothes Tae-jun bought one day. Early in the morning he had randomly summoned her to his office and handed her a shopping bag with heels and clothes, and asked her to come back in an hour with an outfit, innerwear, and heels of the same size. \u00a0That was the first time Tae-jun ordered her to do so in three years.The clothes back then were also for a woman of the same body type \u2026Tae-jun meticulously scoured over ten outfits, four pairs of heels, three bags, and even lingerie. In the end, he said to wrap them up in a gift box and he would send people over to collect it.He spent so much money during his thirty minutes shopping, but there was not a trace of vexation or displeasure. Pure delight laced his handsome visage, with excitement lingering on. However, that excitement disappeared as soon as he saw a decked up Si-yeon walking out.Manager Song escorted the pair of VIPs and wrapped the outfits Tae-jun had chosen.Just then, one of the employees hurried over to the boss with a query. \u201cManager, the Louboutins Mr. Seo chose a few minutes ago are out of size 36. We only have size 38 left. Should I contact the S Department Store for the same design?\u201dSi-yeon wore a size 36. The good employee who helped Si-yeon get dressed seemed to have remembered this and diligently brought the matter over to the boss. It would be embarrassing for the company to make any kind of mistake, to say nothing of an important thing such a size.However, Song shook her head. \u201cNo, size 38 is correct.\u201d\u201cPardon?

Nevertheless, he kept a straight face like a seasoned politician that he was. \u201cOh, didn\u2019t Seoin take over Hotel Jinseong? Hotel Jinseong is too famous for me to not care about Mr. Jin,\u201d he said, deftly painting his connection to the deceased man as a passing acquaintance.\u201cWas that so? I guess it doesn\u2019t matter anymore since he\u2019s already dead.\u201d Tae-jun firmly grabbed In-bae Lee\u2019s hand and added. \u201cI expect you to use your people wisely, especially with an election coming up soon. My grandfather has very high expectations. Me as well.\u201dIn-bae\u2019s face stiffened looking at the retreating back of the young man.All the information that Tae-jun had been given so far were inconclusive. He knew there was a lot of foul play involved, but he had yet to learn who the culprits were. He didn\u2019t know how and if In-bae Lee and Yuri Han were connected. With his words just now, he hoped the man felt threatened enough and behaved properly.The tension was building, Si-yeon quickly changed the topic.\u201cHow was your break?\u201d\u201cDid I tell you I was on break?\u201d he said coldly.\u201cSeveral people told me. What did you do during your break?\u201d she asked, ignoring his frosty tone.\u201cI rested.\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t go hunting this time?\u201d she asked, surprised.\u201cI did a while ago.\u201d He shrugged.\u201cA while ago \u2026 when?\u201d Si-yeon was puzzled. She didn\u2019t remember him doing so. And it was highly unlikely that she would be mistaken because this man\u2019s hunting trips were not something one could forget.Right then Tae-jun\u2019s phone vibrated. When he saw that it was Jin-ho calling, he looked at Si-yeon and said, \u201cI\u2019m going to answer this one.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Si-yeon nodded and headed to the catering corner.Tae-jun went to the balcony where he was the lone occupant and answered the call as he took out his cigarette. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cAre you available to talk?\u201d\u201cNot for too long. Just get to the point.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve found out the composition of the medication.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s it?\u201d\u201cUmmm-\u201d Jin-ho hesitated.Was it a strong one? He thought of how Yuri would have very painful headaches from time to time. Tae-jun didn\u2019t urge the doctor and waited for his response.\u201cIt\u2019s Kratom.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Kratom? That\u2019s a drug.\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s a drug. It\u2019s not FDA approved, but it\u2019s sometimes used for treatment in America to kill pain or treat drug addiction \u2026 Tae-jun, Tae-jun Seo.

She didn\u2019t seek the man, it was the other way around. She wanted to make a clean break, but it was he who lured her into it \u2026 taking her tablet, tossing her a contract. It was Tae-jun who was always threatening and locking her up, not the other way around. She was only going to stay around him until she recovered her memories. It would only last a month or two. She would leave way before his wedding, she would be far far away from the man. This was all temporary.She irritatedly brushed her fingers through her hair and held onto her pencil again. Her croquis was 90 percent complete. It illustrated a man hugging a woman. She could not help but think of Si-yeon as she worked on the facial features. The man who embraced her so passionately would now do the same to Si-yeon. The same member that shoved its way inside of her would now be greedy for Si-yeon\u2019s body.Yuri could not handle it anymore. Huffing and gasping, she threw the pencil in her hand and mercilessly shredded the paper into pieces. Her work, after months and months of inspiration, now nothing but trash, lay scattered around her. Running her fingers through her tresses, she tugged at them as if doing so would pull her out of the emotional whirlpool she was in right now.At that moment, her phone on the table rang wildly. She took a deep sigh and reached to check on the caller. It was her uncle. It was early in the morning in New York, the time when he usually woke up to work out at the gym.The day before, Yuri had left him a voicemail regarding her visit and her father\u2019s belongings. So, he must be calling about it. Yuri adjusted her voice to hide her emotions as she answered the call.\u201cHello, Uncle.\u201d\u201cI just saw your message. You\u2019re leaving Korea tomorrow?\u201d\u201cI am. I\u2019ll call you once I get there.\u201d\u201cIs Roy coming with you?\u201d\u201cNo, Roy\u2019s currently in Japan, and I\u2019m only visiting temporarily. You have father\u2019s belongings, right?\u201d\u201cEverything that the police found is in the storage. Everything else was thrown away when I went to Korea to get rid of the house. Why are you looking for them all of a sudden?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll tell you in person. This isn\u2019t something to talk about through the phone.\u201d\u201cDid you remember something?\u201dShe noticed that his voice elevated with excitement.\u201cYes, but not entirely.\u201dA groan sounded from the other end.He would be really shocked when he hears more about Father\u2019s death. Yuri thought to herself as she cautiously mentioned the name in case he was aware of it.\u201cBy the way Uncle, do you happen to recognize the name \u201cSang-gu Park\u201d in connection to Father\u2019s accident?\u201d\u201cOf course I do. How can I not? He witnessed your father\u2019s accident. He\u2019s the guy who said your father ran into the car.\u201d\u201cWitnessed?\u201dYuri was shocked beyond words.That b*tch is fierce and tiresome. Like father, like daughter.It\u2019s him! The one who tried to kill me and murdered Hye-yeon!She could feel her pulse racing as she tried to remember something about him. A headache started to surface, Yuri groaned.\u201cYuri! What is it? Are you okay?\u201d\u201cHuh? Yeah \u2026 I\u2019m fine. I\u2019m just \u2026 just a little shocked.\u201d\u201cHow do you know that name?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s relevant to my incident .\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201d\u201cUncle, you do know what he looks like, right? I can\u2019t talk for long; my head is aching badly. I\u2019ll tell you all about it once I get there.\u201d\u201cOf course, I\u2019ll wait for you.\u201dAfter hanging up, Yuri restlessly lay her body on the sofa. Her head was throbbing, she was in excruciating pain \u2026 \u00a0she felt as if someone was piercing her head with a nail. She glared at the shredded remains of the paper. She was so mad that her head was aching. Her eyes welled up with tears, she was fighting hard to endure.Why is it hurting so much \u2026Unable to hold it any longer, Yuri impatiently took out a pill with her trembling hands, walked to the kitchen to fetch a cold glass of water to swallow it with. Then she sat at the table massaging her temples.It\u2019s okay. Everything will be fine. She was reassuring herself when \u2026SLAM!\u2026 The main door closed with a racket. Yuri immediately stood up to check who it was only to see Tae-jun barging towards her.\u201cYou said you\u2019re going to be late \u2026\u201dA frosty, maniacal Tae-jun bored his hawkeyes into her. The man stood there in silence, dropping the temperature in the room to the subzero level. But when his gaze landed on the pill vial sitting neatly on the table, he grabbed it, fiercely thrashing it on the floor. The clear plastic vial shattered upon impact, the capsules scattered in all directions.\u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The man was brutish at times, but such belligerence was uncharacteristic of him. This whole situation \u2026 the ear-piercing noise, the shattered vial \u2026 everything was absolutely unbelievable.She stood there in a daze, eyes fixated on the ground unable to process the whole situation. Her heart was racing, head throbbing, hands numb, lips quivering \u2026 but she was oblivious to it all.Tae-jun\u2019s cold, low voice broke the eerie silence.\u201cYou did it?\u201dHow could a person\u2019s voice be this low? Simply looking at him was intimidating enough for her to freeze and stick to the floor. The sparks from his stare were powerful enough to annihilate anything. The aura he was emanating made him look almost inhumane \u2026 Akin to a ghost or a goblin.All of this combined and effected a delayed reaction in Yuri.\u201cSorry?\u201d Was the only word she managed to mumble in her befuddlement. She did not know why this man had come barging in like a towering inferno. She was afraid to make eye contact even, but she still looked at him.\u201cHow dare you treat your body like that!\u201d His terrifying tone sent chills down her spine, her eyes shook intensely.\u201cYou dare to do drugs?!\u201d He bellowed.\u201cHow did you \u2026\u201dIt can\u2019t be \u2026 She could feel her own fingertips tremble.\u201cI looked up the ingredients to that medication you\u2019re taking! It has Kratom in it!\u201dYuri could feel her brain vault into malfunction and come to a grinding halt. Words evaded her, she could see nothing but the deadly stare of the devilish man before her.\u201cI think I made it clear not to lie to me, and you dare to keep this a secret?\u201d His foot crushed the capsules lying on the floor.Yuri zoned into the mashed capsules bleeding out white granules. He was still in his fancy tuxedo. He must have rushed out of the party, all because of this.\u201cTell me. Explain yourself to me. Give me the whole story. Tell me the bare details with your own mouth!!!\u201dHe grabbed a handful of her hair and forced eye contact. His demanding, fierce countenance looked somewhat desperate for a wholehearted explanation. His eyes were searching her face, seeking a hint perhaps, that would say it was all a misunderstanding. His heart tugged, knowing too well that that trace of hope he was yearning for was but a delusion.His tight grip was no doubt painful, but she was feeling none. Her limpid, glistened orbs only noticed the black, bespoke tuxedo that was glaringly reminding her of the engagement photos she had just put away. An engagement that would soon become a marriage \u2026Two decades of friendship into love \u2026 He must be returning from some party he had been to with Si-yeon \u2026So why does he care about me so much?! \u2026As moments passed, his grip tightened. Slowly her mind crawled back to reality, she took in a deep breath willing herself to feel no pain. Not once did she avert her gaze, looking equally fiercely into his eyes.\u201cWhat do you want me to say more? It\u2019s just the way you know. I did drugs. So what? And what does that have to do with you?\u201dHer mind was racing, everything between them was a contract \u2026 she was an object that Tae-jun Seo had bought along with Hotel Seoin. What did it matter to him if she did drugs or anything else? The tenure was about to expire anyway. They would be done, for good.Her words incensed him, he pulled her hair as if doing so would rein in her audacity. \u201cWhat does that have to do with me? You think this isn\u2019t a big deal?\u201d He spat out with gritted teeth.\u201cOf course not!\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re just friends with benefits who enjoy having s*x with each other, so there\u2019s nothing else that matters? Is that what you mean?\u201d Tae-jun\u2019s visage portrayed a merciless shadow. His voice had a hint of the fury he could not withhold.Did his fury trigger her? Yuri began to develop an emotion similar to his. She had arduously tried her best to ignore the fact that he held her uncle and Roy hostage, stalked her every move, and spied on her. She had lied to him too, so she wanted to call it even. But she never imagined that he would be so nosy even about her prescription medications.Her life felt already ruined. But how much worse did he want to make it? How dare he? She could not tolerate the storming anger inside her.\u201cHow are we even called friends with benefits? You don\u2019t listen to me when I don\u2019t give you consent. Do you even consider me as a human being? You cage me, question me, watch me! Do you know how miserable it is to see Sebastian in the living room? There\u2019s nothing different between me and that dog you stuffed by yourself! I\u2019m not your possession!\u201dTae-jun picked a glass and threw it across the hall.Crack!The loud shattering of glass filled the room with an eerie silence once again. Yuri flinched at the sight of the glass hitting the wall and breaking into pieces.\u2e19\u2e19\u2e19Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Merciless and indiscriminate, he was hated by mortals and gods alike.The doctor before Davis looked at Yuri pathetically as he counseled about this God of Death. Unfortunately, his counseling was no help whatsoever. At least she had never felt a desire for Thanatos: self-destruction or death.It\u2019s a popular prognosis that those with suicidal tendencies also suffer from attention deficit syndrome or ADS. In severe cases, in a bid to garner attention, the patient resorts to self-infliction of pain. Slicing of the wrist, swallowing a handful of sleeping pills, etc, are a few of the common methods towards the same.However, Yuri had no such desire. Attention and death were never on her mind. If anything, she just wanted a chance to really relax. She wanted her head to stop aching, for those dreams that kept tormenting her to disappear, to get some deep, undisturbed sleep.The doctor had been wrong from the start- the one she truly desired was Thanatos\u2019 twin brother Hypnos, God of Sleep.And yet, she could swear that now was the only time she had ever wanted self-destruction and death. Right now, at this moment, the moment she met Tae-jun Seo\u2019s eyes.She felt a strong desire to become the vial that was thrashed by his hand, the pill that was mashed by his foot, or the glass that shattered into pieces. It was due to these morbid emotions that were surging within her that she had said the words that she should have kept to herself.\u201cDoes it annoy you that your Barbie doll is a drug addict? Does it disgust you that you made out with such filth?\u201d She sniggered, looking at the man the world touted as Mr. Perfect in the eye. Would he be considered as tainted now? Because of her \u2026Tae-jun\u2019s face turned whiter than a sheet and stiffer than a mannequin. He fiercely gripped her chin.\u201cWhat did you just say?\u201dAlthough those were the words, his eyes were saying otherwise. One more word and he\u2019d kill her.Yuri\u2019s chin was so firmly grasped that she was unable to open her mouth. She gazed at him, incessantly gasping.\u201cI\u2019ve never thought of you that way and I never had the means to mistreat you. Nonetheless, if that\u2019s what you want, I guess why not.\u201dHis voice was agonizing, eyes seething with anger. He was thoroughly provoked, losing all sense of reason.Tae-jun pulled Yuri to the living room and shoved her onto the couch. The force was so great that she felt pain even though she had landed on a soft surface.He straddled on top of her and pressed on the slender body trying so hard to escape. He pushed his hand up her dress, yanked her underwe@r stripping her down naked to open her legs wide. Her lady parts twitched at the sudden coldness as the man savagely unbuckled his belt and pulled down his pants.Yuri became pale as a ghost.\u201cWh-what do you think you\u2019re doing?!\u201dObviously she was not wet at all. She was actually awkward and stiff from her agony and nervousness. However, Tae-jun\u2019s reaction was absolutely unsympathetic and hostile. He looked as if he was possessed by a fiendish madness that would heed to nothing and no one.\u201cShut up! Didn\u2019t you want to be treated this way?\u201d He forced her knees wide and penetr@ted at once.\u201cOw!\u201d Yuri whimpered in pain and abruptly twisted her body.His eager fondling was not enough to ease the pain of penetr@tion. Nevertheless, she was at a loss of words when he attacked her without even a notice. The pain was breathtaking. Veins popped up as she clenched on the couch.\u201cOpen up completely.\u201d He ordered.Then, seizing her thighs that were wreathed with marks made by his lips, he mercilessly shoved his manhood all the way through. He strenuously twisted his shaft inside of the narrow dry tunnel.Yuri flinched and bit her lips. The painful workout ultimately made her wet and slippery. When it became smoother for him to move, he grasped her hips and thrust forcefully.Was this also s*x? All she could feel was hot flesh pushing and pulling inside her. Ironically, her head, blood, and heart felt numb \u2026 frozen.This wasn\u2019t like any of the times she had had so far. In that, she would be seething from head to toe, there would not be an inch of her body inside and outside, that wasn\u2019t being driven to a frenzy. So much so, that at times she was worried she would lose herself from such great heat.No matter how exhausting or demanding those times had been, they were never this horrible. Not even the time when she was pulled into Tae-jun\u2019s arms after she had lost her memories felt this appalling. This act of pleasure had turned into abuse, a nightmare \u2026 gone was the intimacy and euphoria that it usually brought along. \u00a0She let the beast in him unleash its wrath, control her every move while she lay there limp, benumbed like a broken, lifeless doll.\u2e19 \u2e19 \u2e19If you want to support the Lunar Letters team, you can do so by pledging to us on Patreon and get to read advanced chapters of our novels!

You will see how the two are slaves of their own devils. \ud83d\udc94\u201cF*cking hell!\u201d Tae-jun cussed out loud as he was upset about everything.The man was in a treacherous limbo. A part of him was trying to dissuade and stop himself, fighting to bring back the trace rationality that was still lingering somewhere. But the rampant brutishness was impossible to restrain, overpowering him it surged until it reached a delirium that was out of his bounds.He pushed on her legs and pierced her from above, stabbing her womb with his shaft. Yuri desperately held in her moan, lying woodenly enduring his madness.They were still dressed. The only thing audible was their clothes brushing against each other\u2019s. No sounds of ple@sure were heard, no sighs or groans. Apart from the hand grabbing onto her to keep her from escaping, the only thing that was directly touching her body was his rod. The typical kisses, fondling, and cooing was all absent today.Also absent were sense and sanity, paving the way to an endless misery that was rapidly closing in on them at the moment, pushing them into its bottomless abyss.On his part, it seemed like Tae-jun was hell-bent on showing Yuri what \u2018mistreatment\u2019 was actually like. Her words had thoroughly roiled him, to an extent he even felt wronged, so he chose the method he did as retribution.As for her, she knew that against her better judgement, she had unleashed the demon and had to bear the brunt of it. She neither fought nor evaded it, letting it bury her.Pain has strange ways. Sometimes, it is not only the recipient who is plagued by it. As pain seeped deep through the touching bodies, the one punishing and the one being punished were both crying in agony. All that could be wanted was for time to pass. And yet, time ticked the slowest in these torturous moments.Yuri was incessantantly swinging around the couch when her eyes met Sebastian\u2019s. The glass eyes of the taxidermied dog, unfiltered, reflected the mess she was. Her heart tugged, courage gradually abandoned her. She didn\u2019t want to see it. She didn\u2019t want to face the reality \u2026 She firmly shut her eyes as if doing so would obliterate the truth.The manhood that was pushing and pulling gradually engorged. It\u2019ll be over soon. She tried to relieve herself. However, instead of ej@culating, Tae-jun grabbed her hair and stood up.Her eyes flew wide open at his spontaneous action. At that moment, something hot was squirted onto her face. What the \u2026 she was blank for a second.It took her some time to realize that the sour liquid on her eyebrow was his seed. Tae-jun\u2019s face was indifferent unlike someone who had just finished having s*x. He coldly looked down upon her.\u201cOpen up!\u201d He spoke between gritted teeth.Yuri could not dare to predict his intention. The fact that he had come on her face and treated her so insolently was enough to make her nauseous. The hot rod right in front of her eyes was still dripping with s*men.Blatantly disregarding her reaction, Tae-jun pressed her chin with one hand. Unable to endure the pressure, her mouth involuntarily opened. He immediately pushed his member between her lips.\u201cOh \u2026 oooop!\u201dThe man\u2019s heat and scent made it cumbersome to catch a breath. Not only did he squirt to fill her entire mouth, but also poked the deepest part of her throat. He did not let go of her hair even when she struggled to spit it out.\u201cLick it! Entirely!\u201dIt was a command. Yuri shook her head desperately to signal that it was too much for her to handle, but he ruthlessly ignored it all and kept putting pressure on her head.\u201cYou acknowledge yourself that you have no choice.\u201dHis glare had never been this threatening. She reluctantly licked his organ with her tongue. The thing that was inside her only a few minutes ago tasted sweet and erotic. \u00a0Only after she had licked and swallowed all of the come did he withdraw his shaft from her mouth.She desperately panted for air and vomited out a wild cough. Meanwhile, nonchalantly, he cleaned his clothes erasing all the remaining hints of s*x.\u201cHow more devastated do you want me to feel?\u201dThe murmur to himself was suffused with grief. She thought she was the one speaking the words.Without as much as a glance at the woman who was lying motionlessly on the floor, he walked across the living room, yanking the door loudly open and shutting it with the loudest bang.Yuri straightened up and looked in the direction the man had left. She did not feel like standing up or even wiping her mouth. .A significant amount of minutes later, she finally burst into tears. She was clearly the victim, nevertheless, she felt as if she had inflicted equal amount of pain she had received on Tae-jun.If you want to support the Lunar Letters team, you can do so by pledging to us on Patreon and get to read advanced chapters of our novels!

He\u2019d said he\u2019d be back after he took a call \u2026 but had just disappeared.Si-yeon has said Tae-jun and her were at Su-kwang Lee\u2019s conference, a prominent figure in the world of politics without a question. Because of the upcoming election, a number of candidates were attending the meeting as were these two scions.All of a sudden Tae-jun had stood up and excused himself on the pretext of a phone call. Since he didn\u2019t return even after the event had drawn to a close, left with no choice at the man\u2019s abrupt exit, Si-yeon had covered for him with a logical excuse.How could he leave in the middle of such a vital event? What the hell\u2019s going on?! Did something major happen at work?No matter how hard he thought, he couldn\u2019t come up with a plausible answer for his cousin\u2019s uncharacteristic behaviour. It was not like he understood Tae-jun completely, but he knew him well enough to know that he wouldn\u2019t cast aside important work and walk out like he had.In the end, he simply threw up his hands and decided to tidy up the place to go home when the phone rang. It was a call from the bar manager. He checked the clock, it was nearing midnight. The bar was still open but was he thinking straight to contact an executive at this late in the night? Jae-won was bewildered as he answered the phone.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cI apologize for bothering you late at night, Director Lee, are you still at the office?\u201d\u201cI was just about to leave.\u201d Jae-won replied as he pushed his arm into his jacket sleeve. He was taking night shifts to work on planning for the Food and Beverage Festival next month.The manager\u2019s relieved voice sounded.\u201cIf you haven\u2019t gone home yet would you mind going to the private room to check on Director Seo?\u201dHotel Seoin did not have a director, so the director, in this case, had to be his cousin, Tae-jun Seo. Why was he at such a random place?\u201cIs Director Seo there with you?\u201d \u00a0Jae-won asked in a trice.\u201cYes. He\u2019s quite drunk.\u201dAccording to Si-yeon, it was 5 hours since he had burst out of his seat. How long has he been drinking?Jae-won frowned as he put on the rest of the jacket. Down at the hotel bar, the manager was waiting for him in front of the elevator.\u201cWhere is he?\u201d he asked walking out of the lift.\u201cHe\u2019s in the VIP room located all the way down the hallway.\u201d\u201cIs he by himself?\u201dThe manager nodded. \u201cYes, nobody came along. Not even a visitor.\u201dWell, if Tae-jun had anyone along with him, he wouldn\u2019t have received a call at this time of the night.The manager led him to the VIP room. He knocked without expecting an answer and opened the door right away. This was an action that would most definitely follow with a severe consequence, but the man inside the room was way too dazed \u2026 maybe even completely unconscious.Not far from what he had expected to see, but Jae-won\u2019s jaw still dropped in awe. The smell of alcohol and smoke stung his nose, as it fogged up the private room that could hold at least thirty people. And in the centre of it all was a man, with the aura of an emperor, sloshed and sprawled on the table.\u201cHow much did he drink? He couldn\u2019t have possibly drunk all of those on the table?\u201dThe manager sincerely shook his head. \u201cThere should be a few more bottles on the floor.\u201dJae-won nearly cussed out loud.Is he out of his mind?!\u2e19\u2e19\u2e19The dimly lit room, shrouded in cigarette haze and suffused with the stench of alcohol, looked nothing like the plush VIP room befitting the scion of Seoin Group. Right now, there was little difference between here and a lowly bar. And sprawled on the table, surrounded by god knows how many empty bottles on the table as well as the floor, the man that Korea held in awe and reverence made for a startling centrepiece.Tae-jun had a high tolerance for alcohol. This was proudly ingrained in his blood and who better than Jae-won to vouch for it. How many times this fellow beat him and his father in a drinking battle? It would not be an exaggeration to say his cousin was the personification of the phrase \u2018drink like a fish\u2019.Thus, it was unimaginable how much Tae-jun drank to be so out of control. It was as if he drank more alcohol than elephant water.\u201cHow long has it been? You should\u2019ve called me before he got THIS wasted.\u201d Jae-won chastised the manager.\u201cHe didn\u2019t drink for long. An hour or two maybe. You know how the director drinks up to six hours when he\u2019s in the mood.\u201d The manager offered a meek explanation.If it was so, then something must have pissed him off real hard. If he emptied all of these bottles in just two hours, he must\u2019ve chugged the alcohol directly from the bottles. It wasn\u2019t unexpected, but it was hard to picture. One doesn\u2019t get pissed off because one simply wants to. Most essentially, he was a man who got everything he wanted.Jae-won shook Tae-jun several times, then gave up and ordered the manager to get an employee to help move him to the suite. The fellow was still as a corpse the whole time he was moved into the room and on the bed.Who would have thought there would come a day when the boss of all drinking contests would lie like this. All alone in the room, Jae-won sighed as he noticed the careless creases on the bespoke tuxedo his cousin was wearing.\u201cWhat did I do to deserve such a plight? I can\u2019t go home, instead I\u2019m taking clothes off of this grown-ass man!\u201d Jae-won grumbled as he headed to Tae-jun\u2019s closet to hang his clothes for him.Right then, his hands holding the hanger stilled; there was a whisper from the direction of the passed out man.Tae-jun in his limbo seemed to have called out a name.Huh?

He first hung Tae-jun\u2019s clothes, took out two water bottles from the refrigerator and placed them near his cousin\u2019s head. It was an act of kindness in case he woke in the middle of the night due to thirst. After that, without an extra glance at the unconscious man, he turned off the lights and strode out of the suite.\u201cAre you heading home? Should I contact the driver?\u201d The manager on his night shift noticed Jae-won and greeted him courteously.\u201cI forgot something at the office. I\u2019ll take care of the driver. \u201dJae-won returned to his office with a stiffened expression and turned on the computer. He booted the program and typed in the security code. Then, he recklessly opened up a file. He found what he was looking for. He let out a small cry at the name that popped up on the screen.\u201cOh my goodness!\u201dHe roughly rubbed his face with his dry hands. Suddenly everything started to make sense: every inconceivable thing Tae-jun had done <b>finally</b> made sense.The file that Jae-won was looking at was a list of guests who had canceled their hotel reservation.

The youngest just started freshman year in high school.\u201d He replied with a depressed voice.\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry to hear, but I also understand how you\u2019re feeling. My youngest is also in high school,\u201d Jin-wook said calmly.And thus, the two men nonchalantly chatted about life and other important things as they drank. Jin-wook decided\u00a0 to get to the point when the bottle was almost empty.\u201cDriver Su-won Han \u2026 What was he like as a person?\u201d\u201cYou mean Mr. Han? To be exact, Mr. Han was called a \u2018driver,\u2019 but actually, he wasn\u2019t someone who should be working under others. He graduated from a prestigious college, you see, and he even owned a business in Seoul.\u201d There was a degree of respect in his voice, and he truly meant every word of praise.Jin-wook was a little surprised. Throughout his research so far, this was something he hadn\u2019t come across. He had assumed the man would be an ordinary blue collar at the most, surely not a learned one.\u201cThen why did he work as a driver for President Jin?\u201d he asked.A graduate from an ordinary college could easily find a white collar job to say nothing of people like Su-won Han who had passed out of prestigious college. So, this man had chosen to toil for a scum like Myung-je Jin when he could be sitting in a posh office in a business suit.\u201cThe two were neighbourhood friends since childhood. I heard Han borrowed quite some money from Jin when he was expanding his business and his wife got ill. Later, he even took out loans under Jin\u2019s name. Jin was a President, but he wasn\u2019t a brainy one. All he knew was how to order gangsters to break a few things here and there. So when the business expanded, he wanted a person he could trust and rely on, but someone he could look down upon at the same time.\u201d\u201cAnd that was Mr. Han.\u201d Jin-wook concluded in the end.\u201cYou can put it that way.\u201dThe man ordered another bottle of alcohol and opened the lid. Jin-wook who was busy jotting down in a small notebook popped a question.\u201cHow well do you know of Mr. Han\u2019s accident?\u201d\u201cJust as much as the newspaper articles. It did seem quite odd, though. Mr. Han never drank typically because he didn\u2019t know when President Jin would call for him. But a man like him ran towards a car intoxicated-\u201d\u201cDid you see Mr. Han on the day of the accident by any chance?\u201d Jin-wook probed.\u201cThe day of the accident? To be frank, Mr. Han had gone missing a few days before the incident. There was someone else driving President Jin around.\u201dThis was news, nowhere had he come across this. And needless to say, the seeds of doubts were sprouting. Jin-wook dug in.\u201cWhat has happened?\u201d\u201cWell, he had quite a big argument with President Jin.\u201d\u201cBecause of what?\u201dThe man was more than willingly chirping the whole story non-stop when suddenly, he shut his mouth like a clam. A puzzled Jin-wook stared at the man.The man awkwardly tried to change the topic. \u201cWorking outdoors is so cumbersome now that I\u2019m an old man. I would like to switch to a position that works inside of the hotel before the weather gets any colder.\u201dThe man\u2019s intentions were obvious. He was expecting a reward for helping. Well, there are no free lunches, and who better than the cadaver dog Jin-wook to know it best? He simply nodded in assent.\u201cThat would depend on what you are able to give me. Do you have anything special you would like to share with me?\u201dThe man\u2019s eyes glistened as he happily noticed an opportunity. He said slyly, \u201cI have the security camera footage of President Jin and Mr. Han arguing in the hotel lobby. To be honest, Jin had told me to delete it, but I kept a backup just in case. Now that Jinseong Construction is out of business and Jin dead, I thought it had become irrelevant, but like they say nobody knows what the future holds.\u201d He smiled in satisfaction apparently basking in self-praise on being insightful.\u201cI\u2019ll make sure to report it to the executives. I don\u2019t have the right to make decisions about the reward by myself.\u201d Jin-wook stated matter-of-factly.\u201cHope to hear from you.\u201dAs an afterthought, Jin-wook asked, \u201cBy any chance, is there anyone else who knows about the argument between President Jin and Mr. Han?\u201d\u201cHyeon-ah Kim.\u201d The man muttered a name and looked up. \u201cRight, she should know about it. That day, I was late to work because my shift started in the afternoon. I got a hang of what was going on only after I watched the security camera footage. The person in charge of the lobby was Hyeon-ah Kim that day.\u201dHyeon-ah Kim. Jin-wook cringed as the face of a woman with a kind smile and hidden intentions appeared in his mind. She was a woman he could not predict even after years of working with all sorts of people.The man emptied the last glass and got up from his seat. Something felt very strange. He didn\u2019t expect things to become so serious when he initially started his search for Yuri Han. Looking at how things were panning, even a veteran investigator like him couldn\u2019t help wonder- What was at the end of all this?\u2e19Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Just as he was stepping out of the elevator, he bumped into Manager Choi right in front of the director\u2019s office.Jin-wook was familiar with Manager Choi, as she had worked for Tae-jun for quite a few years. He also knew that she was to accompany Yuri Han to America.Isn\u2019t she supposed to be on the plane right now? Then why is she standing here?Unable to hold in his curiosity, Jin-wook asked her.\u00a0 \u201cWeren\u2019t you supposed to go to America today? Why are you still here?\u201d\u201cYeah, but it got suddenly canceled.\u201d Manager Choi replied.\u201cCancelled?! Why?\u201d He was taken aback.\u201cI\u2019m not sure. I think they had an argument \u2026 he told me not to let her out of the house for a while.\u201dAn argument, for what reason? Jin-wook made a mental note to ask Tae-jun about it as he entered the assistant\u2019s office. when he spotted him, Manager Lee sent him a desperate signal for help.Something\u2019s up. Jin-wook gently knocked and entered the director\u2019s office. Tae-jun was going over his paperwork.\u201cYou must have had a bit too much drink.\u201dTae-jun was hiding his face with a pair of very thick glasses, but Jin-wook was able to notice easily. In college, the two used to go to bars to drink, although he never won against Tae-jun in drinking games.\u201cI guess I lost control.\u201dThe last time he lost control so dramatically was four years ago, after confirming Hye-yeon Jin\u2019s death. But didn\u2019t he have the woman by his side right now? If he allowed her to go to America in the first place, they must\u2019ve been close enough to be friends.Tae-jun handed the papers to Jin-wook without adding any words. \u201cIt\u2019s about K Pharmaceuticals. Find the bastard that vanished and deal with him firsthand. And make sure to follow me on the trip to Busan the day after tomorrow.\u201dNormally Manager Lee joined the business trips, but from how he asked Jin-wook to go instead, this trip must be confidential.\u201cIs it complicated to explain?\u201dJin-wook asked.\u201cA little. Some iffy stuff in between things.\u201d Tae-jun impassively replied.\u201cHow many employees would you like to bring?\u201d\u201cNo need for many. Two would be enough.\u201d\u201cYes sir. Oh, and about the investigation on Yuri Han\u2019s father-\u201d\u201cPut that on hold for now.\u201d Tae-jun sharply interrupted Jin-wook. He frowned and took off his glasses. Then he massaged his temples as if he had a headache.\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d Jin-wook was confused. He was the one who wanted him to dig, and yet now he seemed uninterested \u2026\u201cDon\u2019t want to see for a while.\u201d He clarified.However, the sensitive Jin-wook noticed the voice full of aching. He doesn\u2019t want to see what for a while. The research? Possibly Yuri Han? But he knew better than to prod, the reticent man had already said too much. In the end, he just kept his silence and exited the office.All alone in his office now, Tae-jun rose and walked to the window, took out a cigarette, and leaned on the sill. He didn\u2019t want to see. He didn\u2019t want to see whom? He didn\u2019t want to see \u2026 the reflection of himself in the window.There was no denying that what he had done last night was r*pe. Since when did he treat women that way? The man was a ruthless, savage master, but never had he forced himself onto anyone. Neither was he wanton nor willful when it came to women. He had always treated them in a dignified manner, else why would he be so sought after by the fairer sex despite changing partners often?Anger and disdain culminated into self-hatred and together they devoured every iota of his being. His act was no different from that of a savage beast \u2026 abominable &amp; heinous. No amount of self-loathing could purge his barbarism.Truth was, he wasn\u2019t mad at the drug itself. He was mad at how she treated her body so carelessly. Like it were an object that wasn\u2019t concerned with herself \u2026 it was like she had a death wish, indulging in those medicines. But the bigger truth was, he was furious that she was ruining the body that would one day bear <b>his</b> children.Yes, that was the actual triggering factor \u2026<b>It\u2019s just the way you know. I did drugs. So what? And what does that have to do with you?</b><b>There\u2019s no difference between me and that dog you stuffed by</b><b>yourself! I\u2019m not your possession!</b><b>Does it annoy you that your Barbie doll is a drug addict? Does it disgust you that you made out with such filth?</b>Yuri\u2019s dramatic reaction was shocking enough to derange Tae-jun. He was so exasperated that his eyes alternated between red and black. He wanted to seem like a good man, but his effort to withhold his true emotions exposed his violent streak to the maximum. In the end, the demon within had reigned over and how.Scenes from the night inundated his senses \u2013 how Yuri turned her head away, shut her eyes allowing him to shake her body like a lifeless being. He didn\u2019t know when she had abandoned hope, but those stifled painful moans still pierced his heart.Why had he not noticed them then? Why had he gotten carried away by the savagery?!Pain was a byword to the ple@sures that would follow. Every time they had been intimate, no matter how much time he spent in caressing and stimulating her, she would still be wreathed with pain \u2026 he didn\u2019t dare imagine how much she had suffered when he had penetrated so forcefully without care or precaution? When he had hounded and pounded her underneath \u2026\u00a0 Even while trembling to her fingertips, she had not made a squeak. Except for the few errant mo*ns when he had moved intensely, the girl seemed to have shut her lips and the world around.Her response or lack thereof only served to infuriate him further. Had she cried out loud, screamed in pain, or even apologized, his fury wouldn\u2019t have been fueled to beyond limit, he would\u2019ve even been lenient towards her. The manner in which she had withstood it all was as if it were some kind of a challenge she had no choice but to go through. Needless to say, it was the very thing that had driven him crazy. It was as if the time they spent together was time for Yuri to patiently endure.I\u2019m just the worst.The man reflected in the window bitterly admitted his sin. He inhaled deeply into his cigarette and sighed out a puff of smoke. The smoke veiled the man.\u2e19\u2e19\u2e19Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You can\u2019t leave the house for a while.The guards had blocked Yuri\u2019s way to the airport. With bag and baggage, she stood at the door in a daze. The first-class ticket to New York City in hand became but a useless piece of trash. And as such, her sentence had begun.Only the man knew how many days she would be spending locked within the walls of this house. In the end, she had no choice but to come up with a last-minute excuse to her uncle for her abrupt cancellation of plans.Manager Choi could not stay still out of guilt although the situation was not her fault. But no matter how sorry she felt, there was nothing she could do. Pity the girl as she may, but the truth was she lacked all the courage to go against her master.A lot had changed since that night. Some changes were shocking, while some expected. \u00a0Sebastian had moved elsewhere. Yes, the taxidermied dog that had adorned the mantle in the living room had relinquished his abode of years giving the place a somewhat deserted feel.The master of the house had not returned once, not even his shadow had been spotted on the premises. The clothes, shoes, and bags that were occasionally delivered had stopped too. Those were no ordinary gifts. Even Yuri, who had no interest in fashion brands, could tell they were all from the most luxurious designer brands. \u00a0As such the house only had her and the servants along with Manager Choi and bodyguards.It had been a while since she had had quiet nights especially after getting together with Tae-jun. Most nights she would be so spent that before she even knew it she would have slipped into a deep slumber. She didn\u2019t prefer to sleep that way but what choice did she have in the matter. She was someone who liked her nights peaceful, perhaps \u2018cause she was apprehensive about the man?Why then was she having a hard time sleeping now since she was left to her peace?That\u2019s right, \u2018ever since\u2019 sleep had evaded her. She would just lay in her bed, surrounded in darkness, staring at the ceiling \u2026 letting her mind wander to where not \u2026 but sleep, she did not.And today was no exception. After hours of turning off the lights and lying in bed, she was still fidgeting wide awake. She pressed her head onto the pillow and counted the days. One, two, three \u2026 it had already been a week now.The first two days were absolutely intimidating. So much so that she jumped at her own shadow. She was afraid that Tae-jun would come back to embrace her body \u2026 violently once again. She was scared she would be pinned down again and rammed into mercilessly. She was battered and bruised, mentally and physically \u2026 and the wounds just refused to heal.When the third day arrived, she still couldn\u2019t shake the man off her chest. His deep dark eyes, frigid voice, nonchalant visage kept haunting her, no matter how tight she closed her eyes, shut her ears. Thus, the girl was confined in a dismal dungeon that she just couldn\u2019t escape from.The changes in her behaviour didn\u2019t go unnoticed by Manager Choi. Although she didn\u2019t know the exact situation of their relationship, she saw that Yuri was preoccupied with thoughts of Tae-jun day in and day out. She was an experienced lady, so although she didn\u2019t know what had transpired between the two, she still felt sympathetic towards the girl who was on house arrest now. So, this day, she had subtly apprised her on the director\u2019s impending business trip to Busan.He must loathe me now. He\u2019ll never look for me again. Then \u2026 what will happen to the contract? Well actually, it\u2019s good if it ends here. A relationship with an expiration might as well let it expire early.\u201cAh!\u201dYuri cried out and put her hand on her forehead. She had begun to hear voices again, this happened every time she was sleep deprived. She had not slept for days together, so it was only natural to experience them now. It would begin with images constantly hounding her, followed by a voice echoing in her mind. Slowly the images would disappear, leaving behind just the voice.She tried to block it by reading a book or watching TV, but each time she was interrupted by a constant headache. No matter what she did, she couldn\u2019t rid herself of the torture. She had lost her appetite now, eating meals were akin to a task. She carried it out mechanically, just because her body needed it.When she held her pencil and drew to kill time, without her realizing, she would end up sketching the one face. Each time she would capture a different facade \u2026 a sober face, his angry mien \u2026 when he was focused on s*x, his smile, frown \u2026 every emotion she had seen would be traced, sheet after sheet. And when she would be done, she would sit gazing at her creation for a long, long time.A week, 7 days, 168 hours. Actually, it\u2019s been longer now?Yuri shook, turned her head again, and thought about the meaning behind it all. Going through these motions like clockwork every day, what was the use? Where was she getting to? Her health was on a downward spiral from drug withdrawal. How much longer could she take it? Now that she wasn\u2019t getting enough sleep, she was missing the rough s*x she had with him. She wasn\u2019t sure if she was falling asleep or losing her consciousness.How much more devastated do you want me to feel?The woe filled voice lingered on in her ears, tugging at her heart even now. In all honesty, she had never wanted to make him feel miserable. Instead, she was trying to conceal her own miseries from him. When he had barged in demanding an answer, she was flustered and infuriated that her most embarrassing secret had been exposed. She was desperately fumbling to cover it up and chose defiance as her shield. The truth was murky, she unkempt- how could she strip herself before him?Funny how she wanted to appear flawless before him like something one can never achieve no matter how hard and badly one wanted it. Something that stayed in the heart, like a dream or an illusion. Just like how he was to her.In the end, Tae-jun had shattered her dream to pieces, shredded the fantasy, and abruptly pulled her back to reality.When the ringing in her ears became louder, she frantically got up from the bed. There was no way she could go to sleep tonight. She hurriedly went down to the basement, perhaps the aimless doodling would bring her some respite. If not, the ringing was sure to drive her insane.Inexplicably, the scent of the paint and wood in the basement studio soothed her taut nerves. Yuri took a deep gulp of air, turned on the lights, and started sifting through her sketchbook. Right then, a small envelope fell to the ground from between the pages. It was something that was mixed with gifts from Tae-jun.As soon as she caught sight of the envelope, Yuri instinctively knew it\u2019s the same thing from last time. She could ask Manager Choi to get rid of it but she let it stay. Maybe she wanted to remind herself that the two might be playing a couple, but in fact, their relationship was nothing more than a passing affair. No matter how pitiful it was to think about it, it was still true.Yuri debated on whether she should open the envelope or not. As she fiddled with it, she could feel the contents, it seemed like there were photographs inside. Whoever had sent it, seemed to have a penchant for sending photos, this was the second time she was receiving one.She had a feeling, just like last time, these photos would bring her no good. Thinking up to her, she casually ripped it open but what greeted her was beyond her imagination \u2026 she screamed her guts out.\u201cWha-What is this?!\u201dIf you want to support the Lunar Letters team, you can do so by pledging to us on Patreon and get to read advanced chapters of our novels!

Most of them were shots of a man and a woman. They appeared to be on a date like a normal couple, except for the fact that the red lines across the woman\u2019s face made them extremely grotesque. They were all photos of herself and Tae-jun in Jinseong.Ho- how \u2026 Why would anybody \u2026?One by one her gaze rested on the photos on the floor, each was eerier than the one before. However, her pupils widened when she noticed one particular photo. It was during her high school graduation, she and Hye-yeon were standing next to each other with their graduation caps on. Yuri looked at her young face \u2026<The Whore who Killed her Friend!>\u201cOH GOOOODDD!\u201dShe shrieked at the offensively squiggled scarlet handwriting. She could feel a thin barrier in her head crack as she lost control of her emotions. It was frightening. Too frightening for her to handle. Her attention was drawn to her deathly silent surroundings. She was used to this creepy aura. It was happening again. She was being sucked into her thoughts as her emotions engorged and exploded.Yuri hastily picked up the photos and ran to the library. She nervously bit on her nails as her quaking fingers inserted them into the shredder. Perhaps because the ambience was shrouded in pin-drop silence, the shredder\u2019s soft chomping felt especially loud. As she stood there looking at the pictures going through the blades, she felt a sudden splitting pain in her head like it was her and not the pictures that were in the shredder right now. \u00a0It hurt, it hurt her so much. Her hands instinctively started looking for medication, at least her sleeping pill \u2026As if stimulated by the groping fingers, a spark of memory jolted her awake. Back when she had just moved into the house, she had trouble sleeping at night. When she stayed awake for three days straight, Tae-jun had reluctantly handed her sleeping pills. She clearly remembered they were on the shelf. Since nothing was touched in this empty house, the pills should still be there. Yuri impatiently opened the shelf.\u2e19The car had just passed the tollgate to Seoul. Four hours had passed since they had left for Busan. Jin-wook checked on Tae-jun through the rearview mirror. The man had drunk quite a lot in the last dinner meeting. Actually, he drank a lot during the whole 3-day trip but not to the point that it would affect his work. Even so, Jin-wook decided to stay vigilant in case the man might act out strangely.\u201cWhere would you like to go?\u201dEyes shut, Tae-jun rolled his body into a ball in the backseat. He didn\u2019t reply. He must still be drunk.\u201cLet\u2019s go home,\u201d Jin-wook said, still keeping an eye on the rear seat.Tae-jun slowly opened his eyes, he must not have been asleep.\u201cHome?\u201d He mumbled.Jin-wook replied with a brief \u2018yes\u2019 and without waiting for an answer switched directions.Ever since childhood, Tae-jun referred to the house in which he lived with his grandfather as the \u2018main house\u2019. The only place he called \u2018home\u2019 was the house in which he stayed with Yuri Han. When they entered the neighbourhood, Tae-jun ordered Jin-wook to park the car in front of the house. It was past midnight, the street had returned to tranquility. There was not a single drunk trooping around this safe neighbourhood.The team of security guards outside the house greeted Tae-jun politely. Against everyone\u2019s expectation, the boss did not get out of the car. Instead, he took out a cigarette and sat there quietly.Jin-wook rolled down the backseat window half-way. The night breeze was cold as ever but quite potent to recover from a hangover. The white smoke melted into the darkness. Tae-jun looked up at the house and took a deep puff. Jin-wook simply let him be.He finally spoke up as he bit onto his second cigarette. \u201cReminds me of the past.\u201d\u201cWhen do you mean?\u201d\u201cWhen Hye-yeon Jin- I mean- Yuri Han went missing.\u201dHe was saying things he normally would keep to himself. He must still be drunk. Jin-wook silently kept listening.As for the inebriated man, he ignored the other\u2019s lack of reaction and kept talking slowly. \u201cBefore I even notice it, I always end up in front of this house. Just like now.\u201dJin-wook met eyes with Tae-jun through the rearview mirror. When it came to himself, Tae-jun was extremely strict. He usually slept for two to three hours only, stayed up all night at work, never took a vacation like his peers, at least not to exotic locations. These were Director Seo\u2019s famous characteristics, a thorough workaholic was what the world viewed him as.Guess it wasn\u2019t true tonight for Tae-jun, a cigarette between his fingers, whiled away his time doing nothing but gazing at the house ahead that had not a single light turned on. He seemed too afraid to enter the house that was wreathed in his marks.As if aware of the outside situation, a light was turned on in the house. Tae-jun\u2019s eyes followed the light.\u201c \u2026 It\u2019s by the library. What time is it?\u201d\u201cIt has just turned 3 AM. \u201dHe frowned. \u201cI guess she can\u2019t sleep.\u201d His murmur showed a hint of affection.Jin-wook carefully asked him. \u201cAren\u2019t you going in?\u201dTae-jun was at a loss for words for a minute. \u201cNo. Not today. I can\u2019t.\u201dHe rolled up the windows and leaned his head on the back seat.\u201cLet\u2019s go to the main house.\u201d When Tae-jun felt the movement of the car, he closed his eyes.You don\u2019t listen to me when I don\u2019t give you consent. Do you even consider me as a human being?I\u2019m not your possession!It was not like he wasn\u2019t tempted to go into the house, he did long to see her. But when her cries came rushing back to him, he turned numb. How much pain she must have been in \u2026 how savagely he had hurt her, damaged her body. \u00a0How selfish he had been \u2026 No, he didn\u2019t want to repeat the mistake.Only he knew the kind of willpower he had to muster to rein in his impatience, change the destination of the car, and arduously try to eliminate any thoughts of going to her.\u2e19\u2e19\u2e19If you want to support the Lunar Letters team, you can do so by pledging to us on Patreon and get to read advanced chapters of our novels!
