The weather in early spring was perfect, and the sunset glow reflected on her fair face.Yunping Mountain is far away for her, but there are many rare wild herbs in the mountain, so it is worthwhile for her to come all the way early in the morning.After coming out of the trail at the foot of the mountain and turning into the official road, Wei Ruo heard a group of noisy voices not far away.A luxurious carriage was parked on the side of the road, surrounded by many attendants, there was a great battle.Wei Ruo stopped, and after thinking for a while, with the mentality that more things are worse than less things, he pretended not to see, bowed his head and continued to move forward.However, these people still found her. A man in Chinese clothes walked over quickly and stood in front of Wei Ruo: \u201cWhere is the nearest medical center?\u201dThe voice is urgent, and the expression is a little scary.\u201cThere is no medical clinic nearby. The nearest one is in the county seat, which is seventy or eighty miles away.\u201d Wei Ruo answered with a bow.\u201cWhat about Wen Po? Is there a village near here with Wen Po?\u201d the man asked again.\u201cNo.\u201dWei Ruo\u2019s answer made the man\u2019s face even more ugly.Seeing that the man stopped asking questions, Wei Ruo didn\u2019t want to meddle in other people\u2019s business, so he turned around and planned to leave.Just two steps away, I heard a woman\u2019s screams from inside the carriage, and the anxious voices of the maids:\u201cMadam, hold on, Madam is fine, we will find the doctor soon.\u201d\u201cFoot, I see a foot, what should I do? It\u2019s a foot! It\u2019s about to kill someone!\u201d\u201cWater, bring hot water and ginseng tea!\u201dWei Ruo frowned and couldn\u2019t help but stop.The person in the car should be giving birth and the situation is critical.Do you want to take care of it?It\u2019s better not to worry about it, it\u2019s easy to cause trouble if you manage it, and this group of people doesn\u2019t seem easy to mess with!Just as he decided to continue walking, there was another scream of a woman.How does this make her go! Life is at stake, as a child!Wei Ruo glanced back at his bamboo basket, pondered for two seconds, and finally couldn\u2019t hold back, and chose to turn around and walk back.Seeing Wei Ruo approaching the carriage, the followers immediately stopped her.\u201cI know a little bit of medical skills, and there are some freshly picked herbs in the bamboo basket. If you choose to believe, let me go into the carriage right now, or I will leave now.\u201dWei Ruo succinctly gave the man two choices.Answer quickly, if he says he won\u2019t treat her, she will turn around and leave immediately, saving trouble!The man\u2019s mind is dumb at the moment, he heard the maid said that he saw the feet, if the feet come out first when a woman gives birth, it means half of her body has entered the gate of hell!At this time, there was another screaming sound from inside the carriage, hitting the man\u2019s heart heavily.The man has no time to think anymore: \u201cI\u2019ll give you a chance to try, keep my wife and children, and the prosperity and wealth are indispensable to you!\u201dWith approval, Wei Ruoda stepped into the carriage.In the carriage, a gorgeously dressed woman was moaning in pain, with sweat all over her head, and her hands were tightly clutching the maid next to her.Wei Ruo lowered his head and looked down at the woman. The amniotic fluid had already broken, but the fetus was in an abnormal position and the labor was difficult.Fortunately, the amniotic fluid has not flowed out, and the fetus\u2019 legs have not yet fully entered the birth canal.Wei Ruo took out a cloth bag from the bamboo basket, which contained acupuncture kits and some commonly used medicines.Take two dried ginseng slices and take them out for the woman to suck, and tell the maid to get some water, preferably sugar water tonic soup, for the woman to feed.Wei Ruo comforted the woman: \u201cDon\u2019t cry, don\u2019t shout, save your strength, I will give you an injection to relieve the pain, and then help you to position the fetus. Don\u2019t be nervous, just relax as much as possible.\u201dWhat? Upright fetal position?The fetal position is correct at this time?Do you still need a needle?The maidservants on both sides turned pale when they heard this.This is something that the most experienced women in Beijing dare not do! At this time, the fetal position is too dangerous!Wei Ruo didn\u2019t talk nonsense, and quickly washed his hands with the hot water on the carriage, opened the acupuncture bag, picked up the thin and long silver needles, untied the woman\u2019s clothes, and accurately inserted the needles in several positions.After a while, more than a dozen silver needles were stuck on the woman\u2019s body, which eased the woman\u2019s pain.Then, under the disbelieving eyes of the two servant girls, they stuffed the child\u2019s protruding feet back!The pupils of the maids trembled, and they almost screamed out.Wei Ruo then put his hands on his belly, gestured as if doing Tai Chi, and pressed the fetus in the abdomen to rotate slowly.The two maids in the carriage saw this scene and were once again speechless in shock. The child in their stomach was really moving!Time passed by minute by minute, and the people waiting outside the carriage became more and more anxious, as if they were being roasted on the stove.Is that girl really okay?Can you? What if it doesn\u2019t work\u2026how?God bless, Buddha bless!An hour later, the cry of a baby broke through the haze that enveloped everyone.Everyone looked at the carriage in great surprise, and burst into bursts of cheers.Accompanied by the cheers from outsiders, Wei Ruo in the carriage took care of the child\u2019s umbilical cord, and then cleaned up the mother to stop the bleeding.Wiping the sweat from his forehead, Wei Ruo let out a long breath, and then dragged his tired body out of the carriage.As soon as he finished speaking, he could go in and see his wife, the man in Chinese clothes couldn\u2019t wait to get on the carriage to see his wife.After a while, under the reminder of his wife, the man got out of the car and came to look for Wei Ruo. He wanted to thank Wei Ruo and give him a big reward, but found that the woman who had just saved his wife had disappeared\u2026He clearly promised that woman that he would give her glory and wealth, why did he leave without saying goodbye?Walking on the small road home, Wei Ruo began to feel pain in the flesh.Just gave the woman some ginseng slices, and used herbal medicine to stop bleeding. It was worth a lot of money!Wei Ruo secretly thought, next time something like this happens, she must ask for some reward!Wei Ruo walked towards home with a bamboo basket on his back. He could finish the journey home in more than an hour, but he exhausted too much energy when saving people, and he couldn\u2019t walk the rest of the way.Three hours later, a separate courtyard appeared in front of Wei Ruo.This is the place where Wei Ruo lived for ten years: pitch-black tiles, gray walls, chrome-blue bricks, vaguely dilapidated.It\u2019s Qixi Festival, what are you guys doing, I\u2019m posting a new article(end of this chapter)Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",

How dangerous it is!\u201dWhile speaking, Xiumei had skillfully taken Wei Ruo\u2019s bamboo basket and carried it on her back.\u201cGood Meimei, I didn\u2019t go up the dangerous cliff, really! There are many rare medicinal herbs on the mountain, which are worth a lot of money. If I don\u2019t pick them, I will be reckless!\u201d\u201cThat won\u2019t work! Your body is not as strong as mine! Even if you want to go, you have to take me with you! The master you invited taught me so much kung fu, I have to use it!\u201d\u201cWho will cook for me when I bring you up the mountain? My good plums and my five internal organs temple are all counting on you!\u201d Wei Ruo said coquettishly.Today\u2019s trip was exhausting for her. Her stamina bar had been exhausted after running long distances to collect herbs, and she was about to be useless after giving birth.\u201cI\u2019ll make it for you when I come back! You ran to the mountains alone, and I was worried at home. The rice couldn\u2019t be cooked properly, and I couldn\u2019t tell the difference between salt and sugar!\u201dXiumei stomped her feet.\u201cI\u2019m hungry.\u201d Wei Ruo looked up at Xiumei eagerly.\u201cMiss, you changed the subject again!\u201d Xiumei was helpless.\u201cDon\u2019t starve me, you see I\u2019m so thin.\u201d Wei Ruo rubbed his belly, implying that it was in place.When he was just saving people, he didn\u2019t even frown when he was in such a critical situation, but now he is acting cute and cute with his maid for a meal.\u201cOkay, okay, it\u2019s been done a long time ago, it\u2019s all simmering in the stove, it\u2019s hot! I\u2019ll go and serve it to you.\u201dXiumei turned around and entered the kitchen while muttering.There is no way, who made their lady\u2019s food-hungry eyes so painful? I can\u2019t stand it!The yard where Wei Ruo lives is full of various plants, including ornamental flowers, medicinal materials, and crops.The only space is reserved for a stone table. When the weather is good, Wei Ruo likes to eat, drink tea and bask in the sun at the stone table.This is a separate courtyard of the He family, and there are only two people living here, Wei Ruo and her maid, Xiumei.If Wei Ruo crossed over, she became a supporting actress in the book.In the original book, she is the daughter of the Wei family, a family of officials, who was taken away by the He family, a family of merchants.When he was raised in the He family of merchants until he was three years old, he was ordered by a fortune teller to say that he would kill his parents, so he was sent to this other courtyard.Only Wei Ruo\u2019s nanny and maid Xiumei came together.After that, the He family sent five taels of silver every month, and they stopped asking.Even during the holidays, Wei Ruo never saw them again.Now Wei Ruo is thirteen years old, and has lived in this Zhuangzi for ten full years.For Wei Ruo, she likes life in Zhuangzi very much, and likes dealing with the villagers.She doesn\u2019t want to go back to He\u2019s house, nor to her biological parents\u2019 house, because in the original book, whether she is in He\u2019s house or in her biological parents\u2019 house, she has a very difficult life.Early next morning, after breakfast, Wei Ruo and Xiumei went out together.The other courtyard where Wei Ruo lives is backed by hills, and there are large tracts of farmland just outside the door.It is the busy season of farming, and the villagers are busy transplanting rice seedlings in the fields.When Wei Ruo passed by, the villagers greeted her one after another.\u201cRuoruo, my boss hunted a rabbit up the mountain today, I left you a rabbit leg, remember to ask Xiumei to take it back later!\u201d\u201cMiss Ruo\u2019er, I picked some water celery today, and I will share it with you. Let Xiumei take it.\u201d\u201cMiss Ruoer, the medicine you gave last time is really useful, my tiger will be fine after taking it!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dWei Ruo greeted them and came to his field.Like everyone else, she took off her shoes, stepped barefoot into the muddy rice fields, and started planting rice seedlings.Xiumei persuaded Wei Ruo several times to rest beside her and let her do it, but Wei Ruo insisted on doing it herself.Because she has a reason to plant it herself.Wei Ruo has a space, which appeared during time travel. The entrance of the space is in the palm of her left hand, with a red spot, like a cinnabar mole.There is a simple thatched hut in the space. At first, the hut was empty and there was nothing.There is nothingness outside the thatched hut, a vast expanse of whiteness, as if shrouded in a thick fog.Later, Wei Ruo began to decorate the thatched hut. Over the course of several years, he added furniture, made arrangements, and stored items from the hut.As Wei Ruo built the interior of the thatched hut, the dense fog outside the house receded a bit, and a square of land about two meters by two meters appeared. Rice was planted on the land when it appeared.So Wei Ruo started planting rice, and when the rice was ripe and harvested, Wei Ruo gained experience points.After planting several times, the experience points were full, the space was upgraded, the thick fog in front of the house receded again, and a new piece of land of the same size appeared, and sweet potatoes were planted on the land at this time.At this time, Wei Ruo understood that her own space can be upgraded, and the experience needed to upgrade is obtained through her planting. After the experience value is full, she can upgrade. After the upgrade, new land and new seeds will appear.This is very similar to an online game \u201cHappy Farm\u201d that has been played for many years. You can gain experience by planting. After the experience is full, you can upgrade to get new plantable land and new seeds.Later, Wei Ruo took out the rice seeds in the space and planted them, and she also gained experience after harvesting, but only if she planted them herself, and the part that was distributed to the villagers could not gain experience.So whether she is in the space or outside the space, she needs to fight in person.The master and servant were busy, when suddenly two nuns and a group of people appeared on the field beside Wei Ruo.Seeing Wei Ruo standing barefoot in the mud with his face covered in mud, the two nuns showed disgusted expressions in unison.What does this look like? All the maids in the house are more decent than her!\u201cWe are the servants of the captain\u2019s mansion, and we are here to pick up the lady back to the mansion under the order of the master and his wife.\u201d The nanny explained the purpose of coming.The Captain\u2019s Mansion? Xiumei looked surprised, and asked: \u201cYou guys are mistaken, my young lady lives in the county town, and I don\u2019t know any school lieutenants.\u201d\u201cIt used to be, but from now on, it\u2019s no longer.\u201d One of the nuns said, \u201cMy master has already investigated clearly. When we were in Haining Mansion, the He family and our Mrs. Xiaowei gave birth in Guanyin Temple at the same time, and met rogues. Going into the mountain, I hugged the wrong child in my panic.\u201dAnother nun added: \u201cYour adoptive parents\u2019 family, that is, the He family who does business in the county, has agreed to us to pick you up.\u201dHearing that, Xiumei opened her mouth wide and was too surprised to speak.(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 3": "Chapter 3 - The biological parents came to pick me upPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 3 Biological parents came to pick him upWei Ruo looked at the two nuns and remained silent for a while.Just when the two nuns who came to pick him up thought that Wei Ruo was too surprised and overwhelmed, Wei Ruo opened his mouth and replied in a calm tone: \u201cGot it.\u201dKnowing that she is not an abandoned son of a merchant\u2019s family but a daughter of the school captain\u2019s mansion, her status has risen a big level all of a sudden, and her reaction is so calm?The two nuns looked at each other suspiciously.\u201cMiss, you can hear me clearly. We are from the Captain\u2019s Mansion. The ancestors of the Wei family have made meritorious deeds. You follow us back, and you will be the lady of the official family in the future.\u201d The nanny reiterated, thinking that Wei Ruo didn\u2019t understand. What does Xiaowei\u2019s mansion mean, so he behaves so calmly.\u201cWell, I heard it.\u201d Wei Ruo still had no waves on his face.The reason why Wei Ruo is so calm is because she already knew that such a day would come.What if she is not calm?The He family, who sent themselves to other courtyards to fend for themselves, had no feelings for her at all, and it was their wish to have a connection with the Captain\u2019s Mansion because of this erroneous relationship.And the Wei family is a family of officials after all. Once they know about the wrongdoing, they will definitely not let their biological daughter live outside and cause people to talk about it.As for Wei Ruo himself, he naturally doesn\u2019t want to go to the Wei family, but in this world where the hierarchy of monarchs and ministers is strict, there is no way Wei Ruo can\u2019t go back if he doesn\u2019t want to.\u201cThen miss, you can go with us. We will take you back to the school captain\u2019s mansion to meet your biological parents. You don\u2019t have to go to the He family. Our master has already made it clear to them that they are concerned about you returning to school with us.\u201d The Wei Mansion has no objections.\u201d Seeing that Wei Ruo had heard clearly, the nanny urged.This countryside is full of snakes, rats, insects and ants. It is dirty and poor. It is not a place for people to stay.Of course Wei Ruo knew that the He family had no objection to this matter. They had no feelings for themselves, and they were eager to cling to the Colonel\u2019s Mansion. Naturally, the Colonel\u2019s Mansion would do whatever they wanted.\u201cI need to go back and pack my things first.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t need to take the things here, they are all in the Captain\u2019s Mansion.\u201dWhat good things can she have here? It\u2019s better to throw it to the captain\u2019s mansion and use a new one.\u201cI use my own stuff.\u201dAlthough the two nuns have opinions in their hearts, it is not good to express their dissatisfaction to the future master of the family, so they can only follow her wishes.Wei Ruo came up from the rice field after planting the seedlings in his hands, tidied them up, and led Xiumei back to the house to tidy them up.Different from the dilapidated exterior walls, the furnishings in the house are much more refined.I packed up my things, and brought all the valuable things, as well as the jars Wei Ruo stored in the warehouse, and all the dried medicinal materials.Finally, he entrusted the newly planted rice field to the couple of Lao Li\u2019s family at the entrance of the village, and left a letter asking Lao Li to hand it over to her nanny.Seeing Wei Ruo\u2019s packed luggage, the two nuns showed ugly expressions, especially those dark and broken jars.If he really grew up in the countryside, he has only so much experience, and a few broken jars are considered good things.I wanted to persuade Wei Ruo not to bring it. It would be useless to bring such things to the Captain\u2019s Mansion, but then I thought that Wei Ruo had no knowledge, and they might not understand what they said, and it would not be good to waste their words. Why not Don\u2019t say anything, let her go.So under the arrangement of the two nuns, Wei Ruo\u2019s luggage was loaded into the carriage, and Wei Ruo and Xiumei got into the carriage and set off for Xiaowei\u2019s Mansion.This trip took three days. Three days later, Wei Ruo walked from the small mountain village of Huaibei Town, where he had lived for ten years, to Xingshan County, Taizhou Prefecture.Wei Ruo\u2019s biological father, Wei Mingting, served as a school lieutenant here.The ancestors of the Wei family had military generals and were granted the title of Uncle Loyalty, but it was passed down to the generation of Grandpa Wei Ruo.The Wei family had three sons in Wei Ruo\u2019s father\u2019s generation.The eldest son, Wei Minghong, only passed the examination of the scholar, but has not yet passed the exam, so he found a job in Beijing from the eighth rank;The second son Wei Mingyong is white, and now he only helps manage the family property, but he has been in a state of continuous losses in recent years.Wei Ruo\u2019s father, Wei Mingting, was the third son. He joined the martial arts in his early years, and now he is the most accomplished of the three brothers.Wei Ruo was led by two nuns to enter through the side door, passed through the hanging flower door, walked in along the corridor, and finally came to the yard where Wei Ruo\u2019s mother Yun lived.As soon as Wei Ruo stepped over the threshold of the main house, Yun hurried up and hugged Wei Ruo.Wei Ruo\u2019s body froze, and his limbs were as motionless as if they had been poured with lead.Yun didn\u2019t speak, but touched Wei Ruo\u2019s face while crying, his eyes were red.Feeling that the neck was soaked in warm liquid, Wei Ruo was slightly taken aback.Is she crying?Even though he was mentally prepared, when he felt Yun\u2019s real tears, Wei Ruo still felt an unexpected throbbing in his heart.Maybe it was affected by the memory of the original owner, or he remembered his mother who died tragically in the previous life.\u201cMother, don\u2019t be sad, isn\u2019t it a good thing for my sister to come back? We should be happy.\u201dThe eldest son Wei Yichen came forward to appease Yun and prevent her from being too sad.It has been ten days since she learned that the child was wronged, and the mother shed more than a few tears.Their mother seldom shed tears on weekdays, but this time, she cried and cried.Under the eldest son\u2019s persuasion, Yun\u2019s slowed down.Looked at Wei Ruo carefully again, seeing that she was wearing burlap clothes and her figure was slender, Yun said distressedly: \u201cYou have suffered all these years! Mother will make it up to you!\u201dAt this moment, Wei Qingwan came up and knelt down facing Wei Ruo.Without waiting for everyone to react, they kowtowed.Seeing this, Yun hurried over to help her up.\u201cWanwan, what are you doing?\u201d\u201cMother, don\u2019t stop me, this is what I owe my sister. I know that no matter how long I kneel, I can\u2019t offset the fact that I have taken advantage of my sister\u2019s blessings these years, but at least\u2026 I should do something\u2026\u201dWei Qingwan had tears in her eyes, and her words were sincere.Seeing her like this, Yun\u2019s heart ached too.What\u2019s wrong with a childish child? Both children are innocent! The fault is fate, otherwise they should be the parents!Wei Yichen also showed a sad expression, but withdrew the hand that was stretched out to help Wei Qingwan.Wei Ruo looked at Wei Qingwan who was kneeling in front of her, and recognized that she was the delicate heroine in the original book based on her behavior and dialogue.The book depicts her delicate body, shy and coquettish, tender like water, and men can\u2019t help but feel pity when they read it.Wei Ruo remembered the scene of Wei Qingwan kneeling down when the original owner entered the house for the first time in the original book, but the original owner was not so calm, and angrily accused Wei Qingwan of taking over her identity and her parents and family.Then Wei Qingwan cried even more unbearably. After being scolded, she still endured the grievance and said that it was what she deserved. This made Yun, who originally felt sorry for her biological daughter who had just been brought back, feel sorry for Wei Qingwan who was accused of being insulted.(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 4": "Chapter 4 - family memberPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 4 Family MembersIn fact, Wei Ruo felt that although the original owner was a bit reckless, she was not wrong. The ten years she was thrown in the countryside by the He family were very hard. She had no money, no food, no warm clothes, no one to educate her, and no relatives to accompany her. That kind of pain and that kind of resentment are incomprehensible to others.Let her see that someone has replaced her and live so well, isn\u2019t it understandable for her to be angry?But Wei Ruo\u2019s current thinking is that as long as the heroine doesn\u2019t take the initiative to provoke her later, she won\u2019t take the initiative to trouble the heroine.One of the living standards of a cannon fodder female supporting role: do not compete with the female lead for the male lead, and do not compete with the female lead for favor.So Wei Ruo said to Wei Qingwan who was kneeling on the ground: \u201cDon\u2019t kneel to me, I\u2019m not a Bodhisattva in the temple, I don\u2019t need others to kneel! It\u2019s no good for me if you kneel, and it\u2019s no good for you, and I can\u2019t make it happen for you.\u201d Wish, when we hold temple fairs in the countryside, everyone rushes to kneel to the Bodhisattva and make a wish!\u201d\u201cBut I owe my sister something. Although doing this can\u2019t change the past, at least it can make me feel less guilty.\u201d\u201cIf you feel that you owe me something, then you should pay me back. You shouldn\u2019t be thinking about how to make yourself feel less guilty, shouldn\u2019t that be the case?\u201d Wei Ruo asked back.Hearing this, Wei Qingwan was startled.Yunshi and Wei Yichen were also shocked, it is true that what Qingwan did would not help Wei Ruo.Although both Yun and Wei Yichen think that Qingwan doesn\u2019t need to blame herself, from Wei Ruo\u2019s point of view, Qingwan\u2019s actions really bother her.After thinking for a moment, Wei Qingwan asked Wei Ruo: \u201cThen what does my sister want me to do to make up for it? As long as my sister asks, I am willing to do it.\u201dWei Ruo said: \u201cFirst of all, you get up first. If you are so kneeling and don\u2019t know it, you think I\u2019m bullying you.\u201dWei Ruo puts the relationship aside first. Kneeling is what Wei Qingwan did on her own. Don\u2019t Wei Qingwan be wronged at that time. The blame will still be on her head, and she will lose her money!Wei Yichen stepped forward to help Wei Qingwan up.Wei Qingwan got up slowly, raised her head softly, looked at Wei Ruo, and asked softly, \u201cDoes sister have any orders?\u201dWei Ruo: \u201cDon\u2019t worry, there will be a long time to come. I just came here, and I don\u2019t know anything yet. You called me at the beginning, and I don\u2019t even know who you are and what you owe me.\u201dHearing this, Wei Qingwan was stunned again.\u201cYes, yes, take your time.\u201d Yun wiped away her tears, adjusted her emotions, and said to Wei Ruo, \u201cRuo\u2019er, let me introduce you to your brothers and sisters first.\u201d\u201cYour father is not here today, and he really wants to see you, but now that Japanese pirates are rampant and making trouble outside the city from time to time, your father really can\u2019t leave.\u201dLinhai, Xingshan County, has been invaded by Japanese pirates recently. As the military officer here, Wei Mingting is very busy.This matter is nothing more than other matters. It is related to the safety of the people in the city. Wei Mingting should lead by example and leave his family for everyone. Even if his biological daughter arrives home for the first time, he cannot ask for leave.Then Yun introduced: \u201cThis is your elder brother Wei Yichen. He lived three times at home in the capital, and now you call him elder brother here.\u201dThe man next to him, who is as gentle as jade and with gentle eyes, smiled at Wei Ruo: \u201cSister, tell me anything in the future.\u201dWei Ruo nodded.Then Yun turned to the boy sitting on the chair next to him: \u201cThis is your younger brother, named Yilin, he is seven years old this year. He is the youngest in the Beijing family, at the age of eight.\u201dWei Yilin, who was named, flattened his mouth, with a cold face, and he didn\u2019t really want to say hello to Wei Ruo.It wasn\u2019t until Yun gave him a stern look that he reluctantly called Wei Ruo: \u201cSister.\u201dAfter yelling, she turned her head away immediately and stopped looking at Wei Ruo.Yun continued: \u201cIn addition, you have a concubine elder brother, Jin Yi, who doesn\u2019t come out very often, but is now in your yard.\u201dYun didn\u2019t really want to mention this concubine, Yun and her husband Wei Mingting had always had a good relationship, and the husband had never had a concubine for many years, but this concubine alone was a thorn in Yun\u2019s heart.Immediately afterwards, Yun looked at Wei Qingwan again.At this time, Yun hesitated for a moment. If she ignored Qingwan and did not make a formal introduction, then Qingwan would definitely feel sad. She said that even if she was not her own, she was also the daughter of their Wei family. Is there any reason not to introduce it?But if it was introduced, tell Wei Ruo that Qingwan will continue to stay at Wei\u2019s house in the future, she is afraid that Wei Ruo, who just arrived home, will feel uncomfortable.After hesitating for a long time, Yun still chose to say to Wei Ruo: \u201cShe is Qingwan, that is\u2026 she switched identities with you\u2026 Mama Zhang and Mama Li have already told you about your affairs. After discussing it, you will stay by my side in the future, and you will all be young ladies of my Wei family.\u201dSpeaking of this, Yun looked at Wei Ruo worriedly.\u201cYeah.\u201d Wei Ruo agreed, but his reaction was a little dull.I don\u2019t know if it was too dull, but it made everyone feel strange.Wei Yichen immediately said: \u201cMother, my sister has been driving for three days, and the boat and car are exhausting, so I should let my sister rest first.\u201d\u201cYes, yes, let\u2019s take her to the room to rest first.\u201d Yun said hurriedly.As he spoke, he took Wei Ruo\u2019s hand and led her to her yard.Xiaowei\u2019s mansion is not big, with a total of six courtyards in the backyard.Usually the five courtyards are occupied by people, leaving only the most remote and narrowest courtyard vacant.Wei Yichen offered to give up his yard to Wei Ruo, and because he likes to study quietly, the remote yard is suitable for him.So Wei Ruo is now being taken to live in the courtyard that originally belonged to Wei Yichen.On the plaque at the gate of the courtyard, there are three vigorous characters \u201cTingsongyuan\u201d, which are named by Wei Yichen, and the plaque has not been changed in the future.The courtyard is bright and spacious, and the layout of the garden still retains Wei Yichen\u2019s preferences, with pines and cypresses intertwined, fresh and elegant.Yun Shi led Wei Ruo into the room. Although the time was short, the room was arranged according to the girl\u2019s preferences.There are also a lot of brand new clothes in the closet.Wei Ruo and Wei Qingwan are about the same size now. They are thirteen years old and have not grown up yet, so they took some and gave them to Wei Ruo first.Mr. Yun gave Wei Ruo a few more words, and then walked out of the room and asked Wei Ruo to rest first, and come to pick her up after dinner.After Mrs. Yun left, Xiumei moved Wei Ruo\u2019s personal belongings into the room, and the servants of the family had already moved all the other things into Tingsongyuan, and they will be cleaned up one by one tomorrow.Looking at the furnishings in the room, I couldn\u2019t help feeling: \u201cIf Miss is not wronged, she has lived in such an environment since she was a child.\u201dComparing Xiaowei\u2019s Mansion with the He family\u2019s other courtyard in the countryside, the difference is simply worlds apart.Comparing the attitudes of He\u2019s parents and Yun\u2019s towards Wei Ruo, Xiumei couldn\u2019t help feeling sorry for Wei Ruo.Without the presence of outsiders, Wei Ruo immediately stepped on the bed and lay down, sleeping on all fours, without any image.Dignity and beauty are on the outside, but Wei Ruo likes to be more free and undisciplined at home.(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Madam and your brother are very good to you. Otherwise, don\u2019t even think about leaving. You have multiple backers.\u201d Take it easy from now on.\u201d\u201cHey, they are good to me, as long as there is no conflict with the protagonist.\u201d\u201cProtagonist? Who is the lady talking about?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t say anyone, I was talking nonsense. Meizi tidy up the things, and keep those eye-catching ones away.\u201d Wei Ruo ordered.\u201cOkay, miss, you should take a rest first.\u201d Xiumei said.Wei Ruo also felt that he should sleep to recharge his energy, otherwise he would not have the energy to cope at night.Just as she was about to fall asleep, Nanny Li, one of the two nuns who went to pick Wei Ruo back from Huaibei Town, came.Xiumei wanted to dissuade her, but Nanny Li ignored her and walked straight into Wei Ruo\u2019s bedroom.\u201cWhy did Miss fall asleep at noon?\u201dNanny stood in front of Wei Ruo\u2019s bed with a stern expression.Wei Ruo got up and stretched: \u201cIs Mammy okay?\u201d\u201cThe madam sent me to teach the young lady to be familiar with the affairs of the mansion, and also asked the young lady to pack up and follow the old slave to the courtyard.\u201dAfter finishing speaking, Nanny Li turned around and walked to the yard to wait for Wei Ruo, acting quickly without giving Wei Ruo a chance to think and refuse.\u201cMiss\u2026\u201d Xiumei frowned, \u201cMa\u2019am, why\u2026you just got home, why don\u2019t you let you take a rest.\u201dShe just praised Madam for being kind to their young lady, so why did she immediately slap her in the face.\u201cIt should be my mother\u2019s instruction to ask Nanny to teach me the rules, but it may not be my mother\u2019s idea to teach me right now. Nanny Li has her own selfish motives in doing so.\u201dNurse Li is a nanny who came out of Uncle Zhongyi\u2019s mansion. In terms of status, she is higher than the general servants in the mansion.Because of this relationship, she considered herself to have a higher status than the ordinary servants in the family. At the same time, she has more rules, and she has already shown dissatisfaction with Wei Ruo\u2019s lazy habits on the road.At the same time, Nanny Li is the nanny who takes care of Wei Qingwan growing up, and Nanny Li\u2019s daughter Cui He is still the big maid beside Wei Qingwan.And Wei Ruo, who has read the original work, knows it well.\u201cWhat is the lady going to do?\u201d Xiumei asked worriedly.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, I know what she wants.\u201d Wei Ruo got up and came to the yard.When he came to the courtyard, Nanny Li gave some guidance to Wei Ruo on his demeanor.\u201cMiss Ruo\u2019er, now that you have arrived at the Colonel\u2019s Mansion, you are not as good as before. You must pay special attention to every word and deed, and you can\u2019t be so casual anymore. Otherwise, you will make a joke, and you will not only lose it.\u201d It\u2019s not just your own face, but also those from the Colonel\u2019s Mansion and the Zhongyi Bo\u2019s Mansion in the capital, you know?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not used to it.\u201d Wei Ruo retorted directly.\u201cMiss Ruoer, what do you mean by that?\u201d Nanny Li\u2019s expression immediately became serious.\u201cAren\u2019t I the lady of the Captain\u2019s Mansion? Why should I care what others think of me?\u201d Wei Ruo spoke arrogantly, defiantly.\u201cMiss Ruo\u2019er, don\u2019t say this outside, otherwise you will be laughed at!\u201d\u201cThe joke is a joke, what else can they do with me? Isn\u2019t my grandfather Zhongyi? Isn\u2019t he very powerful? Then why am I afraid of them?\u201dNanny Li\u2019s eyes became dark and unclear, and she said slowly: \u201cNo matter what, from now on, the eldest lady will learn the rules from me, and the rules I told you must be firmly remembered, learn all the words that can be learned, and try to be as good as possible.\u201d Everyone looks like a lady.\u201d\u201cGot it.\u201d Wei Ruo looked very impatient.\u201cThen let me introduce some basic rules to you today, so that the lady won\u2019t be rude when she sees the master at night, and I will teach you the rest slowly.\u201dNurse Li babbled on to Wei Ruoxu for a long time, but Wei Ruodong looked around, not paying attention at all.\u201cOkay, it seems that Miss Ruo\u2019er is not interested in continuing to study now, so let\u2019s stop here first.\u201dNanny Li finished teaching Wei Ruo, and told Xiumei to take good care of Wei Ruo and not let Wei Ruo run around, and then left Tingsongyuan.After Nanny Li left, Xiumei asked Wei Ruo puzzledly: \u201cMiss, why didn\u2019t Nanny Li teach you much after you deliberately pretended to be unruly and ignorant?\u201d\u201cBecause she doesn\u2019t want me to be outstanding! On her trip today, she first challenged me, then tested me, and finally taught me. Teaching me is not her main task.\u201d Wei Ruo said with a light smile.In the original book, Nanny Li also taught Wei Ruo to follow the rules, but she never really taught it with her heart. The original owner behaved poorly, and Nanny Li never punished her.On the surface, it seems to be tolerant towards the original owner, but in fact, deep down, he doesn\u2019t want the original owner to really become outstanding and outstanding, taking Wei Qingwan\u2019s light away.Anyway, she did it according to the procedure and said everything that should be said. It was Wei Ruo\u2019s fault that Wei Ruo didn\u2019t learn well, not her senior nanny\u2019s fault. , It is not good to teach at all.wasting half an hour with Nanny Li, Wei Ruo went back to the house to take a nap, and it was already evening when she woke up again, and Mrs. Yun personally came to pick Wei Ruo to the dining hall.Along the way, Mrs. Yun held Wei Ruo\u2019s hand, earnestly asking if Wei Ruo was used to it, and if there was anything dissatisfied with the room.Entering the dining room, Wei Ruo saw Wei Mingting, whom he hadn\u2019t seen during the day, with a tall and tall figure, three-dimensional features, and deep brows. Just like the original description, he was a very dignified father.Seeing Wei Ruo, Wei Mingting\u2019s expression moved, he subconsciously took two steps forward, and soon stopped.It seems that he feels that his performance is too excited and not suitable for the head of the family.\u201cRuo\u2019er, this is your father.\u201d Yun led Wei Ruo to Wei Mingting.\u201cFather.\u201d Wei Ruo said.\u201cEn.\u201d Wei Mingting responded with a low voice, as if he was suppressing some kind of emotion.His gaze stayed on Wei Ruo for a long time, Wei Ruo thought he was going to say something to himself, but no, his reaction was much colder than Yun\u2019s.\u201cTake a seat.\u201d Wei Mingting let everyone take their seats.This place is not in the capital, and now there is only their room, so many rules have been removed, there is no need to separate tables for men and women, everyone is at the table.Yun Shi pulled Wei Ruo and asked her to sit next to him.When everyone sat down, they found that Wei Qingwan was standing next to him.Wei Mingting and Yun were both taken aback, and the atmosphere was a bit awkward.At this time, Wei Yilin jumped off the chair, ran to Wei Qingwan, and pulled her to the table: \u201cSister, let\u2019s eat!\u201d\u201cYilin, I\u2026 I still won\u2019t serve the table\u2026\u201d Wei Qingwan replied in a low voice.\u201cWhy not? You are my sister! We are a family!\u201d Wei Yilin said domineeringly.(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Everyone looked at Wei Ruo several times, and worried that she would be out of order after thirteen years in the merchant\u2019s house.Unexpectedly, she ate in a slow and orderly manner, which fully met the standards of a lady.After dinner, everyone sat down to drink tea together, and at the same time, they had to discuss a more urgent matter.Seeing that the atmosphere was good, Wei Mingting opened his mouth and said to Wei Ruo: \u201cRuo\u2019er, you have worked hard all these years, your grandfather and two uncles who are far away in the capital already know about the matter of having the wrong child, and your name will be publicized soon.\u201d Add to the family tree.\u201dYesterday Wei Mingting had already received a letter from Beijing, and he was going to reply to the letter in two days, so he had to tell Wei Ruo right now.\u201cYes.\u201d Wei Ruo agreed, without revealing everyone\u2019s expected expectation and joy.Wei Mingting looked at Wei Ruo with a slight frown, thought for a moment, and said, \u201cWe have decided to add your name after Qing Wan, so you will be the second young lady of the Wei family, okay?\u201dHearing this, Wei Ruo raised his head and met Wei Mingting\u2019s eyes.Those eyes were clear and bright, neither sad nor happy.As a general, Wei Mingting has always been majestic, even at home, he is more powerful than ordinary people.The children in the family were a little afraid of him when they were young. Even Wei Qingwan, who was deeply favored before, did not dare to look Wei Mingting directly in the eyes when his expression was serious.Before Wei Ruo spoke, Wei Qingwan suddenly stood up and knelt down in front of Wei Mingting and Yun Shi:\u201cFather, mother, my daughter begs Ruoer to be the eldest daughter!\u201d\u201cWanwan, what are you doing?\u201d Yun\u2019s eyes were full of distress.\u201cFather, mother, I am very satisfied to be able to grow up in Wei\u2019s family these years, to be the daughter of my parents, to be happy, and to meet my parents. I am willing to keep me by your side. I am already very satisfied, and I dare not occupy this place anymore.\u201d The identity of the eldest daughter, not to mention the second young lady, even if it is a slave or a handmaid, I would love it.\u201dWei Mingting and Yun\u2019s brows were furrowed, eyes full of distress and embarrassment.Wei Qingwan kowtowed again: \u201cPlease ask your parents to help you.\u201dThis knock was very loud, and the sound of dong was very crisp.Yun Shi hurried forward to stop Wei Qingwan from hurting herself further: \u201cWanwan, stop knocking, your parents know what you want.\u201d\u201cDad and mother love so much, my daughter deserves it\u2026\u201d\u201cFool, what are you talking about! You are not allowed to say such worthy words again. You are our daughter and we are a family. This will never change.\u201dYun Shi hugged Wei Qingwan in her arms, feeling very distressed.Wei Yilin also jumped down from his seat, ran up, and embraced Wei Qingwan and Yunshi.\u201cSister, you will always be my sister, you are not allowed to say that kind of words!\u201d Wei Yilin pursed his mouth and red eyes.Seeing this scene, Wei Mingting\u2019s face was tense, and his face was clouded.Wei Yichen was also touched by this scene, but he didn\u2019t step forward to express his opinion, but looked in Wei Ruo\u2019s direction twice, worried that Wei Ruo would feel uncomfortable seeing this scene.After a while, Yun let go of Wei Qingwan, and let the two children go back to their seats and sit down.Wei Qingwan stood up with Wei Yilin\u2019s support. She didn\u2019t know whether she had knelt for a long time or was weak. Her body swayed and she almost fell back again. Fortunately, Wei Yilin supported her.Afterwards, Yun Shi also returned to Wei Mingting\u2019s side.After several people sat down, Wei Mingting and Yun\u2019s eyes fell back on Wei Ruo.Wei Ruo had a slight smile on his lips, and his crisp voice broke the silence in the hall.She asked Wei Mingting: \u201cIs it because my parents made such a decision because I was born later?\u201d\u201cNo\u2026\u201d When Wei Mingting replied, his voice was a little weak.According to the time when the two wives gave birth, Mrs. Wei should be a little earlier than Mrs. He\u2019s family.Then, as Mrs. Wei\u2019s biological daughter, Wei Ruo should have been born a little earlier than Wei Qingwan.\u201cWhy is that?\u201d Wei Ruo continued to ask, staring at Wei Mingting with a pair of clear and bright eyes.Not knowing whether it was because those eyes were too clear or for some other reason, Wei Mingting was silent.Yun hurriedly helped her husband explain: \u201cThat\u2019s right, Wanwan has already entered the genealogy. To avoid trouble, I will directly fill in your name behind, and there is no need to make other changes.\u201dWei Yilin interjected: \u201cMy sister is the eldest sister, the eldest daughter in the family. Of course you can\u2019t steal the status of the eldest daughter from my sister!\u201dThe first and second house of the Wei family have no daughters. Before Wei Ruo came, Wei Qingwan was the only girl in the family, the eldest daughter.Although she is not the eldest son and eldest daughter, she has more or less a long character. In the capital city, where the lintel of family background is very important, this long word still holds some weight.\u201cYilin! What nonsense are you talking about!\u201d Mrs. Yun snapped, preventing her youngest son from continuing to talk nonsense.Being reprimanded, Wei Yilin pursed his lips, aggrieved and stubborn.Mr. Yun turned her head and explained to Wei Ruo: \u201cIt\u2019s not about the status of the eldest daughter and the second daughter. It\u2019s just that everyone is used to calling it that way, whether it\u2019s at home here or in the capital. I\u2019m afraid everyone won\u2019t get used to it if I change it temporarily.\u201d\u201cIs this the only reason?\u201d Wei Ruo asked again.Wei Mingting said with a serious expression: \u201cI discussed this matter with your mother and made a decision after weighing various parties.\u201dEveryone looked at Wei Ruo, waiting for her answer.Just when everyone thought that Wei Ruo would continue to say something to fight for the position of eldest daughter for himself, Wei Ruo gave everyone an unexpected answer.\u201cOkay, then I will be the second lady.\u201dHearing this, everyone looked at Wei Ruo in surprise.Wei Ruo\u2019s questioning just now made people feel that she was very dissatisfied with asking her to make a small arrangement, but now she agreed directly after changing her style of painting?\u201cRuo\u2019er, you really don\u2019t mind?\u201d Yun asked hurriedly.\u201cHowever convenient, it\u2019s troublesome for everyone to change. My father is also very busy these days, so he shouldn\u2019t bother with these trivial matters. Or, if I mind, father and mother will change their minds. Intend?\u201dWei Ruo asked back, with a faint smile on the corner of his mouth, and a sly look in his eyes.(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

There is nothing I can do about it. If I missed the thirteen years with my parents, I missed it. Now I can only blame fate for tricking people.\u201d Wei Wei Ruo said briskly, as if he really understood the Wei family.Everyone in the hall fell silent, especially Wei Mingting and Yun Shi, who originally felt sorry for Wei Qingwan, but at this moment they felt that the child\u2019s non-competitive behavior made people feel distressed.Yun\u2019s moved and said to Wei Ruo: \u201cRuo\u2019er, you are the child of your parents. We are connected by blood. Now that you are back, no matter whether you are the eldest daughter or the second daughter, your weight in our hearts is very important. Parents will make up for the missing relationship of thirteen years.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Wei Ruo agreed happily, but had other plans in mind.Wei Mingting said in a deep voice: \u201cThat\u2019s the matter. From now on, you brothers and sisters will get along well. Yichen and Wanwan. Ruo\u2019er doesn\u2019t understand a lot of things when she just came back. Take her with you.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, father.\u201d Wei Yichen replied.\u201cMy daughter knows.\u201d Wei Qingwan lowered her head and agreed softly.The matter came to an end, and Wei Mingting was going to write back to the capital after returning to the study in a while, explaining the situation to them.After drinking tea and talking about things, Wei Ruo was sent back to Tingsongyuan by Yun himself.I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because Wei Ruo accepted the identity of the second young lady, which made Yun feel a little guilty. She told Wei Ruo along the way that she wanted to buy things for Wei Ruo, and arranged everything from clothes and hair to maids and mothers.The Wei Mansion is actually not rich, the little family property left by the ancestors has already been paid out, and Wei Mingting does not have much salary as a school captain, but Wei Qingwan already has some things, and the Yun family is not good at this kind of situation. The place favors one more than another.Wei Ruo, who gave money and things, agreed, and would not refuse anyone, but Wei Ruo, who arranged the manpower, declined, saying that he had Xiumei as a maid for the time being, and he didn\u2019t like other people coming in and out of his room.Yun obeyed her wishes and didn\u2019t force this kind of thing. He only said that when Wei Ruo wanted to tell her, she would make arrangements.Going back to Tingsongyuan, entered the room, and closed the door. Wei Ruo, who was dignified and aloof one second before, broke his skills the next second.This tea is too hard to drink! With this skill, a crop of wheat has been harvested!For some reason, Wei Ruo feels that when working hard to make money, although he is tired, he is exhausted to the fullest, and the tiredness of dealing with this kind of occasion is the kind of stuffy tiredness, like a lot of turbidity accumulated in the chest. .Actually, Wei Ruo, who knows the plot of the original book, already knew what Wei Mingting and Yun Shi were going to tell him today.The original owner got into a quarrel with Wei Mingting over this matter. The original owner felt that it belonged to her. Wei Qingwan had already occupied her status and affection for thirteen years, so why did she continue to occupy the identity of her eldest daughter?In the end, the original owner succeeded and became the eldest daughter, but everyone felt sorry for Wei Qingwan, who had been wronged in this incident, and had a grudge against the original owner.Actually, the original owner made such a fuss and wanted the status of the eldest daughter so much, but why did he only want the position of the eldest daughter?What she wants is actually the attention and love from her biological parents.It\u2019s just that the way she expresses it is a little clumsy.The previous experience made Wei Ruo feel that it is better to rely on his own efforts to strive for his own status than to expect others to give him his status.Don\u2019t place bets on others, don\u2019t have high expectations of others, especially those who don\u2019t care much about themselves, will make their lives happier.He even said that if given the opportunity, Wei Ruo wanted to break away from the Wei family and set up his own family.As for today\u2019s eldest daughter and second daughter, Wei Mingting and Yun may not be able to make the decision. The person who can really make a final decision is the old uncle in the capital.The old uncle in the original book is a person who attaches great importance to family heirs. After learning that Wei Qingwan is not from the blood of the Wei family, he treats her very coldly. He may not agree to let Wei Qingwan, who has no blood relationship with him, be the eldest granddaughter.So instead of her arguing with Wei Mingting Yun\u2019s family here, it is better to throw the problem to the old man and let Wei Mingting and his wife compete with the old man.###In the next three days, Wei Ruo lived fairly peacefully, and got a general understanding of the general situation in the mansion.The economic situation of the Wei family is not very good. The family property of the Zhongyibo Mansion has been squandered for a long time, and now it is just supporting the facade.In Xingshan County, her father, Wei Mingting, is still only a sixth-rank school lieutenant, with a limited salary, and he has to support this big family.I heard that the emperor was very dissatisfied with the officials in Taizhou Prefecture because the anti-Japanese affairs were not going well.Of course, the skinny camel is bigger than a horse, and is much stronger than her adoptive parents, the He family.Mr. Yun would visit Wei Ruo every day and bring her some things for food and clothing.Wei Mingting was very busy and didn\u2019t go home for a few days. Not to mention Wei Ruo couldn\u2019t see him anymore, even the Yun family couldn\u2019t see him.Big Brother Wei Yichen is busy with his studies, so he doesn\u2019t come often, but every time he comes, he always brings Wei Ruo local special snacks from Xingshan County, and tells Wei Ruo the customs of Xingshan County.Wei Yilin has never been here before, but once passed by Wei Ruo\u2019s door, he and Wei Ruo looked at each other from a distance, and after just one glance, he turned his head arrogantly and walked away quickly.Wei Qingwan came several times, and each time brought something to her, but every time she came, she looked like she was about to cry, so Wei Ruo urged her to go back.For the rest of the time, the one Wei Ruo saw the most was Nanny Li who was ordered to teach him how to behave.But she didn\u2019t really teach, and she didn\u2019t care if Wei Ruo acted lazy, and just let it go.On the fourth day, Wei Ruo got a free day and didn\u2019t have to learn the rules from Nanny Li.Wei Ruo asked Xiumei to find a **** for herself after having breakfast in her room.She spotted an open space on the west side of the yard and planned to use it to grow vegetables.No way, her space requires her to plant to gain experience. If it is only planted in the land in the space, it will be too slow to upgrade experience.After she left Mojiazha, she didn\u2019t know if the field she planted there would be considered her planting if it was ripe and harvested, and whether it would have experience points.No matter what, the experience value is not too much, and the ones that should be planted should be planted.I heard that the pine garden is quite big, and she didn\u2019t destroy it all. She only planted a little on the corner on the west side, which should have little impact on the overall aesthetics.Wei Ruo flipped the floor over and over again, with a powerful and rhythmic voice.After a while, a piece of land two meters square was reclaimed by Wei Ruo.Then, together with Xiumei, they split a pile of bamboo and built a shelf next to the wall, where they planned to plant loofahs, pumpkins and gourds.Wei Ruo stopped to rest, sat on the stone bench in the courtyard and drank some water.A young man knocked on the door, and Xiumei went to answer it.Wei Ruo stopped and heard the young servant talking to Xiumei, saying that the sound of chopping bamboo on her side disturbed the second young master next door who was studying, and hoped that they would keep their voices down.(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Although to a certain extent, it was to avoid embarrassing his wife Yun, it was also a manifestation of his love for Wei Jinyi.After Wei Mingting\u2019s death in battle, the Wei family fell to the bottom, until the male protagonist appeared. It is estimated that Wei Jinyi\u2019s life will not be easy during this time.In the original book, there is no scene between Wei Ruo and Wei Jinyi. One of them is the little transparency in the family, and the other is the cannon fodder female supporting role who jumps up and down. Interactions between key supporting characters.Thinking of this, Wei Ruo had some thoughts in his mind, got up and went back to the room, taking advantage of Xiumei\u2019s time communicating with the servant, he went back to the room and carried a jar she brought from Mojiazha.Then he came to the door and said to Wei Jinyi\u2019s boy: \u201cI\u2019m really sorry for disturbing the second brother\u2019s rest just now, I\u2019ll go over and apologize to him now.\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d The servant looked at Wei Ruo in surprise, then waved his hands and said, \u201cThat\u2019s not necessary, it\u2019s not that serious, the second young master just asked me to remind you, miss, just keep your voice down!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not just an apology. I just returned home and haven\u2019t seen my second brother yet. As a younger sister, I should pay a visit.\u201dWei Ruo has made up his mind.He walked out the door with the jar in his arms, but the boy couldn\u2019t stop him even if he wanted to.The Tingsong Garden where Wei Ruo lives now is next to the Yingzhu Garden where Wei Jinyi lives, separated only by a wall.Wei Ruo went out of the gate and walked two steps to the gate of Yingzhu Garden.Tingsong Garden is fresh and elegant, while Yingzhu Garden is even duller than Tingsong Garden. There are few decorations, and it looks deserted and even a bit shabby.Only the piece of light bamboo in the yard is lush and beautiful.There is an octagonal pavilion next to the bamboo forest, and Wei Ruo immediately saw Wei Jinyi sitting in the pavilion reading a book.Dressed in plain clothes, the fabric used is not satin. Before Wei Ruo came in, he was still quietly reading a book.He raised his head when he heard the movement, and met Wei Ruo\u2019s eyes.Those were too cold eyes, the brows were foggy, and the skin was a little fairer for a man.But the facial features are extremely beautiful, and every part is like a carefully crafted work of art.Wei Ruo couldn\u2019t help feeling in his heart that the Creator is so powerful that he can make a man so beautiful.Wei Jin also frowned after seeing the person coming, showing strong rejection.\u201cXiaobei.\u201d Wei Jin also called the boy over.\u201cSecond Young Master, Miss said she wanted to come to apologize to you, but I\u2026 I didn\u2019t stop\u2026\u201d Xiao Bei apologized.Wei Ruo took the lead and quickly stated his intentions: \u201cDon\u2019t be annoyed, I won\u2019t disturb you for too long, so I\u2019ll just express my apologies. The sound of splitting bamboo is indeed a bit loud today. I didn\u2019t think carefully enough, so I came here to apologize to you.\u201dAs he spoke, he offered the jar he carried as an apology gift.Wei Ruo\u2019s operation made the master and servant in front of him a little confused.The second son is a concubine, his biological mother is unknown, and the mistress doesn\u2019t like it. He has almost no sense of presence in this mansion, and even the servants have to wear small shoes for him when they have the opportunity.Although Wei Ruo has just been picked up, but she is a serious daughter-in-law, why is she so polite to the second son? Could it be that you haven\u2019t figured out the situation yet?\u201cI\u2019m not angry with you, and I don\u2019t drink, you go back.\u201d Wei Jin also only glanced at Wei Ruo, and that cold gaze returned to the desk in front of him.\u201cIt\u2019s not wine.\u201d\u201cYou take it back no matter what it is. I\u2019m not angry. I just asked Xiaobei to remind you that you don\u2019t need to prepare a special apology ceremony.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s soy sauce, not something expensive. If you don\u2019t need my apology, just treat it as a gift from me.\u201dwhat? soy sauce?Seeing Wei Jinyi\u2019s suspicious expression, Wei Ruo explained, \u201cThis is brewing soy sauce that I learned from a mother-in-law when I was in the country. , it is useful for strengthening the body.\u201dBrewed soy sauce learned from the country mother-in-law? Also has the function of nourishing the body?Why does it sound so mysterious?Good brewing methods of soy sauce are secret methods that are not handed down from family members, and will not be easily passed on to others.And those with additional medicinal value are things that few people know about, and most people have never even heard of them.Wei Jin didn\u2019t want to get entangled with Wei Ruoduo, so he stopped asking.\u201cI see, I accept the apology gift, you can go back.\u201dWei Jin also just wanted to send Wei Ruo away quickly, so he asked Xiaobei to take over the dark jar from Wei Ruo\u2019s hand.\u201cWell, good, remember to use this soy sauce, it\u2019s also delicious when dipped in seafood.\u201dThe capital of Taizhou is near the sea. Before the Japanese pirates made trouble, many fishermen went out to sea to fish. The wharf sold a lot of fresh seafood, and the nearby residents couldn\u2019t live without seafood.After finishing speaking, Wei Ruo didn\u2019t stay any longer to make people feel suspicious, so he turned around and left.Xiaobei was at a loss holding the jar: \u201cMaster, what should I do with this jar?\u201d\u201cPut it anywhere.\u201d Wei Jin also didn\u2019t want to waste time on such meaningless things.Seeing that his young master\u2019s attention was already on the book in his hand, Xiaobei could only find a way to deal with it by himself.Finally, I chose to put it in the corner of the small kitchen in Yingzhuyuan.Xiao Bei felt that the act of giving soy sauce was very novel.Other people give gifts, they always give some elegant things, not flowers and spices, but also good wine, this lady is very unique, it is so rare to give someone a jar of soy sauce.But I heard that this lady has been in the country for a few years, farming and farming, and it is understandable that she is a little different from other ladies.(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 9": "Chapter 9 - she is a village womanPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 9 She is a village womanAfter learning about Wei Ruo\u2019s transformation of the yard, although Yun felt something was wrong, he didn\u2019t say anything.After all, my daughter grew up in the countryside, so it\u2019s normal for her to not get used to it for a while, and she will just have to teach it slowly in the future.But Wei Yilin was not very happy about this, and went to his elder brother Wei Yichen to complain.\u201cBrother, that Wei Ruo has messed up your yard! It\u2019s useless for you to give up the yard to him, and she has changed a good and elegant yard.\u201d\u201cWhat has she changed into?\u201d Wei Yichen was curious. He was busy with his studies these days, so he didn\u2019t know much about Wei Ruo\u2019s affairs.\u201cShe grows vegetables in your yard! It\u2019s so vulgar! How can a young lady do this! It\u2019s too shameful!\u201d Wei Yilin felt more and more uncomfortable thinking about it.\u201cGrowing vegetables? Although it\u2019s not very elegant, it\u2019s not a big deal, so don\u2019t feel ashamed.\u201d Wei Yichen smiled.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you be ashamed? I have heard people say that the one we invited back is a disgraceful village woman! She doesn\u2019t look like a lady at all!\u201dWei Yichen\u2019s expression became serious: \u201cWho is gossiping in private? How can a servant speak ill of the master behind his back? Yilin, if you encounter such a thing next time, you should stand up and scold them directly.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t! I don\u2019t speak for her! She is ashamed!\u201d Wei Yilin pursed his lips, not realizing that he was wrong, \u201cBrother, aren\u2019t you angry? She made a mess of your yard!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s her residence now. How she wants to change it is her business, and I shouldn\u2019t interfere. And you, Yilin, I understand that you like Wanwan, and you should protect Wanwan. Same, I feel sorry for Wanwan. But Ruoer is also your sister, she did nothing wrong, you shouldn\u2019t treat her like this.\u201d Wei Yichen taught.\u201cI don\u2019t want her to be my sister! Wanwan is enough for me! She made my sister secretly cry several times when she came! My sister took the initiative to find her and give her something, but she didn\u2019t even bother her. My sister let her go without saying a word, which made my sister very sad!\u201d\u201cYilin, this is the end of these words. From now on, I don\u2019t care what you think in your heart, but you must never say it again, whether it is in front of me, or in front of your parents, and the most important thing is that you must never say it in front of your big sister.\u201d Speak! If you don\u2019t listen again, I will take you to father to be punished.\u201dWei Yichen was so strict, no matter how reluctant Wei Yilin was, he could only flatten his mouth and agree.\u201cUnderstood\u2026 If you don\u2019t say it, don\u2019t say it.\u201dWei Yilin obediently stood next to Wei Yichen, reading the Analects of Confucius.Wei Yilin has a restless personality, and only when he is around Wei Yichen will he be more peaceful.After about a cup of tea, Wei Qingwan\u2019s personal maid, Cui He, came over with a small snack in her hand.\u201cEldest young master, third young master, Miss made some sweet-scented osmanthus cakes, and asked the servants to bring them to the two young masters, and also asked the servants to bring a message to the young master, so that the young master should pay attention to rest, and don\u2019t just focus on reading and tire your body.\u201dOn a white porcelain plate, there are milky white osmanthus cakes neatly placed, dotted with golden osmanthus flowers. It is osmanthus honey that Wei Qingwan made herself when the osmanthus flowers bloomed last year.Wei Yilin looked joyful: \u201cBig sister is so kind to us, there are delicious sweet-scented osmanthus cakes to eat!\u201dAs he spoke, Wei Yilin reached out and took a piece, put it in his mouth, with a satisfied face.\u201cWell, it smells so sweet~\u201dWei Yichen didn\u2019t move.\u201cBig brother, why don\u2019t you eat it? Don\u2019t you like the osmanthus cake made by big sister?\u201d\u201cYilin, take this plate of sweet-scented osmanthus cake to Tingsongyuan and give it to Ruoer.\u201d Wei Yichen ordered.\u201cWhy? Big sister made it herself!\u201d Wei Yilin\u2019s face collapsed again.\u201cRuo\u2019er has been back home for so many days, and you haven\u2019t gotten along well with her.\u201d Wei Yichen said seriously.\u201cBut why should the big sister give her what she made?\u201d And why should he get along with that peasant woman? Wei Yilin didn\u2019t dare to say the latter sentence in front of Wei Yichen again.\u201cIt is precisely because it was made by Wanwan that you should share it with Ruo\u2019er. While fulfilling your wishes, you can also fulfill Wanwan\u2019s wishes.\u201d Wei Yichen said.\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\u201cBe obedient.\u201d Wei Yichen\u2019s expression was extraordinarily serious.\u201cAll right.\u201dAlthough Wei Yilin was full of reluctance, he didn\u2019t dare not listen to Wei Yichen\u2019s words.So reluctantly, he took the sweet-scented osmanthus cake and went to Songyuan to listen to it.As soon as Wei Yilin entered the door of Tingsongyuan, he saw Wei Ruo climbed onto the ladder, and Wei Yilin\u2019s dissatisfaction with Wei Ruo immediately surged up again:\u201cHow did you climb so high? If you are seen like this, you will definitely be laughed at!\u201dWei Ruo heard the sound and looked down, and saw Wei Yilin standing beside the ladder, staring at him angrily.\u201cWhy is it indecent to climb a ladder?\u201d\u201cOf course it\u2019s indecent, no lady will jump up and down like you!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t look at it if you don\u2019t like it, turn right when you go out, and walk slowly.\u201d Wei Ruo is also very straightforward.This little kid doesn\u2019t like herself from head to toe, from the inside out, she doesn\u2019t need to waste time with this little kid.\u201cYou! You think I want to see you!\u201d Wei Yilin said angrily.\u201cThen why are you still here? Since you don\u2019t want to see it, why bother?\u201d Wei Ruo asked.Wei Yilin originally wanted to leave immediately, but if Wei Ruo drove him away, his rebellious psychology came up, and he refused to leave.\u201cThis is my home, I can come whenever I want, and leave whenever I want.\u201dNot only did Wei Yilin not leave, but he also sat down on the wicker chair that Wei Ruo placed in the yard.Wei Ruo saw that he would not be able to drive Wei Yilin away for a while, so he climbed down from the ladder and walked up to Wei Yilin.Wei Yilin stared at her unconvinced.\u201cwhatever.\u201dWei Ruo is too lazy to argue with Wei Yilin. Her core of an adult does not need to care about an eight-year-old child.\u201cWait a minute, I\u2019m here to deliver something to you.\u201dWei Yilin called to stop Wei Ruo who was about to enter the house.As he spoke, he opened the food box he brought and brought out the sweet-scented osmanthus cake inside.\u201cThis is sweet-scented osmanthus cake. The soft cake body is made of glutinous rice flour, orange flour, sugar, and oil, and it is served with delicious osmanthus honey. It tastes sweet and soft.\u201dWei Yilin proudly introduced to Wei Ruo.\u201cDo you think I have never eaten sweet-scented osmanthus cake?\u201d Wei Ruo wanted to laugh.\u201cI don\u2019t know if you have eaten it or not, but you must have never eaten the osmanthus cake made by my elder sister. The osmanthus honey she makes is different from other places. The osmanthus cake is unique. Every time she makes it, dad and mother Fight to eat with big brother!\u201d\u201cDoes it have anything to do with me that she made osmanthus cake well?\u201d\u201cKnowing how to make sweet-scented osmanthus cake is only one aspect. My eldest sister is very good at playing piano, chess, calligraphy and painting. It can be said that she is a well-deserved talented woman, and is recognized by all the gentlemen in the county!\u201d\u201cSo what? What are you trying to tell me?\u201d\u201cI want to tell you that my eldest sister is very good, and she is better than you in all aspects. Whether she is my own sister or not, in the eyes of my parents, elder brother and me, she is a well-deserved eldest daughter of the Wei family. Girl, I hope you will recognize your identity in the future, don\u2019t do things that bully your sister, don\u2019t make her angry, accept your identity as the second young lady obediently, and don\u2019t compete with my eldest sister, can you do it?\u201dWei Ruo laughed out loud.\u201cWhat are you laughing at?\u201d Wei Yilin raised his face and frowned.(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

You stop me now and don\u2019t let me go. Could it be that\u2026 you actually like my sister? You just don\u2019t admit it? Little idiot, you\u2019re duplicity!\u201d Wei Ruo frowned. Curved, with a charming smile.\u201cWhat are you talking about! Don\u2019t talk nonsense!\u201d Wei Yilin was anxious.What little idiot? It made his skin crawl!\u201cIsn\u2019t it? Then why are you stopping me from letting me go? Do you want to have a good chat with my sister and enhance our relationship?\u201d\u201cNo, no, no!\u201d Wei Yilin hurriedly shook his head in denial.\u201cIf you don\u2019t, go back obediently and go play with your favorite sister. Otherwise, I will really suspect that you are acting like a baby with me in a different way!\u201dWei Yilin froze.Wei Ruo smiled lightly and turned around to enter the room. Wei Yilin who was left behind could only stare at Wei Ruo\u2019s back and sulk.After a long while, Wei Yilin ran to Wangmeiyuan to find Wei Qingwan to express his dissatisfaction with Wei Ruo.\u201cSister, tell me, isn\u2019t that Wei Ruo a very village woman! How can Miss Qianjin grow vegetables in her yard and even climb the ladder to the top of the wall?\u201d\u201cYi Lin is good, she may not be doing well, but as family members, we shouldn\u2019t say that about her.\u201d Wei Qingwan comforted.\u201cBut she is very irritating!\u201d Wei Yilin couldn\u2019t help but think of what Wei Ruochou shamelessly said later that he liked her as a sister and wanted to take the opportunity to strengthen his relationship with her, which made his skin crawl all over the ground. The more he thought about it, the more he said Angry, the more I think about it, the more depressed I get.\u201cYilin is not angry. Since you know what kind of person she is, there is no need to be angry with her about these things. If you make yourself angry, my sister will feel bad.\u201dWei Qingwan touched Wei Yilin\u2019s head, and her gentle voice flowed into Wei Yilin\u2019s heart like a clear spring.Wei Yilin instantly felt that he was not so angry: \u201cSister, you are so kind! Two people born at about the same time, you are in the same sky and the same place, the difference is too great!\u201d\u201cYou!\u201d Wei Qingwan lightly tapped Wei Yilin\u2019s forehead with her index finger, \u201cDon\u2019t be so reckless in the future, and say such bad things, big brother is right, those words should not be said in front of outsiders, let people know , but I want to find your fault, my sister doesn\u2019t want you to be punished by your parents for making mistakes.\u201d\u201cUnderstood, sister, I will restrain myself next time.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not just restraint, it\u2019s about not going to trouble her. If she does something wrong, I will be taught by my parents and elder brother. You are a younger brother, so you shouldn\u2019t talk to her like this, do you know?\u201d Wei Qingwan instructed softly.\u201cIsn\u2019t it that elder brother asked me to give her sweet-scented osmanthus cake? She didn\u2019t appreciate it, so I couldn\u2019t hold back for a while! I swear when I first went, I really planned to have a good talk with her!\u201d\u201cWell, I know Yi Lin is very good.\u201d\u201cFortunately, my parents didn\u2019t let her be the eldest daughter of our family. She is not qualified to be the eldest daughter of our family at all!\u201d Wei Yilin secretly rejoiced.\u201cActually, this eldest daughter should give it to her. I am really ashamed that my parents love me so much.\u201d\u201cNo, I think the decision of parents is the clearest. Sister, you should be the eldest daughter! Our whole family recognizes you!\u201dWei Qingwan patted Wei Yilin\u2019s head: \u201cThank you Yilin for trusting me so much.\u201d\u201cOf course, since I can remember, the one who has accompanied me the most and taught me the most is my sister. If I don\u2019t trust you, who should I trust?\u201dNot long after Wei Yilin was born, Wei Mingting was transferred to Xingshan County. He was busy with business, Yun was also busy with many family matters, and Wei Yichen was busy with studying, so Wei Qingwan was the one who accompanied Wei Yilin the most, and his relationship with Wei Qingwan was the strongest. deep.###Wei Ruo\u2019s small courtyard renovation plan went smoothly. Early this morning, Wei Ruo cut the sweet potato vines that had been sent out, and divided the loofah seedlings.Sweet potatoes are seeds in the space, and planting them can help her earn experience points. Loofahs, pumpkins, and gourds are just ready for planting season, and Wei Ruo likes the feeling of them climbing all over the shelves and hanging their fruits.After working for a while, Wei Ruogang sat down and took a sip of water.Yun\u2019s maid, Cuiping, came over and invited Wei Ruo to Yun\u2019s room, saying that Yun had something to look for her.Seeing Cuiping\u2019s expression, Wei Ruo sensed that something was going on.When they arrived at Yun\u2019s house, they saw that Wei Qingwan was already there.Looking at Yun\u2019s dignified expression again, Wei Ruo concluded that something really happened.Seeing Wei Ruo entering the door, Yun waved her hand, beckoning her to come to him.Wei Ruo got closer, but still kept a little distance.\u201cRuo\u2019er, there\u2019s a letter from the capital. Your grandfather has already added your name to the genealogy. From now on, your official name will be Wei Qingruo.\u201dYun\u2019s brows were furrowed, and his expression didn\u2019t look like he had only this one thing to say.\u201cMom, what\u2019s the matter with you? Is there something bothering you?\u201d Wei Qingwan hurriedly asked softly.Yunshi looked at Wei Ruo and Wei Qingwan, hesitant to speak.After thinking for a long time, she opened her mouth: \u201cWanwan, there is one more thing I want to tell you. Don\u2019t be sad after listening.\u201d\u201cMother, tell me, I\u2019m fine.\u201d\u201cYour grandfather meant that he wanted Ruo\u2019er to be the eldest daughter, and your name should be written after Ruo\u2019er.\u201dHearing that Wei Ruo was a little surprised, although she thought that the old man might have different opinions on this matter, she didn\u2019t expect the old man to make such a straightforward decision, and she didn\u2019t discuss it with Wei Mingting and Yun\u2019s.Wei Qingwan was stunned, her face paled visibly, and then tears filled her eyes.\u201cWanwan\u2026\u201d Seeing her daughter like this, Yun\u2019s heart became more and more heavy.\u201cMother\u2026\u201d Wei Qingwan threw herself into Yun\u2019s arms, tears rolling down one after another like a broken pearl necklace.Yun\u2019s heart ached, and she didn\u2019t know how to comfort such a sad daughter.Wei Ruo helped her and said: \u201cIn fact, the eldest daughter and the second daughter are not very important. The love of parents is the same, and there will be no less.\u201dYun was stunned for a moment before realizing that this was what she said to Wei Ruo two days ago.Wei Ruo continued: \u201cAnd this is what Sister Qingwan asked for at the beginning. Now that her wish has come true, Sister Qingwan should also be happy.\u201dThese are Wei Qingwan\u2019s original words.Wei Qingwan raised her head from Yun\u2019s embrace, and stared at Wei Ruo blankly, she looked very much like a wounded little rabbit.\u201cIsn\u2019t it?\u201d Wei Ruo asked back.(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 11": "Chapter 11 - gift from grandfatherPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 11 A gift from my grandfatherThe two of them didn\u2019t know how to answer for a while.Wei Ruo continued to help the two analyze, and persuaded the two to relax with a serious expression:\u201cThink about the good side of everything and change your mind. Mother said that the two of us are equally important in your heart. If they are the same, it is the same whoever is older and who suffers the most. Qingwan has also realized what you asked for that day. matter. So you don\u2019t have to be sad.\u201dBoth Yunshi and Wei Qingwan were choked, they said what they said, Wei Ruo just repeated it.Wei Ruo said to Wei Qingwan again: \u201cActually, the first time you saw me, you called me sister. I think you also recognized me as your sister in your heart, so I think you must be looking forward to me being you in your heart.\u201d Sister\u2019s.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026 yes\u2026 my sister is right\u2026\u201d Wei Qingwan responded with some reluctance.Wei Ruo has already talked about this point, even if Wei Qingwan\u2019s tears reach the inside of the eyes, they can\u2019t fall.Then Wei Ruo handed a handkerchief to Wei Qingwan: \u201cWipe your tears.\u201dWei Qingwan took the handkerchief Wei Ruo handed over, but dared not use it.Clean is clean, but the material is a bit rough, and it turns white after washing. I don\u2019t know how long it has been used.After what Wei Ruo said, Yun Shi and Wei Qingwan stopped their tears, and then Yun Shi talked to them for a while, and then let them go back to rest.After Wei Ruo and Wei Qingwan left, the eldest maid Cuiping presented a gift list to the Yun family.It arrived with Wei Ruo\u2019s grandfather\u2019s reply letter, and some gifts from his grandfather to Wei Ruo.The letter stated that it was to compensate Wei Ruo for the hardships he suffered outside these years.Getting the item list, thinking of Wei Qingwan who just cried uncomfortably, Yun made the decision after thinking for a while, and divided the things into two parts, one to Wei Ruo\u2019s Tingsong Garden, and the other to Wei Qingwan\u2019s Wangmei Garden.And specifically explained to Cuiping, telling them only that it was a gift from their grandfather, without mentioning the reason.Cuiping did as he did, and not long after, Wei Ruo\u2019s Tingsong Garden and Wei Qingwan\u2019s Wangmei Garden both received two large boxes of gifts.According to Yun\u2019s intention, Cuiping only said that the grandfather gave it to his granddaughter, and didn\u2019t say much else.Not long after, Wei Ruo received several large wooden boxes sent by the Yun family.The box is quite big and heavy, but when opened, there are mostly copper wares, which take up space and weight, but are not that valuable.Xiumei followed Wei Ruo\u2019s instructions and put the delivered things into Wei Ruo\u2019s room one by one to show her respect for her grandfather.When she was arranging things, Xiumei was curious: \u201cMiss, didn\u2019t you say that our family is an extraordinary family, a family of meritorious service, the kind that is very powerful, why do these things I think are not as good as your own, Miss?\u201d\u201cBecause you can\u2019t just look at the surface. The Wei family is unattainable in the eyes of the He family, but in fact, you can only know how rich it is if you are in it. The so-called family of meritorious service cannot always be rich and prominent. , no matter how rich the family is, there will be times when it will be ruined.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Xiumei nodded.\u201cSo we have to take a long-term view, and we can\u2019t worry about the limited resources and wealth in the mansion. There is a wider world outside, and more wealth is waiting for me.\u201d Wei Ruo said.\u201cYes! Miss is right!\u201d Xiumei has been influenced by Wei Ruo for so many years, and has already fully accepted Wei Ruo\u2019s idea of self-reliance.Speaking of which, Xiumei muttered: \u201cI don\u2019t know when Mama Xu will arrive.\u201dMother Xu is Wei Ruo\u2019s nanny, and she is very kind to Wei Ruo. In the original book, she is the only one who protects Wei Ruo to the end, and in the end she lost her life for the original owner.In this life, Wei Ruo let her terminate the employment relationship with the He family early on, and let her go out to do business with her husband, and Wei Ruo advised her behind the scenes.Wei Ruo\u2019s original idea was to repay the nanny and let the couple live a good life.But the couple insisted on leaving all these properties to Wei Ruo, insisting that they were only taking care of Wei Ruo temporarily.The couple handed over all the money they earned to Wei Ruo, and they only got some salary.When leaving Mojiazha, Wei Ruo left a letter at the old Li\u2019s house at the entrance of the village, counting the time, if the nanny saw the letter, she should already be on her way to Taizhou.###Same as Wei Ruo\u2019s side, Wei Qingwan also received several large wooden boxes.After opening it, Wei Qingwan couldn\u2019t help feeling disappointed when she saw the not-so-valuable bronze wares inside.Nurse Li, who was beside Wei Qingwan, helped Wei Qingwan count the things delivered by the Yun family, then frowned and said:\u201cMiss, the things sent from the capital seem to be much worse than those sent in previous festivals. In previous years, they were all good things like silk and satin, but this year I didn\u2019t see a single piece of material.\u201dWei Qingwan lowered her head, looked lonely, and murmured: \u201cAfter all, I am not the granddaughter of the Wei family\u2019s direct relatives. It is already a kindness for my grandfather to leave me on the genealogy. Those silks, satins, pearls and jades must be sent to Wei. The daughter of the family\u2019s first relative, how can I be an outsider?\u201d\u201cMiss, what nonsense are you talking about! Master, madam, young master, young master, who in this house doesn\u2019t recognize you as a young lady? You are not an outsider!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the use of that, the meaning of grandfather is very clear, I am not worthy to be the daughter of the Wei family\u2026\u201dWei Qingwan\u2019s eyes were red, and the tears that hadn\u2019t finished crying in Yun\u2019s room couldn\u2019t stop flowing now.Nanny Li looked around and saw no one around, so she approached Wei Qingwan and whispered in her ear:\u201cMiss, please don\u2019t be discouraged yourself. You see, among the three masters, our master is the most promising, and among the young masters, our young master is the most promising. He was selected as a scholar at the age of twelve. After two years If you win another Juren, your future will be limitless!\u201d\u201cMiss, you have the favor of the master, the eldest and the young master. In the future, ordinary people will not be able to compare! The approval of the old man is not so important to you!\u201dNurse Li analyzed clearly, Wei Qingwan also listened to some of it, but she felt uneasy after all, she lowered her head and murmured about her hesitation and helplessness in the past few days:\u201cBut the love of my father, mother, and elder brother is going to be shared with my elder sister\u2026 I don\u2019t want my elder sister to share the love of my father, mother, and elder brother. It\u2019s just that with my current status, the only ones I can rely on in the Captain\u2019s Mansion are my parents.\u201d Brother loves me so much\u2026\u201d\u201cThese days, I keep telling myself not to resent the injustice of God for letting me encounter such things, and not to resent others for letting me fall from the clouds to the mud. After Wei Qingruo entered the mansion, I often went to see her to express my feelings. Goodwill, hope to get along with each other in the future.\u201d\u201cBut when I learned about my grandfather\u2019s arrangement, I couldn\u2019t help but panic when I thought about the kind-hearted grandfather who had been kind to me before. , I wouldn\u2019t be so uncomfortable. Wei Qingruo didn\u2019t make a fuss or ask for it, but my grandfather gave it to her, which shows how much my grandfather attaches importance to her.\u201d(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 12": "Chapter 12 - want to go outPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 12 Want to go out\u201cI am afraid that one day my father, mother, and elder brother will be like my grandfather and abandon me like a shoe. The thought of such a day will appear, and my heart is like being roasted by fire.\u201dHearing this, Nanny Li hurriedly comforted: \u201cMiss, you don\u2019t have to worry about this. They love the eldest lady because of their blood relationship, but they love you, miss, because of the friendship you have had for more than ten years. That\u2019s true. No one can erase it!\u201d\u201cMissy has lived in the countryside for more than ten years. She has no knowledge or self-cultivation. She has concealed it very well in the past few days when she first entered the mansion, but she didn\u2019t carry it in her bones. Sooner or later, she will show her feet. Now she is just acquainted. Because of the debt, Madam and Young Master naturally have a lot of tolerance towards the eldest lady, and after a long time, this tolerance will be worn away.\u201dNanny Li analyzed the pros and cons for Wei Qingwan.Wei Qingwan shook her head: \u201cIf she was really as rough and arrogant as you said, I wouldn\u2019t be so worried, but I saw that Wei Qingruo\u2019s behavior at the dinner table was not as rough as ordinary mountain women, you said That kind of situation may not happen\u2026\u201dNanny Li looked worried: \u201cMiss, don\u2019t always think in a bad direction, don\u2019t worry, I have seen her true face when I taught the eldest lady how to behave in the past few days, and I am sure that she is in front of Mrs. That well-behaved appearance is all faked.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Wei Qingwan couldn\u2019t help being overjoyed.\u201cit is true!\u201d\u201cNurse, I also know that I shouldn\u2019t hope for my sister\u2019s bad luck. I\u2019m just too scared\u2026I\u2019m like the duckweed in that pond now. If I\u2019m not careful, I don\u2019t know where I will go\u2026 \u201c\u201cOld slave knows, miss, you are kind-hearted. If it weren\u2019t for the fact that miss has suffered too much grievance recently, she definitely wouldn\u2019t think about others like this. Don\u2019t worry, miss, there are some things that old slave will do for you, and you don\u2019t need to Worrying and sad.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026\u201dWith Mother Li\u2019s comfort, Wei Qingwan\u2019s mood improved a bit.Then she fell asleep under the service of Nanny Li and Cui He.###Early the next morning, Wei Ruo went to Yun Shi and told her about his idea of going out.Just planting some crops in the yard is far from enough for Wei Ruo.One is that space upgrades require more experience; two, she needs to earn more capital for her own life to ensure that she has the ability to survive after leaving the Wei family.So Wei Ruo now needs to find a way to expand her business. First of all, she has to go out.As a lady of every family, I can\u2019t go out easily. If I want to go out, I must ask the head of the house for permission.\u201cWhere does Ruo\u2019er want to go?\u201d Yun asked patiently without getting angry.\u201cI want to go around the county and see the villages and fields over there. I wonder if it\u2019s convenient?\u201d\u201cThere is no problem with the surrounding mountain villages, but you can only go to the northwest, not outside the southeast city, let alone the seaside, those unscrupulous Japanese pirates will come out to make troubles at some point. Let\u2019s do it, our family has a family in the north of the city. It\u2019s a terraced field mountain, go and have a look there.\u201d Yun explained.\u201cOkay.\u201d Just what she wanted.\u201cI\u2019ll go with you after I read the ledger later, okay?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t bother, I can go by myself.\u201d\u201cThat won\u2019t work, Ruo\u2019er, you are a lady now, and you can no longer run around casually. Although the city is not as dangerous as the outside, it is still not safe enough for a girl like you.\u201d\u201cThen mother can just find someone to follow me. You don\u2019t have to go to the trouble of accompanying me personally. My mother has to deal with the affairs of the whole family. I can\u2019t delay my mother any longer and make her suffer.\u201dYun Shi went with her, it would be inconvenient for her to do things.Yun Shi: \u201cRuo\u2019er is really sensible and knows how to care for her.\u201dUh\u2026 she didn\u2019t actually mean that.\u201cMother let me go by myself.\u201d Wei Ruo said.\u201cOkay, I also know that you are not very used to the life in the mansion, you can go and have a look, but you can\u2019t run around, you know?\u201d\u201cgood.\u201dWith Yun\u2019s approval, Wei Ruo hurriedly prepared to go out.Yun Shi sent a carriage, a nanny and a guard to accompany Wei Ruo.That nanny is the other of the two nanny who went to pick up Wei Ruo at the beginning \u2013 Nanny Zhang.Knowing that Wei Ruo was going to the countryside again, Nanny Zhang murmured in her heart.Why is this young lady endless? Isn\u2019t it enough to stay in the country for so many years? Why did you go back to the mansion and become an official lady, and you still think about the things in the countryside?If this continues, let alone going to the capital in the future, you will be laughed at, even in Xingshan County, you will become the laughing stock of other officials\u2019 wives!Although she was very reluctant in her heart, Nanny Zhang had no choice but to do so because of her wife\u2019s request. She also had a smile on her face when she saw Wei Ruo.Wei Ruo went out of the city in a carriage, and when he left the north city gate, he could see rolling hills in the distance, almost all of which had been cultivated into terraced fields.Xingshan County faces the sea in the southeast, and the wasteland outside the city is mostly saline-alkali land, which is not conducive to planting. Therefore, the residents living there live by fishing. Now Japanese pirates are rampant, and fishermen have fled into the city.In the northwest, there are hills, with many mountains and slopes, and little arable land. The hardworking people cultivated terraced fields and planted rice on the hills.However, terraced fields require more manpower than cultivated land, and the difficulty of planting also increases a lot.So even if so many terraced fields have been cultivated, there is still not enough food.The carriage stopped before a small hill, and Xiumei helped Wei Ruo get out of the carriage.Nanny Zhang pointed to the small hill in front of her and said to Wei Ruo, \u201cMiss, this is Mantou Mountain, which is the property of our Captain\u2019s Mansion.\u201d\u201cIs this a mountain all?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201canything else?\u201d\u201cNo, Xiaowei\u2019s Mansion has only been in Xingshan County for five years, and the foundation here is still a bit weak. But your grandfather is a loyal uncle in the capital, and his family background is much farther away.\u201d Zhang Nanny replied.Nurse said excitedly, but Wei Ruo knew in her heart that the old house of the Wei family had already been exhausted, leaving only an empty shell of the Earl\u2019s Mansion.Wei Mingting is still quite capable, as a captain of the sixth grade, Xiao\u2019s family can still buy some property, unlike his two elder brothers, they will only lose the property left by their ancestors.\u201cI\u2019ll go around.\u201d Wei Ruo walked along the path down the mountain after finishing speaking.Nanny Zhang had no choice but to follow behind.After walking for a while, Nanny Zhang felt strenuous, and couldn\u2019t help but mutter in her heart.What the **** is this doing? When are you going to go?Her old bones!Seeing Nanny Zhang struggling, Wei Ruo asked her to go back to the carriage to rest first, but Nanny Zhang refused, she was worried about Wei Ruo.I don\u2019t know what this country girl will do, and I don\u2019t expect to be implicated.After walking for a while, Wei Ruo stopped in front of an uncultivated barren mountain.(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 13": "Chapter 13 - People sufferingPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 13 People\u2019s Suffering\u201cXiumei, go find out which village this mountain belongs to.\u201d Wei Ruo ordered.\u201cgood.\u201dXiumei trots towards the direction of the people. Most of the people working in the nearby fields are locals. Just ask them and you can get the answer Wei Ruo wants.After a while, Xiumei came back and told Wei Ruo that the name of the mountain was Xiaoyang Mountain, and it belonged to an industry called Yueying Village not far away. Because the terrain was relatively steep and the cost of reclaiming terraced fields was too high, it had been left deserted. The villagers are all chopping firewood on that mountain.\u201cDid you ask them if they would sell it?\u201d Wei Ruo asked.\u201cOf course I did.\u201dXiumei has been by Wei Ruo\u2019s side for so many years, how can she not know what Wei Ruo thinks.\u201cAlthough the person I asked is not from Yueying Village, he said that as long as the price is right, the villagers will definitely agree to sell it. The people in Xingshan County have had a hard time because of the Japanese pirates, and Yueying Village has suffered a lot. , other villages still have a few acres of arable fields, and Yueying Village is all barren hills that are not easy to cultivate.\u201d\u201cWell, I see.\u201dNurse Zhang listened to the conversation between the master and the servant, and couldn\u2019t help laughing.\u201cMiss, don\u2019t you want to buy this Xiaoyang Mountain?\u201d\u201cJust asking, to understand the situation.\u201d Wei Ruo said casually.\u201cIt\u2019s okay to ask, but the idea of buying the mountain should be kept in your stomach, Miss. Our Captain\u2019s Mansion only bought Mantou Mountain after coming to Xingshan County for three years, even though the people in Xingshan County are not living well now. It\u2019s okay, the price of that mountain can\u2019t be too low, less than one thousand taels of silver, don\u2019t even think about it.\u201d\u201cOne thousand taels\u2026 That\u2019s really a lot of silver.\u201d Wei Ruo murmured, with a thoughtful expression.\u201cMiss, it\u2019s good that you know. If you miss the days in the country, then go to Mantou Mountain and take a look at your own fields, but don\u2019t do it yourself like before, and let the long-term workers see it and make a joke. of!\u201dGrowing vegetables in the mansion, only the people in their mansion know, and the embarrassment is also thrown at home.If she can\u2019t help but do the same outside, then this person will be lost to the whole Xingshan County.\u201cOK.\u201dWei Ruo didn\u2019t confront Mammy this time, so he really turned around and went back to Mantou Mountain.After a few laps near the foot of the mountain, I went back.###In Xiaowei\u2019s Mansion, Wei Qingwan is supervising Wei Yilin\u2019s copying of \u201cXue Er\u201d.Wei Yilin was active and playful since he was a child, not for reading.Today, he was sent back by his husband because of fighting in the school. After learning about it, Yun was very angry and punished him for copying \u201cXue Er\u201d. Wei Qingwan was in charge of supervision.Wei Yilin pursed his mouth, very reluctantly, did not write a few words, and looked around from time to time.\u201cYi Lin, hurry up and write, otherwise you won\u2019t be able to finish writing after dark, and you will be hungry if you don\u2019t have dinner.\u201d Wei Qingwan said with a distressed face.\u201cThree times are too many! Sister, my good sister, you can copy for me, you can imitate, if you imitate my handwriting, mother can\u2019t tell.\u201d Wei Yilin acted like a baby and begged Wei Qingwan to help himself.\u201cNo way\u2026\u201d Wei Qingwan looked embarrassed.\u201cSister! My good sister! You are my only good sister!\u201dHearing this \u201cone and only\u201d, Wei Qingwan was moved.Now at home, only the younger brother is single-minded towards her, and she doesn\u2019t want to lose his love and trust for her.\u201cThen\u2026 that\u2019s fine.\u201d Wei Qingwan said, \u201cBut I will only copy it for you once, and you still have to copy the remaining two times by yourself.\u201d\u201cNo problem!\u201d Wei Yilin immediately cheered up, \u201cI knew that my sister loved me the most, no more than that newcomer, who didn\u2019t know what to do every day, and today she actually asked my mother to let her go out.\u201d\u201cShe went out? Where did she go?\u201d Wei Qingwan asked in surprise.\u201cI went to the north of the city and said I went to see farming. Do you think she is weird? She likes farming so much, so she just stays in the country. Why do you want to come back?\u201d Wei Yilin said disgustedly.\u201cDid mother accompany her?\u201d Wei Qingwan asked.\u201cShe went by herself, mother is so busy, and mother has to worry about so many things at home, so she doesn\u2019t have time to accompany her to do such things!\u201d\u201cIs that so\u2026\u201d Wei Qingwan was thoughtful, with a slightly downcast expression.Seeing Wei Qingwan\u2019s sad expression, Wei Yilin quickly comforted him: \u201cSister, don\u2019t worry, although mother is very good to her, but I\u2019m sure, mother\u2019s heart is the same as mine, she must like you far more than Wei Qingruo !\u201dWei Qingwan shook her head: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter, she has suffered in the countryside all these years, and her parents should treat her better. I owe her, how can she ask her parents to treat me better than her Woolen cloth?\u201d\u201cSister, you just think too much and think too much about other people.\u201d Wei Yilin said helplessly with his mouth flattened.\u201cWe are a family, I should think about everyone, Yi Lin, you are not young anymore, you should think more about your parents, don\u2019t make trouble anymore.\u201d\u201cI know, I know.\u201d I promised, but I didn\u2019t take it to heart at all.###On the way back from the north of the city, Wei Ruo looked at the scenery along the way through the window of the carriage.She saw many beggars begging along the street, more than anywhere else she had been.The street is not as prosperous as she imagined in the county town, and it is not as lively as Huaibei Town.Ask Nanny Zhang, and learned that many of them are local fishermen. Because of the Japanese pirates\u2019 troubles, they couldn\u2019t fish and lost their livelihood, so they fell to this point.In addition, the weather has been bad in recent years, the wind and rain have not been smooth, the rice output has been greatly reduced, farmers have failed to harvest, and some people with poor foundations have been reduced to begging to survive.Knowing the reason, Wei Ruo looked at those ragged and skinny beggars again, and couldn\u2019t help but feel a little depressed.Especially when their sights met her, a gorgeously dressed young lady who was accompanied by servants in a carriage, Wei Ruo, a modern soul, couldn\u2019t help trembling slightly.There was no light in their eyes. When they looked at Wei Ruo, their eyes were empty and numb. There was no jealousy or hatred, as if they had accepted this miserable life.After walking for a while, Wei Ruo saw a hawker who was selling seafood.After asking, I learned that the fishermen went out to fish in the middle of the night at the risk of being killed by Japanese pirates.But because everyone\u2019s living conditions are not very good, the sales are not very good, and there are still a lot of baskets left.Wei Ruo saw that the seafood was very fresh, so she asked Xiumei to buy them all.Hearing that Wei Ruo said they would buy them all, Nanny Zhang, who was with her, immediately widened her eyes, and then said to Wei Ruo as tactfully as possible: \u201cMiss, seafood is not cheap, and there are fewer people selling seafood nowadays. It\u2019s too high, this big basket costs at least two taels of silver!\u201dWhere did Wei Ruo get the money to buy so many things?Take other things, and the money can\u2019t be paid, and lose the face of the school captain\u2019s mansion.Otherwise, she would have to pay on credit first, and ask someone to go to the Captain\u2019s Mansion to collect the money, and then the Captain\u2019s Mansion would have to pay for her wayward behavior.\u201cWell, I know, I use my own money.\u201d Wei Ruo could see what Aunt Zhang was worried about.Private money? Where did she get her private money?(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 14": "Chapter 14 - Seafood HotpotPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 14 Seafood Hot PotNurse Zhang looked disbelieving, but saw that Xiumei who got out of the car to buy something had already handed over two taels of silver to the seafood seller.Then without waiting for the accompanying guards to help, Xiumei moved the basket of seafood to the carriage by herself.After being dazed for a while, Nanny Zhang guessed in her heart that Wei Ruo\u2019s money probably came from the gifts that the old man in the capital gave Wei Ruo two days ago.I muttered in my heart, even if I got my own money from the old man, I can\u2019t spend it like this, I really don\u2019t know how to manage a house.After returning to Tingsongyuan, Xiumei moved the basket of seafood into Tingsongyuan again.\u201cMeimei, how about\u2026\u201d Wei Ruo stared at the basket of seafood.\u201cMiss, do you want to eat hot pot?\u201d Xiumei immediately saw through Wei Ruo\u2019s thoughts.\u201cYeah, Meimei, you really understand me!\u201d She hasn\u2019t even spoken yet! Meimei guessed everything right!\u201cMiss, I really can\u2019t guess what you are thinking about other things, but in this matter, as long as you take a look at me, I will immediately know what you want to do.\u201d\u201cWell, pick out some of them to make seafood hot pot, and we\u2019ll dry the rest to make dry goods after processing.\u201dSpicy pot bottom, seafood ingredients, just thinking about this pot makes Wei Ruo twitch his index finger.\u201cBut Miss, have you forgotten that we don\u2019t have a kitchen, we don\u2019t have pots, and we can\u2019t make hot pot.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t there a small kitchen in Yingzhuyuan next door? Maybe I can borrow it.\u201d Wei Ruo said.\u201cThat\u2019s right! There\u2019s a small kitchen next door!\u201d Xiumei suddenly realized something after she finished speaking, \u201cMiss, you don\u2019t mean to send soy sauce to the second young master just because of this, so you can build a good relationship?\u201d\u201cAh? Is there? How can I? Am I such a person?\u201d Wei Ruo felt guilty.Xiumei nodded.Miss, you are definitely such a person!\u201cAhem, that\u2019s not important, the important thing is that there is a place to cook the hot pot and turn on a small stove. Meimei, you prepare, get all the ingredients, and we will go to the next door to cook the hot pot.\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019ll go look in the room and see how much of the spices you made before, Miss.\u201dXiumei turned around and entered the ear room that Wei Ruo used as a warehouse.When he came back, he was holding a white cloth bag in his hand.In this era, there is no chili, and there are not many spices. Wei Ruona\u2019s taste buds nourished by spices occasionally miss those stimulating tastes, so he collected all kinds of spices that can be collected in this era.Zanthoxylum bungeanum, Cornus officinalis, Fuliu teng, cinnamon, mustard, mix these spices, experiment with the ratio repeatedly, and then get the most suitable spice seasoning package for Wei Ruo.Wei Ruo mixed them well, packed them in cloth bags, and took out a bag when needed.\u201cThere is the last spice bag left. I used it this time. Next time, miss, if you want to eat again, you have to find a way to get those spices together again.\u201dWhen Xiumei brought back the spice package, she also brought back a piece of bad news.Those spices are not so easy to get, Wei Ruo spent a lot of effort to get them together before.Wei Ruo nodded: \u201cWait to be more stable, I not only need to get spices, but also some medicinal materials.\u201dThen Wei Ruo asked Xiumei to stay in Tingsong Garden to process the ingredients, and went to knock on the door of Yingzhu Garden by himself.The courtyard door opened, and Xiao Bei asked in surprise, \u201cMiss, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cI want to borrow your small kitchen. As a reward, I will treat you to a seafood hot pot! My Meimei\u2019s cooking skills are very good, I guarantee you will not lose money!\u201d\u201cMiss\u2026 I can\u2019t make up my mind about this, I have to ask the young master.\u201d\u201cThen go ask your young master.\u201d\u201cOkay, miss, wait a moment, I\u2019ll go ask.\u201dXiaobei turned around and went to the courtyard.Wei Ruo poked his head to look in. Like the last time he came, Wei Jin was still sitting in the Octagonal Pavilion reading. He seemed to like sitting in the courtyard and reading.Some distance away, Wei Ruo couldn\u2019t hear the conversation between him and Xiao Bei, but he could see his face darken after Xiao Bei said something, and then he raised his head and looked in the direction of the door, his eyes matched Wei Ruo\u2019s. Right on.Wei Ruo grinned back, and reached out to greet Wei Jinyi.She smiled, and Wei Jinyi\u2019s complexion turned darker.What\u2019s the matter, is she not smiling kindly enough? She thinks she looks good when she smiles, Meimei said she looks good when she smiles!I don\u2019t know what Wei Jinyi said to Xiaobei, Xiaobei walked over with a look of embarrassment and said: \u201cMiss, the young master said, if you have anything you want to eat, just ask the big kitchen to make it. The child is small, and there are no good ingredients, so it is really not suitable.\u201d\u201cI bring my own ingredients and seasonings. I don\u2019t need yours. You just need to provide me with a place to cook. The big kitchen is inconvenient. It will take me a long time to cook.\u201dXiaobei looked embarrassed: \u201cBut Miss\u2026\u201d\u201cPlease please please.\u201d\u201cBut the young master\u2026\u201d Xiaobei turned his head to look in Wei Jinyi\u2019s direction, how could he make the decision, the young master asked him to refuse, but he didn\u2019t dare to offend the eldest lady.\u201cI\u2019ll talk to your young master myself!\u201dSeeing the problem, Wei Ruo bypassed Xiaobei and went straight to the Bajiao Pavilion.\u201cSecond Brother!\u201dThe sound of \u201cSecond Brother\u201d made Wei Jinyi frowned immediately.\u201cSecond brother, let me borrow your small kitchen here. We cook seafood hot pot, and you eat it together. I promise it tastes very good!\u201dWei Jin also looked at Wei Ruo, her eyes were twinkling, full of anticipation.After a while, Wei Jin also compromised: \u201cIt\u2019s up to you.\u201d\u201cThank you!\u201d Wei Ruo thanked happily, and then ran back to Tingsongyuan.Xiao Bei walked back to Wei Jinyi, and whispered: \u201cMaster, Missy is really different from other people in the house\u2026\u201dOther people in the mansion are afraid of their young master, but the eldest lady is lucky, last time she gave soy sauce, this time it is even more strange, she said that she would come to their small kitchen to cook hot pot\u2026\u201cLet her go, she looks like this, you can\u2019t explain it to her.\u201dWei Jin also doesn\u2019t like wasting words with others, and when Wei Ruogang came to Wei\u2019s house, he didn\u2019t understand many things, and he didn\u2019t act in a common sense, and there were many things he couldn\u2019t understand for a while.Not long after, Wei Jin also saw Wei Ruo entering his yard with his maid.The master and servant carried a bunch of things into the small kitchen with big bags and small bags.In the small kitchen, Xiumei is in charge of cooking, and Wei Ruo is helping to light the fire.When the pot is hot, add lard, and when the milky white lard melts, pour in the spice packets prepared by Wei Ruo.The smell of spices is very overbearing. After being stimulated by hot oil, it immediately filled the entire small kitchen and drifted into the yard.\u201cMaster, what is this smell? Why does it smell so good?\u201d Xiaobei sniffed and sniffed, making sure that it was something she had never smelled before.\u201cResearch ink.\u201dWei Jin was also expressionless.Xiaobei quickly regained consciousness and continued to grind Wei Jinyi.Wei Ruo ran out of the small kitchen, ran up to Wei Jinyi, and asked, \u201cSecond brother, I see that the bamboo shoots in your yard are growing quite well, why don\u2019t you let me break off a few and cut one?\u201d Let\u2019s cook it in a hot pot, shall we?\u201d(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 15": "Chapter 15 - The scene is a bit awkwardPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe scene in Chapter 15 is a bit embarrassingWhen Wei Ruo first entered the Yingzhu Garden, Wei Ruo saw the piece of light bamboo. At that time, the light bamboo shoots had not emerged yet.When I came here today, the bamboo shoots were already as long as her arm, and if I didn\u2019t eat them, I would grow old.Wei Jin was also forced to stop writing again, and looked up at Wei Ruo: \u201cIt\u2019s up to you.\u201dThe expression on his face showed alienation and indifference, and he agreed entirely because he didn\u2019t want to talk to Wei Ruoduo.\u201cOkay, thank you second brother, I will return you a plate of delicious bamboo shoots in a while!\u201dWei Ruo thanked him, then ran to the piece of light bamboo, and broke off all the well-grown light bamboo shoots.Then ran back to the small kitchen.There was a constant aroma coming from the small kitchen, and Xiao Bei, who was not very focused, swallowed while grinding ink.Hey, the young master\u2019s concentration is really good, such a strong fragrance can\u2019t affect him, and the writing is still so steady.Unlike him, he was not hungry at first, but smelling this fragrance, he felt that his Wu Zang Temple was the first to raise the white flag.After a while, Wei Ruo and Xiumei came out.Wei Ruo was holding a tray, and on the tray were several dishes with unknown seasonings, and Xiumei was holding a steaming big pot, and the aroma was emitted from that pot.The two of them entered the pavilion, Xiaobei was taken aback: \u201cMiss, what are you doing?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s eat hot pot with you! First put away the pen, ink, paper and inkstone on the table.\u201d Wei Ruo aimed at the only stone table in the pavilion.Now that stone table is full of Wei Jinyi\u2019s Four Treasures of Study.\u201cYou can take it home and eat it yourself, I don\u2019t need it.\u201d Wei Jin also coldly refused.\u201cNo, I said I have your share, and I keep my word. Otherwise, wouldn\u2019t it be just taking advantage of you for nothing? I don\u2019t like taking advantage of others.\u201dAs the saying goes, it\u2019s not difficult to borrow and repay. She will borrow the small kitchen in Yingzhuyuan in the future. If she doesn\u2019t start today, it will be difficult in the future.\u201cBesides, I cooked for four people. If you don\u2019t eat it, the rest will be wasted! These seafood are caught by fishermen risking their lives, and they can only be worthy of them if they are eaten well.\u201dServes for four? Xiaobei was surprised, he still had his share? He is a servant\u2026Wei Jin also looked at Wei Ruo, wondering what he was thinking, as if he wanted to refute Wei Ruo, but he didn\u2019t say anything.After a while, he chose to compromise, got up and cleaned up the books, pens, inks, papers and inkstones on the table, freeing up the stone table.Xiumei immediately put the pot on the table, seeing the layer of bright red oil on it, Wei Jin also frowned.Then Wei Ruo set out the dishes: \u201cMy secret dipping sauce, the second brother must try it.\u201dThe main ingredient of the dipping sauce is her secret soy sauce, with a little chopped green onion and a little mashed garlic. It tastes fresh and sweet, and it\u2019s just right for dipping seafood.Wei Jin also frowned even more as he looked at the small dish with unknown contents in front of him.Seeing that Wei Jinyi has not moved his chopsticks for a long time, Wei Ruo used clean chopsticks to pick up a piece of fish, put it on the plate in front of Wei Jinyi, wrapped it in the dipping sauce, and asked Wei Jinyi to taste it.\u201cSecond brother, try it, it\u2019s really good, I won\u2019t lie to you.\u201dUnder Wei Ruo\u2019s repeated urging and expectant eyes, Wei Jin finally moved his chopsticks in order to deal with Wei Ruo.I picked up a small piece, put it in my mouth, and tentatively and slowly chewed a couple of mouthfuls.After a while, Wei Jinyi suddenly coughed violently.Wei Ruo quickly poured water: \u201cSlow down, drink some water.\u201dWei Jin also drank a glass of water. Before he stopped coughing, Wei Ruo patted him on the back again.After a while, Wei Jinyi finally recovered.His complexion became rosy due to coughing, and two touches of blush fell on his fair skin, making him look more energetic.Wei Jin also put down his chopsticks: \u201cYou guys eat.\u201dThis\u2026 embarrassing\u2026\u201cWhy don\u2019t you try it again? The choking just now should be just an accident. If you try a few more times, you will discover its beauty.\u201d\u201cNo need.\u201d Wei Jin also sternly refused, this time his attitude was very firm and there was no room for maneuver.The atmosphere suddenly became a little awkward.Wei Jin didn\u2019t say much either, just got up and went back to the house expressionlessly, leaving Wei Ruo, Xiumei and Xiaobei behind.Xiaobei explained to Wei Ruo with a face of embarrassment: \u201cMiss, don\u2019t worry, my young master usually eats relatively light food, and he can\u2019t eat a lot of food.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s because I didn\u2019t think carefully, next time I will get him something else delicious.\u201d Wei Ruo said.Is there a next time? Xiaobei\u2019s eyes widened.In the end, Wei Ruo and Xiumei ate most of the pot. They were so full that they couldn\u2019t eat any more, so they had to leave some.Wei Ruo rubbed his belly, leaving Xiumei to clean up the mess after the meal, while he went back to Tingsongyuan, took a roll and put it in Wei Jinyi\u2019s pile of pens, inks, papers and inkstones.After Wei Ruo went back, Wei Jin came out of the room again, put the books, pen, ink, paper and inkstone back on the stone table, and resumed reading and writing.After putting everything back on the stone table, Wei Jin also saw a roll of paper inside that didn\u2019t belong to him.After unfolding, the cold white smooth and delicate paper is obviously different from other papers on Wei Jinyi\u2019s desk.\u201cWhere did this paper come from?\u201d\u201cOh, it seems that the eldest lady brought this over. She said it was an apology for you.\u201d\u201cThis is the paper from Sibaozhai.\u201d Wei Jin also looked at the paper with deep eyes.\u201cSibaozhai? Isn\u2019t that the piece of paper that the master gave the young master before? I remember the master said that it was given to him by a colleague. There were only ten pieces of paper in total, and I gave you and the young master five each. I also heard that the young master used After I bought it, I thought the paper was very good, so I wanted to ask someone to buy it, but Sibaozhai was in Huzhou Prefecture, so I couldn\u2019t buy it because it was too far away. Then how did the young miss have this paper?\u201d Xiaobei looked surprised.(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 16": "Chapter 16 - nanny is herePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 16 Here Comes the Nanny\u201cHuaibei Town is in Huzhou Prefecture.\u201d Wei Jin also said.\u201cThat\u2019s right, the eldest lady is from Huaibei Town, no wonder she has this paper!\u201d\u201cThis paper is not cheap.\u201d Wei Jin also said in a deep voice.Ten sheets of ordinary paper cost one penny, but Sibaozhai\u2019s paper costs five pennies per sheet, fifty times the price of ordinary paper.The most important thing is that Sibaozhai\u2019s paper is not easy to buy. Although it is expensive, because of its excellent quality, many noble children rush to buy it. As a result, Sibaozhai sells it in limited quantities every day, and while stocks last.And Wei Ruo gave him 20 cards casually.Where did she get the money? And why are you so nice to him? What is her purpose?###After returning to Tingsongyuan, Wei Ruo lazily lay on the bed.When you are full and full, the blood goes to the stomach, the brain is empty, and it is suitable for a daze.\u201cMiss, why do I feel that you treat the second young master better than the master, wife and the young master? I think the young master treats the young lady better than the second young master. The second young master is cold and unwilling to talk to the young lady. On the other hand, the young master is even more She is more gentle and considerate, and she also vacated the yard where she lives for Miss.\u201d Xiumei was curious.\u201cBecause I have no pressure to get along with the second young master.\u201d\u201cIs the young master under pressure?\u201d\u201cYes, if I treat the eldest young master well, people will think that I am fighting for favor, but the second young master is a transparent person. I don\u2019t need to be pressured to treat him well or badly. I can come as I like.\u201d\u201cWell, although I don\u2019t understand these things very well, I know that Miss must be right.\u201dWei Ruo smiled lightly, but it wasn\u2019t just a matter of not wanting to compete for favor.She has inherited the memory of the original owner, and because of fetal wear, whether she is willing or not, she will have some emotions when facing the hurt of her previous life and abandoning her family.This is not something she can control if she wants to, it cannot be suppressed simply with rational thinking.She also knew that the original owner\u2019s final death was inseparable from her own death, but the original owner\u2019s longing for family love and the despair of being abandoned by the family have been deeply engraved in Wei Ruo\u2019s heart.So even if Yun Shi and Wei Yichen treat her very well now, she can\u2019t face them with an open heart.On the other hand, Wei Jinyi, he didn\u2019t leave any trace in the original owner\u2019s memory, and he was an insignificant existence in the original work. When facing him, she didn\u2019t have any grudges, and she didn\u2019t need to have extra worries.Just like when facing neighbors in Mojiazha, as long as the other party has no bad intentions for me, I can get along with the other party frankly and friendly, and will give the other party some help where I can.The ease and freedom that Yun Shi and Wei Yichen could not give.Of course, seeing his small kitchen is also a very important part of the reason. It is still very important for her to be greedy by cooking some delicious food from time to time!###The next day, Wei Ruo was cutting off the vines from sweet potatoes for cuttings.Xiumei came back from the outside with an anxious expression on her face: \u201cMiss, it\u2019s Brother Xiaoyong! The person who is making trouble with the guards of the Captain\u2019s Mansion outside is Brother Zhengyong!\u201dThe brother Zhengyong that Xiumei is talking about is Xu Zhengyong, the son of Wei Ruo\u2019s nanny Xu\u2019s mother.\u201cWhy did you make a fuss?\u201d\u201cI heard voices inside the door. Mother Xu has been delivering letters to the guards at the door for the past two days. She wanted to see Miss, but they were all stopped by the guards and driven away. Brother Zheng Yong was so angry that he came here today on behalf of Mother Xu. , and ended up arguing with the guards, saying why they didn\u2019t deliver the letter they delivered according to the rules of the Captain\u2019s Mansion.\u201dXiumei was so anxious that she was sweating profusely: \u201cI said that mother Xu should have arrived according to the date, but it turned out that the letter couldn\u2019t come in!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, follow me to the door.\u201dWei Ruo put down the potato vines in his hands, tidied himself up a bit, and led Xiumei to the door.When I came to the door, I saw Xu Zhengyong who was arguing with the guards of the Captain\u2019s Mansion.A fourteen-year-old boy, his skin is bronzed from the sun all year round, and he is dressed like a farmer.Because of the quarrel, the boy blushed from face to neck.Seeing Wei Ruo coming out, the eyes of the dejected young man suddenly brightened. Just as he was about to call Wei Ruo, his mother\u2019s advice immediately came to mind.Mother said, now that Miss Ruoer is the lady of Xiaowei\u2019s Mansion, she is more and more different from the past, and she should be more careful in what he says, and he must not cause trouble for the lady.So Xu Zhengyong refrained from speaking.When Wei Ruo arrived, Wei Yichen was already at the door.Seeing Wei Ruo coming, Wei Yichen said to her: \u201cDon\u2019t go over there. When the outsider is making trouble at the door of the house, don\u2019t go out to watch the fun.\u201d\u201cHe is my nanny\u2019s son.\u201d Wei Ruo said.Hearing this, Wei Yichen frowned, then looked at the young man at the door, and immediately understood.\u201cYou can\u2019t see him, but if you want to see your nanny, I\u2019ll help you arrange it.\u201d\u201cOkay, please don\u2019t let the guards make things difficult for him.\u201d Wei Ruo said.\u201cYes, good.\u201d Wei Yichen agreed, then turned around and walked out the door.He explained a few words to the guards, and the guards let go of Xu Zhengyong.Wei Yichen returned to the door and told Wei Ruo: \u201cI told that person to ask his mother to come tomorrow. That boy is not young anymore, and he cannot easily come in and out of the female relatives in the backyard. You should also pay attention to him when you meet him in the future.\u201d\u201cgood.\u201d\u201cGo and tell your mother about this matter. She won\u2019t stop you from getting in touch with your nanny, but you have to inform mother in advance about the family affairs.\u201d Wei Yichen spoke earnestly.\u201cgood.\u201dWei Yichen looked at Wei Ruoming\u2019s beautiful face, hesitant to speak.\u201cAnything else?\u201dWei Yichen thought for a while and said: \u201cWhen you have free time, spend more time with your mother, and don\u2019t always stay in your own yard. Your mother exempts you from the rules of asking for peace, but you can take the initiative to get closer to your mother, she will like it of.\u201d\u201cWell, it depends on the situation.\u201d\u201cKeep it in your heart.\u201d\u201coh.\u201dWei Ruo didn\u2019t refute or agree, and took Xiumei back to Tingsongyuan.###The next day, when Mother Xu came to Xiaowei\u2019s Mansion again, the guards stopped her and led her to Tingsongyuan.\u201cMiss!\u201dSeeing Wei Ruo, Xu\u2019s mother was excited.After carefully studying Wei Ruo for a while, his eyes turned red.\u201cNurse, why are you crying? Isn\u2019t it a pleasure to see me?\u201d Wei Ruo came forward and wiped away tears for the nanny with a handkerchief.\u201cI\u2019m happy, happy! I said that the He family members are so ungrateful and ungrateful. They are not the real parents of the lady! Now it\u2019s all over, the lady has found her real parents, not only the official master, but also I love Miss! I am happy that Miss has endured all hardships!\u201d\u201cLaugh when you\u2019re happy, but don\u2019t cry.\u201d Wei Ruo said.\u201cOkay, I won\u2019t cry, I won\u2019t cry.\u201dWei Ruo helped the nanny wipe away her tears and eased her emotions.\u201cLook at me, I\u2019m so busy crying, I\u2019ve forgotten my business!\u201dMother Xu quickly opened the package and took out the small wooden box. After opening it, there were neatly arranged small silver ingots inside.(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

According to the young lady\u2019s wishes, the whole numbers are rounded into silver ingots, and the fractions are kept in the account first.\u201dWei Ruo likes heavy silver, but doesn\u2019t like that light silver bill, so every time the nanny gives Wei Ruo the proceeds from the shop, she always comes with heavy silver ingots.In addition to the money, the nanny also brought the store\u2019s account books for the past six months.There is also a basket of dried mushrooms.\u201dXiaoyong was afraid that the lady would not be used to eating here, so he bought some mushrooms that the lady likes before coming here, and dried them. Some of them were fried according to the method that the lady taught before, and sealed in jars.\u201d\u201cNurse, thank you for your hard work, and Uncle Xu and Brother Xiaoyong, I want you to run such a long distance with me.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not hard, it\u2019s hard!\u201d Mother Xu said repeatedly, \u201cI don\u2019t have any hard work. There is a carriage on the way, so I don\u2019t need my legs to drive. I didn\u2019t even take any important things. They are all strong and upright. Yong is busy.\u201dMother Xu\u2019s face is filled with a happy smile.Mother Xu went on to say: \u201cIt is the happiest thing to be able to help Miss. If it weren\u2019t for helping Miss, I don\u2019t know how to live with Dazhuang and Zhengyong! I used to dream that I could Such a day!\u201d\u201cHave you made arrangements in Huaibei Town?\u201d\u201cMiss, don\u2019t worry, I have entrusted the Zhuangzi over there to Laoqian. He has been in the Zhuangzi for many years, so you can rest assured when doing things, and there will be someone watching over the house.\u201d\u201cDid I ask you to ship all the things?\u201d Wei Ruo asked.\u201cIt\u2019s here, all of them are here, three whole truckloads of sweet potatoes!\u201d\u201cOkay, then let me tell you about the next arrangement. I have taken a fancy to Xiaoyang Mountain in the north of the city. You and Uncle Xu go talk about it. If the price is right, you can buy it and plant sweet potatoes; There are fishermen who have lost their livelihood because of Japanese pirates, and farmers who are forced to beg because of poor harvests. You and Uncle Xu went to investigate and investigate. If you have a good character and are willing to work hard, you will be hired as long-term workers.\u201d\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll take my family to the north of the city to investigate.\u201d\u201cThen settle yourself down and find a better house in the city. After you settle down, come to the Captain\u2019s Mansion again and tell me the address so that I can contact you later.\u201d\u201cOkay, I see, I\u2019ll do it when I get back.\u201d Mother Xu responded repeatedly.Mother Xu stayed in Tingsongyuan for more than an hour before leaving.Passing by Wei Qingwan\u2019s Wangmei Garden while walking, and seeing the vulgar woman leaving in a hurry, Nanny Li happily said to Wei Qingwan:\u201cMiss, the woman who just passed by is the eldest lady\u2019s nanny. I heard that the nanny\u2019s son was still making trouble at the gate of our school captain\u2019s mansion yesterday. Fortunately, the eldest son stopped it, otherwise there might be some jokes.\u201d .\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s it\u2026it\u2019s good that nothing happened\u2026\u201d Wei Qingwan murmured.###After negotiating with Lizheng of Yueying Village and the elders in the village, Mother Xu talked about the price of one thousand taels of silver.Then the nanny reported the result to Wei Ruo, letting Wei Ruo make up his mind.One thousand taels of silver is not a small sum to Wei Ruo.A few years ago, she wanted to start a career, but she was too young, so she had no choice but to rely on her cleverness to earn some extra money to improve her life in the countryside.I didn\u2019t start building a shop until I was ten years old, but it was also very difficult to start. In such a society, there are no relationships and no dependencies, and it is very strenuous to gain a foothold little by little.Up to now, a total of more than two thousand taels of silver has been saved. One thousand taels of silver is equivalent to taking out half of Wei Ruo\u2019s net worth. If it fails, Wei Ruo\u2019s financial situation will go back two years.Wei Ruo felt that there was no problem, and he could take it directly, so the nanny and Uncle Xu came forward to buy Xiaoyang Mountain at a price of one thousand taels of silver. to allocate.Xu Zhengyong also wandered around the city for a few days, picked out a few unemployed fishermen who fit what Wei Ruo said, and hired them as long-term workers.It was the first time for the employed long-term workers to see sweet potatoes as a crop.It was only after Xu\u2019s father and son explained that this kind of crop has been widely planted in Huaibei Town and has achieved a good harvest.Regarding the origin of this crop, the father and son jointly stated that a ship from Nanyang accidentally brought back a section of potato vine, which was found useful after being planted and cultivated by humans.Immediately afterwards, sweet potatoes were planted on a large scale in Huaibei Town. The father and son of the Xu family, who have rich relevant planting experience, went to battle in person and led the long-term workers to plant.You need to bury the sweet potato in the soil first, wait for it to grow potato vines, and then cut the potato vines for cuttings.The three carts of sweet potatoes they transported from Huaibei Town can produce enough potato vines for cuttings.The long-term workers quickly mastered the essentials of planting and started to get busy.The maintenance cost of growing sweet potatoes on hillsides is much lower than that of cultivating rice terraces.The long-term workers couldn\u2019t help but breathe a sigh of relief. They thought that the employer would hire only a few of them to manage a whole mountain of rice. Just thinking about it would make them tired.At the same time, Mother Xu also found a house to settle in, not too far from the Xiaowei\u2019s Mansion, so it is convenient to come and go.After arranging these things, Mother Xu went to the Captain\u2019s Mansion again, and handed over the contracts signed with the long-term workers and the deed of the house she bought to Wei Ruo.No matter what Wei Ruo said, the nanny still meant the same thing. These properties belonged to Wei Ruo. They helped Wei Ruo to do things, and they just got some wages, and they didn\u2019t want any more.Wei Ruo has one more task for Mother Xu.\u201cNurse, please help me find out about the wasteland in the south of the city. I heard that the pirates are mainly fleeing in the east of the city, and the south of the city is relatively safe.\u201d\u201cThe wasteland in the south of the city? It\u2019s a very barren land, right? The land near the sea can\u2019t grow crops. What you grow will die.\u201d\u201cWell, it should be so. If the land is not barren, it would not be a wasteland.\u201d This is in Wei Ruo\u2019s expectation.\u201cMiss asked what was the wasteland for?\u201d Mother Xu asked puzzled.\u201cGo and ask me first. I may have a way to turn waste into treasure. If I can grow plants on the saline-alkali land, I can save myself the cost of buying common and lower costs, and I can hire more long-term workers to plant them. The plants can also solve the problem of lack of food in Xingshan County and need to buy a lot from other places, so that more people can eat.\u201d\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll ask when I get back.\u201d Although Xu\u2019s mother also felt that planting crops on saline-alkali land was ridiculous, she believed in Wei Ruo unconditionally.Over the years, Miss has broken their cognition time and time again, making many things that they thought impossible to happen possible.(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Bad for your reputation.\u201d\u201cUnderstood, I will pay attention.\u201dIf Wei Ruo didn\u2019t argue, she would have already guessed that such a thing would happen.As a lady of the official family, it would be disgraceful for her to have close contacts with her former nanny all day long.Fortunately, the carrier pigeons have been arranged properly, and most of the things can be communicated through the carrier pigeons, and there is no need for the nanny to go to the school captain\u2019s mansion in person.Yun nodded with satisfaction, and then said to Wei Ruo: \u201cRuo\u2019er, the war has been tense in recent years. The magistrate\u2019s wife organized all the wives and ladies to go to Huafa Temple in the north of the city tomorrow to pray for the soldiers. You go with me.\u201d\u201cDo you have to go?

Why don\u2019t you want to go.\u201d\u201cI like going out, but I don\u2019t like socializing, and I\u2019m not proficient in those things.\u201d Wei Ruo didn\u2019t hide his true thoughts.Let her mediate with such a large group of ladies and ladies, I feel tired just thinking about it.Yun said earnestly, \u201cRuo\u2019er, you are no longer what you used to be, and these interactions are indispensable. What\u2019s more, Wei Niang is telling the magistrate\u2019s wife recently that she wants you to go to the magistrate\u2019s mansion to meet the lady over there just like Wanwan. Let\u2019s study together, this time you go with me so that Madam Zhixian can meet you, know what kind of person you are, and dispel their doubts about you.\u201dYun didn\u2019t say what the specific doubts were, but Wei Ruo knew about it. Naturally, she was worried that she was too vulgar and not qualified to go to school with other girls.\u201cDoes my mother think I can dispel their doubts about me? Are you not afraid that I will behave badly?\u201d Wei Ruo asked.\u201cRuo\u2019er\u2019s performance these days is very good. Although she is not close to knowing the book, she is already very good. My mother is very satisfied. There is only one thing you need to pay attention to. Don\u2019t mention the matter of you and Wanwan\u2019s transfer to the outside world, just say that you are weak. She has been raised in the country all this time, but she just came back to her parents recently. This is good for you and Wanwan.\u201d Yun said with emotion.\u201cDo you have to go?\u201d\u201cI have to go.\u201d Yun\u2019s attitude was firm, \u201cRuo\u2019er, be obedient, you will have to get used to these things sooner or later.\u201dWei Ruo sighed, and reluctantly accepted the arrangement: \u201cI see.\u201dIn the original book, Yun didn\u2019t want the original owner to go at first, it was the original owner who begged to go, and Yun took her because she was so noisy that he couldn\u2019t help it.Now it\u2019s the other way around when it comes to her, she doesn\u2019t want to go, but Yun wants her to go instead.Wei Ruo thought it was a little funny, what is the problem? Why did the final result develop in the direction of the original plot?Wei Ruo remembered that in the original book, the blessing this time was a big drama.First of all, as the female supporting role, during this trip, she became the laughing stock of all the ladies and ladies because of her unsatisfactory behavior, which also made Yun\u2019s lose face.Secondly, as the heroine, Wei Qingwan met the heroine for the first time in Fahua Temple where she prayed.Wei Ruo thought about it and went back to Songyuan.\u201cXiumei, look in the luggage we brought. Are there any dried sweet potatoes and sweet potato chips?\u201dXiumei immediately went to the side room to find out the dried sweet potatoes and sweet potato chips, and brought a small bag of each.\u201cMiss, are you hungry?\u201d\u201cNo, my mother asked me to go out with her to burn incense and pray for blessings in Fahua Temple tomorrow. I plan to take some with me. Help me find two satin brocade bags with drawstrings around the mouth.\u201d\u201cMiss, are you afraid that you will be hungry on the way?\u201d Xiumei asked curiously.\u201cNo, I have other plans.\u201dWei Ruo smiled slyly.Since going out can\u2019t be avoided, let\u2019s go, but this trip can\u2019t be in vain, there must be some rewards.###Soon, Wei Qingwan, who was looking at Meiyuan, heard the news that Wei Ruo was going to Fahua Temple with Yun.\u201cDid the mother ask to take my sister?\u201d Wei Qingwan asked Nanny Li.\u201cYes, Madam took the initiative to mention that the eldest lady will go out sooner or later. Tomorrow is a good time.\u201d\u201cSo fast\u2026\u201d Wei Qingwan lowered her head in a low voice.\u201cMiss, don\u2019t be sad, this will happen sooner or later.\u201d Nanny Li persuaded.\u201cI knew it would be sooner or later, but I didn\u2019t expect it to be so early\u2026\u201d Wei Qingwan looked disappointed.My mother\u2019s initiative to ask Wei Ruo to go is different from Wei Ruo\u2019s begging to go. The mother\u2019s initiative means that the mother has approved Wei Ruo and feels that Wei Ruo meets the norms of everyone\u2019s lady.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, miss, this may not be a good thing for the eldest lady. In front of so many wives and ladies, if the eldest lady makes a mistake and makes a fool of herself, it will become a joke of the entire Xingshan County.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want my sister to make a fool of herself, I just don\u2019t want to\u2026\u201d Wei Qingwan murmured.\u201cI understand what Missy is thinking, but whether Missy will make mistakes in front of everyone is not up to you, Missy, but her own quality. Some things will happen regardless of whether Missy thinks about it or not.\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s possible, I still hope that she will be fine tomorrow, and don\u2019t make mistakes and lose the face of the Captain\u2019s Mansion.\u201d Wei Qingwan murmured.\u201cMiss, you are still too kind.\u201d Nanny Li said helplessly.\u201cAs long as my mother doesn\u2019t get tired of me, I don\u2019t mind what my sister does.\u201d\u201cNo, Madam loves you the most.\u201dAfter some comfort from Nanny Li, Wei Qingwan\u2019s mood improved a lot.After drinking the calming tea, he fell asleep.###The next day, Wei Ruo dressed up at Yun\u2019s request.A light yellow tube top, a water green outer shirt, and a dark green skirt. Another one of the most popular buns nowadays. There is a bit of agility in the freshness.Having been in Wei Mansion for so long, this is the first time that Wei Ruo has dressed up decently, wearing clothes that she thinks are lighter, and her hair is also tied into a country woman\u2019s bun for easy work.Mr. Yun asked her to change into the clothes she had prepared several times, but Wei Ruo declined on the grounds that the linen clothes were light and easy to move around.Yun Shi looked at Wei Ruo who was dressed up, and showed a satisfied smile: \u201cRuoer\u2019s dress is really good-looking.\u201dYun Shi noticed the exquisite food box in Wei Ruo\u2019er\u2019s hand again, and asked, \u201cWhat is Ruo\u2019er holding?\u201d(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

In case any lady from another family is hungry, I can share some with them.\u201dHearing Wei Ruo\u2019s explanation, and seeing that Wei Ruo had prepared an exquisite and beautiful food box, even if it was taken out, it would not be embarrassing, so she didn\u2019t say anything else, and only told her to hand over the food box to her maid, Cui Cui, when she went up the mountain. holding the screen.In order to control the number of people going out this time, except for the accompanying coachman and guards, only Yun brought Cuiping, and Wei Ruo and Wei Qingwan did not bring maids.Wei Qingwan also arrived at the door, and saw Wei Ruo who had been well-dressed at a glance. Surprise flashed in her eyes at that moment, but she quickly looked away.Wei Ruo didn\u2019t pay attention to Wei Qingwan, all she could think about was farming to make money.Absently followed Yun into the carriage, sitting in the carriage, Wei Ruo looked out through the window, his thoughts flew far away.Yunshi looked at her absent-minded look, but didn\u2019t say anything.Turning to Wei Qingwan, she said, \u201cWanwan, today I will go up the mountain on foot to offer incense and pray for blessings at Fahua Temple. Mother is worried that your health will not be able to bear it.\u201d\u201cMother, don\u2019t worry, no matter whether I can finish the walk or not, I will try my best to walk. Every step is a step. I also want to pray for my father and all the soldiers. I hope they can win a big victory every time they fight against the Japanese pirates, and they will be safe and sound.\u201d I also hope that the Japanese pirates can be repelled as soon as possible, and peace can be restored to Xingshan County.\u201d\u201cWell, your father will be very happy to know that you have such a heart.\u201d\u201cDaddy and the soldiers defended the country, fought **** battles, shed blood and sweat, and all I can do is to go up the mountain to pray for blessings. What\u2019s the point of being a little tired? It\u2019s nothing compared to Daddy and the others.\u201dSeeing Wei Qingwan\u2019s grateful and sensible appearance, Yun couldn\u2019t help showing a kind smile, with unusually gentle eyes.My daughter is well-educated, gentle and pleasant, filial and sensible, and I really can\u2019t fault it at all.Thinking of seeing the wives again soon, Yun\u2019s mood became particularly good, because whenever such an occasion, Wanwan must be the one who receives the most praise.Everyone has vanity, and Yun\u2019s is no exception. It is undoubtedly a happy thing for a daughter he raised to be praised.But things might be a little different today\u2026Yunshi looked at Wei Ruo who was lying on the window, with a somewhat worried expression. She doesn\u2019t ask Ruo\u2019er to be as good as Wanwan and be praised by others, but only asks her not to be criticized.Although when Wei Ruo asked her yesterday, she firmly said that she believed her, but when it came time to take it out, she still couldn\u2019t help worrying.The horse-drawn carriage departed from Xiaowei\u2019s Mansion and headed towards the north of the city. The most part of the road ahead was the old road that Wei Ruo used to inspect the city last time.After leaving the city, the carriage turned into a country road and headed towards Xianmu Mountain along the road.At the foot of the mountain, the carriage stopped, Yun Shi and Wei Qingwan both got out of the carriage, and Wei Ruocai came down slowly.When they arrived, the magistrate\u2019s wife, the county magistrate\u2019s wife, the head secretary\u2019s wife, and the ladies from other families had all arrived.Everyone is waiting at the foot of the mountain.Seeing the arrival of the Wei family, everyone turned their attention to it, because they heard that the Wei family had recently had a daughter.Everyone was more or less curious about Wei Ruo who had just been taken back to the Wei family.Wei Ruo felt many eyes on him as soon as he got out of the car.Wei Ruo showed them openly, without shyness or dodging.Because they know that this is unavoidable, and their curiosity must always be satisfied.The wives and ladies who looked at Wei Ruo found that Wei Ruo was not what they expected. His slim figure and delicate and smooth skin were not even comparable to those daughters who had been raised in deep boudoirs for many years.If the Wei family didn\u2019t tell them, they would never have thought that Wei Ruo had been living in the countryside before.She and Wei Qingwan stood there, one was soft and the other was pretty, in terms of appearance alone, it really compared the other daughters who came today.Some people are surprised and some are disappointed.The idea of wanting to see the Wei family\u2019s jokes seems to be in vain.Madam Zhixian brought her daughter Qian Caisang over to say hello to the Yun family: \u201cMadam Wei, you are really enviable. The two daughters stand out from each other. Will there be a way for others to survive?\u201dMrs. Yun hurriedly laughed and said, \u201cMadam Qian, please don\u2019t bury me. How can my two daughters compare with Ling Ai? I have heard Wanwan say that even Mr. Fu praised Ling Ai\u2019s poems again and again. Mr. Fu is extremely Don\u2019t praise people for their good poetry, Miss Qian is the only one!\u201dMr. Fu is the most famous female gentleman in Xingshan County, and now he is teaching several girls to read in the magistrate\u2019s mansion.Madam Qian smiled all over her face: \u201cShe is just a little clever!\u201dShe said that her daughter was just a little clever, but the smile on her face was genuine, it could be seen that Yun\u2019s words reached her heart.Immediately afterwards, the wife of the county magistrate and the wife of the head secretary also came up to greet Yun.Mr. Yun looked around, and saw that several familiar wives were there.So he asked the magistrate\u2019s wife who hosted today\u2019s event: \u201cMadam Qian, who are we waiting for?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the wife and daughter of the Xie family in the north of the city.\u201d Madam Qian replied.The Xie family is a well-known farming and studying family in Taizhou Prefecture. The family has produced two Jinshi in the past 20 years.Mrs. Xie\u2019s father-in-law is one of them. Now he is working in the middle of the capital, he is a fifth-rank official, and he heard that he has been appreciated by the emperor recently, so he is likely to be promoted to a fourth-rank imperial doctor.As soon as they heard that they were waiting for Xie\u2019s family, everyone dropped their opinions.After a while, the Xie family\u2019s carriage also arrived, and two people got off the carriage one after another, it was Mrs. Xie\u2019s family and Miss Xie Ying.Different from the other girls who got off the car with the help of the maid, Xie Ying jumped off directly.Such a bold move is unique among many ladies today.\u201cBe careful.\u201d Mrs. Xie was doting and helpless, her daughter was really spoiled by her father-in-law and husband.Xie Ying has already run up.Mrs. Xie came forward and greeted Mrs. Yun and Mrs. Zhixian: \u201cI kept you waiting for a long time, my family Ying\u2019er was too messy, and she was blinded by a juggler on the way, so she refused to leave no matter what.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay, it\u2019s okay, the child is still young, it\u2019s normal to have some curiosity.\u201d Madam Qian said with a smile.Mrs. Xie looked at Wei Ruo. The others were all familiar faces. They had met countless times, but Wei Ruo saw them for the first time today.Madam Xie said with a smile: \u201cMiss Wei was born so delicate and lovely, she is indeed Madam Wei\u2019s daughter, she has followed Mrs. Wei and Mrs. Wei.\u201d(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This child has suffered a lot in recent years. I don\u2019t ask her to be excellent. I just hope that she can live in peace and stability in the future.\u201dAfter a few people greeted each other, seeing that everyone had arrived, the magistrate\u2019s wife announced the departure.The position when starting out is also very particular, Mrs. Xie and Ms. Xie are at the front, followed by Mrs. Yun, Wei Ruo, and Wei Qingwan, then Mrs. Qian and Ms. Qian, and then the county magistrate, chief secretary and others. The wife of a well-known local family in Xingshan County.Among the wives, according to the rank of their husbands, the Yun family is the highest. The county magistrate is the seventh rank, and Wei Mingting is the sixth rank.But Wei Mingting\u2019s current situation is well known to everyone, and the Xie family is in the limelight, so it is Mrs. Xie who is at the forefront.Because the purpose of today\u2019s trip is to pray for blessings, sincerity is the most important thing, so at the suggestion of Mrs. Zhixian, everyone walked up the mountain and walked up the 999 steps from the foot of the mountain to the front of the temple.Wei Ruo followed Yun\u2019s, neither fast nor slow, she could go as fast as the others, and when the others stopped to rest, she also stopped to rest.Try not to stand out, not to be outstanding, not to be conspicuous and not to cause trouble.The fastest walker was Xie Ying, striding forward, leaving behind the others by at least 20 or 30 steps, Madam Xie couldn\u2019t even shout.The rest of the people are not walking fast, and they have to stop and take a rest after walking for a while.It took more than half an hour to stop and go like this, and finally everyone came to the gate of Fahua Temple.Abbot has brought a group of disciples to greet him at the door.After exchanging a few words with the abbot, everyone entered the temple.Because the magistrate\u2019s wife had already agreed with the presiding abbot that Fahua Temple does not accept other pilgrims today, but only their female relatives, so the temple is very empty and no one disturbs them.After entering the main hall, everyone began to burn incense and kneel down.Wei Ruo mixed in the crowd and also lit a stick of incense.After kneeling on the futon and listening to the scriptures, half a day passed.At noon, everyone should stay in the temple to eat vegetarian food.While waiting for the fast meal, everyone sat in the fasting hall and drank the tea provided by the temple.Climbing the nine hundred and ninety-nine steps exhausted my energy, and it was noon again, so everyone was a little hungry.But Fahua Temple has a strict fasting time, and meals must be served at noon. Naturally, everyone can\u2019t break the rules and can only wait in the fasting hall.At this time, Wei Ruo took out the dried sweet potatoes she had prepared and distributed them to everyone for a taste.Seeing what Wei Ruo took out, all the female relatives showed curious and puzzled expressions, because they had never seen this thing before.After seeing what Wei Ruo took out, Yun couldn\u2019t help becoming nervous.She originally thought that Wei Ruo brought common pastries, but now everyone is really hungry, so it\u2019s okay for her to share the pastries with everyone.It turned out that the things she took out were unknown to everyone, and they couldn\u2019t help worrying.It was too late for Yun to stop Wei Ruo, and everything was in the hands of the wives and ladies.Wei Qingwan looked at Wei Ruo and then at the things she took out, feeling as puzzled as the others. But she didn\u2019t make a sound, she sat beside Yun Shi, quietly watching everyone\u2019s reaction.\u201cMiss Wei, what is this?\u201d Madam Qian was the first to ask.\u201cThis is called dried sweet potato, and it is made from a plant called sweet potato.\u201d Wei Ruo patiently explained.\u201cSweet potato? What crop is that?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a new crop, which was accidentally brought by a merchant ship from Nanyang. It has already been planted in Huzhou Prefecture, and many farmers there have already started planting it.\u201d\u201cIs there such a thing?\u201d Madam Qian looked at the red brick-colored, crystal-clear dried sweet potatoes in her hand, with doubts in surprise.The other female relatives were equally curious.Wei Ruo took a piece of dried sweet potato and ate it in front of everyone.With Wei Ruo taking the lead, Madam Qian also took a tentative sip.Dried sweet potatoes are crystal clear, soft and sweet. Although there are no complicated cooking methods, they retain the unique taste of sweet potatoes.Seeing this, other people also began to try the new type of \u201cpastry\u201d brought by Wei Ruo.\u201cIt tastes good.\u201d Madam Qian praised.Immediately afterwards, other female family members also issued the same praise.\u201cI have another snack made from sweet potatoes, try it too.\u201dWei Ruo took out another brocade bag from the food box, opened the drawstring on it, and let the female relatives see the contents clearly.This is sweet potato chips. After peeling and steaming the sweet potatoes, mash them into mashed potatoes, add cooked sesame seeds and mix well, then spread it on the mold with a thin layer, then put it in the sun for a few days, and wait for it to dry. Finally, cut into small pieces to obtain sweet potato chips whose shape and mouthfeel are exactly like potato chips.The former is soft, glutinous and sweet, while the latter is very crispy, and the teeth are broken when touched lightly, but the fragrance is stronger.\u201cIs this also made of the sweet potato you just mentioned?\u201d Mrs. Xie asked curiously.\u201cYes, it\u2019s made from sweet potatoes, but the method of making it is different.\u201d Wei Ruo explained.After the introduction, Wei Ruo distributed the sweet potato chips to everyone for tasting.With the experience of dried sweet potatoes, everyone did not hesitate this time, and tasted it after getting it.\u201cThis tastes pretty good too.\u201d Mrs. Qian commented.\u201cI like this better, it\u2019s fragrant and crunchy.\u201d Xie Ying, who had been silent all this time, suddenly spoke up, expressing her love for sweet potato chips.Mrs. Xie smiled: \u201cMy Yingying seldom says what kind of food she likes, and Ms. Wei\u2019s sweet potato chips really suit my Yingying\u2019s appetite.\u201dWith Mrs. Qian and Mrs. Xie\u2019s words, other female relatives also praised Wei Ruo\u2019s two sweet potato products.And their approval is exactly what Wei Ruo wants.Her sweet potatoes have been planted and will be sold locally when they are ripe.To sell something that has not been seen in a place, you must first do a good job of marketing and do a good job in the market foundation.Wei Ruo brought dried sweet potatoes and sweet potato chips for everyone to eat today, for this purpose.As long as these ladies representing the noble class in Xingshan County approve this kind of food, there will be no market for her sweet potatoes when they hit the market.Yun\u2019s hanging heart also fell with the praise of everyone.Wei Qingwan felt a little uncomfortable, and she didn\u2019t know how to describe this feeling. She just felt that something was stuck in her chest, making her a little out of breath.While chatting and laughing, the monks from the temple delivered the fasting meal. After everyone had the fasting meal together, several wives went to the hall to chant scriptures and pray for blessings with the abbot.Because the chanting process is very boring, only the wives are arranged, and the girls walk around the temple by themselves.After half a day of restraint, I was finally free to move around, and a few people I knew formed a group to find a place to play.Wei Ruo planned to find a corner by himself, Wei Qingwan followed, \u201cWhere does sister want to go?\u201dSweet potato is another name for sweet potato.I would make sweet potato chips at home when I was a child, but now I do less.Finally, please recommend tickets~(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

After getting rid of Wei Qingwan, Wei Ruo started to find a way.First of all, the back is the meditation room, which is absolutely not a place to go. At this time, the male protagonist is living in the back mountain meditation room of Fahua Temple.Today, in order to receive all the female relatives, Fahua Temple did not receive other pilgrims, except for the male master who lived in the meditation room in the back mountain. He had already lived in a few days ago, and his status was special. The temple did not inform him in advance to keep it secret. Madam Qian and others.Generally speaking, the meditation room is in the back mountain, some distance away from the main temple, and it is unlikely that the female relatives who come to the temple will come across it.But the author couldn\u2019t hold back and wanted the heroine and the hero to meet, and then she, the cannon fodder female supporting role, played a powerful role in fueling the flames.The original owner lost face in front of everyone because of his poor performance before, and heard other people praise Wei Qingwan. There is a contrast and hurt.In addition, the original owner felt that what Wei Qingwan had now belonged to her, and her anger doubled. So dazzled by jealousy and anger, she deliberately took Wei Qingwan to the back mountain, planning to find a secluded place to take revenge on her.Then he was rescued by the male protagonist who lived in the Houshan Temple. The hero saved the beauty, the gifted scholar and the beautiful woman, and a good story unfolded.How about this plot? It can only be said that as a cannon fodder female supporting role, she is still very qualified, and the means of revenge are clumsy and pale.Now, Wei Ruo has two things to do:One is to avoid Wei Qingwan, not to be with her, she will not hurt Wei Qingwan subjectively, but just in case the power of the plot will add fuel to the flames, she should simply not even see her people.The second is to avoid the male protagonist. In the original book, the original protagonist actually died at the hands of the male protagonist. Wei Qingwan, as the little white flower female protagonist, always has a soft-hearted image, but the male protagonist is not. For the female supporting role who tried to hurt his sweetheart, He was never merciful.Wei Ruo walked around, and finally chose to sit under a ginkgo tree behind the Guanyin Hall.The trunk of the ginkgo tree is so thick that several Wei Ruo can\u2019t hug it together. In spring, the ginkgo is covered with green fan-like leaves, and the small fans are covered with branches, which is very beautiful.Wei Ruo sat down with his back against the trunk of the ginkgo tree, with his eyes closed and rested.The sun is just right, the shade under the tree is cool, and the breeze is blowing, just right for a nap.\u201cWhat are you doing here alone?\u201dA voice suddenly appeared, interrupting Wei Ruo\u2019s trance.\u201cIn a daze.\u201d Wei Ruo glanced at Xie Ying, then continued to close her eyes.\u201cAren\u2019t you going to play with them?\u201d Xie Ying asked.\u201cNo play, I\u2019m not interested in what they talk about.\u201d\u201cThen what are you interested in?\u201d Xie Ying asked again.One question after another, Wei Ruo had to open his eyes to look at Xie Ying.The little girl is about the same size as her current body, with a delicate and round face, and a heroic look between her brows.\u201cWhy is Ms. Xie so curious about me?\u201d Wei Ruo wondered, this Ms. Xie\u2019s family should be a favorite, why didn\u2019t she play with others, instead came chasing her to ask questions.\u201cNo, I am not interested in you, I am interested in this place where you are sitting now.\u201d\u201cWhere do I sit?\u201d\u201cThis ginkgo tree is my fancy hiding place, and it is taken by you. If you don\u2019t like this place very much, can you give me this place, I want to stay here alone for a while, of course if you If you can promise me not to quarrel with me, I can also allow you to stay here.\u201dIt turned out to be a fellow!Wei Ruo smiled and said, \u201cI really like staying here too. I won\u2019t disturb you. Let\u2019s sleep on one side. Look at the trunk of this ginkgo tree. You can\u2019t see it while sleeping alone.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s fine.\u201d Xie Ying accepted Wei Ruo\u2019s proposal, and sat down on the other side of the ginkgo tree.The two were separated by the tree trunk, one by one side, and no one disturbed the other.After an unknown amount of time, a sudden noise came, waking up two people who were sneaking under the ginkgo tree.Wei Ruo and Xie Ying both raised their heads, then poked their heads out and glanced at each other.The expressions are almost the same, with a bit of hazyness just waking up, and a little hesitation.Hesitating whether to go or not.\u201cWhat did you say happened over there?\u201d Xie Ying asked Wei Ruo.\u201cDo you think we should go there?\u201d Wei Ruo asked Xie Ying.\u201cOr, just lie down. Even if something happens, it shouldn\u2019t be the two of us.\u201d Xie Ying said.\u201cLie down.\u201d Wei Ruo agreed.The thoughts of the two were surprisingly the same, and they both wanted to hide away, so they both lay back.Wei Ruo and Xie Ying leaned against the ginkgo tree and slept comfortably, but they didn\u2019t know that there was already a mess ahead.The people who had the accident were Wei Qingwan and Miss Zhixian Qian Zhilan.After being thrown away by Wei Ruo, Wei Qingwan found Qian Zhilan, and the two had a good time on weekdays.As the county magistrate, Qian Zhilan doesn\u2019t like the ladies of other families in Xingshan County very much, so all the masters and county magistrates are her father\u2019s subordinates, only Wei Qingwan\u2019s family\u2019s official position is similar to her father\u2019s.Xie Ying likes her, but Xie Ying doesn\u2019t like her and doesn\u2019t play with her.Wei Qingwan and Qian Zhilan accompanied each other to enjoy the scenery in the temple. At first, they just walked inside the temple, but the Fahua Temple in Xingshan County was only so big, and they finished walking in a short while.At this time, Qian Zhilan found a quiet path at the small gate on the west side of the temple, so she dragged Wei Qingwan along it.After walking for a while, the two found a meditation room in front of them. There were many flowers and trees in front of the meditation room, and the scenery was pleasant.It corresponds to the scene described in that poem: the winding path leads to a secluded place, and the meditation room has deep flowers and trees.Qian Zhilan dragged Wei Qingwan to the meditation room.When they wanted to approach, they were scolded by a man dressed as a servant, telling them that they were not allowed to approach here.Qian Zhilan revealed her identity, and in turn warned the other party that Fahua Temple was reserved by them today, and no one else was allowed to enter, and asked the other party to leave quickly.But the other party ignored her at all, so Qian Zhilan took Wei Qingwan back to find her mother, and told her about finding idlers in the meditation room behind.Mrs. Qian heard from her daughter that there was a suspicious man sneaking around, so she hurriedly sent people to search near the meditation room, and there was a lot of commotion.The abbot of the temple hurried over to stop Madam Qian\u2019s behavior after learning about it, and revealed a shocking thing to everyone.(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 22": "Chapter 22 - Why didn't you accompany WanwanPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 22 Why Didn\u2019t You Accompany WanwanThe abbot revealed that there was a noble person living in the meditation room, and what Qian Zhilan and Wei Qingwan met was that person\u2019s entourage.Although he didn\u2019t directly say the man\u2019s identity, the abbot mentioned the word Chu.Chu is the surname of the current dynasty. When it comes to this, what else can everyone not understand?Knowing that their daughter had offended the royal relatives, Mrs. Qian and Yun became nervous.Especially Yun\u2019s, her husband was already facing the risk of being dismissed because of his disadvantage in fighting against the Japanese. If he offends the nobleman again at this critical juncture, I\u2019m afraid it will be hard to protect the black hat!After thinking about it, Mrs. Qian severely reprimanded her daughter in front of everyone, blaming her for acting recklessly.Qian Zhilan was favored at home on weekdays, and was even more in front of others. After being reprimanded by Madam Qian, she was angry and wronged. In this case, she could only shrink her neck and listen obediently.Madam Qian spoke up, and Yun Shi couldn\u2019t keep quiet, so she also reprimanded Wei Qingwan.Wei Qingwan felt extremely wronged, she just walked with Qian Zhilan, why did she offend the nobleman?What\u2019s more, the person who wanted to go to the meditation room was Qian Zhilan, and the person who clashed with the nobleman\u2019s attendant was also Qian Zhilan, she obviously didn\u2019t do anything!Wei Ruo and Xie Ying did not return to the Zhaitang until the matter subsided.Hearing what happened from other people, Wei Ruo was surprised.Unexpectedly, Wei Qingwan still went to the Houshan meditation room without her female partner as a demon.It\u2019s just that the people who went there were different, the things that happened were different, and the results were also different.In the original book, it was she who was sent back by the male lead\u2019s attendants and scolded by Yun Shi. Wei Qingwan was escorted back by the male lead, without alarming anyone, and did not let others know about their meeting.Could it be that the master who lived in the Buddhist monastery was not emotional after seeing Wei Qingwan\u2019s face like a lotus?Or, without being bullied by her, being weak and helpless, can\u2019t arouse the big pig\u2019s hooves\u2019 desire for protection?These are just Wei Ruo\u2019s conjectures in just a few seconds. Wei Ruo has no way of knowing what the male lead in the Zen room thinks for the time being.Regarding Wei Qingwan being scolded, Wei Ruo is not happy or unhappy, as long as the matter does not have anything to do with her, she will not be held responsible if she does not do bad things. As for how men and women mainly develop their love stories, it has nothing to do with her.Wei Qingwan stood behind Yun with her head bowed. When she heard Wei Ruo\u2019s voice, she raised her head and took a look. After seeing Wei Ruo\u2019s refreshed, cheerful and agile appearance, she felt even more depressed.So he lowered his head again.Because of this accident, everyone lost their thoughts of praying for blessings. After finishing today\u2019s trip in a hurry, everyone went down the mountain and returned to their respective mansions.On the way back, Yun looked at the two daughters in front of him with complicated emotions.I thought it was Ruo\u2019er who might make a fool of herself today, but I didn\u2019t expect it to be the other way around.Wei Qingwan seemed to sense Yun\u2019s disappointment in herself, and the tears that she had endured for a long time fell down patter.Mr. Yun saw her, and hurriedly comforted her: \u201cDon\u2019t cry, don\u2019t cry, mother\u2019s heart hurts like a knife when you cry.\u201d\u201cMother, I really didn\u2019t do anything or say anything\u2026\u201d Wei Qingwan argued aggrievedly.\u201cMother knows, mother knows\u2026 It\u2019s just that under such circumstances, mother can\u2019t blame Miss Qian.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to be with my sister today, but my sister doesn\u2019t want me to be with her. She ran away and I couldn\u2019t catch up. I met Zhilan when I was looking for my sister. go with her\u2026\u201dWen Yan Yun looked at Wei Ruo who was sitting in the corner of the carriage.\u201cRuo\u2019er, why don\u2019t you want to be with Wanwan?\u201dThere was a bit more blame in the tone, after all, if Wei Ruo and Wei Qingwan were together, there would be nothing to do later, and Wei Qingwan would not have to suffer from this innocent disaster.Wei Ruo: \u201cI\u2019m not familiar with these ladies. I don\u2019t know how to read and write, and I can\u2019t play games between them. I don\u2019t want to lose the face of the Wei family. But my sister is familiar with them, so I can\u2019t do that.\u201d Selfish, only thinking about myself, dragging my sister to prevent her from playing with them. As for why my sister met Miss Qian and why such a thing happened, I didn\u2019t expect it either.\u201dSpeaking of which, Wei Ruo sighed: \u201cIf I had known this, it would be better if I didn\u2019t come today. Maybe if I didn\u2019t come, my sister\u2019s playmate today wouldn\u2019t be Ms. Qian, right? It might be someone else. Which of them plays the best?\u201dYun Shi was startled\u2026 If Wei didn\u2019t come, the best person with Wanwan would still be Miss Qian.Thinking about it this way, it seems inappropriate to abduct the matter of Wanwan and Miss Qian\u2019s family going to the back mountain together to Ruoer.So Yun changed his words: \u201cMother didn\u2019t mean to blame you, Mother was just afraid that you would not want to be with your sister because of other things.\u201d\u201cWell, I know Mother cares about us.\u201d Wei Ruo agreed.Wei Qingwan cried all the way, and stopped crying when she was almost home.When I returned to Wang Meiyuan, I heard that Wei Qingwan had been wronged, so both Wei Yichen and Wei Yilin came to visit her.Seeing Wei Yichen and Wei Yilin, the tears that Wei Qingwan had just put away fell again.After learning the ins and outs of the matter, Wei Yichen also felt that Wei Qingwan was wronged.It was Miss Qian who caused the trouble. She didn\u2019t speak up, but she was implicated for no reason.Wei Yilin said angrily: \u201cThat Wei\u2026why didn\u2019t that eldest sister come with you? If she was with you, wouldn\u2019t this matter happen?\u201dWei Qingwan just sobbed and didn\u2019t speak.Wei Yichen said: \u201cYilin, Wanwan is innocent at this time, but Ruoer is equally innocent. If she doesn\u2019t go today, won\u2019t the incident still happen? How can you blame it on her?\u201d\u201cBut my sister has taken the initiative to play with her, how can she leave her sister alone?\u201d Wei Yilin asked back.\u201cRuo\u2019er may not be used to it yet. Today is the first time she goes out with her mother. You can\u2019t demand so much of her.\u201d Wei Yichen explained.Wei Yilin lowered his head and stopped talking.Wei Yichen said to Wei Qingwan again: \u201cDon\u2019t be sad, Wanwan. My mother knows you are innocent in this matter. She said in front of outsiders that you are only hindering the Qian family. You don\u2019t have to take this matter to heart.\u201dWei Qingwan shook her head: \u201cBrother, I am not sad because I have been wronged, I am worried that because of this matter, I will offend the nobleman and implicate my father\u2026 My parents treat me so well, if I hurt my parents, I will definitely not forgive me my own.\u201dWei Yichen felt distressed: \u201cDon\u2019t worry Wanwan, nothing will happen. If something happens, it\u2019s not your fault. It can only be said that fate tricks people.\u201d\u201cYes, yes, brother is right, sister, you must not blame yourself for this kind of thing.\u201d Wei Yilin seconded.Wei Qingwan twitched again for a while before holding it back.Wei Yichen and Wei Yilin stayed with Wei Qingwan for a while, and when they saw that her expression had calmed down, they left.(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 23": "Chapter 23 - Wasteland in the south of the cityPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 23 Wasteland in the south of the cityRegarding the wasteland in the south of the city, the nanny wrote back to Wei Ruo, telling Wei Ruo that the wasteland in the south of the city belongs to the land without an owner, and the law belongs to the government. If the people want to cultivate it, they must get the approval of the government.In the past, the magistrates of Xingshan County were not very stuck in the matter of reclamation of ordinary wasteland. The wasteland in the south of the city is land that most people don\u2019t want. They have no reason not to agree to plant land that does not bear any crops.However, now is a special period, and Japanese pirates are rampant. Although the south of the city is less likely to be disturbed by Japanese pirates due to its external terrain advantages, which is a hundred times better than the east of the city, it is still a bit risky after all. For this reason, the government does not allow ordinary people to go out of the south gate.It is useless for ordinary people to take that piece of land, but the government does not agree.Ordinary people can\u2019t do it, so if it\u2019s the Captain\u2019s Mansion, is there such a possibility?Although Wei Ruo didn\u2019t want to have too much involvement with the Captain\u2019s Mansion in these matters, the skinny beggar he saw on the street that day appeared in his mind from time to time.And what she learned about the situation in Xingshan County these days, natural disasters and man-made disasters may not have much impact on the Xiaowei Mansion, but the people living at the bottom are already suffering unspeakably.She knows that if things come to fruition, she can help some people within her ability, although not all, but at least one can help one, and one can live one, and that is a fresh human life!And she herself really wants to complete the improvement experiment on saline-alkali land.After thinking about it again and again, Wei Ruo came to Cangyun Garden where the Yun family lived.Yun just finished checking last month\u2019s account books with the store manager.The shopkeeper went out with his front foot, and Wei Ruo came in with his back foot.\u201cWhy is Ruo\u2019er here? Wait a minute, mother will deal with these account books first.\u201d Yun didn\u2019t specifically avoid Wei Ruo, whether it was because Wei Ruo was her daughter or because she felt that Wei Ruo couldn\u2019t understand the account books.Wei Ruo was not in a hurry, and stood by for a while looking at the account books in Yun\u2019s hands.After reading a few pages, Wei Ruo found that the shop was in a state of loss.It can be seen that the economic situation of the Wei family has been really bad in the past two years. Not only the crops in the village are in short supply, but the income of the shop is also not ideal.After a while, Yun finished reading the last account books, put them aside, and then dragged Wei Ruo to sit on the next step.\u201cDid Ruo\u2019er come to see mother for something?\u201d Yun asked.Wei Ruo has been back to Wei\u2019s house for more than a month, and this is the second time he came to see him. The first time was because he wanted to visit Zhuangzi in the north of the city.So Yun can conclude that Wei Ruo came to him today for something.\u201cMother, I heard that Zhuangzi\u2019s harvest in the past two years has not been very good, and the grain produced is not enough for the family to eat.\u201d Wei Ruo asked.Yun was obviously taken aback when he heard that, obviously he didn\u2019t expect Wei Ruo to say that.Sighed slightly, he said: \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have worried about this matter, and I don\u2019t know which servant has the most mouths. Mother must punish him properly.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not that the servant is talking too much, but I saw it when I went to the north of the city that time.\u201d Wei Ruo said.\u201cOh, that\u2019s right, you should understand this.\u201d Yun said.The child grew up in the countryside, and what he has been exposed to most every day is farming. It is understandable that he knows more than the average lady who is raised in a deep boudoir.Yun explained: \u201cIt\u2019s not our family\u2019s business. It\u2019s the entire Xingshan County, and even the entire Taizhou Prefecture. The harvest in the past two years has not been very good. Our Zhuangzi in Xingshan County is no exception.\u201d\u201cBut Ruo\u2019er, don\u2019t worry too much. Our family is not that bad. With your father\u2019s salary and some savings in the family, life is a bit difficult, but it\u2019s not too bad. It\u2019s just that the people are suffering. It\u2019s not easy for the Japanese pirates to make trouble these years, and the bad age makes it even worse, and these days are getting sadder every day.\u201dSeeing that the groundwork was almost done, Wei Ruo asked about the saline-alkali land in the south of the city.\u201cMother, the wasteland in the south of the city is still empty. If it can be planted, it should be able to solve the problem of feeding many people.\u201dYun smiled and shook his head: \u201cRuoer, it\u2019s a good thing for you to think about your family, but the wasteland outside the city is so desolate that not a few weeds can grow, because the soil there is really bad, and nothing can survive.\u201d\u201cMother, when I was in Mojiashan, there was an old woman who taught me how to grow crops on the barren and desolate land. Maybe it can be applied to the wasteland in the south of the city.\u201d\u201cThe conditions of different barren lands are different. Xingshan County is close to the sea. As the old people know, crops cannot be grown on land close to the sea. This is different from the land you had in Mojiazha.\u201d\u201cMaybe that method will work too? Mother, if we can grow crops on the barren land, we can feed a lot of people. It is also a meritorious achievement, and it will also be of great use to my father\u2019s career. \u201cWhen Wei Mingting\u2019s official career was mentioned, Yun\u2019s expression changed.But after thinking for a while, I still feel that the feasibility is not high.\u201cRuoer, your idea is very good, but this matter is really not that simple\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s really not easy, but mother, even if we fail, we have nothing to lose, and we will let everyone know that our Wei family is working hard for everyone to eat, which is another gain.\u201d Wei Ruo analyzed to Yun\u2019s pros and cons.Yun thought about it carefully, it seems that this is indeed the case. For the Wei family, reputation is a very important thing. If you can get the love and support of the people, it will be very beneficial to your husband\u2019s promotion.What\u2019s more, because the anti-Japanese war has not made much progress, the imperial court is quite dissatisfied with the many soldiers in Xingshan County, and recently there is news that they will be dismissed from Xingshan County.This also caused her husband to stay away for the past few days and nights, thinking of ways to cure the Japanese pirates day and night.Yun Shi was a little moved.After thinking deeply, Yun said to Wei Ruo: \u201cMy mother can\u2019t decide this matter. I will talk to your father after he comes back and let him make up his mind.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Wei Ruo also knew that Wei Mingting had to make the decision if this matter was to be carried out.###Wei Mingting still didn\u2019t show up when having dinner at night. He hasn\u2019t shared dinner with everyone for ten consecutive days.Counting the first meeting, Wei Ruo has only met him four times so far, and each time he couldn\u2019t say a few words.I thought that there was no chance to tell Wei Mingting about the wasteland in the south of the city today, but before Wei Ruo fell asleep, Cuiping came to pass the word on Yun\u2019s behalf, telling her to go to Cangyun Garden, saying that her father wanted to see her.Wei Ruo dressed neatly again, went to Cangyun Garden, and saw Wei Mingting whom he hadn\u2019t seen for a long time.Still looking serious and serious, but compared to when we first met, he was a little more tired, and there was an additional wound on his arm, wrapped in a white cloth, it seemed that he had been injured for a few days.\u201cI just heard from your mother that you have a way to grow crops on the wasteland in the south of the city, but is it true?\u201d Wei Mingting asked.(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 24": "Chapter 24 - father's trustPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 24 Father\u2019s Trust\u201cIt\u2019s true. I dare not lie about this matter. If my father doesn\u2019t believe it, I can use a small piece of land to do experiments first. If it works, I can start large-scale planting.\u201dAfter answering, Wei Ruo looked at Wei Mingting, but she wasn\u2019t sure what Wei Mingting\u2019s attitude would be.Wei Mingting had a serious expression and a stern tone: \u201cRuo\u2019er, do you know how big a deal it is to be able to grow crops on saline-alkali land?\u201d\u201cI know. Father, I went to the north of the city a few days ago. I saw many farmers and fishermen turned into beggars on the way. Barren and limited.\u201d\u201cFather, I know this is a big deal, but if it comes to fruition, it will be a good thing for the family and the people. It will not only bring income to our family, but also increase the cultivated land in Xingshan County and increase food production. At that time, we can Feed more people; I hope my father will give me a chance, if not, I am willing to accept punishment.\u201dWei Ruolai\u2019s words made Wei Mingting look surprised, and he looked at Wei Ruolai again.Wei Ruo stood where he was, neither dodging nor dodging. She had already expected such a situation when she decided to talk to Yun about the wasteland in the south of the city.\u201cOkay, very good.\u201d Wei Mingting, who was always serious, suddenly said two \u201cyes\u201d.He is a strict father and rarely gives praise to his children. Even Wei Yichen, who is outstanding in his studies, rarely gives such clear praise.This surprised Yun who was beside him.Wei Mingting said to Wei Ruo: \u201cIt\u2019s very valuable for you to have such an idea. My father will discuss this matter with the county magistrate. Regardless of whether it can be achieved afterwards, it is always good for you to have this kind of heart.\u201dWei Ruo raised his head with a surprised expression.Wei Mingting agreed so happily that she never thought of it, and she has already made plans to communicate with Wei Mingting again.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Don\u2019t you have confidence?\u201d Wei Mingting asked.\u201cNo, I\u2019m confident.\u201d\u201cThen let\u2019s do it well. I heard from your mother that you still miss the farming life in the countryside these days when you return home. You also grew a lot of vegetables in the garden.\u201d\u201cyes.\u201d\u201cAlthough farming is indecent, it is never shameful. My court has always attached importance to farming. It is a good thing to be able to cultivate land and cultivate good land for the country and the people.\u201dUnexpectedly, Wei Mingting highly affirmed Wei Ruo\u2019s behavior.\u201cMy daughter knows.\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s getting late, you can go back and rest first, I will send someone to notify you when things become clear.\u201dWei Mingting looked very tired, so he didn\u2019t leave Wei Ruo to say more, and let Wei Ruo go back after talking about the things to be discussed.On the way back, Wei Ruo thought about Wei Mingting\u2019s words.In the original novel, Wei Mingting didn\u2019t appear much. Firstly, he was busy with official duties, secondly, he had such a personality, and thirdly, he died early.That\u2019s why Wei Ruo didn\u2019t know much about him before.But the conversation just now gave her a different understanding of Wei Mingting.After Wei Ruo left, Yun\u2019s servant Wei Mingting changed his clothes and re-bandaged his arm.\u201cHusband, Ruo\u2019er is a girl after all, if she goes to the fields all day long, I\u2019m afraid it will be bad for her in the future\u2026\u201d Yun told Wei Mingting about her worries.\u201cRuoer grew up in the countryside, if you want her to be like Wanwan, it would be too embarrassing for her.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t ask her to be as knowledgeable and reasonable as Wanwan, but if she acts like a peasant woman all day long, that\u2019s fine too.\u201d Yun said worriedly.\u201cMa\u2019am, in Xingshan County in recent years, you should have seen the suffering of the common people. What are the low-level people suffering like? What are you talking about? People only have the mood to think about elegant and vulgar issues when they are full. Even life is gone, so what is good or bad?\u201dWei Mingting and Yun\u2019s point of view are different. In the past few years in Xingshan County, he has seen a lot of life and death, and he has also seen a lot of poverty. He felt that in the face of these, the tricks played by the dignitaries in the capital were all meaningless.\u201cWhat my husband said is true. For the common people, the most important thing is to have enough food and clothing.\u201dYun didn\u2019t expect that Wei Ruo\u2019s thoughts coincided with her husband\u2019s thoughts, and she and her husband have been dating for many years, and she doesn\u2019t quite understand his husband\u2019s thoughts in many things.\u201cHusband, it\u2019s better not to think about these things. It\u2019s rare to go home and have a good rest. You don\u2019t say anything about your injuries.\u201dYun didn\u2019t want Wei Mingting to worry about these trivial matters anymore.Knowing that my husband must not have had a good rest in the barracks, he is so tired and injured. Although the wound is not deep, if it is not treated properly, it will leave the root of the disease.Wei Mingting really needs to rest, and will go back to the barracks early tomorrow morning.But he was still interested in the matter Wei Ruo mentioned.Before going to the military camp the next day, he went to the magistrate\u2019s office and talked with the magistrate about the wasteland in the south of the city.The county magistrate learned that the Wei family wanted to try to cultivate the wasteland, so he readily agreed.It\u2019s not that he disagrees with other people to do this, but he is worried about letting other people enter and leave the South City Gate.But the Wei family didn\u2019t need to worry, so they agreed very readily.After getting the result, Wei Mingting sent a letter home.Seeing that her husband is so concerned about this matter, Mrs. Yun has nothing to say.The Yun family called Wei Ruo to her, and first told her the good news: \u201cRuo\u2019er, your father has already sent a letter about the south of the city, and you can start planting a small area there. If it is effective, it will be a great achievement.\u201d pieces.\u201dThat being said, the Yun family has no hope for Wei Ruo\u2019s success.\u201cOkay.\u201d Wei Ruo was also very happy, he didn\u2019t expect Wei Mingting to be so hardworking and finish the matter so quickly.\u201cYour father also said that if you don\u2019t need to be too stressed, it doesn\u2019t matter if you don\u2019t get results, and there won\u2019t be too much loss.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Wei Ruo was a little moved by Wei Mingting\u2019s attitude.Yun immediately said: \u201cBut Ruo\u2019er, you are not young anymore, you should go to school at this time, I originally planned to let you go to the magistrate\u2019s mansion to study with Wanwan and the others after you have learned the rules with Madam Li , Mrs. Zhixian also agreed to this matter.\u201dWei Ruo: \u201cI don\u2019t want to go to the magistrate\u2019s house to study. I am not with them. It will be very difficult to force them to study together. Why don\u2019t you let me do something I am good at.\u201dYun\u2019s: \u201cRuo\u2019er, you need to change some of your previous thoughts. As a daughter of the Wei family, you should learn to be a daughter who is well-educated, up-to-date, elegant, and intelligent. Of course, because of the food you ate in the countryside in the past few years Bitter, I will not be too harsh on you, I don\u2019t ask you to be as knowledgeable as Wanwan.\u201dWei Ruo: \u201cBut I may not be able to keep up with Mr. Fu\u2019s teaching in the magistrate\u2019s office. If you really want me to learn, I don\u2019t want to go to the magistrate\u2019s office to learn.\u201dNot being able to keep up was an excuse Wei Ruo made for himself, the main purpose was not to be with Wei Qingwan, Qian Zhilan and the others.The male lead has come out~Continue to vote~(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 25": "Chapter 25 - Wei Jin is also sickPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 25 Wei Jin is also sick\u201cBut if you are asked to study with younger people, my mother is afraid that you will feel uncomfortable.\u201d Yun explained.\u201cThen can I find a husband myself?\u201d Wei Ruo asked.\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Yun showed a look of embarrassment, \u201cRuo\u2019er, it is very troublesome to invite a female teacher. It is not easy to invite a husband, and a learned female teacher will not easily go to the residence of ordinary people to teach. Secondly, Shuxiu is a considerable expense\u2026\u201dThe expenses of the Colonel\u2019s Mansion are already stretched, and now they have to arrange for the eldest son to study as a teacher, so there is no extra money to hire a special female husband for Wei Ruo.\u201cWhat if I can find a female gentleman who doesn\u2019t spend money?\u201d Wei Ruo asked.\u201cRuoer, don\u2019t mess around.\u201d Yun frowned.\u201cI\u2019m not fooling around, I\u2019m very serious. If I can really find a husband who is willing to teach me without restraint, can my mother allow me not to study with other people?\u201d\u201cRuo\u2019er, let\u2019s not talk about whether there is a female husband who is willing to teach you without restraint. It is very difficult to find a female husband. It is normal for you to not understand some things when you just returned home, but you You have to trust your mother, she will definitely make the best arrangements for you as much as possible.\u201dYun\u2019s language spoke earnestly.\u201cI see, but I have to complete the task in the south of the city first.\u201d Fortunately, there is still such an excuse that can be used.She originally only wanted to solve the food problem in Xingshan County, but she didn\u2019t expect to be able to help her block the matter of going to school in the magistrate\u2019s mansion.Yun\u2019s: \u201cI will allow you to go to the south of the city for a few days, and then you will try to arrange people in the mansion to do it, and you will go to the county magistrate\u2019s mansion to learn.\u201dWei Ruo: \u201cUnderstood.\u201d###The Yun family sent Madam Zhang and two long-term workers to help Wei Ruo.Mother Zhang has ten thousand unwilling people in her heart. The south of the city is desolate, and there is still a great potential danger. These days, who has nothing to do and runs outside the south of the city?Besides, the eldest lady is rushing to farm, her old bones can\u2019t stand the toss.But this was Yun\u2019s order, and she had to follow it.Originally thought that Wei Ruo would immediately take people to the south of the city, but the first order she gave was to let them buy chaff and straw, and collect leftovers from the kitchen.\u201cMiss, didn\u2019t you promise the master to plant crops in the wasteland in the south of the city? Why are there chaff and leftovers? Are you going to raise pigs?\u201d Madam Zhang asked.\u201cI just want to farm, you just need to get it according to my requirements, and I also need a batch of well-sealed wooden barrels to store these things.\u201dWei Ruo\u2019s request confused Madam Zhang, who had no idea what she was trying to do.Seeing Nanny Zhang\u2019s suspicious expression, she didn\u2019t move for a while.\u201cNurse Zhang, mother sent you here to help me, not to question me. If I fail, I will explain to my parents.\u201d Wei Ruo\u2019s attitude was tough and he could not be questioned.\u201cThe old slave knows.\u201d Zhang Nanny suppressed the dissatisfaction in her heart and nodded in agreement.What can be done? Who made the master and wife to be extra tolerant towards the young lady?She dared not raise her opinion even if she had an opinion!###Looking in Meiyuan, Wei Qingwan learned that Wei Ruo was busy with things recently, and that her mother had postponed her going to the magistrate\u2019s mansion to attend classes with them.\u201cMommy, my sister goes to the fields all day long. If word spreads, will it not be good for her reputation?\u201d Wei Qingwan asked Aunt Li beside her.\u201cNaturally, it will have a bad reputation. But Miss, don\u2019t worry too much. Originally, Miss came back from the countryside and was contaminated with the living habits of country people. It would be nice if she could learn some rules and not make a fool of herself in front of outsiders. Absolutely. It is impossible to be as knowledgeable and reasonable as you are, miss.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not the case. My sister also has her advantages. Last time, her dried sweet potatoes and dried potato chips won everyone\u2019s praise and love.\u201d Wei Qingwan murmured.\u201cThat\u2019s not a compliment. Those ladies and ladies just happened to be hungry, and they just praised her casually. She can\u2019t rely on dried sweet potatoes and sweet potato chips to earn a lifetime reputation.\u201dNurse Li showed great disdain for Wei Ruo being praised by everyone last time.Wei Qingwan lowered her head slightly, and after listening to Nanny Li\u2019s evaluation of Wei Ruo, her mood improved a lot.###For several days, Wei Ruo was very busy, busy arranging various preparations for the improvement of the wasteland in the south of the city.Almost always fall asleep at night, and sleep a lot throughout the day.That night, Wei Ruo fell asleep early as usual.was falling asleep, and a sudden knock on the door woke her up from her sleep.She straightened her upper body and headed towards the outer room. When she heard the door open, she knew that Xiumei had gone out to answer the door.After a while, Xiumei returned to the house.\u201cMiss, are you awake?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s so noisy?\u201d\u201cIt was Xiaobei who lives in Yingzhuyuan who knocked on the door, saying that their young master fell ill.\u201d\u201cI fell ill and went to see a doctor. What are you doing knocking on my courtyard door?\u201d Wei Ruo didn\u2019t understand.\u201cXiaobei said that they went to the people in the mansion to ask them to help find a doctor, but no one answered him. He had no other choice, so he begged to come to our yard.\u201dYingzhuyuan has no status in Xiaowei\u2019s mansion, so the subordinates dare to neglect them.Although Wei Ruo has just returned to Wei\u2019s house not long ago, her status in the mansion is obviously higher than Wei Jinyi\u2019s. No matter what the servants think about her, they never dare to neglect her in person.Guess Xiaobei begged Wei Ruo because he felt that Wei Ruo\u2019s words were better than theirs.\u201cMeimei, bring me my clothes.\u201dWei Ruo got off the bed, put on his clothes, and hurriedly walked out the door.Xiaobei was still waiting at the gate of Tingsongyuan. When he saw Wei Ruo coming, he quickly knelt down and begged, \u201cMiss, I beg you, please help my young master. He is so hot all over his body. People are not good! If you talk to the people in the mansion, they might agree to invite a doctor for the young master.\u201dXiaobei really had no choice but to ask the doctor to find the nanny in charge at home, but he couldn\u2019t even see the nanny in charge.And the master has not returned home for several days because he is busy fighting against the Japanese.He thought about it and could only think of Wei Ruo, this eldest lady who delivered things to their young master twice in a row, is the only person left in this mansion who might help their young master!\u201cOkay, I see, you get up first, and you take me to see your young master first.\u201d\u201cOkay, okay, Miss, follow me.\u201dXiaobei led Wei Ruo back to Yingzhuyuan quickly.Entering the main room in the courtyard, Wei Ruo saw Wei Jinyi lying unconscious on the bed.His complexion was already fair, and his face was even paler at the moment, as pale as paper.Wei Ruo reached out and touched Wei Jinyi\u2019s forehead, it was hot.\u201cYour young master has been ill for a few days, right?\u201d Wei Ruo asked.(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The young master said it\u2019s okay, just rest and rest, but suddenly his condition worsened at night, and he lost consciousness.\u201d Xiaobei looked anxious and disturbed.If he knew this earlier, he should have found a steward to invite a doctor for the young master earlier!\u201cLet\u2019s go, you and I will go find the nanny in charge.\u201d Wei Ruo got up and walked outside.She and Wei Jinyi are not very familiar after all, and it is not easy for her to expose her medical skills too much in the Wei family.It is better to let the family members solve the problems that can be solved by the family members.Now the person in charge of the backyard of the Wei Mansion is Nanny Li, who usually lives in the ear room of Wangmei Garden.Xiaobei knocked on the door, but the person who looked at Meiyuan didn\u2019t open it, Wei Ruolai knocked, and the person who looked at Meiyuan struggled for a while, but he still opened it.\u201cMiss, what are you doing here so late?\u201d Cui He asked Wei Ruo cautiously.\u201cWhere is your old lady?\u201d Wei Ruo directly asked Cui He Li where she lived.\u201cIn\u2026in the west wing\u2026\u201d Cui He replied in a low voice.Being able to live in the wing room as a servant shows that Nanny Li\u2019s status in the Wei family is indeed extraordinary.Wei Ruo didn\u2019t talk nonsense with Cui He, and went straight to the wing. After knocking for a while, the door finally opened.Nanny Li who was woken up was full of annoyance: \u201cMiss, do you have anything to wait for tomorrow during the day, what\u2019s the point of yelling at night?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t care if I yell or not when it\u2019s a matter of human life! The second young master is already in a coma, can you afford it if it happens?\u201d Wei Ruo questioned.\u201cIt\u2019s fine during the day, why is it unconscious at night? I think the second young master is usually very strong, why would he pass out for no reason? Don\u2019t mess around there, it\u2019s not a serious illness, wait until tomorrow There is still time to call for a doctor in the morning. Where do you want me to find a doctor for you in the middle of the night?\u201d\u201cOf course I went to the medical center to look for it!\u201d Wei Ruo pulled Nanny Li out of the room.Nurse Li\u2019s anger came to the fore immediately: \u201cYou are presumptuous! There are no rules at all! I came from the Earl\u2019s Mansion, and even my wife should respect me! How dare you pull me like this!\u201d\u201cNo matter how senior you are, you are still just a nanny! No matter how unpopular the second young master is, you are still the master! You still push back when I ask you to hire a doctor for the master at home, and you still have the nerve to say that you are a senior old nanny from the Earl\u2019s mansion? I want to ask you instead, where are all your rules?\u201d Wei Ruo scolded.On weekdays, Wei Ruo can let others put on airs in front of her, but when encountering life-threatening matters, Wei Ruo\u2019s temper explodes uncontrollably.\u201cIt\u2019s the wrong way! I won\u2019t invite you today! Let\u2019s see what you can do!\u201d Nanny Li puffed her chest out, proudly.The loud noise made Wei Qingwan live in a quarrel.When Wei Qingwan came out, she saw Wei Ruo pulling Nanny Li, and shouted anxiously, \u201cSister, what are you doing? Nanny is old, don\u2019t pull her like this, it\u2019s dangerous for you to pull her like this!\u201dSeeing that no one paid attention to her, she ran up to help, trying to pull Nanny Li and Wei Ruo away.At this moment, Nanny Li was furious, and she didn\u2019t notice that it was Wei Qingwan who jumped at her. She felt that someone was pulling her, so she pushed hard.Wei Qingwan was pushed to the ground at once.Seeing Wei Qingwan lying on the ground, Mammy came back to her senses and rushed to help Wei Qingwan.\u201cMiss, how are you doing, miss?\u201d\u201cNurse\u2026 my feet\u2026 my feet hurt\u2026\u201d Wei Qingwan looked at her ankle with a pale face, with a painful expression.Nanny Li panicked, and hurriedly ordered her daughter: \u201cCuihe, go to the madam! Tell the madam that the lady\u2019s leg is injured! Go and tell the guard, Xiao Qi, to ask him to go to the Baohetang immediately to ask for a doctor!\u201dImmediately afterwards, Nanny Li turned her head and glared at Wei Ruo fiercely: \u201cMiss, look at what you have done!\u201dWith a cold face, Wei Ruo flicked his sleeves, turned and left.She knew that today\u2019s matter would not be resolved for a while, but the people in Yingzhuyuan were still sick and couldn\u2019t afford to wait.I really wait until the daytime tomorrow to see a doctor, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m too cold.Wei Ruo returned to Yingzhu Garden and asked Xiumei to go back and bring her medical emergency kit.Xiumei hesitated for a moment, and took Wei Ruo\u2019s hand: \u201cMiss, are you trying to save the second young master?\u201d\u201cyes.\u201d\u201cBut miss, if the second young master is cured, you will be even more confused about what happened in Wangmeiyuan today! Then Li Nanny insists that the second young master is not ill, and you are the one messing around. How can you explain it to Madam!\u201dXiumei also knew that what happened just now would not be good, and their lady would be in trouble.\u201cThen I can\u2019t make fun of a human life. If he died of illness or was injured, I can prove my innocence, but if my innocence needs to be proved by **** life, then my innocence will not be in vain!\u201dSeeing Wei Ruo\u2019s firm attitude, Xiumei also knew what to do.\u201cI see, I\u2019ll listen to Miss!\u201d Xiumei turned her head and ran to Ting Songyuan to get a medical kit for Wei Ruo.She knew that her young lady had this kind of temperament. She said that the most important thing she cared about was money, and the last thing she could do was to trade at a loss.Wei Ruo then ordered Xiaobei to prepare cold water and towels.Xiaobei nodded again and again, and hurried back to fetch water.\u201cGo and lift your young master\u2019s quilt, and take off your clothes.\u201d Wei Ruo ordered.\u201cTake\u2026 take off your clothes?\u201d Xiao Bei was stunned.\u201cHe\u2019s already so hot, won\u2019t you be afraid to warm him up any longer? Listen to me, don\u2019t hesitate, or your young master\u2019s life will be lost!\u201d\u201cBut\u2026but male and female give and receive\u2026\u201d\u201cYou still care about this when human life is at stake?

The muscles that are strong but not too strong grow just right, strong but not majestic.At this time, Xiumei also came back with Wei Ruo\u2019s \u201cMedical First Aid Kit\u201d.\u201cPour one out of the bottle with the red label, mix it with a bowl of water, stir well and feed it to him.\u201d Wei Ruo continued to order.Xiumei has been by Wei Ruo\u2019s side for so many years, and she has been able to help Wei Ruo very skillfully. She quickly melted the pill and handed it to Xiaobei.\u201cWhat are you doing standing there? Hurry up and feed your young master!\u201d Seeing Xiaobei not moving, Xiumei urged.\u201cWhere did Miss\u2026 the medicine come from?\u201d Xiaobei asked.\u201cDon\u2019t worry about where it came from, you just need to know that it can save your young master\u2019s life! Could it be that my lady can harm your young master? Your young master is already like this, do you still need to work hard?\u201d\u201cwell\u2026\u201dXiaobei couldn\u2019t think too much, and went to the bed with a medicine bowl in his hand.Carefully fed the concoction into Wei Jinyi\u2019s mouth with a spoon.Wei Ruo put the towel in cold water, wrung it dry, and wiped Wei Jinyi\u2019s upper body.Then he opened the acupuncture bag and took out the long and thin silver needles.Seeing the silver needle, Xiaobei\u2019s face turned pale, his hands shook, and the medicinal juice spilled out of the spoon.Xiumei felt distressed on the side: \u201cBe careful, my lady has put a lot of thought into the medicine!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be distracted, just do your thing well. Now you have no other choice but to trust me.\u201d Wei Ruo looked serious.\u201cYes\u2026 yes\u2026\u201d Xiaobei responded repeatedly, and then forced himself to focus on the matter at hand.Wei Ruo raised the needle with his hand and dropped it quickly and accurately. In a short while, he dropped more than a dozen needles on Wei Jinyi\u2019s body.At this time, there was a lot of movement outside the door, and someone came.\u201cMiss\u2026\u201d Xiumei looked at Wei Ruo worriedly.\u201cGo and watch at the door, I\u2019ll be fine soon.\u201d Wei Ruo said.\u201cyes.\u201dLing Xiumei came to the door of the room.It was Madam Zhang and Cuiping, the eldest maid next to Yun\u2019s.\u201cIs Missy in the house?\u201d Nanny Zhang asked Xiumei with a serious expression.\u201cYes.\u201d Xiumei replied.\u201cPlease go and ask the eldest lady to come out, the madam is waiting for her in Wangmeiyuan.\u201d Zhang Nanny said.\u201cMammy, please wait a moment, Miss still has something to do, she will come out as soon as it is done.\u201d Xiumei didn\u2019t move, she used her body to block the door.\u201cWhat are you waiting for? Escaping won\u2019t solve the problem. If I had known this earlier, I should have restrained myself.\u201dNanny Zhang took it for granted that Wei Ruo did this to avoid punishment.\u201cMy lady didn\u2019t want to escape.\u201d\u201cNo escape? What is she doing now?\u201d\u201cMy lady just needs some time, please wait for a while.\u201d Xiumei said the same thing.Seeing this, Nanny Zhang sighed: \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing for you to protect the Lord, but now the madam wants to see the eldest lady, if you stop her like this, when the time comes, the madam will blame you, I\u2019m afraid even the eldest miss will not be able to protect you. You and I You are a servant, just do your duty well, and don\u2019t annoy the master.\u201dNanny Zhang saw that Xiumei was only a thirteen or fourteen-year-old girl, so she said a few more words.\u201cMadam wants to punish me, I admit it, but now, please wait a moment, sister Cuiping, my lady will not come out in a while.\u201dXiumei is a brainless person who only accepts what Wei Ruo says.\u201cYou haven\u2019t learned your lesson yet! If you are stubborn in doing things, you will suffer a lot! Forget it, I won\u2019t tell you.\u201dSeeing that it didn\u2019t make sense, Nanny Zhang and Cuiping stepped forward together, intending to forcefully break the door.Xiumei pressed her back against the door tightly. She didn\u2019t resist Zhang Nanny and Cuiping\u2019s attack, but she didn\u2019t move a bit, and just blocked the door firmly.In the house, Wei Ruo heard the quarrel outside, but she still concentrated on giving Wei Jinyi the injection.After the completion, Wei Ruo quickly put away the acupuncture bag to avoid being seen by those who came in.\u201cHe will be comatose again. If all goes well, he will wake up early tomorrow morning.\u201d\u201cReally\u2026really?\u201d Xiaobei looked at Wei Ruo in disbelief.\u201cDon\u2019t doubt, I don\u2019t joke about human life. There are still two pills in that bottle. You follow the method I just did, dissolve one medicine in a bowl of water, and give your young master a bowl after he wakes up. Tomorrow night Have another bowl.\u201d Wei Ruo continued to explain.\u201cOkay, okay, I\u2019ve made a note of it!\u201d Xiao Bei quickly agreed.Turning to Xiao Bei, who was beside him with a dull expression and blank eyes, he said, \u201cYou can\u2019t tell outsiders what I did to your young master today, can you do it?\u201dXiaobei froze for a moment, then nodded blankly.Wei Ruo didn\u2019t know whether he listened to it or not. Even if he didn\u2019t listen, she can\u2019t do anything now. Saving people is her own choice, and she has to bear any consequences.Wei Ruo glanced at the direction of the door, and probably guessed why the Yun family sent someone to find him.\u201cYou take good care of your young master here, I have other troublesome things to deal with.\u201dAfter explaining to Xiaobei, Wei Ruo walked to the door and opened the door.Nurse Zhang and Cuiping outside the door were in a panic.They didn\u2019t get any cheap from Xiumei. The two of them were exhausted after working for a long time, but it was Xiumei who still couldn\u2019t pull the door open.Wei Ruo first looked at Xiumei carefully, and after making sure that she was not injured in the dispute, she said to Nanny Zhang and Cuiping:\u201cDon\u2019t embarrass my maid, I will go with you now.\u201d\u201cMiss\u2026\u201d Xiumei looked at Wei Ruo worriedly.\u201cI\u2019m fine, you go back to Songyuan first.\u201d Wei Ruo explained.Xiumei looked worried, but she still chose to trust Wei Ruo.Nurse Zhang straightened her clothes, feeling a little annoyed and helpless: \u201cYoung Miss will be fine if you come out earlier, why bother everyone so much. Don\u2019t be like this when you see Madam and Miss later.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go, aren\u2019t you in a hurry?\u201dAfter finishing speaking, she walked out one step ahead of Nanny Zhang.Seeing this, Nanny Zhang and Cuiping hurriedly followed, as if they were afraid that Wei Ruo would run away.Wei Ruo has no intention of running away, where can she go in this Wei Mansion?Wei Ruo was taken to Wangmei Garden by Nanny Zhang and Cuiping. At this moment, the Wangmei Garden was brightly lit.Mr. Yun, who was already asleep, was fully dressed and sat in the main room with a serious expression.Nanny Li knelt in front of her.Wei Ruo walked to the side of Nanny Li, facing Yun, with a calm expression.Yun looked at Wei Ruo, and asked angrily: \u201cRuo\u2019er, what\u2019s the matter with you? Why did you go to Wanwan\u2019s courtyard to make trouble in the middle of the night? You pushed Wanwan down and hurt her! Do you know that Wanwan\u2019s feet are dirty?

And I didn\u2019t hurt anyone.\u201d Wei Ruo replied with a calm voice, neither humble nor overbearing.Nanny Li hurriedly explained: \u201cMa\u2019am, I don\u2019t want to invite a doctor for the second young master, but seeing that the second young master\u2019s illness is not serious, I want to ask for it again tomorrow. I have already told the second young master\u2019s attendant that the eldest lady is here.\u201d When I asked, I also explained it clearly to the eldest lady, I don\u2019t know why the eldest lady still made a fuss over this matter, and even pushed down the second lady, causing the second lady to be injured.\u201d\u201cYou said that the second brother\u2019s illness is not serious? You said that I recommended Wei Qingwan?\u201d Wei Ruo glanced coldly at Nanny Li.\u201cEveryone met the second young master during the day, and it was fine at that time, and all the servants can testify!\u201d Nanny Li knelt on the ground to defend herself.\u201cOh, it\u2019s really funny. Who told you that a person who is fine during the day may not be seriously ill at night? Haven\u2019t you heard of a disease that comes and goes like a mountain? You can tell if a person is seriously ill so easily. Why don\u2019t you To be a doctor?\u201d\u201cMiss thinks that the old slave deliberately neglected the second young master\u2019s condition, but why does the old slave want to neglect the second young master\u2019s condition?\u201d Nanny Li asked Wei Ruo.\u201cYou just think that if the second young master is not favored, you can bully the master!\u201d If it were Wei Yichen and Wei Yilin, see if she dares to do this!\u201cMiss, what nonsense are you talking about? How can the second young master not be favored? Madam is kind and generous, and treats all children in the family equally, no matter whether he is a descendant or a concubine, no matter how old or young, they all love her! How can we dare to be negligent as servants?\u201d Madam Li Said quickly.Nurse Li\u2019s words made Yun\u2019s already ugly face even uglier.She really doesn\u2019t want to see Wei Jinyi, but he\u2019s not missing the cost of food and clothing! Wei Ruo\u2019s \u201cnot favored\u201d hit her in the face!Seeing that Yun\u2019s face became more gloomy, Nanny Li knew that her words had worked.Immediately afterwards, Nanny Li continued to say with a sad face: \u201cThe old slave really judged that the second young master was not seriously ill based on the facts, so he decided to ask for a doctor tomorrow! If the eldest miss is dissatisfied with the old slave\u2019s judgment and handling , you can come at the old slave, why did you beat the second young lady so hard? She didn\u2019t do anything, but she was pushed to the ground by you for no reason, shed a lot of blood\u2026\u201dNanny Li began to wipe away tears, \u201cMy poor second miss, I wouldn\u2019t regret it even if the eldest miss beat me to death today, but the second miss is at such a young age, and she has suffered so much\u2026 What if there is something wrong with it?\u201d OK\u2026\u201dNurse Li began to change the subject, and what she said revealed that Wei Ruo deliberately slapped Wei Qingwan hard.Hearing this, Yun was furious, and slapped the tea table with his right hand hard, \u201cRuo\u2019er, you are too much! You made a big fuss in Meiyuan without knowing the ins and outs of the matter, and you pushed Wanwan to the ground, hurting Wanwan.\u201d Wan Wan is hurt! How did Wan Wan not do what you wanted? Are you going to treat her like this?\u201dSeeing Yun\u2019s angry appearance, Wei Ruo had no choice but to praise Nanny Li\u2019s brilliance in her heart.Wei Ruo replied to Yun: \u201cFirst, I found Nanny Li because of my second brother\u2019s illness; second, I didn\u2019t push Wei Qingwan. These are two facts. If you want to believe me, you can believe me. If you don\u2019t believe me ,I have no way.\u201dWei Ruo\u2019s voice was loud and powerful, and his eyes never evaded.\u201cYou said you didn\u2019t push Wanwan?\u201d Yun asked again.\u201cYes, it\u2019s not me.\u201d Wei Ruo said firmly.\u201cOkay, now I\u2019ll take you to confront Wanwan to see if it\u2019s Nanny Li who lied or you who lied!\u201d Yun stood up angrily.She walked in front, and Wei Ruo was followed by Nanny Zhang.Entering the bedroom, Wei Ruo saw Wei Qingwan lying on the bed with a pale face.Her feet were wrapped in white cloth, and the injury could not be seen at the moment.\u201cMother\u2026\u201d Seeing Yun Shi, Wei Qingwan burst into tears again.Mr. Yun\u2019s heart ached so much that she quickly stepped forward and hugged Wei Qingwan, \u201cWanwan, you have suffered.\u201dAfter Yun\u2019s comfort for a while, Wei Qingwan stopped crying.Then Yun asked Wei Qingwan: \u201cWanwan, tell mother, how did you fall tonight?\u201dHearing this, Wei Qingwan was taken aback, and raised her head to look at Wei Ruo, her eyes fainted.Wei Ruo is also looking at Wei Qingwan at this moment, taking every expression and every movement of her into his eyes.She and Wei Qingwan don\u2019t have any feuds, even in the original book, there is no such thing as Wei Qingwan subjectively harming her.As the kind and beautiful heroine in the original book, Wei Ruo wants to know what kind of response she will give at this moment.Wei Qingwan was a little guilty by Wei Ruo\u2019s gaze, hesitating whether to follow what Nanny Li told her to say.His eyes turned to Wei Ruo\u2019s right, and Nanny Li was looking at her.Wei Qingwan didn\u2019t answer for a long time, and Yun said to her: \u201cWanwan, you don\u2019t have to worry about it. Just tell me who pushed you, and mother will deal with it fairly.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026it\u2019s my sister\u2026\u201d Wei Qingwan faltered and said the word \u201csister\u201d.In an instant, all eyes in the room returned to Wei Ruo.Harsh, accusatory, angry.Wei Ruo suddenly wanted to laugh.Who would have thought that the kind and weak heroine in the original book would lie and slander her?Yun turned around and asked Wei Ruo: \u201cWhat else do you have to say now?\u201dWei Ruo: \u201cYes, I want to say that Wei Qingwan wronged me. I didn\u2019t push it, but I said it was me.\u201dYun Shi laughed angrily: \u201cYou are getting more and more outrageous! I really misjudged you! I thought that although you grew up in the countryside, you didn\u2019t have any bad habits on your body, but it turned out that you didn\u2019t understand it!\u201d\u201cI have not been infected with any bad habits, and there are no bad habits in the countryside that I can be infected with. Farming is not a bad habit, and the simple villagers in the countryside have no bad habits. Those who have bad habits are those who open their eyes and talk nonsense and slander others!\u201dWhile speaking, Wei Ruo stared fiercely at Wei Qingwan who was lying on the bed.I don\u2019t know if it was frightened by Wei Ruo\u2019s gaze, or because of a guilty conscience, Wei Qingwan lowered her head and silently wiped away her tears.Yun\u2019s heart was angry: \u201cYou still don\u2019t admit your mistake? What else do you want to do with Wanwan? What else do you want to do to her?\u201d(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 29": "Chapter 29 - Shut into the firewood roomPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 29 Locked in the woodshed\u201cDon\u2019t admit your mistakes if you\u2019re not wrong.\u201d Wei Ruo insisted.Mr. Yun was very angry: \u201cCuiping, Madam Zhang, you take her into the woodshed! Don\u2019t give her food! When did she admit her mistake and come out!\u201d\u201cMa\u2019am!\u201d Zhang Nanny and Cuiping were startled.It was the first time that Madam was so angry that she wanted to lock someone into the woodshed.\u201cDon\u2019t do it yet!\u201d Yun ordered.\u201cyes\u2026\u201dCuiping and Madam Zhang came to Wei Ruo.\u201cMiss\u2026\u201d\u201cI will go by myself.\u201dWei Ruo has no nonsense. Turn around and leave.When she came to the firewood room, Nanny Zhang whispered to Wei Ruo: \u201cMiss, you should admit your mistake to the madam. Be soft, and she will forgive you if you correct it next time.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t do anything wrong, why should I admit it?\u201dNurse Zhang sighed helplessly, and could only close the firewood door and lock it.As soon as the firewood room door was closed, Wei Ruo\u2019s surroundings became pitch black.The air is filled with the mixed smell of dry wood and dust.Wei Ruo found a straw pile and sat down.The only light in the firewood room is a small window on the slant above. Several wooden sticks divide the small window into several equal sections, and also cut the moonlight.It\u2019s already passed the Grain Rain, but I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because the weather has been relatively cold in the past few years. It\u2019s still a bit cold at night. Wei Ruo couldn\u2019t help curling up a little bit to reduce the body heat dissipation.I still remember that it was very cold at night when he was sent to the Mojiashan courtyard by the He family.At that time, the nanny and Xiumei were next to her, and the three slept together.Although the temperature was even colder that day, my heart was warm.She didn\u2019t want to go back to Wei\u2019s house, but she came back anyway.She didn\u2019t want to compete with Wei Qingwan, but somehow she managed to win.She tried her best to avoid fighting with the family members, but she was still involved.Wei Ruoban leaned against the mud wall of the woodshed, and couldn\u2019t help recalling his past life in his mind.In her previous life, she had an alcoholic domestic violence father, and a permissive mother.Although she was admitted to the top university by virtue of her talent and hard work, and also learned all kinds of skills from her master, she still couldn\u2019t get rid of that rotten native family.The alcoholic father came to her and asked her, who had just graduated, to pay child support.She disagreed, and her father started beating her.Mother rushed to protect her and held her in her arms, but was beaten to death by the father who had lost all reason.Then she took the scissors on the table and stabbed the father to death.In this life, she worked hard to make money, and she tried hard to settle down in this world relying on her own strength rather than others\u2019 pity.But she still couldn\u2019t change anything, and she would be punished if she didn\u2019t satisfy the family.In the last life, she failed to gain control over her own destiny through reading, and she is equally powerless in this life.This sense of powerlessness enveloped her, making her breathless.###After the doctor who came to Xiaowei\u2019s mansion gave Wei Qingwan a diagnosis, he went to write prescriptions and get medicine.Leave Nanny Li and Cui He to take care of Wei Qingwan.Wei Qingwan looked worried, and asked Madam Li cautiously: \u201cMama, will I be found out if I lie?\u201d\u201cNo, don\u2019t worry, Miss, this matter is known by God, you know me, no one else knows, as long as you don\u2019t show your timidity, no one will know.\u201d Li Nanny comforted.\u201cBut Mammy, I feel uneasy in my heart\u2026 I know it\u2019s not good to lie, but I really can\u2019t bear to see you being punished, Mammy, you are the one who loves me the most\u2026\u201d\u201cOld slaves know that old slaves know. The second lady has always been kind-hearted, and this time she chose to lie because of my old bones. I will always remember this kindness!\u201d Madam Li said gratefully.\u201cBut seeing my sister being punished by my mother, I blame myself\u2026 I don\u2019t want this, I really don\u2019t want things to be so big. I thought that because of my mother\u2019s love for my sister, I wouldn\u2019t put my sister in the woodshed. Seriously\u2026\u201d Wei Qingwan sobbed.\u201cMiss is locked in the woodshed because of her own fault. Miss, you saw it just now. She yelled in front of Madam, and she has no sense of seniority or inferiority at all.\u201d\u201dMy mother has always been kind, my younger brother has made mistakes many times, and my mother only punished my younger brother for copying books. I have never been punished so severely by shutting down the firewood room\u2026 I thought my sister would be punished for copying books at most\u2026\u201d\u201cIt can be seen that the madam is serious this time, and it also shows that the madam attaches great importance to you. If it were someone else, the madam would definitely not be so angry, but you are the treasure in the heart of the madam, and you cannot tolerate any mistakes. , even if it\u2019s her, Wei Qingruo.\u201d Nanny Li explained for Wei Qingwan.Wei Qingwan\u2019s words are very useful. Does her mother really value herself so much? Is his status in the heart of his mother really so much higher than that of Wei Qingruo?\u201cNurse, when dawn comes, take me to my mother to intercede with my sister. Just say that my injury is not serious, and let her stop punishing my sister.\u201d Wei Qingwan said.\u201cOkay, okay, we\u2019ll go after dawn, Miss, don\u2019t think about these things, just rest for a while.\u201d Nanny Li said.Nurse Li warned again: \u201cMiss, don\u2019t mention this matter again in the future, and let this matter rot in your stomach, and don\u2019t mention it again in the future.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Wei Qingwan bit her lip and nodded in agreement.###Wei Jin also opened his eyes, his head still hurts, but his body is much lighter than before.\u201cMaster, you finally woke up!\u201d Xiaobei was extremely excited.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d Wei Jin also responded, and his throat still hurt a little when he spoke.\u201cMissy didn\u2019t lie to me, she can really cure you!\u201d\u201cMiss? Has she been here?\u201dXiaobei quickly told Wei Jinyi what happened.\u201cYou mean I can wake up now, because she saved me?\u201dXiao Bei\u2019s words shocked Wei Jin also.Wei Ruo actually made a fuss about Meiyuan for himself, and even confronted his wife\u2026\u201cyes!\u201d\u201cThen where is she now?\u201d\u201cI was taken away by someone sent by my wife. The person who came was quite fierce, and she should be held accountable!\u201dWei Jin also supported the bed with his palms, trying to get up.\u201cYoung master, what are you doing? You haven\u2019t recovered yet, and the eldest lady said that you need to rest more!\u201d\u201cHelp me up.\u201d Wei Jin also turned pale, but the words he said were not to be questioned.Xiaobei had no choice but to do so, and helped Wei Jinyi out of bed.\u201cChange, go to Cangyun Garden.\u201d\u201cMaster\u2026\u201d Xiaobei had no choice but to dress Wei Jinyi.After taking two steps, Wei Jin also stopped suddenly.\u201cMaster, what\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d Xiaobei was shocked.Wei Jin also thought of something, and changed his words: \u201cHelp me back to bed.\u201dXiaobei didn\u2019t know what made his young master change his mind. He only knew that it was a good thing that the young master was willing to go back to rest, so he quickly helped Wei Jinyi back.Wei Jin also lay down again and said to Xiaobei: \u201cYou go to the guard Jing Hu immediately and tell him that I am seriously ill and unconscious, and my life is at stake.\u201dAsk for collection, please vote, please leave a message~(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Before the moon has completely disappeared, the eastern sky has already turned white.A man in armor is on the back of a galloping horse.The horse stopped at the gate of Wei Mansion, and as soon as it stopped, Wei Mingting jumped off.Without waiting for the boy at the door to come forward, he quickly stepped into the house.At this time, the Wei family had just calmed down.Wei Mingting strode into Cangyun Garden, which surprised everyone in Cangyun Garden.\u201cHusband?\u201d Yun was surprised that her husband returned home so early.Wei Mingting\u2019s face turned livid: \u201cHow is Jin Yi doing now?\u201d\u201cJin Yi?\u201d Yun was stunned.\u201cI\u2019m asking you how Jin Yi is doing now!\u201d Wei Mingting\u2019s voice was stern.Yun didn\u2019t know how to answer, and was at a loss for a while.At this time, the doctor who saw Wei Qingwan last night just came over.After checking with Wei Qingwan last night, it was confirmed that there was nothing wrong with it, so she simply applied the medicine, and the doctor didn\u2019t bring the rest of the medicine until this morning.Wei Mingting asked the doctor directly: \u201cHow is my son doing now?\u201dThe doctor was also stunned, \u201cMaster Wei\u2026 your son is also sick?\u201dWei Mingting\u2019s face became even colder when he heard this.Immediately after turning around, he walked towards Yingzhu Garden.Mr. Yun was shocked. After many years of marriage, she rarely saw her husband look so ugly.hurriedly took the doctor and chased after him.Entering Yingzhu Garden, the courtyard is desolate and deserted, and there is no one at the door of the bedroom.Wei Mingting pushed open the bedroom door, only to see Xiaobei was guarding the room, and Wei Jinyi was lying on the bed.Wei Mingting quickly came to the bed, saw the bloodless Wei Jinyi on the bed, and was furious: \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?!\u201dXiaobei knelt down with a thud: \u201cThe young master occasionally felt a cold in the past few days, and his body was a little unwell. The young one said to ask a doctor to take a look, but the young master said it was just a minor illness. He couldn\u2019t bear to bother his family, so he wanted to drink some **** tea to relieve the cold.\u201d Can recover, who would have thought that yesterday night just got worse, and the person is in a coma and has not woken up\u2026\u201d\u201cThen why don\u2019t you go to the doctor?!\u201d\u201cThe little one went to find the nanny in charge, and wanted the nanny in charge to help invite the doctor, but Wang Meiyuan\u2019s servants didn\u2019t allow the little one to go in. The little one had no choice but to ask the eldest lady, and the eldest lady took the little one to break into the house. After entering Wangmei Garden, I found Nanny Li, but Nanny Li said that the young master was not seriously ill and would not call a doctor\u2026\u201dXiaobei knelt on the ground tremblingly and told what happened last night.Except for the fact that Wei Jinyi is still in a coma and has not woken up to now, everything else he said is the truth.Wei Mingting suddenly turned his head to look at the door, Yun\u2019s face turned pale when he saw Wei Jinyi who was unconscious on the bed.\u201cEveryone is sick like this, why don\u2019t you ask a doctor?\u201d Wei Mingting questioned Yun.\u201cYesterday Wanwan\u2019s foot was injured, I was anxious about Wanwan\u2019s affairs\u2026 I didn\u2019t take care of it for a while\u2026 I thought Jin was fine\u2026\u201d Yun hurriedly explained.Wei Mingting asked the doctor: \u201cHow is my daughter injured?\u201dThe doctor didn\u2019t know what happened, so he just answered truthfully: \u201cSecond Miss\u2019s injury is not serious, it\u2019s just that the skin has been torn, and the muscles and bones are not injured. There will be no root cause of the disease. Please rest assured, my lord.\u201dAfter hearing the doctor\u2019s words, Wei Mingting became even more angry: \u201cWanwan is only scratched, and Jinyi is about to die! You invited the doctor back, but you only care about showing Wanwan\u2019s feet! Are you trying to kill Jinyi?! \u201c\u201cI\u2026\u201d Yun Shi also panicked, she really didn\u2019t know that Wei Jinyi was really so sick.After hearing Nanny Li\u2019s words, she thought that Wei Jinyi\u2019s serious illness was just Wei Ruo\u2019s excuse to break into Wangmei Garden!Seeing the dying Wei Jinyi and the furious Wei Mingting at this moment, Yun couldn\u2019t defend himself for a while.Wei Mingting ordered the doctor: \u201cGo and show my son!\u201d\u201cYes Yes!\u201dThe doctor was startled by Wei Mingting\u2019s aura, tremblingly came to the bed, and felt Wei Jinyi\u2019s pulse.Immediately afterwards, another cold sweat broke out: \u201cThis\u2026 this\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat is this? Tell me quickly!\u201d\u201cSecond Young Master\u2019s pulse appears to be absent\u2026 This\u2026 This is an extremely ominous pulse\u2026\u201dHearing this, the usually calm Wei Mingting also panicked: \u201cIs there any way?\u201d\u201cI\u2026 I will write the prescription right now, and you immediately send someone to grab the medicine, fry it and give it to the second young master. As for whether you can save your life, it depends on the second young master\u2019s own good luck\u2026 I have never received such a serious medicine before. Patient. If he could have been seen earlier, maybe it would not be so serious\u2026\u201d The doctor explained tremblingly.\u201cJing Hu, you go with the doctor. He wrote the prescription and you hurry to grab the medicine and come back! You can watch the whole process from picking up the medicine to decocting it, and there can\u2019t be a moment\u2019s delay!\u201dWei Mingting immediately ordered the guards outside the door to do this matter.\u201cThis subordinate takes orders!\u201d Jing Hu got the order and acted quickly.In the past, he had left these things to Yun Shi to take care of, but today he directly ordered the guards, which shows that he was very disappointed with Yun Shi on this matter.Wei Mingting asked Xiaobei to get up again: \u201cStay here and take care of your young master. If this kind of thing happens in the future, please contact me as soon as possible.\u201d\u201cYes, I understand.\u201d Xiao Bei agreed.Wei Mingting stood in front of the bed again and looked at Wei Jinyi with a heavy expression for a while. His serious and ugly expression made everyone in the room fearful, and no one dared to show their anger.After a long while, Wei Mingting turned and left, and the Yun family cautiously followed.Returned to Cangyun Garden. Looking at Wei Mingting who was exuding anger all over his body, Yun knelt down.Full of anger, Wei Mingting looked at Yun who was kneeling in front of him, and asked:\u201cI know that you have a grudge against Jin Yi in your heart. If you have resentment about that matter, you are targeting me! You shouldn\u2019t treat him like this! I want you to take good care of him, and that\u2019s how you take care of him? I won\u2019t be late One step away and he\u2019s dead!\u201d\u201cI really don\u2019t know that Jin Yi is seriously ill. If I knew, I wouldn\u2019t put his life at risk!\u201d Yun\u2019s eyes turned red.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you know? Wanwan\u2019s feet are bruised, you can know, you can call a doctor in the middle of the night, and Jin Yi is so sick that you don\u2019t know?! The servants around Jin Yi couldn\u2019t ask for a doctor, even Ruo\u2019er I have helped but still can\u2019t get it, can you tell me what\u2019s going on?\u201dContinue to ask for collections, votes, and comments~(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

How could I have the heart to murder a concubine? I admit that I can\u2019t treat him like my own son. I can be magnanimous to other things, but I can\u2019t be so magnanimous to you.\u201dYun said again: \u201cBut the matter has passed for so many years, even if I have any grievances, it has almost disappeared, so how could I have the idea of murdering him! Husband, I didn\u2019t intend to harm him. Believe me, I was killed. Diao Nu is blinded!\u201d\u201cYou\u2026you are so confused!\u201d\u201cI know\u2026I know I\u2019m wrong\u2026\u201d Yun replied with a trembling voice.Wei Mingting\u2019s anger was slowly extinguished under Yun\u2019s sobbing voice.Looking at his wife, Wei Mingting sighed, \u201cI am busy with military affairs, and I need you to take care of everything at home on weekdays. You need to pay more attention to Jin Yi\u2019s affairs, and he must not be busy.\u201dThinking that he was busy with military affairs all day long, and all the burdens of the family fell on his frail wife, and also knew that although his wife had not treated the concubine very well all these years, but she had given Jin Yi what she should have, Wei Mingting couldn\u2019t bear to scold him severely any longer. wife.Yun sobbed and nodded.\u201cIt was like this before today, you help me take care of Jin Yi, there are still things in our army.\u201d Wei Mingting got up, and left without waiting for Yun\u2019s recovery.He was really busy. After receiving a letter from Jing Hu, he asked his subordinates to take his place, and rushed back before dawn.Even so he had to go back immediately.After Wei Mingting left, Mrs. Yun calmed down her emotions, and when she calmed down, she called Nanny Li to her again.At the same time, Cuiping was asked to bring Wei Ruo to the woodshed.Nurse Li didn\u2019t know what happened at this time. When she came to Cangyun Garden, she was shocked when she saw Yun\u2019s angry face.Wei Ruo also arrived shortly after.Looking at Nanny Li who was being brought in, Yun\u2019s voice was as cold as ice: \u201cMadam Li, you are an old nanny who came from Uncle Zhongyi\u2019s Mansion, no matter in terms of qualifications or seniority, you are the highest in the Captain\u2019s Mansion. \u201c\u201cMa\u2019am, this old servant doesn\u2019t dare.\u201d Nanny Li said hastily.\u201cDon\u2019t you dare? Why are you afraid? You kept telling me that the second young master was not seriously ill and that Ruo\u2019er was messing around. What happened! The second young master lost half his life!\u201dHearing this, Nanny Li froze.What? Is the second young master really that sick?After being shocked, Nanny Li knelt down and kowtowed to admit her mistake: \u201cMadam, forgive me, I really don\u2019t know that the second young master is so seriously ill! This old slave made a mistake in judgment, this old slave deserves to die!\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t know? How dare you say you don\u2019t know? If you don\u2019t know, you dare not call a doctor for him. If you don\u2019t know, you dare to swear that he is not sick? Who gave you the courage to make your own decisions?\u201d\u201cOld slave\u2026Old slave\u2026\u201d Nanny Li hesitated for a long time but couldn\u2019t find an excuse to excuse herself.Wei Ruo was also a little surprised, Wei Jin also had half his life left? It would be fine if she didn\u2019t treat him last night, but after her treatment last night, as long as he is obedient and rests well, he should wake up this morning, and it is unlikely that he will be in a critical condition.Yun\u2019s eyes fell on Wei Ruo, and his eyes became complicated.\u201cRuo\u2019er, you still have something wrong with what happened to you last night. Even if you are in an emergency to save someone, you shouldn\u2019t push Wanwan.\u201d\u201cSo I only got rid of one crime, and you still think it\u2019s my problem?\u201d Wei Ruo looked at Yun, and smiled instead of anger.Yun frowned: \u201cWhat do you want to say?\u201dWei Ruo sneered: \u201cI\u2019ve already said what I wanted to say. I\u2019m not wrong. I deny the two charges you mentioned. Since you have learned that the second brother\u2019s serious illness is true, you have been deceived by the slave. , wronged me, why don\u2019t you think about it again, is it another thing that you were deceived by others and wronged me?\u201d\u201cIs this your attitude when talking to your mother? If you are not wrong, you should come to me to deal with it after you failed to find Nanny Li, instead of making a scene in Wang Meiyuan! If you were not reckless, no one would be injured, no As for alarming your father to rush over in his busy schedule.\u201dYun Shi was also extremely wronged today.Because of this incident, she annoyed her husband, was reprimanded by her husband, and was considered by her husband to have treated the **** harshly.\u201cI\u2019m not wrong. It\u2019s not me who made a big fuss about Meiyuan because Nanny Li didn\u2019t do what she was supposed to do; it wasn\u2019t me who disturbed my father\u2019s busy schedule, it was Nanny Li who delayed my second brother\u2019s illness. Not wanting to trust my mother.\u201dWei Ruo insisted that he was not wrong, and had no intention of being subdued.\u201cyou!\u201dWei Ruo\u2019s attitude angered Yun again.Yun stared at Wei Ruo furiously, and was about to say the words of punishment.\u201cMother!\u201dWei Yichen came in a hurry. He lived in the most southwest corner of Wei Mansion. It was quiet and convenient for him to study, but it also made him ignorant of what happened last night.I hurried over after learning that such a big thing happened this morning.After entering the door, Wei Yichen first glanced at the stubborn Wei Ruo next to him, and then said to Yun:\u201cMother! Sister Ruo\u2019er is not wrong for wanting to find Nanny Li to find a doctor for her second brother! If Nanny Li handles it well, there is no need to alarm mother. This is the rule of the mansion! You should blame it if you want Blame Nanny Li for being negligent, she didn\u2019t handle the things she should have handled well! It caused our family to be divorced!\u201d\u201cMother, if sister Ruo\u2019er has only been home for a month, it\u2019s very rare to know how to deal with this matter! As for the incident where she accidentally hurt Wanwan, it happened out of desperation, not on her own will. It\u2019s about my second brother Life, is it not natural for my sister to be nervous?\u201d\u201cThe person that mother should really punish is Nanny Li. As a domestic slave, failing to report a serious illness to the mistress is the first crime; slandering the master and turning the truth upside down is the second crime; failing to protect the master and causing the master to fall and get injured is the third crime! \u201cWei Yichen\u2019s words made Nanny Li, who was kneeling on the ground, turn pale, and also calmed down the angry Yun Shi a lot.Ms. Yun listened, her expression eased, her eyes fell on Wei Ruo again, and she suddenly remembered the sweet days with her husband when she was pregnant with her daughter.At that time, my husband was not so busy and had time to accompany her every day. Both of them were very much looking forward to the second child.Because the first child gave birth to a son, the husband said that he hoped that this child would be a daughter, saying that the daughter was caring and would spend more time with her.Mr. Yun turned her head and asked Nanny Li: \u201cDo you agree with what the young master said?\u201dNanny Li knelt on the ground, trying to refute herself, but she couldn\u2019t find any words to refute.\u201cIf you don\u2019t say anything, you admit it. As a domestic slave, you have committed several crimes. According to the rules, you will be beaten to death with a stick, but because you are an old slave from the Zhongyi House, and you have worked hard for the Wei family for many years, you will be punished.\u201d You pay for three months, and then go to Zhuangzi to be a coolie for three months.\u201dHearing this, Nanny Li quickly called out: \u201cMadam, Madam, I am getting old, I can\u2019t bear to go to Zhuangzi to do coolies for three months!\u201d(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 32": "Chapter 32 - i'll keep your secretPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 32 I will keep a secret for you\u201cMother has dealt with you lightly, what else can you complain about?\u201d Wei Yichen interrupted Nanny Li begging for mercy in a cold voice, and then ordered the guards outside the door to come in and drag Nanny Li down forcibly.\u201cMadam\u2026Madam\u2026Eldest Young Master\u2026\u201d Nanny Li kept shouting as she was being dragged away.After Nanny Li was taken away, the atmosphere in the house was still bad, Wei Ruo said nothing, and looked at Yunshi coldly.Wei Yichen said: \u201cMother is tired after a busy night, let\u2019s take a rest first, and my son will take his sister back to Tingsongyuan.\u201dMr. Yun waved his hand, indicating that the two of them can step back.Wei Yichen walked up to Wei Ruo, took Wei Ruo\u2019s hand, and said softly, \u201cGo back with elder brother.\u201dWei Ruo glanced at Wei Yichen, but did not resist.Followed Wei Yichen out of the gate of Cangyun Garden, and walked all the way into the gate of Tingsong Garden.Xiumei stayed up all night, and when she saw Wei Ruo coming back, she was so excited that she almost burst into tears.\u201cMiss, you are back!\u201d Xiumei rushed forward and hugged Wei Ruo.\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201dWei Ruo touched Xiumei\u2019s cheek, and seeing her swollen eyeballs, she knew that this girl secretly shed tears last night.Wei Ruo turned to Wei Yichen who sent him back and said, \u201cThank you, brother, for speaking for me.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay, it should be, I really don\u2019t think there is anything wrong with you, such a life-threatening matter, anyone would be flustered, you just pushed Wanwan carelessly in a hurry, it wasn\u2019t intentional.\u201d Wei Yichen said.\u201cBrother also thinks that I recommended Wei Qingwan?\u201d Wei Ruo looked at Wei Yichen with a hint of expectation in his eyes.\u201cI know you didn\u2019t mean it, brother doesn\u2019t think you\u2019d be so nonsense.\u201dThe gleam of expectation in Wei Ruo\u2019s eyes disappeared, and she smiled calmly: \u201cUnderstood, thank you, brother.\u201d\u201cWell, you go back to the house to rest first, and have a good sleep.\u201dWei Yichen gave Wei Ruo a few words and left Tingsongyuan.After Wei Yichen left, Wei Ruo didn\u2019t go back to the house to rest as he said, but went to Yingzhu Garden next door. She wanted to know what happened to Wei Jinyi now.Obviously she had given him injections and medicines last night, so it didn\u2019t make sense that his condition would get worse in the morning.When I came to Yingzhuyuan, I saw guards guarding the door, the smell of herbs filled the yard, and there were two maids busy decocting medicine.Wei Ruo walked straight into Wei Jinyi\u2019s bedroom.Seeing Wei Ruo enter the door, Xiao Bei who was standing in front of the bed stood up with an excited expression: \u201cMiss, are you back? Are you alright?\u201dWei Ruo walked to the bed and saw the person on the bed with his eyes closed, so he stretched out his hand to feel the pulse.His slender fingers rested on Wei Jinyi\u2019s wrist, and Wei Ruo frowned after a while.what happened? Why such a dangerous pulse?Obviously she had given him acupuncture and medicine yesterday, so it stands to reason that even if Wei Jinyi has not recovered, at least his pulse should have stabilized.Wei Ruozheng was puzzled, and Wei Jin also opened his eyes.At the same time, he retracted his wrist: \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201dThe voice is still a little weak, and the face is still a little pale, but the eyes are clear, and it has obviously recovered a lot.\u201cYou pretended?\u201d Wei Ruo was surprised for a moment, then immediately thought of something.Looking at Wei Jinyi, he didn\u2019t answer, but Wei Ruo had the answer in his heart.\u201cThank you.\u201d Wei Ruo thanked.\u201cNo need.\u201d Wei Jin also replied.\u201cHow did you manage to change your pulse so that the person who gave you the pulse thought your pulse was dangerous?\u201d Wei Ruo was curious.She has practiced medicine for many years, and this is the first time she has met someone who can turn her good pulse into a fierce one to deceive people.\u201cAccording to what I read in medical books, pressing the above-mentioned points on the arm can affect the pulse condition.\u201d Wei Jin also replied, looking at Wei Ruo with deep eyes, paused, and asked Wei Ruo: \u201cWhen did you learn it?\u201d Medicine?\u201d\u201cI learned it from an old man when I was in the country.\u201d Then Wei Ruo said, \u201cThen you should have a good rest, your body still needs to be nourished for a few more days, don\u2019t do strenuous exercise in these few days, lie down well, so as not to What\u2019s wrong with it?\u201dPeople are fine, and Wei Ruo will stay soon.When Wei Ruo walked to the door, he heard Wei Jinyi\u2019s calm but convincing voice behind him: \u201cI will keep the secret for you.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Wei Ruo agreed, and then walked out of the room.After returning to Tingsongyuan, Wei Ruo washed up and fell asleep.It was evening when I woke up.After a little grooming, I went to the dining hall.I felt a different atmosphere as soon as I entered the door.Wei Qingwan didn\u2019t come because her foot hurt.Only Yunshi, Wei Yichen, Wei Yilin and Wei Ruo are left.Except for Wei Yichen, the expressions of the other two are not very good, especially Wei Yilin.As soon as she saw Wei Ruo, she stared at her with vicious eyes as if she was about to swallow Wei Ruo alive.Wei Ruoquan pretended not to see it, and sat down calmly in his seat.\u201cHmph!\u201d Wei Yilin deliberately let out a cold snort to convey his dissatisfaction.\u201cYilin, don\u2019t eat or sleep.\u201d Wei Yichen reminded solemnly.Wei Yilin pouted, puffed out his cheeks, and lowered his head to pick up the rice.After the meal, Yun did not invite everyone to drink tea and chat together as usual, nor did he greet Wei Ruo as before, but directly asked everyone to go back to rest.Wei Ruo came out of the dining hall, and within a few steps, he heard hurried footsteps behind him.Wei Yilin chased after her, walked around to Wei Ruo, and blocked her way.\u201cWhy do you bully my sister! My sister is so good! She thinks about you in everything, gives you all the good things, and tells me to treat you well, but you push her down and hurt her! You are too bad! \u201cWei Yilin questioned Wei Ruo.Wei Ruo didn\u2019t want to talk to Wei Yilin, so he moved to another place and continued walking.Unconvinced, Wei Yilin chased after him again, and blocked Wei Ruo with open arms.\u201cYou have to speak clearly today!\u201d Wei Yilin said with a straight face and a terrifying aura.\u201cWhat did you say? How did I bully Wei Qingwan? How vicious and cruel I was to push Wei Qingwan to the ground and hurt her?\u201d\u201cYou admit that you are vicious?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not that I admit it, but you want me to admit it. You already assume that I\u2019m a bad person. What else can I tell you?\u201d Wei Ruo sneered.Wei Yichen, who was catching up, pulled Wei Yilin away: \u201cYilin! Big brother has already made everything clear to you. It was just an accident that Ruoer pushed Wanwan down!\u201d\u201cMy sister is bleeding! And what if there are scars left?\u201d\u201cRuoer is in such a hurry because your second brother fell ill! In the face of life-threatening events, it would be strange if Ruoer is calm, do you understand?\u201d Wei Yichen taught.\u201cThat\u2019s not my second brother, he wasn\u2019t raised by my mother!\u201d Wei Yilin also didn\u2019t approve of Wei Jinyi, in his opinion that was a freak.\u201cThen I didn\u2019t see how much you recognized my sister who was born with you.\u201d Wei Ruo said bitterly.\u201cYou!\u201d Wei Yilin wanted to refute Wei Ruo, but couldn\u2019t find any words to refute in his head.Xiaobei: I suspect that neither of you is telling the truth!(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 33": "Chapter 33 - very clearPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 33 is very clear\u201cTo put it bluntly, it\u2019s all an excuse. You came here according to your own preferences. Don\u2019t make so many high-sounding reasons. It sounds ridiculous.\u201d Wei Ruo commented.Wei Yilin\u2019s face was flushed red by Wei Ruo.Wei Yichen pulled Wei Yilin: \u201cApologize to Ruoer.\u201dWei Yilin said angrily with a stern face: \u201cI don\u2019t! Brother, you are helping her now, and you don\u2019t protect Sister Wanwan anymore. If I don\u2019t protect Sister Wanwan anymore, Sister Wanwan will only be bullied She is my sister, the one who loves me the most! I don\u2019t allow anyone to bully her!\u201dAfter speaking, Wei Yilin broke free from Wei Yichen, and quickly ran away with red eyes.Wei Yichen frowned slightly, and explained to Wei Ruo with a helpless expression: \u201cNot long after Yilin was born, my father went to work in Xingshan County. He was busy with official duties, and my mother became very busy because of the relocation. Yilin\u2019s character was formed because of neglecting his studies and taking care of him, so don\u2019t argue with him, I will teach him well in the future.\u201d\u201cSo what if I want to argue with him? What do you think I can do to him? If I really do something to him, guess who will be punished in the end, he or me?\u201d Wei Ruo asked back, with sarcasm in his eyes .Wei Yichen looked solemn: \u201cRuo\u2019er, I know that yesterday\u2019s mother locked you in the woodshed and hurt you. It\u2019s also my elder brother\u2019s fault. I didn\u2019t know earlier and caused you to suffer. My elder brother is really sorry.\u201d\u201cBrother will say this now. If something really happens, and some more intense conflicts arise, brother may not speak for me like he is now.\u201d\u201cRuo\u2019er\u2026\u201dWei Ruo interrupted Wei Yichen: \u201cDon\u2019t talk about this, I have something to give to my elder brother. When I pass Tingsongyuan, my elder brother will wait for me for a while.\u201d\u201cSomething?\u201d Wei Yichen looked at Wei Ruo with some surprise.\u201cUm.\u201dWei Ruo didn\u2019t say much, when he reached the gate of Tingsongyuan, Wei Ruo trotted into the house, and came back with a roll of things in his hand.\u201cThis is for you.\u201d Wei Ruo handed Wei Yichen a roll of paper.\u201cPaper? From Sibaozhai?\u201d Wei Yichen took a few glances in his hand and recognized that it was Sibaozhai\u2019s paper.Looking at the paper, Wei Yichen couldn\u2019t help showing joy on his face.Wei Ruo: \u201cWell, I brought some along the way when I came from Huzhou Prefecture.\u201dWei Yichen: \u201cThe paper is not cheap, how much is it, I will give it to you.\u201dWei Ruo: \u201cNo need, just take it as a thank you gift to my elder brother for helping me out.\u201dWei Yichen: \u201cThe words yesterday are what I should say, and you don\u2019t need to thank me specially.\u201dWei Ruo: \u201cFor me, that\u2019s something I need to be grateful for. No matter what, you can keep it, brother.\u201dSome things are better to be clear. She doesn\u2019t like to owe Wei Yichen favors, even if it\u2019s just a little, she doesn\u2019t want to.Wei Yichen looked at the paper in his hand, thought for a while, \u201cOkay, then I\u2019ll accept it, and I\u2019ll bring you something delicious next time.\u201dWei Yichen didn\u2019t want to be so clear with Wei Ruo, and besides, he really liked these papers. The few papers his father gave him last time were quickly used up. He wanted to buy more, but only Huzhou City had them. It was too far away. The cost is too high, so we can only give up.Sister Ruoer gave him such an expensive gift, he must return the gift properly next time.###The next day, Wei Ruo went to Yingzhu Garden to visit Wei Jinyi again, to see how his body was recovering.In the Wei Mansion, Wei Jin is still pretending to be sick. I don\u2019t know what method he used to make the doctor invited by the Wei Mansion judge that he is in danger.After Wei Ruo entered the room, Xiao Bei stood guard at the door, and if someone came in, he would sound a warning to the people in the room.Wei Jin also got up from the bed, seeing Wei Ruo, his expression was not as cold and repulsive as before.\u201cThis is for you.\u201d Wei Ruo took out a white porcelain bottle and put it on top of Wei Jinyi\u2019s bedside cabinet.\u201cThe medicine you prescribed?\u201d Wei Jin also asked.\u201cWell. You have some symptoms of physical weakness, which should have been brought out of your mother\u2019s womb. Taking this medicine for a long time can help you maintain your health. If your foundation is better, you will not deteriorate like this after contracting a cold.\u201dWei Ruo didn\u2019t hide it anymore, anyway, he already knew about his medical skills.Wei Ruo didn\u2019t notice that when she said \u201cbrought out of the womb\u201d, Wei Jinyi\u2019s expression changed, and there was a little chill in his cold eyes, but it quickly dissipated.After Wei Ruo finished speaking, Wei Jin also picked up the medicine bottle, looked at it carefully, opened the bottle cap again, put it in front of his nose and sniffed carefully.Wei Ruobian pursed his mouth: \u201cYou can eat it well for me, don\u2019t waste it, I have spent a lot of thought on this medicine, and many of the medicinal materials in it are not easy to find.\u201dIf he dares to spoil the pill she worked so hard to make, she will kill him! snort!Wei Jin also stared at Wei Ruo, seeing her little expression and eyes.After a while, he said, \u201cThank you.\u201dThis is the first time he said this word to Wei Ruo since they met for so long.\u201cDidn\u2019t you say you don\u2019t need to say thank you yesterday, why did you say it today?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d Wei Jin also looked away, and put the medicine bottle under the pillow. Someone will come to his room in a while, so he can\u2019t let others see the medicine bottle.Then he took a book from the bedside table and read it.Very well, he has returned to his previous appearance, reading or writing with his head down. Anyway, his two major hobbies in life are these two.After Wei Ruo left, Wei Jin also called Xiaobei to him again and gave him an envelope.\u201cYou send this letter to Chengdong Shiji Bakery.\u201dHearing this, Xiaobei was shocked, it was not an ordinary bakery! On the surface it sells cakes, but in fact it is a contact station\u2026\u201cMaster, do you want to\u2026\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d Wei Jin didn\u2019t say much, as long as Xiaobei did as he asked.\u201cOkay, young master, take a good rest, and I\u2019ll go.\u201dXiao Bei remembered that the young master hadn\u2019t contacted those people for a long time.I don\u2019t know why, but today I suddenly decided to reconnect with that side.Maybe it was because of a serious illness.Xiaobei went out with Wei Jinyi\u2019s letter.Wei Jin is also a man, and it is much easier for him and his attendants to enter and leave the mansion than the female family members.After more than an hour, Xiaobei came back smoothly, and brought back a lot of things.After Wei Jinyi looked at the things, he took out one of the wooden boxes and asked Xiaobei to take it to Tingsong Garden next door to Wei Ruo.Seeing Xiaobei bring something over, he said it was a thank you gift from his young master.Wei Ruo was naturally not polite to Wei Jinyi, took it in his hand and opened it, and was surprised.It turned out to be an old wild ginseng, at least a hundred years old!Wei Ruo quickly closed the wooden box, and after making sure that no one else was around, Wei Ruo opened it again, took a closer look, and after confirming that it was a hundred-year-old wild ginseng, Wei Ruo asked Xiaobei who came to deliver things:\u201cYour young master asked you to give this to me?\u201d(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 34": "Chapter 34 - Braised Spring Bamboo ShootsPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 34 Braised spring bamboo shoots in oil\u201cYes, the young master gave it to the eldest lady.\u201d Xiaobei replied.\u201cWhere did your young master get this thing?\u201d Wei Ruo asked.\u201cThis\u2026I don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d Xiao Bei was vague.\u201cIs your young master in the yard?\u201d Wei Ruo asked.\u201cexist.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll find him!\u201dSince asking Xiaobei doesn\u2019t yield anything, I\u2019d better ask Wei Jinyi in person.In the bedroom, Wei Jinyi\u2019s lower body was covered by the quilt, and his upper body leaned against the cushion, holding a book in his hand.He was wearing a white singlet, his face was still haggard, and the sickly beauty looked like a vine and iceberg flower that had been beaten by rain.Wei Ruo walked over, and Wei Jin raised his head to look at her.\u201cYou want to give me such a precious old mountain ginseng?\u201d Wei Ruo asked, pointing to the wooden box in his hand.\u201cyes.\u201d\u201cWhere did you get such a valuable thing?\u201d Wei Ruo was curious.\u201cI rescued an old man a few years ago, so I gave it away.\u201d Wei Jin also replied.Xiao Bei heard Wei Jinyi\u2019s answer from the side, and muttered in his heart, the young master doesn\u2019t even blush when he lies! Where did the rescue come from? This old mountain ginseng is clearly\u2026\u201cAre you sure you want to give me such a valuable old wild ginseng? It\u2019s worth a lot of money to sell it! You can get it for one or two hundred taels.\u201d Wei Ruo reminded.\u201cYou have saved my life, which is even better than Laoshan Ginseng.\u201d Wei Jin also replied.The medicine that Wei Ruo gave him is a precious item that can\u2019t be bought anywhere else, and can\u2019t even be asked for.It is true to say so, but Wei Ruo looked at Wei Jinyi\u2019s shabby appearance, and guessed that the value of this old wild ginseng was worth all his net worth.He is so poor, but he can still give her such a valuable thing, it can be seen that he is really a kind person, and she did not make a mistake in her decision to save him at the risk of being exposed that day.\u201cOkay then, I\u2019ll take the old wild ginseng, and I\u2019ll give you a few pills next time I use it to make big tonic pills.\u201d Wei Ruo said.\u201cYeah.\u201d Wei Jin also agreed, but didn\u2019t really expect Wei Ruo to give him any supplement pills.###Two days later, Wei Jinyi finally \u201ccured\u201d from his illness.I can eat, drink, get out of bed and walk.Everyone in the Wei manor breathed a sigh of relief, finally they don\u2019t have to worry about being punished by Wei Mingting.Wei Ruo came to see Wei Jinyi again, and dug away the bamboo shoots in his yard.This bamboo shoot will be completely old if you don\u2019t eat it anymore. It\u2019s better to sacrifice to her five internal organs temple than to waste it.Just in time for Xiaobei to cook food and bring it to Wei Jinyi\u2019s room.Seeing those meals, Wei Ruo showed a surprised expression, the porridge he drank was fine, and when recovering from a serious illness, drink some water, which is good for gastrointestinal absorption.The problem is that there are two dishes: one is some yellowed green vegetables, and the other is the same dish of fried radishes that look seriously suspected to be burnt.Although it is said that people who are recovering from a serious illness should eat lightly, but light is light. What is the situation with this yellow and burnt food?\u201cAre the vegetables that the big kitchen sent you wilted?\u201d Wei Ruo asked.\u201cNo, the vegetables given by the big kitchen are quite fresh.\u201d Xiao Bei explained.In the past, it was possible to give them stale dishes, but recently the servants in the mansion dare not deduct their fees anymore.\u201cSo it was your cook who fried it for you?\u201d Wei Ruo asked.Hearing this, Xiaobei scratched his head embarrassingly: \u201cThat\u2026Miss, our cook is me\u2026I\u2019m not very good at cooking\u2026\u201dAfter thinking for a while, Xiaobei immediately added an explanation: \u201cBut my usual level can be higher, and I rarely burnt it. Today was an accident. I was thinking about the young master\u2019s medicine, so I burned it! \u201cThere are only two people in Yingzhuyuan. Although there is a small kitchen that can operate a small stove, there is no cook.Wei Ruo looked back at Xiumei.Without Wei Ruo opening her mouth, Xiumei already understood what she meant.\u201cMiss, how about I use these light bamboo shoots to cook a braised spring bamboo shoot in oil?\u201d Xiumei suggested.\u201cGo, you go to peel the bamboo shoots first, I\u2019ll go back and bring you some sweet potato starch.\u201d Wei Ruo said.The master and servant started to act separately. The two were so excited that Xiao Bei was very worried.Thinking of the choking food made by the eldest lady last time, Xiaobei dare not have any hope for this time.\u201cMaster, do you want to stop them?\u201d\u201cLet them go.\u201dDifferent from the rejection and impatience before, Wei Jin did not refuse this time either.Not long after, Wei Ruo came back with Xiumei, who was still holding a pot of steaming spring bamboo shoots in oil.Xiumei put the plate on Wei Jinyi\u2019s bedside table, and said, \u201cSecond young master, try these spring bamboo shoots, this time they are not spicy, so they won\u2019t choke you.\u201dWei Jin also looked over. The tender yellow bamboo shoots were wrapped in a tan thick sauce, glistening with oil, and dotted with green shallots.Compared with the two yellowed and burnt green vegetables and radishes made by Xiaobei, I don\u2019t know how many times more attractive.With the mentality of giving it a try, Wei Jin also took a piece into his mouth and chewed it carefully.This time, he didn\u2019t cough or choke. His expression was usually dull, and he wouldn\u2019t show any joyful things directly, so it was impossible to tell his evaluation of this plate of braised spring bamboo shoots through his expression for a while.\u201dThe taste is rich, fresh and delicious, with the sweetness of bamboo shoots and a complex aroma of sauce. What is that?\u201dWei Jin also looked up at Wei Ruo.\u201cSoy sauce, didn\u2019t I give you a jar?\u201dIt was indeed given away, but Wei Jinyi had never tasted it. He let Xiaobei dispose of it casually, and he didn\u2019t know where Xiaobei disposed of it.Xiaobei looked down at the ground guiltily, for fear that Wei Ruo would find out that he had randomly placed the presents from her.How did he know that the eldest lady didn\u2019t just say it casually, her soy sauce is really a secret soy sauce, and now it seems that the soy sauce that the eldest lady said has additional medicinal value is also true.\u201cHow is it better than those green vegetables and radishes?\u201d Wei Ruo smiled.\u201cYeah.\u201d Wei Jin also replied in a low voice, unable to hear the emotion.Wei Ruo watched Wei Jinyi finish a whole bowl of porridge and a whole plate of stewed spring bamboo shoots, and then returned to Songyuan with Xiumei with a smile on her face.As soon as Wei Ruo left, Wei Jin asked Xiaobei where the jar of soy sauce was going.\u201cI\u2019ll look for it!\u201d Xiao Bei quickly ran into the small kitchen to search, and found the ashes jar in the corner.Although there is dust on the surface, the jar is well sealed, and the contents inside should be fine.Xiaobei returned to Wei Jinyi\u2019s bedroom excitedly holding the jar of soy sauce.\u201cLook, young master, the jar is still here, well preserved.\u201d\u201cWell, save it.\u201d\u201cUnderstood, Master! I will put it in the safest place!\u201dDon\u2019t say that this soy sauce is so delicious, even if it is not delicious, it is the eldest lady\u2019s wish and they must treat it well.Now the relationship between their young master and eldest lady is different, they can be regarded as \u201cfriends of life and death\u201d!Don\u2019t worry, my sons and daughters, the heroine will start her business again, and she will soon open her first shop in Xingshan County.(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 35": "Chapter 35 - selling sweet potato leavesPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 35 Selling Sweet Potato LeavesIn the next few days, Xiaowei\u2019s Mansion returned to its former calm, and the relationship between Wei Ruo and his family members became colder than when he first arrived.Especially He Yun, when Yun was warm to Wei Ruo, Wei Ruo didn\u2019t respond very enthusiastically, but now that Yun is cold, Wei Ruo is even colder.Wei Yichen was a little worried about this, but Wei Ruo didn\u2019t care.She doesn\u2019t care how other people in the family treat her. She has several things on her hands that need to be busy.First of all, the sweet potatoes on Xiaoyang Mountain have already grown vine leaves.Sweet potato vine leaves (sweet potato leaves) are also a good food, which can be picked off and eaten as green vegetables, which is an additional benefit of sweet potatoes before they mature.And sweet potato vine leaves have an advantage. Pick as much as you can sell, and leave it in the ground if you can\u2019t sell it, providing nutrients for the underground sweet potato tubers.It was the first time picking sweet potato vine leaves, the nanny was a little uncertain, and Wei Ruo sent Xiumei over because it was inconvenient to go in and out.After Xiumei and the nanny met, the two directed the long-term worker to pick a part of the sweet potato fields. The picked sweet potato vine leaves were divided into handfuls, **** with straw, packed in baskets, and placed in a container that was convenient for transportation. On the bullock cart.For the first picking, considering that the common people didn\u2019t know enough about sweet potato vine leaves, Xiumei and the nanny only picked two baskets according to Wei Ruo\u2019s instructions.Then the bullock cart was transported to the market for sale, and it cost two cents a piece.This price is set by Wei Ruoding, it is not expensive, and the profit is small but the turnover is high.Wei Ruo\u2019s prices for agricultural products are generally not too high, and he pursues quantity to win; on the contrary, Wei Ruo will try to set as high a price as possible for some things that only dignitaries and wealthy children can afford.The sale of sweet potato vine leaves is also to better promote the sweet potato crop, and to prepare for the subsequent launch of a larger number of sweet potatoes.On the way to the market, the nanny went home and fried a large plate, and brought them to the market.After taking it to the market, use smaller zong leaves to roll into a funnel shape, and put the fried sweet potato vine leaves into it, each with only one bite.Let the long-term workers who help to transport help to yell: \u201cTwo pennies a piece, free tasting.\u201dDue to the lack of arable land in Xingshan County, vegetables are more expensive than those from other places. In addition, the bad weather in recent years has reduced the production of vegetables, and Japanese pirates have caused troubles, resulting in fewer caravans coming and going, and fewer vegetables from other places. , the final result is that the price of vegetables in Xingshan County is several times more expensive than elsewhere.The green and fresh vegetables worth two cents really attracted many people to watch.Although I haven\u2019t seen it, there are finished products to try.The nanny enthusiastically handed the rice dumpling leaves with fried sweet potato vine leaves to the onlookers.After learning that this is an edible vegetable with a refreshing and delicious taste, and the price is very affordable, some people began to buy it with the mentality of giving it a try.After a while, two baskets of sweet potato vine leaves were sold out.After leaving the market, Xiumei followed the nanny to their current residence.There is a shop in the front and a small house in the back. It is not a big place, but the nanny\u2019s family of three is very satisfied.Especially the location, the choice is very good, it is close to the Captain\u2019s Mansion, and the shop in front is in a busy street, so when the shop opens, there should be no worries about the traffic.Xiumei and Xu\u2019s family spent lunch in the small house together and then returned to Xiaowei\u2019s Mansion.When he came back, he brought Wei Ruo sweet potato vine leaves and some fungus vegetables. They were all prepared by the nanny\u2019s family for Wei Ruo, they were afraid that Wei Ruo would not be used to eating in the Xiaowei\u2019s mansion.After that, Wei Ruo asked Xiumei to guard the door of her room and not let anyone in.Then he went into the space by himself and collected the sweet potatoes planted on the two lands in the space.The speed of growing plants on the land in the space is different from that outside. The sweet potatoes on Xiaoyang Mountain in the north of the city have just grown full of sweet potato leaves, and the ones in her space are ready to be harvested.After collecting two baskets of sweet potatoes, the experience value of the space has increased a lot, and there are only less than 100 experience points left for the 1,000 experience points needed to upgrade.With the upgrade in sight, Wei Ruo is looking forward to the new seed that will be updated after the upgrade.Wei Ruo didn\u2019t transport the harvested sweet potatoes out of space, and it was too suspicious to conjure up two baskets of sweet potatoes out of thin air.Wei Ruo stored the sweet potatoes in the space after harvesting them. As long as the storage environment is dry, they will not go bad in a short time.Now it is inconvenient to transport it out of the space for sale, so let\u2019s keep it in the space and make it her backup food.In case of disaster at any time, there is a shortage of food and water, there is ready-made spare food and water in the space, at least it can guarantee that you will not starve to death.The next day Wei Ruo went to the south of the city in person, and with the documents Wei Mingting gave her, she was successfully let off by the guards at the south gate.In the south of the city, Wei Ruo chose a piece of flat land with convenient transportation and close to the water source as her experimental field.Let the two long-term workers assigned to her by Yun\u2019s carry out the work of weeding and plowing.Later, they were asked to carry water from a nearby river to irrigate the land every day.It is really puzzling to ask people to water every day when there is nothing planted on the ground.Moreover, Wei Ruo asked the long-term workers to turn the land into seedling fields that can grow rice. It was almost the Dragon Boat Festival, and the rice in other people\u2019s homes had grown beyond their knees. Not really know how to grow.Nanny Zhang and the two long-term workers have some opinions on this, and feel that Wei Ruo\u2019s operations are weird.After working for two days, Nanny Zhang couldn\u2019t help but mentioned to Wei Ruo: \u201cMiss, why don\u2019t you change some other crops? Although I haven\u2019t farmed for many years, when I was in my hometown, I often heard people say There is a time for everything, and there is a time for growing crops, melons, fruits and vegetables, after this time, it will not be able to grow well!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I know what I\u2019m doing, and I promise you will have time to sow rice after you clear the land.\u201d Of course Wei Ruo knows the importance of time.It will be June soon, and normal rice will definitely not be able to be planted.But the rice seeds in her space are varieties that can be used for both early and late rice.The early rice will bloom next month, while the late rice will not be sown until the sixth and seventh months of the lunar calendar, and she can fully catch up.In this way, she can also experiment with saline-alkali land improvement and late rice planting.If it succeeds, not only can the arable area of Xingshan County be greatly increased, but also two crops of rice can be planted a year, which can increase food production in both horizontal and vertical dimensions.\u201cThen what about the straw and rice bran for the melons, fruits and vegetables that the eldest lady asked us to collect?\u201d Madam Zhang asked again.\u201cThose will continue to be stored, and it will take some time. When the time comes, I will tell you how to use them.\u201d Wei Ruo said.Nurse Zhang looked at Wei Ruo\u2019s confident face, wanted to say something, but swallowed it back.Forget it, it\u2019s useless to say it, the eldest lady doesn\u2019t seem to be able to listen to persuasion.And the eldest lady also said that it is her fault that this matter cannot be done, and that she will be punished at that time, and it has nothing to do with her.(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I am afraid that my elder brother will work too **** me, and I am afraid that my elder brother will only focus on studying and forget to eat and starve myself. I don\u2019t care whether my elder brother can be admitted to the Jinshi, I only want my elder brother to be healthy Healthy and alive.\u201d\u201cNo, I will take good care of my body, eat enough for every meal, and will never starve myself, don\u2019t worry, sister.\u201d\u201cBrother, don\u2019t you want to eat my sweet-scented osmanthus cake?\u201d\u201cI want to eat what I want,\u201d Wei Yichen quickly reached for the sweet-scented osmanthus cake brought by Wei Qingwan, \u201cMy sister cooks delicious food, how can ordinary meals compare to it?\u201d\u201cBrother, I heard that my sister has been going out frequently these days, and even went to the wasteland in the south of the city, but is it true?\u201d\u201cit is true.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it difficult to grow crops on the land over there?\u201d Wei Qingwan looked puzzled and curious.\u201cIt\u2019s quite difficult, but it doesn\u2019t matter. If Er says she has a way, let her try it. If she succeeds, it\u2019s a great achievement. If she doesn\u2019t succeed, there is no big loss.\u201dWei Yichen\u2019s opinion is the same as Wei Mingting\u2019s.\u201cSister is so kind, she can go out and do what she wants freely.\u201d Wei Qingwan couldn\u2019t help but let out a sigh of emotion, with a deep sense of envy in her expression.Wei Yichen said with a smile: \u201cWhy, Wanwan wants to go out too? Could it be that you also want to learn from Ruoer to farm? Then you can\u2019t, we Wanwan can\u2019t stand the wind and the sun.\u201d\u201cBrother, you are laughing at me again.\u201d\u201cBrother is not joking, he loves you. Ruoer is also because she likes it and is used to doing these things, otherwise I would not want her to go outside and make troubles.\u201d Wei Yichen said with a smile.\u201cYeah\u2026 Farm work is very hard. I don\u2019t know how Madam Li is doing now\u2026\u201d Wei Qingwan\u2019s expression became sad.Seeing her like this, Wei Yichen comforted her: \u201cWanwan, Nanny Li did something wrong and should be punished. Brother knows that you have a very good relationship with her, but if this matter is not severely punished, it will definitely breed a slavish atmosphere in the family. It must be guarded against.\u201d\u201cI know, it\u2019s just that Mammy is so old. She has been in Zhuangzi for three months, and she hasn\u2019t been in Zhuangzi for a long time. I\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t be able to stand it\u2026\u201dWei Qingwan looked worried, and when she mentioned that Nanny Li might not be able to hold on, her eyes turned red involuntarily.Wei Yichen frowned: \u201cBrother knows that you and Nanny Li have a good relationship, and also understands your worries. How about this, I will tell the manager of the Zhuangzi later and ask him to help take care of it, and arrange a relatively light one for Nanny Li. Some work.\u201dWei Qingwan pursed her lips, \u201cThank you, brother.\u201d\u201cStupid girl, don\u2019t say such things. Big brother knows you. You are the most soft-hearted and kind-hearted, but you should be punished if you are a slave. Being too kind may harm yourself.\u201d Wei Yichen said.\u201cYes.\u201d Wei Qingwan agreed in a low voice.###In a blink of an eye, the Dragon Boat Festival arrived.The custom of celebrating the Dragon Boat Festival in Xingshan County is relatively simple. Every household puts calamus with peach leaves and eats zongzi.Xiaowei Mansion is no exception.The only thing to be happy about is that Wei Mingting got a day off.It was rare to be at home with the children, and it was the first Dragon Boat Festival since Wei Ruo came to Wei\u2019s house, so Wei Mingting wanted to take the children for a walk on the street.Although the Dragon Boat Festival in Xingshan County does not have any large-scale activities, it is at least more lively than usual.Wei Ruo was rarely interested, and asked Xiumei to help her dress up early in the morning.\u201cMiss, you were not so happy when you went to burn incense and pray with your wife last time.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s different, today is going to the street.\u201dNo way. Now that I am in a boudoir, it is not so easy to go out.Although she took care of the wasteland in the south of the city, but Yun told her that if she had something to do, she would try to order the people below to do it.All in all, all in all, there is no chance of going out!When passing Yingzhu Garden, Wei Ruo stopped and looked into the courtyard gate, seeing that Wei Jinyi was still sitting in the octagonal pavilion, reading and writing.It seems that he has no place to go out today.Didn\u2019t Wei Mingting treat Wei Jinyi pretty well? Why did Wei Jinyi leave Wei Jinyi behind when everyone celebrated together?Could it be that Wei Mingting in the original book arranged a small kitchen for Wei Jinyi, and gave him the same monthly schedule as the first-born young master, just caring on the surface, but actually didn\u2019t care so much about this bastard?Wei Ruo didn\u2019t think too much about it, it\u2019s useless for her to think too much about this kind of thing.Just as she was about to leave, Wei Jin also spotted her.\u201cCome in if you want.\u201d Wei Jin also said to Wei Ruo.\u201cNo, I\u2019m going out.\u201d Wei Ruo waved his hand.\u201cUm.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be sad, my father may want you to rest well because you have just recovered from a serious illness.\u201dHaving said all this, Wei Ruo comforted her a few words, otherwise she would appear to be an idiot, knowing that Wei Jin would not go out on the street and told him to go out.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about me so much, I\u2019m fine, I don\u2019t want to go out.\u201d Wei Jin also replied.\u201cOh, it\u2019s fine!\u201d\u201cWell, you have fun.\u201d Wei Jin also reminded.\u201cThen I\u2019m leaving.\u201d Wei Ruo waved his hand, turned and left.Wei Jin also stared at Wei Ruo\u2019s distant direction. The thirteen-year-old girl was delicate and agile, like a free bird or a blooming spring flower.Wei Jinyi didn\u2019t look away until she was completely out of sight.When Wei Ruo came to the door of the house, everyone in the family was present except Wei Jinyi, and Wei Ruo was the last one to arrive.For this trip, the family prepared a carriage and two horses.Wei Mingting and Wei Yichen rode horses, and the female relatives and the young Wei Yilin rode in a car.Compared to the previous ones, the streets of Xingshan County today are indeed much more lively than in the past.After walking for a while, a large crowd of people appeared in front of the road, blocking the road. The carriage of the Wei family was forced to stop.Looking from a distance, it is the entrance of a shop, with several tables surrounded by a group of people.Beside it, there are several shelves supported by bamboo poles, and a row of calligraphy works are hung on them.Yun raised the car curtain a crack and asked, \u201cWhat is this doing in front?\u201d(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It opened a branch in Xingshan County, and competed in calligraphy and writing. The winner will get the calligraphy of Tibetan forest dwellers.\u201d\u201cSibaozhai? The paper your father brought back last time seems to be from Sibaozhai.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s this Sibaozhai!\u201d Wei Yichen said excitedly.\u201cThere is also the Tibetan monk, is he a famous gentleman in Huzhou Prefecture? I heard your father mention him last time. The article is very good. He used to be an academician of the Imperial Academy. After he retired, he lived in seclusion in Huzhou Prefecture. , planted a bamboo forest in front of the house, and regarded himself as a layman in the Tibetan forest.\u201d\u201cIt is this person!\u201dThat\u2019s why Wei Yichen is so excited now.Whether it\u2019s the paper from Sibaozhai or the ink treasures of Tibetan Buddhists, Wei Yichen is very interested.Seeing his son\u2019s thoughts, Yun said, \u201cThen why are you still standing there? In terms of calligraphy and writing, my son is one of the best in Xingshan County.\u201dHearing this, Wei Yichen looked at his father at the side again.Wei Mingting agreed: \u201cGo, as a father, I also want to see my son\u2019s literary talent.\u201d\u201cThe son has gone.\u201dWei Yichen walked into the crowd excitedly.Wei Mingting said to several people in the carriage: \u201cYou guys also get out of the carriage and take a walk.\u201dAfter Wei Mingting had spoken, the Yun family let go of the three children, asked Wei Qingwan and Wei Ruo to put on their veiled hats, and told their maids to follow them closely.As for Wei Yilin, she watched in person, so that the child would not know where he went.After getting out of the car, Wei Ruo and Xiumei squeezed into the crowd, surrounding the audience to compete for the calligraphy of the Tibetan Layman.Both of them had excitement on their faces. Although they were not as good as Wei Yichen, they were obviously more concerned about other things, especially Wei Ruo.The content of the competition is very simple. Participants will make a short essay on the spot according to the given topic and write it on paper.Finally, judge the pros and cons according to the content of the article and the quality of calligraphy.The shopkeeper of Sibaozhai, who presided over this competition, was a middle-aged man with a beard. He was slightly fat and had a simple and honest smile.He warmly greeted every attracted student, explained the rules of the competition to them, and invited them to participate.The pens, inks, papers and inkstones used in the competition are all provided by their Sibaozhai.After Wei Yichen squeezed into the crowd, the shopkeeper introduced him with a smile.\u201cYoung master, you only need to write some thoughts according to the topic. We don\u2019t compare the content of the article, but only the calligraphy.\u201d\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll try. Please give me a pen and paper from the shopkeeper.\u201dThe shopkeeper hurriedly asked the waiter to prepare new paper and pens for Wei Yichen.Under the watchful eyes of everyone, Wei Yichen wrote about a hundred words eloquently.The pen is vigorous and powerful, and the full and round handwriting immediately aroused a burst of applause from the audience.After finishing writing, the shopkeeper did not comment, but asked the waiter to hang up Wei Yichen\u2019s work carefully.At this time, there are already many secondary works hanging on the shelf next to it, all of which were written by those who participated in the competition today. Everyone hangs them side by side, so that anyone passing by can appreciate and judge.A luxuriously decorated carriage in the distance has been parked in place for a while.The people in the car are also looking this way.\u201cBrother Yu, are you interested too?\u201d Chu Lan asked Lu Yuhong who had been watching the excitement beside him.Lu Yuhong quickly shook his head: \u201cYour Highness, please don\u2019t make fun of me. I can do martial arts competitions, horseback riding, archery, cuju, and kill the enemy in battle. I can\u2019t compare calligraphy and literary talent. I just think this store is interesting, but I managed to make it when it opened. These are novel tricks, and they even used calligraphy treasures of Laymen in the Tibetan forest as prizes, so I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s true or not.\u201d\u201cIndeed, there are more methods than ordinary shops.\u201d Chu Lan commented, his tone was rather dull, and he was not as eager as Lu Yuhong.\u201cBy the way, is the person on the horse over there from the Zhongyi House in the capital? It looks familiar.\u201d Lu Yuhong asked.Following the direction Lu Yuhong pointed, Chu Lan saw Wei Mingting.\u201cIt\u2019s him, the third son of Uncle Zhongyi, Wei Mingting, the current lieutenant of Cong Liupin Zhongxian.\u201d\u201cYour Highness still remembers clearly, I can\u2019t remember these, and I can\u2019t remember the ones left in the capital, let alone the ones outside the capital.\u201d\u201cUncle Zhongyi\u2019s mansion, including Uncle Zhongyi himself, is a group of people without long bones. Wei Mingting is the only exception. It\u2019s a pity that he is only reckless and doesn\u2019t know how to adapt. Otherwise, he would have left this place a long time ago.\u201d Chu Lan commented .\u201cIt\u2019s no wonder that Uncle Zhongyi\u2019s mansion has been in a slump these years. It\u2019s a pity that there are no successors. It\u2019s a pity. I also heard from my father that Uncle Zhongyi was a famous founder of the country!\u201dAlthough Lu Yuhong came from a scholarly family, he inexplicably admired those who practiced martial arts, especially those famous generals who had done heroic deeds.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Chu Lan suddenly opened the curtain of the car and got up.\u201cWhere to?\u201d\u201cCompetition.\u201d\u201cEh? Your Highness, are you interested?\u201d Lu Yuhong chased after him curiously.Chu Lan didn\u2019t answer, and went straight to the crowd.The competition is still going on, almost everyone has tried it, and the works have been hung up for everyone to see.Among many works, Wei Yichen\u2019s is obviously the most eye-catching one.It is also the one that attracts the most people to watch.Yun\u2019s right, when it comes to calligraphy, Wei Yichen is definitely one of the best in Xingshan County.After he participated in the competition, the others were compared by him.Victory is in sight, Wei Qingwan is very happy for Wei Yichen.At this moment, a man in brocade clothes came over.\u201cI\u2019ll try it too.\u201dEveryone consciously made way for the man in brocade clothes.Just from the man\u2019s attire and the entourage behind him, it is not difficult to guess that this person\u2019s identity is unusual.Wei Mingting also looked over, startled.He couldn\u2019t confirm the identity of the person in front of him, but he could see the clue from the accessories of the man\u2019s entourage.Wei Ruo recognized the man\u2019s identity at a glance\u2014the Seventh Prince Chu Lan.is the hero of the original book, and also the person who executed himself in the original book.Thinking of this, Wei Ruo subconsciously walked towards the periphery of the crowd, putting distance between himself and the two.Although she didn\u2019t know what it was useful for, she just instinctively wanted to keep a distance from what she thought was a dangerous factor.Wei Ruo looked at Wei Qingwan again, and saw that Wei Qingwan was looking at Chu Lan.Chu Lan was supposed to meet Wei Qingwan at Fahua Temple, but she missed it because of her absence as a supporting role.Could it be that this belated encounter is about to happen today?(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

If he is a local nobleman in Xingshan County, their Wei family must know about it.\u201cPlease, sir.\u201d The shopkeeper smiled and asked the waiter in the store to put a new paper.Chu Lan stepped forward, seeing the paper in front of him, a hint of surprise appeared on his stern face.Stretching out his hand to caress the paper, his surprise grew stronger.This paper is different from the one he used in the past. Why is there such a remote place with good paper that is not even available in the capital?\u201cWhere did this paper come from?\u201d Chu Lan asked the shopkeeper.The shopkeeper replied with a smile: \u201cThis is the paper exclusively sold by our Sibaozhai. If you like it, you can buy some after my shop opens. After today\u2019s competition is over, our shop will officially open.\u201dChu Lan looked up at the shop behind the shopkeeper. On the plaque was written the three characters \u201cSibaozhai\u201d.Chu Lan said \u201cInteresting\u201d, and then picked up a pen and paper to write.The shopkeeper\u2019s title is \u201cFood is the Heaven of the People\u201dChu Lan picked up a pen and wrote about a hundred words.The handwriting is grand and powerful, the strokes are domineering, and they open and close.The audience applauded immediately and said several \u201cgood\u201d words.Xiao Er also hung up Chu Lan\u2019s writing, right next to Wei Yichen\u2019s.Put the two characters together, the contrast is very obvious, Wei Yichen\u2019s handwriting is much gentler.The shopkeeper asked everyone if there were still people who wanted to participate in the competition. After asking three times, he confirmed that there was no one, and gave everyone present a wooden sign.The wooden sign is engraved with three simple characters of \u201cSibaozhai\u201d, and it is worn with a red string.\u201cToday\u2019s judges are everyone present. Whoever you think has the best handwriting will hang the wooden plaque on the hook on that person\u2019s work. In the end, the person with the most wooden plaques will win the day.\u201dLooking at the wooden sign in his hand, Lu Yuhong smiled, and said to Chu Lan in a low voice, \u201cIt\u2019s really interesting that the onlookers are allowed to vote to decide the winner.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a smart choice.\u201d Chu Lan said.This method of evaluation allows the organizers of the competition not to offend others, and as a newly opened shop, the last thing they can do is to offend others.Lu Yuhong smiled and asked Chu Lan: \u201cIf I don\u2019t vote for you, can I go back tonight?\u201dChu Lan: \u201cThen you have to think clearly.\u201dLu Yuhong: \u201cNo way, I thought you were just playing around, why do you still have the will to win?\u201dChu Lan: \u201cIt is indeed more interesting than I thought.\u201dLu Yuhong: \u201cI just said this store is quite interesting!\u201dVoting begins.The spectators who got the wooden sign cast their votes one after another.Not surprisingly, Wei Yichen and Chu Lan\u2019s works have the largest number of wooden plaques, far ahead of other works.Wei Qingwan also got a wooden sign. She knew that her wooden sign was definitely going to vote for her eldest brother, but before hanging the wooden sign, she involuntarily glanced at the young man in brocade clothes.I don\u2019t know who will win, the son or the elder brother.Wei Ruo also got one, she quickly hung the wooden sign on the hook above Wei Yichen\u2019s work, and then ran away at the speed of light.The voting ended, and the treasurer counted all the wooden signs in front of everyone.The others had only three or five votes, nothing to look at, and Wei Yichen and Chu Lan got the most attention.Twenty wooden plaques are counted on the hook above Chu Lan\u2019s work.Twenty-one wooden plaques are counted on the hook above Wei Yichen\u2019s work.Wei Yichen narrowly won by only one vote.The shopkeeper smiled and said to Chu Lan: \u201cMy lord, I\u2019m sorry, there is one short, and I will sentence you to lose. Do you have any objections?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Chu Lan replied, \u201cSince participating in your competition, you must abide by your rules. There is no problem with your process.\u201d\u201cVery well, then I will announce that the one who won the first place today is this young man in white.\u201dShopkeeper Jia looked at Wei Yichen with a smile.Wei Yichen walked up to Chu Lan and made a bow: \u201cThank you, young master. The reason why I narrowly beat you today is probably because my two younger sisters were also assigned wooden cards. Otherwise, the young master should have won.\u201d\u201cIf you lose, you lose. You have a sister, and I have a good friend here. There is nothing to say.\u201d Not only was Chu Lan not angry, she seemed to be in a good mood, with a faint smile on her lips.Compared with the Tibetan Layman\u2019s Calligraphy, he has something more interesting.Wei Yichen nodded, but didn\u2019t say anything.The shopkeeper put the painting scroll containing Layman Lin into a wooden box and handed it to Wei Yichen.Then he announced: \u201cThe paper you used just now is sold in the store. If you need it, you can enter the store to buy it. Each person is limited to 50 sheets per day. The quantity is limited and it will only be sold out.\u201dAll the students who just took part in the competition have already used the paper and pens of Sibaozhai. The pens and inks are average, and there is not much difference from other places, but this paper is quite different.Although it is more expensive than other places, the quality is much better.And this price is also acceptable to wealthy families.As soon as the purchase limit was heard, the quantity was limited, and people immediately crowded into the store. I\u2019m afraid I won\u2019t be able to buy it too late.After a while, there was a long queue at the entrance of Sibaozhai, and the scene was very lively.This is a rare scene in Xingshan County, where the economic situation is not very prosperous.It can be seen that it is the people at the bottom who are having a hard time. Those families who can support a scholar can still spend money to buy good pens, inks, papers and inkstones.Wei Yichen also asked the boy to queue up to buy some more for himself.Not long after, shopkeeper Jia announced that today\u2019s paper has been sold out, and if necessary, he can only come back tomorrow.Knowing that it was sold out, those who didn\u2019t buy it showed disappointment.The crowd dispersed, but Wei Qingwan was still in the crowd, looking around, subconsciously looking for the figure of the noble young master just now.Wei Yichen held her back: \u201cWanwan, what are you looking at?\u201d\u201cI\u2026I\u2019m looking for my sister\u2026\u201dWei Yichen looked around, but he did not find Wei Ruo.Wei Ruo had already walked away at the end of the competition, and wandered around other nearby shops.Wei Yichen found Wei Ruo in a preserved fruit shop on the street.Wei Ruo has just bought a few large bags of preserved fruit and is about to come back.Seeing what Wei Ruo bought, Wei Yichen glanced at it and felt that it was a bit too much, but instead of criticizing Wei Ruo, he said, \u201cMy sister likes to eat preserved fruit. Next time I will bring it to you. You don\u2019t have to stock up so much at once. Keep it for a long time.\u201d It\u2019s not fresh.\u201dWei Yichen thought that Wei Ruo rarely had the chance to go out, and it was rare to have the opportunity to come out today, and he bought so many because he was afraid that he would not have the chance to buy later.Wei Ruo smiled, did not agree or refute, and followed Wei Yichen back to his family.After returning, Wei Yichen asked Wei Mingting: \u201cFather, the young master just now looks like he has an unusual identity. Does father know who he is?\u201d(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 39": "Chapter 39 - behind the scenes bossPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 39 The Boss Behind the ScenesXingshan County is only so big, if there are such dignitaries, it is impossible for them not to know.\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be from Xingshan County, but I can\u2019t think of who it is.\u201d Wei Mingting was also observing the young man with a face just now, but he didn\u2019t remember who it was.Yun guessed: \u201cIt can\u2019t be the nobleman who lives in the meditation room of Fahua Temple?\u201dXingshan County rarely has big names coming, so it is impossible for two people to come at once by such a coincidence.\u201cIt\u2019s possible.\u201d Wei Mingting agreed.\u201cThen husband, will your honor offend our family because of what happened that day and because Yichen won the competition today?\u201d Yun\u2019s worries became even more serious.\u201cDon\u2019t think about it so much, if you really get angry because of these trivial matters, I have nothing to say. Besides, judging from the young master\u2019s performance just now, he doesn\u2019t seem like a narrow-minded person.\u201d Wei Mingting said.He behaved upright and sat upright, and the imperial court wanted to punish him for the crime of being unfavorable to the Japanese, but if he was punished for such a trivial matter, it would be really unfair.After discussing the identity of Mr. Jinyi to no avail, Wei Yichen gave Wei Mingting the calligraphy of the Layman in the Tibetan forest that he had won.Wei Mingting refused: \u201cYou can keep it for yourself, as my father knows that you like this Tibetan layman very much, and you have even always wanted to worship him as your teacher.\u201dWei Ruo, who was about to get into the carriage, turned her head and glanced at Wei Yichen when she heard this, but soon she turned back, got into the carriage, and gnawed on the preserved fruit.Wei Qingwanruo, who was sitting opposite Wei Ruo, looked out thoughtfully through the crack of the car window, and the appearance of the young man just now kept appearing in her mind.I thought about what my parents said just now, that the son was probably a nobleman in Fahua Temple that day, and I was worried whether I left a bad impression on him that day.If it is really a nobleman in Fahua Temple, then it is a member of the royal family. Why did the royal family come to such a small place as Xingshan County?###After the competition, Chu Lan did not leave immediately. He also asked his followers to line up to buy paper and come back.Holding the paper in his hand, Chu Lan became more and more sure that these papers were much better than those sold in the capital.Lu Yuhong could also see that the paper Chu Lan bought was different from what they usually used, thicker, whiter, and more delicate and smooth.\u201cI really can\u2019t see it. This shop is really famous. Not only does it attract customers with all kinds of tricks, but it also sells better products than other places. It\u2019s a bit of a waste of talent to open this shop here. It should be opened in the capital. Go! The business must be a hundred times better than this!\u201d Lu Yuhong commented.\u201cBrother Yu, it\u2019s not that easy to open a shop in the capital.\u201d Chu Lan said.\u201cOh, that\u2019s right, the capital is no smaller than this kind of place.\u201d Lu Yuhong nodded.Said that Lu Yuhong jokingly said to Chu Lan: \u201cYour Highness, since their paper is so good and so popular with literati, tell me, if I go to talk to their boss and see if they can provide me with supplies, I will Help him open a shop in the capital, so I can earn some money!\u201dNo one would think that they have a lot of money, even if it is a son of a family like Lu Yuhong.\u201cYou can try it, just don\u2019t be treated as a robber.\u201d\u201cIt must not be, am I like that kind of bastard? If I want to oppress the people, my grandfather was the first to beat me to death with a whip!\u201d###The competition is over, and today\u2019s paper is sold out.Shopkeeper Jia closed the shop, and then entered the small courtyard behind the shop, where stood a burly and honest peasant man.When shopkeeper Jia came in, the farmer was chopping firewood.Shopkeeper Jia walked up to him and reported to him the situation of the competition held today and the sales situation of the store.Overall, very successful. With just a pair of Tibetan Layman calligraphy and a small competition, Sibao Zhai was promoted in Xingshan County, and 7,200 sheets of paper were successfully sold.\u201cOkay, thank you for your hard work.\u201d Xu Zhushan agreed with a silly smile.Looking at Xu Zhushan\u2019s simple and honest appearance, shopkeeper Jia didn\u2019t know how many times he felt inconceivable. A person who looks quite dull has so many ideas.For example, Xu Zhushan taught him the method of soliciting business today, and he, the shopkeeper, just followed it.Shopkeeper Jia is not sure whether their boss is pretending or being stupid.After a brief moment of inner emotion, the shopkeeper continued to say to Xu Zhushan: \u201cBesides, a son came to the store just now and asked me about the boss, and I answered according to what you told me before, saying that our boss doesn\u2019t see customers. \u201c\u201cOh, good.\u201d\u201cThe young master said that he came to cooperate with you, boss, and wanted to get goods from you, and open a store in the capital. I remember you mentioned it, because the daily goods are limited, so it is absolutely impossible Will cooperate with others, and will not provide others with a source of paper, so I will repeat the boss\u2019s meaning to that person.\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201d Xu Zhushan nodded.\u201cBoss, I\u2019m sorry to be curious, but we only sell so much paper every day. Is the supply really tight?\u201d Shopkeeper Jia couldn\u2019t help his curiosity.\u201cYes.\u201d Xu Zhushan replied.Immediately afterwards, Xu Zhushan thought about an important thing: \u201cBy the way, starting tomorrow, we can no longer just sell paper, we need to\u2026\u201dHalfway through talking, Xu Zhushan got stuck, and after serious thinking for a while, he continued, \u201cI only bought it together with the pen, ink and inkstone in the store. There is a piece of paper specifically, and I will show it to you!\u201dXu Zhushan ran back to the house, and when he ran back after a while, he was holding a piece of paper in his hand, on which a page of words were densely written, the handwriting was not very good-looking, and it looked like a seven or eight-year-old child\u2019s handwriting.Shopkeeper Jia took the paper and looked at it. Surprised, he shouted wit!Of the four treasures of the study sold in their shop, only paper is special, and the other three are ordinary goods that are also sold in other shops.This also led to the fact that only paper is the best seller in the shop, and other things are rarely sold.Like today they sold out of paper, and four pieces of pens, inks, and inkstones combined.However, the paper that Xu Zhushan gave him clearly stated the purchase rules of the store in the future. A \u201cdistribution system\u201d must be implemented. If you buy paper directly, you can only buy 20 sheets at most, but if you buy it with other things in the store, you can buy it together. Buy fifty, or even eighty sheets.After reading it, shopkeeper Jia still had doubts: \u201cBoss, if we sell it like this, will those people refuse to buy it?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay, just sell it like this. We don\u2019t force it. If you don\u2019t want to, you can still buy 20 copies.\u201d Xu Zhushan said.Shopkeeper Jia nodded, \u201cThen I will sell as this tomorrow. I will leave today and come back tomorrow.\u201d Shopkeeper Jia said goodbye to Xu Zhushan.\u201cAlright, you\u2019ve worked hard.\u201d Xu Zhushan nodded.After Xu Zhushan collected the account books, he was ready to pick up his mother-in-law. The mother-in-law has been busy with things on the mountain these days, and she has lost weight. At night, she has to kill a chicken to make up for her.Xu Zhushan smiled foolishly as he carried the bamboo basket in the yard. The bamboo basket can help his wife carry things, and if there is pigweed on the roadside, he can also cut some pigweed back.(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 40": "Chapter 40 - father teaching horseback riding and archeryPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 40 Father teaches horseback riding and archeryAfter the Wei family wandered around the street, Wei Mingting led them to the school grounds.The school yard is where the soldiers train. In the past, outsiders were not allowed to enter here, even the family members of the school captain\u2019s mansion.But recently, the soldiers are sticking to the front line, and the usual training place has been changed to a place closer to the east gate, so the school grounds are now idle, with only a few guards guarding the gate.Wei Mingting brought a few children here, and wanted to use this rare vacation time to teach them how to ride horses.Among the children, except for the eldest son who can ride, he has not had time to teach them the rest.Wei Mingting planned to let his two daughters try horseback riding, and it happened that he and his eldest son taught each other. Wei Mingting chose to teach Wei Ruo, and left the work of teaching Wei Qingwan to the eldest son.As for the youngest son Wei Yilin, Yun Shi watched and practiced riding a pony cub.Wei Yilin usually behaves like a monkey at home, but today when Wei Mingting is present, he is much better behaved and dare not have any petty temper.Wei Mingting led his mount \u201csickle\u201d to Wei Ruo, and asked Wei Ruo: \u201cRuoer, do you dare to try?\u201dWei Ruo nodded, she hasn\u2019t ridden a horse yet after traveling for so long!\u201cFather, let me teach you, this is the stirrup, you need to put your feet here, this is the saddle, and this is the rein\u2026\u201d Wei Mingting carefully explained the precautions for riding a horse to Wei Ruo.Wei Ruo listened carefully, and when Wei Mingting finished speaking and asked her to try, Wei Ruo stepped on the stirrup without hesitation, turned over and sat on it.The movements are neat and unrestrained, done in one go, without any hesitation or fear.Wei Mingting was still thinking about whether to find a stool for his daughter, but Wei Ruo had already ridden it.After realizing it, Wei Mingting smiled and said, \u201cRuoer, you are more decisive than your brother. I think that when Big Brother Ni first learned how to ride a horse, he still hesitated for a long time.\u201dBeside him, Wei Yichen, who was in charge of teaching Wei Qingwan, heard his father bury him, and protested with a smile: \u201cMy lord father, why did you even tell your sister about this? Where do you want me to be as a brother?\u201dWei Mingting replied: \u201cYou earn your face, not for your father to cover it up for you.\u201dWei Yichen hurriedly said: \u201cOkay, my son is useless, not as good as my sister Ruo\u2019er! We Ruo\u2019er are heroines among women, and women do not give way to men!\u201dListening to Wei Yichen\u2019s praiseworthy words, Wei Ruo, who was being praised, didn\u2019t feel anything, but Wei Qingwan, who was beside Wei Yichen, lowered her head in frustration.When Wei Yichen turned his head, he saw Wei Qingwan with her head bowed and her expression sad.\u201cWanwan, what\u2019s wrong with you? Are you uncomfortable?\u201d Wei Yichen asked hurriedly.\u201cIt\u2019s okay\u2026 It\u2019s just that I\u2019m a bit too stupid, not as good as my sister, who can quickly master the essentials of riding a horse\u2026\u201d\u201cWanwan, don\u2019t think so, Wanwan has things that Wanwan is good at, has advantages of Wanwan, and there are many things that you are good at that Ruo\u2019er is not good at. For example, Wanwan, the cakes you make are very delicious, and you The embroidery, calligraphy, and poems are all excellent, these are incomparable to Ruo\u2019er, Wanwan doesn\u2019t have to be the best in everything, that would be too tiring.\u201d Wei Yichen comforted.\u201cYes.\u201d Wei Qingwan agreed in a low voice.\u201cOkay, brother will continue to teach you.\u201d Wei Yichen continued to patiently explain the essentials of horse riding to Wei Qingwan.Just as Wei Yichen spoke to Wei Qingwan, Wei Ruo started to run on a horse, running round and round around the grass in the school field.Wei Ruo on the horseback smiled flamboyantly, without the timidity of riding a horse for the first time.Seeing his daughter\u2019s wanton and unrestrained appearance, Wei Mingting sighed with some relief: \u201cI didn\u2019t expect Ruo\u2019er to be the person who resembles me the most. If she were a man, she might be able to fight with my father and son on the battlefield.\u201dMr. Yun also noticed the gratified expression on her husband\u2019s face when he looked at his daughter, and couldn\u2019t help being happy.Ruoer is the daughter of their husband and wife after all, and she has the shadow of a husband in her body.Thinking of this, Yun\u2019s look at Wei Ruo has softened a lot. Since the last incident, Yun\u2019s attitude towards Wei Ruo has been a lot colder, but today\u2019s encounter has made Yun\u2019s psychology a little bit Variety.After riding a horse for a while, Wei Mingting brought a bow and arrow to Wei Ruo to try again.\u201cArchery is different from riding a horse. It will be more difficult. Just try it. If it doesn\u2019t work, don\u2019t force yourself.\u201d Wei Mingting said first.Wei Mingting originally only planned to teach his two daughters how to ride a horse today, and did not intend to let them try archery. After all, archery is still too difficult for the girls.But Wei Ruo\u2019s riding performance just now made Wei Mingting change his mind.Wei Mingting gave Wei Ruo a demonstration, nocking, drawing, and shooting.Wei Mingting seems to be a natural born warrior, a natural born soldier. As soon as he holds a bow and arrow in his hand, his whole aura changes. There is an indescribable majesty and courage, and his tense muscles seem to be able to burst out infinite power.And the arrows he shot also confirmed this point. The arrow hit the bull\u2019s-eye.Wei Mingting handed the bow into Wei Ruo\u2019s hand, and said, \u201cRuo\u2019er also come and try.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Wei Ruo took the bow, imitating Wei Mingting\u2019s action just now, took an arrow from the quiver, and put it on the bowstring.Wei Ruo got started very quickly, and quickly mastered the essentials of archery, and was able to shoot the arrow successfully.But the strength and accuracy are very limited:In terms of strength, Wei Mingting can draw the bow into a \u201cfull moon\u201d, but Wei Ruo can only do \u201ca gibbous moon\u201d;As for the accuracy, not to mention the bullseye, it is good if you don\u2019t miss the target. After shooting ten arrows, only two landed on the target.While watching Wei Mingting shoot an arrow, he thought it wasn\u2019t too difficult, but it wasn\u2019t until he got used to it that he realized that it\u2019s really not something that anyone can do.Wei Ruo glanced at the bow and arrow in his hand with some annoyance, why is this broken arrow so unruly?Wei Mingting looked at his daughter\u2019s little expression and smiled: \u201cRuoer, don\u2019t worry, take your time, it\u2019s your first day of trying today, it\u2019s already very good.\u201dWei Mingting is not trying to comfort Wei Ruo, he is really doing well, not to mention a girl, even a man, his first archery might not be as fast as Wei Ruo\u2019s.Not far away, Wei Qingwan, who was still learning how to ride a horse with Wei Yichen, saw Wei Mingting\u2019s kind expression towards Wei Ruo.After thinking for a while, Wei Qingwan said to Wei Yichen: \u201cBrother, I also want to try archery.\u201d\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll take you there.\u201d Wei Yichen didn\u2019t know what Wei Qingwan was thinking, she said she wanted to go archery, so she took her there.Today, Japan brings younger siblings to the school grounds to play. It doesn\u2019t matter whether you learn or not, as long as you have fun.Wei Yichen and Wei Qingwan came to Wei Mingting, and after explaining the situation to Wei Mingting, Wei Mingting asked his subordinates to bring another bow.After Wei Qingwan took the bow, she imitated Wei Mingting\u2019s demonstration and prepared to draw the bow.In the original book, the father died in battle not long after, so the later death of the original owner (Wei Ruo) has nothing to do with his father.The heroine of the original book (Wei Qingwan) is set to be the kind of miserable, white, and pitiful type who needs the protection of the heroine.Finally, continue to ask for tickets~(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 41": "Chapter 41 - I made you suffer for my fatherPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 41 I made you suffer for my fatherWei Qingwan exerted all her strength for a long time, but the bow in her hand was only drawn by a small arc, and the arrow on the bow also fell to the ground because of her trembling hands.Wei Yichen comforted Wei Qingwan while helping Wei Qingwan pick up the dropped arrow: \u201cDon\u2019t worry Wanwan, archery is difficult, and father\u2019s bow is too hard, it\u2019s normal for you to be unable to draw it. Big Brother also shot arrows with you for the first time. almost the same.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll try again.\u201d Wei Qingwan opened his bow again.This time she used more strength, and then let out a soft cry, and at the same time the bow and arrow in her hand fell to the ground.\u201cWanwan, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d Wei Yichen hurriedly checked Wei Qingwan\u2019s hand.Wei Mingting, who was teaching Wei Ruo, also walked up to Wei Qingwan after hearing the voice, checking on her situation, with deep concern in his eyes.\u201cI\u2019m fine. I\u2019m useless. I didn\u2019t draw the bow, and I was scratched by the bowstring.\u201d Wei Qingwan blamed herself.Wei Yichen spread Wei Qingwan\u2019s hand, and saw a deep red mark on the finger she used to pull the bowstring. Although the skin was not broken, the redness was particularly eye-catching on Wei Qingwan\u2019s fair and delicate skin.Wei Mingting frowned, and then said to Wei Yichen: \u201cYichen, go get some medicine to apply to Wanwan.\u201d\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll go right away.\u201d Wei Yichen hurriedly went back to find the externally applied wound medicine.Yun Shi and Wei Yilin also rushed over.Seeing that Wei Qingwan was injured, the two were very concerned and nervous.\u201cWanwan, show mother quickly, how did you do this? Stop practicing bows and arrows, your hands are not made for this.\u201d Yun said hurriedly.\u201cYes, sister, shall we play something else?\u201d Wei Yilin seconded.\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026 I\u2019m useless\u2026\u201d Wei Qingwan lowered her head in shame.\u201cWhat are you talking about? It has nothing to do with whether you are useful or not. Riding and archery is not something women should do.\u201d Yun said.\u201cSister, don\u2019t be afraid, I will protect you after I practice riding and shooting!\u201d Wei Yilin said, patting his chest.Wei Qingwan red-eyed: \u201cThank you, Yilin.\u201dImmediately afterwards, he said to Wei Mingting and Yun Shi: \u201cI\u2019m sorry father and mother, my daughter is fine, I\u2019m worried about you, my daughter is not filial.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s perfectly normal for parents to care about their children, so why not talk about filial piety.\u201d Yun said.Wei Mingting nodded, agreeing with his wife\u2019s remarks.\u201cOkay, don\u2019t cry, go back to the carriage with your mother and have a rest first.\u201d Yun Shi pulled Wei Qingwan away.Wei Yilin followed behind, like a little bodyguard.After Wei Qingwan left, Wei Mingting turned around and walked back to Wei Ruo.Suddenly thought of something, looked down at Wei Ruo\u2019s right hand.He caught a glimpse of bright red marks on Wei Ruo\u2019s fingers holding the bowstring.And because Wei Ruo opened his bow far more times than Wei Qingwan, the number of red marks on his hand is more and more obvious than Wei Qingwan\u2019s.\u201cRuoer, stop practicing.\u201d Wei Mingting immediately called Wei Ruo to stop.After Wei Ruo put down his bow and arrow, Wei Mingting asked, \u201cYou already have many red seals on your hand, why didn\u2019t you tell your father?\u201dWei Ruo glanced at the red mark on his hand, and replied calmly: \u201cIt\u2019s not broken, so it won\u2019t happen.\u201dRed marks of this degree are not considered injuries at all to Wei Ruo.Wei Ruo\u2019s words made Wei Mingting frowned and looked solemn.To him, this level of injury is really nothing, but girls are different. She was raised up pampered, so she is naturally inferior to him. He has always felt that a normal girl like Wanwan should Some look.Wei Mingting was silent for a while and then said: \u201cRuo\u2019er, being a father has made you suffer.\u201dWei Ruo raised his head and glanced at Wei Mingting, then quickly looked away and looked at the archery target in the distance.For a moment, Wei Ruo wanted to tell Wei Mingting that she didn\u2019t feel that life in the countryside was hard. There she had family and friends and had her own life.But she refrained from saying it, because these words were words that the Wei family didn\u2019t like to hear.In their view, it was her best choice for them to take her back and let her be the official lady, pampered and pampered.In order to change the subject, Wei Ruo took the initiative to ask Wei Mingting: \u201cDo all bows need so much strength? There is no such thing as a relatively light crossbow that can be used with one hand.\u201d\u201cYes, using Nu does not require too much strength, and it won\u2019t hurt your hands. Do you want to try Nu?\u201d Wei Mingting asked.Wei Ruo shook his head, \u201cI won\u2019t try it anymore, I\u2019m just a little curious why soldiers use bows more now than braids.\u201d\u201cBecause the speed of using the \u9a7d is slow, a skilled archer can shoot three arrows at the same time, while a \u9a7d hand can only shoot one arrow. When two armies are at war, the intensity of firepower is very important.\u201d Wei Mingting answered.\u201cIs that so.\u201d Wei Ruoruo thought.Seeing that Wei Ruo was interested in bows and crossbows, in order to better explain to Wei Ruo, Wei Mingting asked his followers to fetch the nu.Wei Mingting handed the Nu to Wei Ruo: \u201cCome on, Ruo\u2019er, take a look. This Nu can be loaded with one arrow at a time. After shooting, it will take more time to load the second arrow.\u201dWei Ruo took it, shot one at the target, and then loaded Nuo with the second arrow under the guidance of Wei Mingting. It was really slow.For a novice like her, the time to load a crossbow is about the same as to shoot an arrow with a bow, but for someone like Wei Mingting who has experienced many battles, the speed of taking arrows and shooting arrows when using a bow is much faster than that of loading a bow. speed.Wei Ruo looked at the Nu in his hand thoughtfully.\u201cWhat is Ruo\u2019er thinking?\u201d Wei Mingting was a little curious about his daughter\u2019s thoughts.\u201cI was thinking, it would be great if this Nu can load many arrows at once.\u201d Wei Ruo said casually while playing with the Nu in his hand.\u201cRuoer\u2019s idea is very interesting.\u201d Wei Mingting said, then looked up at the sky: \u201cIt\u2019s getting late, let\u2019s go back home.\u201dWei Mingting saw that it was getting late, so he ended today\u2019s trip and returned home with his wife and children.The way back was peaceful, and the group returned to Wei Mansion safely.After entering the door, before leaving Wei Ruo, Wei Mingting specifically told Wei Ruo: \u201cToday is your first time riding a horse and archery, and you will inevitably feel unwell tomorrow. Rest early when you go back.\u201d\u201cgood.\u201dWei Ruo received a medicine bath package from Cuiping not long after returning to Tingsongyuan.It was Wei Mingting who told Yun, and then Yun ordered Cuiping to bring it.Because of the war, Wei Mingting kept some medicine at home all the year round, and this medicinal bath pack was for Wei Mingting to use on weekdays.Wei Ruo opened the medicinal bath bag, carefully identified it, and sniffed it. It was indeed a prescription for relaxing tendons and activating blood circulation.Although there are some flaws in the formula, it is useful.Originally, Wei Ruo planned to make a medicinal bath by himself, but since Wei Mingting had someone send it over, he didn\u2019t bother, and just used the package he sent.So at night, Wei Ruo took a hot medicinal bath to soothe and relax.Wei Ruoyou expected that he might have back pain when he woke up the next day, but he didn\u2019t know until the next day that it was not only the back pain problem, but also the painful place was a bit embarrassing!Wei Ruo: I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m hasty, I should have prepared a medicinal bath for myself last night.(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 42": "Chapter 42 - sad and funnyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 42 Distressed and FunnyButtocks, inner thighs, these places that will be rubbed by horses, it hurts\u2026In contrast, the pain in the arms, shoulders, back and fingers when archery is not bad, because Wei Ruo usually collects herbs and does farm work, so his arms and shoulders are exercised.But the position of the inner thigh root cannot be exercised when doing other things.Wei Ruo is a bit regretful at the moment, he really couldn\u2019t be sloppy last night! If I had known earlier, I would have prepared the medicated bath pack by myself! Then today\u2019s soreness can be alleviated by at least half! It\u2019s not so embarrassing anymore!\u201cMiss\u2026why don\u2019t you get out of bed?\u201d Xiumei looked at Wei Ruo walking while leaning on the wall, both distressed and funny.\u201cMeimei, are you kidding, aren\u2019t you? There\u2019s no more love, right?\u201d\u201cNo, no, miss, I really didn\u2019t laugh! I must love you more than make fun of you!\u201d\u201cYou slipped up and said you didn\u2019t make fun of me!\u201d\u201cMiss, I don\u2019t want to laugh either, but it\u2019s the first time I saw you walking in this posture, and I couldn\u2019t help it. But believe me, I\u2019m definitely not making fun of you! I just think the way you walk is cute, miss!\u201d\u201cHmph, bad Meimei!\u201d Wei Ruo muttered, \u201cLaugh as you please, I\u2019ll admit it for you, but I can\u2019t let other people in this family see me like this, especially that stinky kid. \u201cWei Ruo could already imagine how Wei Yilin would laugh at her when he saw her like this.She makes a fool of herself and makes her own people laugh and laugh, but it\u2019s okay to laugh at those who want to see her jokes and expect her to be bad.Wei Ruo thought for a while and said to Xiumei: \u201cToday I won\u2019t eat in the dining room at noon or evening. Please help me and tell my mother that I was injured while riding a horse yesterday, so it is inconvenient for me to move.\u201dIt doesn\u2019t matter whether Yun believes it or not, anyway, it is impossible for her to walk to the dining hall.\u201cWhere is the lady eating for a while? Do you want to go to the second young master\u2019s small kitchen next door and cook some yourself? Miss Xu\u2019s mother has not tasted the dried fungus, and the sweet potato leaves brought back last time are still fresh.\u201d \u201d Xiumei suggested.When Xiumei said this, Wei Ruo\u2019s gluttons began to agitate.She isn\u2019t particularly picky eater, but the food made in the Wei family\u2019s big kitchen is much weaker than what she and Xiumei usually eat.It\u2019s not that the cooks in the big kitchen are too bad at cooking, but that the seasonings they use are much worse than what they use.\u201cGo to the next door!\u201d Wei Ruo decided that even if he is limping, he still has to go to the next door to eat!So Xiumei went to Cangyun Garden first, and reported Wei Ruo\u2019s situation to Yun.It just so happened that Wei Mingting mentioned to her last night that Wei Ruo spent a long time riding a horse and shooting arrows for a long time, and the next day would probably have a sore back and back pain, so she, a mother, should be more concerned.So Yun not only readily agreed to Wei Ruo not going to the dining hall to eat, but also ordered the people in the big kitchen to leave a separate meal and send it to Tingsong Garden for Wei Ruo.After returning to Tingsongyuan, Xiumei supported Wei Ruo to go out. When leaving the gate of Tingsongyuan, Wei Ruo first asked Xiumei to look around to make sure no one passed by before going out.Enduring the pain, he jumped up and down to the gate of Yingzhu Garden.As soon as Xiaobei opened the door, Xiumei and Wei Ruo went in. Xiaobei didn\u2019t even have time to ask.\u201cMiss, what\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d Xiaobei asked.\u201cDisabled.\u201dWei Ruo said and looked in the direction of the octagonal pavilion in the courtyard. As expected, Wei Jinyi began to sit in the pavilion again after recovering from illness.As long as it is not a particularly windy day, he will sit in the pavilion to read and write.Wei Jin is also looking at Wei Ruo at the moment.Seeing her bouncing towards him, her posture is weird and cute.When she came to her, Wei Jin also asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you? Are you injured?\u201dThe slightly furrowed brows and serious eyes reveal a hint of concern.\u201cNo injury, just rode yesterday.\u201d Wei Ruo replied, then exhaled sadly, paused, and added sullenly, \u201cThe first time.\u201dHearing this, Wei Jin also seemed to understand something, seeing Wei Ruo\u2019s angry look, a smile appeared on his originally serious face.Maybe because he seldom smiles in front of others, Wei Jin also covered half of his face with his hands.\u201cWei Jinyi, no matter what, I am your savior. I am your sister who has lived and died together. How can you make fun of me at a time like this?\u201dWei Ruoman said resentfully, and those who made her angry called Wei Jinyi by his first name.\u201cThere is no joke for you.\u201d Wei Jin also replied.There\u2019s no joke, just\u2026 the corners of his mouth curled up a bit.But he really didn\u2019t mean to laugh at her, he just smiled when he saw her angry and somewhat resentful expression.Maybe it\u2019s been too long since he had contact with such a person.Wei Ruo looked at Wei Jinyi with a slight smile on his lips, and couldn\u2019t help feeling, he looks so pretty when he smiles! Sure enough, people with good looks will look even better when they smile!This is the first time Wei Ruo sees Wei Jin smiling.It\u2019s just, why did he smile for the first time because of her miserable experience?Wei Ruo sighed helplessly: \u201cYou can laugh if you want, as long as you lend me your small kitchen, my Meimei will cook delicious food for me.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Wei Jin also responded.Although he still seldom speaks, he can feel that he is not as resistant as before.Wei Jin also told Xiaobei: \u201cGo and help me.\u201d\u201cOkay!\u201d Xiaobei followed Xiumei nervously and entered the small kitchen together.Xiu Meiqing fried a plate of sweet potato leaves, fried a plate of mushrooms, and made a nourishing chicken soup with the old hen in the small kitchen and the astragalus medlar in Wei Ruo\u2019s medicinal material library.This old hen was specially assigned to Wei Jinyi by the big kitchen to replenish his body after he fell ill.Xiumei asked Xiaobei, and Xiaobei went to ask Wei Jinyi for instructions, and Xiumei moved the knife after she was sure it could be burned.The chicken offal and chicken blood Xiumei took out was not wasted, and ran back to Tingsongyuan to get some spices. The prepared spicy hot pot ingredients were used up, but they still had some bits and pieces of spices for frying chicken offal and chicken blood Just right.While Xiumei and Xiaobei were busy in the kitchen, Wei Ruo sat in the pavilion and watched Wei Jinyi write.She must not be so leisurely and leisurely on weekdays, but today she just sat down and didn\u2019t plan to move her seat easily.Before she saw Wei Jinyi sitting in the pavilion reading and writing many times before, but she had never seen Wei Jinyi\u2019s works up close.I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a coincidence or she didn\u2019t care enough, anyway, when I came here before, at most I could only see the books Wei Jinyi was reading, but I had never seen the calligraphy and paintings he wrote.\u201cYour handwriting is so beautiful!\u201dAlthough Wei Ruo doesn\u2019t know calligraphy very well, her calligraphy can only be said to be barely readable, which is also practiced for the convenience of handling the business of the store. But she knows what kind of characters look good and have artistic beauty.Wei Jinyi\u2019s handwriting is like this. It\u2019s not bad at all to say that his handwriting is like his own. His handwriting is both vigorous and graceful, with both a graceful side and a strong side. In short, it is very beautiful.Wei Jin didn\u2019t answer either, not because he didn\u2019t want to answer, but because he didn\u2019t know how to answer such words.\u201cYou have read so many books and are good at writing, why don\u2019t you try to get fame like your brother?\u201d Wei Ruo asked curiously.Today is also a day to work hard to ask for votes and support~(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 43": "Chapter 43 - I can help youPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 43 I can help youWei Jinyi is not even a child, let alone a scholar, a scholar, or a Jinshi.Never even passed the exam.Although he is an unfavored bastard, if he wants to take the exam, Wei Mingting and Yun\u2019s family should agree. It would be an honor for the family if he passed the exam.\u201cThe previous ambition is not here.\u201d Wei Jin also replied.\u201cOnce upon a time?\u201d\u201cUm.\u201d\u201cChanged now?\u201d\u201cThere have been some changes.\u201d\u201cSo you want to take the exam?\u201d Wei Ruo asked.Wei Jinyi is only sixteen now. Although he started the exam later than Wei Yichen and the others, it is not too late in this era when scholars take the imperial examination for life.Wei Jin didn\u2019t answer the question, but asked about Wei Ruo: \u201cI heard that your mother is arranging for you to go to the county magistrate\u2019s class.\u201d\u201cYeah, I hope she arranges it a little slower.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t want to go?\u201d Wei Jin also asked.\u201cWell, I don\u2019t want to go.\u201d Wei Ruo flattened his lips and sighed helplessly.\u201cIs it because you don\u2019t want to go to class or go to the county magistrate?\u201d Wei Jinyi asked again.\u201cAlthough I don\u2019t really want to go to class, but in comparison, I still don\u2019t want to go to class with Wei Qingwan more.\u201d Wei Ruo replied.Probably because of the life-threatening friendship, Wei Ruo became much less defensive towards Wei Jinyi, and said some things that should not be said to other members of the Wei family to Wei Jinyi.And what happened last time, Wei Jin also knew about it.Wei Ruo said: \u201cActually, I wanted to find another female husband, but it was rejected. I don\u2019t know how long I can use the wasteland in the south of the city to delay.\u201dIn fact, Wei Ruo himself has the financial strength to afford to hire a female gentleman, Shu Xiu, and he also has a way to hire a passable female gentleman, but it is a bit troublesome to ask the captain\u2019s mansion to nod this without revealing himself. At present, Wei Ruo has not thought of a suitable solution to the problem.Wei Jin also stared at the worried Wei Ruo, and said, \u201cI can help you hire a famous female gentleman.\u201d\u201cCan you invite a famous female gentleman?\u201d Wei Ruo looked at Wei Jinyi suspiciously.Famous female gentlemen are not easy to hire, and it is not something that can be done with money.\u201cMy biological mother was born in a scholarly family, so I have some connections in this regard. I also have some contacts with people on my biological mother\u2019s side. It shouldn\u2019t be too difficult to find a female gentleman for you.\u201d Wei Jin also explained.Wei Ruo didn\u2019t know much about the situation of Wei Jinyi\u2019s biological mother, but seeing Wei Jinyi\u2019s serious expression, he knew that he sincerely wanted to help her, and he was confident that he could do it for her.Then Wei Ruo stopped being polite to him.\u201cIf it\u2019s a famous female gentleman, maybe I can find a way to settle this matter and get them to agree that I won\u2019t study with Wei Qingwan.\u201d Wei Ruo suddenly had an idea in his mind.Wei Jin also looked at Wei Ruo\u2019s upturned mouth and clever and sly eyes, vaguely looking forward to her next arrangement on this matter.After Wei Ruo and Wei Jinyi chatted for a while, Xiumei and Xiaobei came back with prepared dishes.Three dishes and one soup, steaming hot, full of fragrance in the courtyard.Wei Ruo asked Xiumei to sit down and eat together, and Wei Jin also called Xiaobei to serve.They are not rigid people. Today, there are no others around, so there is no need for the master and servants to distinguish so clearly.Four people sat on the small stone table in the octagonal pavilion. Three of the four dishes this time were not spicy.Wei Ruo told Wei Jinyi in advance that the plate of fried chicken giblets would choke people just like the seafood hot pot last time, and told him not to touch it and drink more chicken soup.Wei Jinyi did not try chicken offal at first, but after tasting the other three dishes, Wei Jinyi still tasted chicken offal.Having the experience of choking last time, this time he took small bites and chewed slowly.seems to want to figure out why this stimulating taste attracts Wei Ruo so much.Seeing that he tried again, Wei Ruo looked at him curiously.Seeing that he was not choked like last time, he asked, \u201cHow is it?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s delicious, and it\u2019s not hard to swallow.\u201d Wei Jin also commented.\u201cAfter that, if you have the opportunity to eat it a few more times, maybe you will fall in love with this taste.\u201d\u201cUm.\u201dBecause it was inconvenient to move, Wei Ruo stayed in the pavilion of Yingzhuyuan all afternoon, and Xiumei brought some account books for her.She and Wei Jinyi were on one side, he looked at his, she looked at hers, they didn\u2019t disturb each other, and they didn\u2019t talk during the period, they got along very quietly.On the way, Wei Jin also caught a glimpse of Wei Ruo\u2019s handwriting on the paper. The handwriting is extremely immature, as if she has just practiced handwriting, and the only person in the family who can compare with her handwriting is the seven-year-old Wei Yilin.After having another dinner together at night, Wei Ruocai, supported by Xiumei, bounced back to Songyuan.After Wei Ruo left, Wei Jin also wrote a letter and handed it to Xiao Bei to send it out of the house.When he came back, Xiaobei brought a reply, saying that they will definitely take care of what the young master explained.###After the ear seeds passed, the temperature picked up, but it was still a little lower than in previous years.Some old farmers are already worried about this year\u2019s harvest. According to this situation, this year\u2019s harvest will still not be good, and may even be worse than the past two years.After a few days of recuperation, Wei Ruo recovered completely, so he went to the wasteland in the south of the city again.The experimental site selected by her has been freed of weeds, and the first batch of furfural residue and humus that have been hydrolyzed by sealed fermentation have been placed.These things are acidic, which can well neutralize the alkalinity of the saline-alkali land, making the soil suitable for ordinary crops.Wei Ruo arranged for Changgong to carry out the second humus landfill today.Neither the two long-term workers nor Nanny Zhang understood Wei Ruo\u2019s arrangement, but they all completed the work well.Today Wei Ruo wanted to work in the field by himself for a while, but was persuaded by Madam Zhang, who asked Wei Ruo to stay in the carriage. If there is anything to do, just tell them.Wei Ruo had no choice but to lean in the carriage, arranging to direct the work of the two long-term workers and Madam Zhang.At noon, Wei Ruo sat down to rest under the camphor tree next to the experimental field, with Xiumei on her left and Nanny Zhang on her right. The two long-term workers are by the small river farther away.Xiumei took out the lunch she had prepared before leaving the house: braised pork over rice, served with a pile of boiled cabbage hearts.For the same lunch, Wei Ruo also prepared a portion for Nanny Zhang and the two long-term workers who were traveling with her, and each portion was packed in a separate food box.Xiumei gave one food box to Nanny Zhang, then went to the small river and gave the other two to Agui and Xiaoba.Nanny Zhang and the two long-term workers were stunned when they got the food box.Missy actually prepared a copy for these servants!\u201cDon\u2019t just stare at it, eat it quickly. It\u2019s all ordered, how can I work if I don\u2019t have enough food.\u201d Wei Ruo said to the three of them.The three came back to their senses, quickly put down the steamed buns they brought, and opened the food box Wei Ruo gave.There is meat! Huge chunks of meat!The eyes of Nanny Zhang and the two long-term workers burst out with excitement.(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 44": "Chapter 44 - follow me dry meatPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 44 Follow me and eat meatThe movements of the three were very consistent, and they couldn\u2019t wait to take a sip.Nanny Zhang is relatively more elegant. As a relatively respectable nanny in the mansion, she can often eat meat, but the two long-term workers are different. In the past, when the schedule was good, she would eat more. In the past two years, the only time to eat meat is during Chinese New Year.I thought that eating meat was already a happy thing, but when they tasted the taste, all three of them were amazed, this time even Zhang Nanny was no exception.This is different from what they eat elsewhere!How can this meat be so delicious?The three of them immersed themselves in the rice. After eating the meat, the rice mixed with the broth was indescribably delicious.The three of them ate fast in the first half, and then ate very slowly in the second half.Fast because it was so delicious, I couldn\u2019t help eating mouthful after mouthful, and slowly because it was so delicious, I wanted to taste more, and I didn\u2019t want to eat it after a few mouthfuls.After eating, the two long-term workers didn\u2019t have the nerve to finish talking, Zhang Nanny couldn\u2019t help asking Wei Ruo: \u201cMiss, is your meat made in the kitchen? How do you make it so delicious?\u201d\u201cXiumei did it.\u201d Wei Ruo replied.\u201cMiss Xiumei\u2019s cooking skills are so good!\u201d Madam Zhang couldn\u2019t help praising her, and at the same time, she looked at Xiumei with something that she didn\u2019t have before.From the first time she saw Xiumei, Nanny Zhang looked down on her, because she was a maid hired by the He family for Wei Ruo. She stayed with Wei Ruo in the countryside and had no education. of.I didn\u2019t expect this girl to have such abilities! It seems that this countryman is not all unruly and shallow-sighted, and there are some amazing things!Feeling the astonishment in Zhang Nanny\u2019s eyes, Xiumei couldn\u2019t help smiling.It was the first time for her to see Nanny Zhang, who looked at people with her nostrils, showing such an expression to her!Wei Ruo said to Nanny Zhang and the two long-term workers: \u201cLunch is only one aspect. As long as you follow me and work hard, the tasks I assigned are completed satisfactorily. I will not treat you badly.\u201dAt this time, one of the long-term workers, Agui, finally couldn\u2019t help it: \u201cMiss, do you mean to provide us with such delicious lunch in the future?\u201d\u201cNot only lunch, but also other benefits.\u201d Wei Ruo promised.\u201cMiss, don\u2019t worry, we will follow you well!\u201d Agui quickly expressed his opinion to Wei Ruo.\u201cMe too!\u201d Another long-term worker Xiaoba hastily seconded.Don\u2019t look at just a meal, it is very rare for them. Although I don\u2019t know what other preferential treatment Wei Ruo mentioned, it is enough to make them work harder for Wei some.Nurse Zhang didn\u2019t say anything. Although she thought the meal Wei Ruo gave was delicious, her eyelids were not so shallow, so she wouldn\u2019t change her opinion of the young lady just because of a meal.Just as she was thinking, Xiumei walked over and handed Mammy Zhang a small cloth bag.At the same time, I also gave Agui and Xiaoba each a pack. The weight of each pack is the same, and it feels quite heavy in the hand.Nanny Zhang opened the cloth bag curiously, saw the food inside, and asked, \u201cCould this be the dried sweet potato that the eldest lady gave to the ladies?\u201dNanny Zhang heard about it, and it is said that it has won unanimous praise from everyone, but she has never seen what the real thing looks like.\u201cWell, yes, this thing is easy to preserve and very filling. You can eat it when you are hungry or take it home for your children to try.\u201d Wei Ruo said.Out of curiosity, Agui and Xiaoba took a piece and tasted it carefully.Neither of them spoke, but judging from their expressions, they liked and enjoyed dried sweet potatoes very much. For low-level people like them, sweets are a luxury, so the reaction is bigger than ordinary people.Nanny Zhang looked at it for a while, but there was nothing special about the appearance, it was not as attractive as those delicate pastries.But driven by curiosity, I also tasted two sips.Although the reaction was not as great as the two long-term workers, they also showed their liking.Mother Zhang, who was complaining in her heart just now that she would not change her attitude towards Wei Ruo just because of a meal, is now wavering because of a bag of dried sweet potatoes.This eldest lady seems to be really generous to those who work with her\u2026The three of them only ate one piece and didn\u2019t eat any more. One was that Wei Ruo\u2019s lunch was sufficient and they were full, and the other was that they all wanted to keep it and take it home to have a taste of it with their families.After lunch, everyone continued to work. This time, the two long-term workers obviously had to work harder.Before they were not lazy, but they were just following their duties. Now Wei Ruo gave them the motivation to work harder, and their spirits are different.###Not far away, another group of people went out of the south gate like Wei Ruo.Chu Lan glanced across the desolate south of the city, thinking that everything was as he imagined, desolate and desolate, but he didn\u2019t want to see a few figures in the middle of the empty wasteland.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Chu Lan asked his subordinates.\u201cReturning to Your Highness, this group of people belonged to Wei Xiaowei\u2019s family, and they said they were trying to plant wasteland. If they succeed, they can lead the people in the city to plant here after the war improves. This matter has already been approved by Qianzhi County. .\u201d The attendants who followed reported to Chu Lanhui.As Chu Lan\u2019s entourage, when Chu Lan visits a place, he will investigate some basic conditions of the place in advance.\u201cPeople from the Wei family?\u201d Chu Lan asked in surprise, \u201cWhen did the Wei family know how to do such a thing? It doesn\u2019t seem like something that family can do.\u201dLu Yuhong said with a smile: \u201cYour Highness, it seems that the Wei family has given quite a lot of surprises. Last time it was calligraphy, and this time it was land reclamation.\u201dChu Lan didn\u2019t refute Lu Yuhong\u2019s words, but still kept his eyes on the people of the Wei family who opened up wasteland, and asked, \u201cWho is the person in command over there?\u201dThe following subordinates looked at it seriously for a while, and then gave a guess: \u201cIt may be the eldest lady of the Wei family who just returned home.\u201d\u201cMiss who just returned home?\u201d Chu Lan was a little curious.\u201cThe Wei family said to the outside world that they were raised in the countryside because of poor health, and they were brought back recently.\u201d The subordinate replied.\u201cI have been raised in the country, so I am good at farming?\u201d Chu Lan asked.\u201cIt is said to be so.\u201d The subordinate replied.Lu Yuhong said with a smile: \u201cIt\u2019s a bit novel to be a lady of the Earl\u2019s Mansion who grew up in the countryside and is proficient in farming.\u201d\u201cWhether she is proficient or not depends on what kind of tricks she can grow. It doesn\u2019t mean that she is proficient if she can go to the ground.\u201d Chu Lan has reservations about this matter.\u201cThat\u2019s true, only results are counted. In comparison, the Sibaozhai is more interesting.\u201d Lu Yuhong said.Although the last time I went to inquire about the shopkeeper of the store and was declined, Lu Yuhong still had Sibao Zhai in his heart, and always felt that it was a good opportunity to make money.After stopping briefly, Chu Lan led the crowd towards Moon Moon Mountain, without being attracted too much attention by this little episode.(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 45": "Chapter 45 - famous mr.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 45 The Famous Ms.After the soil improvement was completed, Wei Ruo ordered Nanny Zhang, Agui and Xiaoba to level the land and store water.After the land was prepared, Wei Ruo came to the wasteland in the south of the city again, and brought a large bag of rice seeds.When Wei Ruo handed over a bag of rice seeds to Nanny Zhang and asked her and Agui Xiaoba to plant the seeds, Nanny Zhang showed a hesitant expression, and after thinking about it, she tried to persuade Wei Ruo again:\u201cMiss, forgive me for asking too much, is it really okay to grow rice at this time? How about we change to other crops? Anyway, as long as it can be grown alive, other crops are also fine.\u201d\u201cJust plant this. Don\u2019t worry, this rice seed is a late rice seed. I brought it back from Huzhou Prefecture. Someone has already planted it there. The planting is just right at this time, and it won\u2019t fail.\u201d Wei Ruo was firm. , and with confidence.\u201cReally? There are such grains?\u201d Nanny Zhang looked surprised.\u201cIt\u2019s true. But don\u2019t spread this matter to the outside world, just plant it, and when the seedlings grow well, it will be more convincing to report.\u201dIf this had been said before, Nanny Zhang would never have believed it, but now the situation is a little different, she has a little more trust in Wei Ruo, although she still feels that some of Missy\u2019s ideas are too wild, they are those kinds of things The old farmers who lived in the field would not agree with their young lady\u2019s ideas.Agui and Xiao Ba didn\u2019t think so much.Agui said: \u201cIt\u2019s okay if the eldest lady says it\u2019s okay, we will listen to the eldest lady!\u201dXiao Ba also said: \u201cYes, we can plant whatever the eldest lady tells us!\u201dOthers are not important, anyway, the eldest lady treats them well, feeds them delicious food, fills their stomachs with their families, and just follow the eldest lady!Wei Ruo told the two of them: \u201cYou should study hard and remember well. After this land is successfully built, other wastelands will be developed in the future. There will be more long-term workers at that time. We need you two who have already experienced teaching and teaching to improve the land. Experience to others. And the follow-up work of managing and leading these people will also be handed over to you.\u201dWouldn\u2019t they become foremen in the future?Agui and Xiaoba excitedly agreed: \u201cMiss, don\u2019t worry, we will do it seriously!\u201dThe two of them took the rice seeds and started working hard.The process of sowing is not troublesome. When the seeds grow into seedlings, the workload of transplanting will be greater.If the seedlings can grow smoothly, it means that Wei Ruo\u2019s soil improvement is more than half successful.So now they only need to wait half a month to know whether Wei Ruo\u2019s soil improvement has any effect.###After tossing around in the fields for a few days, Wei Ruo just had a free day when he was called by Yun to talk again.The content of the conversation was still a clich\u00e9. Wei Ruo was asked to arrange the affairs of the wasteland in the south of the city to his subordinates as soon as possible, while he himself went to school in the magistrate\u2019s mansion.Because it has been urged once, when Wei Ruo wants to delay this time, Yun has not given her a chance, and asked her to prepare, and it will be arranged for her in the next two days.Seeing that the delay could no longer continue, Wei Ruo said nothing, and agreed to Yun\u2019s arrangement.At night, Wei Ruo went to the dining hall to have dinner with everyone.After dinner, everyone still sat together drinking tea and chatting.Wei Yichen also reported some of his reading progress to his mother as usual, and Wei Yilin will also talk to Yun about what happened in the school.Wei Qingwan doesn\u2019t talk much on weekdays, but today she hesitated to mention something: \u201cMother, the Xie family invited a lady, who is said to be the well-known Mr. Wang Caiwei.\u201dYun\u2019s eyes kept saying, \u201cReally?\u201dWei Yichen and Wei Yilin also showed surprise expressions.Wang Caiwei is a well-known talented woman in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. She was born in a scholarly family with a deep family background.Wang Caiwei, who lost her natal family\u2019s backing, is still pursued by many princes from aristocratic families, but they are all concubines instead of being married by a clear matchmaker.Wang Caiwei, who is full of pride, is naturally unwilling to be a concubine, and finally chooses to marry a poor scholar.Because of the poor life, Wang Caiwei began to teach rich and noble families.Although she is down and out, Wang Caiwei is famous and talented; there are countless people who want to invite her to be a female husband at home.It is said that Wang Caiwei\u2019s previous employer was the Ruan family in Qiantang, and the late old man of the Ruan family was the chief assistant who took office!And now, the Xie family in the north of the city has invited her!It seems that the rise of the Xie family is not groundless, and various signs have been revealed.\u201cWell, it\u2019s true, Zhilan told me.\u201d Wei Qingwan replied affirmatively, \u201cZhilan also said\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat else did she say?\u201d\u201cZhilan said that her mother now wants to arrange her to go to Xie\u2019s family to study with Miss Xie\u2019s family.\u201d Wei Qingwan lowered her head and whispered.\u201cDon\u2019t say that Mrs. Qian has such thoughts, if the Xie family invites Wang Caiwei, I have to find a way to let you go!\u201d Yun said.Although the current female gentlemen of Qian Zhixian\u2019s family are somewhat talented, they are only compared to ordinary people, and they are incomparable to the famous Wang Caiwei.If you become a student of Wang Caiwei and return to the capital in the future, it will be enviable to say it!Hearing this, Wei Yilin hurriedly said: \u201cMother, go and talk to Mrs. Xie\u2019s family, let my sister go! My sister is very talented and talented, that female gentleman will like to teach my sister!\u201dWei Qingwan also looked at Yunshi expectantly, hoping that Yunshi would help her to talk to Xie\u2019s family and arrange for herself to go to Xie\u2019s house to listen to Mr. Wang\u2019s class.\u201cI\u2019m afraid\u2026 the Xie family disagrees\u2026\u201d Yun muttered.Their relationship with Xie\u2019s family is not deep, but they have only met a few times on things such as blessing cruises.\u201cMom, why don\u2019t you help my sister ask, or we can send some more gifts to Xie\u2019s family!\u201d Wei Yilin said innocently.\u201cOf course I will. As for giving gifts, it\u2019s not so easy. This gift has to be delivered to people\u2019s hearts. The Xie family may not like ordinary vulgar things.\u201d Yun\u2019s thoughts turned back and forth.There were five people in a room, and all four of them were thinking about how to get Xie\u2019s family to agree to Wei Qingwan\u2019s going to Xie\u2019s house for class. Only Wei Ruo sat beside him, sipping tea calmly.When she put down the teacup, Wei Yichen suddenly turned to look at her.Looking at each other, Wei Ruo saw an apology in Wei Yichen\u2019s eyes.Sorry? Why is he sorry?After drinking tea, Wei Ruo left the dining hall and walked to Tingsongyuan. Wei Yichen caught up and said to Wei Ruo about what happened just now: \u201cRuoer, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cSorry for what?\u201d\u201cWe only mentioned the matter of letting Wanwan go to Xie\u2019s house to listen to Mr. Wang\u2019s class\u2026\u201d\u201coh.\u201d\u201cRuo\u2019er, it\u2019s not that we didn\u2019t expect you, it\u2019s just that Mr. Wang\u2019s requirements for students are definitely higher than those of ordinary gentlemen\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not qualified, right?\u201d Wei Ruo helped him finish what he hadn\u2019t said.(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 46": "Chapter 46 - Xie agreedPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 46 The Xie family agreed\u201cIt\u2019s not that you are not qualified, it\u2019s just that you haven\u2019t been studying these years, and your foundation is weaker than Wanwan and the others.\u201d Wei Yichen explained.\u201cYes.\u201d Wei Ruo calmly agreed.\u201cRuo\u2019er, mother will still try her best to arrange for you to attend classes at the magistrate\u2019s mansion.\u201d Wei Yichen added.Although Mrs. Qian and Mrs. Yun are trying their best to find a way to arrange their daughters to go to Xie\u2019s house, the current female gentlemen of the magistrate\u2019s mansion should not be dismissed so quickly. in class.Even if the Qian family doesn\u2019t invite them at that time, the Wei family can still invite the female gentleman to the house logically, so that it will not affect Wei Ruo\u2019s study.\u201cOh.\u201d Wei Ruo still had that calm look.The main reason is that there is nothing else to say.\u201cRuoer\u2026\u201d Seeing Wei Ruo\u2019s calm appearance, Wei Yichen felt a little uncomfortable.\u201cI\u2019ll go back first if there\u2019s nothing else to do.\u201d Wei Ruo didn\u2019t want to continue this topic with Wei Yichen, so he left after speaking.After Wei Ruo left, Wei Yichen thought for a long time, then returned to Cangyun Garden, and told Yun\u2019s thoughts: \u201cMother, when you go to Xie\u2019s mansion again, please ask Mrs. Xie if you can arrange for Ruo\u2019er Shall we go?\u201dYun\u2019s expression hesitated and said: \u201cYichen, if it\u2019s possible, I would naturally wish that both of my daughters would become Mr. Wang\u2019s students. But Ruo\u2019er\u2019s situation\u2026she can\u2019t do any piano, chess, calligraphy or painting, how can I do that?\u201d Go tell Madam Xie about this?\u201dHearing this, Wei Yichen didn\u2019t know what to say.He knows the situation of Ruoer\u2019s younger sister, and she is far inferior to Wanwan in all aspects of piano, chess, calligraphy and painting.The county magistrate agreed that sister Ruoer still looked at the face of their father as Captain Zhongxian, and also came from the Zhongyibo residence.The Xie family and Mr. Wang Caiwei don\u2019t think highly of them because of these things.But as an older brother, he always hopes that both younger sisters are well, and he doesn\u2019t want either one to be wronged.\u201cMother, why don\u2019t you just ask, if the Xie family disagrees, it\u2019s the Xie family\u2019s business, we always ask for Ruo\u2019er.\u201d Wei Yichen said.\u201cYichen, it was a bit difficult for us to ask the Xie family to ask Wanwan to go to class together. If we mentioned two at a time, and it was still in Ruo\u2019er\u2019s situation, it would inevitably not annoy the Xie family. Sometimes even Wanwan won\u2019t be able to do it, so what should I do?\u201dMr. Yun has deep concerns in her heart. It is better to be able to succeed in one than to fail in both, right?\u201cMy son knows.\u201d After hearing Yun\u2019s explanation, Wei Yichen had no choice but to give up.###Mr. Yun thought about preparing for three days, and then took a gift to Xie\u2019s house.Yun didn\u2019t come back until ten o\u2019clock in the evening.When he came back, Yun looked excited.Wei Qingwan had been waiting at home for a whole day, and she asked her maid Cuihe to guard the door, and when she saw Mrs. Yun coming back, she immediately rushed to Cangyun Garden.\u201cMother!\u201d\u201cWanwan, you\u2019re here! Just in time, Mother wants to tell you good news!\u201d\u201cMother, what is the good news?\u201d\u201cStupid child, what good news can there be? Naturally, the Xie family agrees that you will attend Mr. Wang\u2019s class with Miss Xie!\u201d\u201cReally? The Xie family really agreed?\u201d Wei Qingwan was so happy that she couldn\u2019t believe her ears.\u201cof course it\u2019s true!\u201d\u201cMother!\u201d Wei Qingwan hugged Yunshi excitedly.Mr. Yun patted Wei Qingwan on the back, \u201cOkay, okay, things are going well, and my mother\u2019s heart can be relieved.\u201d\u201cWell, thank you mother for working so hard for me, mother has worked hard.\u201d\u201cStupid child, parents are supposed to worry about their children\u2019s affairs in this world. Mother is very happy that you can have a good future.\u201dAt night, Wei Mingting went home.Mr. Yun told him the good news excitedly: \u201cHusband, the Xie family has agreed to let my daughter go to the Xie family to attend classes together!\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely true, Mrs. Xie personally agreed, and Mr. Wang was there at the time.\u201d Yun\u2019s face was full of joy.\u201cIt\u2019s very good.\u201d Wei Mingting also expressed his joy. It is a good thing that his daughter can be taught by Mr. Wang.Paused, Wei Mingting said again: \u201cDon\u2019t forget about Ruo\u2019er, you have to arrange a school for Ruo\u2019er as soon as possible. It\u2019s her business if Ruo\u2019er doesn\u2019t want to learn, but you have to make arrangements.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, my husband, the county magistrate\u2019s wife has long agreed, but I don\u2019t know if the Xie family will let Ms. Qian also go to study. If Ms. Qian also goes, maybe the county magistrate himself will not invite a female gentleman.\u201d\u201cIf the county magistrate doesn\u2019t invite you, you can invite the lady to our house. Not only Ruo\u2019er, but also the ladies from other families, you have to learn from it.\u201d Wei Mingting urged.\u201cWell, I know.\u201d Yun also thought so.Although inviting the female husband to the home will increase extra expenses, since Wanwan has arranged for Xie\u2019s house, Ruoer\u2019s end is not too bad.Besides, I invited the husband who was originally in the Qian family to come to my home, and I was able to get closer to the master and the county magistrate by the way.Although Wei Mingting is a military officer and has no official contacts with these two families, but they are both in Xingshan County, and there is always nothing wrong with a good relationship.###After waiting for two days, there was news from the magistrate\u2019s office that the Xie family did not agree to Qian Zhilan\u2019s going to Xie\u2019s house to study.Mrs. Xie declined on the grounds that the Qian family had a husband.Madam Qian was depressed, but she was helpless.That night, Yun called Wei Ruo to him: \u201cRuo\u2019er, I have given you enough time in the wasteland in the south of the city, and you can tell Madam Zhang to take care of the rest. You should go to the magistrate\u2019s house to go to school.\u201d\u201cknew.\u201dTo Yun\u2019s surprise, Wei Ruo didn\u2019t bargain with Yun this time, but agreed very calmly.So Yun continued to talk to Wei Ruo: \u201cThere is another problem, that is, there is only one carriage at home\u2026\u201dYun\u2019s expression is a bit embarrassed.In the past, Wei Qingwan was the only one who went to school in the magistrate\u2019s mansion, so it would be no problem for the carriage to pick up Wei Qingwan sooner or later.According to the original plan, both Wei Qingwan and Wei Ruo went to the magistrate\u2019s mansion to attend classes, and the carriage only carried one more person, so there was no problem.But now the situation has become more complicated. Wei Qingwan is going to Xie\u2019s house in the north of the city, and Wei Ruo is going to Qian\u2019s house in the magistrate. The two places have different routes.Wei Ruo sneered, and Xian Yun said what she wanted to say one step at a time: \u201cDoes mother want to say that Xie\u2019s house in the north of the city is far from the Xiaowei\u2019s mansion, so you plan to arrange the carriage for Xie\u2019s house in the north of the city?\u201d Wei Qingwan, the county magistrate Qian\u2019s house is closer, can you trouble me to walk there?\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t go there on foot. I will buy another carriage, but it will be smaller than the one we already have. The family is not well-off now. When I have more money, I will give it to you.\u201d Can you change to a better one?\u201d(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The Xie family is unusual, not to mention that the husband Qingwan is going to see is the famous and talented Queen Caiwei.\u201d Yun frowned and analyzed with Wei Ruo.\u201cWell, what you said is very reasonable, and I agree very much.\u201d Wei Ruo agreed.\u201cDo you agree?\u201d Yun looked at Wei Ruofeng\u2019s indifferent appearance in surprise, thinking she was talking ironically, but she didn\u2019t look like her.\u201cI very much agree, whoever goes to Xie\u2019s house which is further away and has a higher status to learn from the more talented Mr. Wang will take the original good carriage at home, and the one who didn\u2019t go will take the newly bought smaller and shabby carriage at home, which is very reasonable. \u201cWei Ruo said.Mr. Yun frowned, not knowing how to answer Wei Ruo\u2019s words for a while.Wei Ruo went on to say: \u201cMy mother definitely didn\u2019t make this decision because Wei Qingwan was the one who went to Xie\u2019s house, and I was the one who went to the magistrate\u2019s house. It\u2019s simply because Xie\u2019s house is far away and the lintel is higher than ours, right?\u201d\u201cNaturally.\u201d Yun replied immediately.\u201cOf course I have no objection. My mother considered objective factors and treated us fairly. Naturally, I have no objection.\u201d Wei Ruo replied.Wei Ruo\u2019s words are reasonable, well-behaved and sensible, but Yun\u2019s hearing is inexplicably a little timid.###\u201cSister, I prepared a gift for you!\u201d Wei Yilin excitedly ran into Wangmei Garden.\u201cGift?\u201d\u201cYes, congratulations to my sister for being able to go to Xie\u2019s house to take classes and learn from a famous female teacher!\u201d Wei Yilin smiled all over his face.Wei Yilin triumphantly introduced his presents: \u201cI bought a set of pens, inks, papers and inkstones for my sister, all from the newly opened Sibaozhai!\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t their paper very expensive and difficult to buy?\u201d Wei Qingwan looked surprised.\u201cYes, but it doesn\u2019t matter, brother Ni, I have private money!\u201d Wei Yilin said with a smile.\u201cYilin, you are so kind to me!\u201d Wei Qingwan said softly, her voice full of emotion.\u201cYou are my sister, who will I treat if I am not nice to you?\u201dWei Qingwan said hesitantly: \u201cBut there is still my sister, she is going to go to the magistrate\u2019s house to go to school, I don\u2019t know how the four treasures of the study are doing.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t care about her, her affairs have nothing to do with me!\u201d\u201cI\u2019d better go and have a look. If not, I\u2019ll give her some of mine. After all, she is an older sister. She doesn\u2019t need to care about us, but we, as younger brothers and sisters, have to care about her.\u201dAfter speaking, Wei Qingwan walked into her room, and when she came out, she took a lot of pens, ink, paper and inkstones.\u201cSister, I\u2019ll go with you! I\u2019m afraid she will bully you!\u201d Wei Yilin chased after her.\u201cThank you Yilin, I\u2019m fine. In the house, my sister won\u2019t bully me much.\u201d\u201cSister, being kind doesn\u2019t mean that others are also kind to you. We must not think too optimistic about things!\u201d Wei Yilin\u2019s attitude is firm.Anyway, as long as my sister wants to find Wei Qingruo today, he will follow her!\u201cOkay, then you can go with me, but you can\u2019t say those things to your sister after you see her, the elder brother will be angry with you if he finds out.\u201d\u201cI see, as long as she doesn\u2019t do anything to you, I will never take the initiative to make things difficult for her today.\u201d Wei Yilin assured Wei Qingwan.Arriving in Tingsong Garden, Wei Ruo was busy fertilizing the seedlings of sweet potatoes, loofahs, pumpkins and gourds planted in the yard.These seedlings have grown green and covered half of the wall.\u201cSister.\u201d Wei Qingwan walked up to Wei Ruo uninvited, \u201cMy sister will go to the magistrate\u2019s house for class in two days. I have prepared some pens, inks, papers and inkstones for my sister, hoping to come in handy.\u201dWei Ruo turned his head and glanced at the things Wei Qingwan held in his hand: \u201cI don\u2019t need your things, take them back and keep them for yourself.\u201dWei Qingwan paused, and then said: \u201cSister, don\u2019t worry, these things are all new, never used.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t need it.\u201d Wei Ruo refused again.Wei Qingwan, who was rejected, lowered her head sadly.Seeing this, Wei Yilin immediately said: \u201cIt\u2019s kind of my sister to give you something, why do you have such an attitude?\u201dWei Ruo smiled and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s my attitude? Is it a bad attitude to give me something I don\u2019t need and want you to take it back?\u201d\u201cWhy can\u2019t you use the things my sister gave you? You clearly deliberately embarrass my sister!\u201d Wei Yilin asked.\u201cWhat? I don\u2019t know whether I need it or not, do you know?\u201d\u201cYou are going to study soon! Pen, ink, paper and inkstone are all necessities!\u201d Wei Yilin said with a straight face.\u201cSo? Is there any necessary connection to tell me that I don\u2019t need the things Wei Qingwan wants to give me?\u201d Wei Ruo asked back.\u201cYou asked knowingly! Why are you so annoying!\u201d Wei Yilin was anxious.Wei Qingwan grabbed Wei Yilin and said, \u201cYilin, don\u2019t be angry, it\u2019s my fault, it\u2019s because I didn\u2019t choose a good gift. Don\u2019t be angry with your sister.\u201d\u201cWhat, sister, what\u2019s wrong with you? The one with the problem is obviously her!\u201dSeeing that Wei Qingwan took all the responsibility on himself, Wei Yilin became even more angry.My sister thinks about Wei Qingruo all the time, but this nasty Wei Qingruo always makes things difficult for her, making things difficult for her!I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because there\u2019s too much noise, some servants heard it and reported it to Mr. Yun, or it\u2019s because Mrs. Yun happened to be coming to Wei Ruo\u2019s place.When Yun stepped into the door of Tingsongyuan, he just heard Wei Yilin and Wei Ruo arguing, and Wei Qingwan tried to persuade them.Yun\u2019s sternly reprimanded: \u201cWhat kind of noise is it?!\u201dAs soon as Mr. Yun appeared, the noise stopped immediately.Yun\u2019s eyes swept over the three siblings in front of him: \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Why are you making such a fuss!\u201d\u201cMother\u2026\u201d Wei Yilin muttered when he saw Yun Shi, with an aggrieved expression on his face.Wei Ruo watched coldly.\u201cWanwan, tell me.\u201d The Yun family appointed Wei Qingwan to explain the reason.\u201cMother calm down, is it the daughter\u2019s fault? The daughter prepared some gifts for her sister, thinking that her sister would use them to study in the magistrate\u2019s mansion in a few days, but her daughter didn\u2019t prepare well, and her sister didn\u2019t like it. My sister quarreled.\u201dAfter listening to Wei Qingwan\u2019s explanation, Yun looked at the Four Treasures of the Study she was holding.Then he frowned and asked Wei Ruo: \u201cYou are going to study in the magistrate\u2019s mansion. What\u2019s wrong with Wanwan giving you the Four Treasures of the Study? Why do you say that the gift she prepared is not good?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t say she didn\u2019t prepare well. My original words were that I don\u2019t need these things. Please take them back and use them yourself.\u201d Wei Ruo answered Yun\u2019s question unhurriedly, then looked at Wei Qingwan, \u201cThat\u2019s right, right? Sister Qingwan?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201d Wei Qingwan nodded.Wei Yilin hurriedly said: \u201cYou asked your sister to take it back, isn\u2019t it because you are dissatisfied with the gift she prepared for you?\u201dWei Ruo: I heard that you can take a big carriage to go to Xie\u2019s house for class!

    "Chapter 48": "Chapter 48 - apologize to mePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 48 Apologize to meWei Ruo chuckled lightly: \u201cThese are two meanings. If you don\u2019t need to let her take it back, you are afraid of wasting it.\u201dWei Yilin retorted: \u201cYou are making unreasonable words. You are going to go to school. How can you not use it and waste it?\u201dWei Ruo smiled, then turned around and called Xiumei: \u201cXiumei, take some of my Four Treasures of the Study.\u201d\u201cGood lady!\u201d Xiumei\u2019s voice came from inside the room.After a while, Xiumei came out, holding a big bamboo basket in her hand.Xiumei huffed and moved the bamboo basket in front of everyone.Yunshi, Wei Qingwan and Wei Yilin looked at the things in the bamboo basket, their expressions all changed.A bamboo basket full of the Four Treasures of the Study!The most conspicuous thing is the paper, the color and texture can be seen to be the paper produced by Sibaozhai.Not one or two, nor ten or twenty, but a thick stack!The rest of the inkstones are also several squares, there are more than a dozen brushes, large and small, and there are more than ten pieces of ink sticks.And these things seem to be better than those brought by Wei Qingwan.\u201cRuo\u2019er, where did you get so many Four Treasures of the Study?\u201d Yun\u2019s face was full of surprise.There are so many things that the eldest son doesn\u2019t even have!\u201cWhen I was in Mojiashan, I accidentally helped an old lady who was lost in the mountains. She had a son who was in the business of the Four Treasures of the Study, and she gave me a basket of these things as a reward. Although I have never studied, I also know that these things are not cheap, so I shipped them all when they came from Mojiazha.\u201dWhen Wei Ruo came to Wei\u2019s house, he moved two full carts of things, and everyone in the Wei family knew about it.But everyone thought they were worthless things, and no one asked what Wei Ruo had brought back.Who would have thought that there would be such a basketful of treasures hidden among the pile of worthless country souvenirs she brought in!Wei Ruodao: \u201cSo mother, it\u2019s okay for me to say that I don\u2019t need the things that Sister Qingwan gave me, right? I don\u2019t have time to use my basket of pens, ink, papers and inkstones, and the gifts I received from Sister Qingwan are also left in the house to eat ashes. I don\u2019t want to waste my sister Qingwan\u2019s heart.\u201d\u201cWho would have thought that I would misunderstand sister Qingwan and brother Yilin by saying this? I obviously mean it well, but I don\u2019t know why they think of me like this, probably because they think I am a bad person in their hearts.\u201dHearing this, Wei Qingwan and Wei Yilin\u2019s faces turned ugly.Yun said: \u201cIt\u2019s good to explain clearly, it\u2019s just a misunderstanding.\u201dWei Ruo nodded: \u201cWell, it\u2019s good to explain clearly. At first, I thought that I had so many pens, inks, papers and inkstones and I should give some of them to Sister Qingwan, but I can see that Sister Qingwan can make a whole new set of preparations.\u201d If you give it to me, you won\u2019t need it for a while, so I won\u2019t give it to her.\u201d\u201cAs for brother Yilin, he just ran into me, saying that I was unreasonable and that my attitude was not good. Although as the elder sister, I shouldn\u2019t care about him, after all, he is still young. But as an elder sister, I can\u2019t indulge my younger brother too much. Knowing that my younger brother\u2019s reckless and disrespectful elder sister\u2019s behavior is wrong, but still pretending that nothing happened is my elder sister\u2019s fault.\u201dWhat Wei Ruo said made the three people in front of him not know how to respond.Yun Shi also realized that Wei Yilin\u2019s attitude towards Wei Ruo was problematic: \u201cYilin, apologize to big sister Ni! As a younger brother, how can you talk to your elder sister like this?\u201d\u201cBut mother\u2026\u201d\u201cNo but!\u201d Yun\u2019s expression was stern.Wei Yilin was about to explode, but under Yun\u2019s gaze, he had to bow his head.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I was wrong.\u201d Wei Yilin apologized, but his face was full of reluctance.Wei Ruo replied unhurriedly: \u201cLittle brother, you need to be sincere when apologizing to others. Today you apologized to me at home like this. If I don\u2019t correct you, you will go out and continue to behave like this in the future. It\u2019s a big loss. You are the young master of my Wei family, and your words and deeds represent the Wei family and the Zhongyi uncle\u2019s residence.\u201dWei Ruo raised Wei Yilin\u2019s apology to the level of Zhongyi Bofu with a few words.Yun felt that what Wei Ruo said was right, so he admonished Wei Yilin again: \u201cYilin, please apologize, your eldest sister is right, and you have to show sincerity in apologizing. ?\u201dYun\u2019s stern expression frightened Wei Yilin, his eyes were a little red, and he bit his lip: \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I was wrong, I was reckless.\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter, I said you are still young, as the elder sister, I won\u2019t care too much about you. As long as you have a better memory next time, and think more about things, the elder sister will be very happy.\u201d Wei Ruo said with a smile.Wei Yilin felt even more depressed, but he had no choice but to stare at Wei Ruo with his round eyes full of grievances.After the matter was resolved, Yun took Wei Qingwan and Wei Yilin away from Tingsong Garden, and when they walked to the door, they saw Wei Jinyi.Looking at each other, Wei Jin also said \u201cMother\u201d, Yun nodded in agreement, and then left.Be courteous and detached.Wei Jin also heard the quarrel, and then watched a play at the door.Originally, he could have left before Yun Shi went out, but today he deliberately didn\u2019t leave and had a face-to-face meeting with Yun Shi.After Yun Shi left, Wei Jinyi also planned to go back. Wei Ruo came out at this time and called Wei Jinyi.\u201cSecond brother, just right, these are for you.\u201dWei Ruo took out a pile of the Four Treasures of the Study from the bamboo basket, and directly stuffed them into the arms of Xiaobei who followed behind Wei Jinyi.There were scrolls of paper, inkstones, and a pile of pens and ink sticks. Xiao Bei hurriedly picked them up, almost unable to hold them.Wei Jin also glanced at the things that Wei Ruosai brought over, but did not refuse.Just said: \u201cIt\u2019s too much.\u201d\u201cNot much, anyway, it will be used sooner or later. As the saying goes, wealth should not be exposed. I have exposed these things, so I have to use them up early. Rather than being fooled away by someone I don\u2019t like one day, it is better to give it to someone I like. \u201cWei Ruo replied.Hearing this, Wei Jin also blushed suddenly, then quickly turned around and walked away with Xiao Bei.Wei Ruo didn\u2019t know why Wei Jinyi walked so fast, but because he always had that unpredictable temperament, he didn\u2019t think much about it.###The next day, Xie\u2019s family sent a letter of greeting to Xiaowei\u2019s Mansion. Madam Xie wanted to bring her daughter Xie Ying to Xiaowei\u2019s Mansion, saying that the two children would go to school together in the future, and let them get acquainted in advance.After receiving the invitation, Yun became busy. Although only the Xie family members came, Yun still did not dare to slack off in the slightest.After two days of busy work, Mrs. Xie arrived with her daughter Xie Ying.\u201cMadam Wei, I\u2019m sorry to bother you.\u201d Madam Xie greeted Yun with a smile.\u201cWhere is it, my daughter and I are not very happy that Mrs. Xie can come.\u201d Yun\u2019s face was full of joy.Madam Xie glanced at Wei Qingwan who was standing beside Yun, then looked around, seeing that there was no one else, she asked, \u201cMadam Wei, where is the other daughter of the family?\u201d(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 49": "Chapter 49 - Is it Ruoer or not Wanwan?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 49 Is Ruoer not Wanwan?\u201cRuoer, she\u2026 is in her room preparing for going to class.\u201dActually, Wei Ruo is probably busy with the fruits and vegetables grown in her yard at the moment, but Yun is embarrassed to tell people that her daughter grows vegetables in the yard, so she has to lie that Wei Ruo is preparing for class.\u201cMother, let me go over and see what she has prepared.\u201d Xie Ying said.Madam Xie asked Yun: \u201cMadam Wei, look\u2026\u201dYun\u2019s smile was a bit awkward, but Mrs. Xie had asked, and she couldn\u2019t refuse, so she could only agree: \u201cThen I will ask my maid Cuiping to take Miss Xie there.\u201d\u201cThen let\u2019s go now.\u201d Xie Ying left as soon as she said, ignoring Wei Qingwan who was always smiling and looking at her.Yun\u2019s guess is correct, Wei Ruo is currently picking tender pumpkins and pumpkin vine tips in the yard.Her pumpkin vines are growing very well, climbing half of the courtyard wall, and several fruits have grown. This is a good time to pick these two things.Wei Ruo likes to eat tender pumpkins and pumpkin tips. These two can be mixed together and stir-fried for a refreshing, sweet and crisp taste.When Xie Ying entered the door, she saw Wei Ruo standing on the ladder with a bamboo basket in her hand, picking something intently.Xie Ying walked over without making a sound, just watching from the side.Wei Ruo heard the movement and knew that someone had come in. Wei Ruo didn\u2019t bother, but the other party didn\u2019t make a sound for a long time, so Wei Ruo turned his head and looked over.\u201cMiss Xie?\u201dWei Ruo was not too surprised by Xie Ying\u2019s arrival. She also heard that Mrs. Xie would bring Xie Ying to visit the Wei family. Just curious what Xie Ying was doing watching her.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Xie Ying asked.\u201cPick pumpkin tips and small pumpkins.\u201d Wei Ruo replied.\u201cOh, I know that, I\u2019ve eaten it, and it doesn\u2019t taste good.\u201d Xie Ying said.\u201cIt may be that the cook who made this dish is not very good. I have a chance to let you try my Meimei\u2019s cooking.\u201d Wei Ruo said.Xie Ying didn\u2019t refute, but her eyes told Wei Ruo that she didn\u2019t really believe what Wei Ruo said, how could a pumpkin tip be delicious?Xie Ying glanced around, \u201cWhere do you have a place where I can hide for a while and go back to sleep? I was taken out of the house by my mother early in the morning, and I haven\u2019t woken up yet.\u201dXie Ying doesn\u2019t care why Wei Ruo grows vegetables in the yard where she lives, and why Wei Ruo isn\u2019t preparing what she needs for class. She just wants to find a place to sleep in a daze.Wei Ruo pointed to the rattan chair he had placed in the yard and said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you move it under my gourd rattan shelf, where the sun won\u2019t shine.\u201dAfter a while, the sun will be bright and it will be too hot, so if you want to sleep, you still have to find a shady place.Xie Ying nodded, then picked up Wei Ruo\u2019s chair and walked over.The wicker chair is very comfortable, the gourd vines grow lushly, and the shade under the shelf is very suitable for Xie Ying\u2019s requirement of hiding in a daze.Xie Ying shook it for a while and then said to Wei Ruo: \u201cCan you give me some seeds for the plant you planted? I will plant one at home when I go back. And where did you buy this rattan chair? I want to buy one too.\u201dIs this a set of configurations that I like Wei Ruo?\u201cI can give you the seeds, but it\u2019s too late to plant them now; there should be some wicker chairs for sale outside, so ask your servants to ask more questions for you.\u201d Wei Ruo replied.\u201cThen what kind of vines can be planted in this season to grow into your appearance? I want the kind that can be planted casually. I don\u2019t know how to grow plants, and I will die if I grow anything.\u201d Xie Ying asked again.\u201cThat may not be very suitable\u2026 Most of the climbing vines grow in the yard and need to be taken care of, watering and fertilizing and preventing pests.\u201d\u201cTrouble.\u201d Xie Ying muttered, then stopped talking, closed her eyes and began to take a nap.So she came to see Wei Ruo not because she liked Wei Ruo so much, but because Wei Ruo was here so that she could sleep easily!Wei Ruo claims to be a person who doesn\u2019t like to socialize and likes to hide and relax, but looking at Xie Ying, she can only bow down.Wei Ruo and Xie Ying stayed together peacefully for half an hour, when Mrs. Yun and Mrs. Xie came to find them, followed by Wei Qingwan.Mrs. Xie came to visit today, and Wei Qingwan accompanied her throughout.Her well-behaved and gentle performance has been praised by Mrs. Xie many times, and she repeatedly feels that it would be great if her daughter could be as well-behaved and sensible as Wei Qingwan.This made Yun very proud. Her daughter is indeed very sensible. She guessed that it was because of this that when she and Mrs. Xie asked her daughter to study with Miss Xie\u2019s family, Mrs. Xie would agree so readily.Mrs. Xie who entered Tingsong Garden was not surprised to see Xie Ying sleeping in the shade.Her daughter has this personality. If she is asked to go out to play, she can go crazy all day, but if she is to be a good lady at home, she must be as lazy as possible.If this temperament is left in another family, it will definitely be punished.However, her precious daughter is spoiled by the whole family, so she has developed such a personality that no one can control her, and no one can control her well.Madam Xie smiled apologetically, and then asked Wei Ruo: \u201cMiss Wei, Xiaoying didn\u2019t bother you, did she?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t bother you, we got along very well.\u201d Wei Ruoting likes Xie Ying\u2019s personality, and there is no pressure or burden for her.\u201cThat\u2019s good, so that you can get along happily when you study together in the future.\u201d Mrs. Xie said with a smile.As soon as these words came out, Yun Shi and Wei Qingwan were stunned.Yun asked: \u201cMrs. Xie, you just said that Ruo\u2019er will study with Miss Xie in the future?\u201dMadam Xie looked at Yun with some doubts: \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Is there any problem?\u201d\u201cNo\u2026 I\u2019m just a little surprised. I didn\u2019t expect Mrs. Xie to agree that Ruo\u2019er would also go to Xie\u2019s house to study with Mr. Wang.\u201d Yun\u2019s policeman said.\u201cReally?\u201d Mrs. Xie\u2019s face became more and more suspicious, \u201cMrs. Wei, wait a minute, why am I getting more and more unable to understand what you are saying.\u201dYun\u2019s face was also blank: \u201cIsn\u2019t what Mrs. Xie said just now meant to let Ruo\u2019er go to Xie\u2019s house to study?\u201dMrs. Xie looked at Mrs. Wei with a gentle smile: \u201cMrs. Wei, didn\u2019t we say at the beginning that Miss Wei would come to our Xie\u2019s house to study with my family Ying\u2019er?\u201d\u201cMrs. Xie, what do you mean\u2026 you mean Ruoer, not Wanwan?\u201d Yun\u2019s face was shocked.Thank you for your support~(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Didn\u2019t the second miss have been studying at the magistrate\u2019s mansion? How can I compete with the magistrate\u2019s mansion? I heard that the eldest miss had not arranged to study because she had just picked her up, so I thought about Mrs. Wei and said It must be Missy.\u201d Mrs. Xie replied.When Mr. Yun went to Xie\u2019s house, he only mentioned his daughter, but didn\u2019t mention which daughter it was.Mrs. Xie took it for granted that it was Wei Ruo who hadn\u2019t arranged to study yet, so she agreed without hesitation, and told Mrs. Yun that her daughter was very good, and she should get along very well with her daughter; Miss Wei Jia came and taught together.Mr. Yun was very happy, and took it for granted that it was Wei Qingwan, and didn\u2019t think about Wei Ruo at all.No matter how I think about it, I don\u2019t think Wei Ruoneng can get into the eyes of Xie\u2019s family, let alone Mr. Wang\u2019s.Wei Qingwan was so shocked that she couldn\u2019t speak, her face turned pale visibly.Wei Ruo felt Wei Qingwan\u2019s resentful gaze. It could be seen that Wei Qingwan was surprised, even at a loss, and even turned his anger on her head.But what does it matter to her? She didn\u2019t take the initiative to ask Wei Qingwan to throw this person away, it was their own fault.Mrs. Xie looked at Yun Shi and Wei Qingwan who were stunned in front of her, and she also recalled it.Madam Xie knew that it was inconvenient for her to stay for a long time, so she called Xie Ying over and said goodbye to Yun Shi.Before leaving, she said to Wei Ruo: \u201cMiss Wei, see you in two days. If you need anything about studying, just let me know. I will prepare it for you in advance.\u201d\u201cThank you, madam.\u201d Wei Ruo thanked.Recovering from the shock, Yun forced a smile to send off Mrs. Xie and Xie Ying.When she came back again, she was exhausted, looked at Wei Ruo and Wei Qingwan, opened her mouth, but didn\u2019t know what to say, so she let the two go to rest, and then went back to Cangyun Garden by herself.Wei Qingwan looked at the back of the departing Yun, the tears in her eyes could no longer be controlled.She looked up at Wei Ruo who was beside her, with anger and disbelief coexisting in her eyes.Wei Ruo ignored her and went back to work on her pumpkin vines.After a while, I heard footsteps and knew that Wei Qingwan was trotting away.Returning to Cangyun Garden, Yun\u2019s thoughts were full of thoughts.The Xie family agreed that the daughter of the Wei family should go to school. Being a student of Mr. Wang Caiwei is a good thing, no matter which one she is, she should be happy.But whoever wants to make an own mistake, Yun\u2019s mood becomes very complicated.I am still happy, at least one daughter is going to Xie\u2019s house to study with Mr. Wang.But there are still worries, distress and worries.The worry is that Ruoer might behave badly.I feel sorry for Wanwan, this oolong made Wanwan suffer a lot in this matter.As for worrying, I can\u2019t tell what kind of heart it is.###When dinner was approaching, Wei Ruo asked Xiumei to tell the people in Cangyunyuan that she was not feeling well and would not go to the restaurant tonight.Wei Ruo knew that if she went to the dining hall for dinner today, she would definitely have to face the low pressure of a table, so she might as well not go.I don\u2019t think the rest of the family would care about whether she went to the dining hall to eat or not.Then Wei Ruo ran to Yingzhu Garden and went to have dinner with Wei Jinyi.The euphemistic name is: In order to thank the second brother for helping me find a female husband, please invite the second brother to eat our own meals.Wei Jin also acquiesced to Wei Ruo\u2019s behavior, and knew why Wei Ruo hid at his place for dinner.While Xiumei and Xiaobei were working in the small kitchen, Wei Ruo and Wei Jin were also sitting in the pavilion.\u201cIn a good mood?\u201d Looking at the playful smile on Wei Ruo\u2019s face, Wei Jinyi couldn\u2019t help but a little more happy.After observing for a period of time, Wei Jin also found that Wei Ruo\u2019s appearance on his side was very different from the appearance in front of other people in the family. On his side, Wei Ruo was more lively and loved to laugh.\u201cIt must be good. Although I didn\u2019t want to make this oolong, but the effect is not bad. I\u2019m naturally in a good mood.\u201d Wei Ruo didn\u2019t hide his true thoughts about seeing a good show.\u201cYou handled it well. Can you tell me why you chose the Xie family?\u201d Wei Jin also asked.At first, he didn\u2019t know what Wei Ruo was going to do, but when she told him that he would recommend Mr. Wang to Xie\u2019s family, he understood a little bit.Because she is a famous female husband, the Xie family will definitely be very happy, not only willing, but also to help Wei Ruo pay for Shu Xiu.As long as Mr. Wang mentions it to Xie\u2019s family again, and brings another Miss Wei\u2019s family among the students he teaches, Wei Ruo can go to Xie\u2019s family to study smoothly.Wei Ruo replied: \u201cThere are two main reasons. First, Xie\u2019s family is the most well-established family in Xingshan County other than Xiaowei\u2019s Mansion and Qianzhi County\u2019s family, and it is also a family that can not give face to Wei\u2019s family; second, I have been with Xie Ying before, although we don\u2019t have much friendship, but I like Xie Ying\u2019s temperament, we can do not disturb each other, live in peace, there are not so many twists and turns that make me troubled.\u201d\u201cIf my mother asks Xie\u2019s family to want Wei Qingwan to go to Xie\u2019s house to study with you, would you be willing?\u201d\u201cThat must be unwilling. I was trying to avoid her. Wouldn\u2019t it be a waste of my work to let her go? Besides, you used your relationship to help me find this lady.\u201d , how can I let others take advantage of me? It\u2019s fine if she has no grievances with me, but I still remember the last time she slandered me and pushed people away! You can\u2019t let a person who has a grudge against me take advantage of me, right? Then how much will I suffer? I don\u2019t want to do a loss-making business!\u201d\u201cWhat about me?\u201d Wei Jin also asked.\u201cyou?\u201d\u201cFor me, did you make a loss-making business?\u201d\u201cPfft\u2026\u201d Looking at Wei Jinyi\u2019s serious face, he couldn\u2019t hold back for a while.Wei Jin also looked at her seriously.\u201cAhem.\u201dWei Ruo cleared his throat, and also seriously analyzed with Wei Jinyi: \u201cCalculating carefully, in order to save you that day, I was locked up in the woodshed, offended the head of the house, and paid a lot of medicine; but you Well, it\u2019s still pretty good, you\u2019re giving me old mountain ginseng, and you\u2019re helping me find a female husband, and you\u2019re really kind and repaying, so I think I\u2019m not losing out on this deal with you!\u201dWei Jin also smiled, his smile was not ostentatious, always shallow, warm, as light as water, as warm as jade.\u201cBy the way, I have a question.\u201d Wei Ruo suddenly had a doubt.\u201cWhat\u2019s the problem?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just that you look weak and weak. When I see you on weekdays, I stay at home all day, either reading or writing. But why did you look so strong when I took off your clothes that day? Those muscles, The lines are pretty good.\u201d(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Even in this small courtyard, you still haven\u2019t forgotten to maintain a good figure.\u201d Wei Ruo commented.\u201cI\u2019m a little different from you, so I can\u2019t slack off.\u201d Wei Jin also murmured.He seemed to be speaking to Wei Ruo, but also seemed to be talking to himself.###Wei Qingwan cried for a long time in the room, Wei Yichen and Wei Yilin successively came to comfort her.Different from the past, this time Wei Qingwan cried for a long time but couldn\u2019t get over it.Then Wei Ruo also came.Wei Yichen and Wei Yilin came out of the house, and when they saw Wei Ruo, they both had strange expressions.Wei Yilin couldn\u2019t hide his emotions, so he rushed up and questioned Wei Ruo: \u201cYou scoundrel! You took away my sister\u2019s place to study at Xie\u2019s house! You made my sister cry so sad!\u201dWei Ruo looked calm, and asked Wei Yichen unhurriedly: \u201cFirst of all, the Xie family chose me to study with Miss Xie from the very beginning. You made a mistake yourself. How did it become my fault? Your logic Something\u2019s wrong, I\u2019m inexplicably charged with this crime.\u201d\u201cSecondly, why did my coming to visit Sister Qingwan turn into a good show? Has she suffered a lot of grievances? Can\u2019t she continue to go to school in the magistrate\u2019s mansion? She has been like this for the past few years. It didn\u2019t How can something that feels wronged become wronged now?\u201d\u201cAnd before you misunderstood that the person Xie\u2019s family agreed to study with was Qingwan sister, when you arranged for me to study in the magistrate\u2019s mansion, didn\u2019t you say that the female gentleman in the magistrate\u2019s mansion is also very powerful? How come it is Qingwan\u2019s sister? Are you wronged?\u201dWei Ruo unhurriedly refuted Wei Yilin\u2019s accusation, and looked at Wei Yilin with a small smile.\u201cThat\u2019s different! My sister is better than you, she should have gone to the Xie family!\u201d Wei Yilin retorted.\u201cOh, so you all lied to me. You lied to me when you said you would treat me and sister Qingwan fairly, right? In fact, you have never put the two of us together in your heart, have you? It\u2019s only natural that some things happen to me, but it\u2019s wronged when it happens to Sister Qingwan, right?\u201dWei Ruo said sad words, but there was always a slight smile on the corner of his mouth, and a pair of clear eyes were as bright as torches, as if he could see through all the thoughts of the Wei brothers.Wei Yichen and Wei Yilin were both taken aback.Especially Wei Yichen, he was a little guilty and dared not look into Wei Ruo\u2019s eyes.Wei Ruo smiled again: \u201cDon\u2019t feel embarrassed, I didn\u2019t ask you to treat the two of us fairly, just don\u2019t say one thing but actually do another, just do what you want.\u201dSpeaking of which, Wei Ruo looked down at Wei Yilin again: \u201cAnd you, don\u2019t be so double-standard, one set of standards for Wei Qingwan, another set of standards for me, if you don\u2019t want to admit it, I won\u2019t admit it, why use it? What about your standards? I don\u2019t owe you anything!\u201dWei Yilin said: \u201cEven if you have no responsibility, what are you doing here to see her jokes? Are you intentionally making her sad?\u201d\u201cIs there any joke to read? She just continued to go to school in the magistrate\u2019s mansion. Could it be that going to school in the magistrate\u2019s mansion is a joke? You were secretly laughing at me before that? You and Wei Qingwan came to me with pens, ink, paper and inkstone Did you actually come to laugh at me?\u201d Wei Ruo asked back.\u201cYou\u2026you!\u201d Wei Yilin didn\u2019t know how to refute Wei Ruo, his little face flushed suddenly.After pondering for a while, Wei Yichen said to Wei Ruo with a heavy tone: \u201cRuo\u2019er, you are right. In this matter, we have indeed been biased. What Yilin said is also very problematic. I will take care of it.\u201d taught him.\u201d\u201cWell, I believe that my eldest brother is a fair and just person, and he is also a person who keeps what he says.\u201d Wei Ruo said with a smile.The words \u201cfairness and justice\u201d and \u201cdo what you say\u201d are like two sharp knives cutting Wei Yichen\u2019s heart twice.Wei Yichen realizes that although they always say that they treat the two younger sisters the same, it seems that they will naturally choose Wanwan for many things, and they always subconsciously believe that Wanwan is better than Ruoer.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s my brother who didn\u2019t do well enough.\u201d Wei Yichen apologized.Wei Ruo didn\u2019t answer Wei Yichen\u2019s words, looked at Wei Qingwan\u2019s room and said, \u201cI came here today to ask sister Qingwan what she needs to bring to class, but now it seems that I\u2019m not very popular. That\u2019s fine, I\u2019ll go ask my second brother.\u201dWei Yichen hurriedly called to Wei Ruo: \u201cRuoer, big brother can teach you these things too.\u201d\u201cNo need, brother is very busy, so I won\u2019t bother him.\u201d Wei Ruo replied.\u201cBrother is free now, why don\u2019t you go back with him, can he explain to you?\u201d Wei Yichen looked at Wei Ruo expectantly.\u201cIt\u2019s not necessary, I think the second brother is more free than the eldest brother.\u201d Wei Ruo still refused.\u201cOkay then.\u201d Wei Yichen couldn\u2019t force it anymore, and looked a little disappointed.Wei Ruo didn\u2019t care what Wei Yichen was thinking, turned around and left Wangmei Garden.Before leaving, she glanced at the room behind her, she knew Wei Qingwan was listening inside.She came today to return the gift that Wei Qingwan came to give her that day.That day Wei Qingwan kept saying that it was for her own good to come to her and give her presents, but now that the situation has changed, they immediately felt that she was here to show off and make fun of?Although she doesn\u2019t want to compete with Wei Qingwan for favor and male lead at all, it doesn\u2019t mean that Wei Qingwan can bully her and provoke her openly and secretly.What should be repaid still needs to be repaid.###Two days later, two carriages, one large and one small, were parked at the gate of the Captain\u2019s Mansion.Wei Qingwan and Wei Ruo walked out at about the same time.Mr. Yun came to see his two daughters out, looking at Wei Ruo and Wei Qingwan, Mrs. Yun felt mixed feelings.When Wei Qingwan was about to board the carriage, Wei Ruo stopped her:\u201cI\u2019m sorry, sister Qingwan, my mother said that Xie\u2019s house is far from the school captain\u2019s mansion, so the big carriage is given to those who go to Xie\u2019s house.\u201d(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 52": "Chapter 52 - this is what mother meansPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 52 This is what mother meansHearing that Wei Qingwan froze, she turned her head and looked at Wei Ruo suspiciously.And Wei Ruo had a faint smile on his face: \u201cActually, it doesn\u2019t make any difference to me which carriage I take. As the eldest sister, I shouldn\u2019t care about such trivial matters with my younger siblings. But I think what my mother said is very reasonable, and I can\u2019t refute my mother\u2019s opinion.\u201dWei Qingwan looked at Yun Shi again.Yun didn\u2019t know how to speak at the moment.This is indeed what she said! But at that time, they all thought that the person who was going to Xie\u2019s house to study was Wanwan! I don\u2019t know that Wanwan will be wronged in this matter.If she knew that Wanwan would be wronged, in order to take care of Wanwan\u2019s mood and make up for the damage she suffered, she would definitely not mention changing the carriage!\u201cMother, this\u2026is this what you mean?\u201d Wei Qingwan asked Yun.\u201cYes, that\u2019s what I meant.\u201d Yun Shi said, although there were some pimples in his heart, but Yun Shi couldn\u2019t deny what he said.She then comforted Wei Qingwan and said: \u201cWanwan, the Xie family has a high lintel, so we can\u2019t let the Xie family look down on us. Let your sister sit in the big carriage. Although the carriage over there is a little smaller, it is newly bought. It was specially arranged by my mother.\u201dWei Qingwan\u2019s eyes were already red, she bit her lower lip and nodded lightly: \u201cDaughter knows, mother doesn\u2019t have to worry, daughter understands\u2026\u201dHer voice trembled slightly, and it was obvious that she was trying her best to suppress her grievance and sadness.The appearance of being so sad but still pretending to be strong made Yun\u2019s heart ache for a while.Wei Ruo stepped forward and said, \u201cMother, don\u2019t worry, sister Qingwan is sensible, so she won\u2019t cry because she changed a carriage. When I just returned home, she said that she would give everything to her.\u201d mine.\u201d\u201cAlthough I didn\u2019t intend to ask for sister Qingwan\u2019s things, since sister Qingwan said so, it means that she has such a heart. Now it\u2019s just a small matter like giving me the carriage she used to ride in. I shouldn\u2019t be sad. \u201cWei Qingwan\u2019s tears welled up in her eyes, and she held back after hearing Wei Ruo\u2019s words.Wei Ruo looked at Wei Qingwan and said, \u201cActually, if my mother hadn\u2019t analyzed the objective reasons, I really wouldn\u2019t mind if I took that smaller carriage. After all, when I was in the countryside, I didn\u2019t even have an ox cart. Yes, it would be nice to have a carriage, and it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s bigger or smaller.\u201dWearing that, Yun\u2019s heart tightened, and when he looked at Wei Ruo\u2019s clear and clear eyes, he suddenly felt uncomfortable.Mr. Yun suddenly felt that there was something wrong with her thoughts these two days. Although Wanwan was wronged a bit, she was not that wronged.After all these years, Wanwan used the standards of Miss Wei\u2019s family. Even if she changed to a smaller carriage now, it would be better than Ruoer\u2019s life before.Thinking about it this way, if she keeps talking about Wanwan\u2019s grievances, it will be unreasonable.After thinking about this point clearly, Yun said to Wei Ruo and Wei Qingwan: \u201cOkay, it\u2019s getting late, you all get on your respective carriages and set off. Especially Ruo\u2019er, today is your first time to go to Xie\u2019s house. Be careful.\u201d\u201cUnderstood.\u201d Wei Ruo replied, then turned around smartly, and got on the big carriage neatly.Wei Qingwan hesitated for a while, and after confirming that Yun would not change her mind, she got into the obviously smaller and shabby carriage with the help of the maid Cui He.Getting into the car, Wei Qingwan began to sob.\u201cMiss, stop crying, be careful not to damage your eyes.\u201d Cui He hurriedly comforted her.\u201cI don\u2019t want to cry, but the tears can\u2019t stop falling, and my heart feels uncomfortable.\u201dWei Qingwan said sadly, and then glanced at the dilapidated carriage, \u201cI don\u2019t even have the qualifications to ride in my family\u2019s carriage now, I guess it won\u2019t be long before I\u2019m kicked out of the house\u2026\u201dCui He hurriedly comforted: \u201cMiss, don\u2019t think too much, it\u2019s just that you lost the thing of studying, the master, wife and young masters still love you as before.\u201dAs the daughter of Nanny Li, Cuihe has the same views as Nanny Li.They all believe that the second miss is loved by her family, and she must live better than the eldest miss in the future.\u201cWho knows, the eldest brother is also very good to my sister now\u2026 My sister is more capable than me, and can get into the eyes of Mr. Wang and Xie\u2019s family, but I am nothing\u2026\u201d\u201cBut the madam has already annoyed the eldest lady, and the eldest miss has repeatedly contradicted her, and the madam\u2019s sense of guilt and compensation for her is about to be wiped out by her.\u201d Cui He continued.\u201cYou don\u2019t need to comfort me anymore, I know what kind of situation I am in now\u2026\u201dDifferent from before, after experiencing this oolong incident, Wei Qingwan became much more pessimistic, and it was no longer Nanny Li and Cui He who could persuade her with a few words.###At this moment, Wei Ruo is in the carriage.When she went out, she brought a lot of things in big bags and small bags, which she called the four treasures of the study to her family.Actually, there are several account books mixed in the middle.She can just take advantage of the time on the way to and from school to read the account books for a while, so that she won\u2019t be too bored.Arriving at Xie\u2019s house, Wei Ruo was taken to the school that Xie\u2019s house set up at home.Xie\u2019s mansion is much more spacious and magnificent than Xiaowei\u2019s mansion. After entering the door, the nanny in the mansion led them all the way, and Wei Ruo almost fainted.When we arrived at the place, there were two tables inside, which was very spacious.Wang Caiwei and Xie Ying are already here.The empty table on the left is reserved for Wei Ruo. Brand new pens, inks, papers and inkstones have been placed on it. There is no doubt that the Xie family prepared them for her, probably because she may miss or forget to bring them.Wei Ruo glanced at the things on the table, they were all from Sibaozhai, and they were the same as those placed in front of Xie Ying.After Wei Ruo was seated, Wang Caiwei introduced herself to the two.As a proclaimed talented woman, Wang Caiwei does not have outstanding appearance, but her face makes people feel very comfortable, full of bookish, peaceful and serene feeling.Then Wang Caiwei asked Xie Ying and Wei Ruo to introduce themselves.After the introduction, she did not start teaching immediately, but took a few books for the two to choose.Among them, there are books such as \u201cNvjie\u201d, \u201cNvxun\u201d, and \u201cNvlunyu\u201d, as well as books such as \u201cBook of Songs\u201d, \u201cBook of Changes\u201d, \u201cSpring and Autumn\u201d, and \u201cSun Tzu\u2019s Art of War\u201d.After studying for a while, Wei Ruo and Xie Ying chose one.Wei Ruo chose \u201cBook of Changes\u201d. I heard that the book of changes can be read well and can tell fortunes. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s true or not.Xie Ying chose \u201cSun Tzu\u2019s Art of War\u201d.Good guy, Miss Xie\u2019s family is even fiercer than her!Seeing the choice of the two, Wang Caiwei nodded with a smile: \u201cI know how to teach you, please sit down first.\u201d(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 53": "Chapter 53 - Seedlings grow intoPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 53 Seedlings GrowUnexpectedly, Wang Caiwei did not criticize Wei Ruo and Xie Ying\u2019s choice, but asked them to sit down, and then began to give lectures to them.Wei Ruo originally had no hope for listening to the class, but Wang Caiwei\u2019s teaching is not as boring as she imagined. She will tell them vivid allusions and stories behind the text, and will also make appropriate adjustments from the text itself. expand and relate.Xie Ying, who was originally listless, also seemed to have been beaten with chicken blood, staring with two eyes, listening very engrossed.Especially when listening to Wang Caiwei talk about large-scale wars in history, Wei Ruo felt that Xie Ying was about to jump up and fight with others.In the morning, the two teach together. In the afternoon, Wang Caiwei arranged for the two to learn a skill each.Burning incense and tea, flower arranging and hanging paintings are the four most popular arts nowadays, and every lady should learn at least one of them. Wang Caiwei asked Wei Ruo to learn how to make incense and burn incense, and Xie Ying to learn how to hang paintings.Wang Caiwei\u2019s arrangement Xie Ying was not satisfied. Wei Ruo didn\u2019t know that she was very satisfied with the course content Wang Caiwei chose for herself.After a day, Wei Ruo felt pretty good, much more interesting than she expected.During the period, Mr. Wang also talked about some rules. Compared with Madam Li\u2019s rigid explanation, Mr. Wang\u2019s explanation is like spring rain moistening things, which is easier to accept.###After a few days like this, there was new progress in the south of the city. Wei Ruo had to ask Mr. Wang for leave to deal with the south of the city.After fifteen days of seedling cultivation, the seedlings in the experimental field in the south of the city have grown green.During this period, Nanny Zhang would report to Wei Ruo on the situation of the seedlings every other day.Seeing the vigorous growth of the seedlings, Madam Zhang became more active from her reluctance at the beginning.At first she was reluctant because she felt that Wei Ruo was messing around, but when she saw the seedlings growing lush and lush, Mammy Zhang suddenly realized that this young lady from the countryside really has two brushes!\u201cMiss, I reckon that we can start planting rice seedlings in the next two days, but you have to go to see it before you can make a decision.\u201dNurse Zhang doesn\u2019t dare to make up her own mind now, so she has to ask Wei Ruo for instructions.\u201cGo and report this situation to your mother.\u201d Wei Ruo said.Although the seedlings are only successful and the rice has not been officially harvested, it is enough to show that the saline-alkali land she improved can already grow rice normally.Wei Ruo needs to report this result to Wei Mingting, but she can\u2019t directly go to Wei Mingting now, so she can only report to Yun first.Nurse Zhang immediately followed suit and ran to Cangyun Garden to report the good news.When Nanny Zhang reported to Yun Shi, Wei Qingwan was also in Cangyun Garden, chatting with Yun Shi.After listening to Zhang Nanny\u2019s words, Yun\u2019s face was pleasantly surprised: \u201cReally? Really?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s true, the old slave has been staring at it for a month, the seedlings are growing really well! It\u2019s lush and lush, the old slave is not exaggerating at all, the seedlings grow better than the ones we planted on the Mantou Mountain in the north of the city! \u201c\u201cThat\u2019s great! I\u2019ll send someone to notify the master immediately!\u201d Yun said quickly.Mr. Yun hurriedly called the guard Jing Hu, and explained the matter to him.Seeing Yun\u2019s excited appearance, Wei Qingwan\u2019s expression involuntarily changed.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect my sister to really succeed. It\u2019s really great.\u201d Wei Qingwan said.\u201cYes. If it really happens, this matter will be of great help to your father and the entire Captain\u2019s Mansion.\u201dMr. Yun didn\u2019t notice her daughter\u2019s downcast expression, she was immersed in this excitement.She then said to Nanny Zhang: \u201cMommy Zhang, go and call Ruoer over.\u201dZhang Momo hurriedly said: \u201cMa\u2019am, besides letting the old slave report the matter to you, the young lady also asked the old slave to ask Madam for instructions. She is going to the south of the city. If the seedlings grow properly, they will be put away for transplanting.\u201d .\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, the timing of planting the seedlings is very important and cannot be delayed, so I won\u2019t delay her from doing business.\u201d\u201cExactly.\u201d\u201cHowever, let the master see the growth of the seedlings now. If the seedlings are planted, it is not clear whether they were planted from the wasteland in the south of the city or transported from other places.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026 Madam, what do you think this matter should be done?\u201d\u201cYou ask Ruo\u2019er to wait until her father replies. If he has time, let him go and have a look. It\u2019s best to take Qian Zhixian with him. If you don\u2019t have time, let Ruo\u2019er follow the original Let\u2019s make a plan to transplant rice seedlings.\u201d\u201cOkay, then the old slave will report back to the eldest lady first.\u201d\u201cWell, let\u2019s go.\u201dIn this matter, Yun respects Wei Ruo\u2019s decision very much.After a while, Nanny Zhang came back again, bringing back Wei Ruo\u2019s meaning: \u201cMiss said, she will go to the south of the city first to see the condition of the seedlings. If there is any news from the master, you can let the master directly Go to the south of the city.\u201d\u201cJust do what Ruo\u2019er wants.\u201d Yun said.With Yun\u2019s consent, Nanny Zhang went back to follow Wei Ruo\u2019s order.Accompanied by Nanny Zhang, Wei Ruo left the city in a carriage.Wei Ruo was very satisfied with seeing the excellent seedling fields.Agui and Xiaoba, who were in charge of the cultivation, also seemed extremely happy.If the seedlings grow well, it means that there may be a good harvest. This is undoubtedly good news for Xingshan County, which has suffered from successive harvests.\u201cMiss, what are we going to do now, do we want to raise seedlings?\u201d Agui asked.\u201cWait a minute, let\u2019s see if my father wants to come here to see it. Now you go to reclaim the wasteland next to it. If this is done, the reclamation of other wastelands will be on the agenda soon.\u201d Wei Ruo confessed.\u201cgood!\u201dAgui and Xiaoba were full of energy and acted immediately.Wei Ruo went to check nearby again.After about an hour, Wei Ruo saw a large group of people coming towards him.In the distance, Wei Ruo saw Wei Mingting who was riding a horse at the front. His armor hadn\u2019t taken off yet, so he must have rushed over immediately after receiving the news, and he didn\u2019t have time to change clothes.Immediately afterwards, she saw Qian Zhixian and Chu Lan who came with Wei Mingting.Qianzhi County will come if Wei Ruo can foresee that the success of wasteland improvement is also a political achievement for Qianzhi County, and he will definitely take it seriously.But Chu Lan was beyond her expectations. Seeing his figure, Wei Ruo frowned slightly, instinctively resisting too much contact with this person.Not long after, the large army arrived in front of Wei Ruo and the others.Wei Ruo came forward to welcome Zhang Nanny, Agui and Xiao Ba.Wei Ruo leaned slightly and saluted: \u201cI have met my lord father and I have met my lord Qian.\u201dAs for Chu Lan, he didn\u2019t reveal his identity to the outside world, so it\u2019s no wonder Wei Ruo didn\u2019t salute him.\u201cThere\u2019s no need to be too polite.\u201d Wei Mingting\u2019s voice couldn\u2019t hide his excitement.When he came over, he saw the lush and vibrant seedling field beside Wei Ruo from a distance.The verdant green contrasts sharply with the surrounding barren land.Other people who came with Wei Mingting were also observing Wei Ruo\u2019s seedling field at close range.(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 54": "Chapter 54 - unanimously praisedPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 54 was unanimously praisedAfter some observations, everyone\u2019s faces were filled with joy, even Chu Lan, who had always been indifferent, was no exception.Qian Zhixian praised excitedly: \u201cMaster Wei really raised a good daughter! He actually planted crops in this barren land! In this way, the area of cultivated land in Xingshan County will be greatly increased! It is really a solution.\u201d It has met the urgent needs of the people of Xingshan County!\u201dLu Yuhong, who came with Chu Lan, praised it very directly: \u201cIsn\u2019t this amazing? There aren\u2019t even a few weeds next to it, and you can grow live crops here! And I saw that the seedlings grew faster than Xingshan The rest of the county is even better!\u201dWei Mingting listened to everyone\u2019s praise, looked at the neatly dressed daughter in front of him, and felt joyful and proud: \u201cIt\u2019s ashamed to say that my little girl has all these abilities through her own hard work. As a father, I can\u2019t do anything. Responsibility, and failed to teach her anything.\u201dPraise of his daughter is the truth, Wei Mingting is not humble, but he is really ashamed to say that he is a good teacher.Qian Zhixian said: \u201cLord Wei, don\u2019t be humble. You are busy for the safety of the people of Xingshan County. Now Ling Ai is also risking her life for the people of Xingshan County to come to the south of the city to open up wasteland. You father and daughter This piece of love for the people is the same.\u201dAt this time, Chu Lan spoke and asked Wei Ruo: \u201cI have a question for Miss Wei.\u201d\u201cSir, please tell me.\u201d Wei Ruo didn\u2019t dodge.\u201cI think there are still seedlings growing in this field, but ordinary rice should be heading at this time. You are still in the state of seedlings. Isn\u2019t it too late?\u201d Chu Lan asked.Just now everyone was immersed in the joy of successfully planting seedlings in the wasteland improvement, and for a moment forgot this key point. When Chu Lan spoke, Wei Mingting and Qian Zhixian both looked at Wei Ruo, and their eyes were also full of concern for this question. Confuse.Wei Ruo replied: \u201cYoung master, don\u2019t worry, the seeds I sow in this seedling field are new rice seeds brought over from Huzhou Prefecture. They are slightly different from ordinary rice seeds. They are sown in June and July of the lunar calendar. It lasts about 160 days, and it will not be mature until November for harvest.\u201dHearing that, the three people in front of Wei Ruo showed surprise expressions again.Whether it is Qian Zhixian who is a parent official, Chu Lan who is in the royal family, or Wei Mingting who is a military attache, they all know clearly that being able to plant rice at different times in the case of limited arable land is tantamount to artificially distributing rice. The area of cultivated land has expanded.But right now they haven\u2019t seen the mature rice, and they don\u2019t dare to believe Wei Ruo\u2019s words easily.Chu Lan said: \u201cWhen the rice that Ms. Wei tried to plant here matures, and I am sure that Ms. Wei can help Xingshan County increase the arable area and increase grain production, I will report this matter to the court.\u201dHearing this, Qian Zhixian felt a little excited, because if it was reported, most of the credit would belong to the Wei family, but he, the county magistrate, would also have a share.Wei Mingting\u2019s reaction was a bit muted, without much joy, but it could be seen that he was looking forward to this matter.Wei Ruo was not very happy. If someone else told her these things today, she would be in a better mood, but Chu Lan, she really didn\u2019t want to have anything to do with him.Qian Zhixian then asked Chu Lan for instructions: \u201cYoung master, do you think this wasteland in the south of the city can be handed over to the government office and Xiaowei\u2019s mansion for large-scale development?\u201dChu Lan had an order, he only wanted them to know this trip, not even his family members, so Qian Zhixian immediately changed his name.Miss Wei\u2019s trial planting has been successful, and Qian Zhi County must find a way to expand the scale no matter it is out of personal political achievements or for the survival of the people.Chu Lan replied: \u201cXingshan County is under the jurisdiction of Qianzhi County. How to develop the wasteland can be decided by Qianzhi County. There is no need to ask me for instructions.\u201dQian Zhixian: \u201cExcuse me\u2026 I know.\u201dThen Qian Zhixian asked Wei Mingting, Wei Ruo and his daughter: \u201cMaster Wei, Miss Wei, are you willing to contract all the barren land in the south of the city?\u201dWei Mingting did not answer immediately, but looked at Wei Ruo.The matter of reclamation of the wasteland in the south of the city was proposed by the daughter, and it was the daughter who spent time and energy. If the area of land reclamation is expanded in the future, it must be the daughter who has worked hard, so the decision-making power should be given to the daughter.Wei Ruo replied: \u201cFather, my daughter thinks that the wasteland in the south of the city is very large. If all of it is reclaimed by our school\u2019s Weifu, it will inevitably be a bit powerless. Why don\u2019t we give the wasteland to the people for reclamation. Many people in the city have lost their livelihoods. Especially the fishermen who were unable to go fishing due to the Japanese pirates\u2019 rebellion, if we give them some wasteland and teach them how to improve farming, they will definitely try their best to do it.\u201dWei Mingting was deeply moved, so he turned to ask the magistrate Qian: \u201cMaster Qian, what my daughter said is true, such a large wasteland cannot be reclaimed with the power of the county government and the school captain\u2019s mansion alone. It is better to leave it to the common people. Let them have land to cultivate and grain to harvest!\u201dQian Zhixian said: \u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to distribute it to the people, but that Japanese pirates are rampant now, and this south of the city is not a safe place. Although Wangyue Mountain isolates the south and east sides of Xingshan County, it is difficult to guarantee that there will be no Japanese people. Over the mountain\u2026 If too many people are allowed to freely enter and exit the south of the city, it may bring many hidden dangers\u2026\u201dThis is indeed a problem, which is why Wei Ruorang\u2019s nanny and the government applied to reclaim the wasteland in the south of the city but was rejected.\u201cIt\u2019s not a difficult task.\u201d Chu Lan suddenly said.Everyone looked at Chu Lan, and Wei Ruo also looked at him.Chu Lan\u2019s eyes were deep: \u201cRecently, the imperial court will send more troops to Xingshan County. At that time, we will set up defenses at Wangyue Mountain and the important checkpoints in the south of the city, so that the south of the city will be guaranteed and the people will be able to farm here with confidence.\u201dAfter listening to Chu Lan\u2019s words, Zhixian Qian and Wei Mingting had different expressions.It is a good thing that the imperial court is willing to send more troops here, but they just don\u2019t know whether the Wei family, who is disadvantaged in fighting against the Japanese, and Qianzhi County, who failed to bring the people of Xingshan County to eat, will be punished.Then Chu Lan looked at Wei Ruo: \u201cMiss Wei wants the people to reclaim the wasteland here, so are you willing to give them the method of improving the wasteland?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d Wei Ruo gave an affirmative answer without hesitation.Isn\u2019t this nonsense, if you distribute the wasteland to the people and let them come to the south of the city but don\u2019t teach them how to improve it, do you want them to come to the south of the city to look at the scenery in a daze?Chu Lan showed a satisfied expression: \u201cAfter expanding the scale, the manpower and material resources needed will inevitably increase. In order to help Ms. Wei reclaim the wasteland better, I will send some people for Ms. Wei to send. Ms. Wei can do it freely.\u201d\u201cThank you for your kindness, son, but I am different from you, so I should avoid suspicion.\u201d Wei Ruo said hurriedly.(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 55": "Chapter 55 - Ruoer is really sensiblePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 55 Ruoer is really sensible\u201cMiss Wei doesn\u2019t have to worry about this. If I want to send someone to help Miss Wei, I will naturally send a nanny to hand over to Miss Wei. She won\u2019t let Miss Wei deal with me or other men.\u201d Chu Lan explained.Seeing that men and women are different, this excuse did not dissuade Chu Lan, Wei Ruo looked up at Wei Mingting, hoping that Wei Mingting would help her refuse.Wei Mingting seems to have received Wei Ruo\u2019s distress signal, he turned his head and looked at Chu Lan, \u201cLoving the people is a blessing for the people, but my daughter has no experience in dispatching large-scale personnel, let her take it slow\u2026\u201dChu Lan interrupted: \u201cMaster Wei, don\u2019t need to say too much, Miss Wei is the most qualified to improve the wasteland in the south of Xingshan County. If she says no, no one should be able to say that she can.\u201dWei Mingting had no choice but to say: \u201cSince it is the son\u2019s kindness, you should accept Ruo\u2019er. The son has a kind heart, so I hope that the people of Xingshan County can have enough to eat.\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019d rather be obedient than respectful.\u201d Wei Ruo had no choice.After talking with Wei Mingting, Qian Zhixian, Chu Lan and others, Wei Ruo ordered Agui and Xiaoba to pick up the seedlings and prepare to transplant them.When raising seedlings, the sowing is relatively dense. When transplanting rice seedlings, in order to ensure that each rice plant can fully receive the light and nutrients in the soil, the interval between seedlings will be larger.So there must be a lot of seedlings grown from the two-acre seedling field to plant the two-acre paddy field.\u201cFather, did some seedlings die in the rice fields we planted on Mantou Mountain this year?\u201d Wei Ruo asked Wei Mingting.The Wei family and other families in Xingshan County grow early rice, which has passed the transplanting period long ago. The growth is normal, and it is already taller than a child at this moment.But Wei Ruo heard that due to the weather, the rice of many families in Xingshan County did not grow well, and some of them died directly.\u201cYour mother did mention it to me.\u201dDuring Wei Mingting\u2019s short stay at home, Yun\u2019s would not bother him with ordinary trivial matters at home, but a lot of rice in the family died. This matter is related to the family\u2019s harvest in autumn, and Yun\u2019s did not dare to hide it from Wei Mingting, so he informed Wei Mingting early. He, get ready early.\u201cFor the extra seedlings that will grow here in a while, please ask my father to find someone to send to the Mantou Mountain in the north of the city to make up for the dead parts.\u201d Wei Ruo said.Wei Mingting was stunned for a moment, then happily said: \u201cRuoer is thoughtful!\u201dI can\u2019t help but feel that my daughter is delicate and considerate of her family.What Wei Ruo thought was that if she sends the seedlings to the north of the city later, she can drop by Xiaoyang Mountain.As for the seedlings, if you don\u2019t give them to the Wei family\u2019s own fields, you can only give them to others. There is no time to plant other wastelands before they are reclaimed. She doesn\u2019t know the situation of other people\u2019s homes.In any case, it is the seedlings they planted with hard work, and it is always a pity to throw them away.After all the seedlings were planted, Wei Ruo ordered Agui and Xiaoba to plow the land again and prepare for transplanting.And Wei Ruo went back first, and some of the seedlings that were going to be sent to Weijia Mantou Mountain in the north of the city were going back with Wei Ruo.On the way back, Wei Ruo lay in front of the carriage window, looking at the scenery along the way.Xiumei squeezed Wei Ruo\u2019s shoulder and calf.\u201cMiss, should we choose a few reliable people and give them the method of improving the land, so that no one else will know.\u201d Xiumei asked.\u201cNo, I can directly disclose this method, which is more efficient.\u201d Wei Ruo said.\u201cThen what if the apprentice dies of starvation after teaching?\u201d Xiumei asked.This is not Mojiashan. The villagers of Mojiashan have a good relationship with them. The lady taught them not to worry about anything. They are not familiar with the people here, so they are afraid that a few mouse droppings will get mixed in.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, they have learned it, but they have only learned the surface. They have not learned the underlying logic, so they will not really teach the disciples to starve to death of the master. What\u2019s more, the good skills of Miss Ni and I are not bad for this one. \u201cSome skills Wei Ruo wants to keep for himself to make money for a living, but some skills can be shared to help those innocent people who are suffering.For example, this method of improving the land is not very useful for her to keep, and there are not barren lands everywhere that need her to improve, and she is unlikely to make too much money by relying on this method.Moreover, she does not teach others the methods of improving wasteland, because the improvement methods of different wastelands are different, and each barren soil has its own method of impoverishment, so there are different improvement methods.Even if it is all saline-alkali land, the method of neutralization and improvement is not static. How much to use and how to deploy are all particular. She only shared the improvement method of the wasteland in this area. If someone uses it elsewhere Go, is not going to work.###Soon, the matter in the south of the city reached Yun\u2019s ears, and Yun was very excited to hear it.Improve the land and successfully grow crops, and have rice seeds that can be planted later. Not only have I won the praise of the adults, but I am also thinking about the yield of the terraced fields at home.Everything that Wei Ruo has done has entered into Yun\u2019s heart.Praised Wei Ruo several times, and every time she praised Wei Ruo, Wei Qingwan\u2019s mood sank a little.Wei Qingwan\u2019s change of mood Yun didn\u2019t notice, she got the news and hurriedly arranged for people to go to Mantou Mountain to replant the seedlings that Wei Ruo took back.When Wei Ruo arrived at the Wei Mansion, the Yun family greeted Wei Ruo at the door for the first time.\u201cRuoer, you have worked hard these days!\u201d Yun\u2019s face was full of joy.\u201cI won\u2019t go back to the mansion for now, I\u2019ll take these seedlings and go directly to Mantou Mountain. Have you arranged the manpower for transplanting here?\u201d Wei Ruo asked, with no expression on his face, it was just a routine.\u201cIt\u2019s been arranged. I set off for Mantou Mountain 15 minutes ago. I can start planting the rice seedlings only when they arrive.\u201d Yun replied.\u201cThat\u2019s good. I\u2019ll follow along and take a look at the growth of the crops on Mantou Mountain.\u201d Wei Ruo said.\u201cThat\u2019s fine, but Ruo\u2019er still needs to pay attention to her body, and don\u2019t tire herself out too much.\u201d Yun said with concern.\u201cYeah.\u201d Wei Ruo didn\u2019t continue to gossip with Yun Shi, and immediately asked Uncle Liu, who was driving, to go to Mantou Mountain in the north of the city after getting her approval.When facing Yun\u2019s, Wei Ruo said to see the growth of Mantou Mountain, but in fact it was to see her Xiaoyang Mountain justifiably.Wei Ruo\u2019s real thoughts are unknown to Yun\u2019s family. She just thinks that her daughter is very sensible and considerate of her family. She used extra seedlings to make up for the dead rice fields at home, and went to the family\u2019s terraced fields to check the situation in person.Yun\u2019s heart was very touched. Although there are some small conflicts in the family, my daughter is still very knowledgeable about the family business!Wei Ruo: It\u2019s a pity to throw it away. Plant it wherever you have time. By the way, use it as an excuse to look at my own property.Wei Mingting, Yun Shi: My daughter is really sensible, she really cares about her family!(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 56": "Chapter 56 - helped a lotPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 56 was a great helpWei Ruo\u2019s carriage went all the way north, and when it arrived near Mantou Mountain in the north of the city, the stewards here had already received orders from Yun\u2019s, and they were waiting early.After Wei Ruo asked the manager to arrange for the long-term workers to replant the seedlings in the vacant area, he excused himself to walk around and left accompanied by Xiumei.Along the way, Wei Ruo found that the rice fields here are not growing well, and there are still large areas of death.The situation in some rice fields is more serious than that of the Wei family.This is not a good sign. If this situation continues, this year\u2019s autumn harvest will be worrying.The nanny had written to her earlier about the food situation in Xingshan County this year, but now that she saw it with her own eyes, she realized that the situation was worse than she thought.Wei Ruo brought Xiumei to Xiaoyang Mountain.Most of the original barren hills have been planted with sweet potatoes, with green leaves all over the ground, and the growth is gratifying.Now I still pick some vine leaves every day and sell them in the market.The price of two pennies is very close to the people, whether it is wealthy or ordinary people, they can afford it.Therefore, one car a day is not enough to sell.Although the price of two pennies is not high, it can still be profitable.For ordinary fruits and vegetables, Wei Ruo tends to make small profits but sell them quickly, and she tends to sell high prices for \u201cluxury goods\u201d aimed at the upper class.Wei Ruo randomly selected a piece of land, dug up a corner, and checked the growth of sweet potatoes inside.The sweet potatoes at this time have not yet grown to the optimal size. They are still a little small, only a small section like a little finger, which is far from the standard size for harvesting. However, it can be seen that the current growth condition is good, and there are no pests and diseases.The seeds of Wei Ruo Space are all excellent species, which are excellent in resistance to diseases and insect pests, drought and waterlogging. And the growth rate is relatively fast among the same kind. It is estimated that in another month, all the sweet potatoes will be fully grown.At that time, they can be sold one after another. Some of them are stored in the warehouse, and the remaining part of Wei Ruo intends to make dried sweet potatoes for preservation, and part of the dried sweet potatoes will be sold in preserved fruit shops.During the Dragon Boat Festival trip, Wei Ruo took the opportunity to inspect several preserved fruit shops, and finally chose one, planning to cooperate with the other party to sell dried sweet potatoes and sweet potato chips in the other shop.In this way, for Wei Ruo, the risk of opening a separate store for sales can be saved, and at the same time, it can also increase sales for itself with the help of the customer traffic that the preserved fruit store already has.Wei Ruo stayed in Xiaoyang Mountain until the evening, and then returned to Wei\u2019s Mantou Mountain.The seedling transplanting work is coming to an end, Wei Ruo glanced at it casually, got into the carriage and went back.By the time Wei Ruo returned to Wei Mansion, it was past the usual time for dinner in Wei Mansion.Wei Ruo came home late, and the Wei family didn\u2019t have a meal in advance. They waited until Wei Ruo came back before Yun informed the kitchen to arrange the dishes.After dinner, when sitting together drinking tea, Yun asked Wei Ruo about the details of today.\u201cRuo\u2019er has really done a great job in the wasteland in the south of the city. My mother really didn\u2019t expect that Ruo\u2019er could really improve and successfully grow crops. My mother underestimated Ruo\u2019er before.\u201d Yun said with emotion.\u201cYes.\u201d Wei Ruo replied in a low voice.\u201cRuo\u2019er, your decision to put the seedlings in the Mantou Mountain is also a great favor to the family. This year, the seedlings in everyone\u2019s fields have died to varying degrees. Our family is relatively good, and nearly half of them died. Before autumn, the food situation of this year can already be foreseen, the people in the city are worried, and the wives of the families I know can\u2019t help but worry about this matter.\u201dThe Zhongtian property has not been harvested year after year, and even some well-established families in Xingshan County may not be able to bear it.The people of this large family are waiting to eat, and if they want to buy food every day, they don\u2019t know how much money it will cost.What\u2019s more, if everyone is short of food, the price of food will inevitably rise, and even if you want to buy food yourself, it will become very difficult.Wei Ruo sipped tea, but didn\u2019t answer. What she was thinking now was that if she knew that everyone\u2019s seedlings were dead, she should have secretly sold the extra seedlings, and she should be able to sell them for a lot of money.\u201cWhat happened in the south of the city today, Ruo\u2019er will tell Wei Niang in detail.\u201d Yun also wanted to hear Wei Ruo talk about the specific process.\u201cThe seedlings are growing well, father and Master Qian both agree. There is also a son from the capital who wants to help, and will send someone over tomorrow.\u201d Wei Ruo replied lightly, everything was taken care of by her.She doesn\u2019t want to mention Chu Lan\u2019s matter, and the person he sent will be at the mansion tomorrow, and with his status, it is impossible for Wei Mingting not to notify the mansion in advance.\u201cYour Excellency, do you want to help?\u201d Yun asked in surprise.Wei Qingwan also raised her head to look at Wei Ruo.Now in Xingshan County, the only one who can be called a \u201cnoble man\u201d by the Wei family is the young man in Jinyi who caught a glimpse on the street that day.Although the identity of the nobleman has not been fully disclosed, the Wei family has already guessed seven or eight points based on the news from the capital.\u201cWell, he seems to be very concerned about the suffering of people\u2019s livelihood.\u201d Wei Ruo was very annoyed by Chu Lan, and didn\u2019t even want to talk about things related to her.Wei Ruo spoke calmly, but the hearts of those who listened were turbulent.\u201cYeah, it should be like this. Since the nobleman wants to help, then you should be more cautious.\u201d Yun immediately told Wei Ruo.\u201cI did my best when it comes to farming.\u201d Wei Ruo replied, but it wasn\u2019t for Chu Lan to see.Yun said with some emotion: \u201cI thought Wanwan and Ms. Qian would offend the nobleman after they bumped into the nobleman at Fahua Temple that day, but now it seems that the nobleman didn\u2019t take what happened that day to heart, on the contrary. Now, Ruo\u2019er, the matter of you in the south of the city has caught the attention of the nobleman.\u201dWhen Yun Shi said this, Wei Qingwan, who was beside her with her head slightly lowered, trembled.These words were like a slap in the face to her.Coupled with the comparison with Wei Ruo later, Wei Qingwan only felt that she was stepped on the ground.Wei Ruo didn\u2019t really listen to what Yun said, this noble man was not expensive at all to her, she wished she could stay far away.Wei Yilin pursed his mouth and glanced at Wei Ruo several times. No matter how he looked at it, he didn\u2019t really believe that Wei Ruo could make such a career.Why would Wei Qingruo be able to do something that even sister Wanwan couldn\u2019t do? Sister Wanwan is so much better than her!After dinner, Wei Qingwan felt like chewing wax.She left Cangyun Garden with a sad and lonely mood.When Wei Yichen saw her, he chased after her and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with Wanwan? Are you feeling unwell?\u201d\u201cBrother, am I useless?\u201d Wei Qingwan asked softly.\u201cWhy does Wanwan ask like that?\u201d(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 57": "Chapter 57 - you shouldn't have such thoughtsPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 57 You shouldn\u2019t have such thoughts\u201cI\u2019m not as good as my sister who can do a good job, earn merits for the Wei family, and make the Wei family favored by the nobles. I\u2019m really useless\u2026\u201d Wei Qingwan bit her lip, her eyes glistening with tears.Wei Yichen frowned, \u201cWanwan, why do you have such an idea?\u201d\u201cI\u2026 I just feel that I am not as good as my sister in every way, and I will definitely not be liked by you.\u201dAfter Wei Qingwan finished speaking, she thought that Wei Yichen would comfort her, but unexpectedly, Wei Yichen stopped, frowned, and looked at her solemnly.\u201cBrother?\u201d Wei Qingwan looked at Wei Yichen suspiciously.\u201cWanwan, we should be happy if Ruoer is excellent, and we shouldn\u2019t think that the other person\u2019s excellence will make us lose favor and be disliked. We are family members, even good and bad are family members; we are family members, how can we Comparing everything?\u201d Wei Yichen said solemnly.Wei Qingwan was stunned for a moment, and then suddenly realized that she had slipped her words just now.\u201cBrother, I don\u2019t mean that. I am naturally happy that my sister is excellent. I just realized that I need to work harder after my sister is so good. Otherwise, my brothers and sisters are all so good, and I will be left behind. I also want to do my best for my family.\u201d I did my part.\u201d Wei Qingwan explained.\u201cIt\u2019s okay if you think so.\u201d Wei Yichen\u2019s expression softened, and he added, \u201cJust don\u2019t put too much pressure on yourself, let alone think that Ruo\u2019er\u2019s excellence will affect you. She is excellent, we just want to be happy for her, and we don\u2019t need to think about it.\u201d\u201cWell, I know.\u201d Wei Qingwan responded softly.Seeing this, Wei Yichen didn\u2019t say much, thinking that Wanwan was just a slip of the tongue, she has always been very kind and gentle, so she wouldn\u2019t really have any opinion on Ruoer.After chatting for a few words, the two separated.As soon as she returned to Wangmei Garden, Wei Qingwan threw herself on the bed and cried until the pear blossoms were raining, and it was useless to let Cui He comfort her.\u201cWhen I went to Xie\u2019s house to study, it was my sister who was favored by Mr. Wang, and it was my sister who could improve the wasteland and grow seedlings. Compared with my sister, I am not as good as this or that. I will be abandoned by my parents sooner or later!\u201d\u201cMiss, don\u2019t think so. If you break your body from crying, then the one who is so happy is not the eldest lady? You must not give up on yourself!\u201d Cui He was also worried.She was afraid that Wei Qingwan would be devastated. Once Wei Qingwan fell out of favor, her life as Wei Qingwan\u2019s personal maid would also become difficult.\u201cSo what can I do if I don\u2019t give up on myself, I can\u2019t blame others, I am not the flesh and blood of my parents, I have no blood relationship with them, and it will be a matter of time to be rejected\u2026\u201dThe more Wei Qingwan thought about it, the sadder she became, and the more she thought about it, the more hopeless her future became.\u201cMiss\u2026\u201d Cui He didn\u2019t know how to comfort Wei Qingwan for a while, and muttered: \u201cIt would be great if my mother was here, maybe she can give you some advice, miss.\u201d\u201cBut mama can\u2019t come back now.\u201d Wei Qingwan murmured.If Mammy was here, she would definitely help her.It\u2019s a pity, because of what happened last time, Mammy was sent to Zhuangzi as a punishment.\u201cMiss, why don\u2019t you find an opportunity to ask Madam for mercy, Madam will listen to you if you speak.\u201d Cui He said again.\u201cI\u2026 try it next time.\u201d Wei Qingwan responded in a low voice.###Qian Zhi County was very efficient in handling affairs. After returning home, he posted a public announcement and sent his subordinates to publicize it.But anyone who does not have land, whether they are farmers or fishermen, can go to the government to register. The government will distribute the wasteland in the south of the city to everyone in an orderly manner, and teach everyone how to improve and cultivate the wasteland.As soon as the news came out, a long queue formed at the gate of the county government office.Not long after, the official approval was actually obtained, and the people who had the right to cultivate the land cheered.For a time, the entire county was filled with the joy of the poor people.Seeing such a grand occasion, Lu Yuhong, who was in the teahouse in the distance, couldn\u2019t help expressing emotion: \u201cIt\u2019s really a good idea for Miss Wei to come up with it. Look at these displaced people who have no land, no land, and no food. They are so motivated. Let them come If you work hard, you must be more attentive than the people you hire.\u201dChu Lan stared at the street without commenting, but from his expression, Lu Yuhong could still tell that Chu Lan approved of this matter.\u201cBrother Chu, tell me, in Xingshan County, are you more interested in the boss of Sibaozhai or Miss Wei?\u201d Lu Yuhong\u2019s inexplicable curiosity emerged again.\u201cBrother Yu, you are too curious.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been like this since I was a child, and it\u2019s not the first day that Brother Chu has known me.\u201d Lu Yuhong muttered.\u201cAlthough the things sold by Sibaozhai are good, and the methods are shrewd, they are all for money; Miss Wei\u2019s improvement of wasteland and planting crops is for the people. Comparing the two, it is different. But I am curious about the two. It\u2019s not too serious, the purpose of my trip is to fight against the Japanese.\u201d Chu Lan replied.Lu Yuhong said: \u201cThe people in Xingshan County are really miserable. There are Japanese pirates coming from outside, and they are facing such a schedule inside. I hope that Miss Wei\u2019s method can be useful, and it can really produce food. I also hope that the reinforcements from the imperial court will come soon. Some time.\u201d\u201cWhen the reinforcements arrive, the commanding generals must be capable. If Wei Mingting fails to achieve results this time, his position as a sixth-rank school lieutenant will be lost. Even if he has a daughter who can help the common people. \u201c\u201cIndeed, to be a general, you still need to be able to win battles, but I think Wei Mingting seems to have some skills, otherwise he wouldn\u2019t have defended for so long with so many troops. I also came to Xingshan County and observed carefully. The military strength in Xingshan County is really pitifully small.\u201d Lu Yuhong said with emotion.###After being busy for two days, Wei Ruo went to Xie\u2019s house to study with Xie Ying.After arriving at the Xie Mansion Academy, Wei Ruo sat down in his seat.Mr. Wang has not yet arrived, and Xie Ying is sorting out her war horse picture.Seeing Wei Ruo, Xie Ying, who had never been very curious about Wei Ruo, suddenly looked at her with curious eyes.\u201cHave you really grown crops in the wasteland south of the city?\u201dThe improvement of wasteland in the south of the city to grow crops is the most discussed and most concerned thing in Xingshan County in the past two days. It is hard for Xie Ying to know.\u201cYes.\u201d Wei Ruo nodded.\u201cThen you are amazing.\u201d\u201cThank you for the compliment.\u201d\u201cI seldom praise people. You are the first one I praise you at the same age.\u201d Xie Ying emphasized.\u201cThen I am honored.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not that you are honored, it\u2019s that you are really good. You are much better than those women I have seen who only know how to be jealous and vying for beauty. When I usually meet those people, they are always chattering, and I find it annoying to hear. I I don\u2019t like people like that, I think they are very boring, but now I find that you are very different from those people.\u201dWei Ruo couldn\u2019t help laughing. Xie Ying had been indifferent to her since they had been in class together for so long, and rarely talked to her so much. She didn\u2019t expect to have admiration for her because of her achievements in the wasteland in the south of the city.Is this considered a windfall?Doing an investigation, I feel that the hostess has repeatedly talked to Wei Yilin and Wei Qingwan about those elder sisters and elder sisters who are short-sighted (the time when Wei Yilin apologized, and the time when she ran to Wangmeiyuan to confront Wei Yilin) is **** people off. Deduction 1 for dark damage, deduction 2 for feeling that the heroine is teaching the younger siblings sincerely.Seeing a message saying that the heroine is sick, the Wei family doesn\u2019t take her seriously, but she wants to teach her younger siblings.I can\u2019t fix this.(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I agree with you. If I want to cultivate the land in the south of the city, I have to get my parents\u2019 permission, otherwise I can\u2019t go out easily. Even if my parents agree, I have to go out every time I go out.\u201d Take the nanny at home.\u201d\u201cBut you still did a great job. I heard from my mother that after you succeed in this move, you can help the people in the city and let more people eat. The credit and the soldiers who guard the border and defend the country are the same!\u201dXie Ying admires such a person the most!\u201cIf you like, you can also participate.\u201d Wei Ruo suggested.\u201cCan I do it too?\u201d Xie Ying asked suspiciously.\u201cOf course, there is still a lot of open space in the south of the city to grow things.\u201d\u201cBut isn\u2019t the wasteland in the south of the city mainly cultivated by farmers without land?\u201d Xie Ying asked.\u201cMost of the wasteland in the south of the city was handed over to landless farmers and unemployed fishermen, but because their farming costs were very limited, they were given places with better terrain, close to official roads or water sources, or places with relatively flat terrain. Places with more complex terrain have not been allocated.\u201d\u201cCan crops be grown in places with complex terrain?\u201d Xie Ying asked.\u201cYes, but it is not suitable for planting crops like rice, because the labor cost and maintenance cost are too high. We can grow bamboo, fungi, and various fruits and vegetables, and even medicinal materials.\u201dWei Ruo looked at Xie Ying who was listening seriously, and an idea had already been brewed in his mind.Wei Ruo continued to say to Xie Ying: \u201cIf you are really interested, we can partner.\u201d\u201cPartnership?\u201d Xie Ying looked at Wei Ruo curiously.\u201cYou are not good at farming, and although I am good at doing these things, I have limited freedom and limited time in the Wei family, and there are limited people under my command. If we cooperate, we can learn from each other\u2019s strengths and make up for our weaknesses. The money we earn is based on How about the proportion of effort?\u201d\u201cAlthough I don\u2019t like growing things, I think what you said is very interesting!\u201d Xie Ying was full of interest.Xie Ying grew up spoiled by her grandparents and parents. She has no shortage of money to spend on weekdays, but she is full of novelties about earning money by herself.Especially now that she has a different view on planting.\u201cThen what do you think we should grow?\u201d Xie Ying asked.\u201cYou can plant some medicinal materials. Because of the war, the consumption of medicinal materials is very high. The price of medicinal materials in the city has always been high. After we plant medicinal materials and sell them, we can make money. If the army needs them, we can provide them at cost prices to ensure that the army There will be no shortage of life-saving medicine.\u201d Wei Ruo suggested.\u201cThat\u2019s great! You can make money and help the soldiers!\u201d Xie Ying became more interested and even eager to try.\u201cIf you agree, you will not only have to talk to the county government, but also send people to work in the fields. There are many things to be busy.\u201d Wei Ruo reminded.\u201cThat\u2019s what you need to say? I\u2019m not kidding with you! I, Xie Ying, will make it bigger if I want to! You wait, I will talk to my mother in a while! If my mother disagrees, I will Write a letter and tell my grandfather!\u201d Xie Ying replied domineeringly.Xie Ying is serious.\u201cIn addition, I have another condition. When we cooperate to do these things, you need to keep it secret for me. You can\u2019t tell outsiders, and you can\u2019t tell anyone in my family.\u201d Wei Ruo said.\u201cWhy? I won\u2019t talk about outsiders, why can\u2019t your own family members?\u201d Xie Ying asked puzzled.\u201cWhat if my younger sister wants to participate after my family members know?\u201d Wei Ruo asked.\u201cNo, I don\u2019t like her. She is too troublesome, she seems to fall down when the wind blows, and she always looks at me with a very weak look. I just ignored her before, and she felt wronged as if I beat her It\u2019s like a meal.\u201d Xie Ying refused decisively.\u201cBut once someone finds out and my family gives me an order, it\u2019s hard for me to refuse.\u201d Wei Ruo continued to explain.\u201cIt\u2019s better to keep it a secret. It\u2019s good to keep it a secret. It\u2019s a mystery. When I talk to my mother later, I will tell her to keep it a secret!\u201d Xie Ying said.\u201cOkay, you first get the consent of your family, and then we discuss how to proceed.\u201d Wei Ruo said.Cooperating with Xie Ying has many advantages for Wei Ruo. First, Xie Ying\u2019s temperament is very suitable for her appetite; second, Xie Ying has background and ability, and meets the requirements to be her partner; The most important point is that she can avoid the Wei family.Before the development of wasteland in the south of the city required an official background, she had to get in touch with the government through the Wei family.Now she can use Xie Ying to reclaim a piece of land bypassing the Wei family, and she can also increase an extra part of her income.Xie Ying is usually lazy. Once she encounters something she wants to do, she doesn\u2019t like to procrastinate. During the lunch break, she went to Mrs. Xie to express her thoughts.Ms. Xie thinks this is a good thing. Everyone has seen the achievements made by Miss Wei. It is beneficial and harmless for her daughter to follow Miss Wei to do something meaningful.And this matter is not a big deal to the Xie family, she doesn\u2019t even need to take money from Xie\u2019s family, but just take some money from her own dowry to buy for her daughter.Seeing that Mrs. Xie agreed, Xie Ying was very happy.\u201cThank you mother!\u201d Xie Ying hugged Madam Xie and kissed her on the cheek.\u201cYou little monkey, my mother told you that since you want to do it, you have to do it like Miss Wei\u2019s and make some achievements. Don\u2019t run away halfway through it.\u201d Mrs. Xie urged.Mrs. Xie doesn\u2019t care about Yin Zi, but just hopes that her daughter can develop good habits.\u201cMother, don\u2019t worry, when did I run away? I despise the behavior of running away the most!\u201d\u201cYou also said that you didn\u2019t run away. Last year in the capital, I took you on a flower boat tour. When it was time to go out, you lied there and said you had a stomachache and refused to go.\u201d Mrs. Xie said.\u201cThen\u2026that\u2019s different\u2026\u201d\u201cOkay, okay, this time I choose to trust you. Also, your brother will come to Xingshan County in a few days, and you can ask him to help you if you have anything to do.\u201d Mrs. Xie said with a smile .(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 59": "Chapter 59 - bring shame on oneselfPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 59 Self-inflicted humiliation\u201cHuh? Brother, what is he doing here? Isn\u2019t he preparing for the imperial examination? Shouldn\u2019t he be too busy to leave the class in the academy in the capital.\u201d Xie Ying asked.\u201cMy mother is not very clear about this matter. Anyway, your grandfather and your father both agreed, and you must have something to do before you come here.\u201d\u201cOh, fine. Regardless of that, I\u2019ll go to Wei Qingruo first and tell her that my mother has agreed with us to set up a medicine field, and I want to do it right away!\u201dXie Ying hurried back to the school, found Wei Ruo, and told her the news.\u201cWei Qingruo, my mother has already agreed, when can we start?\u201d Xie Ying was eager to try.\u201cI can do it right away.\u201d Wei Ruo likes this style of doing things without delay.\u201cThen tell me quickly, what we are going to do now, how to arrange the work, what things we need to buy, and how many people we need.\u201d Xie Ying sat down next to Wei Ruo.Wei Ruo took out a pen and paper, and while explaining to Xie Ying, marked the key points on the paper.Xie Ying listened very carefully, pointing out anything she didn\u2019t understand, with a serious and studious look.After finishing the work, I took the paper written by Wei Ruo to find Mrs. Xie to borrow someone, and started working officially, with extremely high efficiency.###Chu Lan was also efficient in handling affairs. After only two days, she sent a nanny to Xiaowei\u2019s Mansion to discuss with Wei Ruo about the south of the city.For this reason, Wei Ruo specially asked Mr. Wang for leave and stayed at home to arrange various things.Mr. Wang did not object to this arbitrarily, and told Wei Ruo that what she is doing now is also a part of learning.Seeing the nanny sent by Chu Lan, Yun\u2019s heart was startled, and she intuitively knew that the other party\u2019s background was not even the slightest difference from her own nanny.In addition, her husband reminded her last night that the nobleman had an unusual status, so she was asked to be careful.After hearing that the other party\u2019s surname is Chu, Mrs. Yun already knew a thing or two. People in the royal family, even those who belong to the unfavorable prince\u2019s family, they can\u2019t afford to offend.Mr. Yun respectfully led the nanny sent by Chu Lan to Tingsongyuan, and then told Wei Ruo a few words before leaving in time, so as not to delay Wei Ruo and the nanny talking about business.\u201cThe old slave has met Miss Wei.\u201d Mother Qin saluted Wei Ruo, with a respectful attitude, but her demeanor remained undiminished, and she looked very majestic.Wei Ruo knew that most of the nuns sent by Chu Lan came from the palace, so they were different from ordinary nuns.Even though the House of Duke Zhongyi is an earl\u2019s house, even in its heyday it could not be compared with the rules of the palace, not to mention it has long since fallen.\u201cYou don\u2019t need to be too polite.\u201d Wei Ruo said, \u201cMaster Ni sent you here to help me, please don\u2019t pay too much attention to the other rules, just pass on my meaning and let the people below complete the task properly .\u201d\u201cMiss Wei, don\u2019t worry, the young master has already explained to the old slave. The old slave should do his best to help Miss Wei. If there is anything that Miss Wei needs the old slave to do, as long as it is related to the reclamation of the wasteland in the south of the city, you can order For Lao Nu, Lao Nu will arrange for people to complete it.\u201dAlthough Mother Qin has very strict rules, she has no airs towards Wei Ruo, nor is she critical of Wei Ruo\u2019s faults. She can clearly tell what she is here for. He will find fault with her rules.Nurse Qin was discussing something with Wei Ruo when Wei Qingwan suddenly entered Tingsong Garden.\u201cSister.\u201d Wei Qingwan came to Wei Ruo and called out sweetly.Wei Ruo\u2019s eyes froze, and he sized up Wei Qingwan.The so-called going to the Three Treasures Palace for nothing, after the oolong incident of Xie\u2019s family reading, Wei Qingwan never came to listen to Songyuan. What kind of wind is blowing today that brought her here?\u201cSister, I brought you some sweet-scented osmanthus cakes.\u201d Wei Qingwan held an exquisite food box in her hand, and when she opened it, it was her specialty pastry, sweet-scented osmanthus cakes.\u201cWait a minute, I\u2019ll talk to you after I finish talking with Mother Qin.\u201dWei Ruo didn\u2019t know which song Wei Qingwan was singing, she didn\u2019t want to talk to Wei Qingwan more, she was afraid that after a few sentences, Wei Qingwan would say something that she disliked and she wouldn\u2019t be able to bear it in front of outsiders.Wei Qingwan nodded slightly, but did not leave, just waited by the side.At this time, Nanny Qin spoke, and she looked at Wei Qingwan: \u201cThis is the second lady of the house, right?\u201dSeeing Mother Qin looking at herself, Wei Qingwan looked shy, lowered her head slightly, and replied softly: \u201cYes.\u201dWho would have thought that Mother Qin would immediately say: \u201cSecond Miss, please stay away. I have business to discuss with Eldest Miss, and it is inconvenient for outsiders to listen in.\u201dWei Qingwan was taken aback for a moment, and then hurriedly changed her words: \u201cWell, then it\u2019s really an unlucky time for me to come, so I\u2019ll go and wait for my sister first.\u201d\u201cSecond Miss did not come by coincidence. I should have known about my visit to the Colonel\u2019s Mansion today. I don\u2019t know why Second Miss didn\u2019t come sooner or later. She chose to come at this time.\u201d Mother Qin spoke in a nonchalant manner. Not tactful.What Mother Qin said was exactly what Wei Ruo thought in her heart. Wei Qingwan\u2019s behavior today is really strange. Because of Chu Lan\u2019s special status, he sent a mother by his side. People in the family should be careful, even Yingzhuyuan has received the news, it is impossible for Wei Qingwan not to know.Wei Qingwan knew it clearly, but she chose to meet Wei Ruo at this time. If she said that she had no other intentions, Wei Ruo would not believe it.But if she had other thoughts, it would be a bit too stupid.Nurse Qin is someone close to Chu Lan, but no matter what, she is just a nanny. Could it be that she thinks that if she behaves better in front of her, she will say something nice to Chu Lan when she returns? Is she a nanny or a matchmaker?This would make sense if there were three aunts and six wives in the village, but Nanny Qin is a nanny from the palace.The royal nurses are very well behaved, how could they do such inexplicable things.Wei Ruo remembers that although Wei Qingwan in the original book is beautiful and weak, she is not stupid. Could it be that she is missing as a supporting role, or she failed to fall in love with Chu Lan according to the original schedule, which caused her to lose her mind?I have only heard that love makes people blind, but I have never heard that not falling in love can also make people blind.After hearing Nanny Qin\u2019s words, Wei Qingwan\u2019s face turned pale, and she hurriedly explained: \u201cDon\u2019t be angry, Mammy, I didn\u2019t mean to eavesdrop on my sister\u2019s speech, I didn\u2019t know that the conversation between Nanny and sister should not be known to outsiders, I I was just worried about my sister\u2019s poor reception, so I specially brought some pastries I made over to have a look.\u201d\u201cExcuse me for my blunt words, the eldest lady is the second young lady\u2019s sister-in-law, and the second lady said to me, an outsider, that she was worried that the eldest lady would not treat her well, what did she want to tell others?\u201dNurse Qin is indeed a person from the palace, with exquisite thoughts, and she can recognize the hidden words in Wei Qingwan\u2019s words as soon as she hears them.Wei Qingwan was immediately ashamed and indignant, and hurriedly explained: \u201cMa\u2019am, you misunderstood. I didn\u2019t mean anything else. It was my inappropriate words that caused a misunderstanding.\u201dXiumei in the corner: This nanny is a bit handsome.(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

If the second miss often makes such mistakes, then this old slave thinks that the second miss needs to read more books and learn some rules. .\u201dWei Qingwan\u2019s face turned green and pale at what Mother Qin said, but she couldn\u2019t refute it.He could only lower his head, and bid farewell to Wei Ruo in embarrassment: \u201cThen I won\u2019t bother my sister and mother.\u201dPlacing down the sweet-scented osmanthus cake, Wei Qingwan left in a hurry.After Wei Qingwan left, Wei Ruo continued to explain the work in Chengnan to Nanny Qin. The workload was heavy and many people were involved.In order not to miss Wei Ruo\u2019s instructions, I specially asked Wei Ruo for a pen and paper to write them down.\u201cThat\u2019s all for the time being. Farming can\u2019t be generalized. It has to be adjusted to local conditions and time. The follow-up arrangements will change from time to time according to the weather and the conditions in the field.\u201d Wei Ruo said.\u201cI understand. I also grew up in a farm family when I was a child. From now on, if the eldest lady has any orders, just contact me at any time. If the development of the south of the city encounters problems and troubles, I will report to the eldest lady as soon as possible.\u201d Qin Mammy replied.\u201cOkay, then work hard, mammy.\u201dAlthough Wei Ruo didn\u2019t like Chu Lan\u2019s participation in this matter, she still approved of the attitude of the nanny he sent.After seeing off Mother Qin, Wei Ruo went to Cangyun Garden.After entering the door, she saw Wei Qingwan was there, with her head down, talking to Yun Shi.Seeing Wei Ruo enter the door, Wei Qingwan raised her head and looked at her with resentment in her eyes.Mr. Yun had a smile on her face: \u201cIf Er is here, how is it? How did you talk with that nanny?\u201dWei Ruo replied: \u201cIt was a good talk.\u201dYun Shi was delighted: \u201cThat\u2019s good, that\u2019s good. Don\u2019t lose courtesy.\u201dWei Ruo said again: \u201cSpeaking of etiquette, I have something to tell my mother.\u201dYun\u2019s puzzled: \u201cWhat is it?\u201dWei Ruo: \u201cToday, I was talking with Nanny Qin. For some reason, sister Qingwan came to see me and interrupted my conversation with Nanny Qin.\u201dHearing this, Yun looked at Wei Qingwan suspiciously.Wei Qingwan quickly explained: \u201cIt\u2019s my daughter\u2019s fault. My daughter made some sweet-scented osmanthus cakes and wanted to give them to my sister.\u201dWei Ruo chuckled lightly: \u201cIf sister Qingwan wants to bring me sweet-scented osmanthus cakes, she can come at any time. Why do you choose to come when Nanny Qin is around?\u201dWei Qingwan explained: \u201cSister, don\u2019t be angry. I was engrossed in making the sweet-scented osmanthus cake. After I was done, I wanted to let my sister taste it. I forgot that my sister was talking with Nanny Qin at this time.\u201d\u201cIf you forgot, then you should have seen Mother Qin when you stepped into Tingsong Garden, why didn\u2019t you choose to avoid coming back later? Instead of interrupting our conversation abruptly?\u201d Wei Ruo questioned .\u201cI\u2026 I didn\u2019t think too much about it, I thought I could just give it to the nanny to taste\u2026\u201d Wei Qingwan said aggrievedly.\u201cSister Qingwan, you said in front of us that we can choose to believe you, but if you say it outside, it will make others think that our Wei family has no rules. Today, Mother Qin came to discuss business with me. The manor knew about it, and my mother specifically warned me, but you came out at this time, and those who didn\u2019t know thought my young lady of the Wei family was so impolite.\u201dWei Qingwan\u2019s eyes were full of tears when Wei Ruo said it, she looked at Yun Shi very aggrieved: \u201cMother, I didn\u2019t, I really didn\u2019t mean it\u2026\u201d\u201cRuo\u2019er, this matter shouldn\u2019t be so serious. Since Wanwan knows she\u2019s wrong, don\u2019t blame her anymore.\u201d The Yun family interceded for Wei Qingwan.\u201cMother doesn\u2019t know something, but because of sister Qingwan\u2019s reckless behavior today, Mother Qin was very angry.\u201d Wei Ruo said.When she heard that Nanny Qin was angry, Yun\u2019s expression also changed.She looked at Wei Qingwan with a serious tone: \u201cWanwan, you are so confused!\u201dWei Qingwan couldn\u2019t hold back anymore, tears fell down one by one.Wei Ruo continued: \u201cMother also knows that Sister Qing Wan and Miss Qian\u2019s family had offended the nobleman last time in Fahua Temple. This time, because of the incident in the south of the city, the nobleman finally looked at our family differently. I left a bad impression and I\u2019m worried\u2026\u201dWei Ruo made the matter serious on purpose.Actually, Wei Ruo knew that Nanny Qin was unlikely to report such a trivial matter to Chu Lan, but it did not prevent her from using Chu Lan to scare Yun and Wei Qingwan.Yun originally wanted to say that the matter was not serious, but after hearing what Wei Ruo had said, he felt that the matter was serious, so he straightened his face and said to Wei Qingwan with a serious expression:\u201cWanwan, you really did something wrong this time, and I will punish you for copying the house rules ten times, as a warning!\u201dHearing this, Wei Qingwan was completely dumbfounded.Since she was a child, she has always been the most well-behaved and sensible child in the hearts of her parents. She has never been punished for anything, and only her younger brother has always been punished for copying books, but today it is her turn?\u201cDaughter knows\u2026\u201d Wei Qingwan lowered her head, her hands in her sleeves clenched into fists.###In Yingzhu Garden, Xiao Bei also said to Wei Jin, \u201cMaster, the person sent by the Seventh Prince has already left.\u201d\u201cWhat did you talk about with Ruo\u2019er?\u201d Wei Jin also asked.\u201cIt\u2019s about the wasteland in the south of the city, and I didn\u2019t talk about other things.\u201d Xiaobeihui reported.\u201cYes.\u201d Wei Jinyi paused for a moment, then asked again, \u201cIs Ruo\u2019er busy every day now?\u201dIt has been a long time since Wei Ruo went to Yingzhuyuan last time.\u201cYes, the eldest lady has been going out early and returning late these days, and she has to make up her mind to make decisions on many things.\u201d Xiaobei replied.\u201cGo to the next door and ask Xiumei to come over. There are some wild game in the small kitchen. You don\u2019t know how to cook it. Ask her to help you.\u201d Wei Jin also said.\u201cAlright young master, I\u2019ll go right away.\u201dXiaobei walked to Tingsongyuan enthusiastically.On the road, Xiaobei thought in his heart that the pheasant and hare were brought to the young master by outsiders, not from the big kitchen.The young master didn\u2019t like to eat game very much at first, but for some reason two days ago, someone outside got some for him.And it has been two days since he was delivered, but the young master never let him move.At first, he was puzzled, but now he understands, he really wants to wait for Miss Xiumei to do it when she is free.Also, Miss Xiumei\u2019s cooking tastes better than his cooking, so the ingredients won\u2019t be wasted.Arrived at the gate of the courtyard, Xiaobei stood at the gate and told Xiumei what Wei Jinyi had just told him.\u201cThen I have to ask my lady.\u201d\u201cMiss Xiumei, please ask, I will wait at the door.\u201d\u201cgood.\u201dXiumei turned around and entered the house, and came back after a while.\u201cMy young lady agreed, but the young lady said that she wanted me to make snacks for her this afternoon, but your young master called me, and her snacks were gone. Ask your young master, what are you going to give to my young lady?\u201d dim sum.\u201d(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 61": "Chapter 61 - so goodPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 61 So Good\u201cThen I\u2019ll go ask my young master.\u201dXiaobei hurried back to Yingzhuyuan to find Wei Jinyi.After listening to Xiaobei\u2019s exclusive, Wei Jin also said: \u201cYou can treat her to the cooked pheasant and hare as compensation for her snacks.\u201dSo Xiaobei went to Songyuan to report again.\u201cOkay, then I\u2019ll go with you.\u201d Xiumei agreed without hesitation.He took a bag of things and went to Yingzhuyuan.Xiaobei wondered: \u201cMiss Xiumei, don\u2019t you need to ask your lady again? What if Miss Ni doesn\u2019t like game?\u201dXiumei glanced at the dull Xiaobei, and said with a smile, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, my lady will definitely like it.\u201dXiumei went to the small kitchen in Yingzhuyuan and started to work.The rabbit meat is braised in soy sauce. In order to cater to Wei Jinyi\u2019s taste, no spicy ingredients were added. Otherwise, according to her lady\u2019s taste, it would have to be spicy.The pheasant made soup, which put some nourishing astragalus and wolfberry.In addition, I fried a sweet potato leaf and a pumpkin tip. The sweet potato leaves were sent by the nanny, and the pumpkin tips were freshly picked in Wei Ruo\u2019s yard.Four side dishes, meat and vegetables, vegetables and soup.When Xiaobei was serving the dishes, Xiumei went to the next door to invite Wei Ruo.After Xiaobei put the four dishes on the table, he told Wei Jin with emotion: \u201cYoung master, the eldest lady is so kind, we asked them to help us cook game, and they also provided us with vegetables and ingredients, and prepared four dishes of color, fragrance and flavor. Complete dishes come out.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Wei Jin also said.\u201cIt would be great if the eldest lady can come and have dinner with us often.\u201d Xiaobei said to himself.He also knew that this was impossible, the master and madam must have asked the eldest lady to go to the dining hall to share with everyone.While speaking, Wei Ruo came and walked into the pavilion with a smile.Wei Jin had already placed a stool for her. After Wei Ruo sat down, his eyes swept over the three dishes and one soup on the table, and the corners of his mouth involuntarily turned up.Her dear rabbit meat, I haven\u2019t eaten it for a long time!Wei Jin also noticed Wei Ruo\u2019s excited little expression, and couldn\u2019t help but smile slightly, and took the initiative to put the rabbit\u2019s leg into Wei Ruo\u2019s bowl.\u201cI caused you to not be able to eat snacks, and this rabbit meat should be regarded as an apology.\u201d Wei Jin also said.\u201cThen I won\u2019t be polite.\u201d Wei Ruo raised her face, smiled at Wei Jin, and then picked up the chopsticks in front of her without any politeness.In fact, the two of them knew each other well. One wanted to find each other to eat pheasant and hare, specially prepared game, and the other wanted to come to Cengfan to make up for the loss of a snack.Only Xiaobei was stupidly ignorant.After a hearty meal, Wei Ruo sat on the wicker chair beside him to rest.\u201cSecond brother, when did you have an extra wicker chair here? I haven\u2019t seen it before.\u201d Wei Ruo asked.\u201cI recently bought a new one. I bought it when it looked good.\u201d Wei Jin also replied.\u201cVery good, you can lie down and rest when you are tired from reading.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d Wei Jin also agreed, and seeing Wei Ruo\u2019s laziness on the wicker chair, he knew that the wicker chair was the right one.\u201cHow are you studying at Xie\u2019s house these few days?\u201d Wei Jin also asked.\u201cVery good. The lady you found is really good. I thought I wouldn\u2019t be able to listen to it, but her teaching is very interesting. I learned some skills about making incense from her, which is similar to my medicine.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d Wei Jin also responded, with no expression on his face as usual.\u201cHow about you, have you been feeling better in recent days?\u201d Wei Ruo asked casually.\u201cWell, your medicine is very useful, and I feel a lot better.\u201d Wei Jin also said.\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d Wei Ruo replied in exactly the same tone as Wei Jinyi.Then lie on the wicker chair, leisurely and leisurely.The relationship between the two is mostly quiet, Wei Jin doesn\u2019t talk much, Wei Ruo sometimes talks to him, sometimes doesn\u2019t talk, just stays quietly and relaxed.###After working hard for a few days, Wei Ruo finally successfully handed over most of the work in the wasteland south of the city at the current stage.I have some free time today, Wei Ruo plans to tidy up the loofahs, pumpkins and gourds in the yard, otherwise I won\u2019t have so much time after going to Xie\u2019s house for class tomorrow.was working in the yard when Xiumei hurried in.\u201cMiss, miss miss\u2026\u201d\u201cMemei, what\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d\u201cThat\u2026 that\u2026\u201d After confirming that there was no one else in Songyuan, Xiumei said to Wei Ruo, \u201cMiss, Brother Xiaoyong got into a fight with Uncle Xu and Nanny, and the quarrel was very fierce!\u201d\u201cwhat happened?\u201d\u201cIt seems that Brother Xiaoyong is going to be a soldier! Haven\u2019t there been a lot of conscription notices posted in the county these days? And because of special circumstances, the age for recruiting soldiers has been lowered from fifteen to fourteen. Brother Xiaoyong is just satisfied, and then he will Said that he also wanted to fight Japanese pirates!\u201d\u201cWhere are others now?\u201d Wei Ruo hurriedly asked.\u201cI was **** at home by Uncle Xu! Uncle Xu has no objection, but the nanny disagrees. As soon as the nanny cried, Uncle Xu **** Brother Xiaoyong!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go, go and call Madam Zhang.\u201d Wei Ruo immediately decided to go out.Now she has an excuse in the south of the city, she can go out almost any time she wants, but she needs to bring Nanny Zhang with her.Although Nanny Zhang didn\u2019t think much of Wei Ruo at first, and felt that Wei Ruo was a bit shabby, but after getting along with Wei Ruo for this period of time, her attitude towards Wei Ruo has changed a lot, and she recognized Wei Ruo\u2019s attitude. After she was able, she began to obey Wei Ruo sincerely.Wei Ruo came to him suddenly, but Nanny Zhang didn\u2019t think there was any problem, so she prepared the carriage without saying a word, and took Wei Ruo out.Not long after the car left, Wei Ruo let the car go to the street. After parking the carriage at the street corner, Wei Ruo told Nanny Zhang to go to Sibaozhai to buy some pens, ink, paper and inkstone.Now that Wei Ruo is already studying, it is normal to buy pens, inks, papers and inkstones. Neither Nanny Zhang nor the driver who is traveling with him thinks there is any surprise in this matter.Wei Ruo put on the hood and got out of the car. Wei Ruo who entered the shop did not look at any products in the shop, but directly entered the backyard through the door of the shop.In the yard, Xu Zhengyong was sitting on the ground, his whole body was tied up, his hands behind his back.He has a stubborn expression: \u201cFather, a good man has ambitions everywhere, and now foreign enemies are attacking and the people are suffering. As a man, I should fight on the front line!\u201dXu Zhushan retorted: \u201cI don\u2019t care about you, as long as you make your mother sad!\u201dIt\u2019s not that Xu Zhushan disagrees with his son\u2019s joining the army, it\u2019s just that his wife is uncomfortable.\u201cFather, my mother thinks like a woman, you are a man, you should understand my thoughts!\u201d Xu Zhengyong retorted.\u201cIt\u2019s useless! If you want to go, you have to find a way to make your mother not worry about you!\u201d Xu Zhushan\u2019s attitude was firm and there was no room for negotiation.The father and son were arguing when Wei Ruo came in.Seeing Wei Ruo, Xu Zhengyong\u2019s eyes lit up, as if he saw a savior: \u201cSister Ruoer!\u201d(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 62": "Chapter 62 - want to protect my sisterPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 62 Want to protect my sisterHearing his son calling Wei Ruo, Xu Zhushan also turned around. Seeing Wei Ruo, he immediately put away the stern expression just now: \u201cMiss, why are you here?\u201d\u201cI heard that you and Brother Xiaoyong had a quarrel, so come over and have a look.\u201d\u201cAh, this brat is disobedient. I\u2019ll be honest after a few whips. It\u2019s not worth your trip to be a lady.\u201dXu Zhengyong, full of grievances, could only protest with his eyes.Mother Xu came out of the house when she heard the voice. When she saw Wei Ruo, her mood improved, she came up to meet her, and hugged Wei Ruo: \u201cMiss.\u201dAlthough the distance is not far, Mama Xu hasn\u2019t looked at Wei Ruo for several days.Before she heard a few words from Xiumei, knowing that the young lady had been locked up in the firewood room in the Xiaowei\u2019s mansion, she realized that the young lady was not as good in the Xiaowei\u2019s mansion as she thought at first.So she was worried that the young lady would not eat well and sleep well in Xiaowei\u2019s mansion, so she tried to bring something to Wei Ruo from time to time.But I have never been able to see Wei Ruo in person, and I am always a little worried.Mother Xu looked at Wei Ruo carefully for a while, and then breathed a sigh of relief after confirming that she was not thin or sick.\u201cNurse stop crying, let\u2019s talk about Brother Xiaoyong slowly.\u201d Wei Ruo said.\u201cSister Ruo\u2019er, please tell my mother for me, she listens to your words the most!\u201d Xu Zhengyong said hastily.\u201cIt\u2019s not big or small, how many times have I said it, don\u2019t call Miss like that!\u201dXu\u2019s mother didn\u2019t know how many times she corrected her son\u2019s address to Wei Ruo.\u201cI don\u2019t, I don\u2019t care if she is a miss from the He family or a miss from the Wei family, she is my sister anyway! Sister Ruo\u2019er said it herself!\u201d Xu Zhengyong didn\u2019t care about it.\u201cWell, yes, Brother Xiaoyong is right.\u201d This is what Wei Ruo asked for.Brother Xiaoyong is one year older than her. After the nanny gave birth to Brother Xiaoyong, she hired the nanny of the He family in order to subsidize the family.During the time I lived with her in Mojiashan, the nanny spent a lot of time taking care of her, but her own brother Xiaoyong had to be left at home.Later, when Wei Ruo got older, he intentionally asked the nanny to go home a few more times, and asked the nanny to bring Xu Zhengyong to live with them for a few more days, saying that he lacked playmates and wanted to play with children of the same age.At that time, she and Brother Xiaoyong were both little milk babies, there was no difference between men and women, and they played together in Zhuangzi.After a long time, Wei Ruo and Xu Zhengyong became familiar with each other, and they called each other brother and sister.No matter how many times Xu Zhushan and Xu\u2019s mother corrected them, they just didn\u2019t change.\u201cMeimei, untie Brother Xiaoyong\u2019s rope, let\u2019s sit down and talk about it.\u201d Wei Ruo quickly winked at Xiumei.Before Xu\u2019s mother and Uncle Xu could react, Xiumei quickly untied Xu Zhengyong\u2019s rope.\u201cMeizi, thank you!\u201d Xu Zhengyong smiled innocently at Xiumei.\u201cDon\u2019t be in a hurry to thank!\u201d Xiumei gave Xu Zhengyong an angry look.Xu Zhengyong, who was freed, jumped up to Wei Ruo, and complained to Wei Ruo: \u201cSister Ruoer, tell me, shouldn\u2019t a good man have no fear of life and death, go out on the battlefield and make contributions?\u201d\u201cThe kind of man you mentioned is indeed a good man, but there is more than one way to be a good man. Didn\u2019t I ask you to study before?\u201d Wei Ruo asked.\u201cI can\u2019t, Sister Ruo\u2019er, I\u2019m not the material for reading. If I can know so many characters, I\u2019m pretty good. If you ask me to write those things in a polite way, I really can\u2019t write them.\u201d Xu Zhengyong haha bitterly said.Actually, Wei Ruo also knew that his detached personality was indeed not suitable for studying.But reading is indeed the best way for ordinary people to achieve class transition in this era.\u201cYou brat, you go to fight in the army, those Japanese pirates are so fierce, your mother has to worry about you all day long at home!\u201d Xu Zhushan reprimanded.\u201cNurse, did you disagree with Brother Xiaoyong because you were worried that Brother Xiaoyong would be injured?\u201d Wei Ruo asked the nurse.The nanny shook her head: \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of him being injured in the war. The people can live and work in peace and contentment mostly because of the soldiers guarding the city gate. If my son doesn\u2019t go, other people\u2019s sons will go. If everyone\u2019s sons don\u2019t go, then everyone All must die.\u201dSaid the nanny sighed: \u201cIf he really shed blood and sweat for the sake of fighting the enemy, I will admit it! I am afraid of his temper. If he enters the barracks and fails to fight, he will be punished for violating the rules first!\u201dXu Zhengyong has a stubborn temper, that day he went to the Xiaowei Mansion to find Wei Ruo, and quarreled with the guards of the Xiaowei Mansion when he disagreed.Mother Xu was really worried when he went to the military camp with such a personality.Is that so, then Wei Ruo thinks this question is not so unsolvable.Wei Ruo turned to Xu Zhengyong and said, \u201cBrother Xiaoyong, you heard it too. It\u2019s not that the nanny completely disagrees with your joining the army, but there is a prerequisite, that you can restrain your personality and not easily conflict with others.\u201d\u201cAs long as others don\u2019t provoke me, I won\u2019t easily conflict with others. My mother just thinks too much.\u201d Xu Zhengyong said disapprovingly.\u201cBrother Xiaoyong, although I am not a very disciplined person myself, the military is no match for other places. It is the place with the strictest rules and the place where you have to obey. You can\u2019t say that you can\u2019t, but you must, Absolutely and definitely obey the military orders and obey the management.\u201d Wei Ruo looked serious.Xu Zhengyong scratched his head, not sure.He also knows his temper, and it is indeed easy to conflict with others.\u201cBrother Xiaoyong, if you want to go, just swear on me. After you join the army, on the premise of ensuring your own safety, you must restrain your temper, don\u2019t conflict with others, and obey military orders and management. If not , I will be struck by lightning.\u201d\u201cThat won\u2019t work! How can I swear on you! I swear on myself, and I won\u2019t swear on you!\u201d Xu Zhengyong resolutely refused.Then Xu Zhengyong said: \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, I\u2019d rather not go, and just be a useless man in this life!\u201dAs he spoke, Xu Zhengyong\u2019s expression suddenly became uncomfortable: \u201cI want to be a soldier. I don\u2019t just want to defend my family and the country. I also want to make a difference. I want to pick you up and live with us. I know we are flat-headed now. Ordinary people, no matter how much money you earn from business, you can\u2019t compete with officials, and I can\u2019t let you go home. But if I make military achievements and become a bigger official than the Wei family, I will have a way to let you leave and continue with us. live together.\u201dXu Zhengyong wiped away his tears as he spoke, and looked at a corner of the wall unwillingly.\u201cYou are my sister, I should take care of you and protect you, instead of staying in this hut uselessly. You asked me to read, and I read, but I am useless, I can\u2019t read, but I have strength, You also asked Master to teach me kung fu, I think I will be fine on the battlefield!\u201dHearing this, both Xu Zhushan and Xu\u2019s mother fell silent.Wei Ruo\u2019s heart was also hit hard. She didn\u2019t expect that Brother Xiaoyong\u2019s arguing to be a soldier still had a relationship with her.(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

You have a mother who is worried about you, and you have a younger sister who is waiting for you.\u201d Take her home after you have established a career.\u201d Mother Xu urged.\u201cMother, don\u2019t worry, I remember it! I keep everything firmly in my heart!\u201d Xu Zhengyong firmly promised.Then Xu Zhengyong looked at his father.Xu Zhushan didn\u2019t have any opinion at all, as long as his wife had no opinion, then he had no opinion.And my son\u2019s idea is very good, and he also supports it.Wei Ruo silently turned her eyes away, not wanting the nanny and the others to see her red eye sockets.Really, she doesn\u2019t cry much, why are her eyes red?At this time, you should smile happily. What kind of trouble is red eyes!Damn it, I just can\u2019t bear it\u2026After returning from Sibaozhai, Wei Ruo dragged Xiumei into her small warehouse.\u201cMiss, what are you looking for?\u201d Xiumei wanted to help but didn\u2019t know where to start.\u201cI don\u2019t know what specific materials I need. I can only see what can be used. Brother Xiaoyong is going to serve in the army. I have to make him something useful for self-defense.\u201dAlthough she supports Brother Xiaoyong\u2019s ambition in terms of attitude, she still worries about his safety in her heart.So she wanted to prepare some useful things for Xiao Yong before he went to the army.\u201cThat\u2019s right! Then I\u2019ll help Miss find out if there\u2019s anything hard!\u201d Xiumei understood what Wei Ruo meant, and immediately joined in the search for materials.Searching and searching, Wei Ruo suddenly stopped.Xiumei: \u201cMiss, what\u2019s wrong with you?\u201dWei Ruo: \u201cI thought of that crossbow.\u201dXiumei: \u201cCrossbow?\u201dWei Ruo: \u201cBrother Xiaoyong joins the army now, and what he joins is to defend the city against Japanese pirates. If I can update some weapons in the army, will I also protect Brother Xiaoyong in disguise?\u201dXiumei: \u201cThat\u2019s for sure!\u201dWei Ruo: \u201cYou continue to help me find out if there is anything hard in the things I brought, I will go back to the room first.\u201dAfter returning to the room, Wei Ruo took out the paper and pen, and began to draw drawings tentatively.If you make a detachable quiver, which is the same as the bullet clip, and install it directly on the \u9a7d, and replace it with another quivers after shooting one quivers, theoretically, you can increase the firing frequency of the \u9a7d.Xiumei didn\u2019t find anything useful in the warehouse, and when she returned to the room, she saw the blueprint Wei Ruo was drawing.\u201cMiss, what is this? Is it a crossbow?\u201d\u201cYeah. It\u2019s a crossbow. I played with it when I went to the school last time, but it didn\u2019t work very well. At that time, I thought that if I could improve it, it would be more powerful. But I have no interest in managing the affairs of the Wei family, so I didn\u2019t take any action.\u201d .Now Brother Xiaoyong is going to be a soldier, so I thought of this thing. If there is no condition to make effective armor for the time being, then make some more powerful weapons. Offense is the best defense.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the best, as long as our side is strong enough, the enemy won\u2019t be able to hurt Brother Xiaoyong!\u201d Xiumei said happily.\u201cWell, I also plan to ask Brother Xiaoyong to take credit for the final drawing.\u201dJust entered the barracks, Brother Xiaoyong can only be a soldier at the bottom. If he has a small contribution, even if he can\u2019t get promoted, he can still leave an impression on the officer.\u201cMiss, although this method is good, but Brother Xiaoyong is not a person who can set up such delicate things at first glance. If someone asks a little bit, he will be confused.\u201d\u201cStupid Meimei, I didn\u2019t ask him to say that he designed it himself, but that it was drawn by an expert. He asked for it. It is said that he is an old man who wanders the rivers and lakes, the kind who lives in no fixed place, and he doesn\u2019t know where he will go after leaving the blueprint.\u201d\u201cMiss is still smart!\u201d\u201cMeimei, I need to find a good carpenter to help me practice. I can\u2019t do it just by painting. I need to practice while painting.\u201d\u201cThen Uncle Xu may be able to, I remember Uncle Xu was a carpenter before.\u201d Xiumei reminded.\u201cWell, then I\u2019ll go ask Uncle Xu after I finish this draft.\u201dWei Ruo was very concerned about this matter, and locked herself in the room until Yun\u2019s sent someone to urge her to eat at night, and she didn\u2019t come out of the room.After coming out, he handed over the drawings to Xiumei, and asked her to send them to Sibaozhai to Uncle Xu immediately.The situation is special now. Once Xiaoyong goes to register and apply, he may enter the military camp at any time, and she has no time to delay.When Xiumei came back, she brought back Xu Zhushan\u2019s response. Xu Zhushan hadn\u2019t tried to make similar things before so he couldn\u2019t be sure, but he would try overnight according to the blueprint given by Wei Ruo. Regardless of whether it could be done or not, he would pass it tomorrow morning. The carrier pigeon responded to Wei Ruo.The next morning, the carrier pigeon arrived as scheduled. Xu Zhushan had already made a prototype according to what Wei Ruo said, but there were a few details that Xu Zhushan put forward suggestions for improvement based on his own carpentry experience.Based on the suggestions for improvement, Wei Ruo began to draw the second edition of the draft paper.After going back and forth like this for three days, when I got Uncle Xu\u2019s reply on the fourth day, I finally got a perfect answer.The kind of crossbow Wei Ruo wanted was made.Wei Ruo was very satisfied with this, but Wei Ruo didn\u2019t stop there. She had to hurry up and prepare medicine for Xu Zhengyong who was about to enter the barracks.Wei Ruo\u2019s busyness can be felt by everyone around her, and the people in Yingzhuyuan are no exception.It just so happened that today Wei Ruo came to Yingzhu Garden to eat and drink again, Wei Jin also said, \u201cYou seem to be very busy recently.\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019m busy making medicine.\u201d Wei Ruo answered half and hid the other half.No way, she still doesn\u2019t want too many people to know about the nanny\u2019s affairs, even Wei Jinyi still wants to keep it a secret for now.\u201cBy the way, my second brother, can you help me get the medicine of Angelica dahurica in a short time?\u201d Wei Ruo asked.Angelica dahurica is one of the medicinal materials used to make gold sore medicine. Because of the war in Xingshan County, Baizhi is also in short supply, and the pharmacies in the city are short of this medicine.Wei Jinyi: \u201cUrgent?\u201dWei Ruo: \u201cI\u2019m making some backup medicine for a friend. He\u2019s leaving soon, so I\u2019m really in a hurry.\u201dWei Jinyi: \u201cFriend?\u201dFor some reason, Wei Jin also felt that Wei Ruo\u2019s friend was a man.(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Didn\u2019t I give you Qi-tonifying pills for a while? Let\u2019s see how it works, and then how to improve the formula later. Am I not making medicine? It just happened to be formulated for you. .\u201d Wei Ruo replied.After listening to the explanation, Wei Jin also realized that he had overreacted.Then put his hand in front of Wei Ruo again.Wei Ruo put his fingers on Wei Jinyi\u2019s wrist, and said after a while: \u201cWell, it\u2019s getting better. I\u2019ll give you another twenty pills this time, and you can continue to adjust.\u201d\u201cUm.\u201d###The capital, Zhongyi Bofu.After several days, the news from Xingshan County finally reached the capital. After receiving the letter, the old man praised him several times, \u201cYes\u201d.The old man is sixty-eight years old, thin, with gray hair and a gray beard.Standing in front of him are his eldest son Wei Minghong and second son Wei Mingyong.Wei Minghong has a rounded appearance, a bit fatter figure, and his facial features are 70% similar to that of the old man.Wei Mingyong should be thinner and look shrewd.\u201cYou also read the letter written by your third brother.\u201d The old man told the letter and handed it to the two sons.The eldest son Wei Minghong took the letter, and Wei Mingyong came up to read it with him.After reading it, both of their faces showed happy expressions.\u201cFather, so the third brother and the others have contributed to improving the land, and won the appreciation of His Royal Highness the Seventh?\u201d Wei Minghong asked hastily.\u201cWhether you can get His Highness the Seventh Highness\u2019s appreciation is still uncertain, but at least it\u2019s a good thing in front of the Seventh Highness. No matter how you look at it, it\u2019s a good thing.\u201d The old man commented.\u201cThat\u2019s really great!\u201d Wei Minghong looked excited, \u201cI heard that His Highness the Seventh Highness is the most promising candidate for the crown prince. If His Highness can be appreciated by the Seventh Highness, then there is hope for our family to keep this title!\u201dWei Mingyong has a question right now: \u201cFather, the third brother wrote in a letter that this matter was done by the niece Wei Qingruo whom we haven\u2019t met yet, but she has been in the countryside for the past few years, and she must be in a bad mood when she comes back.\u201d Look, how can you be so capable?\u201d\u201cHuh! Why can\u2019t there be? That\u2019s my granddaughter! The serious heir of our family! Besides, people in the countryside are of course the ability to farm! It\u2019s just the two of you who have shallow eyelids every day. Now I see it. , Those who grew up in the country also have the ability to grow up in the country!\u201dWhen deciding on the order of the two granddaughters, he asked the two sons for their opinions, and the two sons had no opinion, but they both felt that the one just picked up might not be on the stage, and it would be difficult to be elegant. Being the eldest daughter might lose face to their family.It\u2019s better to let that fake one continue in front, at least it won\u2019t be embarrassing.It was still he who made the final decision to let his own be the eldest daughter. It would be fine if there was a granddaughter above, but the old man felt a little bit uncomfortable when the eldest daughter was asked to be made by someone else.\u201cYes, yes, father, you are wise.\u201d Wei Minghong hurriedly flattered.\u201cFather said so.\u201d Wei Mingyong also expressed his opinion immediately.The old uncle said with emotion on his face: \u201cFacts have proved that the heirs of my Wei family are much more competitive than those from the merchant\u2019s family. After all, merchants will not be able to stand on the stage!\u201d\u201cFather, you are so right. The merchant\u2019s family is humble after all, full of pettiness, and can\u2019t be compared with those from our Earl\u2019s Mansion.\u201d Wei Minghong said hurriedly.\u201cFather, my son has nothing to do recently. Why don\u2019t you let me go to Xingshan County to help the third brother? The third brother is busy with fighting the Japanese, so he may not have time to manage those fields. After all, the eldest niece is just an old lady. There are a lot of inconveniences for women.\u201d Wei Mingyong took the initiative to ask Ying to say.\u201cSecond brother, we really want to go together, and I have the same intention.\u201d Wei Minghong said.\u201cBrother, you have official duties and it is inconvenient to leave Beijing. Unlike me, you are white and can leave at any time. Let my brother go.\u201d Wei Mingyong said.\u201cStop arguing! Both of you are not allowed to go!\u201d The old man stopped the two of them and rejected their request.\u201cFather\u2026\u201d Wei Minghong and Wei Mingyong looked at the old man with a guilty conscience.\u201cDon\u2019t think that I don\u2019t know what you guys are up to! You want to help because you are pretending to have a relationship with His Highness the Seventh Prince! You two idiots! If it is so easy to get in touch with His Highness the Seventh Prince, it will be your turn.\u201d Two? Stay well at home for me, and no one is allowed to interfere with the affairs of the third family!\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201d Wei Minghong and Wei Mingyong could only obediently agree.The old man looked at the two unsatisfactory sons: \u201cYou two also give me some encouragement. Now that the third family has made some achievements, you can\u2019t hold back.\u201dWei Minghong and Wei Mingyong lowered their heads, guilty of not daring to answer.Coming out of the old uncle\u2019s house, the two brothers walked on the road, each with their own thoughts.\u201cBrother, although you are the eldest brother, in the future we may have to live on the breath of the third brother. The third brother has a son who is good at studying, and now he has an eldest daughter who can make achievements for the family. In the future, it will definitely flourish. Yes.\u201d Wei Mingyong said with a smile, with a strong sense of ridicule and watching a good show.\u201cSecond brother, don\u2019t worry about me, and worry about yourself. I heard that because of the concubine, the second sister-in-law has already had a big fight with you!\u201d\u201cBrother, I heard that your house is not peaceful. Your eldest son seems to be causing troubles a lot recently.\u201d\u201cHmph, what\u2019s the use of my second brother being weird here, you have the ability to compare yourself with the third brother\u2019s family!\u201dWei Minghong was a little annoyed, he flung his sleeves and walked away without looking back.\u201cYou\u2019re stepping on a sore spot!\u201d Wei Mingyong sneered, then walked to his yard with his hands behind his back.###In a blink of an eye, it is the fifteenth day of the sixth lunar month.This day is also the day when Xu Zhengyong officially joined the job.Wei Ruo used another excuse to go to the south of the city to check the progress, and went to Sibaozhai with Xiumei to have dinner with the nanny\u2019s family.The nanny was busy with a large table of dishes, almost all of which were Wei Ruo\u2019s favorite food.At the dinner table, several people were talking and laughing.In the Wei family, there is a rule of not talking when eating or sleeping, and talking is not allowed during meals, but there are not so many rules in the Xu family.After eating, Xiumei pulled Xu Zhengyong aside and handed Xu Zhengyong a small purse.\u201cWhat is this?\u201d Xu Zhengyong asked.(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 65": "Chapter 65 - The battle between brothers and sistersPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 65 The dispute between brothers and sisters\u201cAmulet.\u201d Xiumei replied.\u201cYou asked me specifically?\u201d Xu Zhengyong asked with a smile.\u201cThat\u2019s right, this is a bit of concern for the younger brother as a senior sister.\u201d Xiumei replied with a proud face.The person who taught Xiumei boxing kung fu and the one who taught Xu Zhengyong boxing kung fu are the same person, so they are indeed from the same school.\u201cI am senior brother, you are junior sister!\u201d Xu Zhengyong retorted.The two have been arguing for several years about who is big and who is small. Anyway, it is the one who refuses to accept the other and everyone wants to be the big one.Xiumei: \u201cIt was my teacher who worshiped first, and your teacher who worshiped later. Of course, I am a senior sister and a junior!\u201dXu Zhengyong: \u201cI learned from Master first, and you came later. Of course, I am the elder brother and you are the younger sister!\u201dXiumei: \u201cWhat\u2019s the use of learning first, the apprenticeship is mainly based on the ceremony! It doesn\u2019t count if you follow!\u201dXu Zhengyong: \u201cI am older than you, you are the same age as sister Ruoer, and sister Ruoer calls me Brother Xiaoyong, of course I am your senior brother!\u201dWei Ruo and the Xu family are no strangers to the quarrel between the two of them about whether they are brothers or sisters.In the past, they had to fight almost once a month. Recently, there were fewer opportunities to meet each other, which made the two of them stop for a while.Everyone laughed happily.After arguing for a while, Xiumei took the initiative to admit defeat: \u201cHow about this, you go to the army, if you can come back alive, I will admit that you entered the school before me, and I will call you brother.\u201dHearing this, Xu Zhengyong, who should have jumped up and down three times with joy, fell silent, put away his hippie smile, and looked very serious.\u201cAre you afraid that I won\u2019t come back?\u201d\u201cIf you can\u2019t come back, you will be my junior for the rest of your life!\u201d Xiumei snorted, then turned her head away and ran back to Wei Ruo\u2019s side.Xu Zhengyong also came back, with a smile on his face, he had already put the purse that Xiumei gave him into his clothes.\u201cI gave Meimei\u2019s things, and mine.\u201d Wei Ruo also prepared a practice ceremony for Xu Zhengyong.Wei Ruo put a small wooden box on the table, and when he opened it, there were a bunch of small porcelain bottles inside.\u201cThey are all regular medicines, and each one has a sticker on it. You can take the medicine in the corresponding bottle when you need it.\u201d Wei Ruo said.Xu Zhengyong glanced at the bottle and said, \u201cSister Ruoer, why is your word still so ugly?\u201d\u201cYou still have the nerve to talk about me!\u201d Wei Ruo said angrily.Xu Zhengyong touched his nose, \u201cI didn\u2019t say you, I didn\u2019t say you, I dare not say you, my sister Ruoer\u2019s words are ugly and ugly, and they are so ugly and cute!\u201d\u201cIf you say again, I won\u2019t give it to you!\u201d Wei Ruo closed the box, as if he was going to take it away.Xu Zhengyong hurried forward and grabbed the box.\u201cI want it, I want it, how can I not want the gift that sister Ruoer prepared for me? Even if I don\u2019t need it for the rest of my life, I will take it with me, hehe\u2026\u201dXiumei gave Xu Zhengyong a white look: \u201cLook at you, you are so worthless.\u201dXu Zhengyong made a face at Xiumei.Then Wei Ruo went to the kitchen to make goat milk tea for everyone.Wei Ruo seldom goes to the kitchen himself, usually Xiumei comes, and Wei Ruo is only interested in getting together with the nanny\u2019s family.Taking this opportunity, the nanny gave Wei Ruo the income and account books of Sibaozhai in the past two months.Originally, it was paid every three months or half a year, but now that Wei Ruo is in the captain\u2019s mansion, the nanny feels that Wei Ruo is in a difficult situation in the Wei family, and it would be better to have more money. And a lot of Wei Ruocun\u2019s money was used for the recent purchase of Xiaoyang Mountain.\u201cMiss, the total of three hundred taels of silver here is the income of Sibaozhai in Huzhou Prefecture in the past three months, the income from the opening of Sibaozhai here for two months, and the income from selling sweet potato vine leaves and last year\u2019s stock of dried sweet potatoes. Sum.\u201d The nanny gave the silver to Wei Ruo.The income of two shops is faster than that of one shop.The income of Sibaozhai in Xingshan County is slightly lower than that of Huzhou Prefecture, which shows that Xingshan County is indeed poorer.The income from selling sweet potato leaves and stocked dried sweet potatoes is much less than the former two.But Wei Ruo is not too small, and some profits should not be too thin, not to mention that this is also for the subsequent ripening of a large number of sweet potatoes.###After that day, Xu Zhengyong went to the army to report.After that, she temporarily lost contact with the Xu family and Wei Ruo.In addition to going to Xie\u2019s house for classes these days, Wei Ruo is planning the next money-making plan.The work in the south of the city went very smoothly. Under the management of the nanny, Xiaoyang Mountain was also developing according to Wei Ruo\u2019s expectations, without any problems.Wei Ruo and Xie Ying\u2019s medicine field went smoothly with the help of Mrs. Xie.They successfully purchased land with poor terrain in the south of the city from the government.In order to reflect fairness, Qianzhi County distributed land with good land type to poor families without land for free.As for those with poor terrain, everyone is allowed to buy them with money. Generally, the price is not high, far lower than the price of the land that can be planted in the north of the city.For example, Xie Ying and Wei Ruo jointly purchased this piece of land, which cost a total of five taels of silver, but has a full ten acres of land.So the silver required for pure land is not expensive, but the subsequent labor costs and improvement costs are expensive, but in this regard, they have the solid backing of Mrs. Xie, so they really don\u2019t need to worry about it.Wei Ruo also found out that Mrs. Xie\u2019s natal family was a wealthy businessman after she partnered with Xie Ying. Mrs. Xie\u2019s dowry was a full one hundred and twenty-eight sets, and there were quite a few estate shops, all of which were located in affluent places. The income is very considerable.Although Mrs. Xie was born in a family of merchants, she was highly valued by her husband\u2019s family.When Mrs. Xie first married, the Xie family hadn\u2019t made a fortune yet, and the family\u2019s financial situation was not good. Fortunately, Mrs. Xie used her dowry to maintain the family\u2019s expenses, which allowed the Xie family to survive the most difficult time.So now that the Xie family is flourishing, no one in the whole family has any opinion on Mrs. Xie\u2019s background, and Mrs. Xie\u2019s husband has never had any thoughts of taking concubines.Naturally, Wei Ruo could not live up to the trust of Xie\u2019s mother and daughter, and arranged the entire planting process in an orderly manner, from sowing to later maintenance, and pest and disease prevention.Xie Ying is also working very hard. Now every day when she sees Wei Ruo, she has to discuss with her about the medicine field.This enthusiasm is so high that Wei Ruo misses Xie Ying who was always indifferent to him in the past.In the past, you loved and ignored me, but now you want to be inseparable from me.The medicine field is in full swing, which naturally arouses the curiosity of many people, and some people want to imitate Xie\u2019s family.Anyway, the land in the south of the city is cheap, and now that the county government has promoted land improvement techniques, they can also learn from the Xie family to plant together. Who would think that their own land has more grain?Yun\u2019s mind was also moved. After all, his family Ruo\u2019er came up with this improved ability, and it didn\u2019t make sense to let others take advantage of it.(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 66": "Chapter 66 - focus on academicsPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 66 Focus on academicsIn the case of a general shortage of grain, if more industries can be purchased, this pressure should be relieved.So taking advantage of the time to chat after dinner, Yun mentioned this idea to Wei Ruo.\u201cRuo\u2019er, I heard that Xie\u2019s family bought some land outside the city, why not buy some from our family as well.\u201dWei Ruo took a sip of tea calmly, and replied: \u201cYes, if mother wants to buy it, all she needs to do is register with the county government.\u201d\u201cWhat I mean is, I hope you can be responsible for improving production. You are the best at improving wasteland, and those people in the government also learned technology from you.\u201d Yun explained.\u201cMy mother suggested that I shouldn\u2019t refuse, but my husband has assigned me a lot of homework recently, and I have to discuss the next work with the county government and Nanny Qin in the only free time left. There is really no extra time.\u201d Wei Wei Ruo replied.In the past, it was Yun who urged Wei Ruo to go to school and not bother about the field; now the situation is just the opposite, she wants Wei Ruo to go to the field, but Wei Ruo is busy with class.Immediately afterwards, Wei Ruo sighed again: \u201cStudying is really exhausting. Mr. Wang\u2019s content is too much and deep; and I am a half-way monk, so it is very difficult to keep up with the rhythm. Most of the time I spend most of my time every day. It\u2019s all used on this, if it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t have the energy, if my mother speaks today, I will help my mother to solve her problems.\u201dWei Ruo\u2019s remarks were sincere and reasonable, and no one could fault them.Yun didn\u2019t know how to refute Wei Ruo\u2019s words.The Yun family was still thinking, Wei Yichen said first: \u201cMother, Ruo\u2019er should focus on her studies. If you want to buy wasteland in the south of the city for improved farming, you can just hire someone to do it. Now there are people from the government to help Then, it\u2019s the same if you ask them any questions.\u201dHaving reached this point, Yun could only nod: \u201cYi Chen is right, Ruo\u2019er really should put her studies first.\u201dImmediately afterwards, Yun changed the subject, turned to Wei Yichen and said, \u201cYichen, how is your apprenticeship going?\u201dThe Wei family has been troubled by this matter for more than half a year.A few years ago, Wei Yichen had been studying in the academy in the county, but last year, the master of the academy told Wei Yichen that he had nothing to teach him, and told him that if he wanted to improve his skills before the imperial examination, he still needed to go to Go to a better academy or worship a more prestigious master.Xingshan County is located in a remote place, not to mention that there are no nearby ones, nor any farther away.And those prestigious academies are not something that ordinary people can enter if they want to. The Wei family only has the title handed down from their ancestors, and the rest requires connections and financial resources. The college is very difficult.In contrast, it is relatively easy to seek a good teacher. If you meet someone with insight and appreciate Wei Yichen\u2019s talent, things will be done more easily.Having a famous teacher will also be extremely helpful for Wei Yichen to take the exam in Beijing in the future.Wei Yichen frowned: \u201cSorry mother, there is not much progress yet.\u201d\u201cYichen, if you really can\u2019t get the teacher you want, then you should settle for the next best thing.\u201d Yun had to persuade, \u201cTime waits for no one. If you delay it, I\u2019m afraid it will delay your study.\u201d\u201cMother, this is no child\u2019s play. Once the teacher worships, he will be a teacher for a day and a father for life. You can\u2019t go back on your word. My son thinks he should be more cautious.\u201d Wei Yichen replied.\u201cForget it, you have an idea, and mother is just a little worried. In the end, you make the decision yourself.\u201d Yun said.Wei Ruo, who was tasting tea, listened to the conversation between the two, and suddenly remembered that the second brother had been staying in his own small courtyard all these years, and had neither been to school nor visited a teacher.Second brother said before that now he also wants to test for fame, so should he also think of a way for second brother?The whole family helps to worry about the eldest brother\u2019s affairs, Wei Ruo doesn\u2019t need to take care of it, but she can only help to find a solution for the second brother\u2019s affairs.After leaving Cangyunyuan, Wei Ruo who returned to Tingsongyuan asked Xiumei: \u201cMeimei, do you know which is the best academy in Taizhou Prefecture?\u201d\u201cMiss, what do you ask the academy for? Academies are places where men go to study. I haven\u2019t heard of an academy where women can study.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t go by myself, I asked for my second brother.\u201d\u201cThen miss, wait for me, I\u2019ll find someone to ask!\u201dHow did Xiumei know this? She usually doesn\u2019t care about it, but if the young lady asks, she must find out for her.The Captain\u2019s mansion appointed someone who knew about this, because there was an elder and young master who was studying in the mansion, so there was a bit of ink in the mansion.Xiumei soon asked Wei Ruo the result. There are three most famous academies in Taizhou Prefecture, namely Fangyan Academy, Tongjiang Academy and Anzhou AcademyBut these three academies have two problems, one is the distance, and the other is the high threshold.Xingshan County is a small and remote county town, far away from the bustling area of Taizhou Prefecture. What\u2019s more difficult is that the three academies all have high requirements for students, and it is very difficult for ordinary students to enroll.\u201cMiss, these three academies are all very good. It\u2019s not that we help Second Young Master choose which academies to enter, but which academies are willing to let people from our family go.\u201d Xiumei said.\u201cIf the academy fails, then there should be a way to learn from a teacher\u2026\u201dWei Ruo thought about it carefully, and came up with an idea.###June passed by in a hurry, and in a blink of an eye, it was already the seventh month of the lunar calendar.In the past few days, Xingshan County has been relatively peaceful. During this period, the army reinforced by the imperial court passed through the city and went to the east of the city, making people wonder whether the fighting on the east coast has become fierce.The land improvement in the south of the city is also proceeding in an orderly manner, because after the harvest is harvested, it is owned by themselves. Those people work very hard, and many of them sleep directly next to the reclaimed land.The Qiqiao Festival on the seventh day of the seventh month of the lunar calendar. This is one of the few days in a year when girls can go out together without being accompanied by their elders.Wei Ruo and Xie Ying made an appointment to celebrate the Qiqiao Festival together.Before going out, Xiumei made a lot of Qiaoguo for Wei Ruo, packed them in exquisite food boxes, and gave them to Wei Ruo and Xie Ying later.Just as she was about to leave the hospital, Wei Qingwan suddenly appeared.\u201cSister, I heard that you are going to the Qiqiao Festival with Miss Xie, and I want to go with you too, is that okay?\u201d Wei Qingwan asked cautiously.Wei Qingwan also wanted to be with Wei Ruo, so when Wei Ruo was about to go out, she came to find Wei Ruo.\u201cNo.\u201d Wei Ruo resolutely refused.\u201cWhy? Is my sister still angry with me? There were some things I didn\u2019t do well before, so I apologize to my sister and beg her to give me a chance to correct it, okay?\u201d Wei Qingwan bit her lip.(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Instead of begging others to take you out while asking the other party to give you a chance to correct, you will take advantage of it?\u201dWith no one else around, Wei Ruo didn\u2019t need to care about his own image, and just rolled his eyes in a rude manner.\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, but, put away your thoughts. If you need someone to accompany you, go to your own good sister. Didn\u2019t the Miss Qian family ask you out? If not, go there by yourself, don\u2019t look for me, I don\u2019t have time.\u201dAfter finishing speaking, Wei Ruo bypassed Wei Qingwan, not wanting to waste a moment, and quickly walked towards the door, leaving her with a decisive and unrestrained back.Wei Ruo arrived at the place that he had agreed with Xie Ying, which was the Sibaozhai that Wei Ruo often went to.This location was decided by Xie Ying. Generally, women go to the Rouge Jewelry Store for appointments. Xie Ying has a different idea.\u201cAre you going to buy something here?\u201d Wei Ruo asked.\u201cWell, buy some paper, my brother is coming back soon, there are many good things in the capital, and I don\u2019t need to buy him other things, but this paper is not even in the capital, I will buy some for him, let him see See the world!\u201dXie Ying walked into Sibaozhai with big strides as she spoke.\u201cShopkeeper, I want to buy a hundred.\u201d Xie Ying took out a silver coin and placed it domineeringly on the counter.Shopkeeper Jia explained with great embarrassment: \u201cI\u2019m sorry, miss, you see there is a notice posted at our door, each person can only sell 50 sheets a day, if you want to buy more, you can only buy our suits, the suits contain Paper is also available, but unlimited.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of broken rule is this? I can\u2019t just buy your paper if I have money?\u201d Xie Ying asked.\u201cMiss, calm down, it\u2019s like this. The daily output of paper in our family is very limited. If there is no limit on the purchase amount, I am afraid that some of them will be bought all at once, and others will not be able to buy them.\u201d Shopkeeper Jia patiently explained.Xie Ying could barely accept this explanation, but she was still a little unhappy.\u201cI want to give my brother a gift, how can I only give such a small gift? How petty?\u201d\u201cShopkeeper, I\u2019ll buy fifty too.\u201d Wei Ruo stepped forward and said to the boss.The shopkeeper immediately rolled up fifty sheets of paper for Wei Ruo.After receiving the paper, Wei Ruo handed it directly to Xie Ying.\u201cFor me?\u201d Xie Ying asked.\u201cUm.\u201d\u201cThen I won\u2019t be polite to you, and I\u2019ll give you the money later.\u201d Xie Ying didn\u2019t hesitate and accepted it directly.\u201cDon\u2019t be polite to me, this is my gift for you for the Qiqiao Festival.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Xie Ying didn\u2019t say much.Then Xie Ying looked at other things in the store, and she planned to buy some more pens, ink, paper and inkstones to give to her brother.Xie Ying saw wooden boxes of the same size and shape placed on the shelves on one side of the store, and each box was **** with ribbons to fit perfectly.Xie Ying asked: \u201cShopkeeper, what are those wooden boxes in your house?\u201d\u201cIt contains the products in our store. It may be paper, it may be inkstone, or it may be a combination of several things. Some are of better quality and some are of average quality.\u201d The shopkeeper explained.\u201cEveryone is different?\u201d Xie Ying was puzzled.\u201cYes, each one is different, but the selling price is the same, five taels of silver for a wooden box.\u201d The shopkeeper replied.\u201cThen can I open it and take a look?\u201d Xie Ying asked again.\u201dNo, you can only know what\u2019s inside after you buy it.\u201d\u201cSelling the same price for different products, isn\u2019t it true that some people lose and others gain?\u201d Xie Ying asked.\u201cIt\u2019s like this. Whether you win or lose depends on luck. In one of the wooden boxes, there is also a pair of calligraphy by Tibetan monks. Those who buy that pair of calligraphy also only need to pay five taels of silver.\u201d The shopkeeper continued to explain.\u201cIt\u2019s Tibetan Layman again? I heard that you gave away a pair of Tibetan Layman\u2019s calligraphy on the first day you opened. Why do you have so many Tibetan Layman\u2019s calligraphy? I heard from my mother that Tibetan Layman is not very good. I like to give away my calligraphy and paintings to others.\u201d\u201cGirl, please don\u2019t worry, the Tibetan Layman\u2019s calligraphy in my store is absolutely authentic. My boss Heyou and the Tibetan Layman are old friends, so they have obtained many Tibetan Layman\u2019s calligraphy.\u201dShopkeeper Jia only learned in the last few days that his boss is a man named Heyou, not the simple and honest farmer who lives in the back yard.So he felt that it was more reasonable, otherwise he would really doubt his ability to see people.\u201cWhat if I want to buy directly the calligraphy of Tibetan Layman? How much do you want?\u201d Xie Ying asked.Her brother likes calligraphy and painting, and he should be happy if she gave him the calligraphy and calligraphy of Layman in the Tibetan forest.\u201cThis calligraphy cannot be purchased directly, it can only be bought by luck.\u201d Shopkeeper Jia explained, \u201cIn addition, we will register the customers who buy the \u2018blind box\u2019 launched by our shop this time, and then our boss He You will randomly select a lucky one The guest wrote a letter of recommendation for him to the Tibetan Layman.\u201dThis letter of recommendation doesn\u2019t attract Xie Ying very much, because her brother is studying in an academy in the capital, so she doesn\u2019t need to seek others as teachers.But Xie Ying knew that there must be many students in Xingshan County who wanted to get this letter of recommendation, if it was true that the relationship between his boss and Lay Lay Tibetans was as good as the shopkeeper said.\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, I\u2019ll want all the boxes on that shelf!\u201d Miss Xie Ying was very generous, asking for all the boxes as soon as she opened her mouth.Shopkeeper Jia apologized with a smile, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, girl, but each person can buy at most two of these blind boxes.\u201d\u201cWhy? I will pay if I want to buy it, why don\u2019t you let me buy it?\u201d Xie Ying asked.\u201cIt\u2019s like this, if someone buys all the boxes, then he will definitely be able to get the Tibetan Layman\u2019s calligraphy, and he will definitely be able to get the letter of recommendation promised by Mr. He You. In this way, the fairness of the game will be lost. Sex has become that whoever comes first and whoever has the money will definitely get the reward.\u201dThe same explanation has been given to several people by shopkeeper Jia in the past few days.Xie Ying thought it made sense after hearing it, and nodded: \u201cYou make sense, if it\u2019s true, it\u2019s really not fun.\u201d\u201cYes, yes, thank you girl for understanding.\u201d\u201cWell then, I\u2019ll buy two.\u201d Xie Ying said.\u201cOkay, these girls on the shelf can be chosen at will.\u201d Shopkeeper Jia said.Xie Ying went to the shelf and picked up this weigher, and then the other one.She didn\u2019t really like the calligraphy of Tibetan Layman, but because of the \u201cblind box\u201d gameplay, she has a competitive spirit.If she only bought two and could buy the box containing the Tibetan Layman\u2019s Calligraphy, she would definitely be able to brag to her brother later!After looking around, Xie Ying asked: \u201cIs that all? Is there anything else?

If you don\u2019t have enough money, I\u2019ll give it to you. Don\u2019t be embarrassed, we don\u2019t pay you back. Do you want to cooperate in planting medicine fields? When the time comes, it will be deducted from your income.\u201dWei Ruo felt Xie Ying\u2019s kindness, so she whispered to her specially, probably because she was afraid that she would be embarrassed.\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay. I don\u2019t have enough money. I have enough money. I just don\u2019t want to buy two.\u201d Wei Ruo explained.Xie Ying: \u201cReally?\u201dWei Ruo: \u201cReally!\u201dXie Ying: \u201cAlright then.\u201dWei Ruo and Xie Ying paid the money, and the shopkeeper took out the registration book and registered their names.Wei Ruo wrote the name of her second brother Wei Jinyi, while Xie Ying wrote the name of her brother Xie Jue.After shopping, Wei Ruo and Xie Ying went all the way to the west of the city. There was a courtyard of the Xie family.In Xingshan County, which is not a big place, Xie\u2019s other courtyard is definitely one of the best.The two first took a carriage for a while, and when they were about to arrive, Xie Ying suggested getting off the carriage and walking to the other courtyard, because the scenery along the way was very good and suitable for walking.Wei Ruo agreed, and just happened to see some motherwort on the side of the road, and she planned to pick it.Xie Ying watched Wei Ruo picking as he walked, and asked, \u201cWhat are you doing picking this grass?\u201d\u201cThis is motherwort, which is very good for women. There are so many that haven\u2019t been picked here, so I guess I don\u2019t know them.\u201d Wei Ruo explained.Many ordinary people have limited knowledge of herbal medicine, and most of them would treat it as ordinary grass even if they saw it.\u201cMotherwort? Is it good for women? What are the benefits?\u201d Xie Ying asked.\u201cThat\u2019s right\u2026\u201d Wei Ruo was a little embarrassed, there were two guards behind them five or six steps away.So he leaned into Xie Ying\u2019s ear and whispered to her: \u201cIt is used for women with irregular menstruation and painful menstruation.\u201dHearing this, Xie Ying blushed suddenly.\u201cYou\u2026how do you know all about this\u2026\u201d\u201cI want to grow herbs, so naturally I need to know the useful characteristics of each herb.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. But how much do you know about that?\u201d Xie Ying asked curiously.Xie Ying is the same age as Wei Ruo, both are thirteen years old, not far from Jiji, her mother has already mentioned some things to her, but the words are very vague, and she can\u2019t hear it.\u201cProbably\u2026 I know all of them.\u201d I have lived twice, plus I am studying medicine, so it\u2019s hard not to know.\u201cIsn\u2019t that scary?\u201d\u201cNo, you don\u2019t have to worry, as long as you take good care of your body, there will be no problems. Tell me when the time comes, and I will teach you how to make a convenient and easy-to-use menstrual belt.\u201d Wei Ruo said.\u201cYou\u2026 how can you say this thing?\u201dWhen it comes to the menstrual belt, even Xie Ying, who has always been carefree, can\u2019t help but feel embarrassed.\u201cWe are all girls. It\u2019s okay to talk about this kind of thing to each other, and it\u2019s a normal phenomenon. It will happen sooner or later. It\u2019s better to know it clearly than to ruin your body because you don\u2019t know much. People are afraid of it. Things are often because we don\u2019t know enough about such things, what we have to do is to understand them rationally and objectively, rather than blindly avoiding taboos.\u201d Wei Ruo explained.Xie Ying was surprised by what Wei Ruo said.\u201cStrange, you are obviously the same age as me, why sometimes you talk in the same way?\u201d Xie Ying looked curious, but also mixed with some admiration.She really rarely worships her peers, and Wei Ruo is the first.\u201cThere is a house of gold in the book, and the more you read, the more you will know.\u201d Wei Ruo attributed the reason to reading.\u201cWhat kind of books are you reading? All the books in my family are boring except for the book of war. The book of war is also boring to read. Only when my grandfather told me it was very interesting. Now Mr. Wang is also good. Tell my grandfather Compared with some.\u201dAs she spoke, Xie Ying also helped Wei Ruo pick motherwort.The two chatted while picking, talking and laughing, and picked a large bundle of motherwort.At this time Xiumei came up and whispered to Wei Ruo: \u201cMiss, there is a sneaky figure in the woods over there. He has been following us for a long time, and he doesn\u2019t seem like a good person.\u201dWei Ruo and the others went to the other courtyard by a creek on one side and a mountain on the other side. There were many shrubs and weeds on both sides of the road. Wei Ruo and the others were looking for motherwort among the weeds.The suspicious person that Xiumei mentioned is in the forest very close to the road.Xie Ying also looked over, but the bushes blocked her, and she could only vaguely see a figure moving, but she couldn\u2019t see the other person\u2019s appearance clearly.\u201cThis man leaves a good road and walks in the woods. There must be something wrong! And there is only one house in the other courtyard of my house ahead of this road. People who have nothing to do will not come here!\u201d Xie Ying said firmly.Xie Ying has said that, so this person is really suspicious.\u201cMeimei, are you sure?\u201d Wei Ruo asked.\u201cYes! Miss, don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll knock him down as soon as he gets close!\u201d Xiumei was confident.\u201cOkay, then let\u2019s keep our faces down.\u201d Wei Ruo said.So Wei Ruo and Xie Ying pretended not to know, and continued to bow their heads to pick motherwort, while Xiumei found a favorable position to ambush.Sure enough, the furtive figure came down from the mountain and was about to walk through the wild grass.Xiumei seized the opportunity and rushed forward, grabbing the man with a grabbing hand.The man resisted immediately and punched Xiumei with his backhand.The man was face down, and his face had a close contact with the weeds on the ground.Just about to raise her head, Xiumei knelt on the man\u2019s back, grabbed the man\u2019s hands behind her back with both hands, and completely subdued him.\u201cMeimei, beat him!\u201d Wei Ruo ordered.Xiumei\u2019s fist landed on the man\u2019s back.The man struggled and looked up and called for help: \u201cDon\u2019t, don\u2019t\u2026it\u2019s me\u2026it\u2019s me\u2026\u201d\u201cWait\u2026\u201d Xie Ying rushed out and stopped Xiumei, \u201cRuoruo, this person seems to be my brother!\u201d\u201cYou\u2026 your brother?\u201d Wei Ruo blinked.Xie Jue, who was pushed down by Xiumei, raised his head higher with difficulty so that the people in front of him could see his appearance clearly: \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026it\u2019s me\u2026my sister is me\u2026\u201d(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

When I heard that you didn\u2019t bring many people with you, I was worried, so I wanted to come and have a look.\u201d\u201cCome and see why I don\u2019t go on a good mountain road, but come from the mountain?\u201d\u201cI knew you guys were going to come to the other courtyard, so I came here ahead of time. It was too early and you haven\u2019t come yet. I just happened to see a beautiful yellow plant blooming on the mountain over there, so I wanted to pick it for you. After picking it Going back, who would have thought of\u2026\u201dUnexpectedly, there was a super skilled maid beside my sister, who gave him a critical blow.Wei Ruo saw a few yellow lily-shaped flowers falling on the ground in front of Xie Jue. They should be the ones that Xie Jue picked just now to give to his sister. It looks like daylilies.If there are too many, you can pick them off and dry them in the sun. It is very good for frying or cooking soup!Xie Jue\u2019s eyes fell on Wei Ruo. Although the person who did it was her maid, she was the one who ordered it!Feeling Xie Jue\u2019s gaze, Wei Ruo explained: \u201cMr. Xie, I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t know you were Xie Ying\u2019s brother. I thought it was Deng Tuzi who wanted to harm Ying\u2019er and me.\u201d\u201cYou are probably the very special Miss Wei family that my sister often mentions in letters?\u201d Although today is the first time we meet, but thanks to his own sister, Xie Jue has already admired Wei Ruo\u2019s name for a long time.Because of his sister\u2019s description, Xie Jue was still a little curious about this young lady from the Wei family who rarely caught his sister\u2019s eyes.When we met today, I didn\u2019t notice anything special, but this beating was very special.\u201cBrother, today\u2019s matter is entirely your fault, but you can\u2019t blame anyone else.\u201d Xie Ying thought that her brother was going to blame Wei Ruo, so she quickly stood up to support Wei Ruo.\u201cWhat kind of person do you think I am as your brother, and I will argue with your girls because of such a trivial matter.\u201d Xie Jue said.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with our girl\u2019s family? It\u2019s your own fault, why are you saying that we are a girl\u2019s family?\u201d Xie Ying was not happy.\u201cIt\u2019s my brother\u2019s fault. My brother said the wrong thing, don\u2019t be angry.\u201d Xie Jue quickly apologized.\u201cHmph, that\u2019s about the same.\u201d Xie Ying forgave Xie Jue, turned around and pulled Wei Ruo towards the other courtyard, leaving Xie Jue far behind.\u201cSister, why didn\u2019t you wait for me?\u201d\u201cMen and women don\u2019t know each other. I have a beautiful woman here who is as beautiful as a flower. She must be protected. I can\u2019t let you ruin her reputation.\u201dWhen Xie Ying answered, she had already dragged Wei Ruo far away.Xie Jue sighed helplessly: Now his status in the eyes of his sister has dropped a bit!Xie Ying and Wei Ruo faced Yue Qiqiao in the courtyard of the other courtyard.The moon is very round, the sky is high and the clouds are thin.After finishing the Qiqiao Festival ceremony, they sat in the courtyard to enjoy the moon and eat the Qiaoguo brought by Wei Ruo.\u201cYour Qiaoguo is delicious.\u201d Xie Ying commented.Then I remembered the dried sweet potato and sweet potato chips that Wei Ruo gave when we first met.Xie Ying asked Wei Ruo: \u201cYou seem to be good at making snacks.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not just snacks, my Meimei is ingenious and can make a lot of delicious ones.\u201d\u201cBring me more next time, I\u2019ll give my brother a taste too.\u201d Xie Ying said.\u201cNo problem.\u201d Wei Ruo agreed, \u201cBy the way, what about your brother?\u201d\u201cHe must be outside. You wouldn\u2019t be so rude to come in when he was here. You have been rude once before. If you are rude to me, a younger sister, I won\u2019t be able to stand it anymore.\u201d Xie Ying said.\u201cThen let someone bring some of these clever fruits to him to eat, and treat it as my apology for hitting him just now.\u201d Wei Ruo said.\u201cOkay, after a beating, he can still get so much delicious food, which is cheaper for him.\u201d Xie Ying said while handing the Qiaoguo bag that Wei Ruo gave her to the maid.\u201cYou brothers and sisters have such a good relationship.\u201d Wei Ruo commented, only when the relationship is good, can a younger sister complain about her elder brother like this.\u201cNo way, who told him to be my brother. I really want a sister or younger sister, but my mother didn\u2019t give me one.\u201d Xie Ying said, thinking of something, and added, \u201cOf course a sister like yours would be my brother.\u201d I don\u2019t want it, it annoys me.\u201dWei Ruo smiled.Xie Ying looked at Wei Ruo, and continued: \u201cIf I\u2019m as smart as you, I can think about it.\u201d\u201cI can also think about it. After all, you have a straightforward personality. I don\u2019t need to bother to guess what you have to say.\u201d Wei Ruo didn\u2019t hide his liking for Xie Ying.\u201cThat\u2019s right! This lady never pretends to others. If you like it, you like it. If you don\u2019t like it, you don\u2019t like it. There is nothing to pretend!\u201d Xie Ying said proudly.After finishing speaking, Xie Ying looked at Wei Ruo and asked her, \u201cApart from growing vegetables and flowers, what else do you like to do?\u201d\u201cI like to make money, a lot of money.\u201d Wei Ruo replied.\u201cWhat do you want so much money for?\u201d Xie Ying asked.\u201cI don\u2019t know, but who would think that money is too little? There is also food. More is better. In case, I mean, in case of famine, there is food to ensure that you will not starve to death.\u201d Wei Ruo said.\u201cYes, I heard from my mother that the grain harvest in Xingshan County is expected to be poor this year, and many people are trying to find ways to buy grain from other places in advance.\u201d Xie Ying said helplessly.\u201cThe price of buying grain from other places must be high, and ordinary people can\u2019t afford it at all.\u201d Wei Ruo commented.Originally, ordinary people, after a year of busy work, counted on a good autumn harvest, saved enough food for next year, and exchanged the surplus for some silver and bought other things.If there is not enough food, how can there be money to buy things.\u201cRuo\u2019er, it\u2019s a good thing you opened up wasteland in the south of the city. If that batch of rice can grow, the situation will be much better.\u201d Xie Ying couldn\u2019t help but sighed.\u201cThe wasteland in the south of the city will not be able to catch up with this year\u2019s late rice after it is opened. We can only grow some seasonal vegetables such as rapeseed and broad beans. The food is still far from enough. You can remind your mother later and ask her to get more food if she can.\u201d Come to Xingshan County.\u201d Wei Ruo said.\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll talk to my mother when I get back.\u201d Xie Ying agreed without hesitation.Seeing that Xie Ying was still looking at him, Wei Ruo asked, \u201cWhat are you looking at me for?\u201d\u201cI said Wei Ruo, are we good friends now?\u201d Xie Ying asked.\u201cProbably so.\u201d\u201cWhat is probably, yes or no, hurry up, I will give you a chance to be Xie Ying\u2019s good sister, do you agree or not?\u201d Xie Ying said domineeringly with a serious expression.(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

There are people from my family outside, and my brother is watching. Without my nodding, you can\u2019t leave.\u201dWhen Xie Ying said this, she probably forgot that her brother was pressed and rubbed on the ground by Xiumei just now.\u201cHey.\u201d Wei Ruo sighed mysteriously, \u201cThe destiny is like this, and it is hard to disobey it, so I will agree.\u201d\u201cYou stinky Ruoruo, if you promise, you agree, why are you acting so reluctantly?\u201d Xie Ying punched Wei Ruo on the shoulder with her fist in displeasure, putting on a fierce look, but it was useless. A little bit of strength, not much heavier than scratching an itch.\u201cI\u2019m wronged, isn\u2019t this the premise of your creation? You\u2019ve put on a posture of robbing women and forcing them into prostitution. I have to cooperate with you, right?\u201d Wei Ruo smiled.\u201cOkay, you stinky Ruoruo, you use all kinds of words indiscriminately, and now Miss Ben will let you know what it means to really rob people\u2019s daughters and force them into prostitution!\u201dXie Ying stretched out her claws, as if to scratch Wei Ruo\u2019s itch.Seeing this, Wei Ruo ran away, she was most afraid of tickling! A pile of itchy flesh!Xie Ying chased after her: \u201cSmelly Ruoruo, don\u2019t run away, stop for me, and let me teach you a good lesson!\u201d\u201cIdiots don\u2019t run away!\u201dThe courtyard was big enough, and the two of them ran around, passing rockery, pavilions, small bridges, and finally stopped in front of the flower bed to breathe heavily.Finally, the two sat on the ground back to back, giggling.After smirking, the two lay down on the grass and began to discuss the medicine field and the purchase of grain later.Wei Ruo has an idea, Xie Ying wants to help, not for Wei Ruo, but for the people of Xingshan County.The two stayed until Sishi, Xie Ying sent Wei Ruo away, and when they returned to the other courtyard, they saw Xie Jue.Xie Jue watched the carriage that Wei Ruo was riding on the small road down the mountain gradually drifting away, and said to Xie Ying with a smile, \u201cThis classmate of yours is a bit cute.\u201d\u201cOf course, someone who can be Xie Ying\u2019s classmate must not be an ordinary person.\u201d Xie Ying replied proudly.\u201cYes, yes, otherwise, my sister wouldn\u2019t bother to talk to her, right?\u201d Xie Jue said with a smile, he still understands his sister\u2019s temperament, she is so spoiled by her parents and grandfather, she can do things according to her own preferences.\u201cShe is not only my classmate now, but also my good sister. When you meet her in the future, you have to be more polite to me.\u201d Xie Ying said again.\u201cI can\u2019t be rude to her, as long as that fierce maid of hers doesn\u2019t be rude to me.\u201d Xie Jue said.\u201cYou still have the nerve to say that your grandfather also taught you to practice martial arts to strengthen your body. Why haven\u2019t you even beaten one of Ruoruo\u2019s personal maids?\u201d Xie Ying looked disgusted.\u201cI also wonder how a maid can have such good skills. Someday you can ask your good sister for me, where did her maid learn from and how she learned kung fu so well.\u201d Xie Jue said.\u201cNo problem, as long as you remember to bring me some delicious and fun things in the capital, I will give Ruoruo. I have eaten the snacks she brought several times, and I have received gifts from her. I have to find a chance to give it to you Only she can return the gift, the things in the capital are just right.\u201d Xie Ying said.\u201cThat\u2019s no problem. My sister asks, and I have no objection.\u201d Xie Jue resolutely agreed. In fact, my sister doesn\u2019t need to ask. Every time he comes from the capital, he will bring her a lot of delicious food.\u201cBy the way, brother, what are you doing back this time? Shouldn\u2019t you be busy studying? What are you doing in Xingshan County?\u201d Xie Ying asked.\u201cI can\u2019t tell you about this for now, I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll miss the point. Anyway, your brother and I are here for business.\u201d Xie Jue had a serious expression when he said this.In fact, it was because he got the news that there was going to be a big battle between Xingshan County and the Japanese pirates on the east coast. He was worried about his mother and sister, so he came here specially.Just in case the gate of Xingshan County fell, he could take his family and evacuate Xingshan County in time.There is no definite news yet, so he must not act rashly. Their Xie family is considered a famous family in Xingshan County. If they act too much and take the lead, the court will be held accountable.Knowing that it was a serious matter, Xie Ying stopped asking, \u201cThen you should pay more attention to yourself, and don\u2019t make me and mother worry.\u201d\u201crest assured.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go, I just happen to have a gift for you.\u201d Xie Ying enthusiastically pulled Xie Jue to the front of the carriage.Then she took out two wooden boxes she bought in Sibaozhai.Two wooden boxes stacked on top of each other covered her face.Seeing this, Xie Jue quickly took the two boxes over.\u201cWhat did you buy?\u201d Xie Jue asked.\u201cOpen it and take a look, I don\u2019t know exactly what\u2019s inside.\u201d Xie Ying said.\u201cYou\u2019re not sure? Didn\u2019t you buy it?\u201d Xie Jue asked.\u201cYou don\u2019t understand this, do you? This thing is called a blind box!\u201d Xie Ying triumphantly introduced the origin of the two boxes to Xie Jue.After listening to Xie Ying\u2019s words, Xie Jue was also a little curious, \u201cI\u2019ve heard of the Layman in the Tibetan Forest. He used to be quite appreciated by the Holy Majesty in the Imperial Academy, but after he got old, he lived in seclusion in the mountains. How could he still be with a businessman who sells pens, ink, paper and inkstones?\u201d became friends?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry about this, just open it and take a look.\u201d Xie Ying urged.Xie Jue was afraid that if he didn\u2019t follow through, his sister\u2019s little fist would come up.Hastily opened the two wooden boxes.Inside are the four treasures of the study, pens, inks, papers and inkstones.The brushes, inkstones and inkstones are nothing special, and they can be found elsewhere. Xie Jue\u2019s own use is better than these.Only this paper is a bit special, Xie Jue couldn\u2019t help taking it into his hand and observing it carefully.\u201cThis paper is smooth, white and tough, so special.\u201d Xie Jue commented while stroking it with his fingertips.\u201cHow is it? Haven\u2019t you seen it before? There is no one in the capital, right?\u201d Xie Ying\u2019s face was filled with a proud smile.\u201cReally not.\u201d Xie Jue couldn\u2019t deny it.\u201cHere, there are an extra hundred sheets of paper here. I know you will like this paper, so I bought more. The store is also strange. I don\u2019t want to buy more. The maximum is fifty sheets per person per day. Ruo Ruo gave me half of the 100 photos.\u201d Xie Ying said.\u201cHahaha, thank you Yinger, my sister loves me the most.\u201d Xie Jue laughed.\u201cIt\u2019s a pity that I didn\u2019t get the calligraphy of the Layman in the Tibetan Forest.\u201d Xie Ying looked at the things in the two boxes, and they were all ordinary pens, inks, papers and inkstones.\u201cWith my sister\u2019s kindness, what kind of calligraphy do you want? I like any gift from my sister.\u201d Xie Jue said.###The next morning, Wei Ruo carried the wooden box bought in Sibaozhai yesterday afternoon into Yingzhu Garden.Xiaobei saw Wei Ruo holding a heavy object and hurried forward to help.Wei Ruo took advantage of the situation and gave it to Xiaobei: \u201cThis is for your young master.\u201d\u201cMiss, you have a heart.\u201d Xiaobei cheerfully walked into the octagonal pavilion with a wooden box in his hands.Wei Jin has also heard the conversation between Wei Ruo and Xiaobei, and his eyes glanced at the wooden box that Wei Ruo brought: \u201cIs it the \u2018blind box\u2019 of Sibaozhai?\u201d(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

After getting the recommendation letter, the second brother can worship the Tibetan Layman as a teacher.\u201d Wei Ruo replied.\u201cDo you want me to worship Tibetan Lay Layman as my teacher?\u201d Wei Jin also asked.\u201cDidn\u2019t the second brother change his mind recently and plan to take the imperial examination? Then even if you don\u2019t really learn anything, you can help the second brother by asking a master.\u201d Wei Ruo said.\u201cUm.\u201d\u201cSecond brother doesn\u2019t like apprenticeship?\u201d Wei Ruo asked.Wei Jin also looked at Wei Ruo, saw her joyful expression, and also saw the expectation in her eyes.\u201cIf it\u2019s suitable, you can learn from a teacher, but you don\u2019t have to force it. Ruo\u2019er doesn\u2019t have to pay too much attention to avoid disappointment.\u201d Wei Jin also replied.\u201cSecond brother, open it quickly, I\u2019m also curious about my luck!\u201dWei Ruo was curious, she really didn\u2019t know what was in the blind box she picked at random.After the boxes were assembled, there were no special signs to identify them, so even Wei Ruo, the planner, didn\u2019t know which box was the one containing the calligraphy of the Tibetan monk.Under the gaze of Wei Ruo\u2019s curious gaze, Wei Jin also opened the box. Inside was the Four Treasures of the Study of Sibaozhai, all four of which were available.Wei Ruo looked at it, \u201cOkay, I\u2019m really lucky, I don\u2019t lose money if I have paper, and this inkstone is also the one with a higher price, so I don\u2019t lose money.\u201dXiaobei couldn\u2019t help but said: \u201cMiss, you are happy just with the paper. If you really get the box with the layman in the Tibetan forest, how happy you will be!\u201d\u201cOne must be content, this kind of thing that depends entirely on luck, you can\u2019t ask for too much, if you run out of luck, it will be useless in other places, we\u2019d better save it!\u201d Wei Ruo said.\u201cYou are right.\u201d Wei Jin also smiled slightly, \u201cThese things are pretty good.\u201d\u201cAnyway, I registered your name, second brother, and you might be attracted to it later.\u201d Wei Ruo said with a smile.\u201cDon\u2019t pay too much attention to it. Even if you get that letter, you may not be able to succeed as a teacher. Maybe it\u2019s the exaggerated words of that shop.\u201dWei Jin also didn\u2019t want Wei Ruo to put too much expectation on this matter, so as not to be disappointed if his hopes failed later.\u201cSecond brother, don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ve inquired about it. That store is quite reliable. Layman Tibetan rarely sells his works. Most of the people who can get his calligraphy are his close relatives and friends, so the recommendation letter works. The possibility is very high.\u201d\u201cSince Ruoer thinks there is no problem, I will look forward to it.\u201d Wei Jin also changed his words.\u201cYeah, that\u2019s right, second brother, look forward to it.\u201d Wei Ruo said with a smile.\u201cYeah.\u201d Wei Jinyi had a slight smile on his face, and his eyes were fixed on Wei Ruo.She always seems to be thinking of him, thinking of him first in everything, worrying about him and joy for him, and sheds a ray of light into his dark and boring life.###At the same time, on the other side of Xiaowei\u2019s mansion, there are also people who are worrying about these boxes.At the most southwest corner of Xiaowei\u2019s Mansion, in Aoju Garden, Wei Yichen is sorting the four treasures of the study in the seven boxes in front of him.He bought a total of seven of the blind boxes sold by Sibaozhai. Of course, he didn\u2019t buy all of them in his own name. He only bought two in his own name. Later, his mother and Wanwan each bought two more. His classmates and friends presented it to him.Now all the seven blind boxes have been opened, and there is no calligraphy of the layman in the Tibetan forest, but the things inside are not bad.The value is more than five taels, and some are less than five taels. Generally speaking, there is not too much loss.Although I was a little disappointed that the ink treasures that did not reach the Layman in the Tibetan forest were not opened, they were not too sad.What he wants now is that letter of recommendation from Young Master He You.It\u2019s a pity that no matter how many boxes you buy, you can only leave one name, which is the same as other buyers.Wei Qingwan brought her maid, Cui He, to Aoju Garden to visit Wei Yichen, and when she saw the box, she asked, \u201cHow is the eldest brother, do you have any calligraphy that has been opened to lay Buddhists in the Tibetan Forest?\u201dWei Yichen shook his head: \u201cNo.\u201dWei Qingwan hurriedly comforted: \u201cBrother, don\u2019t be discouraged. The calligraphy, painting and calligraphy of Layman in the Tibetan forest may be a gimmick used by the store to attract sellers. It may not be really put in, and everyone may not be able to open it in the end.\u201dWei Yichen has a different idea: \u201cI think the owner of that store has an idea. Last time they also took out the authentic works of Tibetan Layman. There is no reason to make a fake one this time.\u201dWei Qingwan changed her tune: \u201cThen I don\u2019t know who will be so lucky to get this work.\u201dWei Yichen said: \u201cCompared with calligraphy, I would like to directly learn from the monks in the Tibetan forest. I had this idea earlier, but I suffered from no way. Now that I have a letter of recommendation, I will fight for it.\u201d\u201cBrother is so outstanding, if that layman in the Tibetan forest sees you, he will definitely like you, appreciate you, and be willing to accept you as his closed disciple.\u201d Wei Qingwan said.Wei Yichen smiled wryly: \u201cThat\u2019s not necessarily the case. The so-called heaven and man are beyond the sky. I live in a corner of Taizhou Prefecture now. I have very limited experience and experience, and I have no way of knowing what level I am.\u201d\u201cIn my heart, elder brother will always be the best, and I also read books. Although I don\u2019t have others to compare with, I still have books to compare with. I believe that even if he leaves Taizhou, elder brother may not fall behind.\u201d Wei Qingwan road.Wei Yichen smiled and stopped refuting. It doesn\u2019t matter if he listens to these words in the hearts of his family, he can\u2019t take them seriously.\u201cBy the way, is Ruo\u2019er back?\u201d Wei Yichen asked.\u201cIt should be back. I saw my sister\u2019s maid when I was passing by Tingsongyuan just now.\u201d Wei Qingwan replied, and then asked in a low voice, \u201cBrother asked sister what\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing else, but I bought seven boxes at once. There are a lot of pens, inks, papers and inkstones. I will take some to Ruo\u2019er, she will need them for her studies recently.\u201dAs Wei Yichen said, he sorted out the pens, inks, papers and inkstones that he had divided into two identical copies, and packed them in the vacated wooden box.\u201cThis one is for you, and this one I\u2019ll give to Ruo\u2019er.\u201d Wei Yichen said to Wei Qingwan.\u201cThank you\u2026thank you, big brother.\u201d Wei Qingwan thanked her while staring at the other copy in Wei Yichen\u2019s hand, always feeling unspeakably uncomfortable.(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 72": "Chapter 72 - Mr. Heyou sees no outsidersPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 72 Mr. Heyou does not see outsidersWei Yichen didn\u2019t notice this, and went to Tingsongyuan with the share he wanted to give to Wei Ruo, and asked Xiumei to know that Wei Ruo was not in Tingsongyuan, so he handed the wooden box to Xiumei.Passing by Yingzhu Garden on the way back, it happened that Wei Ruo came out of it, smiling and lively, talking to the people inside while walking.\u201cGoodbye, second brother. I\u2019ll come to find you some delicious food tomorrow. The pumpkins in my garden are ripe these days. I\u2019ll ask Meimei to make pumpkin pie for you.\u201dAfter Wei Ruo finished speaking, he turned his head and saw Wei Yichen, who was looking at him curiously.\u201cBrother.\u201dThe lively smile just now was replaced by a more restrained expression.\u201cWhat is so happy?\u201d Wei Yichen asked curiously.\u201cI just ate something delicious at my second brother\u2019s.\u201d Wei Ruo replied.\u201cI heard that you just told Jin Yi to make pumpkin cakes for him to eat. Does the elder brother have a share?\u201d Wei Yichen asked.\u201cPumpkin pie is a coarse grain that country people like to eat. I\u2019m afraid that my elder brother may not be used to it.\u201d\u201cBrother, do you want to try?\u201d\u201cOf course it\u2019s fine, next time I make it and give it to my elder brother.\u201d Wei Ruo replied.\u201cBrother is waiting for Ruoer\u2019s pumpkin pie.\u201d Wei Yichen said.\u201cUm.\u201dChatted with Wei Yichen for a few words, and when Wei Ruo returned to Tingsongyuan, he realized that Wei Yichen had just come here to give him a pen, ink, paper and inkstone.Looking at the pen, ink, paper and inkstone in front of him, Wei Ruo sighed.Wei Yichen shouldn\u2019t treat her badly. The original owner thought so too, so he poured a lot of love and expectations towards his elder brother.But every time there is a choice between the original owner and Wei Qingwan, Wei Yichen will always choose Wei Qingwan\u2019s side, which also causes the original owner\u2019s jealousy to spread wildly.In fact, Wei Ruo himself is such a person. Once he cares about it, it is difficult to be calm and peaceful.So Wei Ruo in this life didn\u2019t want to have too much involvement with Wei Yichen from the very beginning.Not showing affection is the best way to protect yourself.###Master Yun is very concerned about the matter of the blind box in Sibaozhai, and has been paying attention to it for the past few days. From time to time, she asks her personal maid, Cuiping, to inquire about relevant news.Like Wei Yichen, she doesn\u2019t care too much about the Tibetan Layman Mo Baoyun, no matter how precious it is, it\u2019s just a pair of words, not to mention that when Sibaozhai opened last time, her eldest son had already won a pair.What Yun Shi is more concerned about is whether Young Master Heyou and Layman Tibetan Forest are really close friends who have a good relationship.She needs to confirm whether what Sibaozhai said is true, and it is not ruled out that Sibaozhai has exaggerated the publicity in order to attract business. So she sent people to inquire many times.After repeated inquiries, I learned that because the two calligraphy works of the Layman in the Tibetan Forest are authentic, and the Layman in the Tibetan Forest does not sell his works to the outside world, most of the people who can get his calligraphy are his close relatives and friends.So it can be seen that what Sibaozhai said to the outside world is that their boss Heyou Gongzi is a friend of Tibetan monks for years, and it is not an exaggeration to be able to help write recommendation letters.For this reason, Yun\u2019s specially sent someone to Sibaozhai to try to communicate with the shopkeeper of Sibaozhai, hoping that the other party can help to make a recommendation.But they were politely rejected by the other party and told that their boss hadn\u2019t seen anyone.After being politely rejected by the other party, Yun was a little unwilling and decided to take a trip in person.The blind boxes in the Sibaozhai store have been sold out. At this time, a notice has been pasted at the door, which says that Mr. Heyou will contact a person who is registered in the register tomorrow morning and give him a letter of recommendation.At this time, there were not many customers in the store, and people came in one after another to ask about the blind box of the shopkeeper, but they were all told that the blind box was sold out, and the relevant results will be announced in the near future.Mr. Yun led the nanny and maidservants into the shop, and shopkeeper Jia greeted them with a smile.Anyone with a little discernment knows that ordinary people can\u2019t afford to mess with people who bring several servants in and out like this.\u201cShopkeeper, I want to meet Mr. He You, the owner of your family.\u201d Yunshi straight to the point and explained his purpose.Shopkeeper Jia apologized and replied with ease: \u201cI\u2019m sorry for this lady, Mr. Heyou, he doesn\u2019t see outsiders.\u201d\u201cI am Mrs. Wei from Xiaowei\u2019s Mansion. I came here specially today to meet Mr. Heyou.\u201d Yun revealed his identity.In a small place like Xingshan County, Xiaowei\u2019s Mansion is already one of the best houses.\u201cI\u2019m very sorry, Mrs. Wei, Mrs. Qian also came to ask the same question two days ago, but our boss really doesn\u2019t see outsiders.\u201dShopkeeper Jia declined again.Not to mention that outsiders have never seen it, even the shopkeeper of his shop has never seen it once, and all the news is delivered through Boss Xu.Hearing that Mrs. Qian had also come in person, Yun knew that there were not a few people who were as moved as she was.Yun\u2019s brows were furrowed, and after thinking for a while, he said, \u201cShopkeeper Jia, if Mr. Heyou can write an extra letter of recommendation for my son, I promise to give you a generous reward.\u201dBusinessmen who open a shop are just trying to make a profit. As long as they offer a suitable price, the other party should agree.Shopkeeper Jia smiled and said: \u201cMadam Wei, I\u2019m really sorry, my son has already explained that there is only one letter of recommendation, if there are too many, it will be useless and worthless.\u201dShopkeeper Jia had a smile on his face, but he couldn\u2019t help thinking in his heart: These are not sweet potato leaves in the field. Once you pick a crop, there will be another crop.Even if you write a letter of recommendation, it must be recognized by the Layman in the Tibetan Forest.No matter how good the friendship is, if you put in a bunch of recommendation letters, the monks in the Tibetan forest will be annoyed to death, and the worst will be to break up with their young master.Shopkeeper Jia continued: \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mrs. Wei, the results will be available tomorrow. When the results come out, the shop will send the son\u2019s letter to the house. If you don\u2019t receive the letter, you will miss out.\u201d\u201cExcuse me.\u201d Seeing this, Yun had no choice but to give up.###Early in the morning of the second day, people from Sibaozhai went to Xiaowei\u2019s mansion to deliver the letter.When the guard heard that it was a letter from Sibaozhai, he didn\u2019t dare to neglect at all, and hurriedly invited him into the mansion.But shopkeeper Jia declined, saying that he was only here to deliver the letter, handed the letter to the guard and left.The guard hurriedly delivered the letter to the nurse in charge in the backyard. Now the biggest nurse in charge in the backyard of the Captain\u2019s Mansion is Nanny Zhang.After receiving the letter, Nanny Zhang hurriedly sent it to Cangyun Garden and handed it to Yun.Seeing the letter, Yun\u2019s heart was overjoyed, and quickly called Wei Yichen over.\u201cYichen, come and take a look, Sibaozhai sent someone to deliver a letter.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Wei Yichen\u2019s face was full of joy.\u201cDon\u2019t guess, just open it and you\u2019ll find out. You have to see this good news yourself.\u201d Yun urged Wei Yichen to open the letter.\u201cOkay.\u201d Wei Yichen opened the letter, but the joy on his face faded little by little.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Yun was puzzled, what\u2019s the matter with his son\u2019s expression?Happy Mid-Autumn Festival, dear children~~(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 73": "Chapter 73 - It belongs to the second young masterPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 73 actually belongs to the second young master\u201cMother, I am not the one who got the letter of recommendation\u2026\u201d\u201cIt wasn\u2019t you? Who else could it be if it wasn\u2019t you?\u201d Yun stood up and came to Wei Yichen\u2019s side.Looks fell on the letter, but when she saw the words \u201cWei Jinyi\u201d, her face turned pale.\u201cHow could it be Jin Yi?\u201d Yun was stunned, and couldn\u2019t believe what he saw.Although this matter should be a matter of luck, who would have thought that all the letters from Sibaozhai had been sent to their school captain\u2019s mansion, and the winner was actually the second son who had never had a sense of presence in the mansion.Yun didn\u2019t even know that Wei Jin had also gone out to buy Sibaozhai\u2019s blind boxes.Yun Shi couldn\u2019t accept it for a while. One moment she thought her son was lucky enough to get a letter of recommendation, but the next moment she told her she was mistaken!At the moment when the letter was delivered to the Wei Mansion, she never thought about the second possibility!Wei Yichen looked at the name on the letter, and didn\u2019t know what to say for a moment, feeling uncomfortable when the cloud fell into it.After a while, Wei Yichen, who felt relieved, returned the letter to Yun, \u201cMother, take this letter to the second brother.\u201d\u201cBut Yichen\u2026\u201d Yun Shi hesitated.\u201cMother, what should be the second brother should be given to the second brother. I am also happy for the second brother.\u201d Wei Yichen said.Yun\u2019s mood is complicated: \u201cBut this is the opportunity you have dreamed of.\u201d\u201cI know, I really want to get this letter of recommendation very much. Maybe with this letter, my long-standing wish of being a teacher of Tibetan Layman can be realized. But this opportunity does not belong to me, so I can\u2019t give it any more.\u201d Think.\u201d Wei Yichen said.\u201cBut Yichen, this is a matter of luck\u2026\u201d\u201cEven if it is luck, it can only prove that the second brother\u2019s luck is better than mine. It should be his luck is his luck.\u201d\u201cBut Yi Chen, this is just a letter of recommendation. If the person recommended is not strong enough, then the Layman in the Tibetan Forest may not accept this disciple. Compared with Jin Yi, who has never gone out to study, he has received many gentlemen. Those who are recognized have a better chance.\u201d Yun said.Wei Jin also shook his head: \u201cSecond brother, although he never went to school, he usually likes to study. Since he also left his name in Sibaozhai, it proves that he also wants this opportunity. A gentleman does not take away people.\u201d Well, let alone my brother\u2019s.\u201d\u201cMother, don\u2019t think about anything else, just send the letter to your second brother.\u201d Wei Yichen said firmly.Looking at Wei Yichen\u2019s firm face, Yun Shi had no choice but to kill the thought that had just popped up in his heart.\u201cMy mother knows. Don\u2019t worry, my mother will definitely find another way for you.\u201d Yun assured his son in a firm tone.After talking with the eldest son, Yun handed the letter to Cuiping and asked her to send it to Yingzhuyuan to Wei Jinyi.Then, he returned to the room alone, and lay down on the couch with a tired expression.The ups and downs and ups and downs of this mood made her feel exhausted.Welcoming the Bamboo Garden, Xiaobei handed the letter that Cuiping had just delivered to Wei Jinyi who was sitting in the octagonal pavilion and writing.After reading the contents of the letter, Wei Jinyi said with a calm expression, \u201cRuoer really hit the mark.\u201d\u201cMaster, could it be that the matter of the letter of recommendation that the eldest lady said is over?\u201d Xiao Bei was surprised.\u201cUm.\u201d\u201cMaster, what should we do? Are you really going to apprentice?\u201d\u201cThis is Ruo\u2019er\u2019s wish, and it is also an opportunity for me.\u201d Wei Jin also said.\u201cBut young master, that layman from the Tibetan Forest is in Huzhou Prefecture, and it\u2019s a long way from here.\u201d Xiaobei said worriedly.\u201cPerhaps, it\u2019s time for me to get out of Wei Mansion too.\u201d Wei Jin also murmured with deep eyes.###At this time, Wei Ruo, who was listening to Songyuan, received a letter from the carrier pigeon.Opened it and saw that it was the notes of Lay Lay Tibetan. This letter was sent by Lay Lay Tibetan to Sibaozhai, and then the nurse tied it to the carrier pigeon for their correspondence to forward it in.At the beginning, there was an unpleasant scolding, and Wei Ruo was already used to it.In the letter, the Layman in the Tibetan forest reprimanded Wei Ruo for his shameless behavior of catching a sheep to pluck the wool.Using his works to attract customers at the opening, to promote sales, and to use his works in \u201cblind box\u201d activities. In the end, I didn\u2019t forget to give him a \u201cdisciple\u201d, despicable! Shameless!Wei Ruoxin said, there is nothing she can do, she only knows this knowledgeable person, if she wants to know more, she will change it.Although the first half was full of scolding, the second half of the painting style changed, and he said that if he chooses a person with good character and decent academics, he can barely accept it. He also told Wei Ruo to take good care of himself and go back to Huzhou if he is free. look at him.\u201cKnife mouth bean curd heart.\u201d Looking at the words that care about him, Wei Ruo couldn\u2019t help laughing.Zanglin Layman, formerly known as Ruan Zheng, has outstanding literary talents and high attainments in calligraphy and painting. When he was an official in Beijing, he was highly appreciated by the emperor.Although he has been an official for dozens of years, the first 20 years were only unknown, and he finally achieved the position of Hanlin, but because of his upright temperament, he often offended people.So he retired from his old age and returned to his hometown early, and retired to the mountains and forests with his first wife, calling himself a Layman in the Tibetan Forest.Wei Ruo knew him because Mrs. Ruan had a sudden stroke and became seriously ill. Ruan was going down the mountain to seek medical treatment and found Mojiazha. On the advice of the villagers of Mojiazha, he found Wei Ruo who lived in another hospital.Wei Ruo cured Mrs. Ruan and saved her life. Ruan Zheng said that he had no money to pay for the medical expenses.Wei Ruo didn\u2019t know whether his calligraphy and paintings were worth money at the time, so he accepted it.So much so that now there are more than a dozen sets of calligraphy and painting works of Tibetan monks in Wei Ruo\u2019s small warehouse.Whenever you have a chance, take out a pair to hold activities, increase the popularity of your store, and increase sales.Mrs. Ruan\u2019s stroke was caused by high blood pressure, and she needed to take medicine for a long time, so Wei Ruo went to the forest every once in a while to see a doctor for Mrs. Ruan.Once they come and go, they get acquainted with the couple. Sometimes Wei Ruo will bring some delicious food or pens, inks, papers and inkstones to the old couple.Ruan Zheng disliked those ugly words written by Wei Ruo very much, and yelled that if Wei Ruo was a man, he would definitely accept her as his apprentice.As for the matter of accepting female disciples, someone like Ruan Zheng, who is extremely rigid in certain aspects, would absolutely not be able to do it.This time when Wei Ruo wanted to find an academy for Wei Jinyi to find a master, he thought of him. He is knowledgeable and strong, and he had many students and disciples under his school when he was in the Imperial Academy in Beijing. Being his disciple will be very beneficial to the second brother in the future. helpful.The reason why he made it so complicated, borrowing the name of Sibaozhai to ask the second brother to apprentice, is also to avoid exposing himself too much and causing unnecessary troubles.As for arranging Wei Jinyi to be a teacher, I hope that Wei Jinyi\u2019s success is not only because she has a good relationship with Wei Jinyi now, Wei Ruo still has some selfishness in it.She thought that if the little transparency in the original book became opaque, would she have changed the whole plot in a sense?(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 74": "Chapter 74 - Wei Jin is also too strong to drinkPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 74 Wei Jin is too strong to drinkAnyway, it has become a fact that she and Wei Qingwan are at odds now, even though she still doesn\u2019t want to compete with her for favor and male lead.Since being an enemy is unavoidable, then do something else to disrupt the whole situation.Letting everything deviate from the track is to some extent a kind of protection for herself.Of course, what she did is also beneficial to Sibaozhai. The imaginary Mr. Heyou has a strong relationship with Tibetan monks. People with status and background.This can make people feel a certain amount of fear. As long as you don\u2019t meet someone with a very strong identity and background to investigate specially, you won\u2019t be discovered; if you really encounter someone who has such ability and wants to trouble Sibaozhai, Wei Ruo has nothing to do with the other party in his current situation. .###In the afternoon, Xiaobei came over to hear that Songyuan invited Wei Ruo to have dinner together in Yingzhuyuan at night.\u201cMiss, my young master would like to thank you for winning this opportunity for him to be a master of the Tibetan forest. I specially asked the younger one to prepare some fresh meat and seafood. I want to invite the eldest lady to celebrate together. Of course, if Miss Xiumei It would be even better if you are willing to help with the cooking.\u201d Xiaobei smiled.\u201cNo problem, I\u2019ll let Xiumei go.\u201d Wei Ruo agreed straight away.As long as there are good ingredients, she and Xiumei are very positive.After Xiaobei left, Wei Ruo asked Xiumei to go to Yingzhu Garden first, while he went to her private small warehouse.She brought several jars from Mojiazha, which contained not only soy sauce but also wine.Although Wei Ruo doesn\u2019t like wine very much, she still makes a lot of wine. First, she likes to experiment, and she likes to try all kinds of tricks that can make money; second, she likes to give it away. Wine is a decent gift; When you are happy, you can also have a drink to add to the fun.Wei Ruo chose a jar of plum wine and carried it to Yingzhu Garden.Xiaobei and Xiumei are busy in the kitchen, and Wei Jin is also sitting in the pavilion. Today, he is not reading or writing, but drying books.Seeing Wei Ruo and the jar she was holding in her hand, Wei Jin also said, \u201cI haven\u2019t finished the soy sauce from last time.\u201dWei Ruo: \u201cAlthough the jars are similar in size, this is not soy sauce, but wine. Look, second brother, I sealed the lid with putty, but the soy sauce ones are not sealed.\u201dWei Jinyi: \u201cDo you still know how to make wine?\u201dWei Ruo: \u201cI\u2019m not very good at it. In comparison, I still make soy sauce better. I originally planned to make vinegar, but things were delayed. When winter comes and the farming is less, I will make it again.\u201d Try making vinegar.\u201dWei Jinyi: \u201cYou have covered a lot.\u201dWei Ruo smiled: \u201cI always want to learn more skills, so that I can have more money to settle down. If no one will love me, at least I must love myself and let myself live well.\u201dWei Ruo didn\u2019t know whether he was talking about the self in the previous life or the self in this life, or both.Wei Jin also frowned slightly, as if he wanted to say something.Not long after, Xiaobei and Xiumei came back from the kitchen and brought all kinds of delicious dishes that had been cooked.Braised wild pork, ribs and yam soup, scallion oil prawns, fried octopus with pickled vegetables, and fried pumpkin tips, filled the entire table.Wei Ruo poured wine into Wei Jinyi\u2019s cup, but Wei Jinyi stopped him.\u201cI\u2019m too strong to drink.\u201d Wei Jin also explained.\u201cSecond brother, it\u2019s okay, this wine is not strong, it\u2019s plum wine, it tastes sweet, like juice.\u201d Wei Ruo explained.Looking at Wei Ruo\u2019s earnest eyes, Wei Jin also retracted his hand, agreeing that Wei Ruo would pour wine for him.Wei Ruo drank a cup first, then looked at Wei Jinyi.Under Wei Ruo\u2019s gaze, Wei Jin also took a small sip.It is indeed as Wei Ruo said, the plum wine is sweet, like tasting ripe plum fruit.Wei Jin couldn\u2019t help tasting a few more mouthfuls.\u201cSecond brother, I\u2019m right, isn\u2019t this wine really not strong?\u201d Wei Ruo said with a smile, then raised the glass to toast Wei Jinyi, \u201cCome on, second brother, I\u2019ll toast you, I wish you good luck in your future studies The road is smooth and flat, with every step of the way.\u201dWei Jin also nodded, and then drank the remaining plum wine in the glass.\u201cSecond brother, when the letter of recommendation has a response, when does second brother plan to go to Huzhou Prefecture?\u201dAfter asking the question, he found that Wei Jinyi just stared at him blankly, and didn\u2019t speak.\u201cSecond brother?\u201dWei Ruo looked at Wei Jinyi suspiciously, seeing that he still didn\u2019t respond, she reached out and shook his hand in front of him.\u201cIf you don\u2019t shake it, there will be many hands.\u201dWei Jin also finally spoke, but the tone of his words was completely different from his usual calm and indifferent tone.\u201cSecond brother, are you okay?\u201d Wei Ruo asked.Subconsciously, he put the back of his hand against Wei Jinyi\u2019s forehead.\u201cRuo Ruo, I\u2019m fine, I\u2019m fine.\u201d Wei Jinyi replied with a cute face.This expression, this reaction, and this wording are not the Wei Jinyi she is familiar with!\u201cAre\u2026are you drunk?\u201d Wei Ruo asked.Wei Jin also did not answer Wei Ruo\u2019s question, but stared blankly at Wei Ruo without blinking his eyes.When he was sober, he would never stare at Wei Ruo so brazenly. This is not something a polite person should do, even if the other party is his sister.But now, he just watched, his expression focused.And his fair and handsome face was a little blushed, spreading from his cheeks to the roots of his ears.Now Wei Ruo can be sure that Wei Jinyi is really drunk.Just now Wei Jin also said that he was too strong to drink, but she thought it was just an ordinary excuse, thinking that no matter how strong he was, he would not be able to drink a small glass of plum wine.But now it seems that she was wrong, the second brother\u2019s alcoholism is really intoxicating.Looking at the cute Wei Jinyi, Wei Ruo thought of a way.\u201cSecond brother, eat some vegetables and drink some soup, take your time.\u201dWei Ruo picked up vegetables for Wei Jinyi, and filled his soup bowl with a bowl of pork rib soup, wanting him to eat more food to relax.Wei Jin also opened her mouth obediently, waiting for Wei Ruo to feed her.Wei Ruo petrified.Is this still the cold second brother?Xiaobei also stared wide-eyed, and couldn\u2019t find a word for a long time.As an attendant who took care of the young master\u2019s growth, Xiao Bei knew that Wei Jin was too weak to drink.But the last time this kind of thing happened was when the young master just turned ten years old, he drank a small cup of Nurhong, and then he became cute and obedient, and a little talkative, but he was only ten years old at that time, and the young master was not so The image of indifference and inhumanity, so it is not difficult to accept such a thing.Since then, the young master has stopped drinking, and Xiaobei has no chance to see his young master lose his temper after drinking.\u201cCan you eat by yourself?\u201d Wei Ruo asked.Xiaobei: It\u2019s over, it\u2019s over, the image of the young master is gone.(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Very good!\u201d Wei Ruo tried to praise a few words.Then Wei Jin put down the empty bowl with satisfaction.At this moment, Wei Ruo knew that his judgment just now was correct, and Wei Jinyi really wanted to praise her with an empty bowl!Wei Ruo was thinking about how to deal with Wei Jinyi in his mind, and Wei Jinyi spoke again:\u201cRuoruo, you are so pretty.\u201dWei Jinyi stared at Wei Ruo with a sincere, even childish expression.Wei Ruo didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or to be speechless, so he muttered, \u201cIf you hadn\u2019t been so good-looking and so serious, I\u2019d have regarded you as a rascal.\u201dThe distance between an elegant and polite man and a simple man is only a glass of wine, which is a glass of low-alcohol fruit wine with an alcohol content of no more than 20 degrees.\u201cRuoruo, how about I dance the sword for you?\u201d Wei Jinyi said suddenly again.\u201cWhat?\u201d Wei Ruo was stunned for a moment, but didn\u2019t immediately realize what Wei Jinyi was talking about.Wei Jin also got up, walked out of the pavilion, and solved Wei Ruo\u2019s doubts with practical actions.He wanted to show her the sword dance!Can he dance sword? What does he look like when he dances a sword with his elegant and elegant image, full of frail scholars?You won\u2019t mess around, will you? Can\u2019t wrestle? It\u2019s not funny, is it?Many kinds of imaginary images quickly floated through Wei Ruo\u2019s mind, including funny dancing, falling and falling, and pumping himself a few times.Xiaobei looked anxious, thinking whether to stop the young master.But the problem is, if the young master is drunk, he may not be able to stop it if he wants to, and it will be more troublesome if he fights with the young master.After hesitating for a while, thinking about various possibilities, Xiaobei finally decided to stand still.Wei Jin also walked to the small piece of light bamboo forest, with a hook on the back of his foot, he hooked the bamboo branch on the ground into the air, and firmly caught it with his right hand.Wei Ruo showed a surprised expression. Unexpectedly, although the second brother was consciously drunk, his body movements were very steady.Then, using bamboo branches as swords, they began to dance. The \u201csword\u201d moves with you, the body moves at will, and the sword is as powerful as a flood.Every move is like wind and electricity, and there is an aesthetic feeling of both rigidity and softness.Wei Ruo saw Wei Jinyi dancing sword for the first time. Although she doesn\u2019t know martial arts, she has also seen Xiumei and Xu Zhengyong practice martial arts, and knows that Wei Jinyi\u2019s \u201csword\u201d is definitely not just dancing casually.As a martial arts practitioner, Xiumei whispered in Wei Ruo\u2019s ear: \u201cMiss, the second young master\u2019s swordsmanship is amazing!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s no wonder he\u2019s in such a good shape. It turns out he didn\u2019t bluff me when he said that he has exercise, but he really does exercise.\u201d Wei Ruo sighed.Xiaobei is holding his forehead beside him, how can this be fixed? If this continues, the young master may reveal all his secrets to the eldest lady.Although the young lady and them are friends in need, it would be bad if the young lady knew about some things, right?Xiaobei could only worry in his heart, praying that their young master would recover quickly.After performing a set of sword skills, Wei Jin put down the bamboo branch in his hand and returned to Wei Ruo, staring at Wei Ruo with a pair of deep eyes.\u201cAm I dancing well?\u201d Wei Jin also asked, his eyes full of anticipation, like a child who has completed a task and is waiting for praise.\u201cWell, good, very good, you did the best!\u201d Wei Ruo praised.Satisfied, Wei Jinyi couldn\u2019t help showing a bright smile on his face.His usual smile is shallow, imperceptible, gentle and polite.It was the first time Wei Ruo saw such a bright smile.Not to mention Wei Ruo meeting for the first time, Xiaobei who has served for more than ten years is also meeting for the first time.\u201cOkay, okay, let\u2019s finish the sword dance, how about going to the room to sleep for a while?\u201d Wei Ruo coaxed Wei Jinyi in a childlike tone.If the situation won\u2019t get better in a while, it\u2019s better to take him to the room to sleep for a while.\u201cNot good.\u201d Wei Jin also resolutely refused.Okay, Wei Ruo retracted the idea that Wei Jinyi was cute when he was drunk.\u201cSecond brother, what do you want to do now?\u201d Wei Ruo asked.Wei Jinyi: \u201cEat.\u201dWei Ruo: \u201c\u2026\u201dThis thinking is jumpy enough!Wei Jinyi: \u201cRuo Ruo\u2019s food is delicious, the best I\u2019ve ever eaten.\u201d\u201cOkay, second brother, I don\u2019t usually see you praising my Meimei\u2019s delicious dishes, but you can tell the truth when you\u2019re drunk.\u201d Wei Ruo couldn\u2019t help muttering.\u201cRuoruo, let\u2019s go eat!\u201d Wei Jin also said.\u201cOkay, okay, let\u2019s go to eat, the dishes are all done, we really can\u2019t waste them.\u201d Wei Ruo brought Wei Jinyi back to the dinner table.Wei Jin also sat back at the table and began to pick up vegetables to eat. His movements and demeanor were very obedient, and he ate deliciously every bite.He lost the reserve and restraint of the past, and his movements are free and easy but not rude, just more like a normal person.Wei Ruo asked Xiumei and Xiaobei to sit down and have a meal together. They cooked a lot today, and if they didn\u2019t eat it, it would be a waste.The more people there are, the better the celebration, although the host of today\u2019s celebration banquet is already drunk.After the meal was finished, Wei Ruo looked at Wei Jinyi and asked, \u201cSecond Brother, how do you feel now?\u201d\u201cDelicious.\u201d Wei Jin also replied.Very good, the wine is not sober yet!\u201cThen let\u2019s go back to the room and have a rest first, shall we? Give this place to Xiumei and Xiaobei, and let them clean it up.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Wei Jin also agreed very obediently.Then he turned around and walked towards the house obediently. When one foot crossed the threshold, he stopped and turned to look at Wei Ruo.\u201cWill Ruoruo not sleep?\u201d Wei Jin also asked.\u201cI\u2019ll go back to Songyuan to sleep.\u201d Wei Ruo said hurriedly.Wei Jin also thought for a moment, then nodded, accepting Wei Ruo\u2019s statement.Finally, he entered the room, and Xiaobei quickly followed.Seeing that his young master really took off his coat and lay down obediently, Xiaobei wiped the sweat from his forehead.###Wei Jin also woke up, and looked at the room blankly after opening his eyes.what\u2019s going on? He completely lost the memory of having dinner with Wei Ruo yesterday, and he didn\u2019t know how he got back to the room.\u201cMaster, are you awake? Come and drink some ginseng tea to refresh yourself.\u201d Xiao Bei brought ginseng tea.\u201cWhat happened? When did I go back to the room? When did Missy go back?\u201d Wei Jin also asked.Xiao Bei had a tangled expression on his face.\u201cexplain.\u201d\u201cMaster, you were drunk in the afternoon and made a fuss for a long time. The eldest lady managed to coax you back to sleep in the room.\u201d Xiaobei explained cautiously.\u2026After Xiao Bei finished answering, he found that his young master was motionless, so he said, \u201cMaster, don\u2019t worry, you didn\u2019t reveal anything except that you danced a sword to let the eldest lady know that you know martial arts.\u201d\u201cI still dance sword?\u201dXiao Bei: Cry, cry, I\u2019m so sad(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He just said a lot of things to the eldest lady that he doesn\u2019t usually know how to say. He praised the eldest lady for being beautiful, and the dishes of the eldest lady and Xiumei are delicious, and\u2026\u201d Xiaobei tried his best to use euphemistic words. Some, so that their young master will not be so hit.\u201cwhat else?\u201d\u201cStill waiting for the eldest lady to praise you\u2026\u201d Xiaobei lowered his head very low after speaking, not daring to look at his young master\u2019s expression and reaction when he heard this.\u2026Wei Jin also had another headache.After the accident when he was ten years old, he stopped drinking. He didn\u2019t like the feeling of losing control of his body and hated his own nonsense.Yesterday, because of the sweetness of the plum wine, I thought that no matter how strong I am, I wouldn\u2019t be able to drink a glass of such sweet fruit wine and get drunk, so I drank it.###There was a tense atmosphere in Xingshan County for several days. Everyone saw troops coming and going in the city several times, as well as people transporting supplies and equipment.For a while, rumors spread that there was going to be a fight outside the city.Before there were small-scale frictions, this time it is very likely that a large-scale war will break out.For a while, people were in panic, and the people in the city were worried.If this battle fails, the city gate falls, and Japanese pirates enter the city, none of the people in the city will be spared.But at this time, all the gates in Xingshan County have strictly controlled entry and exit, and even if the people wanted to escape, it was too late.At this time, the Wei family was also shrouded in a cloud.Whether the rumor is true or not, even the Wei family has no way of knowing now.Neither the government nor the army announced it to the public, and Wei Mingting has not returned home for ten days in a row. Even if the Wei family wanted to ask him, they couldn\u2019t find the time.Yun\u2019s family was so worried that it was hard to eat, worrying that after the war broke out, her husband would be injured in the process of fighting those ruthless Japanese pirates.While she was worried, she had to continue to take care of everything in the family and make preparations, just in case the Wei family needed to evacuate in time and move the whole family in case of defeat.Mr. Yun had to be busy taking care of the affairs of the family, and at the same time had to worry about her husband.Aware of these things, Wei Qingwan went to Cangyun Garden to accompany Yun every day, helping Yun to deal with some trivial matters.Wei Qingwan grew up in Wei\u2019s family since she was a child, and she has long been familiar with the things that a housewife should do, and she is also handy in being Yun\u2019s right-hand man.After the two of them were busy in Yun\u2019s study for a while, Yun stopped to take a rest.Looking up at Wei Qingwan, who was sitting at the table and conscientiously helping her with family affairs and arranging monthly distributions, she was deeply moved, and couldn\u2019t help feeling: \u201cThanks to Wanwan for coming to help me these few days.\u201d\u201cMother, what did you say? It\u2019s my daughter\u2019s blessing to help you share your worries.\u201dWei Qingwan immediately put down what she was doing, came behind Yun, and gave her a shoulder squeeze.While squeezing, she said to Yun\u2019s sincerely: \u201cMother, you are really working too hard. You need to take care of all the big and small affairs in the family. Now that the situation in the city is turbulent, mother still has to worry about my father who is on the front line.\u201d Mother, you must take care of your body. My daughter does not want a rich family, but only hopes that her parents will live a long and healthy life, so that her daughter can serve you until your old age.\u201d\u201cHey, Mother knows you are filial.\u201d Yun patted the back of Wei Qingwan\u2019s hand with a look of relief.Then he sighed and said: \u201cWith your help by Mother\u2019s side, Mother can relax a lot, but the family doesn\u2019t have enough staff, if something really happens, if you really want to escape back to the capital, you will need more staff. \u201cYun frowned, feeling heavy.His husband handed over the family to her, and she must manage the family well so that her husband has no worries.Seeing Yun\u2019s sad face, Wei Qingwan said softly: \u201cMother, since there are so many things going on in the house recently, why don\u2019t you bring Nanny Li back? My daughter doesn\u2019t want my mother to work so hard. If Nanny Li comes back, she can help her to some extent.\u201d Mother some.\u201d\u201cNurse Li made a mistake, and it is already light to punish her to go to the Zhuangzi for three months. Letting her come back early may make the people below think that our Wei family is not strict.\u201d Yun\u2019s tone was a little helpless.\u201cMother is right, it\u2019s just\u2026\u201d Wei Qingwan bit her lip, and swallowed the words that came to her lips.Seeing this, Yun said: \u201cWanwan, if you have anything to say, just tell your mother, we mother and daughter have nothing to hide.\u201dThen Wei Qingwan continued hesitantly: \u201cMy daughter just feels that now is an extraordinary period, and there should be some extraordinary punishment methods. The mansion is in the midst of employing people, and Mother Li is very familiar with coordinating the affairs of the family. If you come back It will definitely help my mother share her worries.\u201d\u201cWhat you said is also reasonable, but the three-month punishment period has not yet expired, so mother should not change it easily.\u201d Yun was a little moved.\u201cPunishment is not limited to going to Zhuangzi, and you can continue to be punished when you return to the mansion, such as continuing to fine the mother\u2019s monthly money and let her do some heavy work.\u201d Wei Qingwan suggested.Mr. Yun seriously thought about Wei Qingwan\u2019s words. Indeed, the family is really short of staff now, and Madam Li can\u2019t help much in Zhuangzi. Only when she returns home can she display her value.\u201cWanwan, tell mother honestly, don\u2019t you want to miss Nanny Li?\u201d Yun asked.Wei Qingwan bit her lip, her eyes were reddish, she lowered her head with a sad expression, and kept silent.Mr. Yun sighed, how could she not understand in her heart.After all, Nanny Li is an old man in the mansion, and she was also the one who raised and served Wanwan since she was a child. Wanwan\u2019s relationship with her must be deeper than others.\u201cWhat you just said does make some sense. Now I am really short of manpower, so I will let Nanny Li come home, but she will be fined for another three months. In addition, even if she returns to the mansion, the palm Nanny Zhang is still Nanny Zhang.\u201d Yun said.This can be regarded as a follow-up punishment for Nanny Li.\u201cI listen to my mother in everything.\u201d Wei Qingwan beamed with joy.No matter what, Nanny Li will be able to return home.The Yun family could naturally see Wei Qingwan\u2019s joy, \u201cMother also knows that you and Nanny Li have a good relationship, and punishing her to go to the Zhuangzi this time makes you a little sad, but you also need to know that she is a servant of our family after all. , if she is so bold and reckless, if she is not cured properly, she will climb onto the head of the master in the future.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t get too used to her when she comes back this time, you have to let her recognize her identity.\u201d\u201cDaughter knows, please don\u2019t worry, mother, my daughter will admonish Mammy well so that she will not make mistakes again.\u201d Wei Qingwan hurriedly assured Yun.After talking about Nanny Li with Wei Qingwan, Yun immediately sighed and asked, \u201cI don\u2019t know what Ruo\u2019er has been up to these days?\u201d(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 77": "Chapter 77 - The second brother is really goodPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 77 Second brother is really amazing\u201cMy sister should be busy studying these days\u2026 I don\u2019t know the specific daughter. When my sister is in the mansion, she often goes to Yingzhuyuan to talk to her second brother. I have gone to see her a few times and she is not there. Not very clear\u2026\u201d Wei Qingwan replied.Wearing this, Yun could not help frowning: \u201cRuoer is thirteen, and Jin Yi is going to be sixteen soon, it\u2019s time to avoid suspicion.\u201dThe daughter is not familiar with her illegitimate children, but has a good relationship with the concubine at home, which makes Yun somewhat uncomfortable.\u201cMother doesn\u2019t have to worry about my sister. My sister is doing things very well now. And didn\u2019t my second brother get that letter of recommendation? I want to come here in a few days and wait for the response from Huzhou Prefecture. Second brother will go to Huzhou Prefecture.\u201d Wei Wei Qing Wan said.Hearing this, not only was Yun\u2019s unhappy, but his expression darkened again.It was only later that she found out that Wei Jinyi\u2019s box was bought by Wei Ruo, and Wei Ruo filled in the name.Although there is nothing wrong with this matter, the Yun family does not want to see her daughter treat her brother-in-law so kindly, but she treats her own brother a little distant.Yun Shi looked at Wei Qingwan who was beside her who was helping her, and couldn\u2019t help but sighed again.###Listening to Songyuan, Wei Ruo has heard the relevant rumors and guesses.Compared to the situation of Wei Mansion, Wei Ruo is more worried about Xu Zhengyong\u2019s situation.Generally speaking, recruits enter the military camp after a period of training before going to the battlefield, but that is usually, and now the situation is urgent, and he was called into the army urgently because there are not enough manpower, and he will definitely not be given too much time to train adapt.I don\u2019t know if Brother Xiaoyong has handed in the mechanism crossbow, and whether he has been approved.If it can be recognized, it should be helpful to Brother Xiaoyong\u2019s status in the army, and it can also increase our military strength, making Brother Xiaoyong\u2019s situation relatively safer.Xu Zhengyong in the original book did not follow him to Xingshan County, nor did he follow him to fight, so Wei Ruo could not predict Xu Zhengyong\u2019s ending.Wei Ruo, who was a little bored, came to Yingzhuyuan to look for Wei Jinyi, and when he entered the door, he saw Wei Jinyi playing chess with himself.Wei Ruo sat down beside him.She doesn\u2019t have much talent for playing chess, especially Go, which is a brain-intensive game. She can only understand the general idea, but she doesn\u2019t know how to play it.\u201cDo you want to try?\u201d Wei Jin also stopped and asked.\u201cNo, no, it\u2019s too brain-intensive, I\u2019m not suitable for this.\u201d Wei Ruo repeatedly waved his hands and refused.\u201cFarming is also mind-consuming. Different crops have different planting and maintenance methods, and you can remember them clearly.\u201d\u201cThere are specializations in the art industry, and different professions use different brains. Anyway, I can\u2019t play chess.\u201dWei Ruo rested his chin on one hand, looking at the chessboard in front of him thoughtfully.Anyone with a discerning eye could tell that she wasn\u2019t looking at the chess game, but was thinking about something else.\u201cDo you have something on your mind?\u201d Wei Jin also keenly sensed that Wei Ruo\u2019s expression was a bit bad today.\u201cDid the second brother hear that there is going to be a war?\u201d Wei Ruo asked.\u201cI heard, sooner or later.\u201d Wei Jin also looked calm.\u201cSecond Brother, do you think we can win this battle?\u201d Wei Ruo asked.\u201c80% chance of winning.\u201d Wei Jin also replied.\u201cWhy 80%?\u201d\u201cThirty percent for my father, 10 percent for the nobleman in Xingshan County today, 20 percent for the additional troops sent by the imperial court, and 20 percent for the good news that came out of the army today.\u201d Wei Jin also replied.\u201cWhy does the second brother think that the nobleman in Xingshan County can still take 10%?\u201d Wei Ruo asked curiously.Chu Lan\u2019s biggest role in this war should be that he asked the imperial court to send more troops to Xingshan County, but why did he alone account for 10%?\u201cHe is not a simple kid from a rich family. He has brains, understands the art of war, and is good at employing people.\u201d Wei Jin also replied.Wei Ruo looked at Wei Jinyi even more curiously.She knew what Wei Jinyi said, because that\u2019s how Chu Lan was portrayed in the original book.But why does the second brother who hardly goes out in the mansion make such an accurate assessment.Wei Jin also noticed that Wei Ruo was looking at him, and explained unhurriedly: \u201cI like to read books, and I also like to hear some rumors. Although I am in the deep house, I know enough about the outside world.\u201d\u201cSecond brother, you are really good. If you take the imperial examination, the probability of success is still very high.\u201d Wei Ruo has more and more confidence in Wei Jin.Wei Ruo rested his chin in both hands, with an expression of admiration on his face, little stars seemed to pop out of his eyes.Wei Jin also smiled, and then couldn\u2019t help reaching out his right hand to Wei Ruo\u2019s head, and when he was about to touch his head, Wei Jin also stopped suddenly.\u201cSecond brother, what are you doing?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d Wei Jin quickly withdrew his hand, and then found a lame excuse, \u201cThere are dead leaves on your head.\u201d\u201cHowever, even if this battle can be won, it does not guarantee my friend\u2019s survival.\u201d Wei Ruo\u2019s worry did not diminish.Just because the war is won doesn\u2019t mean everyone on the winning side will come back alive.\u201cIs that the friend you mentioned last time?\u201d Wei Ruo also mentioned a friend last time.\u201cWell, that\u2019s the one. He\u2019s joined the army. The last time I was in a rush to make medicine for sores, it was for him.\u201d Wei Ruo replied.Joining the army is a man.But what can make Wei Ruo worry so much must be something unusual.\u201cDid your friend come to Xingshan County for you?\u201d Wei Jin also asked.Wei Ruo only came to Xingshan County a few months ago, and since then he rarely has contact with outsiders.So this friend is likely to be known by Wei Ruo when he was in Huzhou.\u201cProbably.\u201d Wei Ruo replied.Nurse and Uncle Xu are here, Brother Xiaoyong must come together.Wei Jin also lowered his head and fiddled with his chess game again.###For two days in a row, the people living in the east of the city could hear loud noises coming from the east, and sometimes they could even see the flames reaching the sky.This made the cloud over Xingshan County even thicker.In the past few days, both the Qian Mansion and the Xie Mansion have suspended classes. Both Wei Qingwan and Wei Ruo stayed at home and did not go out again.In Tingsong Garden, Wei Ruo was looking at the account books. The \u201cblind box\u201d made Sibaozhai a full one hundred and twenty-two taels of silver.Xiumei trotted into the room: \u201cMiss, Nanny Li\u2026 Nanny Li has been brought back to the house!\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it less than three months?\u201d Wei Ruo asked.\u201cI heard that it was the Second Miss who begged, so Nanny Li would be punished by going back to the mansion instead, and she would be fined for another three months.\u201dWei Ruo snorted softly: \u201cThere is really a way.\u201d\u201cMiss, Nanny Li is at the gate of our yard right now, and she said she is coming to kowtow to apologize for you.\u201d Xiumei frowned, with a bored expression on her face.Come back as soon as you come back, why do you still have to come here to find it hard?\u201cLet\u2019s go to the meeting. It just so happens that I\u2019ve been very depressed these two days! I\u2019m worried that Brother Xiaoyong will have nowhere to relieve his depression!\u201d Wei Ruo said.(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 78": "Chapter 78 - teach nanny li a lessonPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 78 A Lesson to Nanny LiWhen he came to the gate of the courtyard, Wei Ruo really saw Li Nanny who hadn\u2019t seen him for a long time, she was darker and thinner than two months ago.She knelt on the ground, and kowtowed to Wei Ruo to apologize as soon as she saw Wei Ruo coming.Her actions caused several servants in the mansion to stop and watch at the gate of Tingsongyuan.Seeing this scene, Xiumei frowned, pulled Wei Ruo, and whispered her worries: \u201cMiss, what should I do? Li Nanny did this on purpose! What is the reason for making such a big commotion and attracting so many people to watch?\u201d ?\u201d\u201cI know what she wants to do, she wants to ruin my reputation as your young lady.\u201d Wei Ruo knew it well.When Wei Ruo first entered the mansion, Nanny Li was the person in charge of teaching Wei Ruo the rules. In name, she could be regarded as Wei Ruo\u2019s half teacher, and an old man who came out of the Earl\u2019s mansion. Yes, the scene is really not good.Wei Ruo and Nanny Li were so tough that day, and when they confronted each other, they were **** for tat. According to this style of behavior, Wei Ruo kowtowed when he saw Nanny Li, not only did he not appreciate it, but he might even mock him again.At that time, Wei Ruo will get a notoriety of making things difficult for the old lady in the mansion, so that all the servants in the mansion will have a bad impression of her as a young lady.\u201cThen what should I do?\u201d Xiumei worried.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, look at me.\u201d Wei Ruo patted Xiumei\u2019s hand lightly.Immediately afterwards, she walked up to Li Nanny: \u201cLi Nanny, this is impossible!\u201d\u201cIf the young lady doesn\u2019t forgive the old slave today, the old slave won\u2019t be able to kneel down forever!\u201d Nanny Li said with a sad face.\u201cWhat does Nanny Li mean by this? When did I blame you? Get up quickly, you are an old man in the mansion, and you have just suffered in the Zhuangzi, so you don\u2019t like kneeling like this!\u201dAs Wei Ruo said, she wanted to come forward to help Nanny Li.Nanny Li raised her head and looked at Wei Ruo in surprise.Wei Ruo in Mammy Li\u2019s memory was arrogant, vulgar and savage. She never taught her how to learn etiquette.According to what she knew about Wei Ruo, Wei Ruo shouldn\u2019t have reacted like this!\u201cMiss, don\u2019t you blame me?\u201d Nanny Li asked.\u201cI was arguing with Mammy that day because Mammy did something wrong. Human life is at stake. I am naturally anxious. Now that the matter is over, my second brother has recovered, and you have been punished. Why should I take my anger out on you again, unless \u2026 Mammy, are you still planning to continue to make mistakes and continue to make things difficult for me?\u201d Wei Ruo had a faint smile hidden in the corner of his mouth.\u201cNo, no, the old slave has reformed and won\u2019t do it again!\u201d Nanny Li hurriedly said.As he spoke, he kowtowed again.\u201cMadam Li, what are you doing, I forgive you, why do you still kowtow?\u201d\u201cThe old slave feels ashamed in his heart, and is afraid that the eldest lady will not forgive me.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t help it, Li Nanny, you are getting old, what if you break your body and fall at my door, what should you do? Xiumei, quickly help Li Nanny up.\u201d\u201cGood lady.\u201dXiumei strode forward.\u201cLi Nanny, get up.\u201d Without giving Li Nanny time to react, Xiumei put her hands under Li Nanny\u2019s arms, and directly lifted her up.Before Nanny Li came back to her senses, she heard Wei Ruo continue to say:\u201cThen check her knee again for any bruises.\u201dAfter Wei Ruo finished speaking, Nanny Li panicked and quickly stopped: \u201cNo need, no need, I\u2019m not hurt!\u201dBut how could her reaction speed be compared to Xiumei\u2019s, Xiumei touched Nanny Li\u2019s knee with lightning speed.What the palm touched was not the hard kneecap, but a soft mass.Xiumei understood, and with quick eyes and quick hands, she reached under Nanny Li\u2019s skirt and took off the knee pads tied around her knees.When the knee pads appeared in front of everyone, everyone showed surprised expressions, and turned to contempt after a while.Wei Ruo said unhurriedly: \u201cNurse really pays attention to her health, she came to apologize to me and didn\u2019t forget to protect her knee.\u201dNurse Zhang just came to talk to Wei Ruo about something, and when she came across this scene at the gate of Tingsongyuan, she couldn\u2019t hold back for a while, and burst out laughing.Nurse Zhang led the way, and the other maids who were watching also laughed.Hearing everyone\u2019s ridicule, Nanny Li couldn\u2019t bear the shame and indignation, she pulled the knee pad from Xiumei\u2019s hand, turned around and ran away.Xiumei smiled and walked back to Wei Ruo\u2019s side: \u201cMiss, how do you know she has knee pads?\u201d\u201cThe surface of the bluestone slabs paved on the floor here is rough and uneven. Kneeling on it would be too much for young knees, let alone Madam Li\u2019s age? She didn\u2019t come to apologize to me sincerely, so naturally she couldn\u2019t bear to let herself suffer.\u201d Wei Ruo analyzed.\u201cSo that\u2019s the case, the young lady is smart!\u201d\u201cThat also requires my Meimei\u2019s sharp eyesight and quick hands!\u201d\u201cSo I am suitable to be by Miss\u2019s side forever!\u201d Xiumei said with a smile.The master and servant returned to the courtyard talking and laughing, and the rest of the onlookers also dispersed.Nanny Li ran back to Wangmeiyuan in a hurry.Seeing Nanny Li coming back in a panic, Wei Qingwan came up to ask about the situation worriedly: \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you, Madam?\u201d\u201cMiss, what\u2019s going on? I haven\u2019t been in the country for two months, why did the young lady\u2019s temperament change so much?\u201d Li Nanny still can\u2019t believe it.\u201cThis\u2026 I don\u2019t know either, I have never understood my sister.\u201dWei Qingwan lowered her head and murmured: \u201cIn the past, you always said that my sister was a vulgar and arrogant person, and she pretended to be decent in front of her parents and brothers. But in such a long time, I have never seen my sister. Whenever I get blamed for my vulgarity and arrogance, I often use etiquette to suppress me.\u201dWei Qingwan said again: \u201cJust now, Mammy, when you said you were going to show some color to your sister, that\u2019s why I stopped Mammy.\u201dNanny Li frowned into the word \u201cChuan\u201d, and said a little annoyed: \u201cIt seems that I underestimated Wei Qingruo before! Miss, don\u2019t worry, I was careless this time. Now that I\u2019m back, I have plenty of time to take my time.\u201d Fight her!\u201d\u201cMommy, this is not good\u2026in case\u2026\u201d\u201cMiss, don\u2019t worry, this is all my own idea. Even if something happens later, I will be responsible for it alone, and I will never drag you down!\u201d Nanny Li assured Wei Qingwan.\u201cHow can this be possible? Sister, you are doing all this for me! How can I stay out of it?\u201d\u201cI was punished entirely because of Wei Qingruo. I already had a grudge against her. This time, the lady begged for mercy and allowed me to return to the house a month earlier. It is a kindness to me, and I will do it according to the situation and reason. Miss you Do not persuade.\u201dNanny Li has made up her mind.###Two nights later, when everyone in the Wei Mansion was drinking tea after dinner, Wei Mingting, who hadn\u2019t been home for seven days, suddenly came back.Wearing armor, the battle robe is still in place, the face is covered with dirt, and the hair is messy.(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 79": "Chapter 79 - won the battlePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 79 VictoryEveryone in the room hurriedly got up to greet him.\u201cHusband!\u201d Seeing her husband appearing in front of her intact, Yun was extremely excited and her face was full of joy.\u201cFather!\u201d Wei Yichen, Wei Qingwan and others surrounded Wei Mingting and looked at him carefully.\u201cGreat victory! We beat those Japanese on the sea and fled! Now there is no one of their ships on the sea!\u201d Wei Mingting said with a smile on his face.He was busy with official duties on weekdays. When the preparations for this large-scale battle began, he never went home, and devoted himself to preparations, day and night, advancing and retreating with the soldiers.Now that the war has been won, he rushed back to tell his family the good news as soon as possible, so that the family members who were worried about him could rest assured.\u201cBig victory? Really?\u201d Yun was overjoyed.Everyone in the room showed extremely happy expressions on their faces, and Wei Ruo was no exception.At this moment, the dark clouds that had shrouded Xiaowei\u2019s Mansion for many days completely dissipated, and the moon was seen when the clouds were cleared!Afterwards, everyone surrounded Wei Mingting and sat down in their seats.The maid hurriedly brought tea and pastries.Wei Mingting briefly talked to his children, and then let them go back first. It was getting late today, and Wei Mingting had just finished a bitter battle that lasted for several days and needed to rest.Everyone left one after another.Waiting until the next morning, Wei Yichen, Wei Ruo, Wei Qingwan, and Wei Yilin came to Cangyun Garden early to wait.Usually, breakfast at home is served separately, but today is different. Everyone wants to know more about this battle.After waiting for a while, Cuiping came out and invited everyone into the house.After entering the door, he saw Wei Mingting was up, dressed in plain clothes, refreshed.Wei Mingting asked everyone to sit down and have breakfast together.On the big round table in front of you, there are porridge, deep-fried dough sticks, pickles, and soup dumplings, all of which are common breakfasts for the people of Taizhou Prefecture.After breakfast, the servants removed the leftovers from the table.Everyone sat aside, Wei Mingting knew that the children came early in the morning because they were worried about themselves, and at the same time they wanted to know what happened in the past few days.\u201cI have to thank two people for this big victory.\u201d Wei Mingting, who had never talked much before, talked more today.\u201cWho is the husband talking about?\u201d Yun asked hurriedly.Everyone looked at him curiously.\u201cOne is that young master, who is inseparable from the reinforcements sent by the court. This time, he also arranged a surprise attack. He circled out from Wangyue Mountain and hit the Japanese pirate army\u2019s abdomen directly, disrupting their formation.\u201dEveryone knows this, so it\u2019s not surprising.\u201cWhat about the second one?\u201d Yun asked.\u201cThe second is something that we all didn\u2019t expect. A few days ago, the city recruited soldiers, and a small soldier was recruited and brought us a powerful weapon. This weapon is a slave but not an ordinary slave. Put ten arrows in it, after firing, just replace it with another one, the efficiency is quite high, and our firepower has been greatly improved after use.\u201d\u201cBefore the start of this battle, we gathered all the craftsmen in the city and rushed to make a large number of this machine crossbow overnight for use in the battle.\u201d\u201cThis is the great fortune of my husband and the people of Xingshan County! What kind of skillful craftsman is that little soldier? He can make such a powerful weapon.\u201d Yun asked curiously.\u201cI\u2019ve already asked him. He didn\u2019t make this weapon himself. He got it from an old master who traveled all over the rivers and lakes. But even so, it\u2019s all due to him. Moreover, this person won the battle in this battle. Among them, he performed outstandingly and was extremely brave. I plan to ask for his promotion to be the general banner (equivalent to a platoon leader) after this incident is over.\u201d\u201cThis person was really sent by God to help my husband and the people of Xingshan County!\u201d Yun said.Wei Ruo listened from the side, knowing that the person Wei Mingting was talking about was Brother Xiaoyong, the smile on his face deepened.Brother Xiaoyong is fine, and he has accumulated military merits, which is really great.\u201cFather, what about you?\u201d Wei Yichen asked.Father won the battle, will he also be promoted by the court?\u201cI\u2019m not very clear about my affairs.\u201d Wei Mingting knew in his heart that his affairs depended on the attitude of the Seventh Highness.His Royal Highness Seventh Prince and Young Master Lu both participated in this battle, and he knew the situation best. At that time, we will have to see how His Royal Highness will report to the court.\u201cDaddy is so brave, after reporting to the imperial court, they will definitely be promoted to Daddy\u2019s official position!\u201d Wei Yilin couldn\u2019t help but said.\u201cDon\u2019t think about it for the time being. I can\u2019t decide whether I\u2019m promoted or not. As long as this battle can be won, it will be the most gratifying thing for the people of Xingshan County to gain a moment of peace.\u201d Wei Mingting said.Later Wei Mingting said that Wei Ruo didn\u2019t listen carefully to what Wei Mingting said, and she was only thinking about passing the good news to the nanny and Uncle Xu.This chat lasted for nearly an hour, and then Yun let the children go back so that her husband could rest more.Wei Ruo came out of the dining room and saw Wei Mingting\u2019s bodyguard Jing Hu, so he went over to ask him the name of the soldier that Wei Mingting praised today.Jing Hu gave a clear answer: Xu Zhengyong.After confirming that it was Brother Xiaoyong, Wei Ruo happily returned to Ting Song Yuan.\u201cMiss, why are you so happy?\u201d Xiumei saw that Wei Ruo\u2019s walking pace was different, as if stepping on clouds, it must be something good.\u201cI want to write to the nanny to tell her about Brother Xiaoyong.\u201d Wei Ruo walked towards the house while talking.\u201cHow is Brother Xiaoyong?\u201d Xiumei hurriedly asked, her tone excited and curious.Since Brother Xiaoyong joined the army, they haven\u2019t heard from Brother Xiaoyong.\u201cHe has made military achievements.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Xiumei beamed with joy, but after a while she put away her joyful expression, and said with a snort, \u201cThis brat, he has some skills! He is indeed my fellow apprentice!\u201dTurning around, he asked again, \u201cThen when can Brother Xiaoyong go home?\u201d\u201cIt should be enough in a few days. It sounds like this battle has repelled all the Japanese pirates in Xingshan County. At least there will be a period of peace. If this is the case, soldiers should be arranged in batches in the barracks Going home to visit relatives.\u201d Wei Ruo said.\u201cThat\u2019s good! Miss, let me find some supplements and put them on Brother Xiaoyong\u2019s back, okay?\u201d\u201cGo, go, I have the same intention, you and I want to go together.\u201dXiumei turned around and ran briskly into the small warehouse.###After waiting for two days, Xu Zhengyong finally came back.Nurse immediately sent a letter to Wei Ruo.The two families are close to each other, and the pigeon flew to Wei Ruo\u2019s yard after a while.After receiving the letter, Wei Ruo and Xiumei went out using the excuse they had prepared long ago.Now that Nanny Zhang is Wei Ruo\u2019s own person, even if Wei Ruo runs around after going out, she will choose to turn a blind eye.Entering the back yard from Sibaozhai, the nanny was talking to Xu Zhengyong with tears in her eyes.(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The group of people died before they approached us. I\u2019m amazing, those short and frustrating Japanese people can\u2019t even touch a single hair of my hair!\u201dIn order to prove to Wei Ruo that nothing happened to him, Xu Zhengyong gestured to Wei Ruo a few times on the spot, and even performed a backflip.\u201cOkay, okay, don\u2019t turn over, be careful that you didn\u2019t get hurt on the battlefield, but you got hurt playing tricks at home!\u201d Xiumei stopped Xu Zhengyong angrily.\u201cHehehe\u2026Meimei, do you have to call me senior brother from now on?\u201d Xu Zhengyong didn\u2019t forget this.\u201cYou have a good idea, so where is this going? It\u2019s just a battle, and it can only be counted if you don\u2019t get injured for at least three to five years.\u201d Xiumei said hurriedly.\u201cThree years or five years? Isn\u2019t that too long?\u201d Xu Zhengyong pursed his lips.\u201cHow long has it been? Do you think that being a soldier is a matter of a day or two? When you choose this path, you should know that it is a major event that is close to a lifetime. It is not enough for you to guarantee your safety for three to five years! \u201c\u201cOkay, okay, I\u2019m a man, I don\u2019t care about you, three years to five years, three years to five years, sooner or later you will be willing to call me senior brother!\u201dXu Zhengyong replied confidently.After it was over, he told Wei Ruo about his experience this time as if showing off a treasure.\u201cSister Ruo\u2019er, I\u2019m going to be promoted soon!\u201d\u201creal?\u201d\u201cOf course it\u2019s true, His Highness the Seventh Prince personally agreed!\u201d Xu Zhengyong said, and then whispered, \u201cThey won\u2019t allow him to say that he belongs to the Seventh Highness. I\u2019ll tell you secretly, so don\u2019t spread the word!\u201dHearing this, both Wei Ruo and Xiumei couldn\u2019t help rolling their eyes.\u201cBrother Xiaoyong, don\u2019t tell us such a secret next time. Since you have said something that cannot be revealed to the outside world, don\u2019t tell it.\u201d Wei Ruo said.\u201cBut you are not outsiders to me! One of you is my sister, and the other is my junior sister. There is nothing I can\u2019t tell you.\u201d Xu Zhengyong didn\u2019t care.\u201cAnyway, it can\u2019t be done. The army is no different than other places. The rules that should be accepted must be obeyed. Military orders are like mountains, even if they are biological parents, sisters and brothers.\u201d Wei Ruo has a serious expression.\u201cThat\u2019s right, Miss is right, you listen to Miss!\u201d The nanny seconded.\u201cOkay, okay, then I\u2019ll pay attention next time.\u201d Xu Zhengyong repeatedly agreed, and my old lady opened her mouth. If she doesn\u2019t agree, his father\u2019s fist may be about to come down.\u201cThen continue, what position does His Royal Highness give you?\u201d Wei Ruo asked.\u201cSister Ruoer, didn\u2019t you tell me to stop talking just now?\u201d\u201cWhat needs to be kept secret is His Royal Highness\u2019s identity, not what he promised you, right? You have said the most unspeakable part, why are you hiding the rest?\u201d\u201cOh, that\u2019s right.\u201d Xu Zhengyong thought for a while and felt that it made sense, so he continued to answer, \u201cIt means that I will be promoted to deputy general!\u201dThe general is equivalent to the company commander, and the deputy general is equivalent to the deputy company commander.The last time I heard Wei Mingting meant that he wanted to promote Brother Xiaoyong to the general banner. Unexpectedly, Chu Lan directly promised Brother Xiaoyong a higher level of deputy general.Generally, a small soldier has to be promoted to the small flag (squad leader) first, then to the general flag (platoon leader), and then to the deputy commander. Xu Zhengyong has been promoted to three ranks at once.Although Xu Zhengyong is still far behind Wei Mingting after he was promoted, Xu Zhengyong is just a new recruit. It is already very impressive to be able to go from an ordinary soldier to a deputy general in such a short period of time.\u201cReally? Are you going to be the deputy general?\u201d Xiumei couldn\u2019t help cheering.\u201cHey, Your Highness promised me so, I don\u2019t know if it will come true.\u201d\u201cYour Highness has promised that it will definitely come true. Your Highness wants to nominate someone to be the deputy general. It is not a matter of words. Besides, brother Xiaoyong, you really have made great contributions this time, and the promotion is well-founded. , there will be no problem!\u201d Xiumei\u2019s face was full of joy.\u201cWhat Meimei said is not wrong.\u201d Wei Ruo agreed.If Wei Mingting only wanted to promote and reward Xu Zhengyong, Wei Ruo didn\u2019t dare to be so sure, but Chu Lan has already said this, then the probability of success is almost 100%.Although she doesn\u2019t like Chu Lan, his quality of keeping his word is certain.The nanny said to Xu Zhengyong: \u201cThen why don\u2019t you hurry up and thank the miss, if the miss didn\u2019t help you make a mechanism crossbow, you wouldn\u2019t be promoted for your meritorious service.\u201dThe nanny knew very well that her son could get such a big promotion thanks to the machine crossbow given by the lady. If it is only based on the heroic performance on the battlefield, at most a small flag can be raised, how can he be promoted three levels in a row.\u201cYes!\u201d Xu Zhengyong suddenly became serious, adjusted his clothes, and bowed respectfully to Wei Ruo.\u201cThank you, sister Ruoer.\u201dThe front was quite serious, but it was a pity that at the end, he showed his somewhat ruffian smile.\u201cThe mechanism crossbow I provided is one aspect, but Brother Xiaoyong also won praises by relying on his own strength. I heard that Brother Xiaoyong is very good at fighting. One can fight several times. When the two armies are close to each other, they rush to to the front.\u201d Wei Ruo said.\u201cThat\u2019s why Miss you hired him as a master, or miss thinks long-term and invited a master to teach the two of them early, otherwise there would be no such thing as Xiaoyong\u2019s current skills.\u201d The nanny said hurriedly.\u201cThat\u2019s right, my mother is right, it\u2019s my sister Ruo\u2019er who treats me better! She has the foresight!\u201d Xu Zhengyong smiled foolishly.Smiling, Xu Zhengyong remembered something, \u201cBy the way, sister Ruoer, I have used up the golden sore medicine you gave me, do you have any more?\u201d\u201cWhere did you get hurt?\u201d Wei Ruo asked.\u201cNo, no, it wasn\u2019t me.\u201d Xu Zhengyong quickly explained, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t me who was injured, it was my comrades who were injured. There was a shortage of medicine in the barracks, and all the medicines for wounds were given to the seriously injured. My two comrades were injured. I didn\u2019t receive any medicine, so I gave them the golden sore medicine you gave me.\u201dNurse patted Xu Zhengyong angrily: \u201cYou brat, don\u2019t you know that Miss\u2019s medicine is very expensive? It\u2019s all for your life!\u201dWei Ruo hurriedly said: \u201cNurse is fine, I can afford this money, it\u2019s worth it for my comrades in arms, these two days I\u2019ll prepare some more gold sore medicine for Brother Xiaoyong, next time you encounter something like this, Brother Xiaoyong don\u2019t worry Just use it, don\u2019t have to worry about it.\u201d(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 81": "Chapter 81 - Wei Mingting was also promotedPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 81 Wei Mingting is also promotedWei Ruo continued to say to Xu Zhengyong: \u201cDon\u2019t worry about the medicine, just write to me if you need anything, and I will prepare everything for you.\u201d\u201cSister Ruo\u2019er, you are so kind to me! Having this girl, I, Xu Zhengyong, is worthy of my life!\u201d Xu Zhengyong was deeply moved.\u201cAnyway, the first thing is to protect your own safety.\u201d Wei Ruo urged again.Brother Xiaoyong sometimes acts impulsively and recklessly, so she has to nag a little.\u201cWell, don\u2019t worry, Ruo\u2019er, I know it.\u201d Xu Zhengyong agreed with a smile.\u201cBy the way, Meimei brought you a lot of things.\u201d Wei Ruo said and pulled Xiumei up.Xiumei looked a little shy, and after hesitating for a moment, she simply stuffed the cloth bag she carried into Xu Zhengyong\u2019s arms.\u201cWhat are you doing? Are you taking the opportunity to beat me up?\u201d Xu Zhengyong asked.The force with which he threw the package was almost as strong as someone else\u2019s force for beating him.\u201cWhy beat you up and give you good things, those are all supplements, to replenish your body.\u201d Xiumei explained.Knowing that the package was full of supplements for himself, Xu Zhengyong couldn\u2019t help grinning: \u201cMeimei, you are so kind to me! Even if you don\u2019t want to be my junior sister, you can still be my wife!\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about!\u201d Xiumei got annoyed immediately, and threw her fist at Xu Zhengyong.Xu Zhengyong ran away in a hurry. When he ran away, he hugged the baggage tightly in his arms, and he was not willing to let go.\u201cXu Zhengyong, stop!\u201d Xiumei shouted.Xu Zhengyong ran fast, shouting as he ran: \u201cIf you don\u2019t stop, you will be beaten to death if you stop! I was not injured on the battlefield. If I am paralyzed by you when I come back, how can I explain to my comrades in arms?\u201dWei Ruo and the nanny shook their heads helplessly. They were used to this kind of fighting between the two. Anyway, nothing would really happen in the end, so they just let them go.Wei Ruo and Xiumei stayed at Xu\u2019s house until dusk, but it was too late and had to leave, so they said goodbye to Xu\u2019s family, took a carriage and returned to Xiaowei\u2019s Mansion.###Two days later, there was also good news from the Wei Mansion.Xu Zhengyong\u2019s promotion from soldier to deputy settled the general matter.Wei Ruo asked Xiumei to deliver the medicines she had packed. He wanted to prepare more, but time was running out, and he was afraid that Xu Zhengyong would return to the barracks any longer.At the same time, good news came from the Wei family, and Wei Mingting was also promoted.The actual position was promoted from Vice President Qian to Chief Qian, and at the same time, the false position was also promoted from the sixth-rank captain Zhongxian to the sixth-rank captain Zhaoxin.For a moment, the captain\u2019s mansion was immersed in cheers.Wei Mingting has been in the position of Vice President for a long time, and has not been promoted for a long time.A while ago, I was still worried that I might be dismissed or demoted.Now it\u2019s better, the haze has dissipated, and I\u2019m beaming.\u201cHurry up, write a letter to the capital, and tell the good news to the people in the Bofu!\u201dThe Yun family arranged for the eldest son Wei Yichen to write a letter to the Zhongyi Bofu in Beijing to report the good news.Although the capital city will definitely know the news before them, as a junior, I should still write a letter to explain the situation in the mansion.Then he ordered the mansion to prepare a celebration banquet for her husband. Of course, this banquet was just a gathering of family members for a meal. Wei Mingting had ordered that no extravagance be allowed.Recently, the situation in Xingshan County is not good. Many people\u2019s rice fields are not in good condition. Moreover, the weather this year feels colder earlier than in previous years. All signs indicate that this year will be difficult.Under such a background, it is really not appropriate to be too extravagant and wasteful.At night, the Wei family gathered together.Wei Jin, who rarely appeared in the dining hall, also appeared today for the first time.Seeing Wei Jinyi, Yun was slightly taken aback.\u201cMother.\u201d Wei Jin also greeted Yun.\u201cEn.\u201d Yun replied, but didn\u2019t say anything.Thinking about the special situation today, it is reasonable for him to come to have a meal together. She was also surprised because he hadn\u2019t come to the dining hall to have a meal with everyone for a long time, so she didn\u2019t recover for a while.Wei Yichen came forward to greet Wei Jinyi: \u201cSecond brother, how are you doing?\u201d\u201cFair.\u201d Wei Jinyi\u2019s answer was as dull as ever, just like his expression.\u201cWhen will the second brother go to Huzhou Prefecture?\u201d Wei Yichen asked again.\u201cIt should take some days.\u201d Wei Jin also said.\u201cIf you need anything, tell your brother.\u201d Wei Yichen said.Wei Jin also nodded.Wei Qingwan\u2019s eyes were on Wei Ruo. Today, Wei Ruo was wearing a light green satin skirt and a simple bun. She looked smart and bright.When the father is promoted, the eldest daughter in the family will have more weight. Wei Qingwan knew very well that the more wealthy the family, the more attention should be paid to the order of seniority.When it comes to marriage in the future, the eldest daughter will be more dominant.Thinking of this, Wei Qingwan\u2019s expression darkened involuntarily.Wei Ruo didn\u2019t pay attention to the expressions of other people. He was standing in the corner of the dining room, but his mind was on other things.She has a lot of things to worry about recently. Apart from the sweet potatoes in Xiaoyang Mountain in the north of the city, the improvement of the wasteland in the south of the city, and the Xie family\u2019s medicine fields, Wei Ruo is also planning to use the five hundred taels of silver she just saved to buy grain and coal from other places.Wei Ruozheng was in a daze, and Wei Mingting appeared in the dining room in casual clothes.\u201cFather.\u201d Wei Yichen stepped forward to say hello.\u201cUm.\u201dWei Mingting responded, and then his eyes fell on Wei Jinyi behind Wei Yichen.\u201cAre you willing to come out and walk around today?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Wei Jin also responded, his voice as dull as ever.It seems that no matter who is standing opposite, he always reacts like this.\u201cIt\u2019s so good, but we should move around more, instead of being bored in the yard all the time.\u201d Wei Mingting said in a relieved tone.Immediately afterwards, Wei Mingting\u2019s eyes fell on Wei Qingwan and Wei Ruo.\u201cFather.\u201d Wei Qingwan called obediently.Because Wei Ruo was thinking about the problem, his reaction was much slower. When he realized that Wei Mingting was looking at him, he called out: \u201cFather.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Wei Mingting responded.\u201cSit down.\u201dWei Mingting spoke, and everyone took their seats one by one.Now in Xingshan County, there are less rules. If it is in the Zhongyibo Mansion in the capital, according to the age of the children in the family, it is necessary to separate tables for men and women.The big round table is full of various dishes.Tonight\u2019s dishes are extraordinarily rich: home-cooked large yellow croaker, wheat shrimp, salt-roasted pork liver, steamed swimming crab, dumpling cake tube, tofu balls, boiled chicken\u2026You can clearly see a lot more seafood.After the victory in the battle, some fishermen caught it after going out to sea. They specially sent the seafood to Xiaowei\u2019s Mansion to thank Wei Mingting for defeating the Japanese pirates.Wei Mingting was delighted when he saw it, not only because of the delicious dishes in front of him at the moment, but also because it meant that the people in the city could resume fishing for a living, so it was a blessing for Xingshan County, a county with extremely poor agriculture. Big good news.At this time, Wei Jin also asked Xiaobei to bring in a jar.\u201cWhat good things did Jin Yi bring here?\u201d Wei Mingting asked curiously.(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 82": "Chapter 82 - Ruo'er can still make winePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 82 Ruoer Can Make Wine\u201cIt\u2019s plum wine, brewed by the elder sister herself. I just borrowed flowers to offer Buddha.\u201d Wei Jin also explained.Everyone looked at Wei Ruo in surprise, and Wei Ruo calmly looked at the dishes in front of him.Second brother asked for her opinion before doing this.She originally didn\u2019t intend to show such courtesy to Wei Mingting, but the jar of wine had already been opened last time, and she ran away without drinking the taste for a long time.And the jar of wine was almost full. Last time because the second brother was drunk, he put it aside after drinking two cups. In addition, Wei Ruo himself is not keen on wine. He would not drink it if he had nothing to do. .The second brother said that his father loves alcohol but not alcohol, and giving him a taste is considered to be the best use of everything.In addition, the second brother mentioned it to her, and she couldn\u2019t refute the second brother\u2019s opinion, so she didn\u2019t say anything.\u201cRuo\u2019er can still make wine?\u201d Wei Mingting\u2019s eyes fell on Wei Ruo.\u201cI can make some, brew it casually.\u201d Wei Ruo replied casually.\u201cThen as a father, you have to have a good taste.\u201d Wei Mingting said.People are in good spirits on happy occasions, the big boulder of the Japanese pirates fell temporarily, and Wei Mingting\u2019s wine worms also came out.Hearing this, Yun hurriedly asked someone to pour a glass for Wei Mingting, and then poured wine for everyone present except the young Wei Yilin.It is an elegant thing to have a drink, so on such a festive occasion, the Yun family allows the older children to drink.Wei Mingting tasted it first, and then a surprised expression appeared on his face: \u201cRuo\u2019er, you really made this wine?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Wei Ruo responded indifferently.\u201cThis wine is really good, sweet and elegant, with a rich aroma and fruity aroma.\u201d Wei Mingting commented.Hearing Wei Mingting\u2019s comment, Yun Shi and Wei Yichen also took a sip.The two also showed surprise expressions.\u201cRuo\u2019er\u2019s wine is so well brewed that it\u2019s even purer and sweeter than the restaurants in the county town.\u201d Wei Yichen commented.Pure and sweet probably because Wei Ruo used the distillation method to purify, so the wine is fragrant and pure, as transparent as water.However, many wines in this era, especially some small workshops, are brewed with rough craftsmanship, and the wines produced are relatively cloudy.Yun also couldn\u2019t help but praise: \u201cRuoer\u2019s hand is really skillful, it\u2019s the first time I have drunk such a non-violent but full-bodied wine.\u201dListening to everyone\u2019s praise for Wei Ruo, Wei Qingwan looked down at the wine glass in front of her, and took a tentative sip.She doesn\u2019t drink much, and she doesn\u2019t have too many opportunities to let her drink, so she doesn\u2019t know as much about alcohol as her parents and elder brothers do.But Wei Qingwan could feel that the wine was really not bad, and the sweet and refreshing taste could be tasted, and she suddenly felt uncomfortable.She raised her head to look at Wei Ruo, with a smile on her face, and praised with the others: \u201cSister is really amazing, it seems that nothing can trouble her, compared to her, I am really useless gone.\u201d\u201cHow can Wanwan be useless? Wanwan has something that Wanwan is good at.\u201d Yun said hurriedly.\u201cThat\u2019s right, sister, wine making is not something for ladies, isn\u2019t that what those sweaty wine masters in small workshops outside should do?\u201d Wei Yilin hurriedly said.\u201cYilin, what are you talking about?\u201d Wei Mingting looked serious.Wei Yilin was very afraid of Wei Mingting. When Wei Mingting\u2019s expression became serious, he immediately lowered his head, not daring to speak.On weekdays, when Wei Mingting was not around, he would sometimes slander Wei Ruo secretly like today. No one in the family was angry, so he got used to it.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s unintentional, or if it\u2019s intentional to slander and disrespect your big sister, you don\u2019t have to eat today\u2019s meal, just get out and stand in the yard!\u201d Wei Mingting said coldly.Wearing this, Yun hurriedly pleaded for mercy for his youngest son: \u201cYilin should have made the mistake unintentionally, husband, don\u2019t be angry.\u201dWei Yilin lowered his head very low, and nodded slightly.Seeing this, Wei Mingting did not pursue further.Wei Yichen explained to Wei Yilin from the side: \u201cYilin, the craft of wine making is not as crude and shallow as you think. A good wine making recipe is usually a secret recipe passed down from generation to generation in a family, and there is a royal wine workshop in the palace. The master has an official position.\u201d\u201cUnderstood\u2026\u201d Wei Yilin replied in a low voice.Actually, he also knows what the eldest brother said. He just said that just because he didn\u2019t want sister Wanwan to be compared to Wei Qingruo.The rest of Wei Jin just pretended to take a sip, but actually didn\u2019t drink even a drop. Wei Ruo could see it, and also knew that after learning the lesson from last time, he would never touch wine lightly now. Even this kind of weak fruit wine.One meal was used up, and the jar of wine had also run out, most of which were drunk by Wei Mingting, and the rest of them just had a few sips.As far as Wei Mingting\u2019s drinking capacity is concerned, let alone a jar of fruit wine, he would not be able to get drunk even with seven or eight jars.He loves wine, but he resolutely does not drink alcohol when he has official duties. Now that he has won a big victory, celebrating at home is a very rare opportunity to drink in the past few years. He has a jar of good wine and drinks very happily.At the end of the meeting, Wei Mingting unexpectedly took the initiative to ask Wei Ruo for a drink: \u201cIf Ruo\u2019er brews wine next time, let Dad taste it too, okay?\u201dWei Ruo couldn\u2019t refuse, so he said: \u201cOkay, I will remember my father\u2019s share next time.\u201dI don\u2019t know when it will be brewed again next time, and the newly brewed wine can\u2019t be drunk immediately, it will be kept for a long time, so Wei Mingting wants to drink the wine she brewed next time, and I don\u2019t know when he will have to wait.As for the few jars still in her warehouse, Wei Mingting only said that they were for the next brewing, not the ones already in place, so naturally they don\u2019t need to be taken out.Wei Mingting said: \u201cOkay, then as a father, I will wait for Ruoer\u2019s next delicious wine.\u201dAfter the banquet was over, everyone left the dining room one after another. Wei Ruo just walked out of the dining room door when Wei Qingwan walked towards her.Wei Qingwan took the initiative to talk to Wei Ruo, and sent a purse embroidered by herself:\u201cSister, I embroidered this purse and gave it to my sister. I am not as capable as my sister. I can only embroider some embroidery. I hope my sister will not dislike it.\u201dWei Ruo turned to look at Wei Qingwan, but didn\u2019t reach out to pick it up.Seeing that Wei Ruo didn\u2019t move, Wei Qingwan explained: \u201cMy sister has already remembered what my sister taught me on Qiqiao Festival, but I couldn\u2019t think of any good way to express my sincerity to my sister, so I embroidered a purse to express my heart.\u201d .\u201dWei Ruo looked at Wei Qingwan sharply. Wei Qingwan didn\u2019t know whether it was a guilty conscience or something else, so she lowered her head to avoid meeting Wei Ruo\u2019s gaze.\u201cOkay, then I\u2019ll take it.\u201d Wei Ruo suddenly reached out and took the purse.Immediately afterwards, Wei Ruo saw Wei Yichen coming out of the dining room, and gave him the purse.\u201cRuoer, this is?\u201d Wei Yichen looked at Wei Ruo suspiciously.(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I wanted to embroider a purse for him a long time ago. However, I am clumsy and can\u2019t embroider. Sister Qingwan just gave me one, so I will borrow flowers to present Buddha to my brother.\u201d Wei Ruodao .Wei Ruo smiled brightly, then turned and left.She doesn\u2019t care if it\u2019s appropriate to pass on the gifts that others gave her to others. Anyway, she is a girl from the country, and they will understand some rules if they don\u2019t understand them, right?In short, she dare not accept Wei Qingwan\u2019s things, who knows if she is setting her up? Although she can\u2019t think of what Wei Qingwan can plan with a small purse for the time being, but as long as she doesn\u2019t give her a chance, her plan will only come to nothing.Besides, she slandered her and wronged her, so how can she use something like a purse to deduct it?After Wei Yichen saw clearly what was in his hand, he wanted to call Wei Ruo back, but Wei Ruo had already left.\u201cWanwan, is this what you want to give to Ruoer?\u201d Wei Yichen asked Wei Qingwan.\u201cWell, probably I didn\u2019t do well, my sister doesn\u2019t like it\u2026\u201d Wei Qingwan murmured.\u201cRuo\u2019er has such a temperament. She has been in the mansion for a while. She acts a little more straightforwardly, but she has no bad intentions. Wanwan, don\u2019t think too much.\u201d Wei Yichen said, not thinking that such a trivial matter is good. Think about it.The two younger sisters are just very different in temperament, but they are both very good girls, and they are the two jewels of their Wei family.\u201cYes\u2026 I see\u2026\u201d Wei Qingwan hurriedly said, with an ugly look on her drooping face.\u201cBrother purse is kept, thank you Wanwan.\u201d Although this kind of embroidered purse Wei Yichen can\u2019t use, but it is the hearts of the two sisters that must be cherished.###The capital, Zhongyi Bofu.The news of Wei Mingting\u2019s promotion reached the capital very quickly. The news came from the middle of the capital, earlier than the letter from Xingshan County.Hearing the good news, the Zhongyibo Mansion was immersed in an atmosphere of joy.\u201cThe third one is doing well! This is a happy event, a great happy event, and a great happy event for our entire Bofu!\u201dThe old man was very happy, and his face was filled with joy that he hadn\u2019t shown for a long time.It has been three full years, and the third child has finally been promoted to another level! His hanging heart can finally drop!Wei Minghong and Wei Mingyong also had smiles on their faces.\u201cFather, this is really a happy event. Now we don\u2019t have to worry about the third brother being dismissed.\u201d Wei Mingyong said with a smile.\u201cFather, for such a big happy event, shall we go to Xingshan County to express congratulations to the third brother in person?\u201d Wei Minghong asked for instructions.The old man objected: \u201cYou don\u2019t need to go in person. Although you are only on a job, but you have an job, how can you run around? I\u2019m afraid you won\u2019t be caught, right?\u201dThe old uncle continued: \u201cYou brothers, if you are really happy for your younger brother, show your sincerity. As an elder brother, you should also prepare some congratulatory gifts for your younger brother. It is bitterly cold in Xingshan County. Not good, it is foreseeable that the grain will not be harvested before the autumn harvest. You two are older brothers, and you should think more about your younger brother.\u201dWei Minghong and Wei Mingyong looked a little embarrassed. They wanted to take this opportunity to go to Xingshan County, but they didn\u2019t want to go to Xingshan County, and their father asked them to share their wealth.The two brothers hesitated for a while, and Wei Mingyong spoke first: \u201cFather is right, I will go back and prepare for the third brother\u2019s promotion, so the congratulatory gifts cannot be shabby.\u201dWei Mingyong opened his mouth, and Wei Minghong was naturally not easy to let go. He bit the bullet and said: \u201cFather, don\u2019t worry, even if you don\u2019t mention this matter, father, I will definitely arrange it early.\u201dAlthough the two brothers were reluctant, they did not dare to fool the old man. After returning, they each prepared some things and took them to the old man. After the old man sorted them out, he sent someone to send them to Xingshan County.###In late July, Wei Ruo received a letter from Mojiazha.Lizheng wrote back to Wei Ruo on behalf of the villagers, and he promised that after the harvest of this year\u2019s grain at Mojia Station, they would keep the grain for next year, and then sell the extra grain to Wei Ruo at the normal local price.The rice seeds that Wei Ruo gave them are all grown in their village, and Wei Ruo taught them a lot of planting knowledge, which made the rice output of their village much higher than that of other surrounding villages for several consecutive years.In the same way, the living conditions of Mojiazha, which was originally poor, have been significantly improved. They can have enough food and clothing, and in addition to being self-sufficient, they can also sell surplus food for money.The villagers all remember this feeling, so no matter how the price of grain changes in the future, they will sell it to Wei Ruo at the usual price.The coal has also been contacted, and a batch has been purchased in Huzhou Prefecture in advance, and it will be shipped over in a while.Whether it is the current situation or the memory of the original owner, it tells Wei Ruo that this year will be a difficult one. The cold and lack of food will be the two major problems plaguing Xingshan County.Faced with these problems, Wei Ruo must make plans early.\u201cMiss, do you really have to spend so much money on grain and coal? This is almost all your cash.\u201d Xiumei was a little worried.Wei Ruo had spent most of the money he saved before buying Xiaoyang Mountain, and now he has to spend another five hundred taels of silver to buy grain and coal, almost emptying out the money he saved.\u201dFlowing water does not rot, and money can make money. Silver itself is just a cold lump of iron. Only when it can be exchanged for what I want, that silver is meaningful.\u201d\u201cMiss, it\u2019s good that you have a plan. When you really have to do something, don\u2019t allow yourself to carry it alone. The nanny, Uncle Xu, and I can share your worries and solve your problems.\u201d Xiumei said.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, good Meizi, your miss, I\u2019m really good at making money!\u201d Wei Ruo smiled, and then rubbed her stomach, \u201cIt\u2019s just that I do too many things that waste my brain, and my stomach tends to get hungry.\u201d\u201cOkay, okay, I see, I\u2019m going to make some snacks! The seafood I bought last time has been dried, how about I go bake you a dried squid?\u201d\u201cOkay, bake some more, and send some to my second brother.\u201d\u201cno problem!\u201dXiumei went to take out the dried squid that had just been dried a while ago, went to Yingzhuyuan next door, and borrowed the charcoal fire from their small kitchen to grill it.After roasting, it was directly divided into two parts, one part was left in Yingzhu Garden for Xiao Bei to take to Wei Jinyi, and the remaining part was brought back to Wei Ruo.After eating a piece of fragrant and crunchy dried squid, Wei Ruo happily nestled in the room and worked all afternoon.On the other side, Wei Jin also savored the dried squid sent by Wei Ruo.Xiao Bei sighed beside him: \u201cMaster, Missy is so kind to you, she thinks of you for everything!\u201d(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

If we go to Huzhou Mansion, we won\u2019t be able to see the Eldest Miss.\u201d\u201cGo.\u201d Wei Jin also made up his mind.Some things are inconvenient for others to do in the Wei Mansion, and they can only be freed when they go outside.Seeing Wei Jinyi\u2019s change, Xiaobei was both happy and worried. The young master has been avoiding those people all these years, but now he has changed his mind. I don\u2019t know if it is a good thing or a bad thing.###A few days later, there was a reply from the Huzhou government. Mr. Heyou\u2019s letter of recommendation was very useful, and Layman Zanglin planned to meet Wei Jinyi in person.So Wei Jin also prepared to leave for Huzhou Prefecture.Wei Mingting personally ordered the Yun family to prepare luggage, carriages and horses for Wei Jinyi to ensure that Wei Jinyi will have no worries along the way.The Yun family did not dare to be negligent, but she was somewhat disappointed. The second young master, who had never had a sense of existence in the mansion, had this opportunity to pay homage to Master Canglin, while her eldest son, the first young master, who had always been praised by her husband\u2019s classmates, could only stay. In this Xingshan County, I am struggling to find the next opportunity.When Wei Jinyi went out, Wei Ruo didn\u2019t go to see him off, but just prepared a box of practice gifts for Wei Jinyi, which he gave to Xiaobei the day before.After Wei Jinyi left, Wei Ruo sat in the yard, resting his chin with one hand, and sighed unconsciously:\u201cSuddenly felt that my decision was not very wise. There is only such a talkative person in the family. After leaving, I feel even more deserted.\u201dXiumei said: \u201cMiss, I have nothing to do with this matter. It is your own decision. If you really feel bored, then I will be wronged and talk to you more every day.\u201d\u201cGood Meimei, don\u2019t be jealous of my second brother, you are the most important, you are the person who talks to me the most, I can do without anyone, but I can\u2019t do without you.\u201d Wei Ruo hurriedly explained.Xiumei was amused by Wei Ruo and giggled, \u201cOkay, miss, you are hungry again and want me to make you some delicious food, right?\u201d\u201cNo, no, it\u2019s all sincerity, no skill.\u201d Wei Ruo said with a smile.###Time flies to the eighth month of the lunar calendar, and the weather turns cooler.On the first day of August, it was a cloudy day, and the mood of the people was just like the weather on this day.There is no other reason, only because this year\u2019s rice is not growing well, the rice ears are not full, and there are a lot of empty shells. You can predict this year\u2019s grain situation without waiting for the rice to mature.At the same time, the sweet potatoes in Xiaoyangshan also ushered in the harvest.Compared with the gloom and gloom of other Zhuangzi, Xiaoyang Mountain is full of joy of harvest.The hired long-term workers turned over the land, dug up the sweet potatoes, and then picked them down the mountain one by one.The long-term and day-worker farmers in other nearby villages stretched their necks and looked around.In fact, they were already curious when sweet potatoes were planted on Xiaoyang Mountain.Later they sold some vine leaves, and everyone probably knew that this was a new crop and could be eaten.But if you just sell some leaves, it seems a bit worthless to plant such a mountain.Today, when I saw the long-term workers on the mountain carrying loads of sweet potatoes down the mountain, I realized that these plants mainly eat the tubers in the soil.I don\u2019t know if the red pieces are delicious or not.Most of the first batch of dug sweet potatoes were sent to the warehouse, and only a small part was sent to the market for sale.Looking at the situation this year, grain storage is more important than silver storage.Of course Wei Ruo still needs to sell some of the sweet potatoes in exchange for some working capital, but this is not in a hurry. He needs to wait for the next few batches of sweet potatoes to be dug up, evaluate the total output, and then decide how much to sell.Now, we only sell a few at first, which is considered to be a promotion of this new type of crop and pave the way for subsequent large-scale sales.In the market, a charcoal fire rack was set up next to the small stall selling sweet potatoes, and the sweet potatoes were roasted on it.Soon, the roasted sweet potatoes exuded an attractive food aroma, which attracted many people to stop and ask.I have endorsed sweet potato vine leaves and dried sweet potatoes before, and everyone already has a certain understanding of sweet potatoes as a crop. They know that this food is edible and tastes good.The price of roasted sweet potatoes is neither expensive nor cheap, five cents each.But this year, everyone can already foresee that the grain harvest will be in short supply, and the price of grain in the rice shop is already rising. If you think about it this way, the price of sweet potatoes is considered a conscience.After the first person bought it and tasted it on the spot and said it was delicious, it sold out quickly, and it was sold out in a short while.Many people still want to buy again, but the baked sweet potato stall has closed, so they can only come back another day if they want it.###Listening to Songyuan, Wei Ruo is in a great mood.Xiumei is also happy, every time the crops are harvested, the young lady\u2019s mood is very good. If the crops matured every day, the lady would be so happy every day.What Xiumei didn\u2019t know was that Wei Ruo was not only happy because the sweet potatoes on Xiaoyang Mountain had a good harvest, but also because the sweet potatoes she planted in the yard had also matured.Although the quantity is not comparable to that of Xiaoyang Mountain, Wei Ruo planted it himself and can get experience points.Originally, there was only one hundred experience points short of the one thousand experience points needed to upgrade the space to the third level. This time, he directly obtained two hundred experience points, and the space was successfully upgraded to the third level.Not only is there an extra piece of arable land in the space, but also to unlock a new space plant \u2013 shiitake mushroom mycelium.After the upgrade of the space, Wei Ruo immediately planted it on the land of the space. Everything can be planted on the land of the space, and there is no need for her to deal with the soil and the environment.Even if the environmental factors required to grow shiitake mushrooms and ordinary plants are completely different, it can be realized on the land in the space.In addition, Wei Ruo also wants to plant shiitake mushrooms in the outside world. This situation is much more complicated, and requires the preparation of planting materials and a suitable planting environment.There are several advantages to growing mushrooms under the current conditions: First, the growth cycle of this thing is very short, and it can grow within a week under suitable temperature and air humidity.Secondly, this thing does not need to be planted in the ground and does not occupy land resources. Land resources in Xingshan County are very limited. Even if there is more wasteland in the south of the city, the per capita cultivated land area is still not rich.The last thing that makes Wei Ruo happy is that Xingshan County is mountainous, and there are many caves on the mountains. When she went to Xiejia Bieyuan last time, she found that there were many natural caves formed on the nearby mountains.If the humidity and temperature in the cave are suitable, it will be a natural mushroom cultivation room.Ask for a ticket~(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 85": "Chapter 85 - Met the Xie brothers and sistersPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 85 Encounter with the Xie family brothers and sisters\u201cMeimei, please contact the nanny, I need her to buy something for me.\u201d Wei Ruo said enthusiastically.First of all, Wei Ruo needs to prepare all the required materials, which are wood chips, wood shavings, rice bran or wheat bran.These are the main ingredients for making mushroom bags.Among them, sawdust and wood shavings accounted for the majority, each accounting for 40%.And these two can go to the carpenter in the city to buy them at a low price.The remaining rice bran and wheat bran are not difficult to obtain, and the price is not expensive.The amount of the first purchase should not be too large. After the practice is successful and feasible, consider expanding the scale.The task of purchasing was given to the nanny, and Wei Ruo himself needed to inspect the caves in Xingshan County to see if there were any caves with suitable temperature and humidity that met her requirements.Wei Ruo made a plan and started to act.This trip, Wei Ruo still brought Nanny Zhang along.Nanny Zhang followed Wei Ruo, not only increased her status in the south of the city, but also got a lot of good things from Wei Ruo.Wei Ruo didn\u2019t let Nanny Zhang participate in other things she did, but asked Nanny Zhang to help him cover up so that he could enter and exit the Captain\u2019s Mansion conveniently.Nurse Zhang is also kind, and because of the benefits from Wei Ruo, she didn\u2019t say much.She is a person who is afraid of trouble, as long as Wei Ruo doesn\u2019t cause anything, she will naturally not bother to go to Yun\u2019s to tell Wei Ruo\u2019s secret.The mountains in the western mountains are more barren and steep.If the mountains in the north of the city still have the potential to be cultivated into terraced fields, then don\u2019t even think about the mountains here. They are barren, steep and full of rocks. They can only be used as Maoshan for chopping firewood. Only the nearby Chaifu and Orion can do it. visit.The carriage couldn\u2019t go up the mountain, so it had to stop on the nearby road. Seeing that Wei Ruo was planning to go up the mountain, Nanny Zhang worried: \u201cMiss, I advise you not to go up this mountain. There is nothing on the mountain, it\u2019s really not worth it.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay, I\u2019ll go for a walk. This mountain is steep, and there may be a lot of valuable medicinal materials. This trip will not be in vain.\u201d Wei Ruo said.The nearby villagers don\u2019t know much about medicinal herbs, so Wei Ruo feels that the probability of picking medicinal herbs on this dangerous mountain is still very high.Of course, her main purpose is to see with her own eyes whether the number, size, temperature and humidity of the caves on the mountain are really a natural cultivation room for mushrooms.When Nanny Zhang saw this, she stopped persuading her, but she herself was unwilling to go up this mountain: \u201cThen Miss, this old slave will wait for you by the side of the road with this carriage. This mountain is too dangerous. Legs and feet can\u2019t bear it.\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s okay, just wait for me down there, and sleep in the carriage for a while when you\u2019re tired.\u201d Wei Ruo didn\u2019t plan to take Madam Zhang up the mountain, otherwise she wouldn\u2019t know what to do when she found the cave. explain to her.Wei Ruo and Xiumei went up the mountain together, and they did this kind of thing a lot before.For Xiumei, as long as her lady doesn\u2019t sneak up the mountain alone behind her back, she will be Amitabha.She is most afraid that her young lady will run away to the deep mountains and old forests alone without telling her. She must worry to death.The two were about to go up the mountain, when a group of people came from another trail in the distance, they looked familiar from a distance, but when they got closer, Wei Ruo recognized each other.are brothers and sisters from the Xie family.Xie Ying also recognized Wei Ruo, so she quickened her pace and trotted towards Wei Ruo.\u201cRuo Ruo!\u201d\u201cSlow down, be careful not to fall.\u201d Wei Ruo said.Xie Jue, who followed Xie Ying, also said the same thing: \u201cYingying, did you hear that, Miss Wei also told you to be careful, this path is full of weeds, dead branches and gravel, it\u2019s a big deal if you fall of!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine, you two don\u2019t worry about me.\u201d Xie Ying didn\u2019t think she would fall, she was amazing!Immediately afterwards, Xie Ying asked Wei Ruo: \u201cRuoruo, why did you come here?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to collect herbs in the nearby mountains.\u201d Wei Ruo replied, but I will not talk about the cultivation of mushrooms with Xie\u2019s brothers and sisters for the time being.Hearing this, Xie Ying\u2019s eyes lit up: \u201cRuoruo the one you gave me last time, I\u2019ll give it to my mother, and my mother will have someone stew it the way you said and drink it and say it will work!\u201d\u201cAs long as it works.\u201d Wei Ruo said with a smile.\u201cSo I\u2019m going to collect herbs this time too! When I get them, I\u2019ll tell you how to use them!\u201d With the previous successful experience, Xie Ying is very motivated this time.Xie Jue was listening in a daze, and asked: \u201cSister, what medicine did you bring back for mother last time? Is mother sick? Why do you need to take medicine?\u201d\u201cThis is about our girl\u2019s family, I won\u2019t tell you!\u201d Xie Ying dragged Wei Ruo aside, deliberately not letting Xie Jue listen to their conversation.Xie Jue had a headache for a while: \u201cSister, at least I have a share of my mother, can I care about my mother\u2019s physical condition?\u201d\u201cNo, no!\u201d Xie Ying refused.Xie Jue couldn\u2019t convince Xie Ying, so he turned to Wei Ruo: \u201cSister Wei, tell me, what\u2019s wrong with my mother?\u201d\u201cMaster Lingtang is fine, please rest assured Mr. Xie.\u201d Wei Ruo replied.Xie Yingchong said proudly, \u201cBrother, just give up, Ruoruo and I are on the same boat.\u201dXie Jue sighed helplessly: \u201cAlright then.\u201dXie Ying dragged Wei Ruo up the mountain while chatting with Wei Ruo.Wei Ruo asked Xie Ying: \u201cBy the way, why are you here?\u201d\u201cYou forgot, my family has a separate courtyard near here. My brother and I walked around this courtyard, and then walked around the neighborhood by the way.\u201dXie Ying is an active person, always staying at home, she feels bored and flustered.Now that Xie Jue was here, she took a chance and asked Xie Jue to take her out.After walking for a while, Wei Ruo found some horse chestnuts.Wei Ruo picked them like a baby.\u201cRuoruo, what is this?\u201d Xie Ying asked curiously.\u201cThis is called Aescin, also known as Chonglou. It is a good thing to detoxify snakes. You can see that it is easy to identify. Generally speaking, there are seven leaves in a circle, and there are six. This thing is quite hard to find. Yes, I didn\u2019t expect to be so lucky today, and I\u2019ll see you when I go up the mountain.\u201d Wei Ruo explained.Xie Ying wrote it down carefully, and Xie Jue, who was at the side, also listened with gusto.Following Xie Ying to search around, they also found the same one, and quickly called Wei Ruo to come and identify it.\u201cYes, this is Echinacea.\u201dGetting Wei Ruo\u2019s affirmative answer, Xie Ying dug carefully.After digging out a complete plant, he proudly showed off to Xie Jue: \u201cLook, bro, I dug well.\u201d\u201cWell, my sister dug the most beautiful one.\u201d Xie Jue praised without principle.Sister\u2019s must be the best, there is no doubt about it.Even if you simply dig a herb, it must look better than others.Xie Ying finished digging Aescin, then ran to see Wei Ruo picking grass on the ground.\u201cRuoruo, isn\u2019t this a withered weed? Why are you picking it?\u201d Xie Ying asked.(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

What is it used for?\u201d\u201cPrunella vulgaris is very effective in treating scrofula, and because of the high mortality rate of scrofula, Prunella vulgaris is very precious and valuable. However, Prunella vulgaris grows very ordinary. It is different from weeds. It grows in summer. When the inflorescence is like withered grass, it gets its name and is ignored by people.\u201d Wei Ruo explained.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect it to be so common and useful.\u201d Xie Ying knelt down to help Wei Ruo pick it.\u201cIn addition, Prunella vulgaris can also be used to make herbal tea. If you cook it with lotus leaves and light bamboo leaves, you can get a delicious herbal tea.\u201d Wei Ruo added.\u201cRuo Ruo, do you still know how to make herbal tea?\u201d Xie Ying asked.\u201cIt\u2019s very simple to make herbal tea, just put the ingredients into the water and cook together, there is no skill, I also make Shaoxiancao and Guiling jelly, which is a little more complicated, but they are all good things to cool and relieve summer heat. \u201cWei Ruo said.\u201cRuoruo, you are such a treasure! I want to take you home and hide you inside!\u201dXiumei on the side couldn\u2019t help but said: \u201cMiss Xie, kidnapping is against the law. If you want to take my lady back, I\u2019m going to report to the police!\u201dXie Ying flattened her mouth: \u201cWith you here, can I tie up your lady? How about I give you money, and you help me tie up your lady.\u201dXiumei immediately asked Wei Ruo: \u201cMiss, Miss Xie said she would give me money. If you give me more money, can I think about it?\u201dWei Ruo nodded: \u201cIt can be considered. If I give enough, I can consider taking the initiative to cooperate with being kidnapped by you, and then share half of the stolen money with you.\u201dXiumei agrees: \u201cYeah, yes, after we get the money, I will go to the Xie Mansion to rescue the young lady!\u201dXie Ying was stunned: \u201cOkay, you two, work together to calculate my money in front of me!\u201dAs he spoke, he raised his hand and gestured to throw the freshly picked Prunella vulgaris on Wei Ruo\u2019s body, but after looking at it twice, he was reluctant to throw it, so he changed the direction and threw it heavily into Wei Ruo\u2019s medicine basket.Xie Jue stood five steps away, watching the three little girls fight and couldn\u2019t help laughing out loud.This Miss Wei family is really an old spirit, no wonder she can subdue her little sister who does her own way.After walking for a while, Wei Ruo saw a cave.Wei Ruo walked towards the cave curiously, but Xie Jue hurriedly stopped him: \u201cSister Wei, don\u2019t go there, this cave is dangerous.\u201d\u201cDangerous?\u201d Wei Ruo turned to look at Xie Jue suspiciously.\u201cThe caves in Xingshan County are relatively large and deep, and some caves have complex internal structures. I\u2019m worried that there may be some wild animals or snakes, rats, insects and the like inside.\u201d Xie Jue explained.\u201cThank you for your kindness, my lord, but I still want to go in and have a look. Don\u2019t worry, I am a maid, and we have experience in dealing with snakes, rats, insects and ants. If we encounter any problems, we will be able to deal with them.\u201dXie Jue believed these words, but for the sake of safety, he decided to go in with him.\u201cI will follow behind you. If there is any danger, I can help in time.\u201d Xie Jue said.\u201cThen I will go too.\u201d Xie Ying strode forward.Xie Jue hurriedly held her back: \u201cYingying, what are you going to do?\u201d\u201cYou all go, why can\u2019t I go? I\u2019m also very good.\u201d Although Xie Ying has never practiced martial arts, she is very good at horseback riding and archery, much more capable than ordinary girls.\u201cBut there may be snakes, rats, insects and ants in this cave, aren\u2019t you afraid?\u201d Xie Jue asked.\u201cIf not afraid, why should I be afraid?\u201d Xie Ying was not timid at all.\u201cIf Yingying wants to go, I have an anti-insect ointment here.\u201d Wei Ruo immediately took out a porcelain box from the backpack he brought.After unscrewing the box, there is a light yellow waxy paste inside.Wei Ruo put the pulp of his index finger on the paste and kneaded it carefully, then smeared it on Xie Ying\u2019s wrist and ear base.Xie Ying put her wrist in front of her nose and smelled it, \u201cIt smells good, there is a faint fruity scent, sweet, and it smells good.\u201d\u201cWell, I specially made the fragrance. Didn\u2019t I learn how to do it from my husband recently? I just used it on this ointment. It used to be that the ointment had an obvious smell of medicine, which would be unpleasant.\u201d Wei Ruo explained.\u201cPractice what you have learned, Ruoruo, you are really amazing!\u201d Xie Ying couldn\u2019t help but praised Wei Ruo again.Xie Jue, who was behind Xie Ying, was also amazed at this. This Miss Wei family is really interesting. The treasures on her body seem to be endless, and she can constantly surprise people.Xie Jue looked at Wei Ruo with admiration and approval in his eyes, and a smile appeared on his face unconsciously.Xie Ying asked Wei Ruo: \u201cRuoruo, can you give some of your ointment to my brother? I\u2019m also afraid that he will be bitten by insects and ants.\u201dWei Shuojian stuffed the whole box of ointment into Xie Ying\u2019s hand: \u201cThis is for you.\u201d\u201cIf you send me off, what about you?\u201d Xie Ying asked.\u201cI still have, I made several boxes at a time.\u201d Wei Ruo replied.\u201cThat\u2019s good!\u201d Xie Ying stopped being polite to Wei Ruo. After accepting Wei Ruo\u2019s ointment, she turned around and handed it to Xie Jue.\u201cI\u2019ll paint a little for you, save some, and return it to me after you paint it.\u201d\u201cI know, I know.\u201d Xie Jue replied with a smile.After all four of them applied the insect repellent ointment, they entered the cave together.Xie Jue walked in the front, guarding the three girls behind.The cave is a bit narrow and the road is complicated. After walking for a while, Wei Ruo said, \u201cLet\u2019s go out, this cave is not what I want to find, and the road here is narrow and has forks. It may be dangerous to continue going forward.\u201dAlthough Xie Jue and Xie Ying didn\u2019t know the reason, but after Wei Ruo said so, they stopped staying, turned around, and retreated from the cave.After exiting, Xie Jue asked Wei Ruo: \u201cSister Wei, what kind of cave is she planning to find? I used to play around here when I was young, and I know something about the area. Maybe I can help you.\u201dLooking at Xie Jue\u2019s serious face, Wei Ruo thought for a while, and then expressed his thoughts: \u201cI want to find a cave with a large space, and the temperature inside is right, warm in winter and cool in summer.\u201d\u201cLarge space, warm in winter and cool in summer\u2026\u201d Xie Jue thought about it seriously, \u201cIt seems that there is such a cave on the mountainside along this trail that meets your requirements.\u201d\u201cMaster Xie, do you remember how to get there?\u201d Wei Ruo asked hurriedly.\u201cWell, I remember, I will show you the way.\u201d Xie Jue said.\u201cThank you so much, son!\u201d Wei Ruo said gratefully.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be so polite with me.\u201d Xie Jue looked at Wei Ruo with a gentle smile.After the polite greetings, Xie Jue walked to the front and took Wei Ruo, Xiumei and his sister to the halfway up the mountain.After bypassing several large rocks, a spacious cave entrance appeared in front of us.Xie Jue was still at the front, and the three girls followed behind\u2026(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 87": "Chapter 87 - For Xie Ying FangziPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 87 Prescription for Xie YingThis time, the cave was very spacious from the entrance, and several people could stride in with their backs straight. Even the tallest Xie Jue didn\u2019t need to bow his head.After walking seven or eight steps, the space inside becomes even bigger.Inside is a complete and huge irregular space, with no branches or forks, and the cave can be seen at a glance.The cave is not deep, but the entrance is wide and high, so the outside light can still shine into the cave, so that people who enter the cave can see the whole picture of the cave clearly.The caves are mostly surrounded by stone walls, and occasionally some places are earth walls with vines growing on them. It can be seen that this cave is very strong, and generally there will be no problem of collapse.Wei Ruo can also see flowing water on the stone wall on the right, which shows that the humidity in this cave will not be low.In terms of temperature, the temperature in the cave at this time is very comfortable.Wei Ruo walked around the stone wall and checked the situation of the entire cave.She found some wild mushrooms in some corners, off-white, slender, unusable species.But this also proves that the environment of this cave is suitable for the growth of mushrooms.\u201cWhat does sister Wei think, does it match what you think?\u201d Xie Jue asked after Wei Ruo walked around.Wei Ruo nodded: \u201cWell, this is very suitable for the cave I want to find.\u201dXie Jue couldn\u2019t help but smile: \u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201dHe thoughtfully did not ask Wei Ruo why he wanted to find such a cave.If Wei Ruo didn\u2019t say it at the beginning of the day, it would be inconvenient to reveal it. If that\u2019s the case, he\u2019d better not ask too many questions. If Wei\u2019s younger sister wants to say something, she will naturally say it.The cave is almost finished, Wei Ruo said to the Xie brothers and sisters: \u201cOkay, I\u2019ve finished watching, this cave is pretty good, but we\u2019ll talk about what to do next time, let\u2019s go out first.\u201d\u201cThen shall we continue to collect herbs?\u201d Xie Ying asked.\u201cIf you want, let\u2019s continue walking up the mountain and gather more herbs.\u201d Wei Ruo said.\u201cGo, I\u2019m going to pick some useful herbs myself, and then go back to nourish my mother\u2019s body.\u201d Xie Ying said.She has money, but the money was given to her by her mother. Using the money from her mother to buy herbs for her mother is not her ability. If she picks her own herbs, the meaning is different.Xie Jue looked at his younger sister who was in high spirits, and helplessly said to Wei Ruo: \u201cMy younger sister is not satisfied yet, so please ask the younger sister of the Wei family to continue to take us to look for herbs.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Wei Ruo agreed.After leaving the cave, the group went deeper into the woods.The further you go into the mountains, the higher the probability of finding precious herbs.Finally, at dusk, the four came down from the mountain.When they came down, Xiumei and Xie Jue each carried a bamboo basket, and the basket was full.Wei Ruo wrapped a bag with a cloth bag, Xie Ying didn\u2019t have a cloth bag, so she took off her brother\u2019s robe and used it as a bag to hold the remaining herbs.Most of these herbs are not very valuable, and the sum of them may not be as valuable as Xie Jue\u2019s cloud brocade robe.Is there any way, my sister wants to use it, how dare Xie Jue refuse?After arriving at the foot of the mountain, Xie Ying wanted to give Wei Ruo most of the herbs, and only kept a few for her mother to make herbal tea.Wei Ruo refused: \u201cIf you pick it yourself, it will naturally belong to you.\u201dXie Ying: \u201cNo, I just need some Prunella vulgaris to make herbal tea for my mother.\u201dWei Ruo: \u201cWhat you pick yourself is yours.\u201dXie Ying: \u201cBut if you didn\u2019t tell me and teach me, I wouldn\u2019t know them at all, and I wouldn\u2019t pick them back.\u201dWei Ruo: \u201cTeaching belongs to teaching, learning comes from picking. The knowledge you have learned is your own, and the fruits of your own labor are also your own.\u201dXie Ying thought for a while: \u201cThat\u2019s fine.\u201dXie Ying turned her head and said to Xie Jue: \u201cBrother, you have to take care of these herbs, don\u2019t throw them away, even if there is one less!\u201dXie Jue smiled and promised repeatedly: \u201cOkay, okay, I got it, I must have seen it well.\u201dWei Ruo smiled, and then asked: \u201cDo you have a pen and paper?\u201d\u201cWhat do you need a pen and paper for?\u201d Xie Jue asked.\u201cThe herbs we picked today can just make a nourishing medicinal soup. The medicinal properties are mild and suitable for women to take. I will write it down. When you go back, you can process the medicinal materials according to the method I wrote, and then mix and cook them.\u201d Wei Ruo said.Xie Ying said that she wanted to gather herbs for her mother\u2019s health. Now that the herbs are picked, Wei Ruozi wants a good person to do it to the end, so he gave Xie Ying the prescription.\u201cRuoruo, do you still want to give me a prescription?\u201d Xie Ying asked.\u201cWell, although herbal tea is simple, it has no nourishing effect, and now that the weather has turned cold, it is not advisable to drink more herbal tea.\u201d Wei Ruo said.Xie Ying was very happy, she came forward to hug Wei Ruo and said, \u201cRuo Ruo, you are so kind!\u201dXie Jue didn\u2019t have a pen and paper on him, so he hurriedly asked the servants who followed him from afar to go back to the other courtyard to get it.When he and his sister went out, the servants would definitely follow them. When they were on the mountain just now, these servants were always there, but they were far away from each other so that they could play with Wei Ruo more comfortably.After the servants of the Xie family took back the pen and paper, Wei Ruo found a relatively flat stone and wrote down the prescription.Xie Jue, who was watching from the side, couldn\u2019t help laughing at Wei Ruo\u2019s crooked words.Xie Jue didn\u2019t laugh at it either, but felt a little cute.It seems that the Wei family sister is not good at everything.Then her sister pinched her arm mercilessly.Xie Ying gave Xie Jue a white look, and warned him not to laugh at her good sister\u2019s words, even though they were indeed ugly.Xie Jue finally stopped laughing.Wei Ruo wrote very carefully, and by the way, clearly wrote about the treatment of the herbs picked today.After finishing writing, he handed the prescription to Xie Ying, and then bid farewell to the two.After separating from the Xie family brothers and sisters, Wei Ruo and Xiumei returned to the carriage parked by the side of the road along the way they came.Looking at Wei Ruo, who came back so late, Zhang Momo said helplessly: \u201cMiss, you are going to kill me. If you don\u2019t come back, I will go back to rescue the soldiers! It\u2019s okay for me to hide it for you, but you Don\u2019t let anything happen, then I won\u2019t be able to eat and walk around!\u201d\u201cUnderstood, next time I will try to be earlier.\u201d Wei Ruo said.She also knew that it was a little late today. There is no way, Xie Ying refused to leave in the situation on the mountain just now, and it is impossible for her to drag Xie Ying.Nurse Zhang sighed: \u201cForget it, forget it, as long as you are fine.\u201dWei Ruo and Xiumei got into the carriage, and on the way back, Wei Ruo began to think about the next arrangement.I have found a suitable cave, and this one is enough for now. After the later experiments are successful, Wei Ruo will consider expanding the scale.(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Applying this ointment may help me avoid this trouble.\u201d\u201cI will give it to you if you need it.\u201d Xie Ying is very generous to her family, as long as Xie Jue has a legitimate reason, she will not be stingy and refuse to give it to him.Then Xie Ying added: \u201cBut don\u2019t forget that you have to return the gift to Ruoruo, last time I asked you to bring some good things back from the capital, but you haven\u2019t brought them back to me until now, so I don\u2019t even have a gift Send it home.\u201dXie Jue shouted: \u201cSister, you have wronged me. From the last time until now, I have been in Xingshan County and have never left, let alone the capital city. How can I bring you something back? \u201c\u201cThen what have you been doing in Xingshan County? Haven\u2019t you finished your work yet?\u201d Xie Ying asked.\u201cSome of them are already busy, and there are still some things that need to be dealt with.\u201d Xie Jue replied.The war is over for the time being. He should have gone back, but because of the matter of the Seventh Prince, his grandfather ordered him to stay longer in Xingshan County.\u201cWell, I\u2019m going to Taizhou Mansion in two days. His Royal Highness Seventh is in the city now, and I need to go there for some things. Then I will spare some time to come back and buy some new things for you and Wei\u2019s younger sister.\u201d Xie Jue said after thinking for a while.\u201cOkay, you have to buy it carefully. Mine is not important. People have given me things several times. I return them decently. Don\u2019t be ashamed.\u201d Xie Ying urged.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t embarrass my sister.\u201d Xie Jue promised with a smile.The brothers and sisters chatted and laughed for a while, and then left the other courtyard with today\u2019s harvest and returned to Xie\u2019s main house.###After receiving Wei Ruo\u2019s notice, the nanny acted immediately, and while telling her husband to buy what Wei Ruo needed, she went to talk to the village near Xishan instead of Wei Ruo.The process of the conversation was surprisingly smooth. The nanny just said that she planned to hire people from the village for a monthly salary of 150 Wen, and Lizheng agreed without hesitation.In order to respect Lizheng, according to Wei Ruo\u2019s wishes, the nanny handed over the power of selection to Lizheng, and asked Lizheng to select suitable and capable young people in the village.Lizheng declined at first, but after listening to Xu\u2019s mother saying that if they make it, they will expand the scale in the future and need to hire more people, Lizheng readily agreed.Because it is not easy to push only one or two people, but if there are ten or twenty job opportunities, it is relatively easy for him to arrange, so there is no need to worry too much about the villagers\u2019 opinions on his arrangement.This is good news for them, a poor mountain village located in the west of Xingshan County. They don\u2019t have any skills, and their family is only a bit of Susukida. There is not enough food when the weather is good, let alone in recent years.There is a job for them to do, and there are two hundred Wen a month, which is enough to feed the family.After the materials are collected, configure them according to the ratio given by Wei Ruo.Filled into a cylindrical medium, like a piece of dead wood.Then it was sent to the cave, and the follow-up work was handed over to the hired villagers Li Erniu and He Dong.The content of the work is not complicated. The main thing is to take care of it, to ensure that no wild animals or people enter the cave to destroy it, and then to observe the growth of the mushrooms and report regularly.Seven days later.When the first batch of shiitake mushrooms were grown, the nanny went there personally. After setting the picking standards, she asked Li Erniu and He Dong, who were in charge, to pick all the shiitake mushrooms that reached the standard size. down the mountain.Immediately afterwards, the nanny sent someone to deliver some to Wei Ruo at Wei Mansion.Seeing the first batch of shiitake mushrooms successfully cultivated outside, Wei Ruo was overjoyed.It took only seven days to harvest. The cultivation cycle of shiitake mushrooms is really much shorter than other crops!\u201cMiss, what to do with these mushrooms?\u201d Xiumei asked.\u201cImmediately take it to the market and sell it.\u201d Wei Ruo said, \u201cThen let Uncle Xu and the others follow the standard of the first cave I found, find a few more caves like this around that area, and expand the scale of planting.\u201d\u201cMiss, shiitake mushrooms are not a staple food, and they are not easy to preserve. If there are too many mushrooms, we will throw them at our hands if they cannot be sold.\u201d Xiumei worried.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I don\u2019t plan to sell all of them after the scale is expanded. We use the shiitake mushrooms that cannot be sold to make dried shiitake mushrooms and make shiitake mushroom sauce. These can greatly extend the preservation time of shiitake mushrooms.\u201d Wei Wei If there is a countermeasure already.\u201cDried mushrooms and mushroom sauce? I haven\u2019t tried them yet, so I\u2019m looking forward to them!\u201d Xiumei was eager to try.\u201cWait until it\u2019s done, I\u2019ll give you a taste first!\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how many times, as long as the lady can grow more crops and earn more money!\u201dWei Ruozheng and Xiumei were chatting happily about the shiitake mushrooms, and someone from the front yard came to inform that Miss Xie\u2019s family had brought Wei Ruo a gift and was waiting for Wei Ruo to sign for it in person.Before he left, he specifically said that Miss Xie Jia sent a lot of things, and asked Wei Ruoduo to take someone with him.Xie Ying made it a point to call Wei Ruo back several times, so Wei Ruo wasn\u2019t very surprised when she heard this.I just don\u2019t know what gift Xie Ying prepared for her.When Wei Ruo came to the front yard, many people were already standing in the front yard, even Yunshi and Wei Qingwan came.\u201cMiss Wei.\u201d An honest-looking old man came up and said to Wei Ruo with a smile on his face, \u201cI am the housekeeper of the Xie Mansion. I am here to give the miss a gift by order of my young master and miss.\u201dWei Ruo looked at a carriage pulling goods behind the butler of the Xie Mansion, and asked, \u201cAll these?\u201d(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This satin is only available in the Xiaowei Mansion today, and it is all old clothes made in the past.With the decline of Zhongyibo Mansion, there has been no cloud brocade material in the mansion for many years, and no more clothes made of this material have been made.There are also a lot of decorations and medicinal materials, which are not common and cheap things.Mr. Yun hurriedly said to the housekeeper of Xie\u2019s residence: \u201cHousekeeper Xie, this gift from Mr. Xie and Miss Xie is a bit too expensive, isn\u2019t it?\u201dThe housekeeper smiled and said: \u201cNot much, not much, Miss Wei is very kind to my young master and wife, these gifts are nothing.\u201dThe recipe that Wei Ruo gave to Xie Ying, Xie Ying cooked for Mrs. Xie. Mrs. Xie was not only moved by her daughter\u2019s act of picking and decocting the medicine, but also the medicine was really useful to her.Although Mrs. Xie was not seriously ill, but as a woman, she was suffering from physical weakness and anemia. After taking the medicine, Mrs. Xie\u2019s night sweats, nightmares and lack of deep sleep improved greatly, and her energy and spirit also improved. few.Just for this point, Xie Jiabei\u2019s gift in return is not too generous.Wei Qingwan didn\u2019t see the contents of the gift list, but she could guess from Yun\u2019s reaction that the gift must be very expensive.The Xie family gave out a whole carload of precious gifts just like that.And Wei Ruo can have such an opportunity, and it is all because she and Xie Ying became classmates and became familiar with each other day by day.If she was the one who went to study at Xie\u2019s house, then now\u2026Wei Ruo also felt that this gift in return was a bit too expensive, but the Xie family had already delivered the gift to the door, so there was no reason for anyone to send it back.\u201cPlease thank the housekeeper for telling your young master and miss for me, I have received their gifts, I like them very much, next time I will treat them to tea.\u201d Wei Ruo said.\u201cOkay, I will convey to Miss Young Master what Miss Wei said verbatim.\u201d The housekeeper said with a smile.Then Wei Ruo told Xiumei: \u201cMeimei, move everything to my yard.\u201d\u201cGood lady!\u201d Xiumei stepped forward to move.\u201cSister, may I ask Cui He to move it for you?\u201d Wei Qingwan stepped forward and said softly.\u201cNo need, your maid is not as strong as my Meimei, and this box is heavy, so it won\u2019t work if you\u2019re tired.\u201d Wei Ruo declined.Wei Qingwan originally wanted to refute, but after seeing Xiumei, a woman, lifting a huge wooden box, she could only swallow all her rebuttals.Seeing this, Yun ordered the guard Jing Hu to help.Jinghu is strong and strong, one is worth two.Jinghu and Xiumei moved very quickly, and moved all the things in the car back to Tingsongyuan after a few round trips.After everything in the car was emptied, the housekeeper of Xie\u2019s house bid farewell to the Wei family, and took the empty car back to Xie\u2019s house.Wei Ruo walked back, and when he passed Yun\u2019s side, he said, \u201cMother, I still have some things to do, so I\u2019ll go back to Songyuan first.\u201dYunshi looked at Wei Ruo, wanted to say something, but chose not to say anything, and finally nodded: \u201cWell, go back.\u201dAfter Wei Ruo left, Yun saw Wei Qingwan lowering her head, her expression was not very good.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with Wanwan?\u201d Yun Shi approached and asked with concern.Wei Qingwan bit her lip and shook her head.\u201cWanwan, if you have something to tell your mother, don\u2019t hold it back. If it breaks, your mother will feel distressed. Is there something that makes you unhappy?\u201d Yun said.\u201cMother, I\u2019m really fine. My sister and Miss Xie\u2019s family get along very well. I\u2019m very happy for my sister. It\u2019s impossible for me to be unhappy.\u201d Wei Qingwan replied.\u201cWell, mother knows that you must be happy too. Ruo\u2019er has really adjusted well these days. Not only does she behave in a graceful manner, but she also makes friends of the same age.\u201d Yun said.\u201cWell, my sister is really amazing. I was just thinking about going to Fucheng with my mother to attend the magistrate\u2019s wife\u2019s garden party in a few days, and I didn\u2019t come back to my senses for a while.\u201d Wei Qingwan explained.Wei Mingting won the battle this time, not only because of his promotion, but also for the embarrassment of the captain\u2019s house. The prefect\u2019s wife\u2019s garden party has been held in the past few years, but in the past, Wei\u2019s family who lived far away in Xingshan County was not invited.After receiving the invitation letter from Fucheng, the Yun family began to prepare.She plans to take her two daughters with her. Wei Ruo is busy there, and she doesn\u2019t spend much time with her on weekdays, so she hasn\u2019t told Wei Ruo yet, but Wei Qingwan often comes to Cangyun Garden to help her with family affairs, so she just Talk to Wei Qingwan first, so that she can be mentally prepared.\u201cIs Wanwan worried about her poor performance?\u201d Yun asked.Wei Qingwan nodded lightly: \u201cYeah, I haven\u2019t met the lady in Fucheng yet, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m not polite enough, and I\u2019ll make a joke.\u201d\u201cWanwan doesn\u2019t need to think too much, with Wanwan, your knowledge and cultivation will definitely not be a problem.\u201d Yun comforted.Wei Qingwan hung her head and did not answer.Yun said again: \u201cBut you reminded me that you are going to Fucheng, and you should prepare some more decent clothes for you.\u201dHearing Yun\u2019s words, Wei Qingwan couldn\u2019t help being overjoyed.Thinking about this, Yun turned around and walked to the mansion, before telling Wei Qingwan: \u201cWanwan go back to rest earlier, it\u2019s rare to rest, don\u2019t be tired.\u201dMr. Yun came to Tingsongyuan, where Wei Ruo was packing up the things sent by Xie\u2019s family.Xiumei was walking into the house with those pieces of cloud brocade in her arms. Wei Ruo was checking the items according to the gift list, sorting the items into categories, and storing them in her warehouse according to the categories. Some of them were expensive, and she would put them in her later in the space.There are also those medicinal materials, which are not easy to buy in Xingshan County. With these, she can prepare more medicines.After tidying up these things, Wei Ruo planned to use these medicines to prepare some things, except for keeping them by himself, and preparing them for Xu Zhengyong.Mr. Yun looked at Wei Ruo, hesitated for a while, and said, \u201cRuoer, Madam Zhifu sent us an invitation letter, inviting us to attend the garden party next month.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d Wei Ruo didn\u2019t raise his head, his gaze was still on the box in front of him.\u201cMother wants to make you some nicer clothes, and then wear them to the garden party.\u201d Yun said.Wei Ruo paused for a moment, Yun said \u201cyou\u201d, so Wei Qingwan must be included.(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It\u2019s the first time since I came back home that my mother wants to make clothes for me. What kind of clothes are you going to make this time? It\u2019s going to be winter soon, so the clothes should be thicker, right?\u201dWei Ruo asked several questions one after another, Yun looked into her clear and bright eyes, and was a little at a loss for what she was about to say.Wei Ruo continued: \u201cWhen I first returned home, although those clothes were new, they should have been made according to the figure of Qingwan sister. Presumably my mother didn\u2019t know my height, so she could only match the figure of Qingwan sister. I need to measure it. This time I will make clothes, so I have to ask the master to measure it for me.\u201dHearing this, Mrs. Yun couldn\u2019t help feeling a little ashamed. At that time, she really didn\u2019t know the stature of her biological daughter who was far away in Huzhou Prefecture, and it was difficult to judge the clothes, so she took the new clothes that she made for Wanwan years ago and hadn\u2019t worn them yet. I went to Tingsongyuan and prepared it for Ruo\u2019er.But later, seeing that Ruo\u2019er was wearing those clothes gracefully, gracefully, gracefully and gracefully, and there was hardly any incongruity that could be seen, so she didn\u2019t think there was any problem.In the past, the mansion would make clothes twice a year, but in the middle of this year, there was a war, and she had to worry about her husband who was on the front line and was busy with family affairs.After all the calculations, Ruoer has not made clothes according to her stature since she returned home.Yun said with a guilty tone: \u201cThat\u2019s what it should be, and it will definitely be measured.\u201dThen when Yun looked at the brocade in front of Wei Ruo, he hesitated.But after thinking about it for a while, I decided to say: \u201cRuo\u2019er, the material of these two pieces of cloud brocade is very good, why don\u2019t you use this material to make new clothes for you? The material is expensive and the color is beautiful. You wear this Clothes made of material are more decent when you go to Fucheng. Mother will make up for you when there is good material in the house.\u201d\u201cWhat does mother mean, if Miss Xie\u2019s family didn\u2019t happen to send me these cloud brocades, our Captain\u2019s Mansion won\u2019t be able to go to Fucheng to participate in the garden party next month?\u201d Wei Ruo asked.\u201cBeing a mother doesn\u2019t mean that. It\u2019s okay if you don\u2019t have one, but if you happen to have one, then it\u2019s a good thing that is icing on the cake.\u201d Yun said.\u201cIf you want to use cloud brocade to make clothes, it\u2019s only for me.\u201d Wei Ruo said.Yun frowned: \u201cRuo\u2019er, you and Qingwan are sisters. Wanwan has always cared about you and thinks of you in everything. You should also show your demeanor as the elder sister. The Xie family took so many Here comes the gift, mother doesn\u2019t want anything else from you, just these two pieces of cloud brocade with different patterns, you two sisters make a whole. And this is what mother borrowed from you, when you get good material, you will definitely return it.\u201dThe smile on Wei Ruo\u2019s face didn\u2019t fade, and he explained unhurriedly: \u201cMother doesn\u2019t know, the reason why Miss Xie\u2019s family chose to give me two bolts of cloud brocade satin is because of the comparison between the material of the clothes I usually wear and hers. It\u2019s a lot worse, and the clothes don\u2019t fit very well, so she gave them specially, so she must hope that I can wear the clothes she gave me, right?\u201dHearing this, Yun\u2019s heart tightened.Wei Ruo continued: \u201cThis piece of cloud brocade is too much to make one suit, but it is not enough to make two suits. The materials of these two styles were all chosen by Yingying herself, so she must want to see my clothes. Wear both.\u201dAfter Wei Ruo said this, Yun couldn\u2019t continue to ask for Yun brocade and satin to make clothes for Wei Qingwan. In addition, Wei Ruo said that the mansion hadn\u2019t tailored clothes for Wei Ruo alone, so Yun couldn\u2019t help but Feeling guilty, she completely gave up the idea of using cloud brocade to make Wei Qingwan a new set of clothes.But Yun immediately thought that if Ruoer made the new clothes of Yun brocade and Wanwan didn\u2019t, Wanwan would be sad.So he looked at the things in front of Wei Ruo, and after thinking about it, he said: \u201cIf the cloud brocade is not good enough, Ruo\u2019er picks some things that you don\u2019t need for Wanwan, so it should be used to appease Wanwan. When you go to Fucheng, the two of you will wear If there is a difference, it is inevitable that she will feel bad.\u201dWei Ruo still had a faint smile on his face:\u201cMother doesn\u2019t know something. Now that I am on good terms with Miss Xie\u2019s family, if she gives me a gift, I can\u2019t let her take it lightly. I will definitely return the gift later. Otherwise, I just accept the other party\u2019s gift but don\u2019t know how to return it. When the time comes It\u2019s not just my own face that\u2019s lost, but also the face of the whole school captain\u2019s mansion. Could it be that mother wants to hear outsiders say that my Wei family doesn\u2019t know how to behave, and only wants to benefit from other people\u2019s family?\u201d\u201cEven if outsiders don\u2019t gossip, if I always reach out to take the benefits from Xie\u2019s family, but don\u2019t know how to appreciate them in return, then sooner or later I will be looked down upon by Xie\u2019s family. How can they befriend me? Mother said, right? ?\u201dYun\u2019s dumbfounded.Wei Ruo continued: \u201cIt must cost money to give a gift, and it needs to be a lot. It can\u2019t be much lighter than what the Xie family gave me. But my monthly money is so much, it is difficult to get enough money Those who returned gifts to the Xie family, some of the gifts I received, some I don\u2019t need, and the common ones are not easy to be recognized. I will pick them out another day, sell the ones that can be resold, and exchange them for silver to return the gift to Miss Xie\u2019s family. .\u201dXiumei moved her things in and came back when she heard her young lady opening her eyes and talking nonsense.How could it be possible for Miss to sell the gifts that others gave her? If there is no money, Miss must find other ways to earn money.Yun said: \u201cBut this method of selling gifts from others in exchange for money is not very good. If people find out, they will be laughed at.\u201dWei Ruo: \u201cThen where does mother think my money will come from?\u201dYun Shi was dumb again.Wei Ruodao: \u201cI also hope that my mother will understand my difficulties. I have just returned to the residence not long ago. I don\u2019t have any foundation, and I don\u2019t have any savings. When I communicate with other ladies, I will inevitably have to give some things, and I need some personal savings. \u201cAfter Wei Ruo said this, Yun felt quite uncomfortable. Ruo\u2019er has only been back home for a few months, these things are really difficult for her, it is not easy for her to do what she is doing now.The situation of the daughter is difficult, and the Captain\u2019s Mansion is also in a state of lack of money, and there is no way to give out too much money for the daughter to let the daughter buy things like Miss Xie\u2019s family.\u201cMy mother knows about it, so I will treat it as if my mother never said anything about it. You should handle these gifts yourself,\u201d Yun said.After finishing speaking, he thought of something else, and after thinking about it for a while, he said, \u201cSpeaking of which, if you are the eldest daughter in your family, your monthly payment should go up.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not good, if my monthly payment is increased, what will Sister Qingwan do?\u201d Wei Ruo asked.Wei Ruo: Defeat magic with magic(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Wanwan is a sensible child, and she won\u2019t have any objections when she finds out about it.\u201d Yun Shi road.Yun firmly believed that with Wei Qingwan\u2019s heart, she would not care about such things.\u201cThat\u2019s right, Sister Qingwan is so kind, she really wouldn\u2019t be sad about such a thing.\u201d Wei Ruo said with a smile.\u201cYeah.\u201d Yun Shi nodded, \u201cThen you should be busy first, and mother will go back to Cangyun Garden first.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Wei Ruo smiled and sent Yun away.After Mrs. Yun left, Xiumei couldn\u2019t help laughing: \u201cMiss, I find that your nonsense is getting better and better now!\u201dWei Ruo sighed and said, \u201cIs there anything I can do? It\u2019s not because I was forced out. Ever since I became the eldest lady of the captain\u2019s mansion, if I want to reason with people, I can\u2019t think as much as I used to. .\u201d\u201cIf I just say that I don\u2019t like Wei Qingwan, and I don\u2019t want to give Wei Qingwan my things, I will definitely be scolded. It doesn\u2019t mean that I don\u2019t care about sisterhood, or that I don\u2019t have the demeanor of a elder sister.\u201d\u201cBut as long as I talk about things with etiquette and face, I can convince others to be convincing. Although Yingying made up a lot of words, I think she should also support me in doing so, otherwise she will arrange today The housekeeper will not specifically ask me to check it in person when he gives me a gift.\u201dWhy Xie Ying saw that her clothes didn\u2019t fit well, and Wei Ruo made up the words that her clothes were poorly made.The purpose is to use these reasons to prevaricate Yun\u2019s, so that Yun can\u2019t continue to ask her for things.\u201cBut Miss, what if Mrs. Cai was not persuaded by you and insisted on taking your things to Second Miss?\u201d Xiumei asked.\u201cThen I\u2019ll burn the things with a torch, and no one wants it. Don\u2019t try to force me to give things to people I don\u2019t like!\u201d Wei Ruo replied.Xiu Mei burst out laughing with a \u201cpuchi\u201d, and then asked: \u201cMiss, do we still have to prepare a return gift for Xie\u2019s family?\u201d\u201cNot for the time being, their gifts are expensive, and the prescription I gave you, Miss Ni, is not an ordinary thing. They didn\u2019t suffer too much. Besides, they are just returning the gift. I will return it again. It\u2019s nothing. Keep it in mind , Thinking of people\u2019s kindness, it is more important to treat sisters with sincerity, and they will come forward when they need it, and they don\u2019t have to remember the gains and losses.\u201d Wei Ruo said.\u201cWell, Miss is right.\u201d###After leaving Tingsongyuan, Mrs. Yun explained to Wei Ruo the monthly money increase, and invited people from Jinyifang to the mansion to measure Wei Ruo\u2019s size and prepare to make new clothes.The news quickly spread to Wangmeiyuan.Wei Qingwan\u2019s face paled for a while.Mother not only did not ask Wei Ruo to take out the brocade brocade to make new clothes for her, but instead raised Wei Ruo\u2019s monthly payment. What is going on?If Wei Ruo did not agree to take out the brocade brocade to make new clothes for her, her mother would probably blame Wei Ruo for being ignorant. Why not only did she not blame her but also rewarded her?\u201cMammy, what do you think is going on here? Why did my mother suddenly increase my sister\u2019s monthly payment? Is it because she is on good terms with Miss Xie\u2019s family?\u201d Wei Qingwan asked Li Nanny.Nurse Li doesn\u2019t know the answer to this question either. After the incident last time, Madam and her have been estranged a lot, and she has to ask Nanny Zhang to handle any important matters.\u201cI really underestimated Wei Qingruo, now it seems that she does have some skills.\u201d Nanny Li gritted her teeth.Deliberately going to the gate of Wei Qingruo\u2019s courtyard to kowtow and apologize didn\u2019t work. Later, she specially asked the lady to give Wei Qingruo the purse that Wei Qingruo confiscated. This Wei Qingruo is much more difficult than she originally thought!\u201cGrandma, what should I do in the future? Will my mother send me back to the He family after a while? Mammy, I don\u2019t want to go to the He family. The He family is just a family of merchants with a low status. Being treated well by others, even if you have money, you can\u2019t use many things.\u201d Wei Qingwan asked worriedly.Nanny Li looked at Wei Qingwan like this, feeling distressed and worried.She knows that the fate of herself and her daughter is bound to that of Wei Qingwan. If Wei Qingwan is really sent to the He family, then her daughter will also go to the He family. Maybe we won\u2019t see each other for the rest of my life.\u201cMiss, don\u2019t worry, these things are nothing serious at the moment. Even if the eldest lady has the ability to please the madam, the madam will still love you a lot.\u201d Madam Li comforted Wei Qingwan.\u201cNurse, I can\u2019t do anything but worry.\u201d Wei Qingwan murmured.\u201cMiss, don\u2019t worry, everything will be fine. Wait for the garden party next month. Miss will go to Fucheng. Broaden your horizons and make more friends. There are people there who are much more prominent than the Xie family.\u201dNurse Li\u2019s words did not comfort Wei Qingwan, how could the prominent families in the prefecture look up to her easily, even if they did, they would not treat her like the Xie family treated Wei Qingruo.The behavior of the Xie family is really rare, and they don\u2019t know where Wei Qingruo caught their eyes.###August 15th is the holiday around the Mid-Autumn Festival, Wei Ruo and Wei Qingwan are both on leave, so they don\u2019t have to go to class.Wei Ruo is staying at home, busy with shiitake mushrooms, and has just tripled the scale. There are more materials to purchase and more books to look at.At the same time, the production of dried shiitake mushrooms and shiitake mushroom sauce has to be arranged. Shiitake mushrooms can\u2019t last for too long after being picked, so they have to be processed as early as possible, so she needs to make arrangements for follow-up work before a large number of shiitake mushrooms mature.Xiumei is helping Wei Ruo chop mushrooms in the yard, and they will take them to the small kitchen next door to cook later.Although Wei Jinyi and Xiaobei were not at home, before leaving, Wei Jinyi said that the courtyard door was open, and Wei could go in and use the small kitchen if necessary.At noon, the boy in charge of taking care of Wei Yilin went to Wangmeiyuan to inquire because he couldn\u2019t find Wei Yilin.\u201cYilin?\u201d Wei Qingwan heard the voice and walked to the door, interrupting the conversation between the boy and the maid, \u201cYilin hasn\u2019t been here today, what happened? He\u2019s not in his yard?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal, it\u2019s just that it\u2019s almost dinner time, and the young master is not in Yuyu Garden. Since the second lady doesn\u2019t have it here, I\u2019ll look for it elsewhere.\u201dAfter the boy explained to Wei Qingwan, he hurried to the next place to look for Wei Yilin.Wei Qingwan sensed something was wrong, \u201cCui He, let\u2019s look for it too.\u201dThe boy went to Aoju Garden to ask Wei Yichen again, but Wei Yichen was not there either.Knowing that Wei Yilin was missing, Wei Yichen immediately put down the books in his hand, got up and searched together with Wei Yilin\u2019s servant.(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 92": "Chapter 92 - erroneouslyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 92Wei Mansion was searched all over, even Tingsong Garden and Yingzhu Garden, where Wei Yilin was unlikely to go, were searched, but there was no sign of Wei Yilin.It was confirmed that Wei Yilin was no longer in the house, and Wei Yichen and Wei Qingwan quickly reported the matter to the Yun family.Yun\u2019s family immediately dispatched all the people in the mansion to look for it.Listening to Songyuan, Wei Ruo sent him away to ask if anyone had seen Wei Yilin before lazily lying back on the bed.It\u2019s a rare rest time, let\u2019s take a nap, taking a nap is a very happy thing.\u201cMiss, do you want to go out and help find it too? The people from Wangmeiyuan have already gone out, running up and down, very busy.\u201d Xiumei frowned and asked with some worry.\u201cIt\u2019s not bad for so many people to go out. Besides, I don\u2019t like that stinky boy Wei Yilin, and he doesn\u2019t like me either. I guess he doesn\u2019t want to be found by my nominal eldest sister.\u201d Wei Ruoshen A big lazy waist.\u201cMiss, I\u2019m just worried that if something really happens to the young master, when Madam asks later, I know that you, miss, have nothing to do with sleeping in at home, and you will be blamed again\u2026\u201d Xiumei lowered her head and murmured.Hearing that Wei Ruo opened his eyes, he became more conscious.What Xiumei said was correct, and she might not only be punished by the Yun family at that time, but if someone added embellishments and said that she, the elder sister, was indifferent to the younger brother in the family, and didn\u2019t care if everyone got lost I don\u2019t know how to be criticized for a while.After a while, Wei Ruo turned over and propped up his upper body.\u201cPut on clothes and put on clothes, your lady, I\u2019m just a hard worker, I can\u2019t rest!\u201dWei Ruo resigned himself to getting up and getting dressed, then took Xiumei out of the car.The servants in the family went out to search all in a carpet-like search. Except for Wei Qingwan who used a carriage, the rest went out on foot, so the carriage that Wei Ruo used to ride in was still there.Although he went out, Wei Ruo had no direction to speak of. Wei Shuojian went to the south of the city. Even if he couldn\u2019t find anyone, he could still take a look at the situation in the south of the city.Going out to the south of the city, Wei Ruo got off the car and walked around.Xiumei is helpless, Miss is checking the progress of land reclamation in the south of the city under the guise of looking for someone.Wei Ruo watched as he walked, and found that the people who opened up wasteland were poor people without land. What Wei Ruo saw along the way were either emaciated old people or children with yellow and emaciated faces.They are all waiting for the crops to grow on this land, and when they look at their newly reclaimed land, there is light in their eyes.There was a little boy with a thin body and sallow skin, wearing thin and worn clothes, nestled in his grandfather\u2019s arms, when Wei Ruo passed by, his eyes looked at Wei Ruo, full of novelty.Then his grandfather hurriedly hugged him tighter, and whispered: \u201cDon\u2019t be naughty, this is the official lady.\u201dObviously the child\u2019s grandfather was very afraid that the child would offend Wei Ruo because he was ignorant. They could tell the difference between Wei Ruo and their identities from Wei Ruo\u2019s clothes.The little boy was so frightened that he immediately looked away, not daring to look directly at Wei Ruo again.Wei Ruo stopped and turned to Xiumei, \u201cMeimei, I\u2019m a little hungry, do you have anything to eat?\u201dHow can Xiumei know that her lady is not hungry, but wants to get some food for these old people and children.\u201cIt\u2019s in the car, I\u2019ll go back and get it.\u201d Xiumei said.\u201cWell, bring some more\u2026 No, bring everything in the car.\u201d Wei Ruo said.\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll take them all and leave one for the lady. If you don\u2019t have any more, you can distribute them to the elderly and children around here? They all look pitiful.\u201d Xiumei said.Let her help to say what her lady didn\u2019t say, the provincial lady is embarrassed to say this.\u201cWell, let\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cokay!\u201dXiumei turned around and ran back to their carriage parked on the official road.Xiumei took out a bag of dried sweet potatoes from the car. As soon as she got out of the car, she saw a large number of people from Xiaowei\u2019s Mansion.Xiumei was very surprised, so she grabbed Madam Zhang, whom she was familiar with, to ask about the situation.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with Nanny Zhang? Isn\u2019t everyone looking for the young master? Why have you all come to the south of the city?\u201dNanny Zhang looked anxious: \u201cMiss Xiumei, you and the eldest miss really have the foresight! The young master must have sneaked to the south of the city! Early this morning, two servants at home were driving a bullock cart. A load of straw came to the south of the city. The young master probably escaped from the ox cart at that time! The guards who were looking for someone found the young master\u2019s accessories on the ox cart.\u201dDidn\u2019t expect Miss to come to the south of the city, but it\u2019s the right thing to do?Xiumei opened her mouth, not knowing what to say for a while.At this time, Nanny Zhang said again: \u201cI don\u2019t know how the young master is doing now, but I heard people say that there are still remnants of Japanese pirates in the nearby mountains recently. Young master, a child is very dangerous.\u201d\u201cWhat? There are remnants of Japanese pirates nearby? How come? Didn\u2019t the Japanese pirates be repelled after the last battle?\u201d Xiumei became nervous all of a sudden.\u201cYes, most of them were beaten to death, but a few Japanese pirates escaped and hid in the area of Wangyue Mountain. I heard that they are very tenacious. They live by eating grass roots and bark, and occasionally steal food from the people who are opening up wasteland in the south of the city. , It was when the people saw it while stealing things, and they just reported it to the government this morning, and the government has not yet sent anyone to deal with it.\u201d Zhang Nanny explained.Immediately afterwards, thinking that Wei Ruo was still walking outside, Xiumei was a little worried, so she ignored the task that Wei Ruo gave, and quickly ran to the place where she was separated from Wei Ruo just now.While waiting for Xiumei to come back, Wei Ruo was not idle, walking along the newly reclaimed ridge and observing.The land nearby has undergone great changes. The original weeds have disappeared, and the land has been divided into pieces, flat and square, with clear boundaries.The progress of reclamation and improvement in most areas is very good, and it is estimated that you can try planting in the second half of this month.Wei Ruo continued to walk towards the mountain. She planned to visit the medicine field that she and the Xie family ran together.The terrain near the mountain has become more complicated, and the population is much sparser. From a distance, three or two people can be seen opening up wasteland.These places were bought by some wealthy people in the county. However, there are very few people who buy these places for reclamation, so they are sparse, and only a few people can be seen from a long distance.Wei Ruo continued walking, bypassing a large rock, and two small adult men appeared in front of him.Two men covered their heads with turbans and wore ordinary people\u2019s clothes. There was a boy between them. The boy had a familiar face to Wei Ruo\u2026Wei Yilin!The little ancestor that the whole Wei family was looking for appeared in front of her so suddenly?(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 93": "Chapter 93 - you are totally stupidPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 93 You Are Completely StupidThe moment Wei Ruo saw the three of them, the two men and Wei Yilin also saw Wei Ruo.Wei Ruo quickly regained his composure, and turned his eyes indifferently to other places, pretending not to know Wei Yilin.She pretended to be a passerby, not recognizing Wei Yilin nor the two people beside Wei Yilin as kidnappers, and walked to the side as if nothing had happened.The two men looked at Wei Ruo vigilantly, seeing that Wei Ruo\u2019s expression was the same and he didn\u2019t recognize them, they gradually relaxed.As long as they are not discovered, they will adhere to the principle that more things are worse than less things, and they will not do anything to passers-by.Wei Ruo turned around naturally, turned around, and started walking back.At the same time, Wei Ruo said silently in his heart, little ancestor, don\u2019t make a sound, don\u2019t call me, pretend you didn\u2019t see me! Don\u2019t make a sound, I\u2019ll go back and find someone to save you! If you make a sound, we\u2019re all done!Wei Yilin saw that Wei Ruo clearly saw him, but turned his head and walked away. Wei Yilin, who had never called Wei Ruo \u201cbig sister\u201d in all sincerity, shouted loudly: \u201cBig sister!\u201dWei Ruo\u2019s body froze, and his whole body was completely cold.While cursing Wei Yilin\u2019s prodigal **** in his heart! While running quickly.But within two steps, he was caught by one of the men.\u201cDon\u2019t be rough, don\u2019t be rough, I\u2019ll go by myself!\u201d Wei Ruosheng was afraid that the other party would be cruel to him, so he hurriedly begged for mercy.This place is desolate and open, and the probability of someone coming to rescue her immediately after she calls for help is very slim, and if no one can come to rescue her in time, her uncooperative behavior will result in violence from the other party, and she may even die on the spot.If Wei Ruo wanted to survive, and if he could suffer less flesh and blood, he would be captured very cooperatively.Wei Ruo was taken to Wei Yilin\u2019s side by men, and they tied them up together.Then the two men communicated in a language that Wei Yilin could not understand.Wei Ruo roughly knew that the two men spoke the language of the Japanese country. In fact, when he saw the two men for the first time, Wei Ruo guessed their identities as Japanese pirates.Although the two used turbans to cover their Japanese pirates\u2019 unique hairstyles, their figures and appearances were far from those of the yellow and emaciated ordinary people who were opening up wasteland in the south of the city.After a brief discussion, the two Japanese escorted Wei Ruo and Wei Yilin up the mountain.The two Japanese pirates found a cave, which was only one or two meters deep and more than one meter high, which could barely accommodate two adults.Then Wei Ruo and Wei Yilin were thrown in like objects.After being locked in the cave, Wei Ruo looked at Wei Yilin who was facing him, and smiled, \u201cThat\u2019s all right, let\u2019s die together.\u201d\u201cWho made you so cold-blooded and ruthless? Seeing that I was dying, I turned around and wanted to leave.\u201d Wei Yilin didn\u2019t feel that there was anything wrong with him, and even felt a little happy.Hearing this, Wei Ruo smiled.\u201cWhat are you laughing at?\u201d Wei Yilin dissatisfied, what time is it, why is she still in the mood to laugh?\u201cI thought you were just a little stupid, but now you\u2019re totally stupid.\u201d\u201cWho are you calling stupid?\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you stupid? In that situation, how could I rescue you from two Japanese pirates with high martial arts? Am I a god? I pretended not to know you, and the two of them thought I was fine when they saw that I was fine. I don\u2019t know if they are kidnappers, they will let me go. After I leave, I can call rescuers to save you. Do you think I have a better chance of saving you by myself or call the Wei family\u2019s guards and government officials? Is there a high chance of success in saving you together?\u201dWei Yilin was dumbfounded by Wei Ruo\u2019s question.At that time, he really thought that Wei Ruo was ruthless and ungrateful and would leave. If it were Sister Wanwan, she would definitely not be like this, but he never thought about the way Wei Ruo said to deal with the problem.But if you think about it carefully, Wei Ruo\u2019s approach is actually more useful, because neither Wei Ruo nor his sister Wanwan can save themselves from the two ruthless Japanese pirates. Under such circumstances, it is definitely more useful to move rescuers.Wei Yilin realized that he was reckless, but facing Wei Ruo, he refused to admit his mistake:\u201cSo what? Who knows if you will really find someone to save me after you leave? Now we are all arrested, and we are going to die together! When I die, you can be buried with me, and it is also for my sister Wanwan Revenge!\u201d\u201cOh, Wei Yilin, you can die if you want, I won\u2019t die.\u201d Wei Ruo sneered.\u201cJust brag, these two people are not from Xingshan County at all, they are Japanese pirates, they kill without blinking an eye! You will have the ability to survive from their hands? I don\u2019t believe it!\u201d Wei Yilin mocked.Wei Ruo hooked the corners of his mouth, and didn\u2019t say anything more to Wei Yilin.She leaned her back against the stone wall of the cave and took a short rest.She has roughly grasped the current situation. The two Japanese pirates outside were probably survivors of the war.As for Wei Yilin, he probably ran to the south of the city because of something wrong, and happened to be caught by two Japanese pirates in disguise, and took them as hostages, just in case they would be useful if someone found out.What she has to do now is to find a way to delay the time and fight for the chance of survival for herself, because if there is a trouble, they will definitely choose Wei Yilin, who is relatively easy to take, as a hostage instead of her.Moreover, these Japanese pirates act viciously. She is a thirteen-year-old girl, who knows what they will do to her, and it would be good to just give her a happy one.Hearing a pirate coming in, Wei Ruo opened his eyes.Wei Ruo said immediately: \u201cTwo warriors of the Yamato nation, I have a way for you to make up for your mistakes.\u201dWei Ruo heard some Chinese words from the conversation between the two Japanese pirates just now, and guessed that the two have learned some Chinese after they have been on the East Coast for a long time.Wei Ruo\u2019s words stunned Wei Yilin, and then showed a look of contempt. Does she know what she is talking about? She told the two Japanese pirates that she could help them make up for their mistakes?But the Japanese pirate in front of him stopped, and asked Wei Ruo in Chinese with a not-so-standard pronunciation: \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cYou were defeated. Although a few people survived by chance, neither died nor were captured, but according to the habits of your Yamato people, you who died in battle should commit seppuku and apologize to your emperor.\u201d Wei Ruo didn\u2019t worry Analyzing without delay.\u201cYou know, us?\u201d The Japanese pirate showed a very surprised expression.Wei Yilin was also stunned, staring at Wei Ruo suspiciously: How did Wei Qingruo know so much?\u201cI know a little bit.\u201d Wei Ruo replied, \u201cI just said that I can help you make up for your mistakes. Do you know what the idiom \u201cmake up for your mistakes?\u201d(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 94": "Chapter 94 - Hostages are also differentPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 94 Hostages Are DifferentThe Japanese pirates looked at Wei Ruo with a surprised expression, and it seemed that they were seriously thinking about the feasibility of Wei Ruo\u2019s words.After thinking for a while, the Japanese pirate continued to ask in broken Chinese: \u201cWhat can you do?\u201d\u201cI am a person who is proficient in agriculture. I have a lot of agricultural technologies that can change the nature of the land and increase food production.\u201dWei Ruo knew the situation of the Wa country, it was an island country with extremely poor land resources, the agriculture was very underdeveloped, and the cultivated land was very limited.I also know some customs of the Wa country, and know how to hit their pain points.\u201cCan you grow more, food?\u201d\u201cYes, I can find ways to grow more food, whether it is barren land, coastal saline land or steep mountains. Once successful, more people in your country will be fed.\u201dIn this case, Wei Ruo\u2019s paintings are mostly made up of big cakes, and the improvement that can be done on the land is still limited. In some places, the cost of improvement or follow-up maintenance costs are really high, and there is no value for improvement.\u201cHow do I know that you are not lying?\u201d the pirate asked.\u201cThe method of improving the land in the south of the city that you saw was my idea. You have been wandering on the east coast for a long time. You should know that this place used to be barren. I can improve this place and help you Wa Kingdom The improvement was successful.\u201d Wei Ruo replied.\u201cWei Qingruo, what are you doing? Why are you telling these two Japanese pirates? Are you going to help them grow food so that they can eat and drink enough to beat us? They are Japanese pirates, robbers, **** who kill without blinking an eye !\u201d Wei Yilin scolded.Wei Ruobai glanced at Wei Yilin, could she not know what he said? She also hates and hates these Japanese pirates, but she has to see what their situation is now, right?It is not too late for a gentleman to take revenge for ten years! She had to save her own life before she could think of a way to deal with these people.If the life is gone, the rest is all nonsense.Now that the Wei family is looking for someone across the city, and Meimei is nearby, she still has a chance to escape.And what she needs to do is to keep her body safe from harm as much as possible before they find her.Wei Ruo ignored Wei Yilin, continued to smile and said to the Japanese pirates: \u201cDon\u2019t worry about this brat, he\u2019s not clear about his mind.\u201d\u201cHe said he was Captain Wei\u2019s son, and he called you, sister, and you too, Captain Wei\u2019s daughter.\u201d Although the Japanese pirates are not proficient in Chinese, they still have a clear mind.\u201cYes, it\u2019s true that I\u2019m Captain Wei\u2019s daughter, but I\u2019m in your hands now, and I want to live, so I\u2019m willing to provide my value and win a mutually beneficial result for both of us. This has nothing to do with my identity Relationship.\u201d Wei Ruo said flickeringly.After listening to Wei Ruo\u2019s words, the Japanese pirate didn\u2019t answer immediately, but retreated outside the cave and discussed with another Japanese pirate.While the two pirates were mumbling and discussing something, Wei Yilin asked Wei Ruo: \u201cWei Qingruo, what do you want to do?\u201d\u201cWhat are you doing? Live, can\u2019t you see?\u201d\u201cYou are shameless for doing this!\u201d\u201cWei Yilin, do you know what is shameless and what is stupid?\u201d\u201cYou are betraying the country and countless border guards, you\u2026 you are ungrateful!\u201d Wei Yilin thought for a while before he thought of the word \u201cungrateful\u201d to scold Wei Ruo.\u201cWho did I betray? Did I kill them? But you, running around, making me unlucky to follow you, you are the one who killed me!\u201d\u201cYou!\u201d Wei Yilin was at a loss for words again.\u201cIf you have words, keep on cursing, and I\u2019ll make it a lullaby.\u201d Wei Ruo said calmly.Being **** by two Japanese pirates and locked up in a cave is quite a scary thing, and having a voice yelling at the side can ease the scary atmosphere.After a while, the pirate came back.\u201cIf, you can really do what you said, we won\u2019t hurt you.\u201d\u201cNo problem.\u201d Wei Ruo readily agreed.\u201cBut we will not let your brother go, and we may kill him.\u201d The pirate said.Letting Wei Yilin go is tantamount to exposing their whereabouts. They may keep Wei Yilin as a hostage. If there is any problem at that time and they cannot take it away, they will kill them for safety.\u201cI don\u2019t have a good relationship with him. He wants me to die. You think, if he had a good relationship with me, he wouldn\u2019t call me sister at that time, let you find me. If you really love someone, you want the other person to live well instead of dragging him Go into the water. So you can do whatever you want,\u201d Wei Ruo replied.Wei Yilin beside him widened his eyes in disbelief.Want to refute, but find that I can\u2019t find any words to refute.\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d The pirates naturally didn\u2019t want Wei Ruo to impose additional conditions on them.\u201cSince we have reached a consensus, you should treat me better, and don\u2019t let me be disabled by you before I go to Japan with you.\u201d Wei Ruo continued.\u201cYou, want, what?\u201d the Japanese pirate asked.\u201cYou guys loosen my ties so that I can feel more comfortable, and my hands won\u2019t have any problems due to long-term poor blood flow. Don\u2019t worry, there is no other exit from this cave, and you can guard me at the entrance so I can\u2019t get out. Yes, I don\u2019t have any martial arts, I can\u2019t beat you at all.\u201d Wei Ruo said.The Japanese pirate hesitated, looked at Wei Ruo for a while, and then thought about the scene where they captured Wei Ruo just now, but if she knew martial arts, she would not have been caught so easily by them just now. Finally nodded in agreement.The Japanese pirates tied Wei Ruosong loose.After finishing these, the two pirates returned to the cave.The two seemed to be plotting something. Although they couldn\u2019t understand what they said, Wei Ruo guessed that the two should be discussing how to escape the pursuit of the officers and soldiers of Xingshan County and escape to Japan.Wei Ruo, who was free, leaned against the stone wall with a leisurely posture.In contrast, Wei Yichen, who was opposite her, had his hands tied behind his back, and he fell crookedly on the ground, feeling very uncomfortable.Not only was his posture uncomfortable, but his psychology was even more uncomfortable. He heard what the Japanese pirate said just now. They said they would not let him go, and they would kill him directly if there was a situation.He doesn\u2019t want to die, he wants to live!Although he was righteous when he argued with Wei Ruo just now, but when the fear of death struck, he began to envy Wei Ruo again.At least those Japanese pirates said they would not kill her!Wei Yilin felt unspeakably annoyed, but facing Wei Ruo, he still didn\u2019t want to admit that his choice was not as smart as hers.Wei Ruo didn\u2019t bother Wei Yilin to see his expression, and didn\u2019t want to know what was going on in his head.She took out a small brocade bag from her bosom, took out dried sweet potatoes from it, and started to chew.Wei Ruo usually has the habit of bringing snacks for herself when she goes out, so asking Xiumei to go back to the carriage to get food just now was indeed an excuse she made, and she wanted to distribute the food to the poor people.Wei Ruo looked leisurely and enjoying the sweet dried sweet potato, Wei Yilin\u2019s eyes almost popped out.(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It\u2019s already afternoon, and he hasn\u2019t drunk a drop of water or eaten any food. .\u201cGulu~\u201dMy stomach suddenly let out a growl.Wei Yilin was angry, anxious and annoyed.Wei Ruo pretended not to hear, and continued to eat his own.Wei Yilin has never experienced this kind of hardship in his life, and the more he thinks about it, the more uncomfortable he feels.\u201cWei Qingruo!\u201d Wei Yilin shouted.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\u201cYou\u2026you\u2026\u201d Wei Yilin looked at Wei Ruo, wanted to say something but didn\u2019t say it.\u201cYou want to eat, but you\u2019re too embarrassed to ask, right?\u201d Wei Ruo, who didn\u2019t finish Wei Yilin\u2019s speech, helped him.\u201cNo!\u201d Wei Yilin immediately denied.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you think so, because I won\u2019t give someone who expects me to die the food I made carefully.\u201d\u201cYou!\u201d Wei Yilin was once again gnashing his teeth in anger from Wei Ruo.Wei Ruo smiled lightly, and continued to nibble on her sweet dried sweet potatoes leisurely.\u201cIf you don\u2019t give it, you won\u2019t give it! Who cares about it!\u201d Wei Yilin said angrily.Half an hour later\u2026\u201cGulu~Gulu~\u201dWei Yilin\u2019s stomach growled even worse. Wei Yilin, who had never been hungry before, experienced such a long period of hunger for the first time in his life.The young master\u2019s temper has been frustrated a lot.Seeing Wei Ruoxiao\u2019s carefree appearance, Wei Yilin also realized that some of what Wei Ruo said was right.People like Wei Ruo can at least live a more comfortable life before being saved.\u201cWei Qingruo, if they want to kill me, do you really plan to leave me alone?\u201d Wei Yilin asked.\u201cWhen I saw you for the first time today, I would save you, but after you yelled that \u2018big sister\u2019 that you never sincerely yelled on weekdays, I can\u2019t control your life It\u2019s gone.\u201d Wei Ruo didn\u2019t hide his true thoughts.Wei Yilin\u2019s expression froze, and a feeling of shame welled up in his heart.He looked up at Wei Ruo twice, wanted to say something, but swallowed it back.After all, if he apologizes to Wei Ruo, it will appear that he is very shameless, and this will make him feel sorry for his sister Wanwan. He has promised her sister Wanwan and only recognizes her as a sister.\u201cThen can you give me something to eat, I\u2019m hungry.\u201d Although I couldn\u2019t say the apology, but I was hungry, so I bit the bullet and asked Wei Ruo for food.\u201cNo.\u201d Wei Ruo refused without thinking.Wei Ruo pretended to give Wei Yilin a face, while paying attention to the direction of the cave entrance.After making sure that no one outside looked inside, she carefully took out a small bottle from her body and poured the medicine powder inside on top of the remaining dried sweet potatoes in her bag.Weigh the bag and mix well.Wei Ruo\u2019s little move, even Wei Yilin didn\u2019t see it, he thought that Wei Ruo was eating alone, watching him hungry.After a while, Wei Ruo shouted to the entrance of the cave: \u201cTwo good guys outside, I have something to eat here, do you want to eat?\u201d\u201cWei Qingruo, what are you doing? It\u2019s fine if you don\u2019t feed me, but you still want to feed those two crazy Japanese pirates? Are you still human?\u201d Wei Yilin scolded.\u201cWei Qingruo, did you hear that, it doesn\u2019t matter if you don\u2019t give me something to eat if you have something to eat, but you can\u2019t give it to them, they are devastated!\u201dWei Ruo ignored him, staring at the direction of the cave entrance.One of the Japanese pirates came in, and Wei Ruo offered to hand over a bag of dried sweet potatoes: \u201cThis is dried sweet potatoes, very delicious.\u201dWei Ruo still held a piece in his own hand, and took two bites as he spoke.The Japanese pirates only hesitated for a while, and then snatched away Wei Ruo\u2019s bag containing dried sweet potatoes.They are hungry, very hungry, and basically haven\u2019t eaten anything good these days.The man took Wei Ruo\u2019s bag and ran to the entrance of the cave, sharing the hard-earned food with another pirate.In the cave, Wei Yilin continued to curse Wei Ruo: \u201cWei Qingruo, are you worthy of thousands of soldiers? Are you worthy of the suffering people in Xingshan County?\u201d\u201cWei Qingruo, you have no conscience! You are a traitor! How can there be someone like you in our family! I will never admit that you are my sister in my life!\u201dWei Ruo is not in the mood to pay attention to Wei Yilin, she is now fully focused on the entrance of the cave, listening carefully with both ears outside the cave, not letting go of any sound.After a while, Wei Ruo finally heard two \u201cdong dong\u201d sounds of heavy objects reaching the bottom.Wei Ruo, who was not bound by a rope, tiptoed towards the entrance of the cave.Outside the cave, the two Japanese pirates fell to the ground after eating dried sweet potatoes mixed with drugs.Wei Ruo clenched his fists tightly, feeling lingering fear.From obedience, negotiating conditions, procrastination to asking for untiement, and offering dried sweet potatoes is for this step.The indifference to the quarrel with Wei Yilin was due to her pretending to be calm. This was the first time she encountered such a thing, and she felt a lot of fear and trepidation in her heart.Until this moment, she dared not really show fear.But now she can\u2019t relax completely, she still has something to do, she must kill these two people!What she was carrying was just drugs and not poison. If she didn\u2019t make up the knife for a while, the two of them would wake up.Wei Ruo knelt down and took off one of the Japanese pirates\u2019 sabers.The hand holding the knife trembles a little. She knows how to save people with a knife, but kills people with a knife\u2026In her mind, the only murder scene in her previous life appeared in her mind, which made her heart tremble.She is afraid, afraid of killing people.Wei Ruo said to himself: Wei Ruo, you must kill these two people today. They are Japanese pirates, thugs who plunder the lives and properties of our people. Their hands are covered with blood and human lives!What\u2019s more, if you don\u2019t kill them, once the things you were caught by them are exposed, you will only have a dead end!Regardless of whether you have been humiliated by them or not, as long as you have been kidnapped and caught, people outside will think that you have been humiliated, and there will be no way for you to survive.After some ideological struggle, Wei Ruo suddenly clenched the knife with both hands and stabbed it down, resulting in the life of a Japanese pirate.Immediately followed by the second.Blood flowed out, soaking the clothes of the two Japanese pirates.Wei Ruo is not afraid of blood on weekdays, but at this moment, looking at the blood, she clearly felt the fact that she had killed someone.Scared, but not regretful.\u201cWei Qingruo, you killed them\u2026\u201dSuddenly, Wei Yilin\u2019s shocked voice sounded from the entrance of the cave.After Wei Ruo ran out, Wei Yilin, who was tied up, wanted to know what happened outside the cave, so he didn\u2019t know where the strength came from, and squirmed like a caterpillar to the entrance of the cave.Then I witnessed the scene where Wei Ruo killed two Japanese pirates.His eyes were full of shock, and his face was full of disbelief.(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Then he cleaned up the scene and took away the remaining dried sweet potatoes and bags on the ground.Finally fled the scene staggeringly.She avoided the crowd who were looking for Wei Yilin, she couldn\u2019t let people see her in such a mess.\u201cMiss! Miss!\u201dHearing Xiumei\u2019s voice calling her, Wei Ruo was overjoyed, seeing that there was no one else around Xiumei, Wei Ruo quickly ran towards her.\u201cMeme, I\u2019m here!\u201d\u201cMiss!\u201dSeeing Wei Ruo\u2019s distressed appearance, Xiumei panicked, \u201cMiss, what\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine, you take me back to the carriage, I have to clean myself up right away. Then I tell Wei Yilin where it is, and you take someone to find him.\u201dXiumei doesn\u2019t know why Wei Ruo did this, but she has known Wei Ruo for many years and Xiumei knows that in an emergency, she must immediately follow what Wei Ruo said.With Xiumei\u2019s help, Wei Ruo managed to avoid the others and returned to the carriage.During Wei Ruo\u2019s time tidying up, Xiumei went to look for Wei Yilin according to the address Wei Ruo provided.Nurse Zhang had a sad face: \u201cIf something happens to this young master, what should we do?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay, nanny, let\u2019s keep looking, maybe we will find it.\u201d Xiumei comforted her while walking in the direction Wei Ruo gave.\u201cMommy, look over there, does it seem like someone has fallen on the ground?\u201d Xiumei pointed to a place halfway up the mountain and asked from a long distance away.\u201cWait a minute, my eyes are not very good, I can\u2019t see clearly.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t look at it, just go up and have a look!\u201d Xiumei dragged Madam Zhang up the mountain without saying a word.When she got closer, Mammy Zhang was frightened out of her wits.\u201cDead, dead!\u201d Nanny Zhang was usually in a deep house compound, and she rarely saw such a scene, and her face turned pale with fright.\u201cNurse, where is the young master!\u201d Xiumei pointed to Wei Yilin beside the corpse.\u201cHuh? Young Master? Are you okay, Young Master?\u201d Zhang Momo felt a little timid when she thought about it.Xiumei stepped forward and hugged Wei Yilin: \u201cThe young master is fine, he just passed out.\u201dThen tell Nanny Zhang to call for someone: \u201cMommy, hurry up and tell other people to come over! I\u2019ll watch here!\u201dNurse Zhang was stunned for a while before realizing: \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll go right away.\u201dNanny Zhang staggered down the hill, shouting loudly as she walked.During the time when Nanny Zhang was calling for someone, Xiumei looked around again out of caution to make sure that there was no trace of her lady.###\u201cYilin! Yilin!\u201dWei Yilin was awakened by a noise, opened his eyes, and saw Yun.Wei Yilin was hugged by Yun, and in front of him were Wei Qingwan, whose eyes were red from crying, and Wei Yichen, who looked worried.Surrounded by the guards of the Wei family who came to the south of the city to look for Wei Yilin, almost all the people in Xiaowei\u2019s mansion were present, except Wei Ruo.After being dazed for a while, Wei Yilin cried \u201cWow\u201d.\u201cMother! Mother!\u201dYun Shi hugged Wei Yilin distressedly.Wei Qingwan also surrounded her, \u201cYilin, it\u2019s great that you\u2019re fine!\u201d\u201cSister\u2026 sister\u2026\u201d Hearing Wei Qingwan\u2019s voice, Wei Yilin cried even louder.After crying for a while, Wei Yilin looked around and asked, \u201cMother, where is Wei Qingruo? Where is she?\u201d\u201cYilin wants to see big sister?\u201d Wei Qingwan asked, surprised and puzzled, why would Yilin want to see Wei Qingruo at this time?\u201cYes, where is she? Where is she?\u201d Wei Yilin asked.\u201cYilin, what\u2019s wrong with you? Why do you suddenly want to see your big sister so much?\u201d Yun was also puzzled.\u201cI saw her\u2026she\u2026\u201d Wei Yilin remembered the last scene he saw.His mind is blurred. Why did Wei Qingruo, who was greedy for life and flattering the Japanese pirates one moment, kill two Japanese pirates with his own hands the next moment?\u201cMother, where are those two pirates? Where are those two pirates?\u201d Wei Yilin asked anxiously.\u201cYilin, don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s okay, it\u2019s okay, those two pirates are dead.\u201d Yun quickly comforted.\u201cWho killed it? Have you seen it?\u201d Wei Yilin asked.He desperately wanted to confirm whether the last scene he saw was real.\u201cI don\u2019t know about this yet. When we found you, they were already dead.\u201d Yun replied.They haven\u2019t found the answer to this question yet. It seems that someone found the person first, killed the two Japanese pirates, and rescued her son.I just don\u2019t know why the other party didn\u2019t show up.\u201cIt was Wei Qingruo, it must be her, she killed the two Japanese pirates!\u201d Wei Yilin became more and more sure that what he saw was true.\u201cYilin, what are you talking about? If the eldest sister saved you, she has no reason not to tell us after saving you.\u201d Wei Qingwan said hastily.\u201cNo, she is with me\u2026\u201dWei Yilin was halfway through speaking when Wei Ruo appeared: \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with brother Yilin? Are you looking for me?\u201dWei Ruo squeezed into the crowd and appeared within Wei Yilin\u2019s sight.Wei Ruo\u2019s face is bright, only a little dirt and dust on the clothes.Walking in the fields south of the city, getting dirt and dust on your body is quite normal.Wei Yilin stared at Wei Ruo with wide eyes, with a very complicated expression.Seeing that Wei Yilin was staring at Wei Ruo, Wei Qingwan clenched her fists, and hurriedly said, \u201cYilin, you must have made a mistake, my sister came here just now, it can\u2019t be the two Japanese pirates she killed .\u201dWei Qingwan selfishly does not want Wei Ruo to be credited with saving Wei Yilin, so she specifically emphasizes that if Wei Ruo just came here, it is impossible for him to appear here.What she didn\u2019t know was that what Wei Ruo wanted was exactly such an answer. Compared with the little credit for saving Wei Yilin, the fact that she, a thirteen-year-old girl was kidnapped by Japanese pirates for more than an hour, was much more terrifying.\u201cImpossible, I clearly saw it!\u201d Wei Yilin shook his head, that picture was too real.\u201cYilin, you were frightened today and passed out, maybe it was a hallucination when you were unconscious.\u201d Yun guessed.\u201cI\u2026\u201d Hearing Yun\u2019s and Wei Qingwan\u2019s persuasion, Wei Yilin was not so sure.Could it be that he had hallucinations?Could it be that all the memories about Wei Ruo just now are false?Wei Yilin: doubt life(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Didn\u2019t you give those two Japanese pirates some dried sweet potato?\u201d\u201cI asked Xiumei to take my dried sweet potatoes to the people who reclaimed wasteland nearby. If you want to eat, I\u2019ll find some when you return home.\u201d Wei Ruo replied.\u201cImpossible, I saw it clearly, you stunned two Japanese pirates with dried sweet potato medicine and then killed them, right?\u201d Wei Yilin asked again.Before Wei Ruo could speak, Wei Qingwan spoke first: \u201cBrother, my sister just arrived here, and all the dried sweet potatoes were given to the people nearby. You must have dreamed about these things. Although the person who saved you hasn\u2019t Found it, but don\u2019t worry, we will continue to search for the surrounding people, and I believe it will not be long before there will be results.\u201dWei Yilin looked at Wei Qingwan, why did his most trusted sister Wanwan say it was a fake\u2026could it really be a fake.Wei Yilin was silent.\u201cOkay, Yilin, you must have been quite frightened today, go home first, and then we will discuss what happened today slowly.\u201d Wei Yichen said.It\u2019s not a problem to be around here all the time, the most important thing now is that people are okay.Then Wei Yichen arranged for everyone to go home.Not long after everyone returned to Xiaowei\u2019s Mansion, Wei Mingting came back.Others are in the army, so it is not so convenient to come and go, and the Yun family did not send him any news at the beginning. When he knew, the Wei family had already found Wei Yilin.\u201cGo and bring Yilin here.\u201d Wei Mingting ordered.\u201cHusband, Yi Lin was frightened and is recuperating\u2026\u201d Yun explained.\u201cRecuperate? What is there to recuperate? He sneaked out, and all these sufferings are all his own responsibility!\u201d Wei Mingting\u2019s expression was serious and his eyes were piercing.\u201cBut my husband, Yilin is only seven years old\u2026\u201d\u201cSeven years old is already a boy!\u201dSeeing her husband\u2019s resolute attitude, Yun didn\u2019t dare to dissuade her anymore, so she let her servants go to Yuyu Garden to bring Wei Yilin over.Hearing that his father was looking for him, Wei Yilin\u2019s heart was already hanging high on the way here.After entering the door, Wei Yilin panicked completely when he saw his father\u2019s serious face.\u201cFather\u2026 I\u2026 I know I was wrong\u2026\u201d Wei Yilin was so frightened that he took the initiative to apologize and admit his mistake.\u201cGo and squat in the yard.\u201d Wei Mingting gave the order without any sympathy.\u201cDad, I\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t make me say it a second time.\u201dWei Yilin\u2019s heart trembled, and then he quickly turned around and walked to the yard, gaiting according to Wei Mingting\u2019s request.Immediately after that, Wei Mingting came out, asked someone to bring an incense burner, lit incense on the incense burner, and placed it under Wei Yilin\u2019s crotch.Immediately afterwards, someone brought a bowl, filled it with water, and placed it on top of Wei Yilin\u2019s head.Seeing this situation, Yun couldn\u2019t hold back again: \u201cHusband, isn\u2019t this a bit too strict for Yilin, he\u2019s only seven years old\u2026\u201d\u201cStrict? If he was not so lucky today and was rescued, he would probably have died in the hands of the Japanese pirates at this moment! He dared not even take his life. What can\u2019t be endured?\u201dYun\u2019s dumbfounded.Indeed, compared to dying, suffering a little now is considered light.At first Wei Yilin was able to persevere, but when a quarter of the incense in his crotch burned, his legs began to tremble uncontrollably, and the bowl above his head shook violently.When the incense burned a third, he staggered and fell to the ground, and the bowl on his head fell to the ground.\u201cGet up, continue, light the incense again.\u201d Wei Mingting said expressionlessly.Wei Yilin\u2019s face was full of pain, his legs trembled, but he had to follow Wei Mingting\u2019s request.This time, he persisted for a shorter period of time. He collapsed shortly after the incense was lit.But Wei Mingting still did not soften his heart, and still asked Wei Yilin to continue with a blank face.Mr. Yun was full of reluctance, so she chose to turn around and leave, and went back to the house, pretending not to know.I don\u2019t know how long it took, Wei Yilin could no longer stand up, and Wei Mingting let him go back.###After Wei Ruo returned to Wei\u2019s house, he went back to the house.Xiumei made Wei Ruo some calming tea. Although her young lady saw a lot of dead people and blood, it was the first time for her to kill someone. Xiumei was worried that she would not sleep well at night.Wei Ruo did not sleep very well in the first half of the night, and there was indeed a murder scene in the dream, with blood flowing all over the floor.It wasn\u2019t until the middle of the night that I slept soundly.After resting overnight, Wei Ruo got up early the next morning. Hearing that Wei Mingting was at the mansion, Wei Ruo packed up and was ready to see his father.\u201cWhat is Miss going to do?\u201d Xiumei asked.\u201cAvenge Wei Yilin.\u201dWei Ruo strode out of Tingsong Garden and went to Cangyun Garden.As soon as he entered the courtyard, he saw Wei Mingting and Wei Qingwan and Wei Yilin standing in front of him.Wei Yilin\u2019s legs trembled, which shows that he was really scolded yesterday.Today, Wei Mingting intends to continue training Wei Yilin, but Wei Qingwan, who learned about this, came to plead with Wei Mingting.Unfortunately, Wei Ruolai is presenting a warm scene of sister\u2019s kindness and brotherly love.Seeing Wei Ruo come in, the conversation was interrupted. Wei Mingting looked at Wei Ruo and asked, \u201cWhy is Ruoer so early today?\u201d\u201cI want to talk to my father about something. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s convenient for him.\u201d Wei Ruo didn\u2019t hide it.\u201cSay what you have to say.\u201d Wei Mingting said.\u201cIt\u2019s about my little brother Yilin. My daughter thinks that the way father punishes my little brother is inappropriate.\u201d Wei Ruo said.Hearing this, Wei Yilin raised his head and looked at Wei Ruo in surprise.Sister Wanwan is sure to intercede for him, but why would Wei Qingruo also intercede for him?\u201cRuo\u2019er is the same as Wanwan, do you think you shouldn\u2019t continue to punish her as a father today?\u201d Wei Mingting asked.Just now Wei Qingwan told Wei Mingting about this matter, because Wei Yilin is still young, yesterday\u2019s punishment has already made Wei Yilin unable to walk today, I hope he can postpone today\u2019s punishment for the sake of Yilin\u2019s young age.\u201cFather, that\u2019s not what I mean, but I think the teaching of my younger brother should not be limited to one or two days. My father is usually busy with official duties, and his time at home is limited. He only disciplines him for a day or two when he is around. In the military camp, she no longer disciplines her, and my daughter feels that this method has little effect.\u201d Wei Ruo analyzed.As soon as this remark came out, Wei Yilin was dumbfounded, this woman didn\u2019t come to intercede for him! But to harm him!But Wei Mingting felt that Wei Ruo\u2019s words made sense, so he continued to ask: \u201cWhat method does Ruo\u2019er think is better?\u201d\u201cMy daughter thinks that Yilin and Sister Qingwan should be separated first.\u201d Wei Ruo replied.The faces of Wei Qingwan and Wei Yilin turned pale at the same time.If it was normal, Wei Yilin would have spoken insultingly to Wei Ruo at this moment, but today, he only dared to stare at Wei Ruo with unbelievable eyes.Wei Qingwan lowered her head, bit her lip, and asked in an aggrieved voice: \u201cDoes my sister think that I brought my younger brother down?\u201d(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Sister Qingwan\u2019s temper is naturally good as a lady of the family. She is gentle and pleasant, kind, caring and sensible. But just because you have a good temper doesn\u2019t mean you are suitable to teach your younger brother. Brother Yilin is stubborn and likes to be taught. What is needed is strict discipline, not blindly caring and pampering.\u201dImmediately afterwards, Wei Ruo turned his head to Wei Mingting and said, \u201cFather, you are busy with official duties, and your mother has no time to spare because of the affairs of the mansion. The most people who get along with brother Yilin in the mansion is sister Qingwan, but now brother Yilin\u2019s temper is not good for you, father.\u201d You see. I said this not to say that sister Qingwan is not good, but that she is really not suitable for teaching brother Yilin.\u201dWei Qingwan\u2019s hands in the sleeves were clenched into fists, and her face turned pale visibly.Wei Yilin finally couldn\u2019t help it anymore: \u201cSister Wanwan is not wrong, sister Wanwan is not incompetent!\u201d\u201cShut up.\u201d Wei Mingting cut off Wei Yilin\u2019s words with a cold reprimand.At this moment, he has no right to speak.Wei Yilin\u2019s fussy and dependent appearance on Wei Qingwan made Wei Mingting feel that the eldest daughter\u2019s worries were justified.After our Wei family became a general, his son had no ambitions, behaved arrogantly and did not know the rules, and was very dependent on his sisters at home. How could he become a great weapon?Wei Qingwan\u2019s heart trembled, her fingers pinched the hem of her skirt, she had the urge to speak, but she didn\u2019t have the courage to speak at this time, so she could only press her lips together tightly.After Wei Yilin stopped drinking, Wei Mingting carefully looked at the eldest daughter in front of him, pondered for a while and said: \u201cRuoer, continue to talk.\u201d\u201cMy daughter thinks that I should find a master of martial arts for my younger brother Yilin, and teach Kung Fu carefully and strictly. As a man of the Wei family, if he can\u2019t succeed in writing, he should follow in the footsteps of his father and take the road of martial arts. Don\u2019t waste time and cultivate He looks like he has lost both civil and military skills.\u201dWei Ruo\u2019s words are convincing, and his analysis is well-founded.After pondering for a while, Wei Mingting nodded, \u201cRuoer\u2019s words are reasonable. Some things are neglected by my father, but Ruoer sees them clearly. Now I will do what you said, Ruoer. From today on, you are not allowed to Yi Lin sets foot in Wangmei Garden again, and Yi Lin is not allowed to run around in the mansion in his spare time, and Wanwan is not allowed to go to Yu Yu Garden to visit Yi Lin privately. I will also find someone to make arrangements for the master who teaches martial arts as soon as possible.\u201dWei Mingting made a decision, Wei Yilin was hit hard, his legs were trembling and he couldn\u2019t stand, he staggered and fell to the ground.Wei Qingwan hurriedly stepped forward to help her, her eyes full of concern.Wei Yilin threw himself into Wei Qingwan\u2019s arms aggrievedly and cried: \u201cSister, I don\u2019t want to be separated from you, and I don\u2019t want to learn martial arts, sister\u2026\u201d\u201cBrother is not afraid, dad is doing it for your own good.\u201d Wei Qingwan hurriedly comforted her, her expression distressed and anxious.Wei Mingting didn\u2019t make a sound beside him. Originally, he didn\u2019t notice the problem at this level. Now after the eldest daughter said something, and seeing the second daughter\u2019s care and love for the younger brother, his brows could not help but frown.When he was at home, his strict demands on his youngest son always had no effect. The older the younger son was, the less he would be disciplined. Perhaps the root cause was here.\u201cWanwan, go back to Meiyuan first.\u201d Wei Mingting said with a serious expression.Wei Qingwan\u2019s body froze, feeling the blood flowing backwards all over her body.She braced her body and slowly straightened up: \u201cYes, daughter\u2026retire\u2026\u201dWei Qingwan slowly walked out of Cangyun Garden step by step, and when she came to the door, she looked back reluctantly, as if she was leaving not only Cangyun Garden, but this home.Looking at the three people in the courtyard, Wei Qingwan felt for the first time that she was an outsider\u2026Wei Mingting\u2019s original intention of letting Wei Qingwan leave was just that he felt that his second daughter was too soft-hearted, and she would comfort her brother softly when he suffered a little bit, so it would be inconvenient for him to teach the child.So after Wei Qingwan left, Wei Mingting punished Wei Yilin to chop firewood, allowing him to experience the daily hardships of ordinary people. Yesterday\u2019s punishment made his legs tremble and he could not stand still, but his hands were fine, which did not affect his chopping firewood.\u201cRuo\u2019er, first look at Yilin for your father, and go talk to your mother about something for your father.\u201d Wei Mingting said to Wei Ruo.\u201cOkay.\u201d Wei Ruo agreed.Then Wei Ruo showed a sly smile at Wei Yilin from an angle that Wei Mingting couldn\u2019t see.Wei Yilin still had tears on his face, staring at Wei Ruo blankly with red eyes, speechless.Then Wei Mingting went back to the house and told Yun that he wanted to find a martial arts master for Wei Yilin.\u201cWhy did Husband suddenly remember to let Yilin learn martial arts?\u201d Yun asked.\u201cIt was Ruo\u2019er who reminded me that Yilin\u2019s current temper has already been spoiled. He doesn\u2019t read books well and acts recklessly. Today he can go out of the house privately and has no respect for his elders. I don\u2019t know what shocking things he can do tomorrow. When it comes to things, if we don\u2019t strictly discipline them, it will eventually become a disaster for our Wei family. And practicing martial arts is a good way of discipline.\u201d\u201cWhat my husband said is that this matter is also the responsibility of the concubine. It is the concubine who failed to discipline the child well.\u201d Yun lowered her head in shame.\u201cI can\u2019t blame you entirely. After coming to Xingshan County, you have to take care of all the big and small affairs of the mansion, and you are really busy. Now that I think about it, Wanwan\u2019s temperament is too weak after all. As the saying goes, a loving mother often loses her son. Using the older sister to teach the younger brother instead of the mother is too loving and indulgent, and the result is the same.\u201d\u201cI will talk to Wanwan about this matter later, so that she can correct this problem and be stricter with my younger brother.\u201d Yun said hastily.\u201cNo need, I have ordered that their siblings are not allowed to communicate in private for the time being. If there is a need in the future, let Ruo\u2019er come. Compared with Wanwan\u2019s weakness, Ruo\u2019er\u2019s temperament is more suitable for teaching younger brothers.\u201d Wei Mingting said.Wearing this, Yun was shocked, she didn\u2019t expect that her husband would not allow Wanwan and Yilin to communicate in private, and the person closest to Yilin is Wanwan, not even her as a mother.\u201cSo\u2026will it hurt Yilin and Wanwan\u2019s hearts?\u201d Yun was a little worried.\u201cIn Yilin\u2019s situation, he must suffer a lot to know what he can do and what he can\u2019t do. If he still cares about his mood at this time, how can he teach well? As for Wanwan, she is a sensible person. I also told her cause and effect, so I must understand the reason and not think too much.\u201d Wei Mingting said.\u201cMy husband is right.\u201dWhen Wei Mingting said this, the Yun family had no objection.Wei Mingting couldn\u2019t help but sigh with emotion: \u201cYou and I discussed making Wanwan the eldest daughter of the family. We only left the position of eldest daughter to Ruoer because we were worried that Ruo\u2019er didn\u2019t know the rules and it would be difficult for him to be the eldest daughter. It was because of his father\u2019s request. It\u2019s still my father who has the foresight, Ruo\u2019er is indeed more suitable to be the eldest daughter, she acts decisively, is calm in situations, and can take care of the overall situation.\u201d(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 99": "Chapter 99 - Supervisor Wei Yilin was punishedPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 99 Supervisor Wei Yilin was punishedMr. Yun did not expect her husband to approve of the ability of the eldest daughter so much.But it is true that what Ruo\u2019er has done in recent days has indeed added a lot of face to the Wei family, she is also decent outside, and she has the demeanor of a elder sister both internally and externally. Much better performance than she first thought.Yun agreed: \u201cMy husband is right, Ruoer is indeed more suitable to be the eldest daughter. But our Wanwan is not bad, she is gentle and considerate, well-behaved and sensible, every time I see her, I feel happy in my heart.\u201dWhile agreeing with the eldest daughter, the excellence of the second daughter cannot be ignored, so the Yun family specifically mentioned the second daughter.\u201cYeah.\u201d Wei Mingting couldn\u2019t deny this, he could only say that the two daughters have their own merits.\u201cThat\u2019s it for Yilin to find a martial arts master. You should strictly abide by the rules I set today even when I\u2019m not in the mansion, and don\u2019t be soft-hearted.\u201d Wei Mingting once again urged his wife who is easy to be soft-hearted towards her children.He knew that his wife was easy to soften his heart, so he specifically warned her.\u201cHusband, don\u2019t worry, I will never let him down.\u201d Yun promised.Although she feels sorry for her younger son and doesn\u2019t want him to suffer like this, she must abide by what her husband has set.###While Wei Mingting was negotiating with the Yun family, Wei Ruo supervised Wei Yilin\u2019s firewood chopping work in the yard.The seven-year-old\u2019s small arms are holding a big hatchet, and the naked eye can see the effort.Swing down the knife, the knife cuts in a little bit, and it is still a long way from splitting the firewood.After just a few chops, I felt that my arm could no longer exert strength. When I wanted to stop, Wei Ruo\u2019s voice came from my ear:\u201cIf you can\u2019t cut enough five bundles of firewood today, continue to cut five bundles again tomorrow, and if you can\u2019t cut enough tomorrow, then the day after tomorrow; until one day you can cut five bundles of firewood in one day.\u201d\u201cWei Qingruo! You are really too much!\u201d Wei Yilin couldn\u2019t bear it anymore, and glared at Wei Ruo with round eyes angrily.\u201cExcessive? Is there?\u201d Wei Ruo asked casually with a smile.\u201cI know you are taking revenge on me for betraying you yesterday, right? I thought about it last night. Those things are too real. It is absolutely impossible for me to dream about them. They definitely happened for real!\u201d Wei Yilin said with great certainty. Said.Wei Ruo just smiled and said nothing.Wei Yilin continued: \u201cWei Qingruo, I admit that I did something wrong to betray you yesterday, so even if I think about what happened yesterday, I will not tell others. I also thought about it later. If you let others know that you were kidnapped It\u2019s not good for you. Although I don\u2019t like you, but you are a daughter of our Wei family, I will not ruin your reputation.\u201dWei Yilin had a straight face, puffed cheeks, a little angry, but also very serious.Wei Ruo still didn\u2019t answer.What do you think of it? Anyway, if she doesn\u2019t answer or admit it, others won\u2019t believe what Wei Yilin said.Who cares if he remembers it or not.Wei Ruo didn\u2019t speak, Wei Yilin continued: \u201cAlso, I think you\u2019re pretty good at killing two Japanese pirates, so don\u2019t take revenge on me so narrowly, go and tell Dad to let him withdraw those orders just now .I can go to learn martial arts, but don\u2019t be separated from Sister Wanwan, let alone let you control me, I don\u2019t like you!\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t agree.\u201d Wei Ruo asked with a smile.\u201cWei Qingruo, I\u2019ve already said that, what else do you want?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to. As the eldest sister, it is my responsibility to teach the younger brother, so I will supervise you, even if you may not like it.\u201dWei Ruo\u2019s answer is watertight, regardless of whether the partition wall has ears, anyway, don\u2019t want to hear what she said that she will be caught as a pigtail.\u201cStop pretending, you didn\u2019t sincerely want to teach me at all, you just hurt me on purpose! And I don\u2019t recognize you as my elder sister, my elder sister is only sister Wanwan!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t talk so much, chop wood carefully, it is not advisable to be lazy.\u201d Wei Ruo looked relaxed.\u201cWei Qingruo!\u201d Wei Yilin was deeply annoyed by Wei Ruo\u2019s appearance.\u201cI want to call my sister, if you can\u2019t, I\u2019ll talk to my father later.\u201d Wei Ruo was not impatient.Wei Yilin was so angry that Wei Ruo was speechless.He turned his gaze back to the firewood in front of him, swung up the firewood knife vigorously, and dropped it hard, as if he regarded the firewood in front of him as Wei Ruo, and vented his dissatisfaction with Wei Ruo in this way.By the time Wei Mingting came out, Wei Yilin had already cut off half of the bundle.Wei Mingting actually knew that the tasks he assigned to his younger son would basically be impossible for him to complete. He did this deliberately in the hope that this would sharpen his will and make him truly realize his mistakes.Seeing that under Wei Ruo\u2019s supervision, Wei Yilin lost his cowardice and insisted on chopping firewood, Wei Mingting became more certain that the eldest daughter is more suitable to teach the younger son.\u201cRuo\u2019er, let\u2019s go back today. In the days when I\u2019m not at home, Yilin will trouble you to take care of him. If he doesn\u2019t obey, you can enforce the family law for me.\u201d Wei Mingting confessed.Wei Yilin was so angry that he looked at his father\u2019s majestic face, both angry and wronged.\u201cDaughter knows.\u201d Wei Ruo agreed.Then Wei Ruo left Cangyun Garden.Before leaving, Wei Ruo looked back at Wei Yilin, who was staring at him fiercely.###In mid-August of the lunar calendar, the rice harvest in Xingshan County has also arrived.People in Xingshan County have no joy of harvest, but more sorrow and depression.Because of the lack of grain harvest, the grain harvested is not enough for many people to eat for the next year.The situation of the Wei family is similar. Yun looked at the account book handed over by the manager of Zhuangzi, frowning.The person in charge said that the best growing seedlings in Zhuangzi are the replanted seedlings brought by Wei Ruo later.The harvest of other rice that is being harvested is only about one-third of last year, and one-fifth of what it was five years ago.Although the part of the rice that was replanted later is not yet mature, judging from the situation of hanging ears, it is much more than other rice.However, Wei Ruona only accounted for a small part of the seedlings in the past, and the grain output of Weijiazhuangzi is still much less than in previous years.In addition to Wei Mingting\u2019s official salary, Zhuangzi is a great source of income for the Wei family.Zhuangzi\u2019s lack of harvest means that the Wei family has no extra revenue, and the expenditure in the next year will become a problem.Wei Qingwan came to Cangyunyuan to help Yun\u2019s family affairs after class was over from the county magistrate\u2019s mansion. Seeing that Yun\u2019s worries about food, she comforted her: \u201cMother, don\u2019t worry. Did you get an official award from the court again?\u201dMr. Yun shook his head: \u201cIt is true that you have received awards, but most of the awards from the imperial court are honors, and the objects you get cannot be exchanged for money.\u201dBesides, Wei Mingting only temporarily repelled the Japanese pirates along the coast of Xingshan County this time, but did not completely defeat all the Japanese pirates that plagued the entire southeast coast. Naturally, there were not so many rewards.Speaking of this, Yun sighed again: \u201cI knew Ruoer\u2019s rice seeds were so useful. I wish I had planted all of Ruoer\u2019s rice seeds back then. Now there should be no such troubles.\u201d(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 100": "Chapter 100 - new store openingPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 100 New Store OpeningHearing Yun\u2019s praise of Wei Ruo, Wei Qingwan involuntarily tightened her fists.Now both father and mother feel that her elder sister is better than her.Wei Qingwan followed Yun\u2019s words and said casually: \u201cYes, it would be great if my sister told us earlier.\u201dHearing this, Yun\u2019s expression froze slightly.She doesn\u2019t know that the eldest daughter\u2019s rice seeds are easy to use, but the eldest daughter should know it herself.However, this idea only stayed in Yun\u2019s mind for a while, and she soon realized that when the eldest daughter came back, their early rice was already being planted.\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be Ruo\u2019er\u2019s fault. I remember that rice seedlings were already being transplanted in the field when she came back. At that time, she told me to change the rice variety, and I probably wouldn\u2019t believe it right away.\u201d Yun said.In this matter, Yun still remembers it clearly. At the beginning, when her daughter said that she wanted to improve the land in the south of the city, she still opposed it. She didn\u2019t quite believe that the eldest daughter really had this ability.\u201cYes\u2026 yes, my daughter almost forgot. It turns out that my sister came back at that time, I misremembered.\u201d Wei Qingwan\u2019s face hurriedly seconded.Just as Yun was frowning about the food, things from the Zhongyibo Mansion in the capital arrived.It was a gift from the old uncle and Wei Mingting\u2019s two elder brothers to congratulate Wei Mingting on his promotion.Among them, there are several carts of rice. The first half of the journey by water is faster, and the land road after passing Hangzhou Mansion has delayed a lot of time, so it was not delivered until today.Seeing the loads of things, Yun was overjoyed.Although Yun\u2019s mind is also clear, the reason why her father-in-law and the two elder brothers are so enthusiastic must be because her husband has been promoted. He is the only official official in the Zhongyi House now, and he is almost the reliance of the Zhongyi House.But I have to say that this part of the food met her urgent need.In addition to food, the Uncle Zhongyi\u2019s mansion sent some cloth jewelry, which was given by the old uncle and the old lady.\u201cThird Madam, these are given to the young lady by the old uncle and the old lady.\u201dThe person who came to give the gift specifically confessed.\u201cOkay.\u201d While Yun agreed, she looked at Wei Qingwan beside her, with concern in her eyes.Wei Qingwan\u2019s face was a little pale, but she still forced a smile on Yun\u2019s concerned eyes.But her smile made Yun even more sympathetic.Before the Yun family opened their mouths to talk about this matter, Wei Qingwan stepped forward and said: \u201cMother, my daughter is fine, my sister just returned home, it is right for grandparents to care more about my sister.\u201dHearing her daughter\u2019s sensible words, Yun\u2019s heart became more and more heavy.Mr. Yun glanced at the cloth and jewelry in front of him, wavering in his heart for a while, and then said: \u201cWanwan, next time when the mansion is more free, mother will buy some for you.\u201dIn her heart, Yun really wanted to give some to Wei Qingwan, but she still had a semblance of reason. These cloths and jewelry were different from the ornaments last time. These things had to be worn out.In the future, they still have to go back to the capital. When the time comes, the parents-in-law will definitely not like it if they let the parents-in-law know that she privately gave the things that the eldest daughter named to the second daughter.No matter how much Yun Shi wanted to take care of his second daughter, he would not dare to go against his in-laws.Hearing Yun Shi\u2019s words, Wei Qingwan was taken aback, and looked at Yun Shi in a daze.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with Wanwan?\u201d Yun looked at Wei Qingwan suspiciously.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, mother, I\u2019m fine\u2026\u201d Wei Qingwan immediately came back to her senses, and repeatedly emphasized that she was fine.\u201cWell, as long as it\u2019s okay.\u201d Yun didn\u2019t think much about it, she knew Wanwan\u2019s temper, and it was inevitable that her grandparents\u2019 attitude would make her feel sad, but she certainly wouldn\u2019t have other thoughts.Thinking for a while, Yun said again: \u201cMother has a set of pearl hair mask. I planned to give it to you when you were old, but now I plan to give it to you first, and Wanwan will wear it when I go to Fucheng.\u201dYun\u2019s consideration is not only because of today\u2019s events, but also the matter of Yun Brocade. She didn\u2019t want Wanwan to feel too wronged, and she didn\u2019t expect that when she went to Fucheng, Wanwan\u2019s clothes were much worse than that of her eldest daughter. .\u201cNo, no, no, my daughter won\u2019t need it, and my daughter still has some dignity, so I\u2019d better keep it for myself.\u201d Wei Qingwan quickly refused.\u201cIt\u2019s useful, you are Mother\u2019s daughter, and everything that belongs to Mother will belong to you and Ruo\u2019er in the future.\u201d Yun said in relief.\u201cThen\u2026the daughter thanked mother.\u201d Wei Qingwan didn\u2019t refuse anymore, and said with a shy and grateful expression.\u201cSilly boy, tell mother what to say thank you, let\u2019s go, follow mother to the house.\u201dMr. Yun took Wei Qingwan\u2019s hand and walked towards her own room, planning to hand over the set of pearl face masks to Wei Qingwan now.###The things that Zhongyi Bofu named to give to Wei Ruo were sent to Tingsongyuan.The box this time is not big, but the things are much more expensive than those copper ornaments sent for the first time.\u201cMiss, here is a set of gold jewelry! There are also some emerald jewelry, which seem to be precious things.\u201d Xiumei was pleasantly surprised.Wei Ruo was also a little surprised. Unexpectedly, Uncle Zhongyi actually gave him some valuable jewelry.Though the cloth is not as expensive as Yun brocade, but there is a whole box, and it is also satin, and the price is not cheap.\u201cSure enough, a skinny camel is bigger than a horse. No matter how the Zhongyi uncle\u2019s mansion declines, it still has some foundations.\u201d Wei Ruo muttered.What made Wei Ruo curious was how the old uncle and the old lady would give him such a valuable thing, which never happened in the original book.After thinking about it, the difference from the original book is that her achievements in the south of the city have brought benefits to the Wei family.So the two elders didn\u2019t completely feel sorry for her granddaughter who hadn\u2019t met. Their actions were more out of consideration for the interests of the family.But this is also good, at least real money will be paid, which Wei Ruo likes very much.###For several days in a row, the long-term workers in Xiaoyangshan were busy harvesting sweet potatoes, and several pre-purchased warehouses were filled to the brim.The production of dried sweet potatoes and sweet potato chips was also put on the agenda.According to Wei Ruo\u2019s intention, the nanny specially selected women from poor families to learn how to make dried sweet potatoes and sweet potato chips, and then handed over a large number of dried sweet potatoes to them.Each person pays five renminbi per day plus one big sweet potato per person.This is not a high income, but for village women who have problems eating, it is a very good job. At least it can keep them from starving, and the work intensity is not too high, so they can do it.At the same time, next to Sibaozhai, a grain store opened bustlingly.The name of the shop is very simple and straightforward, it is called Xu Jiliang Shop.The store mainly sells grains\u2014rice and sweet potatoes, as well as fresh and dried shiitake mushrooms.Dried sweet potatoes and sweet potato chips will also be sold at the same price as those sold in preserved fruit stores.(end of this chapter)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
