Why should the heavens treat my Jun family like this!\" Another clan elder cried out sadly.The clan has the ridiculous ancient Eucharist. Not only did they have no surprises, but they thumped their chests and felt very disappointed.The reason is very simple.

It could compete with the eternal fairy body, the chaotic **** body, and the heavenly hegemonic body.Great sacred body, even called the emperor of Bangu.But in modern times, the laws of heaven and earth have changed drastically, and the environment is no longer suitable for the cultivation of the ancient Eucharist.Ten chains even fell from the sky to restrain the growth of the Eucharist.At this moment, that baby, Jun Xiaoyao, looked blank.\"I have crossed, and there is a tasteless ancient Eucharist?\"Jun Xiaoyao was an orphan in his previous life and was adopted by a blind fortune teller.The blind man said that although he was poor and lonely in this life, he would definitely be blessed by God in the next life and reach the pinnacle of life.Jun Xiaoyao was still quite unbelief at that time, but an accident took his life, opened his eyes again, and became a baby.\"It seems that I have indeed been born at the end of my life.\" Jun Xiaoyao thought to himself.From the words of those clan elders, Jun Xiaoyao could hear that the Jun family he was in was an ancient family, which was extremely brilliant.It can be said that others were born at the starting line, but Jun Xiaoyao was born directly at the end.\"It's just...I was born in such a sky-defying family, why is my physique so wasteful?

How can such a bad street name be worthy of their monarch's unicorn?At this time, a somewhat weak voice suddenly sounded: \"Why don't you call him Xiaoyao? My husband once said that it is easy to be a celestial being. I only hope that my child will be happy for a lifetime.\"lying on the bed, the pale beautiful woman spoke.She is Jun Xiaoyao's biological mother, Jiang Rou.Faced with Jiang Rou's suggestion, Jun Zhantian and others cannot ignore it.Because Jiang Rou's identity is not so simple, she is a goddess of the Jiang family from the ancient family.Although the Jiang family is not as well-known as the Jun family, it is also an ancient family, so how weak can it be?\"Okay, it's called Xiaoyao.\" Jun Zhantian nodded, but he sighed slightly as if he suddenly thought of something on his mind.Jun Xiaoyao jumped when he saw this situation.Only then did he realize that his father does not seem to be here.wouldn't it be the father's sacrifice to the sky again, with boundless magic power?\"Zhantian, don't worry, Jun Wugui, but the white-clothed **** king, how can he fall so easily, and this child may grow up in the future, and may not be able to find his father to help him.\" An old woman on the side comforted.\"That's right, haha, I still have a baby grandson!\" Jun Zhantian regained his smile.Jun Xiaoyao blinked, and secretly wrote down his father's title.The white **** king has no regrets.From this name, his father seems to be quite tall...\"The news that Xiaoyao is the ancient sacrament of great desolation is spread out, I am afraid it will cause the immortal territory to shake, you know, there are many forces secretly trying to disadvantage my Jun family.\" A clan elder said with deep meaning.\"Do you mean to use means to cover up Xiaoyao's body fluctuations?\" Jun Zhantiandao.The other elders also nodded slightly.The wood is beautiful in the forest, and the wind will destroy it.Jun Xiaoyao is now the treasure of the Jun family, no mistakes can appear.\"My descendants, when did they learn to cover up? Can't a sacrament protect it?\"At this time, a cold snort suddenly exploded from the sky.The entire Jun family was shocked, countless eyes cast to the top of the Heavenly Emperor Palace.\"That wave...\"\"What a powerful breath, the old ancestor who was sleeping in the ancestral shrine, crawled out of the coffin!\"\"Hiss...Are even the ancestors alarmed?\" The sound of countless family members sucking in cold air came from all directions.That is the ancestor-level figure of the Jun family, many of the Jun family have no chance to see their ancestors in their lives.And when Jun Xiaoyao was born, he shocked his ancestors, shocked many people, and showed envy.In the Palace of the Emperor of Heaven, Jun Zhantian and other clan elders heard this voice, also with a vibrating color, and hurried out of the Palace of the Emperor.The void above the Heavenly Emperor Palace opened a huge space crack.A slightly thin gray figure appeared.It was an old man in a gray robe, with dust on his head and body, as if he had just crawled out of the ground.But his shriveled body seems to contain the power of shaking the world!Like the heavens and the world, they are all under his feet!\"I'm the Eighteen Ancestor, I have seen the Eighteen Ancestor!\"Jun Zhantian and others hurriedly bowed.This gray-robed old man, but a real ancestor-level figure of the Jun family, has been buried in the Jun family's ancestral shrine for countless years.Only when a great change occurs in the Jun family, or when it reaches the critical moment of life and death, will he wake up.Jun Zhantian and others never thought that the birth of Jun Xiaoyao would attract the attention of the ancestors.The eighteenth ancestor's figure flashed, as if flashing, appeared in front of Jun Zhantian and hugged Jun Xiaoyao.His eyes are as deep as the sun and the moon, looking at Jun Xiaoyao.Jun Xiaoyao blinked, not crying or making trouble, but with a hint of curiosity.\"Is this my ancestor of the Jun family, so powerful aura, stronger than that of grandpa.\" Jun Xiaoyao thought to himself.The Eighteenth Ancestor couldn't help laughing and said, \"Ok...well, there is another real dragon in my Jun family. You stupid things, you still want to hide the light of this child.\"\"Eighteenth ancestor, I'm afraid that someone will be unfavorable to my grandson in the future...\" Jun Zhantian bit his head.Although their elders have a high status, they can only be regarded as younger generations before the eighteenth ancestors.\"Hmph, I see who dares, if those old immortals dare to pull their faces down and face Xiaoyao's shots, the old man won't mind setting off an immortal war, killing him upside down, and bleeding millions of miles!\"The eighteen ancestors had an infinitely domineering attitude.Jun Zhantian and the others all secretly swallowed.Immortal war is a great battle between the ancient family, the supreme dynasty, and the immortal orthodoxy of the ancient royal family.A battle can turn the fairyland upside down, and hundreds of millions of people bleed.Desolate Heaven and Immortal Realm, it has been a long time since there has been an immortal war.\"The old man announced that in the future this child will be the son of my Jun family, and all cultivation resources are tilted towards him. Even if he piles up hard, he has to pile up a great Eucharist!\" Eighteenth Ancestor ordered.Jun Zhantian and the others nodded in agreement.The ancient eucharist that is born to break the shackles, so fools will not cultivate.\"Furthermore, to give this child the qualification of the zero number...\" the Eighteenth Patriarch continued. UU Reading www.uukanshu.cOM\"What?\" The clansmen were shocked.If it is just to bestow the identity of the son of God, that's fine, after all, it is just a status symbol.But the sequence is different.The Jun Family sequence is qualified to fight for the position of Patriarch.There are tens of thousands of young people in the Jun family.But only ten people have obtained serial status.In other words, only these ten people are qualified to compete for the position of Patriarch.These ten people, every one of them, can be amazing for an era, and they are the top ten arrogances of the Jun family.And above the top ten sequences, there is a zero number sequence.Zero means nothing and infinite possibilities!Its status is still above the first sequence!The zero number sequence of the previous generation is the father of Jun Xiaoyao, the white **** Wang Jun has no regrets!\"Eighteen Patriarch, this is a bit wrong, it will make other sequences feel dissatisfied...\" an old woman tentatively said.Every sequence has gone through countless tests before obtaining this identity.Jun Xiaoyao was given the zero sequence when he was born. What did this make other sequences think?\"They are dissatisfied, let them fight on their own in the future, and the child will talk after the fight.\" The Eighteenth Ancestor said with his sleeve.Listening to his tone, he is obviously extremely confident in Jun Xiaoyao.Jun Xiaoyao heard the words and sighed silently.Grandpa had high hopes for him, and the ancestors looked at him differently, as well as the secrets of his father and the hidden dangers of those monarchs.I really can't be a salted fish.\"Invincible talent, invincible background, system assistance, with such a perfect start, if I can't suppress an era, then I can only say that I'm too good...\" Jun Xiaoyao thought to himself.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

If something goes wrong, the Eighteenth Ancestor will have to peel him off.\"How do I feel that the power of the **** of kidney is stronger than the other four gods?\" Jun Xiaoyao asked in doubt.This is not to say that his other four gods are not strong, but the kidney **** is too strong.Jun Zhantian hurriedly stepped forward to investigate, and finally heaved a sigh of relief, his eyes complicated with envy.\"Grandpa, am I okay?\" Jun Xiaoyao asked.\"Of course it's okay, Xiaoyao, you will have to open up more branches and leaves for your grandfather's line in the future. When the ten-year-old feast comes, I will ask Jiang Rou to give you the pearl of their Jiang family.\" Jun Zhantian said .\"This...\" Jun Xiaoyao was taken aback, and then suddenly realized.Dare to love the ancient Eucharist also has a bonus in that respect.But Jun Xiaoyao is not the brains of a worm, no matter how good his kidneys are, he can't mess around.As for arranged marriages, Jun Xiaoyao would not like any Jiang's pearl in his hand.\"By the way, grandpa, do you know what the Taiyue monument is?\" Jun Xiaoyao changed the subject.For the past three years, Jun Xiaoyao has been settling, and he has not signed in.Now that his cultivation base has broken through again, it is time to sign in at the sign-in place and receive the reward.\"The Taiyue Ancient Stele was originally a stone stele standing in the Wild Heaven and Immortal Realm to test the physical strength, but it was later dug back by our Jun family.

He deliberately selected a powerful, high-level, but also very complex attacking magical power from the Jun family.\"This is a military tactic.

Although they have kept a distance, they are still childhood sweethearts, and the relationship is not bad.After inner weighing, Bai Yuer agreed.It turned out that after such a long time, the marriage contract had been set long ago, but the elixir has never been seen.And the current Suzaku ancient country's national power is weak, and there is no ability to ask for it from Qinglong ancient country.Therefore, I can only rely on Bai Yuer to find the elixir by himself.\"What should I do, the father can't fall...\" Bai Yuer couldn't help feeling a little anxious.\"By the way, how come I almost forgot, my girlfriend, Jun Linglong?\" Bai Yuer suddenly thought.She once met Jun Linglong by chance in a secret realm, and they got along well with each other.Although he didn't contact him much later, with Jun Linglong's character, he would definitely not ignore it.Furthermore, the Jun family absolutely possesses the elixir.Thinking of this, Bai Yuer was short of breath, and hurriedly took out a jade slip to pass the message.On the other side, Jun Linglong also received the news.\"The Lord of the Vermilion Bird is seriously ill and needs elixir to heal?\" Jun Linglong frowned when she heard the news.To be honest, if it weren't for Bai Yuer's message, she would have almost forgotten this \"girlfriend\".Although Bai Yuer is an ancient emperor, she has a noble status.But Jun Linglong is the proud daughter of the ancient family.Don't look at her now as Jun Xiaoyao's maid, but when she walks out of the outside world, she is still a gentleman who is sought after by all quarters.\"As soon as you open your mouth, it's an elixir, and you have a good appetite, but you can get acquainted with her anyway.\" Jun Linglong frowned slightly.But the problem is, she doesn't have an elixir.At this time, a divine sound transmission fell into Jun Linglong's mind.\"Linglong, make tea.\"Jun Linglong hurriedly got up, this is Jun Xiaoyao asking her to make tea.In a hot and immortal pool, Jun Xiaoyao has his upper body naked, his body carved like immortal jade, dizzy with flowing light.Jun Xiaoyao, who is eight years old, has a very long body.Aside, Jun Linglong entered and gave Jun Xiaoyao a cup of enlightenment tea.Watching Jun Xiaoyao gradually open up and become more and more handsome and handsome, Jun Linglong has the illusion that she is cultivated by the Taitai.\"What's wrong, something?\" Jun Xiaoyao took a sip of tea and said lightly.\"No.\" Jun Linglong's eyelashes trembled slightly.\"Go ahead, can you hide it from me?\" Jun Xiaoyao shook his head and smiled.Jun Linglong bit her lip slightly, and after all, she said about Bai Yuer.\"So that's the case, is it not dead medicine, I don't lack it.\" Jun Xiaoyao shrugged.When he was on the Taiyue monument, he received three immortal medicines, and then the eighteenth ancestor successively gave him five immortal medicines.Jun Xiaoyao has only refined three plants over the years, and five plants remain.\"Since it is your best friend, it's okay to give one to her, let her come over.\" Jun Xiaoyao waved his hand.\"Is this for it?\" Jun Linglong was slightly stunned.The world of local tyrants, she really didn't understand!But Jun Linglong nodded slightly, and replied to Bai Yuer.Jun Xiaoyao has a slight smile at the corner of his mouth.Naturally he does not want to be a good old man, but has his own ideas and plans.This righteous light, let those righteous pillars come.The Virgin and the like are not suitable for him.Let's talk about another immortal medicine. Although Jun Xiaoyao doesn't pay much attention to it, he is not so atmospheric that he can give it away.\"The sequence of the monarch family is not only supported by various veins, but even vassal Orthodoxy forces. UU reading www.uukanshu.com\"\"Even if it is the sword, there are vassal forces such as Ancient Sword Sect behind him.\"This kind of vassal force is not surrendering to the family, but to the individual.\"Although the national power of the ancient Suzaku country has declined in recent years, the lean camel is larger than the horse, but it can be taken over. Maybe the other three ancient countries can also be taken as vassal forces by the way.\"Jun Xiaoyao is thinking about it.After all, he is the zero sequence, if there is no vassal force behind it, it would be a little shameful.There must be some cards.As for the worship of Yu'er, how can it be possible to get an undead medicine for nothing?Jun Xiaoyao is not doing charity, he will not do things that are not beneficial to him.And Bai Yuer, who got Jun Linglong's reply, was also surprised.This feeling is like a long drought in the rain.is just the words passed by Jun Linglong, which made Bai Yuer think about it.Because she was going to give her the elixir, it was not Jun Linglong herself.\"A proud boy of the Jun family, who promised to give me an immortal potion, did he fall in love with me?\"Bai Yuer couldn't help but think.She is quite confident about her appearance, and she is the first beauty in the ancient country of Suzaku.is also quite famous in the entire Wild Heaven and Immortal Realm.In her mind, the person who is willing to give her an elixir must be greedy for her body.\"Sure enough, even the prince of the Jun family is inevitable.\" Bai Yuer felt a little disappointed inexplicably.Junjia Tianjiao, it seems that he is not as extraordinary as he imagined.\"But no matter what, get the elixir to save the emperor first.\"Bai Yuer shook his head and set off for Huangzhou.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Could it be that famous emperor, worship Yuer?\"\"Look at the direction it is heading, it's Jun's house!\"The arrival of this driving car has made many people talk about it.Not long, the car wheel stopped outside the Jun's residence.Over the entire Jun's family, except for the Jun family's own people, people from other forces who dare to pass by will be regarded as an invasion and directly obliterated.The door curtain of the car opened, and a tall, beautiful woman with slender legs and a red feather coat stepped out. It was Bai Yuer.She came alone this time without any entourage.Bai Yu'er looked around, in the Jun's residence, there were countless **** islands floating in the void, all kinds of caves and blessed places, spewing sunlight.This shocked Bai Yuer's heart.Although the ancient kingdom of Vermillion Bird is also a first-class power and has a great reputation, it is still insignificant compared with the ancient noble family, and there is not much comparability.But immediately, the corner of Bai Yuer's mouth provoked a touch of confidence and a touch of disdain.What if the Jun family is detached?The prince of Tianjiao from the Jun family is not greedy for her body yet, and wants to give her the elixir.But Bai Yuer has made up his mind and will not easily hand over his body to the Junjia Tianjiao.After all, she has a marriage contract.When something happens, doesn't it make the prince of the ancient kingdom of Qinglong a green head?After thinking about it, Bai Yuer stepped forward.At the gate of the Jun's house is guarded by the Jun's guard, which is as towering as an iron tower, with blood and blood.\"The person who comes will stop and report his name.\"Jun's guard said in a cold tone.\"I am the emperor of the ancient country of Suzaku, worship Yuer, come to see Jun Linglong.\" Bai Yuer said in a calm tone.\"Will you meet your lady? But if you have a token, if you don't have it, get out.\" Jun's guard said indifferently.Adoring Yuer's charming face to stagnate.She is also the emperor of a country anyhow, even a guard of the Jun family dare to scold her like this.But she came to ask for something this time, so she could only be patient and took out the jade slip that she communicated with Jun Linglong.\"Go in.\" The guard of the Jun family waved indifferently.Bai Yu'er bit her lip, her status as the emperor, in front of the Jun family, seemed so unworthy.On the other side, Jun Linglong also found Jun Xiaoyao.\"My Lord God, she has come.\" Jun Linglong said.\"Let's go, go and see the emperor.\"Jun Xiaoyao got up, dressed in a white shirt, handsome and handsome, although he was only eight years old, his figure was as bright as a teenager.Here, Bai Yuer walked into a courtyard like a fairyland.Jun Linglong and her met here.It didn't take long, Bai Yuer heard the footsteps and looked at it.But I saw a young man with a long body and skin like a jade, pacing slowly.He is like a son of a god, with a magnificent posture of jade bones, a handsome face, and a thin layer of brilliance.Bai Yuer was just dumbfounded.There are not a few young talents whom she has met, and they are all handsome and romantic.But compared with the boy in front of him, they are like fireflies and bright moons, and loaches and real dragons. There is no comparison at all.Even her fianc\u00e9, the prince of the ancient kingdom of Qinglong, is also handsome and handsome, with extraordinary talents, but compared with the teenager in front of him, he still looks bleak.Beside Jun Xiaoyao, Jun Linglong, in a palace costume, followed his feet slowly.Bai Yuer saw this detail and took a deep breath.Jun Linglong is a noble lady of the Jun family. She is the one who wants to please her. As a result, now, how do you feel that you have become a servant girl?\"What is the origin of this Junjia Tianjiao? Is it a sequence?\" Bai Yuer's heart set off a storm.\"Are you worshiping Yuer?\" Jun Xiaoyao asked lightly.\"Exactly.\" Bai Yuer bowed slightly, but he was very reserved.She also recovered.What if the young man in front of him is detached, UU reading www.uukanshu.com is not yet plotting against her.In this case, she doesn't need to be too humble and lower her worth.\"Do you want to ask for an elixir to save your father?\" Jun Xiaoyao continued.\"Yes, I hope the son will show kindness and be able to extend a helping hand.\" Bai Yuer said calmly, without the slightest hint of humility.Jun Xiaoyao raised his eyebrows slightly when he saw this scene.How do you feel this attitude...is not right.It seems that she didn't come to ask for medicine at all, but came to ask for it as a matter of course.\"Oh? But can you give me a reason, after all, the elixir doesn't fall from the sky.\" Jun Xiaoyao said in a light tone.worshiping Yuer Yuyan slightly stagnated, and then a faint sneer appeared at the corner of his mouth.As expected, is it with a purpose?But it is impossible for Bai Yuer to exchange the elixir on his own terms.She opened the mouth and said: \"The son is an extraordinary person, and he must have a good status in the Jun family. There should be no shortage of elixir, and the son can save a life by offering an elixir.\"\"Not only that, to save my father, is to save the lives of hundreds of millions of people in the ancient country of Suzaku.\"\"This is for the son, but he can reap merit and fame with a small amount of effort. Isn't he not willing to do it?\"Bai Yuer spoke, standing on the moral high ground.Jun Xiaoyao is capable of relief, why not relief?The greater the ability, the greater the responsibility, isn't it?Upon hearing these familiar remarks, Jun Xiaoyao wanted to laugh a little.This reminded him of the Internet keyboard man who forced the celebrities to donate money in his previous life.\"So I was kidnapped by morals one day?\" Jun Xiaoyao was speechless.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She thinks that all men in the world will go around her and please her.\"If I change to another civilian traverser, I might just lick it up first, but unfortunately, I am not...\" Jun Xiaoyao secretly shook his head.Jun Xiaoyao has invincible talent, invincible status, and invincible background.A handsome, rich and handsome man.Now he wants others to lick him, not him to lick others.Like Jun Linglong, she was the first woman to lick him.But to worship Yuer, obviously IQ is not as high as Jun Linglong, or in other words, people will float after being licked by a dog for a long time.dared to pretend in front of Jun Xiaoyao.\"How long have we known each other?\" Jun Xiaoyao asked with a faint smile.Bai Yuer was slightly taken aback.Why did you suddenly mention something irrelevant?But Bai Yuer still said: \"It is the first time that Yuer and the son have met.\"\"For a person who meets for the first time, it is natural to ask for the elixir. Although I promised you before, did I say that I will give it to the ancient country of Suzaku for free?\"\"What does it have to do with me if the ancient country of Suzaku survives?\"\"Is the life and death of your father important to me?\"Jun Xiaoyao's smile faded away, and his tone was cold.Bai Yuer only came back to his senses, his face was blue and red.Jun Xiaoyao's three questions left her speechless and her expression awkward and unnatural.Indeed, Jun Linglong only told her that there was Jun's Tianjiao who was willing to give her the elixir, but he did not say that it was free.Moreover, the life and death of the Lord of the Suzaku and the ancient kingdom of Suzaku does not have anything to do with Jun Xiaoyao.\"But son, you are not bad for life medicine. Just give out a plant and you can save a life, and even hundreds of millions of lives, why not?\"Bai Yuer still stands on the moral high ground.Jun Xiaoyao's expression was completely indifferent, and he said coldly: \"It's very simple, because the elixir is mine. As long as I am willing, even a dog can be given!\"Bai Yuer heard the words, her delicate body trembled slightly, her face was pale, and a sense of humiliation surged from the bottom of her heart.Jun Xiaoyao's words mean that in his eyes, her father is worse than a dog?Thinking of this, Bai Yu'er was so angry that he couldn't help but say in a daze.\"Why do you have to make excuses, isn't it just to greet my body, but it is a pity that Yuer already has a fianc\u00e9, this condition is hard to follow!\"When \u3000\u3000 fell, Jun Linglong's Yurong changed instantly.She did not expect that Bai Yuer would say such a gaffe.Bai Yuer also recovered himself, feeling a chill filled her body, her face pale as paper.She actually said the words in her heart directly.\"Ha ha\u2026\u2026\"Jun Xiaoyao smiled.Hearing his laughter, Bai Yuer felt even more panic.Jun Xiaoyao's hand directly swept Jun's slender and soft waist beside him.Five years have passed, Jun Linglong is nineteen years old, and a young girl has just grown up. She has a soft and slim figure. The place that should be thin is thin and the place that should be full is full.Jun Xiaoyao suddenly embraced his slender waist like this, Jun Linglong's mind was delicate and calm, and at this moment he couldn't help but snorted, his cheeks flushed.Jun Xiaoyao showed amusement on his face, but his eyes were indifferent.\"Why don't you take a **** and take a picture of yourself, is it necessary for this **** son?\"\"Isn't my exquisite body fragrant, what are you?\"Two sentences in a row, Bai Yuer said that he was extremely ashamed and blushing.Jun Linglong is indeed better than her in all aspects.But what shocked Bai Yuer's heart more was Jun Xiaoyao's claim to be.This **** child!\"Oh my god, is this person's identity as the son of the prince?\"Bai Yuer's mind roared like five thunders, and a storm surged in her heart, her slender legs trembled, and she could not help but collapse to the ground.The **** son of the ancient family, that is the absolute symbol of status.Bai Yuer also thought at the beginning that the young man in front of him should be a relatively outstanding son of the Jun family.but never thought that he was a son of God!\"My Son of God, please forgive the impoliteness of Bai Yuer!\" Bai Yuer knelt on the ground and kowtowed his head repeatedly, his long red hair stained with dust ignored.Jun Xiaoyao's face is always indifferent.Jun Linglong, whose slender waist was held by him, was dizzy.Especially when I heard the words of my Linglong, Jun Linglong's heart was throbbing unconsciously.Jun Xiaoyao looked at Bai Yuer, who was kneeling on the ground, begging for forgiveness, and shook his head slightly.\"You can gain by giving. This is a truth that even children understand. It seems that you don't understand...\"Jun Xiaoyao said indifferently.Bai Yu'er wanted to get an undead medicine for nothing, it was a bit whimsical.He flicked his sleeves, turned and left.Jun Linglong calmed down slightly, and sighed to Bai Yuer: \"I can't help you with such rudeness in front of Lord God Son.\"\"No, please, my father still needs an elixir to save his life, he may not be able to last for a few years!\" Bai Yuer cried, regretting it in her heart.Knowing early, it is better to accept the conditions dutifully.arrogant, hurt her.\"I knew so, why bother in the first place.\" Jun Linglong said that she couldn't help.It is impossible for her to provoke Xiaoyao for a superficial worship of Yuer.\"I wish to kneel outside the son of God's bedroom, begging the son of God for forgiveness!\" Bai Yuer kowtowed, and the white forehead was stained with blood.Whether it is for the ancient country of Suzaku, or for her father and herself, Bai Yuer must be forgiven by Jun Xiaoyao.Jun Linglong shook her head slightly and let her go.Not long after, some Jun's family members saw that in the Heavenly Emperor Palace, outside Jun Xiaoyao's bedroom, a beauty in red could not kneel down, her beauty with extreme regret and determination.\"Hey, that seems to be the Queen of Suzaku, why is she kneeling there?\"\"Shhh, it seems to have offended Lord God Son, let's not mix up.\"All the family members, avoid Bai Yuer as air.In the Palace of Emperor Tian, Jun Xiaoyao lay in a spiritual pond to relax.\"My Lord God...\" Jun Linglong walked in.\"Why, UU reading www.uuk\u0101nshu.com wants to intercede for her?\" Jun Xiaoyao smiled lightly.\"No, it was her own self-inflicted feeling, but Linglong felt that the ancient Suzaku country behind her was of value.\" Jun Linglong thought.She has an exquisite heart with seven orifices, and she is clever and intelligent.\"Oh, for her, I have my own plan, the personality is too bad, I need to train it well, let's hang it there first.\" Jun Xiaoyao said casually.Although he is not happy with Bai Yuer, Jun Xiaoyao in the ancient kingdom of Suzaku does not want to give up like this.With Bai Yuer as a bridge, he can also better control the ancient kingdom of Suzaku.\"My lord God, it's really a bit bad.\" Jun Linglong gave him a rare glance, and Xiao Xiao presumptuously gave him a bit of anger.Ming will only be eight years old next year, but he looks like an old man.Even though she has a seven-orifice exquisite heart, she can't guess the thoughts of the person in front of her.\"If I'm really bad, I won't just grab the waist just now.\" Jun Xiaoyao smiled casually, looking down Jun Linglong's slender waist.Under the palace dress, the arc of the hip line is full and attractive.\"My Lord God, I'm going out first.\" Jun Linglong felt Jun Xiaoyao's sight, her face flushed, and she turned around and left in a hurry.Jun Xiaoyao smiled faintly.Sometimes, teasing the clever maid of the ice and snow can be considered relaxing.\"Bai Yuer's fianc\u00e9, um, hope he is a little self-aware...\"Bai Yuer, Jun Xiaoyao must be trained, because there is still use value.Compared to killing directly, is it not good to be trained as a slave and chess piece?As for her fiance, Jun Xiaoyao doesn't care about her background.How many people are there in Huangtian Fairyland, a younger generation with a higher background than him?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

With the strength of Lord God Child, he can easily kill you. He has been merciful to you.\" Bai Yuer stood up and said.Although she was so disappointed with Xiao Chen, she even invalidated the marriage contract.But after all, I used to be a childhood sweetheart. Although not very close, there is still a little affection.But it is limited to this.\"Shut up, you bitch, do I need Jun Xiaoyao to be merciful?\" Xiao Chen shouted angrily.It was kind to worship Yuer, but it stimulated Xiao Chen's nerves even more.He was almost depressed in his eyes, but now he is filled with unwilling anger again.\"This stupid girl is pulling hatred on me...\" Jun Xiaoyao secretly said.However, this is exactly what he wants.Because Jun Xiaoyao had another plan in his heart.\"You... OK, I'll treat it as a donkey liver and lungs!\"Xiao Chen took a bite of a bitch, making Bai Yuer's pretty face gloomy, and the only bit of affection was wiped out.Xiao Chen panted heavily, his chest rising and falling.He knew that he could not defeat Jun Xiaoyao today.Xiao Chen clenched his five fingers tightly, his nails pierced deeply into his palms, causing painful pain.His eyes swept across Bai Yuer and Jun Xiaoyao coldly, and he spoke.\"Jun Xiaoyao, don't be proud of you, Hedong for thirty years, Hexi for thirty years, don't bully the young and poor!\"\"Three years later, you and I will

then wait for three years to be slapped in the face?Why don't you follow the routine?\"In my Jun's family, I will speak harshly to my son, and then I want to leave safely, what do you regard my Jun's

drastically, and he turned to run away.But he was slapped over by the big golden hand.Then Jun Xiaoyao grabbed it in the air, and Xiao Chen heard a long roar of dragons.Soon, a half-imaginary blue dragon phantom was caught by Jun Xiaoyao.This is the dragon spirit that Xiao Chen is carrying.\"No, my dragon spirit!\" Xiao Chen's eyes were blood red, and he roared frantically.\"Noisy!\" Jun Xiaoyao took another shot.There was a bang, accompanied by a sore bone cracking sound.Most of the bones in Xiao Chen's body were broken, and the blood in his mouth was vomiting out like money.\"You...you actually abolished my meridians!?\"Xiao Chen's face was pale, and his teeth were crushed.Jun Xiaoyao didn't kill him, but he abolished him.In this way, let alone three years, it is three hundred years, three thousand years, he will not be able to defeat Jun Xiaoyao.\"Jun...Xiao...Yao...\" Xiao Chen spit out every word, his eyes filled with enmity and anger.The disciples of the Jun family around, also shuddered slightly, their hearts were cold.It was the first time they saw Jun Xiaoyao's cruel methods.\"Zhantian, act freely, it's really quick and resolute.\" A clan elder hidden in the void smiled.\"This is good, the more ruthless the grandson's means, the more at ease in my heart.\" Jun Zhantian smiled.Not only did they not think there was anything wrong with Jun Xiaoyao's move, they thought it was normal.In the future, Emperor Road will be opened, and there will be more cruel things, what is this level of thing.On the battlefield, after Jun Xiaoyao won the dragon qi, he didn't hesitate, he just started to absorb it in front of Xiao Chen.There was a loud noise from his body.It was the sound of giant elephant particles awakening.After absorbing most of the dragon energy, Jun Xiaoyao awakened another ten thousand giant elephant particles.Now he has fully awakened 30,000 giant elephant particles, which is 300 million catties of huge force, which is absolutely terrifying.Not only that, Jun Xiaoyao also discovered that the dragon energy is also nourishing his body, making his already powerful sacred body, UU reading www.uukanshu.com is even stronger.In addition, under his skin, there seems to be a layer of blue light spreading, which can be transformed into a dragon scale inner armor when needed.\"Good harvest.\" Jun Xiaoyao nodded slightly.Then he injected the remaining, undigested dragon energy into Bai Yuer's body.\"My Lord God, you...\" Bai Yuer was surprised, and never expected Jun Xiaoyao to do this.\"You have the Vermillion Bird Divine Fire in your body, and it should complement each other with the Qi of Qinglong.\" Jun Xiaoyao said lightly.His move was naturally to win over people's hearts.In the future, she will still need to worship Yuer and manage the ancient country of Suzaku for him, so her talent should not be too weak.\"Thank you, Lord God!\" Bai Yuer was so moved, tears even flickered in his eyes.This grace is like remaking!And Xiao Chen, who witnessed this scene, couldn't help but spit out his heart blood!Angry!is so angry that his internal organs are burning with anger, and his liver and gallbladder are broken!Jun Xiaoyao refines his dragon spirit in front of him, and also borrows flowers to present the Buddha to his former fiancee.The former fiancee worships Yuer, and kneels and licks Jun Xiaoyao in the posture of a mother licking a dog.This made Xiao Chen feel black in front of him and almost fainted.When \u3000\u3000 Jun Xiaoyao saw this, he said earnestly: \"Xiao Chen, don't be angry, I will take your dragon spirit and abolish your cultivation for your own good.\"Which protagonist is not suffering from all kinds of hardships and hardships.will not be scrapped, and I

Jun family shivered.Jun Xiaoyao is strong, and his lips are not weak.In a few words, Xiao Chen was so angry that he almost died on the spot.Jun Xiaoyao sighed slightly, somewhat speechless.What he said is indeed the truth.Generally speaking, a person like Xiao Chen who is lucky enough to have his own body will usually explode in a small universe after being deprived of his cultivation base and his talent.Various adventures continue, and then grow up all the way, sweeping everywhere.Thinking about it this way, Jun Xiaoyao is indeed good for Xiao Chen.\"Come on, throw him out of the gate.\" Jun Xiaoyao waved his hand.Soon, a guard from the Jun family came and dragged away the fainted Xiao Chen.At this time, Jun Zhantian's figure suddenly appeared from the void.\"Grandpa.\" Jun Xiaoyao nodded slightly.He had already felt that, Jun Zhantian and other clan elders were watching him from behind.\"Xiaoyao, do you know that wildfires can't be exhausted, spring breeze blows, and we need to remove roots.\" Jun Zhantian's face condensed slightly.He was afraid that Jun Xiaoyao would develop the habit of being arrogant and underestimating the enemy.It's not a wise decision to let the enemy go like this.\"Heh, don't worry, grandpa, grandson has his own plan.\" Jun Xiaoyao smiled.Doesn't Jun Xiaoyao know the truth of cutting grass and rooting out?But to him, Xiao Chen now has a leek-like existence, harvesting when he needs it.Jun Xiaoyao only harvested dragon energy, and it was far from the value of squeezing Xiao Chen's air.Harvesting crop after crop, isn't he fragrant?When there is no harvest value in the end, Jun Xiaoyao will naturally slap this fly.\"It's good if you have a plan in your heart, this kind of little person can't turn any waves, and there is still a year to prepare.\" Jun Zhantian said.Jun Xiaoyao nodded lightly.What Jun Zhantian is referring to is naturally his ten-year-old feast.When the time comes, the Jun family will invite all the forces of the Wild Heaven and Immortal Territory, and it will definitely be a feast that attracts worldwide attention.Even Jun Xiaoyao's mother clan, the Jiang family from the ancient aristocratic family, would send someone to come.and his mother Jiang Rou, who always wanted to push the pearl of the Jiang family to Jun Xiaoyao.In addition, the Jun family will also announce his serial number zero identity at his ten-year-old banquet.At that time, there must be another violent shock in the Jun family, and all major sequences will definitely respond.So Jun Zhantian wanted to prepare Jun Xiaoyao.\"Grandpa rest assured, I will never let you, my mother, and the Eighteenth Ancestor down.\" Jun Xiaoyao said with a certain tone.He did not forget that at the ten-year-old banquet, there was still a chance to sign in.The rewards he received at that time might be of great help to his improvement.\"Grandpa naturally believes in you.\" Jun Zhantian smiled with satisfaction.After the incident, Jun Xiaoyao also returned to the Heavenly Emperor Palace, preparing to completely refine this dragon energy.Bai Yuer is also temporarily staying in the Tiandi Palace.She also got a small part of the dragon energy, plus the Suzaku sacred fire she harbored.Bai Yuer's talent strength will skyrocket.The most important thing is that she has now followed Jun Xiaoyao with all her heart, and she has been branded by Jun Xiaoyao from the inside out.Even if Jun Xiaoyao asked her to die, Bai Yuer would not hesitate.Compared with Jun Xiaoyao, who is full of harvest.Xiao Chen is rather bleak at the moment.He slowly opened his eyes and found that he was already outside the Junjiashan Gate.\"Ahem...\"Xiao Chen got up with difficulty, his whole body was covered with wounds, and there were many internal injuries, his veins and veins were exhausted, and his bones were broken.can be said to be extremely miserable.Outside the gate of Jun's Mountain, there are also many monks watching the excitement.Xiao Chen, after all, entered the Jun's house very arrogantly.It didn't take long for him to be thrown out in such embarrassment.\"The prince of the ancient kingdom of Qinglong was abolished?\"\"It should be, it looks like a dog.\"\"Who would let him not have eyesight, and dare to provoke the son of the king's family, it is estimated that his fianc\u00e9e also ran away, deserve it!\"The monks who watched the excitement around him were all cynicism and contempt.Xiao Chen clenched his fists, and walked out step by step.When he was out of sight of the crowd, Xiao Chen screamed up to the sky, slamming his fists against the ancient tree in front of him.\"Damn it, Jun Xiaoyao, if there is a chance, I will pay you back thousands of times the pain today!\"Just as Xiao Chen roared, the blood on his body, unknowingly, soaked the Panlong ring between his fingers.\"I, the descendants of the ancient Qinglong country, are all like you without ambition?\"Suddenly, an old voice sounded.\"Who is it?\" Xiao Chen looked around.But the next moment, his gaze fell on the Panlong ring between his fingers.The ring suddenly flashed blue.Immediately, a phantom of an old man with white eyebrows wearing a cyan dragon robe suddenly flashed in front of Xiao Chen.\"You, you are...\" Xiao Chen widened his eyes and looked at the old man in front of him.On the head of the old man, there are still two dragon horns.In a daze, Xiao Chen felt as if he had seen this old man somewhere.\"Hehe, have posterity forgotten the old man?\" The old man in Qingpao Longjiao smiled.\"You are... the founding ancestor of the ancient Qinglong country, Master Qinglong!\" Xiao Chen suddenly flashed a flash of light in his mind, and then took a breath.He finally remembered.The appearance of this old man is exactly the same as the sculpture of the founding patriarch standing in the palace of the Qinglong ancient country!And this founding ancestor, Master Qinglong, according to historical records, is a quasi-supreme!With half a foot, I truly stepped into the realm of supremacy!What a powerful realm this is, it's just one step away from the real supreme realm.\"Xiao Chen, the prince of the ancient Qinglong country, I have seen the ancestor!\" Xiao Chen showed excitement and trembled all over.He didn't expect that the Panlong ring in the relic of the mother's queen actually lived in the soul of the founding ancestor.Sure enough, the sky is endless!Master Qinglong looked at Xiao Chen and said, \"This seat has already woken up a few years ago, and realized that you are the son of the nation's fortune in the ancient Qinglong country, so he sent you mana and various resources~www.mtlnovel.com~ Unexpectedly, you were still defeated by the prince's son.\"Xiao Chen heard this, with a feeling of resentment on his face, and said: \"Old ancestor, why didn't you just shoot and kill that gentleman Xiaoyao?\"\"Huh, ignorance, if you take action at that time, you and I will not get out of your house!\" Master Qinglong scolded.In fact, he has always been satisfied with Xiao Chen's performance, but now, Xiao Chen's heart is disturbed.\"Ancestor, you are a quasi-supreme, can't you still make the Jun family jealous?\" Xiao Chen asked unwillingly.Master Qinglong shook his head and said: \"Don't say that this seat is not one of ten strengths now. Even in its heyday, it can't help the Jun family. The ancient family is not as simple as you think.\"\"In this way, I won't be able to avenge myself for the rest of my life...\" Xiao Chen gritted his teeth.He was abolished by himself, and Master Qinglong could not help him.\"Don't be discouraged, you are the son of national luck, the ancient kingdom of Qinglong will still need you in the future, and this seat will not let you end in such a sad end.\" Master Qinglong said.\"Please ancestors for help, no matter what the price, the kid is willing!\" Xiao Chen's tone was categorical.The Master Qinglong's eyes showed relief, and he took out a cyan scroll.\"Although your muscles and veins cultivation base has been abolished, it is considered to be dependent on misfortune and blessing. This quasi-supreme technique, the Azure Dragon Transformation Technique, is the technique that this seat has practiced, and it just passed on to you.\"The blue sky transforms into a dragon, it won't break or stand!\"Xiao Chen heard the words, and the flame of hope reignited in his desperate eyes.The whole person seems to have recovered, with high morale!\"Jun Xiaoyao, your biggest mistake is to be too arrogant and complacent, letting me go!\"\"This hatred, Xiao Chen will surely give it back a hundred times!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It is located in the sphere of influence of the ancient royal family, the Zulong's Nest.The entire three thousand states, most of the states, are occupied by major forces.For example, the ancient country of Suzaku occupied the entire Huozhou.And Hongzhou is just one of the more than fifty Daozhou that Zulong's Nest masters.Yes, the ancient royal family of the Ancestral Dragon Nest alone owns more than fifty Daozhou territories.The ancient country of Suzaku only occupies one Daozhou.The gap between the first-class forces and the Taikoo royal family can be imagined.But the Jun family is even more terrifying, occupying hundreds of Daozhou, which is twice the size of the Ancestral Dragon Nest.Huangzhou is just the base camp of the Jun family.At this moment, in a big city in Hongzhou.Many kinds of human beings of different shapes are in constant contact.Some have black horns on their backs, some have wings on their backs, some have scales on their foreheads, and some have eyes like beast pupils.These creatures are all the immortal tens of thousands of people, and there are many kinds.The creatures of the ancient royal family are among them.In the territories of some ancient human families and immortal dynasties, there are most human beings.In the territory of the Primordial Royal Family, or some immortal races, strange creatures, there are most of the ten thousand peoples.Of course, the creatures of all races, including humans, can generally live in peace.On the streets of the city, the eyes of many creatures, UU reading www.uukanshu.com all looked at a woman in a blue skirt wearing a hood.Although her appearance is mostly hidden, she can also tell that she is a human race and she has a slim figure.Within the sphere of influence of the Primordial Royal Family, it does not mean that there is no human race, but it is very rare.The woman in the blue skirt lifted her head slightly, revealing a charming face.

Although it's pretty good, my brother has already combined three dragon yuan.\" Long Haotian smiled triumphantly.\"What, three dragon yuan!\"All the creatures present were shocked.The so-called Dragon Yuan refers to the flesh and blood essence left over by some of the strongest dragons after death.It not only contains the vigorous dragon essence blood, but also condenses various talents and supernatural powers, rune stigma.Although this type of dragon yuan is of infinite value, it is not that simple to refine it.Even some of the arrogances of the Ancestral Dragon Nest, wanting to merge a dragon yuan, are very reluctant, or even burst.Long Haotian's ability to fuse a dragon yuan is enough for him to show off.But that Long Aotian had already merged three dragon yuan.Seeing the shocked expressions of the surrounding creatures, Long Haotian smiled triumphantly: \"That's not a big deal, listen to my brother, his final goal is to gather seven dragon yuan in one body.\"\"At that time, add the blood of the gods dragon, this life's destiny will be governed by my brother!\"Long Haotian didn't mean to be jealous of Long Aotian, but rather admired him very much.\"Then congratulations in advance, but I have heard that the ten-year-old banquet of the son of the gentleman is approaching.\"said a strong young man with a tall man and horns.He is a powerful young man of the ancient royal family, Niu Moshan.The strength of the ancient royal family is not as good as the ancient royal family, but it is not much worse, and it can deter one party.Hearing the words Junjia Shenzi, many creatures present were silent.Although Jun Xiaoyao has not really been exposed before the eyes of the world.But ten years ago, the scene of the pilgrimage of Ten Thousand Saints still caused a shock in the Wild Heaven and Immortal Realm.After \u3000\u3000, although Jun Xiaoyao did not report any big news, no one dared to underestimate this low-key mysterious son of the Jun family.After all, he is the offspring of the White God King.\"Hmph, the son of the Jun family has not yet been born, who knows how many catties he has, although the pilgrimage of the Holy Spirit is not bad, but the day my brother was born, there was also an ancestral dragon vision, which is not inferior to him.\"\"Even, I can suppress it without my brother's action afterwards.\" Long Haotian's expression was contemptuous, and he couldn't help it.Ancestral Dragon's Nest and Jun's family have a long history of grievances.The most recent time was the white-clothed **** Wang Jun Wugui. When he was still in the realm of a saint, he took a quasi-supreme powerhouse from the Ancestral Dragon Nest, peeled the dragon skin, and cramped the dragon tendons.For the Ancestral Dragon Nest, it is simply a great shame, and it will be nailed to the pillar of shame in the Ancestral Dragon Nest history.A quasi-senior, who was completely abused by a saint, was ashamed and lost to his grandma's house.Since then, Zulong's Nest and Jun's family have completely forged an enemy.\"Hey, that's right, I believe that the prince's son is definitely not the opponent of Longzi.\" A woman of the Feather Human Race with white wings on her back laughed.\"Hey, I just don't know, what kind of physique is that king's son?\" A creature of the ancient royal family shook his head slightly.At this moment, a female voice suddenly came.\"I know what kind of constitution the son of the Jun family is.\"\"Who?\" The group of creatures looked together.At the entrance of the pavilion, a woman in a blue dress walked up the stairs.\"Well, how come the human race is here?\" The young brawny man from Niu Moshan frowned.The ancient royal family, although they wouldn't kill humans when they saw it, they didn't have much favor.\"Be safe, don't be impatient.\" Long Haotian lifted his palm and pressed it down, and a group of surrounding creatures fell silent.Long Haotian glanced at Lan Qingya, and said with a little interest: \"You said you know what kind of constitution is the son of the Jun family?\"\"Yes, I know, because I used to be a follower of the Jun family.\" Lan Qingya said confidently.\"what!\"These words shocked all living beings.The followers of the Jun family sequence, will they come to their Primordial race?Next, Lan Qingya briefly talked about his grievances with Jun Xiaoyao and others.\"So that's the case, then tell me, what kind of physique is the son of the king's family?\" Long Haotian said.\"Desolate Ancient Eucharist.\" Lan Qingya said.As soon as she spoke, the whole building was dead.All the creatures' faces were stagnant, and then suddenly laughed.\"Haha, ridiculous, what you said is true?\"\"The ancient sacrament, haha, the sacrament of the human race, now the sacred body!\"Long Haotian was also a little surprised. The dragon's eyes glared, and the suffocation surged and said: \"Do you know the consequences of deceiving this dragon?\"How can a body of chicken ribs get the attention of the Jun family?\"This matter is absolutely true, that Jun Xiaoyao is indeed a ridiculous ancient Eucharist, but it is a ridiculous ancient Eucharist that broke a chain.\" Lan Qingya continued to inform.\"What, broke a chain?\"\"How is this possible, he has this ability?\"Lan Qingya's words made the smiles on the faces of a group of Primordial creatures freeze, and their faces turned pale.The Human Eucharist that broke the shackles, that was extraordinary, it was terrifying.Long Haotian's expression didn't change much, and he groaned: \"With the background of the monarch, it is not impossible to forcibly pile up resources. UU reading www.uukanshu.com let him break the shackles, but this method does not work at all.\"\"At most three shackles are broken, and the road of Jun Xiaoyao will be completely sealed.\" Long Haotian sneered.The shackles of the ancient Eucharist, if it were so easy to break, would not be called a waste body now.\"It should be.\" Lan Qingya nodded.She only thinks that Jun Xiaoyao has broken a chain.But it is impossible to imagine that when Jun Xiaoyao was born, the ten chains had been broken.\"Haha, it's interesting. It seems that I might participate in the ten-year-old banquet of this gentleman's son.\" Long Haotian smiled.When the time comes, at the ten-year-old banquet held by the Jun's family, the son of the Jun's family will be trampled underfoot.That kind of scene.Thinking about it, it's exciting.\"Hehe, if the Lord Longzi goes out, the ten-year-old banquet of the son of the gentleman will become a feast of shame.\"\"Jun's family, it's time to be ashamed.\"The whole pavilion is filled with a relaxed and happy atmosphere.\"Jun Xiaoyao, you forced Qingya to do this, don't blame me then.\" Lan Qingya narrowed her beautiful eyes, flashing cold light.When the time comes, she will also follow Long Haotian to witness the moment of humiliation for Jun Xiaoyao and others.Not long after Lan Qingya told the secret.From the house of Emperor Huangzhou, a letter of invitation, tied to the golden flying sword, turned into a dense stream of light, violently surging in the wasteland.\"That's... Jun's Royal Sword Biography, it's an invitation letter!\"\"The mysterious **** son of the Jun family, is finally about to enter the world, is it displayed in front of everyone?\"For a while, the deserted fairyland, which had been silent for a long time, once again boiled with enthusiasm because of the royal sword handed down by the Jun family!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

If he is really rude and unobtrusive at the Jun family banquet, he is looking for death.But if it's just asking for advice, Ye Xingyun believes that the Jun family won't take him anything.As expected, even though Jun Zhantian and others frowned upon hearing Ye Xingyun's words, they didn't say anything.This is not because Ye Xingyun is backed by Huang Gu Ye Family, but Jun Zhantian and others, and they want to know how much progress Jun Xiaoyao has made for a year in retreat.\"You are...\" Jun Xiaoyao's expression is always calm.\"Ye Family, Ye Xingyun.\" Ye Xingyun looked directly at Jun Xiaoyao.\"Oh, you are the king of stars.\" Jun Xiaoyao suddenly.Some young princes of the ancient family, he still knows something.The Ancient Ye Family, the most famous taboo Tianjiao, should be the reincarnation of the legendary sword demon, Ye Guchen.Holding a Slayer Sword, sweeping the peerless kendo evildoer of the invincible young generation of Xianyu.It is rumored that he has never played a second sword against his peer Tianjiao.Because no one can take his first sword.And this Ye Xingyun, with a star king body, is not bad, but it cannot be compared with Ye Guchen.If Ye Guchen is here, Jun Xiaoyao might also raise some interest.As for Ye Xingyun...Jun Xiaoyao really looks down upon him.\"No need, Jun Mou is mediocre and there is no need to compete.\"Jun Xiaoyao shook his head, too lazy to take action against Ye Xingyun, and found a lame excuse at will.Hearing Jun Xiaoyao's words, some big figures in the power had different eyes.To tell the truth, Jun Xiaoyao's debut really shocked them, with a deep breath and aloof temperament, just like the same statue in Linchen.But now, in the face of Ye Xingyun's provocation, Jun Xiaoyao didn't even make a move, and instead said that his strength was average.Is that really the case?The son of the Jun's family is just a silver spear tip?And when Jun Zhanjian and others heard this, their expressions were sweaty.God is so ordinary!\"If the Xiaoyao clan brother is mediocre, wouldn't I want to shoot myself to death with a piece of tofu.\" Jun Zhanjian said in embarrassment.However, Ye Xingyun did not know the true strength of Jun Xiaoyao.The vision of Jun Xiaoyao's breakthrough before can only make Ye Xingyun pay more attention to it.Now, seeing Jun Xiaoyao unwilling to make a move, Ye Xingyun felt anxious.If Jun Xiaoyao doesn't make a move, how can he pretend to be in front of Jiang Luoli?After thinking for a while, Ye Xingyun said: \"The **** son does not have to be self-effacing. If you are not in a realm enough, then Ye can suppress the realm at the peak of the palace realm and fight with you.\"In Ye Xingyun's view, the ten-year-old Jun Xiaoyao, no matter how enchanting he is, at most only has the cultivation base of the Divine Palace Realm.And Ye Xingyun himself, sixteen or seventeen years old, is already a master of the Five Heavens.Hearing what Ye Xingyun said, everyone in the hall cast their eyes on Jun Xiaoyao.If Jun Xiaoyao still doesn't agree, then it would be controversial.Jun Xiaoyao sighed secretly.He was too lazy to slap him, but someone wanted to send him a slap.He looked at Jiang Luoli on the side, and probably knew what Ye Xingyun was doing.The roots of troubles!\"Are you annoying, why do you keep talking about Brother Xiaoyao?\"Jiang Luoli, the little girl is unhappy.She also wants to have a good chat with Jun Xiaoyao and exchange feelings.As a result, Ye Xingyun didn't know what was good or bad, so he intervened.\"Luo Li, I just want to...\"Ye Xingyun's face turned blue, and Jiang Luoli even called Xiaoyao's brother.Jiang Luoli said impatiently: \"What are you thinking about, you broke Xiaoyao's face, will you pay?\"\"What am I...\" Ye Xingyun choked his throat, his face flushed, and he almost couldn't help but swear.Being handsome is superior to others, can you do whatever you want?Ye Xingyun felt even more jealous.Jun Xiaoyao was also speechless, Jiang Luoli could almost serve as the president of the Appearance Association.\"No, since you have to discuss with this **** son, then take action.\" Jun Xiaoyao put one hand behind him, and said plainly.\"Brother Xiaoyao, you...\" Jiang Luoli hesitated.She was also a little worried that Jun Xiaoyao would be suppressed by Ye Xingyun.\"Tsk tsk, Luo Li is now worried about her future husband-in-law?\" Jiang Shengyi showed his teeth, UU reading www.uukanshu.

sequences, there is another position...\"Jun Zhantian's words made everyone in the hall condensed, and then their expressions suddenly changed as if thinking of something.The two sequences of Jun Zhanjian and Jun Xuehuang also thought of something, and suddenly stood up, their expressions were shocked and incredible.Jun Wanjie's expression became even more condensed.\"My Jun Family, God Zi Jun Xiaoyao, will be Jun Family's zero number sequence, and its status will be above the top ten sequences!\"fell, and the scene was silent.Everyone is shocked!What the zero number sequence means, everyone knows.Because of the zero number sequence of the previous generation of the Jun family, he is the father of Jun Xiaoyao, the white-clothed **** Wang Jun has no regrets!The news announced by Jun Zhantian was like a huge rock falling into the ocean, setting off a huge wave.It is conceivable that after this news spreads today, the entire Wild Heaven and Immortal Realm will be a sensation!After all, the zero number sequence of Jun's family is of extraordinary significance.If there are no accidents, he will grow up in the future, he will be the core figure of the Jun family, and the pillar-like existence.Even the first sequence, in terms of status, is slightly weaker than the zero sequence.\"Xiaoyao Clan brother is already in the default zero sequence?\" Jun Zhanjian took a deep breath, suppressing his shock.Because of him, he thought that after Jun Xiaoyao was ten years old, he might join the sequence competition.As a result, people don't have to join the competition at all, and it has been set as the zero sequence early on.Although Jun Zhanjian was shocked, he was not jealous.After all, he has personally experienced Jun Xiaoyao's strength, and he is indeed qualified to become the zero sequence.\"Unexpectedly, the **** child is already in the zero sequence.\" Jun Xuehuang's chest was up and down, and he was also surprised.And that Jun Wanjie, his fist clenched tightly, there seemed to be a vast intertwining of thunder and light in his eyes, indicating his inner unrest.\"Why...\" Jun Wanjie said coldly.Jun Xiaoyao can get what he has to work hard to get.I don't care if I am a child of God, now even the supreme serial number zero identity is directly given to Jun Xiaoyao.Such a arrogant as Jun Wanjie, just competing for a sequence identity, has gone through many hard tests, and finally stood out among the many princes.Jun Wanjie is unwilling, unfair, and unhappy!Jun Zhantian glanced around, looked at the awe in shock, and nodded in satisfaction.This is the effect he wants.After the ten-year-old banquet, it's time for Jun Xiaoyao to join the world.Before entering the WTO, the Jun family wanted to build momentum for Jun Xiaoyao.Serial number zero identity is undoubtedly the fastest way to make Jun Xiaoyao famous.\"Is this to let the son inherit the inheritance of his father?\" Many people looked at Jun Xiaoyao's eyes and began to change.Jun Xiaoyao's father, Jun Wuhui, was in the zero sequence of the previous generation, and now he has also become the zero sequence.Just being a son of God makes Jun Xiaoyao too expensive.Now add the zero number serial identity.Double identities are superimposed, I am afraid that not many people dare to provoke Jun Xiaoyao.\"Brother Xiaoyao is still the zero sequence?\"Jiang Luoli put her small face out of Jiang Shengyi's arms and blinked.One of her most admired characters is Jun Xiaoyao's father, the white-clothed **** Wang Junwugui.Now that Jun Xiaoyao has inherited his father's inheritance, it is even more charming that Jun Xiaoyao is the next king in white clothes.\"But Brother Xiaoyao spanked me, and said I was short, so bad...\" Jiang Luoli muttered.Although she is a little bit angry with Jun Xiaoyao, she is really handsome if she can't stand Jun Xiaoyao.Regardless of strength, status, background, appearance, almost unparalleled in the world.Jiang Luoli can't get rid of the law of true fragrance.Jiang Rou showed a trace of reminiscence and emotion in her eyes, muttering to herself, \"No regrets, have you seen it, our children have now become the zero sequence...\"Just when all the forces were in shock.A cold voice sounded.\"Clan elders, I have a question below.\"Upon hearing this voice, the expressions of both Jun Zhanjian and Jun Xuehuang changed.Jun Zhantian also cast his eyes, and then secretly frowned ~www.mtlnovel.com~ The person who made the sound was not someone else, it was the fifth sequence, Jun Wanjie.Jun Xiaoyao's gaze is also staring, his face blank.The identity of the zero number sequence, he must.If Jun Wanjie does not know each other, Jun Xiaoyao will not give in.\"What's the problem with you?\" Jun Zhantian said lightly.\"Dare to ask Jun Xiaoyao, have you ever participated in sequence competition?\" Jun Wanjie asked in a deep voice.\"Never.\" Jun Zhantian replied.\"Dare to ask Jun Xiaoyao, did you make a significant contribution to the family?\" Jun Wanjie continued to ask.\"Never.\" Jun Zhantian's face sank.Jun Xiaoyao has not yet entered the world to walk, how can he create merits for the Jun family?\"Dare to ask Jun Xiaoyao, have you ever passed five levels, beheaded six generals, and won the rank by yourself?\" Jun Wanjie asked three times in a row.\"Never!\" Jun Zhantian's voice was slightly cold.If people from other forces questioned this way, Jun Zhantian would have slapped him out.But the person who made the voice is the fifth sequence of the Jun family. If you act on him, the Jun family's face will not be able to survive.\"If this is the case, how can Jun Xiaoyao and how can he become the zero sequence for no reason?!\"Jun Wanjie suddenly stood up and asked harshly!The violent thunder and lightning flashes in his eyes endlessly!around, the atmosphere is dead!Rao is Jun Zhantian, and for a while, he couldn't say much.While in such a dead silence, Jun Xiaoyao stepped out one step and stood with his hands behind him, as if he was in white clothes and was in the dust.\"Since you have so many questions, then Jun will tell you.\"\"The zero serial identity was given by the eighteen ancestors.

If they are not with a heavy pupil, they have some kind of taboo inheritance.Jun Xiaoyao naturally knows that those sequences are not simple.But he believes that with his natural strength, any trouble will be settled.Next, the banquet continued.Jun Xiaoyao is thinking about why the system has not prompted to sign in.And just at this moment, a voice with arrogance and cold play suddenly sounded in the sky outside the Junjia Mountain Gate.\"The son of the Jun family, the tone is really rampant, I don't know if your strength is worthy of your tone?\"Hearing this voice, everyone in the hall trembled.Who is this voice?Dare to say this at the ten-year-old banquet of the son of the Jun family.Finding death is not such a way to die!Outside the hall, many people from the forces looked at the sky outside the hall.But seeing the sky in the distance, a flood dragon with blue wings on its back crossed the sky, and a group of people stood on it.has double horns on the head, or wings on the back, or has scales on its body.

That was the battle of Jun Wugui's fame.\"Huh, it's really bad luck.\" Jun Zhantian's face was solemn.It's impossible for them to invite Zulong's Nest to a banquet.\"Why, the dignified ancient family, don't you even dare to let people enter?\" Long Haotian said in a frantic tone.As soon as these words came out, the sequence of Jun Zhanjian, Jun Xuehuang, etc., all burst into anger.This Ancestral Dragon Nest Longzi is really arrogant.\"Grandpa, let them in, just a few loaches.\"Jun Xiaoyao stood with his hands in his hands, his expression calm and indifferent.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

At the ten-year-old banquet of the son of the Jun family, he stepped on the feet of the son of the Jun family to promote the prestige of the Ancestral Dragon Nest.After all, before, the reputation of Zulong's Nest was not very good.The ancestor dragon's nest was torn to the quasi-superior in the realm of a saint without regrets, and the ancestral dragon's nest became the laughingstock of the ridiculous fairyland.Although no power dared to talk in front of the people in the Ancestral Dragon Nest, they were taunting the Ancestral Dragon Nest secretly.Therefore, Long Haotian also wanted to give a tooth for a tooth, stepping on the offspring of Jun Wugui under his feet.And Long Haotian also has this confidence.He has merged a dragon yuan, although it is not fully refined, but it is enough to stand on top of the young generation.Except for a few Tianjiao Supreme, he is not afraid of anyone.Under Jun Zhantian's acquiescence, the doorman of Jun's house did not prevent Long Haotian and others from entering.In addition to Long Haotian, some young Tianjiao from the Primordial family also followed.Although the Taikoo royal family is a little weaker, it is also a top power.Unlike Long Haotian, these Primordial royal clan creatures still feel a little guilty in their hearts.After all, the Jun's family is a wild ancient family and has a reputation outside. It can be regarded as one of the most famous and prosperous ancient family.Their actions are tantamount to provocation.But with Long Haotian standing in front of him, these Primordial royal clan creatures still settled their minds.When the sky fell, there was a high bear, what are they afraid of?Here, Jun Xiaoyao's gaze is faint, and he swept across Long Haotian and others.Suddenly, he found a slightly familiar figure.A woman with a blue dress and a charming face followed Long Haotian, her eyes faintly spiteful, staring at Jun Xiaoyao and Jun Linglong.\"is her?\"Jun Xiaoyao raised his eyebrows slightly.He saw a figure that he thought he would never see again.\"It's you, Lan Qingya, what's going on?\"On the other side, after Jun Zhuangjian's gaze swept over, his face was slightly surprised, and he couldn't help but shout.Didn't he expelled Lan Qingya from Jun's house, but why did he appear next to Long Haotian now?Hearing Jun Zhanjian's scolding, the corner of Long Haotian's mouth suddenly stirred up a hint of playfulness.In front of Jun Zhanjian, he stretched out his hand and provoked Lan Qingya's white chin, and said provocatively: \"What are you talking about, she is my slave girl now, don't you think so?\"\"Yes, Qingya is Master Longzi's slave girl.\" Lan Qingya obediently said.\"You bitch!\" Jun Zhuangjian's black hair fluttered, his face was cold, his eyes flashed with killing intent.Because he missed the feelings of the past, he just drove away Lan Qingya without making any difficulties.As a result, Lan Qingya is now attracting people from the Ancestral Dragon Nest.You need to know that her previous identity was a follower of Jun Zhanjian.When this kind of thing happened, how would the senior members of the Jun family treat him?Plus, Long Haotian borrowed the advantage of Lan Qingya to slap the monarch's face.Where did he put his sword's face?Jun Zhanjian's heart sank when he thought of this.From the corner of his eyes, he has already seen faintly, and the faces of the old family members are a little calm.This kind of contest of the younger generation, their older generation is not easy to intervene, it will fall into fame.\"Damn, if this matter is not handled properly, my serial identity may not be preserved.\" Jun Zhanjian clenched his fist tightly.Just as Jun Zhanjian's face changed from time to time, Jun Xiaoyao stepped out in a calm tone.\"Unexpectedly, Longzi from Zulong's Nest still has this hobby.\"\"Hobby?\" Long Haotian frowned and looked at Jun Xiaoyao.This handsome and disrespectful boy is the target he wants to step on today.\"I didn't expect you to have a hobby of picking up worn shoes.\"\"You are willing to accept and tolerate people whom I don't want in the family sequence. You are really an old man.\"Jun Xiaoyao is an understatement.But when he heard this, Long Haotian's eyes stared, his face immediately turned green, and he became extremely ugly.Doesn't this mean that he Long Haotian is picking up garbage that others don't want?Lan Qingya's face was also pale as paper, her fingers trembling with shame and anger.There is no woman who wants to be called a broken shoe by others.Jun Xiaoyao's simple two sentences immediately turned the situation over.It was Long Haotian who wanted to humiliate the Jun family sequence, but now, he is actually laughed at.Many people from the surrounding forces did not dare to laugh at Long Haotian on the face, but they also showed ridicule and contempt in their eyes.\"The Son of God...\" Jun Zhanjian's heart was shocked.Jun Xiaoyao is helping him out.When I thought of this, Jun Zhanjian looked at Jun Xiaoyao, with a faint gratitude.Jun Xiaoyao's words resolved his embarrassment and crisis.\"It's all my family, don't say anything extra.\" Jun Xiaoyao smiled lightly.The king nodded his head heavily, but he had a decision in his heart.Jun Xiaoyao deserves his allegiance to follow!\"The **** son is really unfathomable, and in a few words, he resolved the predicament of the sword sword...\" Jun Xuehuang whispered in his heart.Jun Xiaoyao's intelligence on the spot is not like what a ten-year-old should have.\"Wow, I saw the other side of Brother Xiaoyao...\" Jiang Luoli exclaimed.Jun Xiaoyao not only looks like an immortal, but also has great strength.

On the contrary, it is a waste of time.\" Eighteen ancestors explained.Jun Xiaoyao quite agrees.There is no person with extraordinary talents and understanding, it is indeed futile and a waste of time to practice the Slaying Sword Art.But it is a pity that Jun Xiaoyao is just a man with a genius and understanding.\"The ancestor, this slaughter of the immortal sword art...\" Jun Xiaoyao stopped.\"I didn't give it to you before because I was afraid of delaying your cultivation, but now, you are about to go out and walk the world, and you really need a hand of cards. Although the ancient sacrament and the supreme bone are strong, the martial arts and supernatural powers are not necessary.\" Eighteen ancestors warned.Next, the Eighteenth Ancestor passed the Slaying Immortal Sword Art to Jun Xiaoyao.Slaying the Immortal Sword Jue is divided into three types.The first type of Xianyu is a sword of mana, aimed at the body of the flesh.The second type of immortality is the sword of the soul, aimed at the **** of the palace.And the last style is to kill immortals, it is a sword that combines spirit and body, that is, the eighteen ancestors, three swords kill the quasi-sovereign move.\"With these three tricks, if you can complete the first type of entry within three years, it will be possible to completely practice successfully.\" Eighteenth Ancestor said with a light smile.\"Yes.\" Jun Xiaoyao nodded, but thought to himself.\"Three years, I can't wait so long...\"The Eighteenth Ancestor looked at Jun Xiaoyao, and after hesitating for a while, he spoke again: \"Xiaoyao, there are two things to tell you.\"\"The ancestors say it's okay.\" Jun Xiaoyao said.\"When you wait for your eighteen-year-old coming-of-age ceremony, the old ancestor will tell you that the secret deeds behind my Jun's family and your father's affairs.\"Jun Xiaoyao heard the words, his eyes shook.The secret behind Jun's house?Jun Xiaoyao is also very curious, what kind of secret story is behind such a powerful and brilliant Jun family?But the most important thing is that his father Jun Wu regrets!With the words \"God King in White Clothes\", Jun Xiaoyao can almost hear her ears.What kind of person is his father and why doesn't he go back?What happened back then?\"It's too early for you to know this. The old man will tell you everything during the coming-of-age ceremony.\" Eighteen ancestors said.Jun Xiaoyao nodded slightly, and did not question.The current him, among the young Tianjiao, is indeed sweeping everywhere.But I still don't have the ability to touch these secrets.In the following time, Jun Xiaoyao stayed beside the Eighteenth Ancestor, and the Eighth Ancestor personally explained the Slaughter Fairy Sword Art for Jun Xiaoyao.At that time, the eighteen ancestors practiced the Slaughter Immortal Sword Art, and they started in one year.But three months later.In the ancestral land of Jun's family, Jun Xiaoyao raised his hand, and the vast golden mana surging out.He also pointed to the sword, and a dazzling sword light appeared out of the sky, and there seemed to be phantom gods around him.The sword light swept away, as if trying to kill the stars outside the sky, the void was shaking, and the clouds in the sky collapsed!rumbling!After \u3000\u3000 the sword light swept through, a large cloud was cut in half, and the remaining sword aura violently rushed in all directions, alarming many elders and big figures in the Jun family.\"That is... the breath of the Slaughter Immortal Sword Art. Is it the Eighteen Ancestor?\"\"No, although the power of this sword light is amazing, it still doesn't reach the height of the eighteenth ancestor. It is a son of God!\"Many elders and disciples of the monarch family were stunned.It's only been three months, right?Jun Xiaoyao is not only getting started, but can even directly perform the first style of the Slaughter Sword Art.In the ancestral land, the Eighteenth ancestor looked at Jun Xiaoyao, but was slightly stunned for a while, not knowing what expression to show.\"The first style actually took three months, this slaughter the sword art is really difficult to learn.\" Jun Xiaoyao shook his head and sighed.It wasn't that he was deliberately pretentious, but that Jun Xiaoyao had practiced martial arts supernatural powers before, and he had never been longer than seven days.In contrast, it took only three months to cultivate the first formula of the Slaying Immortal Sword Art, which was indeed slow.\"Cough...\" Eighth Ancestor's expression was unnatural.\"Ancestor, what's the matter?\" Jun Xiaoyao said.\"No, nothing, ancestor, I want to lie back in the coffin to sleep.\" Eighteen ancestors said.With Jun Xiaoyao, even the Dao Heart of the Eighteen Ancestors is beginning to be a little unstable, and I need to calm my mind.\"Thank you ancestors for giving me the trick, and I will retire freely.\"Jun Xiaoyao is also very witty, no longer disturbing the eighteen ancestors.After coming out of the ancestral land, Jun Xiaoyao went straight to the Heavenly Emperor Palace.To his relief, Jiang Luoli finally left.He really has no interest in such a little girl.And when Jun Xiaoyao stepped into the Heavenly Emperor Palace, he found that Jun Zhantian was waiting for him.\"Have you learned the Slaughter Fairy Sword Art?\" Jun Zhantian asked.\"Reluctantly, first style.\" Jun Xiaoyao said.\"It's really a little monster...\" Jun Zhantian secretly said, and then said: \"Grandpa didn't expect that you still hid a piece of supreme bone.\"Jun Xiaoyao's face remained the same, but he thought to himself~www.mtlnovel.com~ This is simply the bone from signing in.But after getting it, it's actually no different from Jun Xiaoyao's own natural bone.\"Is grandpa doing anything?\" Jun Xiaoyao asked.Jun Zhantian will not come to him for no reason.Jun Zhantian said: \"Xiaoyao, although you have two top physiques, you need to pay twice as much energy to cultivate, especially the ancient sacrament. You have already awakened the first vision when you were born. But the ancient sacrament has six great visions.\"Jun Zhantian's words made Jun Xiaoyao fall into contemplation.Indeed, the cultivation of the ancient sacrament is even a bit more difficult than the supreme bone.The opening of the vision is not a simple matter.Jun Xiaoyao's talent is evil, but after all, there must be a process.\"Grandpa may know where it is possible to speed up your comprehension of the second eucharistic vision.\" Jun Zhantiandao.\"Oh?\" Jun Xiaoyao raised his eyebrows, is there such a place?\"Have you heard of Panwu Shenchao?\" Jun Zhantiandao.\"Panwu God Dynasty, that seems to be a top power of the immortal God Dynasty level.\" Jun Xiaoyao said.In his spare time, he also read the classics, and he still has a certain understanding of the major forces in the Wild Heaven and Immortal Realm.\"Yes, the founder of the Panwu God Dynasty was a great emperor named Panwu Great, but this is not important. The important thing is that he is also rumored to be carrying the ancient sacrament...\"\"It is rumored that there is a Panwu Mausoleum in the depths of the Palace of the Panwu God Dynasty, which may have something to do with Emperor Panwu...\"Just as Jun Zhantian's voice fell, Jun Xiaoyao's mind again heard the mechanical sound of the system.\"Ding! Congratulations to the host, the new sign-in location has been refreshed!\"\"Please sign in at Panwuling!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It just tells you that there is this way. If it really doesn't work, it's not impossible to force in for your future.\" Jun Zhantian said domineeringly.\"I'll talk about it later.\" Jun Xiaoyao was speechless.The domineering of the Jun family seems to be innate.But if possible, Jun Xiaoyao still wants to solve these things by himself.\"The Great Emperor Panwu is an ancient sacrament. If I can get some information, it can save me many detours.\" Jun Xiaoyao murmured.The ancient Communion is extremely rare, and it is difficult to produce a few in one era.And the ancient sacrament that proves Tao Chengdi is even rarer.Not everyone is like Jun Xiaoyao, who has the ability to open and break the ten chains at birth.In the era of Panwu Great Emperor, perhaps cultivating the ancient sacrament is not as difficult as it is now, but it is never easy to break through the great sacrament.\"Pan Wuling? If I have a chance in the future, I really want to see it.\" Jun Xiaoyao thought to himself.After \u3000\u3000, Jun Xiaoyao continued to practice in the Tiandi Palace.There is a faint hunch in his heart that the Yuantian Supreme Secret Vault is likely to be opened within a few years.So before this, Jun Xiaoyao needs to continue to improve his strength.Time is faint, and a year passed in a blink of an eye.Jun Xiaoyao is eleven years old, but from the outside, he looks like a fifteen or sixteen-year-old boy.The figure is long and radiant, the fairy is handsome, and the temperament is dusty. It makes people feel ashamed at a glance, afraid that their eyes will stain the sacred transcendence of Jun Xiaoyao.Within this year, Jun Xiaoyao's cultivation reached the Great Perfection in the Divine Bridge Realm, and it seemed that his improvement was not high.But the main reason is that he will spend all his energy on cultivating the magical powers.His Immortal Slaying Sword Art, after completing the second form, at this speed, the Eighteenth Ancestor would be speechless and sigh again and again.Supreme Bone, after absorbing a lot of divine essence, it also transformed into a complete great supernatural power, the hand of God.This is the complete version of God's Tribulation.There is also Long Yuan, which has been completely digested by Jun Xiaoyao. The majestic dragon qi and blood has made Jun Xiaoyao awaken 20,000 giant elephant particles again.Now he has awakened seventy thousand giant elephant particles, which is seven hundred million catties.You know, this still doesn't count the power of the Ancient Eucharist.Jun Xiaoyao has always been using the power of the gods to suppress the prison. As for the ability of the ancient sacrament itself, it is more reflected in the level of immortality of the flesh.Of course, if Jun Xiaoyao really uses the power of the ancient sacrament, it will only be more terrifying.In addition, Jun Xiaoyao also obtained the martial arts supernatural powers of the Zulong Nest, such as the Dragon Dragon Hand, the Dragon Fist, and the True Dragon Sleeping Heaven Technique from the stripped Long Yuan.The only thing that made him a little pity was that there was no real dragon supernatural power in this Long Yuan.\"Hey, it's a bit boring to always practice, and I miss Xiao Chen a little...\" Jun Xiaoyao sighed slightly.I wonder if Xiao Chen has nourished it?Jun Xiaoyao seems to have seen a lush green leek field...Kunzhou is one of the three thousand states in the wilderness of the fairyland.This state is remote, and the environment is barren, stray bandits are rampant, monsters prey on the sky, and the living soil is extremely harsh.This state is not occupied by any major forces, it is obviously an abandoned land.But it is also because this state is quite dangerous and the environment is dangerous, so it has become a small well-known place of experience.Many young disciples of the Taoist forces like to come to Queensland to practice.At this moment, in a rather dangerous mountain range in Queensland.\"Blue Dragon tears the sky hand!\"But with a sharp shout, a figure that looked like a half-dragon, shook the wings of the blue dragon, turned its palms into claws, and stuck out.In a short time, hundreds of blue dragon light patterns burst out, as if turned into a hand that tears the sky, and directly violently tore the monster beast in front of it into pieces.The rain of blood was flying, and the flesh and blood of the monster beast splashed around.The half-dragon figure, the cyan dragon scales on the surface and the wings converging on the back, revealed a handsome and handsome young man, it was Xiao Chen.It has been three years since he was driven out of Jun's house by Jun Xiaoyao in embarrassment.The youth of the year also grew up as a youth.Xiao Chen's muscles and veins, although they were abandoned by Jun Xiaoyao.But because of a blessing in disguise, he practiced the Azure Dragon Transformation Art. Now he is stronger and has reached the middle stage of the Divine Bridge Realm. Even after performing the Azure Dragon Transformation, even the monsters of the Returning Realm can be killed.\"Yes, in just a few years, you can cultivate the Azure Dragon Transformation Art to the fourth level, you are worthy of being the son of the national fortune of my ancient country.\"In the void beside Xiao Chen, there appeared a phantom of an old man wearing a cyan dragon robe with first-born dragon horns, who was the remnant soul of the founding ancestor of the ancient Qinglong country, the Master Qinglong.His eyes looked at Xiao Chen, full of admiration.The Azure Dragon Transformation Technique is extremely difficult to practice, even if it was his practice, it took a lot of time.But Xiao Chen's rate of improvement is far surpassing him back then.It can be said that if there is no accident at UU Reading www.uukanshu.com, Xiao Chen will definitely become a famous figure in the Three Thousand Dao Prefecture in the future.When Xiao Chen heard the words, not only was there no joy on his face, but there was hatred and coldness on his face.\"Thirty years in Hedong and 30 years in Hexi. I told Na Jun Xiaoyao that he would fight again after three years, but he regarded me as a joke!\"\"Three years have passed, I want Na Jun Xiaoyao to know who is the real joke!\"Xiao Chen was full of vigor and vigor, as if he had seen himself stepping on Jun Xiaoyao under his feet.There is also Bai Yuer, and he wants that **** to regret it.Just when Xiao Chen was **** in his heart, there was movement from a distance.\"Xiao Chen, there is movement there, be careful.\" Master Qinglong returned to the Panlong ring and said through the voice.Xiao Chen condensed his eyebrows and swept away carefully.He stared at it and condensed.But I saw a woman dressed in a long skirt and a white gauze mask, who was being chased by a group of bandits.That group of bandits are small and famous demon wolf thieves in Queensland.\"Hey, beauty, you run, no one in the area of Queensland can get rid of my wolf thief.\" The bandit leader sneered.His cultivation level has also reached the state of return.\"Damn it, I can't use the cultivation base, otherwise, they will notice it, and then I will be taken back.\"The masked woman was secretly angry.She ran out by stealth. If she uses inheritance techniques and martial arts, she will be sensed by her guardians.\"Beauty, you scream, no one will help you even if you pierce your throat.\" The bandit leader smiled evilly.At this moment, a figure suddenly rushed out with a cold voice.\"Let go of that girl!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She has something on her body that can even conceal my detection. She is definitely the proud woman of a certain immortal tradition. If you have a good relationship with her, you will deal with you in the future. The house goddess will be very helpful.\"The words of Master Qinglong made Xiao Chen's heart moved.He asked himself, he is not the kind of despicable person who uses others.But in order to deal with Jun Xiaoyao, in order to wash away the shame of three years ago, he did everything.\"This girl, are you okay?\" Xiao Chen stepped forward and smiled.The delicate and clean smile makes the white gauze masked woman feel more at ease.And Xiao Chen is also looking at the masked woman.Although the woman's face is covered with white gauze, she has a pair of cut water and double pupils, and her eyelashes are slender, and she is a beautiful woman at first glance.This made Xiao Chen even more determined that he must get the favor of this woman.And then, naturally it is a routine.The woman concealed her identity, only saying that she was going out to practice.And Xiao Chen also briefly explained his situation.\"It turned out to be the great prince of the ancient Qinglong country.\" The masked woman murmured in her heart.One of the ancient kingdoms of the Four Elephants, Qinglong Ancient Country, she knew it, and it was considered a first-class force.But compared with the forces behind her, it is not comparable.Because of the forces behind her, but immortal gods!Next, Xiao Chen and the masked woman went all the way to experience and practice together in Queensland.The relationship is getting closer and closer.Although the masked woman did not have any intimate behavior with Xiao Chen because of the other relationship between men and women.But between words, they are already very good friends.Even if it is Master Qinglong, I have to sigh.Xiao Chen deserves to be the son of luck, the protagonist of the destiny, and even the relationship between women has such opportunities.Once late at night, Xiao Chen was by the fire, roasting chicken for a masked woman.He also knew the name of the masked woman, Wu Mingyue.\"Here, Mingyue, here you are!\" Xiao Chen handed a roasted chicken leg to Wu Mingyue.Wu Mingyue stretched out her jade hand to take it, and then took off the white veil on her face.Suddenly, a beautiful face that looked like a dream was reflected in Xiao Chen's eyes.The eyes are like autumn water, Gu Pan is full of beauty, snow-skinned and beautiful, and beauty comes out of dust.Rao is Xiao Chen, who is slightly stunned.He had never seen such a beautiful woman in his life.\"What are you looking at?\" Wu Mingyue's jade face was slightly reddish, her jade fingers tore the chicken thighs, but her heart could not help beating.To be honest, Xiao Chen and those young talents she had met before, neither background nor appearance was dominant.But for some reason, she just liked Xiao Chen's straightforward and simple character.At this time, Xiao Chen's heart also jumped slightly.\"Although the **** Bai Yuer abandoned me, it made me meet something better. Is this destiny?\"Xiao Chen thought to himself, and he became more determined to attack Wu Mingyue.He deliberately sighed slightly, his expression is rare in decline.\"Xiao Chen, what's the matter with you?\" Wu Mingyue noticed and asked.\"It's nothing, I just thought of my sad fianc\u00e9.\" Xiao Chen sighed deeply.is like a betrayed affectionate person.\"It turns out that he is also a person with a story.\" Wu Mingyue murmured.Next, Xiao Chen added fuel and jealousy and began to tell his story.He had a passion for Bai Yuer, but Bai Yuer betrayed him and fell into the arms of the enemy.He went to the door to ask for an explanation, but was crushed by the enemy with his power, and in the end even the whole body meridians were abolished.Then I was alone, gritted his teeth and practiced alone, seeking revenge.This is simply the story of the protagonist of the destiny in the novel.\"Xiao Chen, I didn't expect you to have such a past.\"Hearing Xiao Chen's words, Wu Mingyue couldn't help but feel a trace of distress for Xiao Chen.At the same time, he was very disgusted with the enemy who bullied him.\"Your enemy is really disgusting. What kind of force is he and does he need Mingyue's help?\" Wu Mingyue said.Xiao Chen was slightly happy, isn't this the effect he wanted?Master Qinglong said that behind Wu Mingyue, there may be an immortal tradition.In that case, you can definitely compete with the Jun family.But Xiao Chen didn't say it directly, but said with a firm face: \"No need, my hatred, I have to repay it by myself, how can I rely on others?\"Xiao Chen's words made Wu Mingyue admire even more.I also became more determined about Wu Mingyue's intention to help Xiao Chen~www.mtlnovel.com~Xiao Chen, needless to say, no matter what your enemy's identity and background, Mingyue is not afraid of him. If he dares to overwhelm others, Mingyue will definitely make him understand what regret is! \"Wu Mingyue's tone showed a rare touch of nobility and domineering.What is her identity?The eldest princess of the immortal dynasty, her identity is amazing!She is confident, even if Xiao Chen's enemy is an immortal patriot of heaven, in front of her, she can only bow her head.In Huangtian Immortal Realm, there are not many Tianjiao who are taller than her.\"Mingyue, thank you so much.\" Xiao Chen showed a touch of emotion.Wu Mingyue nodded slightly.She has made up her mind.If there is a chance to run into Xiao Chen's enemy later, she doesn't mind getting rid of it!Huangzhou, the residence of the monarch, in the palace of the Emperor of Heaven.Jun Xiaoyao, who was practicing, suddenly felt something and opened his eyes.\"How do I feel, someone wants to harm me?\" Jun Xiaoyao murmured.But he smiled instead.There are quite a few people who want to harm him.People from the Ancestral Dragon Nest, Xiao Chen, Ye Xingyun and even Jun Wanjie are all possible.But Jun Xiaoyao doesn't mind this, anyway, no one can threaten him.At this moment, outside the Palace of the Emperor of Heaven, the sound of the king's sword rang out.\"The king holds the sword to see the Lord of God!\"\"Come in.\" Jun Xiaoyao said.After a short while, Jun Zhuangjian walked in, with a hint of excitement on his face.\"Brother Zhanjian, what happened?\" Jun Xiaoyao smiled lightly.\"God, Yuantian Supreme Secret Store, there is news!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It has a certain attraction to immortal orthodoxy, let alone those subordinate forces.For a time, the entire three thousand states of the Wild Heaven and Immortal Realm were all surging.It is conceivable that this will be a grand gathering of Tianjiao, the stage for the game of various forces.Kunzhou, outside a mountain range.Xiao Chen and Wu Mingyue appeared.Xiao Chen had inquired about it before, and the Yuantian Supreme Secret Store had been born in Daozhou of Nanyuan.Master Qinglong has also been telling him that he must win the ancient dragon bones in the secret store.So he is also planning to go to Namwon Province.\"Mingyue, do you want to go to Nanyuan Daozhou with me?\" Xiao Chen looked at Wu Mingyue, tender and tender with tender eyes.During this period of time, there was no substantial contact between him and Wu Mingyue.But the relationship is already very harmonious.This made Xiao Chen think that he was almost about to attack Wu Mingyue.Wu Mingyue's face was covered with white gauze, and she looked at Xiao Chen with Qiushui's bright eyes, with a hint of tenderness.But she still shook her head slightly: \"Sorry, Xiao Chen, the Yuantian Supreme Secret Store was born, and there will be a gathering of forces from all quarters. If I show up, it will be easy to reveal my identity and then be arrested.\"Wu Mingyue's words made Xiao Chen's face a little dark.He also now knows Wu Mingyue's true identity.is the eldest princess of the Panwu dynasty, her status is amazing.And the reason why she escaped by herself was because she didn't want to face the matter of choosing her husband later.She doesn't want her life's major events, mixed with interests, and being manipulated by others.\"Mingyue, one day, I will go to Panwu Shenchao to marry you!\"Xiao Chen didn't know why, his brain was hot, and he suddenly spoke.Wu Mingyue heard the words, and the jade face flew onto two red clouds, like the morning glow and snow, which is not beautiful.\"Xiao Chen, what nonsense are you talking about?\" Wu Mingyue rarely showed a hint of shyness.It is said that a woman in love has no brains.Wu Mingyue is unlikely to fall directly, but she already has a good impression of Xiao Chen.But she also understands that although Xiao Chen has strong abilities, it is not right for him to be an improper household.Panwu God Dynasty is also absolutely impossible, let the princess of his own parents marry the prince of an ancient Qinglong country.\"Hehe, don't worry, I, Xiao Chen, speak up, and I will never break my word!\" Xiao Chen smiled straightly, confidently.The confident and sunny smile gave Wu Mingyue a special feeling.Xiao Chen, unlike the young talents she had met, was firm and simple.Afterwards, although Xiao Chen was reluctant to give up, he still bid farewell to Wu Mingyue.\"Xiao Chen, although Mingyue cannot walk with you in the face, but it can help you secretly. If you encounter any danger in the Yuantian Supreme Vault, Mingyue will help you.\"Wu Mingyue whispered in her heart.She has decided to hide in the dark and follow Xiao Chen.is so because she has a vague hunch in her heart.This time Xiao Chen went to the Yuantian Supreme Secret Store, which would be extremely dangerous.The base camp of the Zulong's Nest, Hongzhou.A stretch of thousands of miles, within the mountain range where dragons gather.A loud voice sounded.\"Bi Chi, at the beginning, that Yuantian Supreme, arrogant and domineering, snatched a few valuable ancient dragon bones from my Ancestral Dragon Nest. This time the secret is opened, you go and take back that dragon bone.\"fell with the voice of speaking.Another woman in cyan armor suddenly showed her figure.She has a beautiful face, a slender figure, a symmetrical figure wrapped in cyan armor, and she looks heroic, like a hero in a female middle school.But the most eye-catching thing about this woman is that her black and soft hair has two cyan dragon horns sticking out, indicating that she is not a human race, but an ancient royal family.This woman, named Long Bi Chi, is a talented dragon girl in Ancestral Dragon Nest.In the Ancestral Dragon Nest, the status of the Dragon Girl is equal to the Dragon Child.And this Long Bi Chi, to a certain extent, is more powerful than Long Haotian.Because of her ancestors, there was a Canglong ancient emperor.The ancient emperor of the Primordial Royal Family, that is the supreme existence comparable to the human emperor.So from this point of view, Long Bichi can be regarded as a trace of the blood of the ancient emperor.Although passed down to this day, the blood of the ancient emperor in Long Bichi's body is too thin to be extracted.But after all, he is a descendant of the ancient emperor of Canglong, and his talent is needless to say.\"Yes, Bi Chi will follow the orders of the ancestors and must bring back the ancient keel.\" Long Bi Chi clasped his fists, bravely, and did not lose the man.\"By the way, you must be careful of the prince's son, UU reading www.uukanshu.com this time the secret is opened, he might also enter the world to fight for the front.\" The magnificent voice exhorted.\"That gentleman's son, is that powerful?\" Long Bichi frowned slightly.These days, she has heard many stories about the son of the Jun family, and her ears are almost calling out.\"Can easily kill Long Haotian's existence, what do you think?\" said the voice.\"Long Haotian merged with a dragon yuan, it is indeed not weak, but Bi Chi has merged two dragon yuan, and it is still completely refining and fusion, in terms of strength, Long Haotian is definitely not better than Bi Chi.\"Long Bi Chi raised her snow-white chin slightly, with a touch of confidence.are all geniuses in a million, who will convince whom?Before seeing the power of Jun Xiaoyao, even members of the family like Jun Zhanjian would be a little ignored., let alone the dragon **** of the hostile force.Many times, before they are truly defeated, these arrogant arrogances will not admit defeat in their hearts.If you were afraid from the beginning, it would be tantamount to the collapse of Dao Xin, and you don't need to practice anymore.\"In short, be careful.\" The voice warned.\"Accomplished, Bi Chi has retired.\" Long Bi Chi arched his hands slightly, and did not listen to the words, but left directly, ready to set off.The magnificent voice also sighed slightly: \"Hey, I miss the line of Canglong Ancient Emperor. There used to be a descendant of a prostitute who was sealed in the source of God, but now she has lost her whereabouts and is completely blue.

With Jun Xiaoyao now in Jun's house, he killed himself, what would happen?the answer is\u2026\u2026will not be so good at all!Jun Xiaoyao's current status is far from comparable to that of his fifth sequence.If Jun Xiaoyao killed him, the Jun family would at best give a superficial warning, and there would not even be any substantive punishment.When thinking of this result, Jun Wanjie felt cold all over.Jun Xiaoyao kills him without any punishment.But his life is going to be lost in vain.It seemed that he saw a ray of panic in Jun Wanjie's eyes, and the corner of Jun Xiaoyao's lips curled up slightly.How many people are not afraid of death in this world?But to be honest, if not necessary, Jun Xiaoyao would not kill him.It's not that he is soft-hearted.But as the son of the prince's family, it is also the zero sequence, casually killing his own sequence, the impact is not very good.At least the clan elders of other branches of the Jun family, and other sequences, may have opinions on him.Jun Xiaoyao is not afraid of troubles, but he is too lazy to deal with them.But Jun Xiaoyao will not let Jun Wanjie go and bury hidden dangers.So the only feasible way is...\"Now, I give you two choices, surrender to me, plant a slave mark, or...\"\"Dead!\"Jun Xiaoyao gave Jun Wanjie a choice.Jun Wanjie turned pale instantly, gritting his teeth.He knew that even if he died here today, no one would avenge him.But if he surrenders to Jun Xiaoyao, even if his Dao Heart collapses completely, he will only become Jun Xiaoyao's slave in the future.\"I have limited patience, I only give you three breaths...\" Jun Xiaoyao frowned.Jun Wanjie trembled violently, got up with difficulty, and then knelt down!He doesn't want to die!Because he still has an unfinished obsession in his heart.\"Oh?

I swear that I must take her back to the fairyland. Therefore, I Can't die...\"Jun Wanjie's words make Jun Xiaoyao raise his eyebrows slightly.turns out to be this kind of routine.Separated from his sister when he was young, and then worked hard to become stronger and find her sister back.Jun Xiaoyao knows that the whole world is divided into nine heavens and ten earths.nine days, refers to the nine days immortal domain.Desolate Heaven Fairy Domain is one of the Nine Heavens Fairy Domains.And ten land refers to the ten vast continents in the lower realm.Generally speaking, the boundary between the nine heavens and ten earth is difficult to break.If you want to send a person to the lower realm, you have to pay a huge price, and there are also restrictions on the realm of cultivation.It's no wonder that Jun Wanjie wanted to become stronger through cultivation, and then climbed to a high position.turned out to be thinking about the lower realms and looking for his sister.\"Let's talk about it later, if this **** child has the opportunity to go to the realm, it may not be impossible to bring your sister back by the way.\" Jun Xiaoyao said calmly.Since Jun Wanjie is already his servant, there is no threat to him.Why not give me a date?Jun Myriad Tribulation heard the words, his originally slumped face, immediately stunned, UU read www.uukanshu.com and then a ray of excitement emerged.The unwillingness and resentment in my previous heart dissolve at this moment.There is nothing more important than reuniting him with his sister.\"Thank you, my son, I used to have eyes and no beads, and I couldn't help it!\" Jun Wanjie knocked his head hard at Jun Xiaoyao.If he was only talented, he was forced to surrender under the pressure of life and death.So now, it is sincere and sincere, surrendering to Jun Xiaoyao.Looking at such a scene, Jun Zhuangjian and Jun Xuehuang looked at each other, and both took a deep breath.The stabbing head in the ten major sequences, the most surly and domineering Jun Wanjie, was so subdued.\"The son is amazing, whether he is armed or ingenious.\" Jun Linglong also exclaimed.Although she is pregnant with seven orifices and exquisite heart, in front of Jun Xiaoyao, she always feels not enough.A conflict within the Jun family was resolved in this way.The fifth sequence of Jun Wanjie, completely surrendered to Jun Xiaoyao.plus Jun Zhanjian, Jun Xuehuang.There are already three of the ten major sequences of the Jun family, and they completely surrendered to him.\"Grandpa was always worried that other sequences would trouble me. Maybe it won't be long before the ten major sequences will surrender to me?\" Jun Xiaoyao thought to himself.But he also knows that the first few sequences that are really powerful in the Jun family.Those sequences are either in retreat, or they are practicing outside, and I haven't seen one before.Among them are those with double pupils, and there are Tianjiao who have inherited the taboo.is far from Jun Zhanjian, Jun Wanjie and others are comparable.\"Go back, wait for the Yuantian Supreme Secret Vault to open!\"Jun Xiaoyao waved his sleeves, as if he was leaving in the wind, he was looking forward to the sign-in of the next secret store.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

His status and status are not comparable to other Tianjiao.\"Many young talents are flattering to please.Ji Xuan's identity is enough for them to cling to their thighs.Because Ji Xuan has more than just the identity of Huanggu Ji Family Tianjiao.He is also a saint son of the Holy Spirit Academy.Holy Spirit Academy is an academy with extremely deep heritage in the Wild Heaven Immortal Realm, which has been passed down for countless years.The proud sons who walked out of his academy are all over the major forces in the wild and immortal realm.Even many ancient families and immortal dynasties sent some of their younger disciples to the Holy Spirit Academy to practice.In the Holy Spirit Academy, only the best disciples can get the identity of the holy son.Ji Xuan was able to obtain this status, which shows that his talent strength far exceeds that of his peers.Some Tianjiao's eyes also fell on Ji Xuan's faintly glowing right arm.It is rumored that Ji Xuan's right arm is fused with a piece of the saint king's hand bone.In the holy realm, the saint king is more powerful than the saint.A king of saints is enough to look down on all directions and be majestic.And Ji Xuan, only now in Guiyi Realm, has merged a piece of the saint king's hand bones.One can imagine how strong his strength will be.Even with his current realm, he can't exert the power of one or two of the saint king's hand bones.But it was enough to make him proud of his peers.It is precisely because of this piece of the saint king's hand bone that he got the title of little saint.\"But speaking of status and status, it reminds me of that gentleman's son.\" A Tianjiao said.As soon as he said this, the lively banquet was rarely quiet.A faintly depressive atmosphere emerged.These days, when they were in Nantian City, they naturally learned about Jun Xiaoyao and Jun Wanjie.For these Tianjiao, let alone Jun Wanjie, even Jun Zhanjian is an existence they need to look up to.As for Jun Xiaoyao, who can easily suppress Jun Wanjie, it seems to them like the sun and the moon in the sky, which is beyond expectation.Some people faintly looked at Ji Xuan.They also said that Ji Xuan's status is very high, but compared with Jun Xiaoyao, it seems that it is nothing.Ji Xuan's expression didn't change much. He picked up a glass of wine and sipped it slowly, but his eyes were very deep.\"The son of the king's family...\" Ji Xuan muttered to himself.To be honest, when he learned that Jun Xiaoyao appeared in Nantian City, Ji Xuan really wanted to compare with Jun Xiaoyao.Nothing else, just for the family behind.As far as the ancient family in the Wild Heaven and Immortal Territory is concerned, there has always been a saying that there is a royal family.The so-called Yusanjia refers to the three most desolate ancient families with the most prestigious, strongest background, and the most outstanding descendants of Tianjiao.Among them, the younger generation Tianjiao is one of the important indicators to measure the imperial family.After all, only the descendants are prosperous, and the entire ancient family can be passed on.The Ji family was once one of the three imperial families, but now it has become the Jun family, the Jiang family, and the Ye family.You don't need to say more about the family of the princes, talents have always come out in large numbers, the previous generation just being a prince without regret is enough to establish the status of one of the three families of the jun family.There are also ten major sequences in the contemporary era, as well as the anomalous monster Jun Xiaoyao.And Jiang's contemporary generation is also Jiang Shengyi with innate Taoism, Jiang Luoli with Yuanling Taoism, and several other top royal geniuses.As for Ye Family, Ye Xingyun and other kings needless to say, a sword demon reincarnated as Ye Guchen, it is enough to extend Ye Family's luck for thousands of years.Because of this, Ji Xuan's heart is a little bit uneven.Is there no genius in their Ji family?But Ji Xuan is not a fool, he knows that Jun Xiaoyao is not a good role to deal with.But he has a saint king's hand bone and is also a top arrogant. It is impossible to say that he is directly afraid of Jun Xiaoyao.Some people noticed that Ji Xuan's emotions were not right, and they smiled reluctantly: \"Hehe, what do you think of the son of the Jun Family? Isn't Big Brother Ji Xuan better than the son of Jun Family?\"\"That is ~www.mtlnovel.com~ Brother Ji Xuan is also a person who surpasses the Jun family sequence.\" A young proud man flattered.They are not talking nonsense.Ji Xuan once, indeed fought against Jun with sword.At that time, he relied on a slightly higher realm, and took a little advantage, before he defeated the king's sword.Now Ji Xuan's strength is stronger, but it is impossible for others to stand still.\"Jun Xiaoyao, if he doesn't take the initiative to provoke me, I don't need to provoke him first. Moreover, I have found some secrets about Yuantian Supreme and such things in a broken ancient book in the Holy Spirit Academy...\"Ji Xuan muttered in his heart.He didn't come without preparation.Because he once accidentally found a volume of ancient books in the Buddhist scripture building of the Holy Spirit Academy, which contained not only a Yuantian Supreme Order, but also an ancient talisman.In ancient books, some deeds and secrets of Yuan Tian Zhizun are vaguely recorded.There seems to be a rare thing hidden in the Yuantian Supreme Secret Store.If you get it, you can create an invincible young supreme.After \u3000\u3000 Ji Xuan got this opportunity, he was very excited, and has been patiently waiting for the birth of the Yuantian Supreme Vault.And now, finally waiting for the time to come.\"As long as I can seize this opportunity, I, Ji Xuan, will soar into the sky and stand at the pinnacle of the young generation in the Wild Sky Immortal Realm.\"\"When the time comes, I will sweep all the young masters of Yusanjia, who can stop?\"Thinking of a scene that might appear in the future, Ji Xuan took a deep breath, and the light in his eyes surged.At the same time, at the gate of Nantian City, a figure wearing a cloak and a hood entered through the gate.He raised his head, revealing a handsome face, it was Xiao Chen!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I must seize this opportunity.\"Xiao Chen has a decent temperament and has a sense of indomitability.

Which dare you, but you are a god-child sequence hand-picked by the eighteenth ancestors, plus Wushuang talent, let alone just let Jun Wanjie become a slave, if you really kill him, no one will dare to do you. \"Jun Zhan Tiandao.Jun Xiaoyao nodded slightly, which was in his expectation.\"Regarding the Yuantian Supreme Secret Vault, we have already discussed several major immortal traditions. After a few days, the Secret Vault is estimated to be opened.\"\"At that time, our major forces will close the world and let only the younger generation enter. The Supreme Secret Vault will be your stage.\"Jun Xiaoyao heard the words and nodded faintly: \"Grandpa, don't worry, Xiaoyao will never fall into your prestige!\"\"Haha, grandpa believes in you.\" Jun Zhantian laughed happily.He is very confident of his grandson.A few days later.Thousands of miles outside Nantian City, in the wild forest, there was a sudden vibration.A supreme coercion spread out, and at the same time a strange black mist began to spread in the deepest part of the wild forest.Where the gray mist passed, all kinds of monsters, ancient relics, and pure blood creatures all had their eyes reddened, and they began to roar, as if they were mad.\"Huh? This is not quite right with the Yuantian Supreme Secret Store...\"In the void, several figures appear and disappear.The one who spoke was an old Taoist from the Taoist Heaven School.Nanyuan Daozhou is the base camp of the Taoist Heavenly Sect. As the strongest of the Taoist Heavenly Sect, the veteran Taoist naturally assumes the role of overall planning.He looked at the gray mist spreading from the depths of the wild forest at this moment, and his gray brows wrinkled slightly.\"How do you feel this gray mist, some dark matter resembling a foreign land?\"An old man in Chinese clothes hesitated.He is an elder of the Huanggu Ji family, named Ji Bangyin, and he is also the protector of Ji Xuan this time.Hearing what he said, the rest of the big figures were all startled.\"Somewhat similar, but still far from being compared with real dark matter.\"Among the few big figures, there is Jun Zhantian. After thinking for a while, he shook his head slightly.Exotic dark matter is a very strange and terrifying existence.is a little bit contaminated, it can cause the creatures to fall into madness and alienation, or die directly.And this gray mist, although it is also weird, still can't compare with the real dark matter.\"Hehe, if your monarch is scared, you can be a turtle with your head.\"An old man wearing a azure robe with first-born blue dragon horns sneered coldly.He is an elder of the Canglong line in the Ancestral Dragon Nest, and he came to protect Long Bichi this time.Jun Zhantian heard the words and snorted coldly: \"Why, you green-skin loach, do you want to follow in the footsteps of that black-skinned loach?\"Hearing what Jun Zhantian said, the elders of the Canglong line turned blue and snorted heavily, but they stopped talking.The three swords of the eighteen ancestors of the emperor's family killed Youlong Supreme ~www.mtlnovel.com~, which shocked the Ancestral Dragon Nest.At least until the Zulong Nest is not ready, it is impossible for them to have a large-scale conflict with the Jun family.\"In this way, will this experience continue?\"On the other side, a tall and thin old man with a clean appearance asked.He is the elder of the ancient Jiang family, and this time he also brought the Tianjiao of the Jiang family.And it's not someone else who brought her, it's Jiang Shengyi, the goddess of the Jiang family.Although Jiang Shengyi is Jun Xiaoyao's nominal aunt, she is only twenty-four years old, and she is also the arrogant of the younger generation.\"Of course you have to continue.

Now they are lying on the ground like a fat orange cat and wagging their tails begging for mercy.\"Impressed?\"Jun Xiaoyao stepped on the remaining head of the nine lions.\"Take it, take it, don't kill me!\" The nine lions trembled, there is no trace of the majesty of the ancient royal family.It knew that Jun Xiaoyao really dared to kill it.With the background of the Jun family, even the Nine Spirits Yuan Sheng, it is estimated that it will be difficult to get back in revenge.\"Well, just barely be my mount.\" Jun Xiaoyao said lightly.Nine lions are extremely strong, and the reason why they are so miserable now is because the opponent is him.It's very difficult to change the position of any other Tianjiao to abuse the nine lions like this.\"Yes...\" The nine lions bowed their heads.Many monks saw this scene, and their hearts were surging.Swallow the celestial sparrow with his hands and surrender the nine lions.This is difficult for ordinary people to do.Jun Xiaoyao did it easily.Long Bi Chi took a deep breath, his chest rising and falling.She finally understands now why the ancestors warned her like that.\"Long Haotian, you don't die...\" Long Bichi's heroic eyes were filled with extreme fear.At the same time, she thought of the evildoer who was still fusing Long Yuan in retreat.\"I wonder if Long Aotian, who is fused with seven dragon yuan and added with the blood of God's dragon, can beat the son of the Jun family?\"On the other side, Ji Xuan, Xiao Chen and others have even increased the danger of Jun Xiaoyao to the extreme.At this moment, in the crack of the earth, another vision spread out, the gray mist rolled, and the brilliance surged.\"The Supreme Secret Vault has finally opened!\"All the monks, the Primordial creatures, have cheered up.Jun Xiaoyao looked at him, and there was no sign-in reminder from the system in his mind.\"It seems that you have to go deep into the Yuantian secret to sign in.\" Jun Xiaoyao thought to himself.\"go!\"Ji Xuan and the others, their eyes flickered, their mana surged, wrapped the whole body, and rushed straight down.pulled a hair and moved his whole body, and the other monks followed closely behind.As for Long Bichi, it seems that Jun Xiaoyao glanced at him, and finally gave up to provoke Jun Xiaoyao.\"Originally, I came here to deal with Jun Xiaoyao and promote my reputation as an ancestral dragon's nest, but now it seems that I really thought things too simple.\"\"Looking for the ancient keel is the main thing.\" Long Bichi thought to himself.She was originally mainly to find Jun Xiaoyao for trouble, and secondly, to find the ancient keel.But now, after seeing Jun Xiaoyao's strength with his own eyes, Long Bichi consciously puts the search for the ancient keel first.Seeing Long Bichi honestly entered the cracks in the earth, Jun Xiaoyao also chuckled, \"It's acquaintance...\"\"Let's go.\" Jun Xiaoyao waved his hand and rode nine lions into the cracks in the ground first.The king swordsman, the king Xuehuang, the king Linglong, the king Wanjie, and Jiang Shengyi followed closely.As soon as it entered the crack, a thick gray mist rolled over.is much richer than the outside world. U U Reading www.uukanshu.comMany of the monks who broke into it rashly lost their minds quickly corroded by the gray mist, and their eyes turned red.This kind of dense gray fog can't even completely isolate the mana.Boom!Jun Xiaoyao waved away and slapped several monks in front of him who had fallen into madness.Soon, he drove a way and reached the bottom of the crack.Looking at it, a magnificent underground palace is horizontally underground, and a supreme pressure is permeating from the depths.Jun Xiaoyao released his soul power, and roughly probed it with his spiritual thoughts.The entire underground palace seems to be divided into inner and outer layers.The outer layer should be accessible to most people, while the inner layer may require an order from Yuantian Supreme.\"It seems that if you want to sign in, you should go deep inside.\" Jun Xiaoyao thought.At this time, Ji Xuan had already swept towards the underground palace, with a smile on the corner of his mouth and a ray of excitement in his eyes.\"Huh? Isn't he?\" Jun Xiaoyao noticed Ji Xuan's expression, his eyes were thinking.Looking at the appearance of Ji Xuan, it seems that he knows some of the secrets hidden by the Supreme.\"Ji Xuan, let you be my treasure hunter.\" Jun Xiaoyao smiled.On the other side, he also noticed that Xiao Chen also rushed towards another entrance of the underground palace.Jun Xiaoyao knew that Xiao Chen was a person with good luck, and he would surely gain a lot from this secret storehouse.Thinking of this, Jun Xiaoyao turned his head and said: \"Myriad Tribulation, I have something to tell you.\"\"Yes, please speak, my son.\" Jun Wanjie said in his hand.Jun Xiaoyao passed away, Jun Wanjie nodded, and walked away.\"Heh... the entire Yuantian secret is under my control.\"Jun Xiaoyao holds his hands with confidence.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Supreme Secret Vault, plus the weird gray fog permeating everywhere.Even a fool knows that this supreme secret store has some kind of abnormality, and it is filled with ominousness.Inside the underground palace, there is an ancient and decadent atmosphere.At a glance, the wind and wind are miserable, the mist is shrouded, and the walls are ruined.There are many dark corpses on the ground.The strangest thing is that these corpses have black scales spreading out of their bodies, as if they were alienated.just as many monks stepped into the underground palace.These weird demon corpses suddenly violently rushed up with their blood-red eyes.Their nails, like sharp blades, pierced the body of the tearing monk with ease.The cultivator of the Divine Bridge Realm could not stop these demons at all.Soon a large number of monks were slaughtered.However, on Jun Xiaoyao's side, between his hands and feet, he easily patted these demons into meatloaf.As for other people, he didn't care about it, and he didn't bother to care about it.Jun Xiaoyao is not the nanny of these monks, let alone a righteous person.The greater the ability, the greater the responsibility, this kind of thing has nothing to do with Jun Xiaoyao.Behind Jun Xiaoyao, Jiang Shengyi, Jun Linglong, Jun Xuehuang and others did not move.It's not that they don't want to contribute, but that they really don't have a chance.Jun Xiaoyao drove out a road casually, and no demon corpse could stop him.On the other side, Long Bichi, Xiao Chen and others are no longer on this main road, and they don't know where to go.Jun Wanjie is not beside Jun Xiaoyao either.Ji Xuan glanced at Jun Xiaoyao from the corner of his eyes, and saw that Jun Xiaoyao did not notice him, his figure flashed, and he also left the main hall.After Ji Xuan left, Jun Xiaoyao sneered at the corner of his lips.He is not ready to harvest Ji Xuan now, because the time has not come.As time goes by, the number of monks is decreasing.Most of the monks were slaughtered clean by the demon corpse.\"Snow Phoenix, Zhanjian, you go to find Ji Xuan secretly, but don't start to scare the snake.\" Jun Xiaoyao said.Upon hearing this, both Jun Zhanjian and Jun Xuehuang's eyes shook.The **** child wants to hit Ji Xuan's attention?When thinking of this, Jun Zhanjian and Jun Xuehuang couldn't help but pity Ji Xuan a little.The person that Jun Xiaoyao is staring at has nothing to end.Jiang Shengyi opened his lips, and said with a little worry: \"Xiaoyao, do you want to attack Ji Xuan, he has the saint king's hand bone, if you really work hard...\"Jiang Shengyi is worried.She was not afraid that Jun Xiaoyao would lose to Ji Xuan.But Ji Xuanruo tried desperately to fight back, fearing that it would also bring some harm to Jun

generation of Xianyu, the people who can make me jealous, the past, present, and future will not exist.\"Jun Xiaoyao smiled freely.This is not pride, but fact.The talent is peerless, and the system is

slightly.Jun Xiaoyao's confident look is really beautiful.\"Let's go, there are some treasures in this underground palace, and they can't be wasted.\" Jun Xiaoyao shook his sleeve.Next, Jun Xiaoyao rode nine lions and acted with Jiang Shengyi.Jun Zhanjian and Jun Xuehuang went to follow Ji Xuan secretly.On the other side, Xiao Chen wearing a hood and cloak was walking through the complex underground palace.\"Xiao Chen, go to the left again, then go straight, this seat has sensed the breath of ancient keel bones, and it's not far away!\"In Xiao Chen's mind, Master Qinglong heard a slightly excited voice.Even Master Qinglong couldn't keep calm anymore.If he can obtain ancient keel bones and fuse various materials, he can reshape his body.can not only return to the peak state, but even further, it is not impossible to break through to become the supreme supreme.Even the quasi-supreme strong like Master Qinglong couldn't bear the excitement.Not to mention Xiao Chen, who was dumbfounded.Excitement flashed in his eyes, and he couldn't help speeding up his pace.After about a while, Xiao Chen entered a cave-like existence after eliminating some demon corpses and a few other monks.The entire underground cave has a huge space.Xiao Chen was breathing fast, and looked around.But in the huge cave space, there are five huge dragon bones.Four of the bones are all showing a deep dark gold, and the surface of the bones is branded with many complicated and mysterious runes.The four dark golden dragon bones, even if they were just bones, still carried an immense majesty, and Xiao Chen couldn't help but feel the urge to kneel down and worship.\"Is this the ancient keel?\" Xiao Chen was so excited that his fingers were shaking.Just by feeling this majesty, he knew that the ancient keel was extremely powerful and could definitely make him completely transformed.However, in his mind, Master Qinglong suddenly made a surprised voice.\"Could it be the keel of the legendary Supreme Ancestor!\"\"Supreme Ancestral Dragon Bone?\" Xiao Chen looked puzzled, and immediately looked at the last skeleton.That skeletal bone, unlike the other four dark golden keel bones, presents a jade-like luster, just like carved from a fairy jade, completely natural.On the bones, densely packed runes are imprinted, which circulate like stars in the sky ~www.mtlnovel.com~, which is mysterious and powerful.Although the four dark golden ancient dragon bones are powerful, they are like a courtier facing the emperor when compared with this wild dragon bone.\"The supreme ancestral dragon bone is the dragon supreme who has the blood of the ancestor dragon. The leftover bones are far stronger than the ancient dragon bones!\" Master Qinglong said in a hurry.Xiao Chen took a deep breath when he heard the words, his eyes were also shocked.How powerful is the Ancestral Dragon bloodline?The entire Ancestral Dragon Nest is named after Ancestral Dragon.The real Ancestral Dragon Ancient Emperor, that can be suppressed even by some human emperors!Of course, the supreme ancestral dragon bone in front of Xiao Chen obviously could not be a pure-blooded ancestral dragon bone.The remains of the pure-blooded ancestor dragon, I am afraid that one or two of them will not be found in the ancestral dragon's nest.But even if it contains some ancestral dragon bloodline, it is enough to turn this supreme ancestral dragon bone into a priceless treasure.\"It's developed, Xiao Chen will become developed!\"Xiao Chen breathed quickly, and his body trembled slightly because of his excitement.He cultivated the Azure Dragon Transformation Art. If he merged with this supreme ancestral dragon bone, how powerful would he become?When the time comes, not to mention suppressing an era, at least it can push the young generation of Huangtianxianyu horizontally?\"Xiao Chen, it is not suitable to stay here for a long time. Put these five keels away soon.\" Master Qinglong reminded.\"Yes.\" Xiao Chen also reacted.He just wants to quickly take away the five keels, then find a secluded place for refining, and finally hit the face of Jun Xiaoyao and revenge strongly.However, just when Xiao Chen wanted to take the keel away.There was also a surprised female voice.\"That is... the ancient dragon bone, and... the supreme ancestor dragon bone?!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

For the sake of this dragon girl in a good mood, go away.\"Long Bi Chi waved his hand, but did not put Xiao Chen in his eyes.\"Hmph, this girl is too domineering, won't you put Xiao in your eyes?\" Xiao Chen's brows condensed, and he said in a deep voice.\"Put you in your eyes?\" Long Bichi tilted his head slightly, and the corners of his lips suddenly provoked a hint of sarcasm.\"Do you think you are Jun Xiaoyao, this dragon girl is afraid of Jun Xiaoyao, is she still afraid of you ant?\"Hearing Long Bichi's words, Xiao Chen's eyes suddenly filled with anger.\"Jun Xiaoyao, Jun Xiaoyao, and Jun Xiaoyao again, how am I inferior to Xiao Chen!\"Xiao Chen suddenly yelled, causing Long Bichi to be slightly startled, wondering why the human in front of him suddenly went crazy.\"Any dragon girl, I have to lie on my stomach!\" Xiao Chen actually took the initiative.\"Humble human kid, looking for death!\" Long Bichi raised his eyebrows, and also did it.The two bodies immediately collided, causing waves of mana.\"Hey, what is your cultivation level?\" Long Bichi was slightly surprised.She didn't expect that the Human Race kid in front of her would have the cultivation base of the middle stage of the Divine Bridge Realm.This is already comparable to the pride of heaven.Even if it is her Long Bichi, it is only the cultivation base of the Great Perfection of the Divine Bridge Realm.Boom! boom! boom!The two touched each other's moves, and for a while, they were actually equal.At this time, in Xiao Chen's mind, Master Qinglong's voice sounded: \"Xiao Chen, it should not be too late. Hurry up and think of a way to take away the keel. It won't be good to attract other people.\"The reason why Master Qinglong didn't make a move was because he couldn't make a move.With his quasi-Supreme Yuanshen's cultivation base, once he takes a shot, he may be sensed by those immortal Taoist elders outside the Supreme Secrets.Therefore, I can only rely on Xiao Chen himself.\"Okay, a quick fight!\"Xiao Chen made a decision in his heart, screaming up to the sky, blue light surging all over his body.Then in Long Bichi's slightly shaking gaze, Xiao Chen's cyan scales covered his body, with wings on his back, as if a dragon had been transformed into a half-dragon form.Xiao Chen's breath also directly skyrocketed to the return level.\"This...this is the Azure Dragon Transformation Art of my Ancestral Dragon Nest, where did you get it?\" Long Bichi was slightly dumbfounded, and he couldn't believe it.She never expected that a Human Race kid could actually practice the Azure Dragon Transforming Art to this level.\"Huh, what surprised you is still behind!\"Seeing Long Bichi's shocked expression, Xiao Chen felt a trace of pride in his heart.He blasted out with a punch, and the hundreds of blue dragon light patterns spread out, and the fist was amazing.But Long Bi Chi is obviously not a soft persimmon.She has completely refined two Long Yuan, and her strength is stronger than Long Haotian.The dragon and green pond jade hand flicked out, like a real dragon wagging its tail, setting off a series of mana runes.Xiao Chen is also opening and closing his fists, with shocking fluctuations.The two parties are actually in a stalemate.\"This **** woman is really getting in the way...\"Seeing that it was difficult for him to completely suppress Long Bichi, Xiao Chen's brows were gloomy as water.just when the situation is deadlocked.A mana training suddenly shot from not far away, cracking the ground along the way.Sensing this sudden move, Long Bichi was shocked, and hurriedly dodged sideways, but he was still rubbed on his body and spit out a small bit of blood.\"Who!?\" Long Bichi's beautiful eyes were gushing anger.A beautiful woman with a white gauze mask and eyes like autumn water appeared.\"Mingyue, it's you, why are you here!?\" Xiao Chen showed an unexpected surprise.Wu Mingyue's appearance was completely unexpected by Xiao Chen.\"Xiao Chen, are you okay.\" Wu Mingyue gave Xiao Chen a concerned look, and then looked at Long Bichi with her beautiful eyes.\"Who are you?\" Long Bichi's eyes showed alertness.She can feel that this white veil masked woman is very unusual regardless of her cultivation level or her identity.\"Leave, you can't get your hands on the things here.\" Wu Mingyue's tone was cold, invisibly revealing the majesty of the Princess of God.\"Dare you intervene in the Ancestral Dragon's Nest?\" Long Bichi's eyes showed indifference.\"The Ancestral Dragon Nest is indeed powerful, but what about it?\" Wu Mingyue was not afraid at all~www.mtlnovel.com~ Seeing Wu Mingyue go to the Ancestral Dragon Nest for herself, Xiao Chen was not touched.He vowed that he would marry Wu Mingyue in the future and cherish her.However, just when the smell of gunpowder is full.A voice with a cold tone sounded again.\"Hmph, this dragon bone is neither from the Ancestral Dragon's Nest nor from the two of you, but from the Son of God.\"Hearing this voice, Long Bichi, Wu Mingyue, and Xiao Chen's expressions all changed suddenly.But I saw a young man in a silver armor showing up.The face is straight, with interlaced scars, and the temperament is as cold as ice, and the whole body is wrapped with lightning runes.is the fifth sequence of Jun Family, Jun Wanjie!\"Jun Wanjie, why are you here!?\" Long Bichi's beautiful eyes shook.\"Thanks to this little white mouse.\" Jun Wanjie looked at Xiao Chen with a cold joke in his eyes.Before, Jun Xiaoyao sent a message to Jun Wanjie, just instructing him to follow Xiao Chen secretly.Jun Wanjie was still wondering at first, what's the use of following an ordinary kid.But now, after seeing the four wild dragon bones and the one supreme ancestral dragon bone, Jun Wanjie completely subdued Jun Xiaoyao.\"Could the young man be able to deduct the secret of the secret, otherwise how did he know that this kid would have such a chance?\" Jun Wanjie sighed.But right now, his most important thing is to seize these five keels.Seeing Jun Wanjie appear, Xiao Chen's face flushed, and the blue veins in his temple suddenly throbbed, making his internal organs burning with anger.How he didn't know, he was secretly calculated by Jun Xiaoyao again.Thinking of this, Xiao Chen turned his head and said to Wu Mingyue: \"Mingyue, please, help me suppress this person!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

innate body, because it was not realistic.Unless it can be obtained through sign-in rewards.But that is too illusory, and the sign-in reward cannot be specified.Jun Xiaoyao thought about another possibility.This possibility might allow him to deal with the Supreme Demon Corpse before him.Thinking of this, Jun Xiaoyao directly transmitted to Jiang Shengyi: \"Sister Shengyi, I need your

At this moment, he seems to be a superior immortal, making a judgment.Even when facing the Supreme Demon Corpse, he is confident.Jun Xiaoyao completely urged the power of the ancient sacramental body, and around him, a number of figures began to appear.Every figure is sacred and transcendent, with a holy atmosphere.is like a holy lord, emerging in the void.Count them down, there are plenty of ghosts!\"This is... the Eucharist vision!\"Jiang Shengyi also recovered, suppressing the strangeness in her heart, and seeing this scene before her eyes, her pupils vibrated.The power of the ancient sacrament is not limited to the incomparable flesh.Its eucharistic vision is also a big killer.Jun Xiaoyao has fought all the way to the present, and has never used the Communion vision.It's not that he doesn't use it, but that no one is qualified to let him use it.Right now, facing this supreme demon corpse, Jun Xiaoyao finally sacrificed the vision of the Eucharist, and worshipped the Holy Spirit!Moreover, this vision also blessed the power of the great power of the congenital Taoist womb.how might it be, one can imagine!\"The Supreme Yuan Tian, the dust returns to the dust, the soil returns to the earth, let's sleep peacefully after death.\"Jun Xiaoyao stepped into the void, standing with his hands holding his hands, his expression indifferent like a god.The phantom of the sage of ten thousand ways, at this moment, Qi Qi bowed and worshiped at Jun Xiaoyao!seems to be worshipping the only **** in heaven and earth!This scene, UU reading www.uukanshu.com shocking!rumbling!A terrifying power was overwhelmed!The golden gods shine all over the square, and those ordinary demon corpses, directly under this power, burst into powder!Rao is the supreme demon corpse, and it has also been greatly suppressed.

Under the radiance of the gods, he has started to sneer and emit white smoke.The ancient sacrament of the wild, has the effect of restraining all kinds of evil forces.After the anomaly is enlarged, the effect is even more prominent.Not only was the Supreme Demon Corpse suppressed, but all the gray fog in the depths of the Supreme Vault began to melt and collapse under the Eucharist vision.And at the same time, the outside world is too barren forest.The sky-viewing mirror suspended in the void was originally shrouded in a gray mist, and it was impossible to see the scene clearly.But the gray mist actually began to dissipate, and then the scene in the Supreme Vault was also imprinted on the sky through the sky-viewing mirror.\"Look, the sky-viewing mirror has started to work!\"\"Hi, could it be Yuantian Supreme's corpse, how was it demonized?\"\"Oh my God, pinch me, I'm not mistaken, is the Lord of the Kings fighting against the Supreme Demon Corpse?\"\"Fuck, how is this possible!\"\"This Nima is outrageous!\"When the Tiantian Mirror showed the scene in the depths of the Yuantian Secrets, the entire wild forest was boiling, and there was an uproar!Tens of thousands of monks, each of them gaped, their eyes rounded, as if they had seen the most unlikely miracle!Everyone stood frozen in place, their mouths opened wide, unbelievable!Even the immortal Taoist elders sitting in the void of the sky were staring with old eyes, and they almost fell from the sky because of an instability.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He is also very good to her.Xiao Chen noticed that Wu Mingyue seemed to be worried, and thought she was worried about returning to the court, and couldn't help but ask: \"Mingyue, is there really no way?\"Wu Mingyue heard this and shook her head slightly: \"Presumably my protector has already been found.\"Just as her voice fell, in the distance, in the void, an old woman in a palace robe stepped into the sky and fell in front of Wu Mingyue.\"Sage...\" Xiao Chen condensed.That coercion is definitely a saint.Seeing Wu Mingyue, the old woman in the palace robe gave a slight salute: \"Your Royal Highness, can make the old man easy to find.\"\"Grandma Gui, you really got it.\" Wu Mingyue sighed, not surprised.\"Your Royal Highness, the trouble is almost the same, and it's time to go back.\" Grandma Gui said.\"Oh, after I go back, let me marry that arrogant, concubine champion?\" Wu Mingyue sneered.\"That's not necessarily true, only the best man is worthy of you, princess.\"Shen Dynasty will set up a big banquet for you this time, inviting young talents from all forces in the Wild Heaven and Immortal Territory to decide the final candidate for the horse.\"\"Also, I heard that the prince's son is also here this time, whether the princess has something to do with him, if it is him, maybe it is also a good choice.\" Grandma Gui said with a smile.Hearing this, Wu Mingyue's face was slightly unnatural.More than overlap?She has become Jun Xiaoyao's slave girl.It's just this, only she and Jun Xiaoyao know about it.And when Xiao Chen heard this, he directly exploded his hair.Grandma Gui mentioned who is not good, but when he mentioned Jun Xiaoyao, he almost hit Xiao Chen's muzzle.\"Huh, is Jun Xiaoyao worthy of Mingyue's finger?\" Xiao Chen said coldly.\"Huh? Where's the wild boy, dare to speak to the old man like this?\" Grandma Gui frowned, and a sage's pressure was released.Xiao Chen is not Jun Xiaoyao, how can he withstand the pressure of a saint.At the moment, a mouthful of blood was spit out, and it flew out.Wu Mingyue changed color, and whispered: \"Mrs Gui, stop it!\"\"Princess, who is this kid?\" Grandma Gui asked.\"He is the prince of Qinglong Ancient Country.\" Wu Mingyue said.\"Oh, it turned out to be a prince of a small country.\" Grandma Gui's face was so plain that she was a little contemptuous.As a pilgrim to Panwu God, she is indeed qualified to look down like this.\"This old witch...\" Xiao Chen got up, wiped off the blood from the corners of his mouth, his face was cold and cold, and he said in a cold voice.\"Xiao Chen, sorry, you are fine.\" Wu Mingyue said.Grandma Gui Gui said in a calm tone: \"Your Royal Highness, please understand your identity, this kind of small country prince is not worthy to be with you.\"\"Your husband-in-law, at least, must be a strong background and extraordinary strength like the son of the Jun family.\"\"Enough, Mother Gui, don't say anything, Mingyue will go back with you.\" Wu Mingyue ordered him to silence.Because she had already seen it, Xiao Chen's gloomy expression was somewhat terrifying.\"Princess, please.\" Grandma Gui didn't bother to care about small characters like Xiao Chen, and said calmly.Wu Mingyue followed.Xiao Chen squeezed his fists tightly, and said coldly: \"Xiu wants to look down on people, and when the moon chooses a horse, I, Xiao Chen, will definitely set foot on the palace of God!\"\"Oh, ants who are overwhelming.\" Mother Gui didn't care, and she left with Wu Mingyue.Wu Mingyue looked back and opened her lips slightly.Looking at Xiao Chen's firm face, the cruel truth could not be said anyway.If she said now, she has become Jun Xiaoyao's slave girl.Xiao Chen is afraid that he will explode in anger?\"Hey, I can only take one step to see if there is a chance in the future to let Na Jun Xiaoyao release my slave mark.\" Wu Mingyue sighed.Xiao Chen watched Wu Mingyue go away step by step, his fists clenched, blood dripping from his fingers.\"Ancestor, now that we have lost the keel, what should we do?\" Xiao Chen asked heartily.Without the keel, his Azure Sky Transforming Dragon Art could not go further and his strength could not be improved.When the time comes, what do you take to grab your relatives?grab the head?\"Hey, that son of the Jun Family, it's really scary...\" Master Qinglong sighed.He has never seen such a terrifying young man with strength and city government.In contrast, although Xiao Chen was excellent, he was far from enough.\"Ancestor, I must become stronger, marry the bright moon, and become the chariot of the Panwu God. Otherwise, I can't deal with Jun Xiaoyao at all.\" Xiao Chen gritted his teeth secretly.He is not stupid.imagined a possible path to success.\"In this way, there is only one last way.\" Master Qinglong sighed.\"Ancestor, please tell me, as long as there is a glimmer of hope, the kid will not give up!\" Xiao Chen's eyes lit up and said eagerly.\"Do you know, where did this deity come from?\" Master Qinglong asked suddenly.\"Please ancestors speak clearly.\" Xiao Chen said.\"The deity's technique was obtained by accidentally entering an ancient nest secret realm, and within that ancient nest, an ancient freak in the ancestral dragon nest is likely to be sealed.\" Qinglong Shangren said.\"Ancestral Dragon Nest~www.mtlnovel.com~Ancient freak?\" Xiao Chen looked surprised.There are indeed some arrogances. In their respective eras, for various reasons, they proclaimed themselves among the gods of the source of immortality, and they will re-enter the world when they have the opportunity to preach the Dao in a certain era in the future.This kind of arrogant is called an ancient freak, and every one of them is extremely terrifying. In their time, they can push the world.The kind of self-proclaimed several epochs is fortunate, and the difference between it and contemporary Tianjiao is not too big.But if you call yourself dozens of ancient freaks, or even hundreds of epochs or more, it will be terrifying, and you can't justify it with common sense.\"That ancient nest is extremely hidden, I'm afraid I don't even know the ancestral dragon's nest.\" Qinglong Shanghuan.\"The ancestor, the opportunity you mentioned is...\" Xiao Chen said.\"The self-styled ancient freak in the ancient nest should have an amazing origin and identity. In it, it should be possible to find the supreme blood of the Canglong line.\"\"With that supreme blood, your Azure Dragon Transformation Art is still possible.\" Master Qinglong explained.\"Well, I will go to the ancient nest afterwards.\" Xiao Chen clenched his fists, extremely excited.\"Of course, you have to be careful, if you awaken the ancient freak, I am afraid that the entire fairyland will be shaken.\"\"The younger generation of Xianyu, no one may be able to defeat the ancient freak.\" Master Qinglong's tone was slightly solemn.The birth of ancient freaks is no small matter.is likely to overwhelm the contemporary Tianjiao, no one can compete with it.At this moment, Xiao Chen did not hear the warning.He just wants to get the supreme blood of the Canglong line to make himself stronger, and then go to Panwu God to grab relatives.As for the consequences of awakening the ancient freak, what is his business?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Standing by your side, I feel like I'm about to enlighten and rise.\" Jun Xiaoyao casually smiled.If other people stand in front of Jiang Shengyi, they will definitely feel ashamed.and Jun Xiaoyao is completely different.His transcendent temperament is not inferior to Jiang Shengyi, it is even better.\"Then I will stay by your side every day from now on, won't it make you enlighten you every day?\" Jiang Shengyi joked and smiled slightly.Then, suddenly aware of the ambiguity, his face flushed.again thinks of the feeling of being in the secret store before, and the feeling of being in harmony with the sacred body of Jun Xiaoyao, only feeling that Yu Cheek is slightly hot.Jun Xiaoyao didn't seem to notice it, and said with a light smile: \"In the secret store, thanks to Sister Shengyi, otherwise I will definitely not be able to suppress the devil's corpse.\"\"Where, I'm just a support.\" Jiang Shengyi shook his head slightly.Then, as if to change the subject, he said, \"Luo Li, Na Nizi, but I think you are too tight, so I call every day to come out to find you.\"\"Jiang Lori...hey, starting in three years, the highest death penalty...\" Jun Xiaoyao sighed.Jiang Shengyi looked puzzled.Jun Xiaoyao occasionally always said a sentence or two that she could not understand.After a little chat, Jun Xiaoyao said goodbye to Jiang Shengyi.When Jiang Shengyi returned to the Jiang family crowd, the elder Jiang stepped forward and said: \"Shengyi, our Jiang family must deepen the relationship with the son of God, can you let Luo Li and son of God...\"The old parents of Jiang made gestures, obviously trying to match the two.The Jiang family will definitely agree to this.Jiang Shengyi's expression condensed slightly.After a while, he barely smiled and said: \"Yes, I will see if there is a chance to make me a matchmaker.\"\"Haha, that's good.\" Family Jiang said with a smile.Here, Jun Xiaoyao also returned to the Jun family team.He has no interest in marriage or Dao couple at all.After all, his goal is to suppress this era and set foot on the top of nine heavens and ten earth.\"Grandpa, go back.\" Jun Xiaoyao said.He can't wait to see what the fate is in the wooden box.\"Good.\" Jun Zhantian nodded slightly.A group of people from Jun's family also set off to return to Huangzhou.One of the three thousand states, Xuanzhou.This prefecture is the residence of Huanggu Ji's family.Ji family, as a barren ancient family, even if it is not among the three imperial families, but the strength of the foundation cannot be underestimated.As long as it is an ancient family, where can it be weak?Ji Bangyin, Ji Xuan, who looked like a walking dead, with a decadent and slumped face, returned to Ji's house.Suddenly, Ji's family made a huge wave.The elders of Ji Xuan's line are filled with righteous indignation, and they can't wait to step directly through the gate of the Jun family.The remaining few veins, although they are angry, but they can still keep calm.But until the end, there was nothing in the Ji family.Because of the Ji family, it is impossible to fight the Jun family because of a Ji Xuan who has been abolished.The two great ancient families are at war, it is an immortal battle, and the entire fairyland will be turbulent.The most important thing is that Ji Xuan is indeed being defeated by Jun Xiaoyao dignifiedly, rather than being framed and defeated.The younger generation fights for battle and kills, you die and you live, it's normal.Ji's family also couldn't find a sufficient reason to deal with the Jun family.Therefore, this matter can only be broken teeth and swallowed in the stomach.But Ji Bangyin can't stand this anger.With a decision in his heart, he came to the depths of Ji's house, outside a valley full of immortals.The entire valley seems to be shrouded in fairy light, and the four seasons are like spring.Ji Bangyin opened the mouth and said, \"Can Miss Qingyi be here?\"It is hard to imagine that a saint would speak to a junior in such a peaceful tone.It is conceivable that the status of this junior is so extraordinary.Not long after, a moving voice came from the valley, pearls and jade pans.\"Qingyi is here, what's the matter with the clan leader?\"did not see the person, only heard the voice.But this sound alone is enough to make people memorable.\"Ms. Qingyi, please, we must rectify the name of the Ji family and find a place for Ji Xuan.\" Ji Bangyin said solemnly.The one he entrusted to is Ji Qingyi, the most outstanding woman in the Ji family.is also the saint of the immortal sect, the immortal sect.The proud daughter of the Ji family, the goddess of the immortal religion, and the double identities make Ji Qingyi's status extremely detached.Ji Bangyin Next, I talked to Ji Qingyi about the secret of Yuantian.After a long time, Ji Qingyi's voice like a clear spring waterfall came.\"Qing Yi knows, but after that, Qing Yi wants to return to the Immortal Sect to pay homage to the remains of the remnant immortal. This matter will be taken to heart.\"\"Well, Ms. Qingyi's business is the most important thing.\" Ji Bangyin nodded and then left.\"The son of the Jun family, he seems to be an interesting character.\"\"I don't know, how much surprise can Qing Yi bring?\"A few days later, Jun Xiaoyao and others also returned to Huangzhou Jun's house.Among them, there was an episode.The nine-headed lion clan's gangster-level character, the Nine Spirit Yuansheng climbed the gate of the Jun family.Jun Xiaoyao appeared directly riding on nine lions.He wanted to see if this nine-headed lion clan tycoon would be as stupid as that Youlong Supreme. UU reading www.uukanshu.comSome onlookers outside, seeing Jun Xiaoyao appear riding on nine lions, their faces are even more shocked.The descendants who rode it in front of the Nine Spirits Yuansheng is a naked provocation!Just when the outside world thought that the Nine Spirits Yuanshenghui made a big noise in the Jun's house.The Nine Spirits Yuansheng said to the nine lions with a solemn expression: \"The dog leftovers, it is your luck to be favored by the prince's son, you will never suffer by following him. .\"In a word, everyone in the audience petrified.\"Is this still the overbearing Nine Spirit Yuansheng?\" Many monks looked dumbfounded.How come to the Jun's house in a couple, the Nine Spirits Yuansheng is just like a dog?\"Grandpa, you...\" The nine lions were also stunned, their bodies stiff, their hair exploded, and their tails tightened.It thought that the Nine Spirits Yuansheng was here to save him, so it said such a sentence?and also exposed its shameful real name.\"It turns out that your real name is Gougou.\" Jun Xiaoyao looked playful.\"Haha, the son of God is joking, our nine lions have difficulty in reproducing and survival in the same line. We have a low name and are good for reproduction.\" Jiuling Yuansheng said cheerfully.Nine lions want to cry without tears, at the moment they want to plow the soil, turn themselves into an ostrich, and bury them in the ground.Too shame, what kind of autistic challenge is this.This episode gave many people a clearer understanding of the deterrence of the Jun family.Even the powerful Nine Spirit Yuan Sage did not dare to be wild in front of the Jun Family Mountain, and even took the initiative to let his descendants follow the Jun Family God Son.After the incident ended, Jun Xiaoyao also returned to Tiandi Palace with peace of mind.\"It's time to explore the mystery of this wooden box.\" Jun Xiaoyao had expectation in his eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The book is too important for me.\" Jun Xiaoyao said.His ridiculous ancient Eucharist, coupled with the power of idols, plus one of the nine heavenly books.After \u3000\u3000 is fully trained, how strong will the physical body be?I'm afraid that the emperor who was physically proving Dao in the ancient times is far inferior to him, right?Inside the wooden box, besides the body book, there is a broken bronze fragment.Compared with the style book, this piece of bronze is very inconspicuous.doesn't look like some kind of fairy gold, it's very simple.Jun Xiaoyao held it in his hand, but unexpectedly discovered that he could not crush this piece of bronze fragment.Jun Xiaoyao's current physical strength is so powerful, not to mention crushing the gold, but at least ordinary prince weapons can be broken at will.And this seemingly humble bronze fragment is very strong.\"It's a bit weird, let's show it to Grandpa and the others later.\" Jun Xiaoyao put away the bronze fragment.Then, he took out the saint king's hand bone and five keel bones.Jun Xiaoyao has stripped the saint king's hand bones.The whole bone of the hand is as white as jade, imprinted with complex Dao patterns.Even if it is just placed there, the pressure of the holy realm is revealed.The reason why Ji Xuan can stand out among Tianjiao is that this saint king's hand bone occupies a big factor.A hand bone can create a powerful Tianjiao.But Jun Xiaoyao has no plans to integrate his hand bones into his arm.Other people's bones fuse into one's own body, and I panic when I think about it.And Jun Xiaoyao's ridiculous ancient sacred body is already one of the strongest physiques. When it is fully grown, it is many times stronger than the hand bone of the saint king.There is no need to give up everything.\"Although it won't fit into one's arm, it can be used to forge a magical artifact.\" Jun Xiaoyao muttered to himself.The saint king's hand bone, he intends to build a weapon.As for the five keels.Four of them are ancient keels, and Jun Xiaoyao prepares to reward Jun Zhanjian and others.After all, they have also exerted a lot of effort in the Yuantian Secret Store.The benefits that should be given are still to be given.As for the supreme ancestor keel, Jun Xiaoyao naturally refined it by himself.Afterwards, Jun Xiaoyao directly sacrificed himself from the Hell Furnace and inhaled the Supreme Ancestor Dragon Bone into it.In an instant, the billowing spirit surged.The power contained in the Dragon Bones of the Supreme Ancestor is so powerful that if Xiao Chen obtains it, it can directly cause him to undergo a major transformation.But now, it's all cheaper, Jun Xiaoyao.There was a crackling bean popping sound inside him, and it was a giant elephant particle awakening one after another.80,000...ninety thousand...In the end, the 100,000 giant elephant particles in Jun Xiaoyao completely awakened!Jun Xiaoyao's whole body~www.mtlnovel.com~ Take up the golden magic!Behind him, an extremely solid, substantive golden idol appeared, and the trunk curled up and roared up to the sky, quite suppressing the wasteland and roaring down the stars!Shenxiang Zhenyu Jin, at this moment, entered the first stage of Xiaocheng.Jun Xiaoyao raised his hands and feet, it was a billion catties of supernatural power bursting out, and he could smash the stars with one punch, and crash the ancient mountains!\"It's worthy of being the supreme ancestor keel, this energy is too huge.\" Jun Xiaoyao sighed.After the transformation of Idol's Prison Guard, the next step is to transform the giant elephant particles into dragon elephant particles.The dragon elephant particles are ten times stronger than the giant elephant particles.In other words, if Jun Xiaoyao converts all the giant elephant particles into dragon elephant particles, then his physical power will skyrocket ten times.is 10 billion catties of supernatural power!It's scary to think about it.In addition, the benefits brought by the Supreme Ancestor's keel are more than that.Because the ancestral dragon's blood is hidden in the ancestral dragon bone.This energy, combined with the dragon energy in Jun Xiaoyao's body, caused his dragon scale inner armor to transform again.Jun Xiaoyao moved slightly, and a slender green golden dragon armor that fits his body condensed out.This dragon armor is ten times stronger than the previous dragon scale inner armor.Jun Xiaoyao, who is added to the dragon armor, has a bit less celestial spirit, and has a bit more arrogance like a **** of war.At this moment, he is more like the real dragon emperor in the Ancestral Dragon Nest than Long Haotian and others.\"This dragon armor, it's called Qingtianzu dragon armor.\" Jun Xiaoyao smiled lightly.Originally this Azure Sky Ancestor Dragon Armor should be a means Xiao Chen could condense.But the dragon Qi and the supreme ancestor keel were both snatched by Jun Xiaoyao, so Jun Xiaoyao was fulfilled instead.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Looking at the outside world, it was a rare treasure.These more than 100 yuan of Xianyuan are already a large part of the Jun family's inventory.Now they are all given to Jun Xiaoyao.With these immortal sources, Jun Xiaoyao also sinks his heart and begins to temper the bones of Daluo and cultivate the immortal body of Daluo.He began to retreat again.And when Jun Xiaoyao was in retreat, the whole fairyland was not calm, and various news began to circulate.Such as Zulong's Nest, news comes out.The old man in his clan calculated the hexagram as if he saw a corner of the future and said a prediction.Ssangyong was born, and the ancestor dragon was born.As soon as this prediction came out, the entire Wild Heaven and Immortal Territory was slightly shaken.Does this mean that the Ancestral Dragon Nest is going to rise completely?Many people have figured that the dragon in the birth of Ssangyong should represent Long Aotian.After all, Long Aotian, but Zulong's Nest, the most outstanding early generation of taboos.And who is the other dragon?Some people think that Zulong's Nest is pointing the finger at Jun's house.After all, when he was in Yuantian's secret storage, Zulong's Nest suffered a big loss and lost a big face.Now Ancestral Dragon Nest, I want to find the place back.There are many people in the Ancestral Dragon Nest clamoring, why the son of the Jun family has not shown up.Some people think that Jun Xiaoyao may be avoiding the edge.But more people think that Jun Xiaoyao is keeping a low profile, and when he is born again, he will surely shake the whole fairyland again.In addition to the Ancestral Dragon's Nest, another famous line of the ancient royal family, Wanhuang Lingshan, also had a young Tianjiao who began to walk in the world.This line of the ancient royal family is not weak in the Ancestral Dragon Nest, and the relationship with the Ancestral Dragon Nest is very good.is somewhat similar to the relationship between the Jun family and the Jiang family.And I don't know where the rumors came from. The Ancestral Dragon's Nest and Wanhuang Lingshan seem to want to unite their blood to create an invincible young supreme with the blood of Ancestral Dragon and True Phoenix.Of course, this is just gossip, not many people believe it.After all, the Ancestral Dragon and the True Phoenix are both the top bloodlines, extremely domineering, and it is as difficult as heaven to merge together.In addition, there is news from Panwu Shenchao.Wu Mingyue, the eldest princess of the Panwu God Dynasty, will recruit horsemen in the near future.At that time, the entire sacred dynasty will set up a grand banquet, inviting all the forces of the Wild Heaven and Immortal Realm, young talents, to come to the banquet.The candidates for the horse will be selected at the banquet.This is big news, and it has caused a lot of waves in the entire fairyland.After all, if you can become the cohort of the immortal princess, it will be a step to the sky, which can reduce the struggle for many years.Of course, many people know it well.The young talents who are eligible to participate in the election of horses are either talented or have a solid background.That kind of grassroots civilians counterattack and marry the princess can only appear in the story of the storyteller.Many big powers of Tianjiao are also eager to try. They are making preparations and will go to the gods for a banquet in the future.And just when the fairyland was ups and downs.The four ancient kingdoms of Qinglong, Baihu, Suzaku, and Xuanwu also have undercurrents.Although these four ancient countries are not immortal, they are also the overlords of their own states.At this moment, in Huozhou, the ancient Suzaku palace, a palace.A beautiful woman in a red plume, sitting cross-legged and practicing.She has a slender figure, even if she is sitting, she shows beautiful curves.Long red hair, skin white as snow.A little cinnabar between her eyebrows makes her look more beautiful and charming.This woman is Bai Yuer.In Bai Yuer's body, the Suzaku divine fire and the aura of the Azure Dragon intertwined and flowed, and her aura was far stronger than before.has reached the early stage of Guiyi Realm.You must know that at this age, most of the ~www.mtlnovel.com~ who can reach this level are the immortal gods.Bai Yuer could not have this kind of cultivation speed originally.is Jun Xiaoyao's random charity, which fulfilled her.After some practice, Bai Yuer slowly opened his eyes.The bright crimson crystal eyes are as clear as rubies, and at this moment they are filled with a sense of melancholy and longing.\"It's been a long time and I haven't seen Lord God Son.\" Bai Yuer murmured, his tone somewhat low.It is hard to imagine that Bai Yu'er, who is regarded as a goddess by the entire Suzaku ancient country, is now thinking about another unreachable existence.Recently, she has also inquired a lot about Jun Xiaoyao.Tore and swallow the celestial sparrow, surrendered to nine lions, swept across the Supreme Vault, and even the Supreme Demon Corpse was suppressed in the end.This kind of news makes Bai Yuer very excited and emotional.The handsome and heroic posture of Jun Xiaoyao has appeared in front of her.Bai Yuer, and even paint Jun Xiaoyao's figure with brush all day long.\"Although Lord God Son may not care about me, I only have Lord God Son.\"Bai Yuer took out a picture of Jun Xiaoyao, rubbed his hand lightly, and muttered to himself.From the inside to the outside, she has been branded with Jun Xiaoyao.Just when Bai Yuer was thinking of Jun Xiaoyao.The voice of the maid came from outside the door.\"Your Royal Highness, I will report something urgent to you.\"\"Come in.\" Bai Yuer condensed his mind, put away the picture scroll, and said sternly.A maid walked in and bowed and said: \"Back to your Royal Highness, there is a message from the general that the ancient kingdom of Qinglong has been at war with the ancient kingdom of Baihu and Xuanwu.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Their army is very strong, and it seems that there are many mysterious masters who have nowhere to join.\"\"Is there such a thing?\" Bai Yuer was lost in thought.Now the Lord Suzaku is still in retreat.He got the Qilin Immortal, and after he recovered from his injury, the first thing he had to do was to retreat, in order to break through to the realm of the saint.But how could it be such a breakthrough in the realm of saints.Although the Lord of the Suzaku has accumulated for a long time, and with the help of undying medicine, it is not possible to break through to the realm of saints in a moment.Until now, the Lord of Suzaku has not left the customs.The entire state affairs of the ancient country of Suzaku are on the shoulders of Bai Yuer.After all, she saved the Lord of Suzaku, so now in the entire ancient country, except for the Lord of Suzaku, worship Yuer has the most influence.\"Let's wait and see the changes beforehand, our ancient country of Suzaku should not interfere.\" Bai Yuer waved his hand.With the current national power of the ancient country of Suzaku, they also have no ability to intervene.\"Yes.\" The maid retreated.Bai Yuer frowned slightly.\"Why, and where did the mysterious masters who helped Qinglong Ancient Kingdom come from?\"Bai Yuer was thinking.If she is still Xiao Chen's fianc\u00e9e, then naturally there is no need to worry about such things.But now, Bai Yu'er has not only severed all relations with Xiao Chen, but also turned against each other.In this case, Bai Yuer had to worry that the Qinglong Ancient Congress was attacking the Vermilion Ancient Country.\"I hope I think too much.\" Bai Yukotama rubbed his temples with fingers.But I don't know why.She has a vague sense of anxiety in her heart.Time is passing slowly.In the Emperor Tiandi Palace, Jun Xiaoyao is still in retreat.He tried to temper the bones in his body with the method in the body book.It took half a month before he tempered the first bone in his body into a big Luo fairy bone.Jun Xiaoyao thinks he is a bit slow, but if he is replaced by someone else, he may not be able to refine a piece of big Luo fairy bone in a few years.At the moment when the first big Luo fairy bone appeared, Jun Xiaoyao felt it, that bone, glowing golden, seemed to be branded with mysterious runes.And this big Luo fairy bone was in the arm, Jun Xiaoyao punched out, feeling that the mighty power was several times stronger than before.\"Yes, although the progress is a bit slow, but finally there are results.\" Jun Xiaoyao said to himself.A big Luo fairy bone has such a vivid effect, so how many more?In the end, if all 206 bones in the whole body were transformed into the big Luo fairy bones, how powerful would it be?Jun Xiaoyao is increasingly looking forward to the immortal body of Daluo.just when Jun Xiaoyao continued to retreat.There was another shocking news from the ancient country of the Four Elephants.Qinglong Ancient Kingdom, with an extremely powerful posture, broke through the ancient kingdoms of Baihu Ancient Kingdom and Xuanwu Ancient Kingdom.Even if the two ancient nations joined forces to resist, it was difficult to resist the army of the ancient Qinglong nation.This has caused quite a stir in dozens of states.But this is not a battle of immortal forces after all, so the influence is also limited, and it did not shake the entire fairyland.When Bai Yuer heard the news, his eyes trembled.The anxiety in my heart is more intense.Jinzhou, Baihu ancient country, within the palace.The White Tiger Lord and the Xuanwu Lord, their complexions were slightly pale at the moment, standing with their hands hanging down, obviously all Fang had experienced great wars and suffered serious injuries.They are both sage-level cultivation bases, but at the moment they are all wounded, and shock remains in their pupils.In front of them, the Azure Dragon Lord stood calmly.His cultivation is also a saint, not much higher than the two masters.But behind him, there are four figures shrouded in dark robes.The previous war, it was precisely because of the existence of these four people, plus the Azure Dragon Lord, that they were hit hard and led to the defeat of the two armies.\"Lord Qinglong, where did you invite your helper from?\" The Lord White Tiger was faintly unwilling.If it were not for these four figures, he alone would be able to contend against the Azure Dragon Lord.\"Hehe, why do you ask so much? As long as you know, I'm also working for the son.\" Qinglong Kingdom Lord smiled faintly.\"what?\"Upon hearing this, the two masters both showed surprise.The master of a country is actually doing things for others?And let it be called, or a young son?The two masters met once, and both saw the surprise in each other's eyes.\"Don't be suspicious, these four are also the people of that son.\" Qinglong Lord said lightly.At this time, the eyes of the White Tiger and Xuanwu Lords were even more shocking.These four powerful saints are all of that son?Who is that sacred son?How terrifying is his background ~www.mtlnovel.com~?\"Now, you only need to agree to two conditions.\"\"First, hand over your respective quarter of the compass.\"\"Second, the whole country submits to the son.\"\"These two conditions, promise, can live!\"\"Don't agree, die!\"Qinglong Kingdom's main voice was indifferent and said straightforwardly.Upon hearing the words, the two masters were even more humiliated.The compass is a heritage. Although it does not know its purpose, it is a symbol of a country.The four ancient countries each have a quarter of the compass.And the whole country surrendered to that son, it is also not a glorious thing.Just when the two masters were about to argue, the four dark figures suddenly took a step forward.The oppressive breath made the words of the two country masters choke in their throats, unable to speak.After a long time, the two country leaders nodded sullenly and agreed to the terms.The Lord Blue Dragon nodded his head after seeing this.After \u3000\u3000, after some treatment, the two countries also returned together.The Azure Dragon Kingdom Lord, however, came to the back of the palace, in a luxurious hall.In the hall, there are many enchanting dancers dancing.There is a big bed directly above, and the gauze curtain is hanging down, and a figure can be vaguely seen, leaning on several shadows.The green dragon king's palm spreads out, and there are two quaint mottled green dragon compass parts on it.\"Master, what you want has already been obtained.\" The Qinglong Kingdom's tone was somewhat respectful.From within that gauze account, he stuck out a powerful arm of Kong Wu, his five fingers stuck out and grabbed the two parts of the blue dragon compass into his hand.\"Very well, Qinglong Kingdom Lord, you did not disappoint Lord Benhou!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

If we said that before, the ancient kingdom of Suzaku did have something to do with the ancient kingdom of Qinglong, but now, not only does it have no relationship, but there is enmity.\"Xiao Chen was retired by Bai Yuer, and was driven out of the Jun's house in an extremely embarrassing manner, and even the Dragon Qi was taken away.It is naturally impossible for the Lord of the Blue Dragon to have any good feelings for the ancient kingdom of Suzaku and Bai Yuer.is even considered to be a rival.\"Oh, what's the reason?\" the voice asked.The Green Dragon Lord replied: \"The Suzaku ancient country emperor may have something to do with the son of the Jun family.\"\"The son of the monarch?\"That voice also brought a touch of hesitation and doubt.Now in the Wild Heaven and Immortal Realm, not many people have seen Jun Xiaoyao, but there are definitely a lot of people who have heard of Jun Xiaoyao's name.\"The son of the Jun family probably doesn't care about that kind of small country.\" The voice said faintly.\"It's just a reminder to my son.\" Qinglong Lord said.After Jun Linglong had subdued the ancient kingdom of Suzaku, the ancient kingdom of Suzaku did not make a public announcement.Because after all, this is not a glorious thing.So now, except for the Lord of Suzaku, Bai Yuer, and all the ministers who have witnessed.Everyone else didn't know that the ancient country of Vermilion was already a force under Jun Xiaoyao.\"Huh, remind me, don't talk about whether the Suzaku Ancient Kingdom is related to Jun Xiaoyao, even if there is, would the Lord Benhou be afraid?\"The voice said in a slightly uncomfortable tone.\"That is, that is, the son is a big man, and in the future is destined to stand on the top of the fairyland and overlook the sentient beings.\" The Qinglong Lord flattered.\"Well, it's good to know, then, directly gather the three kingdoms army to attack the ancient country of Suzaku, make it surrender, and bring the fragment of the blue dragon compass.\"\"Accomplished.\" Qinglong Kingdom master arched his hands.\"By the way, I heard that the Suzaku Queen worships Yuer, she is a rare beauty. Don't hurt her at that time. Bring her and become the concubine of Lord Benhou.\"\"Yes.\" The Green Dragon Lord nodded, and at the same time fluke.Fortunately, Bai Yuer and Xiao Chen broke off their relationship, otherwise, wouldn't this be a cuckold for his son himself?\"Don't worry, after the matter is done, the benefits will be indispensable to you. When the four ancient countries merge into the Four Elephants ancient country, you will be the only country leader.\" The voice chuckled.\"Thank you, son!\" Qinglong Kingdom's lord showed a hint of joy.Isn't that what he wants?Then, the lord of Qinglong retired.That voice was muttering to himself.\"When the four parts are collected to form a complete bronze compass, you may be able to find clues about the bronze fairy palace.\"\"If it succeeds, Lord Ben Hou will have a great opportunity. At that time, he will be sure to marry Wu Mingyue.\"\"Afterwards, I will enter Panwuling to get a chance, and then gradually control the power of Panwu Shen Dynasty.\"\"Finally, my Yang Pan will definitely be able to stand on top of nine heavens and ten earth, standing on top of all beings!\"That voice, with majestic ambition, the laughter echoed throughout the palace.Within a few days, the Qinglong Kingdom Master integrated the three-nation coalition forces and marched against the ancient country of Suzaku.And they didn't have the slightest concealment, so they marched toward Huozhou in a straightforward manner.The news soon passed back to the ancient country of Suzaku.Suddenly, the whole country is in panic.I heard that the ancient kingdom of Qinglong had annexed the ancient kingdom of Baihu and the ancient kingdom of Xuanwu, which has made many ministers of the ancient kingdom of Suzaku uneasy.Confirmed the news this time, and it made the entire Suzaku ancient country Ji Fei Gou jump up.In terms of the current national power of the ancient country of Suzaku, let alone the three-nation alliance, even if there is only one force in the ancient country of Qinglong, it is enough to cause life and death to the ancient country of Suzaku.The Allied Forces of the Three Kingdoms almost sentenced Suzaku to the death penalty.Suzaku ancient country, inside the palace.A group of ministers approached Bai Yuer.\"Your Royal Highness, please go and send a message to the son of the Emperor's family, and see if he can help!\"\"Yes, now that the lord of the country has not left the door, only the Jun family can save our ancient country of Suzaku!\"Many ministers who knew the truth strongly demanded that Bai Yuer go and ask the king to be happy.\"Well, ministers, don't worry, I will try.\" Bai Yuer said.Naturally, she was also anxious in her heart, so she took out the jade slip and sent a message to Jun Linglong.because she didn't have a direct way to contact Jun Xiaoyao.On Jun's side, Jun Linglong also received the message.But now, Jun Xiaoyao is still in retreat, it is impossible for Jun Linglong to disturb him because of this kind of thing.After receiving the news, Bai Yuer's heart sank slightly.Jun Xiaoyao retreats, unable to notify him.And Jun Linglong's status is far less than Jun Xiaoyao, it is impossible to mobilize the power of the Jun family to help the ancient kingdom of Suzaku.Only when Jun Xiaoyao comes forward in person can he be able to help Suzaku Ancient Kingdom~www.mtlnovel.com~ but the problem is that he is in retreat and no one can disturb him.Bai Yuer told the ministers of this news.\"How could this happen? Could it be that the sky is going to destroy the ancient country of Suzaku?\" Some ministers looked pale.\"That's not the case, the ancient kingdom of Qinglong should only want us to surrender, and then see what their attitude is.\" Bai Yuer said.Next, the ancient country of Suzaku also entered a state of preparation.The external forces are not optimistic about the ancient country of Suzaku.even thinks that this is a battle with pebbles and rocks.There is no suspense at all, but it's just the time.Of course, there is this kind of speculation, but also because they did not know that the ancient country of Suzaku was already owned by Jun Xiaoyao.If they knew this, they would never have such a view.just a few days.The Allied Forces of the Three Kingdoms have already entered the range of Huozhou, and their target is the ancient capital of Vermilion.Along the way, all cities were destroyed without resistance.Most of the forces in the ancient country of Suzaku were also concentrated in the imperial capital.Regardless of the final result, the ancient kingdom of Suzaku cannot sit still and die.Just when the final battle of the four ancient countries is about to break out.Jun's house, inside the Tiandi Palace.There is a strong aura permeating, and there is Haoguang rising.There is a mist of fairy radiance, which makes people feel that in the palace of the Emperor of Heaven, it is like a supreme true fairy sitting cross-legged.Outside the Heavenly Emperor Palace, Jun Linglong, Jun Xuehuang, Jun Zhanjian, and Jun Wanjie are all present.Their eyes also showed surprise and joy.\"The **** child is finally going out!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Today, I may not be able to stop the son's move.\" Jun Wanjie thought.\"I have been in retreat for almost a year, and only six big Luo fairy bones have been refined.\" Jun Xiaoyao shook his head and sighed inwardly.He also didn't expect that hundreds of peerless and rare Xianyuan had only tempered six big Luo fairy bones.This kind of consumption is too scary.\"If ordinary people are allowed to cultivate the Immortal Immortal Body of Daluo, it is estimated that just looking for resources, they don't know how many years to find.\" Jun Xiaoyao secretly said.If you look at his right arm at this moment, you will find that his right arm is faintly surrounded by celestial clouds and immortal.The six big Luo fairy bones tempered by Jun Xiaoyao are all concentrated on the right arm.In this way, the power can be concentrated, and part of the effect of Daluo Immortal Bone can be exerted earlier.\"Congratulations to the son of God!\"Jun Linglong four people, Qi Qi bowed to Jun Xiaoyao.Jun Xiaoyao waved his hand slightly.Then, he took out four ancient keels.\"My son, this...\" Jun Zhanjian and others were puzzled.\"These four ancient keels, one for each of you.\" Jun Xiaoyao said lightly.\"My son, this is too expensive...\" Jun Xuehuang said, feeling flattered.Ancient keel, looking at the outside world, they are all rare treasures.Jun Xiaoyao is alone, and they won't have any complaints, after all, Jun Xiaoyao contributes the most.\"It's all from your own family, so you can hold it, no need to shirk it.\" Jun Xiaoyao smiled lightly.\"Yes, thank you God!\" Jun Zhanjian and the others hesitated, but nodded.There is a hint of gratitude in their expressions.This keel also has a great effect on them.Jun Xiaoyao's move can be said to have strengthened their belief in following.\"By the way, son, Linglong has something to tell.\" Jun Linglong stepped forward as if thinking of something.\"Say.\" Jun Xiaoyao said.Then, Jun Linglong simply told Jun Xiaoyao about the Suzaku ancient country.\"It turned out to be like this, I understand.\" Jun Xiaoyao nodded lightly.At this moment, the mechanical sound of the system came into his mind again.\"Ding, congratulations to the host, the new sign-in location has been refreshed, please sign in at the Suzaku Ancient Kingdom Palace!\"\"Is the system going to be given for nothing again?\" Jun Xiaoyao's eyes narrowed and his expression was very calm.He originally planned to visit the ancient country of Suzaku himself.The system is really sweet.\"The son, what should we do?\" Jun Linglong asked.The reason why she fell in love was not because she worshiped Yuer, but because the ancient kingdom of Suzaku was Jun Xiaoyao's private power.is not good for the ancient country of Suzaku. Doesn't it endanger the interests of Jun Xiaoyao?\"Send my order to mobilize the monarch's style, forest, fire, mountain, four guards, 10,000 each.\"Jun Xiaoyao spoke indifferently and handed a golden token to Jun Linglong.That is the order of the son of God and the symbol of the identity of the son of Jun Xiaoyao.\"We want to mobilize the four guards of Fenglin Volcano!\" Jun Zhuangjian and the others, with shock hidden in their pupils.Fenglin Volcano Four Guards is a powerful force of the Jun family.are Feng Yingwei, Yulinwei, Fire Cavalry Guard, and Mountain God Guard.The Fenglinhuoshan four guards are not the only military force of the Jun family, but they are quite famous among them.They helped the Jun family, suppressed the resistance of the four parties, and protected the territory of the Jun family's major states. The place they passed was like a torrent of steel, no one can stop!Among the four sergeants, the weakest have the cultivation base of the Nirvana Realm, and there are many strong men in the Heaven-Through Realm and the Divine Fire Realm.Moreover, these four guards, the geniuses of the Jun family, absolutely cannot be mobilized.Even if it is the top ten sequence, if you want to transfer, you have to go through some procedures, and the number of transfers cannot be too much.Only Jun Xiaoyao is eligible to mobilize Fenglinhuo's four guards at will, unlimited number and unlimited conditions.As long as the **** child order is taken out, it can be transferred.\"God, let's go too, just as an experience.\" Jun Zhanjian said.Jun Xiaoyao pondered slightly, nodded and said: \"Yes, then you guys should also prepare.\"\"Yes.\" Jun Zhanjian and others arched their hands and went to prepare.Jun Xiaoyao stood with his hand in his hand and muttered to himself: \"The ancient country of the four elephants, but the force I am going to take over, who dares to pick my peaches, who will be?\"Jun Xiaoyao doesn't think that one ancient country of Qinglong alone can conquer other ancient countries. U U Reading www.uuk\uff41nshu.comJun Linglong also said when he told him the news, there seemed to be a mysterious force helping Qinglong Ancient Kingdom.Among them, it's worth thinking about.Jun Xiaoyao is also very curious, who is the person standing behind the ancient kingdom of Qinglong?And that person's purpose, is it simply to unify the ancient kingdom of four elephants?\"It seems that these four ancient countries should not be that simple. There may be some unknown history behind them. When the time comes, you will know about Bai Yuer.\" Jun Xiaoyao said to himself.Then, he went directly to Jun Zhantian.Suzaku's ancient country is not a big deal to him.Even if he was killed accidentally, Jun Xiaoyao would only feel a little pity.As for Bai Yu'er, Jun Xiaoyao didn't care about it at all, it was just a chess piece in his hand.What Jun Xiaoyao wants to understand now is the bronze fragment in the wooden box.Therefore, he went to find Jun Zhantian.However, after Jun Zhantian saw the bronze fragment, his expression became extremely solemn.\"Xiaoyao, where did this fragment come from?\" Jun Zhantian asked.\"The Yuantian Secret Store should have been brought by Yuantian Supreme from a foreign land.\" Jun Xiaoyao said.To Jun Zhantian, he has nothing to hide.\"It turns out that this is the case. This bronze fragment is too deeply involved.\" Jun Zhantian said solemnly.It was the first time Jun Xiaoyao saw that Jun Zhantian's face was so solemn.\"Grandpa, where does this bronze fragment come from?\" Jun Xiaoyao couldn't help being more curious.\"Xiaoyao, have you ever heard of the seven incredible things of Xianyu?\" Jun Zhantian said solemnly.\"Seven incredibles?\" Jun Xiaoyao's eyes flashed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

All people who see the ship, no matter who it is, even the saints, will be confused, and then board the ship and head to the end of Huangquan.For example, the rumors of the swordsman with the broken head, there is a headless figure holding a rusty and **** sword, walking in all corners of the fairyland with unconsciousness, and all the monks who encounter the swordsman with the broken head will encounter ominousness. Ordinary monks, up to the supreme, without exception.All kinds of such legends finally formed seven incredible things.It can be said that every incredible thing represents a mystery of Xianyu, which is a taboo.Generally speaking, no monk is willing to contaminate these, because these are incredible, too ominous, and too weird, and they can kill the monk at every turn.\"Grandpa means that this piece of bronze is related to one of the seven incredible things?\" Jun Xiaoyao's eyes flashed.\"That's right, among the seven incredible things, there is a legend of a bronze immortal palace. This bronze fragment may come from the bronze immortal palace.\" Jun Zhantian said in a condensed tone.\"Bronze Immortal Palace?\" Jun Xiaoyao was slightly surprised.Bronze Immortal Palace is also one of the seven incredible things.That is a very strange and ominous fairy hall.Although it is called Xiandian, in the eyes of many people, it is almost like a tomb.The strong ones who entered it, nine out of ten have fallen.And the reason why this bronze fairy hall is so attractive is because it is rumored to have something related to immortals.Anything related to immortals is enough to make all monks rush.Throughout the ages, I don't know how many young supreme, a hero, a powerful saint, entered the bronze fairy hall, wanting to explore the mystery of the immortal, and get the chance of the immortal.But most of them have fallen.Even the few cultivators who escaped were silent and kept silent about the situation in the fairy hall, as if they were afraid of something.It is precisely because of this that the Bronze Immortal Palace will be listed as one of the seven incredible things.Jun Zhantian's tone was serious, and he said to Jun Xiaoyao: \"Xiaoyao, your talent is unmatched. Even if you don't take risks, you can become a saint and be an ancestor in the future. It is not impossible to prove the emperor. Don't put yourself in danger because of curiosity. \"Jun Xiaoyao is now the treasure of the Jun family, the core existence, there must be no accidents.If Jun Xiaoyao had to look for traces of the bronze fairy hall because of a piece of bronze fragment, then Jun Zhantian would not agree.\"Heh, grandpa don't need to be so nervous, grandson just asks casually.

Knowing the young man behind the three ancient kingdoms, she will never give up.\"Hmph, what's the matter when it comes, can it make some waves in front of the son?\" Jun Wanjie sneered.In front of the ancient monarch's house, the dragon had to lie on its back and the tiger had to lie down!Next, Jun Xiaoyao also entered the imperial capital.All the people of the ancient country of Suzaku knelt and kowtow to Jun Xiaoyao.Countless cheers and praises of Jun Xiaoyao spread everywhere.Jun Xiaoyao's expression was very plain.These people regard him as a savior and a saint of heart.In fact, he was just trying to protect a chess piece in his hand.But this kind of good reputation in vain, don't want it.After all, there are already many Tianjiao who are saying that Jun Xiaoyao is the devil.Jun Xiaoyao also has to shape his own image a bit, he is not a devil.At best, I prefer to cut leeks.After stepping into the imperial palace of the ancient Suzaku, Jun Xiaoyao also heard a system prompt in his mind.\"Ding, I have arrived at the Suzaku Palace, do you sign in?\"\"Sign in.\" Jun Xiaoyao said silently.\"Ding, congratulations to the host, get a four-star reward, Gu Shengbing, Guqin, Fengming Qishan!\"After the voice of the system fell, Jun Xiaoyao immediately sensed it.A red gilt guqin appeared in his space artifact.The whole guqin has a long and slender shape, with a phoenix landscape pattern on the surface, and dark gold trim, which is low-key and luxurious.The seven strings, the roots of which are red crystal, look very gorgeous and dazzling.\"It turned out to be a piano.\" Jun Xiaoyao was silent.Is the system for him to cultivate his character?However, the level of this guqin is a rare ancient sage soldier, and it is not ordinary.Ordinary saints are almost using ancient saints.Moreover, the purpose of Fengming Qishan is obviously not just for pleasure.The mysterious guardian of Jun Xiaoyao before, turned the sound of the piano into a killing blade, so that even the saint could suffer heavy injuries.Therefore, even if this Fengming Qishan Qin is used as a weapon, its power cannot be underestimated.\"It's not a disadvantage.\" Jun Xiaoyao secretly said.He just signed one at random, and the system gave him an ancient sage for nothing.\"It seems that I can play the piano in the future. Fortunately, I have heard some famous songs in my previous life, but I haven't forgotten them.\" Jun Xiaoyao thought.\"God, what's the matter?\" Kingdom Lord Suzaku couldn't help asking when seeing Jun Xiaoyao standing still.\"Nothing, let's go.\" Jun Xiaoyao said.After that, the Lord of Suzaku took Jun Xiaoyao to a luxurious building.Jun Xiaoyao asked Jun Zhanjian and others to rest on their own.In the entire building, only Jun Xiaoyao, Suzaku Kingdom Lord, and Bai Yuer were left.Jun Xiaoyao said: \"I have something to ask you.\"\"God, please speak.\" Suzaku Kingdom Master said respectfully.\"What historical secrets do you have in these four ancient countries?\" Jun Xiaoyao said.After hearing this, the Lord of the Suzaku thought for a while and said: \"It's true that it is true. In fact, according to historical records, the predecessor of our four ancient kingdoms was an ancient dynasty close to immortal forces, called the Four Elephants.\"\"The founder of the Four Elephant Ancient Kingdom was a supreme and powerful man named Sixiang Supreme, and the founder of our four ancient kingdoms, Master Qinglong, Master White Tiger, Master Suzaku, and Master Xuanwu, They are the four disciples of the Venerable Four Elephants.\"The explanation from the Lord Suzaku made Jun Xiaoyao raise his eyebrows slightly.He did not expect that the four ancient countries would have such historical origins.\"In this way, the goal of the Qinglong country lord should be to unify the four ancient countries, make it become the four elephant ancient country again, and then become the country lord himself.\" Jun Xiaoyao guessed.\"However, what is the purpose of the young man behind him? Is it just to control the ancient Sixiang country?\" Jun Xiaoyao was puzzled.On the side he worshiped Yuer and bit his lip slightly and said, \"My Lord God, Yuer has a guess.\"\"Oh, let's hear it.\" Jun Xiaoyao said.\"Yu'er thinks that the young man behind them should want to gather the bronze compass parts of the four ancient countries.\" Bai Yuer said.\"Bronze compass parts?\" Jun Xiaoyao looked inexplicably.The Lord Suzaku explained it a bit.It turned out that the four elephant supreme who created the ancient country of the four elephants once got a bronze compass by chance.The bronze compass involves a big secret.Later, the news was leaked out somehow, and many powerful people wanted to compete for the compass in the hands of the Sixiang Supreme.Sixiang Zhizun was besieged and suffered heavy losses.He secretly divided the bronze compass into four parts and gave them to his four disciples, namely Master Qinglong and others.Later, the four disciples each created a country, which is now the four ancient countries.That quarter of the bronze compass parts have become antiquities passed down from generation to generation in the four ancient countries.\"Show me that part.\" Jun Xiaoyao said lightly.Lord Suzaku nodded respectfully.If someone else dared to pay attention to the parts of the bronze compass, the Lord Suzaku slapped him.But when Jun Xiaoyao spoke, he took it out without hesitation.When Jun Xiaoyao saw that part, a faintly surprised color appeared in the bottom of his eyes.Because he discovered that the bronze compass parts were of the same material as the bronze fragments in the wooden box before.And that bronze fragment is related to one of the seven incredible bronze fairy halls.\"So, I understand. No wonder the Sixiang Supreme will be besieged. This bronze compass does involve a big secret, it is the bronze fairy palace!\"Jun Xiaoyao secretly said in his heart. UU reading www.uukanshu.comThis is definitely a big secret.He now knows what the purpose of that young man is.He must have also learned that the bronze compass is related to the bronze fairy palace.\"This compass is interesting.\" Jun Xiaoyao said playfully.The Lord Suzaku observed his words and thoughts, and immediately said: \"Since the son of God likes it, it will be given to the son of God.\"Jun Xiaoyao nodded in satisfaction, this Suzaku kingdom master was also very familiar.\"The remaining three parts must already be in the hands of the young man. Now, even if he doesn't come to trouble, this **** child will find his trouble...\"Jun Xiaoyao showed his usual smile.But Jun Zhanjian and others who are familiar with this smile know.This smile means that Jun Xiaoyao is about to start cutting leeks again...Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Your millions of coalition forces can't even attack a small ancient Suzaku country!\"\"The compass components were not brought to Lord Benhou, even the worship of Yuer was not brought, are you all the waste of feces!\"The voice was extremely angry, with a sense of coldness.The Qinglong Kingdom Lord and others bowed their heads slightly and kept silent.They had long been used to the moody, violent, violent personality of the young man.The dignified saint, being reprimanded in this way, the white tiger kingdom master and the Xuanwu kingdom master, their faces were alternately blue and white, secretly gritting their teeth.But when they saw the four dark figures standing around, the anger in their hearts all turned into weakness.\"The son of the Jun family, Jun Xiaoyao, huh...Do you really treat yourself as a person?\" The voice was cold and harsh.Jun Xiaoyao's status, status, and strength are indeed rare.But it does not mean that no one can compete with him.Although the Jun family is extremely prosperous and brilliant, it is impossible to cover the sky in the fairyland.This young man doesn't believe in this evil.\"Let the order go on and reorganize the army. Three days later, Lord Benhou will be conquered by himself, to see the son of the monarch, will he give him this face?\" The voice shouted coldly.\"Yes, follow orders.\" The Qinglong Kingdom Lord and the others arched their hands, and then withdrew from the hall.\"As long as you gather the last part, you can get a complete bronze compass, which will be extremely helpful for exploring the bronze fairy palace at that time.\"\"No one can interfere with Lord Benhou, even the son of the Jun family!\"Late at night.The Suzaku Palace, a luxurious building.The long sound of the piano faintly floated out of the pavilion, which was audible and refreshing, as if sublimated.In the pavilion, Jun Xiaoyao sits cross-legged on the bed, and Fengming Qishan Qin is on his lap.The white and slender fingers move the seven strings, and the sound of the piano is leisurely.This song is one of the ten famous guqin songs that Jun Xiaoyao has heard in his previous life.Listening to it, the impetuous mood seems to be smoothed.Jun Xiaoyao didn't pay attention to the so-called son at all, and seemed very leisurely and relaxed.When Jun Xiaoyao was playing the piano, he also vaguely felt a faint spirit fluctuation.\"Is it my mysterious protector?\" Jun Xiaoyao muttered.His guardian seemed to use the sound of the piano as a means of attack.Hearing Jun Xiaoyao playing the piano at this moment, it is inevitable to show a trace of fluctuation.After a tune, the mysterious protector never showed up.However, the door was knocked.\"Enter.\" Jun Xiaoyao said calmly.Wearing a red gauze skirt, Bai Yuer walked in with tea.\"God, please use tea.\" Bai Yuer said obediently.She finally asked Jun Linglong for the opportunity to pour tea for Jun Xiaoyao.Bai Yuer served tea while secretly looking at Jun Xiaoyao.At this moment, Fuqin's Jun Xiaoyao has a different temperament, and it is even more extraordinary.Any woman who just glances at it is afraid that she will fall into it and cannot extricate herself from it.\"Yeah.\" Jun Xiaoyao put away Fengming Qishan and took the tea.Take a sip.He glanced at Bai Yuer, and suddenly found that the red gauze dress she was wearing now seemed a bit transparent.The white jade skin is looming.There is a faintly charming temptation.Jun Xiaoyao turned a blind eye and continued to drink tea.Bai Yuer bit her lip slightly and said: \"God, I have a special feature in the ancient Suzaku, it is the Suzaku Spirit Spring.

It was the three kingdom masters Qinglong, Baihu, and Xuanwu.However, what made the Lord of Suzaku and others noticed was.Behind the three of them, in the void, there was a gorgeous bed carved out of gold.That's right, it's an extremely wide bed.The four corners of the bed are carved with dragon heads.There are also gauze tents covering all sides, but vaguely, you can see many graceful shadows in it.In this scene, the Suzaku Kingdom Master was a little surprised.Could it be that the mysterious young man in the eyes of the Lord Qinglong was on the bed.But this is too weird, who would make a bed sacrifice into a royal artifact?Lord Suzaku thought of this, but his face was abrupt.\"No...Is that one?\" The Suzaku's heart sank slightly.If it is really what he guessed, then the situation is not good.Even with the support of the Jun Family God, it would be extremely troublesome.\"Haha, Lord Suzaku, meet again.\" Lord Qinglong chuckled lightly.This time he seemed very confident.\"It seems that you are still unwilling to die. Didn't you eat enough of your last loss?\" Kingdom Lord Vermilion was also very hardened.He is backed by the Jun Family God Son, so there is no need to be too jealous of the mysterious son.At this moment, from the golden dragon bed, there was an extremely cold and arrogant voice.\"Lord Suzaku, Lord Benhou will give you one last chance, surrender to me, hand over something like that, and...\"The voice paused, then said.\"Let the emperor worship Yuer and become the concubine of Lord Benhou.\"The arrogant and arrogant tone resounded between heaven and earth.The faces of people on the side of Suzaku ancient country were flushed with anger.The Lord Suzaku's face was also extremely cold, but his heart sank completely when he heard the mysterious son calling himself Lord Benhou.Ten have, that is, that one can't be wrong.However, at this moment.A more icy and domineering voice sounded from the sky.\"Let the person of the son of God become a concubine, what are you?!\"In the depths of the imperial capital, a golden light burst out.It was a mighty and mighty nine-headed lion, pulling a golden chariot into the air.A peerless figure of abundance **** stepped on the chariot, like a white-clothed **** king, shaking the world with power!And behind him, the four Jun swordsmen, leading Fenglinhuo's four guards, seemed to be crushed by four torrents of destruction!\"The Son of the Jun Family is here!\"\"That's the top of the Primordial royal family, nine lions, actually used to pull carts!?\"\"Fenglin Volcano four guards are also here!\"Allied forces of the three ancient nations suddenly rioted.After all, there are still shadows in their hearts.Not only the Four Guards of Fenglin Volcano, but also Jun Xiaoyao, Slaying the Immortal Sword Art, killing tens of thousands of sergeants with one sword, it is a devil!Jun Xiaoyao stands above the sky of the imperial capital.The arrival of him and Fenglinhuo's four guards calmed the hearts of everyone in the ancient kingdom of Vermilion.Bai Yuer's eyes flashed, revealing joy.Because what Jun Xiaoyao is talking about is a person who is the son of God.That means she belongs to Jun Xiaoyao.Even if it is a female slave, it is also Jun Xiaoyao's female slave.\"Son of God.\" The Lord Suzaku arched his hand slightly towards Jun Xiaoyao.Jun Xiaoyao waved his hand and looked at the golden dragon bed.He had some guesses, and if he was right, he would not leave ten.\"The son of the king's family is as arrogant and arrogant as the rumors are.\"A cold voice came from the golden dragon bed.Jun Xiaoyao's reprimand made him extremely unhappy, but due to the power of the son of the Jun family, he was not directly angry.\"It seems that you are the man behind the three ancient kingdoms.\" Jun Xiaoyao stood with his hands in his hands, his tone of voice faint.\"Black Hand? Haha, Lord Benhou just wants to subdue some subsidiary forces.\" That voice said.Jun Xiaoyao's eyes flashed.This is obviously an excuse.His purpose is the bronze compass inherited from the four ancient countries.To subdue the power is nothing more than a cover-up.And he called himself Lord Benhou.Jun Xiaoyao has almost guessed who he is.\"My son doesn't like someone hiding his head and showing his tail in front of me~www.mtlnovel.com~ show up!\"Jun Xiaoyao's face was faint, his hand squeezed his fist mark and blasted out with a punch.His realm at the moment was in the late Guiyi realm, and it was much better than the previous Shenqiao realm.The same moves and bursts of power are completely different.A lifelike golden dragon blasted out the boxing edge that was entwining him. It was Dragon Fist.Everyone only heard a dragon chant, a golden dragon, passing by, bombarding the golden dragon bed.Jun Xiaoyao hasn't blessed the power of the idols to restrain the prison, but this punch is enough to crush thousands of mountains!\"Humph!\"There was a cold snort in the golden dragon bed.A palm came out, the mana gushing out, as if it instantly turned into ten thousand palms, slapped the void, causing the space to be slightly shaken and overturned.\"Huh? Hunyuan Sanshou...

How does it feel as terrifying as a saint?The violent air wave swept the Quartet, and Jun Xiaoyao's figure remained unshakable.But the golden dragon bed was shaken back, and even the gauze tents were torn and fluttered.Finally revealed the figure in it.Many of the exposed Mi Ji was directly shaken to death by this shock wave, and fell on the bed in all directions.In the center of the bed, a young man with a jade crown on his head and a red gold robe, an ordinary, featureless youth with a cold expression on his face, staring at Jun Xiaoyao.\"Sure enough, it is you, Panwu Shenchao, champion Hou!\" Jun Xiaoyao said indifferently.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He had a lowly status, and he was warm and cold in the world.However, one day, he accidentally picked up a divine sword, and has since risen all the way.That divine sword is not another sword, it is the founder of the Panwu dynasty, one of the three swords of the Pan Emperor once forged by the Great Emperor Panwu, the Panhuang Shengling Sword!Yang Pan relied on the Pan Emperor's Spirit Sword to rise step by step, seizing various opportunities, and finally became the champion of Panwu God Dynasty.Even many people in the Panwu dynasty believed that Yang Pan was very likely the reincarnation of the Panwu Emperor.Of course, this news is somewhat illusory and has not been confirmed.But no matter what, Yang Pan's noble status in the Panwu dynasty is beyond doubt.There is even news that this time the eldest princess of the Shen Dynasty Wu Mingyue chose Yang Pan.It can be seen that the Panwu God Dynasty placed much importance on Yang Pan.And now, when the champion Hou Zhan revealed his identity, except for Jun Xiaoyao and other people who guessed it, everyone else was shocked.\"It's really him, champion Hou Yangpan...\" The Lord Suzaku took a deep breath, feeling extremely uneasy.This is definitely an extremely arrogant evildoer in Huangtian Immortal Territory, and his strength is terrifying.And the most important thing is that because this Yang Pan rose from the end of the day and came from the bottom, his personality is also very extreme, arrogant and moody.It's like a petty citizen who wins 100 million prizes at once, and his heart will definitely expand.Champion Hou belongs to this kind of psychological expansion.Bai Yuer's face paled slightly, a little afraid.She couldn't imagine what the consequences would be if Jun Xiaoyao didn't come.Following this champion, there is absolutely no end to it.His concubine room is already more than three thousand.This is the mentality of the nouveau riche at the bottom. The beauties who had never dreamed of getting them before, now see one by one.Not only the Suzaku ancient country was surprised.The Lord Baihu and the Lord Xuanwu also showed surprises, and it made sense to think of his moody personality.\"No wonder, it turned out to be the champion of Panwu Shenchao...\" The two masters sighed secretly in their hearts.To be honest, champion Hou is not a benefactor.They even would rather let Jun Xiaoyao be the master than follow the champion.Now, the black hands behind the three ancient countries are exposed, and the situation is instantly clear.Obviously, this is a contest between the son of the Jun family and the champion of the gods.Jun Xiaoyao took a deep look at Champion Hou, and a strange color flashed under his eyes.\"So that's it, his breath...\" Jun Xiaoyao muttered in his heart, understanding something.\"Son of the Jun family, we met for the first time, but it was not very pleasant.\" Yang Pan said indifferently.There was a hint of jealousy in his eyes.Yes, it is jealous.He was jealous of nothing else, it was Jun Xiaoyao's appearance.Yang Pan's appearance was unremarkable, let alone compare with Jun Xiaoyao, even Xiao Chen was much more handsome and handsome than him.Yang Pan has a narrow personality and selfishness. After becoming a champion from the bottom of the house, his personality remains the same as before.Jun Xiaoyao glanced at the jumbled corpse on the golden dragon bed, and sneered softly: \"It turned out to be a multi-person exercise for such a big bed.\"\"What do you mean?\" Yang Pan narrowed his eyes slightly.\"I said that a young man who raises a horse has the courage to pick peaches from this god!\" Jun Xiaoyao's tone was cold and ironic.As early as when Jun Xiaoyao accepted Yu'er as a slave, he had already planned to conquer the ancient kingdom of Sixiang.Unexpectedly, the champion Hou Heng intervened.However, upon hearing this, the entire battlefield was silent.Raising a horse as a servant is an eternal shame in Yang Pan's heart and cannot be mentioned in the past.After Yang Pan became the champion, he directly destroyed the palace where he had been.There are hundreds of people in the whole government, not one staying!From then on, no one dared to mention his past in front of Yang Pan.But now, Jun Xiaoyao said indifferently that Yang Pan is a small servant who raises horses.This is simply a pain in Yang Pan's heart.\"Jun Xiaoyao, you are looking for death!\"Yang Pan's eyes were dark, his face was blue, and he couldn't bear it anymore, so he shot directly.As soon as he pointed it out, the mana surged, condensing into a crimson mana giant finger, crushing Xiang Jun Xiaoyao.It is the supernatural power of the Panwu dynasty, Haoyang divine finger.\"Oh, who is looking for death, something that is overpowering!\"Jun Xiaoyao's face was indifferent, urging his idol to suppress prison.One hundred thousand giant elephant particles erupted, and the body instantly blessed one billion catties of supernatural power.That power, how surging, can blast Cangyu with one punch!Jun Xiaoyao grabbed his probe, and the Spear of the Underworld condensed out and was thrown out by him, as if it had penetrated the void!The spear of the underworld collided with Haoyang's giant finger, like a big star collision, and the mana ripples shook the sky!In such a collision, the Haoyang God Finger was directly pierced by the Spear of the Underworld God, and then rushed towards Yang Pan unabated.\"Your strength...!\" Yang Pan's expression changed.Before Jun Xiaoyao reached the late Guiyi Realm~www.mtlnovel.com~, it was enough to surprise him.And now, the power of Jun Xiaoyao's moves exceeded his expectations.\"Tiangang God Seal!\"Yang Pan hurriedly made another move, pinching the seal with both hands, pushing it horizontally, and blasting towards the Spear of the Underworld.But that billion jin of terrifying force directly changed Yang Pan's expression!Puff!Yang Pan's figure was blown away like a kite with a broken wire, and the spear of the underworld fell directly on the golden dragon bed, smashing it to pieces.The scene fell into a dead silence...\"This... how could it be, that's the champion Hou Yangpan.\" Many people were astonished and petrified.How could the champion of the dignified immortal dynasty be so vulnerable?\"It's not that the champion Hou is weak, but the king's son is too strong!\" An ancient Suzaku general said with enthusiasm in his eyes.The worship of Jun Xiaoyao by all the people in the ancient country of Vermilion rose once again.Even the champion Hou can be easily defeated, and the son of the Jun family is indeed an invincible existence of the younger generation.However, some people also expressed doubts.\"Hey, that champion Hou...\" Jun Wanjie's eyes condensed, revealing doubts.He once played against champion Hou, and even he felt a great pressure.Although Jun Xiaoyao's strength is incredible now.But no matter how unbearable the champion Hou is, he won't lose so easily, right?Besides, the champion Hou still has the strongest hole card, and the Pan Emperor Life Sword is useless.Just as everyone was talking about it, Jun Xiaoyao was indifferent, saying a little bit.\"Yang Pan, should you say you are arrogant, or should you say you are stupid, but it's just a clone who has the courage to attack this **** son.\"Jun Xiaoyao's voice fell, and everyone in the audience solidified again.That champion Hou Yangpan, turned out to be just a clone?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It's just a palm suppression.\" Jun Xiaoyao held his hand, his expression faint.\"You...\" Yang Pan raised his brows, his eyes filled with sternness.\"You deserve to be the Son of God...\" Bai Yuer and the others showed worship.In Huangtian Immortal Realm, how many people dare to despise the champion of the gods like this?\"Okay, Jun Xiaoyao, you are toasting and not eating fine wine.\" Yang Pan said.Around him, four dark figures appeared, carrying a breath of majestic coercion.\"It's the four saints...\" The eyes of the White Tiger and Xuanwu country masters showed fear.If it were not for the four saints, their two countries would not have been defeated and surrendered so easily.Jun Xiaoyao glanced, shook his head slightly and said, \"Four puppets comparable to the Saint Realm, Yang Pan, your luck is good.\"\"What, is that a puppet?\" The two masters of Baihu Xuanwu were surprised.\"What about the puppets, it's enough to suppress you.\" Yang Pan sneered.He didn't even want to kill Jun Xiaoyao.If he killed Jun Xiaoyao with his own strength, even the Jun family would have no handle.After all, the younger generation struggles, life and death are normal.But if Yang Pan killed Jun Xiaoyao with a saint puppet, the Jun family would definitely be furious.Even the Panwu God Dynasty behind him could not protect him.Although Yang Pan was arrogant, he was not mindless.He only needs to use the saint puppet to suppress Jun Xiaoyao and others.Then directly attack the ancient capital of Suzaku and obtain the compass component.\"Jun Xiaoyao, as long as you suppress you with a saint puppet, the ancient kingdom of Vermilion is not in the bag of Lord Benhou. Whether it is the thing or the worship of Yuer, it is Lord Benhou.\"Yang Pan glanced at Bai Yu'er, a fiery and evil color flashed in his eyes.Bai Yuer is indeed very beautiful, charming and charming, making Yang Panxin a little itchy.He has the habit of collecting beauties, and this worship of Yuer is a treasure he must get.\"Wishful thinking, can you compare to a finger of the Son of God?\" Bai Yuer scolded him coldly, showing disgust in his eyes.Although Yang Pan's strength and status are not weak, but in terms of appearance, character, and temperament, he is not comparable to Jun Xiaoyao.One is the fairy in the sky.One is Xiaomin.Can these two compare?\"Bitch, when you surrender to Lord Benhou, see if you will say that!\" Yang Pan scolded.The four saint puppets exploded at the same time, ready to shoot.At this time, Jun Xiaoyao's gaze was swept towards the few country masters.\"You guys, do you still want to follow that Yang Pan?\"The words of Jun Xiaoyao caused the complexion of the Lord Baihu and the Lord Xuanwu to change, and then their eyes changed.To tell the truth, Yang Pan's temperamental personality is even more scolding them for eating shit.Instead of following the champion Hou, it is better to surrender to Jun Xiaoyao.The status of Jun Xiaoyao is only higher than that of Champion Hou.Under this consideration, there was almost no hesitation. The two masters flashed their figures and changed their camps and said: \"I wait, I am willing to surrender to the son of the king's family!\"\"You...\" A cold flame burned in Yang Pan's eyes.The Qinglong Lord's face tightened, he did not choose to stand on Jun Xiaoyao's side.Because his son Xiao Chen had an enmity with Jun Xiaoyao.In addition to this war, he Qinglong Ancient Country is considered the leader.The ancient kingdom of Suzaku will not easily let go of the ancient kingdom of Qinglong.And the most important point is that the lord of Qinglong wants to become the lord of the ancient kingdom of four elephants.Only Yang Pan can fulfill his ambition.Therefore, the Qinglong Kingdom Lord is determined to cling to Yang Pan's thigh.Seeing the indifferent Azure Dragon Lord ~www.mtlnovel.com~ Jun Xiaoyao didn't care.He will rectify Xiao Chen in the future, and it is obviously not a wise move to accept his father as a subordinate.\"Huh, do you two want to be annihilated?\" Yang Panhan said.The faces of the two kingdoms were unnatural.Jun Xiaoyao said lightly: \"With me, who dares to destroy their country?\"\"Jun Xiaoyao, don't be complacent, I will add the Azure Dragon Kingdom Lord and five saints, so I can still suppress you!\"With an order from Yang Pan, the Qinglong Lord led four saint puppets to suppress Jun Xiaoyao.The three masters of Suzaku, Baihu, and Xuanwu were also surging in aura, preparing to meet the enemy.But at this moment, Jun Xiaoyao waved his hand and said with a chuckle: \"Don't have to, just watch the show.\"\"Watching a play?\" The three masters were stunned.At this time, a piano sound suddenly rang in Yuankong, turning into a thousand-foot-thousand-thousand-killing blade, coming out of the sky.The horrible sound of the piano was killing the blade, and even the space was shredded, and a dark space crack was pulled out wherever it went.\"Guardian!\" Yang Pan's expression suddenly changed.This time, he came here as a clone, so there was no protector with him.But he didn't expect that behind Jun Xiaoyao, there was a guardian hiding behind him.And looking at the power of the move, it is by no means comparable to the average saint.\"Damn it!\"In the pupils of the Qinglong Kingdom Lord, there was an unprecedented shock.The sound of the sound of the piano made his saint's heart cold, and his body was filled with chills.\"Tianlong Huangquan!\"The Azure Dragon Lord let out a low roar, and the saint realm's strength completely exploded, and a phantom Azure Dragon blasted out with his fist, shaking the sky!But the result is...puff!The killing blade crossed, the head fell!Lord Qinglong, die!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Although they were not completely disintegrated, they were already fragmented.The needle fell silently throughout the battlefield.Champion Hou Tong trembles fiercely, revealing a ray of incredible.Jun Xiaoyao's protector is so strong?Originally, Yang Pan thought that even if Jun Xiaoyao had a Taoist protector, it was probably only in the realm of a saint.No matter how high the level of power is, generally speaking, it is impossible to be willing to be a babysitter.The guardian of Jun Xiaoyao is obviously beyond the realm of saints.\"Is it a saint king?\" Yang Pan's face was very ugly.Since becoming a champion Hou, he has never suffered such a big loss.Now, his high-end combat power is almost completely lost, and the remaining two broken puppets have almost no combat power.As for Jun Xiaoyao, there are three saints without mentioning the terrifying guardians.In addition, the armies of the ancient Baihu and Xuanwu ancient kingdoms turned against the water.Champion Hou, the trend is over.Seeing such a situation, Yang Pan deeply breathed, \"Jun Xiaoyao, are you really going to fight against Lord Benhou? How about we step back now?\"Yang Pan isn't stupid, he's all at this point, and if he continues to be tough, he will suffer.\"Heh, wasn't it strong before, now you take a step back?\" Jun Xiaoyao said sarcastically.\"Jun Xiaoyao, Lord Benhou is giving you face, and it's no good to be an enemy of me!\" Yang Pan said with an uncertain expression.\"Does this **** want your face, besides, I have so many enemies, and I still need you to be a small servant?\" Jun Xiaoyao looked indifferent.He stopped talking and raised his hand to explore.The fierce golden vitality rose into the air and turned into a lifelike golden idol, as if it could suppress the world.Faced with the avatar of this champion, Jun Xiaoyao didn't need to use any supernatural powers, just slap it over and solve the battle.\"Jun Xiaoyao, you are digging your own grave!\" Yang Pan roared, also bursting out his own supernatural powers.But he is a mere avatar, and he is not even with the Panhuang Shengling Sword. How can he be Jun Xiaoyao's enemy?Puff!Jun Xiaoyao pressed the palm of his hand and directly patted Yang Pan's clone into blood foam, breaking his body to pieces.When seeing this scene, everyone felt their scalp numb.The champion Hou Clone was slapped to death like this.\"The son of the Jun family, is it so powerful?\" Many generals were surprised.Their realm is a few levels higher than Jun Xiaoyao, but seeing Jun Xiaoyao's vigorous posture at the moment, there is a feeling of palpitations in their hearts.At the same time that Jun Xiaoyao smashed Yang Pan's clone.Far away in the Panwu dynasty, a magnificent palace with magnificent splendor, purple aura, and majestic atmosphere.A roar came from it.\"Jun Xiaoyao, my Yang Pan and you are not at odds!\"Hearing this voice, the maids outside the hall looked pale and panicked.If Yang Pan is angry, it is even more terrifying than Shura evil spirits.\"I seem to have heard the name of the prince's son, what kind of hatred did Hou Ye have with him?\" Some of the servants were frightened and thought to themselves.At this time, Yang Pan's cold voice came from the hall.\"Come here, pass the order of Lord Hou, and send out the news that my champion, Hou Yangpan, will meet at the palace of the gods, on the top of the Forbidden City, to fight against the king's house, and the king is happy!\"The time is set on the day when Wu Mingyue chooses a horse, and Lord Benhou will slam Jun Xiaoyao under his feet in front of all the forces in the fairyland!\"Hearing this, all the servants around the entire hall were petrified, their eyes widened, and he took a deep breath.The champion of Panwu Shen Dynasty, the **** son of Huang Gujun.This is not a trivial matter, if it spreads out, it will cause big waves!Coupled with the time to choose the day when Wu Mingyue chooses a consort, then Panwu Shen Dynasty will be so popular.How many forces will be attracted to come?unimaginable\u2026\u2026\"The prosperous age of Tianjiao's battle for hegemony is about to kick off.

If you don't fulfill this oath, you will not be a man!\"Xiao Chen looked up to the sky and roared, with extreme hatred and anger, UU reading www. uukanshu.com surged in his heart.On the side, Master Qinglong's soul body appeared, and his old face was extremely ugly.He also said that Xiao Chen was the son of national luck, but now, even the country is gone.More importantly, that thing is gone.\"Hey, that bronze compass must have already fallen into the bag of the Emperor's God. This one is really too deep.\" Master Qinglong sighed deeply.How did they know that when Jun Xiaoyao met Bai Yu'er, he had already set out to conquer the four ancient kingdoms.As for the bronze compass, it was a surprise.\"Ancestor, I want to become stronger, I must kill that Jun Xiaoyao, I must kill him!\"Xiao Chen's eyes were blood red, his blood vessels were about to explode, and his whole person was like a madman.\"Xiao Chen, settle down, your Dao heart is about to fall into the devil!\" Master Qinglong frowned and shouted coldly.\"Enchanting, haha, what about enchanting, I will kill Jun Xiaoyao, no matter what the price!\"Xiao Chen's delicate face was distorted, hideous like a ghost!\"You forgot, you still have the last two hole cards, the Supreme Blood in the ancient nest, and Wu Mingyue and Panwu Shenchao.\" Master Qinglong said.These words poured cold water on Xiao Chen's head, instantly calming him down.\"Yes, I haven't lost yet. I still have a bright moon. If I want to marry her, she will definitely help me.\" Xiao Chen took a deep breath.Xiao Chen's mood gradually calmed down when he thought of that beautiful woman with a beautiful face.Even if I lost my father, I lost my country.At least, there is a confidante who will accompany him and help him.However, Xiao Chen didn't know.Wu Mingyue concealed the news that she was a slave girl of Jun Xiaoyao.If Xiao Chen finally knew it, it would be hard to imagine how crazy he would become.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

According to news, the consort has actually been decided by default. It is the champion Hou Yang Pan.\"\"However, how could I give Mingyue to that kind of scumbag!\" Xiao Chen said with a cold face.The person he hates most is Jun Xiaoyao.But to Yang Pan, he was also extremely upset.Who is Yang Pan, want to rob his woman?How about champion Hou?Wu Mingyue likes him, not the scumbag of Yang Pan.Therefore, Xiao Chen made up his mind to step on Yang Pan in front of everyone on the day of Wu Mingyue's selection of a consort.Only after defeating Yang Pan, he could get the favor of Panwu Shenchao.\"Well, that ancient nest should be in these barren mountains, go in.\" Qinglong Shanghuan said.Xiao Chen nodded, his figure flashed, and he entered among the mountains.Within a few days, under the guidance of Master Qinglong, Xiao Chen discovered a narrow mountain gap.He entered along the gap, and there was a cave in it, like a small underground world.Various gods are stacked in it, releasing aura glow.Xiao Chen was just staring at him.What made Xiao Chen even more breathed was that he actually found the Supreme Blood with the Ancestral Dragon bloodline in it.That supreme blood, unexpectedly gathered into a small pool of blood.Just when Xiao Chen was ready to accept the opportunity.A female voice high above, like a queen, suddenly came out.\"Mortal, do you dare to move things in this palace?\"\"Who is it?\" Xiao Chen was surprised.\"No, it's probably the ancient freak who was sealed by Xianyuan...\" Master Qinglong said through a voice transmission.\"Huh, there is still a strong soul possessed?\"The woman who claimed to be my palace made a voice, slightly surprised.Xiao Chen gritted his teeth, ignored the voice, and continued to practice with the blood of the supreme.\"Mortal, how about a deal with this palace?\" the female voice said.\"Deal, you are an ancient freak of the Primordial Royal family, what can you do with me?\" Xiao Chen said coldly.\"I don't know how long this palace has been in sleep.

It seemed that the ancient freak in the Ancestral Dragon Nest should have certain restrictions and could not be released temporarily.He can finally settle down to practice.\"Jun Xiaoyao, wait, don't be surprised the next time you appear in front of you...\" Xiao Chen's eyes lit up a flame of revenge.On the side of the Sixiang Ancient Country, after it has stabilized completely, Jun Xiaoyao is also ready to return to Jun's house.After all, he has to start preparing for the next round.Against the Panwu Shen Dynasty Bureau.In Panwuling, Jun Xiaoyao must go, not just because of signing in.It is even more because he may be in it to find the opportunity for the awakening of the next Eucharist vision.Only Panwu Mausoleum was the private treasure of the Panwu God Dynasty, and it was impossible for outsiders to enter casually.Let alone a big figure with the identity of Jun Xiaoyao.No power is so stupid as to take the opportunity of one's own family to support the arrogance of another family.When Jun Xiaoyao left the ancient country of Suzaku, Bai Yuer was extremely reluctant.\"The ancient country of Four Elephants will be handed over to you and the Lord of the Vermilion Bird, don't let me down.\" Jun Xiaoyao said.\"Yes, Yuer must take good care of the ancient country of Vermilion Bird!\" Bai Yuer looked firm.After that, Jun Xiaoyao returned to Jun's house with everyone.The Panwu God Dynasty, the champion Hou Yuezhan, is still fermenting.Jun Xiaoyao never made any statement.This time, some people began to spread rumors on purpose.Said that the son of the Jun family was afraid of the champion and did not dare to challenge.The people who deliberately spread such rumors ~www.mtlnovel.com~ have champions as well as people from the ancient royal family.Their purpose is undoubtedly to discredit Jun Xiaoyao.Of course, there are also many strong supporters of Jun Xiaoyao, who think that Jun Xiaoyao is just disdain to challenge.Most of these supporters are women.After all, no matter where you are, there is always no shortage of such things as stubborn fans.But the facts are indeed as these supporters think.Jun Xiaoyao is just too lazy to fight, just slap Yang Pan by the way, why bother?A few more months passed.Jun Xiaoyao is twelve years old.He has a more prosperous body and a more handsome face.The only thing that bothered Jun Xiaoyao was that there was no immortal source to cultivate the immortal body of Daluo.Later, the Jun family gave Jun Xiaoyao more than a dozen Yuan Yuan, but for Jun Xiaoyao, it was far from enough.Looking at these ten thousand yuan of immortal sources, Jun Xiaoyao did not expect that he would have a day when he lacked resources.\"This Immortal Immortal Body of Da Luo consumes really terrifying resources, more than that of the ancient sacrament.\" Jun Xiaoyao shook his head helplessly.\"Let's suspend cultivation first and find a way to get some resources.\"\"Is it possible to blackmail some resources from the Panwu God Dynasty? As the eldest princess of the God Dynasty, Wu Mingyue should have a lot of resources.\" Jun Xiaoyao murmured.If Wu Mingyue heard this, I was afraid to say that Jun Xiaoyao had Shura's heart again.\"Well, it's time to go to the Panwu God Dynasty. Some rounds should be arranged in advance.\"\"I would also like to see that Xiao Chen and Na Yang clashed, the dog bit the dog and made a furry.\" Jun Xiaoyao smiled.He knew that because of Wu Mingyue's relationship, Xiao Chen and Yang Pan would definitely have a conflict.When the time comes, wouldn't it be interesting to watch two leeks pinch each other?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Various boats, chariots, and flying ancient beasts swept across the sky from time to time and drove in the direction of Panwushen.As a powerful immortal dynasty, if you can marry its eldest princess and become a consort, it can almost be said to be an alliance.Those top-level orthodoxy, want to form an alliance with the Panwu God Dynasty, to a higher level.The immortal forces wanted to turn Panwu Shenchao into their ally.After all, lone palms are hard to scream, even if it is a powerful immortal force, if there is no friendly force, there is also the risk of being besieged by other immortal Daoism.Because of this, many forces are moved, ready to let the disciples try their luck.Not to mention that the princess of the gods, her face is outstanding, she is also a beautiful woman, her popularity is very high, and her reputation is well-known in the deserted fairyland.The superposition of the two reasons made the Panwu Shen Dynasty banquet very powerful.But at the same time the news spread.On the side of champion Hou Fu, champion Hou Yangpan spoke again.He said that if the son of the Jun family dare not fight, then in the future, he will personally climb the gate of the Jun family to challenge.As soon as this heavy news came out, it caused great waves.Many people feel that this champion Hou Weiwei is too rampant.Dare to go to the Junjiashan gate to block others.The last Long Haotian who went to the Junjia Mountain Gate to challenge, the grass on the head of his grave was five feet high.Many female monks who worship Jun Xiaoyao are angry.\"Champion Hou is ugly, just jealous of my happy and prosperous beauty!\"\"Yes, what about his strength? Don't you know that this is the age of looking at faces?\"\"Furthermore, my family is happy, and the strength is also invincible of the same generation, so what is the champion?\"Desolate ancient Jiang family, within the family land.\"Damn it, hate it, it's so damning, it's mad!\"A petite and exquisite figure, stamping his jade feet, was so angry that behind his little head, both double pony tails were raised.A delicate face is also a cute little expression.\"Luo Li, if you don't cultivate well, you will always be locked up in the clan field.\"Not far away, dressed in snow clothes, Jiang Shengyi, who was immortal and graceful, walked up and looked at Jiang Luoli with a fierce face, and had a headache.\"Hmph, Luo Li couldn't bear this tone, that champion, even spreading such news, trying to discredit Xiaoyao brother!\" Jiang Luoli frowned, with an angry expression on his face.\"It's just a lot of villains. The champion Hou's temperament is notoriously bad, so I don't need to care about it. He doesn't care about Xiaoyao either.\" Jiang Shengyi said.The matter of champion Hou Yue Zhanjun Xiaoyao, is raging in the fairyland.Although Jiang Luoli retreats in the clan, she can still get news through the maid.\"No, I want to leave the customs and go to Panwu Shenchao!\" Jiang Luoli said.\"What are you going to do, are you going to fight for the horse?\" Jiang Shengyi joked.\"I'm going to suppress the champion, stomping on his face to vent my anger, and see if he dares to provoke Xiaoyao brother!\" Jiang Luoli said righteously.\"Oh? Is it just that?\" Jiang Shengyi smiled slightly, seeming to see Jiang Luoli through.When Jiang Luoli heard the words, her pretty face turned red, and she lowered her head a little embarrassedly, her two jade fingers twisted at each other.\"Of course, even though it is impossible for Brother Xiaoyao to fight for some kind of spouse, in case...\" Jiang Luoli hesitated.Obviously, Jiang Luoli was afraid that Jun Xiaoyao would go to a banquet, and then compete for the position of the horse and marry Wu Mingyue.After all, Wu Mingyue is also a very famous peerless beauty, and almost no man can see Wu Mingyue without being moved.\"This is your main purpose, right?\" Jiang Shengyi smiled.There is no marriage yet, Jiang Luoli has become a little hen who protects herself.Jiang Luoli was very embarrassed to be said, and her crystal earlobes were all red.\"Okay, then I will take you there.\" Jiang Shengyi smiled helplessly and rubbed Jiang Luoli's little head.\"Oh yeah, Sister Shengyi is the best!\" Jiang Luoli's brilliant smile turned into a crescent shape.Jiang Shengyi also smiled slightly, but there was a touch of unnoticeable sadness deep in his eyes.\"This Nizi, really likes Xiaoyao very much...\"On the other side, Huangguye Family Land.On a towering mountain top, a blue-shirted youth with a handsome face and a sword eyebrow was sitting cross-legged.The sky above his head was like a curtain of night.A dazzling galaxy, flowing in the night, amidst the beauty, with an extremely dangerous aura.This boy is no one else, but Ye Xingyun.As early as when Jun Xiaoyao was ten years old, Ye Xingyun was severely ravaged by Jun Xiaoyao and lost his face.But Ye Xingyun, a blessing in disguise, awakened a certain memory.After that, Ye Xingyun's personality seemed to have undergone subtle changes, becoming more and more calm and restrained.No longer like before, arrogant and sharp.\"Panwu God, champion Hou Yuezhan, with Jun Xiaoyao's character, it is impossible to be absent.\" Ye Xingyun narrowed his eyes ~www.mtlnovel.com~ thinking.Although his character has changed a little, his hatred has not changed.Jun Xiaoyao, he wants to get back in revenge.Jiang Luoli, he also wanted to grab it.\"Well, I will go to Panwu God Dynasty this time, just to find out the true strength of that Jun Xiaoyao.\"Ye Xingyun was sure to let Fuber prepare the car.Chizhou, a vast expanse of ancient Lingshan.The entire Lingshan Mountain covers a very wide area, filled with smoke and clouds, and all over the sky.There are Danya strange rocks, strange cliffs, colorful phoenixes flying, and phoenix birds circling.At a glance, you can't see the end of the mountain range.This boundary is exactly the clan land of Wanhuang Lingshan, one of the ancient imperial families.Wanhuang Lingshan is a top-notch Archaic imperial family alongside the Ancestral Dragon's Nest, with profound background and strong strength.At this moment, an old voice came from a mountain range.\"Huang Xuanyi, Feng Qingling, you two, go to the Panwu God Dynasty, remember, don't lose my reputation as Wanhuangling Mountain.\"\"Yes, please follow the orders of the Great Elder!\"In the mountains, two figures of a man and a woman, surrounded by blazing divine light, rose into the air.Above the sky, two golden phoenix birds were pulling two carts.These two figures directly flashed into it.\"I really don't know if this time, can I see the rumored son of the Jun family?\" Feng Qing said in the car.\"Heh, I also want to see what kind of character Jun Xiaoyao is, who has made Ancestral Dragon Nest's face lost again and again.\" Huang Xuan joined together.\"But we, it's Long Haotian and Long Bichi.\" Feng Qingling chuckles.\"If Jun Xiaoyao underestimated us, he would suffer a lot...\" Huang Xuan's tone was also very relaxed, with a sense of calm and contentment.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The golden color is too dazzling.Jun Xiaoyao didn't want to let himself become a monkey in the zoo and be watched by people.And some of the things he wants to do are inconvenient to be too public.\"Master, can you not call others' real names?\" the nine lions whispered, grimly.Then, its figure shrank suddenly, and finally turned into a one in Jun Xiaoyao's attention...Uh... Shiba Inu.That's right, in Jun Xiaoyao's eyes, this is no different from Shiba Inu.It's just that this is a nine-headed Shiba Inu, which looks weird and funny.\"Is this a walking emoticon, no matter what.\" Jun Xiaoyao sighed lightly.At least the nine Shiba Inu were not so ostentatious.Jun Xiaoyao held his hand and entered the imperial capital through the city gate like a stroll in a leisurely courtyard.The sergeant of the Shen Dynasty guarding the gate of the city, seeing Jun Xiaoyao, were all surprised and afraid to stop him.Because Jun Xiaoyao's temperament is too detached.The whole body was faintly divine, shrouded in fairy radiance, and the whole body was filled with immortal charm and Taoism.This is naturally attributed to the Daluo fairy bone he refined.Jun Xiaoyao's appearance is also shrouded by Xianhui, which makes people indistinct.Jun Xiaoyao was just like that, without any hindrance, he entered the imperial capital directly.After Jun Xiaoyao left, a young guard asked in doubt: \"Chief guard, why didn't you stop that person to check his identity? All monks must be checked when entering the city.\"\"You are so stunned, can that kind of character be able to stop the inspection casually, maybe it is a proud man of an immortal orthodoxy, and his status is not lower than that of the princess!\" The chief guard glared.\"Oh, that's it.\" The young guard also nodded again and again, feeling scared for a while.After Jun Xiaoyao entered the imperial capital, he also attracted a lot of attention.Although his appearance was concealed by the seemingly non-existent haze, his temperament could not be concealed.Many young girls, and some powerful female monks, couldn't help looking at Xiangjun Xiaoyao from the corner of their eyes.There are many people who know Jun Xiaoyao's name in the entire Huangtian Fairyland.But few people have actually met him.In addition, there are also many disciples of immortal Taoism, who are in royal bodies, **** bodies, etc., and their bodies are covered with misty charm.It's impossible that everyone who has a fairy light shrouded in him is Jun Xiaoyao, right?Therefore, no one can see through.At this time, a young girl in a plain blue sarong looked hesitant, but in the end she gritted her teeth and bit her scalp and walked forward.\"This is the first time for the son to come to the imperial capital of the gods. Qin Xuan can lead the son and understand various situations.\"The young girl named Qin Xuan was worried.She had also attracted many disciples from big forces, but it was the first time for a mysterious and transcendent existence like Jun Xiaoyao.The other female monks only dared to wait and see from a distance, and didn't have the courage to approach.\"Oh?\" Jun Xiaoyao's eyes fell on Qin Xuan, his eyebrows lightly raised.Qin Xuan was only fifteen or sixteen years old, and his cultivation level had reached the Great Perfection in the Divine Bridge Realm.He noticed this, but didn't say anything.\"Yes, then you can lead the way.\" Jun Xiaoyao took out a piece of exquisite source of God.A group of passers-by around were staring at it.\"Fuck, this is a source of superb quality, that son is too tyrant, right?\"\"It's definitely a descendant of some immortal force, hey, I really envy that girl!\"There were many exclamations around, and many female monks bit their lips and stomped their feet, cursing that they had missed the opportunity.Qin Xuan also opened her mouth slightly, looking flattered.Jun Xiaoyao's expression was rather plain.Because Peerless God Source is already his most common currency.\"My son, let me tell you the latest news. In a few days, the banquet of the eldest princess of God Dynasty will be held.\"\"There is also the champion, who will fight the king's son at the top of the Forbidden City.\"\"I heard that the deity of the Jun family is a godlike figure, with an invincible appearance of his peers.\"When Qin Xuan said Jun Xiaoyao, her beautiful eyes were full of longing.After all, Jun Xiaoyao is already a dream in the hearts of hundreds of millions of girls in Xianyu.The eyes of the nine lions that followed were strange.If this girl knows that the one next to her is the prince's son she admires and longs for, is she afraid that she will faint with excitement?But then, when it comes to Champion Hou, her mood is obviously wrong, and there is a fluctuation ~www.mtlnovel.com~ It seems that there is a kind of hatred in it.Jun Xiaoyao looked in his eyes and asked casually: \"If the son of the Jun family really agrees, who do you hope will win?\"Qin Xuan heard this, with a deep hatred in her eyes, and said without hesitation: \"Qin Xuan hopes that the king's son can win, and even kill the champion!\"A different color flashed in Jun Xiaoyao's eyes and said: \"At your age, you have the cultivation base of Shenqiao Dzogchen, and your background should not be simple. How can you become a leader?\"Qin Xuan clenched her fists with her five fingers, and said in a deep voice: \"I am a member of Qin Tianhou's Mansion, and my father is Shenchao Qin Tianhou.\"\"And my mother was a well-known beauty in the Shen Dynasty. Later, she was fancyed by the champion Hou and wanted to be included in his harem. My father refused, and was killed by him, and my mother died.\"\"The entire Hou Mansion has fallen, I can only live outside.\" Qin Xuan whispered, but the hatred in her eyes was thick and could not be resolved.\"So it is.\" Jun Xiaoyao nodded slightly.He didn't have much sympathy, after all, there are too many people worthy of sympathy in this world.Jun Xiaoyao is not the kind of Virgin who pity the miserable people.\"Sorry, I must have made the son unhappy after talking about so many personal matters.\" Qin Xuan regained her mood and smiled reluctantly.\"Don't you want revenge?\" Jun Xiaoyao asked.\"Vengeance? The champion Hou is in the Panwu dynasty, like an emperor. Who can get revenge on him?\" Qin Xuan said bitterly, very weak.\"Above the imperial city, the top of the Forbidden City, you may be able to look forward to it then.\"Jun Xiaoyao whispered, holding his hands and walking in front of him leisurely.Seeing Jun Xiaoyao's back, Qin Xuan was a little stunned for a while.She didn't quite understand what Jun Xiaoyao meant by saying this.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Even the third prince could not pursue her hard.\" Qin Xuan said.This is not a big secret, many people know it.Jun Xiaoyao thought in his mind, a plan gradually appeared in his mind.\"My piano skill is average, but dealing with the piano fight should be fairly easy.\"\"If everything can be as I imagined, then Pan Wuling will be stable.\" Jun Xiaoyao smiled at the corner of his mouth, and he was confident.Calculating an immortal force is not that simple.But for Jun Xiaoyao, it is not too difficult to complete.\"That Wu Mingyue is the first chess piece, and the third prince of the Martial God Dynasty is the second chess piece.\" Jun Xiaoyao whispered in his heart.As the time goes.The entire imperial capital is also getting more and more lively.Every day, you can see many young talents of top orthodoxy come.And before Wu Mingyue chooses the consort and the champion Hou Yuezhan.One more thing caused a small sensation.That is the heavenly arrogant girl of the Xianwu Qinzong, the Tianqin Girl, who will hold a Qin fight in Xianqiong Tower.This Tianqin girl is also a well-known beauty in Huangtian Fairyland.It's just that she is an iceberg beauty and has no interest in the pursuit of any young talent.Only the Qin Dao can arouse the interest of the Lyra Girl.But Qin Dao is very partial. In the entire Wild Heaven and Immortal Realm, how many young talents are proficient in Qin Dao?It is precisely because of this that no man has been able to enter the eyes of a Lyra woman.Some people even made up a joke for this.If a man can conquer the Lyra female.Then that man must be the **** of Qindao.Of course, even if Tianqin's female personality is like this, the people who pursue her are still like the crucian carp.The three hundred fairy sources in the Qin Fighting Club were sponsored by the licking dogs of the Lyra Girl.Xianqiong Tower is one of the most luxurious and luxurious pavilions in the imperial capital of God.The entrance fee just to enter the Xianqiong Tower requires ten low-grade gods.It can be said that this is the most luxurious place, and only the top Taoist disciples, the princes and nobles of the gods, and the immortal forces Tianjiao can enter.Today, on the top floor of Xianqiong Building, there is rain and sunshine covering it.Many young talents are gathered together.It can be said that apart from the eldest princess's son-in-law banquet, this piano fight will be the most grand.Among the Tianjiao scattered around, there are many amazing auras, all of which are the top talents of various forces.In one of the VIP seats, there was a young man in a luxurious red-gold robe.He has a handsome face, a calm temperament, and the breath of a superior. He is the third prince of the Panwu dynasty.At this moment, his eyes are looking at the high platform with obsession and nostalgia.On the high platform, the mist is faint.A glamorous and graceful woman in a big red floral dress robe was sitting on it.Her skin is extremely white and her appearance is very beautiful.A Suqin is placed in front of you, stroking the strings, looking from a distance, it is like a beautiful scenery in a scroll.This girl is the arrogant girl of the fairy dance Qin Sect, the Lyra girl.A woman who entered the Taoist way with the piano, was pure and clean.At this moment, her slender and snow-white hands, like sheep's fat jade, were gently ticking the strings, and the gurgling sound of the piano was like running water, unexpectedly attracted spirit birds to fly around Xianqiong Tower.\"This song should only be found in the sky, and it is rare to hear it in the world...\" The third prince was fascinated and full of praise.The attractiveness of Lyra Girl ~www.mtlnovel.com~ is not only her appearance, but also the temperament that exudes from her bones.\"Listen to a fairy song, and wash away the dust on the earth...\" On the other side, a handsome young man with a kind of noble character also sighed.He is the Young Master of Wanbao Chamber of Commerce.Wanbao Chamber of Commerce is a well-known chamber of commerce in Huangtian Immortal Territory. It has strong strength and trades with many immortal traditions.And a large part of the three hundred yuan in the Qin Fighting Club came from the young master of the Wanbao Chamber of Commerce.Of course, although they were in pain when they came out of this Xianyuan, it was also for Boga's laugh.It's just that it's hard to make Lyra female laugh.It is even more difficult to make her look different.At this moment, there was a golden phoenix bird in the distance of the sky, pulling a chariot and driving towards Xianqiong Tower.When they saw the Phoenix Bird, many Tianjiaos were surprised at the top floor of Xianqiong Building.\"That's... the phoenix bird of Ten Thousand Phoenix Spirit Mountain. Could it be that a descendant of Ten Thousand Phoenix Spirit Mountain was born?\"Everyone was extremely surprised.The phoenix bird stopped in the void, and a slender figure shrouded in a red glow came out of the chariot.Behind her, there is a pair of phoenix wings, the beauty of which is dazzling in the sky, which makes people indistinct.It is Feng Qingling.As soon as she and Huang Xuan arrived at the Emperor of God's Capital, they heard about the Qin Fighting Club.It just so happened that Feng Qingling was also good at piano music, so he came to the meeting alone with the desire to win.The Tianqin girl glanced at Feng Qingling and said nothing.Compared to her strength, she may not be able to compare to the descendant of the ancient royal family.But Biqinyi, she asked herself, did not lose any immortal patriots.As time goes by, all the talents are coming together, and the Qin Club will begin.And just at this moment, a figure in white clothes stepped into Xianqiong Tower...Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Xiaoyao, glanced at the luxurious and luxurious Xianqiong Tower, with a sense of anxiety on her face.She has never entered such an upscale place.\"If you don't come in, how can you participate in the piano fight?\" Jun Xiaoyao smiled.He casually took out a superb **** source, and threw it to the young man in Xianqiong Tower.The little servant looked dumbfounded, and did not dare to stop Jun Xiaoyao from entering.Qin Xuan nodded slightly.She also regarded Jun Xiaoyao as a suitor who admired and admired the Tianqin girl.As for fighting the piano?Qin Xuan never thought about it.Soon, Jun Xiaoyao and Qin Xuan boarded the top floor of Xianqiong Building.When Jun Xiaoyao appeared, the eyes of the audience couldn't help but converge.That kind of aura is so special that it's hard for people to even notice.\"Hey, who is that with such an amazing outlook?\"\"How do I feel like an immortal has fallen into the mortal dust?\"Many talents of the big powers have different colors in their eyes.The three princes and the young master of the Wanbao Chamber of Commerce were also surprised.Especially the three princes, while surprised, there was a faint sense of guard in his eyes.In his opinion, most of the men who come to participate in the Qin fight are to pay homage to the fairy posture of the Lyra female.The three princes had long regarded the Lyra female as a forbidden existence.The mysterious son shrouded in fairy light in front of him gave the third prince a faint sense of threat.Because in front of the white-clothed prince, even his prince had a vague sense of inferiority.Like a humble mortal, facing a fairy.This feeling made the three princes extremely unhappy.What made him even more uncomfortable was that the gaze of the Lyra woman was also attracted by the white-clothed young man.\"It's amazing...\"Rao is the frosty character of the Lyra Girl, and she is also surprised at this moment.In front of the white-clothed young man, she was vaguely embarrassed.Jun Xiaoyao didn't care about the gaze of the audience, and found a place to sit down at will.On the other hand, Qin Xuan was a little flustered by being watched by so many people.\"Huh... he...\"On the other side, Feng Qingling also noticed Jun Xiaoyao.The red clouds in her eyes condensed, wanting to see through the fairy mist on Jun Xiaoyao's face.\"Huh?\" Jun Xiaoyao raised his eyebrows slightly, and the true spirit in the divine palace released his soul power in his mind.Suddenly, Feng Qingling frowned, feeling a pain in his mind.\"This person has some ways.\" Feng Qingling frowned and gave up spying.After all, when she came this time, she mainly wanted to meet the Lyrae, who is known as the number one piano artist.Jun Xiaoyao retracted his gaze and murmured: \"People of Ten Thousand Phoenix Spirit Mountain, it seems that this vein has also begun to act.\"The Zulong Nest was doing things before.Now the descendants of Wanhuang Lingshan have also appeared.And these two veins happen to have a good relationship, and they are both aimed at the Jun family.Therefore, Jun Xiaoyao naturally has no good impressions of Feng Qingling.\"Everyone, it's almost time, so let's start the Qin Fighting Club now.\" An old woman from the Immortal Dance Qinzong said beside the high platform.She is also the protector of the Lyra Girl.\"Haha, if that's the case, then I will show my ugliness first, and I also ask the Lyra female to give me some advice.\" A young man walked out, smiling, and took out his guqin.\"please.\"The Lyra woman only uttered one word, her voice was clear and cold.The youth played the piano, and the sound of the piano was like running water.As for the Lyra girl, her glamorous eyebrows were always indifferent.After listening to the song of the young man, the Lyra woman plucked the strings with her slender fingers.In an instant, the sound of the piano sounded like a natural sound.There is a holy glow around her, there is a cloud of smoke rising, and there is a gleam in the void, which sets off the heavenly piano girl, and it is like a fairy in the piano.Almost everyone present was intoxicated by hearing it, and the three princes and the young master of Wanbao Chamber of Commerce and others had a strong admiration in their hearts.The song of Lyra Girl falls, and the reverberation is endless.\"This is a fairy tune, wonderful, wonderful!\"\"After listening to the music of the Lyra Woman, I feel as if I am about to sublimate.\" Many talented people are sighing.\"It's really good.\" Qin Xuan was also fascinated.Even people like her who don't know the way of the piano are a little fascinated.\"Not bad.\" Jun Xiaoyao said lightly.He does not specialize in piano practice, nor has he practiced much.But with Jun Xiaoyao's enchanting talent, plus some famous guqin songs known in previous lives.Under the fusion of the two, Jun Xiaoyao's piano art has reached its peak without knowing it.As for the music of the Lyrae girl, to his ears, it can only be regarded as pretty good, and it belongs to the category that can be appreciated.The young man who challenged the Tianqin girl, arched his hands to the Tianqin girl: \"As expected of the young generation in the fairyland, the first Lyra girl in the Qin Dao, I will bow down.\"\"Accepted.\" Yu Rong, the Lyrican girl, was lightly, not happy because of the victory.Next, several Tianjiao came forward to challenge one after another, all of them lost.Seeing this scene, the three princes, the young master of Wanbao Chamber of Commerce and others all smiled.No one can beat the Lyra Girl in piano art, and no one can arouse the interest of Lyra Girl.At this time, a female voice with a touch of arrogance came.\"Let Qingling come for a while, you, the younger generation of Xianyu, the first person in Qin Dao.\"Feng Qingling got up, dressed in a long red dress, UU reading www.uuk\u0101nshu. com outlines a tall and graceful figure.Although the face was shrouded in the gods, but the vaguely stunning glimpse was amazing.She took out a fiery red guqin, the strings seemed to linger in flames.It is an extremely powerful princely weapon.\"I don't dare to be the first person in Qin Dao. Since Miss Feng is going to challenge, then please.\" The Tianqin girl's tone is light, but she also implies a **** for tat.The two faced each other and started playing the piano at the same time.\"Listen to me, Feng Qiuhuang!\" Feng Qing Lingyu touched the strings, there were countless red runes, branding in the void.Then, there was a sound of phoenix and phoenix.One phoenix, one phoenix, two lifelike divine birds, surrounded Feng Qingling.Such a vision surprised many people.Tianqin Girl also started to play her famous song, Neisang Yuyi.In an instant, everyone seemed to see the immortal palace come to the world, the fairy ere dancing, the sky falling chaotically, and the ground gushing golden lotus.Everyone seems to be intoxicated, I don't know what year it is.Two piano music, interweaving and colliding.Finally, there was a boom.One of Feng Qingling's strings broke.Her face was faintly cyan, and her eyebrows changed.Finally, I stopped playing the piano.\"It's worthy of being the first person in the young generation of piano in Xianyu. If even I can't defeat you, then no one can defeat you.\" Feng Qingling shook his head slightly.She comes from Wanhuangling Mountain, with pride and nobility in her bones.But now, she also had to admit that she was defeated.Of course, this is only a defeat on the piano road, if it is really better than her strength, the Lyra Girl is definitely not as good as her.Moreover, Feng Qingling is also very proud.She believes that she can't defeat the Lyra Girl, and no one in the entire Huangtian Fairyland can beat the Lyra Girl on the piano road.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 100": "Chapter 100\nJun 29, 2022Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaySeeing that even Feng Qingling from Wanhuangling Mountain is no match for the Tianqin Girl on the piano road.The love of the three princes and others is even stronger.\"Hehe, Tianqin Girl has the legend of the Sect Master of the Immortal Dance Qin Sect. On the Qin Dao, I am afraid that no one can beat you.\" The young master of the Wanbao Chamber of Commerce flattered.\"That's not true. My master said that there is one person in Qin Dao, who is far from her.\" The Tianqin woman said suddenly.\"Oh, who is it?\" the third prince asked.The people present were also very curious.In terms of strength, the Sect Master of the Immortal Dance Qin Sect may not be at the top in the Wild Heaven Immortal Domain.But if you talk about Qin Dao, that sovereign can be the number one.The Tianqin girl shook her head slightly and said: \"My master didn't say much, only said that that person seems to have something to do with the Jun family.\"Hearing this, many people around were very surprised.\"The ancient monarch's house?\" The three princes also flickered.If it is said that the emperor has mentioned the most name recently, is it possible that Jun is happy.\"Jun's family...\" There was a slight coldness in Feng Qingling's eyes.She has no affection for the Jun family.But Jun Xiaoyao also felt a little surprised.\"It wouldn't be such a coincidence?\" Jun Xiaoyao thought of his mysterious protector who had never appeared.The Daoist's Qin Dao is strong enough to kill the saint at will.Jun Xiaoyao guessed that in the mouth of the female Tianqin, the master of the Qin Dao who even admired the Sect Master of the Immortal Dance Qin Dao, and Bacheng was his guardian.At this time, the old woman who defended the Tianqin girl said: \"Is there anyone else who wants to challenge the young lady?\"The entire top floor of Xianqiong Building was quiet.Even Feng Qingling of Wanhuangling Mountain was defeated.Who else dares to shoot?\"My son, it seems that this piano fight is about to end.\" Qin Xuan said from the side.However, Jun Xiaoyao stood up.\"The son?\" Qin Xuan looked puzzled.\"I'm taking the liberty to challenge the Lyra female, I wonder if you can?\" Jun Xiaoyao said lightly.All the eyes around, Qi Qi fell to Jun Xiaoyao.A ray of surprise flashed in the beautiful eyes of the Lyra female.She has been secretly paying attention to Jun Xiaoyao, after all, his temperament is too vulgar.\"Of course, I didn't expect the son to be a piano player.\" The female Tianqin said actively.\"Forget it, I probably played for a few months.\" Jun Xiaoyao said.It was indeed only a few months since he signed in and got Fengming Qishan.However, as soon as these words came out, the entire Xianqiong Building fell silent.Many people are even more surprised.\"Is this person entertaining the Lyra girl?\"\"I've only been studying the piano for a few months, and want to challenge the first person on the Qin Dao in the Wild Immortal Domain?\"Everyone felt that this mysterious young man was afraid to be funny.Even the Lyra girl with a frosty temperament could not help but be stunned.If she were to be a person, the Lyrae might not even bother to compete with her.But Jun Xiaoyao's temperament is too special, like an immortal, it is impossible to refuse, wanting to find out.\"Yes, please, please.\" The female Tianqin said with deep eyes.Jun Xiaoyao sat cross-legged on the high platform.There was a hint of sarcasm in Feng Qingling's eyes.Even she can't compare to the Lyra Girl. How can someone who has been studying piano for a few months be able to compare?But at the next moment, Feng Qingling's eyes suddenly solidified.The pupils suddenly shrank, and breathing seemed to stop.Because Jun Xiaoyao took out a guqin.The red gilt, exquisite and gorgeous, with a mysterious and powerful power fluctuation.It is Guqin, Fengming Qishan.\"I'm not mistaken, is that Ancient Saint Soldier?\"\"It's really an ancient sage soldier, what is the origin of that young man, he can come up with an ancient sacred soldier!\"If they were just talents, everyone was quite disapproving of Jun Xiaoyao.So now, it is completely shocked!After all, no one can take out the Old Saint Soldier.\"That young man is definitely a descendant of an immortal tradition!\" Someone thought to himself.The third prince was also surprised.There were many discussions in the entire Xianqiong Building.Feng Qingling looked at Fengming Qishan, her beautiful eyes filled with unprecedented heat.That piano fits her too well.If she had got the violin early, maybe she would not lose to the Lyra girl.Greed surged in Feng Qingling's eyes.As the Taikoo royal family, domineering is a character that has been melted into their blood.And here, the girl's heart was shaken.She became more sure that the fairy-like son in front of him was very big.Next, the Tianqin girl calmed her mind and began to play the piano.Still a good trump card, neon clothes feather song.Jun Xiaoyao's slender fingers plucked the strings.One of the top ten famous songs, Guangling San!When the song comes out, the sky is auspicious and the flowers of the avenue bloom.In the void, patches of light and rain fell.This is the concrete manifestation of Tao, making everyone present seem to have experienced a sublimation.As for Jun Xiaoyao, his whole body was shrouded in Xianhui, his aura was too sacred, and his aura was full.At this moment, everyone lost consciousness.In the song Jun Xiaoyao, Tao has been integrated into the sound of the piano, which is a kind of comprehension and evolution.It has even surpassed the music itself!Feng Qingling took a deep breath, his scarlet eyes were full of shock.She just said that if she cannot defeat the Lyra Girl, no one in the entire fairyland can beat the Lyra Girl.But now, hearing this music, Feng Qingling was lost.This Qin song, Lyra Girl's Feather Clothes Song, is far incomparable!The Lyra woman stopped stroking the qin, her beautiful eyes stunned.She could no longer play.Because she plays only form.And Jun Xiaoyao is a god!If the Qin Dao has a god, then it should also look like Jun Xiaoyao!\"Lost.\" The Lyra female murmured, feeling like she never had before, emerging from her heart.When the song ended, Jun Xiaoyao felt refreshed.He glanced around, everyone was still in the lingering sound.After a long while, these arrogances came back to their senses, and there were tremors in their pupils.\"Lianqin girl, willing to bow down to the wind.\" Tianqin girl actually got up and bowed to Jun Xiaoyao.\"Miss...\" The old woman of Xianwu Qinzong ~www.mtlnovel.com~ was also surprised.The young lady of their family has always been cold and noble.Don't say bowing down to other men, it's just that you don't see it straight.When the third prince saw this scene, his face turned green.There is also the young master of Wanbao Chamber of Commerce, who also looks ugly.However, he is also considered to have a lot of knowledge and experience, knowing that people like Jun Xiaoyao must not provoke casually.If you are not careful, it will bring disaster.\"Since the young master is victorious, then these three hundred immortal sources belong to the young master.\" The Tianqin girl was generous, without any hesitation, and directly handed the three hundred immortal sources to Jun Xiaoyao.The three princes and others who saw this scene were more like eating flies, their faces turned purple.There is a feeling of using one's own money to raise a rival in love.There was a splendor in the eyes of the Lyra female, looking at Jun Xiaoyao, slightly hesitating, she still spoke.\"The Lyrican girl has a ruthless invitation, and hopes to communicate with her son through the night.\"The mysterious young man in front of him, with outstanding temperament and amazing talent, can easily take out the ancient sage soldier, obviously the background is also good.In addition, Qin Dao is still so extraordinary, so she is willing to bow down.Even if the Lyra Girl is an iceberg beauty, she can't help but melt at this moment.The water rushed.And the three princes and others who heard this, their chest tightness and gas blocked, their faces alternated with blue and white.Playing piano all night?Still talking about love all night?The third prince felt that he was too green.The corner of Jun Xiaoyao's lips made a faint smile.Things really developed as he expected.The plan may be implemented smoothly.Just when Jun Xiaoyao was about to speak.A female voice interrupted them.\"Your Guqin, I am very interested...\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
